The Province ensures the preparation of recovery strategies to meet its commitments to recover species at risk under the Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA, 2007) and the Accord for the Protection of Species at Risk in Canada.\n\nWhat is recovery?\n\nRecovery of species at risk is the process by which the decline of an endangered, threatened, or extirpated species is arrested or reversed, and threats are removed or reduced to improve the likelihood of a species' persistence in the wild.\n\nWhat is a recovery strategy?\n\nUnder the ESA, 2007, a recovery strategy provides the best available scientific knowledge on what is required to achieve recovery of a species. A recovery strategy outlines the habitat needs and the threats to the survival and recovery of the species. It also makes recommendations on the objectives for protection and recovery, the approaches to achieve those objectives, and the area that should be considered in the development of a habitat regulation. Sections 11 to 15 of the ESA, 2007 outline the required content and timelines for developing recovery strategies published in this series.\n\nRecovery strategies are required to be prepared for endangered and threatened species within one or two years respectively of the species being added to the Species at Risk in Ontario list. There is a transition period of five years (until June 30, 2013) to develop recovery strategies for those species listed as endangered or threatened in the schedules of the ESA, 2007. Recovery strategies are required to be prepared for extirpated species only if reintroduction is considered feasible.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nNine months after the completion of a recovery strategy a government response statement will be published which summarizes the actions that the Government of Ontario intends to take in response to the strategy. The implementation of recovery strategies depends on the continued cooperation and actions of government agencies, individuals, communities, land users, and conservationists.\n\nFor more information\n\nTo learn more about species at risk recovery in Ontario, please visit the Ministry of Natural Resources Species at Risk webpage at: www.ontario.ca/speciesatrisk\n\nRecommended citation\n\nMacGregor, R., J.

(Officer, Order of Canada and Founder of Circle of All Nations), Elder Albert Marshall (Eskasoni Mi'Kmaw First Nation), Elder Murray Whetung (Curve Lake First Nation) and Henry Lickers Akwesasne First Nation) for their dedication and tireless efforts to work toward harmony with the environment. We thank them for their wisdom and for granting permission to share their insights in the recovery strategy. We give particular thanks to Elder Commanda for informing the Governor General and the Queen that \"the ancient American Eel, which was once so plentiful in the Ottawa River Watershed, has been placed on the Endangered Species List in Ontario\" (Commanda 2009). Thanks to Dr. Cheryl Bartlett for permission to include the Two-Eyed Seeing logo developed by Integrative Science at Cape Breton University and to David Oliver of Skylark Information Systems for assistance with preparation of maps to support our work. We especially appreciate the efforts of Dr. L. Bernatchez and Caroline Cote, Laval University, in preparing the genetics section and thank Dr. Chris Wilson, geneticist for OMNR, for his review of an early draft of it. Thanks also to Dr. Peter Hodson, Queen’s University and Dr. John Fitzsimmons, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Burlington) for their helpful comments on specific sections of the strategy and to Dale Honeyfield, USGS for making his paper available for use in the strategy. We also appreciate the numerous anonymous comments provided by agencies, First Nations, other stakeholders and the general public; many were very helpful in strengthening the final document.\n\nThe partnering efforts by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in writing this recovery strategy and the likelihood of continuing long-term work together, has strengthened our relationships with one another and with the American Eel. Collective efforts among government, stakeholders and Aboriginal peoples to recover this species will not only aid in the restoration of lost ecological services, and restore biodiversity, cultural and natural heritage values, but will be a significant milestone in recovering and strengthening relationships among our cultures.\n\nDeclaration\n\nThe recovery strategy for the American Eel was developed in accordance with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA). This recovery strategy has been prepared as advice to the Government of Ontario, other responsible jurisdictions and the many different constituencies that may be involved in recovering the species.\n\nThe recovery strategy does not necessarily represent the views of all of the individuals who provided advice or contributed to its preparation or the official positions of the organizations with which the individuals are associated.\n\nThe goals, objectives and recovery approaches identified in the strategy are based on the best available knowledge and are subject to revision as new information becomes available. Implementation of this strategy is subject to appropriations, priorities and budgetary constraints of the participating jurisdictions and organizations.\n\nSuccess in the recovery of this species depends on the commitment and cooperation of many different constituencies that will be involved in implementing the directions set out in this strategy.\n\nResponsible jurisdictions\n\nOntario Ministry of Natural Resources\n\nFisheries and Oceans Canada\n\nExecutive summary\n\nThe American Eel (Anguilla rostrata) is the only member of the genus Anguilla found in North America. In Ontario, it is near the northern extremity of its range, which spans fresh and coastal Atlantic Ocean waters of North, Central (Mexico) and northern South America. Aboriginal traditional knowledge, anecdotal (local knowledge from the public), archaeological information, historical documents and old fisheries records tell us that the American Eel was once extremely abundant throughout all tributaries to Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. Declining abundance in most watersheds appears to have been underway by the turn of the twentieth century. More recently, the American Eel has been apparently extirpated from many parts of its Ontario range and is in serious decline where it still exists, leading to its listing as endangered under Ontario’s Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA).\n\nPresent science considers the American Eel to consist of a single breeding population in which all individuals travel to the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic Ocean to spawn. From there, young eels drift with ocean currents and most eventually migrate inland into streams, rivers and lakes. Ontario’s eels, being virtually all female and the most fecund within the species' range, are an important segment of the global population.\n\nIn Ontario, the American Eel is a highly valued fish for Aboriginal peoples, and was also highly valued by European settlers. It thus forms a strong component of Ontario’s cultural and natural heritage. It is clear that the species has been in decline in Ontario due to anthropogenic effects for a century; the American Eel has been completely extirpated from extensive areas of many Ontario watersheds and is in steep decline in the remainder of the province’s waterbodies.\n\nThe cumulative effects of eel mortality during downstream migration due to hydro-electric turbines, reduced access to habitat imposed by man-made barriers to upstream migration, commercial harvesting in jurisdictions other than Ontario, contaminants, and habitat destruction, alteration and disruption are among the most significant threats to the survival and recovery of the American Eel in Ontario. Thiamine deficiency in Lake Ontario eels may pose additional stress to Lake Ontario eels, but research is required to confirm the potential effects.\n\nRecovery of the American Eel in Ontario is a long-term prospect, likely to take many eel generation times to complete in its fullest sense (one generation = approximately 20 years). The recovery goal for the American Eel is to re-establish the species in a wide variety of waters throughout its historical range in Ontario by the year 2150, at abundance levels that: (1) restore cultural relationships and natural heritage values, (2) are consistent with ecosystems of high integrity and function, (3) strengthen the biodiversity of the province’s watersheds, and (4) provide valued ecological services. Achievement of the goal will provide the best opportunity for long-term persistence of the species in Ontario while enabling Ontarians to regain some of the benefits they once derived from the species. Given the extensive time frame (equivalent to seven eel generations) of the recovery goal, the range of presently available mitigation approaches and the potential for development of new approaches over this period, it is the opinion of the American Eel Recovery Team that the goal is reasonable and achievable. Although full recovery of historical abundance may not be feasible, recovery to beneficial levels should be possible in most areas of the historical range. Much progress can be made within one eel generation time. Now that anthropogenic mortality due to fishing in Ontario has been addressed, it is recommended that eel recovery actions emphasize strategic provision of enhanced, adequate and safe upstream and downstream passage. The recovery goal will be achieved through the following recovery objectives.\n\nStrategically restore access to habitat within the historical range of the American Eel.\n\nBy 2150, restore resilience of the American Eel to anthropogenic stress in Ontario by diversifying habitats available to the American Eel across its historical range in Ontario. This should be accomplished by protecting and strategically restoring access to and use of, both the upper St. Lawrence River/Lake Ontario and the inland watersheds formerly used by the American Eel in Ontario.\n\nBy 2050, increase production and enhance resilience of the American Eel by strategically restoring access to all immediate tributaries of the Ottawa River, Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River (generally proceeding downstream to upstream). Improvements to downstream passage should be made within 10 years of restoring access to areas where it was formerly prevented.\n\nBeginning immediately and using the habitat range in 2000 as the baseline, increase American Eel access to habitat by 10 percent every five years, consistent with the draft National Management Plan for the American Eel (Canadian Eel Working Group [CEWG] 2009).\n\nIt is recommended that the watershed areas in which to restore access should be strategically determined through the development and implementation of Watershed-based Implementation Plans (WIPs), with full public and Aboriginal consultation.\n\nIncrease escapement and recruitment.\n\nIncrease escapement of silver and large yellow eels from watersheds in their historical range within Ontario.\n\nBy 2050, reduce cumulative mortality rates by 50 percent at the watershed level (the benchmark against which this is to be measured is the 1997-2002 average; CEWG 2009). The intent is to increase the escapement of large, mature female eels from provincial waters to levels targeted in implementation plans for a given watershed. This objective is intended to support increased recruitment of eels. As there is no eel fishing in Ontario, the focus will need to be on cumulative mortalities due to turbines.\n\nBy 2070, increase the number of American Eels annually migrating from Ontario to the ocean to levels consistent with those observed in the early 1980s. Continue to undertake negotiations with power operators to develop options to reduce mortality, increase escapement and enhance recruitment of the American Eel in Ontario. Consult with Aboriginal communities, the public and other stakeholders on the options.\n\nEnhance recruitment.\n\nMeasured at the Moses-Saunders ladders (Saunders and New York Power Authority ladders combined), achieve recruitment of eels ascending the ladders consistent with the returns observed during the late 1970s and early 1980s at the Saunders ladder (as this was the only ladder in existence during the early 1980s).\n\nReduce anthropogenic mortality of eels in boundary waters managed jointly with other jurisdictions.\n\nLocate, protect, restore and enhance habitats upon which eels depend.\n\nReduce other sources of stress on the American Eel (e.g., contaminants, disease, harmful destruction, alteration or disruption of habitat).\n\nUse an appropriately coordinated and strategic watershed-based approach to eel recovery across its historical range in Ontario.\n\nStrengthen the engagement of Aboriginal peoples, stakeholders and other partners in the development and implementation of recovery actions for the American Eel.\n\nMaintain strong Ontario participation and leadership in the development and implementation of coordinated inter-jurisdictional protection, management and recovery of the American Eel and its habitats at national and bi-national levels.\n\nEnsure ongoing understanding by scientists, managers, stakeholders, First Nations and the general public of the current status of the American Eel and the efficacy of recovery strategy actions.\n\nEvaluate potential short-term methods of supporting eel abundance through such means as translocations and eel ladders in key watersheds.\n\nAddress knowledge gaps to enable and enhance protection, conservation and recovery efforts.\n\nThe American Eel recovery should occur through coordination and integration of science, management and conservation across the numerous jurisdictions and among the agencies and organizations responsible for eel management in North America. It is important that Ontario continue its strong efforts to encourage the participation of others to reverse the American Eel declines. It also should include a commitment to integrate western science with Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge and community knowledge in the implementation of the recovery strategy.\n\nAll migratory corridors (historical and current) for the American Eel should be contained in the habitat regulation. This would include all waters that are tributaries to Ontario’s portions of Lake Ontario, the St. Lawrence River and the Ottawa River.\n\nIt is recommended that the habitat regulation should protect the primary habitat in both lentic (still) and lotic (moving) waters, including all waters extending from the high-water mark down to a depth of 10 m for all reaches currently or formerly occupied or used as migratory corridors by the American Eel. This includes all rivers, streams and rivulets, both permanent and ephemeral. It should be noted that potential habitat can be much broader depending on the water body and can extend from the high water mark to any depth. Local knowledge should be used to determine if refinements in particular water courses or reaches are necessary. Otherwise, protecting the primary habitat to a depth of 10 m should be sufficient.\n\nFinally, as the recovery of many aquatic fish species at risk will be prevented by the same anthropogenic impacts, an ecosystem approach should be adopted during the development and implementation of the WIPs wherein other species at risk are given due consideration at the same time.\n\n1.0 Background\n\nKnowledge integration\n\nThe American Eel Recovery Team developed this recovery strategy to guide the recovery and facilitate the long-term sustainability of American Eel (Anguilla rostrata)footnote 1[1]in Ontario. The recovery strategy is consistent with a number of important conservation principles and government policies [see MacGregor et al. (2011), a background document that contains important technical and other information that was used in developing the recovery strategy]. The recovery strategy recommends strategic approaches to recovery focused on reversibility of: (a) substantial provincial declines in abundance, and (b) ongoing extensive range contractions. Taken as a whole, the recovery strategy considers uncertainty, favours diversity, reversibility and adaptability over time, and expects positive steps towards sustainability (adapted from Gibson 2005). The recovery strategy was produced by bringing together and integrating the thoughts of a large team of experts in the science, management, use, and Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (ATK) of the species in the province.\n\nOne of the purposes of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA) is to \"identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (ATK).\" In developing the recovery strategy a strong effort was made to incorporate both community knowledge and ATK. Both have been included wherever possible in development of the recovery strategy.\n\nCultural differences in how knowledge is obtained, viewed and communicated make integration of ATK with western science a significant challenge – one that is important to surmount, and can be met with ongoing dialogue among those who have a commitment to the guiding principle of Two-Eyed Seeing (Allen 2008a, Allen et al. 2008).\n\nThe principle of Two-Eyed Seeing was developed by Elder Albert Marshall of Eskasoni First Nation, who described it as the respectful joint integration of ATK and empirical science. The American Eel Recovery Team adopted and embedded this principle in the process of developing the Recovery Strategy for American Eel in Ontario.\n\nThe American Eel Recovery Team views ATK as an integrative 'way of knowing' gained through deep spiritual, physical, emotional and intellectual ties with nature. It reflects intimate, holistic observation of the environment. Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge in this recovery strategy is not considered to be analogous to data that can be collected; however, it is considered to reflect the insight and understanding that arises from analysis in western science. While ATK rests on the foundation of generations of oral knowledge sharing, it is not static and thus not solely traditional. Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge is unique to specific local environments and, as with the continuing refinements of western science, it grows with each generation providing insight into current conditions. Eels have not only been of major importance for Aboriginal peoples as a source or food for thousands of years, they were of substantial cultural, spiritual, material and medicinal significance to Aboriginal peoples (Prosper and Paullette 2002, MacGregor et al. 2008, 2009, 2011, Denny et al. 2012). Consequently, ATK for this species is of special significance.\n\nThe joint efforts of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal members of the recovery team to integrate knowledge from ecology and fisheries science with ATK and community knowledge in developing this recovery strategy has provided a much richer understanding than could have been gained with an ATK or western scientific perspective alone.\n\nAnecdotal information from an earlier time, and early eyewitness accounts provide valuable insight into the past distribution, abundance and importance of the American Eel (Pauly 1995, Pinnegar and Englehard 2008). Clearly, ATK provides especially valuable information from an earlier time. All forms of information, including anecdotal information, early eyewitness accounts and ATK have been and continue to be critically important to piecing together the former status and distribution of eels in Ontario.\n\nElder William Commanda, founder of a Circle of All Nations, talks in terms of the joint need for very long-range perspectives and vision, saying that we need to \"come together in love, peace, reconciliation and unity\" (Thumbadoo 2005), and work with \"one heart, one mind, one love, and one determination\" (Circle of All Nations, undated). He states that, \"Today, the plight of the Eel must awaken us to the crucial need to transform our relationship with Mother Earth and All Our Relations, and to awaken us to the pivotal role of Indigenous Peoples in this process\" (Commanda, pers. comm. 2008).\n\nThe successful restoration of eels to their native habitat across the historical range will be consistent with Canada’s commitment to Aboriginal peoples in the UN Convention on Biodiversity (CBD 2000), and will also restore some benefits lost to residents of Ontario in all parts of the species' range.\n\nElder Commanda’s perspective has been a hallmark of the development of this recovery strategy. It has been an exercise of strong, unified thinking and consensus among the scientists, resource managers, stakeholders and Aboriginal people representatives on the American Eel Recovery Team (see Appendix 1). As noted in a letter from Chief Kirby Whiteduck, Algonquins of Pikwàkanagàn, eels were a highly important food source for the Algonquin people, and were an important element of their economic, cultural and social way of life (MacGregor et al. 2011). Algonquins are very supportive of efforts to rehabilitate American Eel in its historic range (MacGregor et al. 2011, Algonquins of Ontario, 2012).\n\nAboriginal peoples participating in the development of the Recovery Strategy for the American Eel in Ontario see the process as one of both healing the damage done to the eel and strengthening the relationships among all involved in the recovery effort. Knowing that American Eel has long been integral to their cultural identity, practices and customs, Aboriginal representatives have resolved to support Ontario and Canadian efforts for recovery of the species (see Appendix 2 and MacGregor et al. 2011).\n\n1.1 Species assessment and classification\n\nCommon name:\n\nAmerican Eel\n\nScientific name:\n\nAnguilla rostrata\n\nSARO List Classification:\n\nEndangered\n\nSARO List History:\n\nEndangered (2008)\n\nCOSEWIC Assessment History:\n\nThreatened (2012), Special Concern (2006)\n\nSARA Schedule 1:\n\nNo Schedule\n\nRankings:\n\nG-Rank: G4 N-Rank: N4 S-Rank: S1?\n\nThe Glossary provides definitions for technical terms, including the acronyms used in the table.\n\n1.2 Species description and biology\n\nSpecies description\n\nThe American Eel is variously known as the Atlantic Eel, Freshwater Eel, Common Eel, Silver Eel, Yellow Eel, Bronze Eel, Easgann, and Anguille d'Ameriqué, among other names. The Mi'kmaq people called eels Kat (Prosper and Paulette 2002). Eels were called pimizi by the Algonquins (McGregor 1994), bimizi by the Ojibwe (Baraga 1878), and goda:noh by the Seneca (Bardeau 2002).\n\nJuvenile and adult American Eels are yellowish-green or brownish, elongated, serpent-like fish with very small, deeply embedded scales. In Ontario, eels are generally larger (maximum length of about 1.3 m), less dense, slower growing and older (up to 42 years; J. Casselman, unpub. data) than individuals found in the southern part of the range. Casselman (2003, 2008) provides detailed information on the size, age and growth of the American Eel.\n\nThe American Eel naturally inhabiting the upper St. Lawrence River, Ottawa River and Lake Ontario watersheds comprise a distinctive sub-population or phenotype. The hallmark of this phenotype is that these eels (when mature) are exclusively large, old and highly fecund females when mature, the most fecund in the species' range (Casselman 2003, Verreault et al. 2003, 2009, COSEWIC 2006, Tremblay 2009). The extremely high reproductive value of large, old female fish has been well described and recognized (Palumbi 2004, Berkeley et al. 2004a,b, Field et al. 2008, Venturelli et al. 2010, Hutchings and Rangeley 2011). The contribution of these individuals to the spawning stock of the American Eel is considered to have been biologically significant (Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat [CSAS] 2011) when eels were more abundant in these waters.\n\nIt is important to note that only female eels are typically observed in headwater streams (Goodwin and Angermeier 2003) and that the American Eel body sizes typically increase with distance from the ocean (Lookabaugh and Angermeier 1992, Smogor et al. 1995). As eels in Ontario are at the extremity of the range at the headwaters of the the St. Lawrence River (several thousand km from the ocean), and fecundity increases with body size (Barbin and McCleave 1997), it is not surprising that Ontario eels are all females, the largest and most fecund in the North American Range.\n\nEel genetics and population structure\n\nTwo species of Anguillid eels spawn in the Sargasso Sea: the American Eel and European Eel (Anguilla anguilla). Morphological and genetic studies have established that the American and European Eel are two distinct species, yet they are capable of hybridizing (Albert et al. 2006, van Ginneken and Maes 2005). Molecular genetics data provide evidence both supporting and rejecting the hypothesis that the American Eel is composed of a single, randomly mating (panmictic) population (reviewed in Maes and Volckaert 2007).\n\nRecently however, a very thorough population genetics analysis – based on the genotyping of 18 \"neutral\" microsatellite markers on over 2,500 individuals from 34 locations and nine year classes – found no significant evidence of genetic differentiation between life history stages (glass versus yellow eels), geographic origin or age classes. This constitutes very strong and definitive support for the panmixia hypothesis (Bernatchez et al. 2011, Côté et al. 2013). Even so, individual eels from this single, randomly mating population are not genetically or phenotypically identical and therefore may not have the same fitness under different environmental conditions.\n\nFor example, controlled growth studies conducted by Côté et al. (2009) (see also Bernatchez et al. 2011) showed that eels from the Maritimes (Cape Breton) grew more quickly in both freshwater and brackish water environment than eels from Grande-Rivière-Blanche (Québec). Also, the plastic growth response to both environments differed between eels of both origins. These results suggested that young eels that survive and settle at a given location may be genetically different (within the context of panmixia) from those at other locations (L. Bernatchez, pers. comm. 2010, Bernatchez et al. 2011). These divergent groups are called \"clusters\" or \"contingents\" (Secor 1999), rather than \"populations\", since eels are panmictic and there is no reproductive barrier. Each eel \"contingent\" is composed of individuals with similar fitness in a particular environment.\n\nIndeed, recent research supported this hypothesis and revealed genetic differences at coding genes under selection between glass eels from different sampling sites along the Atlantic coast (Gagnaire et al. 2012). These authors also isolated surface temperature encountered when approaching the coastal area as a major factor that can induce a form of \"genetically structured contingents\" (Gagnaire et al. 2012). Regional differences in patterns of survival suggest the possibility of at least partial demographic independence among distinct American Eel contingents. In particular, evidence from research and personal observation suggests that St. Lawrence River/Lake Ontario eels represent a regionally distinct phenotype, and that this phenotype may have a genetic basis (Vladykov and Liew 1982, Bernatchez et al. 2011).\n\nThe principal mechanism behind eel contingents is thought to be differential mortality, but differential migratory behaviours can not yet be ruled out. The American Eel within the Upper St. Lawence River-Lake Ontario (USLR-LO) watersheds (including the Ottawa River) represent a small contingent of the global American Eel gene pool that is unique in being most fit for the USLR-LO environment. At spawning, these genes become dispersed into the broader population gene pool. As the American Eel abundance declines, the risk of losing these relatively rare genes increases dramatically. If lost it may not be possible to rescue the phenotype from other sources (L. Bernatchez, pers. comm. 2010, Bernatchez et al. 2011). This could perhaps explain why the recruitment decline in the USLR-LO environment has been more pronounced than in the Maritimes provinces.\n\nSpecies biology\n\nLife cycle\n\nThe American Eel has a complex life history (Figure 1) with stages occurring in oceanic, coastal, estuarine and freshwater environments. The American Eel begins life in the Sargasso Sea and returns to the Sargasso Sea to spawn, the only location where it does so. Spawning, which has never been observed, has been inferred from sampling of young in the Sargasso Sea. Spawning emigration begins in May from the Richelieu River (Québec). Emigration peaks between July and September in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River waters and may continue into November.\n\nEggs hatch into larvae that are called leptocephali because of their transparent and willow-leaf-like form. The larvae drift in the Gulf Stream system for 7 to 12 months and transform into glass eels once they reach 55 to 65 mm in length. Glass eels have the typical elongate and serpentine form of the species and become progressively pigmented as they move across continental shelves to the shoreline. Once pigmented, they are considered elvers. The elver stage lasts from 3 to 12 months, during which time some migrate upstream into fresh water. In Atlantic Canada, timing of elver migration varies geographically. On the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, arrival occurs in July when elvers reach 60 to 70 mm in length. As elvers grow, they become known as yellow eels and after a number of years, they mature into silver eels. Additional information on the complicated life cycle of the American Eel is available in Tesch (1977) and COSEWIC (2012).\n\nFigure 1. Life cycle of the American Eel (OMNR 2007)\n\nDispersal of eels into fresh water can be heavily influenced by density-dependent effects (Feunteun et al. 2003), i.e., the higher the density, the stronger the push to continue to move upstream. It can also be somewhat random (Ibbotson et al. 2002, Edeline et al. 2007), especially as eels grow larger. Juvenile eel movements into the Upper St. Lawrence River-Lake Ontario system appear to be both random and density-dependent. Eels tend to be very slow to mature in these waters (Jessop 2010).\n\nThe yellow eel stage is most commonly observed in fresh water and is the principal stage in the life cycle that is observed in Ontario. Yellow eels are characterized by thick, tough skin, yellow-green to olive-brown colouration on the belly and darker colouration on the back. Sexual differentiation occurs during the yellow eel stage, the principal growth stage. Yellow eels may continue to travel upstream for many years, with seasonal peaks, usually between June and August in the upper St. Lawrence River. In Canada, eels typically hibernate in mud during winter, entering torpor at temperatures below 5°C, although there are records of eels remaining active during winter. Eel \"balling\" in the mud in winter has been well documented by Aboriginal peoples and commercial fish harvesters who speared large numbers through the ice (Prosper and Paulette 2002). This practise continues in the Maritimes.\n\nThe true silver phase is rarely seen in Ontario waters, although a greying intermediate phase occurs in some of the largest, oldest individuals (Casselman 2003). Silver eels, the mature freshwater phase, are greyish to white ventrally and develop a number of morphological and physiological adaptations for the long migration back to the spawning grounds. These include an enlarged pectoral fin, enlarged eye, modified retinal pigments and increased body fat. Mature eels are considered to spawn (in the Sargasso Sea) between February (peak) and April.\n\nResilience of the American Eel\n\nMany diadromous fish populations use multiple modes of migration and multiple habitats (McDowall 1996). While eels are typically catadromous (migrating from freshwater to the sea to spawn), this life history strategy is not obligatory, as some eels appear to complete their entire life cycle in marine environments (Lamson et al. 2006). For eels and other fish species, segments of the population that exhibit different life cycle strategies are called \"contingents\" (Secor 1999, Jessop et al. 2002). In the American Eel, at least two contingents are recognized: (1) eels that complete their life cycle exclusively in marine environments; and (2) eels that migrate into and use freshwater environments to grow and mature before returning to the sea for spawning. Multiple life history strategies can reduce overall variance of population responses to environmental change, thus increasing stability and resilience (MacGregor et al. 2009, Secor 2010). Diversity of life history tactics in fish populations is increasingly recognized as having the effect of offsetting environmental stochasticity and contributing to long-term persistence (Secor 2007). For American Eel, diversity in life cycle strategies has been a hallmark of the species' success and is helpful in understanding the formerly wide distribution. MacGregor et al. (2009) discuss the importance of life cycle diversity to the American Eel resilience, conservation and recovery.\n\nDifferent life cycle contingents can be differentially vulnerable to exploitation, habitat degradation and climate change (Secor 1999, 2007). For this reason, constituent patterns of life cycle diversity within populations should be regarded as a \"portfolio,\" or a collection of life cycles, which hedges against future environmental uncertainty through mechanisms that permit life cycle diversity to persist generation after generation (Secor and Kerr 2009). Some may argue that marine-resident eels are sufficient to prevent the extinction of the species. Such speculation would be hazardous and risk-prone (McCleave and Edeline 2009). Further losses of freshwater eels may have serious demographic impacts because freshwater eels, by silvering at a larger size than sea eels, have higher fecundity (McCleave and Edeline 2009).\n\nWhile catadromy in anguillid eels may be facultative, it remains a major life history trait for anguillid eels. Freshwater habitats tend to be more diverse (Secor 2010), less risky in terms of predation and support lower densities than brackish water habitats (Daverat et al. 2006). These features promote a diversity of outcomes (Secor 2010) and a larger diversity of phenotypes than brackish sites characterized by high densities and high natural mortalities (Daverat et al. 2006), thereby confering resilience to the eel population (Secor 2010). Moreover, it has been well documented that for the American Eel, relatively low densities in the USLR-LO system promote the development of juvenile eels as females (J. Casselman, unpub. data, Jessop 2010). Large, fecund females are the dominant form in upstream freshwater habitats (e.g., McCleave 2001). This has been the \"trademark\" of eels in Ontario (Casselman 2003, Verreault et al. 2003, 2009, COSEWIC 2006, Tremblay 2009). Large size and high fecundity enhance resilience in eels, as does a diverse array of accessible habitats in which to grow and mature. In Ontario, the diverse array of freshwater habitats (rivers, streams, marshes, ponds, lakes, etc.) formerly accessible and extensively used by the freshwater contingent of the American Eel would have promoted varying outcomes (e.g., survival, growth rate), thereby minimizing risks due to future environmental or anthropogenic change (Secor 2010).\n\nMany Ontario eels remain in fresh water for an extremely long time (up to 25 years) before migrating back to sea. Such longevity could span periods of poor oceanic conditions (Secor 2007, Cairns et al. 2009, Secor and Kerr 2009, Secor 2010), thereby conferring further resilience to the population. The fact that naturally recruited mature eels indigenous to Ontario are large, old females would add substantially to the population’s resilience to both environmental variability and exploitation as it has for numerous other fish species (Berkeley et al. 2004, Palumbi 2004, Law 2007, Secor 2007, Anderson et al. 2008, Venturelli et al 2010).\n\nEcological role\n\nPrior to the 1980s, the American Eel exhibited the largest range of any freshwater fish species in the western hemisphere, and held a dominant position in the fish communities by numbers and biomass in many habitats, often representing more than 50 percent of the biomass in some nearshore and riverine fresh waters (Smith and Saunders 1955, Ogden 1970), and no doubt played a dominant role in the fish community (Casselman 2003). The American Eel has been shown to be a keystone species in some freshwater fish communities. When dominant numerically or in distribution, eels can drive ecosystem processes through structuring of the fish community (Machut et al. 2007). For example, eels have substantially determined the structure of fish communities and energy flow within the habitats of the Hudson River watershed, New York (Schmidt et al. 2006).\n\nThe American Eel affects the community structure and energy flow by sequestering nutrients and transporting them upstream as it goes through its life cycle processes, thereby supplementing some stream habitats (Anderson and Schmidt 2006). For example, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MdDNR 1999) suggested that, until their decline, the American Eel in the Susquehanna River played an important role in removing excess nutrients from the watershed by using them in growth and production, and then delivering them to the ocean where the eels spawn and die. Similar observations have been made in France and western Europe, where the European Eel is a main fish species acting as a source of organic matter for freshwater systems. As such, eels serve as biotic vectors of organic matter fluxes between marine and freshwater systems and play a significant role in the functioning of these aquatic ecosystems (Lafaille et al. 2000). Eel migrations (ascending elvers and descending silver eels) have been shown to be responsible for a significant net output of carbon from the river to the sea (Lafaille et al. 2000). Lafaille et al. (2000) suggest that increasing eutrophication of freshwater systems in Europe signals a reduced relative contribution of European Eel to organic matter fluxes. Similarly, there are many freshwater systems within the historical range of the American Eel in Ontario where eutrophication is a problem (e.g., nearshore waters of Lake Ontario and many of the Kawartha Lakes; LaMP 2009, Gartner Lee Ltd. 2002). Given the significant decline of eels in Ontario and elsewhere in the St. Lawrence River watershed, the input and net export of organic carbon by this species will have been greatly reduced in recent years, thereby reducing the species' contribution to the functioning of aquatic ecosytems in these waters.\n\nBecause eels are top predators, consisting of many immigrating cohorts, and resident in Ontario for long periods of time (an average of 10 to 20 years) before emigrating back to sea, they add important stability to the nearshore fish communities of Ontario. Small yellow eels feed extensively on invertebrates and, as their size increases, they begin to feed intensively on small fish (Ogden 1970). Large yellow eels in the Ottawa River often feed extensively on crayfish (Orconectes spp.) and other invertebrates, and are frequently caught by anglers using worms as bait (K. Punt, pers. comm. 2009). Rapidly maturing eels in Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River feed heavily on pelagic Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and, to a much lesser extent, Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax), just prior to emigration (J. Casselman, unpub. data).\n\nTheir ability to occupy interstitial spaces in the rock suggests that if abundant, they could be significant predators on the young of invasive species such as Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and Rock Bass (Amblopites rupestris) (J. Casselman, unpub. data). Eels are ferocious predators. Small eels often attack food items that are larger than they are, spinning violently to dismember whatever is in their grasp (J. Casselman, pers. comm. 2009).\n\nEels are also important competitors. Large eels compete directly with other piscivores, such as bass (Micropterus spp.), Northern Pike (Esox lucius), and Walleye (Sander vitreus) that feed on similar prey items. However, this association needs to be quantified.\n\nIn addition to being predators and competitors, the American Eel is an important prey fish for Beluga Whales (Delphinapterus leucas) (Hodson et al. 1994). Further, the American Eel is known to be an important host for the mussel Elliptio complanata; the decline of this mussel in the Susquehanna River has been linked to the demise of eels in the same watershed due to blockages caused by the many dams and hydro-electric facilities constructed on this system (Blankenship 2006).\n\nThere is little doubt that eels function as an integral component of nearshore fish communities in Ontario. When dominant numerically (as eels formerly were in many parts of their historical range in Ontario), the American Eel functioned as a keystone species, structuring and adding stability to the neashore fish community (Schmidt et al. 2006, Machut et al. 2007), while coexisting harmoniously with other top predators such as walleye.\n\n1.3 Distribution, abundance and population trends\n\nEels have undergone local extirpations or substantial declines in many regions throughout their North American range (Richkus and Whalen 2000, ASFMC 2000, 2006, Casselman 2003, de Lafontaine et al. 2009a, MacGregor et al. 2009, Weeder and Uphoff 2009, Fenske et al. 2011, NatureServe 2011). Recently, the American Eel has been determined to be 'depleted' by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) for American Eel within their authority. The ASMFC has further indicated that that management efforts to reduce mortality of eels in the U.S. are warranted (ASMFC 2012 a,b).\n\nIn 2011, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) decided to evaluate listing the American Eel as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (USFWS 2011b), but to date their findings have not been made public. Legal action has recently been filed over the delay in releasing official finding (Courthouse News Service 2012).\n\nThe American Eel is known to have an exceptional ability to colonize a variety of habitats (Helfman et al. 1987, Moriarty 1987, Wiley et al. 2004). The following reconstruction of the historical range of eels in Ontario clearly demonstrates the plasticity in habitat use patterns that enabled eels to colonise a wide variety of ecosystems (Daverat et al. 2006) in the province. Until dams and hydro-electric facilities were constructed within the historical range of the species, habitats used by the species spanned vast areas of the province ranging from large riverine (e.g., Ottawa River, St. Lawrence River) and large lacustrine habitats (e.g., Lake Temiskaming, Lake Ontario), to small streams, small lakes, ponds, wetlands and damp grassy sloughs. Essentially, eels could be found anywhere within the Ottawa River, St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario watershed.\n\nThe historical range of American Eel included all accessible freshwater, estuarine and coastal marine waters of the western North Atlantic. It extended from Venezuela in the south through the Gulf of Mexico to Labrador in the north and as far inland as the headwaters of the Mississippi River (U.S.) and, in Ontario, near the extremity of their range, inland as far as Niagara Falls and the headwaters of the Ottawa River (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Geographic distribution of American Eels (modified from Tesch 1977; DFO 2010)\n\nEnlarge Figure 2. Geographic distribution of American Eels\n\nOverview of American Eel distribution in Ontario\n\nAt one time, eels accounted for more than 50 percent of the total fish biomass in many freshwater systems (Smith and Saunders 1955, Ogden 1970, Lary et al. 1998), including the nearshore waters of Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River (Casselman 2003, MacGregor et al. 2009). However in more recent times the population status of American Eel has declined substantially in many areas of its historical range.\n\nBaselines and perceptions of former abundance and distribution in Ontario have shifted over time (MacGregor et al. 2008, 2009), and the following comments of Heidenreich (1971:105) regarding the natural environment of Huronia are equally applicable within the historical range of eels in Ontario:\n\nRelicts of the original forest in Huronia are rare and tell us almost nothing of the species distribution. The same is true of drainage conditions before and after European settlement. Some of the creeks and springs present in the 17th and 18th century are gone today as well as at least four small lakes. In some cases old drainage channels have been obliterated, in other cases water has been diverted, and throughout the area swamps have been drained and the water table has dropped.\"\n\nMany watersheds have been similarly altered within the historical range of eels in Ontario, making reconstruction of their historical distribution complex. The examination and integration of ATK, archaeological information, historical records and local community knowledge has been especially important in building an understanding of the historical distribution and abundance of eels in the province.\n\nAlthough eels are at the extremity of the species' range in Ontario, they were once widely distributed, abundant and important in the province (MacGregor et al. 2009). Archaeological records show eel remains extending throughout the Lake Ontario, St. Lawrence River and Ottawa River watersheds. Fish bones in archaeological contexts are preserved in the alkaline soils found in southern Ontario, but not in the acidic soils of the Canadian Shield further north. Figure 3 shows archaeological sites in the southern part of the historical eel range where eel bones have been identified in faunal analyses. Since most archaeological sites in Ontario are not subject to faunal analyses, only a fraction of the known sites provide data on the presence of eels. The site shown on the Ottawa River is within Québec, but close to the provincial border. Some circles represent two sites in close proximity. Most sites have fewer than five eels, often only one eel.\n\nEel bones have been found at some sites that may be outside historical American Eel range, as in the Lake Simcoe watershed, where the eel may have been transported to the site by human agency. Sites on the St. Lawrence River and Ottawa River have evidence of being used as eel harvesting and/or processing sites for the transport of eels elsewhere. (Data for site locations was provided by W. A. Allen, Heritage One based on the Ontario Ministry of Culture database.)\n\nTwo archaeological sites more than 4,000 years old at the base of an Ottawa River rapids yielded substantial eel remains (Clermont and Chapdelaine 1998, Clermont et al. 2003). A complex of stone weirs and pools was documented in 2007 in the rapids just upstream from these sites (W. A. Allen, unpub. data). At this stone weir complex a ground slate tool of a style dating to at least 4,000 years of age also was recovered (W. A. Allen, unpub. data). An association between the harvesting weirs and the nearby archaeological sites is likely.\n\nThere are numerous accounts of waters of the St. Lawrence, Ottawa, Mississippi, Clyde and Mattawa Rivers shimmering in the moonlight with young eels during their upstream migration (L. McDermott, pers. comm. 2009, H. Lickers, pers. comm. 2009). These observations reflect high recruitment events into Ontario waters. Early records and ATK reveal high abundance of eels in many inland watersheds of Ontario, sufficient to support local commercial fisheries (MacGregor et al. 2009). For instance, Québec commercial eel harvests from the Ottawa River ranged from 3.4 to 15.0 metric tonnes annually between 1930 and 1937 (Dymond 1939). Commercial harvest records for the North Bay District waters of the Ottawa River show thousands of pounds of eels harvested during the period 1924 to 1938, peaking at 4,027 kg in 1932 (OMNR 1984). When and where abundance was high, the natural tendency of yellow eels to disperse randomly would have been enhanced by density-dependent drivers.\n\nFigure 3. Distribution of archaeological sites in Ontario with known Eel remains\n\nGreen circles show the Minimum Number of Individual eels (MNI) at each site. Yellow circles indicate location of sites. Green circles at sites which have extensive eel remains completely fill the yellow circle or extend beyond the circle. After Allen (2010).\n\nEnlarge Figure 3. Distribution of archaeological sites in Ontario with known Eel remains\n\nWhile waterpower development in tributary watersheds began in about 1907 at stations such as Galetta on the Mississippi watershed, the development of waterpower facilities spanning the entire mainstem of the Ottawa River began in the middle reach in 1932, with the commissioning of Chats Falls Generating Station. By the late 1940s, commercial harvests of eels in North Bay area waters of the Ottawa River had declined to less than 200 kg annually. This steep decline follows an expected and familiar time lag of 15 or more years after construction of a barrier. However, other factors such as commercial fishing would also have contributed to the steep decline by rapidly depleting the stock once recruitment to the waters was prevented by barriers. This was the likely pattern of range contraction in the province: elimination of recruitment to former habitats by barriers, followed by depletion of the remaining stock due to commercial fishing, turbine mortality, natural mortality and natural emigration during downstream spawning migrations.\n\nThe strong contraction in the range of American Eel in Ontario continued into the 2000s (Figure 4). American Eels once were abundant in all accessible tributaries of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence and Ottawa River systems and have provided sustenance, material, medicinal and spiritual uses to Aboriginal peoples for thousands of years (MacGregor et al. 2008, 2009). Where eels continue to persist in inland rivers and lakes, their abundance is now very low, and eels are approaching extirpation from all inland watersheds in Ontario. Some 25 years after construction of the Moses-Saunders Generating Station, the abundance of large eels in Lake Ontario also began to decline rapidly (Casselman 2003, MacGregor et al. 2008, 2009); eel abundance is now at extremely low levels and the fisheries have been closed for conservation reasons since 2004 (MacGregor et al. 2008). The collapse of eels in Ontario is due largely to a 99 percent reduction in recruitment (Casselman 2003, Casselman and Marcogliese 2007, MacGregor et al. 2008, 2009). On a more positive note, there has been a very small but nonetheless encouraging increase in recruitment in recent years (Pratt and Mathers 2011).\n\nFigure 4. Contraction of the distribution of American Eel in Ontario\n\nInformation used to depict the distribution of American Eel in Ontario was compiled from aboriginal traditional knowledge, local community knowledge, archaeological data and recorded captures via netting.\n\nEnlarge Figure 4. Contraction of the distribution of American Eel in Ontario\n\nOttawa River watershed\n\nReviews of historical records, as well as anecdotal, ATK and archaeological information, enabled us to piece together the historical distribution of eels in the Ottawa River watershed. This information clearly shows that eels once penetrated as far north in Ontario as Lakes Temagami and Temiskaming (some 580 km from the confluence of the Ottawa River with the St. Lawrence River), and tributaries, such as the Blanche and Montreal Rivers (Purvis 1887, Reading Eagle 1902, Barlow 1907, Livermore 1914, 1915, New Liskeard Speaker 1928, Ville de Temiskaming 1996, MacGregor et al. 2011, S. Ross, pers. comm. 2011). Here eels could be very large (Reading Eagle 1902) and appeared to be most prevalent in these waters prior to the construction of large hydro-electric dams on the mainstem of the Ottawa River, and the repair of the water control structure at the outlet of Lake Temiskaming (R. Bartlett, pers. comm. 2010, D. McLaren, pers. comm. 2011, G. VanLeeuwen, pers. comm. 2011 via G. Davies). Additionally, near the turn of the 20th century, eels still occurred in tributaries of the Montreal River (a large northern tributary of the Ottawa River) as revealed when lakes such as Kerr Lake were drained as a consequence of mining activities in Cobalt, Ontario. Many eels were observed on the mud bottom after the lake was drained (Livermore 1914, 1915, Dumaresq 2006).\n\nFurther evidence of widespread distribution in the upper Ottawa River comes from reports of eels actually traversing the height of land connecting the Ottawa and French River watersheds using damp grassy or marshland areas. By these means, or via Lake Temagami/Sturgeon River, eels appeared to disperse and enter Lake Nipissing (MacGregor et al. 2011) when they were abundant in the Ottawa River watershed. An eel was recorded as late as 1969 at Sturgeon Falls at Lake Nipissing. It was thought that its origin in Lake Nipissing was via the Mattawa River/Trout Lake system (part of the Ottawa River watershed) and then overland via lowland wet grassy areas connecting Lake Nipissing to Trout Lake (Young 1970, MacGregor et al. 2011).\n\nEels once penetrated deeply into several Algonquin Park lakes associated with the Petawawa, Madawaska and Opeongo Rivers (tributaries to the Ottawa River system) (Mandrak and Crossman 2003). The last documented eel caught in the Park was in 1936 (Mandrak and Crossman 2003); however, a few eels have been reported caught by anglers in the Petawawa River near the boundaries of Algonquin Park as recently as 2002 (K. Punt, pers. comm. 2009). Aboriginal traditional knowledge reports several generations of a Bancroft Algonquin family harvesting large and abundant eels in Salmon Trout Lake in the Madawaska subwatershed. Eels were also once abundant in the Muskrat River and Bonnechere Rivers (K. Punt, pers. comm. 2010, MacGregor et al. 2011).\n\nEels now appear to be extirpated in most of Algonquin Park (Martin and Fry 1973, Mandrak and Crossman 2003) and in the watersheds of Lakes Temiskaming and Temagami, as no verified occurrences have been reported in the last 40 to 50 years or more. However, this needs to be verified by focussed assessment.\n\nA few eels are still caught in research nets and incidentally by anglers in Lac Des Chats on the mainstem of the Ottawa River near Arnprior, Ontario (three dams up from the confluence of the Ottawa River with the St. Lawrence River), but long-time anglers from the area report very strong declines in catches (K. Punt, pers. comm. 2009). Drastic decline, and in many instances extirpation, of eels has occurred throughout tributaries of the middle and upper reaches of the Ottawa River, coinciding with the construction of hydro-electric dams (e.g., see OMNR/Québec MNRF 1999). For instance, eels have not been observed in the mainstem of the Ottawa River above Des Joachims hydro-electric facility at Rolphton for many years (OMNR 2008a, K. Punt, pers. comm. 2009). They also have not been seen in Calabogie Lake since the late 1970s when the development of waterpower production in Arnprior intensified (K. Punt, pers. comm. 2009), and now are considered extirpated from Round Lake, Golden Lake and above Renfrew Power Generation (at Renfrew) on the Bonnechere River (OMNR 2008a, K. Punt, pers. comm. 2009).\n\nThe foregoing information indicates that the American Eel used to be an integral and important component of the fish communities in the upper and middle reaches of the Ottawa River watershed. These fish communities included other top predators, such as walleye, which persist to this day, whereas the highly migratory American Eel has disappeared. If access to these reaches were restored, it is reasonable to conclude that eels would find the habitat still suitable for them, given that the less migratory species remain in these reaches. Similarly, there is no reason to doubt that suitable habitat for eels remains within Pembroke District systems (K. Punt, pers. comm. 2010, MacGregor et al. 2011), but hydro-electric facilities constructed in the early to mid-twentieth century in the Ottawa River watershed have severely limited access (i.e., three hydro-electric facilities were constructed downstream of Pembroke District on the mainstem Ottawa River during this timeframe; no other barriers have been constructed on the mainstem downstream of Pembroke District).\n\nOther (non-hydro) barriers have been constructed on some tributaries of the Ottawa River within the district, but it is the mainstem barriers that pose the initial problem to eel passage and access to district waters. Eels are now in extremely low abundance or extirpated in most waters upstream of the mainstem hydro-electric facilities, even though young eels have been observed attempting to traverse obstructions at some mainstem and tributary hydro-electric barriers near Pembroke via old log chutes and sluices (K. Punt, pers. comm. 2009). Given the substantial barriers to migration posed by the mainstem dams in the lower reaches of the Ottawa River (including the Carillon, Chaudier Falls, Chats and Chenaux), the low current abundance of eels in Pembroke waters of the Ottawa River is not surprising.\n\nAccording to local community knowledge and ATK, hydro-electric facilities pose similar barriers to eel penetration of the Bonnechere River/Round Lake watershed. There have been reports of local extirpations/drastically reduced abundance since the construction of dams associated with hydro-electric facilities within these reaches (OMNR 2008a, OMNR/Québec MNRF 1999, L. McDermott, pers. comm. 2010, 2011, W.A. Allen, pers. comm. 2010, 2011, S. Ross, pers. comm. 2011).\n\nEels were once numerous in the lower Ottawa River at places such as Chaudier Falls (Reading Eagle 1902), especially during migratory periods and still persist in these waters albeit at very low densities (MacGregor et al. 2009).\n\nMississippi River subwatershed\n\nThe Mississippi River is a large subwatershed of the Ottawa River. The American Eel was once highly abundant in this river and heavily used by Aboriginal peoples and early European settlers. By the 1980s, the species had declined to very low densities due to reduced recruitment (MacGregor et al. 2009, Casselman and Marcogliese 2009, 2010a), exacerbated by the construction of numerous hydro-electric facilities on the main stem Ottawa River and on the Mississippi River. Quantitative electrofishing in the Mississippi River in 2009 and 2010 confirmed that eels were very rare (except more prevalent at the mouth). Casselman and Marcogliese, in an unpublished review and occurrence analysis of their catch data, found that only 1.8 percent of the 112 transects sampled below High Falls produced eels and all were below the first dam at Galetta.\n\nAboriginal traditional knowledge supports this observation. For example, in the Mississippi River watershed, ATK confirms the presence, abundance and use of the American Eel above High Falls in the headwaters (Mazinaw and Crotch Lakes) up to the mid-20th century. The American Eel was reported present in Gull Lake (well upstream of High Falls) in the 1920s (OMNR 1971). The presence of eels in waters upstream of High Falls is further confirmed by observations that eels were harvested in the early 1900s from Ragged Chute on the Mississippi River (well upstream of High Falls) and shipped via the old K and P railway line to the Kingston fish market (Bennett and McCuaig 1981). Aboriginal traditional knowledge confirms that eels disappeared from these waters in the 1940s, some 20 years after construction of a large downstream hydro-electric facility at High Falls in 1920 (L. McDermott, pers. comm. 2009).\n\nAboriginal traditional knowledge further indicates that no eels have been observed above the High Falls facility since the early 1950s. Similarly, no eels have been recorded in government netting programs above High Falls since the 1950s, when Ontario began recording fisheries information in these waters. Eels continue to decline in reaches of the Mississippi River downstream of High Falls (T. Haxton, pers. comm. 2009). Extrapolation of declining trap-net catches over the past three decades in five lakes throughout the Mississippi River watershed suggests that eels have now probably disappeared from the upper half of the watershed (J. Casselman, unpub. data).\n\nIt should be noted that there are several other hydro-electric facilities on the Mississippi River downstream of High Falls that would affect eel dispersal into the Mississippi River. There is evidence that some eels have managed to find their way around the Mississippi River facilities downstream of High Falls. However, the six m tall High Falls facility is considered to be a complete impasse to further upstream migration by eels because there is no known alternate route around this barrier (Tremblay et al. 2011). As such, the High Falls barrier is considered to be the current upstream limit to eel distribution in the Mississippi River watershed. The remainder of the fish community (e.g., walleye) remains above the High Falls barrier (A. Bendig, pers. comm. 2011), so it is reasonable to conclude that suitable habitat for eels remain upstream of the High Falls facility if access was to be restored.\n\nIn recent years, intensive and extensive electrofishing surveys have been conducted in Ontario waters throughout the upper St. Lawrence River and eastern Lake Ontario, the lower Mississippi River and its watershed, and the Ontario and Quebec waters of the Ottawa River below the middle section of Lac du Rocher Fendu. The sampling, conducted at over 30 locations in the Ottawa and Mississippi river watersheds, involved a non-probabilistic index design, which provided not only local density data but also good distributional information. Casselman and Marcogliese, in a simple presence or absence occurrence analysis of their electrofishing catch data (unpublished review), examined eel distribution, assembling and combining 200-m site presence or absence data for 2009 (Casselman and Marcogliese 2010a) and 2010 (Casselman and Marcogliese 2011). These site presence or absence occurrences indicated trends that, in their professional judgment, were indicative of eel abundance throughout the lower Ottawa and Mississippi river watersheds. Below Carillon dam, 4.7 times more sites contained eels than above the dam (27.4% compared with 5.8%). This disparity was even more striking when level of effort was considered, because 4.8 times more sites were electrofished upstream of Carillon dam than below (320 compared with 69), strongly reinforcing the difference. Even though sites were not chosen randomly, electrofishing effort was intense and broadly distributed. This general summary of occurrence by site supports the present evidence of declining upstream density of eels in the Ottawa River watershed, the disproportionately greater occurrence below the first dam (which has no specifically designed facilitated passage), and the fact that eel occurrence and distribution throughout the watersheds are now at record-low levels.\n\nSt. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario watersheds\n\nIt has been recognized for many centuries that the important eel fisheries in the lower St. Lawrence River benefited, to a great degree, from eels migrating from what today would be called Ontario waters. For instance, in a 1634 Jesuit Relation (Thwaites 1896 – 1901:311, 314), the following was written regarding the eel fisheries in the St. Lawrence River in Quebec and their source from more distant northern waters:\n\nIt is wonderful how many of these fish are found in this great river, in the months of September and October, and this immediately in front of the settlement of our French…\"\n\nIt is thought that this great abundance is supplied by some lakes in the country farther north, which, discharging their waters here, makes us a present of this manna that nourishes us …\"\n\nAccounts from the mid-1600s record an Onondaga fisherman of the St. Lawrence Iroquois spearing as many as 1,000 eels in a single night (Thwaites 1896 – 1901), and there are many historical and archaeological references to the large abundance of eels in the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries. In more recent times, Elder Commanda noted that his ancestors and others have talked about eels \"creating great silver pathways in the rivers during migration times\" (Commanda, pers. comm. 2008). Indeed, prior to the turn of the 20th century, the St. Lawrence River watershed was considered to support the most productive eel fisheries in the world (The New York Times 1880). As late as the mid-1980s, eels from Ontario were still estimated to contribute 67 percent of the eels to the important commercial eel fisheries in Quebec (Verreault and Dumont 2003). Millions of silver eels were harvested from the St. Lawrence River annually in Quebec’s long-standing tidal weir fisheries (average of 431 t annually between 1970 and 1989, COSEWIC 2006)\n\nA large hydro-electric facility, Moses-Saunders Generating Station, was constructed across the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall, Ontario in 1958. Another (Beauharnois Generating Station) was constructed and commissioned in phases between 1930 and 1961, some 80 km downstream in Quebec and again spanned the entire river. While there are locks enabling shipping to continue, these two dams pose major barriers to upstream eel migration. An eel ladder was constructed on the Ontario side of the Moses-Saunders facility in 1974. The ladder was successful, passing as many as one million elvers per year in the early 1980s. Subsequently, two ladders became operational at Beauharnois in 2002 and a state of the art eel ladder was constructed in 2006 on the American side of the Moses-Saunders facility. A productive fishery remained upstream of the Moses-Saunders facility for at least 20 years after its construction. Many of the eels being harvested would have been resident prior to development. Despite assistance provided by the ladders in recent years, eel abundance in Lake Ontario eventually collapsed and the Ontario fisheries were closed in 2004-2005 (Ontario Government 2004, MacGregor et al. 2009).\n\nThe contribution of the St. Lawrence River eels to species-level fecundity has been estimated to range between 26.5 percent and 67 percent depending on the method used (COSEWIC 2006), and is considered to be substantial (CSAS 2011). Given the former abundance of eels in Ontario, the large size and fecundity of the province’s all-female population (Casselman 2003, Tremblay 2009), and the projected impact on species-level fecundity by eels from the St. Lawrence River/Lake Ontario, the weight of evidence indicates that Ontario holds a special segment of the global population that once contributed strongly to spawner biomass. Despite market prices well above the long-term mean in the 1970s to 2000s, commercial harvesting statistics indicate that eels have declined substantially from their former abundance in both Ontario (Casselman 2003, MacGregor et al. 2009) and Quebec (MacGregor et al. 2008, 2009, de Lafontaine et al. 2009a). The contribution of eels from the Ontario watersheds to the spawning stock has likely changed significantly as a consequence of their province-wide collapse.\n\nTributaries of the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario including the Gananoque (including Charleston Lake), Cataraqui (including Big Clear and Cranberry Lakes), Napanee (including Thirteen Island Lake), Salmon (including Beaver, Bull, Buck, and Kennebec Lakes), Moira (including Moira and Stoco Lakes) and the Trent-Otonabee (including Kawartha Lakes) once supported an abundance of eels (e.g., 2.1 – 11.4 tons harvested annually between 1885 and 1900) (MacGregor et al. 2009). Now eels are rarely found in any of these waters. Eels appear to have been relatively rare in the upper Trent and Otanabee Rivers/Kawartha Lakes waters since the early 1900s, coinciding with the construction of numerous dams and hydro-electric facilities (e.g., Sills Island, Sidney and Frankford Generating Stations) (MacGregor et al. 2009). While the hydro-electric facilities on the Trent River are all associated with locks that form integral components of the Trent-Severn waterway (similar to the facilities on the St. Lawrence River), it is doubtful that the locks provide adequate, safe passage for upstream or downstream migrants. Additionally, downstream migrants will follow the main flow and be subject to high cumulative turbine mortalities.\n\nThe last few reports of eels in the Kawartha Lakes region occurred in the mid-1980s. Elder Murray Whetung of Curve Lake First Nation, a carrier of ATK dating back to the 1920s in the Kawartha Lakes region, agrees with this assessment of past and present eel status in these waters (M. Whetung, pers. comm. 2009). However, eels apparently persisted much longer in waters closer to Lake Ontario. For instance, in 1980 anglers mentioned that many people were catching large eels in Round Lake on the Crowe River watershed (which flows into the lower Trent River) (C. McCauley, unpub. data) and eels continued to occur in the Moira, Salmon and Napanee Rivers until the 1970s. Moreover, annual commercial harvests of eels continued in the Cataraqui River until all commercial eel fisheries were closed in 2004. The protracted persistence of eels in the aforementioned watersheds is likely attributable to the low number of hydro-electric facilities on some of these systems (C. McCauley, pers. comm. 2009). Although there are many barriers on the Moira River, most of which were developed at one time to produce hydro-electricity, none are currently active so turbine mortality is not currently an issue in the watershed.\n\nThe total annual number of eels migrating up the ladder at Moses-Saunders Dam on the St. Lawrence River represents the longest-term data set on American Eel recruitment (Castonguay et al. 1994, Casselman et al. 1997a, Casselman 2003). After a peak in 1982 to 1983, ladder counts dropped sharply and fell to record low levels in the late 1990s (Figure 5). The few eels that ascended the ladder in the 1990s were much larger and older than typical recruits before the decline (Casselman 2003). Although recruitment has increased slightly in recent years, it still remains at minimal levels (J. Casselman, pers. comm. 2009).\n\nFigure 5. Total number of eels ascending the eel ladder(s) at the Moses-Saunders Dam, Cornwall, Ontario for 1974 – 2011\n\nEnlarge Figure 5. Total number of eels ascending the eel ladder(s) at the Moses-Saunders Dam, Cornwall, Ontario for 1974 – 2011.\n\nNo counts are available for 1996 (A. Mathers, pers. comm. 2009). Moses is on the New York side of the St. Lawrence River, and Saunders is on the Ontario side.\n\nThe number of eels ascending the ladders at Beauharnois has increased steadily in recent years, reaching a peak of almost 88,000 at the western ladder in 2008 (Figure 6). The number of eels ascending the Beauharnois ladders declined somewhat in 2011 to 65,633 (Figure 6). Once eels have traversed the ladders at Beauharnois, they enter Lake St. Francis (downstream of the Moses-Saunders Generating Station). Lake St. Francis appears to be the only remaining area in Ontario where eels are still moderately abundant (A. Mathers, pers. comm. 2010). The fact that the number of eels ascending both Beauharnois and Moses-Saunders ladders has been increasing recently (albeit still at extremely low numbers relative to the early 1980s; Figure 5) after the introduction of management actions aimed at reducing, and then eliminating eel fishing in Ontario (MacGregor et al. 2008, 2009), is cause for some optimism for the success of future recovery efforts (Ontario Government 2004).\n\nFigure 6. Total number of eels ascending the western eel ladder on Beauharnois Generating Station, St. Lawrence River, Province of Quebec (1994 – 2008)\n\nNote: counts from 1994 – 2002 represent the number of eels climbing an incomplete ladder, then captured in nets and transported above Beauharnois (after Guillemette, S. and D. Desrochers, 2011).\n\nEnlarge Figure 6. Total number of eels ascending the western eel ladder on Beauharnois Generating Station\n\nNiagara watersheds\n\nAt the westernmost extremity of American Eel range within Ontario (Niagara Area) eels were once abundant along the Lake Ontario shoreline and within the lower Niagara River. Bartram (1751:92) observed that \"Below the Falls in the holes of the rocks, are a great plenty of Eels, which the Indians and French catch with their hands without other means\". Gill (1908:121) noted that \"at the proper season you will find them [eels] by the cartloads, by millions upon millions\", and Goode (1881:83) observed that \"the visitor who enters under the sheet of water at the foot of the falls will be astonished at the enormous number of young eels crawling over the slippery rocks and squirming in the seething whirlpools\", indicating that they were clearly impeded by the falls. Eels were also plentiful within Martindale Pond and Jordan Harbour and were found in many inland watersheds of the Niagara Peninsula. While eels are now rare in these areas, the occasional eel has been captured over the last two decades in Twelve Mile Creek (MacGregor et al. 2011, A. Yagi, pers. comm. 2009).\n\nIntroductions\n\nNiagara Falls apparently is the natural limit of American Eel distribution in the Great Lakes, and the species was considered absent from Lake Erie waters prior to the opening of the Welland Canal in 1829 (Trautman 1981). Eels probably gained access to Lakes Erie, Huron and Superior through the Welland Canal (Scott and Crossman 1973), but have never been very abundant in these waters. While there are reports of some commercial harvests of eel in the upper Great Lakes as early as 1907, and Lakes Erie and St. Clair as early as 1914 (D. Coulson, pers. comm. 2010, K. Punt, pers. comm. 2010), it is unlikely that Lake Erie and the upper Great Lakes formed part of the historical range, given the formidable obstacle posed by Niagara Falls. These harvest reports could be as a result of the following.\n\nEelpouts (Lota lota) or Sea Lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) were misreported in commercial catches as American Eel.\n\nStocking eels in Lake Erie was carried out by Ohio. Trautman (1981) gives accounts of the Michigan Fish Commission stocking eels from the Hudson River into southern Michigan waters as early as 1878 and of the Ohio Fish Commission stocking eels from the Hudson River beginning in 1882. For more than a decade thereafter eels were liberated into Ohio waters. In 1887, the annual Ohio Fish Commission began to mention the capture of eels in many Ohio localities, especially in the Lake Erie drainage where the species had been formerly rare (Trautman 1981). Anecdotal information reported abundant catches in Maumee Bay and Sandusky River below dams at Fremont. These catches were reported from 1895 and 1910 (Trautman 1981).\n\nAccess was provided by the opening of the Erie and Welland canals. There are several accounts of large (three to four feet long) American Eel being captured in the lower Grand River in the mid to late 1800s well after the Grand River feeder canal was constructed in 1829 to supply water to the original Welland Canal (Dunnville District Heritage Association, pers. comm. 2012).\n\nOccurrences of American Eel in the Great Lakes above Niagara Falls (Lakes Erie, Huron and Superior) apparently are the result of stocking and/or dispersal through the Erie and Welland canals and for now should be considered as introductions outside the historical range (Scott and Crossman 1973, Trautman 1981, COSEWIC 2006). Nevertheless, given their propensity to use damp substrates to surmount obstacles, the possibility that some eels may have found access somewhere over the Niagara Escarpment to Lake Erie and were historically native to Lake Erie and the Upper Great Lakes warrants further investigation. Archaleolgical investigations of the Grand River (a major tributary to Lake Erie), have revealed eel bones but these are interpreted to have been transported by First Nations from Lake Ontario/Niagara River (G. Warrick, pers. comm. 2011). Access by possible routes identified by MacGregor et al. (2011) from the Ottawa River to Lake Nipissing and then via the French River to Lake Huron should also be investigated (see p.15). In any event, any eels above Niagara Falls would likely follow the main flow of the river and be forced to free-fall over Niagara Falls. As the height of the falls is well above the height at which they would survive, in all probability they would die from the fall (see Section 1.6: Mortality During Dowstream Migration – Free Fall). Eels in the upper Great Lakes and Lake Erie therefore would not currently nor in historical times naturally contribute to the spawning population. It is doubtful that there is sufficient flow to attract many downstream migrants into the Welland Canal, but this should be investigated.\n\nWhile eels were caught in Lake Simcoe from time to time in the mid-late 1900s, they generally were not considered native to the lake. Rather, their presence in the lake was considered to have been facilitated by the development of the Trent-Severn waterway. However, recent field checks in the Balsam Lake area, ATK and archaeological evidence suggest that eels may well have been native to Lake Simcoe (MacGregor et al. 2011). A yellow eel was found in the fall of 2010 in Lake Simcoe. If it arrived naturally, its most likely route was from the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario, upstream through the Trent/Kawartha Lakes canal system. To arrive in Lake Simcoe it would have needed to traverse a complex of more than 40 dams and locks (MacGregor et al. 2011). It appears that there were at least two low-lying marshy areas bordering the Talbot River tributary to Lake Simcoe where eels could easily have crossed watershed boundaries (namely at Corson Marsh and Grass Creek Marsh). Balsam Lake is mentioned in an ATK story published in 1914 (George 1914). There are several pre-contact archaeological villages in the Balsam Lake area but potential associations with eels have not been studied. Eel remains have been found in small numbers in an archaeological context at Lake Simcoe (B. Allen, pers. comm. 2010).\n\nSummary\n\nAlthough eels have virtually disappeared from many inland waters of Ontario, they are still present provincially, primarily in the downstream reaches of some watersheds (lower Ottawa River and its tributaries, lower Trent River, the upper St. Lawrence River, and in Lake Ontario). In all instances, densities are very low (Casselman 2003, Casselman and Marcogliese 2008, 2009, 2010a, 2010b, MacGregor et al. 2009). Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River remained the last provincial stronghold for eels into the 1980s, and the steep decline of the species in these waters since the mid-1980s has been well documented and publicized (Casselman et al. 1997b, GLFC 2002, Casselman 2003, Dekker et al. 2003, Hoag 2007, Lees 2008, MacGregor et al. 2008).\n\nThe precipitous decline of American Eel in Ontario waters is likely a significant threat to the status and recovery of the global population. Ontario’s eels, being virtually all female and the most fecund within the species' range (Casselman 2003, COSEWIC 2006, Tremblay 2009), have formed an especially critical segment of the global population. A growing conservation concern for eels has arisen in part because production from the USLR-LO system has declined to two percent of 1980s levels, and this production consisted entirely of large females whose contribution to the panmictic spawning stock is considered to have been historically significant from a biological perspective (CSAS 2011). Because of its widespread, panmictic nature, the American Eel is considered by NatureServe (2011) to be globally secure (G4) and the species has not been officially listed in the United States as threatened or endangered. However, the species is evidently declining or has been extirpated from parts of several watersheds (e.g., statewide in New Mexico; the Susquehanna River in Maryland and Pennsylvania; the James River in Virginia; most central and western parts of Texas; statewide in Arkansas) (Robison and Buchanan 1988, Chilton 1997, Richkus and Whalen 1999, MacGregor et al. 2009, Natureserve 2011), and is considered highly vulnerable by Natureserve (2011) because of its slow maturation rate and semelparous lifecycle (reproducing only once before death). Additionally, there is strong evidence of overfishing in Chesapeake Bay (Weeder and Uphoff 2009) and major declines in the Potomac River (Fenske et al. 2011). Moreover, there are indications that yellow eel abundance in the eastern United States may be at historically low levels (ASFMC 2006). Because of panmixia, local recruitment may not in some instances be related to local spawner abundance (Avise 2003, Wirth and Bernatchez 2003). However, if a particular region contributes a substantial fraction of total spawner output, then a decreased escapement from that region could affect subsequent recruitment to that region (Chaput and Cairns 2011). Because the dispersal of young eels from the Sargasso Sea can be influenced by large pulses of young eels (Casselman 2003), recovery of abundance and distribution within the distant waters of Ontario may depend significantly on improved production and enhanced density-dependent dispersal of recruits from the Sargasso Sea. This in turn will be influenced by the number of mature female eels that return safely to the Sargasso Sea and spawn successfully.\n\nDetailed mapping of American Eel occurrence in Ontario is available at the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources District level in MacGregor et al. (2011).\n\n1.4 Habitat needs\n\nEels spawn in the Sargasso Sea (Schmidt 1922), east of the Bahamas and southwest of Bermuda (25°N; 60°W; McCleave et al. 1987), but habitat requirements for spawning and incubating are poorly understood. Kleckner and McCleave (1988) related the northern limit of spawning by Atlantic eels (Anguilla spp.) in the Sargasso Sea to thermal fronts and surface water masses, with spawning taking place south of east-west thermal fronts that separate southern Sargasso Sea surface water from mixed Subtropical Convergence Zone water to the north.\n\nThe American Eel uses a broad diversity of habitats during its growth period (Helfman et al. 1987). These eels occur naturally in perhaps the broadest diversity of habitats of any fish species in the world (Helfman et al. 1987, Moriarty 1987). However, cumulative anthropogenic impacts in fresh water have severely affected their historical freshwater abundance and distribution in North America (MacGregor et al. 2009). During their oceanic migrations, eels occupy salt water, and in their continental phase, they use all salinity zones. In their continental growth phase, marine habitat use appears limited to shallow, protected waters. Survival is affected by environmental conditions in any habitat (oceanic, estuarine, freshwater) occupied during any life cycle phase. Growing eels are primarily benthic, utilizing substrate (rock, sand and mud), bottom and woody debris, and submerged vegetation for protection and cover (Scott and Crossman 1973, Tesch 1977). Vegetation (e.g., eel grass) and interstitial spaces consisting of rock piles, logs and other complex structures are important to eels as cover, particularly during daylight hours, and should be protected as habitat. Given the high abundance of eels often observed in tributaries, tributary waters seem to be a very important component of eel habitat (Machut et al. 2007). Habitat in tributaries is often of high quality and less disturbed than other areas (Machut et al. 2007).\n\nThe plasticity in habitat use patterns is a strategy that allows eels to colonize a wide variety of ecosystems at the scale of the species' geographic range, conveying a remarkable \"bet-hedging\" strategy to the species (Daverat et al. 2006) that maintains strong resilience to anthropogenic or other environmental change. However, obstacles such as dams and hydro-electric facilities constrain habitat use patterns (Cairns et al.2004, Daverat et al. 2006). The construction of dams and hydro-electric facilities in fresh water has grown significantly in Ontario over the past century, as it has in Québec and other regions of North America (Machut et al. 2007, MacGregor et al. 2009), constraining the amount and diversity of habitat available to eels. The impacts of dams and hydro-electric facilities on access to fish habitat is well documented (Hitt et al. 2012); for instance, up to 84 percent of riverine habitat in the U.S. eastern seaboard and Lake Ontario drainages are upstream of dams (Busch et al. 1998) and the situation is similar in Canada (MacGregor et al. 2009).\n\nOur reconstruction of historical distribution suggests that, for the most part, natural obstructions such as waterfalls did not pose complete impasses to upstream colonization by eels in watersheds within the historical range in Ontario, including the Ottawa River, Trent River, and the USLR-LO watersheds, with the likely exception of Niagara Falls. Anthropogenic barriers, on the other hand, occur throughout eel habitat in Ontario; where they occur, these barriers can be complete obstacles to upstream migration and dispersal of eels unless other routes around the structures are available (Tremblay et al. 2011). The ability of eels to overcome obstacles is size-dependent. Small eels (<10 cm long) can creep up damp vertical barriers (Legault 1988), but larger eels generally cannot bypass dams or large waterfalls (McCleave 1980, Barbin and Krueger 1994). Hence, larger eels attempting to move upstream require unobstructed passage or eel ladders (Moriarty 1987). Connectivity among important inland habitats is important to ensure eels are able to disperse effectively and take advantage of the diverse growth and maturing aquatic habitats in the province, thereby strengthening resilience in the sub-population. Additionally, safe and adequate passage to and from the oceanic spawning grounds is required to complete the life cycle.\n\nIn fresh water, eels are predominantly sedentary (Feunteun et al. 2003). Otoliths, or ear stones, can provide a chemical environmental history for eels. Casselman (1982) analyzed strontium/calcium ratios in eel otoliths to document migratory history – ocean life, immigration into the St. Lawrence River, and residency in Lake Ontario. Recent investigations using otolith microchemistry (Jessop et al. 2002, Cairns et al. 2004, Thibault et al. 2005) report three main movement patterns related to coastal waters: (1) saltwater residency; (2) freshwater residency; and (3) inter-habitat shifting. In the St. Jean River on the Gaspé Peninsula, some freshwater resident eels exhibit nomadic behaviour, performing very short intrusions into brackish or salt water (Daverat et al. 2006). Otolith chemistry has shown that some eels spend their entire life cycle in the ocean, making it clear that not all eels exhibit catadromous life history strategies and that catdromy in eels is facultative (Tsukamoto et al. 1998, Jessop et al. 2002, Morrisonet al. 2003, Arai et al. 2004). However, the proportion of non-catadromous eels remains un-quantified.\n\nTemperate anguillids are well known for their phenotypic plasticity of habitat use in fresh water (Helfman 1987, Daverat et al. 2006). At large spatial scales, American Eel occurrence does not appear to be strongly related to habitat features (Smogor et al. 1995) and eels are frequently reported as habitat generalists (Bain et al. 1988, Daverat et al. 2006) in freshwater. However, there is a need for more specific information on habitat use at finer scales of resolution. At broad geographic scales, eels generally do not show consistent preferences for habitat type, cover, substrate, water temperature, or density of predators (Hawkins 1995, Smogor et al. 1995), but eel densities are influenced by water depth and velocity (Wiley et al. 2004). However, more is being learned of micro-habitat use by eels from smaller scale studies, and the importance of riparian areas is becoming well known (Machut et al. 2007). For instance, the importance of riparian habitat to species of eels is well documented. Riparian areas provide important sources of allochthonous prey (e.g., terrestrial insects). They are sources of deciduous leaf litter that provide very critical cover for eels seasonally, and riparian embankments that are undercut or overhung with riparian growth and in-stream debris provide critical cover and resting habitat for many anguillids and other fish species in freshwater systems (Merrick and Schmida 1984, Hicks 1997, Glova et al. 1998, Glova 2002, Pusey and Arthington 2003, Baxter et al. 2005, Machut et al. 2007).\n\nLocal seasonal movements by eels may also be driven by changing water temperature, oxygen concentration and water quality. Winter habitat requirements are poorly understood (Tesch 1977, Feunteun et al. 2003). Eels in small tributaries such as the Bonnechere River have been observed moving downstream in the fall from hard clay bottoms to areas in the lower reaches with mud or silt bottoms where eels are known to overwinter by burrowing into the mud (K. Punt, pers. comm. 2009).\n\nYellow eels tend to occupy home ranges in fresh water (Morrison and Secor 2003), and their normal scope of activity is within a relatively restricted area (LaBar and Facey 1983). However, some American Eels have been shown to make seasonal migrations in spring and fall, establishing home ranges in summer. Some eels may inhabit thermal refuge areas in winter (Hammond and Welsh 2009).\n\nFinally, it is important to note that ATK, local community knowledge, archaeological information, historical records and scientific papers all document the remarkable and regular behaviour of large and small eels leaving the water and moving considerable distances along damp substrates such as moss, grass, rocks and cement. Large and small migrating eels often have been found in gardens and wriggling through wet grass alongside many migratory corridors, including the Ottawa River and St. Lawrence River (Meek 1916, Haro et al. 2000, H. Lickers, pers. comm. 2009, K. Punt, pers. comm. 2009), further emphasizing the importance of riparian areas to eels.\n\nHabitat use by eels appears to be extremely diverse and access to a diverse array of habitats is fundamental to the resilience of eels in future environmental or other anthropogenic changes (Secor 2007, 2010, Secor and Kerr 2009, MacGregor et al. 2009). In addition, there may be important micro-habitat requirements that have not been considered. For example, eels typically overwinter in soft substrates where they burrow into the upper layers of sediment (Jessop et al. 2009). These wintering grounds may be quite specific and need to be located and evaluated in Ontario waters where eels are still present.\n\n1.5 Limiting factors\n\nPanmixia and global population changes\n\nAccording to current science, the American Eel consists of a single genetic population in which all individuals of the species mate randomly at the same spawning site in the Sargasso Sea. As a result, factors (biological, ecological and anthropogenic) outside the range of the eel in Ontario have the potential to limit recovery within Ontario. Some 25 jurisdictions have management responsibilities for American Eel in North America (MacGregor et al. 2008). Hence, the conservation and management of American Eel will require bi-national and inter-jurisdictional cooperation (MacGregor et al. 2008, 2009, Velez-Espino and Koops 2009). However, because Ontario supports a very important sub-population of eels having high reproductive value, Ontario actions alone can significantly affect the status of eels in Ontario regardless of their panmictic nature. If a particular region contributes a substantial fraction of total spawner output, then decreased escapement from that region could affect subsequent recruitment to that region (Chaput and Cairns 2011). Of course, panmixia also means that Ontario eels will benefit as a result of global conservation efforts. Moreover, because of the high reproductive value of the USLR-LO sub-population in Ontario, New York and Quebec, actions in Ontario may negatively or positively affect recruitment to other jurisdictions.\n\nBecause eels are panmictic and dispersal of young eels to Ontario waters is somewhat density-dependent, a decline in the global population of American Eel (especially spawners) could lead to reduced density of young eels and hence reduced dispersal of young recruits to Ontario at the extremity of the range where declining recruitment has been most noticeable (Casselman 2003).\n\nLarval dispersal\n\nLeptocephali are not very mobile for a period of time and somewhat dependent at this life history stage on ocean currents for their dispersal from the Sargasso Sea to continental waters. The potential effects of ocean currents on recruitment have been described by Friedland et al. (2007), Bonhommeau et al. (2008) and Miller et al. (2009). However, other factors such as fishing mortality may disrupt the ability of spawners to reach the Sargasso Sea and must be considered as possible contributors to recruitment declines (Miller et al. 2009). Anguillid eel populations can likely survive wide ranging changes in oceanic and continental environmental conditions, considering that Atlantic eel species have survived extreme conditions such as ice ages since their evolution millions of years ago (Miller et al. 2009).\n\n1.6 Threats to survival and recovery\n\nSeveral threats need to be addressed to achieve recovery of eels in Ontario. The impact of each of these threats on eels has not yet been fully quantified in all watersheds. A model developed to examine the cumulative effects of anthropogenic mortality on eels found that fishing, followed by turbine mortality, were significant factors affecting eels, and that eels were sensitive to the effects of habitat exclusion by dams (Reid and Meisenheimer 2001).\n\nMoreover, declining abundance of female spawners is cause for widespread concern. For instance, female spawner escapement is estimated to have decreased from the Potomoc River in the U.S. by 94 percent between 1980 and 2008 (Fenske et al. 2011). Spawning stock biomass may have decreased in American Eel to levels that impair recruitment (ASFMC 2000, de Lafontaine et al. 2009a), and recently the ASFMC has declared the status of American Eel in its jurisdictions as depleted (ASFMC 2012 a,b,c). Inadequate attention to the spawning population is a common shortcoming in fisheries management (Walters and Maguire 1996, MacGregor et al. 2009). The loss of spawners is a key threat – many of the threats described below describe causes of the decline in the spawning population.\n\nHarvesting\n\nThroughout its range, all continental life stages of the American Eel are harvested. To date, there has been no coordinated attempt to establish a total allowable catch for the North American \"stock\" as a whole that would be sustainable. Ontario established quotas for eels in the 1980s but they were never achieved largely because the stock was declining so rapidly. Aboriginal peoples have a long association with the species and have harvested eels for millennia, as exemplified by archaeological evidence from Morrison and Allumette Islands in the Ottawa River (Clermont and Chapdelaine 1998, Clermont et al. 2003).\n\nThe effects of commercial fishing have been much more severe than Aboriginal fishing, both globally and within the province. Commercial harvest records cover more than a century for the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario. The total North American harvest increased from an average of 1,215 tons annually between 1950 and 1955 to an unprecedented peak of 2,915 tons in 1978 (Casselman and Marcogliese 2007). This increase in harvest was largely driven by significant increases in market and price for eels (Casselman and Marcogliese 2007, MacGregor et al. 2009). By the early 1990s, North American harvests began to decline. By 2004, eel harvests fell rapidly to 840.4 tons. This decline occurred despite sustained high prices, well above the long-term mean (Casselman and Marcogliese 2007). Overall trends in Ontario commercial harvests parallel those of Canada and the United States (MacGregor et al. 2009).\n\nBetween 1950 and 2003, Ontario commercial eel harvests averaged 80.1 metric tonnes, but rose substantially in the 1970s to an unprecedented 228.2 metric tonnes (Casselman and Marcogliese 2007), representing 20 percent of the total Canadian harvest. Ontario harvests plummeted thereafter. As harvests rose rapidly, concerns arose over the sustainability of mortalities due to fishing and turbines (Kolenosky and Hendry 1982). In 1980, an experimental quota of 270 metric tonnes was implemented for Ontario’s portion of the USLR-LO (Kolenosky and Hendry 1982). This was a quota that was set when harvests were at record-high levels.
