        "text": "Decision soon on listing eels under Endangered Species Act\n\nFishermen benefiting from booming prices for American eels are squirming about a decision expected this month on whether to list the fish under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nResearchers go with the flow to help protect endangered European eel\n\nNew research led by the University of Southampton is paving the way to protect the endangered European eel as they migrate through rivers to the ocean.\n\nGenetic analysis of the American eel helps explain its decline\n\nThe American eel has been a concern for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service since 2007, when it was first considered for, but failed to receive, Endangered Species Act protection. The numbers of these slender, slimy, ancient ...\n\nElectric eels deliver Taser-like shocks\n\nThe electric eel - the scaleless Amazonian fish that can deliver an electrical jolt strong enough to knock down a full-grown horse - possesses an electroshock system uncannily similar to a Taser.\n\nEvolutionary constraints revealed in diversity of fish skulls\n\nIn the aquatic environment, suction feeding is far more common than biting as a way to capture prey. A new study shows that the evolution of biting behavior in eels led to a remarkable diversification of skull shapes, indicating ...\n\nJapan, neighbors agree to moves to protect eels\n\n(Japan has agreed to cut purchases of eel fry from neighboring East Asian countries by 20 percent as part of moves to protect the endangered species.\n\nFish as good as chimpanzees at choosing the best partner for a task\n\nCoral trout are fast when chasing prey above the reefs of their habitat, but can't pursue their quarry if it buries itself into a hard-to-reach reef crevice.\n\nThe shocking truth about electric fish: Sequencing electric eel genome\n\nWriting June 27, 2014 in the journal Science, a team of researchers led by Michael Sussman of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Harold Zakon of the University of Texas at Austin and Manoj Samanta of the Systemix Institute ...\n\nEel expedition 2014 has arrived in The Sargasso Sea\n\nThe research vessel Dana is currently in the Sargasso Sea on an intensive research expedition to the European eel's spawning grounds subsequently following the eel larvae's drift back to Europe. The Sargasso Sea is a large ..."
