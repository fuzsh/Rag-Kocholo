Eels undergo considerable development from the early larval stage to the eventual adult stage, and most are predators.\n\nThe term \"eel\" is also used for some other eel-shaped fish, such as electric eels (genus Electrophorus), spiny eels (family Mastacembelidae), and deep-sea spiny eels (family Notacanthidae). These other clades, however, evolved their eel-like shapes independently from the true eels.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeveral species of eels appeared in the series.\n\nA yellow-edged moray was shown in \"Swimming\"."
