        "meta_description": "The Indo-Pacific snake eel genus Neenchelys is a small group of moderately to extremely elongated fishes (family Ophichthidae), which comprises seven nominal species previously. Intensive collections on this group have led to the findings of taxonomic problems, as well as new taxa. This study is aimed to review the group on the basis of all known specimens, to verify the species, and to describe the new species. Six valid species are recognized: Neenchelys microtretus Bamber from the Suez, Red Sea; N. buitendijki Weber and de Beaufort from Indonesia, Bombay, India, and Malaysia; N. cheni (Chen and Weng), a senior synonym of N. retropinna Smith and Böhlke, from Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia, and the Gulf of Oman; N. daedalus McCosker from Papua New Guinea; N. parvipectoralis Chu, Wu and Jin from the South China Sea off Taiwan and Vietnam; and N. mccoskeri Hibino, Ho and Kimura from Japan and Taiwan. Three new species - N. diaphora sp. nov., N. pelagica sp. nov., and N. similis sp. nov. - are described from Taiwan and Japan. These new species differ from the congeners in body proportions, meristics, and morphology. A lectotype for N. buitendijki is designated. Totally, nine species are recognized in Neenchelys, including three new species, with most species showing range extension in the Indo-west Pacific region. Diagnosis, detailed morphometric and meristic data, and ecological note for each species are provided. New diagnostic characters are used for recognizing the species, with a key to the species of Neenchelys provided. The recent discovery of new Asian species suggests that more remain to be discovered.",

        "text": "Measurements are straight line, made either with a 300-mm ruler with 0.5-mm gradations (for total length (TL), trunk length, and tail length) and recorded to the nearest 0.5 mm, or with dial calipers (all other measurements) and recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm. Body length comprises the head (HL) and trunk lengths. The HL was measured from the snout tip to the posterodorsal margin of the gill opening, the trunk length was taken from the end of the head to the mid-anus, and the maximum body depth did not include the median fins. The head pore terminology followed that of McCosker et al. (1989: 257) in that the supraorbital pores are expressed as the ethmoidal pore + pores in the supraorbital canal, e.g., 1 + 4, and the infraorbital pores are expressed as pores along the upper jaw + those in the vertical part of the canal behind the eye (‘postorbital pores’), e.g., 4 + 2, in that the last pore included along the upper jaw is frequently part of the postorbital series.\n\nVertebral counts (which include the hypural) were taken from radiographs. The mean vertebral formula (MVF) is expressed as the average of the predorsal, preanal, and total vertebrae (Böhlke 1989). All specimens examined in this study were preserved in formaldehyde and then transferred to ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol. Specimens examined in this study are deposited at the Australian Museum, Sydney, Australia (AMS); Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, PA, USA (ANSP); Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China (ASIZB); Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan (ASIZP); Natural History Museum, London, UK (BMNH); Fisheries Research Laboratory, Mie University, Mie, Japan (FRLM); California Academy of Sciences, California, USA (CAS); National Science Museum, Tokyo, Japan (NSMT-P); Pisces Collection, National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMB-P); Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai, China (formerly Shanghai Fishery College; SFC); Laboratory of Aquatic Ecology, Department of Aquaculture, National Taiwan Ocean University (TOU-AE); Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History, Washington D.C., USA (USNM); and Zoölogisch Museum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (ZMA). Institutional abbreviations follow Fricke and Eschmeyer (2013, online version).\n\nSystematics\n\nNeenchelys Bamber 1915\n\nSynonymy: Neenchelys Bamber 1915: 479 (type species: Neenchelys microtretus Bamber 1915, by monotypy); Mohamed Mohamed 1958: 511; McCosker 1977: 60; McCosker 1982: 62; McCosker et al. 1989: 270; Smith and McCosker 1999: 1663.\n\nDiagnosis: Ophichthid eels, subfamily Myrophinae, tribe Myrophini ( sensu McCosker 1977) with the following characteristics: body robust to extremely elongate, cylindrical anteriorly, and somewhat laterally compressed posteriorly; head and trunk shorter than tail; dorsal fin origin variable, from anterior trunk region to slightly behind level of anus; pectoral fin variable in size, from minute to moderately developed; snout broad, tumid, overhanging lower jaw; lips without barbels; anterior nostril tubular, posterior nostril an elongate slit in upper lip beneath lower margin of orbit; gill opening round and constricted; cephalic pores developed, one or two preopercular pores (usually two, except for N. parvipectoralis); teeth small, conical, mostly uniserial on jaws and vomer; coloration uniform although slightly darker dorsally, median fins often black-edged posteriorly.\n\nDistribution and ecological notes: Members of Neenchelys can be found in the Indo-west Pacific region from the Red Sea east to Papua New Guinea, north to Japan, and south to western Australia. As stated above, some species of Neenchelys are remarkable in that they are known or suspected to live in midwater as adults. All but three (Benthenchelys spp.) of the more than 260 other known species of ophichthids (McCosker 2014) are fossorial and burrow in sand, gravel, or muddy substrates.\n\nRemarks: On the basis of a 185-mm specimen, Bamber (1915) created the family Neenchelidae and a new genus and species. The family was subsequently included within the Ophichthidae (Böhlke 1960; Nelson 1966,1967). Species of Neenchelys are most closely related to those of the New World genus Pseudomyrophis. Previous researchers (including Gareth J. Nelson and the late James E. Böhlke) suggested that the two genera might be synonymous; however, based on trenchant differences displayed by the leptocephali, Leiby (1984) strongly advised that the genera are valid. We concur with this.\n\nThere are now nine known species; however, the recent discovery of four new Asian species suggests that more remain to be discovered.\n\nEtymology: From the Greek neo (new) and enchelys (eel). Treated as feminine according to Opinion 915 of the Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature (1970).\n\nNeenchelys buitendijki Weber and de Beaufort 1916\n\nCommon name: Fintail serpent eel\n\n(Figure 1 A,B,C,D and Tables 1 and 2)\n\nSynonymy: Neenchelys buitendijki Weber and de Beaufort 1916: 268, Figure one hundred sixteen (type localities: Bay of Batavia, Java, and probably Moluccas, Indonesia); Mohamed 1958; Ho et al. 2012: 949.\n\nMaterial examined: Syntype (herein designated to be the lectotype): ZMA.102.171 (218 mm TL), ‘Moluccas, Indonesia’. Non-types: Malaysia: NMMB-P13649 (239 mm), offshore, 04°49′30.42″N, 100°29′11.76″E, Matang, small otter trawl, 6 October 2009; NMMB-P13650 (198 mm), mudflat, Matang, 04°51′1.26″N, 100°31′10.8″E, small otter trawl, 3 m, 1 December 2009; NMMB-P13651 (211 mm), offshore, 04°49′54.18″N, 100°29′37.38″E, Matang, small otter trawl, 3.3 m, 16 January 2010; NMMB-P13652 (225 mm), mudflat, 04°50′53.64″N, 100°30′49.32″E, Matang, small otter trawl, 1.9 m, 16 January 2010; NMMB-P13653 (192 mm), mudflat, Matang, 04°50′48.48″N, 100°31′31.74″E, 2.1 m, small otter trawl, 3 August 2010; Univ. of Malaya uncat. (2, 170 to 209 mm), Malaysia, no other data.\n\nDiagnosis: A species of Neenchelys distinguished by having a combination of the following characters: a robust body, its depth 19 to 32 times in TL; HL 7.8 to 8.5 in TL; snout pointed; pectoral fin well developed, longer than snout, 4.0 to 4.8 in HL; origin of dorsal fin relatively forward, 0.4 to 0.5 times HL behind gill opening; predorsal length 5.7 to 6.0 in TL; gill opening large, its height 6.8 to 8.5 in HL; teeth conical, slender, uniserial in jaws and vomer; total vertebrae 135 to 148; MVF 19-50-140. Single median temporal and interorbital pores; supraorbital pores 1 + 4; infraorbital pores 5 + 1 (1 or 2 pores between anterior and posterior nostrils); mandibular pores 7; preopercular pores 2; supratemporal pores 3. Cephalic lateral line pores 13 or 14; predorsal pores 20 to 22; preanal pores 51 to 54. Coloration in preserved specimens pale brown dorsally and paler ventrally, with black posterior portions of dorsal and anal fins.\n\nDistribution and ecological notes: Known from the type material, captured in Indonesia, from Bombay, India (Mohamed 1958), and from a shallow-water (<5 m) mudflat at the bottom of a river mouth at Matang, western Malaysia (Ho et al. 2012).\n\nRemarks: This species has received little attention since its original description which was based on a 129-mm specimen from Java and another (218 mm) ‘most probably from the Moluccas.’ Their designation of a holotype is not clear. We herein recognize the larger syntype, ZMA.102.171 (218 mm TL), as the lectotype of N. buitendijki. Mohamed (1958) reported on 15 specimens (58.5 to 273 mm TL) collected along with shrimp at 8 to 10 fathoms (15 to 18 m) from Bombay. Nelson (1966) extensively analyzed the osteology of specimens from Bombay and referred the species of Neenchelys to the subfamily Echelinae (=Myrophinae) of the Ophichthidae. Neenchelys buitendijki is most similar to N. parvipectoralis and N. microtretus in having a relatively short and stout body. It differs from them by having a pointed snout and well-developed pectoral fin. Mohamed (1958) gave 145 to 148 total vertebrae for his Indian specimens. However, all seven specimens we examined from Malaysia have slightly fewer total vertebrae, at only 135 to 140. The difference may be attributable to geographic variation. More specimens from other localities in the Indo-west Pacific region are needed to understand the geographic variation of this species.\n\nNeenchelys cheni(Chen and Weng 1967)\n\nCommon name: Chen's worm eel\n\n(Figure 2A,B,C,D and Tables 1 and 2)\n\nSynonymy: Myrophis cheni Chen and Weng 1967: 39, Figure twenty-nine (type locality: Tungkang, Taiwan); Chen 2007:13. ‘Neenchelys’cheni (Chen and Weng 1967): Ho et al. 2010: 24 (designation of lectotype). Neenchelys retropinna Smith and Böhlke 1983: 80, Figure one to three (type locality: Gulf of Oman). Paxton et al. 1989: 119; McCosker and Chen 2000: 356 (first record from Taiwan).\n\nMaterial examined: Types: Myrophis cheni: Lectotype: NMMB-P3019, formerly THUP 3234 (350 mm), Tungkang Fishing Port, SW Taiwan, May 1966. Paralectotype: NMMB-P1534, formerly THUP 3328 (335 mm), Tungkang Fishing Port, SW Taiwan, September 1966. Neenchelys retropinna: holotype: ANSP 131512 (320 mm), ANTON BRUUN cruise 4-B, sta. 256-A, Gulf of Oman, 26°10′N, 57°02′E, 55 to 64 m, bottom trawl, 30 November 1963. Paratypes: ANSP 131513 (sex indeterminate, 289 mm), same data as for ANSP 131512; AMS I. 21847–017 (sex indeterminate, 305 mm), Arafura Sea, Australia, 10°02′S, 133°58′E, R/V SOELA, bottom trawl, 80 to 84 m, 17 November 1980.\n\nNon-types: NMMB-P1535 (324 mm), Tungkang Fishing Port, SW Taiwan, 21 March 1979. NSYSU 3683 (386 mm), SW Taiwan, 22°32′N, 120°07′E, 50 to 100 m; TOU-AE 2850 (342 mm), Changbin, Taitung, E Taiwan, 31 July 2006, coll. M.-L. Chiou; TOU-AE 3535 (399 mm), Changbin, Taitung, E Taiwan, 8 February 2007, coll. M.-L. Chiou; NMMB-P12485 (376 mm), NMMB-P12486 (335 mm), NMMB-P12487 (338 mm), Da Nang, Vietnam, 9 April 2011; NMMB-P12491 (5, 381 to 414 mm), Da Nang, Vietnam, 11 April 2011; NMMB-P12503 (3, 367 to 389 mm), NMMB-P12505 (335 mm), Da Nang, Vietnam, 9 April 2011.\n\nDiagnosis: A species of Neenchelys distinguished by having a combination of the following characters: body moderately elongate and relatively compressed, depth at anus 3.3 to 5.2 times in HL, 29 to 40 in TL; HL 10.1 to 11.6 in TL; origin of dorsal fin relatively posterior, at about same vertical level as or slightly posterior to origin of anal fin, predorsal length 2.4 to 2.7 in TL; tail length 1.6 to 1.7 in TL; pectoral fin moderate in size, shorter than snout length, 7.0 to 7.8 in HL; snout relatively long, 4.1 to 5.2 in HL; total vertebrae 180 to 183; MVF 59-56-181. Single median temporal and interorbital pores; supraorbital pores 1 + 4 or 1 + 5; infraorbital pores 5 + 1 or 5 + 2 (2 pores between anterior and posterior nostrils); mandibular pores 5 or 6; preopercular pores 2; supratemporal pores 3. Cephalic lateral line pores 10 to 12; predorsal pores 57 to 64; preanal pores 52 to 67. Coloration in preservative pale brown, slightly darker dorsally, fins pale except median fins which darken approximately one head length before the tail tip.\n\nDistribution and ecological notes: Known from southern Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia (Paxton et al. 1989), and the Gulf of Oman (Smith and Böhlke 1983). In Taiwan, most specimens were collected by midwater trawl together with many mesopelagic fishes, suggesting that adults have a pelagic lifestyle. However, the type series of N. retropinna came from bottom trawls.\n\nRemarks: The type specimens of M. cheni were rediscovered by Ho et al. (2010). They redescribed the two specimens, selected a lectotype, and referred the species to Neenchelys. They further stated that ‘N. retropinna and “N.”cheni are very likely conspecific.’ Our examination of additional specimens supports their actions.\n\nSmith and Böhlke (1983) mentioned that the maxillary teeth are uniserial in the type series of N. retropinna. However, there is one short outer row of smaller teeth along the posterior portion of the maxillary in the type series of N. cheni and in all Vietnamese specimens. It is notable that NSYSU 3683 has more complicated intermaxillary and vomerine dentition. There is one extra curved row of small teeth before the anterior intermaxillary tooth and many more teeth occupying the anterior palate, followed by two irregular series of vomerine teeth which gradually become uniserial posteriorly. That specimen is neither large nor small, and we are unable to assign significance to its dental condition.\n\nNumbers of predorsal and preanal pores showed a higher variation than those of other species, especially the preanal pores (52 to 67). Based on our observations, the position of the dorsal fin origin is variable, slightly before or behind the anus, which the number of predorsal pores is highly related to. Although large variations of these two lateral line counts are atypical for ophichthids, our data suggest that N. cheni might have a larger variation of the preanal pore number than its congeners.\n\nNeenchelys daedalus McCosker 1982\n\nCommon name: New Guinea worm eel\n\n(Figure 3A,B,C,D and Tables 1 and 2)\n\nSynonymy: Neenchelys daedalus McCosker 1982: 63, Figure four (type locality: Astrolabe Bay, Papua New Guinea).\n\nMaterial examined: Holotype: AMS I. 19690–012 (342 mm), Astrolabe Bay, Madang, Papua New Guinea (05°24′S, 145°52.5′E). Paratype: CAS 50708 (272 mm), collected with holotype.\n\nDiagnosis: A species of Neenchelys distinguished by having a combination of the following characters: body elongate and relatively compressed, its depth 46 to 52 times in TL; origin of dorsal fin at about midtrunk, 1.0 to 1.1 in HL behind gill opening; predorsal length 6.5 to 6.9 in TL; head 13 to 15 in TL, trunk 5.1 to 5.3 in TL; tail 1.3 to 1.8 in TL; pectoral fin elongate, nearly as long as upper jaw; teeth slender, conical, uniserial throughout; coloration uniformly tan, except belly which is dark brown to black, fins colorless; vertebrae 225 to 235, MVF 31-58-230. Single median temporal and interorbital pores; supraorbital pores 1 + 4; infraorbital pores; 5 + 1 (2 pores between anterior and posterior nostrils); mandibular pores 5; preopercular pores 2; supratemporal pores 3. Body coloration in isopropyl alcohol uniformly tan, except belly which is dark brown to black; fins colorless.\n\nDistribution and ecological notes: Known only from the type material, collected from Papua New Guinea by midwater trawl at 0 to 256 m over a ‘rough peak > 500 fms [914 m] bottom’ at 18:50 to 21:00.\n\nRemarks: This species has not been correctly reported since its original description. It and species of Benthenchelys and perhaps two other congeners described herein are the only ophichthids known to occupy the midwater realm as adults.\n\nThe original description of N. daedalus mentioned 11 other Pacific specimens from Papua New Guinea and the Banda Sea that were collected in midwater but differed in having more vertebrae. They were tentatively identified as N. daedalus; however, McCosker (1982: 65) treated them as non-paratypes and stated ‘they are all smaller specimens and appear identical in proportions to the new species. They differ considerably, however, in total vertebral numbers: the holotype and paratype have 235 and 225, respectively, whereas eight of the others had 251–274 (mean = 266.8) vertebrae. I am unable to account for such a large mean vertebral difference and broad range in vertebral number for conspecifics in such close geographical proximity, and therefore have not made them type-specimens.’ We now recognize that these belong to a new species, Neenchelys similis sp. nov., which is described in this revision.\n\nNeenchelys diaphora sp. nov.\n\nCommon name: Longfin worm eel\n\n(Figure 4A,B,C,D,E and Tables 1 and 2)\n\nHolotype: NMMB-P17563 (475 mm), a ripe female, Tungkang Fishing Port, SW Taiwan, northern South China Sea, otter trawl, 25 November 2011.\n\nParatype: NMMB-P16304 (430 mm), a ripe female, Tungkang Fishing Port, SW Taiwan, northern South China Sea, otter trawl, 19 March 2012, coll. H.–C. Ho; NMMB-P17553 (264 mm), sex indeterminate, Tungkang Fishing Port, SW Taiwan, northern South China Sea, otter trawl, 9 November 2012, coll. H.–C. Ho.\n\nEtymology: From the Greek diaphoros, meaning different. Initially, the holotype was recognized as being closely similar to Neenchelys pelagica sp. nov. described below. With the newly collected specimens, we were able to confirm its differentiation and describe it as a new species.\n\nDiagnosis: A species of Neenchelys distinguished in having a combination of the following characters: body relatively cylindrical, 2.8 to 3.3times in HL, 28 to 35 in TL; dorsalfin origin at midpoint of trunk, 1.2 to 1.5times in HL behind gill opening; predorsal length 4.4 to 4.6 in TL; HL 9.9 to 10.8 in TL; tail 1.5 to 1.6 in TL; pectoral fin well developed and relatively large, 3.7 to 4.0 in HL; total vertebrae 177 to 186; MVF 35-54-181. Cephalic lateral line pores 13 to 15; predorsal pores 35 to 38; preanal pores 56 to 59.\n\nDescription: Morphometric and meristic data are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The following proportions are given for the holotype, followed by values of the paratypes in parentheses. In TL: HL 9.9 (9.9 to 10.8); predorsal length 4.4 (4.4 to 4.6); trunk length 4.0 (3.8 to 4.2); preanal length 2.8 (2.8 to 3.0); tail length 1.5 (1.5 to 1.6). In HL: pectoral fin length 3.7 (3.7 to 4.0); snout length 5.2 (5.2 to 5.3); eye diameter 15.2 (14.8 to 16.3); upper jaw length 3.4 (3.2 to 3.4); interorbital width 7.3 (6.9 to 7.5); gill opening height 8.0 (8.0 to 11.3); body depth at gill opening 2.8 (2.8 to 3.3); body depth at anus 2.6 (2.0 to 3.1); body width at anus 3.0 (2.7 to 3.7).\n\nBody moderately elongate; somewhat cylindrical with tail gradually compressed posteriorly; depth of body relatively uniform, tapering gradually to tail tip; depth of head subequal to that of body. Tail moderately long, anus at anterior 1/3 of body length. Dorsal and anal fins low and fleshy, continuous with a small but distinct rayed caudal fin; origin of dorsal fin about one HL before a vertical through origin of anal fin. Pectoral fin relatively well developed, broad at base, and pointed posteriorly.\n\nHead profile terete; snout acute anteriorly, tip of snout projecting well beyond lower jaw. Anterior nostril tubular, directed anteroventrally, its tube distinctly notched dorsally. Posterior nostril in front of lower margin of eye, opening directed ventrally, appearing in lateral aspect as a diagonal slit, the posterior end of which is highest. Behind and below nostril and parallel to it with a groove that is longer than nasal slit. Snout broad and tumid, housing an extensive nasal organ on either side. Lower jaw included, its tip reaching a line between anterior margins of anterior nostrils. Angle of gape about one eye diameter behind a vertical through posterior margin of pigmented eyeball. Tongue not free, well attached to mouth floor. Gill opening a narrow vertical slit, situated at anteroventral corner of pectoral fin base.\n\nHead pores small (Figure 4B), single median temporal and interorbital pores. Supraorbital pores 1 + 4; infraorbital pores 5 + 1 (2 pores between anterior and posterior nostrils). Mandibular pores 6; preopercular pores 2; supratemporal pores 3.\n\nTeeth slender (Figure 4C,D,E), pointed, tips directed posteriorly, anteriormost one in each series longest. Intermaxillary teeth 5 (3 to 5), well separated from that of vomer; vomerine teeth uniserial, with 1 (1 or 2) pair of side teeth between second and third (or first and second) teeth, terminating posteriorly before end of maxillary tooth row (Figure 4C; about same level in 430-mm paratype, Figure 4D); maxillary uniserial (two irregular rows in 430-mm paratype, Figure 4D), with 12 (10 to 12) teeth, terminating posteriorly at gape; dentary with 23 to 25 (21 to 25) uniserial teeth, its end terminating at that of opposite maxillary tooth row.\n\nLateral line incomplete, pores small and inconspicuous, extending to about one HL before caudal fin. Cephalic lateral line pores 15 (13 to 15), predorsal pores 36 (35 to 38), and preanal pores 56 (56 to 59).\n\nColoration when fresh uniformly brownish gray with posterior end of dorsal and anal fin margins edged black; in preservative gray to light brown, with posterior end of dorsal and anal fins edged black.\n\nDistribution and ecological notes: Known from the type series collected from SW Taiwan, the northern portion of the South China Sea. Specimens were collected together with N. parvipectoralis and N. mccoskeri, indicating that this species may have a benthic lifestyle and probably feeds on benthic fishes and/or invertebrates.\n\nRemarks: Neenchelys diaphora sp. nov. is most similar to N. pelagica sp. nov. described below in having a similar appearance and proportional measurements. It differs from N. pelagica sp. nov. by having a total of 177 to 186 vertebrae (n = 4) (vs. 169; n = 3), a relatively large gill opening (8.8% to 12.6% vs. 6.6% to 7.9% HL); six mandibular pores (vs. seven); and a benthic (vs. pelagic) life style. It is also similar to those species with well-developed pectoral fins, i.e., N. cheni, N. daedalus, and N. buitendijki. It differs from N. cheni by the dorsal fin origin being situated at the midpoint of the trunk (vs. above the anus), a larger pectoral fin, and an MVF of 35-54-181 (vs. 59-56-181). It differs from N. daedalus by having a relatively stouter body (body depth 28 to 35 vs. 46 to 52 in TL), an MVF of 35-54-181 (vs. 31-58-230), and different body proportions (see Table 1). It differs from N. buitendijki by having a relatively rounded snout (vs. pointed), an MVF of 35-54-181 (vs. 19-50-140), and different body proportions (see Table 1). Neenchelys diaphora sp. nov. is also similar to N. mccoskeri in general appearance but differs in having a well-developed pectoral fin (vs. a minute pectoral fin) and an MVF of 35-54-181 (vs. 37-65-179).\n\nNeenchelys mccoskeri Hibino, Ho and Kimura 2012\n\nCommon name: McCosker's worm eel\n\n(Figure 5A,B,C,D and Tables 1 and 2)\n\nSynonymy: Neenchelys mccoskeri Hibino, Ho and Kimura 2012: 343, Figures one to three (type locality: Tungkang Fishing Port, SW Taiwan).\n\nMaterial examined: Holotype: NMMB-P 15557 (512 mm), male, Tungkang Fishing Port, SW Taiwan, 28 February 2011, bottom trawl, collected by H.–C.

Single median temporal and interorbital pores; supraorbital pores 1 + 4; infraorbital pores 5 + 1 (2 pores between anterior and posterior nostrils); mandibular pores 6 or 7 (mainly 6); preopercular pores 1 or 2 (mainly 1); supratemporal pores 3. Cephalic lateral line pores 12 to 14; predorsal pores 19 to 24; preanal pores 53 to 59. Coloration uniformly pinkish yellow when fresh, creamy white when preserved, posterior margins of median fins blackened.\n\nDistribution and ecological notes: Known from southern coasts of China and southern Taiwan. Specimens were recently collected from Vietnam off Nha Trang, Da Nang, and the Mekong River mouth area (the latter according to 11 April 2011 correspondence from K. Shibukawa, Nagao Natural Environment Foundation, Tokyo, Japan). The localities and method of capture suggest that this species is demersal, inhabiting depths of <300 m. A 237-mm specimen (NMMB-P2912) with fully ripe eggs suggests that this is a small species. The largest specimen examined was 328 mm TL.\n\nRemarks: This species was only known from the holotype collected from Pingtan Island, China, until Ho et al. (2010: 29) redescribed it on the basis of six specimens from Taiwan. Additional specimens were collected in southern Taiwan and Vietnam by bottom trawling at 100 to 300 m in depth. The first author also examined three specimens (SFC 11619, SFC 7-4978-1, and SFC 14031) labeled as paratypes of N. parvipectoralis. The original description (Chu et al. 1981) was stated to be based on a single specimen; however, we presume that the authors examined these three additional specimens, which were also not treated as types by Chu et al. (1981).\n\nAs stated earlier in this paper, we were unable to differentiate between N. parvipectoralis and N. microtretus. The vertebral difference between the two species (N. microtretus 151 vs. N. parvipectoralis 138 to 148) is minor but might be significant. The only known specimen of N. microtretus from the Red Sea has a vertebral count beyond the range of Asian specimens of N. parvipectoralis. Considering the frequency of endemism in the Red Sea, we think this may be significant. The holotype of N. microtretus is a small, damaged specimen. Because these two taxa come from such disparate locations, we await adequate material of both species before a determination can be made.\n\nNeenchelys pelagica sp. nov.\n\nCommon name: Pelagic worm eel\n\n(Figure 8A,B,C,D and Tables 3 and 4)\n\nHolotype: NMMB-P15556 (392 mm), a ripe female, Tungkang Fishing Port, SW Taiwan, northern South China Sea, midwater shrimp trawl, 10 September 2009, coll.

Tail moderately long, anus at first 1/3 of body length. Dorsal and anal fins low and fleshy, continuous with a small but distinctly rayed caudal fin; origin of dorsal fin about one HL before a vertical through origin of anal fin.

Specimens were collected together with several mesopelagic fishes (myctophids, nemichthyids, nettastomatids, and Harpadon spp.), indicating that this species, like N. daedalus, may have a mesopelagic lifestyle and probably feeds on mesopelagic fishes and/or invertebrates.\n\nRemarks: Neenchelys pelagica sp. nov. is most similar to N. diaphora sp. nov. described above. For a detailed comparison, see that of N. diaphora sp. nov. Neenchelys pelagica sp. nov. is also similar to N. cheni, N. daedalus, and N. buitendijki in having a well-developed pectoral fin. It differs from N. cheni by the dorsal fin origin being situated at midtrunk (vs. about above the anus), a larger pectoral fin, and an MVF of 33-53-169 (vs. 59-56-181). It differs from N. daedalus by having a more robust body (body depth 28 to 34 in TL vs. 46 to 52 in TL), an MVF of 33-53-169 (vs. 31-58-230), and different body proportions (see Tables 1 and 3). It differs from N. buitendijki by having a relatively rounded snout (vs. pointed), an MVF of 33-53-169 (vs. 19-50-140), and different body proportions (see Tables 1 and 3).\n\nNeenchelys similis sp. nov.\n\nCommon name: Slender worm eel\n\n(Figure 9A,B,C,D and Tables 3 and 4)\n\nSynonymy: Neenchelys daedalus (non McCosker): McCosker 1982: 65 (non-types); Machida and Ohta 1993: 391 (description, Japan); Nakabo 2002: 217 (illustrated key, Japan); Chen 2007: 16 (description, Taiwan).\n\nHolotype: ASIZP 59925, 677 mm, female with immature eggs, Tashi Fishing Port, Ilan, NE Taiwan, bottom trawl, 20 March 1998, coll.

Specimens were subsequently reported from Japan (Machida and Ohta 1993) and Taiwan (Chen 2007); we describe them as this new species. It is notable that the non-types have a wider range of total vertebrae than those of type series (251 to 274 vs. 260 to 265). It may provide a broader range of the total vertebrae when more specimens are available.\n\nAfter this paper was accepted, before going in press, Mr. Y. Hibino (personal communication, 23 June 2013) of Mie University kindly informed the senior author the presence of two specimens of N. similis sp. nov. collected from Mie, Japan. The senior author examined the photos and the morphological and meristic data of these two specimens which agree well with those of type series. These two specimens were recognized as additional paratypes of N. similis sp. nov., and these data were combined into the text and tables.\n\nA key to species of Neenchelys\n\n1A.
