        "text": "The Elopomorpha (eels and relatives) is a morphologically diverse group of predominantly marine teleost fishes comprising about 1000 species placed in 25 families. It is one of the three major living teleost lineages along with the Osteoglossomorpha and Clupeocephala. Among a few morphological synapomorphies that have been offered as evidence for the monophyly of the Elopomorpha, the remarkable leptocephalus larvae stand out. Several studies aiming at reconstructing the elopomorph phylogeny using morphological or molecular characters led to inconsistent results. In this study, we have tested previous hypotheses regarding inter- and intra-relationships of the Elopomorpha using a multi-locus dataset composed of three nuclear and three mitochondrial genes. Our analyses were based on likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction methods using different character-weighting data matrices and gene partition schemes to assess reliability of our findings. Our results confirm the respective monophyly of the Elopomorpha, Osteoglossomorpha and Clupeocephala. The majority of our analyses identify the Elopomorpha as the sister group of a clade containing the rest of the Teleostei. Within the Elopomorpha, the Elopiformes is the sister group of the remaining taxa. The Albuliformes sensuForey et al. (1996) and the Notacanthiformes are never sister-taxa in our phylogenetic trees, in contradiction with the recent mitogenomic hypothesis and current classification. Our results place the Notacanthiformes as the sister group of the Anguilliformes, including Saccopharyngiformes. Among anguilliforms, the families Congridae and Muraenesocidae are not monophyletic. The recently discovered anguilliform \"living fossil\" family Protanguillidae is not the sister group of the remaining Anguilliformes, instead, the sister group of the Synaphobranchidae. Based on the results presented here, we propose a revised classification for the Elopomorpha, comprised of four orders, including a resurrected Notacanthiformes but surrendering the Saccopharyngiformes. Within Anguilliformes, we recognized four monophyletic suborders named Protanguilloidei, Muraenoidei, Anguilloidei, and Congroidei."
