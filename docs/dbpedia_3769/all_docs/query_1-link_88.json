        "text": "2. Introdution  Marine biology is the scientific study of organisms in the ocean or other marine bodies of water. Given that in biology many phyla, families and genera have some species that live in thesea and others that live on land, marine biology classifies species based on the environmentrather than on taxonomy. Marine biology differs from marine ecology as marine ecology is focused on how organisms interact with each other and the environment, while biology is the study of the organisms themselves\n\n3. Sea creatures  Sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, andpectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays. However, the term \"shark\" has also been used for extinct members of the subclassElasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha, such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus, as well as other Chondrichthyessuch as the holocephalid eugenedontidans. Under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago.[1] Acanthodians are often referred to as \"spiny sharks\"; though they are not part of Chondrichthyes proper, they are a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole .\n\n4. Types of sea animals Starfish or sea stars are star- shaped echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. Common usage frequently finds these names being also applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly referred to as brittle stars or \"basket stars\". About 1,500 species of starfish occur on the seabed in all the world's oceans, from the tropics to frigid polar waters. They are found from the intertidal zone down to abyssal depths, 6,000 m (20,000 ft) below the surface.\n\n5. Turtle Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines (or Chelonii[3]) characterised by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield.[4] \"Turtle\" may refer to the order as a whole (American English) or to fresh-water and sea-dwelling testudines (British English).[5] The order Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species\n\n6. Porcupine fish  Porcupinefish are fish belonging to the family Diodontidae (order Tetraodontiformes), also commonly called blowfishand, sometimes, balloonfish and globefish. They are sometimes collectively called pufferfish,[2] not to be confused with the morphologically similar and closely related Tetraodontidae, which are more commonly given this name.  Porcupinefish are medium- to large-sized fish, and are found in shallow temperate and tropical seas worldwide\n\n7. Eel fish  An eel is any fish belonging to the order Anguilliformes (/æŋˌɡwɪlᵻˈfɔːrmiːz/), which consists of four suborders, 20families, 111 genera and about 800 species. Most eels are predators. The term \"eel\" (originally referring to theEuropean eel) is also used for some other similarly shaped fish, such as electric eels and spiny eels, but these are not members of the Anguilliformes order."
