        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe order Anguilliformes, as treated here, comprises 20 families with about 820 species in four suborders: Anguilloidei, Congroidei, Muraenoidei and Saccopharyngoidei (Wiley & Johnson 2010, Tang & Fielitz 2013). Nelson et al. (2016) recognised 19 families with about 938 species. Nelson (2006) followed Robins (1989) in placing members of the Saccopharyngoidei in their own order, whereas morphological analyses of Forey et al. (1996) and molecular analyses of Inoue et al. (2004) placed the saccopharyngoids within the Anguilliformes. Johnson et al. (2011) described a new monotypic family, genus and species of true eel with a definite caudal fin. The species is considered to be the most primitive living member of the Anguilliformes. Tang & Fielitz (2013) provided a molecular phylogeny of the family Muraenidae with a revised classification of true eels. Nelson et al (2016) recognised 8 suborders based on molecular studies including that of Santini et al (2013).\n\nTrue eels live in a variety of diverse habitats from fresh water and shallow coastal waters, to bathypelagic waters and the abyssal plains of the deep sea. Species have continuous dorsal, caudal and anal fins are continuous, and lack pelvic fins. All have a unique ribbon-like leptocephalus larva, a feature shared with the Albuliformes, Elopiformes and Notacanthiformes. Adults and larvae of several species are discussed in BÃ¶hlke (1989)."
