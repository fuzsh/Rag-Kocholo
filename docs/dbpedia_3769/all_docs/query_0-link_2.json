        "text": "US government clamps down on eel poaching as value grows\n\nChanges in the worldwide fisheries industry have turned live baby American eels into a commodity that can fetch more than $2,000 a pound at the dock, but the big demand and big prices have spawned a black market that wildlife ...\n\nWith magnetic map, young eels catch a 'free ride' to Europe\n\nEach year, young European eels make their way from breeding grounds in the Sargasso Sea to coastal and freshwater habitats from North Africa to Scandinavia, where they live for several years before returning to the Sargasso ...\n\nStudy shows European eel migration not as uniform and simple as thought\n\n(Phys.org)—A team of researchers from across Europe has found that European eels do not spawn in the Sargasso Sea as a single reproductive cohort in the spring—instead, they found that some of the eels take much longer ...\n\nElectric eels make leaping attacks\n\nIn a legendary account the famous 19th century explorer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt recounted a dramatic battle between horses and electric eels that he witnessed on a field trip to the Amazon. In the following ...\n\nNew research dispels myth that European Eels are trapped in the Mediterranean\n\nEels have been tracked more than 2000km from lagoons of the Mediterranean Sea and into the Atlantic Ocean, announced an international team of scientists today. This world first discovery brings to an end a long running debate ...\n\nStress from noise can be short-lived\n\nUnderwater noise can negatively impact anti-predator behaviour in endangered eels and increase stress in both eels and European seabass, a new study published in Royal Society Open Science confirms.\n\nElectric eels curl up to deliver even more powerful shocks\n\nThe electric eel may be one of the most remarkable predators in the entire animal kingdom. That is the conclusion of Kenneth Catania, Stevenson Professor of Biological Sciences at Vanderbilt University, who has spent the ...\n\n100-year-old mystery solved: Adult eel observed for the first time in the Sargasso Sea\n\nAfter more than a century of speculation, researchers have finally proved that American eels really do migrate to the Sargasso Sea to reproduce. A team supervised by Professor Julian Dodson of Université Laval and Martin ...\n\nElectric eels found to use jolt also for electrolocation\n\n(Phys.org)—Kenneth Catania, a biological scientist with Vanderbilt University, has found evidence that suggests that electric eels use their electrical powers to both stun prey and to find them. In his paper published in ..."
