        "text": "\"I'm an entertainer in the military-entertainment complex.\" -- Bruce Sterling\n\nPolemicist, provocateur, futurist, 'visionary in residence', Bruce Sterling has been out there, personally sharpening the cutting edge of science fiction for more than thirty years.\n\nFrom his first story \"Man-Made Self\" in 1976 to his latest \"Kiosk\" in 2007, Sterling has written science fiction that is fast-moving, sharply extrapolated, technologically literate, and as brilliant and coherent as a laser, as he himself once said of William Gibson. His \"Shaper/Mechanist\" stories were an essential part of the cyberpunk movement of the '80s, just as his \"Leggy Starlitz\" and \"Chattanooga\" stories wrangled the near future of the '90s better than anyone else. Whether writing about the deep future in Schismatrix or the deep present in Holy Fire, he has developed into the best science fiction writer working in the world today.\n\nBorn in Texas in 1954, Sterling has traveled the globe writing and working for The New York Times, Nature, Wired, Newsday, and a number of industrial design magazines. His short fiction has appeared in almost every major publication in the science fiction field. His novels include far future adventures Involution Ocean and The Artificial Kid, Schismatrix, John W. Campbell Memorial Award winner Islands in the Net, The Difference Engine, Heavy Weather, Holy Fire, Distraction, and The Zenith Angle.\n\nLimited: 125 signed numbered hardcover copies\n\n=Trade Hardcover Edition: fully cloth bound hardcover edition\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nIntroduction by Karen Joy Fowler\n\nForeword by Bruce Sterling\n\nPart I: The Sharper/Mechanist Stories\n\nSwarm\n\nSpider Rose\n\nCicada Queen\n\nSunken Gardens\n\nTwenty Evocations\n\nPart II: Early Science Fiction and Fantasy\n\nGreen Days in Brunei\n\nDinner in Audoghast\n\nThe Compassionate, the Digital\n\nFlowers of Edo\n\nThe Little Magic Shop\n\nOur Neural Cherynobyl\n\nWe See Things Differently\n\nDori Bangs\n\nPart III: The Leggy Starlitz Stories\n\nHollywood Kremlin\n\nAre You for 86?\n\nThe Littlest Jackal\n\nPart IV: The Chattanooga Stories\n\nDeep Eddy\n\nBicycle Repairman\n\nTaklamakan\n\nPart V: Later Science Fiction and Fantasy\n\nThe Sword of Damocles\n\nManeki Neko\n\nIn Paradise\n\nThe Blemmye's Strategem\n\nKiosk\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly (starred review):\n\n\"Sterling (Visionary in Residence: Stories), the godfather of cyberpunk, demonstrates his full range, from far future to forgotten past, in this well-stocked career-spanning collection of his finest SF pieces. His blend of uncompromising realism and irrepressible optimism shows up wherever his protagonists do... Readers who like a hard-eyed view of the future combined with a wry wink at the past, with a few inventive postmodern narrative kicks mixed in, will be greatly rewarded.\"\n\nFrom Booklist:\n\n\"Sterling's speculative fiction dazzles from the get-go, bombarding the reader with one extraordinary concept after another...This significant retrospective of Sterling's career reveals a prescience that is bold and astounding.\""
