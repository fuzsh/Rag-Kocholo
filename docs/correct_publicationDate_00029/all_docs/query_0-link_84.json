        "text": "American science fiction writer, born in Brownsville, Texas, educated at the University of Texas. He is one of the better-known advocates of Cyberpunk (see Gibson, William) which he sees as the only form of science fiction capable of confronting the near future; he edited Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology ( ). Some of his later works, such as Schismatrix ( ), Islands in the Net ( ), and the stories collected in Crystal Express ( ), demonstrate his sense that the future will comprise an ineradicable complexity of networks from computer webs to shared identities. Heavy Weather ( ) deals with environmental catastrophes in the next century."
