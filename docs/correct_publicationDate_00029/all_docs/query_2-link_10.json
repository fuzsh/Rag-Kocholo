His work is from the non-fiction, paranormal romance, and science fiction genres.\n\n“Islands in the Net” is a stand alone novel that was released in the year 1988. Laura Webster is currently on the fast track to success. She is a bright young star in a multinational conglomerate, and living well in a post-millennial age of prosperity, peace, and profit.\n\nIn an age of advanced tech, information is the most precious commodity in the entire world. Information truly is power. Data is locked up in computers and carefully rationed out through a global communications network. Full access is now a privilege held by very few.\n\nNow, Laura Webster is going to be plunged into this netherworld of black-market data pirates, high-tech voodoo, new-age mercenaries, and murder.\n\n“The Caryatids” is a stand alone novel that was released in the year 2009. The world in 2060 has been divided in three spheres of influence, with each one battling with the others over the resources of the fallen nations and the environment has come close to degrading to the point of no return. There is the Dispensation, centered in the city of Los Angeles, where capitalism and entertainment have fused with the highest of high-tech. There’s Acquis, a Green-centered collective which uses invasive neurological tech to create this networked utopia. There’s also China, the sole surviving nation-state, which is a dinosaur that has been able to prosper only by pitilessly pruning its own population.\n\nThe products of this monstrous world, the daughters of a monstrous mom, and monsters themselves (at least, according to some) are the Caryatids. These are the four surviving female clones of one crazy Balkan genius and wanted war criminal who is no protected, beyond extradition, on the orbiting space station.\n\nRadmilla is a Dispensation star that is determined to forget all about her past and build an impregnable and glittering future for herself. Sonja works as a medical specialist in China and is renowned for selflessly risking her own life for to help others. Vera is an Acquis functionary dedicated to reclaim their homeland, which is the Croatian Island of Mljet, from the catastrophic pollution. Then there is Biserka, who is a one woman terrorist network. These four ‘sisters’ are united just by their hatred for their ‘mom’. And for one another.\n\nWhen there is evidence of a looming environmental catastrophe, the Dispensation sends out its best statesman, or salesman, named John Montgomery Montalban, Radmilla’s husband, and lover to both Sonja and Vera. This is in order to gather the Caryatids together in quite the audacious effort to save the world.\n\n“Love is Strange” is a stand alone novel that was released in the year 2012. They are futurists and in love. They do not believe in romantic happy endings whatsoever. Farfalla Corrado is a globetrotting Italian witch, and has been trained to do Brazilian voodoo. Farfalla is able to tell real fortunes, speak real curses, see some real ghosts. Farfalla does not just know about the future, she is able to actually feel it in the twisted and dark depths of her heart.\n\nGavin Tremaine, a high-tech Seattle venture capitalist, is also able to forecast the future, spot the trends, and invest in many different business models. Gavin’s got a huge future ahead of him. Unfortunately, he knows what that big future holds for all of the little people.\n\nTheir worlds collide, and history starts crumbling. They know already just how this love story is certain to end. And it is not what the other one expects it to be.\n\n“Pirate Utopia” is a stand alone novel that was released in the year 2016. Who are these bold rebels that pillage their European neighbors in revolution? The Futurists! Utopian pirate warriors of the diminutive Regency of Carnaro, scourge of the Adriatic Sea. Mortal enemies of capitalists, communists, and even fascists (to whom are entirely unsympathetic with).\n\nThese ambitious Soldier-Citizens of Carnaro are being led by a passionate and brilliant coterie of the possibly insane. Lorenzo Secondari, who is an engineering genius, a World War One veteran, and a leader of Croatian raiders. The Ace of Hearts, who is a spymaster, a dashing Milanese aristocrat, and tactical savant. Frau Piffer, who is a Syndicalist manufacturer of torpedoes at the factory ran for and by women. Then there is the Prophet, who is a seductive warrior-poet that leads via military ruthlessness and free love.\n\nJust off of a worldwide demonstration of their powers, will the Futurists engage the help of American traitors and establish their global domination?"
