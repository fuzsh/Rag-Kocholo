        "text": "This page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia (view authors).\n\nMichael Bruce Sterling is an American science fiction author, best known for his novels and his seminal work on the Mirrorshades anthology, which defined the cyberpunk genre. In 2003 he was appointed Professor at the European Graduate School where he is teaching Summer Intensive Courses on media and design. In 2005, he became \"visionary in residence\" at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.\n\nWritings[]\n\nSterling is, along with William Gibson, Tom Maddox, Rudy Rucker, John Shirley, Lewis Shiner, and Pat Cadigan, one of the founders of the cyberpunk movement in science fiction, as well as its chief ideological promulgator, and one whose polemics on the topic earned him the nickname \"Chairman Bruce\". He was also one of the first organizers of the Turkey City Writer's Workshop, and is a frequent attendee at the Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop. He won Hugo Awards for the novelette \"Bicycle Repairman\" and the novella \"Taklamakan\".\n\nHis first novel, Involution Ocean, published in 1977, features the world Nullaqua where all the atmosphere is contained in a single, miles-deep crater; the story concerns a ship sailing on the ocean of dust at the bottom, which hunts creatures called dustwhales that live beneath the surface. It is partially a science-fictional pastiche of Moby-Dick by Herman Melville.\n\nIn the late 1970s onwards, Sterling wrote a series of stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe: the solar system is colonised, with two major warring factions. The Mechanists use a great deal of computer-based mechanical technologies; the Shapers do genetic engineering on a massive scale. The situation is complicated by the eventual contact with alien civilizations; humanity eventually splits into many subspecies, with the implication that many of these effectively vanish from the galaxy, reminiscent of The Singularity in the works of Vernor Vinge. The Shaper/Mechanist stories can be found in the collection Crystal Express and the collection Schismatrix Plus, which contains the original novel Schismatrix and all of the stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe.\n\nIn the 1980s, Sterling edited a series of science fiction newsletters called Cheap Truth, under the alias of Vincent Omniaveritas. He wrote a column called Catscan, for the now-defunct science fiction critical magazine, SF Eye.\n\nHe has been the instigator of two projects which can be found on the Web:\n\nThe Dead Media Project - A collection of \"research notes\" on dead media technologies, from Incan quipus, through Victorian phenakistoscopes, to the departed video game and home computers of the 1980s. The Project's homepage, including Sterling's original Dead Media Manifesto can be found at http://www.deadmedia.org\n\nThe Viridian Design Movement - his attempt to create a \"green\" design movement focused on high-tech, stylish, and ecologically sound design.[1] The Viridian Design home page, including Sterling's Viridian Manifesto and all of his Viridian Notes, is managed by Jon Lebkowsky at http://www.viridiandesign.org. The Viridian Movement helped to spawn the popular \"bright green\" environmental weblog Worldchanging. WorldChanging contributors include many of the original members of the Viridian \"curia\".\n\nSterling has a habit of coining and popularizing neologisms to describe things which he believes will be common in the future, especially items which already exist in limited numbers.\n\nIn the December 2005 issue of Wired magazine, Sterling coined the term buckyjunk. Buckyjunk refers to future, difficult-to-recycle consumer waste made of carbon nanotubes (aka buckytubes, based on buckyballs or buckminsterfullerene).\n\nIn December 1999 he coined the term Wexelblat disaster, for a disaster caused when a natural disaster triggers a secondary, and more damaging, failure of human technology.\n\nIn August 2004 he coined the term Spime, for a type of technological device that, through pervasive RFID and GPS tracking, can track its history of use and interact with the world.\n\nIn the speech where he offered \"Spime\", he noted that the term \"blobject\", with which he is sometimes credited, was passed on to him by industrial designer Karim Rashid. The term may originally have been coined by Steven Skov Holt.\n\nBibliography[]\n\nNovels\n\nInvolution Ocean (1977) - A science fiction version of Moby-Dick, set in a deep crater filled with dust instead of water, featuring an impossible romance between the protagonist and an alien woman.\n\nThe Artificial Kid (1980) - A novel about a young street fighter who continuously films himself using remote controlled cameras.\n\nSchismatrix (1985) - The 23rd century solar system is divided among two human factions: the \"Shapers\" who are employing genetics and psychology, and the \"Mechanists\" who use computers and body prosthetics.
