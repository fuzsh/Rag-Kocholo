        "text": "Neuromancer\n\nBy William Gibson,\n\nFrom my list on sci-fi fantasy crime stories that will blow your mind.\n\nBy Kaeleb LD Appleby Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nThe sci-fi/fantasy/crime genre is probably one I’ve known the least about, and I only really started to dive down the rabbit hole when I began writing my series. I’m glad I did. The world-building and lore that is woven into this genre truly sets it apart from the usual stuff. On top of needing an intricate technological imagination that has some grounding in the real world, these kinds of books also need to have characters that are believable and a narrative that is not so futuristic that it strains credulity. It’s a tough mix to get right, but when I find a story that nails these aspects it really immerses me into the world and narrative like nothing else.\n\nKaeleb's book list on sci-fi fantasy crime stories that will blow your mind\n\nWhy did Kaeleb love this book?\n\nI enjoy this book because it essentially serves as a link between the older 60s post-modernist dystopian science fiction and the more contemporary, technology-driven, emotionally burdened weariness that has characterised authors since the 80s.\n\nThis book was outstanding; I found it impossible to stop reading. Gibson masterfully crafts an edge and tension that permeates the entire story, gripping the reader and refusing to let go.\n\nArguably, Neuromancer not only defined its genre but also left a noticeable imprint on literature and film ever since.\n\nBy William Gibson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n10 authors picked Neuromancer as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe book that defined the cyberpunk movement, inspiring everything from The Matrix to Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nThe sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.\n\nWilliam Gibson revolutionised science fiction in his 1984 debut Neuromancer. The writer who gave us the matrix and coined the term 'cyberspace' produced a first novel that won the Hugo, Nebula and Philip K. Dick Awards, and lit the fuse on the Cyberpunk movement.\n\nMore than three decades later, Gibson's text is as stylish as ever, his noir narrative still glitters like chrome in the shadows and his depictions of…\n\nPreview\n\nSnow Crash\n\nBy Neal Stephenson,\n\nFrom my list on real-life time machines through sci fi.\n\nBy Jools Cantor Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nScience fiction lets us readers escape into space or travel through time, but I believe it is most effective when grounded in our primal anxieties. Classics like Nineteen Eighty-Four and The Handmaid’s Tale resonate because the dark futures they describe drive us to prevent their prophecy. These stories give us a window into the world that birthed them by crystalizing the authors' fears into a work of fiction. When I read each book on this list, they transported me to the time they were written. En route, they showed how much our world has changed and how much we humans haven’t.\n\nJools' book list on real-life time machines through sci fi\n\nWhy did Jools love this book?\n\nOut of the Cold War and into the Metaverse, this was published in 1992 and captures the infancy of the Information Age we live in. More so than the other novels on the list, this story is fun, on top of being wildly creative and smart.\n\nWhether it’s riffing on anarcho-capitalist enclaves run by franchisee governments, the pathology of language and ancient Babylonian grammar, or the ups and downs of being the world’s best swordsman online but a pizza delivery driver for the mafia in real life, the story exudes a manic energy and levity brought on by the dawn of a new era.\n\nIt is both cyberpunk and mocking cyberpunk. It is juvenile and jaded. It is absurd and prophetic. If you’re not having enough fun in 1992’s actual future, pick up Snow Crash and enjoy the ride.\n\nBy Neal Stephenson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n13 authors picked Snow Crash as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe “brilliantly realized” (The New York Times Book Review) breakthrough novel from visionary author Neal Stephenson, a modern classic that predicted the metaverse and inspired generations of Silicon Valley innovators\n\nHiro lives in a Los Angeles where franchises line the freeway as far as the eye can see. The only relief from the sea of logos is within the autonomous city-states, where law-abiding citizens don’t dare leave their mansions.\n\nHiro delivers pizza to the mansions for a living, defending his pies from marauders when necessary with a matched set of samurai swords.

Clark Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAlthough I write Fantasy, I’m a Cyberpunk enthusiast who mentally lives in the high-tech effed-up future authors and artists imagined in the ‘80s. My imagination has been so influenced by Cyberpunk since I watched (and eventually read) Akira as a kid that I ended up creating a Fantasy world with a retro-futuristic, low-life/high-tech vibe, and a lot of motorcycles. An awful lot. I’m also a rebel by heart and a queer person, hence my stories always feature a fight against society and LGBTQ+ characters. I like reading about dystopias, morally grey characters, and dark content. This is what I read, and this is what I write about.\n\nFreddie's book list on cyberpunk hackers, cyborgs, and dystopian societies\n\nWhy did Freddie love this book?\n\nAkira is a must-read manga masterpiece, a deep analysis of government corruption, political upheaval, criminality, and decay of society. Apart from the breathtaking art, what caught my attention was the complex story and the nihilistic, harsh, and hopeless world Akira shows. There are virtually no good characters in this story and it fits the apocalyptic, decadent reality they face and live. Expect a lot of psychic abilities and motorcycles, along with gritty, graphic violence.\n\nBy Katsuhiro Otomo,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Akira, Volume 1 as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAkira 1 introduces readers to a gritty Neo-Tokyo, built on the ashes of a Tokyo annihilated by a blast of unknown origin that triggered World War III. The lives of two streetwise teenage friends, Tetsuo and Kaneda, change forever when paranormal abilities begin to waken in Tetsuo, making him a target for a shadowy agency that will stop at nothing to prevent another catastrophe like the one that levelled Tokyo. At the core of the agency's motivation is a raw, all-consuming fear of an unthinkable, monstrous power known only as Akira.\n\nPreview\n\nMindplayers\n\nBy Pat Cadigan,\n\nFrom my list on cyberpunk hackers, cyborgs, and dystopian societies.\n\nBy Freddie A.

This is what I read, and this is what I write about.\n\nFreddie's book list on cyberpunk hackers, cyborgs, and dystopian societies\n\nWhy did Freddie love this book?\n\nPat Cadigan is one of my favourite authors. Mindplayers is a short book, bizarre and strange but fascinating as per Cadigan’s style. The main setting here is the human mind. The protagonist is forced to become a Mindplayer, a sort of state-controlled psychologist who jacks into people’s minds in order to cure them. This book makes you wonder how vast the world inside your head is, and if your thoughts and memories really belong to you once a government takes control of them. There’s even Brain Police involved, what can be more dystopian than this?\n\nBy Pat Cadigan,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Mindplayers as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAllie Haas only did it for a dare - the kind of dare you know is a mistake but you do it anyway because it's Mistake Yime. But putting on the madcap that Jerry Wirerammer has 'borrowed' was a very big mistake. The psychosis itself was quite conventional, a few paranoid delusions, but it didn't go away when she took the madcap off. Jerry did the decent thing and left her at an emergency room for dry-cleaning but then the Brain Police took over. Straightened out by a professional mindplayer, Allie thinks she's left mind games behind for good but…\n\nPreview\n\nInto Neon\n\nBy Matthew A. Goodwin,\n\nWhy did Austin love this book?\n\nMatthew and I were on an author panel in the past. I’m all into supporting fellow authors, especially those in a similar sub-genre.\n\nIn this story, the orphaned protagonist, Moss, has finally found his place in the world with his employer. But everything is turned upside down when a mysterious woman breaks into his apartment and hands him a data chip from his dead parents.

Here, he meets a rebel group intent on exposing their corrupt oppressors, including his old boss, who now wants him dead.\n\nBy Matthew A. Goodwin,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Into Neon as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhen a corporate lacky discovers a terrible secret that exposes his illusions, will his hidden fire dwindle or ignite a rebellion?\n\nOrphaned and alone, Moss is happy to have found a place in the world.

I loved the raw indie art by Ziritt, feels like a classic tattoo artist took his inks and drew inside comic panels. He frames a lot of statuesque and memorable moments with his violent, dystopian characters.\n\nAs an indie artist and writer, it’s awesome to see another indie story. Indie at its core is unfiltered, which is what makes it great. It isn’t watered down to hit the right tone to sell a lot of copies. It’s the creator’s voice being heard.\n\nI suggest that you read this one…\n\nBy Dave Baker,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Night Hunters as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNight Hunters is a pulsing cyberpunk classic that tells the tale of two brothers who have to navigate the futuristic dystopian world of Venezuela, 100 years in the future.\n\nHow far would you go for your family? Would you enlist in a corrupt police department and slowly sell your body-parts for cyborg replacements so that your aging father can have a roof over his head? The only answer is pick up your gun and put one foot in front of the other.\n\nThis sci-fi epic by indie comics all-stars Alexis Ziritt (Space Riders, Tarantula) and Dave Baker (F*** Off Squad,…\n\nPreview\n\nWaste Tide\n\nBy Chen Qiufan, Ken Liu (translator),\n\nWhy did Lavanya love this book?\n\nI picked this novel because, for lack of a better phrase, it’s too real. In an entirely believable and horrifying future lies Silicon Isle, an island made of trash. It’s where the world dumps all its electronic waste, for generations of poor, marginalized people to sort through, while pollutants make the tiny world they call home uninhabitable and hostile.\n\nIt also happens to be where a powerful biological weapon is hidden, unknowingly discovered by Mimi, one of the novel’s protagonists. It transforms her. Class disparities come to the fore, leading to revolution. This is classic cyberpunk, refreshingly set in a future outside the UK/ US, translated from the original Chinese by Ken Liu.\n\nBy Chen Qiufan, Ken Liu (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Waste Tide as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA Guardian Science Fiction Book of the Year.\n\nMimi is drowning in the world's trash.\n\nShe's a 'waste girl', a scavenger picking through towering heaps of hazardous electronic detritus. Along with thousands of other migrant workers, she was lured to Silicon Isle, off the southern coast of China, by the promise of steady work and a better life.\n\nBut Silicon Isle is where the rotten fruits of capitalism and consumer culture come to their toxic end. The land is hopelessly polluted, the workers utterly at the mercy of those in power. And now a storm is gathering, as ruthless local…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Warm Machine\n\nBy Seth Rain,\n\nWhy did Julie love this book?\n\nSeth Rain has a knack for building believable worlds, then inserting brain-teasers to make you wonder if this could happen. The writing is fast-paced and hooks you from the start. This particular series made me wonder what is real and what is not: who really is in charge? I’m sure that people who like to think, will love this series.\n\nBy Seth Rain,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Warm Machine as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nHow do you live, knowing the date you will die?\n\nIn a near dystopian future, Artificial Intelligence uncovers the clockwork nature of the universe, capable of revealing the date each person will die.\n\nBut when Scott Beck is told his given date of 22nd April is wrong, he sets off on a journey that explores the true nature of free will, morality, and sacrifice.\n\nCombining dystopian, post-apocalyptic, and cyberpunk fiction, The Warm Machine is the first novel in the haunting five-part Humanity Series, depicting a future in which humanity is on the brink of annihilation.\n\nIt’s not the end of…\n\nPreview\n\nMai Tais for the Lost\n\nBy Mia V. Moss,\n\nWhy did M. Darusha love this book?\n\nI was hooked from the start by the notion that when the Earth has been ravaged by climate change, the rich descend under the sea to lush habitats, complete with staff. The tension between those who pay to live in luxury and those who make their lives luxurious is at the heart of this contemporary cyberpunk murder mystery—and there’s a sapient octopus stripper to boot! I loved the snarky main character—Marrow Nightingale, private eye—and her investigation of her murdered sibling Rocket sets the stage for a fast-paced, fun, and flirty story. I inhaled this book in an afternoon. The characters are great, the atmosphere is fantastic, and the mystery goes to all kinds of science-fictional places.\n\nBy Mia V. Moss,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Mai Tais for the Lost as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMarrow Nightingale is a professional pain in the ass. As Electric Blue Moon's only licensed private investigator, she's the one who snoops the closets of the elite who think the laws don't apply to them. But when the son of a wealthy family turns up dead, it's Marrow's closet that everyone is suddenly interested in. That dead playboy in the foyer? It's her adoptive sibling, Rocket Nightingale.\n\nNow, Marrow's dodging gossip columnists who smell blood in the water, renegade corporate IP with minds of their own, and badge-wearing bone-breakers who would love nothing more than to ship her back to…\n\nPreview\n\nTropical Punch\n\nBy S.C. Jensen,\n\nFrom my list on cyberpunk books you won’t be able to put down.\n\nBy Anna Mocikat Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI fell in love with cyberpunk when I saw Ghost in the Shell for the first time. It quickly became my favorite genre, to read, watch and write. Meanwhile, I’m one of the most renowned cyberpunk indie authors. My series Behind Blue Eyes has quickly become a favorite among readers and bloggers and I’m planning to publish many more books in the series and the genre. Besides, I’m also one of the editors of the Neo Cyberpunk anthology series, a collection of short stories contributed by contemporary cyberpunk indie authors. I hope you enjoy my list and if you want more, check out the Cyberpunk Books group on Facebook!\n\nAnna's book list on cyberpunk books you won’t be able to put down\n\nWhy did Anna love this book?\n\nBubbles in Space couldn’t be more different than the two books above. It features a humoristic approach to the genre and doesn’t take itself too seriously. We follow Bubbles, a pink-haired detective on her adventures in Holo City. Like me, S.C. Jensen is one of the very few female authors in the cyberpunk genre. I recommend checking her books out if you’re looking for something not as grim and dramatic as most cyberpunk books.\n\nBy S.C. Jensen,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Tropical Punch as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nStrippers, drugs, and headless corpses?
