Since his science fiction (sf) debut with the story “Man-Made Self” (1976), Bruce Sterling has so far published eleven novels (plus one in collaboration with William Gibson), over 70 pieces of short fiction (not including dozens of collaborations), and a handful of chapbooks in various media, accruing a number of awards and accolades in the process. He edited the influential Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology (1986) and served for two years (2014-15) as editor of Twelve Tomorrows, MIT Technology Review’s Science Fiction Annual. Sterling’s career beyond sf is marked by a fascination with media and with design, which is perhaps not surprising; after all, the “cyber” in cyberpunk means control, and control necessitates technologies of communication. Sterling’s interest, however, is not (only) directed at the abstract or conceptual-he has consistently shown himself to be more interested in the actuality of the technoscientific frontier than the literary-metaphorical.\n\nAB - This chapter introduces US author, journalist, blogger, and futurist Bruce Sterling.
