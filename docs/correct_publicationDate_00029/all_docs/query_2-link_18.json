        "text": "Most of the science fiction stories I’ve read with nanotechnology (which is by no means all of them), especially the flurry of them published shortly after K. Eric Drexler’s Engines of Creation appeared, used the idea as as a “magic dust” of convenience. Wil McCarthy’s Bloom, however, approached it with realism and technical rigor. It was an impressive book, and I wanted to read more of his work. Like many of my similar resolutions, that didn’t happen until now.\n\nIn keeping with the general theme of science fiction crime and detective stories I’ve got going recently, I took this one off the shelf. Interestingly, on his website, McCarthy puts both novels and some short stories under a section called “The Darker Side of Nanotechnology”. His nanotech stories, he says, walk the middle line between cyberpunkish gloom and techno-optimism.\n\nReview: Murder in the Solid State, Wil McCarthy, 1996.\n\nThe Solid State is near future America which has reduced (at least in the official stats) crime, drugs, and the sort of terrorism which took out the Golden Gate Bridge. It’s a term from the Gray Party, a minority, but influential, political party. (A cynical joke has it that the Democrats want to be your mother, the Republicans your father, and the Grays your probation officer.)\n\nThe technological device behind the Solid State is the Vandergroot Molecular Sniffer, a piece of hardware that detects minute traces of drugs, gun oil, and explosives.\n\nFor those like our hero David Sanger, a post-doc researcher in nanotechnology, the Solid State is a derisive term for the state of nanotechnology: folding proteins and clunky with huge machines that are merely the spinoffs of biological research. He is chafing at the bit to develop real molecular machines and has not only invented a tiny chain link for tranmission of power and but a substance that, depending on the scale of material it’s employed on, is either a powerful glue or lubricant.\n\nAnd the man Sanger holds most responsible for this technological stagnation is none other than “Big Otto” Vandergroot, the man who invented that molecular sniffer. Sanger regards Vandergroot as man whose only real talent is in manufacturing technology and tying up patents. Their enmity was made official with a court case where Sanger successfully defended himself against Vandergroot’s charge of patent violation.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI didn’t intend to read any more Sterling immediately after his Holy Fire and Globalhead, but mission creep is a common feature of our literary recon here. Once I remembered that some of the stories in the latter share the protagonist of this novel, I decided to read this one now.\n\nReview: Zeitgeist: A Novel of Metamorphosis, Bruce Sterling, 2000.\n\nIt seems that no one much seems to care about this novel anymore. It may evoke the “spirit of an age” or, with a moral literal translation of the German, be a “time ghost”, but either way no one much seems to care about it anymore. In my quick perusal of the Web of a Million Lies, I find not much in the way of reviews since 2018.\n\nThat’s understandable. This is not only a goodbye to international trickster Leggy Starlitz, smuggler and entrepreneur of questionable goods and services, but, as the Science Fiction Encyclopedia’s “Bruce Sterling” entry says “a mocking homage to the forever-disappeared twentieth century”.\n\nWith guest cameo references to George Soros, Osama Bin Laden, and Slobodan Milošević, this isn’t even a science fiction novel though it has interludes of magical realism. It’s a vivid and often funny look at the gaps in the global order’s wainscotting that a man like Starlitz thrives in, or, as he puts it, the places where the global order is fraying and he shapes a counternarrative. And the world it describes is one I mostly remember: Russia and the other former countries of the USSR coping with economic and often demographic devastation, Turkey trying to become the leader of the Islamic countries of central Asia, its more secular Islam a counterpoint to Iran, and the bombing of Kosovo in 1999. I didn’t remember the self-immolation of Kurds to embarrass their old enemy Turkey.\n\nY2K is a major concern of Starlitz all throughout out this book, and it wasn’t published until October 2000. This is not a book about millennial anxiety that wasn’t published timely like James Gunn’s The Millennium Blues nor was it blindsided by events like Norman Spinrad’s Russian Spring. It starts toward the end of the millennium and in Istanbul. Leggy Starlitz, as part of a bet with genius music producer Makoto — essentially that they can make money out of a girl band – the G-7 – that has interchangeable members and whose music is crap.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nYou can take this one in a variety of ways: perhaps my most incoherent post ever, a study on the value of re-reading (which I don’t do often), or the process you sometimes have to go through to read a whole trilogy.\n\nShirley was in the triumvirate of major cyberpunk writers along with Bruce Sterling and William Gibson, and A Song Called Youth was his major work in that vein.\n\nThis is not one, but a series of Raw Feeds, “documenting” my reading of that trilogy.\n\nMostly I wanted to post something about this trilogy. But I didn’t want to read it again.\n\nRaw Feed (1988): Eclipse, John Shirley, 1985.\n\nI had even more respect for this book the second time around. Shirley has an impressive grasp of modern pollical, technological, and cultural frontiers and handles all three areas with equal ease. He writes the sort of complicated political novel that appeals to me. His portrait of a future society is very convincing — except for the minor details of tecknick speak and possibly the bit with the Secret Aryan Fraternity. The technology of the extractor is beyond my ken but plausible sounding. The ending is pure wish fulfillment (for part-time musician Shirley), grandiose, romantically implausible, and has a naive message about the power of music (at least Rickenharp’s — who I was sorry to see die but it was a good death — view of music), but Shirley makes it work and ring true and stir you even more on the second read. Many another author probably couldn’t.\n\nShirley can be a stylist when he wants. He manages to give out big dollops of exposition but make it seem natural — at least to me ’cause I never really minded that technique. Other times he uses a Dos Passos’ like style of memos. Other times he jumps forward in the story’s time to give info. Other times he has characters explicating characters who would usually seem unnatural — like Rickenharp’s babbling or Steinfield’s discourses. It’s a gentle mocking comment on the “artificiality” of the device. Shirley can be convincing and when he wants to be absurd he has the skill to pull it off. Last, but not least, he seems to have thought about his politics. We don’t get a simple liberal/conservative, fascist/communist, Marxist/capitalist dichotomy.\n\nRaw Feed (1988): Eclipse Penumbra, John Shirley, 1988.\n\nThe most noticeable feature of this novel is the careful suspenseful balancing of good and bad events for the SA (Second Alliance) and NR (New Resistance). Shirley resists the temptation to have a run of solid good or bad luck for either side. In keeping with this, characters who seem destined for bigger things meet sudden ends like Bonham and Charlie Chesterton. In short, Shirley plots well. He shows a penchant for describing action/combat well (there are better writers in this respect, but he’s good) and a seemingly genuine talent for describing and envisioning future military hardware and tactics.\n\nHis visual sense is keen as befits a sometime writer of screenplays. Eclipse’s theme seem to be fascism’s ideology and appeal. Eclipse Penumbra’s focus seemed to be how it is an ideological “conspiracy” that insinuates itself into government, industry, and public values; how times like this force people to choose sides; and how, sometimes, those in the status quo refuse to accept the new order.\n\nThis is revealed in the novel’s most interesting characters: Stoner and Russ Parker. Their gradual realization the status quo is becoming a threat to them and/or their values, their reluctance to side with those they thought of as radicals, troublemakers, and terrorists, and their consequent actions were well done. I believe somewhere in Eclipse Smoke is credited with saying “War has a habit of making conservatives.” Eclipse Penumbra is about fascism’s attempted coups making liberals. This is explicitly stated in Russ Parker’s last remarks.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAfter reading Holy Fire, I decided to work a bit more on my goal of reading all of Bruce Sterling’s fiction.\n\nReview: Globalhead, Bruce Sterling, 1992.\n\nBruce Sterling’s second collection is very much of its time. The stories range in publication date from 1985 to 1992 and frequently deal with topics of the time: nuclear war and arms negotiation, the decaying Soviet Union, an Islam resurgent after the Iranian Revolution, and even Somalia warlords. In his prime, no other science fiction writer was as keyed into the strangeness of the world, especially outside of America and thought about the present and near future permutations of how technology, politics, and popular culture mix.\n\nThese stories, sometimes written with collaborators, take us back to a mostly vanished world, and are visions made obsolete by technology and political developments. But that’s the price you pay for using a journalist eye to describe the weird now and even weirder near future. As Sterling himself has remarked, his pure fantasy works are the ones most likely to endure, not his science fiction. And some of those fantasies are here along with one story that may have no fantastic elements at all. And, since Sterling seems to love his literary theories, there’s a fair amount of literary experimentation here, mostly successful.\n\nAnd there’s almost always fun. Sterling is usually a funny writer. A mentally impoverished science fiction reader might not get past the staleness of intricately imagined futures that we already know will never be, but I have no problem with them.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhenever I finish reading a science fiction novel, I like to check other people’s reviews of it. That includes looking up material about them in the various science fiction crit books I have.\n\nThe fifth edition of Neil Barron’s Anatomy of Wonder not only has entries on many novels but suggests compare and contrast readings. The entry for Brian Stableford’s Inherit the Earth suggested George Turner’s Beloved Son (which I’ve already done a post on) and this novel. So, given that I eventually intend on reading all of Sterling’s genre work, that’s how I ended up reading this one.\n\nEssay: Holy Fire, Bruce Sterling, 1996.\n\nSterling’s novel was no doubt brilliant, witty and with some memorable lines, presented its arguments with empathetic characterizaiton, and, of course, was chockful of technological and social extrapolations. I’m fairly sure that’s the conclusion I would have drawn had I read it when it was published nearly 30 years ago.\n\nBut events have proceeded on, and now it seems like one of those fairly rare science fiction novels that has taken on a double aspect. Science fiction is rarely a totally serious exercise in prediction, and it succeeds at doing that even less often. The future of Sterling’s novel, this future of 2096 will never occur. It is a world devoid of the smartphone and the cultural, economic, and political damage of massive, unchecked immigration into its settings of America and Europe.\n\nAnd yet, in some respects, it’s a future almost upon us. It’s the sort of novel that a functionary of the World Economic Forum might open for a quieting and heartening vision of their obviously deserved and destined place in the world.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe Bruce Sterling series concludes. I’ve read other Sterling works but made no notes on them.\n\nRaw Feed (2000): A Good Old-Fashioned Future, Bruce Sterling, 1999.\n\n“Maneki Neko” — A bizarre, comedic look at a future Japanese “gift economy” organized efficiently and incorruptibly by vast databases and artificial intelligences. Hero Tsuyoshi Shimizu, who makes a living converting obsolete formatted video recordings to new formats, occasionally sends an interesting bit of recording to special databases, interested companies, and newsgroups via the Internet. In exchange, those coordinating AI’s and databases take care of him by sending him odd, cryptic instructions on his pokkecon (with its cartoon characters it’s an oh-so-Japanese combination phone and personal digital assistant) which lead to all kinds of economic and social goodies or facilitate giving those to someone else. Things become comical when Tsuyoshi does a favor for his wife, a collector of the cat charm – the Maneki Neko – of the title. He crosses paths with Louise Hashimoto, a federal prosecutor from the U.S., who rather hysterically declares the gift economy is a vast criminal conspiracy. She broke part of a gift network, accessed its coordinating server, and now is the subject of a barrage of ingenious, varied forms of harassment. Tsuyoshi’s “digital panarchies … polycephalous, integrated influence networks” threaten all those countries who want to tax his income and benefits. Hashimoto says he lives on kickbacks and bribes. She says his economy is undermining the “lawful, government-approved, regulated economy”. He responds that maybe his economy is better. And maybe it is. It rescues Hashimoto from a mob (which it creates) and may lead to the marriage of Tsuyoshi’s brother and Hashimoto. However, the last line of the story carries an ironic sting: “Then he sat down again and waited patiently for someone to come and give him freedom.” The gift economy comes at a loss of privacy and servitude to the impersonal, computer coordinating apparatus.\n\n“Big Jelly”, Bruce Sterling and Rudy Rucker — Crossbreed a social commentary on high-tech startup companies with a Texas tall tale, filter the mix through Sterling’s acute sense of observation on mores, politics, and the street’s use of manners, add some Rucker strangeness and comedy, and you get this odd, pleasing tale of Urschleim (perhaps the first form of life which has become all others) from Texas oil wells. There are also artificial jellyfishes and their homosexual creator – a mathematician desperate for a stake in a successful, high-tech company and an older man to take care of him, and a young Texas oil scion desperate to start a new family fortune. The characterization, social observation (lots of attention to dress and consumer products), and comedy were all good. I liked the technical details of jellyfishes, natural and artificial. Rucker and Sterling almost make the notion of artificial jellyfishes desirable. Certainly jellyfish fan Tug Mesoglea has better ideas than the inventive, quick-witted, but somewhat wacky, futurist Edna Sydney who suggests fake jellyfish as beach toys and fashion accessories (which Tug likes). The story takes an apocalyptic turn at the end. Revel’s Urshleim turns out to be the by product of a gene-engineered bacteria eating up the Texas oil reservoir. However, our heroes are in on the ground floor of a new “paradigm”. The slime gives off helium and uses cold fusion. Continue reading →\n\nThe Bruce Sterling series continues.\n\nRaw Feed (1994): Heavy Weather, Bruce Sterling, 1994.\n\nThe contrasts and similarities between this and Sterling’s 1988 novel Islands in the Net are interesting.\n\nThe earlier novel was set in 2022. This novel is set nine years later in 2031.\n\nBoth novels feature a contemporary social concern hovering over their worlds. In Islands in the Net, it was the “Abolition” of nuclear weapons as befitting a novel of the nuclear-obsessed Eighties. In Heavy Weather, the effects of the much touted Greenhouse Effect loom over the novel’s milieu. (The title refers to not only the disturbed, violent weather of the Greenhouse world but also its political/social turmoil.)\n\nBoth novels heavily feature the economic effects of the information age. Data pirates featured heavily in Islands in the Net. Here, Sterling postulates other adverse effects of the information age. The U.S. “State of Emergency” in 2015 nationalized all data, and software in general has little value since it can be copied so easily. (Sterling also postulates that software and computer circuits so complicated that computers design them and no human really understands them.). “Unbreakable encryption, digital authentication, anonymous remailing, and network untraceability” have destroyed any governmental – indeed any human – control over the economy with “all workable standards of wealth … vaporized, digitized, and vanished”. Taxation becomes impossible. Vast amounts of black-market money (from untaxed work and crime) comes to the surface, and market forces set up private currencies (of course, historically they have existed). Continue reading →\n\nWhile I take forever to get some more new stuff out, I’ll post some old stuff.\n\nSince I reviewed his recent Pirate Utopia, I thought I’d do a Bruce Sterling series.\n\nRaw Feed (1990): Islands in the Net, Bruce Sterling, 1988.\n\nFor all his hyperbole, posturing, and preaching as to what sf should and shouldn’t be and his wild proclamations on the evils of Reagan, Sterling is a first rate writer. He knows his science and technology (that you can terrorize — quite literally — someone’s brain with carboline, what you can do with an abandoned supertanker, the possibilities of a VCR as a revolutionary broadcast system) and he knows the workings of society (down to the rumors of Pope John Paul I’s death being connected to a Vatican banking scandal); he extrapolates in depth with a detailed style that thoroughly convinces; he creates plausible, complex characters; and he’s not afraid to ask the hard questions in this sometimes ambiguous political novel.\n\nSterling, chief theoretician of the cybperpunk/Neuromantic movement, creates a novel with a middleclass character, Laura Webster, not the low-life criminals or rich, sinister tycoons of, say, early William Gibson novels. Sterling uses the new sf device of the data Net, but it is a realistic portrayal, wide in scope including more than just the fringes of the global society (though, with the data pirates and mercenaries he does that too). Continue reading →\n\nPurely by accident, I seem to be caught in the 1920s for the next few reviews.\n\nI’m still working on my review of Brian Stableford’s Scientific Romance (with 1914 being the most recent story in the anthology), but that’s going to take a while to make notes and write up.\n\nBy I already know what I’m going to say for some books I’ve finished since then.\n\nSo, today, we go to the island of Fiume in 1920 and the short-lived Regency of Carnaro, the so-called Pirate Utopia.\n\nI’d heard of that short-lived “country” before on the Roads to the Great War blog. It was the brainchild of Gabriele D’Annunzio, poet, playwright, fighter pilot, war hero, and inventor, in the Regency, of a lot of the symbols later used by the Italian Fascists.\n\nWhen I again pick up work on my World War One in Fantastic Fiction series, I’ll look more closely at the novella’s elements related to the war, but most of the story takes place post-war. The Regency of Carnaro is one of those European convulsions in the period between the world wars most Americans, including me, are ignorant of since we tend to think only of the Spanish Civil War in that regard.\n\nI’ll probably also read Michael A. Ledeen’s D’Annunzio: The First Duce to see how closely D’Annunzio’s ideas matched Fascism. My sense is not all that closely apart from the political stagecraft Mussolini picked up from D’Annunzio. D’Annunzio seems, at least in this story, way too obsessed with a vision of a new world to be a true fascist. Paul Gottfried’s Fascism: The Career of a Concept only mentions D’Annunzio once.\n\nSpeculiction ways in with a more detailed review.\n\n[Update: Fiume, now called Rijecka, wants to be a country again.]\n\nReview: Pirate Utopia, Bruce Sterling, 2016.\n\nOn September 12, 1919, acclaimed Italian war hero and poet Gabriele D’Annunzio stormed the city of Fiume, in what is now with Croatia, with 2,600 veterans of the Italian Army. He was angry that the Treaty of Versailles did not acknowledge Italian claims to the city. Thus the pirate utopia of scavenging weapons depots, more traditional piracy, extortion, free love, syndicalism, women’s suffrage, and casual drug use was born. To say nothing of the daily poetry readings D’Annunzio gave from a balcony, nightly fireworks, and uniforms that inspired many a European political extremist to come. It was a country where music was declared the fundamental principle of the state.\n\nIn our world, the fun ended on December 24, 1920 when the Italian navy bombarded D’Annunzio’s palace and declared the existence of the Republic of Fiume, an event known in fascist circles as the “Christmas of Blood”.\n\nSterling’s book is an alternate history of a sort and a work of “dieselpunk”. The departure from our timeline is the poisoning of Woodrow Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference. And, while it doesn’t really play into the onstage drama, Hitler fatally catches a bullet during a “beer-hall brawl”. Continue reading →\n\nThe alternate history series continues with some qualifying stories buried in this review.\n\nRaw Feed (2001): Year’s Best SF 2, ed. David G. Hartwell, 1997.\n\n“After a Lean Winter”, Dave Wolverton — This is the second time I’ve read this story, the first being in its original appearance in the War of the Worlds: Global Dispatches, ed. by Kevin Anderson. I still liked its story of Jack London, during the Martian invasion depicted in H.G. Wells’ The War of the Worlds, hiding out in the Arctic and watching a bloodmatch between dogs and a captured Martian. This time, though, (after reading Michael Swanwick’s “The Wisdom of Old Earth”, seemingly inspired by London’s The Sea Wolf), I was reminded that this is not only a clever use of London in the context of the central idea of alien invasion but also a further reworking of his theme of blood struggle in life and evolution.\n\n“In the Upper Room“, Terry Bisson — I originally read this story in its first publication in Playboy. I didn’t like it then, and I didn’t like it the second time around. It was not interesting. It wasn’t an insightful story about lingerie fetish or any other type of sexual fetish. It wasn’t erotic. It wasn’t satirical — at least not in any way that mattered.\n\n“Thinkertoy“, John Brunner — It was a nice surprise to see one of John Brunner’s last stories here. It was written for the Jack Williamson tribute anthology The Williamson Effect. According to his introductory notes, Hartwell says Brunner died before he could write the afterword for the story, but Hartwell speculates that it was inspired by Williamson’s “Jamboree”, a story I have not read. That may be true, but I also was reminded of Williamson’s classic “With Folded Hands” since, like that story, we have a man coming across a vendor of wonderful robotic merchandise, robots which eventually turn out to be very sinister. Here a widower buys the remarkable Tinkertoys which are clever, highly adaptable robots which can (rather like Legos) be assembled into several different shapes and do all sorts of wonderful things: answer the phone in several, customizable voices with Eliza-like abilities to keep the conversation going, integrate various household electronics, serve as worthy opponents in various games, and household inventory control. His withdrawn son, traumatized by the death of his mother in an auto accident, takes a real shine to the toys and programs them for all sorts of things, helped by his older sister. The protagonist finds out that the chips used in the Thinkertoys were originally designed as a Cold War weapon. They were to be dropped behind enemy lines to conduct various acts of subtle industrial sabotage: jam electronics, loosen valves, start fires, and mess up bearings. The children eventually use the toys to try and kill their father (The cold, impatient, malicious intelligence of the children reminded me of those in Brunner’s Children of the Thunder.). As to why, they explain, simply, “He was driving.”, referring to the auto accident that killed their mother. Continue reading →"
