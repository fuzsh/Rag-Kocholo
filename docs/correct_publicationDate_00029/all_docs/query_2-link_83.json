        "text": "I’m a huge science fiction fan, and, having read a list of what are alleged to be the top 200 science fiction novels, I decided to next tackle a read-through of all the Hugo Award winners and nominees for best novel. Let me know your thoughts and favorites. I’ve marked the winner as well as my own choice for which novel would win, had I the choice among the nominees. I’ve also dropped a short reflection on the year’s Hugo list at the end.\n\nTo Say Nothing of the Dog by Connie Willis (Winner)- Grade: B-\n\nWhat a strange novel this was. First, the timing of it–this was the book I brought with to the hospital when one of my children was being born. Yes, my wife and I each read books while we were waiting in the hospital room. Anyway, that means this novel will forever be linked to a supremely happy event in my life. But it’s so strange. Ostensibly another book in the series of oft-inept (though not always comedically–sometimes tragically) time travelers from Oxford University, this one leans more into the comedic side. It devolves a bit into a kind of mystery of how to prevent space and time from getting torn asunder by an object brought back from 2057 to 1888. But it reads kind of like a travelogue of bumbling fools? I don’t know how to describe it better, and it’s been a while since I read it. I often re-read before writing up these reviews, but I honestly don’t want to do it with this novel because I don’t want to ruin the nostalgic bubbly feelings I have about the time in which I read it. It’s just going to exist as a baby-birthing book to me, and that’s what it shall remain forever.\n\nDarwinia by Robert Charles Wilson- Grade: D\n\nI think this may be a case of not reading the book at the right time. I’d almost checked this one out from the library a couple times based on the gorgeous cover art. When I read the inside flap, it didn’t sound exciting at all, so I put it down. I finally grabbed it because I saw it was on the Hugo list and figured I should read it. Many of the reviews I read after kept complaining about how great the beginning was but how boring it got later on. I thought it was more consistently boring throughout, to be honest. The premise is that in the 19th Century a huge amount of land has been replaced by some completely new land by means unknown. But there seemed to be little to get me as a reader invested into the plot. It was so fantastically weird that it didn’t even begin to work when I suspended disbelief. The characters were not intriguing, and the strangeness of the new land was mostly done by telling rather than showing. I’ve read several Robert Charles Wilson novels since this one and enjoyed them each immensely, which makes me want to eventually circle back to Darwinia for a re-read.\n\nDistraction by Bruce Sterling- Grade: B\n\nDistraction follows Oscar Valparaiso, a master of political spin who just successfully got his employer into Senate, and he heads on a kind of vacation to Texas as the country continues to splinter into political factions. The dysfunctional level of the government is extremely high throughout the novel. One of the more memorable scenes is an Air Force traffic stop in which drunken members of an airbase the government is trying to shut down attempt to solicit bribes from Oscar and his political “krewe,” only stopping when a personal connection is made between Oscar and one of the guards.\n\nThe book rumbles along, introducing more and more insanity and ineptitude by turns. It has that heavy sense of too much going on but somehow working that some other sterling sci-fi novels have. At times, I thought Sterling hovered on a scene or two a bit too long. The novel reads as weirdly prescient in the post-2016 world, with Sterling almost obsessively going over the moods and whims of individual politicos, painting a chilling picture of how easy it is to manipulate the truth to one’s own satisfaction. And by truth, we of course mean truth as popularly understood. Disturbing and funny by turns, Distraction is a pleasant read that I would recommend to others.\n\nFactoring Humanity by Robert J. Sawyer Grade: C-\n\nI have strong and mixed feelings about this novel from Sawyer.\n\nFirst, I think the discussion of accusations of sexual abuse and potential for false accusations is… not good. Though never made hugely explicit, the thrust of that plot point seems to be a “benefit of the doubt” type response to accusations of sexual violence. It felt yucky all the way through, and when Stone, the man who Kyle goes to because Stone was also “falsely accused” outs himself for having actually done what he was accused of, it doesn’t help. Basically, we’re supposed to sympathize with Kyle for being falsely accused, then given a red herring of someone else “falsely accused,” only to discover that one is actually an abuser. None of this sat right with me.\n\nThe kicker of all of that is that it was an entirely unnecessary plot point. Like, it really only gave we the readers 2 things: dramatic tension at the beginning of the story with the accusation leveled against Kyle; and a way to demonstrate the powers of the Centaur’s overmind device. None of it was necessary, and it felt like the false accusation narrative was therefore being pushed for an agenda-laden purpose. Sawyer’s corpus has sexual violence as a somewhat repeated theme, and I don’t know of a single time in which I think he handles it well. Maybe there’s no way to do so, but I think it can be done much better than it is here.\n\nSecond, I was kind of taken aback by the “big reveal” of the overmind and I actually ended up thinking it was pretty cool. The whole plot with the Centaurs, etc. showing up was great, and I loved the mystery of figuring out what their communications were supposed to mean. That was definitely a strong point.\n\nI also thought the Cheetah/Kyle interaction taking a dark turn towards the end was fascinating, and was kind of a fan of that implication of a “Dark Forest” type scenario being hinted at. Overall, another strong point. Unfortunately, the book as a while is super uneven.\n\nChildren of God by Mary Doria Russell (My Winner)- Grade: A\n\nReady for some cerebral sci-fi? Are you in the right mood to read something that requires you to think, absorb the harshness of the world while still finding some hope, and perhaps even grieve? Okay, then dive in to Children of God. It’s the sequel to The Sparrow, a widely acknowledged sci-fi classic. The premise is that humans make first contact with aliens but badly misunderstand virtually everything about that first contact and those aliens, leading to some horrific crimes against humans that, contextually, don’t seem totally unreasonable from the outlook of the aliens. In the sequel, readers deal with the fallout from that contact in many different ways. Russell weaves a tale that constantly tugs at heartstrings while also diving deeper and deeper into aspects of humanity and even theology. The only real problem I have with the book is that because it is so heavy in its content, the sheer density and length of it can become tiring after a while. Overall, though, Children of God is one of those excellent works of sci-fi that sticks with you longer after you read it.\n\nI do wonder why Mary Doria Russell appears to have turned away from writing sci-fi after this book, though. I hope she’ll return someday.\n\n1999- Honestly, this was an incredibly refreshing year as we as readers come out of the 90s with only one hard sci-fi novel in the mix. Again, I love hard science fiction, but the 90s Hugo nominees were absolutely dominated by this subgenre. Anyway, the low scorer here might be one I need to revisit, as I suspect that my appreciation for Robert Charles Wilson is much higher now and I might enjoy Darwinia on a reread. Let me know if you recommend it. The winner, Children of God, challenges concepts of colonialism, humanity, and theology. It’s excellent literary sci-fi. Between those we have the zany Connie Willis time travel-ish novel and Sterling’s strange but humorous work. Overall, a vastly entertaining year for the award.\n\nAll Links to Amazon are Affiliates\n\nLinks\n\nMy Read-Through of the Hugos– Read more posts in this series and follow me on the journey!

Let me know your thoughts and favorites. I’ve marked the winner as well as my own choice for which novel would win, had I the choice among the nominees. I’ve also dropped a short reflection on the year’s Hugo list at the end.\n\nRemnant Population by Elizabeth Moon- Grade: B\n\nI enjoyed this pastoral first contact story. Ofelia is left behind at an abandoned colony and begins her life fresh, intent on living out her last days in relative peace and comfort. But her comfort is disrupted by an apparently violent clash with new colonists and the native aliens on a different part of the planet. The rest of the story centers around Ofelia’s interactions with the native people, their remarkable qualities, and another human group coming to make contact. Interspersed throughout are delightful explorations of pastoral settings, which is quite reminiscent to me of the best Clifford Simak novels. I wish the story had done more with the impact of colonialism and the impact of that on the people. That’s not the story Moon is telling, but I think it could have been added to it and built upon.\n\nBlue Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson (Winner)- Grade: B\n\nBlue Mars is the third book in the trilogy by Robinson, and at this point you should know what to expect. The books are door-stopper length hard sci-fi explorations of what a future life on Mars might look like. In this one, we’ve got a couple twists thrown in as Earth experiences some severe climate problems, leading to pressure to expand Martian population. Meanwhile, on Mars, a group of people calling themselves the “Reds” (due to the planet’s color) push to keep Mars in its original non-terraformed state. This, of course, is the cause of Some Drama. Like a Ben Bova novel–another prolific hard sci-fi author of the time–your mileage on this one will directly correspond to two things: how much fake science (loosely based on real science) you can handle/enjoy and how much tolerance you have for fairly wooden characters. Don’t get me wrong, some of the characters here get development and real bones under their skin, but their arcs are predictable nearly from the first page you encounter any of them. I found it to be a good read, despite being overly long. It’s a worthy end to the trilogy.\n\nMemory by Lois McMaster Bujold (My Winner)- Grade: A-\n\nMiles Vorkorsigan must give up his double life and fully get involved in Barrayaran affairs as he needs to help uncover some nefarious plot therein. Simon Illyan, a top military man and Miles’s former boss, is struggling with his memory and he’s fading faster than seems possible. Miles is given broad power as Imperial Auditor to investigate what happened and why.\n\nI’ll be first to admit that the Vorkorsigan Saga is largely beach reading type sci-fi for me. While I will stand up and say Barrayar is among the all-time SFF greats, most of the series is pretty pithy and fun without much thought involved. Memory walks the edge, touching on the depths of despair memory loss can cause while still remaining pretty light reading. It’s definitely one of the best in the long-running series.\n\nStarplex by Robert J. Sawyer- Grade: B-\n\nSawyer wrote in the introduction to this book (in the edition I have) that his goal was to write a final spaceships go boom type of science fiction novel before he dove into his more recent stuff that focuses on more literary and plot conventions. I’m paraphrasing there, but after the intro I was kind of surprised at how little spaceships go boom type stuff there was. No, this is, like most of Sawyer’s other works, a thought-provoking look at the subject at hand. Here, the subject happens to be super powerful aliens (maybe) and mysterious interconnected gates and why/how they work. It’s a well-told story overall, though I did think Sawyer got caught up a bit too much in the minutiae of the invented tech rather than moving the plot along. It’s a good read, though, as most of Sawyer’s works are.\n\nHoly Fire by Bruce Sterling- Grade: B+\n\nIn the future, humans have pushed life expectancies well into 100+ years. Going along with that, though, the near-utopic society provides the best health care to those who practice the best health practices. This has led to some people becoming truly ancient, as they push their health and limits to post-human endurance maximums. When our main character, Mia, has the option to become a youth again, she takes it, only to find out the utopia in which they’re living may in fact be sucking their humanity away.\n\nThematically, this is one of the more interesting books on post-humanism I’ve read, which makes the few caveats all the more frustrating. Starting with those caveats, the biggest one is that the post-human society is both sold to readers as a kind of moral quandary and as a moral horror. How are we supposed to see this society? Leaving it a question left up to the reader is a choice I enjoy in this dystopic/utopic type fiction, but having the post humans also casually dropping billions of deaths to set up the society makes the whole thing a bit of a non-starter. A society backed on such an act cannot be moral; that seems obvious. And because of that, some of the power of the ambiguity with some of the other questions introduced is sapped away. Additionally, Mia doesn’t strike me as a particularly powerful protagonist. Instead, she is kind of dragged along by events, only coming to realizations when other, perhaps more intriguing characters leader her to the conclusions. Perhaps that’s a function of Sterling’s narrative–Mia is a stand-in for the questioning reader–but it still makes it somewhat unsatisfactory.\n\nThere are, however, some truly fascinating things about post humanism mixed in here. What would we be willing to give up to “ascend” into a different kind of humanity. And just what would be worth it? And who would get to do that ascending–the powerful? Or are there other ways that play out (the healthy as the ascendant here)? It’s all very fascinating and Sterling is such an electric thinker and writer that I’m willing to forgive several of the more disappointing aspects of the novel. This is sci-fi for people who want to be forced to think about deep topics.\n\n1997- 97 is an excellent year at the Hugo nominations. None of the books are terrible, and all of them are worth reading. The winner for me, barely, is Memory, which serves up a look at the horrors of memory loss while still giving readers more of the Vorkorsigan saga they know and love. Holy Fire is a superb read but stretched my credulity a bit too far to push it over the top. It’s a great read for those interested in post-humanism and I’d definitely put it on a required reading list for those readers. Sawyer’s entry is a fine space opera, though I admit I found it fairly forgettable. Blue Mars serves up a good conclusion to the trilogy, though problems of writing characters for KSR remain. Finally, Remnant Population hearkens back to some early cozy sci-fi along the lines of Simak, a favorite of mine. The list is fairly diverse in subgenre representation, as well, though it retains the 90s penchant for hard sci-fi. What did you think? Let me know in the comments.\n\nLinks\n\nMy Read-Through of the Hugos– Read more posts in this series and follow me on the journey!

I’ve marked the winner as well as my own choice for which novel would win, had I the choice among the nominees.\n\nRed Prophet by Orson Scott Card- Grade: D-\n\nThe second book in the Alvin Maker series turns out to be even more problematic than the first book. In Seventh Son, Card turned those with differing religious beliefs into (literal) tools of the devil. With Red Prophet, Native Americans are in his sights, and through the use of Ta-Kumsaw, among other Native characters, it is revealed that the Native people of the Americas have special spiritual powers from the land which are thwarted when they do things like put on white man’s clothes and the like. Yeah… and it gets worse throughout the book. Whiskey is the Native Americans’ main enemy, because it thwarts some of their innate magic as well. One character goes to find his “dream beast” to heal his hurting soul. Alvin Maker Jr.’s brother, Measure, is able to be used as a white savior narrative towards the end of the novel, of course. No caricature of interaction with Native Americans would be complete without that, right? The heck of it is that Card still manages to make the whole thing interesting enough to not make it an entirely loathesome experience all the way through. I initially read these books as a teenager and loved them, but on a re-read, with even the slightest awareness of the problematic elements, it becomes essentially unreadable.\n\nFalling Free by Lois McMaster Bujold- Grade: B\n\nThe Vorkorsigan saga is one of my favorite reads. Falling Free takes place a few hundred years before the main action of that series. It centers on the Quaddies, a group of humans genetically engineered to have arms instead of legs, so that they are ideally suited to life in null-g space. It’s a story that is largely about corporate interests and experiments gone awry. The corporation that developed the Quaddies attempts to make them totally dependent upon the corporation for everything, even as they exploit their labor. Leo Graf, an engineer hired to train the Quaddies, ultimately helps to free them. The book is a fine adventure. It’s not terribly deep, but I enjoyed my time in the world.\n\nIslands in the Net by Bruce Sterling (My Winner)- Grade: B\n\nSterling has created a complex, interweaving novel that is as steeped in the time in which it was written as it is imaginative and even challenging for the future. In the future of Islands…, corporations are independent entities with the power of nations, in a sense. The story ranges across multiple continents and countries as these corporations vie with nations for power. This setup might make it seem like the novel is a vast political epic–but it’s quite the opposite. It is a fairly focused novel following Laura Webster–an employee of one of these global corporations–as she tries to make sense of the world-changing events around her. And, indeed, she is directly involved in some of these events herself. Sterling throws a dizzying array of details at the reader right away, and the world building never quite settled down enough for me to feel I got my bearings. Moreover, the character-driven plot didn’t work as well as it could have with a more dynamic character. Laura seems more to be carried along by events than she does a driving force in the plot. The book is much more about ideas than it is about the central plot, but the ideas are startling–even prophetic–and looking back on them more than 30 years later doesn’t take any of the freshness and weirdness away. The book stands up superbly.\n\nCyteen by C.J. Cherryh (Winner)- Grade: C+\n\nCyteen is a book that can be and probably has been used as a doorstop. At times, I contemplated relegating it to that exact use going forward. It’s a hugely dense book that reads almost as an overview of political, economic, and societal history of the Cyteen system. The core plot follows the goings on of some of the most privileged of this society, and it reads as such. It becomes tedious at many points along the way. Cherryh’s skill with interpersonal drama is one of the driving forces that keeps it going. I would classify this one as a slog, though not always a bad one.\n\nMona Lisa Overdrive by William Gibson- Grade: C\n\nAnother Gibson novel, another baffling array of plot points, strange names, and mind-bending ideas. Gibson wearies me. Each time I read something from him, I come out on the other end feeling physically tired. Mona Lisa Overdrive ostensibly “only” has 4 plots going on in parallel, each with a number of people, confusing terms, and sometimes baffling human activity. Of course, they align eventually with each other, but the climax is surprisingly predictable. I don’t even try guessing endings of books (just not something that helps me enjoy them, usually) and I saw this one coming. That surprised me more than anything. I guess it’s an okay novel. It’s just not my cup of tea.\n\n1989\n\nI found this year to be among the less notable years for the Hugo nominees. Nothing really rises above the pack. It’s also one of those years you can definitely look at what was eligible and exclaim, “Wow! That didn’t make it?” For example, The Player of Games by Iain M. Banks was eligible for a 1989 Hugo, and despite being in my opinion one of the best science fiction novels ever written, it didn’t even end up on the ballot. David Zindell’s Neverness is another that has achieved cultic popularity later on, but didn’t make the ballot. So… I kinda wish the awards had been different this year. Islands in the Net is a fine novel, but quite flawed for me to choose it as a winner among the nominees. Falling Free is also… fine. It’s a decent story, but not one of my favorites in the lengthy Vorkorsigan Saga. And Cyteen, the winner, is obviously an extraordinarily ambitious novel, but it’s also quite difficult to read. Nevertheless, it’s not the worst year for the Hugos. Hopefully 1990 will be better!\n\nLinks\n\nScience Fiction Hub– I have scores of reviews of Hugo nominees, Vintage Sci-Fi, modern sci-fi, TV series, and more!
