        "text": "November 2, 2010\n\nAt times, my mind would wander while reading Schismatrix. But not in the usual way wherein a thought much more interesting than what's on the page enters my head. Instead, I found myself often just musing about the ideas I'd just read a paragraph ago or even earlier in the book.\n\nSchism is so packed with ideas and dwells so little on any one of them that it was sometimes a bit difficult to keep reading, wait, that idea was so interesting...the ramifications...we can't go on yet, I have to think about this!\n\nDespite having been written twenty-five years ago (can 1985 really be that distant?) there is very little in Schism to place the date of its authorship anywhere but on the bleeding edge. Sterling sidestepped many of the usual conventions of Science Fiction altogether, so there's little of the familiar to fall back upon and it's no lazy read. In fact, it can be a bit exhausting. But I found plenty of humanity and meaning amongst the chaos of technologies, philosophies, world-building and world-destroying.\n\nSo I recommend that you crack open the Schismatrix, where the excitement of invention truly never ends.\n\nMarch 2, 2010\n\nI had written Bruce Sterling off as a relic of the cyberpunk era, big mistake. The wow factor is pretty big on this. Mind mutating, WTF, idea per sentence science fiction with shades at time of Bester, Triptree jr. Delaney, Barrington J. Bailey(who blurbs it) William S. Burroughs, and Ballard. Dense, filled with absurd humor and grotesque surreal visions, as human future and form breaks and cascades into increasing odd shapes. I feel a little buzzed after finishing this. This and a couple of short stories have put Sterling on my favorites list. This book also had a profound influence on the books of Charles Stross and Alastair Reynolds, the former taking the zany idea flinging and economic speculation and the latter the grim, fractured weirdness.\n\nFebruary 27, 2010\n\nThe only other book I've read that comes at all close to kinship with this fascinating space epic is Stross's 2005 Accelerando, which appears to have been influenced both indirectly (in form & style) and directly (posthumanism & lobters!) by Schismatrix, which predates Accelerando by two decades. In both cases there is at least one tongue-lolling, brain boiling, oh-wow SF concept worked into the story in every paragraph. Such a high ratio of idea-to-story weighs a little heavy on the reading at times, sometimes making ciphers out of secondary characters and making blatant macguffins out of interplanetary political conspiracies and intruige, but it never veers too far into the superficial, and Sterling occasionally lets his left brain cool down for stretches and allows some real depth and pathos to seep into his story before resuming the SF pyrotechnics. There were occasionally whole stretches of the story that made only a passing amount of sense to me (i.e. \"are they *really* transforming themselves into modified deep sea creatures and colonizing the subterranean oceans of Europa, or did I miss something?\"), but such parts were still a deliriously pleasurable experience.\n\nConsidering how much of this book, first published in 1985, still feels new and mind-blowing, and given the influence it has had in the genre these past two decades (Swanwick, Stross, et. al.) it is a must read for sf devotees.\n\nOctober 20, 2014\n\nThis book has been on my list after reading an excellent short story by Sterling dealing with this same universe. Well after finally finding a copy of this and reading it, I can say I wasn't missing much. Like a lot of SF, the characters seem like cardboard cutouts, and the plot is not good to say the least. Actually, this book is confusing as hell. Why are the characters doing what they are doing? What is motivating them? Sterling does present a colorful vision of the future where humans abandon Earth and live out on lunar colonies, on asteroids, and moons of Saturn. They are divided up into Mechanists and Shapers. They apparently don't like each other but it's never made clear why. There is an alien race called The Investors who arrive and there is a period of détente. Then the Investors go away or something. Who knows? This really seems like a several short story pieces that are clumsily cobbled together to make a novel. The chapters are sometimes several years apart in the timeline with no decent grounding of what happened during the intervening years or why. There's also dozens of characters who drift in and out of the novel at various times. Like I said, confusing as hell.\n\nJuly 15, 2014\n\n-Innovador en su momento, pero pocos se dieron cuenta.-\n\nGénero. Ciencia-Ficción.\n\nLo que nos cuenta. Abelard Lindsay es un formista (o formador en otras ediciones) desterrado a la Luna en la que rápidamente debe usar su ingenio y su “formación”, nunca mejor dicho, en diplomacia para encontrar tanto la forma de sobrevivir en la tensa sociedad de Zaibatsu Popular Circunlunar de Mare Tranquilitatis como la forma de luchar por aquello en lo que cree, totalmente distinto de lo que la facción mecanista (o mecanicista en otras ediciones) propone.\n\n¿Quiere saber más de este libro, sin spoilers? Visite:\n\nhttp://librosdeolethros.blogspot.com/...\n\nSeptember 26, 2008\n\nI read this due to a recommendation at the end of Alastair Reynolds' Galactic North. I thought it was pretty good, but definitely more intellectually stimulating than entertaining. He has some pretty fascinating ideas, although the overall plot itself is a little lackluster. Definitely worth reading, if only to see some ancestral ideas that evolved their way into Reynolds' Revelation Space universe.\n\nApril 10, 2019\n\nChe trip!\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMay 15, 2019\n\nFrag mich bitte keiner nach der Handlung; obwohl viel in dem Roman drin steckt - was auch immer.\n\n3 Sterne wären zu wenig, 4 zu viel.\n\nNovember 26, 2010\n\nSterling's highly detailed future Worlds and Races reminds me of Iain M. Banks at his best in the Culture novels. There's usually a large dose of social critique in Sterling's books and this is no exception with it's interspecies animosity and interaction having parallels with our own planet and it's current and historical cultural and racial conflicts. There's a significant degree of anthropomorphism with the aliens but hey! at least it's not bunny rabbits with human emotions. I'd recommend all of Bruce Sterling's books and this is no exception.\n\nJanuary 8, 2014\n\nA very difficult book to get through. And honestly not a well written because the book's ideas are all over the place and near impossible to figure out what is going on. It took me almost the entire book to unravel the main premise was two cousins with different philosophies of life are out to get each other. There is plenty of political manipulation and deception. A couple of interesting ideas but far and few between.\n\nApril 10, 2012\n\nEh. Hard science sci-fi with a psychedelic edge. Mechs versus shapers in a diplomatic battle for the something or other. Covers centuries, feels like it took months to slog through.\n\nI'm reading it twenty-five years too late.\n\nOctober 2, 2020\n\nНепогано, дуже зайшло. 3 частини дуже різні по настрою і сюжету, друга мені зайшла, мабуть, найбільше.\n\nЄдине, що трохи незрозуміло - чому книга записується в багатьох описах до кіберпанку. Той факт, що Стерлінг - один з батьків жанру, зовсім не означає, що він має писати виключно кіберпанк. Що не робить книгу анітрохи гіршою.\n\nApril 11, 2021\n\nPer quanto apprezzi l’acume di Sterling nelle sue analisi sociopolitiche e riconosca la sua capacità di dipingere società realistiche, senza risparmiarsi una critica a quella in cui viviamo, la sua scrittura proprio non mi appassiona.\n\nLeggo i suoi romanzi, certo, ma faccio fatica ad arrivare in fondo, e questo non fa eccezione.\n\nSarà la narrazione di ampio (troppo?) respiro, che copre un intervallo di secoli, sarà la sua maggiore attenzione per l’introspezione psicologica e sociale rispetto alle scene d’azione, sarà la ricerca dei dettagli, ma non riesco ad accedere appassionarmi come vorrei alle sue storie.\n\nLimite mio.\n\nMay 19, 2013\n\nBruce Sterling was one of the leaders of the Cyperpunk movement in science fiction and Schismatrix is the central novel of Sterling's shaper/mechanist universe. The Schismatrix is the whole extraterrestrial mankind after departure from exploited and polluted earth to orbital stations around the moon, in the asteroid belt, the Saturn rings or other places in the solar system. A schisma of mankind into shapers and mechanists took place with shapers focussing on genetical engineering and mechanists using mechanical implants to extend and improve life. The factions are fighting each other in wars lasting generations. At the fringes of societies diverse subcultures have formed. Their participants are called sundogs. Schismatrix mainly tells the story of one of them, Abelard Lindsay, spanning almost 200 years of his life. A main theme is the arrival of alien races and their influence on mankind.\n\nThe book is termed a cyberpunk novel, although it is not about the seemingly constitutive element of the genre, cyberspace. It's linked to the genre in its generally pessimistic attitude toward human development and man/technology integration. Mankind will continue to fight each other for power and wealth, exploit their environment notwithstanding any technological progress. Technology's role is to provide new ways of living after man has destroyed his environment again. It can't help to overcome human weaknesses. Nonetheless, Sterling leaves a remainder of hope as mankind is inventive enough to always find new ways to survive and he hints at a future in what he calls post-humanism.\n\nTo me it's a punk novel in so far as the author's wants are larger than his skills which could be said of almost any early punk musician. The book is full of half-baked philosophy, the writing appears more dilettantistic than stylish which is not helped by one of the worst German translations I've read.\n\nIt has enough strengths though. Sterling has lots of ideas & thoughts on future issues, many of them just hinted at to be explored in other stories. There's a richness of settings and concepts that could fuel ten other SF stories. The disintegration of mankind into many different social systems is interesting enough and the characterization of alien races so facetted that I would love to read a hypothetical history book of Sterling's shaper/mechanist universe where the weaknesses of his story telling wouldn't matter.\n\nApril 23, 2020\n\nI am not quite sure what to say about this book. It's not going to be for everyone. Many recommended it to me as a classic science fiction novel with cyberpunk flare (though not so much really) and a great future vision for author and seer Bruce Sterling. For the language of futurism alone, I loved it. Like this passage on pages 246-47: \"In the hands of the Zen Serotonists, the Ring Council struggled for stability; as a result, it was falling behind. The cutting edge of genetics technology had been seized by the wild-eyed black surgeons of the cometaries and the Uranian rings, mushrooming posthuman clades like the Metropolarity, the Blood Bathers, and the Endosymbiotics. They had discarded humanity like a caul. Disintegrating microfactions surrounded the Schismatrix like a haze of superheated plasma.\"\n\nAnd there's lots more where that came from. It's poetic, lyrical, and fantastic, like a futuristic garden spring roll with surprise tastes hidden inside its roll.\n\nIt's a complicated, lavish, dense book, though its plot hums along swiftly, and there's plenty of sex. It's surely worth re-reads. I just wish there was an audio version.\n\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\nI think it’s a testament to the richness of ideas in this books that I’m giving it 4 stars despite there being no real plot and weak characters. In brief, I really think it’s a must read for sci-fi fans, particularly those who are into Alastair Reynolds (Reynolds’ writing was influenced by Schismatrix).\n\nThis book focused a lot on the probability of humanity splitting more and more rapidly into different ‘clades’ of life, each clade with its own vision of post-human life. The diversification of humans is so rapid and bizarre that it’s easy to get vertigo reading it all. In the end I liked this effect, as it felt like a compelling and realistic way of showing what may happen to far future humanity - that we eventually became aliens to each other.\n\nAwesome book. Not for everyone\n\nFebruary 28, 2012\n\nThis was the first science fiction book which blew my mind. I was about sixteen years old and reading it in a grungy motel on the beach in Samoa where my family stopped for a holiday in the process of moving to New Zealand. What I've always loved about Bruce Sterling is his characters, he writes character driven, grungy cyberpunk. It's full of meat and emotions and all the failures of humanity. There is no holy grail, only humanity driven and changed by the pursuit of technology.\n\nI've lost count of the number of times I've read this book, bought this book and the number of times I've loaned it to people. If you haven't already read it, DO IT.\n\nJanuary 5, 2013\n\nNot my taste. The first section had a sort of post-apocalyptic feel - most people seem like scavengers, pirates, black market...a major form of currency corresponds to time one can spend with prostitutes... Not a good start for me. The end involving some mysterious / implausible entity didn't work for me. In between, the story was essentially futuristic intrigue. Didn't really engage me, but didn't put me off either. A theme of divisions between groups of future humans based on bio-enhancements, tech body parts or those who are just brains hooked into the computer network will interest some readers, but I didn't feel it was explored deeply.\n\nDecember 29, 2012\n\nbeen meaning to read this for a really, really, REALLY long time... finally got around to it. i was expecting cyperpunk but it's not, it's far-future space opera; feels a lot like varley's The Ophiuchi Hotline. only a lot longer and not as much fun. the ideas are great (and they just keep coming), and the book's written in a kind of hallucinogenic countercultural michael moorcockian mode, but the story is just... really slow. like, \"wait, is there even a story?\" type slow. it was hard to finish.\n\nJune 27, 2011\n\nThis is a good science fiction novel, but it is very heavy and in the end I appreciated the short stories in the back better than the actual Schismatrix part.\n\nAugust 2, 2017\n\nthis is the one that i asked bruce to sign. and old tattered paperback copy, but treasured. then his wife asked him to turn down the led zepplin because the kids were trying to sleep. or something.\n\nJanuary 27, 2017\n\nInteresting ideas, but horrible writing. Plot and character development were poor and context was nonexistent. Couldn't finish it.\n\nSeptember 16, 2010\n\nImaginative and interesting 80s sci-fi with no plot. Damn, this coulda been way more readable...\n\nDecember 9, 2022\n\nA Cyberpunk infused early and influential work of postmodern space opera.\n\nWarning: spoiler alert!!\n\nBruce Sterling’s Shaper/Mechanist series (1982-1985) consists of several short stories and only one book, Schismatrix. The series revolves around a conflict between two ideologically divided factions: the Shapers who dream of a transhumanist utopia via biogenetic engineering, and the Mechanists who strive for perfection through machine implants and computer circuits. Set in a widely colonized 24th Century Solar System, Schismatrix is an early and hugely influential example of postmodern space opera.\n\nAbelard Lindsay, born into a Mechanist family, has changed allegiance to the Shaper cause. Political intrigue has forced him into exile in the circumlunar criminal enclave of the People’s Zaibatsu, a lawless and slowly decaying society. Lindsay eventually manages to escape so he can begin a journey across the Solar System, promoting peace between the Shapers and Mechanists, working for the Preservist cause of trying to preserve a core of humanity’s baseline, an endeavour that is tied up in and threatened by a decade-long rivalry with his former ally, Philip Constantine, now a Shaper militant. By the intervention of a technologically more advanced alien race known as the Investors, who weigh in by pursuing peace for the sake of a free flowing economy, Lindsay initially succeed at establishing an uneasy détente between Shapers and Mechanists.\n\nThe Shaper/Mechanist schism is only the tip of the iceberg and symptomatic of much wider splintering of humanity in the world of Schismatrix, a sf trope that has since come to define most of postmodern space opera, such as David Zindell’s Neverness Universe (1988-1998) and Dan Simmons’ Hyperion Cantos (1989-1997). Sterling envisions a mature space-faring civilisation where any sense of community has evaporated, where a global understanding of humanity is impossible. The sheer amount of therapies available within each camp means that is not even possible to reduce the Shaper/Mechanist schism to a simple binary. While Mechanist \"Lobsters\" permanently seal their bodies into life-support shells, allowing them to live and work in deep space, Mechanist ‘Wireheads’ have left their bodies behind to live as computer simulations. The splintering of humanity has also led to an explosion in different ideologies, from Preservationism, the idea that the human baseline must be preserved, to Cataclysm, a libertarian resistance to social controls, to Zen Serotonin, a bioengineered drive for zen-like bliss and slowing down of societal change.\n\nTechnology has also opened up the field of human phycology and what it means to be human. Shapers can change mode of consciousness at will, they can free themselves of emotional baggage to enhance their analytical acumen. Side-stepping humanness for political or economic gain is the source of continual tension in the work, a theme that anticipates Peter Watts’ multi-layered investigation into the nature and evolutionary purpose of consciousness in the his still ongoing Blindsight series (2006-2014?). Subject to the same evolutionary logic, Shaper children are bioengineered to mature early and learn faster than their baseline counterparts known derogatively as the Unplanned. With so much money and effort put into breeding – in what is basically a case of survival of the best engineered – it is only natural that the Shapers have evolved into an aristocratic society where one’s genetic heritage is of great importance. It is suggested that augmented cognitive power has paved the way for a post-scarcity society, and it is therefore not surprising either that the Shapers worry a great deal about ageing and spend large sums of money on rejuvenation therapies.\n\nConcerns over economic growth play an important part in the book where data volume is used as a measure for progress. Humanity has clearly learned valuable lessons from Earth, now a marginalised backwater following an ecological collapse. An yet, not everyone is in favour of technology controls. The faction known as Cataclysts demand an end to all controls, favouring a super-charged neo-liberal agenda which recalls Charles Stross’ Accellerando (2005).\n\nJanuary 26, 2021\n\nIch las Schismatrix Anfang der neunziger Jahre mit so viel Begeisterung, dass ich den Roman viele Jahre als meinen Favoriten im Bereich der Science-Fiction empfohlen hatte. Wegen dieser damaligen Begeisterung gebe ich fünf Sterne. Nun habe ich den Band im Original erneut in die Hand genommen und bin immer noch sehr angetan.\n\nBeim heutigen Lesen fällt kaum auf, dass Bruce Sterling Schismatrix schon vor mehr als 30 Jahren geschrieben hat - im Genre eine Seltenheit. Das liegt daran, dass Sterling auf die heute ggf. veraltet erscheinende Beschreibung technischer Details entweder verzichtet - oder sie sind total abgefahren und daher zeitlos.\n\nSchismatrix wird als eines der bedeutendsten Werke des Subgenres des Cyberpunks angesehen, das in den achtziger Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts einen Hype erlebte und sich mittlerweile im Mainstream aufgelöst hat. Meiner Meinung nach passt aber eher das Label \"Posthumanism\". Schismatrix beschreibt die Entwicklung der Menschheit im Sonnensystem über einen Zeitraum von ca. 200 Jahren in einer nicht allzu fernen Zukunft. Im Zentrum steht die gesellschaftliche Diversifizierung ausgehend von zwei Hauptgruppen, den \"Shapern\" und den \"Mechanics\", in immer verschachteltere Untergruppen: \"Live moves in clades\".\n\nMan kann das Werk auch als Ode an die Jugend ansehen (Sterling war keine 30, als er es veröffentlichte): Eine Kernaussage besteht in der Sentenz: Bewegung (Weiterentwicklung) ist Leben, Stillstand ist Tod. Sinnbild für den Stillstand sind die Bewohner der Erde, die in der Schismatrix keine Rolle spielen und sich vom Rest durch ein \"Interdict\" abgeschottet haben. Sie haben sich nicht weiterentwickelt und werden im Roman nicht weiter erwähnt.\n\nMan kann das Werk auch als Antwort auf die Herausforderungen der Menschheit lesen, Herausforderungen, die immer wieder auftauchen, denen wir nie entkommen werden, so sehr wir uns auch bemühen, Sicherheit zu schaffen: Kriege, Klimawandel, Pandemien etc. Bruce Sterling zeigt in Schismatrix auf, dass solche Herausforderungen nur durch Weiterentwicklungen - technischer oder gesellschaftlicher Art - gemeistert werden können, nie durch Aussitzen und Rückzug. Diese Weiterentwicklung erlaubt es auch dem Protagonisten, dem Shaper-Diplomaten Abélard Lindsay, über knapp 200 Jahre immer wieder Katastrophen zu entkommen und Neues zu schaffen. Freunde, die weniger entwicklungsfreudig sind, bleiben auf der Wegstrecke.\n\nWegen seiner philosophischen Implikationen ist der Roman sehr lesenswert. Der Plot ist nur im ersten Teil spannend und actionreich, der sich um den jungen Lindsay dreht. Im zweiten und dritten Teil werden dagegen einzelne einschneidende Augenblicke des älter werdenden Lindsay beleuchtet. Sterling nutzt diese Szenen eher als Leinwand für seine Gesellschaftsskizzen. Spannend sind sie trotzdem wegen einem Überfluss an Ideen, mit denen uns Sterling beständig bombardiert.\n\nFazit: Klare Empfehlung für junge Leser wegen des optimistischen (Cyberpunk-untypischen) Grundrauschens und ebenso für ältere Leser, die sich mit den philosophischen Ideen auseinandersetzen wollen.\n\nJuly 13, 2020\n\nProbably more 3 1/2 than 4 for me, or maybe 3.75.\n\nI'm told this is a seminal Cyberpunk book. Well, there's a lot of punk, for sure, but it's very different from the other seminal work, the Sprawl series by William Gibson. I must say that after reading a ton of Sprawl-lookalike books and movies, this was a breath of fresh air.\n\nHowever I felt that it was *very* handwavy about the ultimate evolution of intelligence. According to the story, humanity eventually would reach a cusp and \"vanish\" - none of this is explained in any way, shape or form. The conclusion is very puzzling in that regard; it could be seen as some sort of allegory I suppose, but I dislike this kind of thing when it's not really justified by the rest of the text.\n\nSterling's prose flows easily, though it feels disconnected somewhat at times. The impression I'm left with is a set of medium-length novellettes connected through the main protagonist. The protagonist evolves somewhat but you don't get to see how. His archenemy is implied to die in a duel, then shows up later (disminished, but still) and all is forgiven. It's not the latter I disliked; I'm a sucker for redemption stories and learning to live with one's enemies. But too many people were presumed dead and show up again. Yet, not the hero's late wife.\n\nIt left me feeling a bit unsatisfied, as if death of some characters versus others was done just for the sake of exposing concepts and artificially creating drama, as opposed to following the universe's own rules.\n\nAlso the overuse of drugs bugged me. I don't think we'll even be able to design such \"drugs\" that so precisely alter one's personality or perception. But I guess that's the archaic part of the novel; that kind of thing was common in writings of those times.\n\nStill, despite my gripes, there's a lot to like about the book. Interesting take on human evolution. Earth abandoned for very depressing reasons. Everybody just bumbling along and trying to improve their lot, but with two very different camps at odds to one another. And then, surprise, aliens show up! That surprised me because I thought Cyberpunk was mostly void of aliens, but aliens make it even more interesting here.\n\nOverall, though, I feel that the novel is a bit disjointed. A solid read, but it didn't rock my world. Maybe I read it too late; when it came out it must've shattered quite a few preconceptions.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJuly 23, 2021\n\nMeriterebbe 2 stelle per la traduzione, o forse 1, e 4 per l'ambientazione e la storia.. quindi 3 nel complesso.\n\nHo sempre adorato l'ambientazione cyberpunk, dai film ai videogames, e quindi di recente ho voluto provare a colmare alcune lacune letterarie affrontando prima La matrice spezzata di Gibson e poi quest'altra pietra miliare del genere, La Matrice Spezzata, diSterling Bruce. Già con il Neuromante ho fatto una fatica immensa e temevo che fosse un limite mio, che non afferravo la storia per il modo difficile di scrivere dell'autore.. poi informandomi su siti con appassionati del genere ho inteso che il problema sono i due traduttori, Cossato e Sandrelli, che ahimè hanno tradotto anche questo Volume.\n\nHo fatto estrema fatica a portarlo a termine e temo che anche qui il problema sia la traduzione pessima, perché la storia in sé è affascinante e mi incuriosiva.. il mio consiglio quindi è di affrontarlo in lingua originale se ne avete la possibilità, io per un romanzo di questo tipo non me la sono sentita perché temevo fosse troppo complesso, ma probabilmente avrei capito di più che con questa traduzione in italiano. A titolo esemplificativo, ho iniziato a leggere l'antologia La notte che bruciammo Chrome, e il primo dei racconti, Johnny Mnemonico (da cui è stato tratto l'omonimo film) sempre di Gibson l'ho trovato godibilissimo e infatti in quel caso il traduttore è diverso, Delio Zinoni.\n\nNovember 13, 2022\n\nLibro piuttosto complesso...\n\nL'epopea postumana di Aberland Lindsay, attraverso vari habitat circumlunari, asteroidi intragalattici, pianeti terraformati e simili.. attraverso la battaglia tra Plasmatori (con le loro modifiche genetiche) e i Mechanix (coi loro impianti).. dopo un inizio apparentemente sconclusionato e un po' ostico, si entra nella storia, dalla trama un po' indefinita, ma ugualmente affascinante grazie al visionario genio creativo di Sterling.. nell'immaginare intere società postumane, con tanto di usi, costumi, mode, politiche e iterazioni sociali, filosofiche ed economiche, non ha uguali.. tirando dentro anche razze aliene o percorsi inimmaginabili.. con un finale all altezza dell'intera opera.. non per tutti, complesso e a momenti un po' criptico, accostabile per alcune cose a Accelerando di Stross, esprime tutto il futuribile potenziale della matrice umana nell'universo.. non per questo trascurando quelli che sono i sentimenti umani alla base della nostra natura.."
