        "text": "This summary of campaign activity in the 2017-2018 election cycle provides a benchmark for comparison with the same reporting period in previous cycles. Supporting data tables are linked at the end of each summary section below.\n\nI. Presidential Candidates\n\nAs of September 30, 2018, 43 individuals had filed campaign finance reports disclosing financial activity in connection with the 2020 presidential election. These candidates reported raising $66.6 million and spending $38.7 million from January 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018. Their combined cash-on-hand was $35.6 million, while their combined debt was $5.2 million as of September 30, 2018.\n\nData summary tables for reports submitted to the Commission through September 30, 2018 by 2020 presidential candidate committees can be found here.\n\nII. Congressional Candidates\n\nUnited States House and Senate candidates running in the 2018 election cycle reported raising a total of $2.3 billion and spending $1.8 billion between January 1, 2017 and September 30, 2018. Candidates for the two chambers reported combined total debts of $169.2 million and combined total cash-on-hand of $783.9 million as of September 30, 2018.\n\nThe following table summarizes campaign finance activity of House and Senate candidates through September 30 of election years since the 2007-2008 election cycle.\n\nThe 253 candidates running for Senate in 2017 and 2018 reported total receipts of $812.5 million, disbursements of $649.7 million, debts of $73.1 million and cash-on-hand of $241.1 million.

In addition to the 2018 primary and general elections, these numbers encompass financial activity associated with the 2017 special elections for California’s 34th Congressional District, Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, Kansas’s 4th Congressional District, Montana’s At-Large Congressional District, South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and Utah’s 3rd Congressional District, as well as the 2018 special elections for Arizona’s 8th Congressional District, Michigan’s 13th Congressional District, New York’s 25th Congressional District, Ohio’s 12th Congressional District, Pennsylvania’s 7th, 15th and 18th Congressional Districts, and Texas’s 27th Congressional District.\n\nData summary tables for reports submitted to the Commission through September 30, 2018 by 2017 and 2018 congressional candidate committees can be found here.\n\nI. Political Party Committees\n\nNational, state and local political party committees reported combined total receipts of $1.2 billion in federal funds, disbursements of $1 billion, debts of $24.6 million, and cash-on-hand of $241.3 million as of September 30, 2018. Of those totals, party committees other than the two major political parties reported receipts of $5.2 million, disbursements of $5.7 million, debts of $151,262, and a combined cash-on-hand of $1.2 million as of September 30, 2018. (See the footnote in the following table for a list of these other party committees.)\n\nThe following table summarizes 2017-2018 campaign finance activity of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), Republican National Committee (RNC), National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), as well as each party’s state and local committees and other party committees.\n\nIndividuals, for whom contributions to national parties were limited to $33,900 per year during the 2017-18 election cycle, were the largest source of federal funds for party committees’ traditional accounts. Democratic and Republican party committees reported receiving $419.5 million and $353 million, respectively, from individuals. PACs and other political committees contributed $67.9 million to Democratic party committees and $57.5 million to Republican party committees as of September 30, 2018.\n\nDemocratic and Republican House campaign committees transferred $27.4 million and $25.7 million, respectively, from their campaign accounts to their national congressional party committees. Committees representing Democratic Senate candidates transferred $1.4 million to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Committees representing Republican Senate candidates transferred $1.1 million to the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nProvisions of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 83), signed into law in December 2014, enable national party committees to establish accounts to defray certain expenses incurred with respect to Presidential nominating conventions, national party headquarters buildings, and election recounts and contests and other legal proceedings.\n\nThe resulting new accounts of national party committees reported receiving $138.3 million between January 1, 2017 and September 30, 2018. Of that total, the new Democratic national party committee accounts received $38.6 million, while the corresponding Republican national party committee accounts received $99.7 million. New accounts established by other national political parties reported no receipts.\n\nHeadquarters accounts reported the highest receipt total across all the newly established national party committee accounts: $94.8 million. New recount and convention accounts raised $33.7 million and $9.8 million, respectively, through September 30, 2018.\n\nData summary tables for reports submitted by political party committees to the Commission through September 30, 2018 can be found here.\n\nIV. Political Action Committees (PACs)\n\nBased on reports filed with the Commission from January 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018, 8,389 federal PACs reported total receipts of $3.6 billion, disbursements of $3.2 billion, debts of $33.2 million, and combined cash-on-hand of $966.8 million.\n\nThe following table summarizes campaign finance activity based on PAC type in 2017-2018. This table includes both separate segregated funds (SSFs), which have connected organizations such as corporations or labor organizations that establish, administer or raise money on their behalf, and nonconnected committees.\n\nContributions by PACs to presidential and congressional candidates seeking office in the 2017-2018 election cycle totaled $163,000 and $420.3 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2018. PAC contributions to Senate and House candidates totaled $74.3 million and $345.9 million, respectively. Independent Expenditure-Only Political Committees are prohibited from making contributions to candidates.\n\nData summary tables for reports submitted by PACs to the Commission through September 30, 2018 can be found here.\n\nv. Independent Expenditures\n\nIndependent expenditures reported to the Commission through September 30, 2018 in connection with presidential and congressional elections in the 2017-2018 election cycle totaled $570.9 million.* Independent Expenditure-Only Political Committees accounted for $320.3 million of all independent expenditures disclosed to the Commission, Committees with Non-Contribution Accounts reported $36.6 million, and other PACs reported $23.2 million. Independent expenditures made by persons other than political committees totaled $66.6 million, and party committees reported independent expenditures totaling $124.2 million.\n\nData summary tables for independent expenditure filings submitted to the Commission through September 30, 2018 can be found here.\n\n*A political committee must itemize its payments for independent expenditures once the calendar-year total paid to a vendor or other person exceeds $200 with respect to a particular election. Any other person (individual, partnership or group of individuals) must file a report with the FEC at the end of the first reporting period in which independent expenditures with respect to a given election aggregate more than $250 in a calendar year and in any succeeding period during the same year in which additional independent expenditures of any amount are made.\n\nVI. Electioneering Communications\n\nElectioneering communication filings totaling $10.5 million were reported to the Commission in connection with activity in the 2017-2018 election cycle. An electioneering communication is a broadcast, cable or satellite communication that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate and is publicly distributed within 30 days prior to a primary election or within 60 days prior to a general election. These communications are not expenditures or independent expenditures.\n\nThe data summary table for electioneering communication filings submitted to the Commission through September 30, 2018 can be found here.\n\nVII. Communication Costs\n\nA provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), allows corporations and labor organizations to communicate to a “restricted class” of individuals on any subject, including express advocacy of the election or defeat of any Federal candidate. The costs of such communications must be reported to the Commission when the cost exceeds $2,000 per election. This provision of the Act pre-dates the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, which struck down the ban on independent expenditures and electioneering communications financed by the general treasuries of corporations and labor unions.\n\nThe Commission received 39 such filings during the reporting period, disclosing spending of $2.4 million in costs for communications to organizations’ restricted class between January 1, 2017 and September 30, 2018.\n\nThe data summary table for communication cost filings submitted to the Commission through September 30, 2018 can be found here."
