        "text": "Our road was now one of continued enjoyment and it was pleasant riding among this assemblage of green pastures with varied flowers and scattered groves and out of the warm green spring to look at the rocky snowy peaks where lately we had suffered so much.\n\nJohn C. Fremont thus described California’s San Joaquin Valley on March 27,1844, as he approached the Stanislaus River at a point west of where Highway 99 now crosses it. While not the first non-Indian to enter the great Valley, the explorer was the first to do so under United States Government sanction. A lieutenant in the Topographical Corps, Fremont was charting the routes to and through California.\n\nHis party, which included Kit Carson and Broken Hand Thomas Fitzpatrick, had spent a rugged January and February crossing the Sierra in deep snow and with real hardships, coming close to starvation when snowbound for a month. After resting at New Helvetia (Sacramento), Fremont was enjoying thoroughly a spring ride on horseback south to Walker Pass over a route which gave him a sweeping view of the land now served by the Modesto Irrigation District.\n\nFremont waxed almost poetic in writing about the beauty of the landscape, commenting in his memoirs:\n\nThe lupine (is) a beautiful shrub in thickets, some of them being 12 feet in height. Occasionally three or four were clustered forming a grand bouquet about 90 feet in circumference and ten feet high. The whole summit was covered with spikes of flowers, the perfume of which is very sweet and grateful. A lover of natural beauty can imagine with what pleasures we rode among these flowering groves, which filled the air with a light and delicate\n\nHe described the live oaks as \"the most symmetrical and beautiful we had yet seen in this country\" and marveled at the California poppy \"of a rich orange color.\" In subsequent days as he moved through what now is Stanislaus County, Fremont noted that the beauty of the landscape \"had been increased by the additional animation of wildlife and now it is crowded with bands of elk and wild horses and along the rivers are frequent fresh tracks of grizzly bears, which are unusually numerous in the country.\"\n\nFremont was not the first to describe in writing the area between the Stanislaus and Tuolumne Rivers, which later was to be known as Paradise Valley. However, his words were among the most descriptive about its beauty and the richness of its soil.\n\nSpanish soldiers and mission priests earlier had visited the San Joaquin Valley. Among the first was Pedro Gages, who left the coastal missions in 1772 to search the southern Valley for Spanish Army deserters. He described the culture of the Yokuts Indians who populated the Valley from Bakersfield to Stockton in much more favorable terms than did some historians of a century or so later who based their descriptions of the \"digger\" Indians solely on the remnants of a people devastated by the invasion of the white man.\n\nEstimates of the number of Valley Yokuts range from Kit Carson’s 1829 figure of \"hundreds of thousands\" to what probably is the most authentic, 25,000 in 50 tribes. The latter estimate was made by the foremost authority on Yokuts, Frank Latta, who grew up in western Stanislaus County where his lifelong study of the Yokuts began.\n\nHeidi Warner, curator of Modesto’s McHenry Museum who has made an independent study of the Indians of Stanislaus County, has located more than 50 burial sites, some as large as 45 acres, evidence that the county’s Indian population was substantial.\n\nIn a forward to Latta’s handbook of Yokuts Indians, A. L. Kroeber, a University of California anthropologist who earlier had studied the Yokuts, describes them as \"a tall, well built people of open outlook…frank, upstanding, casual and unceremonious, optimistic and friendly, fond of laughter, not given to cares of property or too much worry about tomorrow; and they lived in direct simple relation to their land and world, to its animals, spirits, and gods, and to one another.\"\n\nThe Stanislaus River and Stanislaus County derive their name from an exceptional member of this race, Estanislao.\n\nEstanislao was born and raised at Mission San Jose. It is assumed his parents were Yokuts, for by 1790 the Spanish had swept clean of Indians all the western San Joaquin Valley foothills and plains from the Carquinez Strait to Kern County and as far east as today’s Highway 99. The Indians were taken to the missions presumably as \"neophytes\" for conversion to Christianity and to perform the hard labor for building and maintaining the missions.\n\nNamed for the Polish Saint Stanislaus, on whose birth date he was born, Estanislao received a good education at the mission and grew to be a tall – more than 6 feet – strong, intelligent leader. He rose to the position of alcalde, the mission’s chief administrative and judicial officer. In 1825 when the people of the mission pledged their allegiance to Mexico, Estanislao fled to the Valley, taking with him many Indian neophytes who had become disenchanted with mission life. Estanislao established his own tribal nation near the present location of Salida. From there, he raided missions and settlements.\n\nIn 1829 the Spanish sent two forces against him. The first was routed by the Indians. The second was led by Lieutenant Mariano G. Vallejo, who later as general became Mexican commandante of California. Vallejo was repulsed until he set fire to the woods surrounding Estanislao’s complex fortifications which included a system of trenches and barriers.\n\nHis forces literally burned out, Estanislao escaped and returned to Mission San Jose, where he was pardoned and lived until his death some seven years later.\n\nIn the spring of 1833 an epidemic variously believed to be cholera, measles, or malaria wiped out entire communities. A pioneer hunter and trapper, Colonel James J. Warner, had noted in 1832 there were hundreds of Indians living along the Tuolumne and Stanislaus Rivers about the San Joaquin River. Many villages had 50 to 100 buildings. When he returned in the fall of 1833, Warner saw only six or eight live Indians.\n\nThe first non-Indian to explore the Stanislaus area to any extent was Spanish Lieutenant Gabriel Moraga, who first crossed the Coast Range in 1806. Entering the Valley through the passes southwest of Los Banos, Moraga followed the San Joaquin River northward past the Merced, Tuolumne and Stanislaus Rivers, all of which he named. Only Rio de la Merced – River of Mercy – still is known by its original name. Moraga called the Tuolumne Rio Dolores and the Stanislaus Rio Laquismes. He also changed the name of Rio de la San Francisco to San Joaquin to honor his father, Jose Joaquin Moraga, who had entered the San Joaquin Valley from the north in 1776 and followed the river southward. It is not known if the elder Moraga reached the region now known as Stanislaus County.\n\nNot long thereafter, the fur trappers arrived from Hudson Bay and other companies in Canada and the United States. Traveling in groups of 50 to 100, they found a rich harvest of pelts along the Tuolumne, Stanislaus and other rivers of the Valley. Jedediah Smith, the first American to enter California, trapped along the Tuolumne from 1825 to 1827 and reported the stream abounding with beaver and salmon.\n\nIn 1842 Dr. John Marsh, who had purchased \"Ranchos los Meganos\" at the base of Mount Diablo in 1835, forecast a tremendous agriculture future for the San Joaquin and Sacrament Valleys, describing them as one magnificent valley…capable of supporting a nation\" but at the time inhabited by only 150 Americans and a few Indians.\n\nThe opinion was not shared universally. United States Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts in 1844 asked the United States Senate:\n\nWhat do we want of this vast worthless area, this region of savages and wild beasts, of deserts of shifting sands and whirlwinds of dust, cactus and prairie dogs' To what use could we ever hope to put these deserts or these endless mountain ranges, impenetrable and covered to their bases with eternal snow?\n\nWhat could we ever hope to do with the Western Coast of three thousand miles, rock-bound, cheerless and uninviting, with not a harbor in it? What use have we for such a country? Mr. President, I will never vote one cent of the public treasury to place the Pacific Coast one inch nearer Boston than it is today.\n\nEven as Webster spoke, the agricultural economy of the area that would become Stanislaus County and the rest of California was emerging. This economic base ultimately would make the Golden State the nation’s largest in agricultural production as well as in population.\n\nBetween 1836, when the Spanish secularized the missions, and 1846, when the Americans took control of the state, the Mexican Government issued some 30 land grants in California, specifically for agricultural purposes, primarily the raising of cattle. All but six of these grants subsequently were confirmed by the United States Land Commission, a process complicated by the vagueness by which they originally were measured and described. Descriptions were from \"this tree to that tree\" and measurements were by the \"length of a rawhide riata,\" which was subject to stretching. The grants were limited to a maximum of eight square leagues, a Spanish league being slightly more than 2.6 miles.\n\nFive grants were located in what now is Stanislaus County. Alfias Basil Thompson received 35,000 acres along both sides of the Stanislaus River between the present sites of Oakdale and Riverbank. It was on this ranch that William Tecumseh Sherman, the Union Army general who in 1864 led the scorched-earth march through Georgia, raised cattle during the 1850s. His partners were Fred Billings, Henry W. Halleck and A. C. Peachy.\n\nRancho Del Rio Estanislao on the north side of the Stanislaus, extending east from the Thompson Ranch well into Calaveras County for a total of 48,888 acres, was granted to John Rowland.\n\nThree grants were issued along the San Joaquin River. Velentin Higuerra and Rafael Feliz were granted 35,000 acres for the El Pescadero Ranch, which subsequently was the site of San Joaquin City, a river-streamer stopping place which was replaced by Vernalis with the coming of the railroad to the Valley’s West Side. This grant extended from about Banta to some distance below Grayson. Immediately to the south was the Rancho del Puerto – 13,000 acres granted to Mariano Hernandez – and farther up river, extending into what now is Merced County, was the Orestimba grant of 26,000-plus acres to Sebastian Nunes.\n\nOne of the most famous of these grants was Las Mariposa, which included the present towns of Mt. Bullion and Mariposa. Awarded in 1844 to the former Mexican governor of California, Juan Bautista Alvarado, it never was occupied by its original owner primarily because of the threat of Indians. In 1847, Fremont purchased the ranch, which was to be the site of the 1851 Mariposa Indian War. Fremont, the famed \"Pathfinder,\" resided there when in 1856 he became the first presidential nominee of the newly organized Republican Party, capturing some 40 percent of the popular vote for what then was considered a \"third party.\"\n\nCattle were the prime product of these ranches, many of which were not habitable until 1847 or later because of the constant threat of raids by marauding Indians which continued in some areas well into the gold rush days.\n\nOf the original five grants in Stanislaus County, it appears that only El Pescadero was occupied on a permanent basis during those early years. Higuerra and Feliz drove some 1,300 head of cattle, 350 sheep and 300 horses from the coast to locate there in 1843. They were the first permanent non-Indian settlers in the Stanislaus area.\n\nThe region’s first planned colony was established in January 1847 on the north bank of the Stanislaus River about a mile and a half above its junction with the San Joaquin. Two parties of Mormons, one headed by Samuel Brannan traveling by sea and the other led by William Stout going overland, joined to establish the City of New Hope. This was to be the destination of the Mormon people moving west to the \"promised land of California\" under the leadership of Prophet Brigham Young.\n\nIt is fascinating to speculate what the Stanislaus region would be like today had it not been for a chance meeting on the Oregon Trail.\n\nIn his Valley of the Sun, historian Wallace Smith tells how a pair of wild western mountain men, Jim Bridger and \"Peg-leg\" Smith, who had traveled extensively throughout the West, came across the main party of Latter Day Saints somewhere along the Platte River. The Mormon leader queried the pair about their San Joaquin Valley destination. So glowing were the accounts of Bridger and Smith, the Mormon prophet recalled his advance party from the City of New Hope. Young decided that any land which was as wonderful as the two mountain men claimed the Stanislaus River area to be would attract many, many people. Young and his church followers were seeking isolation from the \"gentiles\" who had persecuted them in the East. And so, the region was to develop in other ways.\n\nFree-ranging Castillian longhorns roamed the countryside in great numbers. This was stock stolen from the missions by marauding Indians, including bands of \"neophytes\" who had fled, as had Estanislao and his people. These longhorns were rounded up and branded by the early ranchers. The bands of wild horses mentioned by Fremont in his 1844 diary were from the same source.\n\nAt first, the market was not for meat, but for hides and tallow. Jack Brotherton in his Annals of Stanislaus County says the shipment of hides and tallow to San Francisco was responsible for the start of regularly-scheduled steamer trips up the San Joaquin and Tuolumne Rivers. The meat was left for the coyotes, vultures and other scavengers.\n\nThe American taste for beef during the gold rush changed this. Whole herds of cattle were driven to the mining camps from the Valley’s West Side and coastal ranches.\n\nA new breed of cattle which was to replace the scrawny, stringy Castillian longhorns came with the gold-seeking argonauts of 1849. Some enterprising settlers saw their fortunes not in the mining but in supplying the miners. Walter Crow brought the first midwestern American cattle to California in 1850 with a herd of 500. Crow died shortly after arriving in the state, but his four sons, James, William, Benjamin and Alfred, drove the cattle to the Stanislaus region where they established a ranch along Orestimba Creek. The family name is borne by the town of Crows Landing.\n\nFrom that time on, cattle were being driven into the state and Paradise Valley. By 1854 there were many thousands of cattle roaming free on the plains of Stanislaus. Early historian George H. Tinkham quotes cattleman William K. Wallis as reporting the county \"was one immense pasture.\"\n\nL. C. Branch, who in 1881 wrote the first history of Stanislaus County, included an autobiography by Wallis’ brother Thomas, who recounts his introduction to Paradise Valley cattle when traveling from San Francisco to join his brother in April 1863:\n\nWhen I arrived in Stockton, I found that no steamer would leave for the San Joaquin River for two weeks and, as there was no stage line or team coming this way, I concluded to come across the country afoot. There were no houses on the plains at the time, and wild cattle roamed over them at freedom in vast numbers. When traveling between the Stanislaus and Tuolumne Rivers, I saw a band of wild cattle coming toward me, shaking their heads. I immediately fell to the ground and crawled on my hands and knees for a long distance until they had lost sight of me. I afterward learned that they were infuriated by being caught and branded, and would have killed me had they caught me.\n\nEven as Wallis was crawling away from infuriated longhorns, the decline of the livestock industry was approaching. The extremes of weather and the influx of people doomed the Paradise Valley cattle industry.\n\nThe decline began with the devastating floods of the winter of 1861-62, which brought the entire economy of Northern California and much of the rest of the state to a halt. The floods were followed by three years of drought.\n\nTransportation into Stanislaus County became easier with the advent of river steamers and better roads. The population swelled with newcomers settling on the prime riverbottom land. In 1860 the census recorded 2,245 residents in Stanislaus County. By 1870 the population had tripled.\n\nThe new king was to be wheat.\n\nSo rapid was the rise in wheat production that within five short years, Stanislaus County’s production topped that of all California counties. The state was the nation’s leading wheat producer. Individual wheat farms of 50,000 to 100,000 acres were not uncommon in Paradise Valley.\n\nMidwesterners, some disillusioned with the mines and other coming to Stanislaus directly from their Plains States homes to seek a new life, found Central California land ideal for growing grains. The soil was fine loam easy to plow. The rainless summers from May to October meant no worries about showers at harvest time and the wheat heads were hard and dry. Once harvested, the wheat could be left sacked in the fields or in warehouses without worry. For many, farming proved to be more profitable than digging for elusive gold.\n\nAs early as 1850 the richness of soil had been recognized by a state legislative committee. It declared that the region around Tuolumne City, a community just emerging on the north side of the Tuolumne River a few miles above its junction with the San Joaquin River, \"will shortly be a sort of Jauja’, the golden city of the fabulous region where rivers of milk and honey flowed and farinaceous fruits grew spontaneously.\n\nA couple of years later, James C. Carson, an army sergeant who while on furlough explored the San Joaquin Valley and for whom the Carson River Pass are named, was more specific and much less flowery in his evaluation of the soil’s fertility:\n\nThe traveler crossing this valley or traversing it in any direction during the dry season would judge from its parched appearance that it is a barren waste unfit for any of the purpose of man. This was my opinion on my first visit but being a practical farmer, I had a curiosity to examine the soil, and the inducements offered by the general aspects of the country to agricultural pursuits.\n\nCarson referred to Central California as \"the garden of California.\"\n\nIn addition to the vagaries of weather and the influx of people, two factors were significant in the transition of Stanislaus’ farm economy from cattle to wheat. By 1864 the American Civil War had disrupted many traditional wheat-growing areas, thus opening European markets to California producers. Soon thereafter, the Franco-Prussian War created tremendous new demands for wheat to feed starving people on the European Continent. San Francisco financiers were quick to capitalize on these events by encouraging the planting of California wheat.\n\nAlthough wheat was firmly established as the county’s prime agricultural commodity by 1870, the crowning blow to the cattle industry came that year when the state’s \"no fence\" law was extended to Stanislaus County. This simply declared that farmers did not have to erect fences to keep livestock out. It was the responsibility of the stockmen to fence in their herds. Those cattlemen who actually owned land could not afford to enclose the vast acreages required for grazing. Many stockmen had no land to fence as their cattle roamed freely on unclaimed public domain.\n\nIn October 1870 the arrival of the railroad in Stanislaus County facilitated the shipment of the crop. On the 27th of that month, the first load of wheat to leave the San Joaquin Valley by rail was shipped from Modesto to Oakland by M. M. McClanathan.\n\nAlthough the boom in wheat production began in 1867, wheat had been grown in the county for a decade and a half. As early as 1852, when pioneer farmer Elihu Birrott Beard purchased 10,000 acres north of Waterford, farmers began experimenting with the production of wheat, barley and other crops, including produce for home consumption and for shipment by steamer to San Francisco.\n\nBeard, whose son Thomas K. Beard was to be instrumental in the 1913 creation of the Waterford Irrigation District, was the first farmer in 1852 to practice summer fallowing of the land for increased production. He encouraged the use of more efficient mowers, reapers and headers and in the 1860s introduced gang plows by which wheat growers could plow several furrows at once.\n\nAn inventory of new equipment was developed in the 1860s by the inventive farmers of Paradise Valley and surrounding areas.\n\nIn 1860, only 22,500 bushels of wheat were produced in the county. Production increased so fast that by 1870 more than 4 million bushels were harvested.\n\nA newspaper report in 1868 proclaims: \"That part of the county between the Stanislaus and Tuolumne Rivers, an area of 125 square miles and known as ‘Paradise’, is one unbroken field of grain.\"\n\nIn the expansive literary style of the period, historian Branch described what Paradise Valley was like in 1870:\n\nThis part of the county had, within a few years, developed into a rich agricultural region. The largest herds of cattle that once roamed over these plains had disappeared from view; the long horn of the Spanish steer was no longer in view. The farmer had taken the place of the vaquero, the plow the place of the lariat. The branding iron and the rawhide, the lasso and the rodeo had become relics of the past. The first bright gleams of the glamorous future were dawning over our people. The great valley had become a unit in interest and alike in feeling. Agriculture and grazing- the two conflicting interests – no longer crossed their swords in eternal warfare, but they were now united, led by a common interest. All had become stock breeders; all grain growers.\n\nIt is true there were no major battles between the cowboys and the sodbusters such as those occurring in other parts of the West. Circumstances had forced the change.\n\nThe droughts of 1873 and 1874 reduced production but did not discourage wheat farmers, who bounced back in 1875 to produce 3 million bushels – with 410,000 Stanislaus acres in production – then 5 million bushels the following year and 7 million bushels in 1878, a record unequalled until 1881.\n\nAs the new decade of the 1880s began, Branch wrote of traveling for hours through vast fields of wheat: \"In every direction was wheat, not a house, tree or object of any kind in sight, only wheat, wheat, wheat.\"\n\nOn this occasion, he described his first personal look at the Centennial Harvester, developed in 1876 by David Young of Stockton in response to requirements of growers in Stanislaus and elsewhere, in this manner:\n\nAt last our eyes caught sight of queer looking object in the distance, and curiosity as well as a desire to see something besides wheat, led us toward it.\n\nWe were astonished at the sight, and looked long in wonder and amazement at a combined header and thresher. Twenty-four horses were pushing this immense machine over the ground and as it passed along dropped sacks filled with wheat. The horses were six abreast – twelve each side the tongue – and the swath cut was, we judge, thirty feet wide. The grain heads in the meantime, instead of passing into the header wagon, went directly into the separator and the grain was sacked and thrown off. It was worth a long journey to see this wonderful machine with its twenty-four horses trained like circus animals, and all moving at the command of the man ‘at the wheel’ who guides the header by a tiller attached to a wheel at the end of the tongue which acts as a rudder for this ‘agricultural ship’.\n\nWhile watching its operations the writer wondered if on his next trip that way, he would not also see the grist-mill attached and the machine throwing off sacks of flour!\n\nOne of the first in Stanislaus County to use the Centennial Harvester was E. Cogswell, who in 1878 harvested 20,000 bushels of wheat from nearly 1,500 acres in 42 days.\n\nGrowing wheat was a tough, demanding occupation, especially at harvest time. The ground was plowed as soon as the first rains of the fall would permit. Once the wheat was sown, the success of the crop depended upon the weather. In a good year harvest crews would move in after the rains had ceased and the wheat heads had time to harden dry in the hot summer sun.\n\nHandling teams of 12 to 24 mules or horses was an art in itself, to which the muleskinner added an artistic vocabulary when things did not go right. In 1868 one Stanislaus muleskinner, Irwin S. Wright, simplified the task of controlling long teams when he invented the \"jerk line.\" He extended a single rein down the left side of the team, attaching it to the collar of the \"near leader\" in such a manner that a jerk would pull the animal’s head to the right and a steady pull would lead it to the left.\n\nCentral Californians who helped to expand the wheat yield with new machines included George Stockton Berry. Starting with a discarded portable steam engine, Berry built the first mechanically-driven combine. Benjamin Holt of Stockton invented the Caterpillar tractor. Although designed primarily to solve the problems of farming the San Joaquin- Sacramento River Delta peat soil, it soon became standard equipment for most farming operations in Stanislaus County. In World War I, the British worked with Holt to develop the first army tank.\n\nThe early combines were unique to the San Joaquin Valley because the vast acreages to be harvested made the huge machines practical; in eastern states where fields were smaller they would have been impractical.\n\nEven as the production reached its peak, new forces were working to promote more diversified farming.\n\nOra McHenry, L. M. Hickman, J. B. Caldwell and others were planting orchards, vines and vegetables. By the start of the last decade of the 19th Century, McHenry was the leader in the fruit industry, having some 100 acres in production. And at Paradise Gardens, three miles from Modesto, Peter Lesher in 1891 grew some 700 tons of fruit, primarily apricots but also including 200 tons of peaches and 8,000 boxes of Bartlett pears.\n\nThe same ingenuity, courage and determination that allowed the taming of a wild Valley wasteland, converting it to the state’s leading wheat region in a scant 30 years, were to shape the future of Paradise Valley and much of the rest of the state. This dramatic change was to come through the development of the first fiscally-sound system of irrigation by wisely using the water which flowed from the Sierra through California to the sea.\n\nBut it was not going to be an easy task.\n\nIn story and film, it was the cowboy who rode in off the prairie and shot up the town, but in the real life of Modesto the \"wild West\" era came with the wheat boom.\n\nStanislaus County was born in political strife. In those days, United States Senators were selected by state legislatures. The first of the California’s perennial north-south battles, which today are over the development and management of water resources, was over the selection of a U. S. Senator. As a result of an 1854 effort to \"pack\" the state Senate in favor of one candidate, Stanislaus County was born.\n\nThe adversaries both were Democrats. William M. Gwin was a well-educated physician, a Southern gentleman whose smooth political techniques followed the path of Andrew Jackson. His opponent was David C. Broderick, a glib Irishman who enthusiastically followed the rough-and-tumble politics of Tammany Hall.\n\nGwin had assumed leadership at the first California Constitutional Convention, and the state’s newly-created Legislature selected him and the \"Pathfinder,\" John C. Fremont, as the first U. S. Senators.\n\nBroderick wanted the job, which was held in higher esteem than that of governor. To achieve his ambition, Broderick attempted through legislative maneuvering, to cut Gwin’s term short by one year expecting to win the seat for himself. To insure a safer margin of victory, Broderick conceived the idea of creating a new county which would be controlled by Broderick Democrats.\n\nIt was an ironic April Fool’s Day joke on Broderick that while his dream child, Stanislaus County, came into being April 1, 1854, the Legislature had circumvented Broderick’s scheme by decreeing that the new county would share its state senator with Tuolumne County, from which it was separated.\n\nNot until 1857 did Broderick finally make it to the Nation’s Capitol, succeeding Senator John B. Weller, who had followed Mariposa’s Fremont. However, the Broderick-Gwin feud continued unabated and with increasing bitterness. The battle ultimately led to Broderick’s death in the last duel fought between major political figures in the United States. State Supreme Court Justice David S. Terry challenged Broderick and, in September 1859, Justice Terry won. After his death, Broderick’s faction of the Democratic Party swung to the Republicans and, as a result, Abraham Lincoln received the California electoral vote in 1860.\n\nFor the first few years, the Stanislaus County seat might as well have remained on wheels.\n\nAdamsville, where Dr. David Adams had established a ferry on the south bank of the Tuolumne River in 1849, became the first county seat by a margin of 30 votes – 495 to 465 – over Empire, which then claimed the honor of being the head of Tuolumne River navigation for entry to the southern mines.\n\nIn the absence of a county courthouse, the first Adamsville meetings of the new board of supervisors and the county Court of Sessions were held under a giant oak tree. According to Superior Judge David Bush, Adamsville never had a jail. Prisoners were housed in a convenient hotel. A new election a few months later found Empire victorious and the county seat was moved there, housed in a one-room shack. Fifteen months later, the \"courthouse\" was sold for $51 when the county seat was moved to La Grange.\n\nIn 1860 came \"Walden’s Steal,\" the annexation to Stanislaus County of 110,000 acres of San Joaquin County land, including the lively town of Knight’s Ferry. To this day, no one knows why the San Joaquin delegation allowed Stanislaus Assemblyman Miner Walden to engineer an annexation which placed Stanislaus’ northernmost tip north of the latitude of Stockton, which is San Joaquin County’s seat.\n\nAs soon as the annexation was consummated, Knight’s Ferry moved to obtain the county seat and won by a vote of 422-393 in September 1860 balloting. Thus, the county seat had moved three times in its first six years.\n\nIt stayed put for the next decade, however. Prior to the coming of the railroad, there was no Modesto. Not until 1870 was a one-square-mile town site laid out of the Central Pacific Railroad.\n\nGeorge Cosgrove, who at the time was working as railroad construction foreman Jim Casey’s \"rouster monkey\" even though he had not yet entered his teens, recalled in an October 1928 letter the naming of the new town:\n\nTom (one of the engineering staff) at irregular places laid out town sites, apparently for no better reason than that the (railroad) line cut a section on its catawampus course in an awkward shape for a farm.\n\nSince Tom concluded to make a township of it, Modesto’s arc was mapped in pencil. I then marked sheets of Tom’s valued paper with the stylus, making a map in ink. It looked, of course, better to me than to anyone else. I wanted to finish the map by putting a name on it. Asked everyone for a name, even the Chinese boss. Several names were suggested which would not look well in print. The weather was hot and the sand did blow. As I became a pest and was rousted out of every camp gathering, Charlie Crocker, Mark Hopkins and W. C. Ralston (Central Pacific’s founders and directors) came down with engine bell ringing constantly when moving, the track was so rough.\n\nThey spent half a day with Casey and when ready to start back, Mr. Hopkins noticed the stakes which marked the block boundaries of the town and remarked, \"What’s this, a new town?\" The pest was there proudly carrying the map which no one else had noticed. I proceeded to unroll the map and said they needed a name for the town. Heedless of the side kick from Casey, I held the map exposed to the big bosses who seemed interested, which prevented a more pronounced kick from Casey.\n\nHopkins said, \"Name it Ralston\" and Ralston said, \"I thank you for the honor but must ask that some more appropriate name be chosen.\" Tony, the dapper supercargo of the Mexican employees, exclaimed audibly \"Esta senor is mucho modesto.\" Crocker remarked, \"That’s a good name\" and Modesto was placed on the map.\n\nIn 1870 when it was certain the railroad was coming, a mass exodus took place in the nearby river-front towns of Paradise and Tuolumne City. A week after James McHenry’s house was to arrive in the new town, it was described as a \"village of 12 or 15 buildings, all crowded, and doing a lively business.\" Even before the \"mobile\" buildings arrived, the first new structure was erected – a saloon. Next came the schoolhouse, moved in from Tuolumne City. Such were the priorities of early-day Modesto.\n\nThe Tuolumne City Hotel, operated by Mr. and Mrs. D. S. Husband, was hoisted on wheels and moved in one piece. Even before the building was lowered from its wheels, Mrs. Husband opened for dinner that evening in the renamed Modesto House. A few days later, The Ross House in Paradise was cut in half and hulled to its new location, but not without misfortune. The Tuolumne City News reported October 21, 1870:\n\nOn Monday last, the dining room was successfully loaded on trucks and a team of 60 horses attached thereto, they had not proceeded over an hundred yards, however, when the wheels of the trucks sank in the soft sand, and at latest news still remained stationary. More powerful apparatus has been sent for, and it is to be hoped that the move will be successfully made.\n\nIn November, Tuolumne City Weekly News publisher J. D. Spencer packed his type cases and moved his shop and press to the new town. For weeks, Spencer had refused to accept the name of Modesto, referring to \"Ralston, alias Modesto,\" insisting Ralston would have to submit to the will of the people and allow the town to be named for him. William C. Ralston had made his fortune in Mariposa’s Marble Springs Mine, from which he recovered enough gold to build San Francisco’s Palace Hotel, establish the Bank of California and become a railroad financier.\n\nWhen Spencer moved to Modesto he changed the name of his paper to the Stanislaus County News, avoiding reference to Modesto.\n\nAs Modesto grew, so did the pressure to move the county seat. With the general election of 1871 approaching, the contest became bitter. Friends of Knight’s Ferry claimed the fledging town was not a suitable place for a county seat:\n\nThere is nothing inviting in the location; no trees, no scenery, no water courses, situated upon a plain, and most objectionable of all is the sand, of which the land is principally composed in its immediate vicinity, that is hurled in dense clouds through the air by the prevailing westerly winds that blow during the greater part of the year.\n\nAside from that, opponents of the railroad town saw no excuse for the taxpayers again having to bear the expense of moving the county seat, which already had wandered around too much in the few short years of Stanislaus’ existence.\n\n\"To remove it (the county seat) now would be premature, suicidal, detrimental and fraught with the most injurious consequences to the best interests of the county. How long will it be before Modesto will share the fate of Tuolumne and Paradise Cities?\" asked those who forecast the demise of Modesto when the railroad moved on south across the Tuolumne.\n\nSo bitter were some foes of Modesto that they even proposed eliminating Stanislaus County, ceding that area north of the Stanislaus River back to San Joaquin, creating a new county from the Stanislaus and Merced County areas west of the San Joaquin River and giving the remainder to Merced County.\n\nIn spite of its vociferous opposition, Knight’s Ferry did not have the votes. Modesto outpolled the then-county seat by a margin of almost 3-to1, with scattering votes cast for Oakdale, Waterford, La Grange and Graysonville.\n\nThe Stanislaus County New, on October 20, 1871 described the arrival of the county seat:\n\nOn Sunday last, the furniture, records, safes and all the rest of the paraphernalia of the county clerk’s, recorder’s, auditor’s, treasurer’s and sheriffs offices reached this place – the whole forming three wagon loads. Its arrival in our town created some little sensation among the naturally inquisitive citizens.\n\nA glimpse of the furniture would be sufficient at once to assure the stranger that our county had been in economical hands. Everything wore a plain and well-used appearance, showing conclusively that there had been no \"ring\" nor fat jobs in the furnishing department of this county. A rusty, old iron box, resembling much in size and appearance an old-fashioned sailor’s chest, with bands of iron around it, was pointed out to us as having been the first treasurer’s safe for the county. The old box is itself a relic of former times. Its age may be unknown, and its appearance leads us to believe that it was manufactured when burglars were not as adept in their professions as at present.\n\nModesto did not \"fade away,\" as forecast by the dire predictions of Knight’s Ferry proponents. Instead, as wheat became king in the decade of the 1870s, Modesto blossomed into a wealthy boom town where money flowed freely. The town soon became not only the largest in the county, but also on occasion it had the reputation of being the toughest in the state.\n\nWheat production was a rich but rough business, demanding high finances and strong labor throughout the season, especially at harvest time. This breed of worker and the riches of the harvest were followed by a less-than savory element.\n\nSol P. Elias, for several years mayor of Modesto during the 1920s, wrote Stories of Stanislaus, one of the most colorful and oftquoted histories of the region. His book tells of Modesto \"Golden Age:\"\n\nLike every frontier village that grew up with a rush and experienced unexampled prosperity from the start – thereby attracting to its confines the rougher elements of society who sough opulence without honest endeavor amidst the primitive customs and the open life of a rudely and rapidly constructed town – Modesto, in its infancy, suffered its period of open lawlessness, its era of unbridled gambling, its reign of brutal thuggery, its sway of the malign saloon influence, and its season of brazen, flaunting vice…\n\nSuch was the strenuousness of its nightlife that it held the reputation throughout the state of being a place in which there was literally a man served up for breakfast every morning in the year…\n\nMoney in plentitude was spent with recklessness and prodigality that baffled understanding…Modesto was in its golden age… The Barbary Coast had been transferred to Modesto. It was a \"coast\" that well maintained the reputation of its prototype in hilarity, in criminality and in petty thievery. (Its) establishments contained a number of private rooms…\n\nThe town grew so uncontrollably fast – there was no such thing as zoning – that all the mixed elements were thrown together. Chinese opium dens and gambling houses were in the middle of the business and residential districts, as were the red-light sections. Saloons were everywhere.\n\nThe saloon element dominated politics in Modesto and throughout Stanislaus County. Saloon keepers controlled and delivered enough votes to maintain this balance.\n\nA large measure of lawlessness prevailed throughout the decade, but peaked in 1879 when a bumper crop followed two years of drought. In that year, counter forces went to work. The San Joaquin Regulators, masked vigilantes whose identities supposedly were never known but who privately were recognized as some of the leading businessmen and \"law and order\" politicians of the era, were organized. After six months of planning, the Regulators struck on a Saturday evening in August 1879. By the time the northbound train left the next morning, the bulk of the criminal element was on its way out of town. \"Law and order\" prevailed for only a short time, though. In a few months, it was \"business as usual.\" Saloons outnumbered churches by more than 2-to-1.\n\nAn 1880 inventory of the community included one flour mill, two large breweries, a soda factory, one foundry, two lumber yards, six blacksmith and wheelwright shops, four livery stables, six hotels, three restaurants, 15 saloons (exclusive of hotel bars), two undertakers, six laundries, two photograph galleries and some two dozen stores that included five millinery shops, two jewelers, three butcher shops, a vegetable and produce market, four druggists and four tailor shops.\n\nAdd seven churches, six physicians, 14 lawyers, two dentists, several music and elocution instructors, two newspapers, and a hook and ladder company in need of a fire engine.\n\nElias’ description of the town in the late 1880s, however, includes this comment:\n\nIt was a typical rough and ready country village with ungraded streets and unplanked sidewalks, without city water or street illumination. The first glimpse of the town was uninviting. In the summer, the streets were covered with knee deep sand. In the winter, they were overlaid with mud and water puddles. Cattle of all descriptions roamed through the streets at will. (Historian George H. Tinkham noted that free-roaming hogs also were a problem in the town.) Fire protection was confined to the old hook and ladder company. There was little semblance of law and order.\n\nTwo of the state’s most infamous desperados associated with the Stanislaus region were not active in that period, however.\n\nIt was on Stanislaus River diggings that Joaquin Murietta’s beautiful young wife was raped and fatally beaten, which resulted in Murietta’s embarking on a course of revenge. Within a few months, death had come not only to the five Americans who had ravaged his wife but also to the 20 who had lynched his brother on an accusation of horse stealing. From then until his own death in 1853, Murietta was a bandit feared throughout California.\n\nChris Evans of the notorious Sontag and Evans gang operated a livery stable in Modesto when an 1891 fire destroyed all of his stock. A short time later, a train was held up at Ceres and Evans was accused of being the robber. Although subsequently identified with many other crimes committed after the fugitive teamed up with John Sontag, Evans never admitted the Ceres train robbery nor was his involvement in it ever proved.\n\nThe Stanislaus region had more than its share of colorful characters in the early days. Among them was James Capen Adams, better known in film and television as \"Grizzly Adams\" and described by P. T. Barnum as an \"extraordinary man, eminently ‘a character’.\"\n\nAn 1849 argonaut from Massachusetts, Adams earned and lost three fortunes in the mines and on Valley farms before taking to the hills along the Tuolumne River. Adams captured and tamed some two dozen grizzly bears. Included were his constant companion, Ben, a grizzly with whom he ate and slept; General Fremont, trained as a pack animal and, according to Barnum, ridden by Adams through hundreds of miles of the Sierra, and the 1,500-pound Sampson, the biggest of his menagerie.\n\nAdams and his animals toured the nation with Barnum and independently until his last performance in San Francisco in 1880.\n\nThese were the influences which affected Stanislaus and its county seat in the decade of the 1880s. A host of diverse personalities ranging from Murietta to Fremont, from General Sherman to inventive muleskinners, from the worst criminal elements to the vigilante Regulators left their mark on the community.\n\nIt was to be in the decade of the ‘80s that the people of Stanislaus, still the king of California wheat, came to the realization that irrigation was necessary to insure a more stable farm economy, especially in dry cycles, and to permit the diversification of agriculture.\n\nThat the concept of community-owned irrigation, where the land truly owned the water – a concept to be followed throughout the rest of the state and much of the nation – should come from a relatively small frontier community of no more than 2,000 people, attests to the inspiration and determination of the people of Modesto and the immediate area around it.\n\nWe have the climate; we have the soil of a first class country; but, for the want of that water which runs to waste at our very doors, and which a little sagacity and industry could make pour itself over our rich earth, we are living in a comparative desert, and are becoming notorious for our poverty.\n\nThis was the November 3, 1871, editorial comment of John Dillard Spencer, publisher of the Stanislaus County News and one of the strongest proponents of irrigating the lands of Paradise Valley. He was describing the Stanislaus scene and dilemma of the day.\n\nIn reality, Stanislaus County already was ascending to recognition as California’s king of wheat, a most profitable crop. However, the vagaries of weather would force many smaller farmers to consider diversification for better, more profitable crops. That could be accomplished only through the development of a workable irrigation system.\n\nIrrigation was not invented in California, nor for that matter in America. Irrigation had been practiced for thousands of years. The Tigres and Euphrates Rivers in the Middle East and the Nile in Egypt had been diverted by ancient people to water fields. Greek and Roman empires developed irrigation systems.\n\nEvidence has been found of irrigation systems dating to prehistoric times in Arizona’s Salt River Valley, which is the location of an early U. S. Bureau of Reclamation irrigation development, the 250,000-acre Salt River Project.\n\nWhen Spanish explorers first entered the Pacific Southwest in 1545 they found Indians irrigating in the Rio Grande Valley as they apparently had done for generations. Missionary priests coming to the New World appreciated the value of irrigation and located missions close to sources of water. In 1771 Father Junipero Serra relocated Mission Monterey to take advantage of a better source of irrigation water. That same year, Mission San Jose dammed a river to divert water for crops. It is said that within hours after the Mormons arrived at Salt Lake in 1847, they were digging irrigation ditches. The State of Utah in 1865 became the first in the nation to enact irrigation district laws, although they were used very little.\n\nEarly California settlers and gold miners dug ditches to water small fields, run sluice boxes and serve hydraulic mining operations. But these were individual efforts.\n\nThe potential for larger systems was evident, however.\n\nOnly six months after Stanislaus County was created, Silas Wilcox issued his first official report as county surveyor: \"The plains in this county could be irrigated by taking water from the rivers running through it as the foot of the mountains by means of canals.\" He went on to say, however, the idea was not \"expedient\" because of the \"great expense,\" an insufficient number of consumers and the belief that windmills would provide sufficient water for this purpose. These convictions were held by some farmers for the rest of the 19th century.\n\nThe first irrigation systems to be developed in California were privately owned, starting with James Moore’s Ditches diverting Cache Creek water to Yolo County farms. Established in 1856, this small beginning was to become nearly a century later the Yolo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, formed in 1951. During the late 1850s and 1860s, several water companies were created, many of those in Central California utilizing abandoned mining ditches.\n\nIn the 1860s irrigation pioneer Will Green devised a canal system to serve the Colusa area from the Sacramento River. The estimated $350,000 cost was beyond the ability of the local community, so the plan was turned over to the state Legislature for consideration. By the time that body revised the plan, the scheme involved a 100-foot-wide navigation canal costing nearly $12 million. The idea was abandoned in 1866 as too grandiose.\n\nIt would be a German immigrant who arrived in San Francisco in 1851 with only $5 in his pocket who was to develop San Joaquin Valley’s largest privately-owned irrigation works. A butcher by training. Henry Miller followed his trade rather than search for gold. Within a year, he owned shops in San Francisco and soon was acquiring his own supply of livestock for his retail and wholesale business. In the mid-1850s he rode through Pacheco Pass to the San Joaquin Valley and promptly purchased the 9,000-acre Santa Rita Ranch near Los Banos and 7,500 head of cattle.\n\nUltimately, he and his partner, Charles Lux, were to own 400,000 acres stretching for more than 100 miles along the San Joaquin River from where Highway 99 today crosses it north of Fresno to the vicinity of Crows Landing in Stanislaus County. The partnership also owned 70,000 acres on the Kern River in the vicinity of Tulare Lake and vast holdings elsewhere in Northern California. Pasture was the sole use of the land until the droughts of the 1860s when Miller, the dominant partner, turned to irrigation to raise feed for stockpiling.\n\nIn 1871 the San Joaquin and Kings River Canal Company was organized. When the San Francisco speculators behind the project found themselves in over their heads, Miller and Lux, who controlled the San Joaquin River’s riparian water rights, bought the company at a small fraction of the original investment in works already constructed. Miller was the driving force behind completion of a canal 45 feet wide, four feet deep and 75 miles long, extending from a diversion point near Firebaugh to Orestimba Creek, four miles south of Patterson. It was from this project that Stanislaus County farmers received their first canal water to irrigate 10,000 acres in the vicinity of Crows Landing.\n\nAlthough Miller & Lux Company operations would give impetus to the irrigation district movement a decade later, the presence of this canal caused the failure of California’s first serious proposal for public ownership of an irrigation system where the land would own and control the water it used.\n\nIn the spring of 1875, 50 Grange delegates representing counties from Fresno to Contra Costa met in the western Stanislaus community of Grayson for a two-day convention to discuss ways of irrigating lands west of the San Joaquin River.\n\nOut of this meeting came legislation signed April 3, 1876, by Governor William Irwin that created the West Side Irrigation District, designed to construct a canal from Tulare Lake to Antioch, a distance of 187.5 miles. Engineering studies proved the $4.3 million project would provide water for more than 340,000 acres. A new concept in irrigation development which would be fundamental to the success of future irrigation district proposals was introduced. All water rights would be inseparable from the lands to be irrigated.\n\nDirectors were chosen and taxes approved by the electorate. But on the day in May 1876 that the governor and other dignitaries were celebrating establishment of the district in a major festival held in the Town of Grayson, the California District Court declared the authorizing legislation to be unconstitutional because it permitted the condemnation of Miller & Lux’s San Joaquin and Kings River Canal Company system that extended through the area to be served by the new district.\n\nAlthough the West Side Irrigation District failed two years before Miller & Lux’s canal reached its southern terminus in 1878, the concept of marrying the rights to water with ownership of the land through the establishment of a public district prevailed. This concept became a key element in the subsequent Wright Act, under which the Modesto Irrigation District was created more than a decade later.\n\nWhile west side farmers were trying their hand at developing a publicly-owned irrigation district, on the east side of Stanislaus County the owner of a private dam and canal system was trying to win government support and subsidy for completing and extensive irrigation system served by the Tuolumne River.\n\nIn 1852 a group of San Francisco financiers constructed a dam for hydraulic mining diversions near La Grange. The sturdy structure had withstood many floods, including the disastrous 1861-62 runoffs which devastated much of Northern California.\n\nM. A. Wheaton, a San Francisco lawyer, subsequently acquired full title to the dam and adjacent ditches. As mining waned, he created the Tuolumne Water Company for irrigation diversions. Wheaton’s plan envisioned 200 miles of main and branch canals extending down both sides of the Tuolumne River to the San Joaquin. The scope of the project was far beyond Wheaton’s willingness to finance and he conceived a scheme whereby Stanislaus County would subsidize the private corporation by issuing $300,000 in bonds as a loan to the company.\n\nIn February 1872 Senator T. L. Keys of Stanislaus County submitted a Senate bill based on this plan, \"An Act for the Encouragement of Irrigation.\" Upon introduction of his bill, Senator Keys presented petitions signed by 130 supporters. In a rather unusual turn of events, he also presented the Senate with another petition signed by 400 opponents who feared higher taxes would result and objected to the county subsidizing a private company.\n\nThe Stanislaus News, an outspoken advocate of public irrigation systems, editorialized against Wheaton’s plan because government \"should not depart from the purpose for which it was created\" and making the county a \"banker\" for a private corporation was not a proper purpose of government.\n\nThe bill received little or no consideration.\n\nFor the next five years, irrigation was discussed. Meetings were held, but nothing positive was accomplished. Severe droughts in the late 1860s had demonstrated the need for irrigation in Paradise Valley. During the 1870s, however, farmer enthusiasm for the idea rose and fell in direct relation to the dryness or wetness of the rainy season.\n\nIn a letter to the Stanislaus Weekly News, published July 7, 1876, Wheaton again proposed the creation of a private stock company to purchase the dam and its canals, offering to sell \"for just what it has cost me, which is not a tithe of its actual value.\" Again he suggested the shareholders in the company be limited solely to owners of land to be served and that each be allowed to acquire only as many shares as the number of acres of land owned, adding, \"Land which has no stock subscribed for it shall have no water.\"\n\nA drive to raise volunteer funds to achieve this goal began early in 1877. Involved were many community leaders, such as rancher and banker Robert McHenry and others who subsequently played vital roles in the ultimate establishment and operation of the Modesto Irrigation District.\n\nWilliam H. Hall, who had completed the West Side Irrigation District engineering surveys the previous year, was hired. Hall submitted a most enthusiastic report at an April 4, 1977, meeting presided over by A. G. Carver, a sailor from Maine who abandoned the sea to search for gold, then in 1868 turned to farming. Carver later was to serve as president of the MID Board of Directors.\n\nHall’s proposal again embodied the concept of bringing \"the land and the water together in joint ownership,\" which he first had advanced for the ill-fated West Side Irrigation District. The corporation was organized, to be activated when 40,000 shares – one per acre – were pledged. The goal was never reached. No more than 1,300 shares were signed.\n\nIn 1878 the Legislature authorized the creation of a Modesto Irrigation District, a quasipublic landowners’ corporation to be subsidized by the county. This proposal contained, for the first time, provisions, for the sale of surplus water to generate electrical power. Apathy prevailed once more and the corporation was never formed.\n\nAs the years passed, the pressure for irrigation continued. Various proposals were submitted to the Legislature while farmers close enough to the rivers dug their own private ditches. Stanislaus County reports of 1881 show there were 26 miles of irrigation ditches in operation.\n\nThen in 1886 Miller & Lux re-entered the picture.\n\nWhen California joined the Union, its Constitution was based on English common law, which included riparian water rights. In brief, these provided that the owner of land bordering a stream had a right to use the water of that stream. State courts subsequently confirmed that this right included use of the water for irrigation. Gold miners did not accept this rule. Instead, they simply posted notices \"appropriating\" the water for sluices and hydraulic mining, a practice approved in 1872 by the Legislature. Thus, California law possessed two conflicting approaches to the use of natural flowing water, one constitutional and one legislative.\n\nJames B. Haggin owned thousands of acres of land between Bakersfield and Tulare Lake, but he held no riparian water rights. He built a canal and \"appropriated\" his irrigation water from the Kern River.\n\nAs riparian owners along the Kern River, Miller & Lux sued to block the diversions. The Kern County court decided in favor of Haggin, finding that the lack of rainfall demanded that water be taken away from riparian lands if the rest of the region was to be developed. The California State Supreme Court reversed this decision in 1886, upholding Miller & Lux’s riparian rights.\n\nThis meant that if Paradise Valley farmers not adjacent to the rivers ever were to get water, some public system had to be developed.\n\nIn fact, the Miller & Lux decision caused such consternation among farming communities throughout the state that Governor George Stoneman called a special session of the Legislature early in the summer of 1886. Some of the Supreme Court justices were accused of incompetence, but nothing was done.\n\nHall, by now the state engineer, published several reports attacking the riparian laws as unsuited to the environment of the West and opposed to the public welfare. Once again, he urged the development of a system by which the land and the water rights could be married, as he had advocated in earlier reports.\n\nIt was this climate that the state legislative election of 1886 was held. Both political parties in Stanislaus County were dedicated to the cause of irrigation. C. C. Wright, a La Grange schoolteacher who had become a most successful self-taught lawyer and served as district attorney, accepted the Democratic Party nomination for state assemblyman. His sole purpose was to achieve the enactment of a workable irrigation district law. This was his only campaign promise and he was elected by a substantial majority.\n\nOn January 11, 1887, Wright introduced a bill to authorize the creation of irrigation districts. These would be subdivisions of the State of California much as are counties and school, fire and other special districts. Boards of directors chosen by popular election would have the power to assess and tax all property within the district. One major difference between irrigation districts and the other special-purpose agencies was in the apportionment of the divisions from which each director would be elected. They were divided not only by population, but also by area. This departure of the \"one-man, one-vote\" doctrine has been upheld by the courts as recently as 1967.\n\nIn those days, the Legislature moved with considerably more speed than at present and the proposal was given unanimous approval by the Assembly on February 18. The state Senate took immediate action, amending the bill to strengthen the declaration that the use of water for irrigation is a public purpose and to safeguard existing rights on streams. The bill passed the Senate February 25th without a dissenting vote. On the following day the Assembly concurred in the amendments.\n\nMiller & Lux and Haggin, still battling in the courts, united in a last-ditch effort to obtain a veto. In spite of the unanimous vote in both houses of the Legislature, Governor Washington Bartlett was wavering. Veto demands by Miller & Lux, Haggin and other \"water monopolists,\" as they were labeled by the San Francisco Chronicle, were self-defeating. The governor was convinced such vigorous opposition from these people meant the bill must have substantial merit. He signed it on March 7, 1887.\n\nWright, who was 38 at the time, returned home to be met by a large, enthusiastic crowd which escorted him to his home with \"pomp and ceremony.\" Although Wright was to practice law in Modesto for eight more years before moving to Los Angeles, the Iowa native did not seek state office again. He served one term for a single purpose, a good irrigation law, which he had achieved. In later years, attorney Wright defended the act in the United States Supreme Court.\n\nWith passage of the Wright Act, the stage finally was set for the development of successful publicly-owned irrigation districts. It also was set for legal and political battles which were to plague the Modesto district for a decade and a half.\n\nParadise Valley weathered the transition from cattle raising to \"sodbusting\" without the range war popularized in song and film of the \"Old West,\" but the change from dry farming to irrigation was not so easy. Interrelated fiscal and legal problems, each feeding on the other, were to plague the Modesto Irrigation District for the next decade and a half.\n\nExcept for a single incident reported by the Modesto Evening News of June 7, 1889, in which a Modesto Irrigation District attorney \"implanted a blow on Judge Schell’s nasal organ which caused the claret to flow,\" there was no record of violence such as was experienced in other areas during California’s early days of irrigation development.\n\nLines were drawn between the pro-irrigationists, generally small farmers and city folk whose economic health depended upon an expanding agricultural base, and their opponents, primarily the larger farmers producing vast quantities of grain in traditional ways. Intense battles between the two factions were waged in the courts and by the ballot boxes.\n\nThe large wheat farmers liked things as they were. They needed no other reason to oppose change.\n\nProfessor Elwood Mead, in a comprehensive report on irrigation in California – U. S. Department of Agricultural Bulletin 100, published in 1901 – commented on this aversion to change:\n\nMen pride themselves on great undertakings and on doing what they undertake on a large scale. Wheat can be grown that way…It is an industry freed from detail…It has none of the petty incidents that go with the management of chickens and pigs, where cows are to be milked, and butter and eggs marketed, where each month has its duties, and where there is no time when something does not need attention.\n\nThis sort of farming comes with high-priced land and a dense population, but it does not appeal to the imagination like the plowing of fields so large that turning a single furrow requires a day’s journey, or the cultivation of the ground with steam plows and harrows which require five mule teams to operate them. The cutting, thrashing and sacking of grain in a single operation is spectacular as well as effective. In this respect, it resembles the range cattle business in its best days…\n\nThe cowboy on horseback was an aristocrat; the irrigator on foot was groveling wretch. In cowboy land, the irrigation ditch has always been regarded with disfavor because it is the badge and symbol of a despised occupation. The same feeling, but in a less degree, has prevailed in the wheat-growing districts of California for much the same reason.\n\nThat Mead’s evaluation of the aversion to change was especially true in Paradise Valley was confirmed personally by George Stoddard, who was deeply involved in the development of irrigation in the Modesto area from his arrival here in 1885. Stoddard, who served first as collector and then as treasurer of the MID from 1894 until 1943, made the observation in a 1942 interview with Benjamin Franklin Rhodes, Jr., who was then preparing a University of California doctoral thesis.\n\nAfter the March 7, 1887, signing of Assemblyman Wright’s California Irrigation Districts Act, the organizers of the Modesto Irrigation District moved quickly, but opponents moved even greater speed.\n\nOn April 25th, organizers circulated a petition calling for formation of the district. Seventy-three property owners endorsed the proposal. However, 11 days earlier before any formal move was made to create a district, opponents were in the field petitioning against the idea. One hundred six people, representing farms from eight to 3,720 acres in size that averaged between 400 and 500 acres per farm, signed the opposing petition dated April 14, 1887. The largest farm was that of Christopher Columbus Baker, who was to lead the opposition for nearly 15 years, even while serving 11 years on the district’s board of directors.\n\nBaker and another person whose name was to become synonymous with litigation in opposition to the district, William Tregea, were prominent in the formal hearings held before the Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors. Tregea, a Modesto harness maker whose trade allied him closely with owners of large farms, apparently foresaw the strong support which city voters would give to formation of the district. He thus made a strong appeal for its exclusion on the ground that city property would not benefit from irrigation as required for inclusion by the Wright Act. Countering Tregea’s contention was a formal request from the Modesto Town Council that the city be included. This issue was to become the basis for litigation which ultimately reached the U. S. Supreme Court.\n\nBaker and other opponents contended further that increased taxes would create unfair burdens without matching benefits and offered a rather novel contention that people with mortgaged property were not true \"freeholders\" as specified by the Wright Act. Thus, their names should be stricken from the organizing petition. To have done so would have invalidated the petition because many irrigation supporters were living on and farming mortgaged land.\n\nThese arguments and a challenge to the basic constitutionality of the Wright Act were to be the foundation for lawsuits which would not be resolved until after the turn of the century.\n\nAfter four days of hearings and a field trip to view the area proposed for inclusion in the Modesto Irrigation District, the county supervisors, in spite of the vigorous opposition, called for an election on July 9, 1887.\n\nTregea’s fears proved all too valid. Overwhelming support by the people of Modesto carried the election with a favorable vote of 700 to 156, far exceeding the required two-thirds majority. In creating divisions for the election of directors to serve the proposed district, much of the town of Modesto had been assigned to Division 3. There, the vote was 526 to 25 in favor of formation. However, in the Empire division the vote was 42 to 33 against the proposal and in the farming area north of Dry Creek the vote was an almost unanimous 37 to 5 opposition. Outside the Modesto area, the vote in favor of establishing the district was 174 to 131, far short of the required two-thirds.\n\nNot missing any opportunities to upset organization of the district in case it were to receive voter approval, opponents put their own slate of candidates on the ballot. Two were elected, J. W. Davison from Empire and E. H. Gatlin from the Dry Creek area. Baker, who sought the directorship in the Paradise area south and west of Modesto, lost to irrigation advocate W. H. Finley, 45 to 24. Eight years later Baker’s son-in-law, W. W. Carter, unseated Finley, and Baker was elected to the board in 1897 when the foes of irrigation took control.\n\nModesto banker and rancher Robert McHenry was the only candidate the opposition did not contest and he became the district’s first president. A. G. Carver, the sailor turned farmer who was an early advocate of irrigation, was the fifth member of the district’s first board.\n\nIn the contest for district treasurer, Tregea accumulated 156 votes against 697 for the successful Isaac Perkins; 522 of Perkins’ votes came from Modesto. Tregea carried the Dry Creek and Empire divisions, as did G. T. Hughes and C. M. Beckwith in unsuccessful bids for the posts of assessor and collector, respectively.\n\nOn July 23rd, the newly-elected Modesto Irrigation District Board of Directors, without a home of its own, met for the first time in the offices of the First National Bank, of which McHenry was president. The directors set about the novel and difficult task of organizing an irrigation district, an effort never before attempted. It was complicated by a lack of experience and a total lack of funds.\n\nAt the same time, opponents convened to plan their strategy for destroying the district.\n\nA loose organization was formed under the leadership of Baker, a native of Kentucky who at the age of 19 had driven an ox team west during the rush of 1849 and settled on the Tuolumne River west of the present sight of Modesto, not to seek gold but to raise sheep.\n\nIn the wheat boom that followed, Baker grew grain on upland property, but continued to raise cattle and sheep on riverbottom land, some of which flooded frequently. Baker at one point charged: \"Here they are charging me a high tax for land that is under water. Do you think I want irrigation for the frogs down in those swamp lands and ponds?\"\n\nThe first challenge came in September 1888 when the Modesto district levied its first property tax of 33 1/3 cents per $100 assessed valuation to raise $13,000 for operation of the district, including the planning of the canal system.\n\nTrega paid his taxes under protest and promptly sued MID Collector T. O. Owens for recovery of his $63.16 on the contention that the assessment had been made illegally without benefit of an election as required.\n\nThe Stanislaus County Superior Court upheld the validity of the irrigation district’s tax. Four years later, the California State Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that the Wright Act was so written that elections were required before tax assessments could be collected.\n\nAs a practical matter, putting the assessments to a vote would appear to have been a foregone conclusion in view of the overwhelming support City of Modesto voters gave to creation of the district and subsequent passage of bond issues. It was the first opportunity, though, for the opponents to take the matter to the courts.\n\nThe California Supreme Court in 1892 ordered a new trial in the case, but by that time Tregea and associates were so involved in a much more serious legal challenge to the basic constitutionality of the Wright Act that they failed to follow through and a new trial was never held. The case and its subsequent decision proved to be a major hindrance to the district, however.\n\nWhile awaiting the decision, the district continued to levy tax assessments without the benefit of elections. More and more property owners paid their taxes under protest, or flatly refused to pay at all. After the Supreme Court ruling, the practice took a substantial jump.\n\nBy that time, Baker and his colleagues in opposition had organized formally as the Defense Association, claiming to represent owners of 70,000 of the 108,000 acres originally included within the district boundaries. In effect, these were the 156 people who originally had voted against the district’s creation.\n\nThe opponents took to the courts at every opportunity. Suits were so numerous in those early years of the Modesto district that George T. MCabe, in preparing a 1920 Modesto Board of Trade history of Stanislaus County, wrote, \"When one spoke of irrigation, he usually meant litigation.\"\n\nDefense Association attorneys won injunction against the sale of property for delinquent taxes. Finally in 1895 Stanislaus County Superior Judge W. O. Minor, himself a delinquent taxpayer, issued a blanket restraining order forbidding the district from selling any tax-delinquent lands until the Tregea vs. Modesto Irrigation District suit and another basic challenge to the Wright Act, Bradley vs. Fallbrook Irrigation District, were decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAs a result of the state Supreme Court’s 1892 ruling, Judge Minor’s injunction and the depression which hit the nation in 1893 and 1894, the delinquent tax roll for 1895 accounted for $41,300 of the total $50,648 MID assessment.\n\nDelinquent taxpayers that year and the next included three members of the MID Board of Directors, the irrigation district’s attorney, the newly-elected MID assessor, the prime contractor on building La Grange Dam and canals, R.W. Gorrill, and, most notably, the MID treasurer, G.R. Stoddard.\n\nIn the interim, Collector Owens refused to turn over to the board of directors any of the funds which had been paid under protest. He feared that if the money were spent, he might personally be liable for repayment should the courts sustain the opposition.\n\nThis refusal to release funds was behind the earlier-mentioned altercation between MID attorney\n\nC. A. Stonesifer and Judge O. W. Schell. Stonesifer alleged that Owens was committing a felony by withholding funds. Judge Schell disagreed, whereupon, according to the Modesto Daily Evening News, the attorney called the judge a liar and attacked him.\n\nThe most significant case of all, which went all the way to the U. S. Supreme Court, was one started by the district itself.\n\nThroughout the state in the early days of irrigation district operations, it proved impossible to sell bonds because of the uncertainty of the constitutional validity of the fledgling districts and their yet-to-be established fiscal stability. In March 1889 the first in a series of legislative amendments to the Wright Act provided for judicial confirmation of proceedings through which individual districts were established and their bonds issued.\n\nThe Modesto Irrigation District initiated proceedings on July 31, 1889, to validate its organization and subsequent bond issues. On the same day the district reissued and sold $400,000 of the $800,000 in bonds voted a year-and-a half earlier but never sold for a lack of buyers. Opponents, represented by Tregea, intervened to fight the validation. Tregea, challenged the constitutionality of the Wright Act, the procedures followed in the bond election and the inclusion of Modesto land as part of the district.\n\nIn November, after hearing the case over a period of two months, Superior Judge Minor’s decision promptly appealed by Tregea.\n\nIt wasn’t until March 19, 1891, that the California Supreme Court upheld Judge Minor’s decision which, as far was that court as concerned, put to rest all the issues raised by the opponents.\n\nWhile much of the state court decision was devoted to technical issues such as whether proper notice had been given for the Superior Court hearings, the Supreme Court specifically addressed each of Tregea’s arguments. In a decision written by Chief Justice W. H. Beatty, the high court pointed out that three years earlier it had ruled that the Wright Act was constitutional and that irrigation districts were public entities with the right of assessment and condemnation. This decision had been handed down when the Turlock Irrigation District brought a friendly validation suit against its own secretary, R. M. Williams.\n\nAs to the question of whether the city should have been included in the district, the California Supreme Court declared in its 1891 Modesto Irrigation District vs. Tregea decision:\n\nSuch as has been the intention of the Legislature, as is clearly apparent, and it being equally clear and notorious as a matter of fact that there are cities not only benefited by irrigation, but actually have in profitable use extensive systems for irrigating land within their corporate limits, it cannot be denied that the Supervisors of Stanislaus County had the power to determine that the lands comprising the City of Modesto would be benefited by irrigation and might be included in an irrigation district.\n\nThe court went on to point out that the law provides that each property owner and taxpayer is entitled to his fair share of the water and if the land were not fit for cultivation because the taxpayer had built a shop on it, that was his problem. He still had to pay the taxes.\n\nThis was a total victory for the district, but it did not deter Tregea and his colleagues as they appealed to the federal courts, where initially they received a favorable decision at the appellate level.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in both the Fallbrook and Tregea cases November 16, 1896: The decisions once again upheld the validity of the Wright Act and of the irrigation districts created under it.\n\nOf special note in the federal Supreme Court hearings on the Tregea case was the involvement of San Francisco Judge James A. Waymire, who has been called the \"Savior of the Turlock Irrigation District.\" Judge Waymire held a substantial number of TID bonds and when the Turlock canal contractor defaulted, Judge Waymire took over the contract and saw that the work was completed with the backing of his personal funds.\n\nIn the City of Turlock’s lively book about the development of the Turlock’s lively book about the development of the Turlock region, Streams In a Thirsty Land, Helen Hohenthal quotes Judge Waymire about his involvement in the development of irrigation in Stanislaus County:\n\nBy 1894, strong opposition to the Wright Law developed and many lawsuits attacking the constitutionality of the law, the validity of the districts and their bonds were brought. To make matters worse, a great wave of financial depression swept over the world, so affecting values that even wheat could not be sold for a time in California…Throughout the state, all irrigation construction ceased and the Wright Law seemed doomed. Firmly believing in the soundness of the policy and its ultimate triumph, I determined to make an effort to vindicate the principles embodied in the law by making a success of at least one district. As I held some of the Turlock bonds and had induced others to buy, I naturally turned to that district. ©\n\nJudge Waymire had invested heavily in time and money in insuring the success of the Turlock Irrigation District when the United States Circuit Court in ruling on the Tregea case declared the Wright Act unconstitutional and the bonds issued under the law invalid.\n\nMiss Hohenthal recounts what happened next:\n\nJudge Waymire studied the federal court’s decision carefully and decided to carry the case to the United States Supreme Court where he hoped to receive a favorable decision. The bondholders of the different districts raised the money to pay the expenses of the case, leaving to Judge Waymire the choice of legal counsel. And well did he choose them.\n\nTo handle the case at Washington, he chose Hon. John M. Dillon of New York, ex-judge of the United States Circuit Court, and Hon. A. H. Rhodes, ex-chief justice of California. Before the case went to trial, Judge Waymire had, in the course of a friendly visit with Associate Supreme Court Justice Field, at the justice’s own suggestion, discussed the case with him. He suggested that Judge Waymire also secure the counsel of Joseph H. Choate, prominent New York lawyer. Justice Field, in recommending Choate, said the latter \"had a pleasing way of presenting his cases and the judges like to hear him.\"\n\n(It should be noted here that when the decision was issued, Justice Field’s was one of two dissenting votes. Chief Justice Melville W. Fuller’s was the other.)\n\nWaymire wired Choate, but found he had already been retained by George H. Maxwell, leader of the opposition, for the sum of $10,000. The next step of the story is best related by Judge Waymire himself:\n\n\"It seemed highly important to find a match for the eminent New Yorker. Finally, I thought of Hon. Benjamin Harrison, ex-President of the United States. He was the equal of any man as a lawyer, his personality would certainly be as interesting and impressive as that of Mr. Choate, and the fact he had appointed three of the judges would do no harm. Fortunately, I had a personal acquaintance with the general. A letter explaining the nature of the case and offering a retainer met with a favorable response.\"\n\nAlso deeply involved in the case before the Supreme Court was the author of the basic law, C. C. Wright, often referred to as the \"Father of Irrigation Districts.\"\n\nThe basic issue decided by the highest court of the land was that the use of water for irrigation was a public use and as such the districts had the right to levy assessments.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court decision should have ended the district’s troubles, but that was not to be.\n\nNo sooner had the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Modesto district and the Wright Act than the anti-irrigationists attacked from another direction: a scheme to sell to private sources not only the Modesto district but also the Turlock Irrigation District.\n\nThe idea was to give the bondholders all the completed works, including La Grange Dam and canals, and acquired right-of-way in exchange for the release of the bonds. A decade of hassle had taken its toll and even supporters of irrigation considered the idea worthy of investigation.\n\nBarely a month after the Supreme Court decision, a taxpayers’ meeting was held to advance the sale proposal. A committee of Frank A. Cressey, James Johnson, J. W. Davidson, Hiram Hughson and Baker was named to explore with the bondholders their reaction to the proposal. Cressey, Johnson and Davison were pro-irrigation, the others well established foes.\n\nContractor Gorrill, who had received a substantial number of bonds in exchange for construction work on La Grange Dam and MID canals, replied that the bondholders were receptive to the suggestion. He stipulated, however, that all debts other than the bonds must be paid before any transaction was consummated and each district must guarantee that a minimum of 15,000 acres would accept water at a price of $2.50 per acre per year.\n\nThe 15,000-acre guarantee proved to be the stumble block. This constituted more than 20 percent of all of the Modesto Irrigation District where farmers, once burned by a decade of waiting for water that never came, were not willing to guarantee anything further.\n\nAs Cressey, acting as secretary of the committee, wrote Gorrill on January 5, 1897: \"The land is not in a condition to receive the water and at present our farmers are in such a condition financially that they have not the necessary funds to put it in shape to receive the waters.\"\n\nAlthough Cressey indicated a willingness to continue discussions, there apparently was no great enthusiasm on the part of the farmers to follow through on the terms set forth by the bondholders nor interest of the bondholders to compromise on these terms.\n\nShortly thereafter, the opponents of irrigation took even more direct action. Apathy caused by years of waiting for water with none in sight caused low-voter turnouts at district elections; anti-irrigationists capitalized on it to capture control of the board of directors.\n\nThe district’s leading foe, Baker, won a seat on the board in the February 1897 election, joining his son-in-law, W. W. Carter, who had been elected two years earlier. With anti-irrigationists B. P. Hogin elected to represent the Empire district in 1897, the opposition now had a majority. The two surviving irrigationists were F. C. Davis, who was elected to represent the Modesto division, and Cressey.\n\nThe board refused to take any action toward completing the canal network, to levy taxes or to do anything positive. Carter, who believed in irrigation when not under his father-in-law’s influence, and Cressey resigned. This permitted the Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors to fill the vacancies. Appointed were two ardent anti-irrigationists from the Defense Association, L. A. Finney and John Adams.\n\nThe Defense Association was in complete control then and, starting in 1897, all operations came to a halt. Such was the disdain the board had for the district that in October of that year it rented out the front part of its offices for a barber-shop!\n\nFor the years 1897, 1898, 1899 and 1900, no tax assessments were levied. Under the terms of the irrigation law, the Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors was required to levy taxes if the district board failed to do so. By a 4-1 vote, the supervisors, who had appointed two ardent anti-irrigationists to the MID board, refused to make the assessment, using the same argument as did the foes of irrigation serving on the irrigation board; that the Wright Act was unconstitutional and the Modesto district was not formed legally.\n\nIrrigation supporters hoped the supervisors refusal would force the bondholders to act to collect their interest. That proved to be the case in 1899. George Herring of England was chosen to represent the bondholders so that the matter could be tried in the federal courts. In June the following year, the U. S. Circuit Court in San Francisco ordered the district to pay Herring $17,921.25 in interest due.\n\nStill the MID board refused to levy taxes.\n\nToo impatient to let the district die a slow death by fiscal strangulation, the anti-irrigation board on May 3, 1898 urged the start of new legal proceedings to dissolve the district. R. J. McKimmon, an ardent opponent of irrigation who had served on the MID board from 1890 to 1895, brought suit to accomplish this.\n\nWith Davis, the only irrigationist remaining on the board, voting against the resolution, the board of directors voted not to defend itself in the case.\n\nJudge James E. Prewitt, assigned to the Stanislaus court from Placer County to hear the matter, ruled in favor of dissolution of the district, stating that he was doing so only to bring the matter to a final California Supreme Court resolution as soon as possible. The higher court ruling favoring the continuation of the district did not come, however, until 1902. By that time, the opponents had gone too far in their efforts to kill the district and had lost control of its board.\n\nThe end of the opposition’s control came in 1901.\n\nIn 1900, the Stanislaus County Board of Trade, composed primarily of Modesto businessmen, was formed to fight for irrigation.\n\nThere were no provisions for the recall of elected officials in those days, but an attempt was made to have the courts remove Baker as an MID director. A civil \"accusation\" suit was filed in the Stanislaus County Superior Court by J. F. Kerr, supported by a long list of pro-irrigationists. Baker, as a member of the MID Board of Directors, was accused of \"corruptly\" refusing to act on any of the pressing matters facing the district. The action was dismissed, not on the issues but on the technicality that the suit was not properly taken.\n\nThe beginning of the end came January 2, 1901, when the lone irrigation supporter remaining on the board, Modesto’s Director Davis, moved to call the regular election for that year. His motion died for lack of a second.\n\nTen days later, irrigation supporter R. C. Bailey asked the Stanislaus County Superior Court to mandate the calling of an election. Judge William G. Lorigan of Santa Clara County was brought in to hear the case.\n\nThe Defense Association attorneys, Judge Van R. Patterson of San Francisco and C. W. Eastin of Modesto, were prepared to wage a long delaying action, but Judge Lorigan set the trial for the following Saturday morning, January 19th, with the declaration that it would be completed that very day. By 4 o’clock that afternoon, the trial was over. Judge Lorigan ordered the MID board to meet the following Monday and schedule the regular February election. After a heated debate, the MID board complied with the order and called the election.\n\nOn February 6, 1901, the back of the opposition was broken. Three new directors, all strong supporters of completing the system and moving forward with the operation of the district, were elected. T. K. Beard defeated anti-irrigationist A. F. Underwood, 24 to 11, in Division 1. Underwood was so angered by the development that he sold his land for $20 an acre and moved to Santa Cruz, according to historian Sol Elias. W. R. High defeated Adams, 271 to 32, in Division 2. Davis was not opposed in his bid for re-election and Baker was re-elected by a narrow margin of 25 to 23. Finney’s term had another two years to run.\n\nFinney remained on the board until 1907 and Baker until 1908, but their days of opposition were over and the district moved ahead to completion and the delivery of water that had been promised so many years earlier.\n\nWith the election of 1901, the Modesto Irrigation District was back in the control of those who believed in it, but statistically the odds in favor of its survival still were not high.\n\nThe Modesto district had not been alone in facing adversity, but it was one of the few agencies that survived. Of 49 irrigation districts formed in California during the first decade after passage of the Wright Act, only eight still existed in 1915 when Frank Adams of the U. S. Department of Agriculture published a major study of irrigation in California. Petitions for 10 other districts had been filed. Five died even before reaching the election stage; the others were defeated at the polls.\n\nEleven of the 49, mostly located in Southern California, were classified by Adams as speculative, but the remainder were serious attempts to bring water to the land either through the creation of new districts or acquisition and improvement of existing private irrigation systems. Failing districts died for a variety of reasons, including poor engineering, lack of economic feasibility, over-optimism about the availability of water and inadequate management. Creating irrigation districts under a new, untried law was difficult and brought unexpected results.\n\nWhile Adams said \"the disastrous mistakes\" made under the original California Irrigation Districts Act \"brought a tremendous economic loss to California,\" he maintained the \"final results (were) essentially constructive and forward.\"\n\nFor the Modesto district, the final results were most satisfactory, although delays and doubts caused by more than a decade of litigation greatly depressed land values. Assessed valuations of land in the district plunged from $4 million in 1888 to less than $2 million by 1900. Small farmers suffered dearly, for they could not survive as producers of wheat in a declining market. Without water, however, there were few alternatives to dry-farming grain.\n\nWhile statistically the odds were against success, statistics are not people. The initial Modesto Irrigation District directors and officers were \"men well fitted for the important offices to which they were elected,\" according to a Modesto Daily Evening News evaluation immediately after the election.\n\nRobert McHenry, the district’s first president, was a native New Englander who inherited that region’s habits of industry and economy. President of the First National Bank of Modesto and owner of the 4,000-acre Bald Eagle Ranch north of Modesto, McHenry was the only one of the original five directors not opposed in the 1887 election. He represented much of the City of Modesto.\n\nJ. W. Davison, a native of Missouri, was an Empire area grain farmer, one of the first to harvest grain with a combine propelled by 32 mules and horses. A former county supervisor, Davison was elected on the anti-irrigation ticket to represent an area which opposed the creation of the MID . Davison was described by the News, however, as \"a man of first class ability and full of push and energy…looked upon by the friends of irrigation as a good man for the place, knowing him to be possessed of sound judgement and very progressive,\" a description which events proved most accurate.\n\nE. H. Gatlin, an east side grain producer farming 960 acres, was the other anti-irrigationist elected, receiving the same 37-to-5 vote cast in the division against the district.\n\nA. G. Carver, the Maine sailor turned rancher, had presided over the 1877 meeting at which Engineer William Ham Hall had presented the basic concept for irrigating Paradise Valley that ultimately was adopted by the Modesto district. Carver was to be the second president of the district, serving until his death in 1891.\n\nW. H. Finley, a Kentuckian who farmed 800 acres near Modesto, was to serve on the board until he retired in 1895, having been the third president for the previous four years.\n\nIsaac Perkins, the MID ’s first treasurer, was the first hardware store owner in Modesto. V. E. Bangs, a pioneer teacher and farmer who was to be elected the following year to the California State Assembly, was assessor. T. O. Owens, a young farmer who had fought for irrigation, was the district’s first collector whose later disappearance revealed a shortage of funds.\n\nGetting the Modesto Irrigation District under way was a slow process, strictly a hand-to-mouth operation.\n\nHistorian Sol Elias, who at the turn of the century personally participated in some of the efforts to make the operation successful, commented in his Stories of Stanislaus:\n\nThe first directorates of the Modesto Irrigation District undertook a great enterprise under a new law, the provisions of which were untried, and the validity of which was as yet unadjudicated…There were no precedents to guide (them)…The first directors groped for means and methods…The colossal magnitude of the problem necessarily impelled slow and deliberate action.\n\nThe process of getting water to the fields of Paradise Valley started quickly enough, for it was only two weeks after the initial organizational meeting of the board of directors that C. E. Grunsky of San Francisco was hired to prepare preliminary plans and estimates for an irrigation system. Both the Stanislaus and Tuolumne Rivers were to be explored as sources of supply.\n\nIn mid-August of 1887 Director Davison, who was serving as secretary to the board, filed in behalf of the Modesto district notices of appropriation on both rivers. For the next few months, Davison devoted all his time and energies to work with Grunsky in determining the feasibility of various reservoir sites on both rivers.\n\nAlthough a year later the Modesto board was to opt for the Stanislaus River as its source, Directors McHenry, Carver and Davison had been authorized in September 1887 to meet with the Turlock directors concerning use of the Tuolumne. In the following month, Davison was named a committee of one to contact the Turlock district about possible joint canal operations. Both appointments were made before Grunsky had completed his report. Although MID board minutes fail to show any report on the MID -TID discussions, the idea of the two districts working together existed virtually from their creation.\n\nIt was to be three years before the two districts got together, however. The subsequent marriage has lasted for nearly a century, but not without occasional discord.\n\nToday, preliminary planning of water resource development projects is measured in terms of years. Grunsky, however, made his report to the board in just 10 weeks.\n\nHe offered four distinct proposals:\n\nIrrigate the entire district from the Tuolumne River, using Dry Creek as a canal for several miles; estimated cost, $1,117,800.\n\nConstruct a 90-foot-high dam on the Stanislaus River two miles above Knights Ferry and irrigate all the district from this source; estimated cost, $644,750.\n\nIrrigate only 90,000 of the 108,000 acres then in the district by utilizing a Turlock Irrigation District canal down the south side of the Tuolumne River and then a pipeline across the river to the Modesto side; estimated cost, $458,950.\n\nIrrigate 90,000 acres through the joint TID-MID canal and pipeline across the Tuolumne and irrigate the rest of the district from the Stanislaus River; estimated cost, $788,950.\n\nToday, the concept of irrigating all of the district – which was reduced in size to 80,000 acres in 1889 by an exclusion of much high ground on the east side – by gravity flow via a main canal running through the rolling hills seems quite logical. That ultimately is what was done. In 1887, however, the Modesto Herald editorially wrote off the idea as \"utterly impracticable\" which \"will receive no consideration\" from the board of directors because of cost.\n\nGrunsky leaned toward the Stanislaus as a source of supply, although its 1,050 square miles of watershed would yield less runoff than the Tuolumne’s 1,501 square-mile watershed, which also included glaciers at much higher elevations.\n\nHe outlined his Stanislaus River proposal in great detail, even indicating whose ranches the various canals would cross. The engineer’s concern about the Tuolumne as a source was whether there would be enough water to go around if the MID had to share with the Turlock district.\n\nEven before making a final selection as to which river to tap, it was obvious that any solution would be costly, so on November 19, 1887, the board ordered a special election for passage of an $800,000 bond issue. The December 19th vote overwhelmingly favorable, 439 to 76.\n\nAfter traveling to Knights Ferry to inspect the proposed dam site personally, the board on June 16, 1888, voted to proceed with the development on the Stanislaus River. East side Director E. R. Crawford, who had succeeded Gatlin earlier that year, dissented.\n\nGrunsky was authorized to hire whatever personnel he needed to prepare plans. Three months later, after two unsuccessful attempts to sell bonds, the fiscal plight of the district was such that Grunsky and his crew were dismissed.\n\nThere was no market for irrigation district bonds, for no one was willing to risk cash to invest in an unknown quantity that lacked a fiscal history.\n\nBy October district finances were so grim that the board of directors terminated the services of all employees, except James Rector, who was identified in the board minutes sometimes as a laborer and sometimes as \"the construction department,\" and recently-appointed Secretary W. W. Granger. Davison, elected on the anti-irrigation ticket, had served as a volunteer secretary during the MID ’s first year of existence.\n\nThe Modesto Irrigation District survived strictly on credit until June 1888, when the district issued warrants to pay its bills for the first time in a year. Local merchants apparently accepted the warrants as negotiable. Until the first assessment could be levied, there was no money in the treasury.\n\nBased on a $13,000 operating budget for 1889, a 33 1/3 cents per $100 valuation assessment was levied in September 1988 with payment due by December. In spite of payments made under protest, the district had money on which to operate. In January 1889, the year-and-a-half-old district was able for the first time to pay its bills with cash and start to redeem the warrants.\n\nEngineer Grunsky was rehired and then refired.\n\nThe bay area engineer’s telegram accepting reappointment said he would finish the work for $150. When he got off the train in Modesto, he said that figure was a mistake and he wanted $750. He was sent packing back to San Francisco.\n\nThings began to seem brighter "
