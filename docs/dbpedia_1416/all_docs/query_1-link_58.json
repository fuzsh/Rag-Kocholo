        "text": "For the 2016 Senate race for the state of New Hampshire there were two women running from the two major parties(Republican and Democrat) as candidates. For the Democratic party, then governor Maggie Hassan sought to win a seat against the incumbent Republican Senator Kelly Ann Ayotte. Maggie Hassan won the seat against the incumbent which was really surprising as the Ayotte won the primaries by a huge margin. Hassan received 47.97% of the vote while Ayotte received 47.84% showing that the margin of win was really slim. In the race, there was also an independent candidate, Aaron Day who received 2.40% of the vote and Libertarian candidate Brian Chabot who received 1.70% of the vote.

CNN, USA today, and Fox News all reported information on the candidates and results of the election. They provided accurate information that I didn’t think was biased. However, since this election did take place near the presidential election there was a lot of comparison between the candidates of relating to Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. They were often portrayed as relating to the major party’s presidential candidate. However, Ayotte did try to distance herself from it by publicly going against Trump by stating she would not vote for him. I think it's really interesting"
