        "text": "Once again, we joined forces in common cause to watchdog and advocate at the Oregon legislature with a focus on defending and strengthening democracy.\n\nBuilding on years of work, Common Cause Oregon partnered with Honest Elections Oregon to negotiate back a deeply flawed proposal on campaign finance reform and turn it into a historic bill worth supporting – making it the first time in Oregon history that legislators ever voted to limit campaign contributions. Common Cause also raised our collective voice to help win passage of a half dozen other pro-democracy measures.\n\nOUR TOP PRIORITIES\n\nHB 4024 – Campaign Finance Reform – PASSED\n\nEnacts limits on campaign contributions, improves reporting of the true-original source of funds spent independently of candidates, and strengthens enforcement.\n\nSB 1571 – Artificial Intelligence Deepfake Campaign Ads – PASSED\n\nRequires disclosure of A.I. generated manipulation in campaign ads used to deceive voters.\n\nSB 1533 – Voter Pamphlet Translation – PASSED\n\nExpands the number of languages to which the state voters’ pamphlet is translated, so voters can access ballot information in a language with which they’re most comfortable.\n\nHB 4019 – State Electors Count – PASSED\n\nAligns Oregon’s process for casting its Electoral College votes with new requirements set out in the 2022 federal Electoral Count Reform Act, safeguarding against attempts to organize false electors. This involves clarifying who has authority to approve Oregon’s Electoral College (Oregon’s Governor and/or Secretary of State), creating a security measure, and aligning Oregon’s timeline to the federal timeline.\n\nSB 1502A – School Board Transparency – PASSED\n\nRequires school boards to live stream meetings and post recording online.\n\nSB 5701 – Elections Funding – PASSED\n\nBudget requests for election administration, including for limited-duration public records staff during peak election time, to ensure Oregon election administration remains strong in the face of unprecedented pressures.\n\nSB 1589 – Bad Voting Bill\n\nWe opposed this bill to overturn Oregon’s voting best practices. The bill never made it out of committee, but is worth noting. It would have ended Vote-By-Mail, making in-person voting the default and adding new Voter ID requirements; for absentee or overseas military ballots that are mailed, it would have removed protections that ballots are postage paid and will count if postmarked by election day.\n\nSB 1577 – Automatic Voter Registration Bill Needing More Work\n\nWe would have liked to be able to support this well-intended bill to expand Oregon’s AVR program to include public colleges. But since Oregon does not currently have the systems in place to do this in a secure and effective manner, we worked to stop it from moving forward at this time.\n\nSYMBOLIC MEMORIALS HONORING DEMOCRACY HEROES\n\nSCR 203 – Memorial: Alice Bartelt – PASSED\n\nHonors life & memory of Alice Bartelt, a League of Women Voters leader and Common Cause member.\n\nSCR 204 – Memorial: Bill Bradbury – PASSED\n\nHonors life & memory of Bill Bradbury, who, as Oregon Secretary of State, helped introduce Vote-by-Mail and establish greater campaign finance transparency.\n\nSCR 211 – Memorial: Steve Druckenmiller – PASSED\n\nHonors life & memory of Steve Druckenmiller, longtime County Election Clerk who championed VBM and other good election practice.\n\nSCR 212 – Memorial: Clifford Trow – PASSED\n\nHonors life & memory of Clifford Trow, former OSU professor, Oregon legislator, and long time Common Cause Oregon supporter.\n\nOTHER DEMOCRACY BILLS\n\nSB 1538 – Election Law Updates – PASSED\n\nThe Election Division’s latest small technical fixes to election law.\n\nHB 4020 – Training for Notaries – PASSED\n\nRequires training for notaries to reduce errors.\n\nHB 4026 – Placeholder on Voter Access – PASSED\n\nAmended to stop voters from overturning local land use decisions by ballot measure after public land use process.\n\nHB 4031 – Placeholder on Public Records – PASSED\n\nAmended to keep certain tax records private.\n\nHB 4117 – Public Meetings Law Guidance – PASSED\n\nAuthorizes the Oregon Government Ethics Commission (OGEC) to give guidance on application of public meetings law, fixing a drafting error in a bill passed last session that expanded OGEC’s enforcement power.\n\nHB 4153 – Artificial Intelligence Task Force – PASSED\n\nEstablishes a legislative task force to identify terms and definitions related to A.I. that may be used for legislation.\n\nSB 1541 – Circuit Court Judges – PASSED\n\nIncreases number of circuit court judges.\n\nSB 1540 – Placeholder on Public Records\n\nCalls for a study on public records and serves as a placeholder that legislators could later amend, if they want to pass something more specific on this issue.\n\nHB 4027 – Placeholder on Ethics\n\nCalls for a study on government ethics and serves as a placeholder that legislators could later amend, if they want to pass something more specific on this issue.\n\nHB 4021 – U.S. Senator Replacement\n\nRequires Governor to appoint a temporary U.S. Senator until next special election, if/when Oregon loses a U.S. Senator between elections.\n\nHB 4030 – Placeholder on Public Meetings\n\nCalls for a study on public meetings law and serves as a placeholder that legislators could later amend, if they want to pass something more specific on this issue.\n\nHB 4032 – How Judicial Candidates Appear on Ballot\n\nEnds the practice of printing “incumbent” next to the names of incumbent judicial candidates on the ballot.\n\nHB 4041 – Equity Grant Program\n\nUpdates and provides further funds for existing equity grant program.\n\nHB 4159 – Newcomer Humanitarian Investment Pilot\n\nRequires the Office of Immigrant & Refugee Advancement to contract with entities to provide short-term case management to new citizens.\n\nHB 4166 – Rules for Drafting Ballot Titles\n\nPrescribes the method for creating a ballot title and an explanatory statement for any amendment to the Oregon Constitution or statutory Act that passes both houses of the Legislative Assembly during the 2024 session and that is referred to the people by the Legislative Assembly.\n\nHJR 202 – Quorum vs. Simple Majority\n\nRefers a measure to voters to change the requirement for the legislature to conduct business from a two-thirds quorum to a simple majority."
