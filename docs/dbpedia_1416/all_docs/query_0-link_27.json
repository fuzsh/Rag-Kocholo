        "text": "Wellington D. Rankin was born in Missoula, Montana, on September 16, 1884, the son of pioneer Missoula businessman and rancher John Rankin and his wife Olive Pickering Rankin, an early Missoula County school teacher. His oldest sister Jeannette became the first woman elected to the United States Congress in 1916. He had four other sisters: Harriet, Mary, Edna, and Grace. Wellington remained a source of financial security for his sisters throughout his life.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Montana with a degree in science in 1903, Wellington attended Harvard University, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1905 and a law degree in 1909. He also studied at Oxford University from 1905 to 1906. John Rankin's death in 1904 left the young Wellington in charge of his father's multiple businesses and properties even as he continued his education.\n\nRankin began his law practice in Helena in 1909, in the offices of Thomas J. Walsh and Cornelius B. Nolan. He opened his own office in 1911. He specialized primarily in industrial accident cases, representing many workers injured in mines and on the railroads. He thus took on as opponents many of the largest corporations in the state. Other cases included contested inheritances, land disputes, and divorces.\n\nRankin first became involved in politics in 1914 when he ran unsuccessfully for the legislature on the Progressive Party ticket. Two years later he was financier and campaign manager for his sister Jeannette in her successful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican. Wellington's wealth and political connections were instrumental to Jeannette's victory in 1916 and again in 1940. In 1920 Wellington Rankin was elected Montana Attorney General and served in that post until 1924 when he was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Montana Supreme Court. After an unsuccessful run for governor in 1928, Rankin was appointed U.S. district attorney by President Calvin Coolidge, and was reappointed by Herbert Hoover in 1930. Rankin ran unsuccessfully for public office several more times, including U.S. Senate in 1942 and 1948, and U.S. House of Representatives in 1952. Following these defeats Rankin became involved in non-electoral political leadership, serving on state, regional, and national committees of the Republican Party through the 1950s and 60s.\n\nIn addition to his law practice and his political campaigns, Rankin was also involved in numerous business ventures. Most important were his ranching businesses. In the 1930s he began acquiring large ranches, including the Avalanche Ranch, the Birch Creek Ranch, the Stafford-Floweree Ranch, the Miller Brothers Ranch, and the 71 Ranch. At the height of his ranching success in the early 1960s, he owned about a million acres. He sold the Miller Brothers property to a Blaine County grazing association in 1964. At the time of his death he still owned about 600,000 acres.\n\nRankin was also a partner in the Placer Hotel and the Weiss Café/Mint Bar in Helena, the Montana Ready-Mix Company in Missoula, and numerous oil and mining properties.\n\nRankin married Helena socialite Elizabeth Wallace in 1910, although the couple separated less than a year later. In 1956, Wellington married Louise Replogle, a member of his law firm. Neither marriage produced children. Rankin died June 4, 1966, at the age of 81.\n\nPersonal and professional papers. 1909-1969 (bulk). This collection is organized into six subgroups relating to different aspects of Rankin's life: personal (1912-1966), family (1937-1969), politics (1914-1962), ranches (1925-1967), businesses (1911-1968), and law practice (1909-1966). These are further subdivided into secondary subgroups and series, as appropriate. See the arrangement note, below, as not all boxes containing materials from the same subgroup are physically grouped together.\n\nWellington D. Rankin's personal subgroup includes correspondence (1912-1966) with a wide range of family, friends, romantic partners, business colleagues, political associates and Christian Science practitioners; minor financial records (1911-1965); minor legal documents (1930-1957); subject files concerning his Missoula properties, a Butte electric franchise, and other topics; miscellany, including greeting cards; and clippings concerning Christian Science and other topics of interest to Rankin.\n\nThe Rankin family subgroup consist primarily of letters among family members Mary Rankin Bragg, Louise Replogle Rankin Galt, Grace Rankin Kinney, Edna Rankin McKinnon, and Jeannette Rankin. See note on separated materials, below, regarding Jeannette Rankin materials.\n\nWellington D. Rankin's political subgroup include records from his compaigns for various offices and service on the Republican National Committee. There is also a large body of more miscellaneous correspondence and subject files relating to various aspects of local and national politics, 1914-1962.\n\nRankin's ranches included the Avalanche, Birch Creek, A.B. Cook, Moss Agate, Stafford-Floweree, Miller Brothers, and \"71\" ranches. Records include correspondence (1925-1945, 1958-1965) with and about employees and about the purchase of various ranch properties; employment records including payrolls (1938-1959) and employment contracts (1937-1967); financial records; legal documents (1921-1969) consisting primarily of bills of sale and receipts for livestock, land, and equipment; subject files on timber harvesting, grazing, and various properties; and miscellany.\n\nThere are relatively minor subgroups for some of Rankin's various business ventures, including ABC News, the Brazier Brothers Company candy business, the Grand Hotel Company in Billings, the Helena Hotel Company, the Montana Ready-Mix Company cement plant in Missoula, the Pittsburgh Block Company, the Red Rock Producing Company, the Sherman Music Company, the Weiss Café/Mint Bar, and files concerning many of Rankin's mining investments including correspondence and assay reports, and annual reports on several mines.\n\nIn terms of quantity, the largest subgroup is Rankin's law practice records. Some of this material is restricted due to attorney-client privilege, including client correspondence, and portions of some case files; however, much is open to research. Open correspondence is mainly with other attorneys and public officials and mainly concerns routine legal matters such as the scheduling of cases for trial. Other topics include the building of Rankin's law library and equipping of his office. Case files (predominantly 1911-1925, but also some from the 1940s-1960s) cover the diversity of Rankin's practice and give a picture of his effectiveness as an attorney. In addition to the case files, the law office subgroup includes financial records of the law practice; legal documents, including Rankin's contracts with his clients; a subject file on the Montana Trial Lawyer's Association; and miscellany including jury lists (1926-1933) for Billings, Butte, Great Falls, Helena, Havre, and Missoula.\n\nThere are two very small subgroups for personal papers of Rankin's law partners Charles L. Zimmerman and Arthur P. Acher."
