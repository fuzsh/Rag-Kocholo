        "text": "Facts\n\nIn the late 1950s, the state of Tennessee was still using boundaries between electoral districts that had been devised in 1901, according to the 1900 census. However, the state constitution required revising the lines every 10 years to account for changes in population. Since 1901, population changes had resulted in vast disparities between the Shelby County district in which Memphis was located and other surrounding districts. This meant that the votes of people in rural areas had a proportionately greater value than the votes of people in urban areas. A Republican voter who lived in an urban area of Shelby County, Charles Baker, brought a claim to argue that he was denied equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment because his vote was devalued.\n\nThe named defendant was Joseph Carr, the Tennessee Secretary of State, who oversaw the election process in the state but did not construct the boundaries. Citing the political question doctrine, Tennessee argued that courts could not provide a remedy for this issue. Instead, they should allow the political process to function independently.\n\nOpinions\n\nPlurality\n\nWilliam Joseph Brennan, Jr. (Author)\n\nHugo Lafayette Black\n\nEarl Warren\n\nOffering a clearer vision of the political question doctrine, Brennan streamlined it into six factors that must be present for a court to withhold its opinion on an issue: 1) A textual constitutional commitment of the matter to another branch of government, such as the power of the President in foreign affairs (note that later cases did not strictly adhere to this view); 2) A lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving the issue; 3) A need for an initial policy determination before addressing the matter that courts would not be able to reach; 4) A situation in which independent court action would violate the separation of powers framework; 5) An unusual need to strictly adhere to a previous political decision; or 6) A possibility that clashing statements on an issue by multiple branches of government would cause embarrassment. Brennan found that these factors were not present in the current case, so he ruled that it was justiciable rather than a political question. Since there was no majority but only a plurality, however, the Court could not grant relief to Baker outright. Instead, it remanded the case to the lower courts for further consideration.\n\nConcurrence\n\nWilliam Orville Douglas (Author)\n\nConcurrence\n\nTom C. Clark (Author)\n\nConcurrence\n\nPotter Stewart (Author)\n\nDissent\n\nFelix Frankfurter (Author)\n\nJohn Marshall Harlan II\n\nTaking a more cautious view of the separation of powers, Frankfurter lamented that the Court had stepped beyond the appropriate boundaries of the judicial role. He would have allowed the political process to determine the relative impact of an individual's vote.\n\nRecused\n\nCharles Evans Whittaker (Author)\n\nHealth issues caused by the heated debate over the case forced Whittaker to withdraw from the deliberations and arguably into early retirement.\n\nCase Commentary"
