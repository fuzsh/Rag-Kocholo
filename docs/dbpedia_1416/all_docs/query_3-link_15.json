        "text": "Looking Beyond the 19th Amendment\n\nWomen headed to the polls in the November 1920 election, although it would be decades before eligible women voted at the same rate as their male counterparts.\n\nAnd for more than a year, it was unclear whether the ratification victory would hold. A Maryland judge named Oscar Leser filed a lawsuit claiming that the character of the 19th Amendment excluded it from being added to the Constitution. In a unanimous decision in Leser v. Garnett, the Supreme Court confirmed the amendment's constitutionality on February 22, 1922. The right of citizens of the United States to vote could not be denied based on sex.\n\nBut the 19th Amendment was only \"the first lap of this struggle for women's emancipation\" according to Carrie Chapman Catt. Alice Paul declared, â€œIt is incredible to me that any woman should consider the fight for full equality won. It is just beginning.\" Women got to work. Across the country, they ran for office in local, state, and national elections. They used the organizational skills they had developed fighting for the vote to campaign for equal treatment under the law, like the right to serve on juries and to receive equal pay for equal work.\n\nBut white women activists continued to marginalize women of color in the leadership of their organizations and in the issues they championed. African American women faced the same discrimination, oppression and violence as men when they tried to vote. Black women remained on the forefront in the Black Freedom struggle, fighting for voting rights and an end to lynching. They were instrumental in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Native American suffragists worked for US citizenship for tribal members, a fight they won in 1924 with the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act."
