        "text": "United States Senators were elected by state legislatures before the 17th Amendment was ratified in 1913. An under-appreciated feature of these elections is that they required a fair amount of coordination. Federal law specified that the first round of voting was to be bicameral; if the same person received a majority (not a plurality) in each chamber, he was elected senator. Failing that, the same law specified that the two chambers meet jointly and vote until someone received a majority of the joint ballot."
