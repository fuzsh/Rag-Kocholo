        "text": "\"On this day\" happenings in Indiana History\n\nJanuaryJulyFebruaryAugustMarchSeptemberAprilOctoberMayNovemberJuneDecember\n\nJanuary\n\nJanuary 1\n\nIn 1833, the Indianapolis Journal published John Finley's poem \"The Hoosier's Nest,\" one of the first printed references of the word \"Hoosier.\" According to Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, Finley heard the term in 1820 when he traveled from Virginia to Indiana. He likely drafted his famous poem in 1830, describing the massive \"flock\" of people \"to this rising 'Hoosher' nation.\" \"The Hoosier's Nest\" was widely circulated and earned Finley the title of \"poet-laureate of Hoosierland.\"\n\nIn 1925, Knute Rockne coached the University of Notre Dame football team to a 27-10 win over Pop Warner’s Stanford University squad in the Rose Bowl. The team finished the season undefeated and earned Notre Dame its first football national championship title. (St. Joseph Co.)\n\nIn 1940, entrepreneur Orville Redenbacher began work at Princeton Farms, where he first started working with popcorn. In his youth, the Brazil, Indiana native began growing corn and selling popcorn, participated in 4-H clubs, and studied vocational agriculture in high school. Redenbacher earned a degree in agriculture at Purdue University and served as a Farm Bureau extension agent. By 1965, Redenbacher and business partner Charlie Bowman had engineered a hybrid popcorn that was fluffier and lighter than previous varieties, making Redenbacher a brand name. (Gibson Co.)\n\nIn 1970, UniGov legislation went into effect, merging the governments of Marion County and Indianapolis. The consolidation, spearheaded by Mayor Richard Lugar, sought to streamline government, reverse urban blight, and create employment and recreational opportunities. Upon its enactment, Unigov added 250,000 residents to the city’s population, most of whom were white, conservative suburbanites. The inclusion of this new demographic flipped the city’s historically Democratic city government to a Republican majority. While Unigov helped modernize Indianapolis and attract federal grants, it also diluted the Black political voice in the city. (Marion Co.)\n\nJanuary 2\n\nIn 1857, Julia L. Dumont, one of Indiana's earliest writers, died in Vevay. She was widely-lauded as a teacher and author, praised by student and The HoosierSchool-Master author Edward Eggleston, who noted that \"in the time, before railways, when the west, [was] shut in by the Alleghanies . . . Mrs. Dumont occupied no mean place as a writer of poetry and prose tales. Eminent literateurs of the time from Philadelphia and Cincinnati used to come to Vevay, and see her.\" (Switzerland Co.)\n\nIn 1884, influential classical archaeologist and art scholar Dr. Mary Hamilton Swindler was born in Bloomington. Swindler earned an MA from Indiana University in 1906 and her Ph.D. in 1912 from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. Dr. Swindler taught archaeology at Bryn Mawr from 1912 to 1949, cultivating a new generation of scholars and transforming the college into a \"distinguished archaeological center.\" According to the school, Swindler published her seminal work Ancient Painting: From the Earliest Times to the Period of Christian Art in 1929 and became the first woman appointed as editor of the American Journal of Archaeology in 1932. (Monroe Co.)\n\nJanuary 3\n\nIn 1825, Welsh industrialist Robert Owen purchased Harmony from Father George Rapp and the Harmony Society. The social reformer renamed the town New Harmony and worked to create a utopian society based on the ideals of humanism, equality, and scientific study. With the help of scientist William Maclure, New Harmony attracted a group of eminent thinkers and scientists from Philadelphia and established one of the first free schools for both boys and girls, as well as a library accessible to all members of society. The experiment failed within two years, but ultimately left a strong legacy of education and scientific thought. The site is preserved by the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites, and visitors can tour its many historic buildings. (Posey Co.)\n\nIn 1941, Purdue University coach Ward \"Piggy\" Lambert captured his 200th Big Ten victory with a 64-19 win over Chicago in West Lafayette. He directed the Boilermakers to 11 Big Ten titles and a Helms Foundation national championship, while compiling a 371-152 mark in his 28 seasons at Purdue. Only former Indiana University head coach Bobby Knight (353 wins) and Purdue's Gene Keady (255) have since reached the 200-victory plateau in Big Ten play. (Tippecanoe Co.)\n\nJanuary 4\n\nIn 1869, author and humorist Mark Twain visited Indianapolis to perform a reading of his \"The American Vandal Abroad.\" According to the Indianapolis Daily Sentinel, attendees could procure their tickets at Bonham's Music Store for the lecture held at Metropolitan Hall. Twain returned to Indianapolis in 1872, reading his Roughing It at the YMCA's Association Hall.\n\nJanuary 5\n\nIn 1865, Hannah Toliver was pardoned for aiding a fugitive slave from Kentucky in 1864. A free black woman living in Jeffersonville, Indiana, Toliver was arrested because the Emancipation Proclamation (1863) did not free slaves in Kentucky. Toliver was one of at least forty-four men and women, and one of nineteen \"free persons of color,\" sentenced to the Kentucky Penitentiary for aiding fugitive slaves between 1844 and 1864. P. B. Muir, the judge who sentenced Toliver to seven years in the Kentucky Penitentiary also requested that Governor Thomas Bramlette pardon her. (Clark Co.)\n\nIn 1911, black male students founded Kappa Alpha Nu (changed to Kappa Alpha Psi in 1915) at Indiana University after being excluded from social events. Kappa Alpha Nu was one of the earliest black national social fraternities established in the US. The organization strove to expand to other schools and help members attain high \"intellectual, moral and social worth.\" The chapter's 21st century mission is to promote \"Purpose and Achievement from Cradle to Career.\" (Monroe Co.)\n\nIn 1948, best-selling novel Raintree County was published, written by Bloomington native Ross Lockridge Jr. The book, described by some critics as the Great American Novel, takes place in 1892 in a fictionalized Indiana town. Over the course of one day its protagonist, John Shawnessy, recalls forty years of his life, including his Hoosier youth, Civil War battles, and Gilded Age politics. The book won MGM's best new literary work award of $150,000 and the movie studio produced a film adaption in 1957, featuring Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, and Eva Marie Saint. (Monroe Co.)\n\nIn 1948, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male was published, researched and written by Indiana University zoology professor Dr. Alfred Kinsey. In a New York Times review written one day prior to publication, Howard A. Rusk described the book as \"by far the most comprehensive study yet made of sex behavior.\" For the book, Dr. Kinsey conducted more than 12,000 interviews over the period of eight years in a scientific examination of male sexual activities and attitudes. Rust noted that \"These facts are presented with scientific objectivity, and without moralizing--but they provide the knowledge with which we can rebuild our concepts with tolerance and understanding.\" (Monroe Co.)\n\nJanuary 6\n\nIn 1821, the Indiana General Assembly approved an Act that named the soon-to-be new state capital \"Indianapolis,\" appointed commissioners to plat the area, and authorized land sales. The Act also specified that money received from the sale of lots would be used to erect public buildings, such as the governor's mansion on the circle, the first state house, and the first state prison (located in Jeffersonville).\n\nIn 1829, the Indiana General Assembly approved an \"Act to Incorporate Hanover Academy,\" founded two years earlier in a log cabin with six students by the Madison Presbytery. The 1829 Act provided for expansion and a preamble to the Act noted that \"a number of citizens of Jefferson County, residing in the vicinity of Hanover in said county, have, by the aid of private contributions, established an Academy at Hanover, by means of which a liberal education may be acquired by the youth of that vicinity . . . an act to incorporate the said Academy would greatly promote the landable object of the citizens aforesaid.\" The Academy would evolve into Hanover College by 1833.\n\nIn 1887, the Indiana General Assembly held its first session in the new statehouse. The original capitol building at the site was razed in 1878 to make way for the new statehouse. Construction would not be completed until September 1888, but at the time of the first session the chambers, corridors, atriums, and rotunda were completed. The building's architecture reflected a Renaissance Revival style with Neo-Greco style details.\n\nIn 1914, Chinese entrepreneur Moy Kee died at his chop suey restaurant on Washington Street in Indianapolis. Moy Kee immigrated to the United States in the 1850s as a young boy, settling in Indiana in 1897 and opening up a chop suey restaurant in Indianapolis with his wife Chin Fung. Having successfully won his American citizenship through the Marion County courts during the height of the Chinese Exclusion Act, Moy became an influential figure in the Indianapolis community, serving as an interpreter for the Chinese residents, cultivating strong relationships with the press, and hosting many traditional Chinese events like lavish Chinese New Years parties. Fourteen years after his citizenship was granted, the federal courts stripped him of the status. In response, the Indianapolis community rallied in defense of Moy with Indianapolis Mayor Shank even personally writing to President Roosevelt, pleading with him to reinstate his citizenship. While Moy was unable to retain his citizenship, he died in 1914 as a beloved figure in Indianapolis. (Marion Co.)\n\nIn 1951, the Indianapolis Olympians defeated the Rochester Royals after six overtimes in the longest game in NBA history. Reportedly, free throws outnumbered baskets and the game helped lead to the creation of the twenty-four-second shot clock.\n\nIn 1965, U.S. Senator Birch Bayh introduced Senate Joint Resolution 1 thirteen months after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The Resolution became the basis for the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, regarding issues related to presidential succession. The Amendment, ratified by the states in 1967, was tested in 1973 when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned amid tax evasion allegations. In adherence with the Amendment, Congress approved President Nixon's appointment of Congressman Gerald R. Ford to the vice presidency.\n\nJanuary 7\n\nIn 1914, the Indianapolis News announced the appointment of Muncie's first policewoman, Alfaretta Hart. The wealthy reformer worked to expose the abuse of women and called for wholesale reform of Indiana's criminal justice system. Hart, who faced backlash for her efforts, devoted her salary to downtrodden and impoverished women before resigning at the end of the year due to \"health reasons.\" (Delaware Co.)\n\nIn 1927, inventor Philo T. Farnsworth applied for his first television patent. He conceived of the idea for electronic television at the age of fourteen and brought his conception to fruition in 1927 with his first electronic transmission. In 1939, he established the Farnsworth Television and Radio Company in Fort Wayne, eventually operating seven television and radio manufacturing plants in Indiana. Farnsworth also established a laboratory in Fort Wayne, where he reportedly achieved self-sustaining fusion. (Allen Co.)\n\nIn 1970, Chuckwagon Theater debuted on WTTV and introduced children to Cowboy Bob, played by actor Bob Glaze. The Indianapolis Star noted that \"Glaze became a charismatic, guitar-playing cowboy who educated children about fire safety and animals. The show served as an introduction for syndicated cartoons.\" The 30 minute show, later called Cowboy Bob’s Corral, would run for nearly twenty years.\n\nJanuary 8\n\nIn 1862, U.S. Representative from Indiana Thomas A. Hendricks lambasted the Lincoln administration in a major speech in Indianapolis. He delivered the speech during the state Democratic Party convention, which condemned Republicans for rejecting compromises that might have averted war, for its violations of freedom of the press, and for the domestic institutions of sovereign states. However, Hendricks consistently supported the war to save the Union, urged compliance with the draft, and deplored armed resistance to its enforcement.\n\nIn 1863, the U.S. Senate confirmed President Abraham Lincoln's nominee for secretary of the interior, John P. Usher of Terre Haute. According to the Miller Center, in 1840 Usher moved from New York to Indiana, where he established a law practice and befriended Lincoln. Usher served as a Whig in the Indiana General Assembly from 1850 to 1851 and became state attorney general in 1861, resigning to serve as Lincoln's assistant secretary of the interior and eventual secretary. (Vigo Co.)\n\nIn 1945, Governor Ralph F. Gates began his gubernatorial term. The Columbia City attorney and banker was elected State Commander of the American Legion in 1931 and led the Republican Party to control the Indiana General Assembly in 1944. As governor, he created the State Department of Veterans’ Affairs to aid Hoosier men and women returning from WWII in obtaining employment, education, and housing. Amid national post-war labor strikes, Gates oversaw the transition of Indiana's economy from war to peace. His administration streamlined Indiana government and worked to obtain funds for better roads and highways, higher salaries for teachers, and new state health facilities. (Whitley Co.)\n\nJanuary 9\n\nIn 1864, co-founder of Sears, Roebuck and Co., Alvah C. Roebuck, was born in Lafayette. At 22, Roebuck worked at a small jewelry store in Hammond before moving to Chicago to work as a watch repairman for Richard W. Sears, owner of a watch business. The two became business partners and incorporated their famous retail company in 1893. (Tippecanoe Co.)\n\nIn 1900, Indianapolis lawyer and Republican Congressman Albert J. Beveridge delivered a three hour speech in the U.S. Senate regarding the Philippines. His oratory propelled him to a national stage, and made him one of the biggest proponents of imperialism and American involvement in international affairs. After the Spanish-American War, Filipino nationalists fought for independence rather than be annexed by the U.S. While some Americans were uncomfortable with the idea of annexation, imperialists like Beveridge argued in favor of expansionism, in order to “protect” Filipinos and to broaden American trade opportunities. Beveridge argued in favor of annexation, stating, “‘The Pacific is the ocean of the commerce of the future’” and “’the power that rules the Pacific, therefore, is the power that rules the world, and, with the Philippines, that power is and will forever be the American Republic.’” He argued against Filipino autonomy, claiming “‘they are a barbarous race modified by three centuries of contact with a decadent race,’ utterly incapable now of self-government and not likely to be fitted for its responsibilities for many decades to come.” Beveridge’s imperialist ideology and expansion of the U.S. Navy curried favor with voters, who elected him to serve in the U.S. Senate until 1911. The following year, Beveridge accepted the nomination for governor of Indiana at the Progressive Party National Convention, although his gubernatorial bid proved unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1932, Illinois clinched a 28-21 victory over visiting Purdue University, ending the Boilermakers' 15-game winning streak. Many blamed the loss on a pre-game injury of Purdue's leading scorer and All-American, John Wooden. The senior co-captain's hand was cut when his coaches' car, which he was riding in, hit a patch of ice and overturned as they headed to the arena. However, the Boilermakers came back to post a string of eleven victories, finishing the season with a 17-1 overall record and claiming the Helms Foundation national championship (prior to NCAA postseason play). (Tippecanoe Co.)\n\nIn 1968, the first American Basketball Association All-Star game took place at Hinkle Fieldhouse. According to Greencastle's The Daily Banner, the East defeated the West and \"the nationally televised contest, with the exception of Indiana, drew the largest crowd ever to see an ABA game in Indianapolis and the stars put on a real show.\" Pacers players Roger Brown and Bob Netolicky contributed a combined 24 points.\n\nIn 1975, Virginia E. Jenckes, the first woman to represent Indiana in Congress, died in Terre Haute. In 1933, the Democrat unseated four term Congressmen Courtland C. Gillen to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. Jenckes helped end Prohibition and advocated for veterans and workers during the New Deal Era. She resigned from Congress early during her third term and returned to Terre Haute in her later years. (Vigo Co.)\n\nJanuary 10\n\nIn 1895, suffragist and lawyer Helen Gougar was admitted to the Tippecanoe County Bar. After taking the oath, she acted as her own attorney in the case against the Tippecanoe County Election Board. Gougar argued for “The Constitutional Rights of the Women of Indiana,” challenging suffrage restrictions on the basis that the Indiana Constitution did not specifically prohibit women from voting. The Lafayette Morning Journal reported that Gougar “spoke for four hours, and made an eloquent appeal for her sex and the ballot” and that the address was “one of the finest efforts of her life.” The Tippecanoe County Superior Court ruled against Gougar and women’s suffrage on April 20, 1895. She later appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1949, Henry F. Schricker became the first Indiana governor to be elected to two four-year terms. The North Judson native was elected to the state senate in 1932 and lieutenant governor in 1937. As a Democratic governor, he was intensely challenged by Republican legislatures in both terms, despite immense public popularity. Schricker's administrations were notable for the repeal in 1941 of the government reorganization laws of 1933 and legislative attempts to make welfare department records available to the public in violation of federal confidentiality requirements. Reportedly, President Franklin D. Roosevelt offered him the vice-presidential nomination in 1944, but Schricker declined. (Starke Co.)\n\nJanuary 11\n\nIn 1825, Indiana state printer John Douglass and his partner Douglass Maguire published the first issue of the Indiana Journal, originally the Western Censor and Emigrants Guide. The Journal was published for nearly eighty years in Indianapolis. Its anti-Jacksonian publishers advocated for government-sponsored internal improvements and protective tariffs that would aid Indiana’s agricultural economy, positions that aligned with the emerging Whig Party in the 1830s. In 1845, publisher John D. Defrees acquired the Journal and his use of the publication to spread Whig ideas made him an important Indiana political voice. When the Whig Party collapsed in the early 1850s, Defrees became a leader in the fusionist movement that established the Republican Party in Indiana. The Journal’s role in Harrison’s nomination and subsequent election to the presidency elevated the newspaper’s national profile. The publication’s name changed to the Indianapolis Journal in 1867. In addition to political coverage, the paper furthered the arts and contributed to the Golden Age of Indiana literature by frequently promoting Indiana authors, including James Whitcomb Riley and Lew Wallace.\n\nIn 1890, Baseball Hall of Famer Maximilian Carnarius, better known as Max Carey, was born in Terre Haute. Carey studied to be a minister and graduated from Concordia College in Fort Wayne in 1909. That summer, he played baseball with the South Bend Greens of the Central League. He continued his theological studies at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, but returned to South Bend to play ball in the summer of 1910, a move that would permanently change his career trajectory. Carey made his Major League debut with the Pittsburgh Pirates at the end of the 1910 season. He played with the Pirates until 1926. During that stretch, he led the National League in steals ten times. A consistent hitter and solid outfielder, he helped the Pirates defeat the Washington Senators in the 1925 World Series.Carey played for the Brooklyn Robins (later the Brooklyn Dodgers) from 1926 until his retirement in 1929. He managed the Pirates in 1930 and the Dodgers from 1932-1933. He later managed the Milwaukee Chicks (1944) and Fort Wayne Daisies (1950-1951) in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. He also served as president of the AAGPBL from 1945-1949. In 1961, Carey was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. (Allen Co., St. Joseph Co., and Vigo Co.)\n\nIn 1895, the Big Ten Conference formed when Purdue University president James H. Smart and leaders from the universities of Chicago, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, as well as Northwestern University met, at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago. They worked to \"organize and develop principles for the regulation of intercollegiate athletics,” which included academic and work requirements for athletes.\n\nIn 1910, a statue of Lew Wallace was installed and dedicated at Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol. Irish-American sculptor Andrew O'Connor designed the statue honoring the Crawfordsville author and Civil War general. In attendance were Indiana and Washington dignitaries, Governor Thomas Marshall, and poet James Whitcomb Riley. (Montgomery Co.)\n\nIn 1956, the Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville Railroad officially adopted the \"Monon\" Railroad name. According to Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, the line became one of the US's first entirely dieselized railroads and was one of the most used railroads in Indiana during the Civil War due to its alignment with the directional pattern of the war.\n\nJanuary 12\n\nIn 1825, James Hudson was one of three white perpetrators hanged for the murder of nine Indian men, women and children at a winter camp in Madison County. This represented a rare case during the period in which natives obtained some justice from U.S. law.\n\nIn 1874, Carl Fisher, an entrepreneur who helped make automobiles a viable form of transportation, was born in Greensburg. He co-founded the Prest-O-Lite Co. in 1904, which developed acetylene gas vehicle headlights distributed nationwide. He was co-founder and president of the Indianapolis Speedway, site of the annual 500 mile race and testing ground for new automobile technology. Fisher was a proponent of the Good Roads Movement to expand and improve the nation's road networks. He advocated construction of U.S. transcontinental roads, which enabled long-distance travel by automobile. He also developed Miami Beach into a major resort destination. (Decatur Co. and Marion Co.)\n\nIn 1916, Indianapolis experienced the greatest single day fluctuation in temperature. An arctic cold front brought the temperature from 68 degrees down to 10 degrees. The Richmond Palladium reported \"The temperature was changed from a spring-like balm[i]ness to almost zero weather. Window panes were frosted and puddles of water in the street were frozen.\"\n\nJanuary 13\n\nIn 1845, the Indiana General Assembly approved “An Act to Provide for the Procuring a Suitable Site for the Erection of a State Lunatic Asylum.” On November 21, 1848, the first five patients were admitted to the Indiana Hospital for the Insane, located just west of Indianapolis. Before Dr. John Evans and local physicians advocated for their treatment, people with mental illness were confined to jails and almshouses, often suffering neglect. In 1896, the hospital’s groundbreaking pathological laboratory was dedicated, representing a shift from mere custodial care to the development of useful treatments. Although the lab’s opening signaled an attempt by the state to take responsibility for the care of the mentally ill, due to lack of funding and understaffing, patients at the state hospital often suffered similar mistreatment. The hospital, renamed Central State Hospital in 1927, closed in 1994 amid reports of patient neglect and a nationwide movement towards community based care.\n\nIn 1890, well-known reporter and author Elmer Holmes Davis was born in Aurora. He wrote for the Indianapolis Times and became an editor for The New York Times and Adventure magazine. He served as Director of the United States Office of War Information during World War II. Davis also worked as a radio news reporter for CBS and NBC and, along Edward R. Murrow, helped soothe American anxiety during the early Cold War Era. In 1951, Davis was awarded the Peabody Radio Award for outstanding achievement in broadcasting. (Dearborn Co.)\n\nIn 1953, the Fort Wayne Pistons hosted the NBA All-Star game at Memorial Coliseum, featuring Hall of Famers Bob Cousy, Ed Macauley, and Bill Sharman. According to the Fort Wayne News-Sentinel, the game was historic because Don Barksdale became the first African American player in an All-Star Game. (Allen Co.)\n\nJanuary 14\n\nIn 1846, Governor James Whitcomb approved the Articles of Incorporation for the Female Seminary of St. Mary’s of the Woods (Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College) in Terre Haute. The school was established by Mother Theodore Guérin and the Sisters of Providence, who came to Indiana from France and worked to provide Hoosier women with educational opportunities. (Vigo Co.)\n\nIn 1861, a founder of the Republican Party Henry S. Lane was sworn in as governor, resigning two days later upon his election to the U.S. Senate. Morton had been active candidates for the gubernatorial nomination. Morton, who had been the nominee in 1856, had strong backing, but it was felt that Lane would better insure the support of conservative old-line Whigs. A compromise was worked out between the two whereby if Lane and Morton were elected and if the Republicans gained control of the new legislature, Lane would be elected to the United States Senate and Morton would succeed to the governorship. This plan proved successful and Morton went on to become a controversial Civil War governor.\n\nIn 1919, Indiana ratified the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution, prohibiting the production, transportation, and sale of alcohol. In June 1933, Hoosiers voted to repeal the Amendment and by December of that year the 21st Amendment was ratified, ending Prohibition in the United States.\n\nJanuary 15\n\nIn 1844, the University of Notre Dame was officially chartered by the Indiana General Assembly. The school was founded by French priest Reverend Edward Sorin and other members of the Congregation of Holy Cross. According to the university, \"Early Notre Dame was a university in name only. It encompassed religious novitiates, preparatory and grade schools and a manual labor school, but its classical collegiate curriculum never attracted more than a dozen students a year in the early decades.\" Notre Dame grew to become one of the US's top 25 institutions of higher learning, according to the U.S. News & World Report. (St. Joseph Co.)\n\nIn 1850, the Indiana General Assembly passed a charter for North Western Christian University (now Butler University). The school was organized by lawyer and abolitionist Ovid Butler, who envisioned an institution reflecting his ideals of freedom and equality.\n\nJanuary 16\n\nIn 1915, perhaps the earliest photograph of an Indiana high school basketball game was taken, featuring players from Wingate High School and Kokomo High School. The moment was photographically commemorated because Wingate was the defending state champion, having won back-to-back titles in 1913 and 1914, with the help of one of Indiana's best basketball players of that generation, Homer Stonebraker. (Montgomery Co. and Howard Co.)\n\nIn 1920, Indiana ratified the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, giving women the right to vote. After Hoosier suffragists convinced two-thirds of both chambers to debate the issue, Governor James P. Goodrich called a special session, during which legislators approved women's suffrage in Indiana.\n\nIn 1942, Jane Alice Peters, better known as silver screen actress Carole Lombard, died in a plane crash the day after a visit to Indianapolis for a war bond rally. Approximately 12,000 turned out to see the Fort Wayne native's return to Indiana; millions others viewed the rally through newsreels. While in the city, Lombard attended tea at the governor’s mansion, a flag-raising ceremony at the Statehouse, and ribbon-cutting at an army recruiting office. (Marion Co. and Allen Co.)\n\nJanuary 17\n\nIn 1842, black citizens met in Indianapolis to discuss organization of a statewide convention that would promote unity among the black population regarding the colonization movement. This movement advocated emancipating and returning slaves to Africa. Although Indiana state officials spoke in favor of the colonization effort, including Indiana Governor James Brown Ray, a majority of members of the black community opposed it. Some considered emigration to Jamaica, Canada, or Oregon, but African colonization received little support.\n\nIn 1920, author Gene Stratton Porter sold her \"Limberlost\" cabin in Geneva, where she penned nature-inspired books, such as Freckles and A Girl of The Limberlost. The Muncie Evening Press noted she left because \"this district has become so commercialized as to be on [sic] longer suitable for her to pursue her nature studies in.\" (Adams Co.)\n\nJanuary 18\n\nIn 1897, Representative Taylor I. Record introduced House Bill 246, also known as the \"Pi Bill,\" to the Indiana General Assembly. Amateur mathematician Dr. Edwin J. Goodwin authored the bill, declaring the value of pi to be 3.2, rather than 3.14. The House unanimously passed the bill, but before the Senate could vote, Purdue professor Dr. Clarence Waldo convinced members of the theory's inaccuracy. Although HB 246 was shelved, it garnered much ridicule.\n\nIn 1977, the Indiana General Assembly ratified the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), making Indiana the 35th state to do so. The U.S. constitutional amendment, introduced in 1923 by suffragist Alice Paul, would make it illegal to deny equal rights on account of sex and would end “the legal distinctions between men and women in terms of divorce, property, employment, and other matters.” On January 18, the Indiana Statehouse was packed with supporters and opponents of the amendment, which was ratified by the House of Representatives (53-45) and the Senate (26-24). However, Indiana was the last state to ratify the ERA, and the amendment ultimately fell three states short needed for ratification. In 2020, Virginia became the requisite 38th state to ratify, but the ERA has yet to be certified due to questions regarding the validity of ratification deadline extensions.\n\nJanuary 19\n\nIn 1809, Kentucky legislators Henry Clay and Humphrey Marshall crossed the Ohio River to duel near the mouth of Silver Creek in Indiana. Marshall opposed Clay's resolution encouraging Kentuckians to purchase from domestic manufacturers rather than European textiles until \"American rights were respected on the high seas.\" Clay challenged Marshall to a duel in Indiana, so as not to shed blood in their home state. Neither man was fatally injured, but experienced some criticism from assembly members who considered the practice below legislators. (Clark Co.)\n\nIn 1846, in response to the advocacy of local physicians, the Indiana General Assembly approved “An Act Authorizing the Erection of Suitable Buildings for the Use of the Indiana Hospital for the Insane.” This Act established what became known as Central State Hospital in Indianapolis, which treated patients suffering from mental illness and addiction. Since the hospital’s opening, lack of funding and understaffing led to patient abuse and neglect. In 1896, a groundbreaking pathology lab opened on the grounds and served as a state teaching hospital. The hospital closed in 1994 with the goal of community-based care.\n\nIn 1859, Dr. Mary F. Thomas became the first woman to address the Indiana State Legislature. She presented a petition calling for women's suffrage and property rights laws, urging \"As mothers, as wives, as daughters, as sisters, and lastly as human beings, alike responsible with yourselves to God for the correct use of the rights bestowed on us, we come to you, humiliating as it may be to ask these rights at the hands of others possessing no more natural rights than ourselves.\" Although the legislature did not take her plea seriously, she continued to work for women's rights and became president of the Indiana Woman Suffrage Association. (Wabash Co. and Wayne Co.)\n\nIn 1942, the first Hoosier Salon art exhibition opened in Indianapolis. The Hoosier Salon was established in Chicago in 1925 by members of the Daughters of Indiana. They organized the annual exhibition to generate recognition for Indiana artists, particularly for members of the Hoosier Group, such as T.C. Steele and William Forsyth. Following the Pearl Harbor attack in December 1941, the exhibition donated artwork to the Indianapolis Veterans' Hospital.\n\nIn 1961, Joseph E. Ritter was elevated to Cardinal by Pope John XXIII, the only Roman Catholic Cardinal from Indiana. The New Albany native w as ordained in 1917 and assigned to his first parish in Indianapolis. He became Bishop of Indianapolis in 1934 and in the 1930s championed the rights of African Americans in Indiana. Ritter was the first Archbishop of the new Archdiocese of Indianapolis in 1944. He was named Archbishop of St. Louis in 1946 and in 1947 he desegregated five Catholic St. Louis high schools amid protests. Cardinal Ritter was an outspoken, progressive participant in all three sessions of Vatican Council II. (Floyd Co.)\n\nIn 1994, the thermometer hit -36 degrees at New Whiteland, the coldest temperature ever recorded in Indiana. (Johnson Co.)\n\nJanuary 20\n\nIn 1828, Abraham Lincoln's sister, Sarah Lincoln Grigsby, died during childbirth in Spencer County at the age of 21. According to the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, \"Sarah Lincoln was an important person in Abraham Lincoln's life. When she had started to school, while the family was living in Kentucky, she had taken Abraham with her and had probably helped him learn his letters and numbers. When their mother died, they helped each other through the grief. Their relationship was characterized by a deep affection.\"\n\nIn 1842, the State of Indiana approved the incorporation of La Porte University. Established to provide instruction in law, literature, and medicine, classes began later that year. The medical department (renamed Indiana Medical College) trained skilled doctors in the Midwest, preparing them for the region’s medical needs in surgery, anatomy, theory, and obstetrics. Prior to the department’s opening, Indiana offered few opportunities for professional medical training. Its distinguished faculty attracted students from across the U.S. They included Dr. William W. Mayo, whose practice evolved into the Mayo Clinic, and Dr. William H. Wishard, a Civil War surgeon whose family name continues to occupy a prominent place within the Indianapolis medical field. Classes ceased around 1850, and the university consolidated with Indiana Central Medical College (1849-1852), located in Indianapolis, in 1851. (La Porte Co.)\n\nIn 1898, black volunteers from Indiana returned home from Chickamauga, where they were stationed for three months in anticipation of garrison duty during the Spanish-American War. The Bethel A.M.E. Church celebrated their return with a banquet in Indianapolis sponsored by the Soldiers' Aid Society. The soldiers were hopeful that their service would lead to social equality.\n\nIn 1986, Americans observed Martin Luther King Jr. Day for the first time due to the efforts of an Indiana lawmaker. After a previous attempt to recognize King with a national holiday failed, first year Congresswoman Katie Hall from Gary introduced a bill in July 1983. She overcame conservatives' concerns about the cost of the holiday by proposing it take place on a fixed Monday rather than King's birthday, so that offices would not have to open twice in one week. Hall reminded colleagues, “'The legislation before us will act as a national commitment to Dr. King’s vision and determination for an ideal America, which he spoke of the night before his death, where equality will always prevail.'” The bill passed Congress, and President Ronald Reagan signed the measure into law on November 2, 1983. (Lake Co.)\n\nJanuary 21\n\nIn 1862, socialist minister George Davis Herron was born in Montezuma, Indiana. In 1883, he entered the ministry in Wisconsin and was influenced by liberal theological principles, becoming active in the Society of Christian Socialists in 1889. As a pastor in Iowa he vocalized his social criticism and drew crowds as a professor of applied Christianity at Iowa College. According to the Biographical Dictionary of Iowa, Herron \"endorsed socialism publicly as a movement that embodied the sacrificial love and social solidarity of primitive Christianity. In 1900 he campaigned for the Social Democratic Party candidate, Eugene V. Debs [of Terre Haute]. He helped organize the socialist Party of America in 1901.\" Herron broke with socialism in World War I and was employed by Woodrow Wilson as a diplomat after the war to advocate for peace. (Parke Co.)\n\nIn 1875, Zerelda Wallace testified before the Indiana General Assembly, presenting 21,050 signatures on temperance petitions from forty-seven counties. In 1880, she testified before the U.S. Senate, Judiciary Committee on woman's right to vote. Wallace was the first president of Woman's Christian Temperance Union in Indiana and a member of the Equal Suffrage Society of Indianapolis. She became the First Lady of Indiana in 1837 when her husband David Wallace was elected governor.\n\nIn 1901, Democratic legislator Dr. Henry V. Passage introduced an amendment that would replace hanging with morphine injection as the method of execution of criminals . The amendment, one of the earliest American proposals for lethal injection, was tabled and the proposed amended bill voted on along party lines.\n\nJanuary 22\n\nIn 1878, Charles G. Conn and Eugene DuPont of Elkhart received a U.S. Patent for cornet improvements. Conn established the musical instrument industry in Elkhart, which has been called the Band Industry Capital of the World. He established a factory in 1875, which produced instruments until 1910 and was sold to Carl D. Greenleaf in 1915. Innovations by C.G. Conn, Ltd. under Greenleaf included promoting school band programs and one of the first musical instrument research labs. By the 1970s, about 40% of worldwide band instruments were made in Elkhart. (Elkhart Co.)\n\nIn 1944, Staff Sergeant Thomas E. McCall of Veedersburg led Company F, a machine gun section, into position to provide cover for American riflemen near San Angelo, Italy during World War II. After several artillery shells exploded near his company that killed or wounded his men and destroyed one of their guns, McCall rushed forward with the remaining machine gun and eliminated two enemy machine gun nests. The Indianapolis Star reported that he turned his sights on a third nest, and “was last seen courageously moving forward on the enemy position, firing his machine gun from his hip.” German soldiers succeeded in capturing McCall. After the war, he received the Medal of Honor for his actions. (Fountain Co.)\n\nIn 1974, dam gates lowered on the East Fork of the Whitewater River, which resulted in the formation of Brookville Lake. According to the Washington Times, construction began in 1965 by the Army Corps of Engineers, but President Richard Nixon stopped the project in 1968 due to the Vietnam War. Residents successfully petitioned for construction to be renewed in 1970 and the area became a popular tourist destination due to its campgrounds, hiking trails, and marina. (Franklin Co.)\n\nJanuary 23\n\nJanuary 24\n\nIn 1828, a turnpike company was authorized to bid out sections for Brookville State Road. Brookville Road was the principal route for goods and people moving between Indianapolis and Cincinnati. Road travel was difficult in the 1800s, taking days to reach destinations. Congress authorized the 78-mile state road in 1821, running from the Ohio border to Indianapolis through Brookville.\n\nIn 1897, the Ligonier Methodist Episcopal Church was dedicated and opened to the public. This church formed a close relationship with Ligonier's Ahavath Sholom synagogue, unusual for the time period in Indiana. The diverse group of Ligonier residents celebrated the building of new places of worship together in the nineteenth century and mourned the nation’s fallen president in the twentieth. Over several decades, the pastors and rabbis of Ligonier congregations spoke at each other’s services and delivered public lectures, fostering an atmosphere of brotherhood and scholarship.\n\nIn 1911, science fiction writer Catherine Lucille Moore (C.L.) Moore was born in Indianapolis. She attended Indiana University in 1929 and wrote for the school's student magazine The Vagabond. She withdrew from the university during the Great Depression and took a job at an Indianapolis bank, where she wrote stories for fanzines on the building’s balcony. Moore sold her first piece of work, \"Shamebleau,\" in 1933 to Weird Tales, which published several of her stories praised by contemporaries, such as H.P. Lovecraft. In the 1950s, she taught writing at the University of Southern California and wrote scripts for television shows like Maverick. Moore received several science fiction awards and was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004. Kirkus writer Andrew Liptak contended \"that her contributions to the field are instrumental in the formation of the modern face of science fiction. As one of the single female authors in the field during the 1930s, she brought a unique voice and high quality prose to the SF magazine market that earned her much well deserved fame for the rest of her life.\"\n\nIn 1970, the Indiana State Fair Coliseum hosted the third American Basketball Association All-Star game. The Denver Rocket's Spencer Haywood led the West to victory over the East during the first nationally televised ABA game. The game nearly did not take place due to the ABA Players Association threats to strike unless given recognition by the league.\n\nJanuary 25\n\nIn 1978, Indiana was hit with a blizzard lasting until the 27th. The \"Great Blizzard of 1978\" left National Weather Service (NWS) employees stranded for days and prompted the NWS to issue its first statewide Blizzard Warning. Conditions were so extreme that the National Guard dispatched utility vehicles to help stranded travelers. Governor Otis Bowen declared a snow emergency and Indiana University closed for the first time in the campus's history.\n\nJanuary 26\n\nIn 1946, fire destroyed the Evansville Shipyard, producer of 170 LST's (landing ship and tanks) during World War II. The largest inland shipyard in the U.S. helped pull Evansville out of the Great Depression and by the end of World War II 75% of the city's factories produced war ordnance. (Vanderburgh Co.)\n\nJanuary 27\n\nIn 1836, Governor Noah Noble signed the mammoth Internal Improvements Act, which authorized a $10 million loan and provided for three major canal projects, a macadamized road, and a railroad. However, according to historian Kelly Wenig, \" After years of crushing debt incurred from loans associated with the 1836 Mammoth Internal Improvements Act, the state finally defaulted on their payments to investors, and continued to do so for the next half decade. Hoosiers—because of their insolvency—were attacked from all angles by angry investors and newspapers from as far away as London.\"\n\nIn 1847, the Indiana General Assembly passed the Butler Bill to relieve the state of growing internal improvement debt then totaling over $11 million. The bill stipulated that the state would be responsible for half of the debt, and the other half would be assumed by bondholders, who in exchange for Wabash and Erie Canal stock promised to complete the canal.\n\nIn 1900, Hoosier Kitchen Cabinet’s factory burned down in Albany less than a year after the business was founded. The company relocated to New Castle, occupying the former Speeder Cycle Company's bicycle factory. By 1921, one out of every ten American homes had a Hoosier Kitchen Cabinet. (Delaware Co.)\n\nIn 1967, a fire in the Apollo 1 command module during a preflight test killed Mitchell astronaut Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom, along with Ed White and Roger Chaffee. The mission was intended to be the first manned flight of the Apollo space program. The accident resulted in safety changes in the program, allowing for the first moon landing in 1969. (Lawrence Co.)\n\nJanuary 28\n\nIn 1818, the Indiana General Assembly passed an \"Act to license and regulate taverns,\" requiring anyone operating a tavern to obtain a license from the county commissioners and pay a $500 bond. They were also required to submit twelve certificates from “respectable house-holders” which attested to their “good moral character.”\n\nIn 1822, the Indianapolis Gazette was first published by editor Nathaniel Bolton, who later sold his property to the state for establishment of Central State Hospital. In 1829, editor George L. Kinnard changed the paper's name to the Indiana State Gazette and the paper took a pro-Democratic bent, in support of Andrew Jackson's policies. In the 1830s, it was acquired and renamed the Indiana Democrat and State Gazette and in the 1840s the Indiana State Sentinel.\n\nIn 1931, an explosion ripped through the Little Betty Mine in Linton, killing twenty-eight miners. The mine, opened two years prior, provided desperately-needed employment for Hoosiers during the Great Depression. Shipping coal to cities like Chicago, Little Betty was one of the most productive in Indiana. Hoosier newspapers highlighted the solidarity and support of the local and neighboring communities following the tragedy that left approximately forty-seven children orphaned and eighteen women widowed. Eight rescue teams, comprised of Terre Haute National Guard members, Indianapolis American Legion members, and Princeton miners, took turns braving poisonous, seeping gas in their search for survivors. Women with the Salvation Army supplied rescuers with rolls and coffee, and local merchants provided families on site with cots and bedding. The Indianapolis Star noted that those who treated injured survivors at the Green County hospital demonstrated the spirit of the “war mother.” The Times (Munster) reported that Governor Harry G. Leslie, having personally donated $1,000, appealed for $35,000 in relief for the families, saying, “’We will have with us these babies and aged of the miners who perished until fifteen or twenty years from now.’” Despite widespread economic hardship, citizens organized a relief committee, comprised of bankers, businessmen, and public officials. Their efforts and the compensation of labor unions reflected the Bedford Times-Mail’s sentiment that “Linton will carry on. The Little Betty, unmindful of the havoc she has wrought, will continue to yield its black cargo. The spirit of the miner, the natives say, is not easily subdued.” That same year, the House of Representatives passed a bill, inspired by the explosion and drafted by the United Mine Workers of America, that would mandate hourly inspections for gas in mines. (Greene Co.)\n\nIn 1969, Indiana University and Purdue University officials announced they would formally merge their Indianapolis campuses to form a new university called Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). In their statement, officials noted, “We believe that the public higher education needs of young men and women in the Marion County area, as well as the economic welfare of the city and the state, require a unification of our operations in Indianapolis.” This followed pressure from Indianapolis Mayor Richard G. Lugar and the Indiana General Assembly, who wanted to create a new state university in the city. While IUPUI evolved into a prominent urban research university, its construction displaced historic African American districts like Indiana Avenue.\n\nJanuary 29\n\nIn 1851, land reformer and U.S. Representative George Washington Julian made a speech in Congress supporting Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill. Julian combined advocacy of the Homestead Bill with an abolition argument. He stated that dividing the territories into small farms would help prevent slave plantations because they needed vast estates to function. Julian's speech may have hurt the bill because of his abolition argument. Both the House and Senate failed to approve the bill. Another decade passed before Congress passed the Homestead Act.\n\nIn 1915, Lucy Higgs Nichols, an escaping slave who served as a nurse with the 23rd Regiment, Indiana Volunteers during the Civil War, died in Floyd County. Lucy came to New Albany with the returning veterans of the 23rd Regiment and applied for pension after Congress passed an 1892 act for Civil War nurses. She was denied because the War Department claimed to have no record of her work. In 1895, Lucy and fifty-five veterans of the 23rd petitioned Congress and she received her first check in 1899. (Floyd Co.)\n\nIn 1915, Disney illustrator Bill Peet was born in Grandview. He graduated from the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis and moved to Los Angeles, where he sketched characters appearing in films like \"Dumbo\" and \"Cinderella\" for Walt Disney Studios. Despite a tempestuous relationship with Disney, Peet maintained a 27-year-career with the studio and wrote screenplays, such as \"101 Dalmatians\" and \"Sword in the Stone.\" After working for Disney, Peet wrote and illustrated children's books, including The Caboose Who Got Loose, Kermit the Hermit, and Encore for Eleanor. His 1989 Bill Peet: An Autobiography, written in the form of a children's book, was a Caldecott Honor Book. (Spencer Co.)\n\nJanuary 30\n\nIn 1945, U.S. forces conducted a rescue of Allied POWs from a Japanese camp near Cabanatuan City, Philippines. The operation liberated more than 500 from the POW camp. Among those rescued was James W. Duckworth of Martinsville, a doctor who became the executive officer of the Manila Hospital Center. Six other Hoosiers were liberated, including Lt. Jarry Brown of Brownsburg, Lt. William Romme of Terre Haute, Sergeant Floyd Cooney of New Castle, and Private Carl Smith of Oakland City.\n\nIn 1957, the U.S. Senate confirmed President Eisenhower’s nominee for Surgeon General, Leroy Edgar Burney. Burney was born in Decatur County and was educated at Butler University and Indiana University. He served as Indiana’s health officer from 1945 to 1954. As surgeon general, he was the first federal official to publicly link cigarette smoking with lung cancer.\n\nJanuary 31\n\nIn 1871, Jeffersonville ceded property to the U.S. government for a permanent Quartermaster Depot, a military reservation that furnished the U.S. Army with stores. The depot had been established during the Civil War to provide storage for Union supplies. Construction of the permanent depot was complete in 1874 and the facility manufactured uniforms during the Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II. (Clark Co.)\n\nIn 1970, The Jackson 5’s debut single I Want You Back topped the Billboard Top 100. The next three singles released by the Gary band, ABC, The Love You Save, and I’ll Be There , also topped the chart in 1970. The group made history as one of the first African American boy bands to achieve immense popularity among white audiences. (Lake Co.)\n\nFebruary\n\nFebruary 1\n\nIn 1896, several buildings at the Indiana State Soldiers' Home in Lafayette opened for occupancy. In 1886, the encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic at Indianapolis spearheaded the movement for a home to serve destitute and disabled veterans and their families. The institution's name changed to the Indiana Veterans' Home in 1976, and it continues to operate as a long-term care facility for Indiana's veterans as of 2018. (Tippecanoe Co.)\n\nIn 1919, Clessie L. Cummins filed articles of incorporation for Cummins Engine Company with the secretary of state. The Columbus company generated demand for its innovative diesel engines known for their quality and reliability. During the Great Depression, Cummins engines were introduced on racecars at the Indy500, and had a good measure of success. In the post-WWII years, Cummins became an industry leader in producing diesel engines for the heavy duty truck market. The company netted $1.39 billion in income in 2016. (Bartholomew Co.)\n\nFebruary 2\n\nIn 1889, an issue of African American newspaper the Indianapolis Freeman contained its earliest known work of political cartoonist Henry Jackson Lewis. The partially-blind former slave from Mississippi is considered the first African-American political cartoonist. After sketching prehistoric Native American mounds for the Smithsonian Institute, he moved to Indianapolis, where he utilized woodblocks and chalk-plates to create political cartoons for the Freeman. Many of Lewis’s works illuminated the failure of politicians to provide African Americans with job opportunities, particularly Hoosier President Benjamin Harrison. (Marion Co.)\n\nIn 1967, the American Basketball Association formed to rival the National Basketball Association. The Indiana Pacers were an inaugural franchise and played in the league for its entire nine years of operation. The Pacers won three league championships while in the ABA. The ABA Pacers featured several Naismith Hall of Famers, including Coach Bobby “Slick” Leonard, two-time league MVP Mel Daniels, Indianapolis Washington High School and IU product George McGinnis, and playoff MVP Roger Brown. The ABA dissolved in 1976 and the NBA absorbed four ABA teams, including the Pacers, New Jersey Nets, Denver Nuggets, and San Antonio Spurs.\n\nFebruary 3\n\nIn 1809, Congress divided the Indiana Territory, and created the Illinois Territory. The act reduced the Indiana Territory to almost the exact area of Indiana at statehood (minus the ten mile wide tract later transferred from the Michigan Territory to Indiana in 1816). The Illinois Territory contained modern-day Illinois and Wisconsin, and parts of Minnesota and the upper peninsula of Michigan.\n\nIn 1913, the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul opened a state-of-the-art hospital on Fall Creek Parkway in Indianapolis. It was the hospital’s third location in the city since 1881. St. Vincent’s Hospital improved and expanded its facilities and services to include a nursing school and residence hall in 1927, and a thirty-five-bed children's department in 1939. The Daughters of Charity moved to a convent built on the grounds in 1960 to make room for sixty-five additional patient beds. Building and land limitations resulted in a move to the 86th Street site in 1974. Ivy Tech Community College purchased the Indianapolis site in 2006.\n\nIn 1933, the Indiana General Assembly passed the Executive Reorganization Act, Governor Paul V. McNutt's signature achievement. This act reorganized more than 100 separate divisions of government into eight departments, overseen directly by the governor. Historian James H. Madison noted, \"Leaders in both parties lamented the state's bureaucratic disorder and inefficiencies. More than one hundred departments and agencies existed in a patchwork of uncertain authority and control.\" McNutt's act ensured that the new departments' responsibilities were \"more clearly defined and control more centrally administered.\"\n\nIn 1945, record-setting quarterback Bob Griese was born in Evansville. He excelled at athletics at Rex Mundi High School, playing baseball, basketball, and football, and earning twelve varsity letters. Although several colleges tried to recruit Griese, he chose Purdue University, where he became a 2-time All-American football player. In 1967, the American Football League’s Miami Dolphins drafted him. During his time with the Dolphins, he was a 6-time Pro Bowler and 2-time All-Pro, and helped lead the team to two Super Bowls. Griese was one of three quarterbacks who played for Purdue to win the Super Bowl, including Len Dawson and Drew Brees. After retirement, he worked as a television commentator for NBC Sports, ESPN, and ABC Sports. In 1990, Griese was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame and the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1992. (Vanderburgh Co.)\n\nFebruary 4\n\nIn 1865, Governor Warren McCray was born on a farm in Newton County. He worked in banking and grain dealing and later bred Hereford cattle at his Orchard Lake Stock Farm. McCray served on state charitable and agricultural boards, before entering state politics in 1915 as a Republican gubernatorial candidate. In 1920, at the close of the Progressive Era, McCray was elected governor of Indiana. While fiscally conservative and a proponent of limited state government, Governor McCray supported Progressive reforms such as improvement of roads and education. He also opposed the Ku Klux Klan and advocated for women’s rights, appointing several women to prominent positions. McCray was forced to resign in 1924 after a mail fraud conviction, but President Herbert Hoover pardoned him in 1930. (Newton Co.)\n\nIn 1918, the U.S. Army established an aviation repair depot in Speedway, due to its proximity to military airfields, railroads, and industry. The area became an innovative aviation hub during World War I. Pilots frequently used the aviation repair depot and the Speedway track, which was converted to a flight test field, as a stopping point for repairs. Italian Pomilio Bros. Corp. developed aircraft here for the Liberty engine produced by Nordyke & Marmon with parts by Allison Experimental Co. By the fall of 1920 the depot ceased operations, but WWI efforts increased pilot safety and aircraft structural integrity.\n\nIn 2001, legendary jazz trombonist and composer J.J. Johnson died in his native Indianapolis. His innovative style, such as \"transferring bebop to the trombone,\" earned him the title of \"the most influential trombonist in postwar [World War II] jazz.\" After graduating from Crispus Attucks High School, Johnson traveled with Midwestern bands led by Snookum Russell and Clarence Love. In 1942, he returned to Indianapolis and Benny Carter hired Johnson to play with his big band for three years. He composed music in the 1960s, and moved to Los Angeles in 1970, where he contributed music for films like \"Cleopatra Jones,\" and television shows like “Six Million Dollar Man.” Johnson continued to perform and record his unique pieces until retiring from public performance in 1997.\n\nIn 2007, the Colts, led by quarterback Peyton Manning, played in their first Super Bowl game since moving to Indianapolis. The team defeated the Chicago Bears at Miami’s Dolphin Stadium to win the title of World Champions. The game made NFL history as the first Super Bowl in which African American head coaches, the Colts’ Tony Dungy and the Bears’ Lovie Smith, led both teams.\n\nFebruary 5\n\nIn 1862, the U.S. Senate expelled Senator Jesse Bright of Indiana because of disloyalty to the Union. After the First Battle of Bull Run, Union troops captured a Texas arms merchant, who had in his possession a letter of recommendation from Senator Bright to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. In the letter, Bright endorsed the merchant and his stock of firearms. After his expulsion, Bright sought to reclaim his seat, but the Democrat-controlled Indiana General Assembly refused to return their fellow Democrat to Washington. (Jefferson Co.)\n\nIn 1867, anti-Ku Klux Klan crusader, newspaper editor, satirist, and one-term Muncie mayor George R. Dale was born in Monticello, White County. He used the power of the pen in the Muncie Post-Democrat to combat the rising influence of the KKK, skewering Klan members with statements like, \"Aint it grand to be a one hundred percent American and wear your wife's nightie and a mother goose cap?\" Despite threats on his life, Dale won Muncie's 1929 mayoral race and served until 1935. His first action as mayor was to fire all members of the city's police force, many of whom supported the Klan's efforts. (Delaware Co.)\n\nIn 1873, the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic religious order devoted to caring for the elderly poor, arrived in Indianapolis to establish a home. At a time when the elderly were often ignored and unseen, the Little Sisters of the Poor provided assistance. The sisters opened the home to anyone over the age of sixty with no means of support, regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity. The Little Sisters solicited alms daily to provide shelter, comfort, and basic nursing care for residents. Their dedication garnered widespread appreciation. In 1967, the home moved to 2345 West 86th Street as the St. Augustine Home for the Aged.\n\nIn 1970, President Richard Nixon visited Indianapolis, marking his first presidential visit outside of Washington DC since his inauguration. He led a Presidential Council on Urban Affairs in which he hosted nine Indiana Mayors to discuss major city issues and the federal government’s role in aiding states at the local level. In a short 7-minute speech outside Indianapolis’ City Hall Nixon stated, “Today we are bringing Washington [D.C.] to Indianapolis and to the cities!” While more symbolic than practical, the visit was well received by the public and local newspapers, a welcome reprieve for the administration from the harsh criticisms and vigorous protests regarding his policies in the Vietnam War. Additionally, the visit was a watershed moment for then Indianapolis Mayor Richard Lugar, who used his newfound relationship with President Nixon to maneuver into national politics. In the years following the President’s visit, Lugar, who would be dubbed “Nixon’s Favorite Mayor” by the press, would attend several high profile national and world events on the administration’s behalf. Even after the infamous Watergate Scandal, Lugar remained a popular politician in Indiana and was elected to the US Senate in 1976, where he would serve for over three decades and become known as a preeminent statesman and expert in foreign policy.\n\nFebruary 6\n\nIn 1837, the Indiana General Assembly passed a law that authorized the Indiana Geological Survey, and established the position of state geologist. Governor Noah Noble appointed David Dale Owen as the first state geologist later that year. Governor Noble informed legislators in 1836 that a scientific survey would enable the state to better develop its mineral resources. During the study, Owen, t he son of New Harmony founder Robert Dale Owen, studied the Wabash and Ohio rivers and sampled formations. He spent the majority of his survey in southern Indiana, where he evaluated salt, limestone, and iron. Historian Donald Carmony concluded that Owen's initial survey findings \"were significant achievements and particularly so when viewed in the context of geological knowledge as of that time.\" The 1837 Indiana Geological Survey evolved into a research institute at Indiana University.\n\nIn 1914, the Municipal Art League of Chicago purchased Frank V. Dudley’s painting, One Winter’s Afternoon. Best known for capturing the beauty of the Indiana Dunes, Frank V. Dudley (1868-1957) was also a master of the winter landscape. One Winter’s Afternoon, now in the collection of the Union League Club of Chicago, depicts the “subtle and silent beauty” of the chilly day. According to the League’s description: “Human presence is acknowledged only by the fresh and narrow path carved in the snow, leading from the foreground to the rough-hewn barn . . . Expansive shadows indicate the late afternoon sun and impending evening.” Dudley’s work helped bring public attention to the unique ecosystem of the Dunes and was partly responsible for the preservation of the area as the Indiana Dunes State Park in 1923.\n\nIn 1918, a fire at the Indiana Reformatory at Jeffersonville caused $300,000 in damage. None of the 1,500 prisoners were injured in the blaze. Guards temporarily transferred the inmates to a nearby schoolhouse to await transfer to Michigan City. In lieu of rebuilding the reformatory in Jeffersonville, the Indiana General Assembly decided to build a new facility in Pendleton, which opened on November 19, 1923. (Clark Co.)\n\nIn 1939, Army Air Corps pilot First Lieutenant Richard S. Freeman, a Pulaski County native, arrived in Santiago, Chile aboard a super-bomber “loaded with 3,200 pounds of medical supplies instead of bombs.” Freeman was a part of the flight crew on a humanitarian mission to help victims of the Chilean earthquake, an 8.3 magnitude quake which claimed over 30,000 lives. For his service, the Army awarded Freeman and his crewmates the Mackay trophy. Two years to the day later, in 1941, Captain Freeman died when his B-17-B bomber crashed in Nevada during an experimental exercise. All eight of the flight crew died. The West Point graduate posthumously received the Distinguished Flying Cross. His body was returned to Winimac for burial. Freeman Field, a World War II Army Air Forces training school in Seymour, Jackson County, was named in honor of Captain Freeman. (Pulaski Co.)\n\nIn 1952, civil rights leader and anti-lynching activist Katherine \"Flossie\" Bailey died. She became involved with the NAACP​ in 1918 when she founded the Marion chapter of the organization. In 1930, she assumed the presidency of the state NAACP conference. She is best known for her work to bring the perpetrators of the 1930 Marion lynching of Abe Smith and Tom Shipp to justice. Largely due to her tireless work, two of the several dozen members of the lynch mob were arrested and tried. However, the all-white jury returned a not-guilty verdict. Despite this, Bailey kept up her work with the NAACP and successfully lobbied for new anti-lynching laws in Indiana. The NAACP's national office recognized Bailey with the Madam C. J. Walker Medal in 1931 for her anti-lynching crusade. (Grant Co.)\n\nFebruary 7\n\nIn 1835, the Indiana General Assembly approved an act that created Adams, Wells, Jay, DeKalb, Steuben, Whitley, Kosciusko, Fulton, Marshall, Starke, Pulaski, Jasper, Newton, and Porter counties. Lake, Blackford, and Benton were later formed from three of these counties. Newton County was consolidated with Jasper in 1839, but made separate again in 1859.\n\nIn 1896, businessman, congressman, and vice-presidential candidate William H. English died in Indianapolis. Voters elected him to the Indiana House of Representatives in 1851 and he became one of the youngest Speakers in Indiana history at 29 years old. As member of Congress from 1853-1861, English became associated with a controversial bill bearing his name that exacerbated tensions in “Bleeding Kansas.” English left Congress before the Civil War, and entered the private sector. He served as president of the First National Bank of Indianapolis for fourteen years, which became one of the largest banks in the Midwest. During the Panic of 1873, he used his financial position to obtain real estate through foreclosures. In 1880, the Democratic Party nominated English for the vice-presidency, on the ticket with General Winfield Scott Hancock. They lost to Republicans James Garfield and Chester Arthur. During his later years, he developed an interest in history, particularly concerning George Rogers Clark and collecting biographies of Indiana General Assembly members.\n\nFebruary 8\n\nIn 1875, artist Frederick C. Yohn was born in Indianapolis. Yohn illustrated magazines and books, and specialized in historical and military subjects. He illustrated works by Hoosiers including Meredith Nicholson’s A Hoosier Chronicle, and Maurice Thompson’s best-seller Alice of Old Vincennes. Perhaps Yohn’s best-known painting among Hoosiers is The Fall of Fort Sackville, which depicts General Hamilton’s surrender to George Rogers Clark. The painting was the basis for the commemorative postage stamp issued in 1929 for the event’s sesquicentennial.\n\nIn 1901, Indiana University competed in its first intercollegiate basketball game. They played Butler in an away game at the Indianapolis YMCA. Butler prevailed 20-17.\n\nIn 1919, department managers at Remy Electric Company in Anderson learned that the company had become a subsidiary of the General Motors Company. Remy, a supplier of automobile electrical equipment, had been part of the United Motors Corporation for the previous five years. (Madison Co.)\n\nIn 1931, iconic film actor James Dean was born in Marion. Shortly after his birth, Dean moved to Fairmount, Grant County, where he was raised in a Quaker household. Dean excelled in athletics and drama at Fairmount High School before majoring in drama at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1949. He went on to star in three films: \"East of Eden,\" \"Rebel without a Cause,\" and “Giant.” His portrayals of angst-ridden teenagers symbolized a generation. Just as he achieved national success, Dean was tragically killed in a car crash on a California highway in 1955 at the age of 24. The Fairmount Friends Church held services for the actor on October 8 and Dean’s body was buried at Park Cemetery near the farm where he grew up. (Grant Co.)\n\nIn 1981, famed Black author and poet Maya Angelou spoke at the St. Peter Claver Center as part of the Indianapolis Public Library’s African American History Month programming. She discussed literature and issues related to race, such as representation on television and segregation within the feminist movement. Angelou recited poetry and emphasized the value of artistic expression, noting “’If a writer tells the truth about his or her experiences, every human being in the world understands it. He is speaking a truth we cannot deny.’” She also highlighted the importance of identifying inspirational figures, stating “People live in direct relation to the heroes and sheroes they have. Without them, young people have nothing to hope for. We can’t do that!” After delivering a speech that was punctuated with applause, the Pulitzer Prize winner signed books and engaged with admiring fans.\n\nFebruary 9\n\nIn 1866, playwright George Ade was born in Kentland. After graduating from Purdue University, he wrote for the Chicago Record, where his editorial column \"Stories of the Streets and of the Town\" captured the vernacular and distinct dialects of the multi-ethnic city. Ade wrote several books, but his Fables in Slang became a national best-seller and led to a weekly syndication of fables. His 1902 opera The Sultan of Sulu, along with The County Chairman and The College Widow, qualified him as one of the best playwrights of the era. (Newton Co.)\n\nIn 1982, President Ronald Reagan visited Indianapolis, the last stop of his two-day midwestern tour, and delivered a 20-minute speech to the Indiana General Assembly. President Reagan sought support for his New Federalist agenda, which would transfer administrative and, for some programs, financial responsibility from the federal government back to the state and local level. The Indianapolis Star reported that the administration planned for “states to assume control of 43 programs now operated and funded by the federal government. . . . The plan would involve the shifting of $50 billion of government programs.” While many Republican governors supported the philosophy of New Federalism, they hesitated to subsume responsibilities for these programs and the subsequent fiscal and administrative responsibilities. During his speech, Reagan drew upon his classic oratory style, promising Indiana legislators that if they supported his proposal they “will break even [financially and administratively] and there will be no gamble.” Reactions to the visit fell largely along party lines. Conservatives lauded Reagan’s openness to local input, while Democrats criticized the slashing of government services, which they believed would increase wealth gaps between the wealthy and the economically disadvantaged. Ultimately, Reagan achieved mixed results for his New Federalist agenda. Although he failed to transfer the forty-three federal programs to the state’s jurisdiction, he cut the federal government’s role in other ways, such as reducing social welfare programs and consolidating categorical grants. Reagan’s version of New Federalism and “Reaganomics” (a colloquial umbrella term for Reagan’s neoliberal economic agenda) had an enduring impact on American government and continues to be espoused by some conservative lawmakers as the ideal model of federal governance.\n\nIn 1985, Indianapolis hosted NBA All-Star Game festivities at the Hoosier Dome. While the game was scheduled for Sunday, February 10, a lot of the excitement focused on the second annual Slam Dunk Contest held on Saturday, the 9th. The 1985 contest featured some of the greatest stars and dunkers of that generation. The line-up included Julius “Dr. J” Erving, Clyde “The Glide” Drexler, Dominique “Human Highlight Film” Wilkins, Darrell “Dr. Dunkenstein” Griffith, 1984 contest-winner Larry Nance, and Chicago Bulls’ rookie Michael Jordan. Lost in the shine of all that star power was Indiana Pacers rookie Terrence Stansbury, who stole the show in the first round with a 360° statue of liberty dunk. In the semi-finals, Jordan dunked from the free throw line to advance to the finals with Wilkins. Sports Illustrated called this matchup, “Chapter one of the greatest rivalry in the event’s history.” Wilkins clinched the crown with one of his signature two-hand windmill jams. The next day a crowd of 43,000 witnessed the West All-Stars beat the East All-Stars despite the 43 combined points from Larry Bird of French Lick and IU-product Isaiah Thomas.\n\nFebruary 10\n\nIn 1763, representatives from Great Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal signed the Treaty of Paris, which concluded the Seven Years’ War. One of the provisions of the treaty transferred French claims east of the Mississippi River (including Vincennes and the future site of Indiana) to Great Britain.\n\nOTD in 1839, Father Benjamin Marie Petit died of typhoid fever, contracted while accompanying a band of 859 Potawatomi on their forced 660-mile march from Indiana to present-day Kansas, now known as the Trail of Death. He was only 27-years old. More than forty Potawatomi, many of them children, also died on the trek. Petit was born in France in 1811 and entered the Seminary of St. Sulpice in 1835. Eager for missionary work, he came to the United States in 1836 to join Bishop Simon Bruté of the Vincennes Diocese. Petit arrived in Indiana later that year. In October 1837 Bishop Bruté ordained Father Petit and the new priest immediately set out to join the Potawatomi of northern Indiana. He wrote: “A priest yesterday, I said my first Mass today, and in two days I shall go to South Bend to console a tribe of Indians who have addressed a touching petition to Monseigneur for a new priest.” Less than a year later, Father Petit held his final services in his Indiana cabin-chapel. He wrote to his family September 1838: “I said Mass. Then my dear church was stripped of all its ornaments, and at the moment of my departure I called all my children together. I spoke to them one more time; I wept; my listeners sobbed. It was heart-rending.” After accompanying them on the forced march, Father Petit fell ill on his return journey to Indiana. Accompanied by his friend Nan-wesh-mah (Abram Burnett), he made the journey as far as a St. Louis Jesuit seminary where he died. In 1859, Father Edward Sorin of Notre Dame University returned Father Petit’s body to Indiana and laid him to rest at the Log Chapel at Notre Dame. (Knox and Vigo Co.)\n\nFebruary 11\n\nIn 1825, the Indiana General Assembly approved an act that established the Indiana State Library to serve state officials and legislators in Indianapolis. An 1895 law placed the State Board of Education in charge of library management and the library experienced a “large increase in material, service, and usefulness, as it also witnessed the beginning of the spread of popular libraries throughout the state.\" The General Assembly approved an act in 1925 that merged the Indiana Historical Bureau , State Library, and Legislative Bureau into the Indiana Library and Historical Department. In 1929, legislators authorized raising funds for a new building, to be located on the corner of Senate Avenue and Ohio Street. The building opened in 1934. According to the library’s website, \"Through its history, the Indiana State Library has developed strong collections in the fields of Indiana history and culture, Indiana state government and United States government publications, Indiana newspapers, genealogy and family history resources on Indiana and the eastern United States.\"\n\nIn 1861, President-elect Abraham Lincoln stopped in Indianapolis on his journey through Indiana, en route to Washington for his first inauguration. His train arrived that evening to a welcome from Governor Oliver P. Morton and 20,000 supporters. He addressed the citizens of Indiana from the train platform before he disembarked to his hotel room at the Bates House. Lincoln adherents called upon the president-elect later that evening, and he delivered an ad hoc speech from a balcony of the hotel. He resumed his journey east the next morning, which also happened to be his fifty-second birthday.\n\nFebruary 12\n\nIn 1817, both chambers of the U.S. Congress assembled to count the electoral votes from 1816. New York Congressman John W. Taylor interrupted the proceedings, and questioned whether Indiana's votes should be tallied since Indiana voters cast their ballots for presidential electors before Indiana became a state on December 11, 1816. In the ensuing debate, Indiana Congressman William Hendricks rose and argued for counting Indiana electoral votes. The House of Representatives ultimately ignored Taylor's objection, and allowed Indiana's three electoral votes in favor of James Monroe. Not that the votes mattered as Monroe soundly defeated his Federalist opponent Rufus King, 183-34.\n\nIn 1891, prominent abolitionist and orator Stephen S. Harding died in Milan. He was born in New York in 1808 and moved with his family to Ripley County in 1820. Here, he practiced law and delivered powerful anti-slavery speeches throughout the area, often against public sentiment. An early leader in the opposition to slavery, Harding helped to bring freedom to enslaved people in the U.S. He was active in the Liberty, Free Soil, and Republican parties during his lifetime. He received several political appointments from President Abraham Lincoln including governor of the Utah Territory, and chief justice of the Colorado Territory Supreme Court. (Ripley Co.)\n\nIn 1904, Lillian Thomas Fox, Indiana State Organizer for the National Association of Colored Women, convened a meeting at the Flanner Guild in Indianapolis to take the first steps toward organizing a state federation of colored women’s clubs. Representatives of fourteen clubs from Indianapolis and other Indiana towns attended this preliminary meeting. Delegates formally organized the Indiana Federation of Colored Women's Clubs in April with the goal to \"'improve existing conditions and to ask for racial fair-play” during an era of increased prejudice and lynchings. The Federation also worked to demonstrate the accomplishments of black women, serve the less fortunate, and give strength to one another by cooperation.\n\nFebruary 13\n\nIn 1834, the directors of the second State Bank of Indiana met for the first time. During their two-day meeting, they planned the location of ten bank branches at Indianapolis, Lawrenceburg, Richmond, Madison, New Albany, Evansville, Vincennes, Bedford, Terre Haute, and Lafayette. The State Bank operated from 1834-1859 when its charter expired. During its years of operation, it served as a bulwark against the Panic of 1837 and ensuing depression, and aided the growth of Indiana’s then undeveloped economy.\n\nIn 1920, Charles I. Taylor of the Indianapolis ABCs and other owners of African American baseball teams met in Kansas City, Missouri to form the Negro National League. Taylor served as vice president of the new league until his death in 1922. Although the ABCs (the name came from the initials of the original team owners and managers Adams, Butler, and Conoyer. The name was later associated with one time team sponsor the American Brewing Company) played games as early as 1907 as an independent club, their game on May 2, 1920 against the Chicago Giants was the first game played in the Negro National League. According to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, these leagues “became centerpieces for economic development in many black communities.”\n\nIn 1937, Governor M. Clifford Townsend declared martial law in Madison County. After the settlement of a 43 day labor strike by United Automobile Workers Association at General Motors-owned Guide Lamp Corporation in Anderson, violence erupted after midnight on February 13 between an arms-wielding faction of pro-union workers and a tavern owner. Conditions deteriorated from there. State police were the first on the scene, and 1,000 National Guardsmen soon joined them. The authorities successfully turned away a caravan of strike supporters from Michigan, and escorted them back to the state line. The governor lifted martial law after 10 days, on February 23.\n\nIn 1974, Governor Otis R. Bowen approved Public Law No. 60, which repealed all laws concerning sterilization of the mentally ill in Indiana. By the late 1800s, Indiana legislators enacted laws based on the belief that criminality, mental problems, and pauperism were hereditary. In 1907, Governor J. Frank Hanly approved the first state eugenics law, which made sterilization mandatory for certain individuals in state custody. Governor Thomas R. Marshall halted sterilizations in 1909 and the Indiana Supreme Court ruled the 1907 law unconstitutional in 1921. A 1927 law reinstated sterilization and added court appeals. Approximately 2,500 in state custody were sterilized under state law.\n\nFebruary 14\n\nIn 1841, William LaMaster was born in Shelbyville. LaMaster served in the Civil War. He returned to Shelbyville, where he established a law practice. LaMaster wrote for Indiana newspapers like the Indianapolis News, in which he advocated for religious skepticism, scientific advancement, and anti-temperance. His Iconoclast helped to cement a growing freethought community in Indianapolis through the 1880s, which included notable Hoosiers like Clemens Vonnegut. (Shelby Co.)\n\nIn 1913, controversial labor organizer James \"Jimmy\" Hoffa was born in Brazil. His family moved to Detroit in 1924, where he worked at a warehouse in the 1930s and began organizing union activities. He served as president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters from 1957 to 1971. His fraternization with organized crime figures drew the attention of the federal government and in 1967 he was sentenced to thirteen years in prison for jury tampering, conspiracy, and fraud. He served as president of the Teamsters while in prison until President Richard Nixon commuted his sentence in 1971. Hoffa disappeared in 1975 under mysterious circumstances possibly related to a meeting with a Mafia-related Teamster. (Clay Co.)\n\nIn 1947, the Indiana House unanimously passed a Senate bill that prohibited conspiracy \"for the purpose of creating malicious hatred by reason of race, color or religion\" and criminalized \"racketeering in hatred.\" It also prevented hate organizations from operating in Indiana. Governor Ralph Gates, who promised, “I am going to smash the Klan in Indiana,” ordered the bill to be drafted and signed it into law. Lawmakers repealed the law in 1977 during an overhaul of Indiana's criminal code.\n\nFebruary 15\n\nIn 1848, Governor James Whitcomb signed an act incorporating the Cannelton Cotton Mill Company in Perry County. With the textile mill, founder Hamilton Smith hoped to make a profit and \"'also had dreams of founding a model industrial community on the frontier.'\" Due to his lobbying, in 1848 the Indiana legislature chartered eight factories in Cannelton, including five cotton mills, a glass company, a paper mill, and a foundry. When the first wave of workers arrived in December 1850, they experienced a housing shortage, an ongoing problem for workers who had been promised an idyllic community in the model of Lowell, Massachusetts with company-owned housing. The Cannelton mill became one of the largest cotton mills in the United States. It operated under various owners and managers for almost a century. (Perry Co.)\n\nIn 1905, author, soldier, and statesman General Lew Wallace died in his hometown of Crawfordsville. A lawyer and state senator before the Civil War, Wallace advanced through the Union Army ranks from colonel to major general before his 35th birthday in 1862. He led divisions at the battles of Fort Donelson, Shiloh, and Monocacy (dubbed the “Battle that saved Washington”). After the war, he received political appointments as governor of the New Mexico Territory (1878-1881), and U.S. Minister to Turkey (the Ottoman Empire) (1881-1885). Despite these accomplished careers, Wallace is best-known as an author. His 1880 book, Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, was one of the best-selling novels of the 19th century. (Montgomery Co.)\n\nIn 1928, Norman Bridwell was born in Kokomo. After graduating from Kokomo High School, he attended John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis and Cooper Union in New York City. He began his career as a commercial artist. At age 35, Bridwell achieved national fame with his children’s book Clifford the Big Red Dog. (Howard Co.)\n\nIn 1950, the Dubois County Daily Herald proclaimed \"Garbage Man Gets Walking Papers in Jasper.\" The article reported the Jasper city council's surprising decision to contract with the General Electric Company to install garbage disposals in all Jasper homes and discontinue the public collection of garbage. This pioneering sanitation experiment was designed to curb disease and pollution and was one of the first of its kind in the country. Garbage collectors still dispose of our trash, so what happened? Find out through this Indiana Magazine of History article.\n\nFebruary 16\n\nIn 1852, brothers Henry and Clement Studebaker opened the H & C Studebaker blacksmith shop on the corner of Michigan and Jefferson streets in South Bend. The brothers built and sold only two wagons their first year. A decade later, however, as the Army required wagons for the Civil War, Studebakers’ sales excelled. In addition to building wagons, the Studebakers’ diversified their product line, and built their first carriage in 1857. Sales of their carriages boomed after the war, and grew from 6,000 in 1867 to 75,000 in 1887. With the advent of the automobile, many carriage companies tried and failed to transition from one generation of transportation to the next. Studebaker, however, was one of few able to adapt, and not only survive, but thrive. Studebaker was successful for its first three decades of automobile production, but struggled through the Great Depression. The company rebounded as World War II defense contracts bolstered production. According to the Smithsonian Libraries, in the post-war era Studebaker \"was among the first auto manufacturers to introduce new styles rather than warmed over pre-war models. The 1947 Starlight Coupe included a wraparound rear-window and the 1950 models were styled with the now famous 'bullet nose.'\" Lowey, Speedster, Lark, and Hawk models introduced in the 1950s experienced immense popularity among consumers. Financial shortcomings caused Studebaker to close its South Bend plant in 1963. Production at their Canadian plant ceased completely in 1966. (St. Joseph)\n\nIn 1928, Special Judge Charles M. McCabe found Governor Edward L. Jackson not guilty of trying to bribe former Governor Warren T. McCray for the office of Marion County prosecutor. The Greencastle Daily Banner reported \"The acquittal was on the ground that the state had failed to prove [t]here had been any positive act of concealment of the alleged offer to bribe that would cause a cessation of operation of the statute of limitations.\" While acquitted in this case, Jackson's administration was plagued with repercussions from political scandals involving D. C. Stephenson and the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nIn 1951, the Sporting News named Indiana University basketball forward Bill Garrett, and Kansas center Clyde Lovellette (of Terre Haute), as First Team All-Americans. Indianapolis Recorder sportswriter Cy Kritzer remarked on the IU star “Above all, he [Garrett] was a playmaker. The game has none better than the Hoosier star on the fast break.” In 1947, African American civic leaders in Indianapolis worked with IU president Herman B Wells to give Garrett a chance to play for IU. His 1948 varsity debut directly challenged the Big Ten’s unwritten rule that barred African Americans from playing basketball. Garrett’s IU years saw parts of the campus desegregated and his achievements helped create opportunities for other black players in the Midwest.\n\nIn 1986, the Indianapolis Public Library sponsored “An Afternoon with Shirley Chisholm,” which took place at the Peter Claver Center. Chisholm was the first Black woman elected to the U.S. Congress and the first African American to run for president on a major party ticket. Black Indiana Senator Julia Carson introduced Chisholm, who spoke about public apathy, asking the Indianapolis audience, “My beloved friends, what has happened to you?” She argued that the gains made by the women’s liberation and civil rights movements had been eroded because Americans had disengaged from the political process and failed to keep elected officials accountable. Chisholm ended her talk by encouraging the audience to resurrect “old coalitions” that could agitate for change. The “unbought and unbossed” leader stated, “This is a great country. But I will never cease speaking out against its wrongs and inequities.”\n\nFebruary 17\n\nIn 1892, composer James F. Hanley was born in Rensselaer. He became part of the New York Tin Pan Alley music scene and wrote Broadway musical hits, such as \"Second Hand Rose\" and \"Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart,” popularized by Judy Garland 1938. Hanley co-wrote \"(Back Home Again in) Indiana\" in 1917, which became an immediate hit. Louis Armstrong recorded a jazz version of the song in the 1920s and Benny Goodman recorded a swing version in the 1930s. “Indiana” has been performed at every Indianapolis 500 race since 1946 (most notably sung by actor Jim Nabors from 1972-2014) (Jasper Co.)\n\nFebruary 18\n\nIn 1851, journalist and suffragist Ida A. Husted Harper was born in Fairfield, Franklin County. She moved to Muncie, where she graduated high school, and attended Indiana University before withdrawing to teach in Peru, Miami County. She settled in Terre Haute with her husband Thomas W. Harper, an attorney, political leader, and associate of Eugene V. Debs. Despite her husband’s disapproval, she wrote for local newspapers, penning a column entitled “A Woman’s Opinions” for the Terre Haute Saturday Evening Mail. Harper helped establish the state woman suffrage society in 1887.In 1896 she directed public relations for the National American Woman Suffrage Association in California. Prominent suffragist Susan B. Anthony solicited Harper to write a three-volume biography about her life and work. Harper also published volumes for the History of Woman Suffrage series and edited women's columns for several newspapers around the nation. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, \"the steady stream of letters, articles, and pamphlets that issued from her office in Washington, D.C., played a large role in the successful campaign for passage of the Nineteenth Amendment.\"\n\nIn 1888, fires for glassmaking ignited at the Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company in Muncie. The company led the nation in production of fruit jars by 1900. Ball Brothers expanded operations in Muncie and into other states, eventually producing plastics, rubber, and materials used in aerospace technology. The Muncie plant closed in 1962, but the company’s philanthropic gifts left a legacy of public health and education in the city. Ball Brothers funded a teacher’s college that evolved into Ball State University. (Delaware Co.)\n\nIn 1892, lawyer, corporate executive, and statesman Wendell Willkie was born in Elwood. In 1940, he became the Republican candidate for U.S. president despite never having held an elected office. After losing the election to Franklin D. Roosevelt, he continued fighting for civil rights and advocated for the equal treatment of African Americans in the Armed Forces during World War II. He also became friends and political allies with President Roosevelt and served the president as a U.S. emissary. Willkie traveled the world, observed the war abroad, and met with foreign leaders. As an internationalist, he worked for \"world peace\" and in 1943 wrote about his global experiences in his book One World. (Madison Co.)\n\nFebruary 19\n\nIn 1831, the Vincennes Gazette published what is currently the earliest known printed variation of the word “hoosier.” In a letter to the editor from the pseudonymous “Rackoon,” the author wrote, “ The \"Hoosher\" country is coming out, and the day is not far distant, when some states which have hitherto looked upon us as a kind of outlandish, half-civilized race, will have to follow in our train. - Let the \"Half-horse, half-alligator\" coun [sic] country look to it.” (Knox Co.)\n\nIn 1891, lawyer, suffragist, writer, and lecturer Helen M. Gougar spoke before the Indiana General Assembly. The Indiana State Senate Journal described the proceedings and noted that Gougar “delivered an eloquent and earnest address on prohibition, municipal suffrage, and other social and political reforms, making a strong appeal to the Senate for the enactment of laws on these subjects.” She also challenged suffrage laws by attempting to vote in 1894. She was denied and filed suit against the Tippecanoe County election board. While few women were lawyers at the time, Gougar gained admission to the bar and argued for “The Constitutional Rights of the Women of Indiana” before the Tippecanoe County Circuit Court in 1895 and the Indiana Supreme Court in 1897.\n\nIn 1939, \"dunking donuts\" comedian Red Skelton put on five shows and emceed a vaudeville revue at the Pantheon Theatre in Vincennes. Skelton’s wife Edna Stillwell wrote the act and played opposite him. By the late 1930s, Skelton had become famous for his vaudeville and radio skits. His Vincennes performance served as a gesture of gratitude to his hometown for their support. Skelton helped popularize television in the 1950s with The Red Skelton Show, which aired for twenty years and won multiple Emmy Awards. (Knox Co.)\n\nIn 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed HR 2470, which authorized the creation of the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial in Indiana. The State of Indiana previously established a memorial honoring Abraham Lincoln and his mother in Spencer County, but the congressional resolution signed by Kennedy recognized the home's national significance. Lincoln lived in the area from 1816 to 1830 and, according to the National Park Service, the Boyhood Memorial \"preserves the place where he learned to laugh with his father, cried over the death of his mother, read the books that opened his mind, and triumphed over the adversities of life on the frontier.\" (Spencer Co.)\n\nFebruary 20\n\nIn 1854, U.S. Senator John Pettit of Indiana delivered a speech in Congress during a debate on allowing slavery in Kansas and Nebraska. Pettit, a Democrat from Lafayette, famously called the Declaration of Independence’s claim that “all men are created equal” a “self-evident lie.” His rhetoric became frequently cited by Abraham Lincoln, and other Republicans, and served as a rallying cry for those critical of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and other federal actions that exacerbated sectional conflicts over slavery.\n\nIn 1895, the Interstate Farmers’ Institute honored writer, speaker, stockbreeder, and Purdue University board member Virginia Claypool Meredith with a medal, inscribed “The citizens of Vicksburg, Mississippi, to the queen of American agriculture.” In 1882, she inherited Oakland Farm in Cambridge City from her father-in-law General Solomon Meredith. She successfully grew the business and her reputation as a farm expert. Meredith encouraged women to pursue education and careers related to farm life. She promoted the advancement of farm women to international audiences through speeches for farmers’ institutes and women’s clubs, and in publications, including the Breeders’ Gazette. (Wayne Co.)\n\nIn 1914, John Chirka and Harry Raisco (also spelled \"Rasica\") became the first prisoners to be executed by electrocution in the State of Indiana. The Rushville Daily Republican noted that Chirka's children \"were made orphans\" that day and \"could not be consoled.\" Juries found both the men guilty of murdering their wives. Despite the petition of many Hoosiers to spare the lives of the prisoners—including signatures from \"numerous kind hearted fathers of the Catholic church—\" Governor Samuel Ralston allowed the execution to proceed at the Michigan City prison. The Daily Republican reported that the governor \"could not close his eyes to the fact that the killing of wives was becoming more and more frequent, and that he should issue a warning that the death penalty would in most cases be carried out.\" It added that the somber executions in Michigan City \"were in marked contrast to the hangings of other days when the sheriff of a county issued invitations to his friends and when these invited guests sold their tickets to the highest bidder.\" (LaPorte Co.)\n\nIn 1925, an explosion at City Coal Mine shook the town of Sullivan and claimed the lives of more than fifty miners. Adjacent towns dispatched rescue squads to Sullivan and National Guard units arrived from Terre Haute. The accident led to the introduction of legislation that improved the working conditions at Indiana mines. (Sullivan Co.)\n\nIn 1940, fire broke out at the paint shop of the Cole Bros. and Robbins Circus in Rochester. The fire destroyed the main structures and killed animals caged in the winter quarters, including tigers, antelopes, and elephants. Hundreds of other animals managed to escape and fled into the city, and startled residents. Citizens assisted police in rounding up the animals. (Fulton Co.)\n\nFebruary 21\n\nIn 1824, David W. Ballard was born in Bridgeport. He studied medicine in the Indiana town before earning his medical degree in Cincinnati. In 1866, President Andrew Johnson appointed Ballard governor of Idaho Territory. A Republican and Union supporter during the Civil War, he encountered conflict as governor among the territory's pro-Confederate Democratic majority during the Reconstruction Era. According to the Idaho Statesman, these legislators “had supported the Confederate cause in the Civil War but had fled the conflict to seek their fortunes in the gold fields of Idaho.\" In response to secessionists’ threats of violence against the territorial governor, he called in troops from Fort Boise. Despite hostility from lawmakers, Idaho’s citizens favored Ballard and unsuccessfully petitioned President Ulysses S. Grant to reappoint him after the expiration"
