        "text": "1866\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton was the first woman to run for the U.S. House of Representatives, even though she was not eligible to vote. She ran as an Independent from New York State, receiving 24 votes of 12,000 that were cast.\n\n1916\n\nJeannette Rankin, a Republican from Montana became the first woman ever elected to Congress.

While she was a suffragist, fully embracing equality of the sexes, she was also an outspoken white supremacist and advocate of segregation who spoke out in favor of lynching.\n\n1925\n\nRepresentative Mae Ella Nolan (R-CA) became the first woman to chair a congressional committee when, during the 68th Congress, she chaired the Committee on Expenditures in the Post Office Department.\n\n1932\n\nHattie Wyatt Caraway (D-AR), appointed in 1931 to fill a vacancy caused by her husband's death, ran for a full term and became the first woman elected to the Senate, where she served two full terms. She was the first woman to chair a Senate committee – the Committee on Enrolled Bills, a minor post.\n\n1948\n\nMargaret Chase Smith (R-ME) became the first woman elected to the Senate without having first been appointed to serve.
