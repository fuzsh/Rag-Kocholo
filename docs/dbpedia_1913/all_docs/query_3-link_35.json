        "text": "- October 31, 2020\n\nLETTER TO ALL YOU OPERATORS BACK IN THE PARK\n\nIn new Q&A, the postmark is Asbury Park, NJ\n\nGiven Bruce Springsteen's barrage of interviews and media appearances in support of Letter to You, our necks are on swivel to make sure we catch them all. We still have a roundup from across the pond to come; in the meantime, here's one we missed last weekend: an interview down the Shore, with the Asbury Park Press's own Chris Jordan.\n\nFor the USA Today Network, Jordan spoke with the Local Hero via Zoom, covering subjects from E Street history to Bruce's recent \"five-year cycle of self-reflection.\" A full transcript appears on APP.com.\n\nJordan considers Letter to You \"an affirmation of life in a time, a very unsettling time, when life seems kind of cheap.\" In response, while stating that he \"didn't set out to comment on\" the times with Letter to You, Bruce takes the opportunity to do so here:\n\nThe recklessness and carelessness that you see from the current administration toward life itself is a disgrace. It's a true disgrace, and it's very insulting to all those who have gotten sick and who have passed away. It's a very sad state of affairs because, really, your job is to comfort those people. Comfort your citizens, comfort your neighbors, comfort your friends. Let them know those who died are irreplaceable. Let them know the nation is weeping for them and that the nation cares about them from the top down. Then do your best to solve the thing as well as you can. But that's been missing. That's a voice that's been missing, and the voice of the value of life is missing from our daily political discourse. So it's been very sad, and I suppose it is something that gets addressed in our record and maybe some folks will find it comforting.\n\nOnce again, Springsteen referenced work on a much-anticipated follow-up to the Tracks box set, noting that he originally recorded Letter to You's version of \"Janey Needs a Shooter\" as a potential Record Store Day release. \"[T]hen when I went behind the board and heard it, I said we can't give this away, this is part of an album. It was the first cut we did for Letter to You, and after that I said maybe there's a few others that would take the same sort of treatment.…\"\n\nRead: \"Bruce Springsteen talks Letter to You, E Street Band and more: The transcript\n\n- October 29, 2020\n\nRECAP: VOLUME 14, \"FAREWELL TO THE THIEF\"\n\n\"Remember, America: this is our moment. Vote.\"\n\nEight years ago, I traveled to Parma, Ohio to watch Bruce Springsteen perform in support of the reelection bid of President Barack Obama [October 18, 2012], on assignment for Backstreets. Though just seven songs long, that remains one of my favorite concert memories of all time. President Clinton \"opened\" for Bruce.\n\nBefore the show, I ran into longtime guitar tech Kevin Buell and front-of-house mixer John Cooper, both of whom wore a look of shock at being recognized, given the event and their out-of-the-public-eye roles in the E Street organization. As Buell went off to do his thing, I told him to toss Bruce the guitar and requested \"Zero and Blind Terry.\"\n\n\"Ha, I'll try,\" Kevin said. \"Just vote, man! Our democracy depends on it.\"\n\nEvery good Boss needs a couple key executives, and damn if Buell wasn't pristinely on message with his boss that day. The message rings just as true today and in this election cycle, if not more so; just over eight years later, Bruce was at it once again in the latest episode of From My Home to Yours.\n\nVolume 14: \"Farewell to the Thief\" was one of the shortest of his DJ sessions so far, at under an hour, put no less powerful for that — and it's remarkable that Bruce had time for his radio show at all, considering all the Letter to You activity. But a compressed set zeroed in on the crucial choice awaiting our Promised Land in the forthcoming election — and on ghosts and goblins, too, but mostly in the form of thematic crossover, Bruce describing this episode as a \"Halloween/Election Day monster mash.\"\n\nThe spooky \"Martian Hop\" opened the show, a one-hit wonder from 1963 and a reminder of Bruce's love for novelty songs, followed by an instrumental interlude of Mike Oldfield's \"Tubular Bells.\" The latter is better known, perhaps, as music from The Exorcist, and sure enough, Springsteen called for \"an exorcism in our nation's capital.\"\n\n\"Hello and welcome, ghouls, fools, witches, blood-sucking politicians, zombie denizens of Washington, DC,\" Bruce intoned, before reaching for one of his favorite political tunes, Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Run Through the Jungle.\" If anyone expected the scares to be more along the lines of \"Purple People Eater,\" Bruce made it apparent that this Halloween, the most frightening thing he can think of would be another four years of the current White House occupants: \"In just a few days we'll be throwing the bums out. I thought it was a fucking nightmare, but it was so true.\"\n\nFollowing \"Everybody Knows\" from Leonard Cohen, Springsteen described the nightmare:\n\nA good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotized — brainwashed by a con man from Queens! You mix in some jingoism, some phony patriotism, \"fear of a black planet,\" vanity, narcissism, paranoia, conspiracy theories, and a portion of our nation undergoing mass delusions and teetering on violence… and you're left with the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.\n\n\"How did he do it?\" Springsteen asked, immediately offering an answer in \"I Put a Spell on You,\" performed by Nina Simone — evoking a similar theme explored on the Magic record, which is of course \"about magic, but it's also about tricks,\" as he introduced the title song in 2007.\n\nA spoken-word interlude revisited the 44th president's speech at this year's Democratic National Convention, as we heard the voice of President Obama: \"We should expect a president to feel a sense of responsibility for the safety and welfare of all 330 million of us — regardless of what we look like, how we worship, who we love, how much money we have — or who we voted for.\"\n\nReferring to his meeting in the Oval Office with President-Elect Trump, Obama continued, \"I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously, that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. But he never did.\"\n\nObama's speech became a prologue to one of Springsteen's own protest songs, as a familiar kick drum provided a superb transition into \"Death to My Hometown.\" The Wrecking Ball recording beautifully blends the anger Bruce felt following the 2007-2009 recession with the redemptive qualities his lyrics and music jointly provide.\n\nAn instrumental interlude by George Mann, Julius Margolin & Friends provided this episode its title — \"Farewell to the Thief!\" — and the absurdity of its kazoo paired well with the bipartisanship Springsteen offered. \"And now a short message from the opposition!\" set up Bryson Gray's \"Trump is Your President,\" which includes such couplets as \"'Cause you know this Trump Train don't stop (Choo, Choo) / Tell Beto to please come try to take my Glock (try).\" Still, it's catchy; and it made way for a more on-the-nose response to the Trump Train as it transitioned directly into Jay Z's \"My President is Black.\"\n\n\"As far as I can gather, this next song sums up the administration's response to combating the coronavirus,\" Bruce said with no further explanation, and even though there are no words to the Legendary Shack Shakers song, the title said it all: \"Thin the Herd.\" Another track whose title was the message: James Brown's \"Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved.\" Bruce set up \"Liar, Liar\" by the Castaways: \"During his four years in office, the man who is supposed to be the best of us has told more than 20,000 lies.\"\n\nWoody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\" might have flashed you back many Springsteen moments — from the original River Tour, to President Obama's inauguration (with Pete Seeger), to that event eight years ago in Parma, where Bruce performed it after a minute-long chant of \"Vote! Vote! Vote!\" The more things change…\n\nTaking the microphone for his lengthiest monologue of the episode, our DJ lamented the lack of recognizable humanity in the current White House, through the words of Elayne Griffin Baker. Over an instrumental by Stephan Moccio, Springsteen offered up a great portion of her viral Facebook post, published on September 2. Bruce read (and at times paraphrased) with great feeling:\n\nThere is no art in this White House.\n\nThere is no literature. No poetry. No music.\n\nThere are no pets in this White House.\n\nNo loyal man's best friend. No Socks the family cat.\n\nNo kids science fairs.\n\nNo times when this president takes off his\n\nblue suit-red tie uniform and becomes human, except when he puts on his white shirt- khaki\n\npants uniform and hides from the American people to\n\nplay golf.\n\nThere are no images of the first family\n\nenjoying themselves together in a moment\n\nof relaxation.\n\nNo Obamas on the beach in Hawaii\n\nmoments, or Bushes fishing in Kennebunkport, no Reagans on horseback, no Kennedys playing touch football on the Cape.…\n\nWhere did that country go? Where did all\n\nof the fun and joy and expression of love and happiness go? We used to be the country that did the ice bucket challenge and raised millions for charity.\n\nWe used to have a president who calmed and\n\nsoothed the nation instead of dividing it.\n\nAnd a First Lady who planted a garden\n\ninstead of ripping one out.\n\nWe are rudderless and joyless.\n\nWe have lost the cultural aspects of\n\nsociety that make America great.\n\nWe have lost our mojo. Our fun, our happiness.\n\nOur cheering on of others.\n\nThe shared experience of humanity that makes it all worth it.\n\nThe challenges and the triumphs that we shared and celebrated.\n\nThe unique can-do spirit that American\n\nhas always been known for.\n\nWe are lost.\n\nWe have lost so much\n\nIn so short a time.\n\nBruce added a postscript, a singular directive of his own: \"On November third, vote them out.\"\n\n\"Democracy\" was the second Leonard Cohen selection for the day, played before Pete Seeger's \"America the Beautiful\" led into \"The Promised Land.\" This last was another lift from the Parma 2012 rally, and it continues to carry deeper meaning following Bruce's thoughts and these 14 pandemic-era episodes of From My Home to Yours.\n\n\"And that's our show on this Halloween/Election Eve. Remember, America: this is our moment. Vote.\"\n\nPlaylist:\n\nThe Ran-Dells - \"Martian Hop\"\n\nInstrumental Interlude: Mike Oldfield - \"Tubular Bells\"\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival - \"Run Through the Jungle\"\n\nLeonard Cohen - \"Everybody Knows\"\n\nNina Simone - \"I Put a Spell on You\"\n\nBarack Obama - 2020 DNC speech (excerpt)\n\nBruce Springsteen - \"Death to My Hometown\"\n\nInstrumental Interlude: George Mann, Julius Margolin & Friends - \"Farewell to the Thief!\"\n\nBryson Gray - \"Trump Is Your President\"\n\nJay-Z - \"My President is Black (Remix)\"\n\nThe Legendary Shack Shakers - \"Thin the Herd\"\n\nCastaways - \"Liar, Liar\"\n\nJames Brown - \"Get On Up, Get Into It, Get Involved\"\n\nWoody Guthrie - \"This Land Is Your Land\"\n\nInstrumental Interlude: Stephan Moccio - \"Sea Change\"\n\nPoetry reading: Elayne Griffin Baker - Untitled\n\nLeonard Cohen - \"Democracy\"\n\nInstrumental Interlude: Pete Seeger - \"America the Beautiful\"\n\nBruce Springsteen - \"The Promised Land\"\n\n- October 28, 2020 - Brandon Shaw reporting\n\nMAIL SORTING\n\nReview Roundup for Letter to You, the album & the film\n\nIn addition to the Backstreets review of Bruce Springsteen's Letter to You album by Jonathan Pont [here] and the Backstreets review of Thom Zimny's Letter to You film by Caroline Madden [here], there have been plenty of takes written and posted about both the album and the film.\n\nWe decided to round them up and divide them into three basic categories: \"Love Letters\" (very favorable reviews,) \"Form Letters\" (middle-of-the-road,) and \"Hate Mail\" (very unfavorable reviews.) Fortunately — and a little surprisingly, given how many are weighing in — nothing has qualified as \"Hate\" to date. But we'll keep checking the mail.\n\nUpdate: We finally discovered some \"Hate Mail!\"\n\n* below denotes a late add.\n\nLove Letters (album)\n\nAmerican Songwriter - Springsteen's Letter to You pays tribute to lost mates and rock \"n' roll's spirit - By Lynne Margolis\n\n*Asbury Park Press - Bruce Springsteen, E Street Band glorious on life-affirming Letter to You - By Chris Jordan\n\nThe A.V.

Following initial print interviews, Springsteen's been ringing that Letter to You bell in numerous TV shows (at home and abroad), livestreams, radio (both satellite and terrestrial), and, this week, podcasts. Yesterday's hour-long episode 97 of Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend has Max Weinberg's two Bosses comparing notes with lots of laughs. Today brings Bruce to the Broken Record podcast, with hosts Malcolm Gladwell and Rick Rubin.\n\nThat's a lot of firepower for an interview, which virtually guaranteed that the book author and record producer would touch on different aspects of whatever came up. Their podcast, now at 68 episodes, has featured everyone from Nick Lowe to Booker T to Brandi Carlile, so they were ready. The result was among the broader, more revealing discussions with Springsteen in recent years, making this Letter to You whistle-stop a required listen.\n\nIt's an informed hour, not only for the music Springsteen describes and performs, but also for the way he characterizes its deepest influences. In this instance, he places both his Irish and Italian heritage in his work, and how he uses each of their traits, something of a first.\n\nOf course, Letter to You took the lead: Springsteen walked his hosts through its inception and then performed a couple songs on guitar, in keeping with a Broken Record theme (granted, these weren't polished, necessarily rehearsed versions). First \"If I Was the Priest\" (a few good measures, anyway) followed by \"Last Man Standing.\" \"Everything came out of that song,\" Springsteen said of the latter, the first one he wrote for the new LP. \"All the rest… came out of the world that I began to create in that song.\"\n\nA surprise element came in the latter half when the discussion turned toward Nebraska. \"The whole record is about a fallen world,\" said Springsteen, \"that we all have to live in.\" Gladwell sounded particularly jazzed to hear more on the topic, particularly how Springsteen saw it as a transitional record:\n\nI came upon a whole type of writing that really began on The River album with \"The River\" and with a song called \"Stolen Car.\" It was a narrative type of writing, a storytelling type of writing that maybe would go back to Woody Guthrie or talking blues. It was inspired by books and cinema I was interested in at that moment… creating a character that was wider than just the character that came out of New Jersey. That was just a broader American voice I was interested in at that time.\n\nThat led Rubin — ever the producer, eliciting more with short, direct questions — to ask which song Springsteen had composed first for the 1982 album (the title track), followed by a request for Bruce to perform it (he did).\n\nAlso in the back half: fond recollections of Springsteen on Broadway, which, like Nebraska, sprang from a related project — Springsteen's January 2017 performance in the East Room of the White House — that took on a whole new life afterward.\n\nI went and I performed it at the White House, about 90 minutes of the play which I put together in about four hours here in this studio. And at the end of the play, Barack Obama, the president got on stage and he said, \"Hey, I know you did that just for us, but that should be a show.\" And so on the way back from Washington, I was with my manager Jon Landau and my wife Patti, and we said, \"Yeah that should be a show… so will it?\"\n\nListen at brokenrecordpodcast.com or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nBack in tellyvision land, Springsteen returned to The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Monday night for the first time since the Jon Stewart era. His first guest spot with Stewart's successor is Bruce's second U.S. late-night appearance for Letter to You — a thoughtful interview in which Noah focuses on the philosophy behind Springsteen's work in general, rather than the nuts and bolts of the new album.\n\n\"It is truly an honor to have you here,\" Noah begins, \"because you are not just an artist, you are not just a successful artist, but in many ways, people would say that you write the story of America in your music.\" That's a jumping-off point for his line of questioning, about the intent behind Bruce's writing in general and songs like \"American Skin (41 Shots).\"\n\nYou just write what moves you.… I don't operate from a conceptual place first. I operate sort of internally first, and then it becomes outward.… The political aspect in my music is through implication. I try to write good, three-dimensional character studies where I bring lives to life and create breathing, living human beings that you recognize in my music, and then I kind of let the politics speak for itself. Of course some of your own comes through, but I don't consider myself a topical songwriter; I don't consider myself a political songwriter. If anything, at this late age, I would say I'd say I'm a little bit more of a spiritual songwriter, in that that's what's been driving some of my most recent work. That's basically the way I look at my job and what I do.\n\nThey go on to discuss Springsteen's work ethic, his European fanbase (\"our largest audience… two-thirds of our audience — much, much bigger than the United States\"), his thoughts on the upcoming election, and misinterpretations of his songs, \"Born in the U.S.A.\" foremost.\n\nThe key to some of my music is, you need to be able to hold two contradictory ideas in your mind at the same time — which is a bit of the measure of adulthood. You need to be able to deal with the fact that a song can be both prideful and critical. And that idea is very central to a lot of my music. Because that's how I feel! I'm proud of my country — I've had an amazing life and gotten the best out of it through living here — but there's a lot to continue to be critical about. So both of those things are going into my music. It's a bit up to the listener to listen well, if you want to get the whole picture.\n\n\"It's been a wonderful journey for me, going through your body of music, getting ready for this interview,\" Noah says as he wraps up. \"You've got a brand-new fan.\"\n\nWatch the 16-minute Springsteen segment below, or the full episode at cc.com.\n\nBy the Editors - October 27, 2020\n\n- October 26, 2020\n\nFIRESIDE CHAT\n\nA \"Letter to You Day\" call-in convo with Bruce — including talk of Tracks 2 and From My Home to Yours Vol. 14 — and more from E Street Radio\n\nOn Friday night Bruce Springsteen picked up the phone for E Street Radio's live call-in request show The Wild & the Innocent with Jim Rotolo. Bruce wasn't calling in with a request; he just wanted to \"send all my love out to all the folks who've supported us over these years. Me and the E Street Band are so excited about this record. We really feel it's some of our best work in a long, long time and are just glad to be able to get this out to the eyes and the ears and the hearts that are out there.\"\n\n\"We are celebrating Letter to You Day right here on Stone Hill Farm!\" Bruce exulted, stating that he was partying \"by the fire\" at his home with \"my lovely wife, my producer Ron Aniello, and my brother-in-law Sean Scialfa.\"\n\nPatti Scialfa also jumped on the phone quickly to say, \"Hey, everybody!\" and to note, \"We're celebrating Bruce's release outside, socially distanced. We are having a blast!\"\n\n\"With a drink or two,\" added Bruce, eliciting a laugh from Patti.\n\nRotolo asked Springsteen about how quickly Letter to You was made (quickest completion \"ever…ever…amazing,\" Bruce confirmed) and whether he ever thought that he and the E Street Band would be at the point where they could record an entire album with such speed.\n\nNot really…. Three weeks, a month, that was what I used to do with Brendan O'Brien, and I considered that incredibly fast. But this was fast because there were no overdubs or extraneous production. I wanted the sound of the E Street Band very pure. I wanted the instrumentation of the band and nothing else… the guitars, the bass, the drums, two keyboards… and so we just got in the studio and it all just happened. Three hours a song. We were really done in four days, and the fifth day we just kind of listened back and checked out what we had. It was a great, great experience with the band, and it was just a wonderful experience for all of us.\n\nThe conversation then turned to the Letter to You film directed by Thom Zimny.\n\nThat was amazing. I just said, \"Thom, we're gonna go in with the E Street Band. We've never been filmed making an album [from start to finish] before. Come on down and film, and just stay out of the way.\" That was how the entire project began, and Thom ended up turning it into an incredible film that I think is one of the best things we've ever done, and it's just a lovely piece of work.\n\n\"Did you go in,\" asked Rotolo, \"with the intentions of, 'This is going to be a full album?' Or did you just want to get the band together to record some things and see how it goes?\"\n\nWell, you always hope that the songs are good, and you don't know until you hear them [played] back. And I didn't demo anything, because the guys requested that I not. So I just played them the song, and then we played it. I don't hear it until the E Street Band makes that noise, y'know? At first or second take in, I'm the audience; I'm standing there listening to what we got. So it was just kinda very fresh and instantaneous. But you don't know [in advance], and after three or four days it was, \"I think we got it; we got the whole thing!\"\n\nRotolo then asked Springsteen about the older songs on Letter to You, why those particular songs were chosen, and if there were any other older songs considered.\n\nWe were working the year previous on a Tracks 2, so I happened to go through all of the songs that were on the John Hammond demo tape as potential tracks for Tracks 2. And I came across those songs, and I said, \"Wow, these are pretty good. I'd be interested to see what it would sound like now with the band playing these songs\" — which were pre-Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ, never released… an entire album, at least. So it just sort of grew from that.\n\nAlso, I cut \"Janey Needs a Shooter\" as a single piece for what I thought was going to be a Record Store Day release here in the United States, but it ended up sounding so good, I said, \"That sounds like an album cut.\" And so I just held onto it, and then one thing led to another… It was all sorts of happy accidents happening all over the place.\n\n\"I'm sure you're itching as much as everybody else is to get out and play this music live,\" said Jim.\n\nWell, if I had my way, obviously we'd be rehearsing right now and getting ready to play in the new year. But we'll see what happens… Optimistically, I'm hoping 2022 at the best, you know? I just hope that happens, because I would love to come out and play these songs live for our audience.\n\nBruce also confirmed that the next edition of his ongoing From My Home To Yours E Street Radio series will air this Wednesday, October 28. Entitled \"Farewell to the Thief,\" it will be centered around Halloween and the U.S. Presidential Election.\n\nI was trying to figure a way… when the virus hit, I said, \"Well, how can I continue my conversation with my fans? Maybe a radio show, where I get to play my favorite records and sort of accompany everybody through whatever this experience is that we're going through.\" I've had a great time putting the shows together, and I'm glad everybody's enjoyed it.\n\nThe complete on-air conversation between Jim Rotolo and Bruce Springsteen is now available on-demand to all SiriusXM subscribers with access to online listening and/or the SiriusXM app. It also will be replayed on E Street Radio (SiriusXM channel 20):\n\nToday, Sunday 10/25, @ 5pm ET\n\nTomorrow, Monday 10/26, @ 7am ET\n\nTomorrow, Monday 10/26, @ 10am ET\n\nTomorrow, Monday 10/26, @ 6pm ET\n\nSiriusXM also has posted two audio clips from the interview on YouTube:\n\nMore good news from E Street Radio and SiriusXM: This week Live From E Street Nation, with co-hosts Dave Marsh and Jim Rotolo, will return to live broadcasting for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S. It's a perfect time for the show to return, offering fans the opportunity to call in and discuss their thoughts on Letter to You and all things Springsteen. Live From E Street Nation is now scheduled to air on SiriusXM channel 20 on Thursdays, 10am-12pm ET, beginning this Thursday, October 29.\n\nAnd over on SiriusXM Volume, this weekend's edition of Kick Out the Jams with Dave Marsh (which airs on Sundays at 10am ET on SiriusXM channel 106) was devoted entirely to celebrating the heart stoppin', pants droppin', jams kickin', legendary E… STREET… BAND!!! Marsh worked again with Jim Rotolo, his longtime Kick Out the Jams producer/collaborator. They were inspired to create this special edition of the show in the wake of Letter to You's release. Since the album and film place a renewed focus on the band's greatness and importance, Marsh and Rotolo created a two-hour show that dives deeply into the work of the band's members on (and sometimes off) E Street. SiriusXM subscribers can catch an on-demand replay of this special edition of Kick Out the Jams with Dave Marsh and all other recently aired KOTJ shows by listening online or on the SiriusXM app. Just type \"Kick Out the Jams with Dave Marsh\" in the search engine.

A gust of autumn wind blowing down the boardwalk, Letter to You heralds a change of seasons as Springsteen assesses his own life and summons ghosts, backed this time by the power of the E Street Band.\n\nLetter to You follows the thread of the past four years, marked by a best-selling autobiography and its stage companion, Springsteen on Broadway. It recalls The Who By Numbers, which Pete Townshend composed in frustration at the cusp of 30, a response he characterized as an inability to write new music for The Who. Both back-to-basics and introspective, it remains one of Townshend's most deeply moving records.\n\nNearing 70, Springsteen faced a similar problem — writing for the E Street Band — until one day in 2019 when he didn't. Playing a bespoke guitar he'd received as a gift from an Italian fan outside his Broadway show, he moved from room to room in his house, writing and capturing the songs on his iPhone as he went. He skipped the demo-making process, convened the E Street Band, and taught them the songs on the spot. They finished recording most of it in four days.\n\nSpringsteen with the guitar that inspired Letter to You, October 2020 - photograph by Joe DeSalvo\n\nIn nearly every respect, the new LP stands in contrast to his last one, Western Stars, which, with its labyrinthine recording history, lush arrangements, and decidedly produced feel, spent years on the shelf. Though it took the scenic route, Western Stars looked carefully at archetypes of the American Male in suspense. Letter to You takes the measure of a more balanced life — more conventional, too, but closer to realizing potential.\n\nIts cover image shows Springsteen in Central Park, evoking a Lion in Winter look. And there's no getting around the fact that Letter to You grapples with aging and mortality, topics that have come up in earlier songs like \"Kingdom of Days,\" \"Western Stars,\" \"The Rising,\" and even \"Valentine's Day.\"\n\nGone is the comparatively whimsical, upbeat \"Cadillac Ranch.\" Now, Springsteen writes about the end of life in a far more nuanced tone, and the subject frames an entire album, from the \"big black train coming down the track\" in the opening line to the titular declaration of \"I'll See You in My Dreams\" at the end. In between, the music often rages against the dying of the light. But if Letter to You is a resistance record, it's rooted in the affirmative: we are alive. For now.…\n\nContinue reading\n\nTHE LIGHT ON YONDER MOUNTAIN:\n\nThe Backstreets Review of Letter to You\n\n- October 23, 2020 - Jonathan Pont reporting\n\nThom Zimny and Bruce Springsteen, November 2019 - photograph by Rob DeMartin\n\nINSIDE THE HOUSE OF A THOUSAND GUITARS\n\nThe Letter to You Backstreets Interview with Thom Zimny\n\nBruce Springsteen needs a shooter — and so Thom Zimny's list of credits as a filmmaker gets longer all the time.\n\nFollowing initial work as an editor on Live in New York City, Zimny has gone on to helm film projects of all kinds for Springsteen, from music videos to full concerts, both new and archival. Trained as a documentarian, Zimny also maintains the film archive for Thrill Hill; he puts it to good use as the go-to guy for anything in Bossworld that requires a moving image — that is, when he's not working with Bruce on something entirely new, like short films for \"Hunter of Invisible Game\" and \"A Night With the Jersey Devil.\" And though Thom has expanded his purview in recent years, directing acclaimed documentaries on Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash, his 20-year relationship with Springsteen remains at the center of his life's work.\n\nZimny has directed seven feature-length Springsteen documentary films, utilizing both new and archival footage: Wings For Wheels: The Making of Born to Run (2005), The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town (2010), Darkness on the Edge of Town, Paramount Theatre, Asbury Park (2010), The Ties That Bind (2015), Springsteen on Broadway (2018), Western Stars (2019), and now the new album companion film Letter to You (2020).\n\nThe last of these, an Apple Original (given a surprise early release today), documents Springsteen's 2019 recording session with the E Street Band, a whirlwind affair that resulted in a new album in just five days (or four days, plus one to listen, as the story goes).\n\nLike Western Stars, which Springsteen co-directed, the Letter to You film incorporates new commentary from Bruce, whose voiceover gives context to the songs, extends their themes, and once again turns musical performance into something even more expansive — a \"tone poem,\" in Bruce's parlance. Zimny's vision creates beauty out of the combined elements in the edit. But the foundation of the project alone — going inside the studio, to watch the E Street Band make new music — is enough to capture any fan's attention.\n\nZimny spoke with Backstreets editor Christopher Phillips shortly before the film's release, to explore the process from its initial spark — sitting around a fire with the Boss, the Beatles on the radio — to the final toast.\n\nCP: The big question everybody gets asked is, what have you been doing with yourself during lockdown? \"What did you do during the pandemic?\" So I'm wondering: was Letter to You your pandemic project?\n\nTZ: This was the pandemic project. Gratefully, we had finished filming. I had organized the footage and started to \"sketch\" a little bit, and then this thing arrived that shut us down completely — shut us down in the sense of a film production office. So I cut the movie at home, using FaceTime with Bruce. He would send me ideas by phone, and we made the movie back-and-forth that way.\n\nSo much of the creation of Western Stars involved you and Bruce working in the same space, running from one edit bay to the other; did Zoom or FaceTime help enable that, or were you more on your own for this one?\n\nThis was definitely different than the collaboration on Western Stars. I was on my own directing it more, in the sense that we couldn't be in the studio, but I did keep that dialogue very close. We were talking every day, we were texting, he was sending ideas for voiceovers, I was sending him things a ton as I started to sketch.… and really, the collaboration was strong on this.\n\nOf all the Bruce movies you've put together, you've really never made the same one twice. Letter to You is centered around songs, but it's not a concert film; it has elements of Western Stars, but it's also showing us something that hasn't happened in decades. You couldn't have made this movie before.\n\nRight. Bruce's work has been a huge influence on me, in the area of editing and also the idea of never repeating yourself. Never repeating yourself is an important mantra to me as a filmmaker.\n\nWith Letter to You I had the opportunity to try to revisit an idea that I started to chase when I was a kid, which is: What happens in the studio with the E Street Band? You know, at 16, flipping over the sleeve of The River and seeing a photograph of Jon [Landau] and Bruce at the board — that was the start of wondering about their creative process, about how it must feel to be in the room when one of these songs is created. So I took the opportunity, after 20 years of working with Bruce, to let that 16-year-old come back to the room.\n\nI was able to capture a dream come true: to be in the room when he's demoing the band tracks, working with the full band. I'm looking across the studio, and I'm seeing gestures that reflect the archival footage I've spent so much time with — like, archival footage of Jon and Bruce together in 1978 — and I'm looking at the footage now and getting in the moment and I see these same guys.\n\nThere is a beauty in those details, of Jon and Bruce working together, being behind the board, the E Street Band talking…. These are relationships that are so powerful and strong, and you can see that secret silent language of gesture and expression that really conveys their creative process. When they start scribbling on notepads, a few letters and chords, and they have a 30-second discussion about a song they've never heard before and then sit down and this energy explodes.… the camera took it all in. So as a filmmaker, this was a completely different experience, a completely new film.…\n\nContinue reading\n\nINSIDE THE HOUSE OF A THOUSAND GUITARS:\n\nThe Letter to You Backstreets Interview with Thom Zimny\n\n- October 22, 2020 - Christopher Phillips reporting\n\nSPRINGSTEENWHILE...\n\nA Late Show with Stephen Colbert devoted about half of its October 21 episode to a remote chat with Bruce Springsteen, who spoke from his home studio in Colts Neck, NJ. As one would expect from an encounter with Colbert, the conversation was a mix of giggles and gravity, with Bruce enthusiastically engaged throughout.\n\nEarly on, Colbert asked of Springsteen, \"How does it feel to have an album and know you can't take it on the road right now?\" Before admitting that it \"actually is a bit of a drag,\" Bruce joked, \"Well, I do a lot of work in front of my bedroom mirror with the tennis racket. I've completely gone back to when I was 16. I put the album on, I get the tennis racket, and I go for an hour. Matter of fact, I go for three hours, just like the show.\"\n\nColbert and Springsteen then discussed how the passing of George Theiss, Bruce's Castiles bandmate, led to the creation of much of the material on Letter to You. Shortly after Theiss' death, said Bruce, \"I started to write with the themes of mortality, and lifespan, and music… what it's like being in a band when you're young, what it's like being in a band 50 years later with the same people… It just opened a vein of creativity that lasted for about seven days, in which I wrote almost all of the songs for the album, and that's the way it happens sometimes.\"\n\nAfter talking a bit about Bob Dylan's influence on the older material recorded for Letter to You, Colbert threw Springsteen a bit of a curve: \"Last time we were together,\" said Colbert, \"I asked you to name the Top Five Bruce Springsteen songs According to Bruce Springsteen. Gimme your Top Three Dylan Songs.\"\n\n\"That's really hard.\" Bruce replied. \"You've gotta put 'Like a Rolling Stone' in there, just because it's a history/culture-changing piece of music, and it's also simply a fantastic rock 'n' roll song. 'Visions of Johanna' is a big song for me, but I also like 'Ring Them Bells'… I like all of John Wesley Harding, so it's hard to pick one.\"\n\n\"How about a single line?\" asked Colbert. \"What's the first Dylan line that jumps out to you?\"\n\nBruce picked the opening lines of \"Like a Rolling Stone:\" \"Once upon a time you dressed so fine; you threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?\" (which he slightly misquoted.) \"You were hooked. You were into that story so intensely and so quickly. That's the one that immediately comes to my mind.\" (Colbert's pick: \"My weariness amazes me; I'm branded on my feet.\" from \"Mr. Tambourine Man.\")\n\nColbert noted that Max Weinberg has urged people to listen to Letter to You straight through in its entirety, which led to some discussion on listening to complete albums. Colbert asked Springsteen, \"Do you listen to a lot of albums all the way through these days?\"\n\n\"I listen to some,\" said Bruce. \"I listened to Lana Del Rey's Norman Fucking Rockwell! album all the way through.\" To which Colbert immediately replied, \"Oh my God! How about the song 'The Greatest?!' Can we talk about the song 'The Greatest?!'\"\n\nBruce laughed and replied, \"I just love her writing, you know? It's cinematic, and her narrative's great. But the last record I actually listened to all the way through… It was the 45th anniversary of Born to Run, and so I got with a buddy of mine. It was, like, Sunday morning at 11am. I said, 'Come on, we're gonna jump in the car. We're gonna play it from top to bottom, just for the 45th anniversary.'\n\n\"So we got in the car,\" Bruce continued, \"and we started driving south a little bit, and the album's running itself down. We get to Asbury Park, I turn and I come up Kingsley Avenue just as 'Born to Run' hits. Down past the Stone Pony, past Convention Hall, into Deal, into West Long Branch, to 7½ West End Court. Just as the intro to 'Jungleland' hits, I'm parked in front of the house where I wrote all of the songs from Born to Run. That was fun.\n\n\"So I think it's fun listening to records all the way through, just because they're always more than the sum of their parts, and it's a greater story to tell. And yeah, I would suggest people listen to this one all the way through, too, because you'll have a bigger experience.\"\n\nAfter a commercial break, Colbert and Springsteen ruminated a bit on the 2020 loss of an artist they both love: the late, great John Prine. Then on a much lighter note, Colbert congratulated Bruce on reaching his latest \"tremendous milestone:\" his own emoji.\n\nFinally, before concluding the interview, Colbert asked Bruce if he could pick up one of the many guitars behind him and \"play us off with something.\" We got a bit of an acoustic \"Last Man Standing\" before Bruce cracked himself up — shortly after singing the \"Cuban heels on your boots\" line, he admitted, \"I forget the rest!\"\n\nYou can watch the complete episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert with guests Bruce Springsteen and Eva Longoria on CBS.com.

A segment will air on Morning Edition tomorrow, but for a longer listen, NPR has posted Steve Inskeep's interview with the Boss online today.\n\nIn \"What Bruce Springsteen Lost and Found,\" along with delving into all things LTY and the \"spiritual dimension\" of his work, Bruce recalls a night at the opera:\n\nI got to know Luciano Pavarotti a little bit before he died. I went to his apartment one night and he made me and my wife spaghetti. And so we're sitting and eating and he invites me to the opera. So I go to the opera, which I've never been to in my life, and I watch him perform. And after the opera, we're out having a drink and he says, \"What do you think, Bruce? What did you really think of the opera?\" I said, \"Well, it was incredible.\" You know, there's no mic; he came out, his voice was, to me, still in fantastic shape. And he says, \"Well, yes, but the popular singer has it over the opera singer.\" I said, \"Really? Why is that?\" \"The popular singer sings the way people speak.\"\n\nI thought about Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, and I thought: Yeah, that's true; they sing colloquially, the way people speak to one another. That had been what I'd been pursuing in my own songs for quite a few years at that point, but he made it all make sense to me.\n\nRead the feature here for Inskeep's introduction, reflecting on Springsteen's \"openness\" as well as the Letter to You album and film, and you can listen to their interview above.\n\n- October 22, 2020\n\nA WINTER'S TALE\n\nThom Zimny captures the making of Springsteen's 20th studio album in Letter to You\n\nReview by Caroline Madden\n\nThe past few years of Bruce Springsteen's career have been very reflective, the now-71-year-old artist looking back at his past to deconstruct his own mythology. Written with introspective candor, his memoir Born to Run delved into his personal demons, childhood memories, and the personal and social events that inspired his songwriting. For the stellar Springsteen on Broadway, Bruce used sharp humor and poetic monologues to dissect the American iconography of his music, such as blue-collar work, cars, and the open road. In Western Stars, he slipped into his cowboy boots to scrutinize the enduring themes of his canon: the tension between rugged individualism and the need to be a part of a community, the lonely, wayward traveler journeying across the expanse of America in search of inner peace and freedom.\n\nLetter to You, a companion film to the album released the same day, is part of this retrospective wave, weighed more heavily by Bruce's awareness of his waning mortality. The \"light from the oncoming train,\" as he has phrased it, illuminates his past, present, and future, and he wields the artistic mediums of song and screen to make sense of his life and ours.\n\nHelmed once again by director Thom Zimny, the 90-minute Letter to You is part behind-the-scenes documentary and part visual album. It follows a similar structure to Western Stars, with Bruce's weathered voice introducing each song performance in the form of a poignant voiceover monologue. This time, the film doesn't present the songs in album order, and two of the 12 songs are omitted, to weave a particular story that honors the \"45 year conversation\" he has had with his bandmates and fans, one that will continue \"'til we're all in the box.\"\n\nInstead of the pale, arid desert landscapes of Western Stars, we angelically glide over the frozen New Jersey woodlands. This evocative drone photography, shot in austere black and white, is reminiscent of the old pictures of The Castiles (\"1965 to 1968, three years,\" he says, \"an eternity in the '60s,\") that haunt Springsteen. These hushed snowscapes have a reverent quality that plays both with and against the tone of the Letter to You album. Accompanied by his elegiac compositional score (credited to Springsteen with producer Ron Aniello, and deserving of its own album release), Bruce's image is often superimposed over these wintry vistas, lending him an aura of divine wisdom.\n\nAs a third component, joining the wintry scenes outside and the interior warmth of the studio, Zimny once again selects unseen archival footage to place you in the era of Springsteen's formative years. Small clips of everyday lives from the past, as well as performance and other footage of young Bruce and the E Streeters, have a spectral and wistful beauty that fits the album's recurring theme of \"ghosts.\"\n\nAs Bruce explains before \"Last Man Standing,\" the songs on Letter to You were inspired by the death of his former Castiles bandmate George Theiss. As \"the last living member of the mighty Castiles,\" Springsteen ruminated on his musical roots and was struck by \"the debt that I still owed my Freehold brothers in arms.\" Letter to You, he says in voiceover, was his way of thanking the friends, bandmates, and fellow students in his \"first and greatest school of rock,\" such as Diana and George Theiss, Bart Haynes, Frank Marziotti, Curt Fluhr, Vinnie Manniello, Paul Popkin, Bob Alfano. With his modern-day E Street Band, Bruce also travels back to the past to re-record and flesh out a few early songs that got away, including what had been acoustic John Hammond demos. Amusingly, they are the only songs that he needs glasses to read, due to their florid, Bob Dylan-esque lyrics.\n\nIn between Springsteen's eloquent introductions, we have the electrifying heart of the matter: Springsteen and the E Street Band creating a new album in a matter of days, right before the camera's eye. Zimny gives us a multi-angle view of the studio, capturing the band in all of their creative glory as they trade ideas, laugh, and play with a precision and passion that sizzle like dynamite. There are even a few humorous moments where we get to see why Bruce is dubbed the Boss.\n\nAlthough we have seen documentaries of their recording process before, the studio footage in Letter to You feels different as it shows the band's return to recording full takes together for the first time since 1984. It is gratifying to witness this near-flawless, \"finely tuned instrument of flexibility and power\" in their element, with decades of collaboration and friendship behind them. Zimny nimbly captures the buzzing energy in the room that can only come from such a long-lasting partnership.\n\nThe rousing \"Ghosts\" celebrates the \"beauty and joy of being in a band and the pain of losing one another,\" Bruce says. Without the E Street Band, Bruce could never have brought his music to life in the same way, and we get to witness them doing just that: as Springsteen has recently discussed in interviews, this time he eschewed recorded demos to play the band his new compositions on acoustic guitar, allowing them to create their own parts in the moment.\n\n\"All of us together are greater than the sum of our individual parts… While in our band, the songs and individual vision are mine, the physical creation of that vision into a real world present belongs to all of us,\" Springsteen declares.\n\nDuring their impassioned performances, Zimny gracefully pairs vintage footage of Bruce and the band against their current-day selves. When their young faces blend into the old, the film inspires a nostalgia for what once was and a deep gratitude for what continues to be. How lucky we are to have seen this band endure for so many years. How lucky we are that they have given us a lifetime of music, memories, and happiness.\n\nMusic fills the pulpit of Springsteen's life. It is his own form of prayer, as he reveals in his introduction to \"The Power of Prayer\": \"I restricted my prayers to three minutes and a 45 RPM record. The power of pure pop, the beautiful simplicity of melody, a complete character study in a matter of minutes. Life in 180 seconds or less. If you get it right, it has the power of prayer.\"\n\nWe witness the transformative power of music during a moving scene in which the band listens to a playback of album-closer \"I'll See You in My Dreams,\" a mournful elegy to Bruce's dearly departed friends, inspired by his own nightly visions of Clarence, Danny, and others. Zimny concentrates on Jon Landau holding back tears, rapt in the tenderness of Bruce's lyrics.\n\nDeath has always preoccupied Bruce, it seems, and beneath the haunting image of rolling clouds, he recalls the terror and wonder of the funerals he attended as a child and his nightly recitation of \"Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep.\" His Catholic upbringing \"impressed upon my young mind that someday we will close our eyes and the grey evening sky will unfold above us. Bringing that long and endless sleep.\"\n\nWinter may symbolize death, but Letter to You, despite its frosty landscapes and monochromatic visuals, is not a gloomy experience, ending on a galvanizing note with the smoldering \"Burnin' Train.\"\n\nSpringsteen burns, too, with an artistic flame that, like Moses' burning bush, never wanes. \"After all this time, I still feel that burning need to communicate. It's there when I wake every morning. It walks alongside of me throughout the day. And it's there when I go to sleep each night. Over the past 50 years, it's never once ceased…. As reliable as the rhythmic beating of my own heart is my need to talk to you,\" he affirms. It is this intense need, along with the comradery and collaborative artistry on display, that makes the film feel so warm, despite its at-times melancholy subject matter and stark style.\n\nAt the end of the film, Springsteen leaves us with a benediction to appreciate the time we have here on earth; he encourages us to treat our loved ones with grace and bask in the beauty of the world around us. Letter to You is a touching time capsule of a band with a deep, unique kinship that can only be forged over time, and a meditative portrait of an artist from humble beginnings, blessed with an observant and empathetic eye, who became not just a rock star but a great philosopher of our times. This heartfelt documentary proves once again that Zimny and Springsteen make excellent collaborators. Bruce has sent us a letter, and its message is clear: when we shake off our mortal cage, our spirits will live on, swirling around in the ether alongside the musical notes that have filled our ears and our souls.\n\nThe Letter to You film premieres October 23 via AppleTV, the same day as Bruce Springsteen's latest studio album of the same name.

Joining for the kick-off is longtime music industry executive Clive Davis — who headed Columbia Records when Springsteen signed to the label in 1972 — and Springsteen's manager Jon Landau.\n\nThe other four lead up to Friday's release of Springsteen's new Columbia Records LP, Letter to You. And the topics vary by day:\n\nTuesday finds Springsteen talking with Eddie Vedder and Dave Grohl about success\n\nWednesday features a discussion with The Killers' Brandon Flowers about the influence of Bruce's music on younger bands\n\nThursday, Jon Stewart will talk with Springsteen about the intersection of music and politics\n\nFriday, the coolest DJ in the land Little Steven Van Zandt will join to celebrate the release of the new LP.\n\nThe episodes will air at 4pm ET on both SiriusXM and Apple Music Hits; additionally, episodes will become available on Apple Music on demand; we're not yet aware of similar availability for later playback on SiriusXM; it's worth noting that the service hosts all 13 episodes of From My Home to Yours, so there's a good chance that this week's programming will remain online that way, too.\n\nSiriusXM will play each episode a second time at 7pm ET and reprise the programming in its entirety next week.\n\nMore Apple Bobbing\n\nIf it's old-school programming you seek, \"Springsteen Week\" has Apple users covered there, too: Apple Music TV launched today, and it's a lot like MTV was in 1981 — before it had even aired the live clip of \"Rosalita\" from Phoenix in 1978! In other words, it's going to focus on music video as we once knew it.\n\nThat'll come in handy on Thursday, when the channel features a day-long event, with special programming that will include Springsteen videos and interviews. Read this Ars Technica story for more details.\n\nAs for Thursday night's NMD Presents special, Apple Music TV chief Rachel Newman confirms that it will air on the new channel, and she spoke with Variety today about what to expect:\n\n…a fan-only event… broadcast on Apple Music as well as the music video channel — at [11 p.m. ET], just ahead of the album being launched, there's a live event for a thousand superfans who are part of a closed-off virtual environment where they can communicate with Bruce and ask questions; Zane Lowe presents this and they talk about the album and play back it back. We're with the artist as the album is released, so that's quite special.\n\nWe can't recall a time when Springsteen participated to such a degree ahead of any record, without a morning show visiting Asbury Park; at least this time, he can sleep in.\n\n- By the Editors - October 19, 2020\n\nWATCH NOW: ZANE LOWE INTERVIEWS SPRINGSTEEN\n\nThis afternoon, Apple Music has released Bruce Springsteen: The Letter to You Interview, a video Q&A with Zane Lowe (who will also be co-hosting the NMD special with Bruce on Thursday night).\n\nFilmed in his home studio, Springsteen connects with Lowe via Zoom for this hour-long interview, speaking about the album from its recording process down to the individual songs, as well as ruminating on the E Street Band, current events, and more.\n\nIf you have iTunes, you can fire it up via Apple Music, or watch the full hour via YouTube, below.\n\n- October 19, 2020\n\nBURNING DOWN THE HOUSE: NEW NYTIMES Q&A\n\nAs we enter Letter to You week, the New York Times kicked things off with a new Springsteen interview on Sunday, courtesy of music critic and former Ringer writer Lindsay Zoladz.\n\nBruce directly sums up what, to him, the new album is about: \"The record is the first record that I've made where the subject is the music itself.… It's about popular music. It's about being in a rock band, over the course of time. And it's also a direct conversation between me and my fans, at a level that I think they've come to expect over the years.\"\n\nZoladz notes that Springsteen has \"made a record and a film that are in some ways both about the primacy of playing live music at a time when we can’t really experience that\"; Bruce looks ahead to a day when we can:\n\nI think there's going to be a process before people are comfortable rubbing up against one another again. But if somebody told me, \"That’s never going to happen again\" — that would be a big life change for me. That act of playing has been one of the only consistent things in my life since I was 16 years old. I've depended a lot on it not just for my livelihood, but for my emotional well-being. So if somebody said, \"Five years from now, maybe\" — that's a long time. Particularly at my age. I'm 71, and I'm thinking, \"Well I know one thing. I'm in the mood right now to burn the house down for as long as I can.\"\n\nRead: \"Bruce Springsteen Is Living in the Moment\"\n\n- October 19, 2020\n\nTRAMPS LIKE US CELEBRATES BTR45 WITH DRIVE-IN CONCERT & MOVIE\n\nNext weekend on Long Island, the day after the Letter to You release, Springsteen tribute band Tramps Like Us will celebrate the 45th anniversary of another first-class E Street delivery: 1975's Born to Run.

A quarter-century after the \"October Assault,\" Ken Rosen looks back with the head Houserocker at this first Bruce & Joe collaboration\n\nI was gearing up to ask Joe Grushecky about the missing credits for \"Comin' Down Maria\" and \"Talk Show\" on his American Babylon album, easing into it by asking about the one credited contributor:\n\nHow did Patti [Scialfa]'s contribution come about for \"Comin' Down Maria\"?\n\nI just had that song. It was just Bruce and I recording it. And one of us (probably me) said, \"Hey Patti, want to sit in on this?\" So she came over.\n\nOh well, I thought, that was disappointingly straightforward. But then Joe continued, and he beat me to the punch:\n\n\"Comin' Down Maria\" and \"Talk Show\" are both just me and Bruce. We're the only guys playing instruments on those. If there's drum sets, it's probably electronic drums somehow that we did, plus Patti singing on \"Comin' Down Maria.\" The rest of the stuff is just he and I.\n\nWait. I did not know that. I'm not sure anybody knows that, actually.\n\nWell… I don't think at that point… [laughs sheepishly] We didn't actually want to say how much he had done on the record, because he's pretty much all over it. He's on every track except \"No Strings Attached\" and \"American Babylon.\" On every other song he is playing or singing or something.\n\nHuh. So, he's on \"Talk Show\"?\n\nYeah, that's all him.\n\nWow. I did not know that.\n\nWell, nobody does. I'm spilling the beans. You're the first guy to know.\n\nThat was a genuine surprise, although in retrospect it shouldn't have been. Bruce is all over American Babylon, so why wouldn't we all have at least suspected that he was on these two tracks also — especially since his wife sings on one of them?\n\nThe revelation that two officially released tracks with prominent Springsteen contributions have been hiding in plain sight for a quarter-century may have been the biggest reveal of our 75-minute long conversation, but it was far from the only one.\n\nWhen Joe and I spoke a few months ago as part of his virtual publicity tour for the 40th anniversary of Have a Good Time But Get Out Alive, I mentioned to him that American Babylon has a milestone anniversary this year, too.\n\nThat album is one of my favorites — by anybody — of the 1990s. I had just moved from Philadelphia to Portland, I was completely turned off by the grunge movement, and I felt like rock was evolving into something I couldn't find an affinity for. Then came American Babylon, recommended to me by a record store advisor who I never had the chance to properly thank, and I felt my faith restored: someone was still making great East Coast rock 'n' roll, and I played the heck out of that album over the years. (I'm on my third copy, and trust me: American Babylon is not an easy album to find.)\n\nI told Joe I'd love to do a deep-dive with him on American Babylon, and he immediately agreed. Although the anniversary was still a few months away, we took advantage of the steamy dog days of this quarantine summer to take a look back at the making and meaning of Joe's Bruce-produced milestone album.\n\nIn a wide-ranging conversation, Joe shared the origins of American Babylon and his working relationship with Bruce; the backstories for several of the album's strongest tracks (including \"Homestead\" and \"Dark and Bloody Ground,\" co-written with Springsteen); how Joe almost got fired from his day job for having the audacity to record with Bruce; what's next for Joe; and enough record-correcting session detail to require some serious Brucebase revisions.\n\nOur conversation was so rich with color, detail, and stories that I couldn't bring myself to edit it down.\n\nSo please join us over on my blog, E Street Shuffle, to read our entire conversation, and my thanks to Backstreets for allowing me to share it with you.\n\n- October 17, 2020 - Ken Rosen reporting\n\nNEW MUSIC DAILY PRESENTS: SPRINGSTEEN LIVE ON LTY EVE\n\nApple Music has announced a live Letter to You event for Release Eve: on Thursday night, October 22, Bruce Springsteen and Zane Lowe will cohost the NMD Presents Bruce Springsteen event, with the Boss appearing live from New Jersey to answer fan questions and play clips from the Letter to You film.\n\nTicket registration is open to Apple Music subscribers.

Titled \"The Ties That Bind,\" the 13-page page cover story features highlights from interviews with most of the E Street Band and Springsteen's manager Jon Landau.\n\nIt's a turn from the initial instances of Letter to You press coverage. Current profiles in Rolling Stone and AARP centered on question-and-answer sessions with Springsteen himself, and lengthy biographical recaps; if he spoke to Uncut writer Peter Watts for this story, it was on background.\n\nLetting E Street Band members recount the live experience for Letter to You brings the focus to the music. That perspective forms a major part of the story Watts tells: Max Weinberg, for example, sketched the band's physical placement inside Springsteen's Stone Hill Studio: \"We are very close together,\" Weinberg said of the recording set-up, \"which is unlike a concert where we are all spread out.\" With Springsteen and Van Zandt on either side of him and his drum kit, Weinberg likens their trading ideas mid-song to \"watching the tennis match.\"\n\nWhile technical details fill in the picture, Steve Van Zandt talked about the writing process for Letter to You, nearly all of which the E Street Band laid down at Springsteen's New Jersey's home studio over a four-day stretch last November. \"With this one, before he even started writing,\" Van Zandt said, Springsteen \"was after a real band record. It's a different way of writing, a different subject matter and a different size of song. Those factors all need to be in place before he starts writing.\"\n\nNils Lofgren— the self-described \"new guy\" in the E Street Band, coming up on 37 years — underscored how song structures allowed the band to improvise. \"You aren't just trying to place your part on a great track, you are all there together,\" Lofgren told Watts. \"It's interactive and you have to focus and adapt to what the others are doing. That's the standard freedom we get.\"\n\nRecording live in the studio with the E Street Band was both a first for Lofgren and a return to the ways in which it'd backed Springsteen for The River and Born in the U.S.A.: mostly live, with few overdubs. And in this case, no demos to emulate.\n\nRelying solely on placeholder versions captured on his iPhone, Springsteen taught the band each song in turn by playing it on acoustic guitar. Beginning with the Castiles-inspired elegy \"Last Man Standing,\" they made notes on chord changes and arrangements, then hit record, \"making further alterations,\" Watts writes, \"until they got it right\" — resulting in no more than a half-dozen takes for any given song. Credit for this back-to-basics approach belongs with Roy Bittan, who suggested it to Springsteen over lunch soon after the new songs materialized (\"because when you demo,\" Bittan told Watts, \"it's carved in stone\").\n\nThe second part of the Uncut package features a breezy review of Letter to You (written by Richard Williams), which, like the first part, offers insight and detail about songs' lyrical and musical components: \"One Minute You're Here\" starts with a \"downbeat Springsteen alone with acoustic guitar,\" Watts writes; Williams describes the trio of older compositions Springsteen revived for the projects as \"homages to the sound of Bob Dylan circa 1965. The triumphant wild mercury swirl of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper is lovingly re-created, while the particular virtue of each song is brought to the fore… dialled down to suit today's sensibility.\"\n\n\"The Ties That Bind\" is the cover story of the December 2020 issue of Uncut Magazine, on U.K. newsstands now and available digitally or in print via uncut.co.uk.\n\n- By the Editors, October 15, 2020\n\nBBC RADIO 2 INTERVIEW IN THE MIDNIGHT HOUR\n\nAnother promo appearance is on the books for Letter to You release day: late Friday night October 23, after his appearance on The Graham Norton Show, Bruce Springsteen will guest with BBC Radio 2 host Dermot O'Leary for a program called From My Home to His: Dermot Meets Bruce Springsteen.\n\n\"Dermot O'Leary, at home in London, links up with his hero Bruce Springsteen, on his farm in New Jersey, to chat about his new album Letter to You - plus some classic tracks picked by Dermot.\" Premieres Saturday, October 24 at 00:00.\n\n- October 13, 2020\n\nBACKSTREETS PRE-ORDERING IS ON NOW FOR LETTER TO YOU\n\nEach copy comes with an exclusive bonus FREE… and it's pretty Sharp!\n\nThanks to everyone patiently waiting for our pre-order offer to be ready... it took some time to devise, design, and create our special exclusive, but approval has come down from the top and we're taking pre-orders now!\n\nEvery copy of Letter to You we ship, on compact disc or vinyl 2LP, will be accompanied by a special promotional item you'll find nowhere else — an official Letter to You pen-and-notecard set, FREE!

It's September 30, 1978, and they'd been on the road behind Springsteen's much-awaited fourth album since the end of May. This date was a make-up for a July postponement (due to illness), a situation Bruce apologizes for repeatedly throughout the evening, and promises to make up for.\n\nNeither he nor the audience should have been concerned about their ability to make good on that: while the July E Street Band was already on its A-game, another two months under its belt shows on every possible front — and in good time, because this concert was broadcast regionally around the Southeastern United States.\n\nToday, September 30, 1978 joins Springsteen's Live Archive series to make the Darkness broadcast quintet complete: all five (along with the Roxy, Agora, Passaic, and Winterland) are now official releases in the Springsteen live catalog, with the sonic improvements to match.\n\nNone needed an upgrade more than Atlanta. As the story goes, storms in the region wreaked havoc with the airwaves, and a perfect tape has never surfaced. Plangent Processed and freshly mixed from the pre-FM 24-track multis, today's release should finally do the show justice.\n\nIn a tour brimming with exceptional shows, '78 tends to be dominated by the Roxy and the Agora, broadcasts heard in real time that you could get a copy of without finding and paying for a bootleg. But Atlanta is no consolation prize: it's a show that is dialed-in from a performance standpoint. Every song is executed near-perfectly, and still abundant with electricity and verve.\n\nThe intro to \"Spirit in the Night\" is one such moment, with not a note out of place, and it thrusts Bruce into a swirl of cosmic magic. \"Spirit\" is also the moment where the other star of this Atlanta show, the audience, takes its place. You can feel the collective reaction with the first notes; they know what song it is. They hit the \"all night!\" like they'd been singing it for decades, the women in the audience make their presence known when Bruce starts crawling into Greasy Lake, and everyone yells \"goodbye\" on cue. \"You guys are nuts out there. It's incredible,\" Bruce says once the song finishes.\n\nSpringsteen recounts a 1975 Atlanta show at the Electric Ballroom, where someone in the audience mistook him for Steve: \"I said, 'No, no, I'm Bruce! That's Steve!' That was funny.\" There would be no case of mistaken identity tonight; in fact, Atlanta is one of those shows where the audience yells song requests during every interlude. Bruce acknowledged them before \"Independence Day,\" which followed an exquisite \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\": listen for the interplay between the verses and the choruses. \"The Promised Land\" features another audience response on cue, yelling blow away loud enough to make it onto the broadcast; listening at home, you'll probably be moved enough to be yelling it along with them.\n\nAfter Bruce issues the invitation \"Do you think you're ready to prove it all night?\" he vocalizes off-mic for a bar or two before executing what can only be characterized as a HOT SHIT guitar intro: not flamboyant, but dynamic and full of tension and so intently true to the original emotional core of the song. The band comes in, and again, it is this perfect meshing of parts that carries the intro.\n\nThe '78 \"Prove It\"'s were also glorious for the verbalized exaltations on the bridge, exquisitely placed \"ohhh\"s and \"uh-huhs,\" and that's the case here. A guitar solo sharp and sweet, and then the last verse, the last verse! Bruce is half-singing, half-growling \"What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie / What it's like to live and die,\" and you can palpably feel the intensity. The call-and-response at the end, the audience and the band singing \"Prove It All Night\" back at each other, before The Phantom swings out in front the way that only Danny Federici could do, Roy holding the back line, and there is Bruce playing fast and furious, almost ecstatic, Max holding it all down with military precision. Bruce calls out both Max and Danny at the end for their contributions.\n\n\"Racing in the Street\" once again highlights the ease with which Danny and Roy could weave and layer and never crowd each other. Bruce's emotions and vocal timbre are just achingly, precisely aligned; it's bright but sharp and a little sad, like the end of summer. He alludes to that, changing lyrics to mention summer being gone, as well as a nod to the audience when he switches \"Northeast\" to \"Southern,\" and the audience reacts instantly: they are with him, this is truly a scenario where the audience is in concert with the performer. (This, of course, is based on a FM recording of the show, and it is yet to be seen how much of that color makes it onto the official release.)\n\nBruce prefaces \"Thunder Road\" with the story we know, how he wrote it in that little house in West End, and — as he referenced in Episode 13 of From My Home to Yours — how he saw a poster for Thunder Road but \"never saw the movie. I remember I only saw the poster. But I took the title and I wrote this song, I never thought there was any place that was like this song,\" and then we're in the desert and there's the poster of Geronimo: \"Over on top it said 'LANDLORD,' and he had a big white sign, and painted in red, it said: 'This is the land of peace, love, justice, and no mercy,' and it pointed down this little dirt road that said 'Thunder Road'.\"\n\nThere's an eager intensity to Bruce's lyric delivery, where you can viscerally feel the movement of the car and the wind and the road. The fans are with him here too, delightfully applauding themselves after answering the \"Say it!\" cue in the first verse.\n\nThey have absolutely earned this particular \"Jungleland.\" As emotion builds in the intro, maybe you'll hold an imaginary guitar aloft in your living room just like I did. Bruce's vocal delivery edges into something almost operatic, as though he is overwhelmed by energy and emotion and is doing his best to hold it back. Danny swirls around him like watercolors, and then he is there, beseeching the crowd at the end: \"SAY IT NOW,\" like a Baptist preacher.\n\nWe come back to earth with quick and businesslike band intros as the first set — just the first set! — comes to an end. Even at home, or wherever you might be with this in your headphones, you will be glad for a moment to catch your breath, because we still have the second half to come.\n\nWhen the band returns, Bruce begins: \"We're all on the radio tonight, so I wanna say hello to everybody in Atlanta and out there, everybody down in Florida who's listening in, folks out in Austin, Houston and Dallas…. Now, it might be a little early for this next song, but we might not see you around Christmas time, so I've got a story to tell.\" It's not surprising that \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\" is showing up in September — it was played at the Capitol Theatre shows just a week and a half earlier, and \"Santa\" had been known to make its appearance in the late summer and early fall.\n\nApparently this number was accompanied by fake snow, so while some roadies grab brooms and clean up the \"popcorn,\" as Bruce refers to it, he says: \"I tell you what we need: we need a broom, and we need a little 'Night Train'!\"\n\nYes, \"Night Train\" — James Brown's \"Night Train,\" the only time that E Street has ever played \"Night Train,\" in the spirit of Bruce's habit of playing location-specific one-off covers (like \"Sea Cruise\" at the Naval Academy in Annapolis earlier on the tour).\n\nThis isn't vamped, this isn't \"stump the band,\" and while I'm sure that every member of the E Street Band could fake their way through \"Night Train,\" this was clearly rehearsed and planned, Bruce delightfully announcing the various stops, even if they are out of order and include some locations (like Dallas) which aren't in the original — it does not matter, because the E Street Band are playing \"Night Train\" and it gets tighter as it goes along, Bruce verbally conducting over the bridge, and Clarence playing the hell out of the sax line.\n\nAtlanta featured the '78 sequence of \"Fire\" / \"Candy's Room\" / \"Because the Night\" / \"Point Blank\" / \"She's the One\" (with bonus \"Not Fade Away\" and \"Gloria\"), certainly a memorable manifestation of that particular narrative arc. (Like, that is a story.) He'd played with the placement of \"Candy's Room\" and \"Fire\" (which was, of course, then unreleased) before, but this here is a statement. It takes a particular mindset to sell it and not have it be overbearing. But the E Street Band sound so agile and light on their feet and yet also so goddamn precise that it's intense as all get-out but not ever too much — it's one of those magic nights where they just follow Bruce wherever he goes. By \"Not Fade Away\" Bruce is definitely, as the kids say, feeling himself, and it is (at least on the original FM-sourced tapes) one of the many delightful moments where you hear E Street on backing vocals. \"All must sing,\" indeed.\n\nThe Morricone-styled intro to \"Rosalita\" gives everyone a chance to simmer down, but not for long, because this is a \"Rosie\" on steroids. It is so insanely energetic that you can't believe what you are hearing. Slightly more expanded band intros here — \"A warm round of applause for Miami Steve Van Zandt\" — before ending with, \"Wherever you are, you can't hide! Come out tonight!\" bringing us to the end of the second set.\n\n\"I wanna thank everybody for coming down to the show tonight. I wanna say we're sorry about missing you the last time, I got sick for a few days there… I know there's a lot of people listening, and I'd like to thank all you folks here in Atlanta and all those people who supported the band over the past two or three years when we were having a hard time, I just wanna thank you very much.\"\n\n\"Born to Run\" takes us into the repeated query, \"Are you ready for the Tenth? Are you ready for the Tenth?\" no less than four times; the Medley comes complete with \"I've been asked by the management at the theater to advise anyone with a weak stomach or a weak heart to please step into the lobby during the next section of the show! For you folks out there in radioland, this next portion is strictly visual.\"\n\nBut the show is still not over. Coming back out yet one more time, Bruce declares, \"You wanted us to do another one, all you had to do was…. raise your hand!\" leading into an outstanding rendition of the E Street favorite and Eddie Floyd classic. It's prime \"All must sing\" time, the band members joining in with gusto.\n\nIn the last chorus, Bruce charges the listeners at home: \"Now, everybody out there on the radio, I want you to get up… I want you to walk over to your dial, I want you to turn it up as loud as it'll go, I want you to open up all the windows in the house, and if the cops come knocking at your door, tell 'em 'Too bad,' and if they keep on knocking, tell 'em to send all the complaints to Columbia Records in New York City, New York!\"\n\nThe glee tinged with relief in Bruce's voice in the final number betrays that he knows this one was a keeper. Forty-two years later, it still is.\n\nAlso read: Erik Flannigan's latest nugs.net blog entry, \"Walk Over To Your Dial, Turn It Up As Loud As It'll Go\"\n\n- October 9, 2020 - Caryn Rose reporting - cover photograph by PJay Plutzer\n\nWE HAVE SEEN INDUCTION CEREMONY FUTURE\n\nSpringsteen to induct Landau in Rock Hall event broadcast November 7\n\nJust because the Rock Hall's live Induction Ceremony in May had to be COVID-cancelled, doesn't mean we won't get to see Bruce Springsteen honor his longtime manager, producer, and friend (and pioneering rock journaist) Jon Landau.\n\nNew plans have been announced for the induction event, which will now be presented as an HBO special next month — and Springsteen is on the official roster.

The first to be officially announced: Bruce Springsteen will be a guest on The Graham Norton Show on release day itself, Friday, October 23. Likely via video call — we doubt he'll be sitting on the couch, as he was for his first visit in 2019 (pictured above) — Bruce will join Lily James, Matthew McConaughey, and musical guest Sam Smith. The show airs Fridays at 10:35pm on BBC1 and BBC iPlayer in the U.K., or later via BBC America in the U.S.\n\n- October 8, 2020\n\nphotograph by Danny Clinch\n\nRECAP: VOLUME 13, \"MY KINGDOM FOR A CAR\"\n\nThe road is life, and radio on!\n\nOkay, we've got 66 twice, plus 88, add 2-4-6-8… with an 85, carry the 6… ah, screw it — cars were made to get us away from stuff like math, right?\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Bruce Springsteen's theme-time radio show landed his all-time favorite metaphor, and in Volume 13 of From My Home to Yours he welcomes \"car freaks, gearheads, fellow travelers, and listeners from coast to coast and around the world\" to his \"tribute to the automobile and the open road,\" titled \"My Kingdom for a Car.\"\n\nEven at a full 90 minutes, Volume 13 feels streamlined: no long stories over instrumental beds, just driving songs — driving in all senses of the word — from here to the horizon. The radio's on, and Springsteen is the DJ hearing your prayer. Bruce being King of the Car Song, it's fascinating to see what made his cut — to hear the ones that made him nod his head and think, \"Yeah, that's on the list.\"\n\nThe episode title, \"My Kingdom for a Car,\" comes from a 1970 Phil Ochs song. The lyrics scan like a template for Springsteen's career-full of auto imagery: \"flyin' down a highway of gold,\" \"I am master of all that's flying by me,\" \"I'm racin' with the wind in my hair,\" and…\n\nCome to me baby\n\nWe will leave this path it was not made for man\n\nWe'll find a new land\n\nBut the traffic is jammed\n\nHe cues up a cover version by one of his many favorite undersung bands, giving Nashville's Jason and the Scorchers their From My Home to Yours debut.\n\nIt's a, yes, scorching slab of U.S. Highway rock 'n' roll — and for more Americana, we later get Guy Clark (\"one of our great Texas singer-songwriters\") and Bruce's old pal Jackson Browne — but Volume 13 also reminds us that the car song is not a purely American phenomenon. A triple-shot of The Clash, the Tom Robinson Band, and the Screaming Blue Messiahs is proof positive that the Brits know their way around the motorway, even if they're driving on the opposite side.\n\nThe car song is not a white phenomenon, either: four songs in a row featuring black artists span seven decades. An incredible obscure cut from 2016, \"American Muscle\" by the duo 1 AMVRKA (pronounced \"One America\"), is balanced by the truly foundational \"No Particular Place to Go\" by \"the master\" Chuck Berry. From one song to the next, it's a reminder that while Springsteen will always be rooted in the classics, he never stops checking out next year's model, either.\n\nIn that same stretch, \"Rocket 88\" (\"credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, who were actually Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm\") is followed by Sir Mix-a-Lot's \"My Hooptie.\" Our DJ offers some background on the seminal \"Rocket 88\" — \"considered by many to be the first rock 'n' roll record, and of course, its subject is the car\" — but he holds the full detailing package for the \"one of my favorite and funniest old-school rappers, out of Seattle, Washington\":\n\nA \"hooptie\" is any car that meets the following:\n\na. Driver must enter car through passenger side\n\nb. Three different brands and size tires, three of them missing hubcaps\n\nc. Exhaust pipe is held up by half a wire clothes hanger; the other half of said hanger replaces the antenna\n\nd. Backfires every three blocks, the loudest backfire being when car is turned off\n\ne. Must open door at drive-thru window, as the windows do not roll down\n\nf. You only get one AM station, and the 1970s tape deck eats all tapes inserted\n\ng. You must manually move the blinker lever up and down as it no longer blinks on its own\n\nh. Has had the same temporary registration sticker in the window for past 18 months\n\ni. Despite all the above, still has $200 professional tint job\n\nSpringsteen introduces the Clash's \"Brand New Cadillac\" (a Vince Taylor cover) with a portion of \"In an Instant,\" a poem by Caren Krutsinger:\n\nShe was getting out of a beautiful navy blue Cadillac with red seats.\n\nShe was more exotic than the car; her date was a handsome creature too.\n\nWith dark skin and dark eyes that danced. He was delighted with her.\n\nThis was at least fifty years ago and I have never forgotten\n\nA glimpse of her beautiful leg as she exited this fantastic car.\n\nThe Vulgar Boatmen's \"Drive Somewhere\" is a selection that we never would have predicted but gets a top J.D. Power rating in our book. \"A real beauty,\" Bruce calls it, and the band \"fabulously unknown.\" Like Depeche Mode's \"great version of 'Route 66',\" it's also a reminder that, while college radio in the 1980s practically existed to be an \"alternative\" to music like Springsteen's, the Boss was still paying attention. Screaming Blue Messiahs are in that niche as well: \"They garnered wide critical acclaim, and unfortunately limited commercial success, particularly here in America,\" Bruce says. \"They however, without a doubt, are one of the great bands of the '80s.\" And besides, how could he not play a song called \"Jesus Chrysler Drives a Dodge\"?\n\nBob Dylan's \"From a Buick 6\" is given a particular place of honor, propped up between two quotes from Jack Kerouac's On the Road.\n\nThe only people for me are the mad ones… who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.…\n\nFollowing the Dylan track, Bruce notes that it's \"from the history-making Highway 61 Revisited album. I played that record til it fell to pieces on my little box stereo in my bedroom in Freehold, New Jersey. It remains a modern masterpiece.\" And then the Kerouac chaser:\n\n…because he had no place he could stay in without getting tired of it and because there was nowhere to go but everywhere, our battered suitcases were piled on the sidewalk again. We had longer ways to go. Keep rolling under the stars. The road is life.\n\nVolume 12: \"Summer's End\" demonstrated that Bruce could be perfectly happy going an episode without playing his own music. Not this time, not this subject. Springsteen songs haunt the playlist even when they're not there: you won't hear him sing \"roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair,\" but you will hear Robert Mitchum's \"The Ballad of Thunder Road,\" from the 1958 film. It's a two-for-one, evoking his own wings-for-wheels masterpiece without playing it. \"And yeah, folks,\" he says, \"this is where I got the title.\"\n\nIt's not the only ghost of a Springsteen song here, either, as later he tells a story you're sure is going to lead in to a particular Nebraska track:\n\nYour dad and his car: those were two things that could not be separated. All I remember was my old man coming home, bringing home a new used car. Park it out on the grass in the backyard. We'd all come hustling out of the house, stand around it — couldn't get in it yet, not til he said it was all right. But we'd run our hands over the fins, all over the hood, and finally Pop would say, \"All right, everybody in!\" And we'd hustle in that car. He'd start that thing up, slip it into gear, and pull us out on the main street, and we just went for a cruise. And for a short while we felt like the Springsteen family are the kings of this highway! It was just one of the deepest memories of my childhood.\n\nBut after that story, there's really no need for \"Used Cars.\" In just one of many hard lefts and quick gear changes, he spins a cover of Marc Cohn's \"Silver Thunderbird\" instead, refreshingly sung by Jo Dee Messina in strong voice.\n\nOf course, Bruce has enough of his own car songs to fill up a 90-minute mix and then some. I've made one; you've probably made one; The Live Series has made one, too. So for his own personal selections, Bruce goes way off-road, steering around such biggies as \"Racing in the Street\" and \"Stolen Car.\"\n\n\"Open All Night,\" probably his purest car song (about the car itself and the experience of driving, rather than the characters inside), is here, but not in its original Nebraska form; instead, Bruce breaks out the Sessions Band jump-blues performance from Live in Dublin. And who would have predicted \"Brothers Under the Bridges ('83)\"? Springsteen says more about the outtake (released on Tracks) here than he ever has: \"A very distinctive version from the one I cut later, about these young street racers out in the Midwest, building their cars in garages over the winter, bringing them out in the spring, and running them down on the dry lake beds.\"\n\nAfter \"Bridges,\" we get a third Kerouac passage…\n\nI was surprised, as always, by how easy the act of leaving was, and how good it felt. The world was suddenly rich with possibility.\n\n…as well as a true \"all-time classic\" about that very feeling: Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers' \"Roadrunner.\" The song's late-night ride is a precursor to \"Open All Night\" and \"State Trooper,\" transposed from Jersey to the burbs of Boston. In Richman's world, the radio isn't jammed up — it's on, and hey-ho, he's in love with modern rock 'n' roll. Of the zillion driving songs that could have been left by the wayside, this one feels crucial — and its position in the set suggests the DJ thinks so too.\n\nThere's only one thing left to do from there… and that's \"Drive All Night.\" A perfect, perfectly obvious choice worth steering right into.\n\n\"Stay safe, stay healthy and strong behind the wheel. Keep your radio on, and God bless you.\"\n\nPlaylist\n\nNelson Riddle & His Orchestra - \"Theme From Route 66\"\n\nJason and the Scorchers - \"My Kingdom for a Car\"\n\nDepeche Mode - \"Route 66\"\n\nJackie Brenston and his Delta Cats - \"Rocket 88\"\n\nSir Mix-a-Lot - \"My Hooptie\"\n\n1 AMVRKA - \"American Muscle\"\n\nChuck Berry - \"No Particular Place to Go\"\n\n[Poetry reading] Caren Krutsinger's \"In an Instant\"\n\nThe Clash - \"Brand New Cadillac\"\n\nTom Robinson Band - \"2-4-6-8 Motorway\"\n\nThe Screaming Blue Messiahs - \"Jesus Chrysler Drives a Dodge\"\n\nFleshtones - \"Ride Your Pony\"\n\nNas (featuring Charlie WIlson) - \"Car #85\"\n\nRobert Mitchum - \"Ballad of Thunder Road\"\n\nBruce Springsteen and the Sessions Band - \"Open All Night\" (Live in Dublin)\n\n[Reading] Jack Kerouac's On the Road (excerpt 1)\n\nBob Dylan - \"From a Buick 6\"\n\n[Reading] Jack Kerouac's On the Road (excerpt 2)\n\nJackson Browne - \"Running on Empty\" (live)\n\nJo Dee Messina - \"Silver Thunderbird\"\n\nGuy Clark - \"Out in the Parking Lot\"\n\nThe Vulgar Boatmen - \"Drive Somewhere\"\n\nBruce Springsteen - \"Brothers Under the Bridges ('83)\"\n\n[Reading] Jack Kerouac's On the Road (excerpt 3)\n\nJonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers - \"Roadrunner\"\n\nBruce Springsteen - \"Drive All Night\"\n\n- October 7, 2020 - Christopher Phillips reporting\n\n- October 6, 2020\n\nDOUBLE DELIVERY\n\nOctober 23 to bring Letter to You album and documentary film\n\nWhen a motion picture expanded on the music and message of 2019's Western Stars, it did so four months after the album's release date. Later this month, Bruce Springsteen's new album and its accompanying film will hit on the same day.\n\nOn October 23, AppleTV+ will premiere Bruce Springsteen's Letter to You, a \"feature-length verité documentary\" from Apple Original Films offering \"a behind-the-scenes look at the iconic artist's creative process\" that is also \"a tribute to the E Street Band, to rock music itself and to the role it has played in Springsteen's life.\"\n\n\"Throughout the documentary, Springsteen shares his thoughts and feelings behind Letter to You and puts the new music into the context of his entire body of work,\" states this afternoon's Apple press release. \"In that way, it's the next piece in the autobiographical series that began with the memoir Born to Run, continued with Springsteen on Broadway and advanced through his film Western Stars.\"\n\nSpringsteen gets writing credit on the new film, with sole directing credit going to Thom Zimny, Bruce's frequent film collaborator and Western Stars co-director. According to the press release, the new doc:\n\nfeatures full performances from the E Street Band, in-studio footage, never-before-seen archival material and a deeper look into Letter to You from Springsteen himself.\n\ncaptures Springsteen recording Letter to You live with the full E Street Band, and includes final take performances of ten originals from the new record.\n\nWhile the music videos for \"Letter to You\" and \"Ghosts\" have provided glimpses of the Letter to You studio sessions, a new trailer offers a better sense of what to expect in the feature-length doc:\n\nBruce Springsteen's Letter to You is produced by Jon Landau and Zimny and co-produced by Barbara Carr, with Springsteen serving as executive producer.\n\n- October 5, 2020\n\nFRANKENSTEEN REBORN… TO BE WORN\n\nJust in time for Halloween 2020, Frank Caruso's vision of 10/31/84 transforms into limited \"Gory Days Tour merch\"\n\nIt's no secret that the real-life horror of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will be spoiling a lot of Halloween fun this year. Enjoying Halloween 2020 may be trickier than usual, but there still are some treats to be found. Thanks to our friend Frank Caruso, the artist who collaborated with Bruce Springsteen on the Outlaw Pete picture book, we're thrilled to offer something special for our readers this Rocktober.\n\nLast Halloween, in celebration of the 35th anniversary of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band's October 31, 1984 concert at the legendary L.A. Sports Arena, Frank provided us with his own unique artistic vision of the opening of that night's show — an imaginative (and extremely funny) set of visuals to accompany and enhance Bruce's storytelling. In the process, Caruso \"Halloweenified\" Bruce Springsteen (aka Dr. Frankensteen's Monster) as well as the entire 1984 version of the E Street Band, their audience, and even the L.A. Sports Arena itself. Click here to read all about it in detail.\n\nOne year later, as we prepare for a very different kind of Halloween, Frank has transformed his artwork into an awesome nod to vintage tour merch — a new tee designed as something that fans could've purchased during Dr. Frankensteen and the Sonic Booo's legendary mid-1980s Gory Days Tour. Missed that tour? Well, at least now you can buy a shirt and tell everybody you were there.\n\nCaruso even transformed our Backstreets logo on the sleeve into something more thematically appropriate, including an ingenious alteration of those iconic sneakers.\n"
