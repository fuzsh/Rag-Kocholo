The Shelter endured criticism from politicians and residents who complain about its visible location and open-door policy.

Webster said Friday. \"He was the go-to guy on any kind of ethical inquiry.\"\n\nMr. Shaheen challenged the appearance of oil and gas tax shelters held by Attorney General William French Smith and rebuked Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti, who had denied that he had discussed the investigation of Billy Carter, a registered foreign agent for Libya, with his brother, President Jimmy Carter. He attacked the Clinton White House in testimony before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee in 1995 for its failure to cooperate in his investigation of firings in the White House travel office.\n\nHis office had asked for two years for diaries or journals kept by deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster, who committed suicide during the investigation. But it was while reading a magazine article that Mr. Shaheen learned that Foster had kept a daily log that the administration had not turned over, he told the committee.\n\nIn addition to investigating headline names, Mr. Shaheen and his office also examined misconduct in the ranks of the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Border Patrol, Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nHowever, his credibility stemmed from his willingness to tackle the misdeeds of top officials, and not just those of the less-powerful. In 1978, his office published the Justice Department's first report on abuses by longtime FBI director J. Edgar Hoover and his inner circle. Mr. Shaheen said at the time that \"there definitely would have been prosecutions if the statute of limitations hadn't run.\" Hoover died in 1972. Colleagues said Mr. Shaheen's style helped explain how he managed to hold the watchdog position for so long. \"He combined a Southern courtliness with an explosive sense of humor, the kind of appreciation usually associated with knee-slapper jokes,\" said journalist and author Ronald J. Ostrow.\n\nMr. Shaheen was born in Boston and grew up in Mississippi. He graduated from Yale University and in 1965 received a law degree from Vanderbilt University. He clerked for a federal judge in Tennessee and practiced law in Como, Miss., where he was elected mayor while still in his 20s. He practiced law in Memphis before joining the Justice Department in 1973 in the civil rights division. Two years later, he was special counsel for intelligence to Attorney General Edward H. Levi. Levi established the Office of Professional Responsibility at the end of 1975. At the time of its establishment, the office was the only agency in the executive branch that could start administrative and criminal internal investigations. It never had more than 35 lawyers, but it conducted thousands of examinations.\n\nAfter his resignation in 1997, Mr. Shaheen served as chief counsel and deputy executive director of the congressionally mandated Commission on the Advancement of Federal Law Enforcement. He was also special investigative counsel for an independent review of the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigation division. In 2000, he became senior counselor to then-IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti. He received the Presidential Rank Award for Distinguished Service and two Meritorious Service Awards. Survivors include his wife, Polly Shaheen of Falls Church; three sons, Michael Shaheen III of Ithaca, N.Y., Timothy Shaheen of Falls Church and Francisco Macedo of Atlanta; four half sisters; a half brother; and three grandchildren.\n\nJoe Inman Majors, a well-respected and popular capitol hill lobbyist, died in his sleep at home. He was 70. Majors, who had been suffering from cancer and heart disease, had just celebrated his birthday on Christmas Day. A former member of the Tennessee State House of Representatives representing Tullahoma, Majors came from the royal family of Tennessee football. His late father, Shirley Majors, was the head coach at the University of the South in Sewanee for 21 years and was a charter inductee into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame. Three of Majors' brothers played at the University of Tennessee, the best-known being Johnny Majors, who went on to coach UT for many years.\n\nNo slouch on the football field himself, Joe Majors played college football at the University of Alabama and at Florida State University. In 1960, he joined the Houston Oilers in the charter season of the American Football League. He played one season there as a quarterback and defensive back. Majors lobbied for Atlanta-based Community Loans of America, the Tennessee Consumer Finance Association, the Tennessee Hotel and Lodging Association, the Tennessee Oil Marketers Association, and the Tennessee Pawnbrokers Association. He was also a founding member of the Tennessee Lobbyist Association. Majors is survived by his wife Elizabeth Scokin, sons Frank and Inman, brothers Johnny, Bobby, and Larry, and sister Shirley Ann Husband.\n\nClass of 1966\n\nJames Monroe passed away March 2 in Kingwood, Texas at the age of 83.Jim is survived by his wife of 56 years, Cindy Monroe; daughters, Amy Monroe and Sarah Monroe.
