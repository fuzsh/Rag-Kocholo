        "text": "üöÄ Reflecting on our incredible journey at Vensure Employer Solutions over the past four years! When I joined Vensure in September 2020, John Dnyprowsky was building a team of all-stars to support the newly formed Northeast region. We were a small group of 8, operating out of a WeWork on Madison Ave during the height of the pandemic. Resilience was a requirement as we navigated new insurance policies, partner relationships, late nights, and growth plans. Fast forward to September 2024, and Vensure has transformed beyond recognition. Our sales organization has grown 10x to 500+ employees, with our Northeast team now comprising 25 consultants. Our new Park Ave office is filled with energy and complete with ample desks for our expanding team! At the recent Vensure Sales Kickoff (VSKO), I had the privilege of speaking in front of our entire sales organization alongside Shane McCarthy, Anne Erdman, Nicole Sussman, Jason Olson, and Tim McReavy. It‚Äôs truly inspiring to see how far we‚Äôve come together. A huge thank you to our leadership team for their unwavering support and dedication throughout this journey. Here‚Äôs to achieving even greater heights together!
