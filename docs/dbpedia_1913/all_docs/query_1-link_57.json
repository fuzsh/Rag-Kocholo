        "text": "Photos:\n\nA dramatically different Baker in the early years, and in the 1980's, before his death\n\nThe date is Nov. 2, 1966.\n\nHeadlines proclaim: \"Viet Civilians Defy Cong Terrorists\" and \"Johnson Appeals for Unity in the U.S.\"\n\nAn article about a recent study is headlined: \"Men Enjoy Company of Pleasant Women.\"\n\nSandy Koufax has won his third Cy Young Award.\n\nBuckhorn beer sells for 69 cents a six-pack. Ground beef is 45 cents a pound.\n\nAnd Chet Baker, trumpeter and vocalist extraordinaire, is beginning a three-week stint at Gaetano's on Santa Fe Drive. Every jazz buff in town puts in a few late nights listening to a master blow cool and hot.\n\nAn unknown number of the sessions are quietly taped by drummer Harry Keevis Jr. on a reel-to-reel tape machine nestled among his drums.\n\nAfter an unlikely set of events spanning 26 years and Baker's mysterious death in 1988, the tape reaches Baker's widow, Carol, who last year issued the best portions on a compact disc titled \"Chet Baker Live at Pueblo, Colorado 1966.\"\n\nIn certain circles the release propels Pueblo into jazz history. And local jazz buffs who attended the gigs mark the occasion by remembering a jazz giant, and an era in Pueblo's musical past.\n\nBaker, 36 when he played Gaetano's, embodied \"West Coast Cool,\" a jazz sound that developed in Los Angeles in the 1950s in reaction to frenetic New York City bebop. At 22 he played sideman to sax legend Charlie \"Bird\" Parker, who told Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie: \"There's a little white cat on the West Coast who's gonna eat you up.\"\n\nBaker's boyish good looks, silky voice, mellow horn playing and association with baritone sax player Gerry Mulligan catapulted him to the height of popularity in 1954, when a Downbeat readers' poll ranked him ahead of contemporaries like Davis, Gillespie, Harry James and Louis Armstrong — though Baker rejected his standing as a passing fancy.\n\nWhether Baker's birth in Yale, Okla., on the night before Christmas eve, 1929, was star-crossed or not, his association with heroin in the 1950s forever altered the trajectory of his meteoric rise. By the time he reached Pueblo, Baker could be described by associates as a \"deceitful, mysterious charmer,\" whose very survival made fans and lovers \"forgive him everything.\"\n\nAl Aguilar, 56, who today co-manages the KG Men's Store in Pueblo and gigs in his spare time, is a jazz drummer who played with Baker in California in 1957. After he moved to Pueblo, Aguilar played regularly at the Alpine, another celebrated (now defunct) jazz showcase on First Street. So when Baker came to town in 1966, Aguilar headed to Gaetano's.\n\nInside, Baker and his quartet were having lunch, part of their pay. \"I called out: `Hey Chetty!\"' Aguilar recalls today. \"And Baker looks around and says: `Nobody's called me that in a long time. Who's that?' I told him, and we hugged.\n\n\"I sat in on one set. And I emceed the first two sets. So my big thing was: `Ladies and gentlemen, Pueblo's finest supper club presents Liberty recording artist Chet Baker and his quintet.' And only four guys walked out.\"\n\nAguilar still blushes at the memory. And he still recalls the tracks under Baker's fingertips, where the trumpeter was injecting heroin, the bane of the era's jazz musicians.\n\n\"That was the last time I saw him,\" Aguilar says. \"That was part of Pueblo's jazz heyday. It was something else. The best musicians used to come through, and the audience here — you can't do anything without a good audience.\"\n\nThat audience was composed of people like Ray Calderon, 63, a retired nightclub owner and former county official who caught most of Baker's '66 sets.\n\n\"I like the night life,\" Calderon says today. \"I went into Gaetano's as a customer, sat down at the bar, and BS'd with Chet Baker. He was a regular guy.\"\n\n\"Those guys were humble,\" adds George Shaddy, 61, who in 1966 moonlighted as a bartender at Gaetano's and recalls serving Baker and his quartet.\n\nOne of the surviving members of that quartet is tenor saxophonist Phil Urso, 68, contacted in New Orleans after a gig.\n\n\"Chet was very strong at those gigs, very melodic,\" Urso recalls. \"He was magic on the bandstand, it was like an altar. And the people were good to us. The place was packed almost every night.\"\n\nUrso had been Baker's best man and briefly lived with the newlyweds in New York City in the early '60s. According to the liner notes on \"Chet Baker in Pueblo,\" written by Carol Baker, \"(Urso) would think nothing of throwing open our bedroom door at four o'clock in the morning to play something he had just written.\n\n\"(Once) Chet told him he would `kick his (expletive deleted) ass' if he knocked again. Chet loved Phil, but he also liked to sleep.\"\n\nToday, Urso — whose vocabulary is still spiced with \"man!\" and \"bread\" — remembers his friend with nothing but fondness.\n\n\"Chet Baker was a great musician on the bandstand, and a wonderful person off it,\" he says softly. \"He knew how to treat people.\"\n\nUrso relates that Baker was en route to California in the fall of 1966 when the trumpeter stopped in Colorado Springs to visit Keevis, who rustled up the Gaetano's gigs. Baker is captured on the recently released CD treating his audience to Thelonius Monk's \"'Round Midnight,\" the jazz standard \"Green Dolphin Street,\" Davis' \"Milestones\" and the bluesy vocal ballad, \"Forgetful.\"\n\n\"Jazz was at its height then,\" says Calderon. And so, apparently, were local jazz heads. \"There were about 10 of us. We were a bunch of nuts. Sometimes we'd load three or four cars and drive to Denver to catch the club scene.\"\n\nAs to his own musical inclinations, Calderon shrugs: \"I couldn't carry a tune if you put it in a bag for me.\"\n\nA review of Baker's recordings establishes that despite a hard road nearly four decades long, he never lost his tender voice or his touch on trumpet. Clearly, Baker was that rare artist whose palette held every color of the human heart, one who could capture at will the moods of the soul. A live recording made in Germany two weeks before his death in May 1988 (he fell, or was pushed from a small second-story window in Amsterdam) reveals, as one reviewer put it, vocals \"full of aching regret\" and a \"heartbreaking\" trumpet.\n\nAs to locals' encounter with Baker in Pueblo in 1966, as with so many brushes with jazz giants in the clubs of that era, Calderon says with a smile: \"You had to be in the right place at the right time.\"\n\nThat was Pueblo, November 1966.\n\nMDRV \"Chet Baker Live at Pueblo, Colorado 1966\" is available at Pueblo Records and Tapes."
