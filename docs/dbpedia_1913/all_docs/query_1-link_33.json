What I'm referring to is that people are looking for truth and something or someone that they can believe in and relate to. Authenticity leads to feelings of inclusion and the understanding that we are more similar than different. As a yoga teacher, and fellow human, its vital to me to be authentic in what I'm teaching and how I'm leading a class or a discussion on this show. But in order to do this, I must be authentic, a state of being that took me some hard lessons to truly find and settle into with comfort. Now it's my second nature to be my true nature, I am awake to myself and the ways of the mind, the ego and the world. These are my guides to keep me on my path and to alert me when I am straying off but I want to make one thing very clear, none of this would have been possible in my life without the guidance of my teacher and one of my greatest mentors, Philip Urso. Philip is co-founder of Live, Love, Teach (LLT), the yoga teacher training school based on principles like teaching from a place of love, not fear and the use of minimum relevant words to produce a dynamic, ass-kicking, synchronized vinyasa class that can rapidly transform lives. Philip and I dive right in on the subject of the relevancy of yoga teachers and he reveals a shocking truth that he and his partners found early in their research on route to the birth of LLT. He shares the ultimate source of what makes a yoga teacher relevant and why so many of us need to relearn how to talk like a human. Philip and his partners at LLT have extensively studied the most effective ways for people to learn and they are applying those methods in their teacher trainings. Fostering learning environments that make people feel safe is a top priority at LLT training and this principle results in effective practice teaching, confidence and authenticity in front of the class."
