This collaboration aims to educate students about personal well-being options. For further updates, follow @RowanUWellness on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook.\n\n2020 … a year of missing stars, murder hornets, Kobe Bryant’s passing, Chadwick Boseman’s (Black Panther) passing and many, many more.\n\nThis year has been filled with so many ups and downs that it has easily become one of the hardest years for a lot of people. According to the CDC, COVID 19 has infected 6.9 million people so far and has taken the lives of 216,000* people in the United States alone.\n\nMy first experience with the virus was one night in mid-February; my friends and I were all sitting around talking and laughing about basketball, unaware of what was to come. Days prior, whispers of schools shutting down were quickly moving through university, but since we were not affected yet we did not really understand what was going on.\n\nUntil we got the news that the NBA (National Basketball League) had suspended its season indefinitely. I know it might not seem like it was a big issue, but for sophomores in college who played and watched basketball almost every day, this was BIG news. We did not really understand that this was just the beginning of what was to come.\n\nEverything else happened so fast that I could not really catch my breath. All I knew was that one day I was back home taking Organic Chem 2 in the living room of my home while my mom was making food in the kitchen.\n\nAs a student, having your life change so drastically in the midst of all that was happening was one of the most stressful things to ever happen to me. Having to stay home and do nothing for hours except eat, sleep, watch TV and maybe go get groceries — then repeat the same thing the next day —was a big struggle, a struggle that millions of students all over the world have been going through. I was left with thoughts, decisions and problems that I had avoided for months and now, I had to face them head-on before they ate me alive. Waking up in the morning, getting out of bed, finding something productive to do became a struggle.\n\nBut we all got through it, we pushed on and made the impossible possible.\n\nEven though this pandemic lifestyle is starting to become normal, the struggles of one’s life changing so drastically, almost losing one’s identity and not knowing who we are anymore are still very real struggles that we all deal with in our everyday lives. But we will push on; this is the time that we use to grow and discover new things about ourselves. This is the time when we grow closer to our families and fix relational mistakes that were made years ago. This is the time when we grow as brothers, sisters, friends and good people. This is the time that we rediscover picnics and taking walks in the park and taking the time in our day to just breath and fully live in the moment.\n\nAccording to an article from John Hopkins Medicine, mindfulness can reduce stress and you do this by sitting quietly and just focusing on your breathing and enjoying the moment.\n\nWe as a generation are a different breed, we are not like those before us, we do things differently and that is OK. We have been through a lot, but we are still here, fighting and causing change in our everyday lives. And as long as we do not give up or quit on ourselves, we will continue to grow stronger each and every day.\n\n* as of publishing date\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nDavid Malomo, junior biological sciences major, Wellness Center intern\n\nPhotography by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\nCitation:\n\nMcGuire, Joseph F. “Stressed About COVID-19?

Cheyenne is a commuter to campus. She is a member of PsiChi, a Psychology Honors Society, and the Africana Studies Club. Can’t find her on campus? Meet Cheyenne at work at H&M in the Deptford Mall.\n\nWhy did you choose your major?\n\nI’ve always really like giving advice to people, and I figured out over time that I can help people with what they are going through. I like helping with whatever issues are in their lives, especially African American adolescents. I feel like my experience can provide them the information they need to succeed in life and to get through what they need to get through.\n\nWhat would you share with a future student interested in your major?\n\nI would say that psychology offers a lot of insight into yourself as well as the people around you. It allows you to have a better understanding and have more empathy for people who may act a certain way towards you. It gives you a better understanding of why people are the way they are — also, insight into yourself and the way you act and the root of how you go about your daily life.\n\nHow does your field impact the world?\n\nPsychology impacts the world in a very large way. All of our actions and the way we move about in the world really come back to our mind state and our environment growing up. The impact I would like to have on the world is giving African American people a better sense of belonging and understanding of themselves in this world because it does get hard. I would like to provide them with a sense of motivation and inspiration to let them know they will get through what they are going through no matter what their circumstances are. They have the ability to succeed.\n\nHow are you involved on campus?\n\nBeing a part of PsiChi Honor Society has given me a push because I am applying to grad school, so I think showing that I am dedicated to my major will help. It is helping me succeed for the future and my future career. Being a part of the Africana Studies Club also supports me in my pursuit of where I want to work with African American adolescents. The combination of the two helps me to succeed in my career and give me necessary tools.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve shared with a Rowan professor in which you felt like you were working with a visionary in your field.\n\nProfessor Chelsea Young was very connected to us as a class. She used pop culture references to help us understand the concepts we were learning about. I just really appreciate the time I had in her class, it was a really good experience.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nCamryn Hadley, senior public relations and advertising double major\n\nPhotography by:\n\nQuintin Stinney, sophomore Radio/TV/Film major\n\n#PROFspective: Music Education Major Austin Kurbansade\n\nToday we feature Austin Kurbansade, a sophomore Vocal Music Education major from Roxbury Township, NJ (Morris County). He is an on-campus resident and is involved in the National Association of Music Education, American Choral Directors Association and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia. He tells us today about his student experience and how connected he has felt at Rowan. […]\n\nSenior Marketing Major Byron P. Campbell Jr. Reflects On The Black Lives Matter Movement\n\nToday we speak to Byron P. Campbell Jr., a senior Marketing major from Neptune, NJ (Monmouth County). He lived on campus for three years and lives off-campus this year. Byron is a first-generation college student.\n\nHow have you gotten involved at Rowan?\n\nI joined Greek life and I was a Resident Assistant for three years. I have gone to ASPIRE Leadership retreats, and I have been to Multicultural Men’s Retreats for the Social Justice, Inclusion, and Conflict Resolution (SJICR) office. I have also spoken on a panel about leadership at Rowan.\n\nWhat does the Black Lives Matter movement mean to you?\n\nBLM is an awareness of what’s been happening since the beginning. We want to be equal like everyone else. It’s always been one step forward, one step back. The protests get attention, and they get people to see what’s been happening since the beginning.\n\nWhat do you think that Rowan can do to better serve the BLM movement?\n\nRowan has made great strides, but there should be more free spaces to speak. There is SJICR, where people usually talk. There needs to be more spaces to talk about it. People feel a divide, and they need an opportunity to talk. There are lots of meetings, events and resources are out there, but for some reason it hasn’t translated to the students participating more. Understanding how other people feel is important. You need to understand how others feel.\n\nWhat does inclusivity mean to you?\n\nA space to talk. Some people will put you down and say all lives matter, but having your voice heard is important.\n\nDo you feel Rowan is an inclusive environment?\n\nIt will take a while to be more inclusive. Rowan is reactive and not preventative. Nobody speaks up and tells the right people when there is a problem, but always [does] something after the fact.\n\nCould you share a little bit about your relationship with Vice President Richard Jones?\n\nHe has been one of the most supportive people on campus for me. I met him at my freshman orientation, when he was a speaker. I asked him my freshman year if he could take me under his wing, and he’s helped me through college. Richard Jones has been a mentor to me.\n\nWhat is one of your favorite moments with a faculty/staff member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nOne favorite experience in my Intro to Marketing class with Professor Puckett was learning how marketing is used all the time, whether selling a product or service or even selling yourself for a job. That really made me want to switch my major to marketing. At the time I was an accounting major, and it was Professor Puckett who shared with me that he thought marketing would be a good fit for me.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nOne amazing thing I learned in my major this year is all the paths I can take with a marketing major. I can be in all types of fields in the job force.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nPhotos courtesy of:\n\nByron P. Campbell Jr., senior marketing major\n\nRowan’s Business Certificate, MBA Programs an Ideal Pairing for Marc Castrillon, Future HR Pro\n\nToday we feature Marc Castrillon, a Rowan Global student pursuing his master’s degree in business administration (MBA). Here, Marc talks about his Rowan experience and how completing the Business Certificate of Graduate Study launched him into the MBA program and, soon, a dream career.\n\nMarc Castrillon didn’t envision himself in a Rowan MBA cohort when he first entered the Rohrer College of Business as an undergraduate just five short years ago. Yet by this spring, he will have amassed three degrees, one certificate of graduate study, two field experiences and numerous professional connections through a student leadership role.\n\nHe’s now confidently on his way to a career in human resources management. “If I knew what I know now, two years ago, or a year ago, I would have had even less hesitation and been even more excited for the graduate program,” he says.\n\nMarc’s graduate journey began with a major change as a business undergrad. He arrived to the Rowan as a Marketing major. In speaking with his sister, whose career is in human resources, and others in the profession, Marc discovered he was interested in the same line of work. After taking HR-intensive courses, Marc added the Human Resources Management major to his undergraduate degree in Management.\n\nWith a path in motion, Marc initially researched human resources advanced degrees to build upon his knowledge base; but he discovered other area HR master’s programs were “three or four times the price and a lot of extra requirements.”\n\nCasting a wider net, Marc found an option with Rowan Global’s Business Certificate of Graduate Study (COGS), which checked off a few boxes. He took the required five courses and, upon admittance into the MBA, transferred the credits into its larger, broader business degree. The accelerated pace of just 15 credits also meant Marc could complete the program quickly, which he says he felt compelled to do soon after graduation.\n\n“At the time, I was already on a roll with school, and I was performing at a really high pace and getting good grades. I didn’t want to go and work for a few years and then come back and lose that momentum,” he says.\n\nThrough the COGS program, students who apply and are accepted into Rowan’s MBA may enter without a standardized test requirement — an admissions component Marc also appreciated. “I knew that if I went through the COGS program, and I performed as well as I had been doing in my undergraduate, I wouldn’t have to take the GMAT. And I did not want to take off three to six or … however many months it would take for me to prepare for that test. So that was a major factor in me deciding to go straight into my graduate program,” he explains.\n\nMarc’s choice to pursue the broader Rowan MBA paid off in other ways as well; he’s taken classes outside his human resources track and notes faculty are quick to deliver on new courses based on student feedback he may not have had access to in a more narrow program.\n\n“I think how wide the scale the classes are in the MBA program really shows how much the school cares about its students,” he says. “They recently added entrepreneurship courses that were not previously available — and they became available because a lot of students have been asking for entrepreneurship-type courses.”\n\nThe College of Business has tapped Marc to serve as the inaugural Director of Community and Membership for the Rohrer Graduate Student and Alumni Advisory Board. According to its website, “Members are actively engaged in academics and shared community connections that elevate the student experience and the reputation of Rohrer Graduate Programs.”\n\nIn this new role, Marc has leveraged his business skills to lead recruiting, outreach and engagement efforts. He also co-manages a lively LinkedIn account for MBA and M.S. in Finance students and alumni. He enjoys his new position as it closely aligns with his future goals.\n\n“It’s really good for someone who is working within human resources recruiting and retaining membership,” Marc says. “That’s a big component of it — networking events. For now we’re trying to work on online networking events. But I would [also] love the opportunity to create a networking event in person.”\n\nA pandemic has not slowed down Marc’s year-long internship experience with the healthcare company LabCorp, where he is learning to determine executive and sales compensation for employees at the vice president level or above both domestically and abroad.\n\n“I don’t know if I want to stay in compensation; there are other parts of human resources that I want to get into. So following my MBA, I want to get SHRM [Society of Human Resource Management] certification,” Marc says.\n\nZeroing in on his future, Marc is acutely aware of the importance networking and professional connections have played in his academic life. Until entering the graduate program, he says: “I didn’t realize how much farther [faculty] are willing to go with you to make sure that you succeed.\n\n“Even if it’s outside of their office hours, they will sit with you after class and they’ll explain a problem to you. And they make everybody feel welcome … the whole graduate program feels very inclusive, which to my understanding with my friends who are in other graduate programs, I don’t know if they can say the same.”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nPhysically Distant but Socially Strong: Luis and Nick\n\nAssistant resident director Luis Acevedo and resident assistant Nick Petrole share how they continue to social distance during the pandemic.

Erwin, a first-generation college student, lives on campus in the Rowan Boulevard Apartments. He’s a member of the Pre Physician Assistant Club, Crew Club Team and the Exercise is Medicine Club, for which he’s Fundraising Chair. Erwin also works for the Office of Orientation and Student Leadership Programs.\n\nWhy did you choose your major?\n\nI chose Health and Exercise Science as my major because at first, I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do. I knew I wanted to go to graduate school, and I knew I wanted to be part of a health-related field. Health and Exercise Science gave me a broader spectrum of things that I can do, such as medical school or PA school or PT and OT, and so on.\n\nWhat would you share with a future student interested in your major?\n\nThe major is fun and you can do a lot with it. It is very versatile and there isn’t only one thing you have to do with it. It is very flexible in regard to what you can do with it.\n\nHow does your field impact the world?\n\nIt’s helping people, no matter what field you go into after completing the Health and Exercise Science program. No matter what you do with it, there’s always going be that aspect of helping people and providing a service to people.\n\nHave you had any professors that you felt really cared about your wellbeing?\n\nThis isn’t major-specific, but my College Composition professor, Professor Mandi Dorrell, was a really great professor. She understood that you’re also a person and not just a student. She was very helpful and understanding of people’s problems. She was very caring in that aspect.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\nSeniors Share How They Have Grown From Their Freshman Year Mistakes\n\nRowan seniors Stephania Bocanegra, Alexander Brown and Aaron Lee reveal how their freshmen year mistakes helped them grow into the student leaders they are today.\n\nStephania Bocanegra, a Civil and Environmental Engineering major from Cape May, NJ (Cape May County), currently lives on campus as a Resident Assistant at Victoria Apartments. Stephania started off at a community college and transferred to Rowan.\n\n“I wish I kept the work ethic I had as an honors student in high school to my first year of college,” she says. “By the time I transferred, I didn’t feel as prepared because I slacked off a bit in community college. My grades were good, but I didn’t need to work as hard. When I got to Rowan, I needed to start working harder because the classes were very different.”\n\nStephania quickly got into a groove at Rowan and began to flourish in the college environment. She is the Student Government Association officer for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the United Latinos Association.\n\nAlexander Brown is a Music Industry Business Major with minors in Africana Studies, Music, and a Vocal Concentration. He is originally from Montego Bay, Jamaica and currently lives on campus as a Resident Assistant in Chestnut Hall. He shared that as a freshman, he didn’t take advantage of all of the extracurricular options that are available at Rowan. “I was more focused on adjusting myself to college life, so I was nervous to try too many new things. As I continued to grow, I tried to join organizations and clubs to put myself out there and get involved to meet new people,” he says.\n\nAs a senior, Alex is now the President of Profecy Acapella Club and the Treasurer of music fraternity Phi Mu Alpha.\n\nAaron Lee is a Chemistry and Public Relations double major from Portsmouth, Virginia. “A mistake I made my freshman year was not tapping into the resources around me,” he says. “Coming out of high school, I thought I had everything figured out, so I didn’t take advantage of a lot of things. Whether that was the tutoring services or even just sitting in the library to do my work instead of my room, I assumed that I could handle things the same way I always did. But college is very different. As I got older, I grew a lot by using what’s available on campus.”\n\nAaron is now the Assistant Resident Director of Evergreen and Magnolia Halls, an Orientation Leader and the President of both the Anime and Improv Clubs.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nLoredonna Fiore, junior public relations and advertising major\n\nPhotography by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\n5 Ways I’ve Gotten Involved on Campus\n\nCollege isn’t complete without getting involved to make campus feel like home. Here are 5 ways Loredonna Fiore, a junior Public Relations and Advertising major, did it.\n\n1. Joining Residential Learning and University Housing (RLUH).\n\nAs a commuter during my freshman year, I didn’t know how to feel more connected to campus. A friend of mine who was an RA asked me to go to an information session to look further into the position. I applied, interviewed and thankfully got the RA position. As a sophomore, I found where I belonged on campus. I got to work with amazing student leaders, supportive professional staff and got to connect with wonderful freshman residents (shoutout to Chestnut Hall Class of 2023). I am now the Assistant Resident Director of Mimosa Hall, and I am learning and growing in this new role alongside my awesome team. RLUH has taught me the power of impact and how each of us can make a difference, big or small.\n\n2. Being an admissions ambassador.\n\nWhen I applied to be an admissions ambassador, I learned so many things about Rowan that made me love it even more. Getting to learn about Rowan’s history, all of the resources we offer and working with the professional staff was an awesome experience. I loved helping prospective students and giving them a glimpse of Rowan.\n\n3. Becoming an Orientation Leader.\n\nUnfortunately, due to Covid-19, I wasn’t able to put all that I learned in PROS training to the test. I am looking forward to doing so next summer (hopefully). From what I did get to experience, I know that I am excited to go back to it. During training, I enjoyed learning about my staff and how we would operate as a team. I can’t wait to get to work with and help freshmen students.\n\n4. Interning with Rowan Blog.\n\nI was able to apply for my internship because of my Introduction to Public Relations professor. Professor Farney would always talk about real-life examples from her work with Rowan Admissions. I reached out to her in the summer to see if there were spaces available on her team, and she welcomed me with open arms. This is an awesome way to get involved on campus — using the connections you form in your classes and seeing them through to opportunities. Now, I get to meet so many great students and faculty members and expand my portfolio every week. Take advantage of these opportunities.\n\n5. Attending Events.\n\nThroughout my college experience so far, I have been able to attend events that make Rown feel like home. I love watching Rowan men’s soccer games and attending the live shows at the Bunce Black Box theatre. I also love going to the events put on by Rowan After Hours and the Student University Programmers. Some of my favorites are the Tuesday movie nights, $10,000 bingo and the food truck festival. You can meet people and have fun with your friend at these free Rowan events.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nLoredonna Fiore, junior public relations and advertising major\n\nPhotography by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\nPsychology Major, Admissions Student Worker Latifah Tilus Tells Us About Work-Life Balance\n\nToday, we speak with Latifah Tilus, a sophomore Psychology major from Hamilton, NJ (Mercer County). She’s an on-campus resident who lives in 220 Rowan Boulevard Apartments and works as an admissions assistant in Rowan’s Admissions office. She tells us more about how she started working for Admissions and how she maintains a work-life balance.\n\n“I like everything about this job! I really love it,” Latifah says. “I enjoy helping people when they’re applying or helping people when they come to the desk. Even though a lot of people aren’t coming in right now because of COVID and everything, I really like helping people out.”\n\nLatifah has worked in the Admissions office for a year. She says she heard about the position from her professor in her Rowan 101 course and decided to apply. Luckily, she got the job and has loved it ever since.\n\n“I feel like this is a great job to have because I’m learning a lot of clerical [skills], and I get experience for any other jobs I would want in the future. I’ve never had a job before this, so I think this is a great first job to get!” Latifah says.\n\nWhen she’s not greeting people at the desk or helping out students with their applications, Latifah answers questions through the chat box on the Admissions site and assists with Rowan’s text system.\n\nWhen asked about the best part of the job, Latifah says: “It’s a pretty easy position to have, as long as you do what you’re supposed to and show up on time! I also really like my coworkers. I don’t see them much because we all have different hours right now, but I really enjoy seeing them.”\n\nLatifah hopes to become a therapist in her post-grad future so she can continue to help others. “I want to help people with their mental health. I’ve been through some stuff, and I want to help people get through things too,” she says.\n\nLatifah left us with some words of advice and why she finds it helpful to have a job while being a student.\n\n“It’s really beneficial to have money while you’re in school. I’m paying off my interest while I’m in school! That’s where my money goes to.”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nPhotography by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\nWhat It’s Like to Go to the Same College as Your Siblings\n\nToday’s story comes from frequent Rowan Blog contributor Julia McAleavey of Monmouth County, NJ. She recently graduated with a bachelor’s in advertising. Julia transferred to Rowan her sophomore year, from Eastern University in Pennsylvania.\n\nCollege is a time where, usually, you live away from your family. You get freedom from your parents, and of course, your brothers and sisters if you have them. Your siblings might be older and left for college before you, or maybe you’re the first one to leave the nest. Either way, I’m sure you’re thinking that being at the same school as them would be a complete nightmare. They would always be bothering you and finding ways to embarrass you in front of your friends. They’d be ratting to you on your parents about stupid stuff. It’s easy to think this way; however, it might not be as bad as you’d think.\n\nMy brother and I are 15 months apart in age, and we both attended Rowan. Even though I’m older, he actually started at Rowan before me. I was at another four-year university that I didn’t like. I decided to transfer at the beginning of my sophomore year, and my mother persuaded me to look at Rowan because of how much my brother loved it. At first, I was hesitant. I thought it would be annoying to go to school with him, and I didn’t want to steal his life, but I went to an open house against my will. I ended up loving it and transferred in the spring.\n\nNaturally, as a new Rowan student, I didn’t have a whole lot of friends at the beginning. I was glad I had my brother to hang out with and show me the ropes. I knew I never was alone, whether it was to go eat, walk to Walgreens or go work out. We swam competitively our whole lives, so he helped me join the Swim Club and introduced me to all of my best friends. Sometimes, I felt like a burden to him, but he didn’t mind at all.\n\nAdditionally, since we didn’t have cars on campus at first, it made it much easier for our parents to pick us up to go home on weekends and for breaks. They were very thankful to not have to drive in two completely different directions like many other parents do.\n\nOnce I got settled and began to make a life for myself at Rowan, my brother and I barely saw each other at all. We had our own friends, school work and activities that we were involved in separately. There were times where I’d even forget that we went to the same school. Rowan is not exactly small, so I wouldn’t just see him on my way to class. Even though we were busy, however, we still saw each other at swim practice and would usually get dinner once a week.\n\nGoing to the same college as your siblings may sound like a drag, but it really isn’t a bad gig. You may think you’re always going to see them and that they’re going to be up in your business, but that really isn’t the case at all. It’s like the best of both worlds: You don’t have to live in the same building as your sibling, but you can still easily hang out a few times a week without getting sick of each other. Our younger cousin ended up joining us at Rowan [my senior] year as well, so it became a whole family affair!\n\nAt the end of the day, when you go to college with your sibling, you’ll have a piece of home away from home right there with you.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory and photos by:\n\nJulia McAleavey, recent advertising graduate\n\nRelated posts:\n\nSiblings At Rowan: Madison and Sophia Agostini\n\nSisters on SGA: Sarah and Madeline McClure\n\nRowan Student Leaders Alexa Bassano, Sydney Ramos and JT Kurtz Share Their Insights\n\nRead firsthand accounts from three Rowan students who talk about the benefits of their on-campus leadership positions.\n\nFirst up is Alexa Bassano, a junior Biological Science major from Brick Township, NJ (Monmouth County). Alexa is a Resident Assistant at Mimosa Hall, a member of Rowan Emergency Medical Services and the Director of Collegiate Alumnae Engagement of Alpha Sigma Tau sorority. She explains: “Each role has benefited me in a different way. Now more than ever, people are thanking me for my service with EMS. As an RA, my residents tell me how much they appreciate me referring them to resources or just showing them where a building is. To me, those little things are just me doing my job, but that gratification reminds me I am a part of something bigger. Being involved and helping people just makes me so happy, whether it comes with a ‘thank you’ or not.”\n\nNext, Sydney Ramos is a junior Human Services major from East Brunswick, NJ (Middlesex County). When talking about her role as a student leader, she shared her experience from the very beginning. “Overall, I have to thank Res Life for making me the leader I am today. As a freshman, I really kept to myself and didn’t explore what options were out there for me. But as soon as I found RLUH, I knew I was where I needed to be: in a family atmosphere with amazing people I really respect.” Sydney is a Resident Assistant at Mimosa Hall and a new member of the United Latinos Association.\n\nJT Kurtz, a senior Computer Science major from Egg Harbor Township, NJ (Atlantic County), is also heavily involved on campus. He is the Assistant Resident Director of Nexus Properties, a learning assistant for the Computer Science department, a researcher in the Psychology department, and a member of the Filipino Club. “In all of my roles, I want to be a valuable resource for the people around me,” he says. “I want to push people to be the best they can be and get them to success. By coming up with innovative ways to work and help others, I get to learn and grow every day.”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nLoredonna Fiore, junior public relations and advertising major\n\nPhotography by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\nAdvice from the Joes of Rowan\n\nTen Joes of different majors and eight counties share their advice for incoming and current Rowan students.\n\n“Study more than you sleep, sleep more than you have fun, and have as much fun as possible.” – Joe Gummere, senior Mechanical Engineering major from Vernon, NJ (Sussex County, pictured above)\n\n“You’re going to fall down. College is humbling for many people, you just have to be willing to accept the lessons you gain and learn from them.” – Joe Frascella, senior Communication Studies major from Hightstown, NJ (Mercer County)\n\n“Don’t over stress but don’t under stress. Take it easy and just get assignments done on time. It also helps immensely to befriend your professor[s].” – Joe Gentempo, senior Art major from Middletown, NJ (Monmouth County)\n\n“Put yourself out there, try something new. I know going in I was really quiet and shy. Then I found the best on-campus job (Rec Center), became a part of a sport club (Ultimate Frisbee) and now I’m president of the organization.” – First-generation college student, Joe D’Intino, junior Chemical Engineering student from Medford, NJ (Burlington County)\n\n“Be open to making new friends at any time and in any place, this will lead you to try new things and join new clubs.” – sophomore Joe Kayal, Civil Engineering major from Mahwah, NJ (Bergen County)\n\n“My advice would be to never compare yourself to anyone and never be discouraged by a missed opportunity. Take your life in college day by day, set goals and never be afraid to lean on your peers/professors for support.” – Joe Sansone, senior Business Management and Marketing major from Howell, NJ (Monmouth County)\n\n“Making friends is scary for EVERYONE. Don’t be afraid to ask to sit with strangers. You may just get a best friend out of it! The advisors at Rowan are invaluable resources. Ask them for information on clubs the campus offers and show up. The busier you are, the better your college experience.” – Joseph Breymeier, MBA student from Mount Laurel, NJ (Burlington County)\n\n“The best thing that you can do is get involved! In spite of the current situation, Rowan is still offering plenty of clubs and activities that are easy to join and give you a great way to meet new friends and feel more comfortable with taking this big step in your life. I was nervous about going to Rowan and not knowing many people, but once I joined the Roller Hockey Club, I felt right at home!” – Joe Carriero, sophomore Finance major from Swedesboro, NJ (Gloucester County)\n\n“Don’t play it safe with choosing your major. I used to be a Bio major because it was the ‘safe’ option. The only problem with that was … I hate biology. I love movies, writing and storytelling. So I picked a major that reflects my passions. When I enter my career field, I’ll get a job that I enjoy, and not just make money at; and if you enjoy your job you’re not really ‘working,’ are you? Do what you love, and good luck, class of 2024.” – First-generation college student Joe Hunt, senior Radio/TV/Film (RTF) major from Audubon, NJ (Camden County)\n\n“Be outgoing and make friends in your major! You will be in the same classes a lot and getting to know them will help with homework, studying and making your classes enjoyable. A friend that I met on my first day at Rowan ended up being my roommate senior year. Maintain a balanced workload by taking an easy or fun class each semester. If you think you are overdoing it, it’s okay to drop a class; summer classes helped me stay on pace.” – M.S. in Computer Science major Joe Hammer from Toms River, NJ (Ocean County)\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nHeader photo: Joe Gummere, senior mechanical engineering major\n\nStory by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\n#PROFspective: English and Computing & Informatics Double Major Chris Finnegan\n\nToday, we speak to rising senior Chris Finnegan. Chris is a double major in English and Computing and Informatics and is an on-campus resident. He’s also an admissions ambassador for Rowan University! Chris tells us more about why he chose Rowan and what a typical on-campus day is like for him.\n\nWhy did you choose your major?\n\nIndecision. My advisors worked with me to find a path for me to pursue all of my personal and academic interests when I couldn’t bring myself to choose just one, which led to me landing a double major in English and Computing & Informatics.\n\nWhy did you choose Rowan?\n\nRowan was the third school that I visited, and as soon as I toured campus I could truly just see myself there. Rowan grants its students nearly full independence from the first day they move in and provides numerous avenues to pursue social and academic extracurriculars at your own pace.\n\nI chose to go to Rowan because I knew they provided the flexibility that I needed to explore many different interests.\n\nTake us through a typical Rowan day for you!\n\nEvery day starts with lots of coffee, but if I’m not giving a daily tour at 11 a.m., you would probably find me getting a breakfast sandwich meal swipe from Peet’s Coffee in the student center. I try to take all my classes in the afternoon so that I can work and study in the morning, and go to Rugby practice and do my homework in the evening. If possible, I will try and eat every meal with friends, classmates, teammates or coworkers.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nPhoto provided by:\n\nChris Finnegan, senior English and computing and informatics major\n\nSophomore Reflects: Musical Theatre and Public Relations Double Major Erica Gerold\n\nMeet sophomore Erica Gerold, a Musical Theatre and Public Relations double major from Philadelphia. She’s also an on-campus resident who resided in Magnolia Hall this past year. Erica tells us more about what she enjoyed most about her first year at Rowan and shares advice for future freshmen.\n\nWhat did you most enjoy your freshman year at Rowan?\n\nSomething I enjoyed most here at Rowan were the amount of on-campus artistic opportunities I was able to have as a freshman! This past year I have been in directing scenes, written/done voiceover work at the art exhibit, “The Sister Chapel,” performed in our annual Holiday Celebration, “The Vagina Monologues,” devised cabaret “(di$) conn3cT*d” and “Urinetown: The Musical.” I have made amazing friends through our college and learned so much through its chances to create. I truly do not think I would be happier anywhere else.\n\nCould you share with us one happy moment you had with friends, professors or other members of the Rowan community that made you realize Rowan felt like “home”?\n\nAmong many things I am beyond grateful to have been involved in this school year, the first that made me feel at home was rehearsing “(di$) conn3cT*d.” I was cast within my first month of moving to college when unfamiliarity was around every corner. Right away not only were the cast/creative team eager to hear the ideas of us freshmen, they were eager to make us feel welcome. I became so close with the people involved with that production, including my new best friend Elliot Colahan. The support the people of Rowan (my profs and classmates alike) have for us is nothing like I have seen anywhere else. Especially as a freshman, their care for me and the rest of my peers filled me with motivation and happiness. They make me feel lucky to be a part of this community.\n\nWhat advice do you have for future freshmen looking at colleges right now?\n\nShadow! Leading up to College Decision Day, I actually had my mind set on committing to a different school. Once your choices are narrowed down, seeing a day in the life of your options really puts things into perspective. Once I shadowed my now dear friend Marisa Pelikan, the decision could not have been clearer that Rowan was the right fit for me (note: If you cannot shadow due to COVID-19, research schools to the best of your online abilities. Also, do not be afraid to reach out to their current students/profs!).\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nI am most looking forward to honing my skills as a double major! I currently combine my passions of PR and theatre as a member of the social media team for RUTD, a publicity officer for our Lab Theatre organization and the creator/writer for my school blog highlighting the Rowan University Department of Theatre & Dance, RUTDInsider. All of that being said, Public Relations students typically do not start taking major-based classes until their sophomore year. This fall I will be taking three of those classes and I am super excited to put all forthcoming knowledge into my current projects. I will be the first to admit learning/creating in the upcoming school year will be difficult due to the coronavirus, but I hope to push forward in making it happen any way I can.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nPhotos provided by:\n\nErica Gerold\n\nJunior Major Moments: Law and Justice Major Nicolette Salzano\n\nToday we feature Law and Justice major and Psychology minor Nicolette Salzano.

She makes our classes engaging and interesting for each student and has worked closely with me to help me achieve success in the field.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nThe most interesting thing I have learned in my major this year is how many vast options of work are available to me. Being a Law and Justice major, the opportunities are endless in the field. It is great to know I will always have something interesting going on in my everyday work life.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nI am a member of the Alpha Epsilon Phi Sorority, Phi Kappa chapter here at Rowan.

Everyone within RLUH has made me feel like family, and it was definitely one of the best decisions I have made so far in my college career.\n\nCould you share a moment you’ve experienced in which you have felt that Rowan is a welcoming environment for you?\n\nI think Rowan being a welcoming environment started with orientation, along with the PROS and other orientation staff who made that experience possible. I met people who immediately made me feel welcome and am still friends with today.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing about one typical day at Rowan for you?\n\nMy favorite thing about one typical day at Rowan is being able to see my friends.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan that was a happy surprise for you?\n\nOne thing about Rowan that was a happy surprise for me was how active campus was along with how many events are put on throughout the semesters.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve shared with a professor or staff member in which you felt like they truly cared about your well-being.\n\nI was a sophomore and concerned about my academic success as well as my choice of major.

I first met him my freshman year when I started as an intern working for him, and he’s been a huge mentor for me ever since.\n\nIn summer 2019, Dr. Manning led the Rowan Study Abroad trip on Holocaust Memory, which I was on. One day, Dr. Manning was chatting with me and a couple of other students on the trip, and he jokingly said, “Just so you all know, Alex is my favorite student.”\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting ​thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nI guess I would have to say the most amazing thing I’ve learned this year was meeting [Canadian military officer] General Romeo Dallaire when he came to give the annual CHSS Lecture. I was volunteering to help set up the event and got the chance to meet him before his speech. I really admired his work as a peacekeeping leader in Rwanda and as an advocate for human rights.\n\nWhen I asked him how he handled all the indifference, ignorance and extremism he’d seen throughout his career, his answer was pretty simple, but also very powerful. He just said, “Don’t blink, stand your ground, young man.”\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nI think my time interning for the Rowan Center for the Study of Holocaust, Genocide and Human Rights (RCHGHR) was one of the greatest experiences in pre-professional growth I’ve been lucky to have. I applied and got accepted into this internship through the CHSSMatch program. In addition to that internship, I serve as treasurer for the RCHGHR Student Association and am now also starting out as Secretary for the College Democrats at Rowan and Multimedia Editor for The Whit.\n\nAll these experiences have helped me work toward personal and professional goals that I feel passionate about in areas like photography and human rights awareness.

She lives on-campus in Whitney Center. Bianca writes: “Going to college has helped me get out of my comfort zone and has helped me become a much more well-rounded individual! I know that adjusting to college can be tough — especially if you’re living with other people who you’ve never lived with before.”\n\nA big part of college life is living with roommates. At times, it can be great! Other times, it can be hard, especially when you’re new to college life and living with someone else in the same room! Here are some tips to help you adjust to living with a roommate.\n\n(1) Communication is key.\n\nWhen it comes to our living habits, everybody’s “comfortable” looks different. When living with someone in close quarters, it’s really important to communicate with each other! Make sure you set some ground rules and figure out compromises. Make sure you’re on the same page as your roommate. If something is bothering you, bring it up in a civil way and try to work it out! Most of the time, roommate issues can be solved by good communication.\n\n(2) Be considerate of each other’s space/belongings.\n\nIt’s important to remember that you’re living with another person. Whether it’s in the same room or in the same apartment, it’s a good idea to share the space equally! Keep it tidy so you don’t start intruding on their side of the room or the common area. It’s also a good idea to ask your roommate before using something of theirs or when you are thinking of bringing guests over. Don’t assume just because you’re living in the same room or apartment that it’s ok. Always ask!\n\n(3) Know each other’s schedules.\n\nIt’s always good to know each other’s schedules. This is because you don’t want to bother or wake each other up if you have an early class or call them if they’re busy, in class or at a club meeting. Knowing schedules will help in being considerate and respectful of each other.\n\n(4) Get to know your roommate.\n\nOf course, try to talk to your roommate! It’s important not to write someone off right away. Especially if it’s the first time either of you is living with each other. They could be just as nervous as you are! Getting to know your roommate can lead to a better relationship and you might even make a really great friend!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nJulia’s Corner: Finding the Right Major\n\nRecent grad Julia McAleavey shares guidance through this advice column for incoming students. A student with well-rounded experience, Julia earned a bachelor’s in advertising this spring. She transferred to Rowan her sophomore year, after another school wasn’t a great fit. While at Rowan she started as an exploratory studies major, unsure of what to major in. She’s lived both on campus and off campus, held student worker jobs and internships, and participated in clubs and sports.\n\nCollege is that pathway to the career of your dreams. For many people the hardest part is figuring out what you want to study and what field you want to work in. There are few students who know what they want to study when they are first-year students, and many who think they know end up changing it later. Don’t stress, there are resources to help you find out what you want to do.\n\nDo not worry about it freshman year: You may think it is now or never as an incoming freshman, but you actually have a lot of time to choose. I did not declare a major until the second half of sophomore year and I am scheduled to graduate on time. Plus, I got all of my general education requirements out of the way early on and since I took my time choosing a major, I ended up finding something I really like. Going in as undecided is nothing to be ashamed of. It will give you the chance to get the general requirements over with, as well as figure out what you’re truly passionate about.\n\nEliminate what you do not like: General class requirements cover a variety of topics. As a result, you gain a better understanding of what you like and do not like. For example, after taking college level math and science, I knew those subjects were not for me. Therefore, I knew that majors that were heavy in those topics would probably not be a good fit for me. Figuring out what you don’t like is a great step to finding what you want to study.\n\nMake a list of what you do like: Once you eliminate what you don’t like, you should make a list of subjects you do like. Try to imagine yourself doing certain things with those subjects. I When I chose to major in advertising, it was because I knew I wanted a career where I could make a good living and be creative all in one. I knew I wanted something business-like too. Being that math is not my strong suit and advertising is instead part of the College of Communication & Creative Arts, I knew it was the right fit for me. Process of elimination really works, but you do not have to rush into it as a freshman. Take your time figuring it out and see everything Rowan has to offer.\n\nTalk to your advisor for guidance: Advisors are here to help you succeed! Use your resources around you. Academic advisors and professors can tell you about all of the programs Rowan has so you can pick the best major suited for you. Additionally, and I know this sounds cliche, but talk to your parents and peers. My dad advised me to go into advertising from the beginning of my college career. At first, I thought it was a stupid idea, but he ended up being right!\n\nChoosing what to study in college is a big decision. It will determine your career path for the rest of your life. Just remember that you have time! Only declare a major once you looked into it enough that you know it what you’re most passionate about.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nJulia McAleavey, advertising graduate\n\nRA and Psychology Major Jeremiah Garcia Gives 5 Pieces of Advice To Incoming Freshmen\n\nThird-year Psychology major and Urban Studies minor Jeremiah Garcia recently spoke with Rowan Blog about his freshman year experience. Today, the first-generation college student from Camden, NJ (Camden County) residence assistant (RA) offers his tips to new students.\n\n1. When you come to Rowan, make mistakes and learn from them.\n\n2. Recognize that you’re not alone. You get to meet new people with the same goals but different purposes.\n\n3. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when things are hard. During my freshman year, I felt like nobody was there, especially as a first-generation college student, and I blocked myself into a box. I realized there are resources but I was afraid to ask for help. I had a rough start, and I thought that I needed to learn everything myself. Know that it is okay not to be perfect. There are always people with knowledge that you don’t have, and they can help you. The resources Rowan has helped physically and mentally, not just academically. The Wellness Center and Rec Center are great resources too.\n\n4. Step outside of your comfort zone and be the best version of yourself. Being involved helped me to step outside of my comfort zone. Getting involved helped me built confidence and leadership.\n\n5. Don’t beat yourself up if your major isn’t right for you. I wanted to go into the medical field, but I wasn’t passionate about it. I took other opportunities and decided to switch my major to Psychology.

I’m a member of the National Wellness Institute (NWI) (Rowan Student Chapter) and the Student Council for Exceptional Children (SCEC).\n\nI am also part of the Get Fit program that the Health and Exercise department manages. Get Fit is a program where we help people with intellectual and learning disabilities and work with them to benefit their health. It is such a rewarding experience. I look forward to this every day of the week.\n\nI am usually quite occupied on campus. When you get involved in stuff, you will never be bored, every day will be a new adventure.\n\nWhere to go when you first arrive on campus. When I first came to Rowan, I had no friends. The Chamberlain Student Center is a great place to meet people. Try to have a friend in every class so you have an additional resource other than the professor.\n\nRowan After Hours (RAH) is how I made most of my friends. Rowan After Hours has night activities every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night. Activities include cooking, arts and crafts, dancing and a food bar. Sometimes we play video games too. It is really fun, and it is such an easy and cool way to meet new people. Definitely, go to RAH!!\n\nCheck out Rowan Boulevard! They have delicious restaurants and really cool places to visit. There are a lot of jobs on Rowan Boulevard as well. It is a really cool place to spend your time.\n\nThe Rec Center has something for everyone. Yoga, Zumba, Pilates, you name it! They got it! I go to yoga there once in a while, and they have so many different levels and types of yoga. I go to beginner yoga and it is so calming. It releases so much stress for me. Definitely go to the Rec Center when you have a chance!\n\nAdvice for choosing a major: It’s okay to be undecided (Exploratory Studies) when you go to college! Rowan gives you a chance to explore and find what you’re good at. Always consult with your advisor before choosing a major. They can help you narrow down your choices.\n\nMoving in tips (do’s and don’ts): Moving into campus can be confusing, here is what to bring and what not to bring.\n\nEnough clothes.\n\nHygiene products.\n\nDecorations to spruce up that room.\n\nShoes, of course.\n\nAnd some coats, for the chilly days.\n\nThese five things are mandatory to bring on campus — most importantly, shower shoes!\n\nWhat not to bring:\n\nCandles, because they can set off fire alarms.\n\nNot too many bags, they can cause clutter.\n\nFive reasons why I love Rowan:\n\nThe people\n\nThe buildings\n\nDiversity\n\nKindness\n\nFriends\n\nI chose Rowan because not only was it a great fit for me, but it was a great experience being a freshman! I hope incoming freshmen have such a wonderful experience, too. Rowan had everything I was looking for and more. I cannot wait to go back and start a new chapter as a sophomore.\n\nEnjoy campus as much as you can!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory and photos by:\n\nNavya Kunigal, rising sophomore community health major\n\nOrganized by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nStudent Life\n\n10 Inclusive Clubs at Rowan University\n\nLooking for a safe space or ways to connect with others on campus?

Callie is an off-campus resident from Little Egg Harbor, NJ (Ocean County). Callie is a first-generation college student.\n\n​On your busiest day, what academic, non-academic, and social responsibilities are you juggling?\n\nOn my busiest day, I usually have two classes I have to attend, then I usually spend the bulk of my day in Savitz Hall in the Admissions Office either doing office work or giving tours at the Welcome Center, then I will usually attend an event my sorority would be hosting or compete in an intramural game, and finally, I usually get dinner with my friends. To end the day, I will go to the library for an hour or two to finish up on some homework.\n\nDid you ever have a moment of uncertainty within your major? How did you get through the challenge?\n\nI never had a moment of uncertainty within my major. I was very stressed about what I would do with my Psychology degree. Until last year, I had no idea. Then one of my professors introduced me to Applied Behavior Analysis. After hearing about it, I knew that is exactly what I wanted to do. Now, I am applying to graduate school to receive my Masters in Applied Behavior Analysis.\n\nTell us about one moment that made you feel like Rowan was the right fit for you.\n\nI knew Rowan was the right fit for me when I took a tour of the campus. My tour guide was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all my questions. I was very interested in a lot of the clubs my tour guide mentioned as well. As soon as I got to campus, I got heavily involved and through my involvement, Rowan became my second home.\n\nTell us about your transition into college and how you pushed through any challenges.\n\nCollege was not an easy transition for me. I was a homebody in high school, so leaving my family was very hard. I won’t lie, the first few weeks were hard. But once I got involved, and started to meet new friends, I didn’t want to leave campus. Since I forced myself to go outside my comfort zone, it helped me to feel more at home and more comfortable at Rowan.\n\nWhat advice would you give your high school self about choosing a college?\n\nThe advice I would give my high school self would be to choose the college that feels like home once you step on campus, that has a ton of internships and opportunities for me, and the college that has a lot of extracurricular clubs and organizations I would love to join.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nStudent Life\n\nProf Style: Mask Up!\n\n“This mask is better than other brands.

She gets shipments with masks in a variety […]\n\n#PROFspective: Meet Japanese Culture-Enthusiast, History and International Studies Major Sean French\n\nToday, we speak to Sean French, a senior History and International Studies dual major from Haddon Township (Camden County). Sean, a commuter and first-generation student, holds a leadership position in Rowan’s Japanese Culture Club. He tells us more about the club, his majors and why he chose Rowan!\n\nWhy did you choose your majors?\n\nI’ve loved history since elementary school, so it made sense to study what I loved. I was originally enrolled as a History and Education major to teach history at the high school level. During my sophomore year, however, I decided to change to History and International Studies (Asia studies concentration) after falling in love with Japanese culture and decided to study abroad in Japan.\n\nWhy did you choose Rowan?\n\nI chose Rowan because it was known for having a robust Education department, in state and nearby, so I could commute to school!\n\nTake us through a typical Rowan day for you!\n\nThe typical Rowan day for me (pre-Covid) was waking up at 6 a.m., going to the gym near my house, making breakfast, then going down to campus to study at the library or go to class. Then, later in the day, I would go to an e-board meeting for the Japanese Culture Club (I was previously VP and will be President beginning Fall 2020).\n\nAt our meetings we would talk about Japanese culture, have activities and games such as karaoke, a bento box competition and arts nights including calligraphy and making origami.\n\nThe Japanese Culture Club is a place we’ve worked to make welcoming and open to folks of all backgrounds, where you could hang out with friends and enjoy learning and talking about all things Japan. We’re hoping to continue club meetings this coming semester, be that online or safely in person.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, rising senior music industry major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nSean French\n\nHeader photo courtesy of:\n\nUnsplash\n\nStudent Life\n\n5 Things I Learned My Freshman Year\n\nToday we feature Ashley Chan, sophomore Communication Studies major from West Windsor, NJ (Mercer County). Ashley reflects on five major lessons she’s learned during her first year at Rowan.\n\nStay Organized\n\nIt’s important to stay organized as a college student. Forgetting to submit an assignment might show your professor you’re either unprepared or don’t care. However, writing down to-dos and important dates in an agenda, you’ll be on track with everything that needs to be done.\n\nJoin Clubs and Associations\n\nJoining different clubs and associations will not only allow you to meet more people, but it will also acclimate you to Rowan. Last year, I was on the Hall Council E-Board and Communication Studies Club, which was a great way to bond with fellow residents and people within my major!\n\nStudy the Map\n\nGetting lost on campus happens to all of us at one point. Make sure to look over your schedule and find the location of each class before the semester begins, so you don’t get lost on the first day.\n\nTime Management\n\nFrom classes, clubs, to meals, almost every day will be pretty hectic. Scheduling everything out based on the hour will keep you even more organized and will also allow you to make time for yourself. Me-time is just as important!\n\nTextbooks\n\nWait until you receive the syllabus before purchasing/renting a book; you don’t want to end up with a textbook to find out it’s the wrong one! Also, try comparing prices to find the best deal. I tend to rent my books from Barnes & Noble on-campus since it has textbooks for every class and it’s convenient to return them at the end of the semester.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory and photos by:\n\nAshley Chan, rising sophomore communication studies major\n\nSophomore Reflects: Monica Torres Shares Her Freshman Experience and Advice\n\nToday we feature rising sophomore Monica A. Torres. Monica is a Computer Science major with a concentration in Software Engineering from Jersey City, NJ (Hudson County). Monica is an on-campus resident. She lived in Evergreen Hall during her freshman year, and now will be living in the Edgewood Park Apartments for her sophomore year. Monica is a first-generation college student.\n\nWhat did you most enjoy during your freshman year at Rowan?\n\nThe thing I enjoyed the most was getting a feel for everything. There are a lot of activities set up for freshmen not only for them to have fun, but for them to get a feel for the campus. One, for example, is Welcome Week, where many students from all grades come together to enjoy each other’s company and welcome the freshman and new transfer students to campus. I enjoyed meeting new people and seeing that Rowan is very diverse.\n\nCould you share a happy moment you had with friends, professors, or other members of the Rowan community that made you realize Rowan felt like home?\n\nOne of my favorite memories was getting to know my roommate. We were familiar with each other through PCI (Pre-College Institute), aka EOF (Educational Opportunity Fund), over the summer, but we didn’t really talk. However, once I got to know her, we had a lot in common, and exploring campus with her was fun. I’m from Jersey City, so to have someone who is from South Jersey as a close friend is great, because we get to compare North Jersey and South Jersey.\n\nWhat advice do you have for future freshmen looking at colleges right now?\n\nMy advice to future freshmen is that it isn’t about getting a good grade, it’s about understanding the material for your major. In addition, it’s okay to not know what you wanna study right off the bat because that is what advisors are for. They are there to help you explore and find a major that suits you.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nI can’t wait for some of my friends from home to come to Rowan. I can show them around and help them get around. Plus, it means the friend group on campus gets bigger. It will be nice to have a few familiar faces from home on campus, to be honest, because I won’t be as homesick.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nStudent Life\n\nAdvice For Living With Roommates\n\nToday’s story is from Melanie Sbaraglio, a recent Public Relations and Advertising graduate from Nutley, NJ (Essex County). Melanie joined the Rowan Blog team to wrap up her remaining internship hours, after her internship with Ace Screen Printing in Glassboro was cut short due to COVID-19 affecting business.\n\nSince I’ve lived with roommates for all four years of college, I feel like I experienced a lot. There are going to be times when you feel like it’s the greatest thing in the world and then other times when you want to pull your hair out. However, I am lucky enough that I am best friends with my roommates, so even when conflict arises it is usually something we eventually laugh about.\n\nOne of my first tips is to be prepared for a lot of sharing. Especially if you’re the roommate who has the best clothes. In my case I am that roommate. I didn’t think I would be the one that everyone wants to borrow from but my closet gets raided by at least two roommates whenever we are getting ready to go out. The important thing to remember here is to have patience and to keep track of who takes what.\n\nNext, make sure that everyone does their part when it comes to cleaning up after themselves. My roommates and I developed a weekly chore list and everyone gets a task for the week. For example, taking out the trash, cleaning the floors or cleaning the bathrooms. Although we still argue at times when the kitchen is left a mess or the drain gets clogged this where more patience comes in because with six people in one house messes are for sure going to pile up.\n\nAnother pro tip is to have house meetings. With six girls living together who are all very vocal with their opinions it is important to get everything out in the open at one time. No one likes having conflict in their house especially when it’s the place you come home to after a long day of classes or other activities.\n\nMy last tip is something that I have realized over the years. Don’t sweat the small stuff because this is a time of life where you’re supposed to be having fun and enjoying your time with the people around you. Sometimes my roommates will walk downstairs with my clothes on and say, “Oh by the way I’m gonna borrow this.” Other times we argue over things like who left all the lights on or who let their garbage pile up without taking it outside. In reality these things are small issues that can be easily talked out.\n\nI have become the type of person who lets a lot of things slide without saying anything because I think about whether it’s really something that bothers me in the long run and usually the answer is no. I think this can be good to an extent but if something is really getting on your nerves don’t let it keep happening; otherwise, you’re going to let it all build up and just explode one day. Talk things out, keep yourself grounded and remember the important thing is to enjoy your time living with your best friends while you can.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMelanie Sbaraglio, senior public relations and advertising graduate\n\nJunior Major Moments: Construction Management Major Kemet Rose\n\nToday we feature online student Kemet Rose, a Construction Management major from Ridgefield Park, NJ (Bergen County). Kemet is a second-generation college student who transferred from Eastern Gateway Community College and William Paterson University.\n\nCould you share your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nI don’t have many experiences with faculty [yet] considering I an online student only. The most inspiring visionary related to the construction field right now is Elon Musk. He is changing the world with his new solar technology in addition to many other things like his tunnel project.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nUntil now I was always ignorant of how long construction as an industry has been around and how important it is to society.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nI don’t have any pre-professional experiences that relate directly to my growth in Construction Management. I would consider all of my experiences up to this point as supporting my ability to grow.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nHeader photo courtesy of:\n\nPexels\n\nRA and Psychology Major Jeremiah Garcia Reflects on His Experience as a Rowan Freshman\n\nToday we feature third-year Psychology major and Urban Studies minor Jeremiah Garcia. Jeremiah is a first-generation college student from Camden, NJ (Camden County). Jeremiah is also a Residence Assistant (RA) in Evergreen Hall.\n\nHow does being involved on campus impact your college experience?\n\nI am an RA and I am involved in the Minority Association of Premedical Students (MAPS), and the Residence Hall Association (RHA). I was able to step outside of my comfort zone, learn leadership and confidence, and feel like I have my voice heard. As an RA I help incoming freshmen with things I had a hard time with. This has made me a better person and made me not afraid to use my voice.\n\nHow were you able to make friends on campus?\n\nI made friends by going to the Rec Center. I was able to get my mind right at the Rec Center when things got hard and I met people there. I also met people at events, Rowan After Hours (RAH) and classes. Freshman year was competitive, but you have to be a leader in class and make study groups or say that you should get lunch together. It depends on the class, though. Some are more group-oriented than others.\n\nHow were you able to adjust to campus life?\n\nI was able to adjust by getting help and using Rowan’s resources. Putting myself out there was the best way to adjust. It gave me confidence and a push to succeed.\n\nWhat does inclusivity mean to you?\n\nSome people are different, and it is important to have inclusivity so that people can make new friends and have the same opportunities as everyone else regardless of race, gender and appearance.\n\nDo you think that Rowan is inclusive?\n\nYes. Everyone has the opportunity to be in leadership positions, they just need to do well academically and have the confidence to earn the positions. Rowan is inclusive.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to next year?\n\nBeing on campus. I miss campus. I am also excited to get into new opportunities. I would like to try out for the baseball team and to get into an honors society. It will be my second year as an RA and I am looking forward to the experience. I am also looking forward to taking new classes, doing well in my major and getting better grades.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nAdvice From An RA\n\nMeet Loredonna Fiore, junior Public Relations and Advertising double major with a minor in Communication Studies from Elk Township, NJ (Gloucester County). Loredonna was a Resident Assistant (RA) for Chestnut Hall this past year until COVID-19 shut down campus. She looks forward to being the Assistant Resident Director (ARD) of Mimosa Hall in the fall and shares how RA’s help students comfortably transition into college life.\n\nNew room, new roommate, new classes, new life! These are the paramount changes that people living on Rowan’s campus undergo when transitioning through college.\n\nTo help with life in a residence hall, your resident assistant can be a major resource for you.\n\nTo begin, resident assistants are required to host at least 5 events that residents can attend on various campus locations. The first event type is a community builder. Community building programs happen within the residence hall and are meant to unify the members of a floor/residence hall as a whole. Whether it is a gaming tournament, a self-care night, or a DIY craft party, community builders are designed to be social and fun for members of the hall.\n\nThe other event type is the Campus Community Connection programs. These programs are made in an effort to unify the students with the greater Rowan community by exposing them to Rowan-run activities or resources around campus. These include meditation classes, career fairs or even a 10,000 bingo night.\n\nAlong with programming, resident assistants are available for the students they serve on a deeper level. Once a semester, resident assistants conduct a one-on-one meeting with students. During these meetings, students will be able to discuss academics, involvement, the environment in the residence halls, overall emotional/mental health, and any other concerns the student may have. Resident assistants have a list of resources available to help direct students not only during one-on-one meetings, but at any point throughout the semester as well.\n\nCommunity meetings will also be hosted throughout the year to stimulate an ongoing conversation among residents to ensure their health, happiness, and safety. During these meetings, there will be discussions about residence hall policy, fun happenings around Rowan (programs, athletic events, live shows), and different suggestions about how students can live in harmony in a residence hall.\n\nYour resident assistant is basically a built-in support system and friend that Rowan gives each student. They are trained for weeks in the summer to effectively handle all different situations and to advocate for the needs of all residents. During move-in week, stop by to see your RA and begin to develop a relationship with them. As an RA, I can promise they will be delighted to meet you and get to know you throughout the school year.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nLoredonna Fiore, junior public relations and advertising double major\n\nRowan Commuters: Kayla Santiago [VIDEO]\n\nWelcome to our new “Rowan Commuter” series, where we take an inside look at the lives and experiences of Rowan University commuters and how their overall college experience is without living on campus.\n\nIn this video, Edelman College of Communication and Creative Arts double-major Kayla Santiago talks about how she balances a busy schedule with being a commuter student here at Rowan.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nVideo by:\n\nTom Copsetta, radio/TV/film graduate\n\nJunior Major Moments: Law and Justice Major, Track and Field Captain Francis Terry\n\nToday we feature Francis Terry, a Law and Justice Studies major from Laurel Springs, NJ (Camden County) who recently completed his junior year at Rowan. Francis, a first-generation college student, is a transfer student from Neumann University and lives off-campus.\n\nCould you share your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nMy favorite moment with a faculty member was with my coaches on March 15, 2018 in Birmingham, Alabama at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships. I finished 5th in the nation and earned my first All-American accolade. When they called my name I stepped on the podium and looked at the cameras, the crowd and my teammates cheering for me. My assistant coach, Coach Tate, handed me the medal. I remember hugging Coach Tate thanking him for everything he’s done for me.\n\nWe took our picture and I had to get my pants and jacket back on and cool down because I had another race in about 2 hours. The 4×400 was the last event of the day and we finished 3rd in the 4×400. That placement would place us 3rd in the nation as a team. So after I hugged my teammates and congratulated the other teams I got back on the podium. When I got off the podium I saw my Head Coach, Coach Dimit, crying tears of joy so we hugged. We were all so excited to be ranked 3rd in the nation as a team. No, we didn’t win the National Championship, but we were all still proud of every single one of our teammates.\n\nIs there anyone who is a visionary in your field who inspires you and goes above and beyond for you? I wouldn’t say he’s a visionary in my field, but someone who has impacted me tremendously at Rowan University is Eddy. He’s one of the janitors at Rowan University in Esby Gym [editor’s note: this staff member was identified as Edward Garrison, senior maintenance worker for both Esby Gym and The John Green Team House]. Eddy is one of the loudest, but also down-to-earth men I have ever met. Every time I walk into Esby Gym I can just feel his presence. He always screams “Yo Francis,” then shakes my hand and asks how my day is going. Some days we just stand in the hall and talk about sports, life, or anything on our minds that day.\n\nNo matter what, Eddy always makes time to say “Hi” to someone. He’s one of the hardest-working guys I know, and his attitude is always upbeat no matter what. I may not want to be a janitor in my lifetime, but I want to mimic the way he looks at life — his demeanor, work ethic, attitude and just his everyday life of bringing happiness to others. Eddy is one most influential people I’ve encountered throughout my life. Every day I’m blessed to have met a man like Eddy and have him to help shape me for the future.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting ​thing you’ve learned in your major this year? The most amazing thing I’ve learned in my major this year was in my Law Seminar Class with Professor Stone. Even though the majority of the class was taught online due to COVID, this class really opened my eyes. During the course of the semester, we had to use an Excel spreadsheet and take our 40 questions and ask every student who was enrolled in that class questions about their family life. We then had to compare all of our work and compare it to our thesis. We wrote about a 10-page paper on our thesis and results that we calculated throughout the semester. It was an awesome experience working with classmates and developing our own short theory.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth? Due to COVID, I had one internship canceled, but two pre-professional experiences I have had would be being a Team Captain for the Men’s Track and Field team and working on the Board for S.A.A.C (Student-Athlete Advisory Committee). Being one of the Captains in the team I’ve definitely had to look at myself differently. Over the past 4 years at Neumann and Rowan, I’ve had many people to look up to and follow. Jeffery Tucker was one of the Captains in 2018, and he’s played a huge role in my life on and off the track.\n\nBeing a captain you’re held to a higher standard. As a captain, I’ve been in difficult situations with my own teammates but we’ve worked past them together. I always try and make myself available for my teammates or even other student-athletes. We all have stuff going on in our lives and every day I’ve learned something new from being around other student-athletes. When you’re around 70+ teammates and being one of the leaders of the team it gets very stressful. Being a captain doesn’t make me higher than anyone else, we are all still on the same team representing the same school and athletic department. I strive to represent myself in the best way possible in the classroom, on the track and even within the community. I hope that I can impact someone’s life for the better the way Jeff did for me.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nPassing the Torch: Psychology Major, Academic Coach Shares Her Parting Tips for Success\n\n“Take advantage of every opportunity in the Psychology department. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when needed, too,” says Chelsey Fitton from Woodstown, NJ (Salem County), who recently earned her Psychology degree.\n\n“I found the faculty and staff to be super helpful within the (Psychology) department. And it’s a family. The professors don’t really see you as a number, they know you by name. When I’d go in, they’d say, ‘Hi, Chelsey, how are you doing?’ That’s important, too,” she explains.\n\nChelsey, who transferred from Rowan College of South Jersey and commuted to campus, says to “stay involved as much as possible.” She was part of the honors society Delta Alpha Pi, for individuals with learning disabilities, and worked on campus as an academic coach with the Academic Success Center. Chelsey knows her future path will involve helping others.\n\n“I really enjoy working with people,” she says. “And even during this COVID situation, I’m finding I’m not a fan of isolating. I have to be around people.”\n\nReady to move forward, Chelsey couldn’t forget a few people who helped her along the way.\n\n“I’d like to thank my professors and my family for all their support because I definitely wouldn’t be where I am with a degree without them.”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStudent Life\n\nHow I Made Friends at Rowan\n\nToday’s story is from Devon Graf, a recent Communications Studies graduate from Camden County, NJ. Devon joined the Rowan Blog team to wrap up her remaining internship hours, after her internship with Enchanted Celebrations was cut short prematurely due to COVID-19 affecting business.\n\nSome incoming college students may wonder: How am I going to make friends? It’s one of the highest worries around. Incoming students may be used to having all of their home town friends that they went to school with for many years, and now everyone is splitting up to go away to different universities.\n\nMy incoming freshman year I joined a Rowan Students Facebook group. I think that was my best decision. After going to Rowan’s open house and being put into groups that we did activities with, I met a couple of students, and we switched telephone numbers. After that, they added me to this Facebook group that had hundreds of incoming freshman. By reaching out and posting in this page and connecting on different social media platforms, I was able to get into touch and build relationships even before the semester started.\n\nWell, it didn’t end there! Once the semester progressed I joined a lot of clubs. Rowan offers a numerous amount of clubs where you can team bond, socialize and participate in different activities. My favorite club I joined was Volunteer Club. With doing this, I ended up being a tutor at South Woods State Prison and met a couple of friends I still have close friendships with today.\n\nRowan After Hours was also a great opportunity to make friends. The wonderful thing about that would be going with the friends I had, and meeting new ones! So the group friendship expanded. RAH would hold fun nights such as BINGO night or movie night. So my college experience didn’t always have to be about going out to parties every night and trying to socialize that way.\n\nAlthough, going out was also a fun way to make friends. Rush sorority events were a great way to socialize, meet new people and personalities. I remember meeting girls from towns over, and states over. I met my roommates from doing this.\n\nWhether you’re worried about meeting friends, or nervous to go out and socialize, don’t be. You’re not the only one in the same boat. I was nervous myself, and so were the girls I’m best friends with today. It just takes a little courage and a positive attitude.\n\nBe yourself! Join groups and clubs, participate in activities at Rowan, and you will have a great time meeting your friend group.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory and photos by:\n\nDevon Graf, communication studies graduate\n\nJunior Major Moments: Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management Major Connor Crafton-Tempel\n\nToday we feature Disaster Preparedness and Management major Connor Crafton-Tempel from Freehold, NJ (Monmouth County). Connor is a transfer student and commutes to campus.\n\nCould you share your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nProfessor Carty, who taught my Disaster Planning, Mitigation, and Recovery course at our Camden campus, was a really big influence on me. When I first came into the program, I knew I wanted to work for the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management (OEM), but I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do with the OEM.\n\nThen, Professor Carty was teaching us about threat and risk assessments, just before the COVID-19 outbreak turned into a pandemic. It was during her class that I realized I wanted to go into disaster planning and specially work on disease-related disasters (mainly epidemics and pandemics).\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting ​thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nI think that the most interesting thing I learned this year was how to perform a threat assessment. This is becoming really helpful, since my parish has asked me to help with the reopening.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nI’d have to say my honor society (Epsilon Pi Phi, the DPEM honor society) and Rowan University EMS. Rowan EMS is helping me gain new skills as an EMT, and the honor society is beneficial for getting connections within the industry.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\n#MeetRowan2024: Multi-talented Marketing Major Megan Steckler\n\nToday we feature future freshman and Marketing major Megan Steckler from Mullica Hill, NJ (Gloucester County). Megan is excited to be commuting to Rowan in the fall.\n\nWhat is something you’re looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nAlthough this may sound cliche, I am looking forward to taking classes, meeting new people and experiencing the college life.\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan?\n\nIn high school, I played field hockey, lacrosse, and I swam. Hopefully, I will continue to play lacrosse. I also want to continue participating in Key Club, or another volunteer-oriented club, and Distributive Education Clubs of America (DECA) at Rowan.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?​\n\nIn high school, I was part of a specialized program called the Business Leadership Academy (BLA). It is a business-oriented curriculum that I found challenging and a lot of fun!\n\nI like business because it is such a versatile subject. One of my favorite classes in the BLA at Kingsway High School was my marketing class. I love the creative side of business, and I want to continue to explore that part specifically in college.\n\nHow did you get to know campus?\n\nI live close to Rowan, I attended Rowan’s Think Like an Entrepreneur camp last summer, and my older sister attends Rowan now. So, even though I have never received an “official” tour, I am already very familiar with the campus.\n\nWhat music do you like?\n\nI love pop, rock and alternative music.\n\nNight owl or morning person?\n\nI am definitely a night owl!\n\nWhy Rowan?​​\n\nRowan is a really good school, it is close to home, and I was fortunate to receive a Merit Scholarship. Also, the school is still growing, the campus is expanding, and I can’t wait to get started! I am excited about all of the opportunities at Rowan!
