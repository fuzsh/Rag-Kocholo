        "text": "From the Jazz Programmers (radio) List comes this sad news. Condolences to\n\nJoe (a list member) and to Phil's friends and family,\n\nEd\n\nVeteran saxist Philip \"Phil\" Urso\n\nBorn: Oct 02, 1925 in Jersey City, New Jersey\n\nDied: April 7th, 2008, Denver CO\n\nSubtlety and restraint defined the playing of Phil Urso, a member of the\n\n1950s' cool school who owed a strong artistic debt to Lester \"Pres\" Young\n\nbut never came across as a clone of him. Urso started out on clarinet, but\n\nthe tenor sax became his primary instrument after he studied it in high\n\nschool. Though not that well-known, Urso was a solid and expressive jazzman\n\nwho played with Woody Herman, Jimmy Dorsey, Miles Davis, Terry Gibbs, Oscar\n\nPettiford and others in the 1950s. In 1954, he co-led a quintet with\n\ntrombonist Bob Brookmeyer that recorded for Savoy, but Urso's best-known\n\nassociation came in 1955 and 1956, when he was a sideman for Chet Baker.\n\nUrso was prominently featured on some of the trumpeter's Pacific Jazz\n\nrecordings of 1956, which make one wish he had become more visible instead\n\nof less so. But after the '50s, very little was heard about Urso on a\n\nnational level, although he did remain active in the jazz scene of his\n\nadopted home of Denver well into the 1990s. Phil recorded an album with Carl\n\nSaunders \"Salute Chet Baker\" for Colorado's own Jazzed Media label a few\n\nyears ago. Phil was part of the all-star big band that was part of the\n\nperformoing artists that played for jazz89KUVO's 20th Anniversary Concert in\n\n2005 that was headlined by Marian McPartland. Urso had been ill for the past\n\nyear.\n\nMore details soon......."
