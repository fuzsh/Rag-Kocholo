        "text": "And now, some photos I took during our little soirée at the Vancouver Pen Shop, held on August 22nd! (Part 1 of our August meeting photos --those taken by Sherman-- were posted here)\n\n(all photos by Maja ~ please click on images to enlarge)\n\nThe store stayed open during our meeting, so many of our members (like Colin above, being helped by Marlon) took advantage of this late-night shopping opportunity to buy some things...\n\nMohammad also bought something from the store that evening -- this gorgeous Montblanc Classique mechanical pencil.\n\n(Cute dog who attended the meeting): \"Did someone say \"pencil\"?? I thought this was a fountain pen club!!\"\n\nYes -- \"Pencils--any kind\" was our meeting theme! It was actually suggested by Shannon, who brought one of the most interesting pencils I saw --this clarinet-shaped mechanical pencil! This eye-catching advertising pencil was made for the French company Selmer, makers of professional-grade musical instruments.\n\nVancouver Pen Shop staffer Sunshine brought his favourite pencils (above) --a very nice mix of modern and vintage-- to the meeting, too.\n\nDaryl's Monroe mechanical pencil advertising Black Top Cabs (above) is a handsome vintage example, but it's even more interesting when you turn it around....\n\n...and see that it actually has cocktail recipes on its barrel! When you rotate the barrel to select a drink (w.g. a Manhattan), the drink's ingredients (and their proportions) appear in the barrel window. Not surpringly, this pencil's name was the Monroe \"Cockail Pencil\".\n\nThat's David C. holding up two really nice vintage mechanical pencils---in his right hand is a Waterman '94' in the harder-to-find \"Blue & Cream\" colour, and in his other hand, a vintage Parker '51' cap-actuated mechanical pencil.\n\nAsifa also brought a vintage Parker '51' pencil (top pen) to our meeting, and Phil brought a vintage Wahl mechanical pencil that belonged to his great-grandmother. The orange carpenter's pencil with advertising on it was a gift I got from Peter H. during the meeting (thanks again, Peter!).\n\nAbove: a vintage Autopoint mechanical pencil that belonged to Phil's grandfather with a \"Property of the Canadian Bank of Commerce\" imprint on it. Autopoint first began manufacturing mechanical pencils in Chicago in 1918 but, much later, developed financial troubles and was eventually sold to well-known vintage pencil expert Jonathan Veley in 2022.\n\nThe cool black and yellow mechanical pencil belonging to Renz is a modern pencil made by the Legendary Pencil Company (in Newark, Ohio) using New Old Stock parts from (guess who??) Autopoint, the company they acquired in 2022! Below Renz's pencil are two cute pencils that Asifa bought at a night market in Richmond :)\n\nAbove: Some nice modern pencils, including an OHTO Sharp Pencil 2.0 (with a 2mm lead), and a Uni Kuro Toga pencil belonging to Christina's husband. The Kuro Toga has a very interesting feature -- it has a mechanism that rotates the pencil lead every time you lift it (while writing), so the lead tip wears down evenly on all sides (side note: in the background of the photo, you can see one of the cool 3D-printed pen stands made by Amy H.)\n\nAbove: Part of Trevor's vast pencil collection!\n\nThe dark pink pencil in the center of the photo (which is shortened from use), is one that Trevor used in school (Wow! 😮).\n\nI also brought some pencils, but mostly vintage:\n\n(left side of case: a green unmarked vintage pencil and five Sheaffers; right side of case: a cream & black Diamond Medal pencil, two Eclipses, an unmarked vintage advertising pencil (for a poulterer's shop in Leicester, England), a vintage Pelikan 450 repeater pencil in \"tortoiseshell\" celluloid and a Parker '51' pencil; the pencil in the middle was made by Ketcham & McDougall of East Orange, New Jersey, and it's attached to a retractable chain and matching brooch that can be pinned onto clothing.\n\nI brought some modern pencils, too:\n\n(left to right): Pelikan 'Epoch', TWSBI 'Pagoda', Pentel 'Kerry', and a Faber-Castell 'e-motion' maple wood mechanical pencil.\n\nAbove: Me (in the middle), flanked by Vladan and Asifa. In the background, you can see Vancouver Pen Club members Peter H. (yellow cap) and Renz (standing in line behind Peter).\n\nOur thanks to the good people at the Vancouver Pen Shop for being such gracious (and generous!) hosts! Another big \"thank you\" to everyone in our club who attended our August meeting; we had a huge turnout, so I didn't get a chance to photograph more people (and pencils lol), but thank you for your participation and support!\n\n*** Info about our September meeting will be posted here on our website once the meeting venue has been confirmed. Until then, have a great week, and a great rest-of-August!\n\nBest wishes,\n\n~Maja\n\nMany thanks to the Vancouver Pen Shop for inviting us to their wonderful store in downtown Vancouver for our August meeting on the 22nd! Sherman and I both snapped a lot of photos, but I'll start with his pics as he took a lot more photos of people (I took more photos of the pencils people brought in for the evening's theme lol). Enjoy!\n\n(all photos courtesy of Sherman ~ please click on photos to enlarge)\n\nThat's Sherman on the left, with longtime Vancouver Pen Club member Mark (Sherman is holding up one of Mark's new business cards for his pen repair business PenDen.ca)\n\nIt was a full house at the store --someone estimated about 60 people in attendance!-- and there were many new faces, like Alan (next to Sherman) and Amy L. (holding up a cute pen/pencil case above). Amy joined our club a while ago, but attended her first meeting that night.\n\nFrancis (wearing a cap) and Anson (next to Francis) both \"officially\" joined our club recently and Christina (far right) joined this Spring, but there were some attendees at the meeting who weren't in our pen club. If you're one of those folks and want to join our club, please email us at: vancouverpenclub@gmail.com (we're a casual & friendly bunch 😁)!\n\nEveryone knows Shannon, the hard-working manager of the Vancouver Pen Shop! (that's newer VPS staff member Dee in the background) Many thanks to the Pen Shop staff for their patience and ever-helpful service during a very busy/hectic evening!\n\nAbove: (left to right) Rumi, Leo (who I hadn't seen since prior to the pandemic!) and Mohammad.\n\n(Left to right) Longtime VPC member Tristan (who I hadn't seen since 2020), me (Maja), Vladan and Trevor.\n\nAbove: Anson (in the white hoodie) looks on as Amy H. inspects some of the lovely handmade fountain pens he produces under his Springfield Pens brand. That's Amy's friend Anna next to her, and Daryl in the background...\n\nLeft to right: David C, Collin, Mark, Jerred, Rene, Trevor and a mystery gentleman.\n\nThat's David L. (far left) talking to Francis. Charles (far right) brought his fountain pen fan friend Rick (standing to Charles' right) to his first VPC meeting ... and Rick wound up winning a door prize!\n\nThat's longtime VPCer (and loyal Vancouver Pen Shop customer) Stuart strolling into the main part of the store. The store's foyer has a whole wall of inks for sale, calligraphy supplies, discounted pens and Galen Leather products, while the main area has lots of wonderful writing instruments (fountain pens, rollerballs, ballpoints, pencils) at every price point, and many pen- and ink-related accessories.\n\nThe Pen Shop had several raffle prize draws that evening -- that's Shannon in the middle of the photo above, drawing the winning numbers.\n\nAbove: VPCer (and talented nib repair guy) Jerred, picking up his raffle prize (a bottle of Sailor Shiki-Ori ink)...\n\n...and a very happy Rumi picking up hers (a turquoise Caran d'Ache '849' mechanical pencil)!\n\nOne of our newer members, Esther, also won a prize - another Caran d'Ache '849' mechanical pencil, but in the Blue 'Colormat-X' anodized finish.\n\nMohammad (who joined our club several years ago) was another lucky prize winner...\n\n...as was longtime member Glenn Marcus, who won a nice bottle of Mont Blanc 100th Anniversary ink.\n\nAnother prize winner! (this time, not a club member, as far as I know)\n\nAbove: VPCer Renz won a lovely Lamy Studio in the 2024 Special Edition colour \"Royal Red\" and a bottle of red Mont Blanc ink!\n\nDavid C. holding up a nice case that he won that night....\n\n...and Mark picking up his own prize! Congrats to all the raffle prize winners! 👏\n\n(Sherman, Master of the selfie stick! 😁)\n\nEsther and Rumi with their prizes -- Swiss-made Caran d'Ache '849' mechanical pencils!\n\nRumi with a couple of ink swatches\n\nAnd last, but not least, Sherman and his pencil collection!\n\nThe evening's theme (chosen by Shannon from the Pen Shop) was \"Pencils---any kind\" and we saw lots of wonderful examples (which you'll also see in part 2 of the August meetup photos--the photos I snapped that night)\n\nSherman was kind enough to send in this photo of the pencils he brought (seen above), along with this caption:\n\n\"These are all the pencils in my collection. I am so fond of those Staedtler Pencils from the University of Ottawa. The 4 élysée Parthenon (10 Line) Bi-Colour Platinum & 18K Gold Plated pens are a set, so I minded as well showcasing the fountain, rolling ball & ballpoint pens together. Another impressive item was the Kuru Toga Advance White Mechanical Pencil. The Vancouver Pen Shop should have this available in the very near future. My young son bought it online, and gifted it to impress me, wohahaha…. The pencil can rotate the lead itself while writing, so the tip on the lead is always in round shape… no more sharp edges…. Isn’t it so sick???🤣🤣🤣\"\n\nMany thanks to the Vancouver Pen Shop for a fun get-together, all the wonderful raffle prizes, snacks and goody bags, and thanks to Sherman for his great photos!😊\n\nPart 2 of the evening's photos will be posted tomorrow night or Monday, so watch for that soon! (** Update **--Part 2 posted here!)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Maja\n\nMany thanks to everyone who came to our August meeting last night; I'll post some photos from the meeting over the weekend. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy this lovely recent find of Christopher's!\n\nChristopher writes:\n\n\"It is hard these days to find a vintage pen sporting, in part, a cream coloured finish that isn’t somewhat, or even a wee bit, discoloured. Ink left in these gems, discharge gases from old rubber sacks or even skin oil can wreak havoc with plastic coloured finishes over time... especially if the plastic is not cured properly in the beginning. Sometimes different treatments like bleaching can be applied to reduce this discolouring but, for the most part, it is just something regarding vintage pens that collectors as such have to live with. Saying that, when a vintage pen is found with no trace of discolouring, especially to a cream colour finish, it is just an amazing find. Such was the way with a Wahl Eversharp that came my way recently. Plus, not only is there no sign of discolouration, but the Pyrroline plastic had retained its brilliant surface sheen.\n\nThe pen in question is the shorter model, but with the Wahl ‘Personal Point’ option. This allowed the user to have interchangeable nibs and feeds set into a screw-in unit to be placed in the section. Over and above, this pen sports the Gold Seal. This feature was reserved for the top pens in this line and is comprised of a small gold oval sporting two check marks to assure the pen owner that the pen in question had been doubly checked by the factory.\"\n\n(photo courtesy of Christopher ~ please click on image to enlarge)\n\n\"Starting with the overall finish, it is a brilliant cream with jet and pearl mottling. To offset this very attractive finish, the fittings are 14K Gold filled and, in the case of this particular pen, banding has been applied in three different places, with a double banding at the open end of the cap. This pen is a lever filler but the lever, although short, is quite substantial and works extremely well. At each end of this pen, barrel and cap there is a rounded, slightly convex jet black end, and in the case of the cap, on the top is a round 14K Gold filled circular insert. This brings me to the clip, which is the ring type, tapered to a roller ball ending with the company branding running vertically down the length of the taper. The section is also jet black and quite substantial, plus it sports an absolutely superb, well-tipped Eversharp marked 14K gold nib.\n\nThis nib with a F for fine marked feed, gives a healthy flow of ink but I would have to classify the nib as a general writing medium flex and, even saying that, I am being somewhat generous regarding the flex. Still, do I like writing with this pen? Well, the answer has to be \"yes\", and mostly for its laying down of the ink evenly and consistently. So to sum up, this is an exceptional vintage writing instrument, all and all, and a definite contender to go straight into my vintage pen collection\"\n\nOur thanks to Christopher for sharing another wonderful vintage pen find with us--it is much appreciated!\n\nToday's blog post is about a modern Parker find of Christopher's--two of them, in fact!\n\n(photo courtesy of Christopher ~ please click on image to enlarge)\n\nChristopher writes:\n\n\"I have professed, on many occasions, to be a serious collector of vintage pens over the newer ones. Still, there comes a time when that rule of thumb is gladly broken. Case in point - the Centennial Edition re-creation, in the UK, of the Parker Duofold during the late 1980s. As the story goes, when Parker’s writing instrument division changed hands and moved from the US to Newhaven, England, it seemed that everything fell into place to honour the original Parker 1920s Duofold line of pens with a Centennial edition line. Face it - who didn’t love writing with the Parker Duofold? But the British approach was to pull out all the stops to create a perfect tribute to one of George Parker’s best-selling pens - a line of pens that literally put the Parker company name on the map, and established it as one of the major leaders in producing fine and dependable writing instruments.\n\nNow, fittingly, 1988 was the Parker Company’s centenary, so applying a centennial branding to this Parker Duofold tribute seemed rather fitting. But to what end could the UK Parker plant turn out a higher quality product in regards to this centennial Duofold tribute? Well, the production process started respectfully in 1987 and included a ten day computer manufacture process to get things just right. This was followed by the development of 130 different components at a level of quality control testing that just could not be beat. Strict attention was paid to the product’s make up, to include the finest and most durable materials. Along these lines, a extremely hard acrylic, Methyl Methacrylate was chosen for its overall strength and durability. The fittings had a sold brass base, which was, in turn, nickel plated to finally be further thickly plated with 23K Gold. The nibs were finely cut out of 18K Gold, but with the Parker arrow integrated in ruthenium, which also gave the nib the hard tipping required. These superb Parker nibs sat correctly and responsibly on a very well made feed that included the collector at the back end, which had made the Parker 51 just such a good option. Both nib and feed were subsequently inserted into a very well designed grip section, with further banding on the business end and the aft end. As for further design refinements, the first Centennial Parker Duofolds had a tapered, but shorter, arrow clip which sat with its tip well above the cap banding. As the line moved on, this clip was lengthened to have the tip sit directly above the cap banding. The filler was one that had served the British Parker works so well in the past and just came down to the dependable Parker aerometric, which also had proved itself to be reasonably leakproof. It should be noted, though, that the Centennial also could be acquired with a converter-type twist filler and Parker ink cartridges could also be used. To finish this Parker treasure, the cap top was crowned with a black acrylic cap screw which mirrored the original 1920s Duofold one. At the barrel end of the pen, was a long black fixed blind cap with a double ringed tassie. Could any pen lover ask for more?\n\nWell, I would have to answer the above question with \"Yes\", because the Parker Centennial line also included a complimentary ballpoint, rollerball and or mechanical pencil. But my focus has to be on the Centennial ballpoint because that was the writing instrument that was included in the Centennial set that came my way. Over the years I have come across and injected a good number of Parker Duofold mechanical pencils into my vintage pen collection, but what I really admired about my particular Centennial set was that the ballpoint followed more or less exactly the design of the earlier Parker Duofold pencil. Of course, it matched the pen in finish as described above, but sported a beautiful gold crowning cap with could, in turn, be twisted to bring out the ballpoint writing tip. While the fountain was 6 ¾ inches posted, when capped at 5 ½ inches, the Centennial ballpoint came close to matching this length. To wrap things up in the Parker Centennial department, my set came in a very smart plush and smartly covered inside and out display box. And I was thrilled to find not only a spare ball point refill in the area underneath the pen's interior support card, but also a smartly finished lengthy instruction manual booklet, complete with the world wide Parker ‘Lifetime’ warranty. All mentioned, in turn, fitted perfectly into a matched grey outer Parker marked cardboard box. I have as yet to ink and write with the fountain pen, but did dip it to see how the nib performed on paper. On the other hand, I have used the ball point with great success. So, in both cases, I could not be more pleased, and this fine Parker set will definitely see some age to it residing in my pen collection.\"\n\nOur thanks to Christopher for sharing this modern classic with us! As an aside, I posted a review of my own modern Parker 'Duofold' fountain pen here a few years ago, but my pen was the Dufold \"International\", the smaller relative of Christopher's Duofold \"Centennial\" model.\n\nHave a great weekend,\n\n~Maja\n\nHope you're having a good week! Don't forget that our August meeting will be held next Thursday, that's Thursday August 22 (which is a departure from our usual third-Thursday-of-the-month date) at the Vancouver Pen Shop from 6:00pm - 8:00pm (full details here) . Hope you can make it!\n\nNow, here's another treasured vintage Waterman fountain pen that came Christopher's way!\n\nHe writes:\n\n\"I have been a serious vintage pen collector now for well over a decade and a half, but delving into the early precious metal overlays just seemed out of my grasp. Then, as time went on, they started to surface at prices well within my budget ... and I was quick to respond. Still, as much as the gold overlays turned up, it seemed that the sterling silver ones just were not that abundant, especially in the filigree finish. Admittedly, I have always been a big admirer of the Art Nouveau period and this one is no exception regarding impressive fountain pens. So nailing an early sterling silver filigree ‘Art Nouveau' style fountain pen was just wonderful when one came my way. I should mention that regardless of manufacturer, these pens are not inexpensive and with the more upper end pen companies like Waterman, Conklin and Parker, you can expect to lighten your pocket book considerably. Fortunately, the pen in question did not break the bank and once in hand, I was just thrilled to have it.\n\n(photo courtesy of Christopher ~ please click on image to enlarge)\n\n(above: a detail from the painting \"Salome\" by Franz von Stuck -1863-1928)\n\nSo, what exactly came my way?! Well first off, it’s a Waterman’s Ideal product, produced by the company in 1903. Secondly, it is an eyedropper with the old style lengthy vulcanized rubber grip section. A long cap, of course, indicates that this is an early period writing instrument, and a clipless one with a slip on cap at that. In fact, everything about this olde trooper comes forth as a pen for the beginning of the last century. Over the vulcanized black rubber barrel and cap is a floral Art Nouveau sterling silver filigree overlay, beautifully crafted and finely finished, possibly by the Geo W. Heath Company of New York.\n\nStill, and personally, I do feel that the real treasure in this brilliant olde treasure revolves around the Waterman’s Ideal 14K Gold nib. For the truth be told, it is an original factory broad with tipping totally intact and tons of available flex, making it an absolutely gorgeous writer. And just to make this nib apply itself to perfection on paper, it was placed over a Waterman ‘Spoon Feed’ and inserted well into its section. To test this writing option, I removed both nib and feed and, in turn, tried both at different lengths coming out of the section. But in the end, its original placement proved absolute perfection and with this, Waterman will once again become part of my vintage pen collection.\"\n\nHappy Sunday! Today's blog post features a highly sought-after vintage Waterman's No. 7 fountain pen that Christopher recently acquired. Our thanks to Christopher for his review and accompanying photos of this vintage treasure! (side note: the distinguished-looking gentleman in the first photo is Christopher's paternal grandfather, who was a judge on the BC Supreme Court and the BC Court of Appeals)\n\n(please click on images to enlarge)\n\nChristopher writes:\n\n\"In order to paint a true picture of the Waterman’s Ideal No.7, one has to go back to 1915 when the company released a rather substantial black hard chased rubber lever filler that they branded suitably the No.15PSF. The branding related in part to the nib which, in fact, was a Waterman Ideal No.5 nib in size, while the PSF (which could be found on the lever) referred to Patented Self Filler. As with a lot of Waterman pens at the time (and ongoing), the branding in full also appeared on the flat end of the barrel. In 1917, Waterman revised their product numbering system and as with the Waterman’s Ideal No. 12 becoming the Waterman's Ideal No. 52, the Waterman’s Ideal 15 became the Waterman’s Ideal No. 55.\n\nIn 1927, one year after the company had introduced a number of coloured vulcanized rubber finishes, the company decided to go full tilt into the advertising marketplace with several of their pens. The pens selected were the Waterman’s Ideal No.5 and the Waterman’s Ideal No.7. They also gave these two pens some very special features. Since the pen I am focusing on --which has just come into my collection-- is a Watermen’s Ideal No.7, I will leave the No.5 for another time. Actually, I had been after the likes of one for quite some time and managed to score a seemly ‘old store stock’ very fine example, which had never been inked. But on with the description...\n\nThis fine Waterman hails from 1928. The earlier models can be easily recognized due to the absence of white cap banding on top and on the bottom of a coloured middle band which denotes the type of nib being carried in the pen. Personally, I like these with the white cap bands since they tend to accentuate the middle coloured band which, to my mind, is kind of lost on the earlier Ideal No.7s.\n\nSo, back in the day you really could tell what kind of nib you were getting by just checking out this coloured cap banding. But this was further substantiated right on the nib. In my pen’s case, the word ‘Red’ at the top indicates that I have a Standard general writing medium flex nib. And to my absolute delight, I believe that the Waterman Company understated the flex because, to my mind, it would be more than expected in any vintage pen collector’s hand. This No.5 nib is of good size with a ‘Key Hole’ instead of the regular round breather hole and, being an Aikin Lambert product, is of outstanding quality.\n\nThe general make up of the pen is the Waterman ‘Red Ripple’ and that includes the grip section, which is more than adequate. The Waterman ‘Spoon Feed’ (seen above) is also in vulcanized red rubber and goes well with the rest of the pen. Plus, I can use the word \"substantial\" regarding the overall length of the pen, which posts at a full 7 1/16 inches but caps back to a breast pocked size of 5 ½ inches. The fittings are 14K Gold filled and the clip is the typical Waterman’s Ideal ball ended one succoured with two similarly finished rivets. At the bottom of the cap, there is a good sized gold filled banding, which definitely protects the vulcanized rubber finish at this open end of the cap, from cracking and chipping. I believe that the Waterman company’s sticking with the hard rubber over the beautiful coloured plastic that their competitors were using, had to explain their entry into the advertising marketplace with quality, quality, quality and innovation. To my mind, with both their Ideal No.5 and larger No.7, it truly worked.\n\nIn closing, my advice to any vintage pen collector, especially those collecting Waterman pens, is to dive in with this one, since it is moving up regularly in price. Ironically, back in the day, the Waterman’s Ideal No. 7 sold for $7.00.\""
