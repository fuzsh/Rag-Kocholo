        "text": "div>\n\nAn inspiring speech by a local county legislator and stirring musical performances by a Walt Whitman High School sophomore and local church groups marked Huntington’s 26th Annual Black History Month Celebration on Thursday, February 7. Dr. William Spencer, who represents the 18th District in the Suffolk County Legislature, emphasized in the keynote address the importance of education in achieving success and of helping people by being a good neighbor. Dr. Spencer noted that a half century ago, at the height of the civil rights movement, education was viewed as a priority in the path to success; today, he noted, only 18 percent of African-Americans have a college degree. “We, the People, need to re-dedicate ourselves to education,” he said. Highlighting the musical performances was the impressive rendition of the Negro National Anthem sung by Kalif Omari Jones.

Petrone today announced that all roads in the Town are officially closed and urged residents to stay home today. This is the text of the telephone message he sent out via the Huntington Alert system: This is Supervisor Frank Petrone with a Huntington Alert message. Roads in the Town are treacherous. As we all dig out from last night's blizzard, it is vital for your safety and the safety of others that you stay home today. Roads must remain clear so emergency vehicles can get through and unnecessary traffic will compromise their ability to do so. Keeping off the roads will also allow snow-clearing crews to do their jobs without interference. All roads in the Town are officially closed. HART bus is not operating today. All activities at Town facilities have been canceled. If your power is out, you should call the LIPA hotline at 1-800-490-0075. If a tree is blocking a road, call the Highway Hotline at 499-0444. For Town-related emergencies, call the Public Safety Department at 271-2157 or 271-6573. Town employees are working with outside contractors to clear roads and get us back to normal as quickly as possible. Crews will be clearing through tomorrow. But do not think that because your street is cleared, that means it is safe to venture out. Even if your street has been cleared, that does not mean the next street over is passable. Enjoy the day at home with your family. Be careful, be safe and be warm. Thank you.\n\nPETRONE DECLARES SNOW EMERGENCY\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P.

Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 2/6/2013\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nThe Huntington Town Board, at its February 5 meeting, approved a 128-day moratorium on the processing of applications and the issuance of permits for the construction of wind turbines. The moratorium will allow time for the Town to craft regulations regarding zoning, use, location, size, height, noise and safety requirements. Sponsored by Councilman Mark Cuthbertson, the resolution establishes a procedure similar to the one followed on 2011, when the Town enacted major revisions to the Town Code affecting cellular telephone towers. Currently, the Town has no regulations specifically pertaining to wind turbines. However, with the wind turbine industry experiencing rapid growth, and with applications for turbines pending or anticipated, the Board saw the need to explore whether procedures specific to wind turbines should be included in the Town Code. The moratorium holds existing applications in abeyance allows while the Board considers the issue. The Town Board vote followed a public hearing earlier in the evening at which several speakers made suggestions about factors the Town Board could consider in promulgating the new regulations. In other action, the Town Board: -- denied, for a second time, issuance of a certificate of approval in a historic district that would have allowed construction of a three-bay automobile repair shop at 114 Prime Ave., in the Mill Lane Historic District. The vote immediately followed a public hearing at which residents expressed concerns that the repair shop would be out of character with the district and create noise and traffic problems. The Town Board originally denied the application last year, but a State Supreme Court justice ordered the Town to reconsider the application after the original denial was challenged in court. -- approved creation of a Hurricane Sandy Emergency Review Task Force. The task force will assess the Town’s preparation and response to Hurricane Sandy and make recommendations about changes that should be made as the Town plans for the next storm. The task force is to report its findings to Supervisor Frank P. Petrone by May 1. -- approved creation of a Melville Plan Advisory Committee to oversee the issuance of a request for proposals to select a project consultant to prepare a Melville integrated land use, circulation and infrastructure plan and to oversee the development of the plan. Appointed to the committee were David Pennetta, Oxford & Simpson Realty; Mark Hamer, Harvest Real Estate Services; James T. Coschignano, Melville Fire District; Michael DeLuise, Melville Chamber of Commerce; Alissa Sue Taff, Sweet Hollow Civic Association; Mitchell Pally, MTA; Frank Pusinelli, RXR Realty; Geoffrey Rick, NYS Department of Transportation; Michael Pascucci, WLNY-TV; Paul Tonna, Energia Partnership; Seymour Liebman, Canon USA; and Anthony Manetta, Suffolk County IDA. -- authorized a $57,900 contract with GEI Consultants of Huntington Station to conduct a comprehensive hydrology study of the Crab Meadow Watershed and to draft a Stewardship Plan that will help maintain and enhance the environmental quality of the system. The plan will be created with public input and by working with the Crab Meadow Watershed Citizens Advisory committee. -- authorized a contract with Granicus Inc. to help manage, organize and index video that is made available on the Town’s website and on its government access television channels. -- declared May 18-24 as Town of Huntington Safe Boating Week. The Town has been working with the Greater Huntington Council of Yacht and Boating Clubs on programs for the week.\n\nPetrone Unveils Curbside E-Waste Recycling Program\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 2/5/2013\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nHuntington Town Supervisor Frank P. Petrone announced today that residents can now call the Town for curbside pick-up of their electronic waste (e-waste). Supervisor Petrone was joined by Town Board members, Town Environmental Waste Management staff as well as Lloyd Harbor resident and environmental advocate, Jeff Bartels. According to the Department of Environmental Conservation, industry experts estimate that U.S. consumers throw away 400 million units of electronic equipment per year. Recycling electronic waste protects human health and the environment by diverting thousands of pounds of waste from landfills and incinerators. It also keeps toxins such as lead, mercury and cadmium from contaminating the air, water and soil, and, e-waste recycling conserves natural resources by allowing valuable materials to be reclaimed and reused. Prior to the launch of Supervisor Petrone’s e-waste curbside pick-up program, residents were encouraged to bring their electronic waste to the Town’s Recycling Center at 641 New York Avenue in Huntington between the hours of 8am to 4pm, Tuesday through Saturday. Those who prefer to dispose of e-waste at the Recycling Center in this way may continue to do so. However, the new curbside pickup service is intended to encourage higher volume and more widespread disposal of e-waste in the most convenient way possible. “In 2012, residents disposed of 330,000 pounds of e-waste at our Recycling Center, Supervisor Petrone stated. “I believe with our new curbside pickup program that number can boost dramatically in 2013 and beyond.” Electronic waste includes computers (including laptops, desktops, tablets and e-readers), televisions, cathode ray tubes, small scale servers, computer peripherals, monitors, keyboards, mice or pointing devices, fax machines, document scanners, printers, VCRs, digital video recorders, portable digital music players, DVD players, digital converter boxes, cable or satellite receivers, electronic or video game consoles, etc. “By calling 351-3239, residents can make arrangements for specific day pick up of their e-waste, as well as receive detailed instructions on how to erase the contents of their computer hard drive, or remove them altogether, to help guard against identify theft,” Supervisor Petrone said. The Town’s proactive stance in the proper and convenient disposal of e-waste puts Huntington two years ahead of schedule. Beginning January 1, 2015, New York State law will prohibit consumers from disposing covered electronic equipment in landfills or waste to energy facilities. DeLuise Named to EDC Board\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 1/25/2013\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nHuntington Supervisor Frank P. Petrone announces the addition of Dix Hills public relations executive Michael B. DeLuise to the board of the Town of Huntington Economic Development Corporation. “Mike brings to the board extensive expertise in the public relations field that will help the EDC increase its visibility and awareness of its projects, as well as deep roots in the Huntington business community that will help the EDC achieve its goals,” Supervisor Petrone said. “We welcome Mike to the EDC board and look forward to his contributions,” said Rob Ripp, EDC board chairman. A graduate of New York University, DeLuise was president of a Manhattan-based marketing and advertising firm whose clients included the New York Philharmonic, Radio City Music Hall, American Museum of Natural History, John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, KOOL Jazz Festival, WBLS Radio, Pacifica Radio, Pro-Arte Records, Saratoga County Promotion, and numerous theatrical productions including the Broadway production of MUMMENSCHANZ and David Merrick's 42ND STREET. DeLuise then spent 23 years in college public relations, mostly at Hofstra University but also at New York Institute of Technology and Dowling College. DeLuise founded and is president of the Melville Chamber of Commerce, one of Long Island’s fastest growing business groups, and co-chair of the Huntington Station Action NOW Coalition’s public awareness committee. He has also served as vice president of the Vanderbilt Museum board, president of the Long Island Advertising Club, chair of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau and a member of the board of directors of Friends of Long Island Heritage. He has been recognized by the Public Relations Professionals of Long Island with their Lifetime Achievement Award and was named 2012 Person of the Year by the Long Islander Newspapers. The Town of Huntington Economic Development Corporation (EDC) is a not-for-profit corporation that was established by the Huntington Town Board in 2003 to foster economic development and business opportunities throughout the Town.

DeLuise’s election as a director came at the EDC’s January meeting and is effective immediately.\n\nHuntington Acquires Fort Salonga Parcel\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 1/25/2013\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nThe Town of Huntington took title recently to a one-acre piece of property in Fort Salonga that will be used to protect natural open space and to provide a small gravel parking area to enable safe access to the northern trailhead to the Makamah Nature Preserve across the street. The Town paid the Roberg family $350,000 for the parcel, which is located just north of the intersection of Makamah and Breeze Hill Roads. The narrow road width, winding road alignment, and fast speed of cars on Makamah Road had made parking along the western road edge dangerous and contributed to erosion of the road bank in close proximity of freshwater wetlands. Purchase of the parcel will allow the Town to address both situations. “The Town has been working for some time to acquire this property, both for its environmental significance and for how the Town can now make it easier and safer for residents to access the Makamah Nature Preserve trail,” Supervisor Frank P. Petrone said. “I appreciate the Roberg family’s patience in working with us throughout the acquisition process.” The Fort Salonga Association supported the Town acquisition, which was funded through the Huntington Environmental Open Space and Park Fund Program. The parcel lies within the Crab Meadow Watershed Area, a region that drains toward Long Island Sound. A hydrology study and stewardship plan for the Crab Meadow Watershed are about to be initiated with grant support from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The acquired property, which will be named the Davis Brickmaker Preserve, was once used to mine brick molding sand and was critical to the operation of historic brickworks in the area. Molding sand was used to line forms for bricks. In the heyday of the brickmaking operation, workers would transport the sand by wheelbarrows to the end of Makamah Road. The old pilings of the brickworks still remain along the frontage of the Town’s Geisslers Beach. Bruce Roberg, who as trustee handled the sale of his mother’s property, informed Huntington Supervisor Frank P. Petrone at the January 17 closing that he had only recently learned that it was always his grandmother’s wish that a portion of the property should go to the Town. The family once owned 80 acres that stretched from Breeze Hill Road to NYS Route 25A. The acquisition process has been a lengthy one, since the parcel had to be split from a larger parcel through the County Health Department subdivision process. Supervisor Petrone thanked Mr. Roberg for his patience in working with the Town to enable purchase of the property for the benefit of Huntington residents. Local wildlife, such as deer, turkey, fox, opossums and raccoons, will benefit as well. The Roberg site is the 31st parcel acquired under the Town EOSPA Program. A total of 240 acres has been purchased and protected since the Town’s first EOSPA acquisition in 1999. Several acquisitions are pending and will close this year, having been authorized and funded by the Town Board already. Included will be the 12.4-acre Carpenter Farm in Huntington, 8-acre Meyers Farm in Melville and 5-acre Erb Property in Dix Hills. Berland’s Youth Council Hosts Sixth Annual “Youth Forum”\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 1/24/2013\n\nAuthor: Allison Jones\n\nHuntington, NY – Over 50 local high school students attended the Huntington Youth Council’s sixth annual “Youth Forum” Tuesday evening, sponsored by Councilwoman Susan A. Berland. Students from all nine public high schools in the Town of Huntington were invited to participate in a Town Hall meeting held exclusively for high school students and run by high school students. The Huntington Youth Council selected topics for the “Youth Forum” due to their potential impact on the youth of our community as well as their national relevance. The topics were: legalization of marijuana, sex education in public schools and lowering the drinking age. Members of the Huntington Youth Council worked within committees to research and write summaries on each topic for the agenda. After the Councilwoman welcomed the students, the League of Women Voters of Huntington’s Co-President Judie Gorenstein emphasized the importance of getting involved in the democratic process at an early age. Shortly thereafter, participants broke into small group discussions led by the Executive Board of the Huntington Youth Council to familiarize themselves with the issues prior to the public hearings. Huntington Youth Council Co-Supervisors Grant Berland and Jesse Feldman-Stein and Deputy Supervisor Dylan Wadler led discussions on each of the three topics as well as the open portion in which students were invited to share their opinions on issues not included in the agenda. Deputy Supervisor of Events Rachel Anszelowicz, Deputy Supervisor of Membership Philip Giambertone, Deputy Supervisor of Publications Annie Nikunen, Deputy Supervisor of Communications Spencer Young, Town Clerk Bianca Mielke and Deputy Town Clerk Tristan Hynes assisted from the dais. Over 30 students testified in these discussions. “I am pleased that so many students chose to attend the Huntington Youth Council’s sixth annual ‘Youth Forum’ to testify on the issues that concern them,” commented Councilwoman Berland. “The “Youth Forum” gives young people the opportunity to communicate with their peers on the Huntington Youth Council on issues pertinent to their well-being. I would like to thank the League of Women Voters of Huntington and its Co-Presidents, Judie Gorenstein and Brenda Reiss, for attending this evening and for their constant support of the goals of the Huntington Youth Council. I would also like to thank the students in the Council. Their dedication to empowering their peers is commendable. Lastly, thank you to the various levels of school administrators who encouraged their students to attend the forum.” For more information on the Huntington Youth Council, please call Councilwoman Berland’s legislative aide, Allison Jones, at 351-3018.

Carter\n\nThe Huntington Town Board, at its first meeting of 2013, set a February 5 public hearing for a 90-day moratorium on issuing permits for wind turbines, allowing time for the Town to craft regulations regarding zoning, use, location, size, height, noise and safety requirements. Sponsored by Councilman Mark Cuthbertson, the resolution calling for the hearing establishes a procedure similar to the one followed on 2011, when the Town enacted major revisions to the Town Code affecting cellular telephone towers. Currently, the Town has no regulations specifically pertaining to wind turbines. However, with the wind turbine industry experiencing rapid growth, and with applications for turbines pending or anticipated, the Board saw the need to explore whether procedures specific to wind turbines should be included in the Town Code. The moratorium holds existing applications in abeyance allows while the Board considers the issue. The hearing will be held at 7 p.m. In other action, the Board: -- appointed Cindy Elan-Mangano as Town Attorney and Joan Cergol as Community Development Director. Elan-Mangano has been an Assistant Town Attorney since 2002, concentrating on prosecuting violations of Town Code in Suffolk County District Court.

This project will address damage caused by the collapsed headwall. -- authorized a compensation agreement for Randy J. Schaeffer, whom District Court Judge C. Stephen Hackeling appointed as temporary receiver for the property at 8 Judith Drive, Greenlawn, easing the cleanup of conditions that prompted the Town to place the property on the blighted properties list. -- scheduled a public hearing for February 5 to reconsider an application to allow construction of a three-bay service station at 114 Prime Avenue, Huntington, located in the Mill Lane Historic District.

Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 1/4/2013\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nA deadline is fast approaching for people to participate in an on-line survey on parking in Huntington Village, a key component of a study aimed at identifying the most effective and cost appropriate solutions to common and nagging parking issues in the village. The survey, which participants can access through the home page of the Town’s website, http://huntingtonny.gov, or at https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HuntingtonVillage, is being conducted by the New York City firm Nelson Nygaard, which in July was retained by a consortium that includes the Town, Town of Huntington Economic Development Corp., the Huntington Village Business Improvement District, the Huntington Township Chamber of Commerce and The Paramount Theater to conduct the study. Residents will have until the end of this month to participate in the survey, whose findings will be central to two meetings scheduled for next month to obtain additional input. “This is the Town’s chance to hear from you, and all those who are most closely connected to parking conditions in the Village: its business owners, local employees, residents, shoppers, visitors, and anybody who frequents the village for its business, cultural and recreational activities,” Supervisor Frank P. Petrone said. “The survey only takes a few minutes of your time, and will help us as we explore options to address this important issue.” As part of this study, the Town will be forming two stakeholder groups. The first will consist of Huntington Village business/property owners, and the second will be made up of residents most closely affected by Huntington Village’s parking demand. Each group will consist of 8-12 persons. Anyone interested in being considered for the resident stakeholder group should email Joan Cergol at jcergol@HuntingtonNY.gov with their address and telephone number as soon as possible. The Town is seeking to finalize the stakeholder groups by the end of January so Nelson Nygaard can meet with each group on Monday February 4th. Additionally, the Town of Huntington Economic Development Corporation will devote its Monday, February 4th, 2013 meeting at Huntington Town Hall (in Room 114 at 7p.m). to the subject of parking in Huntington Village. At the meeting, Nelson Nygaard will provide an update of their findings and residents will have an opportunity to contribute input. Finally, on Tuesday, February 26th the Huntington Township Chamber of Commerce will provide an update and hear input on the parking study at its networking breakfast at the Huntington Yacht Club. Networking begins at 7:30 am. The breakfast and program will run from 8–10 am. Fee is $25 for members and $30 for non-members.

Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 12/21/2012\n\nAuthor: Allison Jones\n\nHuntington, NY – Councilwoman Susan A. Berland and Suffolk County Legislator Steve Stern were on hand to present official proclamations to S & D Transfer of Cranbury, New Jersey and Valrico Ventures of Nederland, Texas at the 6th Annual “Sunshine’s Toy Drive” at the Dix Hills Fire Department on Saturday, December 15. Both S & D Transfer and Valrico Ventures donated $10,000 each which saved the toy drive this year in light of Hurricane Sandy. Valrico Ventures got word of the toy drive via Huntington Manor Fire Commissioner Mike Pastore and passed the information on to their business partner S & D Transfer. This union was a perfect case of being in the “right place at the right time” as preparations for this year’s toy drive faced a significant roadblock due to Hurricane Sandy. “Given the advent of Hurricane Sandy, the annual “Sunshine’s Toy Drive” would not have been able to occur without the donations of these two companies,” commented Councilwoman Berland. “It was an honor to present Cindy Perez of Valrico Ventures and Ed McLaughlin of S & D Transfer with official proclamations from the Town of Huntington. Their charitable donation ensured a happy holiday season for families affected by Hurricane Sandy. I thank Victoria, Hope and Mike Plumitallo for sponsoring this Toy Drive year after year.” “I thank Cindy Perez, VP of Valrico Ventures, Vyki Alleman, Ed McLaughlin, Owner S&D Transfer, Dave Tarvick, and Michael Duffy, Esq., for their generous donations to ‘Sunshine’s Toy Drive.’ Their kindness will enable many families affected by Superstorm Sandy to celebrate the holiday season,” Legislator Stern said. “Victoria Plumitallo started ‘Sunshine’s Toy Drive’ when she was still in elementary school and her thoughtfulness and dedication made today’s events possible. I congratulate her and her family for their incredible efforts to spread sunshine this year and every year.” Cuthbertson Inspects Fleets Cove Road Drainage Project\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P.

Town Board Acts on a Variety of Measures\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 12/19/2012\n\nHuntington, NY – After a moment of silence in memory of the 26 children and adults murdered at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school, the Huntington Town Board concluded its meeting schedule for 2013 by acting on a wide variety of measures Tuesday December 18. At the meeting, the Board: -- authorized execution of a contract of sale and appropriated funding to acquire approximately five acres of the former Park Avenue Dairy property at the corner of Park Avenue and Woodhull Road in Huntington. The property, an important historic site, is a key trailhead link in the planned Huntington Heritage Trail. -- authorized Supervisor Frank P. Petrone to enter into a memorandum of understanding with Covanta Huntington LLP to explore the feasibility of expanding the metal recovery system at the Resource Recovery Facility to include non-ferrous metals. Covanta, which runs the plant, already collects ferrous metals from the waste stream and sells them, with the Town receiving 90 percent of the revenue. -- approved the Heckscher Museum’s proposed sale by public auction of native American artifacts and a ceremonial cannon and the long-term loan of the Town’s mineral collection held by the museum to Stony Brook University’s Department of Geosciences. The artifacts and mineral collection have been in storage for decades and are not part of the museum’s core mission. -- approved establishment of a memorial garden, including a small statue, inside the fenced playground at Heckscher Park as a memorial to Victoria Gaines, one of three children killed in a July 4, 2012 boating accident. Costs associated with the statue, plantings and walkway will be donated by the Gaines family; the Town will assist with the installation of the statue and plantings. -- named the environmental center at the Fuchs Pond preserve in Northport as the Cranberry Hill Environmental Center, in recognition of the original name Rudolph Reimer gave the estate when he developed the property in 1927. Reiner later served from 1934 to 1940 as the federal Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization. -- approved settlement of a lawsuit with Huntington Hospital over charges for the hospital’s use of the Huntington Sewer System and execution of a contract with the hospital over future charges. -- approved fare increases for the HART bus system. -- set a public hearing for January 8, 2013 to consider acquiring two parcels as additions to Gateway Park. -- set a public hearing for 7 p.m. on February 5, 2013 to hear comments and suggestions on the Town’s response to Hurricane Sandy.\n\nHART Route and Schedule Changes Finalized\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 12/14/2012\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nHuntington Area Rapid Transit (HART), the only Town-operated bus system on Long Island, has finalized the first significant route and schedule changes since it began operating in 1978. The new routes, which take effect Jan 2, 2013, incorporate suggestions raised at two public information sessions after the changes were first proposed, as well as in letters, e-mails and comment forms left on the buses. “The format of the public sessions was extremely successful,” Huntington Supervisor Frank P. Petrone said. “It afforded the HART passengers an opportunity to sit and discuss the proposed routes with HART employees and representatives from my office. Based on the information gained from these discussions and the numerous letters, e-mails and comment forms, the project team reviewed the proposed plan and made adjustments so that the new schedules will best serve current and future riders.” The changes will replace the existing three routes with four new routes, adding 20.5 miles to the system. Buses will run more frequently than under current schedules. The changes will offer better direct service with less need to transfer between buses to complete trips. The Town hopes that these changes will encourage more people to use HART, the only Town-operated bus system on Long Island. The final plan differs from the original proposal in that it not only restores bus service to Cold Spring Harbor but increases the frequency of that service. Bus service has also been restored to Centerport and Northport Harbor. Under the new schedules, the H-10, H-20 and H-30 routes will operate every 45 minutes and the H-40 every 60 minutes. Bus schedules and a bus system map can be accessed on the Town of Huntington website at http://huntingtonny.gov/permit_pics/1463.pdf\n\nCuthbertson Announces Increased Effort to Enforce Illegal Handicapped and Fire Zone Parking\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 12/14/2012\n\nAuthor: Steven Jimemez\n\nCouncilman Mark Cuthbertson recently announced an elevated Code Enforcement Effort – corresponding to the busy holiday shopping season, that is focusing on illegally parked vehicles in handicapped parking stalls or areas marked as fire zones. Councilman Cuthbertson was joined by the Town’s Department of Public Safety and volunteer members of the Town’s Handicapped Parking Enforcement Program to warn the public about the costly and possible harmful consequences that can result from parking in one these restricted areas. “The holidays are a busy time of the year, and those who have a New York State Disability Parking permit are the only ones permitted to utilize the specially marked stalls,” stated Councilman Mark Cuthbertson. “However, with the hustle and bustle of the holiday shopping season, those without the proper State disability parking plaque will at times opt to occupy the special parking privilege reserved for those who need it the most, or park illegally in a marked fire zone area,” added Cuthbertson. Fines for those who choose to park illegally in a marked fire zone or handicapped parking stall will result in either a $200 or $230 summons respectively for a first offence. When it comes to handicapped parking, it is important to be mindful of the people who truly rely on those spaces. “They are not reserved for lazy people but rather for those who genuinely need to be close and benefit from a shorter walking distance. Without the convenience of disabled parking, many people would be forced to either stay at home or face the danger of having to cover a distance that is further than they are physically capable of doing,” said Cuthbertson. Parking illegally in a marked fire zone will also have negative and in some cases, disastrous implications. “These areas are sensitive parking areas and they are putting others at additional risk by obstructing an area reserved for first responders to stage, or park, at a useful distance from an emergency. Vehicles parked illegally in fire lanes also impede exit areas designed to ease evacuations, making it more difficult, if not impossible. Many of the emergency exits will open into the fire lane for rapid dispersal of patrons from within,” added Cuthbertson. Those who have questions or would like to request a New York State Disability Parking permit application can contact the Town’s Handicapped Services Department at 351-3232. Huntington to Complete First Round of Debris Pickup\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 12/14/2012\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nThe Town of Huntington Highway Department will complete its first round of picking up Hurricane Sandy debris from the 785 miles of Town roads this weekend (December 15-16), after which it will begin a second and final pass through the Town to collect storm-related material. Once a Highway Department or contractor’s truck has been down a road the second time, debris will be picked up by a resident’s trash hauler. Debris set out for collection by trash haulers must conform to standards for pick up: limbs less than six inches in diameter and four feet in length, bundled and tied, or in cans or bags weighing less than 50 pounds. All residents should be aware that this debris will be manually loaded by refuse workers into the truck, so it is important for worker safety not to exceed the 50 pound weight limit per bag or bundle of brush. Additionally, piles of debris and large tree limbs cannot be collected by garbage trucks To date, the Town has picked up more than 330,000 cubic yards of vegetative storm debris.\n\nCouncil Members Join in Annual Menorah Lighting\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 12/12/2012\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nHuntington Town Council Members Mark Cuthbertson, Susan A. Berland and Eugene Cook hold traditional filled donuts as they join Rabbi Asher Vaisfiche of Chabad of Huntington for the annual Menorah lighting ceremony at Huntington Town Hall on Tuesday December 11. Before participating in the lighting ceremony – each Council member lit a candle – the Council members listened to Rabbi Waisfiche deliver a brief talk explaining the meaning of the Jewish holiday of Chanukah, the significance the Menorah plays in the holiday and its symbolism for our current lives. Donuts are a traditional part of the holiday because of the oil used in their production, representing the single day’s worth of oil that burned for eight days in the menorah used to rededicate the Holy Temple after it was retaken from the Syrians by the Maccabees more than 2000 years ago. Cuthbertson Testifies Before NY State’s Moreland Commission\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 12/12/2012\n\nAuthor: Steven Jimemez\n\nA severe lack of concise and timely communication from the Long Island Power Authority leadership was a leading contributing factor to the delayed and woefully inadequate response to restoration efforts following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy, Huntington Councilman Mark Cuthbertson told a New York State commission earlier this week. Appearing on behalf of the Town of Huntington before The Moreland Commission, Councilman Cuthbertson also testified that LIPA failed to learn any lessons from Tropical Irene one year earlier and the authority’s lack of willingness to work closely and cooperatively with all local municipalities must be scrutinized and changed immediately. “Throughout the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, I had discussions with numerous Huntington residents and local business owners,” Councilman Cuthbertson said. “I thought it was important to share their stories and concerns with members of the Moreland Commission and state our case for the record.” With a limit of two minutes to speak, Councilman Cuthbertson urged the commission to investigate four primary areas of concern: Realistic assessments of damage Clear, concise and timely communication Take advantage of local resources Explore feasibility of underground wiring “The LIPA leadership had a dress rehearsal with Tropical Storm Irene in August of last year,” the Councilman said. “Despite a pledge to enhance response and communication after Irene, the LIPA leadership failed miserably. It is imperative that a drastic change be implemented with LIPA’s emergency management and response plan.” The task may be daunting, Councilman Cuthbertson said, but one that is critically important to the safety and welfare of all Long Island residents. “This is a principle responsibility of government and Huntington is committed to providing any and all resources to prevent such a sad and unfortunate response from occurring again.” The Moreland Commission, a special State panel appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo, is charged with investigating LIPA’s failures and develop a plan to address the shortfalls.

Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 11/2/2012\n\nHuntington Supervisor Frank P. Petrone, the Town Council and a coalition of religious institutions and social services agencies announced today that they will open six warming centers in the Town, giving residents without electricity in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy places where they can go to warm up, charge electronic devices, get some food and generally get a brief respite from dealing with the effects of the storm. “The weather is getting colder, people are feeling more stressed as they continue to live without heat or electricity and they need places where they can go to relax, get warm and feel less isolated because of the lack of power,” Supervisor Petrone said. “The Town, the religious institutions and the social services agencies all help people in their times of need, and coping with the effects of Hurricane Sandy defines a time of need.” The decision to open the warming centers was an outgrowth of meetings the Supervisor convened in his office attended by representatives of the Family Service League.

Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 10/25/2012\n\nIn an effort to raise awareness of the dangers of sudden cardiac arrest and the importance of establishing a formal emergency response plan to assist those stricken with cardiac arrest, the Town of Huntington and Huntington Hospital, in partnership with two outstanding not-for-profit organizations, will sponsor an educational forum on Tuesday evening, October 30. The free event, scheduled for 7 p.m. at Huntington Town Hall, will feature medical experts on sudden cardiac arrest and detailed information on the simple steps needed to establish an AED program for your organization, business or place of worship. The forum will include personal accounts from residents who survived incidents of cardiac arrest – thanks to immediate CPR and the use of an AED. Joining the survivors will be heroes who applied their training and saved the lives of other victims. Also scheduled to speak are Karen Acompora, co-founder of the Louis J. Acompora Memorial Foundation and Melinda Murray, founder of the Dominic A. Murray 21 Memorial Foundation. Both women lost their children to sudden cardiac arrest and are now leading advocacy efforts on Long Island to raise awareness of sudden cardiac arrest and the critical need to make AEDs readily accessible. Karen and Melinda will explain how their organizations can help with all aspects of establishing an AED program. For every minute that passes and defibrillation is not administered the chance of survival drops by 10 percent. Time is of the essence when someone is in cardiac arrest. Please join us on October 30 and help make a difference. Space is limited. Please contact Don McKay at the Town of Huntington to register. He may be reached at (631) 351-3309 or dmckay@huntingtonny.gov.\n\nRoute and Schedule Changes Proposed for HART\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 10/22/2012\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nHuntington Area Rapid Transit, the Town-operated bus system known as HART, is about to institute the first significant route and schedule changes since it began operating in 1978. The changes, which would take effect in January, will replace the existing three routes with four new routes, adding 20.5 miles to the system. Buses will run more frequently than under current schedules. The changes will offer better direct service with less need to transfer between buses to complete trips. The Town hopes that these changes will encourage more people to use HART, the only Town-operated bus system on Long Island. The new routes maintain service to all major facilities. However, two weekday peak-rail feeder routes that have lost most of their ridership are being eliminated. The changes are the result of careful review of the findings in a three-year study conducted by a consultant the Town hired, Abrams-Cherwony & Associates. The Town is holding informational meetings about the changes on Saturday October 27 at the Cinema Arts Center in Huntington and on November 3 at the East Northport Public Library. Both meetings are from 10:30 a.m. to noon. HART will be running more frequent service on those days to make it more convenient for residents to attend. The new routes can also be viewed on the town’s website at http://huntingtonny.gov/hart_bus.cfm.\n\nHuntington Joins Federal Action Against National Grid\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 10/17/2012\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nThe Huntington Town Board, at its meeting yesterday, voted to join an action before a federal agency charging National Grid with monopolistic behavior in negotiating long term leases with the Long Island Power Authority that has the effect of keeping the cost of electricity high by freezing out competition. The Northport- East Northport School District, at its October 15 meeting, also voted to intervene in the action before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In the action, Port Jefferson Village asks FERC to investigate and hold a hearing into alleged fraudulent practices and illegal exercise of market power by National Grid, which owns the major plants that generate Long Island’s electricity, including ones in Port Jefferson and Northport. The FERC complaint seeks an order forcing National Grid to divest itself of its existing generating facilities in the Long Island Control Area, which would include the one at Northport. The Town Board resolution, sponsored by Supervisor Frank P. Petrone and Councilman Mark Cuthbertson, notes that of specific concern to the Town is the allegation that National Grid’s actions were designed to force LIPA into a long-term extension of its power supply agreement and otherwise curtail opportunities to re-power Long Island’s existing generating facilities and manipulate the market. The resolution notes that while the Town, in response to a request for information, has filed a proposal with a State agency outlining a proposal to increase the Northport plant’s capacity and increase its efficiency, National Grid has yet to respond. The Town Board resolution also notes that the outcome of the FERC proceedings could have a significant effect on the challenges National Grid brought, in conjunction with LIPA, to the Northport plant’s assessment, seeking massive refunds of real property taxes. “LIPA has used the assessment on the generating plants as a smokescreen for the real reason electricity costs are so high: the way it has colluded with National Grid to freeze out competition and ignore proposals to power Long Island more cheaply and efficiently.” Supervisor Petrone said. “We hope a FERC investigation and full airing will lay bare how National Grid and LIPA are keeping electric costs high.” “LIPA and National Grid continue to spew misinformation about why customers pay so much for their electricity,” Councilman Cuthbertson said. “Joining the action with FERC will help ensure that Huntington taxpayers’ interests are properly represented and hopefully allow the facts about the situation to receive a public airing.” In particular, LIPA has included a page on its website with supposed “facts” about the assessment challenges that contains erroneous or misleading information. The misleading information includes: · A claim that challenging their taxes is a matter of fairness to their 1.1 million customers. However, the majority of those customers live in the very areas where LIPA has challenged its taxes. The Town of Brookhaven, Northport School District and Village of Port Jefferson alone accounts for about 250,000 of those customers. LIPA has filed tax cases in fifteen different locations on Long Island. The effect of these claims, if successful, will be to take money out of the pocket of many taxpayers and return the money – in part – to those same individuals as ratepayers. A recovery of $40,000,000 would mean a One Cent reduction in rates, hardly a significant savings to ratepayers. · A claim that property taxes account for over 14.7 per cent of their customers’ bills. However, that figure includes all taxes, a significant part of which is taxes paid to the state. · A suggestion that the assessment on the Northport plant has been improperly raised over the years. In fact, the assessment of the Northport Power Station, like most of the contested assessments, has remained constant since the creation of LIPA by the State Legislature in 1986. For almost 25 years the existing assessment had been accepted and taxes paid by LIPA. The Town believes that one of the conditions for the creation of LIPA was a statutory requirement that the Authority would not challenge the pre-existing assessments unless they were unreasonably altered. · A claim that that the Public Service Commission expects regulated utilities to routinely challenge their assessments. That is a misstatement of PSC policy which only asks that regulated utilities regularly review their assessments as part of their self-audits. Most utility assessments are addressed by consultation with the local assessor and the New York State Office of Real Property Services. There has been no such consultation by LIPA. Further, LIPA is not regulated by the PSC nor is it a private company. As a public authority it has a duty to conduct its affairs so as to balance the overlapping interests of all of the citizens of Long Island – not to penalize taxpayers in pursuit of a more profitable “bottom line”. · The U.S. Department of Labor reports that electric prices in the New York City area, including Long Island, are 50% higher than nationwide and piped gas prices are 20% higher. Long Island ratepayers are still paying off the costs of the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant. High gas and electric prices on Long Island are the result of many factors other than property taxes, including a bloated administrative force at LIPA that Governor Cuomo’s office has recently criticized. More than one-third of the Northport-East Northport School District’s annual tax revenue comes from the taxes paid on the Northport Power Plant, which is why the district moved to join the FERC action. “The School District believes that joining the FERC action will help to ensure that the School District’s interests are represented in this proceeding.” said Board of Education President, Stephen W. Waldenburg, Jr. The district noted that on October 2, LIPA and National Grid extended the Power Supply Agreement. The terms of the Agreement have not been publicly disclosed; however, LIPA reports that the extended Agreement would contain a pricing formula similar to the current Power Supply Agreement at rates to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “We are certain that the Commission will review the cost of power to ratepayers on Long Island and investigate the allegations of fraudulent practices and illegal exercise of market power,” said President Waldenburg, Jr. The Town is vigorously defending the assessment challenges and has retained as experts a land appraiser, an engineering appraiser and an economist looking at the financial impacts of the Northport plant. The Town has also conducted settlement discussions with LIPA. Those discussions are ongoing.\n\nPetrone Moves to Name Armory after Conte\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 10/17/2012\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nHuntington Supervisor Frank P. Petrone moved at last night’s Town Board meeting to name the Huntington Station Armory after the late Assemb. James A. Conte, who passed away earlier in the day after a long battle with cancer. The Town Board unanimously approved Supervisor Petrone’s resolution, which noted that one of Assemb. Conte’s last official acts was to sponsor the bill that directed the state to transfer and convey the Armory at 100 E. 5th Street to the Town. The State had declared the property surplus after several National Guard units’ operations, including the one in Huntington Station, were consolidated in a facility in Farmingdale. “Jim Conte was a distinguished legislator and a dear friend who kept the interests of his constituents and community foremost in his heart,” Supervisor Petrone said. “He worked with us as we undertook and continue the process of revitalizing Huntington Station and, in particular, he was relentless in making sure that the Town was able to secure the Armory in Huntington Station for community uses. Naming the Armory after him is a fitting tribute and a living memorial to someone who will truly be missed.” The Town and the State are in the process of taking the final steps necessary for the transfer of the building, which, after the Town takes title will be called the James D. Conte Center.\n\nTown Offers Free Spaying or Neutering of Pit Bulls and Pit Bull Mixes\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 10/2/2012\n\nIn recognition of October as Pit Bull Awareness Month, the Town of Huntington is partnering with the League for Animal Protection to offer free spaying or neutering of pit bulls and pit bull mixes owned by Town residents. “The Town and the League have worked together at our shelter to increase awareness of the adoptability of pit bulls as pets and to work with the pit bull and pit bull mixes at the shelter to make them more adoptable,” Huntington Supervisor Frank P. Petrone said. “This one-month program is a logical extension of that effort, encouraging Huntington residents to be responsible pet owners by having their pets spayed or neutered to help reduce the unwanted pet population.” Persons wishing to take advantage of the one-month program should visit the Town Animal Shelter on Deposit Road in East Northport and bring proof of residency. They will be given a voucher that they can take to a participating veterinarian, who will perform the procedure. For more information, contact the shelter at 631-754-8722.\n\nPetrone Releases 2013 Budget Proposal\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 9/28/2012\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nHuntington Supervisor Frank P. Petrone today presented a $181.7 million proposed 2013 operating budget that, even in the face of difficult financial pressures and mandated increases in employee health and pension costs, calls for only marginal increases in spending and taxes while maintaining the programs and services residents demand. The 0.83 percent increase in the Town’s total tax – or about $19 for the average homeowner – falls well below the State-mandated 2 percent tax cap limit and reflects both difficult decisions in spending for Town functions as well as a $1.5 million decrease in capital spending. “The focus of this Budget is to maintain critical and essential services at necessary levels without a cumulative tax increase,” Supervisor Petrone said, characterizing the proposal in the budget message to his Town Board colleagues, as a “responsible spending plan that stresses the Town Board’s fiduciary responsibility to the Town’s taxpayers despite poor economic times.” He additionally noted, “The preparation of this Budget document has been a collaborative effort between my office, the office of the Comptroller and the Directors of Huntington’s administrative offices and departments. I add that its preparation also benefited from an unprecedented level of participation by all members of the Town Board: Mr. Cuthbertson, Ms. Berland, Mr. Mayoka and Mr. Cook, all of whom attended my meetings with Departmental Directors.” In his message, the Supervisor noted that his previous two budgets had reduced spending through salary freezes, blue collar attrition and by targeting efficiencies town-wide in every department and office, trimming non-personnel related costs to the bone. “Opportunities to achieve additional operational savings in the same manner are becoming more difficult to find,” Supervisor Petrone noted in his budget message. “This fact coupled with flat revenues, the impact of continual increases in State mandated personnel costs, and the increases in the price of commodities and energy, all over which the Town exerts no control, means that the 2013 Budget requires very, very difficult choices.” In particular, mandated pension and health insurance costs are projected to increase by $2.7 million in 2013 and the other costs over which the town has no control are projected to increase by $500,000. Meanwhile, mortgage tax revenues are projected to decrease by $400,000. The difficult choices to respond to those stresses, as reflected in the 2013 budget, include: A capital budget of $8.6 million, $1.5 million less than in 2012. Projected $1.5 million in white-collar personnel savings that could include the elimination of positions unless equivalent savings can be negotiated with CSEA, the union representing white-collar employees. The Town is currently working with the CSEA to reach an agreement on the savings. Fee increases in various areas where the Town has historically charged far less than required to operate and maintain services, most notably parking and Town recreation programs. These fee increases are projected to total $4.1 million. The use of $3.9 million of fund balances and reserves, less than in 2011. The projected 0.83 percent overall tax hike reflects increases in the General and Refuse Funds, offset by savings in the Highway and Part Town Funds. A mild winter, coupled with reimbursement from FEMA for Tropical Storm Irene expenses, as well as a healthy reserve account to draw upon all contributed to the reduction in Highway taxes. The Town also will continue to realize the savings from Supervisor Petrone’s plan, approved by the Town Board earlier this year, to refinance approximately one-quarter of the Town’s outstanding debt. The Town was able to sell the re-issues at rates of less than 1 percent, which will generate more than $2-million in saving over the next seven years. In total this judicious approach to managing capital spending translates to a decrease in debt service of $130,000 in 2013. Supervisor Petrone noted that capital spending over the past few years has included major and costly measures to improve parking, including restoration of the North and South parking garages at the Huntington Long Island Rail Road station, as well as additional parking at the Cold Spring Harbor. The Town has also acquired property and created new parking at several locations in Huntington Village. In 2013, while the Town will limit most capital spending, one project that will move forward without interruption is the multi-million dollar reconstruction of the Town’s largest parking facility on Gerard Street opposite the Huntington Post Office. A public hearing on the proposal will be held at 6 p.m. on Oct. 16.\n\nTown Board Urges State Action on Bamboo, Liquor Stores\n\nOffice of Councilman Frank P. Petrone\n\nArticle Date: 9/25/2012\n\nAuthor: A.J. Carter\n\nThe Huntington Town Board at its Sept. 24 meeting voted to urge State action on two measures of importance to Town residents: adding invasive bamboo to the invasive species list the State is promulgating and placing limits on the number of retail liquor store licenses that can be issued within a geographic area. The bamboo resolution, sponsored by Councilwoman Susan A. Berland, was approved unanimously and followed previous attempts by Councilwoman Berland and Supervisor Frank P. Petrone to amend the Town Code to regulate the planting of invasive bamboo species. In remarks at a public hearing and during the public portion of recent Town Board meetings, residents have described for the Board the damage caused by bamboo migrating from neighboring properties. The resolution approved at the meeting takes note of a recent amendment to the State Environmental Conservation Law, effective next January 20, that requires the New York State Council on Invasive Species to work with other state departments to develop and promulgate joint regulations restricting the sale, purchase, possession, propagation, introduction, importation, transport and disposal of invasive species. “If ever there were a plant that fits the definition of invasive, it is bamboo,” Councilwoman Berland said.
