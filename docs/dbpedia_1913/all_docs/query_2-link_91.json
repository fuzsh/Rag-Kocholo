The brilliant Spanish-language tales, with a range of kids’ perspectives, speak volumes in any tongue.

In Spanish with English subtitles.)\n\nAll Kid Flicks films can be viewed online thru Dec. 31.

The Conservatory makes the pandemic the backdrop of an opera, and some of its strange and unanticipated consequences a part of the production! Since Mozart’s Don Giovanni (a dark tragedy) had already been chosen by the Conservatory for its summer program, it was totally reimagined as a hilarious comedy taking place during a pandemic and created entirely by relying on internet connections and cell phones. The entire production was staged, filmed, and edited without any of the cast and technical crew leaving home. Every special effect offered by phones was used throughout the production, from Snapchat filters to tinder messaging to turning the tenor aria “Il mio tesoro” into a home cooking show--showing us just how bizarre and surreal the world has become. Production glitches, similar to what you see every day in the media where programming is home-based, are a major part of the charm and fun of the work.\n\nThis production is offered free of charge to the public; however, any donation large or small will help to make up for some of the essential revenues lost as a result of the pandemic. Make a donation at www.TaconicOpera.org.\n\nDon Giovanni is available on YouTube to watch at your leisure and as often as you like at https://youtu.be/Mwa428_ZJpI.\n\nArtsWestchester is presenting a virtual photography exhibit on view now--The Lawrence Salley Photography Award 2020 Virtual Exhibition.
