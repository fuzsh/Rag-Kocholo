        "text": "Harvard returns to Ivy League play on the road at Cornell Saturday (Gil Talbot).\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. â€“ Looking to remain unblemished in conference play, Harvard returns to Ivy League action at Cornell on Saturday Oct. 7 at 4:30 p.m. The match will be broadcast on the Ivy League Network\n\nThe Opening Kickoff\n\nSophomore Philip Hausen and freshman Paolo Belloni-Urso lead the Crimson with five points.\n\nHausen has recorded an assist in the last two games and currently leads the team with three.\n\nSenior Christian Sady scored the game-winner in the 87th minute of a 2-1 road win over Yale (Sept. 30).\n\nSenior goalkeeper Kyle Parks has started eight of nine matches, making 41 saves.\n\nIn the last four years, Harvard is 4-0 against Cornell, and has outscored the Big Red, 9-1.\n\nLast Time Out\n\nHarvard is coming off a 1-1 draw against No. 21 New Hampshire at home on Oct. 3. Belloni-Urso put the Crimson on the scoreboard first, recording his second of the year in the 51st minute. The Wildcats scored the equalizer 15 minutes later. Parks played all 110 minutes in net, recording a career single-match best 11 saves.\n\nScouting Harvard\n\nHarvard is a 2-5-2 on the season, following a non-league win against Providence and a league win over Yale. Belloni-Urso and Hausen currently lead the Crimson with five points while Hausen sits on top dishing out three assists. Parks has started eight of nine matches in net, recording 41 saves, including a career single-match best, 11, against No. 21 New Hampshire (Oct. 3).\n\nScouting Cornell\n\nAt 4-3-2 and 0-0-1 in Ivy League play, Cornell is 3-0-1 in their last four contests. The Big Red is coming off a 1-1 tie against Penn on Sept. 30. Two weeks prior, junior Ryan Hill scored the game-winner eight minutes into a 1-0 overtime win over No. 11 Syracuse on Sept. 19.\n\nThis will be the 79th meeting between the two institutions with Harvard leading the series, 41-22-15. The Crimson won last season's meeting with a 4-0 shut-out on Oct. 8, 2016.\n\nThe Class of 2021\n\nAdding a talented group of six to the roster, Harvard men's soccer announced the incoming class of 2021 over the summer: Paolo Belloni-Urso, Cornelius Bencsik, Rory Conway, Fernando Docters, Matt Freese, and Sebastian Lindner-Liaw.\n\nFull announcement: Men's Soccer Announces Class of 2021\n\nHome Field Advantage\n\nJordan Field and Ohiri Field have been difficult places for visiting teams to take the field, with Harvard holding a 17-8-5 record at home since the start of the 2013-14 season.\n\n#Drafted\n\nAfter leading Harvard on the field, Harvard men's soccer's Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu '17 was selected with the second pick of the third round in the 2017 MLS SuperDraft by Atlanta United FC. Wheeler-Omiunu was the eighth student-athlete in program history to be selected in the draft, and the first since 2013. He made his debut for the club in the US Open Cup first round.\n\nAt the Helm\n\nPieter Lehrer is in his fifth season as the Virginia B. and James O. Welch, Jr. '52 Head Coach for Harvard Men's Soccer in 2015, tallying a 36-22-8 record over four years. Each of Lehrer's teams have won at last four Ivy League games, with 17 players earning All-Ivy nods.\n\nIvy League Network\n\nThe Ivy League Network returns for a fifth season as the home for all live streaming and on-demand video content for each of the conference's eight institutions. Broadcast in full HD and featuring a live score bug and play-by-play and color commentary, the Ivy League Network provides fans with unprecedented access to the Ancient Eight.\n\nMultiple subscription options are available to fans, including school-specific and league-wide passes.
