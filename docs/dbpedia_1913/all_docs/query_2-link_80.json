        "text": "The past twelve months have seen an appalling series of deaths of people irreplaceable in my life. I am sure you have your own list of singular creators, remarkable men and women who have “moved offstage,” but my list includes Larry McKenna, Max Morath, Manfred Selchow, Harriet Choice, and most recently, Bill Allred, Robert D. Rusch, and Jan Evensmo.\n\nWhat follows, more personal history than research paper, will be short on exact dates, but I hope readers will understand the grief, astonishment, and rage that I am now feeling. John Berryman wrote a poem on the death of his friends and peers that begins “I’m cross with god,” and although shaking one’s fist at the heavens is not effective, I feel the same way.\n\nBoth Bob Rusch (who signed off as RDR) and Jan Evensmo came into my life many decades ago, and to some eyes my contact with them would seem tenuous at most: I never saw Bob face-to-face and Jan only once, but both of them were strong presences in my life for those same decades. They were very dear to me, and no one can take their place. I will explain.\n\nI was reading about jazz from my earliest teens, and I then subscribed to a few periodicals to learn more about musicians and their latest recordings, as well as historical retrospectives. First there was the IAJRC JOURNAL — IAJRC standing for International Association of Jazz Record Collectors, then the Mississippi Rag. The first of these subscriptions pre-dates any computer use; the second was a little more recent, but both began in the previous century. The IAJRC felt, at times, like an international version of the clubhouse that met in someone’s basement, and the editor solicited record reviews and other material. I don’t remember when I began writing for them, but I had time and energy (a holiday from grading freshman essays) and so I submitted reviews of records I had bought. Parallel to this, I should note, I was a thirtyish untenured instructor at Nassau Community College, someone who liked to see his name in print and was flattered that his views on, say, the latest Concord lp would be published.\n\nI wrote enough for the Journal to summon up the energy, or perhaps hubris, to ask the then editor, whose name I have forgotten, if I could be granted a free subscription, and received a haughty reply that HE had never asked for such a thing, suggesting that something was morally wrong with my doing so. I turned elsewhere. I have written about Leslie Johnson, the endearing editor of the Rag, but that association ended with her death. (Everyone who came in contact with Leslie will look wistful at the mention of her name.)\n\nNear my college was a well-stocked Tower Records, whose jazz department had a space for periodicals, and I spent some time there, after browsing the three dozen bins of my favorite artists, leaning against the browser, reading CADENCE for free. It was published montly in Redwood, New York, and its editor was one Robert D. Rusch. I suspect I wrote Mr. Rusch a letter, immodestly detailing my previous publications (I had also written for some jazz magazines that tended to stop publication shortly after I had submitted reviews, alas) and he began to send me parcels of CDs and books. Both the discs and the books came with one top corner cut off, to discourage resale as new, and they had small rectangular orange stickers with CADENCE’s contact details. I have many such benevolences still on my shelves.\n\nMany of the artists covered in that journal were new to me, and many, because I was more provincial then than I hope I am now, seemed positively weird, but Bob was a seeker after truth. Although Leslie Johnson wanted to support the fragile art of hot music with positive reviews, Bob had a pugnacious side. I remember well that when I submitted a review of a Billy Taylor compilation on the Classics label, and said Taylor, then a Jazz Eminence, bored me with his repetition of pet phrases, I called Bob to ask if such heresy was all right, and was delighted that he encouraged me to be as iconoclastic as I liked.\n\nCADENCE was and is honest, a striking rarity in the world of jazz journalism, where a favorable review of A’s new disc, book, or gig, may nestle comfortably near A’s paid ad for their work. Bob’a magazine ran advertisements, but he made sure that there was a blank page, noted as such, between the ads and the reviews. I could write quickly and hand in copy promptly, so the parcels of CDs and books came quickly and they were generous.\n\nBob wanted me to — his own word — “stretch,” perhaps beyond what he perceived as my provincialism. And when I said to him, “Suppose I — out of my limited awareness — say that a saxophonist reminds me of Dexter Gordon when people who know more will hear them as copying Hank Mobley? I don’t want to make mistakes out of ignorance?” he assured me that he would catch any such errors before they saw print. So, mixed in with the Arbors and Concords would be a solo CD by a saxophonist, four long pieces on the tragedy of Chernobyl, a CD the saxophonist had created and paid for in every detail. I might have found it difficult to listen to, like cramming a sheaf of dry crackers in my mouth and trying to swallow, and I battled with the ethical conflict between “telling the truth” and feeling that I was doing the artist an unkindness by saying that the CD was tedious. Who was I, in the name of “honest criticism,” to ensure that some ambitious creator found their art unsaleable, simply because I found it boring? I no longer wanted to parade my subjective reactions under the heading of criticism that someone might take seriously, so, with much thought, I stopped writing for Bob.\n\nBut I did so with great regret. Of course some of the pangs came from no longer receiving free CDs and books, but more than that, it meant I lost contact with the man who signed off as “RDR.” He could appear gruff; his emails were often abrupt in their presentation (he had no time to waste) but he was unfailingly kind to me. I remember phone conversations about a variety of subjects — one in particular a detailing of the dynamics of long marital car trips — that are memorable to me today.\n\nAnd he was as attentive to his fellow beings as he was to the sounds on a disc. When I began writing for his magazine, I was in an unhappy marriage, and when the phone rang in the kitchen (this, of course, dates the story) my then-wife would stand near me to eavesdrop on what was going on, which made for tension in my voice. When she and I separated, and I had my first phone conversation with Bob, I said nothing of my changed circumstances, but he made a point of telling me how different, how relaxed I sounded, which was a great gift to me, helping me to look back on the lengthy painful experience from an outsider’s perspective, all the things I had tried to pretend were not happening.\n\nAt some point, he suffered a stroke, but apparently he kept listening and writing. And he turned to painting. The obituary says that he left us at 80, which is and was all too soon. He did not look for cyber-attention, which is why there is no portrait of him here, and I have offered instead a CADENCE cover. He remains a powerful presence in my thought, and he is one of the people who, by their encouragement, gave me courage to write without hiding behind tactful veils. We all need people who stand behind us, their hand on our shoulder, saying “Go ahead. It’s OK.”\n\nSome appropriate music for RDR:\n\nI wrote about Jan Evensmo in 2016, here, but he had been a jazz-hero since the Seventies and eventually a friendly correspondent. Our most recent e-mail exchange was on December 27, 2023.\n\nHe was a remarkable and original scholar and human being, someone who codified an idea and did the arduous sustained work to bring it to life, all the while sharing it with us. Jazz had discographies — unadorned data-based listings of recordings, usually in chronological order, with the artists arranged alphabetically. And eventually more subjective essays on artists appeared, tracing the shape of their careers, recording by recording. Sometimes the latter was part of a life-study, hence the jazz biography. But Jan invented and mastered what he called “solographies,” chronological listings of recordings, broadcasts, film soundtracks and more — any aural evidence we had — of an artist, in chronological order.\n\nLet us say someone wanted to know the facts of all the times Chu Berry was recorded, in whatever medium. A discography would list the records; a biography might add to that list with life-events. But what Jan did was to listen closely to the evidence, no matter how arcane or inaccessible, state its details (not only the song and the musical context, but the length of the solo passage) and then — and here’s the beautiful part — make a judgment and give his reasons. Those judgments could be rhapsodic or sharp-edged, and, to his credit, he often went back and revised himself when he felt he had been wrong, noting his first (perhaps myopic) response and changing it, admirably. So, in reading any entry, one had a double experience: the analytical facts intertwined with highly personal (and well-reasoned) reactions. It was the printed equivalent of being invited to a wise friend’s house to listen to and discuss records, when that friend would say, “That is so very wonderful!” but also “I am disappointed by that piece of music.”\n\nThe scope of his investigations — his curiosity, his eagerness to hear something new and wonderful (because he didn’t take pleasure in loudly announcing that he thought a solo was second-rate) — was huge.\n\nWhen you visit his extraordinary site, https://www.jazzarcheology.com/, you see that the latest additions to the musicians whose work he was exploring are Sandy Williams, Ray Nance, Henry Hagemann, Phil Urso, and George Matthews. Wisely, he left the figures whose work has already been documented (Armstrong, Holiday, Parker, Ellington, Goodman, Tatum) to others. But who else was listening to everything Phil Urso had recorded?\n\nI first encountered his dazzling work in the middle Seventies, thanks to a generous collector and friend, Bill Coverdale, who shared my fascination with the trumpeter Joe Thomas. In those pre-computer days, Bill and I communicated by typed letters, phone calls, cassette tapes, and photostats. Bill lent me Jan’s booklets on Joe Thomas and Bill Coleman, if I recall correctly, and they were not only full of information and sharp-eared perspectives on music I knew or thought I knew, but they opened a treasure-box of recordings I wanted to hear . . . shiny objects to pursue and then treasure.\n\nI don’t know when I first wrote to Jan, but I believe he had noted he was looking for rare recordings by artists we revered in common, and I let him know I had them and sent cassette copies. And then, because our interchange had been kind, I took a risk and said, “Is there any way I could hear ________? (I think it was a Jerry Newman live recording of Frank Newton called FORNICULI, FORNICULA, FORNICULATE — Newman’s odd boyish humor at work.) Jan put me in touch with the collector who had given the music to him, and I received a copy in the mail. And, slowly and intermittently, our trading-friendship began. I had received some rare music; I sent it to him, asking for something rare in return, and we proceeded. (I doubt that my experience is unique in a world of collectors who are simultaneously keeping their treasures locked up but making the odd copy for someone who has something they want, both sides writing DO NOT COPY on the side of the cassette and pretending not to see their music-driven violations of their own code.)\n\nWhen he began to share his work online, in the site mentioned above, I would get an email saying that he had explored a new artist, or, more frequently, he had added material to a dozen entries on musicians one thought he’d already explored more deeply than anyone else had. I would send him new treasures or things I had uncovered, and would receive some of my own requests with kind (although sharply-focused) replies. It, and he, became a constantly-replenished feast. And the more I read of his commentary, the more endearing a person he became: his unique self, both enthusiastic and salty, came through.\n\nI met him once in person, at the Whitley Bay Jazz Party, sometime around 2012. In a room full of people talking about music and records, he came up to me, introduced himself happily, stood there while I told him (I hope briefly) how much his work meant to me, he graciously returned the compliments, we shook hands, and he went off to talk to an expert, an admirer, a friend.\n\nEveryone who benefited from his work will miss the information he gave us so lavishly and consistently. Some of us will also miss the man who apparently spent his life getting it right, making sure those of us who shared his loves did so from a platform of correct information.\n\nI do not privilege one of these men above the other. Bob helped me become braver; Jan metaphorically invited me and anyone else to his house to share what he heard. It’s been said before, but the art form called jazz is sustained and developed by people who never adjust a ligature.\n\nI mourn these losses. But what does one do with such grief?\n\nIn conversation, one of my dear friends, the superb jazz drummer Bernard Flegar, was lamenting the death of trombone master Bill Allred, and wrote, “I am truly saddened by Bill’s death and will forever try to digest losing Butch [Miles].” I thought about this for a moment and wrote back, “The way to mourn is to play.” Others have said it, but Bernard — driving the Louis-inspired ARMSTRONG’S AMBASSADORS — can make sure that Butch and others are still alive in his own playing. I can strive to be as encouraging as Bob Rusch, as generous as Jan Evensmo. Will I equal them? I don’t know. But acting in the best tradition is better than passive grief, or so I feel.\n\nI forego the usual closing flourishes. Back soon.\n\nI don’t always speak to my college students about Literature; more often, I find myself standing at the intersection of Literature and Life. So that when a student says to me that (s)he is exhausted because of working too many hours to pay for “things,” I encourage that student to consider, before springing to buy a glittery object, exactly how many hours of work it will cost. I don’t know if my parental exhortation has any effect, but it is part of a cost / benefit calculation that has sometimes led me to put back something I was about to buy.\n\nCost and benefit is relevant here, because the person writing these words is still seriously exhausted by the previous weekend’s travel to the Rathaus, in Papenburg, in the larger territory of Westoverledingen, where the Generous Man of Jazz Manfred Selchow lives and has been staging concerts and tours for thirty years. I know I spent more hours in transit than I did listening to music, but the ten-plus hours of the latter were and are precious. A few notes follow. But first, a photograph (by my new friend Elke Grunwald):\n\nFrom the left, that’s Engelbert Wrobel, tenor saxophone; Helge Lorenz, guitar; Matthias Seuffert, tenor saxophone; Nicki Parrott, string bass / vocal; Menno Daams, cornet; Rico Tomasso, trumpet; Moritz Gastreich, drums. Others on the program were Stephanie Trick, Paolo Alderighi, Niels Unbehagen, piano; Bert Boeren, trombone; Bernard Flegar, drums; Nico Gastreich, string bass. And in the audience there’s a balding fellow with a turquoise shirt and a video camera, as close to the music as he can get without ascending the stage.\n\nFriday night featured a two-set concert by Engelbert, Stephanie, Paolo, and Nicki — a group coyly termed SWINGIN’ LADIES PLUS 2. The music was lively (TEMPTATION RAG), funky (BLUEBERRY HILL), riotously exuberant (THE WORLD IS WAITING FOR THE SUNRISE), multi-colored (THANKS FOR THE MEMORY), classic (SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET, SHINE, LIZA, ST. LOUIS BLUES) tender (THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU) and Brazilian (Nicki sang BRAZIL and played a samba medley). I heard delicious echoes of Goodman, James P. Johnson, Garner and Don Lambert, but the quartet was itself as well as evocative, full of sweet surprises in ensemble and solo.\n\nIf you weren’t in the audience, you can still hear this group — their wonderful CD, FROM JOPLIN TO JOBIM, is available on iTunes and elsewhere.\n\nAnd that was Friday.\n\nSaturday, post-breakfast, was devoted to a necessary exploration of Sleep. But at night, there was JAM SESSION NIGHT — four hours and more of sheer pleasure. It began with a set devoted to Eddie Condon’s music and world, which was started off in just the proper spirit by Nico, reading aloud from WE CALLED IT MUSIC — in German — the passage where Eddie has to go to the induction center to determine if he is fit for service. (The punchline, in English, is something like, “Get this man a drink!”) After the laughter died down, Menno, Rico, Bert, Matthias, Niels, Nico and Moritz offered songs directly related to Eddie’s recordings and performances: LOUISIANA, WHEN YOUR LOVER HAS GONE, DIANE, OH, BABY!, THEM THERE EYES, a ballad medley, and MEET ME TONIGHT IN DREAMLAND. The music also honored Milt Gabler and George Avakian, appropriately. And it honored Eddie, with beautiful hot lyricism from everyone.\n\nA short pause, and then Paolo introduced his clever AROUND BROADWAY — jazz classics that were originally show tunes in one way or another — with Engelbert, Stephanie, Nicki, and Bernard. Berlin, Youmans, Gershwin, with intelligent but never pedantic commentary by Paolo. And we heard HONEYSUCKLE ROSE, BLUE SKIES, OVER THE RAINBOW, ALEXANDER’S RAGTIME BAND, THE MAN I LOVE, and I WANT TO BE HAPPY. (The audience and the musicians were already happy. I saw this.)\n\nOne of the highlights of the weekend followed, a Hoagy Carmichael set featuring Menno, Matthias, Engelbert, Paolo, Nicki, and Moritz. The classics were beautifully played and sung: SKYLARK, RIVERBOAT SHUFFLE, NEW ORLEANS, STARDUST, RIVERBOAT SHUFFLE, LAZY RIVER — with two delicious surprises: SHIM-ME-SHA-WABBLE, which Carmichael’s Collegians had recorded, although not a Carmichael composition, and THANKSGIVING, which was his work. My marginal notations (what Stephanie called my “grades”!) were very enthusiastic.\n\nFinally — who or what could follow that? — a set led by Rico in tribute to his mentor, idol, and ideal Louis. A brief AIN’T MISBEHAVIN’ led off, then a seriously intent CHINATOWN, a more relaxed MY WALKING STICK, WILLIE THE WEEPER, a Rico-Niels duet on SWEET LORRAINE (unplanned and elegant), two versions of I LOVE YOU, SAMANTHA, YOU’RE LUCKY TO ME, A KISS TO BUILD A DREAM ON, and a two-tiered finale, merging STRUTTIN’ WITH SOME BARBECUE and WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD.\n\nA seemingly insatiable audience called for more, and got it — eleven players assembled for a Benny Carter-flavored I NEVER KNEW and a promise, WE’LL MEET AGAIN.\n\nDelighted, thrilled, elated, exhausted, I went to bed as soon as I could.\n\nAfter a perfect German breakfast buffet (I dream of these lavish assortments of food, I confess) it was time for Sunday’s JAZZ FRUSCHOPPEN (I now know that the second word means “morning / lunchtime drink,” another linguistic morsel for the word-hoard). Bert, Rico, Engelbert, Niels, Stephanie, Helge, Nico, and Moritz took on the pleasure of honoring Basie in under an hour, with MOTEN SWING, SPLANKY, a plunger-muted feature a la Al Grey for Bert on MAKIN’ WHOOPEE, SHINY STOCKINGS, ALL OF ME (for the rhythm section) and a searing JUMPIN’ AT THE WOODSIDE.\n\nNicki led Menno, Matthias, Stephanie, Paolo, and Bernard through a tenderly swinging evocation (not imitation) of Billie, Teddy, and Lester, with ME, MYSELF AND I, LOVER MAN, PLEASE DON’T TALK ABOUT ME WHEN I’M GONE, SAY IT ISN’T SO, THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT, STORMY WEATHER, and WHAT A LITTLE MOONLIGHT CAN DO — drawing on the best songs that Billie ever recorded, instead of A SUNBONNET BLUE.\n\nAnd — a proper climax — a JATP set with a five-horn front line backed by Paolo, Helge, Nicki, and Moritz, which presented long versions of TEA FOR TWO, STOMPIN’ AT THE SAVOY, I SURRENDER DEAR, IDAHO, a BLUES FOR MANNIE, THEY CAN’T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME, LADY BE GOOD with Lester’s 1936 solo for two tenors, and an encore of PERDIDO, with swing rather than honking.\n\nIt was wonderful.\n\nYes, I video-ed the weekend, so those who weren’t there should not grieve. It will, however, take some time for the videos to emerge: courtesy to the musicians requires that they be given a chance to see what they like or loathe.\n\nA Manfred Selchow weekend is a jazz feast, and he’s been doing this and more for three decades. We are all so grateful.\n\nMay your happiness increase!"
