        "text": "SWEET SURPRISES IN MY LIFE by Kim Sheintal December 2022\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS As a little girl, I was confused but interested as to how I was related to my relatives. As a little girl, I was confused but interested as to how I was related to my relatives. There were two sisters who married two brothers. There were cousins who married cousins. My mother tried to explain how everyone was related to me, but I was too young to comprehend what she told me. I fondly remember my cousin Mandel Brin who was close in age to my grandparents. When I was about ten years old, he tried to explain how I was related to him, but I could not understand. Mandel lived to be 104 and was the oldest registered pharmacist in Illinois. In 1982 at age 32, I started tracing my family so I could learn how I was related to all of the relatives who attended our family gatherings. Never did I realize in 1982 when I first put together a family tree of about 200 Never did I realize in 1982 when I first put together a family tree of about 200 names that by the time I was 72, I would have over 20,000 relatives from all over the world on my family tree and have some lines traced to the 1700s. In the mid-1990s when I was in my 40s, Mandel’s son Phil contacted me when he heard of my interest in genealogy. We worked together on our Lebovitz family tree. Phil wrote a journal about his father and sent it to me. I never could have imagined as a little girl that someday I would understand how I was related to Mandel and actually have a journal written about him. I thank Phil for contacting me and encouraging me to further research my family. I thank my parents Phyllis and Nunny for taking me to family gatherings on both I thank my parents Phyllis and Nunny for taking me to family gatherings on both my mother’s side and father’s side. I thank my husband Jon for the opportunity to visit relatives on trips, some of whom I had never met until the trips. Meeting Henry Foner in New York City was wonderful. Henry had been a name on my Jaffe family tree for many years until I met him on our trip to New York City in 1995. I thank my daughters Mara and Liana and their husbands Matt Daniel and John Bryant for listening to me for hours as I talk about my life experiences, genealogy oriented or otherwise. I thank my grandchildren, Alan Daniel, Wyatt Daniel, Ollie Daniel, Woody I thank my grandchildren, Alan Daniel, Wyatt Daniel, Ollie Daniel, Woody Bryant, and Rose Bryant for being my loves. I hope my children and grandchildren will have many sweet surprises in their lifetime. On the cover are Kim Sheintal at Red Rock Park in Sarasota in 2018 and Kim Klapman in Chicago in 1951. 2\n\nFor me, life has been a journey with many sweet surprises filled with elements of joy, coincidence, peculiarity, or serendipity. Journaling each sweet happening and calling my sister to rank with a score of one to ten often makes these surprises sweeter. The majority of my life’s sweet surprises are from tracing my roots, but not all. Discovering new relatives is my passion. Family gatherings as a child with my sister, parents, grandparents, great grandmother, aunts, uncles, and cousins were filled with happiness. As a child, many questions about my family tree arose that my parents could not answer. Many of these questions remained unanswered until I had the knowledge and strategy to find answers. My genealogical discovery newsletter articles, which I wrote for the Jewish Genealogical Society of Southwest Florida, were the jump start for this journal. For many years, I enjoyed sharing my sweet surprises by casually telling my family and friends. With so many stories in my head and many saved visuals to enhance the stories, I decided to write a journal with pictures. This journal evolved from a compilation of my genealogy discoveries to much more. Everyone has unexpected surprises…you think of something and then you hear or see it happen…you think of calling someone and then that person unexpectedly calls you…sometimes things happen because you are in the right place at the right time. Some surprises are so minor that they are not even worthy of telling anyone and others are so earth shattering that you can hardly wait to tell everyone. Many of my sweet surprises appear to be coincidental. Is it fate? Is it luck? Is it awareness? Many people have sweet surprises, but most do not appreciate these. Not only do I appreciate my sweet surprises, I appreciate other people’s sweet surprises. My favorite surprise was the day I met a lady in a bank lobby in Florida who lived in the same Chicago apartment shortly after I moved out of that apartment. I thought this was unique until my friend told me that she went to a luncheon in Florida and sat next to a stranger who bought the house in Philadelphia where she lived as a 3 SWEET SURPRISES IN MY LIFE by Kim Sheintal young girl. This journal may inspire you to appreciate your sweet surprises. When I told my husband Jon that I was journaling the sweet surprises in my life, he responded with a smirk saying, “Believe it or not.” I knew he was being funny by referring to the Believe It or Not books. I loved that comment, because Ripley’s Believe It or Not books were my favorite books when I was a child. Whereas, many of the entries in those books were bizarre, I loved reading those books. This journal is my opportunity to write my version of Believe It or Not with my personal sweet surprises. Some are a tad bizarre and some are short, but all are sweet to me. Many of my stories reference close family members by first names only. My immediate family consists of my parents Aaron “Nunny” Klapman and Phyllis Klapman (nee Lebovitz), my husband Jonathan “Jon” Sheintal, and my daughters Mara Daniel (nee Sheintal) and Liana Bryant (nee Sheintal). Mara is married to Matthew “Matt” Daniel, and their children are Alan Daniel, Wyatt Daniel, and Oliver “Ollie” Daniel. Liana is married to John Bryant, and their children are Woodrow “Woody” Bryant and Rose Bryant. My sister is Elizabeth “Liz” Klaber (nee Klapman), and her husband is Neil Klaber. I refer to numerous family members in my journal, many of whom have passed away. When referring to departed relatives, I usually use the past tense. For example, my departed parents “are” my parents forever in my eyes, but I refer to them in the past tense. Quotes from other people in this journal may not use the past tense for departed family members. I use the word “share” rather than “shared” when denoting a common ancestor, whether the common ancestor is living or not. For example, my sister and I share grandparents even though our grandparents are no longer living. My family tree, my husband’s family tree, a list of cities appearing in this journal, and a table of contents precede my stories. I hope reading these stories will sweeten your day. Experiencing and journaling my sweet surprises have sweetened my life.\n\nMe: Kimberly “Kim” KLAPMAN My parents: • Aaron “Nunny” KLAPMAN married Phyllis Jane LEBOVITZ My grandparents: • Moszek “Morris” KLAPMAN married Pessa Laya “Lena” MATIS • Shmuel Ely “Sam” LEBOVITZ married Lily “Lil” CONTORER My g grandparents: • Joel Szyia KLOPMAN married Zlata SZWARCBORT • Leib MATIS married Ruchla or Sura LAMARZ • Moishe “Moses” LEBOVITZ married Chana Dvora “Nechama” KASRILZON • Joseph CONTORER married Mera “Mary” JAFFE My gg grandparents: • Israel Iciek KLOPMAN married Ryfka ZYDEK • Berek SZWARCBORT married Chaia Maihla TAUB • Gersh Bejer LAMARZ married Sura LEJSMAN • Yehezkiel Mordechai LEBOVITZ married Leah • Shmuyla KASRILZON married Goda Bluma • Jacob CONTORER • Pincus “Samuel” JAFFE married Chaya Sore 4 Kimberly “Kim” Klapman Family Tree My ggg grandparents: • Szmul KLOPMAN married Maryem Estera SZRAJER • Josef ZYDEK married Sura • Szulim SZWARCBORT married Ruchla ABRAHAM • Hersz TAUB married Rayza KLOPMAN • Szlama LAMARZ married Rivka TAUB (no relation to Hersz TAUB) • David LEJSMAN married Leah Yisroel LEBOVITZ • Shlioma KASRILZON • Moshe Kalman “Morris” JAFFE married Leya Cherna BERMAN My gggg grandparents: • Johel KLOPMAN married Cyrla • Zev “Wolf” TAUB (father of Hersz TAUB) married Sura MOYSZEZ • Szmul KLOPMAN married Maryem Estera SZRAJER • Israel JAFFE married Khaya My ggggg grandparents: • Jakub KLOPMAN married Sury • Shlomo Zalman TAUB married Bajla • Lewek MOYZESZ married Frymet • Johel KLOPMAN married Cyrla • Pinkus JAFFE married Khana ATKATS Because much of this journal refers to my direct line of ancestors, the following list of my direct line will be helpful. A direct line includes parents, their parents, and then their parents, etc. In this list, last names are capitalized to distinguish from first, middle, and nicknames. I do not know the last names of everyone on this list. Names in quotes are nicknames, Americanized names, or alternate names. Maiden names are listed for females. The “g” refers to great. What makes my list a tad confusing is that my great grandmother Zlata Szwarcbort married my great grandfather Joel Szyia Klopman (her first cousin, once removed). Because of this, Szmul Klopman and Maryem Szrajer were my ggg grandparents and my gggg grandparents; and Johel Klopman and Cyrla were my gggg grandparents and my ggggg grandparents.

The City of Sarasota is in Sarasota County. Manatee County is adjacent to Sarasota County.

He was my maternal grandmother’s first cousin from Glen Ellyn. I had not seen Sol since my 1971 wedding in Skokie. Sol’s grandparents (Pincus Jaffe and Chaya) were my gg grandparents, making Sol and me first cousins, twice removed. I was not aware that Sol had retired to Florida. We talked about our mutual relatives and where they lived. He told me if I wanted to learn more about our Jaffe relatives, I should write to our Jeffer cousins in New Orleans. I wrote to the Jeffers and they told me that if I wanted to learn more about our family, I should call Margot Jeffer who lives in Sarasota! I remembered the name Margot Jeffer in an advertisement in the Sarasota-Manatee Jewish newspaper. My mother told me that we had Jaffe cousins who changed their name to Jeffer. I invited Margot and Sol to my home in Sarasota. We made a family tree showing our connection. My ggg grandparents (Morris Jaffe and Lena Berman) were Margot’s great grandparents, making Margot and me second cousins, twice removed. Margot and I discovered that her parents and my parents retired to Longboat Key and lived only a few blocks from each other. As a teenager, my mother met Margot’s parents when they came from New York City to visit my mother’s family in Chicago in the 1940s. Sol and Margot motivated me to trace my family. 8 I Know You On May 4, 2009, I gave a genealogy presentation for the Florida Conservative Sisterhood Conference at Temple Beth Sholom in Sarasota. I highlighted my Klapman roots. One of the attendees, Sandy Brown Oser, asked if I was related to Morris Klapman. I told her that he was my grandfather. Then she asked if I knew Nunny Klapman. I told her that Nunny was my father. Sandy was the sister of Phyllis Sola. When I was a little girl living with my parents in Chicago, Phyllis Sola lived in the same apartment building as me, with her husband and three children. Eventually the Sola family and my family moved to Skokie within a block of each other. Sandy knew my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins on my mother’s side and father’s side. While at the conference, Sandy looked at my genealogy scrapbook and saw a photograph from my husband’s sister’s wedding. Sandy recognized my husband’s sister, Nira Stein. Before retirement, Sandy’s husband was Nira’s dentist. I am glad that Sandy made the trip from Florida’s east coast to attend the conference.\n\n9 Wedding Surprises Several sweet surprises happened while planning my daughter Liana’s wedding to John Bryant and another surprise happened during the wedding. On December 6, 2009, while on an airplane to visit my daughter Mara in Richmond, I sketched a sample invitation for the Bachelorette Party that Mara was planning for Liana. I designed the invitation with Liana as a paper doll wearing underwear. I drew four outfits for the paper doll. I arrived in Richmond on Sunday evening. Monday morning, I went to a store on Cary Street. At the store’s entrance was a stack of flyers to promote “The Bizarre Market” taking place at Chop Suey Books. To my amazement, the flyer had a paper doll of a man in his underwear with four outfits for the paper doll. When I got back to Sarasota from Richmond, I wanted to enhance the outfits so I googled paper dolls and the first hit was for Liana’s Paper Doll Blog. I was surprised again, because my daughter is named Liana. I saved my sketch, the flyer, and a copy of a page from Liana’s Paper Doll Blog. Two months before Liana’s wedding, Liana and I attended a postcard show in Sarasota to buy antique postcards about weddings for the rehearsal dinner centerpieces. Liana is a very organized person who likes everything done yesterday. Her fiancé worked as an architect in New York City. Among my wedding postcard purchases were the perfect “wedding night” postcard to describe Liana’s efficiency and the perfect wedding night postcard to describe an architect. One postcard had a man in bed waiting for his new wife to join him with her sitting in a chair at a desk aside the bed saying, “Shall we write to Eddie and Ralph?” Another postcard had the new wife in bed waiting for her husband who is sitting on the floor with a blueprint of a man and woman in a bed, and she says, “Can’t you architects do anything without a blueprint?” Liana and I were interviewed and photographed at the postcard show by the Sarasota Herald. I saved the newspaper article and the two postcards.\n\n10 Liana wanted a ketubah for her wedding. We went to a store in Sarasota that had hundreds of ketubah designs by many artists. After looking at many designs by many artists, Liana chose the “Autumn Tree II” design. Two weeks before the wedding, Liana realized she went to day camp with the artist, Eve Rosin. As Liana got dressed for her wedding, the wedding photographer arrived to take photographs of Liana. Just as the photographer was setting up the camera equipment, a ladybug flew on Liana’s hand. I yelled to the photographer, “Quick, take a photograph of this ladybug!” The photographer quickly set up the equipment and took a photograph of the ladybug on Liana’s hand. Many cultures cherish ladybugs, believing them to bring good luck. It was as if the ladybug came to wish Liana good luck, stayed long enough to have its picture taken, and then flew away. That photograph appears in Liana’s wedding album. At the wedding ceremony, Rabbi Brenner Glickman announced that Liana and John’s marriage was like two love birds. A second later, a pair of birds flew over the heads of Liana and John. I have the video showing this!\n\nWhat Day Was I Really Born? Although the birthdate and time on my Chicago birth record reads June 9, 1950 at 11:41 p.m., my mother told me I was born on June 10, 1950 at 12:41 a.m. My mother preferred the June 10 birthdate, because that was my paternal grandfather’s birthday. What caused the difference in day and time? My mother told me that this had something to do with daylight saving time. I mentioned this to people interested in genealogy and to obstetricians, but no one heard of such a thing. I dismissed what happened on my birth certificate as an error. When I became interested in tracing my roots and accurately recording names, dates, and places, I became increasingly concerned about my birthdate. With documentation from the State of Illinois Vital Records Office, I found the answer. According to the Illinois Department of Public Heath, “Prior to July 1959, births and deaths were to be recorded on standard time, even though the community in which the birth or death took place was observing daylight saving time.” In June 1950, Illinois observed daylight saving time. 11 DNA Summary From 2016 until 2022, I contacted hundreds of DNA matches on Family Tree DNA, Ancestry DNA, GEDmatch, and My Heritage DNA. Most people did not respond, yet I received some responses with valuable family information which I consider sweet surprises. From many of these matches, I was able to add significant stories and numerous people to my family tree. Because of two of my matches, I was able to add to my husband’s tree. Trying to solve how I am related to my DNA matches is fun, solving the relationship is satisfying, and adding cousins to my tree is the icing on the cake. According to Family Tree DNA, Valentina Perlin from Russia and I share enough DNA to be second cousins; and Shlomit Handelsman from Israel and I share enough DNA to be fourth cousins. I have not been able to solve how I am related to either of them. On Family Tree DNA, Jared Rozen from Australia and I discovered that my gg grandparents (Rabbi Yehezkiel Lebovitz and Leah) were his ggg grandparents. On Family Tree DNA, Oshri Naparstek from Israel and I discovered that my ggg grandparents (Szmul Klopman and Maryem Szrajer) were his ggggg grandparents. On Ancestry DNA, Debbie Griffin from Northridge and I discovered that we share gg grandparents (Shmuyla Kasrilzon and Goda). On Ancestry DNA, Valerie Fuller from Arvada and I share the same great grandparents (Moses Lebovitz and Nachama Kasrilzon). On My Heritage DNA, Zuzanna Stefaniak and I share enough DNA to be fourth cousins. On My Heritage DNA, Colleen Duewel and I share enough DNA to be fourth cousins. The following eight stories will explain why I consider these matches special. These DNA references appear throughout this journal. My Husband’s Cousin Shares DNA with Me Valentina Perlin and I share enough DNA to be second cousins according to Family Tree DNA. Valentina was born in Russia, but had been living in the United States for 27 years when I initially contacted her. Valentina asked if I was related to Shlomit Handelsman, because Valentina noticed on Family Tree DNA that Shlomit is tracing the surname Sheintal which is my last name. I told Valentina that Sheintal is my last name because I married Jon Sheintal. I looked for Shlomit on Family Tree DNA and was surprised to see that we share enough DNA be fourth cousins. I contacted Shlomit, and we tried to determine how she fits into my husband’s family tree and/or my family tree. Although, I have not been able to discover how I am related to Valentina or Shlomit, I discovered that Shlomit is my husband’s cousin. Jon and Shlomit share the same gg grandparents (Icyk Sheintal and Ryfka Blady), making Jon and Shlomit third cousins. With a combined effort, Shlomit and Jon were able to add many people to their Sheintal family tree.\n\n12 Israel Pioneers My husband Jon was born in Tel Aviv and many of his relatives currently live in the Tel Aviv area. When I married Jon in 1971, I was only aware of a handful of my relatives living in Israel. Thanks to my genealogical research, I discovered many of my relatives living in Israel with treasured family stories. My family’s connection to Gedera is my most cherished. My family’s Gedera connection began as a six-sentence story, written by four of my Lebovitz cousins in October 1988, about our family’s connection to the Bilu group who went to Gedera in the late 1800s. In 2017, exciting things unraveled to enhance the story. On April 22, 2017, I received an e-mail message from Jared Rozen in Australia that our DNA matched as second or third cousins on our Family Tree DNA tests. Within 24 hours, we discovered that my gg grandparents (Rabbi Yehezkiel Lebovitz and Leah) were his ggg grandparents, making Jared and me third cousins, once removed. After sharing my six-sentence story with Jared, he told me that he heard a similar story. Jared told me about a museum in Gedera that highlights the 19th century pioneers of Gedera. In 2017, Jared and I were not successful reaching personnel at the Gedera Museum, because the museum was undergoing renovations. In March 2018, with Sarasota’s Israel Heritage Celebration only a month away, I was eager to connect with someone at the museum. On March 17, 2018, I asked my niece Lori Erlich who lives in Hod HaSharon to call the museum and ask about the early Lebovitz pioneers in Gedera. She did, but got a recorded message that the museum was closed for renovations. Nurit, a museum staff member, called Lori on March 22, 2018 to say that today was their Reopening Ceremony. Nurit wanted to know the first names of my Lebovitz family who settled in Gedera, because the Lebovitz family is highly regarded and remembered in the history of Gedera and its connection to the Bilu group. And best of all, some members of the Lebovitz family who came to Gedera as young adults in the late 1800s have descendants currently living in Gedera. According to the Encyclopedia Judaica, Bilu is “an organized group of young Russian Jews who pioneered the modern return to Erez Israel. Bilu was a reaction to the 1881 pogroms in southern Russia, when the ideology of Jewish nationalism began to replace that of assimilation, which was prevalent among the youth.” Dov Lebovtz, a brother of my great grandfather Moses Lebovitz, was a Bilu pioneer who went to Israel in 1884 to join other Bilu members living in Jaffa to do agricultural work. Later that year, he helped found the town of Gedera, the first Bilu colony. The Bilu founders believed that the time had come for Jews to not only live in Israel, but to make their living there as well. The Bilu vision of Jewish cooperative farms was eventually carried out very successfully a few decades later by the kibbutz and moshav movements. Dov Lebovitz wrote the book Ha-Moshavah Gederah (aka The Moshave of Gedera) in 1901. Berel and Manus Lebovitz, two more brothers of my great grandfather Moses Lebovitz, joined Dov in Gedera. Their father, my gg grandfather (Yehezkiel Mordechai Lebovitz), became the first rabbi of Gedera. The story is that Yehezkiel was a shoecht (ritual meat slaughter) in Vilkomir and therefore, a man taught in religion. When his sons told him there was not a rabbi in the town of Gedera, he traveled to Odessa where he was questioned by a board of three rabbis. Then by the laying on of hands, he was declared a rabbi and traveled to Gedera. On April 5, 2018, Nurit gave Lori the contact information for Gedera resident Tal Katz. Tal is the gg grandson of Dov Lebovitz. On April 8, 2018, Lori forwarded me four pictures that Tal sent to her from a history book about Gedera, one of which is a photograph of Dov Lebovitz. On April 9, 2018, Tal went to the cemetery in Gedera and e-mailed Lori eight photographs of the graves of my Lebovitz ancestors, including the grave of my gg grandfather Yehezkiel Lebovitz (Tal’s ggg grandfather). Lori forwarded the eight photographs to me. One of the grave photographs had “Rabbi Yehezkiel Mordechai, son of Rabbi Yisrael Lebovitz, son of the settlement, died October 1891” written on it. This showed me that my ggg grandfather was Rabbi Yisrael Lebovitz. My gg grandparents (Rabbi Yehezkiel Lebovitz and Leah) were Tal). Lori forwarded the photographs to me. One of the grave photographs had “Rabbi Yehezkiel Mordechai, son of Rabbi Yisrael Lebovitz, son of the settlement, died October 1891” written on it. This showed me that my ggg grandfather was Rabbi Yisrael Lebovitz. My gg grandparents (Rabbi Yehezkiel Lebovitz and Leah) were Tal’s ggg grandparents, making Tal and me third cousins, once removed. My Lebovitz family tree was growing! If it were not for a six-sentence Lebovitz story, a DNA match, my niece’s conversation with an employee at the museum in Gedera, connecting with Tal, and my determination and excitement for the upcoming Israel Heritage Celebration in Sarasota, that six-sentence story may never have been enhanced.\n\nCousin in Israel Traces Polish Roots to 1700s On July 31, 2006, two months after I received my Family Tree DNA test results, I received the following e-mail message. “Hello, My name is Oshri Naparstek and I manage my father’s kit. It sounds like we do have a connection. My ggg grandmother was Chaya Esther Naparstek (nee Klopman). She was born in Raciaz in 1828. Her father was Don (Dan) Klopman who was born is Raciaz in 1807. His father was Shmuel Klopman who was born in 1773 according to my tree. I think it is probable that Shmuel Klopman is the same Szmul Klopman (born in Drobin about 1771) in your tree.” 13 DNA Adoption Surprise On November 18, 2017, I received an e-mail message from Valerie Fuller of Arvada that we match as second or third cousins on Ancestry DNA. I responded to Valerie, but did not hear from her. I wanted to call her, but I did not have her phone number. On December 1, 2017, Lois Goldman came to my house so I could help her trace her family. That day, Lois gave me a website that listed Valerie’s telephone number. Lois helped me more than I helped her! I called Valerie and told her that my Lebovitz cousins who were tested on Ancestry DNA share DNA with her. When her DNA results listed her as 25% Jewish, she realized that her father, who was adopted, must have had one biological Jewish parent. It appeared that my maternal grandfather’s brother, who is Jewish, had a child that was placed for adoption. This child is Valerie’s father. Our conclusion is that our grandfathers were biological brothers and we share the same great grandparents (Moses Lebovitz and Nechama Kasrilzon), making Valerie and me biological second cousins. If it were not for Lois giving me the website to find telephone numbers, Valerie may never have solved the mystery as to why her DNA showed she was 25% Jewish. Discovering One’s Hidden Jewish Roots On October 9, 2022, I sent Linda Chickering an e-mail message to alert her that I share DNA with Dierdre Duewel. Linda wrote me back that it is Dierdre’s daughter Colleen Duewel who actually shares DNA with me and not Dierdre. Linda is a volunteer with Wikitree Adoption Angles working with Dierdre Duewel’s family. Dierdre’s name was listed in error rather than Colleen as the DNA test taker. Dierdre is divorced from Colleen’s father. Dierdre is trying to research her ex-husband’s family for her daughter. Deirdre’s husband was adopted and does not know anything about his heritage. He is 100% Jewish, and Colleen does not have many large matches, so her DNA has been cross-posted on My Heritage DNA and on Family Tree DNA and Ged Match to try to capture more or better matches. Kim shares 81.90 centimorgans with Colleen. Dierdre’s husband was born in Long Beach in 1937.\n\n14 From England to California On May 28, 2016, I received my Ancestry DNA results with 2,792 matches of fourth cousins or closer. That week, I e-mailed messages to many of my close matches with hopes of numerous responses. On June 2, 2016 at 2:38 a.m., Debbie Griffin responded to me from her home in Northridge that she was managing her father Sam Halpern’s Ancestry DNA kit. I responded at 6:45 a.m. At 3:43 p.m., we realized our great grandmothers were sisters. We each had a great grandmother from Vilkomir born with the last name of Kasrilzon and we had some relatives that we both knew. Debbie found a greeting card in her baby album congratulating her parents on her birth and it was signed by my grandparents Lil and Sam Lebovitz. The parents of my maternal grandfather were Moses Lebovitz and Nechama Kasrilzon. Nechama had a sister Slova Rovza Kasrilzon. Debbie is the great granddaughter of Slova. Debbie and I share the same gg grandparents (Shmuyla Kasrilzon and Goda), making us third cousins. Debbie’s e-mail message was my first response from my Ancestry DNA matches. Debbie e-mailed me the family tree of my great grandmother’s sister. Some would say this was luck that I made such a great discovery from the first person who responded. Part of it was luck, but there was an element of work done to make this occurrence happen. I sent messages to many of my DNA matches on Ancestry DNA. In addition, I have done much research on my family which helps confirm how I am related to my DNA matches. Before I connected with Debbie, John Gross and Ed Kaserzon were the only people I knew tracing Kasrilzon. John Gross, Ed Kaserzon, and I discovered each other because the three of us were listed as tracing Kasrilzon on the JewishGen Family Finder (JGFF). JGFF is a JewishGen database of ancestral towns and surnames being researched by Jewish genealogists worldwide. On February 26, 2005, I received an e-mail message from Ed Kaserzon, who was living in Israel, that he saw on the JGFF that I was researching Kasrilzon roots from Vilkomir. I spoke to Ed on the telephone when I was in Israel in the summer of 2005. Ed had just moved to Israel from South Africa. On August 5, 2008, I received an alert from JGFF researcher that John Gross had just amended a data entry for the surname Kasrilzon from Vilkomir. I contacted John. He lived in the London area and was an avid genealogist with a large family tree filled with charts and photographs. My ggg grandfather (Shlioma Kasrilzon) was John’s gggg grandfather, making us fourth cousins, once removed. Debbie, John, and I are DNA matches on Ancestry DNA. We eventually confirmed how the three of us are related, because my great grandmother, Debbie’s great grandmother, and John’s gg grandfather were on an 1858 Revision List from Vilkomir living together with their relationships listed. I found this Revision List on April 13, 2000 on the All Lithuanian Database on JewishGen, but did not realize at first that my great grandmother was on it, because her name was listed as Chana Dvora Kasrilzon. I knew my great grandmother’s middle name was Dvora, but I did not think that Chana was her first name. On December 4, 2008, John Gross explained to me the details on the 1858 online Revision List: Chana Dvora Kasrilzon (age 1) was my great grandmother; Slova Rovza Kasrilzon (age 7) was my great grandmother’s sister, and Shmuyla Girsha Kasrilzon (age 16) was his gg grandfather. Chana was another name for Nechama. On August 8, 2008, I sent John Gross an e-mail message to tell him that Ed Kaserzon was researching Kasrilzon and very quickly John determined how Ed Kaserzon fits into our family. Ed Kaserzon was a great grandson of Shmuyla Girsha Kasrilzon. Ed and I share the same ggg grandfather (Shiloma Kasrilzon), making us fourth cousins. I never met or spoke to Debbie or John. I told Debbie and John about each other via an e-mail message in the summer of 2017. Debbie invited John to her home in California. To Debbie’s delight, he visited her in October 2017 and stayed with her and her husband for two weeks. Feeling responsible for this reunion and having never met them, I hoped they would enjoy each other’s company. Happily, it was a wonderful reunion for John, Debbie, and Debbie’s extended family which included her 89-year-old father, Sam Halpern.\n\nSmall Piece of Paper Left in a Diaper Is Only Clue On July 17, 2022, I sent an e-mail message to Zuzanna Stefaniak to inform her that we share 96.4 centimorgans of DNA according to our DNA information posted on My Heritage DNA. She is from Poland. Zuzanna responded to me on August 6, 2022 as follows: “I did a DNA test because I don’t know anything about my biological family. People in my family tree are from the family that adopted me and raised me. I was born in Warsaw during the German occupation of my country, probably in late 1941 or early 1942 to a Jewish family. In order to protect my life from the Holocaust, my family gave me a protection for a young Polish woman. In the autumn of 1942, this young woman and a little girl, about 8 months old, stayed for the night at a stranger she met on the train. During the occupation, it was forbidden to be outside the house after the curfew, and this stranger lived near the train station in Praga, 35 Szwedzka Street, m 34. The next day, the woman left the house, leaving me with Rozalia Paciorek. The only information was a small piece of paper left in a diaper with the words ‘Helenka baptized’. ‘Helenka’ or ‘Helen’ in English. Since Mrs. Paciorek had 3 of her children, she took me to the police station, and from there I was taken to an orphanage run by Catholic nuns at 75 Nowogrodzka Street in Warsaw. There I was registered under the number 859/1942, given the surname Celewska Helena and the date of birth on January 12, 1942. I know that after the war my biological mother was looking for me. She came with the policeman to Mrs. Paciorek, but found out that I had been placed in an orphanage. A few years later, around 1948, my biological father (he was a military man) was looking for me, but at that time I was already in another family. I was taken to my new family on May 15, 1943. My parents enrolled me in the Catholic church parish as their child. Since I was loved by my foster parents, when someone from the orphanage came to them after the war, my foster father asked that my real father be told that I had died. With Regards Zuzanna Stefaniak” On August 7, she wrote more as follows: “In 1939-1948 in Warsaw or in the immediate vicinity of Warsaw. I, too, have lived in Warsaw all my life. After taking the DNA test, I only received 2% or less of my inheritance lists of related persons. I have sent all of them the letters on the list and now await an answer.” 15\n\n16 Cousins Meet in Portland, Oregon Around 2010, I was in touch with Patricia Rice (nee Klopman born 1966 in France) because someone researching Klopman gave me her contact information. I spoke to Patricia on the telephone and she snail mailed me photographs of her Klopman relatives. At that time, I did not know if or how Patricia was related to me. In 2015, I spotted the name Gilles Klopman on a Temple Emanu-El Shabbat handout which listed people who had recently passed away. His name was listed by request of temple member Abe Zeewy even though Gilles was not a temple member. At that time, I did not know if or how Gilles was related to me. During the pandemic, I was determined to see if Patricia and Gilles were related to me. I looked carefully at all of my charts and reviewed documents that I had accumulated. In April 2020, I discovered how I was related to Patricia and Gilles. On December 5, 2020, I saw on Ancestry DNA that I share DNA with Madeleine Senkal (nee Klopman born 1945 in Belgium) and contacted her. She responded the next day with her telephone number. I called her and she told me that she was the sister of Gilles Klopman. Madeleine told me that her brother Gilles owned a place in Sarasota for the winter months. She told me that her daughter Morgan was interested in learning more about her roots. Madeleine gave Morgan my e-mail address. On January 2, 2021, Madeleine’s daughter Morgan Senkal sent me an e-mail message that she is interested in learning more about her Klopman roots. Because I know that Patricia and Morgan live in Portland, Oregon, I wrote the following to them, “Hi Morgan and Patricia, The three of us are KLOPMAN/KLAPMAN cousins (see attachment and look closely at what is in red). Both of you live in Portland, Oregon area. I have never met either of you, but hopefully some day we will all get to meet. Happy New Year. Your Cousin, Kim.” They met because of me and got together several times during the pandemic. Madeleine and Patricia never heard of each other until I told them about each other. Madeleine called me on July 1, 2021 to say that she traveled from her home in Manchester, New Hampshire to Portland, Oregon to visit her daughter Morgan in June 2021 and visited Patricia Rice and Patricia’s mother. Patricia’s mother spoke only French and Hebrew. Madeleine spoke French with Patricia’s mother. Madeleine stayed at Patricia’s house for seven hours, because they were having so much fun! Madeleine said that Patricia made the best food she ever had. I am so happy because Madeleine told me that her daughter Morgan now has Patricia as a friend who happens to be her cousin. Morgan is thrilled to have a family member in town because she had no family in town.\n\n17 In July 1993, I submitted a death certificate request form for Pincus Jaffe on which I stated that his death was 1922 or 1923 and his place of death was Chicago. Within a week, I received, from the Illinois Vital Records Office, the death certificate for Samuel Jaffe who passed away on May 5, 1923 in Chicago with my great grandmother Mary’s signature and address as the informant. I discovered his address, his father’s name (Morris Jaffe), his mother’s name (Lena Berman), his birthplace (Russia), his year of birth (1850), his death date (May 23, 1923), and his Americanized name (Samuel Jaffe). Until I found this photograph, I did not know that my gg grandfather had immigrated to the United States. Until I found my gg grandfather’s death certificate, I did not know the names of any of my ggg grandparents. It is amazing what one photograph’s caption can reveal! But the story does not end here! I eventually discovered that my ggg grandfather Morris Jaffe was born in 1826 and died in 1914 and that he immigrated to the United States and settled in New York City. I obtained a photograph of my ggg grandfather Morris Jaffe. And I discovered that his father was Israel Jaffe. Label “Grandpa” Is Worth 1,000 Words As a young girl growing up in the Chicago area, I visited Mom and Pop (my maternal grandparents Lil and Sam) and Bubbie (my maternal grandmother’s mother Mary) every Sunday afternoon. As a child, I knew that my grandmother Lil was born in Chicago and that my great grandmother Mary was born in the old country. Lil passed away in 1975 and Mary in 1962. My mother Phyllis and my grandmother’s brother Ed helped me with whatever they could remember about the ancestry of Lil and Mary. They told me that Mary was the first ancestor in her line to immigrate to the United States and that she came from Panevezys. I obtained her death certificate which stated that her father was Pincus Yaffe. I obtained her ship manifest and it stated that she came to the United States in 1898. At that time, I had no idea where or when Mary’s parents passed away. In 1993, eighteen years after my grandmother Lil passed away, I became extremely interested in tracing my family. I was at a roadblock. I could not obtain any records from Lithuania. I was not able to trace any farther back than Mary’s father. No one in Mary’s family could help me. I remembered that I had an old family album that belonged to my grandmother Lil. I started to look at the photographs. I saw a black and white photograph glued on a black page with white writing that stated, “Harry, Ma, Grandpa, Me, Ed, 4/23/22, Douglas Park.” This suggested to me that this photograph was taken in Douglas Park (in Chicago) on April 23, 1922 with Lil’s brother (Harry), Lil’s mother (Mary), Grandpa, Lil, and Lil’s brother (Ed). My heart skipped a beat. Was Grandpa actually Mary’s father? Was Mary’s father alive and living in Chicago in 1922?\n\n18 touch with a Schontal family in Australia. I remember as a small child receiving a stuffed koala bear, which I still have. I am the eldest of three children. My brother is two years younger and my sister 18 years younger. My brother is married and has four children, lives in Kent in England and my sister is married with one child and expecting a second, lives in Israel. I live in France since 1982, lived in Ottawa from 1974 to 1982 and right now live in Grasse, near Nice. My parents live in Glasgow where my grandmother is in a retirement home. I look forward to hearing from you and will pass on any messages you send to my mother, as she does not have a computer. I do not speak or read Polish I am sorry to say, only English and French. Nina” On November 14, 2000, I received the following e-mail message from Simon. “Bullseye and Bingo!” was in the subject line. “Dear Kim, Dear Nina, I owe you both yet another apology!! I have now found the stuff you, Kim, sent me four whole years ago AND I have found my own material on the Schontals, including a tree you, Nina, wrote together with Gina Schontal in the early 1970s. Guess what: I could have confirmed four years ago that you are related to each other! Kim, your Dov (Berish) Sheintal I had all along as Bernard, son of Moses. Moses was a brother of Aron, Nina’s gg grandfather! I am enclosing both a GEDCOM and a family history report of my information………All the best, Simon” Since those letters, I am in contact with the Sheintal family in Australia. I exchanged photographs, e-mail messages, and telephone calls with Nina. After Nina and I discovered our Sheintal connection, Nina convinced her mother, Marion Schontal Camrass, to write about the Sheintal family during the 1920s thru the 1940s. Marion and my husband Jon share gg grandparents (Icyk Sheintal and Rifka Blady), making Marion and Jon third cousins. In Marion’s story was mention of my husband’s father, Sol Sheintal, and Sol’s brothers. Sol passed away in 1994, but I was able to read the story to my mother-in-law, Rose Sheintal. So much in the story was familiar to Rose. Rose did not know that Sol’s first cousin Wicek had children that survived the Holocaust. Simon is descended from Jon’s ggg grandparents (Chaim Zylberstajn and Estera Majerczyk). Zylberstajn eventually became Srebrny. It was not until March 27, 2022, that Simon wrote this in an e-mail message “My grandfather is Jakob Herszel Srebrny, b. 20 Jan 1889, quite low down on the left.” that finally showed me how my husband is related to Simon. Simon and Jon share the same gggg grandparents (Chaim Szlama Zylbersztajn and Ester a Majorczyk) making them fifth cousins. I Finally Have an E-Mail Address Because I did not have a computer in 1996, I often used computers at the library to find people on the JewishGen Family Finder (JGFF) who were tracing the same surnames as me. I snail mailed my family trees to people. I posted the surnames that I was searching on JGFF with my telephone number, because I did not have an e-mail address. After Simon Srebrny saw my Sheintal posting on JGFF, he left a telephone message in October 1996 from Germany. He said that Nina Camrass was researching Sheintal/Schontal. I snail mailed Simon my Sheintal family tree. He said he would send me Nina’s address when he found it. In December 1999, I got my first computer and added my e-mail address to the JGFF. On November 7, 2000, I received the following e-mail message from Simon. “Dear Kim and Nina, I owe you a big apology! I had told you a couple of years ago, Kim, that I would forward the very interesting material you sent me about your Sheintals from Dzialoszyce to my Schontals from Dzialoszyce, namely Nina in Grasse and her mother Marion in Glasgow. And Nina, I had promised you would get them soon many months ago. The problem is I CAN’T FIND THOSE PAPERS! I am very sorry!! I guess my daughter may have hidden them in jest years back or I am just even more disorganized than I realized. But now that I have seen your name and e-mail address on JewishGen, Kim, I can at least put the two of you in touch with each other. I can also provide you both with the information I have gathered so far on the Schontals, either as text or as GEDCOM. It isn’t much, I am afraid. Please keep me posted! As a manic mishpochologist, I always wanted to know everything about kin and kin of kin and kin of kin of kin. All the best and again, sorry! Simon” On November 11, 2000, I received the following e-mail message from Nina. “Dear Kim, I often asked my Mother – I wonder what happened to Simon and the news of the Schontal family he said he was sending – well now I know. I just found Simon’s messages and phoned my mother to tell her. She tells me that she only knows that her father was called Wicek Schontal, his father was called Gershon Schontal, born probably around 1878. Gershon married Dina Eisenberg. They were both very young at the time. Dina Eisenberg was the daughter of Hannah Srebrny and Benjamin Eisenberg. The sister of Wicek, Gina Schontal, is my great aunt. It seems that in Israel, Mother has met some Schontal family (my grandmother, Inka, who married Wicek, lived in Natanya for many years) and even went to the wedding of the daughter who unfortunately died only a few years after her wedding. This family moved to Israel in 1920s probably. Gina was in\n\nOnline Photograph Leads to Big Discovery About 1999, someone saw that I had posted on the JewishGen Family Finder that I was researching family from Berislav and asked about my family. I e-mailed this person a photograph with the following message. “This is a photo of my great grandfather Joseph Contorer in front of his shoe store in Chicago. He is pictured with his wife (my great grandmother Mary Jaffe Contorer) and their children. My great grandfather Joseph Contorer was born in Berislav on January 3, 1867 according to his death certificate. His father, Jacob Contorer, had some position of authority there (supposedly a magistrate of some sort)...” This person surprised me by turning my words and photograph into a link on the JewishGen ShetLinks (now known as KehilaLinks) website. No one commented on this link until Gavriel Shapiro, Professor of Comparative and Russian Literature at Cornell University in Ithaca, spotted my link on June 2, 2014. Gavriel sent me the following e-mail message. “I have been conducting research about my family. My maternal great-great grandfather, Yaakov Kontorer, attorney-at-law, hailed from Berislav. His daughter, Enta-Reiza (1858- 1934), is my great grandmother. I remember my grandmother Sara, her daughter, telling me that Enta-Reiza’s brother or brothers immigrated to Chicago in the late nineteenth century. I presume your great grandfather Joseph and my great grandmother Enta-Reiza were siblings. I thought perhaps you might be interested to know. Sincerely, Gavriel Shapiro” Exactly one year later on June 2, 2015, Gavriel sent me a photograph from his mother’s family archives. This was a photograph of two of my grandparents, two of my great grandparents, and two of my great uncles. Gavriel and I share the same gg grandfather (Yaakov Contorer), making Gavriel and me third cousins. In August 2016, Gavriel Shapiro mailed me a copy of his book, Thanksgiving All Year Round: A Memoir. Our gg grandfather, Yaakov Contorer, is described in his book along with his 1885 photograph here. 19\n\n20 Newsletter Article Draws Attention I wrote an article about my Klapman roots from Raciaz in the fall 2006 issue of Mishpochology (Jewish Genealogical Society of Southwest Florida newsletter). No one commented on that article until I received an e-mail message on November 2, 2015 from Scott Vinegar who lives in Bellaire as follows. “My name is Scott Vinegar and I was doing research on my family tree for seven years. Three weeks ago, I just broke the brick wall and my relatives is Yankieliewicz. I found out that this family came from Plonsk but I believe this family is from Raciaz a long time ago. I believe my ggg grandfather name is Isaac Yankieliewicz. When I was looking for the pictures on JewishGen posts, I was surprised that Isaac’s death certificate said his mother name was Sura Kliopman. When I typed Klopman and Raciaz on Google, I saw your Jewish Genealogy Group of Florida which you explained your story of Klopman from Raciaz. I was very excited and I thought we could be cousins.” On November 10, 2015, Scott solved how we are related to one another on the Klapman line. He told me that Johel Klopman had three sons: Szmul Klopman, Szymon Klopman, and Berek Klopman. My ggg grandfather Szmul Klopman was his ggggg grandfather, making Scott and me fourth cousins, twice removed. I first met Maxine Klapman Brownstone around 2000 when she came from Winnipeg with her husband to visit me in Sarasota. We knew we were cousins, but we did not know how we were related. Her father used to come to Chicago to visit my cousin Ely Klapman who owned Dad’s Root Beer. I saw Maxine again in 2009 when she was living as a snowbird in Naples. Still, we did not know how we were related. On December 3, 2015, Scott sent me an e-mail message that he found the birth record for Josek Berek “Joseph” Klopman born in 1879 in Raciaz and his parents’ names were Aaron Klopman and Faiga Makower. He found Aaron’s 1880 death record and it said his parents’ names were Majer Klopman and Chaia Sosi Jacobowicz. He told me that my grandfather Morris and Maxine’s grandfather Josek “Joseph” were third cousins. On August 10, 2017, Scott discovered the names of the siblings of my great grandmother Zlata Szwarcbort. Scott solved many genealogy brick walls and continues to update our Klapman family tree. On April 7, 2020, Scott e-mailed me a 160-page Klapman family tree. Genealogical Research Requires Patience Good things come to people who wait. Nine years after I wrote an article in the Jewish Genealogical Society of Southwest Florida newsletter, Scott Vinegar connected with me. Over ten years after my ShtetLinks posting, Gavriel Shapiro connected with me. Both of these connections were high moments among my genealogy surprises, but hearing from Irma Fisher was an even bigger surprise. In April 1999, I sent an e-mail message to Irma Fisher in which I asked her about her Lebovitz family. I told her to respond to my friend Susan Meyer’s e-mail, because I did not have an e-mail address at that time. On April 14, 2014, Susan received an e-mail message from Irma stating that she did not believe we are related and hopes that I succeed in my research. I immediately responded to Irma with my e-mail address and asked her why it took her so long to respond. As of 2022, I have not heard back from Irma. The mystery is more about why it took fifteen years for her to respond to my e-mail message rather than whether or not we are related.\n\n21 Special Letters Discovered My father passed away on April 26, 2007. My mother passed away on July 20, 2017. As my sister and I sorted their memorabilia on August 7, 2017, we found two letters. One letter was a rough draft of a letter that our father was preparing to write to Sam Klapman on January 29, 1985; the other was the actual letter that our father received from Sam Klapman to our father on March 1, 1985. I knew that our family had Klapman cousins in Canada, but I had no idea how I was related to them. I heard that my first cousin Howie Klapman met a Klapman from Canada that he did not know when he was at a restaurant in California. Howie gave the name Klapman to the hostess and another Klapman couple (Sam and Ruth) also gave the name Klapman to the hostess. So when the hostess at the restaurant said, “Klapman, your table is ready” both Klapman couples went to the hostess to be seated. The two Klapman couples introduced themselves to one another, but did not know if they were related. Sam and his wife were visiting California from Canada. Howie and his wife were visiting California from Illinois. Finding these two letters was exciting for me. It confirmed what I heard over 30 years before that. It amazed us that our father saved hundreds of letters. My sister and I looked at the large pile of letters, but did not read all of the letters. In fact, we threw away most of the letters without reading them. I am so glad these two particular letters caught my eye. In 2015, my cousin Scott Vinegar explained to me how my father was related to Sam Klapman. Sam and my father Aaron Klapman have the same ggg grandparents (Johel Klopman and Cyrla) My father and Sam were fourth cousins. I saved these two letters and typed the letters as follows. Dear Sam, Hello! My nephew Howard Klapman called me several days ago to tell me that he met you and your wife in California. Naturally with the name Klapman I thought I would write you. Some little history: My father Morris Klapman and my mother Lena came from Poland around 1914 to Chicago. My father was in the Russian Army. Later two of his brothers Benjamin (wife Jenny) and Sam (wife Sarah) followed to Chicago. Benjamin and Jenny have 4 sons (Alex, Frank, Joe, and Martin) and 2 daughters. They in turn had children and grandchildren. Sam and Sarah had 2 daughters (Ruth and Rose) and in turn had children and grandchildren. My father Morris and my mother Lena had 5 sons (Simon, Harry, David, Aaron and James) and 2 daughters (Diane and Esther). My brother Simon never married. The rest of us did and we have 2 or 3 children each plus children and grandchildren. All of us live in the suburbs of Chicago, except for my sister Diane who lives in Philadelphia. My oldest daughter Kimberly Sheintal lives with her husband Jonathan and 2 daughters in Sarasota, Florida since 1971. Her in-laws also live in Sarasota, as they left Israel in 1946 to settle in America. My son-in-law Jon was born in Israel in 1946 and came over to the USA when he was several months old. My youngest daughter Elizabeth is single, works at Bell Lab, and lives in Chicago. I am 63 years old and my wife Phyllis is 56 years. I have been retired 2 ½ years. My wife went back to college and after 21 years as a speech pathologist will retire in June. We plan to make our permanent residence at our place in Longboat Key, Florida (adjacent to Sarasota). When I went in the army during World War II, I never knew that my father had 3 nieces (who lived in London), so when I went overseas to Great Britain and Europe during the war I met them and their respective family. I’m really not much in for writing as is my daughter Kim but I wanted to write you. Happy New Year to your wife and family. Respectfully, Aaron Klapman January 29, 1985\n\n22 I saved the letter that Sam wrote and I saved the draft letter that my father wrote. On May 4, 2020, I was surprised again when I found the letter that my father wrote to tell me that he was writing to Sam. Dear Aaron, How wonderful it was to receive your letter and to hear from the Klapmans south of the border. It was real exciting to accidentally meet with Howard and his wife Annie and I hope that in the not too distant future our families will meet again, and there will always be nice things to talk about. Aaron, I am the youngest in our family of our immigrated parents so that I don’t have too much information about what took place in the old country. However, over the years regular tales have been told. My father Joseph Klapman, who passed away 26 years ago emigrated from Plodzk Poland to Canora Saskatchewan (in Canada) in 1912. When he left Poland, he left behind his wife Malke and 3 children, Harry, Esther, and Meyer. While he was in Canada his wife Malke passed away in Poland. Very shortly after his oldest son Harry (now deceased) came over to Canada, and within a short period of time his daughter Esther who is also deceased, and then shortly after his son Meyer came to Canada, who thank God is alive and well. Meyer today is 74 years young and the late Harry and Esther were each about 2 years older. Because of winter vacation time, I have not yet been able to talk to Meyer about receiving your letter. In Canada my father married Fanny Rosensweig of Winnipeg, who already had 2 daughters, Esther and Beverley, and together they had 3 sons. The oldest Max who is 64, Mickey 61, and I just had my 54th birthday. All of my brothers and sisters had children and now beautiful grandchildren. Ruth and I have 4 children, 3 beautiful daughters, 33 years, 30 years, and 24 years and of course our only son Hartley who is 27. We are fortunate in having 4 beautiful grandsons ranging from 9 years old to 5 days old. Ruth and myself fortunately are regular travelers besides spending part of the winters in Palm Springs. In our travels Aaron, we no doubt will make it a point to visit in your area as it sure will be a pleasure to meet and acquaint ourselves with you, your wife, and your mishpocha. With kindest regards, Sam Klapman March 1, 1985\n\n23 My Family Has Connection to Prominent Rabbi As a young child, my paternal grandmother boasted about our family’s connection to Rabbi Baal Shem Tov. At the time, I did not know much about Rabbi Baal Shem Tov. When I became interested in genealogy, I hoped to discover my connection to Rabbi Baal Shem Tov. On February 13, 2000, I saw on the Jewish Records Indexing-Poland link on JewishGen that the maiden name of my gg grandmother was Taub. This was the first I heard the name Taub in my family. On July 23, 2003, I saw on JewishGen Family Finder that Michael Taub from Australia was researching Taub from Raciaz. I sent the following e-mail message to him. “Dear Michael, I saw your listing on JewishGen today. I see you are searching the Taub family from Raciaz. I only have some vague information about my Taub family. My ggg grandfather is Hersz Taub. His daughter (my gg grandmother) was Chaia Mouhla Taub. Chaia Mouhla Taub married Berek Szwarcbork (my gg grandfather) in 1840. I think that these people lived in Raciaz Poland. Do any of these names sound familiar to anything that you have? Recently, I learned that my family had a connection to Rabbi Samuel Elijah Taub from Zwolen. I learned of this connection from a man named Hershy Schwarc who is in the process of finalizing a book about this Rabbi. Please send me some information about your Taub family from Raciaz. I also have Klapman, Matis, and Szwarcbort roots from Raciaz. Thank you. Kimberly Klapman Sheintal” On July 23, 2003, Michael sent the following e-mail message to me. “Dear Kimberly, Let me describe you briefly the Polish Taub genealogy as much as I know. Shlomo Zalman Taub was a student of the Baal Shem Tov. He was born in Raciaz. He had four sons (Zwi Hirsh, Dov Bear, Zev Wolf and Arje Leib). All four names represent names of animals, deer, bear, wolf, and lion respectively. Apparently, according to Hershy Schwarc’s Hebrew write up, Shlomo Zalman attended a wedding but did not dance and appeared to be very sad. The Baal Shem Tov saw this and asked him about his sadness, to which Shlomo Zalman replied, ‘How could I be happy when I have no sons.’ The Baal Shem Tov blessed him saying, ‘Be happy and dance like an animal and you will have sons!’ Eventually, four were born and gave them names of animals!” On August 30. 2004, Michael Taub reminded me of Hershy Schwarc’s book about a Rabbi Taub of Zwolen. I had the pages about my family translated into English and learned more about my Taub ancestors. Shlomo Zalman Taub, my ggggg grandfather, was a student of Rabbi Baal Shem Tov (founder of Hasidic Judaism).\n\n24 My Great Grandmother’s Mother Lived in USA I began tracing my family in 1982 and frequently add names to my family tree. Because only one of my grandparents was born in the United States, most of my research is with Russian, Polish, and Lithuanian records. My only grandparent born in the United States was Lil Lebovitz (nee Contorer). Her mother (my great grandmother), Mary Contorer (nee Jaffe), came to the United States in 1898 at age 26. Mary got married shortly after arriving in United States and settled in Chicago. Jeanne Behrman Wax helped with my Jaffe family research. She spotted my Jaffe listing on JewishGen Family Finder in December 2004 and sent me an e-mail message. Over the years, I learned that Mary’s father Pincus Jaffe (my gg grandfather) and Mary’s grandfather Morris Jaffe (my ggg grandfather) came to the United States. I do not have the ship manifest for Morris, but I have a 1912 photograph of him taken in New York City. Until May 1, 2006 when I received an e-mail message from Jeanne, I thought their wives never came to the United States. Jeanne wrote, “I found something amazing on Ellis Island….1901 arrived Elke age 14, Esther age 16, and mother Chaya Sore, going to Chicago to join husband/ father Pincus Jaffe! What do you think?” I was thrilled to receive this e-mail message, because my great grandmother Mary had a sister Elke, a sister Esther, and a father Pincus. No one in my family mentioned that my gg grandmother came to the United States. Jeanne and I have since confirmed our Jaffe connection. My ggggg grandparents (Pinkus Jaffe and Khana Atkats) were Jeanne’s ggg grandparents, making Jeanne and me fourth cousins, twice removed. (My gg grandfather was named Pincus Jaffe with a “c”.) We share our Jaffe roots in Panevezys with several Berman cousins marrying our Jaffe cousins. Coincidentally, my daughter Liana’s roommate in college in 1999 was Jenne Wax who is related to Jeanne’s husband. My Great Grandmother Married Her Cousin I contacted Alec Ferretti from Bellmore on September 3, 2011 when I noticed he was tracing Taub on the JewishGen Family Finder. On November 20, 2014, Alec explained to me that my ggg grandparents, Herz Taub and Rayza Klopman, were his ggggg grandparents, making us fourth cousins, twice removed. On March 19, 2015, Alec told me that my great grandmother Zlata Szwarcbort married Joel Szyia Klopman (her first cousin, once removed). Rayza’s granddaughter Zlata married Israel Iciek Klopman’s son Joel Szyia Klopman. Rayza was the sister of Israel Iciek Klopman. I am glad that in 2011, I e-mailed 16-year-old budding genealogist Alec who discovered numerous genealogical details about our Klapman and Taub families going back to the late 1600s. On January 19, 2020, I attended a DNA lecture in Sarasota by Lara Diamond, an accomplished genealogist from Baltimore. I told her about my genealogy successes because of help from my cousin Alec Ferretti. She got excited, because she knew Alec. She told me that Alec is a highly respected genealogist lecturer and she had just spoken to him that morning!\n\n25 Are We Really Cousins? Everyone has brick walls in their genealogical research. One of my brick walls involved my cousin Lenora from Birmingham and then Atlanta. She came to many of the Klapman family celebrations. She knew most of my Klapman grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. She called me periodically to hear the family news. When I started to trace my Klapman family tree, I asked Lenora how she is related to me and her answer was, “I don’t know.” For most people tracing their family, this is not a satisfactory answer. In 1996, I asked her how she thought we were related, and she mentioned that her father came to United States at age 17 from Raciaz in about 1898. She thought he had two brothers and a sister who never came to the United States. Lenora’s father was Harry Stein and her mother was Yetta Kalski. She told me what cities he lived in while in the United States, who he married, a list of his siblings, and how he always talked about his time spent with my Klapman grandparents. She sent me a copy of her parents’ marriage document. However, we never figured our connection. On November 15, 2009, I received a phone call from Lenora’s niece Teri Stein Beckoff (Lenora’s brother’s daughter) who asked me if I could help her son with his immigrant ancestor school project. I was able to help her niece with some details that she did not know about her family. Now I had Teri on board to help me solve my Lenora brick wall mystery. Teri told me Harry Stein’s father was David Bernstein. I was not able to tell Teri how we were related to one another. On September 14, 2010, Teri left a message on my answering machine to let me know that the wife of David is Merka Klopman. I immediately looked at my Klapman family tree and saw Merka Klopman married to David Borensztein. Eventually, the surname was changed to Stein. No children were listed on my family tree. Merka Klopman was the great granddaughter of Johel Klopman. Teri and I were the gggg granddaughters of Johel Klopman, making Teri and me fifth cousins. My gggg grandparents (Johel Klopman and Cyrli Jakubowicz) were Lenora’s ggg grandparents, making Lenora and me fourth cousins, once removed. Thanks to Teri, I know how I am related to Lenora.\n\n26 Flora Aronson Gursky from Falls Church was very helpful in tracing my Klapman family and yet we are so distantly connected on the family tree that it is hard to explain. My correspondence with Flora began in April 1999 when I sent an e-mail message to Flora after spotting her name on the JewishGen Family Finder as someone tracing Klapman from Raciaz. That day, I was in New Orleans visiting my daughter Mara who was in college. As she sat in bed with a cold, I used her computer. This was a luxury for me, because I did not have a computer. Flora volunteered on JewishGen to help raise money for Raciaz genealogists. I mailed her $100 for which she was grateful. This was the best $100 I ever spent! Shortly after Flora and I connected, she asked me to e-mail her my Klapman family tree, because I did not have a computer. All of my Klapman family charts were handwritten on scratch paper. I photocopied all of my charts and snail mailed them to her. Less than one week later, there was a big surprise in my mailbox. Flora had typed all of my notes into a genealogy software program. This was over 20 pages, single-spaced, and easy to read. I was very excited that day! Over the years, I sent her more information and she typed all of it for me. She encouraged me to add stories to the names, dates, and places. On January 15, 2009, Flora and I met in Naples. We each came with a surprise. She brought Nannette Clapman Blinchikoff with her. Nannette was researching Clapman roots. I brought Maxine Klapman Brownstone with me. Maxine was tracing the Klapman family who settled in Canada. There was Flora from Falls Church, Nannette from Pikesville, Maxine from Winnipeg, and me from Sarasota. This reunion was my reward for years of researching my Klapman family. In 2015, my cousin Scott Vinegar explained how I am related to Maxine. In the spring of 2020, I discovered how Maxine, Nannette, and I are related to each other. Maxine, Nannette, and I share the same gggg grandparents (Johel Klopman and Cyrla), making Nannette, Maxine, and me fifth cousins. It was not until July 8, 2015 that my cousin Alec Ferretti explained my connection to Flora. Johel Klopman (my ggggg grandfather) had a daughter Brayna Klopman who married Hersz Reybek and it was from this line where Flora’s ggg grandfather comes into the family tree. Johel Klopman had son Szmul Klopman (my gggg grandfather) and this was where I come into Flora’s family tree. The ggg grandfather of Flora was Aron Lewin Bernbaum. My father’s father’s mother’s mother’s mother’s father’s sister’s daughter’s daughter’s husband’s father’s father was Aron Lewin Bernbaum. As an aside, my cousin Marvin Kane married Flora’s cousin Regina Bernbaum. (In explaining Flora’s relationship, Johel Klopman was my ggggg grandfather and Szmul Klopman was my gggg grandfather. It should be noted that Johel Klopman was also my gggg grandfather and Szmul Klopman was also my ggg grandfather, because of cousins marrying cousins.) Flora and I share cousins, but we are not related. However, connecting with Flora was my best genealogical discovery! Three months before my daughter Mara’s 2006 wedding to Matt, Flora encouraged me to work on updating the Klapman family tree. I was busy remodeling two bedrooms for out-of-town guests and arranging a week’s worth of wedding festivities. Flora sent me 33 pages to proof. I proofed the 33 pages to the best of my ability and mailed back to Flora. Flora responded on June 5, 2006 with “I have been able to add lots more details and, of course, I now have more questions. I would like to include dates and cities of birth, death and marriages and so – can $100 Investment\n\n27 I ask you to fill in some of the blanks for yourself and your family...?” What do I do? My daughter is getting married in less than ten weeks; I have so much more to do for the wedding. I decided to answer Flora’s questions. Throughout June and July, I received more questions from Flora. Then she suggested that I contact more people within the 33 pages and get details of their immediate families. I enjoyed contacting distant cousins and learning about my family. I figured I could work on this leisurely and finish in more detail after the wedding. Then Flora had the idea that we fix up the 33 pages as best we can so that I can give the papers to all of the Klapman family at the wedding. What do I do? I have so much to do for the wedding. I decided to go for it. Flora graciously typed a revised booklet with 59 pages. I distributed the booklets to the Klapman relatives at the wedding. This booklet would never have been possible without Flora. In the three months before the wedding, I e-mailed many cousins and prospective cousins. I learned that my ggggg grandfather was Johel Klopman. I discovered three siblings of my great grandfather Joel Szyia Klopman. I was able to confirm that Joel Syzia Klopman was the son of Israel Iciek Klopman. I received a wedding photograph with a large group of my cousins from England and Israel whom I never met. About a week before the wedding, Flora suggested I snail mail letters to all the Klopmans in Israel. I mailed 24 letters to Israel the week before the wedding. During the month following the wedding, I discovered many Klopman cousins in Israel. The number of people in my Klapman tree increases each year. Flora inspired me to stay in contact with my relatives and potential relatives around the world. My hunt to find more Klapman cousins continues! Journal Inspiration On September 3, 2011, I e-mailed ten people on the JewishGen Family Finder researching Taub, among them was David Ellis from Natick. Until I contacted David, I never heard of him. Shortly after I contacted David, we realized that my ggggg grandparents (Shlomo Zalman Taub and Bajla) were his gggggg grandparents, making David and me sixth cousins, once removed. On April 12, 2016, Lois Goldman asked me for genealogy guidance. I suggested looking at family trees posted on JewishGen. I demonstrated this and discovered a tree posted on JewishGen by my cousin David Ellis. I e-mailed him the following. “Hi David. I was looking at the family trees posted on JewishGen and I saw your tree. I am checking in with some of my cousins doing research on Taub to see if anyone has made any strides in research recently. I have made strides on my Klapman line recently, but no new additions to my Taub line. I have the charts showing how we are descended from Shlomo Zalman Taub. Have you made any recent additions on the Taub line? Kim” On April 13, 2016, he responded to me. “I’ve written a Microsoft Word document describing my research, specifically what I’ve learned about my ancestors and how I learned it. It’s 115 pages, but my section on the TAUB branch is quite sketchy, only two pages. If you are interested in some definitely NOT light reading, I could send you a copy. David J. Ellis” If I had not written to David that day, I might never have received his “Story of My Family Tree Research” document. David’s document was my inspiration to write this journal.\n\n28 First Friends, Then Cousins Several people I know have turned out to be my cousins. I develop a closer bond to these people after I discover we are related and an even deeper bond develops when I learn that these newly found cousins are interested in genealogy. It was not a surprise when my mother Phyllis, my cousins (Susan Klein, Kari Wulfsohn, Nancy Lee Theodore, Dori Jacobs, Shirley Homer, Rachel Perlman, Steven Latshaw, John Gross, Scott Vinegar), and my Aunt Esther appeared as my DNA matches on Ancestry.com and/or Family Tree DNA. In the cases of John and Scott who were more distant cousins, I was happy to see them as matches to confirm that we were in fact related. I was very surprised to see matches with people that I knew but had no idea were related to me. As of now, I have not been able to determine how I am related to any of these surprise matches, but I still consider them my cousins. On June 21, 2018, when Jewish Genealogical Society of Southwest Florida member Leah Cook was looking to find the Stein relatives for her cousin Leah Urso, Cook did a triangulation for Leah Urso on GEDmatch and discovered that her cousin Leah Urso shared an ancestor with me. Lucky for me, Urso was coming to Sarasota from Israel shortly after she made that discovery in July 2018. Cook, Urso, and I met for lunch on July 5, 2018. Urso and I match as closer DNA cousins than Urso and Cook. Leah Cook is not the only Jewish Genealogical Society of Southwest Florida member who matches my DNA – so do Lee Kichen, Felice Hedge, Howard Finkel, and Diane Arch. I share DNA with Elise Friedman, JewishGen’s DNA Projects Coordinator, who lectured on DNA in Sarasota in 2008 conference that I attended. My DNA match Ann Rabinowitz, Kupiskis coordinator on JewishGen KehilaLinks, attended the same Jewish Genealogical Society of Palm Beach County luncheon as me in 2004. My DNA match Elias Savada participated in the AOL Jewish Genealogy Chats with me and chaired the 2011 International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies in Washington, DC. Elise, Ann, and Eli are wellknown and respected among genealogists. Hopefully, someday I will discover how I am related to them.\n\n29 First Jewish Person in Sarasota-Manatee Every life is full of twists and turns, some the result of conscious or unconscious decisions the individual makes and others brought about by accident or destiny, if you believe in fate. In my efforts to learn more about the history of Jews in Sarasota-Manatee, the subject of the book, Jews of SarasotaManatee, I wrote in 2012, I have learned that the historian’s path is also full of twists and turns, leading me in unexpected directions and often to surprising facts and insights. That was certainly the case as I struggled to pin down the most basic fact imaginable about local Jewish history - when did a Jewish person first arrive here? Sources I used for my book led me to believe that the first Jewish person in the two-county region settled in Sarasota in 1913. And that was what I thought until I met Phyllis Grajeck, a woman who happened to be visiting the Manatee County Public Library in downtown Bradenton when I was doing research there on May 18, 2013. Phyllis is not Jewish. We talked about local history and I told her of my interest in Sarasota-Manatee Jewish history. She shared a story about a marker she saw while at Emerson Point Park in Palmetto. At Emerson Point Park, the history of many of the people that lived there is written on markers on the top of an old Indian mound. On one marker, Phyllis read about a Palmetto woman who was Jewish and had owned a candy store in Chicago with her husband, who was not Jewish. She read that the couple drowned in a river in Palmetto. For almost a year, I tried to find out the name of the couple and when they lived in Palmetto, but I had no success until January 2014. On January 19, 2014, I attended a Sarasota Jewish Chorale performance directed by Linda Tucker. Linda, who is not Jewish, is from Palmetto. I asked her if she ever heard of a Jewish woman in Palmetto who drowned in a river. Linda did not know about this woman, but suggested I ask her mother, Lenore Stewart, who loves Palmetto history. Lenore put me in touch with Ken Burton. Although Ken was not Jewish, he knew much about Palmetto history and solved the mystery about the couple who drowned in the river. Peter Marine married Golden Fonseca on December 21, 1887 in Boston. Peter was born in Spain in 1852 and was not Jewish. His wife was born in Boston area in 1860 and was Jewish. Her parents were from London. Peter and Golden moved from Boston to Chicago. In 1909, they moved from Chicago to Palmetto. While living in Chicago, they started Marine Candy Company and sold it to Fanny Farmer Candy Company in 1900. On January 8, 1910, Peter and Golden purchased an Indian mound and the adjoining 363 acres in Palmetto. The land the Marine family had on Palmetto’s Snead Island is now called Emerson Point Park. To enhance his land, Peter planted parallel rows of royal palms from the base of the mound almost to the river’s edge. He raised tomatoes and peppers with his son, Lincoln Marine. On August 24, 1922, Lincoln returned home at noon to find the meal on the table but no one home. Knowing that his parents took a short swim in the Manatee River each day, he ran down the palm-lined lane to the river bank and found his father’s body floating on the water. Golden was struggling to stay afloat, and Lincoln went to get help. When he returned with a neighbor, his mother had disappeared. Her body was found at the bottom of the river. According to a book by the Florida Historical Society, Peter drowned while trying to save Golden, who got into some sort of distress while swimming. But a newspaper clipping from the time reports that there were no witnesses to their drowning. The mystery as to who was possibly the first Jewish person to settle in Sarasota-Manatee was discovered with the help of a non-Jewish lady visiting the Manatee County Public Library and a non-Jewish man interested in Palmetto history.\n\n30 Italian Jewish Research On January 8, 2008, I was invited to speak at the Italian Jewish Roots Conference scheduled for February 25 in Sarasota. I do not have any Italian Jewish roots. I needed help, so I contacted people doing Italian Jewish ancestry research. Between January 8 and February 12, I e-mailed 322 people on the JewishGen Family Finder researching Italian Jewish roots. I received responses from 51 people. I looked forward to reading my e-mail messages that month. One person e-mailed me his family tree and a journal about a genealogy trip he took to Italy. His greatest mystery was tracing his Italian roots back to Spain. The story handed down was that his family lived somewhere in Spain and was expelled with the rest in 1492 and ended up in Italy. In the early 1900s, his great grandparents came to New York. His great grandmother, upon arrival in America, went to a synagogue and was sent away because of her Italian name. She stood outside the synagogue reciting “Shema Yisrael” until they realized she was Jewish. I was surprised that 9 of the 51 e-mail responses (20%) were from people who were not Jewish. Here are three of my favorite responses from those who were not Jewish. • An Italian American man was determined to find his connection to Judaism when his DNA test revealed Middle Eastern ancestry and a very likely link to Jews. This man, a practicing Roman Catholic, remembered his mother covering the mirrors in their home when his father died. Covering the mirrors when someone dies is a Jewish tradition. • A man tracing his Italian heritage said that his family substituted Catholic names for Hebrew names to throw off that they were Jewish during the Inquisition. His family eventually converted to Catholicism. • A Sicilian man claiming not to be Jewish was raised not to eat pork and remembers his grandmother tying red ribbons to the cribs of young babies in his family. Both of these are Jewish traditions. Two Letters Mailed to Israel On August 1, 2006, I snail mailed 24 letters to people in Israel with surname of Klapman or Klopman. My goal was to find cousins to add to my family tree. One letter helped me discover my cousins Efraim and Zev who are brothers. They responded that they were flying from Israel to St. Petersburg, Florida in January 2007 for Zev’s back surgery. I met them in Florida, and we realized that our grandfathers were brothers! Efraim and Zev share great grandparents (Joel Szyia Klopman and Zlata Szwarcbort) with me, making Efraim and Zev my second cousins. On March 11, 2009, I received the following e-mail message from Shemouel Eliyahou “Eli” Klopman, an Israel resident who had been corresponding with me for several years, because we both were tracing the Klapman/Klopman surname. The letter he references in the following e-mail message was one of the 24 letters that I mailed to Israel. “Hello again! What a small world!! Yesterday after I wrote you the last message, my parents were at my home and I talk with my father about it. Suddenly he reminded that he got a letter from USA about two years ago. He went to search to letter in his car and found it!!! Guess from who the letter was? From you!!! you sent a letter to Moshe and Miriam Klopman from Ramat Gan which are my parents. I am sorry my father didn’t answer and I was already married than so I didn’t see the letter until now.” In the spring of 2020, I discovered how I am related to Eli. My gggg grandparents (Johel Klopman and Cyrla) were Eli’s ggggg grandparents, making Eli and me fifth cousins, once removed.\n\n31 Office Manager Answers Phone On February 9, 2016, upon the suggestion of Flora Gursky, I called my cousin Rabbi Harold Salzmann, Rabbi Emeritus at Temple Anshe Amunim, in Pittsfield, who I never met. Keren Weiner, office manager at Temple Anshe Amunim, answered the phone. She told me that Rabbi Salzmann will be in touch with me, because he is very interested in tracing his family. Keren and her sister Miriam Weiner are professional genealogists. I read Miriam’s book, Jewish Roots in Poland, and I had approached Miriam for guidance in tracing my Polish roots many years before I talked to Keren. Because of my conversation with Keren, she made a trip to Sarasota to give a genealogy lecture for the Jewish Genealogical Society of Southwest Florida meeting on December 18, 2016. Rabbi Salzmann and I share ggg grandparents (Szmul Klopman and Maryem Szrajer), making Harold and me fourth cousins. I had wonderful conversations with Harold and he connected me with many of my distant cousins who helped me add more names to my Klapman tree. How You Spell Your Name Is Crucial In 1992, my cousin Ruth Klapman helped me start my Matis family tree. Matis is the maiden name of my paternal grandmother. My grandmother Lena had a sister Devorah Rivka Matis who married Chaim Shtulman. Ruth gave me the address of Chaim’s son Nathan and I mailed a letter to his home in Israel. His daughter Masha responded and suggested that I write to her brother Chaim Shenhar. Chaim was named after his grandfather Chaim Shtulman, however the Shtulman name was changed. Chaim lived in the United States. I could not find an address for a Chaim Shenhar living anywhere in the United States, so I wrote Masha back, but she did not answer me. Years later, I wrote to her again. This time she answered me to let me know that her father Nathan had passed away. This time I realized that the Chaim Shenhar I was looking for was really Chaim Shenhav with a “v” as the last letter. I was then able to reach Chaim and learn more about our Matis family. Chaim moved to Israel and we still communicate. Chaim and I share great grandparents (Leib Matis and Ruchla or Sara Lamarz), making Chaim and me second cousins. With his encouragement and help, I learned the maiden name of my great grandmother Ruchla. Now I know the first and last names of all eight of my great grandparents at the time of their birth. Calling Everyone in the Phone Book with a Particular Surname In 1995, I purchased a compact disc which included all United States phone books. All of the Contorers listed in the phone book were my relatives. My cousin Jay Contorer suggested I look for Kontorer in the phone book. This was a great suggestion, because there were two people listed with the last name of Kontorer, Naum Kontorer and Lev Kontorer. I called both of them. Naum and Lev had recently immigrated to the United States from Russia. Naum suggested that I call his daughter Ann Levitansky. Lev suggested that I call his daughter Bella Komarnitsky. I called the daughters. Coincidentally, Ann had plans to come to the Sarasota/Tampa area in the near future for an antique show. Ann came to my home with her husband and we called Bella. Although they never even knew about each other, they talked on the telephone in Russian and discovered how they were related to each other. In 1996, I met Bella, her husband Igor, their son Sean, and Bella’s parents (Lev and Keyla Kontorer) at their home in Pembroke Pines. Since then, I have been in contact with Asya (who lives in Newark) and Shlomo (who lives in Israel). Asya was a great granddaughter of David Kontorer. Shlomo was a gg grandson of David Kontorer. Lev was a great grandson of David Kontorer. Ann’s father was named Naum and Ann’s great grandfather was also named Naum. Naum (Ann’s great grandfather) and David (Lev’s great grandfather) were brothers. Yaakov Contorer, my gg grandfather, might be a brother to David and Naum. David and Naum were from Kremenchug. Yaakov was from Berislav. Joseph, my great grandfather, came to the United States in 1890. I hope to discover that I am related to Ann and Bella.\n\n32 Walking across the USA While researching the whereabouts of my great grandfather Joseph Contorer, I discovered him in the 1893-1894 San Francisco city directory. I told my cousin Jay Contorer, grandson of Joseph, about this. On October 15, 1998, I received a letter from Jay Contorer in which he wrote the following. “My father never mentioned Joseph (his father) living in California. Isn’t that odd? He told us Joseph came to port of New York in summer, wanted to go to a cooler place and bought a railway ticket to Portland (he thought Portland, Maine) but actually accidentally bought one for Portland, Oregon! He arrived there and then, my father said, WALKED back across the country to Pittsburgh where he met Mary and married her.” In June 1890, Joseph arrived in the port of New York from Russia. His Declaration of Intent to become a United States citizen took place in 1892 in San Francisco. He was listed in an 1899 Cincinnati city directory working as an umbrella repairer. Family lore was that Joseph met my great grandmother Mary in Pittsburgh. His marriage certificate showed that he married Mary in Chicago on April 1, 1900. Maybe Joseph did walk across the country! Did We Graduate Together? The week after my 1971 wedding in Skokie, my husband and I moved to Sarasota. In 1973, I started a job in Sarasota on the second floor of a bank in the accounting department. One of my duties was to review traveler’s check purchases and Series E Bond transactions from the previous business day. I seldom dealt with customers. I saw customers if I passed through the bank lobby when I entered or left the building. One day as I left the building for lunch, I thought I saw Steven Silverman who graduated Niles East High School in Skokie with me. I wish I had said something to him. The next day at work, I reviewed the traveler’s check purchases from the previous day and noticed that Steven Silverman had purchased traveler’s checks. I wondered why he was there. Did he live in Sarasota? Was he on vacation in Sarasota? Would I ever see him again? I went to my ten-year high school reunion in 1978, and he was there. I excitedly told him that I saw him in Sarasota. As it turned out, he went to New College in Sarasota. Barb Kruglick graduated high school with me. In 2017, I attended a service in Sarasota at Temple Emanu-El and sat next to Barb at the oneg following the service, not realizing who she was until we started talking. She was visiting her son who lived in the Sarasota area. It was rare for me to sit down at the oneg and it was her first time at Temple Emanu-El.\n\n33 So We Meet Again My husband Jon and our two teenage daughters went on a United Jewish Appeal Family Mission Trip to Israel in August 1995. When I told my sister Liz, she told me that she and her husband Neil planned a United Jewish Appeal Young Leaders Mission Trip to Israel that slightly overlapped our trip. One of the first attractions on the Family Mission Trip was a tour of the ancient amphitheater Caesarea. My family saw Liz and Neil at Caesarea. We had no idea we would see each other on the trip. I was so excited that I got everyone on my tour bus excited too. Liz and I had a photograph taken of us together. The next day, my family went rafting. I saw Liz and Neil again. I was excited and everyone on our bus was excited again! There were so many activities planned on the itinerary of our tour, but there was one day that we could do whatever we wanted, so my family decided to shop on Dizengoff Street. I bumped into my sister and her husband again! And when our tour bus took us to the Western Wall, I saw my sister’s tour bus parked there. And when I went to see Sarasota’s Sister City Tel Mond, I saw Liz and Neil again. This time I was too embarrassed to tell the people on my bus. It got to the point that if I did not see my sister, I would be surprised.\n\nFeder, Feder, and Feder Being active in my synagogue and ORT America, I know many Jewish people living in Sarasota. Many of them have the same last names. I knew three people in Sarasota with the last name of Feder and all three of them pronounced it differently. I knew Rita Feder because she belonged to ORT with me. I knew Abe Feder because he belonged to the same synagogue as me. I knew Cody Feder because she was a friend of someone who worked for ORT. The three of them did not know each other. On May 15, 2012, I volunteered at the signin table for the ORT Celebrity Bartending fundraiser at Michael’s on East restaurant in Sarasota. Because RSVPs were not necessary to attend, I had no idea who would come. To my surprise, Cody Feder (pronounced fedder), Abe Feder (pronounced fayder), and Rita Feder (pronounced feeder) came to the event. I was so surprised to see all three of them in the same place. Excitedly, I introduced them to one another. Each one thought that their way to pronounce Feder was the right way to pronounce Feder. I never thought I would have the opportunity for the three of them to meet. I took a photo of them together and submitted it to the local newspaper. 34 My Menorah I have the menorah that my great grandmother Mary used in Europe. I cherish this menorah. I thought this menorah was worth a lot of money. I brought this menorah for an ORT America event and someone at the event told me that they had the same menorah. What a coincidence I thought. A few years later at my synagogue’s rummage sale, I saw a menorah that looked like mine selling for $5, and I bought it. Someone at my synagogue told me that a synagogue member had bought that menorah at a thrift store just to have an extra menorah. Because she no longer needed that menorah, she donated it to the rummage sale. Now I was doubting a high monetary value of the menorah. I had the menorah appraised. As it turned out, that menorah was a popular menorah sold in the New York City in the early 1900s and was not valuable. I still cherish my menorah. Junior Miss In 1974, my husband Jon volunteered to chair Sarasota’s first Junior Miss Pageant on behalf of the Sarasota Jaycees. Soon after that, he started working in Lakeland, a 90-minute drive from Sarasota. I was working too, but I had more free time than Jon, so I helped chair the pageant. Neither of us knew much about Junior Miss or pageants. I mentioned to my co-worker Phyllis Coryea that my husband was chairing the Junior Miss Pageant. Phyllis told me that her friend Carole Lane, a dance teacher by profession, had just moved to Bradenton from Wisconsin. Carole chaired several Junior Miss Pageants in Wisconsin and wanted to chair a Junior Miss Pageant in the Sarasota-Manatee area. I contacted Carole and we worked together on Sarasota’s first Junior Miss Pageant. It was a success. The Sarasota winner got first place in the talent competition in Florida, with a roller skating performance. It was fortunate that Carole and I connected!\n\nSurprise Breech Birth It was the evening of August 23, 2016. My daughter Liana was in the early stages of labor. Her husband John and I were present. While lying in bed, Liana felt the baby moving in her tummy. She made a joke to John and me that the baby was trying to do all her last minute tricks before coming out. At 7:30 a.m., their son Woody woke up. Liana told John to get Woody dressed for his third day of kindergarten and bring Woody downstairs. Liana went downstairs to meet Woody and John between contractions. She told Woody that Daddy would be taking him to school and that his baby sister would probably be here when he got home from school. She then gave Woody a kiss, and told him that she loved him. She went upstairs for her next contraction. Soon after, she went into the guest bathroom. Harmony, the midwife, came into the bathroom. John arrived home and saw Liana in the bathroom. He thought Liana was ready to deliver the baby. At 8:44 a.m., Liana told us that she felt like the baby was starting to come. Harmony was right behind Liana. John and I were watching and anxiously awaiting for the baby’s arrival. Lia"
