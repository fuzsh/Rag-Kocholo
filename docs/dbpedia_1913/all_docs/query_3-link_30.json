As before, it covers only domestic competitions, so no internationals, non-league games or friendlies. I have also omitted ARs who refereed 1-2 games and refs who died in service. I'll be happy to update the list when I return from a short break, so please keep those comments coming in. Who will join the list at the end of the season I wonder? Happy reading and Happy Easter!

Graham Poll did indeed referee the Championship Playoff Final on 28th May 2007 when Derby beat WBA 1-0. I have amended the database. Poll was one of a few refs to have refereed more than one Championship Playoff Final. He was also in charge in 2003/4 at Cardiff when Palace beat West Ham 1-0, a game at which I was present. Following the end of his PL career at Portsmouth, Graham also refereed a L1 semi-final when Yeovil won 5-2 at Nottingham Forest. How fortunes have changed!\n\nTomorrow is the 50th anniversary of George McCabe's final game at Wembley.\n\nUpdate: I Hemley, Brighton v York, May 1996. This was played on a Thursday morning in front of an 'all-ticket' crowd of just over 2,000 after the previous game, also refereed by Ian, had to be abandoned due to a crowd invasion. A sad end to Ian's career on the FL.\n\n« Last Edit: Thu 25 Apr 2019 15:52 by Acme Thunderer »\n\nRe: Final Games\n\n« Reply #27 on: Thu 25 Apr 2019 18:15 »\n\nMany thanks for all your hard work in helping me to compile this list, which I have wanted to do for some time.

He departed years before the former retirement age, apparently to concentrate on his teaching career. I'm not sure if he knew he was standing down when taking charge of his final match or whether the decision came later - SuffolkRef may be able to shed light on that matter. Most referees will take charge of their last game knowing they are departing, e.g. due to retirement or scheduled resignation, but in some cases the departure is not anticipated at the time, e.g. linked to injury or change in circumstances.\n\nAs regards Rodger Gifford he did referee throughout the 1995-1996 season but all his games were outside the Premier League which isn't covered so much by Soccerbase before the 2000s. His final game in the middle was Plymouth v Hartlepool in May 1996 although he was fourth official for the Leicester-Palace play-off later that month.\n\nInformative x 1 View List\n\nWhistleblower\n\nRTR Veterans\n\nHero Member\n\nPosts: 2,772\n\nRe: Final Games\n\n« Reply #28 on: Thu 25 Apr 2019 18:54 »\n\nIndeed, the circumstances of referees' final games are so various.

Abandoning; an irony not lost on Mick Russell I suspect.\n\nIn the 1980s and up to the onset of the Premier League referees scheduled to retire were often given a top Division game to end their career, sometimes a \"low-stakes\", mid-table encounter but occasionally a match with significance at the top or bottom of the table. When the Premier League came into being Football League referees often got a Championship game on which to sign-off but that's become less common in more recent times and with the advent of SG2 not an option for most FL referees so returning to where they started their career or to some other significant venue has become popular. I think retiring referees may also be able to request specific assistants in some cases.\n\nClearly when a referee knows he is departing the occasion is going to be charged in a very different way to the unscheduled departure. Often it will be a emotional occasion which can be an argument against the game being a \"high-stakes\" encounter like a Cup Final or vital promotion or relegation encounter. However there may even be occasions where a referee is glad to reach the end, perhaps finding refereeing less satisfying or too pressured and maybe having carried on more out of a sense of duty than enjoyment.\n\nBy contrast the referees making unscheduled departures go into their final games unaware of their later significance. What seemed like a routine game can then take on much greater import. Sometimes it is that actual game that prompts the departure as in the case of injury or some unsettling event that leads to them calling it a day. Often the game passes without incident but later events cause it to be the final outing.\n\nInformative x 1 View List"
