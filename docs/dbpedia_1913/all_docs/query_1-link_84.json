        "text": "Peter Latino passed away peacefully on June 9, 2022 at the age of 64 at home in the arms of his family.\n\nPeter will always be remembered as a gentle, generous man full of life and joy. He was a devoted and loving husband to Mila. He was kind and considerate to everyone he met, and he easily connected with people of all ages and walks of life. To be around Peter was to know just how good it feels to laugh.\n\nPeter was born in Worcester, Mass., the son of Sylvia (Urso) and Philip Latino. He graduated from Holy Name Catholic High School where he made many life-long friendships. Peter worked as a truck driver for 20 years. Beginning his career at N.E.F.F./Hendries Ice Cream in Southboro and ending at ABF Freight in Worcester.\n\nPeter and his wife Mila shared a passion for travel. They traveled the U.S., the Caribbean and Europe. They particularly loved cruising where Peter would scuba dive among the reefs finding beauty and silence that touched his soul.\n\nPeter was an avid Patriots fan who often chose to watch the games alone to ensure he would not miss a second of play. And woe to the person who called during the game. He was an amateur plumber, carpenter, and general contractor. As his nieces know so well, if it needed fixing then “Siri, call Peter.”\n\nPeter was a member of the Teamsters Union Local 170: a proud diamond member of the Crown & Anchor Society - Royal Caribbean Cruises, a member of the Elks Club in Auburn, and a volunteer at Central Boston Elder Services.\n\nPeter is predeceased by his parents Philip and Sylvia Latino. He is survived by his loving and devoted wife Mila (Spitkovsky); his stepson Aleksander Zaytsev; his sister and her husband, Elaine Latino and Melvin Thompson; his brother and his wife, John Latino and Mary Ellen Clifford; his cousins Lisa Virga, Lori (Virga) and her husband Thomas Costello and his beloved nieces Joanna and Carolyn Latino and Gianna Costello.\n\nThe family is indebted to Dr. Humberto Rossi and all of Peter’s caregivers at the Milford Regional Medical Center for their loving care of Peter. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Dana Farber Cancer Institute; please include Milford Regional Medical Center in the memo field. Mailing address is Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Attn. Hillary Bruns, 10 Brookline Place West, Brookline, MA 02445.\n\nVisiting hours will take place Tuesday, June 14 from 4-8 p.m. at Mercadante Funeral Home & Chapel, Worcester, Mass. A funeral Mass will be celebrated at 10 a.m. Wednesday, June 15 at Our Lady of Loreto Parish, 37 Massasoit Road, Worcester, Mass."
