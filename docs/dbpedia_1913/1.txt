Veteran saxist Philip "Phil" Urso

Born: Oct 02, 1925 in Jersey City, New Jersey

Died: April 7th, 2008, Denver CO

Subtlety and restraint defined the playing of Phil Urso, a member of the

1950s' cool school who owed a strong artistic debt to Lester "Pres" Young

but never came across as a clone of him. Urso started out on clarinet, but

the tenor sax became his primary instrument after he studied it in high

school. Though not that well-known, Urso was a solid and expressive jazzman

who played with Woody Herman, Jimmy Dorsey, Miles Davis, Terry Gibbs, Oscar

Pettiford and others in the 1950s. In 1954, he co-led a quintet with

trombonist Bob Brookmeyer that recorded for Savoy, but Urso's best-known

association came in 1955 and 1956, when he was a sideman for Chet Baker.

Urso was prominently featured on some of the trumpeter's Pacific Jazz

recordings of 1956, which make one wish he had become more visible instead

of less so. But after the '50s, very little was heard about Urso on a

national level, although he did remain active in the jazz scene of his

adopted home of Denver well into the 1990s. Phil recorded an album with Carl

Saunders "Salute Chet Baker" for Colorado's own Jazzed Media label a few

years ago. Phil was part of the all-star big band that was part of the

performoing artists that played for jazz89KUVO's 20th Anniversary Concert in

2005 that was headlined by Marian McPartland. Urso had been ill for the past

year.
