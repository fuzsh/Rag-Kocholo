        "text": "Olive oil-infused coffee? Starbucks bets you’ll drink it.\n\nIt wouldn’t be the oddest food and beverage product olive oil has seeped into. We mix it into ice cream and whisk it into chocolate cake. On TikTok, olive oil fans knock back shots of the liquid, saying it clears their skin and helps them lose weight. You can dunk grapefruit in olive oil or dribble it into a dirty martini, add it to granola or beat it into lemon curd.\n\nNutrition experts tout olive oil as a health-conscious component of your meal. Olive oil is linked with a range of health benefits, from lowered blood pressure to reduced inflammation, said Julia Zumpano, a registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic. Here’s what we know about what olive oil can — and can’t — do for your health.\n\nOlive oil might help your heart.\n\nA wealth of research has linked the Mediterranean staple to promising health outcomes: a reduced risk of cancer, potential prevention of Alzheimer’s disease, even a lower risk of early death. But many of these studies have looked at the health outcomes of people who eat olive oil as part of a larger Mediterranean diet, in which olive oil replaces less healthy sources of fat like butter, as opposed to isolating the health effects of olive oil itself.\n\nIt’s tricky to tease out just how large a role olive oil played in those health outcomes, said Marta Guasch-Ferré, a research scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But the most robust research we have focuses on olive oil’s benefits for the heart, she added.\n\nDr. Guasch-Ferré led a study published in 2022 that found that people who consumed more than half a tablespoon of olive oil per day had a roughly 19 percent lower chance of dying from cardiovascular disease than those who rarely or never consumed olive oil. And a 2022 review of 13 studies showed strong associations between higher olive oil consumption and reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and death from other causes.\n\nResearchers have circled around a few theories as to why olive oil might protect the heart. Olive oil contains monounsaturated fatty acids, which can reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL — sometimes called “bad” cholesterol — in your blood, according to the American Heart Association. High amounts of LDL can build up in the inner walls of the blood vessels, forming thick deposits called plaques that can narrow and clog major arteries; monounsaturated fats may help stave off this damage.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
