Lower levels were detected in Megaritiki (65.81 ± 2.75%) and Manaki (70.15 ± 1.72%) cultivars. Adversely, for the polyunsaturated FA, linoleic acid (C18:2), the highest levels were observed in the Manaki (13.35 ± 1.07%) and Megaritiki (12.51 ± 2.02%) cultivars. The major saturated FAs were palmitic acid (C16:0), determined in the highest concentration in Megaritiki (15.53 ± 1.01%), and stearic acid (C18:0) in Koroneiki (2.78 ± 0.28%) and Manaki (2.63 ± 0.15%) samples. Interestingly, the highest levels of oleic/linoleic acid (C18:1/C18:2) and MUFA/PUFA ratios were observed in the Koroneiki cultivar which indicates a high performance against oxidative deterioration [25].\n\nSimilar results have been reported by previous studies for Koroneiki cultivar [18,22]. In a study from Stefanoudaki et al. [20] in Koroneiki olive oil samples from different maturity stages and producing areas of Crete the levels of oleic acid (18:1) (74.66–79.34%), and linoleic acid (18:2) (5.05–7.02%) were slightly different. Psomiadou et al. [26] studied 52 VOO samples from the Koroneiki cultivar and reported that oleic acid (C18:1) concentration ranged from 74.6% to 79.4% and 4.7% to 8.9% for linoleic acid (18:2). Limited research exists for the FA composition of olive oil from Amfissis, Manaki, and Megaritiki cultivars. Andreou et al. [27] evaluated the shelf-life evaluation of VOO from Amfissis, Manaki, and Tsounati cultivars extracted by non-thermal pretreatments. The oleic acid (18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2) levels using the traditional olive oil extraction technology were 70.68% and 12.66% for Amfissis, and for Manaki VOO samples 75.47% and 6.19%, respectively. In another study by Kosma et al. [19] the concentration of oleic acid (18:1) in Manaki extra virgin olive oil samples was slightly lower (72.93%). Iconomou et al. [28] and Katsoyannos et al. [29] studied the quality characteristics of Megaritiki olive oil and reported concentrations of 62.29% to 62.96% for oleic acid (18:1) and 11.64–14.39% for linoleic acid (18:2).\n\nANOVA and subsequent post-hoc tests between FA in association with botanical origin were performed ( ). Statistically significant differences were observed among the VOOs based on the levels of palmitoleic acid (16:1) and gadoleic acid (20:1), indicating a strong contribution on the discrimination between the four cultivars. Other FA such as arachidonic acid (20:4) and linoleic acid (18:2) were also significant for the differentiation of VOOs from Koroneiki, Megaritiki, and Amfissis cultivars. From the obtained results it is evident that a further application of chemometric methods to FA composition could be successful for the classification of samples with regard to cultivar.\n\n2.3. Correlation Coefficients\n\nCorrelations of FA concentrations from the combination of the four olive oil cultivars as well as in each cultivar separately ( ) were studied using Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients to designate potent similarities and differences between the cultivars. From the combined FA results of the four cultivars, strong positive correlations (p ≤ 0.01) were observed ( a) between palmitic acid (16:0)—palmitoleic acid (16:1), arachidic acid (20:0)—behenic acid (22:0), and arachidic acid (20:0)—stearic acid (18:0), while strong negative correlations were observed between gadoleic acid (20:1)—palmitoleic acid (16:1) and gadoleic acid (20:1)—palmitic acid (16:0). A medium to strong antagonistic relationships was detected among oleic acid (18:1)—linoleic acid (18:2), oleic acid (18:1)—palmitoleic acid (16:1), and oleic acid (18:1)—stearic acid (18:0) (Table S1 in Supplementary Materials). The correlations between palmitic acid (16:0)—palmitoleic acid (16:1) and arachidic acid (20:0)—stearic acid (18:0) have been previously reported from Stefanoudaki et al. [20] and Kritioti et al. [21] who studied olive oil samples from Mastoides, Koroneiki, and Cypriot (ladoelia) cultivars. The antagonistic relationship between oleic acid (18:1)—stearic acid (18:0) has also been reported by Kritioti et al. [21].\n\nThe above results can be explained by the kinetic differences of transformations taking place during the FA biosynthesis and the activity of FA desaturases during the maturation of olives. The oleic acid is converted to linoleic acid in an inverse association where the increased levels of one FA will result in the decrease of the other. Specifically, the FA are synthesized from the malonyl-acyl carrier protein with the subsequent action of the enzymatic system of FA synthase that mainly catalyzes the synthesis of palmitate. Consequently, the first FA produced from FA biosynthesis is palmitic acid (16:0) which can be elongated to stearic acid (18:0). Then through the catalyzing activity of stearoyl-ACP Δ9-desaturase, oleate desaturase, and linoleate desaturase, the oleic acid, linoleic acid, and α-linolenic acid, are formed, respectively [30,31,32].\n\nA high degree of positive correlation coefficients were observed between palmitic (16:0)—palmitoleic acid (16:1) for all cultivars, especially in Manaki VOO samples ( d). Differences were observed in arachidic acid (20:0)—behenic acid (22:0), medium to strong correlations were observed in Megaritiki and Amfissis, while in Koroneiki and Manaki were low positive (Tables S2–S5). Positive correlations of arachidic acid (20:0)—stearic acid (18:0) were detected in all cultivars except from Manaki where the significance level was above 0.01. Strong negative correlations were observed between gadoleic acid (20:1)—palmitoleic acid (16:1) in Manaki and Megaritiki while in Koroneiki and Amfissis the correlations were insignificant. Strong negative correlations were also observed in gadoleic acid (20:1)—palmitic acid (16:0) in all cultivars except for Koroneiki samples. Medium to strong negative correlations of oleic acid (18:1)—palmitoleic acid (16:1) were detected in all cultivars. Strong antagonistic relationships were detected among oleic acid (18:1)—linoleic acid (18:2) in all cultivars except Amfissis, and medium antagonistic relationships were among oleic acid (18:1)—stearic acid (18:0) for Koroneiki and Megaritiki VOO samples. Summarizing the above results, common correlation patterns were detected in the four cultivars for the FA palmitic acid (16:0)—palmitoleic acid (16:1) and oleic acid (18:1)—palmitoleic acid (16:1), while several differences were observed among the remaining FA of this study depicting the differences in each cultivar.\n\n2.5. Discriminant Analysis\n\nFollowing the non-satisfactory results of PCA, further attempts towards the discrimination of VOOs was carried out using the supervised method of discriminant analysis (DA). The forward stepwise selection algorithm was applied for the determination of the most significant FA for the botanical differentiation of samples. The forward stepwise selection process was initiated with the addition of the variable with the highest contribution in the model. The next variable was added to the model if the entry probability was higher than the entry threshold value. After the addition of the third variable, the impact of removing each variable present in the model after its addition was evaluated. If the probability was higher than the removal threshold value, then the variable was removed from the model [33]. The discriminating power of each variable was defined by the F value. A high F value denotes great discriminating potential of the variable.\n\nSix FAs, namely, palmitoleic (C16:1), linoleic (C18:2), arachidonic (C20:4), α-linolenic (C18:3), gadoleic (C20:1), and palmitic acid (C16:0), were selected by the forward stepwise process as the most significant for the discrimination of VOOs ( ). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed using the six FAs selected by the algorithm. The values of Wilks’ Lambda = 0.006, F = 123.447, p < 0.0001 < 0.05 and Pillai’s trace = 2.331, F = 87.714, p < 0.0001 < 0.05, indicated significant differences among the means vectors of the VOOS from four olive oil cultivars.\n\nTable 3\n\nFatty AcidsPartial R² F Pr > FWilks’ LambdaPr < LambdaC16:10.840268.739<0.00010.160<0.0001C18:20.792194.597<0.00010.033<0.0001C20:40.737141.958<0.00010.009<0.0001C18:30.17110.384<0.00010.007<0.0001C20:10.1589.411<0.00010.006<0.0001C16:00.0894.8530.0030.006<0.0001\n\nAccording to the Eigenvalues and Bartlett’s statistic ( ), the three discriminant functions were significant in the differentiation of samples. However, Box’s test of Fisher’s F asymptotic approximation (−(2Log(M) = 242.457, p < 0.0001 < 0.05) denoted differences among the within-class covariance matrices which may be attributed to the different harvesting years of VOO samples.\n\nTable 4\n\nFunctionEigenvaluesBartlett’s Statistic p Discrimination (%)Cumulative (%)Canonical Correlation111.285788.9990.00063.13763.1370.95825.249407.7270.00029.36892.5050.91731.340129.1980.0007.495100.0000.757\n\nThe separation among the VOO samples from the four cultivars based on the first two discriminant functions F1 and F2 of the LDA model is presented in a. The discriminant function F1, which accounts for 63.1% of the total variance, distinctly differentiates Megaritiki and Manaki from Koroneiki VOO samples, while Amfissis samples are not clearly differentiated. From the standardized canonical discriminant function coefficients ( ) we observed that the FA with the highest contribution based on F1 are linoleic (18:2), arachidonic (20:4), and α-linolenic acid (18:3). According to the discriminant function F2, palmitoleic (16:1), gadoleic (20:1), and linoleic acid (18:2) were the most significant FA for the discrimination of Manaki and Amfissis from Megaritiki VOO samples. The evaluation of the three discriminant functions for the mean points for each cultivar is presented at Table S6.\n\nTable 5\n\nFatty AcidsF1F2F3C20:4−0.9390.113−0.658C20:1−0.1420.434−0.078C18:2−1.1930.4470.302C18:30.401−0.055−0.334C16:1−0.173−0.931−0.493C16:00.1990.0840.602\n\nThe correct classification for the training set of 158 VOOs was 100.00%. The LDA chemometric model was validated using the leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV), which enables to observe the prediction for a certain observation if it is left out of the training set. In order to acquire more realistic results about the model performance, an independent prediction set of 41 VOOs was utilized to further confirm the robustness of the model. The LOOCV rate obtained from the LDA model was 100.00%. Regarding the prediction set performance, one sample from the Amfissis cultivar was misclassified as Megaritiki, obtaining a 97.56% percentage of correct classification.\n\nAlthough LDA is generally robust to the violation of Box’s test criterion, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) is usually performed instead, where the within-class covariance matrices are assumed to be different [33]. Classification functions for LDA and QDA are given at Tables S7 and S8. These functions may be used to determine which class VOO sample is to be assigned to using values taken for the various explanatory variables. Each VOO sample is assigned to the class with the highest classification function. Discriminant functions used in the classification of samples for the training set are given at Tables S9 and S10 for LDA and QDA. Classification functions used to prediction for the prediction set are given at Tables S11 and S12, for LDA and QDA. The classification and prediction results of discriminant analysis were based on the classification function of each group and the discriminant functions. The discriminant functions were created from the training set and were not group-specific. This means that a sample was given a score based on the discriminant functions and was assigned to the group with the highest probability for group membership. Consequently, the samples of the training set were distinguished based on the discriminant functions. On the other hand, the samples of the prediction set, and any new observation, were classified based on the classification functions where the new observations will receive a discriminant score based on each group-specific function.\n\nWhen QDA analysis was applied ( b), the same values for Wilks’ Lambda and Pillai’s trace were obtained, while correct classification, cross-validation, and prediction set rate were 99.37%, 98.10%, and 92.68%, respectively. Confusion matrix for the cross-validation and the prediction results of LDA and QDA are given at Tables S13 and S14. Regarding the prediction set performance, two VOO samples from Manaki and one VOO sample from the Amfissis cultivar were misclassified as Megaritiki. The percentage of prediction set is slightly lower from the cross-validation score for both LDA and QDA models. This observation may be attributed to the fact that the 41 samples of the prediction set were not included in the training set that was used for model building. On the contrary, the LOOCV was performed using the same samples that were used for model building. From the above results we concluded that LDA performed better than QDA for the differentiation of VOO samples according to cultivar.\n\nDiscrimination between the VOOs from the cultivars Koroneiki, Megaritiki, Amfissis, and Manaki based on FA has not been previously reported, though discrimination studies of other Greek olive oil cultivars have been performed based on FA composition with satisfactory results. Kosma et al. [19] determined nine FA and differentiated 74 samples from Manaki, Kolovi, Hontrolia, and Koutsourelia cultivars using LDA with a correct classification and cross-validation rate of 94.6% and 90.5%, respectively. In another study by Kosma et al. [18] 104 olive oil samples from the Koroneiki, Galano, Ladolia of Corfu, Adramitiani of Lesvos island, Athinolia of Laconia, and Samothraki cultivars were discriminated using MANOVA/LDA with a score of 94% and 92.1% for cross-validation using nine FAs. In our study, except for cross-validation, an external test set was also used to confirm the results of the developed chemometric models. Furthermore, in the above-mentioned studies, no specific FA are reported for the differentiation of olive oil with respect to cultivar. The findings of the current work indicate that characteristic FA can be identified and used in chemometric models in order to distinguish the botanical origin of olive oil."
