        "text": "Let’s forget Titian, Hans Holbein, Albrecht Durer, and other mainstays in the history of Western painting who are included in an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, “Hidden Faces: Covered Portraits of the Renaissance.” Instead, can we talk about the wild man of medieval Europe?\n\nThe wild man shows up in three pieces at the Met, albeit only once in a prominent role: That would be a portrait cover attributed to the workshop of Jakob Elsner, a German artist who predates Durer by a good decade. Durer, too, was familiar with our “wild” man: the great printmaker and painter pictured him whispering into the ear of a bride in an exquisite engraving, “Coat of Arms with Skull” (1503). Finally, the wild man is visible amongst a field of surface distress on the reverse side of a portrait by Wolfgang Beurer, “Johann von Rückingen” (1487).\n\nThe wild man, the Met tells us, “is a legendary woodland figure commonly used as a heraldic bearer and symbol of fertility.” Its roots go back to antiquity — to fauns, satyrs, and the like — as well as the tale of Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian King who not only met with God’s disfavor but was rejected by the community of men, moved out to the woods, and subsequently grew a wealth of body hair. Fun fact: A great British humorist, P.G. Wodehouse, likely owes his surname to our hirsute outsider.\n\nThe wild man seems an appropriate mascot for “Hidden Faces,” as it’s an exhibition that concerns itself with subterfuge and transformation. The curator of the Met’s Robert Lehman Collection, Alison Manges Nogueira, has organized the first exhibition devoted exclusively to portraiture whose subject was, in one way or another, made inaccessible. These objects were, Ms. Nogueira writes, “often stored away and unveiled for special viewings,” and “were designed to restrict access to the sitters’ images.” Our erstwhile curator has put together a quirky show.\n\nIt’s a show that is also a disappointment, kind of, given not only how artworks have been dismantled through the centuries but the prerequisites of “please don’t touch the art” stewardship. Take one of the centerpieces of “Hidden Faces,” an oil-on-wood picture, “Portrait of a Woman (La Monaca)” (circa 1510), attributed to Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, grandson of Domenico and nephew of Davide. Once considered the portrait of a nun, Ghirlandaio’s sub-“Mona Lisa” has too low of a neckline to qualify as such. Conjecture now has it that she was a member of the patrician class.\n\nAt one point in time, “La Monaca” was placed within a wood sleeve over which could be slid another painting-on–panel attributed to Ridolfo, one that features a mask, some attendant “grotesqueries,” and an inscription in Latin that reads, “To each his own mask.” The theatrical allusions are clear; the funerary symbolism less so, though the accompanying literature elaborates on its meanings. Ridolfo underscored the correspondences in the two pictures through the similarities between the sitter’s aquiline nose and that of the mask, as well as the general shape of the heads.\n\nNot a few steps away, you’ll find what is likely the exhibition’s finest picture, “Portrait of a Woman” (circa 1505), by Lorenzo Lotto. The competition for this designation is, admittedly, stiff, but the sui generis nature of the Lotto panel counts for something: This woman doesn’t hew to the standards of 16th-century portraiture. She’s notably unadorned — no jewelry, and her raiment is modest, even a bit prole. (Some scholars conjecture that she might have been a wet nurse.) That, and our lady is stolid, solid, and not elegant in the least.\n\nThe wall label, extending the curator’s diplomacy, extols Lotto’s “unsparing naturalism” in his depiction of this serious, dignified, and somewhat reticent personage. “Portrait of a Woman” has been paired with “Portrait Cover With an Allegory” (circa 1905), wherein Lotto has created a pastoral setting in which a woman is being showered with flower petals by a passing cherub. The pairing of the two paintings isn’t altogether certain, but there’s no denying the close resemblance between the women at the center of each.\n\nThe Met has included helpful video reconstructions of how several of the pieces may have originally operated, and the exhibition includes a vitrine or two of Roman coins whose double-sided imagery inspired Renaissance artists to attempt the recto/verso formatting. The most stunning of the versos on display is by a Netherlandish artist, Hans Memling: “Flowers in a Vase” (circa 1485), the flipside of “Portrait of a Man,” is a still-life of unfailing precision and extraordinary quietude.\n\nAlso worth noting are two carved wood boxes by the Meister der Dosenköpke in which Martin Luther’s protector, Frederich the Wise, is paired with his mistress Anna. Not far along is a suite of portable portrait miniatures modeled in wax, pieces whose tactility is too fleshlike for comfort.\n\n“Hidden Faces” ends with an elaborate watch designed by Lambertus Vrythoff and decorated with paintings of mythological scenes. It’s a fitting finale for a show in which meticulous craft is the standard by which the rest of us, wild men included, can take pleasure.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the April 8, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nHere’s a question that passed through my mind as I visited Picture Theory, a newish exhibition space at Chelsea: Would George McNeil (1908-95) have stooped to posting his paintings and prints on Instagram? I say “stooped” because of the animus McNeil had for self-promotion. This was the man who bowed out of Nina Leen’s renowned portrait of The New York School, “The Irascibles,” a photo that did much to cement its primacy in the public eye.\n\nThink about it: The Mount Rushmore of Abstract Expressionism — Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, and … George McNeil? There are myriad reasons an artist’s reputation does or doesn’t scale the heights. Personality is one of them; cultural cache is another. McNeil bristled when his individuality was put under duress: no team player, he. Still, McNeil’s peers held the work in high esteem — de Kooning was a fan — and scratched their collective head at his lack of notoriety.\n\nMcNeil’s art found an audience in the mid-1980s. His late canvases — rambunctious meldings of AbEx facture and graffiti-influenced pictograms — benefited from a renewed interest in both Expressionism and figurative painting. Given the buoyant and often uproarious nature of the compositions, not a few observers thought McNeil had finally achieved maturity at the ripe old age of 70-something. “As George McNeil gets older,” a former New York Times critic, Michael Brenson, wrote, “his work gets younger.”\n\n“Discos and Dancers,” the current exhibition of McNeil’s art at Picture Theory, puts that theory to test. Among the most striking paintings in the show, “Occasion” (1966), predates McNeil’s popular heyday by a good two decades. Its melding of ArtBrut imagery with a Bonnard-like color palette may have been fobbed off at the time as not being sufficiently innovative. Yet McNeil was less interested in the outre than in the primal. He was painting for the long game. That, and the overriding subject of his work is joy. In the end, maybe McNeil wasn’t irascible enough.\n\nMcNeil’s pictures have not gone unnoticed by our cultural institutions. The work is included in the collections of MoMA, the Met, and the Whitney — where, for the most part, it has been gathering dust in the storage racks. You’d think our hometown institutions would want to celebrate a hometown boy, particularly given how much the paintings were inspired by our local music scene. Punks, disco dollies, and headbangers, oh my.\n\nThere is, alas, no accounting for the vagaries of museological fashion. We should be grateful to commercial venues like Picture Theory for picking up the slack.\n\nThe work of sculptor Nancy Cohen has invariably and, perhaps ineluctably, embodied fragility: employing glass and paper, mediums highly susceptible to human touch, all but guarantees as much. Yet if the title of her current exhibition at Kathryn Markel Fine Arts, “The State We’re In,” acknowledges a world in flux, the pieces themselves are more particular in emphasis and more interior in effect.\n\nFreestanding amalgamations of glass and wire, sometimes inflected with pigment, are endowed with a counterintuitive sensitivity of flesh; encompassing wall pieces shaped with pulped paper bring to mind radiographs or microscopic events. All the while Ms. Cohen juxtaposes her materials with quiet aplomb and fetching tactility. Here is an unassuming and deeply felt art.\n\nOlive Ayhens, “Amphibian Emergency” (2008); via Bookstein Projects\n\n* * *\n\nThe aesthetics of pollution” is the stated subject of a show at Bookstein Projects, “Olive Ayhens: Metabolic Metropolis.” Spanning almost 30 years, this array of oil paintings and watercolors showcases an artist of deeply held convictions and unapologetic eccentricity. Her teetering vistas of “urban strata” can be whimsical in character: “From Empire State” (2002) channels Paul Klee and Saul Steinberg to lighthearted effect. Yet Ms. Ayhens also has the capacity to unnerve.\n\nWhat to make, for instance, of the abrupt mash-up of modernist architecture, divergent landscapes, and frogs — lots of frogs — in “Amphibian Emergency” (2008)? A current of environmental alarm is both amplified and mitigated by Ms. Ayhens’ knack for the telling detail, her nudgy brushwork, and a consummate deployment of warm and cool tonalities.\n\nHeir to the American strain of idiosyncratic visionaries, Ms. Ayhens is a link in a chain that includes Albert Pinkham Ryder, Louis Eilshemius and Florine Stettheimer. That’s not bad company to keep. Ms. Ayhens’ art is unstoppable.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis article was originally published in the April 5, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nFew things make a book reviewer’s eyes glaze over as quickly as the arrival of a compilation of writing about art. Rarefied byways of contemporary culture tend to encourage the intellectual manques within their parameters to indulge in grudgery, theory, and jargon. While every literary genre has its thornier precincts, art history and art criticism are particularly notorious for their hermeticism.\n\nIt was with a cautious sense of optimism, then, that I read the preface to “Listening to what you see; Selected contributions on Dutch art,” a new book by a historian and former professor at Utrecht University, Peter Hecht. “I have always tried to write clearly … taking the risk that ‘if I show my cards openly, certain readers will probably think that they cannot be of much interest.’” This quote from Goethe prompts Mr. Hecht to “wish that every academic were made to learn it by heart.”\n\nFrom Mr. Hecht’s lips to God’s ears, but suspicion is a hard habit to curtail, particularly at a time when postmodern shibboleths and ideological fire-breathing have become the air we breathe. The good professor follows up with a rather unfashionable notion: “Writing about one’s love for art is an obligation not a luxury.” As if he were reading our minds, he lays down the law: “Please do not be cynical about this.”\n\nWe’re barely into the first chapter when Mr. Hecht lets us know his thoughts about relativism: “I do not believe that history is so difficult and unknowable that one has to accept all possible and impossible assertions [about art] as being of equal weight and value.” Mr. Hecht is an advocate for facts on the ground or, rather, on the canvas. He’s intent on returning the artwork’s agency to the subject under discussion: “too often … the painter’s poetics seemed to have been all but forgotten.”\n\n“Listening to what you see” is a collection of papers, reviews, and essays that span, roughly speaking, 30 years. As is typical of efforts such as this, Mr. Hecht’s book suffers from a certain repetitiousness, as a number of cherished ideas bob up-and-down through sundry writings. Nor is the book always kind to the layman: Deep dives into iconography may be of serious scholarly import but they’ll likely leave generalists at sea.\n\nThe most prominent of Mr. Hecht’s idées fixes is the interpretive overreach of art historians. Although not altogether inclined to dismiss the symbolic underpinnings of Dutch genre painting, he questions whether the images are as rich in signifiers as we have been led to believe. Can’t some artists have been attracted to certain subjects because, you know, they were really good at painting them?\n\nGerard Dou, a student of Rembrandt and the prototypical fijnschilder, is a constant in Mr. Hecht’s writings and, one suspects, a favorite. Noting that there was “very nearly nothing on God’s earth that Dou’s virtuoso brush could not successfully imitate,” Mr. Hecht posits that perhaps something as straightforward as the delight taken in mimesis accounted for Dou’s considerable success. Who needs moralizing when craft can provide its own rationale?\n\nDou set out to prove that his chosen metier was superior to sculpture, as Mr. Hecht convincingly argues in a chapter titled “Art beats Nature, and Painting does so best of all.” The author writes about the recurring placement of a relief sculpture, “Putti teasing a goat” (circa 1626-30) by François Duquesnoy, within Dou’s pictures and, in particular, “The violinist” (1653). Roping in Chardin’s “Lady with a bird organ” (1751) to bolster his observations, Mr. Hecht notes that “painting can not only represent all things, but even suggest what music does to nature.”\n\nElsewhere, Mr. Hecht introduces us to a 17th-century painter and one-trick pony, Godefridus Schalcken; compares Rembrandt and Rubens to the latter’s detriment; and remembers the first time he came across Francisco de Goya’s “Portrait of Don Ramón Satué” (1823). He also dares mention the “Q” word: “The art historian who sidesteps the quality issue is … a rather pitiful specimen.” A gentleman to the end, Mr. Hecht is provocative all the same. “Listening to what you see” is a tonic.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the March 19, 2024 edition of “The New York Sun.”\n\nThe American painter Archibald J. Motley Jr. (1891-1981) is likely best known for his multi-figure compositions depicting the variousness of Black life in America — of backroom card games, elegant formal dinners, “holy rollers” in church, bustling commercial thoroughfares, and rambunctious jazz clubs.\n\nThe paintings are luminous and funny, bumptious in their forms, often lurid in ambiance and velvety in tactility. Canvases like “Blues” (1929), “Black Belt” (1934), and “Nightlife” (1943) underscore the urbanity that is at the heart of an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, “The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism.”\n\nWhether these are the finest examples of Motley’s oeuvre is a question worth asking. Notwithstanding their considerable appeal, the pictures have always seemed stilted, like inventories of stuff crammed together rather than organic wholes given life. Motley’s cultural investment in the pictures is clear, but was his temperament?\n\nTake into account the somewhat persnickety personage we see in “Self-Portrait” (circa 1920) or, even better, “The Octoroon Girl” (1925) and the radiant “Brown Girl After the Bath” (1931). The latter two are supernal paintings, each possessed of an equanimity whose quietude did not exclude a frank embrace of sensuality. Notwithstanding the generic titles of each canvas, these are portraits of individuals, hard-won and shaped with exquisite command.\n\nMotley isn’t the only artist who is seen in abundance during the run of the Met exhibition. James Van Der Zee’s photographs, whether they be of tea time at the beauty parlor or a shoeless street preacher, are, as documents of an era, silky and stern. William Henry Johnson’s chock-a-block portraits, owing as much to vernacular art as to Van Gogh and Soutine, are invariably bracing, and the portraiture of Laura Wheeler Waring, whether it be of an unnamed young woman or Marian Anderson, is of a high order.\n\nYou know what’s on view of a lesser or, rather, unnecessary order in “The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism”? Pictures by Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Kees van Dongen, Chaim Soutine, and Edvard Munch.\n\nGranted, the exhibition’s intent is to “situate Black artists … as central to our understanding of international modern art and modern life.” Denise Murrell, the museum’s Merryl H. and James S. Tisch curator at large and organizer of the show, speaks of how “many New Negro artists spent extended periods abroad and joined the multiethnic artistic circles in Paris, London, and Northern Europe.”\n\nHistorical context and artistic comparisons are important, but they’re applied only selectively throughout the installation and, in the end, serve less as a grounding for the Met’s ambitions than a half-hearted, oh-by-the-way inclusion.\n\nIs it interesting to learn that Matisse visited jazz clubs on his visits to Manhattan and, from some accounts, hobnobbed with Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong? Absolument, but the corresponding pictures are marooned in this particular outing. Would that Ms. Murrell had placed van Dongen’s “Plumes Blanches” (1910-1912) next to Beauford Delaney’s “Dark Rapture (James Baldwin)” (1941). I mean, talk about “cross cultural affinity.” Such pairings are few and far between.\n\nBe that as it may, “The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism” is a rare creature, an unapologetic crowd pleaser of genuine scholarly merit. Whatever complaints that can be accrued by rote nods to ideological fashion are subsumed by the quality and range of the work itself. Accompanying the paintings, drawings, sculptures, and prints are a host of documentary items, including copies of The Crisis, a magazine founded by W.E.B. Dubois, and a loop of film featuring Josephine Baker and sundry other nightclub talents.\n\nLet’s hope the success of this venture results in deeper elaborations of individual oeuvres — say, the metaphorical totems of Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller or the prismatic symbolism of Aaron Douglas. In the meantime, here is an exhibition of considerable merit, gravity, and joy.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the March 1, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nPablo Picasso in his boulevard Raspail studio, Paris, 1913. Picasso Archives, Musée National Picasso-Paris.\n\n* * *\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the death of the pioneering Spanish artist Pablo Picasso began a day early, at least in the pages of The Guardian. On April 7, 2023—Picasso, you see, died on April 8—the arts editor Alex Needham posted an article titled “‘Notoriously cruel’: should we cancel Picasso?” The imperial “we” stood for a bevy of artists, curators, critics, and collectors who chimed in with their respective two cents. “The lurid radicality of his art,” wrote the art historian Eliza Goodpasture, “rests on a wanton disregard for the humanity of the women he painted and slept with.” Aindrea Emelife, a curator at Lagos’s Edo Museum of West African Art, chided Picasso’s “simplistic” take on African sculpture but noted that “as a source of inspiration, it made for great art.” The non-binary performer Hannah Gadsby was mentioned as well, having been invited by the Brooklyn Museum last summer to mount an exhibition, titled “It’s Pablo-matic,” that “celebrate[d] Picasso as the perfect mascot for such a monstrously arrogant and destructive century.”\n\nMost functioning adults are aware that Picasso was far from an exemplary human being. But can the disappointments, horrors, and absurdities of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries—or, as Gadsby had it, this “dumpster fire of a world where absolutely nobody is happy”—be laid at his feet? The premise (yes, it’s ridiculous) goes some way in revealing the ahistorical nature of our cultural elites. At this date, Gadsby and her social-justice minions have maundered on their not-so-merry way, having come, seen, and fizzled. Happily, New Yorkers who care about the life of culture can take solace in the fact that there are still extant museum professionals who love art, and who make a point of demonstrating why that love is warranted—even in the case of Pablo Picasso. Cue the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art, institutions that, whatever their sundry foibles, have gone ahead and proved their\n\nindispensability.\n\nThe Met’s “Picasso: A Cubist Commissionin Brooklyn” and MOMA’s “Picasso in Fontainebleau” are, in point of fact, two of the finest exhibitions mounted this year . They are serious scholarly elaborations on an oeuvre that a casual observer might think had been exhausted. Consider: did we really need another Picasso show? Even those of us who count ourselves admirers of the work have had it up to here with its ubiquity. There must be deserving or unlikely or unheralded figures who merit at least a modicum of institutional acknowledgment. But then there are folks like Anna Jozefacka, Lauren Rosati, Anne Umland, Francesca Ferrari, and Alexandra Morrison—cumulatively, the organizers of the Met and MOMA exhibitions—who put their collective feet to the ground, did the curatorial heavy lifting, and now remind us why Picasso is an extraordinary figure. The higher-ups at both institutions should give these ladies a raise. They deserve it.\n\n“A Cubist Commission in Brooklyn” is the more eye-catching of the two shows, if only because the title pairing is so unlikely. Picasso never traveled to the United States, let alone the borough that officially became New York City’s most populous in 1930. That, and the three canvases dominating the Met’s small-scale show are, to put it mildly, idiosyncratic. Formatting isn’t everything, but it can be decisive as well as challenging for the artist, particularly when the canvas dimensions are on a ratio of, roughly, five to one. Nude Woman (1910), Man with a Mandolin (1911), and Man with a Guitar (1911/13) display our erstwhile cubist at his most stringent, especially in terms of painterly approach and composition. The latter two canvases are ruthless in their textures: rarely did Picasso layer pigment so emphatically. The monochromatic palette we recognize, and so too the fracturing of form. But the intensity of approach is atypical enough to warrant a double take. Pablo, to paraphrase the old folk song, we hardly knew ye.\n\nThe aforementioned pictures were part of a proposed eleven pieces commissioned by Hamilton Easter Field (1873–1922), a Brooklyn-based critic and collector who was himself a dab hand at painting. Field met Picasso in Paris around 1909–10 and offered him a commission to create a suite of pictures that would decorate the library of his Brooklyn Heights townhouse. As Field later recalled, “I met the new god and fell under his influence.” Just how familiar Field was with the artist’s work of the time is unclear, but Picasso was told that he would have “complete freedom. Do whatever you think best suited for the room.” The paintings themselves exude determination; Picasso was clearly enthused. But the deal was never completed, for reasons that are fuzzy (Picasso’s noncommittal correspondence) and not (Field’s death). In her catalogue essay, Jozefacka relates a story Field told to the art critic Henry McBride, about how he was concerned that Cubism might upset his mother’s equilibrium. The installation wouldn’t likely take place, Field explained to McBride, until mother had gone on to her great reward.\n\nIt’s a good story that should be taken with a grain of salt: the elderly Mrs. Field was, as it turns out, a supporter of her son’s artistic endeavors. The exhibition, in contrast, should be enjoyed at face value. Along with the aforementioned paintings, “A Cubist Commission in Brooklyn” includes three additional canvases that were also scaled to the available wall spaces in Field’s library. Though they’re handsome enough, Picasso’s painterly approach isn’t as involved, nor are the compositions quite as intensive. Perhaps their conventional formatting—landscape, ho-hum—proved overly familiar to Picasso. Elsewhere there are studies done in ink, watercolor, and charcoal, as well as documentary materials including vintage postcards of Brooklyn and a letter from Field to Picasso in which the parameters of the library are sketched out. The Met show is a prize offering of intimate proportions and an intensive opportunity to commune with an artist at the top of his game.\n\nInstallation view PHOTO: JONATHAN DORADO/MOMA, N.Y.\n\n* * *\n\nThen again, you can say the same thing about “Picasso in Fontainebleau.” The MOMA show is more expansive than “A Cubist Commission in Brooklyn,” but it is, in its own way, just as focused. If the Met show is based on a relationship that spanned years, “Fontainebleau” is dedicated to a few months: July, August, and September of 1921. At that point in time, Picasso was living large. Paintings that had been confiscated during World War I were sold at auction and then put on the market. His costume and set designs for the Ballets Russes had recently premiered, and the dealer Paul Rosenberg had commissioned a series of prints based on the work Picasso had done for Stravinsky’s 1920 ballet Pulcinella. Along with this array of professional accomplishments, Pablo and wife Olga had recently welcomed their son Paul into the world. All of which didn’t stop Picasso from getting back to work by hunkering down in the garage.\n\nYou heard right: the garage. Though it was modest in size—the installation at MOMA includes a gallery that approximates the actual dimensions of the space—the garage at his house in Fontainebleau proved surprisingly amenable to Picasso’s rather huge and seemingly contradictory ambitions. On the one hand, he had devolved painting into hieratic clusters of geometric shapes, blocky accumulations that skirted abstraction. On the other, Picasso could never abandon representation. The poet Randall Jarrell, in a provocative essay titled “Against Abstract Expressionism,” claimed that Picasso “loves the world so much\n\nhe wants to steal it and eat it.” The Spaniard would have agreed: “One must always begin with something. Then one may remove all appearance of reality; there is no longer a risk, as the idea of the object has left an indelible mark.” Even at his clunkiest—say, in Still Life with Guitar (1921)—Picasso’s appetite for the world is palpable.\n\nDuring those three months in 1921, as he was dabbing away at jaunty near-abstractions like MOMA’s Three Musicians, Fontainebleau and its more compacted cousin held by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Picasso was simultaneously channeling the art of antiquity, relishing its emphasis on volume, mass, and the human form. New Yorkers are familiar with Three Women at the Spring, long a staple of MOMA’s permanent collection, but here it’s seen in the company of a monumental companion drawing rendered in red chalk from the Musée Picasso in Paris. These pieces are surrounded by an array of additional paintings, prints, pastels, and drawings, lots of drawings. The latter go some way in reaffirming Picasso’s prodigious gifts as a draftsman. His chameleon-like ability at adopting different manners of mark-making continues to astonish. Works on paper like Woman with Dog, Olga Giving a Bottle to Paul, and a handful of studies of the Fontainebleau residence testify to his preternatural acuity in limning contours. They are thrilling to behold.\n\nThat two seemingly incommensurate bodies of work were created within the same time-frame and within a few feet of each other haslong befuddled observers. Writing in Le Populaire de Paris, a critic of the time pondered the creative wiles of “a man who can do it all, and undo it all, a Proteus. One admires it, but\n\nalso distrusts it. Where is the real Picasso?” The answer lies in the psyche of an artist who craved the implacability of tradition even as he went about testing, and sometimes lampooning, its boundaries. The dialogue that took place between the variations on Three Women at the Spring and Three Musicians must have been as contentious as it was enlivening. Imagine Picasso as the referee for a contest\n\nin which the rules are simultaneously elastic and writ in stone. For those three months at Fontainebleau, no one distrusted Picasso’s changeability as much as the man himself. In the end, that dynamic goes some way in explaining the electricity informing the work. What’s on the walls at MOMA is a gift that\n\nbears repeated viewing.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis review originally appeared in the December 2023 edition of The New Criterion.\n\nThe new documentary from Sara Nodjoumi, “A Revolution on Canvas,” poses some provocative questions, not least of which is: Are there things that are more important than art? At moments of historical consequence, creative types of all sorts are given to ponder their efficacy or relevance. When the fates of governments, cultures, and human lives are at stake, a person could think twice about, as the painter Philip Guston famously put it, “adjust[ing] a red to a blue.”\n\nThe subject of “A Revolution on Canvas,” Nicky Nodjoumi, fled his native Iran more than 40 years ago and has, since then, been living and working in Brooklyn. One hesitates, though, to call him a New York artist, and one dares not call him an American artist. Although the 81-year old painter has spent the majority of his life in the United States — including stints as a student at the New School and at City College — Mr. Nodjoumi remains an Iranian through-and-through. He is a refugee of not one, but two revolutions.\n\nBorn at Kermanshah, Mr. Nodjoumi moved to Tehran to study at the School of Fine Arts. Being from the provinces, the fledgling artist underwent ribbing for his accent, but not for his talent. He met and subsequently fell in love with a fellow student, Nahid Hagigat.\n\nWhen the two married, Ms. Hagigat’s Jewish parents weren’t particularly happy with the union — what with Mr. Nodjoumi being Muslim and all. Were mom and dad reconciled upon the birth of their granddaughter, Sara — that is to say, our erstwhile documentarian? “A Revolution on Canvas” is, as it turns out, a daughter’s reckoning with her parents and, especially, dad.\n\nMr. Nodjoumi came of age under the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. Being young, headstrong, and politically minded, Mr. Nodjoumi could not help but cheer on the Shah’s overthrow in 1979. He was ensconced, at the time, at New York City. He bought a ticket to go back home, leaving wife and young daughter in the process. Revolution was in the offing.\n\nMr. Nodjoumi took part in the Islamic Revolution, crafting posters and paintings critical of the Shah’s regime. When the mullahs took power, Mr. Nodjoumi’s fervor was quashed in fairly quick order. “Report on the Revolution,” his one-person exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art in 1980, drew the ire of the Khomeini regime and was shut down. The mullahs didn’t have a liking for anti-authoritarian imagery. Mr. Nodjoumi received word that he and his art weren’t welcome in the new Iran. He high-tailed it back to America.\n\nWhat happened to the so-called offending pictures? A good part of the film has Ms. Nodjoumi and her father attempting to determine their fate. A lot of time is spent on the phone and various screens with contacts in Iran, many of whose faces are blurred as a cautionary measure against government retaliation. A tense moment is caught on film as colleagues of the Nodjoumis attempt to enter the storage rooms of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. You can’t help but wonder: Is retrieving a picture worth putting a human life in jeopardy?\n\nAlthough touted as an “art heist thriller,” Ms. Nodjoumi’s documentary is less likely to prompt adrenalin than exasperation. When geopolitical skullduggery isn’t being touched upon, the film details the byways of the artist’s life and the compromises and shortcomings it can entail. Mr. Nodjoumi and Ms. Hagigat have long been divorced due, in large part, to the former’s unbending integrity as an artist and seemingly unappeasable appetite for revolution.\n\nMs. Nodjoumi poses some choice questions to her dad and the answers are — well, they’re tough, even as they are essayed with a distinct sense of self-irony. Mr. Nodjoumi is, though, a patient and loving grandfather: The scenes with his grandchildren are as funny and tender as you’d want them to be.\n\nOh, and it should be mentioned that Mr. Nodjoumi’s paintings are something special: acerbic, pop-wise commentaries redolent of Hannah Hoch, Georg Grosz, and Neo Rauch. You’ll see enough of them in “A Revolution on Canvas” to want to view them for real — albeit not, it should be underlined, in Iran.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the November 25, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nThe worst thing you could say about “Bellini and Giorgione in the House of Taddeo Contarini,” an exhibition that just opened at the Frick Madison, is that the glare is annoying. Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum, which has loaned Giorgione’s “Three Philosophers” (circa 1505-09) to the Frick, has seen fit to place the canvas behind glass. When this was done, I don’t know; the practice has long been commonplace. With the increased vociferousness with which the eco-righteous nitwits at Just Stop Oil are having at it with our common cultural patrimony — well, you can’t be too careful. Still, that glare? Annoying.\n\nIt may be unwise, then, to mention that the surface of “St. Francis in the Desert” (ca. 1475-80) by Giovanni Bellini is as free of glare as the day it left the artist’s studio. For those who enjoy nosing up to this-or-that painting, albeit at the risk of incurring the wrath of diligent security guards, the Frick’s decision to leave Bellini’s oil-on-panel unfettered is a boon. The role of touch in aesthetic delectation should never be discounted. That, and the natural light filtering upon “St. Francis” through the museum’s torsioned window, is like a benediction from on high. Heaven on East 75th Street — it’s real.\n\nThis inspired installation will be missed, if not permanently mourned, when the jewel of the Frick’s collection returns to its perch on Fifth Avenue and 70th Street late next year. In the meantime — or, at least, until February 4 — Bellini and Giorgione will be sharing the same space after having been separated for more than four centuries. Both pictures were once in the collection of Taddeo Contarini (circa 1466-1540), an aristocrat who lived at the Santa Fosca parish of Venice. The scion of a wealthy family, Taddeo dealt in wheat, wood, and meat, and was counted by one historian as among “the most famous intellectuals of his time.”\n\nHe certainly had good taste. We know about Taddeo’s collection from Marcantonio Michiel, a 16th-century scholar who decided to inventory the artworks he had seen in private hands throughout Venice and the Veneto. Along with “Three Philosophers” and “St. Francis in the Desert” — rightfully described by Michiel as being “wonderfully finished and refined” — the diligent studioso noted an additional two canvases each by Bellini and “Giorgio from Castelfranco,” as well as paintings by Jacopo Palma, Girolama Romanino, and a Milanese artist whose name has been lost to history. Most of the works have been lost as well, but the two that aren’t — well, they’re great.\n\n“In the House of Taddeo Contarini” should prompt New Yorkers who have become blasé about the city’s cultural largesse to revisit “St. Francis in the Desert.” It is, as a colleague at the press preview noted, a picture that keeps on giving. Giovanni Bellini was but one of a family of painters and, though older brother Gentile was a star during their lifetimes, the younger brother’s reputation has eclipsed him on the strength of his crystalline colors and technical finesse. Get up close to the Frick picture, relish its meticulous details, and consider the notion that every last thing on God’s green earth is worthy of attention.\n\n“The Three Philosophers” isn’t up to that standard, but calibrating gradations of mastery at a caliber this high can be a fool’s errand. Besides, there aren’t that many firm attributions for Giorgione. The cautious place it at three; the generous, around 10. Giorgione was something of a mystery and his imagery, too, doesn’t lend itself to ready explication. Is the Kunsthistorisches picture an homage to antiquity, with the rocky enclosure at left a stand-in for Plato’s cave? Or might it be the Three Kings, the builders of the Temple of Jerusalem, or, my favorite theory and the least likely, portraits of Bellini, Carpaccio, and Giorgione himself?\n\nThose content to let the mystery be can visit the Frick Madison and take in a tête-à-tête that’s been stalled for a good chunk of time. As you might guess, Bellini and Giorgione have a lot to say to each other.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the November 10, 2023 edition of The New York Sun."
