        "text": "About this template\n\nThis template is used to identify a 1910s documentary film-related stub. It uses {{asbox}}, which is a meta-template designed to ease the process of creating and maintaining stub templates.\n\nUsage\n\nTyping {{1910s-documentary-film-stub}} produces the message shown at the beginning, and adds the article to the following categories:\n\nCategory:Silent documentary film stubs (population: 24)\n\nCategory:1910s film stubs (population: 121)\n\nGeneral information\n\nThis is a stub template. A brief explanation of these templates follows; for full details please consult Wikipedia:Stub.\n\nA stub is an article containing only a few sentences of text which is too short to provide encyclopedic coverage of a subject.\n\nIf possible, try to find the most appropriate stub template for the article. A full list can be found at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/List of stubs.\n\nMore than one stub template may be used, if necessary, though no more than four should be used on any article.\n\nPlace a stub template at the very end of the article, after the \"External links\" section, any navigation templates, and the category tags. As usual, templates are added by including their name inside double braces, e.g. {{1910s-documentary-film-stub}}.\n\nFurther information can be found at:\n\nWikipedia:Stub\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting\n\nNew stub templates and categories (collectively \"stub types\") should not be created without prior proposal at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals. This allows for the proper coordination of all stub types across Wikipedia, and for the checking of any new stub type for possible problems prior to its creation."
