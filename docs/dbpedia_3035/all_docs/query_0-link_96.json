        "text": "A Long and Dangerous Journey\n\nFor those who travelled to Australia in the nineteenth century, the journey was often long and dangerous. In calm weather a sailing ship might take as long as four months, while a well-run clipper ship with favourable winds could make the journey in a little over half this time. These ships represented the pinnacle of sailing ship technology. With their streamlined hulls and acres of sail designed to catch even the slightest breeze, clippers were built primarily for speed.\n\nBy the 1850s it was possible to make the journey by auxiliary steamer, using a combination of steam and sail. However steam technology was still too inefficient to allow a ship to travel all the way to Australia under its own power. With the strong prevailing westerlies on the 'Great Circle' sailing route benefiting the clippers, sail continued to dominate the trade until the end of the 1870s.\n\nLife at sea was uncomfortable and often hazardous, particularly for passengers who travelled cheaply in 'steerage' (the lowest deck and below the water line). Storms were common in the Southern Ocean, but were not the only danger. Hygiene was poor at the best of times and worse in bad weather. 'Batten-down the hatches' meant passengers on the lowest deck were confined without ventilation or light in conditions that were ideal for the spread of disease. The use of candles or oil lanterns was restricted and sometimes forbidden – cramped conditions with timber, straw mattresses, hemp (rope) and tar caulking, meant a fire could spread with terrifying speed. A disaster at sea or shipwreck on the coast left little hope for rescue – few sailors or passengers could swim, and there were rarely enough life-boats for the numbers on board.\n\nSettler Origins\n\nRegardless of the difficulties in getting to Australia, it had become an increasingly popular destination for free settlers. Convicts were no longer the major source of new arrivals to the colonies. With the discovery of gold in 1851 and a booming economy, people were now coming to Victoria and Australia by choice. People came from many countries, the majority from England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, America, China and Germany. (For details, see Origins - the First Census.)\n\nHowever, not all settlers were welcomed equally – for example, from 1855-61 ship's captains had to pay poll taxes of up to £10 per head for each Chinese passenger they landed in Victoria. Word soon spread back home, and many young Chinese seeking their fortunes subsequently disembarked in South Australia and walked overland to the Victorian goldfields.\n\nChinese immigration remained controversial for many decades. The following verse from a song by Charles Thatcher perhaps encapsulates the attitude of many colonists to the arrival of immigrants from China. (Thatcher became a popular music-hall entertainer on the Victorian goldfields after his arrival in 1878).\n\nYou doubtless read the paper\n\nAnd, as men of observation,\n\nOf course you watch the progress of\n\nChinese immigration.\n\nA thousand of these pig-tailed chaps\n\nIn Adelaide are landing,\n\nAnd why they let such numbers come\n\nExceeds my understanding!\n\nNavigating the Journey\n\nNavigating the route to Australia was a complex task, requiring great skill on the part of the ship's captain, as well as the use of various navigational tools. These included the telescope, marine compass, ship's log and sextant. However, navigation was also dependent on the ship's captain having a good working knowledge of the position of the stars in the night sky.\n\nTelescopes were an essential tool of marine navigation for examining sightings of land more closely and for identifying ships passed en route. This was especially important in times of war.\n\nThe compass is an instrument used for determining the direction in which a ship is travelling. It consists of a freely moving magnetised needle, which indicates magnetic north.\n\nThe introduction of iron hulled ships such as the Great Britain created complications for the use of the compass. The metal in the hull of these ships interfered with the behaviour of the magnetic needle, requiring special adjustments and calculations to be made for accurate readings.\n\nCharts and navigation maps were developed by the Admiralty for the use of British naval and merchant ships. Detail and accuracy were very important, and many are still in use today. Charts and maps were always kept in the chartroom on board the ship.\n\nA sextant is an astronomical instrument used for taking latitude readings, by measuring the angle of altitude of the sun, moon or a star above the horizon at sea.\n\nA chronometer is a timepiece that is able to keep accurate time on board ship. It enables mariners to calculate longitude by observing the position of certain stars in the sky at specific times, and comparing their observations with the data contained in a nautical almanac.\n\nA Ship's Log looked very similar to a torpedo but was used to measure the speed of a ship. When dragged behind the vessel, movement of water past the propeller caused it to rotate, turning the small needle dials to record the distance and speed travelled.\n\nSailing Routes\n\nIn their dash to reach the Victorian goldfields in the quickest possible time, many ship's captains adopted the new 'Great Circle' route in the 1850s. Passing far south of the Cape of Good Hope, they sought the 'Roaring Forties' – the strong prevailing winds that blew from the west to the east between 40 and 50 degrees south.\n\nThis route involved enormous risks from drifting icebergs and the wild seas generated by frequent storms. It required exceptional navigational skills, as even the slightest error could lead to disaster. The large number of ships that were lost when navigating the narrow path between King Island and southern Victoria led to the West Coast of Victoria becoming known as the Shipwreck Coast.\n\nThe opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 gave ships coming from Europe an alternative route to Australia. However, as early steamers still partially relied on wind power, most shipping lines continued to use the 'Great Circle' route. It was several decades before steam engines were reliable and efficient enough to enable ships to complete the entire journey to Australia under steam.\n\nInitially, it was only mail steamers from the P & O and Orient lines that travelled to Australia using the Suez Canal. Government contracts made the route profitable for these companies.\n\n'Brief Sketches of Life onboard a Steam Vessel'\n\nExtract from transcript of Ally Heathcote's diary: Saturday, October 31st 1874\n\nWe were just wondering how long the storm would last and sending up a silent prayer for protection when crash went something on deck, and the water swept over the decks and down in the cabin, we gave ourselves up for lost and the people rushed out of their cabins looking terrified. Ma sat quite calm, I looked at her and could see her lips moving, she was pale as death and so was Papa, we did not know what had been the matter, some thought it was the cookhouse washed away but one of the passengers who is a Sea Captain went on deck and came and said it was only a little bit of the flimsy part of the bulwarks gone, the hatching had broken open in the second class cabin and they were almost able to bathe, as the water then had come in, they all had to get to work baling out, all hands were called up, even the waiters had to start baling water out of the saloon as there in some parts it was a foot deep, the windows were all smashed and the things were all floating, we in our cabin fared the best, as we had not much in comparison.\n\nLife at Sea\n\nMost migrants making the voyage to Australia in the second half of the nineteenth century set out unaccustomed to sea travel, but by the end of the journey shared an experience few others had – a passage through some of the world's most treacherous oceans. With the introduction of the faster, but more dangerous 'Great Circle' route in the 1850s, free settlers were ironically less likely to survive the journey than their earlier convict counterparts.\n\nFor 'steerage' passengers in particular, cramped and unhygienic quarters became worse when tremendous storms were encountered in the Southern Ocean. At such times, all passengers were confined below deck for days, sick and tossed around, often in complete darkness, and fearing for their lives.\n\nOur water barrels were rolling from side to side and our cans, teapots and cooking utensils were adding to the confusion by bouncing one after the other down the area between the bunks. Some of the young ladies [were] screaming and some tried to climb up the hatchways screaming to the officers to let them out.\n\n– Anne Grafton migrated from England in 1858\n\nUnfortunately, the ship's doctor was not able to offer much in the way of relief from seasickness –\n\n(It is) enough to pitch my insides out. It's all up to me. I am not able to stir. The doctor can give me no relief, but at that I am not surprised. He is very young, never been to sea and is just as ill as all the other people.\n\n– William Merrifield travelled to Australia on the Lincolnshire in 1858.\n\nDeaths at sea were tragically common. As many as one in five children, and one in 60 adults died on the voyage to Australia. For the burial, the body was sewn into a piece of canvas or placed in a rough coffin (often hastily knocked up by the ship's carpenter) and weighed down with pig iron or lead to help it sink.\n\nA plank had been placed on deck, one end over the ship's side, and upon this plank the sailors placed the body, covering it with an ensign. The sailors gently lifted the ensign and running out the plank and lifting up one end, the body dropped over the side into the water.\n\n– Thomas Park arrived in 1852 from England, aboard the Great Britain's maiden voyage.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century, Captain Cook and others had discovered that a lack of vitamin C was the cause of scurvy. The juice of oranges, lemons and limes was subsequently given to sailors and passengers to prevent death from scurvy.\n\nWater kept in wooden barrels would become very stale after a few months. Rats and mice would fall into the open barrels and drown, and algae would grow in the barrels and make people violently ill. The link between cholera and contaminated drinking water was not discovered until 1848, but even after this, ships continued to draw water from polluted rivers in ports that they visited.\n\nTo feed the sailors and passengers, stores were kept in the hold and opened as needed by the cooks. Stores such as pickled meat (pork or beef in brine) flour, sugar and dried pulses (peas) were kept on board in wooden barrels. These barrels were usually fitted with lids, but were often kept open overnight. The stores could be raided by hungry rats and mice, leaving traces from their nocturnal visits, and the grain and flour stores were often infested with weevils. Adulterated food and water caused diseases like dysentery to be commonplace, resulting in many deaths on some voyages.\n\nVinegar and chloride of lime were used to wash the wooden floors and decks of the ships, as fresh water was reserved for drinking and cooking. Cleaning with vinegar helped prevent the spread of disease and made the ship smell better. It also removed the vomit of people suffering from sea-sickness and other diseases.\n\nThe death toll among passengers squeezed into cramped and uncomfortable steerage berths on clipper ships was often very high. On one of the voyages of the Marco Polo, captained by the infamous 'Bully' Forbes, 53 passengers died. All but two were children. In contrast, the loss of only seven passengers on a voyage of the Champion of the Seas was considered as commendable –\n\nThe ship Champion of the Seas has again made a highly successful voyage to this port [of Melbourne] bringing about 400 passengers - 277 of whom are passage-warrant holders. Dr. Bowden, surgeon-superintendent, reports them to be in a highly healthy state, no diseases but measles having exhibited itself. There were seven deaths during the voyage - six of them infants not more than five years old, and one, the ship's engineer of consumption.\n\n– The Argus, November 1865.\n\n'Brief Sketches of Life onboard a Steam Vessel'\n\nExtract from transcript of Ally Heathcote's diary:\n\nFriday, October 23rd 1874\n\nAnother fearful cold day. We are starved to death almost, our good ship rolls us about in a frightful style, every meal time we have to hold on to the tables and seats and keep our cups from wandering all over the cabin. During the night, we have been constantly on the move, first one side then the other, and we have been troubled to an alarming extent during the hot weather with a brown kind of insect, a terror to tidy English matrons and maidens, and one of the ladies in my cabin says she will pin a letter onto her berth to certify that it will accommodate a regiment of things besides a lady, of course you will comprehend the name of the regiment. We have fared better than the second cabin passengers, as they have the engine right in the midst of them and it made it much hotter.\n\nIt would take up too much room to dot down all the mishaps and adventures we encounter, so I must be brief, we often as we sit down in our cabin see the water rising much higher than the bulwarks, and then we hear a rush and a hearty laugh, as it is too comical a scene to witness a lot of folks running out of the way of the sea, and it rushing after them and giving their toes a slight ducking, not many ladies appear on deck except if they have an escort, as it is almost impossible to stand alone, but tonight we had quite a grand procession headed by one of the officers and one engineer, we walked two abreast and pretty soon got quite warm. I stood inside the cook house to warm myself before going down and the cook gave me some cocoa, he is very kind and often gives us some little cakes, he says he likes to oblige the ladies, but now it is bed time and the storekeeper will be down in a minute or two to order out the lights so I must close. Today's log is Latitude 41 - 30, Longitude 13 - 25, Distance 245 knots.\n\nPrivies and Hygiene\n\nMost ships provided only basic toilet and bathing facilities. Authorities complained that even these were under used and the sailors often had to wash the upper decks which passengers used as open-air toilets. Some steerage passengers had never used a privy or a water closet before. Buckets of water were used to flush contents down to the bilges [under steerage], which were emptied when the ship finally docked at port. The smell would have been disgusting.\n\nThe toiletting process became much worse in storms, or during the night, when passengers in steerage were locked in and no lights were allowed. Accidents were messy affairs. As people did not understand the basic rules of hygiene, and toilet paper had not been invented, rags or clothes were soaked in vinegar and hung on the back of the toilet door to be used by all. This led to the spread of diseases like dysentery and typhoid. Deaths at sea were common.\n\nOn better managed ships, the areas below deck were thoroughly cleaned every few days by sailors and many of the women in steerage. Bedding which was usually made of straw, attracted fleas and cockroaches. People brought up their bedding in fine weather to shake it out and air it. However, in storms and bad weather, the bedding was often soaked through and this led to outbreaks of influenza and pneumonia. In the over crowded conditions in steerage, epidemics were common. Most victims were babies and young children, who often died of complications and lack of medical care. Infected passengers often came on board, having passed undetected through pre-boarding medical checks. Tuberculosis, an infectious disease of the lungs, was one of the most dangerous diseases.\n\nThe sleeping berths were disinfected as often as possible, using a mixture of vinegar and chloride of lime. But often the cracks in the wooden slats of the bunks harboured lice, cockroaches and fleas. It was not uncommon for rats or mice to be found in the beds and bedding.\n\nMany people in the nineteenth century didn't bathe regularly and the connection between personal hygiene and disease was not well understood. Due to the cramped and overcrowded conditions in steerage, people could not really take baths and made do with a clean-up with a damp cloth under a blanket. Most people did not have the room to change their clothing and often wore the same garments or clothing for the entire voyage. Facilities for washing clothes were very restricted. Underclothes were virtually unknown to many people at the time, deodorants were not used and many people did not clean their teeth. One can only imagine the smells of soiled nappies, grubby clothes, and unwashed bodies in a crowded environment!\n\n'Brief Sketches of Life onboard a Steam Vessel'\n\nExtract from transcript of Ally Heathcote's diary:\n\nWednesday, October 7th 1874\n\nAwoke this morning to find it raining heavily, rather a miserable day to look forward too but our folks are taking some buckets to catch the rain water as we intend having a washing day, if we are spared till tomorrow. The sailors scrubbed our cabin out this morning, they do it twice a week, Wednesday and Saturday, they use chloride of lime and it makes the boards look quite new and white, tomorrow we are hoping to cross the line and then we expect to have the trade winds, if we had been on a sailing ship, probably we should not have been any farther than the Bay of Biscay. We have some delightful evenings, and the sunsets are much more gorgeous than we see them at home. The log for today is Latitude 4 - 21, Longitude 16 - 22, Distance 188 knots.\n\nAn Assisted Journey\n\nBy the turn of the twentieth century, the journey to Australia for passengers was shorter and far more comfortable than it had been in the 1850s-1870s.\n\nBy 1914, six major companies, the Aberdeen Line, Blue Funnel Line, Orient Line, P & O Line, P & O Branch Line and White Star Line dominated the regular England-Australia run.\n\nThe opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, gave ships from Europe an alternative route to Australia. By the early 1900s, steamships had become the established method of transport. No longer dependent on the strong winds encountered on the 'Great Circle' route, many shipping lines now travelled via the Suez Canal, reducing the length of the journey to Australia to 35 or 40 days. Travel by steamer also led to reliable travelling times, and with larger iron hulls replacing the traditional wooden ones, provided increased room below deck for the passengers. The new steamers offered greater passenger comforts, including grand saloons for first-class passengers and small cabins, instead of sleeping berths in steerage class.\n\nFollowing World War I, passenger shipping was further transformed by the introduction of steam turbines, cleaner oil-fired boilers and, later, the first diesel-powered motor vessels. However, many passenger ships in this era also carried cargo to remain profitable, leading to compromises in passenger comfort, particularly in third class.\n\nMost of those making the journey to Australia in the early twentieth century were British migrants seeking a healthy and prosperous life in another part of the Empire. After World War I, it was recognised that a larger population was needed to protect the Australian nation in the event of another war. The Australian government looked to Great Britain as a source of immigrants, and encouraged those willing to consider resettlement in Australia by offering them assisted passage. British immigrants were also eligible to receive land grants, or encouraged to take labouring positions in rural areas.\n\nAssisted passage schemes were important throughout this period. The Empire Scheme, established in 1922, assisted over 200,000 British immigrants to come to Australia during the following decade, while the Big Brother Movement, founded in 1925, was responsible for sending 12,264 young boys and men to Australia.\n\nThere were a lot of young men like myself, assisted passengers, married couples and children, and a lot of younger boys going to Australia under the Big Brother Movement; people in Australia guaranteeing to look after them.\n\n– Young man, 20, migrated from England in 1923\n\nImmigration Restriction Act\n\nWhile the Australian Government encouraged British immigration with offers of assisted passage, at the same time it restricted non-Europeans, especially Asians from immigrating to Australia.\n\nThe Immigration Restriction Act of 1901, or the 'White Australia Policy' as it became known, stated that immigrants had to write and sign, in the presence of an Immigration Officer, a passage of 50 words in a European language as directed by the officer. The Dictation Test was usually first given in English. If the prospective immigrant passed, but was considered to be racially or politically unsuitable, the officer could then give the test in another European language.\n\nThe Dictation Test was given 805 times in 1902-1903 with 46 people passing, and 554 times in 1904-1909 with only six people passing. After 1909, no person passed the Dictation Test. People who failed the test were refused entry to Australia and were deported.\n\nThe most infamous case involving the Dictation Test was that of Egon Kisch in 1934. The Prague-born Jewish socialist had a valid visa for Australia, where he had come to address the Movement Against War and Fascism. However, the conservative Lyons Government was concerned that Kisch was a communist and attempted to stop him from disembarking in Fremantle. Kisch proceeded on to Melbourne, and when he was arrested, jumped from the liner onto Station Pier and broke his leg.\n\nKisch was arrested again and sent to Sydney. When he disembarked, the authorities gave him the Dictation Test in Gaelic, as he spoke English and a number of other European languages fluently.\n\nHis case was taken to the High Court and Kisch won. The Attorney-General, Robert Menzies, was humiliated in the High Court and parliament, and Kisch went on to address huge crowds throughout Australia.\n\nTo read more about Egon Kisch, go to the article \"The Big Jump: Egon Kisch in Australia\" on the National Centre for History Education's 'Ozhistorybytes' website.\n\nThe Immigration Restriction Act remained in force until 1958, when the Dictation Test was abolished, and was not fully dismantled until the introduction of the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975.

It offered comforts unheard of for the period, including a promenade deck, refrigeration, and later, electric lighting.\n\nOn its maiden voyage from London to Adelaide via the Cape of Good Hope, the Orient set a new record, making the journey in just 38 days.\n\nThe Orient originally carried an auxiliary sailing rig, but eventually became totally steam powered. Its bunkers held 3,000 tonnes of coal, and this was fed manually into the boilers to power the huge steam engines. At the stopover ports, loading coal by manual labour often took a few days.\n\nHer extensive decks provided accommodation for 120 first-class, 130 second-class and 300 third-class passengers. The first-class saloon was fitted out with ornate brass furniture and elaborate wooden carvings, whilst the music saloon boasted a grand piano and an organ amidst profusely growing ferns and dracaenas. There was an ice-making plant and other electrical equipment for the vast galleys (kitchens). On the aft-deck were stables for horses and cages for pigs, sheep and cows – destined to become fresh meat for diners in first-class. More importantly, there were plenty of lifeboats.\n\nOne of the longest serving steamships of its era, The Orient remained in service on the Australian run for thirty years.\n\nOrmonde, 1919–52\n\nThe Ormonde was originally built for the Orient Line in 1918 and served on its regular passenger and mail service between Britain and Australia until 1939.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Ormonde was chartered to the British Ministry of Transport and brought the first shipload of assisted post-war British migrants to Australia in October 1947. It continued this service over the next five years, transporting some 17,500 British migrants to Australia.\n\nJervis Bay, 1922–39\n\nThe Jervis Bay was the last of five large passenger cargo liners built for the Australian Government after the Great War. Launched in January 1922, the Jervis Bay offered mainly third-class accommodation for more than 712 passengers.\n\nLarge refrigerated holds provided 360,000 cubic metres of space to carry exports of frozen meats and dairy products for the voyage from Australia to England. On the way out from Britain the holds were fitted out with temporary partitions and bunks for extra accommodation.\n\nThe Jervis Bay continued as a migrant liner until the outbreak of World War II, then was sent to London to be fitted out as an armed Merchant Navy cruiser.\n\nRoutes and Stopovers\n\nIn the 1940s-1960s, the most common route from Britain and Europe was via the Suez Canal. There were stopovers in Port Said in Egypt, Port Aden in what is now Yemen and Colombo in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) From there, the ships travelled across the Indian Ocean to the Western Australian Port of Fremantle.\n\nThe other route was via the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. Ships taking this route travelled via Lisbon to Cape Town and then across the Indian Ocean to Fremantle, Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nShips initially returned to Europe via the Suez Canal. However, by the 1960s many were taking advantage of the increasing tourist trade and adopted a round-the-world route, returning to Europe though the Panama Canal in Central America.\n\nStopover Ports\n\n'Stopovers' were a practical necessity for passenger liners, to restock with fuel, fresh food and water, as well as to load and unload passengers. They were also an advertised attraction for migrants, many of whom had never previously travelled outside their home country. The stop-over ports were adventures, offering opportunities to meet the locals, bargain for souvenirs, and sample a heady mix of sights, sounds and smells.\n\nThe ports visited depended on the shipping line and the route taken to reach Australia. If the passengers were on lines that used the Suez Canal, they would sail across the Mediterranean Sea to Port Said in Egypt. There they entered the narrow canal and travelled through to Port Aden in Yemen, and out into the Red Sea.\n\nThe big ships went single file through the Suez Canal, and often had to 'queue' at Port Said. The passengers could go ashore and book tours to the pyramids or go on camel rides. Buying from pedlars in small boats or at exotic bazaars were entertaining novelties for most migrants travelling to Australia.\n\nWe were overwhelmed at the (Colombo) wharf by an all-pervading, enveloping aroma, which we discovered once on shore to be the smell of curries from the motley array of food stalls beyond the terminal. From one of these we tasted real fresh coconut for the first time.\n\n– Joe Vella migrated from Malta in 1955.\n\nThe liners' next stopover would be Port Aden in what is now Yemen. They would then call at Bombay (India) or Colombo (Sri Lanka, then called Ceylon) before crossing the equator on the way south to Fremantle in Western Australia. Many passengers would remain with the ship and sail to Station Pier in Melbourne or perhaps on to New Zealand.\n\nBuying souvenirs was a particularly exciting part of the stopover experience. Passengers often purchased the unusual and exotic as a keepsake of visits to places that they had never seen before and might never see again.\n\nShips, 1940s–70s\n\nIn the decades after 1948, many passenger liners berthed carrying a large proportion of the immigrants who came to Australia from post war Europe. The month long journey is still remembered by many.\n\nFairsea, 1949–69\n\nAfter serving as the aircraft carrier and troop ship HMS Charger during World War II, the Fairsea was rebuilt for migrant service in 1949. However the ship's accommodation initially left much to be desired.\n\nThe Fairsea was huge, a converted troop ship with no cabins, just huge big open spaces with triple decked bunks, so cramped you couldn't sit up straight in them. Men were assigned to one section, women to the other. The toilet and shower facilities were one huge long one, and everywhere you went there was an awful reek of 'White King'. People threw up because of the smell not just the swell!\n\n– Frank Kriesl migrated from Hungary in 1951.\n\nBetween 1949 and 1969 the ship made 81 voyages to and from Australia – for several years chartered by the Australian Government to transport assisted immigrants from Britain.\n\nOrcades, 1948–72\n\nThe Orcades was the third ship of this name to be built for the Orient Line. It was the first purpose-built passenger vessel to enter the Australian migrant trade after World War II, and set a new standard in style and accommodation – multiple saloons, shops, a hair salon, hospital, swimming pool, and a range of cabin choices.\n\nJohan Van Oldenbarnevelt, 1950–63\n\nReferred to as the JVO, the Johan Van Oldenbarnevelt was originally the largest ship ever constructed in Holland when launched in 1929. After working as a British troop ship in World War II, the JVO was refurbished and returned briefly to its previous route between Holland and Indonesia, before joining the Australian migrant trade from 1950 to 1958.\n\nCastel Felice, 1952–70\n\nWhen the former British India steamship Kenya was rebuilt as the Castel Felice after war service, it offered many conveniences including comfortable first class cabins, air-conditioning, a swimming pool and large public rooms. But for tourist class, things were still cramped.\n\nAs far as we were concerned, the Castel Felice was already in the scrap yard. The crew tried their best, but the ship was unsteady. We were eight men in a double cabin – four tiered bunks! There were no luxuries for us.\n\n– Wolfgang Kahran migrated from Germany in 1960.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1970, this ship carried over 100,000 immigrants from Italy, Germany and Britain, to Australia and New Zealand.\n\nPurpose-built liners\n\nNicknamed 'The ship of the future', the Southern Cross made waves when it came onto the migrant circuit in 1955. Big, bold and beautiful, the distinctive light-grey hull and pale-green superstructure held many modern features including fully air-conditioned cabins, stabilisers to reduce rolling, and rear mounted engines and funnel, creating space for the largest open sports deck of its time.\n\nThe Southern Cross was the first British ship launched by a reigning monarch, and is especially remembered by fare-paying British migrants coming to Australia and New Zealand.\n\nOn the uppermost deck we would play cricket matches. Movies were shown at noon, 4pm and at night. Dinner was usually three courses followed by a disco.\n\n– Kester Thomas migrated from Trinidad aboard the Southern Cross in 1967.\n\nIn 1959 the Patris became the first liner in the Greek owned Chandris fleet. The ship was popular with passengers despite having the dishonour of running aground in the Suez Canal during a sandstorm.\n\nThe Australis (1965–78) was originally launched as the luxury liner America in 1939. Two years later the ship was converted into an American troop ship and renamed the USS West Point. In 1965 it was sold to the Greek owned Chandris Line and converted to a fully air-conditioned single class ship for the Australian migrant trade. Renamed the Australis, the ship retains a significant place in our migration history as the last ship to carry government assisted migrants to Australian shores (in 1977).\n\nGalileo Galilei, 1963–77\n\nNamed in honour of the famous Italian astronomer, the Galileo Galilei was an instant hit, reducing travelling time from Italy to Australia from four to three weeks on its maiden voyage in 1963.\n\nThe Galilei and sister ship Guglielmo Marconi, were the last passenger ships purpose-built for the Australian immigrant service. Its elegant award-winning Italian design featured a novel telescopic funnel-top designed to be raised at sea to better disperse fumes and lowered to maintain appearances when in port.\n\nIt was a beautiful ship, nice, big lounge rooms, comfortable cabins. But because of strikes we had to spend three days at each port and we were given money to spend onshore.\n\n– Maria Teresa Perria migrated from Italy aboard the Galileo Galilei in 1971.\n\nAustralian Ports\n\nIn the early decades of European settlement, Australian ports were a life-line. The Australian colonies were totally dependent on ships for supplies and news from the 'motherland', Great Britain.\n\nSydney (New South Wales) and Hobart (Tasmania) served as Australia's key immigration ports in the penal era, largely because they both offered natural well-protected, deep water harbours. As agricultural and pastoral settlement spread to other Australian colonies, further ports were established at river mouths. Shallow water typically restricted large vessels from entering these ports until extensive engineering works were undertaken.\n\nDuring the 1850s gold rushes, Melbourne (Victoria) became the preferred port for migrants. By the 1880s, steamers using the Suez Canal and Cape of Good Hope routes were also regularly calling at Albany (Western Australia) and Adelaide (South Australia), with Fremantle (Western Australia) only becoming a major international port after 1900.\n\nBrisbane (Queensland) was also visited by the British mail steamers, but many other shipping services terminated at Sydney, leaving smaller coastal vessels the job of transferring migrants further north.\n\nPort of Melbourne\n\nThe first direct overseas immigrant ships to reach Melbourne arrived in 1838. Unlike the small coastal vessels that established the settlement four years earlier, these ships were too large to pass up the shallow Yarra River. People and goods were off-loaded into small boats and carried overland from Williamstown or Liardet's Beach (now Port Melbourne), creating costly and inefficient double-handling of goods.\n\nWith the discovery of gold in Victoria in the 1850s, thousands of hopefuls came pouring into Melbourne, placing enormous pressure on the already inadequate port facilities.\n\nThe Melbourne & Hobsons Bay Railways Company conceived a scheme to improve the port by building a railway line from Melbourne to a large, deep water pier at Liardet's Beach. Known as Railway Pier, it was rebuilt in the 1920s to become Station Pier. The line linking the pier to the Melbourne central station had been Australia's first steam-powered railway.\n\nParties from Melbourne are requested to raise a smoke, and the boat will be at their service as soon as practicable.\n\n– Melbourne Advertiser, 1838\n\nPort Adelaide\n\nAptly named 'Port Misery', the first regular landing place of Adelaide was situated a mile up the Port Creek (Adelaide River) where boats stuck fast in the mud-flats and new arrivals had to wade through the mire to reach the shore.\n\nOver the years facilities were greatly improved and migrants found themselves stepping from ship onto solidly constructed wharves. The construction of a railway and private telegraph line in 1855 ensured that the transfer of cargo and people from port to city was more efficiently managed.\n\nThe shore is an uninhabitable swamp, and the few people who are living in the wigwams at Port Adelaide are too busily engaged … to take any notice of a party of ladies and gentlemen up to their knees in mud trying to reach the shore.\n\n– Thomas Horton James, 1838\n\nSydney Cove\n\nI despair of being able to convey to any reader my own idea of the beauty of Sydney Harbour … (it) is so inexpressively lovely that it makes a man ask himself whether it would not be worth his while to move his household goods to the eastern coast of Australia.\n\n– Anthony Trollope, 1850s\n\nEntering Sydney Harbour was not so lovely. Sailing through 'The Heads' was notorious, and many ships came to grief. One stormy night in 1857 the immigrant ship Dunbar crashed into the rocky cliffs. The loss of all aboard, bar one went undiscovered until morning when debris and bodies greeted incoming vessels.\n\nWith so many small coves, the developing port spread to various locations. Small privately owned piers and wharfs sprang up. The handling of goods and passengers was made easier with the development of the state railway system in the 1850s.\n\nPort of Fremantle\n\nEarly shipowners considered Fremantle a port to avoid and demanded high freight rates in order to compensate for the risk of calling there. A rocky bar blocked the Swan River entrance, and the few jetties situated outside the river-mouth were exposed to the strong south-westerly winds (known as the Fremantle Doctor).\n\nFrightened migrants would have to wait for the weather to calm before making their first intrepid steps to shore. In protest, vessels headed 400 kilometres south to the safe deep-water anchorage of Albany.\n\nIn 1892 work began on creating a safe, deep and protected harbour with the first migrant ships tying up at the new Victoria Quay in 1897. From this time on, Fremantle replaced Albany on the Australian shipping route.\n\nI would not come to this port again and be obliged to discharge at this wharf, if they made me a present of the vessel.\n\n– Captain D B Shaw, 1892\n\nLand Ahoy\n\nThe first sighting of land – whether that has been by sea or from the air, has always been momentous for new arrivals to Australia. For those with long-held assumptions about what their adopted homeland might be like, the coastline could trigger delight or despair.\n\nAll we saw were trees and greenery and I just fell into my mother's arms crying. We were both crying because we thought we had come to the end of the earth. There was no city in sight.\n\n– Mariam Baker migrated from Egypt in 1966.\n\nI remember flying into Sydney and it was really early in the morning. The plane banked, and all I remember is the sun on the cliffs, and the beaches. It was so beautiful.\n\n– Juliet Wilson migrated from Canada in 1992.\n\nArrival by sea was an exciting experience. Streamers sailed through the air, creating colourful paper spider webs. Teeming crowds jostled for position, with friends, relatives, prospective husbands and employers waving, shouting, laughing and crying. Eager migrants leaned over the ship rails searching the crowd for loved ones while the band played anything from Waltzing Matilda to Greek music.\n\nThe wharf was always crowded when a migrant ship docked. There were immigration and customs officials, baggage handlers and delivery personnel, photographers, industry representatives spruiking for new recruits, welcoming parties and sightseers. Hostesses employed by the Harbour Trusts known as the 'blue' or 'red' ladies (according to the colour of their hats) were on hand to guide and assist, while community organisations such as travellers aid societies provided support, especially for the more needy. Inside the terminals, the shops and information booths opened for business.\n\nThe excitement of disembarking, however, was tempered by farewells to new shipboard friends.\n\nSoon, the people you had made friends with while on board went their separate ways, either to meet family members or sponsors; most never to be seen again.\n\n– Connie McQuade migrated from Denmark in 1960.\n\nThe end of many journeys, however, have been cause for celebration.\n\nWe all yell(ed) \"Ahhh!\". All yell and then all the people underneath there they try to climb up and all of us yell and clap hands and laugh and hug each other, yeah and hugging each other and say that \"Yeah, we made it, we made it, we made it!\" And all the sailor was singing and thanking God and all of us at that time all kneel, all kneel and pray to God and thank God that we already reach the safe land.\n\n– Mai Ho migrated from Vietnam in 1981.\n\n'Brief Sketches of Life onboard a Steam Vessel'\n\nExtract from transcript of Ally Heathcote's diary:\n\nMonday, November 16th 1874\n\nWelcome Tidings. Land at last. Though first I will just mention that all day yesterday, especially at service time, we could not stand on deck without holding to something, and last night just at bed time, the vessel went as still and steady, Ma said it awoke her coming steady all on a sudden and she lit the lamp and sat up, eating some cakes and raisins Maggie had had sent her. I suppose we had got in a calmer sea.\n\nThis morning a little after three o'clock, one of the passengers came down and called out land and lighthouse ahead, but he called out don't get up - What an idea, to tell us to lay in bed when Australian shores were in sight, you may imagine with what light hearts we quickly dressed and went up on deck. Ma and I were the only females on deck, it was so early.\n\n[..] About ½ past 4 we saw the first Australian sunrise, first thing the sky was bathed in one mass of bright red and then changed to green and an endless variety of magnificent tints, presently the sun just appeared above the edge of the water but rapidly rose to its full compass, the sky is beautifully clear and pure, far different than in the manufacturing towns in Lancashire. It is Cape Otway we have sighted, all are up and bustling about by this time seven o'clock.\n\nDiary Entry on Departure\n\n'Brief Sketches of Life onboard a Steam Vessel'\n\nExtract from transcript of Ally Heathcote's diary:\n\nMonday, September 21st 1874\n\nWe came on board with our relatives at noon, a little after them as we had to pass the Doctor, I suppose to ascertain whether we were bringing any contagious disease on board. We went below to see our future home for the following two months, the first look at our berths was not so favourable as we would have liked but we must put up with inconvenience on board a vessel like the one we had chosen for the means of transport to our adopted country. We had left our native town amid the prayers and blessings of our dear relatives and friends, and I am sure no one left their country with more prayers than did my parents, brother and sister and I. We are leaving one home to make another in the opposite extreme of her Majesty's dominions.\n\nAt the appointed hour for starting, the bell was sung for the visitors to leave the ship, we had to bid farewell to our dear relatives for a time at least and as soon as possible the anchor was drawn up and our good ship, amid the cheers of the crew and the firing off of a gun, glided elegantly out of the harbour at Gravesend.\n\nSmoothly she sailed down the Thames and we stood on the bulwark and viewed the scenery which was fine, we passed several vessels in and about the harbour, some were coming in from their outward voyage. The scenery was quite new and interesting to me but still in the midst of it my thoughts wandered to the dear ones I had just bid good-byes to. We retired to our berths at half past eight, very tired and sleepy.\n\nAlly Heathcote's diary\n\n76 page hand-written stitched journal, densely written in ink on front and reverse pages. Sheets are faintly ruled, no cover; includes loose sheet with list of Sunday services. Diary commences with a 'Preface' and then continues 'Steamship Northumberland – passage to Australia in 52 days – Brief sketches of life onboard a steam vessel'. Narrative divided into dated, day by day descriptions.\n\nThe diary has been written with a sense of audience - near the beginning is an undertaking to her uncle to keep a diary. At its conclusion there is a letter written by Ally from 88 Drummond St Carlton to her aunt and uncle which implies that she sent it to them in England. It invites them to circulate it and even to perhaps get printed in the Times.\n\nAlly's experience represents the experience of thousands of late nineteenth century migrants and provides an invaluable research tool in terms of her descriptions of shipboard life, other passengers, navigational details and first views of Melbourne. The diary concludes with a fascinating glimpse into the initial landing, Yarra Yarra and Hobsons Bay, train journey from Sandridge to the Pier and then on through Brunswick St Fitzroy to Northcote. Her style is very engaging, light, heartfelt, and sometimes humorous.\n\nThis diary was written by Ally Heathcote, from Preston in the North of England. She came out to Australia at the age of nineteen with her parents and, we think her siblings, Willie and Maggie, whom she states 'had for years thought of visiting Australia at length'. Ally also states that she had often thought of immigrating but that she 'never had the remotest idea that my dreams of travelling 16 thousand miles would ever be realised.' They left on Monday 21 September 1874, travelling on the steamship Northumberland (have considered travelling by clipper but due to her mother's health, wanted the shortest journey possible). Ally details the route, shipboard life, food, illnesses, navigational details such as longitude and latitude, distances and speed, first impressions of Australia and general feelings of excitement, the sorrow of separation, the joys and relief of arrival.\n\nFurther stories about the journeys made by Australian immigrants can be found at Melbourne's Immigration Museum and other cultural heritage organisations.
