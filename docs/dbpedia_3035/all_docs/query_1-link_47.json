I started in the olive oil industry in 2014 after a wonderful family trip to Tuscany where I first tasted true Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Needless to say I loved it! I dedicated myself to becoming a taster and joined both the COOC sensory panel and the Applied Sensory Panel in the following years. In an effort to learn all I could about olive oil I decided to study milling, a critical part of making olive oil. I completed the Master Milling course at UC Davis and have since worked in various olive mills during the harvest in California. This led me to work with Pablo Voitzuk a fellow panelist and wonderful miller and mentor. As a next step I planted a small orchard consisting of Frantoio, Coratina, Picual and Arbequina olive trees. About the same time I started managing and producing olive oil from my neighbor’s established Frantoio trees. I now split my time between our home in the Bay Area and the olive orchards in Butte county. Our Olive Love label was created out of my passion for making California Extra Virgin Olive Oils that express the unique flavor of each olive varietal and the desire to share the experience with our customers. I have judged at various competitions over the years and continue to taste olive oils for certifications as well as consulting on olive oil quality during the milling season. In the future I hope to travel to other olive oil producing areas in the world.\n\nDarrell Corti\n\nDarrell Corti of Sacramento, Calif., is a wine merchant/grocer, President of Corti Brothers, Sacramento.
