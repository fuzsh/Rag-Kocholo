        "text": "Dear Kosterina Family,\n\nThis week I watched one of those terrifying food documentaries on Netflix that overwhelm you by discussing how broken and criminal our food industry is in this country. This one was called The Magic Pill and focused on nutritional ketosis and its benefits. I must admit, despite reading a lot on this topic as of late, there was still a lot in there that was new and eye opening.\n\nThere has been some controversy over this documentary because of some claims that it makes that nutritional ketosis can help cure serious disease. I won’t address that here but there are 2 interesting elements that I took away from it:\n\n1) The food advice was very consistent with what I’ve been reading lately. The writers and producers recommend the following:\n\nEat whole foods\n\nEliminate processed foods\n\nEliminate vegetable oils\n\nEliminate grains and legumes\n\nEmbrace healthy fats – olive oil, avocado, coconut oil, animal fats, eggs\n\nAvoid dairy but if you must – eat full fat, organic\n\nSelect naturally raised animals, pastured animals, wild caught sustainable seafood, eat nose to tail, bone broths, organ meats, fermented foods\n\nFast intermittently\n\nBesides the organ meats (wholly unappetizing to me) and fermented foods (am just not there yet), this advice is what I have been focusing on and working into my diet. And it feels great.\n\n2) The most impactful scenes for me were those where a team of food experts went into people’s homes and cleaned out their pantries to rid them of foods that were processed, high in sugar or contained trans fats. In some cases, they literally threw away everything in the pantry – cereal, ketchup, oatmeal, pasta, crackers, chips, sodas, etc - and made me realize how EDUCATION is really the most important piece of making health change in this country. We will do our part at Kosterina to spread knowledge on what’s healthy and what we should and should not be eating for optimal health!\n\nIt turns out there is no magic pill but the way I see it, if we can educate ourselves on a few small changes we can make to our daily routines to reduce our risk of disease and overall improve our longevity, that could be magical."
