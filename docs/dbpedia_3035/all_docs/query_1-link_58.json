        "text": "About Olive Oil\n\n​\n\nWhat is Olive Oil?\n\nOlive oil is a “fruit juice” produced by the pressing of the olive fruit. It is naturally high in beneficial monosaturated fats and low in harmful saturated fat.\n\nOlive oils are graded on 3 things by a panel of skilled grading experts, including: the amount of free acidity, their smell (aroma), and their taste qualities.\n\nVirgin Olive Oil\n\nThis is merely a technical term referring to any olive oil that is produced purely from mechanical or other physical methods, under thermal conditions that do not cause any alteration of the oil. There are different grades of \"virgin\" olive oil.\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil is virgin olive oil of perfect aroma and flavor with a free acidity below 8%. Many of these oils are \"commercial\" extra virgin olive oils, blended to a standard maintained year to year, and to a price. They may come from different regions and countries.\n\nOther \"single-estate\" oils are often unblended, more expensive, and very pronounced in flavor. Just like grapes from wine making, the flavor of these olives can change from year to year and field to field depending on soil, humidity, moisture, and other natural factors.\n\nHow Long Does Olive Oil Last?\n\nOlive oil has the best flavor within two years of pressing. Check with us and we'll help you determine the age of your oil. Make sure you use up and replace your oils regularly for freshness and best flavor.\n\nAbout Vinegar\n\nWhat is Vinegar?\n\nVinegar is defined as “sour wine” or “a sour liquid obtained by acetic fermentation of diluted alcoholic liquids and used as a condiment or preservative.” It can be made from any fruit or material containing sugar.\n\nHow is Vinegar Made?\n\nVinegar is made by two distinct biological processes, both the result of the action of harmless microorganisms (yeast and “acetobacter”) that turn sugars (carbohydrates) into acetic acid.\n\n​\n\nThe first process is called alcoholic fermentation and occurs when yeasts change natural sugars to alcohol under controlled conditions.\n\nIn the second process, a group of bacteria (called “acetobacter” ) converts the alcohol portion to acid. This is the acetic, or acid fermentation, that forms vinegar. Proper bacteria cultures are important, timing is important, and fermentation should be carefully controlled.\n\nBalsamic Vinegar\n\nBalsamic Vinegar of Modena, Italy is made from white, sugary Trebbiano grapes grown on the hills around Modena in the region of Reggio Emilia. These grapes are cooked down to create grape “must” creating a naturally higher sugar content and resulting in a sweet and tart, well balanced vinegar. The “must” is then matured by a long and slow vinegarization process through natural fermentation. Balsamic vinegar is placed in wooden casks to begin the aging process in which it evaporates by about 10% each year, creating a thicker, sweeter substance as the years pass.\n\nWine Vinegar\n\nWine Vinegar is obtained through the acetous fermentation of a selected blend of wines. The taste is distinctly acidic, and the aroma reminiscent of the wine from which it comes.\n\nWhat is “The Mother?”\n\n“The Mother” is a naturally occurring cellulose (a natural carbohydrate which is the fiber in foods like celery and lettuce) produced by the harmless vinegar bacteria. Today, most manufacturers pasteurize their product before bottling to prevent these bacteria from forming “mother” while sitting on the retail shelf. Because our vinegars are all natural, they will, over time, form mother, considered a sign of quality by many.\n\nMother of vinegar can appear in different forms including: slimy, gummy, jelly-like substance; a thin or layering film that can form on the top of the vinegar; an overall cloudiness; or a wispy, spider-like web throughout the bottle. Vinegar containing “mother” is not harmful or spoiled. The mother can either be left alone, continuing to use as normal, or simply removed by straining or filtering.\n\n​\n\nHow is Vinegar Used?\n\nBalsamic Vinegar has a versatility that is surprising to many. It can add depth to everything from salad dressings, sauces, gravies, dips, marinades, desserts, soups, vegetables, and drizzling over cheeses and fruits.\n\nWine Vinegar can be used to bring out the sweetness in strawberries and melons, add a twist to spicy salsas and marinades and wake up the flavor of sauces and glazes. This product is perfect for today’s lighter cooking style -- replace heavy cream or butter with a splash of Wine Vinegar to balance flavors without adding fat. The tart, tangy taste also reduces the need for salt.\n\nHow Long Does Vinegar Last?\n\nBecause of its acidic nature, vinegar is self-preserving and does not need refrigeration. While some changes can be observed, such as color changes or the development of a haze or sediment, this is only an aesthetic change. The product can still be used and enjoyed with confidence."
