These are my favorite films from the period 1910-1919. The 1910s are an interesting time in film history. Feature-length pictures became the norm, and Hollywood emerged to dominate the market, while the First World War devastated the European movie industry. Read my reviews on IMDb for more on what I enjoyed about these films. Links are posted at the bottom of the films' summaries in this list.

And of the 25 Best Films of the 1900s (1900-1909)

In case you're interested, here are some relatively popular films of the decade that didn't make my list, and you may click on the title links to glean why from my IMDb reviews: Cabiria (1914), Les vampires (1915), Amarilly of Clothes-Line Alley (1918), Stella Maris (1918) and Male and Female (1919)

Also, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" isn't included because it was released in 1920, and someday I want to make a list of 1920s films, too, which will surely include it.
