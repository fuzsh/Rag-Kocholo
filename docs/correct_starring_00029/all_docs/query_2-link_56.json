        "text": "It’s everyone’s dream to star in a Disney Channel show, right? Even major celebs have tried to nab a role on the famed network over the years!\n\nJoe Jonas, for example, ended up starring alongside his brothers Nick and Kevin Jonas in JONAS and Camp Rock, but he actually auditioned to be a Disney star long before singing “We Rock” alongside Demi Lovato. It’s been reported that the New Jersey native tried out to be Justin Russo on Wizards of Waverly Place. Ultimately, the role went to David Henrie who played the eldest Russo sibling for the show’s four seasons from 2007 until 2012.\n\nLana Condor also has a pretty epic Disney audition story! Before she starred in To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, the actress almost appeared in High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.\n\n“I was the biggest High School Musical fan when I was a child. [I was like] oh my God, I want to be Gabriella. I thought it was so cool,” the Netflix star told Teen Vogue in January 2020, noting that she forgot about the audition until “seeing some things on Instagram.”\n\n“I think I, honest to God, might have auditioned for that. I don’t think it was Disney+ when I shot for it, I think it was just Disney,” Lana recalled. “They didn’t want us to sing High School Musical songs, which I’m sure everyone was like, OK I’ll go in and sing ‘We’re All in This Together’ or whatever. So I don’t know what I did.”\n\nWhile she didn’t get the part, Lana called the entire experience “an amazing memory” nonetheless.\n\nFans also might be surprised to know that before Miley Cyrus was cast as Miley Stewart and Hannah Montana in Hannah Montana, she tried out for another role instead. It’s been reported that, instead of the lead, Miley had dreams of playing Lilly Truscott. The role of Lilly went to Emily Osment instead and Miley kicked off her double life as the show’s title character, who changed her life.\n\n“Since the first time I slid those blonde bangs over my forehead in the best attempt to conceal my identity, then slipped into a puke-pink terrycloth robe with a bedazzled ‘HM’ over the [heart]. I didn’t know then … that is where you would live forever,” Miley shared via social media when celebrating the Hannah Montana 15-year anniversary. “Not just in [my heart], but [in the hearts of] millions of people around the world. Although you are considered to be an ‘alter ego,’ in reality there was a time in my life when you held more of my identity in your glove than I did in my bare hands.”\n\nScroll through our gallery to see which other celebs auditioned for Disney Channel shows."
