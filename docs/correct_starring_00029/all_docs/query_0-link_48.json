Members of a leading musical group, Connect 3, go to a camp for aspiring young music artists where one becomes a guest instructor in an effort to counter his bad boy rocker image.

She can only spend her summer at the camp by helping her mom work in the mess hall between classes.

Together, Mitchie and the boys learn to believe in themselves and to value the freedom to be who they want to be. Directed by Matthew Diamond.
