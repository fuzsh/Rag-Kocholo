        "text": "The premiere of Disney’s exhilarating rock ‘n roll musical “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,” starring Demi Lovato and Jonas Brothers, will be presented across Labor Day weekend with four event telecasts -– each celebrating music and dance with a storyline that suggests life is about the way you play. The fun for kids, tweens and families begins FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 3 and goes through MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 6 (8:00 p.m., ET/PT, each night) on Disney Channel. An extended edition of the movie, featuring two exclusive new music numbers, will be available on Disney Blu-ray Combo Pack and DVD on Tuesday, September 7.\n\nThe soundtrack, featuring 15 songs spanning hip-hip, rock and pop/rock performed by the cast, releases on iTunes and in stores nationwide, Tuesday, August 10.\n\nThe 2008 premiere of “Camp Rock” was cable TV’s #1 entertainment telecast of the year in Total Viewers (10.1 million) and TV’s #1 entertainment telecast in Tweens 9-14. Among TV’s live action movies, it was #1 among Kids 6-11 for the year.\n\nThe sequel, choreographed by Rosero McCoy, is a tour de force for actress and recording artist Demi Lovato. It showcases both the music and charm of Kevin, Joe and Nick Jonas, and includes their younger brother Frankie Jonas in his TV movie debut. The highly anticipated sequel also brings back fan favorites from “Camp Rock,” 2008’s #1 cable TV movie. They are: Maria Canals-Barrera (“Wizards of Waverly Place”), Meaghan Martin (“10 Things I Hate About You”), Alyson Stoner (“Phineas and Ferb,” Step Up 3D”), Anna Maria Perez de Tagle (“Fame”), Jasmine Richards, Daniel Fathers, Roshon Fegan (Disney Channel’s upcoming “Shake it Up”) and Jordan “J” Francis. “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam” introduces two exciting new performers, Matthew Mdot Finley and Chloe Bridges. Daniel Kash also stars.\n\nThe sequel follows Mitchie and her friends as they return to Camp Rock for another great summer of music and fun. But when big-money, state-of-the-art Camp Star opens across the lake, it lures away many instructors and campers — putting the future of Camp Rock in jeopardy. Mitchie emerges as a leader determined to save the camp and challenges the egocentric Luke Williams and his fellow Camp Star campers to a Final Jam — an end-of-summer performance duel, may the best camp win.\n\nThe schedule for the world premiere of “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam” is:\n\nWednesday, September 1:\n\n“Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam” available on Disney Channel on Demand for Verizon FiOS subscribers (also available via select affiliates).\n\nRadio Disney presents part one of “On the Set,” a special telecast from the set of “Camp Rock: 2 The Final Jam” (6:00-8:00 p.m., ET/3:00-5:00 p.m., PT).
