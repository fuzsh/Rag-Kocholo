He is best known as a writer, standup comic, and field producer for Trevor Noah’s The Daily Show. His full-length documentary The Neutral Ground started filming in 2015 “when simply relocating confederate monuments was hard for many to even imagine….and we can end our story in a moment when removals have become routine,” he reflects. “It is stunningly clear how our fight about monuments is part of a larger battle against the ways white supremacy has built itself into our world – pretending to be neutral and immovable.” He further explains, “It is not just a film about white supremacists being bad. It is a film about how we figure out who we are and what we cling to even when we know it’s not true.” Hunt draws upon his own emotions about growing up mixed race in the suburbs. His multiracial heritage and ambiguity are part of the story."
