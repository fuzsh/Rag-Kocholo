        "text": "Hey guys! I just visited Anna Maria Perez de Tagle on the set of her newest movie Fame! You know Anna Maria from the TV show Hannah Montana and also as super funny Ella in Camp Rock. Well, Fame is her very first big screen project and she’s so excited! It’s about a group of kids who attend a performing arts school and follow their dreams. Her character’s name is Joy, an aspiring actress. I can’t tell you too much yet, but I did get lots of juicy tidbits and behind the scenes secrets from Anna – you’ll just have to keep checking Daily Dish as well as our magazines BOP and Tiger Beat.\n\nAnna Maria also told me what she’s been up to since making the hit movie Camp Rock last year. She recorded the song “Part Of Your World” for an upcoming Disneymania album that will be released later this year. I also got the dish on what’s going on with Camp Rock 2! Anna spilled that the entire cast will be back (OMJ!!!) and they’ll start filming at the end of 2009. Her pals the Jonas Brothers were super excited for Anna when she got cast in Fame; she told Nick about her casting via web chat."
