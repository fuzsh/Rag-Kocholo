        "text": "Liza Soberano met another Filipino-American actress in Hollywood, and it was none other than Anna Maria Perez De Tagle.\n\nThe two stars met at a screening of Liza’s international debut film “Lisa Frankenstein.”\n\nIn an Instagram post, Anna Maria said that she “thoroughly enjoyed it!\"\n\nThe “Hannah Montana” and “Camp Rock” actress had nothing but praise for Liza.\n\n“If there’s one reason to go watch @lisafrankensteinfilm, it’s to see @lizasoberano shine as her character—Taffy,” she said, and added that Liza was her favorite in the movie.\n\n“[It] makes me so proud to see a fellow Filipina-American actress be the breakout star!” she added.\n\n“Lisa Frankenstein” premiered in Philippine cinemas on February 7.\n\nIt is inspired by the gothic novel \"Frankenstein\" by English writer Mary Shelley. The movie follows Lisa (played by Kathryn Newton), a misunderstood teenager, and her love interest who happens to be a handsome corpse (played by Cole Sprouse).\n\nLiza plays Taffy, the popular yet kind girl who is also Lisa’s stepsister.\n\nThe film is Liza’s Hollywood debut and she looked like a true star at the premiere. She said that it is the “kind of movie I've always wanted to do.”\n\nLiza’s performance has been receiving rave reviews from fans and critics alike. American filmmaker Jo Russo and Liza’s boyfriend Enrique Gil are also among those who are impressed."
