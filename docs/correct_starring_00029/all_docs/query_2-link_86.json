        "text": "With the amazing Hollywood ambiance at the inaugural Manila International Film Festival (MIFF) held at the Directors Guild of America, Filipinos and Fil-Ams dressed to impress or simply make a fashion statement on the gold carpet of the historic event.\n\nThere was also a long red carpet lined up with blown-up posters of the 10 films being spotlighted if one preferred to do one's grand entrance there.\n\nThe women, whether actresses or producers, filmmakers or writers, were dressed to the nines. But the men, whether they be actors or directors, or aspiring filmmakers, were not to be outdone, too.\n\nThe Philippine actresses were looking all elegant in their respective gowns – Eugene Domingo in a black gown (\"Becky and Badette\") clutching the black bag made by her relative; Ysabel Ortega (\"Firefly\") in an off-shoulder Anthony Ramirez black ballroom gown and Janella Salvador (\"Mallari\") also in her black outfit.\n\n\"GomBurZa\" actor Enchong Dee, who portrayed Padre Zamora, was wearing a royal blue suit by Filipina designer Boom Sason and matched it with a pair of black Versace boots.\n\nCedrick Juan, who ably portrayed Padre Burgos in the 2nd Best Picture and Audience Awardee film \"GomBurZa,\" wore suit and slacks made by his cousin Wendell Ramos Sable.\n\nAll the Philippine actors looked great in their respective suits – Best Actors Piolo Pascual (\"Mallari\") and Dingdong Dantes (\"Rewind\"), Christopher de Leon (\"When I Met You in Tokyo\"), John Arcilla (\"Penduko\"), Christian Bables (\"Broken Heart's Trip\"), Ron Angeles (\"Mallari\") and Alden Richards (\"Family of Two\").\n\nTV host-newscaster and award-winning actress Kaladkaren (\"Here Comes the Groom\") was a goddess in her sea foam blue off-shoulder Ehran Montoya gown with a revealing high slit in front. It was adorned with silver dangling details combined with Montoya's Chrysalis signature fabric manipulation. Kaladkaren was also one of the co-hosts at the celebratory MIFF gala.\n\nGMA Network's Senior Vice President and Sparkle Head Annette Gozon-Valdes made a statement on the red carpet with her very intricately designed Zimmermann black puffed-sleeved gown with white artistically made designs. Together with \"Firefly\" actress Ysabel, she accepted the awards on behalf of Zig Dulay (Best Director and Best Picture) and Alessandra de Rossi (Best Actress). Also representing the \"Firefly\" team was GMA Sparkle Assistant Vice President for Talent Development and Management Department Joy Marcelo who was also elegant in her Mark Bumgarner black gown.\n\nFil-Am actress Anna Maria Perez de Tagle (\"Camp Rock\" and \"Camp Rock 2\") wore a black Mac Duggal with feather accents on her shoulders.\n\nFil-Am actors were not to be outdone by their Philippine counterparts. Actor Kian Talan (\"NCIS: Hawaii,\" \"The Good Doctor,\" \"Brainchild\") wore a Valentino blazer and paired it with a white shirt from Shades of Grey by Micah Cohan. He wore his Calvin Klein jeans and Eytys boots to complete his look.\n\nCarlin James was handsome in his Topman suit (\"Better Call Saul,\" \"American Crime Story,\" \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\").\n\nJuror Reggie Lee (\"CSI Vegas,\" \"Grimm,\" \"Pirates of the Caribbean\") looked dapper in his Vinta Gallery barong Tagalog, black Oliver Tolentino pants and black Hugo Boss pair of shoes.\n\nBroadway-TV-film actor Jon Jon Briones (\"Miss Saigon,\" \"Ratched,\" \"The Assassination of Gianni Versace\") was looking great in his Armani suit and Barker shoes.\n\nZedrick Restauro (\"How to Get Away with Murder,\" \"The Assassination of Gianni Versace\") was looking sharp in his red Coofandy blazer, Bylt pants and Stacy Adams shoes. JB Tadena (\"Kung Fu,\" \"SEAL Team,\" \"Hawaii Five-O\") was equally striking in his Bar III red suit.\n\nOf course, there were also the fashion designers who arrived with their models in tow.\n\nOne of the designers present that night was Alexis \"Bong\" Monsanto who dressed up juror Mari Acevedo of Birns & Sawyer. Birns & Sawyer donated the $200,000 co-producing package to the Best Picture awardee which was \"Firefly.\"\n\nMari Acevedo wore one of Monsanto's dresses from the Alexis Monsanto F/W'22 collection. Monsanto described her look: \"A black ITY in Mermaid cut skirt with Swarovski crystals details on the sides, the blouse is Sunburst pleated red chiffon bubble cut with bow detail on the neck. A pearl color silk wool cape with red suede trims kept her warm throughout the evening. Jewelry and clutch bag by Charlie Lapson, her bling as hair pieces with black silk flowers on top of the head completes the sophisticated look that earned her the 'Queen of the Night' as the last to present the Best Picture category on stage.\"\n\nMonsanto explained, \"I opted for this black-red-cream number as an understated elegance. As you can see it's all about the cut, style and finest fabrics. The dress has 'minimal bling,' thus making her 'effortless. The overall look is yet classy and very sophisticated, that's an Alexis Monsanto, a signature of personal style.\"\n\nAlso wearing a Monsanto number was Desiree Estrella, CEO of Anaverdes Villas Inc., the mother-in-law of MIFF President Ebradu Udarbe, who wore a dress from the AM F/W'22 collection. A black corset organza with flower embroidery on the A-line skirt was accented with a voluminous red ruffled silk taffeta shawl top. The same top and lavender color that Patricia Fields' team ordered for Season 2 of \"Emily in Paris.\"\n\nModel Olga Aleksa Gure, supermodel and former Ms. Russia LA arrived on the red carpet drop-dead gorgeous in a silver-gray sunburst pleated chiffon and laser-cut backless top. A long cape with marabou feathers along with Charlie Lapson Jewelry and clutch completes the dramatic look.\n\nFashion designer Monsanto was also looking sharp in a Monsanto Uomo black velvet bespoke number. All in a black shirt with black and white ascot to complete his winter look.\n\nOliver Tolentino dressed up actress Pinky de Leon who also presented the first Monty Manibog Lifetime Achievement Award to colleague actress Hilda Koronel. Pinky wore a black ombre off-shoulder hand-draped georgette gown.\n\nThe Beverly Hills-based Tolentino also dressed up actress Aina Dumlao (\"MacGyver,\" \"Ballers,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"The Unusual Suspects\") in a champagne tulle ball skirt with different shades of purple floral lace applique.\n\nPinky de Leon's guests, her daughter, Michelle Kuper, was radiant in her silver Michael Kors off-the-rack off-shoulder gown while Camille Agbayani was sexy in her spaghetti-strapped red Ellie Saab gown and matched it with a mini croc Kelly handbag.\n\n\"Inside Edition\" host Victoria Recano wore also an Oliver Tolentino black lace cocktail dress with hand-sewn black applique.\n\nLA-based fashion designer Alan del Rosario dressed Hilda Koronel, the first Monty Manibog Lifetime Achievement awardee of the MIFF, in a black caped gown with minimalism in mind. Del Rosario said, \"Hilda wanted something warm and comfortable, so I designed her a black caped gown and added pearl and Swarovski crystal trim around the neckline as an accent. The cape is detachable to create a whole new look. It also has a flounce sleeve detail to give it a complete look. I got the fabric from Paris from the Chanel collection. It's a stretchy boucle fabric with black metallic yarns.\" She was also carrying an Alexa bag from the Viktorya-Minaudiere.\n\nDel Rosario also dressed up Diego Sebastian Lopez, the son of Hilda Koronel at the star-studded event. As for the designer himself, he opted for an Emporio Armani suit.\n\nLas Vegas-based fashion designer David Tupaz dressed up Binibining Pilipinas International 2010 titleholder and philanthropist Krista Kleiner stole the red carpet with her Maranao-inspired ensemble that Muslim princesses wore as seen on the traditional dance singkil. David said he added the grand opera coat to make it Hollywood plus the headpiece that the native Southern Filipinas wore in traditional beads and wood elements. Tupaz said, \"I used the same material as the gown but added crystals, bugle beads that hang, and feathers, making it a modern version.\"\n\nTupaz also dressed MIFF co-founder and executive producer Lisa Manibog Lew, Bb. Pilipinas International 1982 and eight-time Emmy Award winner, in one of his couture outfits. Lisa wore a short terno inspired by the days of LVN and Sampaguita Pictures in a black sequined Italian lace with a short inner lining, so it is see-through for the legs to show under the sheer lace.\n\nTupaz, wearing one of his collections himself, was in an elegant black matte sequined suit with black Swarovski crystal accents embroidered, black on black, crawling on one side of the coat and extending to the back. His shoes are sequined on fabric poly shoe material. Tupaz explained the look, \"My inspiration is the native Filipino tattoo artists who tattoo in black ink – the Tausugs, and other native tribes from times gone by. The material is also sequined embroidery.\"\n\nAmiel Noble of Noble Creations was also inspired by the country's tattoo artists of the Philippines but mainly by the oldest one and former Vogue Philippines cover girl, 106-year-old Apo Whang-Od from the village of Buscalan in Kalinga, Philippines.\n\nThe soft-spoken and humble fashion designer from Lumban, Laguna was wearing a black pina barong hand painted in gold of Kalinga tribal pattern in front and a portrait image of Apo Whang-Od as a tribute to the oldest \"mangbabatok\" (traditional Kalinga tattooist) and in celebration of her upcoming 107th birthday come February 17.\n\nAlso wearing Noble creations were husband and wife, journalist Steve Angeles and MIFF coordinating producer Meriden Angeles who are expecting their second child. Both were wearing matching hand-painted barong Tagalog and terno both in pink.\n\nDigital content creator Jucevi Virtudes was also wearing a Noble hand-painted barong styled as a bomber jacket. The front and back were painted with an image of a lion.\n\nLionsgate's newly promoted from Director to Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Bianca Nepales was also wearing a Noble bomber barong jacket of black and beige color with the traditional \"pichera\" embroidery at the front, both a classy and modern take on a barong that goes well in a chilly season like ours today.\n\nSinger Bunny Paras was also wearing a crop poncho panuelo blouse in black, both traditional yet modern look paired with a high and low skirt. She also accented the look with a Gabrielle clutch bag from Viktorya-Minaudiere.\n\nChef Marvin Aritangco was wearing an all-black pina \"raya\" barong. It is definitive with calado hand-embroidered columns both at the front and back including the sleeves.\n\nThe Mestizo LA's Gabriel \"Gabe\" Gonzales and Robert Kolosso both wore, of course, Mestizo LA barongs to the sold-out event at the DGA. Singer Garth Garcia wore one of their collections and paired the barong with black Valentino pants and belt, a Garth Garcia custom made logo clutch bag for men from Viktorya-Minaudiere, and a pair of black Valentino shoes.\n\nAlso wearing a Mestizo LA bolero is singer-actress Debralee Daco.\n\nAvant-garde fashion designer Kenneth Barlis, who dressed up singer Dessa in his custom pink beaded gown for her opening performance for the gala, was a scene-stealer in his men's version of the modern Filipiniana complete with black gloves!\n\nThe former Project Runway star explained, \"The butterfly sleeves are always associated with females, but we are in a modern world now where gender identity holds no boundaries. So, I decided to create a version for men to celebrate our culture in Hollywood with no gender boundaries. And I wore it to show to our kababayans that it's time to welcome the new look of the Filipino culture in Hollywood.\"\n\nBarlis also dressed up America's Favorite Dermatologist, Dr. Tess Mauricio in his very first red sequined bolero. The stylish dermatologist who arrived with singer-client Apl de Ap and her husband Dr. James Lee, paired the bolero with a red House of Harlowe crop top ensemble, a red Hermes Crocodile Birkin bag, and a pair of red Gucci shoes. Dr. Lee, on the other hand, was wearing a gray Hugo Boss suit and shoes.\n\nAlso wearing her creation is fashion designer Pia Gladys Perey in her red off-shoulder Parker dress. \"It will be exclusively available on our website and Macy's starting in April,\" she informed us.\n\niSkin Med Spa owners and MIFF sponsors, Richard and Imee Ong Maghanoy, also made their presence felt on the red carpet with their outfits – Imee in her Gucci gown, Chanel shoes, Cartier jewelry, Viktorya bag of Viktorya-Minaudiere while Richard was dapper in his Versace suit and Christian Louboutin shoes.\n\nFilAm Creative executive Jennielyn Abrot was gorgeous in her sexy nude-colored Lovesome gown with spaghetti straps.

Pioso dressed up MIFF guest Desiree Baker in an elegant black sequined plunging neckline terno with a high slit in front. She also matched it with one of Pioso's signature custom-made bags with an American Flag design.\n\nPioso explained the look, \"The theme for my black Filipiniana gown and my luxury clutch American flag is 'Philippines goes to Hollywood, United States of America.' The black Filipiniana gown represents our beautiful country, the Philippines. The butterfly accents on the front and the sleeves are reminders that we can all fly high or dream big. My American luxury clutch represents our freedom to dream big here in the USA. The red, white, and blue striking colors symbolize how beautiful and powerful the United States of America is as a country and how lucky we are that the United States embraces us Filipinos, our culture, our lifestyle, our fashion, and our Filipino movies.\"\n\nFilAm Creative executive and founder Mark Labella chose a Buddy Reyes barong Tagalog for the prestigious event. \"He's a local Quezon province designer,\" Mark told us.\n\nCarl Andrada of Carmelo Designs dressed yours truly and my husband Ruben V. Nepales in his couture Filipiniana terno and barong Tagalog. Andrada described his creation for us, \"It is a canary Filipiniana made from the eco-friendly Musa fabric (handwoven banana fiber by the People Deprived of Liberty from Davao del Norte Correctional Facility as part of their rehabilitation and added income to help their family while they are in the facility under the supervision of the DTI Davao region).\n\n\"Inspired from the rays of the sun, this Filipiniana best represents the sunny personality of Janet, unafraid of no one and a risk taker, most especially of her clothing.\"\n\nBy coincidence, bag designer Maria Victoria Mejia of Viktorya-Minaudiere provided yours truly with her Bella Fleur bag. \"Bella\" with the reference to \"Banana\" and the French word \"fleur\" meaning flower. It captures the essence of the banana blossom as a beautiful and unique flower that is found in tropical areas like the Philippines. This bag was meticulously crafted using Mother of Pearl with fine shell cracking inlay.\n\nAs for Ruben's barong Tagalog, Andrada described, \"This jusi embroidered barong is a tribute to the traditional handwoven technique of the Itneg tribe of Northern Luzon. The orange and black panel is made of Binakol fabric, an ancient woven tradition of the said tribe. Binakol used to be a ceremonial cloth for protection. The look was accessorized with a sash also made from Binakol fabric.\"\n\nAlso wearing an Andrada couture gown was Miss Filipina International Matea Mahal Smith who is wearing a body-hugging silver spaghetti-strapped gown with Swarovski crystals and other accents. Matea is bound for the Philippines to compete in the upcoming Miss Universe Philippines.\n\nAlso using Viktorya-Minaudiere were recording artist Tootsie Guevara who was carrying the new \"Marie\" collection which is shaped like a shoe. According to Mejia, \"This exquisite line pays homage to my roots in Marikina City, known as the shoe capital of the Philippines. Inspired by the rich heritage and craftsmanship of Marikina's shoemaking industry, the Marie collection showcases a fusion of elegance, innovation and timeless style. Each meticulously crafted shoe in this collection tells a story, capturing the essence of Marikina's legacy while embracing contemporary design elements.\"\n\nOther MIFF officers and co-founders also dressed up for the historic occasion – chairman Omen Ortiz looked amazing in his Hermes suit and tie and Canali shoes; president Ebradu Udarbe was great in his Indochino suit and Christian Louboutin shoes; ticketing manager Celia Abaya Dy was resplendent in her green off shoulder Armhand Remojo couture gown from the Philippines with Long Hill jewelry and Badgley Mischka shoes; Chief Operations Officer Erickson Ilog was dapper in his ORTTU Cristobal jacket and ORTTU Brunello pants and Gucci shoes; Chief Marketing Officer Ron Ramores looked relaxed in his favorite Zara Men's suit and Christian Louboutin shoes; and Chief Financial Officer Leo dela Cruz was looking handsome in his tux by John Varvatos and Christian Louboutin shoes.\n\nWill next year's MIFF be LA's answer to NY's Met Gala? We can't wait and see."
