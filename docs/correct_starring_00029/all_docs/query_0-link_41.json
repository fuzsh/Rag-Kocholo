        "text": "She joins previously announced cast members Hunter Parrish (as Jesus), Wallace Smith (as Judas), Uzo Aduba, Nick Blaemire, Celisse Henderson, Morgan James, Telly Leung and Lindsay Mendez.\n\nAnna Maria Perez de Tagle is best known for her role as Ashley Dewitt on the Disney Channel's hit series \"Hannah Montana.\" Her other performing credits include acting, singing and dancing in \"Camp Rock\" (Disney/Sudden Motion), the motion picture \"Fame\" (MGM/Lakeshore) and the recent \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam.\"\n\nThe rock musical that relates parables of Jesus begins performances at Circle in the Square Theatre Oct. 13 prior to an opening night of Nov. 7.\n\nThe musical will feature direction by Daniel Goldstein and choreography by Tony Award nominee Christopher Gattelli.\n\nGodspell is produced by Ken Davenport, Edgar Lansbury, Broadway Across America, Hunter Arnold, Luigi Caiola, Rose Caiola and The People of Godspell. Associate producers include Michael McClernon. Complete casting will be announced soon. Godspell also features scenic design by David Korins, costume design by Miranda Hoffman, lighting design by David Weiner, sound design by Andrew Keister, orchestrations by Michael Holland and musical direction by Charlie Alterman.\n\nGoldstein reunites the designers of the critically acclaimed 2006 Paper Mill Playhouse conception of Godspell for this new Broadway production that has been \"completely re-imagined\" for the Circle in the Square, Broadway's only in-the-round theatre.\n\nConceived and originally directed by John-Michael Tebelak with music and new lyrics by Academy and Grammy Award winner Stephen Schwartz (Wicked, Pippin), Godspell — a hip musical re-telling of the New Testament's Gospel of Matthew — made its New York City premiere in May 1971. The show was an Off-Broadway and Broadway smash in the 1970s. The Tony-nominated score features the songs \"Day by Day,\" \"Turn Back, O Man,\" \"Learn Your Lessons Well, \"Prepare Ye the Way,\" \"Light of the World\" and many more.\n\nGodspell features a score by Schwartz and a book by John-Michael Tebelak. The musical, the producers say, uses \"improvisation and contemporary themes to illustrate the parables, [bringing] these lessons to life through the grand tradition of musical theatre.\"\n\nAfter a five-year run Off-Broadway (the musical opened at the Cherry Lane Theatre May 13, 1971, and transferred to the Promenade in August of that year), Godspell opened at Broadway's Broadhurst Theatre in June 1976. It eventually played both the Plymouth and Ambassador theatres before closing Sept. 4, 1977, after 527 regular performances.\n\nTickets are $125 for all performances except Saturday evenings, which are $135. Tickets are available by calling Telecharge.com at (212) 239-6200 or by visiting www.telecharge.com/godspell.\n\nVisit www.godspell.com for more information.\n\nThe box office for walkup sales opens Sept. 15."
