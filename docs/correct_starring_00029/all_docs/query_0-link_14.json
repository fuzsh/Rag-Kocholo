        "text": "Lilly, Do You Want to Know a Secret?\n\nMiley has to confront her best friend about her true identity as a pop star, but worries about how she'll react. Jackson uses Hannah Montana's popularity to score a date, then begs his dad for money.\n\nIt's a Mannequin's World\n\nRobby has a long history of choosing the wrong birthday present for Miley. In order to nip it in the bud this year, Lilly and Miley work up an elaborate plan in which Lilly will go shopping with Robby and Miley will pose as a mannequin displaying Hannah Montana clothing so that Miley can point out what she wants. The plan backfires when Robby goes back and exchanges what he bought in favor of an item he feels in more unique. The item turns out to be an ugly swimsuit which Miley is forced to wear to her surprise birthday party at the beach.\n\nMascot Love\n\nMiley and Lilly want to spend more time together, so they try out for cheerleader. Only this time, Lilly lands in the limelight with a spot on the squad, while Miley is in the background as Mascot.\n\nOoh, Ooh Itchy Woman\n\nOn a school camping trip, Miley and Lilly strike back at Amber and Ashley with a fake bear attack. However, their retaliation ultimately serves to backfire when the bush they'd hidden in turned out to be poison oak and Miley can't contain her itching during a televised interview with a popular VJ. Robby and Jackson attempt to catch a mouse on the loose and come to appreciate its musical talents instead.\n\nNew Kid in School\n\nWhen \"Jake Ryan,\" a famous TV actor, enrolls in Miley's school and reaps the benefits of all the preferential treatment, Miley reconsiders whether or not to keep her secret as Hannah Montana. Jackson borrows Robby's car and accidentally puts a scratch on it, unaware that Robby has accidentally done more damage than that to Jackson's own vehicle."
