        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton WRITTEN BY: Francesca LaMantia\n\nWe've been thinking about the “School of Rock” cast. Where are they now? For this list, we'll be looking at what the cast of this classic movie are up to now. Our countdown includes Miranda Cosgrove, Kevin Clark, Adam Pascal, and more!\n\nThere’s no way you can stop the School of Rock. Welcome to MsMojo, and today we’ll be discussing the School of Rock Cast: Where Are They Now?\n\nFor this list, we’ll be looking at what the cast of this classic movie are up to now.\n\n#13: Adam Pascal\n\nPascal played Theo, the jerky rocker that brutally kicked Dewey out of the band. It was only his second film role at the time, but following “School of Rock”, Pascal continued his acting career in a number of film and TV roles. Most notable is the reprisal of his role as the lamenting guitarist Roger in the film adaptation of the Broadway play “Rent”. He also returned to “SLC Punk 2”. But Pascal has really made a name for himself on the stage. He’s had roles in major Broadway musicals including “Chicago”, “Cabaret”, “Memphis”, “Pretty Woman: The Musical”, and “Something Rotten!”.\n\n#12: Mike White\n\nMost of the adult actors in this film had established careers beforehand. White both starred in “School of Rock” and added it to his list of writing credits. Afterwards, he co-created the series “Enlightened” with Laura Dern. He and Black reunited on “Nacho Libre”. He’s also written films like “The Emoji Movie” and “Pitch Perfect 3”. And in 2019 he was runner up on Survivor! His adult co-stars have also enjoyed continued success. Joan Cusak already had two Oscar nominations under her belt, and in 2015 picked up an Emmy for her role in “Shameless”. Sarah Silverman went on to appear in numerous films, TV series, and her own sitcom. She also hosted her own talk show, and voices Ollie on Bob’s Burgers.\n\n#11: The Groupies\n\nMichelle and Eleni may have been behind the scenes, but they were integral to the crew. After all, the band wouldn’t even have a name without them. Veronica Afflerbach, who played Eleni, took one more ride in the music movie genre with a role in “The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie”. She later moved to Oregon and launched a business selling handcrafted jewellery online. Jordan-Claire Green, who played Michelle, continued acting after “School of Rock” with small roles in film and TV. According to IMDb, her most recent credit was from 2018, but hopefully she’ll return to the screen soon.\n\n#10: The Security Guys\n\nFrankie and Leonard were another behind the scenes, yet essential, part of the crew. The Security Guys were responsible for sound proofing the classroom, monitoring security cameras, and generally making sure the band stayed safe and secret. Angelo Massagli, who played Frankie, aka Tough Guys, had a few more acting roles including a long running part on the Sopranos as Bobby Baccalieri Jr. He then became a law student at the University of Miami. Cole Hawkins, who played Leonard aka Shortstop, had a few small roles afterwards, even joining his Groupie co-star in “The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie”, but has not been acting since 2006.\n\n#9: The Roadies\n\nWe remember him as Marco, the fog machine operator during the epic battle of the bands performance. But you might also recognize James Hosey from his recurring role as Tyler on “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”, or his two episode spot on “Boardwalk Empire”. Unfortunately, he doesn’t seem to have anything new coming up on the horizon. Zachary Infante, or as we know him, the lights show wiz kid, Gordon, has also had several later screen roles, including in “Gotham”. He’s been focusing however on theatre, with roles in the Berkeley Rep production “Kiss My Aztec!”\n\n#8: Brian Falduto\n\nDewey Finn might have been the man that made the school rock, but Billy was the kid who made them fabulous. Ironically, though he wasn’t a part of the main band in the film, he later went on to release his own solo EP. He is now a life coach in his own company, Love Life. And he speaks openly about how being “the gay kid” in “School of Rock” ultimately helped him truly be himself. For now, “School of Rock” remains his only major screen role, but it certainly seems like he’s found his calling.\n\n#7: Maryam Hassan\n\nAll of the back up singers were fantastic, but we have to shine the spotlight on the shy but soulful Tomika. She blew all of us away when she piped up and joined Marta and Alicia as a backup singer. Since this role, Maryam Hassan has stepped out of the spotlight, and there isn’t much known about her life now. We’ll respect that privacy. As for her fellow singers, Caitlyn Hale, who played Marta, became a sonogram technician; Aleisha Allen, who played Alicia, took on a few more film roles, but now works in speech pathology. Thankfully, they all returned with the rest of the band to perform for the film’s 10 year anniversary.\n\n#6: Robert Tsai\n\nLike most of the young actors from this cast, Robert Tsai, who played Lawrence the keyboardist, also left acting after this film. “School of Rock” remains his only acting credit to date. However, his musical career didn’t stop there. He continued to play piano in concerts at Dartmouth College, and even worked on some musical productions during his time there. His only other time in front of a camera was as a part of the dance group Instant Noodle Crew. Though the probability of us catching a glimpse of him in another acting role is slim to none, he’ll always be Mr. Cool to us.\n\n#5: Rebecca Brown\n\nShe might not be acting anymore, but bass legend, Katie, or Posh Spice as Dewey refers to her, has not stopped performing. Since slapping the bass as one of the core members of the band, Brown is still commanding the stage. She now writes, plays, and sings her own songs, and has become a comedian in LA. Listening to her, we think she could have easily taken a shot at being one of the band’s backup singers, or challenged Zack for his spot as lead guitarist way back when.\n\n#4: Kevin Clark\n\nThough the entire young cast in this film was extremely talented, most of them did not make careers out of their musical or acting skills in adulthood. Kevin Clark is an exception. While he didn’t continue acting after “School of Rock”, he did stick with drumming for the long haul. The artist formerly known as Spazzy McGee became a professional drummer, performing for local artists in Chicago, and he now plays in the band Dreadwolf where he’s still busting guts with his killer drum solos.\n\n#3: Joey Gaydos Jr.\n\nZack Mooneyham went from being the sheepish guitarist to the shredding rockstar known as Zack Attack. Similar to Kevin Clark, Joey left acting, but he continued his music career and released his debut album in 2004. He followed that up by playing guitar with the band Stereo Jane. He loves guitars so much, in fact, that he’s been arrested for stealing them from different music establishments. He’s blamed the thefts on a drug addiction, and is hopefully sincere about wanting to turn over a new leaf.\n\n#2: Miranda Cosgrove\n\nOut of all of the young cast members, Cosgrove definitely has the most well known name. She went from playing the precocious Summer Hathoway to the scheming Megan Parker in the Nickelodeon show “Drake & Josh”. She then continued on in her own show “iCarly”, for which she became the highest paid child actress at the time. And though it’s a big joke in the film that Summer can’t sing, Miranda Cosgrove has two EPs and one studio album. She continues to act, in movies and TV, but hasn’t been in anything too high profile for a while. She now hosts a series called “Mission Unstoppable” which showcases impressive women in STEM careers.\n\n#1: Jack Black\n\nLike his fellow adult cast members, Jack Black already had a successful career before “School of Rock”, and things only moved up for him from there. He’s had starring roles in numerous movies across many different genres, including “King Kong”, “The Holiday”, and “Tropic Thunder”. And of course, there’s his reunion with Mike White, “Nacho Libre”. He also continued in musical comedy with his hilarious duo Tenacious D. In 2013, he led the “School of Rock” band once again for the movie’s ten year reunion party. More recently he’s starred in franchises like “Goosebumps” and the “Jumanji” sequels."
