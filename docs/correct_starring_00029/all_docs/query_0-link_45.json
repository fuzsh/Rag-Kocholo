        "text": "Birth Name: Anna Maria Francesca Enriquez Perez de Tagle\n\nDate of Birth: December 23rd, 1990\n\nHeight: 5’2″\n\nBorn in San Francisco California, Anna Maria developed her love for theater and began training in singing, dancing and acting.\n\nShe always loved performing in front of the camera and on stage, starring in regional productions of “Cinderella” “Bugsy Malone” and “The King and I.” She kept busy by modeling for several catalogs, including Macy’s and Mervyns and was a junior finalist for “Star Search” (1983). After begging her parents to let her audition, Anna Maria booked her 1st audition, winning a role on Disney’s hit “Hannah Montana” (2006), so her family packed up and moved to Hollywood. Anna Maria plays Ashley Dewitt, a ditsy fashionista who has no idea that her nemesis, Miley, is really her favorite performer, Hannah Montana.\n\nSince hitting Los Angeles, this beauty has graced the small screen numerous times with roles in CBS’s morning show “Cake” (2006) and “Just Jordan” (2007), as well as the voice of Martha, the Safety Patrol Kid in “Higglytown Heroes”.(2004).\n\nAnna Maria can be seen in Disney’s upcoming hit, Camp Rock (2008) (TV) starring as Ella, a lip-gloss obsessed mean girly girl who makes an unlikely transformation. This television feature is due out in June. A sequel Camp Rock: The Final Jam (TV) follows in 2010.\n\nHer big screen debut will be with “Fame” (2009), the reinvention of the 1980s smash hit “Fame” (1980), produced by Lakeshore Entertainment, released through MGM. Anna Maria plays Joy Moy – the aspiring/exuberant actress who’s outgoing/outspoken and never second guesses herself.\n\nAnna Maria lives in Los Angeles with her 2 brothers (King and Miguel Perez de Tagle). She enjoys working with the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, and on her free time, likes to design and make her own clothes, as well as snow ski, dance, sing, play the piano and read.\n\nTrivia:\n\nShe’s a Filipino, Irish, Spanish descent.\n\nGranddaughter of Filipina actress/singer, Sylvia La Torre."
