The actress married Scott Kline back in 2019 and in December 2020, announced that they would be having their first child, due in June 2021. It looks like Anna and Scott received their bundle of joy over the weekend, as the actress posted a silly video to TikTok of her in the hospital prior to giving birth, using the sound “I wanna go home!” and captioning the post with, “This was right before a contraction 😂 BABY GIRL IS OFFICIALLY HERE! 🤱🏻🥰 #birth #babygirl #mom #TalkToMe” Sending out a major congratulations to Anna, Scott and their baby girl!"
