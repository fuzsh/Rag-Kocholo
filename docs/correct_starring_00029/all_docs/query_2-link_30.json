        "text": "I got the inside scoop on what it was like filming and what life is like on tour, from the stars of The Disney Channel original movie Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam. The movie will premiere on Sept. 3rd, and you will see the Jonas Brothers and the rest of the gang head back to Camp Rock, and meet rival camp, Camp Star. The cast is currently on an international tour debuting songs from the Camp Rock 2 soundtrack, as well as Demi Lovato and The Jonas Brothers performing their chart-topping hits. The music, the dancing, and the story line will blow you away!\n\n\"We had two weeks of dance rehearsals before we got to go to location to film,\" says original Camp Rocker Anna Maria Perez de Tagle, \"we got a new choreographer, Rosero McCoy, who's worked with Beyonce, Michael and Janet Jackson, and he's awesome. He brought new styles to the movie, like stepping, break-dancing, flippers, trickers.\" The cast said it was unbearably cold when they were filming in Canada last fall.\n\n\"I had, like, heat packs in my bra,\" said Demi. We stuck them all over the place. It was freezing. It was so cold. It was very hard to focus, very hard to sing, very hard to perform. But you got to do what you got to do.\"\n\nCast members Alyson Stoner, Matthew \"Mdot\" Finley, Jordan Francis and Anna Maria Perez de Tagle are along the ride on this summers Jonas Brothers World Tour. \"I'm having so much fun performing in front of these type of fans. They knew the songs before they came out. The soundtrack came out, but they are still excited from just a preview and a commercial! It's been amazing,\" said new cast member Mdot (who plays Luke from Rival Camp, Camp Star).\n\n\"This tour requires a lot of energy,\" said Alyson. We've had a lot of doctor visits on this tour. It's really physically demanding. We're performing in 95 degree weather and 100% humidity, and it's a three-hour show every night. Our schedule's a bit hectic, but living on the bus is a new experience, completely foreign to me. You sleep at different increments, you don't just get a full night's rest. Every show is new, every crowd is new, and you never know what to expect.\"\n\nBeing pro's at touring, the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato have given their cast mates good advice, \"Just to stay healthy, make sure we take our vitamins, make sure we take power naps before we go on stage. We're conserving our energy for the audience. We want to give them 120% every time,\" said Jordan Francis.\n\n\"I think that having our friends out is always nice,\" Nick Jonas said about having the rest of the cast on tour with them. \"The road can be a bit of a lonely place, far away from your friends and family and all that. But not only do we have our family out now, but also our friends, which is cool.\"\n\nIf you don't have tickets to this concert, get them! You do not want to miss out on this show! I had the amazing opportunity to go on stage during The Jonas Brothers and Cast of Camp Rock's performance of \"Heart And Soul\" where they strapped a guitar on me, taught me a dance, and guided me around the stage to interact with the crowd, followed by a group picture with the cast and dancers! Mdot, Alyson, and Jordan lead the choreography and amazed the crowd with their skills, while The Jonas Brothers and Demi graced the crowds, playing some new and familiar hits."
