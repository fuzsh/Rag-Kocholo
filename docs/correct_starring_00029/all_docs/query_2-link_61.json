        "text": "MUMBAI: Disney Channel will start showcasing the exhilarating rock ‘n roll musical Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam from 15 October.\n\nThe film, that will be shown at 3 pm on the Navratri and Dussehra weekend, stars Demi Lovato and Jonas Brothers. Disney Channel‘s popular hosts - Tara and Murtuza - will be introducing all the fun in Camp Rock 2 The Final Jam with exclusive behind the scenes footage and cool trivia on the film.\n\nThe Hindi film soundtrack, featuring 15 songs spanning hip-hip, rock and pop/rock performed by the cast, has been composed by Sangeet and Siddharth Haldipur and sung by fresh new voices such as Apeksha Dandekar.\n\nThe sequel, choreographed by Rosero McCoy, is a tour de force for actress and recording artiste Demi Lovato. It showcases both the music and charm of Kevin, Joe and Nick Jonas and includes their younger brother Frankie Jonas in his TV film debut.\n\nThe highly anticipated sequel also brings back fan favourites from Camp Rock -- Maria Canals-Barrera, Meaghan Martin, Alyson Stoner, Anna Maria Perez de Tagle, Jasmine Richards, Daniel Fathers, Roshon Fegan and Jordan J Francis. The film introduces two exciting new performers, Matthew Mdot Finley and Chloe Bridges.\n\nThe sequel follows Mitchie and her friends as they return to Camp Rock for another great summer of music and fun. But when big-money, state-of-the-art Camp Star opens across the lake, it lures away many instructors and campers -- putting the future of Camp Rock in jeopardy. Mitchie emerges as a leader determined to save the camp and challenges the egocentric Luke Williams and his fellow Camp Star campers to a Final Jam -- an end-of-summer performance duel, may the best camp win.\n\nWritten by Dan Berendsen and the team of Karin Gist and Regina Hicks, the film is based on characters created by Karin Gist, Regina Hicks, Julie Brown and Paul Brown.\n\nDisney Channel is a 24-hour kid-driven, family inclusive television network that taps into the world of kids and families through original series and movies."
