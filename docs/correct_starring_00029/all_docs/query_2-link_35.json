        "text": "Iron Man, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and The Dark Knight have nothing on Camp Rock -- at least not with tweens.\n\nThe latest Disney Channel original movie seems primed to become the next High School Musical. Like that 2006 surprise hit, it's a high-energy musical with catchy songs, a destined-to-be-best-selling soundtrack and irresistible rising stars. Unlike High School Musical, it has the Jonas Brothers.\n\nSet at a summer camp for aspiring young artists, Camp Rock follows Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato), a talented-but-poor singer-songwriter who is ashamed to admit that her mother is the camp cook and lies to impress everyone. She meets Shane Gray (Joe Jonas), a moody pop star who has been banished by his band mates (Kevin and Nick Jonas) to their old camp to reclaim his love of music and his humility. Of course, Mitchie and Shane are destined to make beautiful music together.\n\nThe movie co-stars Alyson Stoner, Meaghan Jette Martin, Anna Maria Perez de Tagle and Jasmine Richards, among other familiar Disney Channel faces.\n\n\"It has a great message for kids,\" Kevin Jonas said. \"Be who you are.\"\n\n\"Don't try to be something you're not,\" added Joe Jonas, standing next to his brothers during a conversation at Walt Disney World, where the stars of Camp Rock and most of the Disney Channel's television shows recently gathered for the Disney Channel Games.\n\nMartin plays Tess Tyler, the spoiled, mean-spirited starlet who makes life difficult for Mitchie. The character is one of the nastiest yet in a Disney Channel movie, sort of the Cruella De Vil of Camp Rock.\n\n\"It was quite an honor,\" the 16-year-old actress said. \"Funny thing, they had to edit a lot of my scenes out because I was too mean by the final cut. So people are seeing the edited mean girl -- and she's still pretty mean.\"\n\nThe likely breakout star of Camp Rock is Lovato, the 15-year-old Texan who plays Mitchie. She spent almost two years singing and dancing on Barney & Friends (2000-02) -- on which she appeared alongside her best friend, Wizards of Waverly Place star Selena Gomez -- before appearing regularly on the Disney Channel short series As the Bell Rings.\n\n\"What happened was, I went to a Disney talent search,\" Lovato said. \"I have been working at this my entire life, basically, so to be able to get noticed at a talent search was a huge thing to me.\n\n\"(Disney executives) saw that I could sing and dance,\" she said, \"and from then on they kept auditioning me for things. Sometimes they didn't work out, but when I auditioned for Camp Rock I ended up making it to one of the final few.\n\n\"Then I booked it, and I screamed, I was so excited.\"\n\nLovato called Camp Rock \"a real learning experience\" -- no surprise, because it's not only her first film but also her debut as a leading lady.\n\n\"That took a little getting used to,\" she said. \"It's a lot of work, because you're in so many scenes. But it was fun. And it was great working with Joe. He's awesome.\n\n\"The director thought it was important that we get to know each other,\" Lovato added, \"because chemistry is the main thing when it comes to Disney romances. Knowing that (High School Musical stars Zak Efron and Vanessa Hudgens) had such great chemistry because, well, it was real -- everyone knows -- we knew we'd be up against that. So we did what we could, just being good friends.\n\n\"All three of the Jonas Brothers were great,\" she said. \"I was expecting something else from them. They're rock stars! I'd met them before, and I didn't think they'd remember me, and the first thing they did when I walked through the door was say, 'Demi, it's so good to see you. We can't believe we're getting to do this together.'\n\n\"I'd only met them once before, and I was, like, 'Oh, my gosh, I can't believe you remembered my name!' \"\n\nChances are that after Friday, no one younger than 16 will forget Lovato's name. In fact, there will be no escaping it. Lovato is on a solo tour, after which she'll join the Jonas Brothers on their summer tour.\n\nShe also stars with Gomez in Princess Protection Agency, a Disney Channel movie set to run in September, is readying an album for a November release and is soon to start shooting Welcome to Mollywood, a Disney Channel sitcom in which she'll play a 15-year-old Midwesterner who moves to Los Angeles to join the cast of her favorite teen sketch-comedy show.\n\nIt's all a little overwhelming, Lovato said, and she has taken note of the ways instant celebrity has affected recent Disney superstars such as Hudgens and Miley Cyrus.\n\n\"When I booked Camp Rock last year,\" she said, \"I was like, 'OK, my life is going to change, but I'm going to be prepared.' \""
