        "text": "In a press note issued earlier in the day, the Raj Niwas officials said Saxena had approved an increase in the Adhoc Monthly Relief to Kashmiri migrants in the national capital from Rs 10,000 to Rs 27,000 per month.\n\nIn the evening, an official said, “This enhancement in eligibility will increase the number of beneficiaries being covered by about 70 per cent. Now, beneficiaries earning up to Rs 27,000 per month rather than the previous amount of Rs 10,000 per month will be eligible for AMR.”\n\nThis enhancement comes after a long gap of 16 years. The eligibility for AMR was doubled last in 2007 from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 per month.\n\nIn 1995, the Delhi government had fixed the eligibility for AMR amount at Rs 5,000 per month."
