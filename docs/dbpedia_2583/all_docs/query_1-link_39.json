        "text": "It’s time for a nation to go into complete denial. Denial of the fact that we are a people with displaced priorities: literacy, progress, tolerance, humanity are just some of the lynchpins sacrificed to uphold an artificial façade of moral supremacy.\n\nShoaib Mansoor tackles all this and more in a film that hopes to push the Pakistani society at large into accepting that these issues prevail amongst us. One can only hope that this push will snowball into a movement against elements driving us towards self-destruction.\n\nBol is a riveting story, narrated in quintessential Shoaib Mansoor style, which means it is as close to real life as possible. This also makes it twice as disturbing. But it is the antithesis of mindless, meaningless Indian comedies that our cinemas are flooded with these days, which is refreshing.\n\nMansoor’s cinema style still borders on tele-film/docu-drama, which could be blamed on the cast originating from television as well as the director/writer’s experience being imbedded in the smaller screen.\n\nThe film is by no means flawless. Technical weaknesses in light and sound apart, even the storyline cracks when Atif Aslam’s Mustafa — an otherwise educated and aware young man — leaves the underage, effeminate and vulnerable Saifu (played brilliantly by young Amr Kashmiri) at the local truck adda to paint motifs on the inter-state vehicles driven by gruff-looking men. Saifu’s inevitable molestation is predictable to everyone except for Mustafa himself, and he fails to see through the lecherous smiles of the truck drivers.\n\nPlaying in cinemas for over a week now, Bol is blowing people both hot and cold. Most people are hailing it for being a bold mirror to Pakistan’s social problems — issue-based films are rapidly becoming the director’s genre as a film-maker — while others are condemning it for being an unnecessarily heavy dose of oppressive cinema.\n\nOne feels that while it is necessary to take off the rose-tinted shades of Pakistan’s La La Land known as Lollywood, it is equally important for a playwright like Shoaib Mansoor to script a film that is light-hearted and entertaining. Fifty Fifty and Ankahi bear witness to the fact that the playwright can work his comedies just as effectively as his tragedies. It would be a dream if he could make his films sooner instead of spacing them out so far, and if he could pick a lighter theme next time instead of the heavily-nuanced and serious cinema that he is becoming famous for. God knows that the people of this country need entertainment just as much as they need a reality check."
