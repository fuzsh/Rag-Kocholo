        "text": "Srinagar: National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah has said that the Modi government is involved in financial mismanagement in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, adding it is leaving a legacy of “back-breaking debt” for the elected government, whenever it assumed power.\n\nAccording to Kashmir Media Service, Omar Abdullah made the remark in a post on X while reacting to reports that the territory is facing mounting financial pressure as its total liabilities have swelled to Rs 1,12,797 crore (Rs 1.12 lakh crore) in the 2022-23 fiscal year.\n\nHe said in the 10 years, occupied Jammu and Kashmir has received crippling debt. The powers that be love talking about a ‘naya Kashmir’ but what they forget to tell everyone is that the only legacy they are leaving for the elected government, when it comes, is one of back-backing interest payments and a financial crisis, he maintained.\n\nAccording to recent budget figures, Jammu and Kashmir’s liabilities had more than tripled from Rs 29,972 crore in 2010-11 in 10 years."
