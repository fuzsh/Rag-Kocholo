        "text": "New Delhi, Oct 18: The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, VK Saxena, has given his official approval for an enhancement in the Adhoc Monthly Relief (AMR) provided to Kashmiri migrants residing in the national capital.\n\nThe relief amount has been increased from Rs 10,000 per month to Rs 27,000 per month.\n\nThis move marks the first substantial increase in the AMR in over 15 years, with the last update dating back to 2007 when the amount was doubled from the initially fixed Rs 5,000 per family, which was set in 1995.\n\nThe AMR serves as crucial support to Kashmiri migrants and is provided under the Central Government's Security Related Expenditure (Relief and Rehabilitation) Scheme.\n\nThis program aims to contribute to the relief and rehabilitation efforts of families affected by militancy.\n\nUnder the updated guidelines, it will be mandatory to seed Aadhar details for all family members eligible for AMR.\n\nAdditionally, relief payments to the migrants will be exclusively processed through the Aadhar Payment Bridge System (APBS) and the Public Financial Management System (PFMS).\n\nCurrently, the AMR is being disbursed to around 2,000 families in the national capital. This number is expected to grow by nearly 70 per cent as more “units” are factored in, reflecting the increase in the number of family members.\n\nThe initiative serves as a testament to the government's commitment to supporting and aiding Kashmiri migrants residing in Delhi during their times of need.\n\nP1, 2 col top\n\nCabinet approves 4 pc hike in DA for Central Govt employees\n\nNew Delhi, Oct 18: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a four per cent increase in Dearness Allowance (DA) for Central government employees and Dearness Relief for pensioners.\n\nBriefing reporters about the decisions of the union cabinet, Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said the decision will be implemented from July 1 this year.\n\n“Dearness Allowance for Central government employees and Dearness Relief for pensioners has been increased by 4 per cent. The DA hike will be implemented from 1, July 2023,” he said.\n\nThe decision will benefit 48.67 lakh Central Government Employees and 67.95 lakh pensioners.\n\nThe minister said the decision has come in the festival season and will benefit both the central government employees and pensioners."
