        "meta_description": "Geoffrey Firmin, a former British consul, has come to Quauhnahuac, Mexico. Here the consul's debilitating malaise is drinking, an activity that has overshadowed his life. Under the Volcano is set during the most fateful day of the consul's life—the Day of the Dead, 1938. His wife, Yvonne, arrives in Quauhnahuac to rescue him and their failing marriage, inspired by a vision of life together away from Mexico and the circumstances that have driven their relationship to the brink of collapse. Yvonne's mission is to save the consul is further complicated by the presence of Hugh, the consul's half-brother, and Jacques, a childhood friend. The events of this one day unfold against a backdrop unforgettable for its evocation of a Mexico at once magical and diabolical.\r\n—Goodreads.",

        "text": "Book Details\n\nAuthor Bio for Lowry, Malcolm\n\nMalcolm Lowry (1909-1957) was an English poet and novelist. Born in England, his early life was marred by depression and alcoholism. He paid scant attention to his education but found more satisfaction in writing. He published his first novel Ultramarine in 1933. In 1940, he married actress Margerie Bonner and they relocated to British Columbia where he enjoyed a happy life. He wrote his second novel Under the Volcano in 1948 which some consider one of the finest novels of the 20th century. He won the Governor General’s Award for English language fiction in 1961 for his posthumous collection Hear Us O Lord from Heaven Thy Dwelling Place. He died at age 48, his life cut short by a return to substance abuse.
