        "text": "Indian-administered Kashmir is witnessing some of its most violent protests.\n\nMore than 30 people have been killed and hundreds more injured in clashes with security forces in the past week following the killing of popular rebel leader Burhan Wani, 22.\n\nAfter Wani’s death, young people, who constitute the largest chunk of Kashmir’s population, have taken to throwing stones in protest on the streets and using social media to tell their stories.\n\nDemonstrations continue despite heavy a security presence and a shutdown of mobile Internet and phone services.\n\nAl Jazeera went to the streets of Srinagar, the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, to meet some of those involved.\n\nWe are forced to hurl stones at them. They incite us. I will continue to throw stones at them until they stop inflicting such atrocities on us.\n\nThe youth is really frustrated. Today, if I am with someone, I don’t even know if that person will be alive or be martyred tomorrow at the hands of the security forces. Why do they fire at us? Elsewhere in the country, protesters are dispersed with water cannons. Why are bullets and pellets used in Kashmir?\n\nIn the past few days, lots of boys have lost their eyes because the security forces are using pellets on them. Hundreds are in the hospital with serious injuries.\n\nThat is why I say we are forced to hurl stones at security forces.\n\nI am doing a story on people injured in clashes with the security forces. But it’s been hard to go the hospitals with the prevailing situation. I have had to do a lot of my interviews over the phone, and I am filing my stories on text message. There is no other way to do things right now.\n\nPeople’s core issues are not being resolved.\n\nWe’re always waiting for an opportunity to participate in a debate about Kashmir, but we don’t get to debate in more peaceful times, which is the basic reason this is happening. Because you [Indian officials] don’t address the core issues at the time you are supposed to.\n\nSuccessive governments have failed in their attempts to engage the youth. Maybe they don’t give a damn about what happens to the common person. They debate the problems of the stone throwers, only when there is agitation.\n\nWhat we are seeing in Kashmir now isn’t anger … It would be wrong to call it anger. We are fighting a political war. This is people’s aspiration to a right of self-determination. And it gets manifested from time to time.\n\nWhen the armed struggle for self-determination was dipping, Burhan Wani came as a new hope. In him, our generation had a new armed guerilla icon. Our movement has entered a new phase. Support for an armed struggle has grown. The youth is getting attracted to guns again.\n\nIt is that gaze that just follows you around. Passing lewd remarks, catcalling … It has happened to almost every one of us.\n\nPeople say: “What is the difference? Haven’t you ever been molested or assaulted by a civilian?” Yes, but the thing is, you know – a soldier has a gun.\n\nBurhan challenged the whole narrative of a Pakistan-sponsored insurgency, because he was a Kashmiri, he never crossed the border, he picked up arms here and he never went for training to Pakistan.\n\nEveryone thought of him as a son. When he was killed, that really angered everyone, young and old.\n\nThe dignity of the youth has been crushed by state institutions and police brutalities. Their demands, whether political, economic, educational or cultural, have been sidelined.\n\nThere is no mechanism to redress the issues of the youth by the state or its institutions.\n\nSo they have taken to guns to fight the state for their right to self-determination. As pacifists, we are trying to teach our youth that they can address these issues through peaceful means.\n\nWe are using social media to generate awareness about the Kashmir conflict because it’s one of the forgotten conflicts in the world."
