        "text": "Written By Danish zaidi\n\nAmr Kashmiri,the Actor who played Saifee (older) in the Movie \"BOL\"has been garnering quite a good response from fans.The actor revealed some of the good moments from the movie \"BOL\" and also talked about Atif aslam.\n\nHere are the Exact words of him!\n\n\"Atif is a very nice person.I think keeping his role in mind and the margin he was given to act ,he did great.He is a great friend and we had an awesome time shooting together.The best thing i liked about him was that he had self control and was ethically very strong.I mean he just take so much care of his throat,he won't smoke,drink chilled coke,no sapari nothing at all and i was surprised to know that he never missed his prayers.Apart from that Atif always kept everyone smiling with his spontaneous jokes and remarks.A great person and after receiving so much he still doesn't think himself a hero.Thats the greatest achievement! \"\n\n{Via Sana Kazim}"
