        "text": "Solomon\n\nfor three nights now Israel says it entered Gaza. it is still out side Gaza city. the fighting is going on out side cities .not that Israel is unable to enter but the loses will be big..Israel is going to lose hundreds of dead and wounded they will never defeat Hamas as a resistance force..\n\nNona\n\nHow sad that the cowardly Islamic extremist Hamas is so hell-bent on destroying Israel and killing Israelis that it enthusiastically and consciously chose to turn Gaza into a war zone.\n\nHamas values the photo opps they can leverage with dead Palestinian children more than it values the peace and security of living Palestinian children. No bomb shelters. No effort to protect them. Using them as human shields. What unconscionable madness.\n\nA few days ago some pro-Hamas pro-terrorism bloggers were whining, \"Why doesn't Israel come into Gaza City?\" Well, you got what you wished for.\n\nWord to the wise: Be careful what you wish for.\n\ncubfan\n\nThe news just keeps getting better and better from Gaza. Two word for Ki-moon Fool at the UN, Shut Up. Israel is kicking the crap out of Hamas and things could not be going better for the IDF on their assault on Gaza.\n\nI cannot wait to get updates from the front, the reports are foreshadowing an complete and total defeat for Hamas.\n\nHearing tanks rolling thru Gaza city is like hearing the Cubs just hit back to back homeruns in the bottom of the ninth to win the game. Awesome news CNN, keep it coming. Prediction for today in Gaza, Hamas surrenders Gaza city.\n\nrusty\n\nSolomon, I would say that Hamas has already lost hundreds of dead and wounded, and they will never achieve their goal of wiping out Israel. They are a terrorist organization, willing to put their own people through incredible pain and suffering, so they can pick their tragic fights with Israel. Instead of providing goods and services for their people, who live in abject poverty, they would rather dig tunnels, and smuggle weapons. It is a sad thing, for all the innocents, Palestinians, and Jews. Peaceful co-existence would reap so many more rewards. They should give it a chance, just once. Let their children grow up healthy, and strong, and educated, instead of putting suicide bomb vests on them.\n\nLinda\n\nHey Guys, glad to see all of you\n\nGLeigh\n\nHi Linda. Looked for you earlier. I was in the midst of some really nasty folks. You can see it bothered me.\n\nGLeigh\n\nHi Solomon. Tell your buddies that I did not appreciate them today.\n\nLinda\n\nWell said Rusty!\n\nFriends, we have another educated person here that is for peace! Welcome Rusty ;)\n\nSolomon\n\nrusty.\n\n.Hamas is a liberation movement Israel is the terrorist state.\n\nIsrael is a colonial power that must be defeated maybe not now maybe not in the next few yearss but it will not last Sixty years is not considered history for any society the White ruled south Africa for three hundred years where are they now?\n\nGLeigh\n\nThanks for advising me to leave Nona. It was really was useless, trying to reason and make peace. Fool that I am.\n\nLinda\n\nGLeigh-\n\nI had to have my Chemo, so I have not been on much for the last couple of days, until tonight. I was on last night, but felt pretty bad. Don't let them get to you\n\nSolomon\n\nGLeigh\n\n.what happened? I am sorry but I read a comment from you that is not smart.\n\nGLeigh\n\nSolomon – Oh well. You said I was dumb. I'm a fifty year old woman who threw out her back. Curse and threaten me. It's not smart on your part either, by the way. Take that as you will.\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – I'm sorry. My relatives tend to go there. Hereditary maybe. I plan to stay around awhile. I hope that you do also. Funny how people from everywhere are so alike.\n\nLinda\n\nNona,\n\nI've decided not to take a stand tonight, nor state facts, it always gets me into trouble;)\n\nGLeigh\n\nDo you ever get tired of the war Solomon? I would. Seems like we should be supporting each other. In ways, you remind me of the hubby. Detailed. Too bad you only want to destroy Israel. I have some very nice friends.\n\nSolomon\n\nGLeigh\n\n. fifty years? you are still young.\n\nwell I did not think that it was smart from you to say that Israeli Defeated forces are in Gaza to save lives.\n\nthat is why I said it was the must stupid comment I read so far.\n\nGLeigh\n\nI hope you feel better Linda. I hope you beat it. If not, the other side is pretty awesome. I lost a lot of blood once. A great deal in fact according to my doc – a man doesn't have that much in his body but pregnant women have more. Trust me. I wanted to stay. Perhaps I want to go back though I was told no. Bummer. I did fuss. I'm perhaps not the easiest person to get along with. I'm pretty demanding. I hope you get well. We'll all pray for it anyway.\n\nSolomon\n\nGLeigh.\n\nyou are wrong Israel want to destroy the Palestinians I support the Palestinians. just like you support Israel what is wrong with that?\n\nGLeigh\n\nNothing at all except you don't want peace. You want to destroy Israel. You've made that clear. Your friends are nasty. Yuk.\n\nLinda\n\nSolomon,\n\nGoing into gaza, fighting head to head, instead of carpet bombing them would save lives.\n\nLinda\n\nGLeigh,\n\nI'll be fine, this is just one of those things that I have to go through in my life. Thank you for your kind words.\n\nDon't worry what some mean people say, it comes down to respect. See, it says nothing about you, they have no respect for anyone else, nor themselves.\n\nGLeigh\n\nThat Mahammed or Muhammed person, sorry forgot his spelling, really irritated me. I'm thinking closely about that. Linda – you'll get better. Be patient. It will take awhile. Wish I could have told my dad the same. Not everything turns out good I guess. Take care.\n\ncubfan\n\nPoor Solomon my little Arab terrorist buddy\n\nYour team sucks, and will quit on you. Why do you root for Hamas, their coaches hide in Damascus and let the players die for nothing. God is clearly an IDF fan and enjoys a good old fashion butt kicking. Hamas is finished and will not make the Super Bowl, it is not too late to root for the winning team. Solomon many of your Arab brothers have seen the light and are cheering for the IDF.\n\nArabs hate losers and all Hamas has on their team is losers. GOOOO IDF!!!!\n\nHunk\n\nIsrael is digging its own grave by killing this much of children and women s !! is it something brave .... its the absolute cowardly act of terror... if cowardly acts is not killing children s, then what is cowardly .... its an Army of thugs, they will never enter Gaza and their objectives will never be achieved.\n\n'Stray mortar' hit UN Gaza school\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7823204.stm\n\nIs this not cowardly ...\n\nGLeigh\n\nSadly it's true. We only hurt ones we care about. Ask a person in Iceland. They could care less about any of this. I envy them. The U.S. does care. So we can bombed. Bummer. This will continue on and on Solomon. No doubts. Get the guns ready. Fun time for your grandchildren. Sadly. I wish there would be peace but the world is not that into it. Outside monitors are the only hope. They won't do it.\n\nGLeigh\n\nThanks for your enlightening words Hunk. Always a pleasure.\n\nLinda – I would pour you some tea, I have some now, if you were here. Take care.\n\nGLeigh\n\nCubbie fan – there are no winners. I'm a Cubbie fan myself.\n\nLinda\n\nGleigh-\n\nAre you leaving? No, don't Please stay! :)\n\nGLeigh\n\nNo I'm not leaving. Not sure why. It's silly, but I just can't give up. I keep hoping for divine intervention I guess. For you and them.\n\nSolomon\n\ncubfan.\n\ngone are the days when Israel with American weapons finish a war in few days. few thousand fighters held Israel for 18 days probably for months if Israel can hold that long.\n\nis that not an indication that Israel is living on borrowed time if it continue its slide in to hell.\n\nas for the Arab brothers watch and see Mubarak having the same fate as the Traitor Sadat the Egyptians will not let this traitor die a normal death.\n\nLinda\n\nDon't worry about me, I am fine. I will get through this, like everything else.\n\nI keep hoping that people will want peace, more than they want to kill someone else, but I'm not sure that is going to happen. I am starting to think that the world is a lot worse off than I thought.\n\nHunk\n\nGaza clinic destroyed in strike\n\nThe charity Christian Aid says a clinic for mothers and babies in Gaza, which it funds along with the EU, has been destroyed in an Israeli air strike.\n\nRead full story,\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7825215.stm\n\nIt seems that Israel is sacred from the demographic factor, that Gazan shouldn't make love and have babies.\n\nSolomon\n\nIsrael may face UN court ruling on legality of Gaza conflict\n\n* Afua Hirsch, legal affairs correspondent\n\n* The Guardian, Wednesday 14 January 2009\n\nIsrael faces the prospect of intervention by international courts amid growing calls that its actions in Gaza are a violation of world humanitarian and criminal law.\n\nThe UN general assembly, which is meeting this week to discuss the issue, will consider requesting an advisory opinion from the international court of justice, the Guardian has learned.\n\n\"There is a well-grounded view that both the initial attacks on Gaza and the tactics being used by Israel are serious violations of the UN charter, the Geneva conventions, international law and international humanitarian law,\" said Richard Falk, the UN's special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories and professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/14/israel-gaza-un-court-palestine\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – More than once I have sat and read this blog and stared at my computer with tears in my eyes. Not because one is right and the other wrong or one mean and the other nice. Mankind in general seems so cruel to me. I wanted peace for the people of Gaza along time ago. That's not the main argument. It's all about winning, not people.\n\nGLeigh\n\nMy husband thinks I'm nuts no doubt. He tells me to go soak in the hot tub or go out or whatever. I have to care though.\n\nLinda\n\nGLeigh-\n\nI know me too, and I don't see why anyone wants to be so hateful. And I don't understand why some people will not even try to see anything from another point of view. Hate seems to overide human decency.\n\nGLeigh\n\nPropaganda Hunk. We are not the people to spout it too. Go somewhere with younger people.\n\nLinda\n\nI wish people would have a conversation, instead of Cut, Copy, Paste, and post random articles.\n\nOh yea, that's not their agenda!\n\nGLeigh\n\nI think the name Hunk was suppose to sway us. Like right.\n\nLinda\n\nNews Update!\n\nDan has finally snapped!\n\nSolomon\n\nGLeigh.\n\nit is not propaganda by Hunk. Israel did bomb the Christian charity you can go and find out there is a link.\n\nwhat would you say about that?\n\nGLeigh\n\ndon't forget the videos offered. Those always amaze me. Like fifty million people on the WWW don't have something to offer. Each with an opinion.\n\nLinda\n\nWho do some men on here care what us women say anyway? They think we are second class citizens with no rights.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nGreetings Folks,\n\nOnly hear very briefly.\n\nIt was a real war zone in here the last 2 days.\n\nAnd margins were all messed up!\n\nSolomon\n\nLinda.\n\npoor dan that is why I call him ant brain.\n\ncubfan\n\nSolomon\n\nYour anger and disillusionment should be directed at the Hamas leadership and Iran. Come on Gaza city is being taken by the IDF and the Hamas leadership hides like cowards in Damascus. If it were the other way around I would have already been in Tel Aviv fighting till the end. The leadership of Hamas is a Joke. Where is Iran? Iran and its reinforcements are nowhere to be found. The Palestinians need to realize they have no friends other than the good people of Israel. Gaza has been exploited by the terrorist and the people need to rise up and throw them out.\n\nHunk\n\nDenial under whatever reason , propaganda, collateral damage.\n\nThe Arab world is made of over 40% under 22 but i am not 22 years old.\n\nSolomon\n\nLinda.\n\nwho think that you are second class citizen?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nHi wheel chair #1!\n\nGLeigh\n\nSolomon – Ant brain is original. Woulda never thought of it. Congrats. You call me stupid. Where does stupid rate on the scale of ant brain?\n\nGLeigh\n\nI must be getting tired. All of this is starting to getting ridiculous and funny to me. It's always ridiculous, but not funny till I'm pooped. It really is serious stuff to the people in Gaza. Peace.\n\nSolomon\n\ncubfan..\n\nthe people of Gaza will for sure rise up and you will see it soon when your defeated army leave Gaza in disgrace.\n\nLinda\n\nAJ,\n\nGreat to see you.\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – I was on earlier today. Left to do house work then came back to see if you were here, or Nona or Nick. Someone, maybe \"professor\" said I had been lurking around the whole time. I know that no ones sees me, but I gasped. I've never been a lurker my whole life. This is very odd to me. How are you feeling? Sick?\n\nLinda\n\nSolomon,\n\nsome men that are in here and try to put women like GLeigh and I down. Call us names, and try to bully us. So I don't know why they would even bother reading what we blog, that is how they see us.\n\nLinda\n\nI guess I'm a luker too, since I read the posts before I say hi!\n\nI'm okay, a little sick, a lot tired. my skin hurts. I think I can make a little while longer tho. Thanks for asking'\n\nHow is your back\n\nGLeigh\n\nI need a thicker skin maybe to blog. Or maybe mine is too thick is the problem. I'm not easily intimidated.\n\nLinda\n\nOMG, DAn!\n\nSolomon\n\nLinda.\n\nbe nice to them they will be nice to you.\n\nLinda\n\nI am laughing so hard that I am crying. Stop it, DAN :)\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nAre you kidding me, Dan?\n\nJS\n\nIf the citizens of Gaza want the war to stop then they should stop supporting Hamas and stand up and take back their leadership. Hamas was elected and the Gaza citizens didn't complain when rockets were being fired into Israel they are only crying because now Israel is firing back. The Palestinians can't have it both ways where they actively support the destruction of Israel and want protection from the big bad wolf.\n\nHow many missles fired from a foreign country would the US tolerate before its citizens where up in arms and wanted to respond by military force?\n\nLinda\n\nSolomon,\n\nI try to be nice and respectful, only if you were right. Someone the other night, that I had never seen before, got and and called me the most vile names. Now, why would someone do that. They did not have a conversation, they just logged on and started calling names. Crazy\n\nSolomon\n\nant brain.\n\nyou are still OK you did not miss any Zero.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nIt's blog wars here, Gleigh\n\nLinda\n\nAJ\n\nDan lost is a couple of hours ago. Go look on the other blog, one down from here.\n\nGLeigh\n\nWell Linda – I hope you pull through and learn something, whatever you have to learn, from it. If not, I hope you find your way to the next place peacefully. I did that once. Not expecting it. It's way kewl. Dan? No way.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nLinda, anger comes out in all sorts of ways\n\nGLeigh\n\nlol American Jew – guess so. Sharpen the fingernails.\n\nLinda\n\nGLeigh,\n\nI've almost gone there twice. I'm in no hurry, I have more love, peace and joy to spread here first. I promise, don't worry, I will be okay :)\n\nSolomon\n\nLinda.\n\nhow do you know that they are not right? you might be the one that is wrong.\n\nLinda\n\nhaha, Gleigh :)\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – my back is better. I did lean over this morning to water the dogs and saw stars so counted to five. Managed to drive my son and his friend to school. They are best buds and always ride with me. Can't complain. Wouldn't do any good anyway. I vacuumed in five minute increments.\n\ndan perman\n\nAJ\n\nyour a pro israel nazi!\n\ngo to youtube! look what israel is doing in gaza! it is a massacre!\n\nwhy do you support such a masacre?\n\nwe, all pro israel idiots will go to hell :(\n\ni feel endless pain about all the lies about all the propaganda, about me self!\n\ni thoght israel is doing the right thing, but now i saw the suffering children, the pain which we did support!\n\nit is hell! i have such nazi methods as israel is using! i hate my self! i was a fascist :(\n\nSolomon\n\nit looks like Hamas visited ant brain he is terrified he will get out of it.\n\nGLeigh\n\nsounds like Akiva.\n\nLinda\n\nSolomon,\n\nI meant, if only you were right that they would be nice to me If I were to them.\n\nThey are probably right about some things, and I always concede that, so why should I be called vile names. No one said I am always right, but I do have opinions, just like everyone else, and I never call vile names, or try to pound someone into the ground. I agree to disagree.\n\nLinda\n\nAkiva possesed Dan.\n\ndan perman\n\ni was a nazi jew!\n\ngod please help me!\n\ni pray to you! god please stop this massacre! please help! watch the poor, suffering people in gaza! please stop this massacre!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nOh, I see.\n\nDan, I think is using reverse psychology here.\n\nOK. Got it.\n\n:)\n\nGLeigh\n\nSolomon only wants Israel wiped out and Israel's (or whoever's) land. He feels Israel is illegal. There is no peace. Not till they are gone. Hopefully someone else will step in because Israel isn't going to go like the hundreds of thousands of Darfur with quiet extermination. Am I wrong Solomon?\n\nLinda\n\nAJ,\n\nHow are you tonight?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nLinda,\n\nIt's a mean crowd during the day. I prefer the night owls.\n\nMore respectful bunch\n\nGLeigh\n\nDidn't Akiva once claim to be a Jew? At some point? I nearly busted a gut over that one. Told her/him that she wasn't. It has to be Akiva. Where is the gay Israel Jew thing though?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nI actually did other things the last 2 days. Good to get awy from the poisonous blog wars for a bit.\n\nSolomon\n\nGLeigh.\n\nare you a Christian?\n\nLinda\n\nso true, AJ\n\nI wish nona and nick would come back now!\n\nGLeigh\n\nAmerican Jew – tell me. I came on here during the daytime. Wowww!\n\nGLeigh\n\nSolomon – I am a Christian who doesn't agree sometimes with stuff. Awkward. I don't really fit in to any one thing. I've seen some odd stuff.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nI hope Lynn and Professor and Rod show up\n\nI noticed that Prof was doing a lot of name calling today, tho tsk tsk\n\ndan perman\n\ni am so clever i am so smart!\n\nAkiva is a dumb but told me allways the truth!\n\ni will follow now to Akiva blindly! you nazis did lie at me stright face\n\nplease help me tell me about my own history send me a email, theach me right! dperman [at] lwsd [dot] org or dperman [at] canby [dot] com\n\ntell me, teach me the truth about israel and the jews!\n\nand Linda please send m your pic's, i am in love to you! marry me, i am a clever guy, a smart pro israel nazi, i am very well educated\n\nlet us have a child together. be my friend my wife, i need you!\n\nGLeigh\n\nNative American is good. Too bad we wiped them out, almost. Some are pretty helpful.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nDont worry Gleigh, I don't fit in either!\n\nLinda\n\nDan,\n\nWe are going to start ignoring you like we do Akiva it you don't stop.\n\nAlthough, you are funny as hell :)\n\nGLeigh\n\nPlease don't post web sites or videos for me to watch. I think on my own. Now THAT is scary. haha!\n\nLinda\n\nHey, I'm 1/4 Native american (blackfoot) and no, before you ask, my feet aren't black. How can I be of help:)\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nYeah, I think Dan here is really Akiva\n\n:)\n\nVery funny Akiva...I mean Dan\n\n;)\n\nSolomon\n\nGLeigh.\n\n.you keep talking about Darfur which is not an Ideal place.\n\nbut you never talk about Rowanda where a million Christians were killed by Christians.\n\nLinda\n\nSorry Dan,\n\nI can no longer have children, nor do I want them. I just got my son raised. And I am already married, so what can you offer me that is better? I await your response!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nweb sites and videos are part of 'thinking on your own', GL, no? As long as you look at all POVs, yes?\n\nGLeigh\n\nSolomon – we all stink. None of us are great. I agree. So killing some more people, perhaps for generations is the way to go? You asked my religion. What is yours? Are you in Gaza? You sound hardcore Palestinian. That's not personal. I'm just basically nosy.\n\ndan perman\n\nLinda\n\ni kiss your liar feet, i am in love!\n\nGLeight let us do a theesome with Linda, i am gay i love it!\n\nSend me your pic at dperman [at] voyager [dot] net i am a clever guy i am smart i was a pro israel nazi, but now it is over! now i change my mind, Professor teach me more about the jews and israel, i am in germany i know nothing about my own history, please help me\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – I admire the wisdom of the old teachers, the old religions. I took Native American Lit. In it they said that pinning up animals would make people sick from their spirits. Then I went to Microbiology. My teacher, who wrote the text book, said almost all viruses from Europe, at least, could be traced back to pinning up animals. Which is why Native Americans were not resistant to the viruses. They knew.\n\nGLeigh\n\nthe \"pro israel nazi\" is definitely Akiva. She's said it a lot.\n\nLinda\n\nVery interesting, Gleigh.\n\nthere is so much to Native American teaching that is really facinating. I feel lucky that I grew up with my Native American Grandfather. Sometimes people, or cultures just know.\n\ndan perman\n\nAkiva\n\nyou a dumb idiot! but you did never lie at me, i am smart and well educated i was a pro israel nazi but now i change my mind! i hate fascism i hate genocide! God please safe me, safe my sould! god please stop the killers in gaza! stop the terror by israel!\n\ni am a smart gay, i am a clever gay listen to me, please god i need your help! gaza needs your help!\n\nSolomon\n\nGLeigh.\n\nI am not a Palestinian .I am Lebanese and I am a Muslim my mother was a Christian. Israel killed my Nephew and a cousin of mine in 1982. they were in our orchard picking grapes when the cowards shoot them.I will fight Israel as long as i am alive.\n\ndan perman\n\ni am moss\n\ni am dan\n\ni am JJdT\n\ni am clever i am smart!\n\nLinda\n\nSolomon,\n\nMy heart breaks because of your last comment. I am sorry for your nephew and cousin. How tradgic. But Israel did not kill them. Horrible cowards did. Thoses cowards are not an entire nation\n\nGLeigh\n\nSolomon – I might feel the same if I were you. I'm sorry for your losses. I hope no one else looses relatives, Muslim or not. I don't want to loose any of my family either. I hope that makes sense, in some way, to you.\n\nDavid Fream\n\nI suggest the the Palestinians will just be happy on what they have. Since when you look at the world map the occupy a lot not just GAZA. Israel is like a dot from the map why cant they just be contented on what they have. By the way also the warnings was given in advance by the Israelis. If i am a Palestinian I should go away sleep out far from the bombing put up a tent or something.\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – I think the Native Americans knew much more than we realize. Europeans just don't know how to read their writings. I was amazed in my class. It made sense to me but others laughed or had blank looks. It requires seeing outside the box. You're lucky.\n\nGLeigh\n\nSolomon – At some point, it's time to let go of hate. It hurts you more than those you hate. It can take over life. That's not easy, but true.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nSolomon,\n\nMy condolonces...\n\nLinda\n\nI went to some Mayan Ruins in sept. and it was wonderful. This may sound crazy, but i felt as if I could feel everyone of their spirits. I am one of those people that just knows things. I don't know why, but it has always been a part of my all. and yes, it requires seeing outside of the box, I think I live outside the box.\n\nGLeigh\n\nThere are such mean, violent people in the world. You shoulda heard this person Mahammed or Muhammed today. Wow.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nGL,\n\nEasier said than done\n\nLinda\n\nLaughing Histerically, What the hell is a death frog?\n\nAkiva\n\nOK dumb Akiva i will do every thing!\n\ni am your blind follower your slave!\n\ni will be quiet now! because i am smart and clever! i will stop with all my lies and propaganda, i am your slave and i am in love with linda and GLeigh.\n\ni am the most intelectual gay here and now i listen to you i follow you i am your slave, dumb akiva, i am clever enough to fillow you blindly!\n\nGLeigh\n\nAmerican Jew- I know. I'm an optimist. Once a Lit teacher said that with U.S. slavery, it was really the slave owner who was hurt the most. His wife, his kids, his soul. That makes me think. No answers, but makes me think. It was all terrible. For everyone I guess.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nWhoops, Akiva, you just gave yourself away! LOL\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – death frog? Where was that posted?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nDan will be really p.o.'d when he sees what you have done...\n\nAnd while you are at it, could you tone down the 4 letter words, please?\n\ndanke schon\n\nGLeigh\n\nI have to be pooped.

Finally found it. Not sure what one is. But you do remind me of one. Bulgy like eyes. Have fly tea with me Linda?\n\nGLeigh\n\nI need a minute.\n\nDavid Fream\n\nLook solomon I understand the rage and agony that your family has been through. We say things because we are angry. I'm sorry for your loss. Sometimes anger is not the solution to all our problems. Things like these happen for a cause. Just think about it at least the struggles that they have been through is over they will hide no more they are free. Just keep praying!\n\nLinda\n\nTea it is!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nSolomon,\n\nAre you still there?\n\nSolomon\n\nSolomon – At some point, itâs time to let go of hate. It hurts you more than those you hate. It can take over life. Thatâs not easy, but true\n\nGLeigh\n\n. how can you if the same soldiers in the same army are doing the same to the Palestinians.\n\nthis army killed 30.000 Lebanese civilians in 1982 how can you forgive?\n\nSolomon\n\nAmerican Jew.\n\nthank you\n\nalbert\n\nDark age is back Bloodshed in the name of God\n\nGLeigh\n\nsorry have the tired sillies. Still do. Excuse me a little longer.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nHow many in 2006, Solomon?\n\nAkiva\n\nhi albert :D\n\nRod\n\nPoor kids\n\nChildren of Gaza\n\nA freelance filmmaker in Gaza shot this material for Save the Children at a UN-supported school for pupils displaced from their homes by the Israeli bombings\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2009/jan/13/gaza\n\nNow the response will be (Hamas Rockets did this!)\n\nKids who are like these were even less lucky as an Israeli mortar hit the school.\n\nThis war should stop. The massacre should end.\n\nRod\n\nLinda American Jew Akiva hi\n\nLinda\n\nHi Rod,\n\nGood to see you!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nOur lives here are really quite mundane compared to the region of Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, etc.\n\nAlways either in war or war anytime now.\n\nA very very different reality over there!\n\nLots of loved ones lost in horrible ways...\n\nRod\n\nEven the ones waiving White Flags get killed:\n\nAt least three Palestinians in Gaza were shot dead yesterday after Israeli soldiers fired on a group of residents leaving their homes on orders from the military and waving white flags, according to testimony taken by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem.\n\nSolomon\n\nAmerican Jew.\n\ni150 civilians.\n\nand 60 children since then by their cluster bombs that they left behind 1.5 million bombs these criminals.\n\nGLeigh\n\nAnother video?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nHi Rod!\n\nRod\n\n\"There is a well-grounded view that both the initial attacks on Gaza and the tactics being used by Israel are serious violations of the UN charter, the Geneva conventions, international law and international humanitarian law,\" said Richard Falk, the UN's special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories and professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University.\n\nAkiva\n\nhi Rod :D\n\nhope your well today :)\n\ni am a bit sad ... all this suffering in gaza is terrible!\n\nbut i had a funy day :D\n\ni found some clever guys :) was talking long time with them, and it was funy :)\n\nbut still i cant forget the people which are really suffering in gaza!\n\ni hope this holocaust will end soon!\n\ni hope Ban Ki-Moon will stop israel soon !\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nWhat's your issues with videos, Gleigh?\n\nLinda\n\nRod,\n\nWatch out for the Death Frogs!\n\nGLeigh\n\nOkay Linda. I'm back to earth now. Terrible – I know. Gets the best of me sometimes like during childbirth and the funeral procession from my dad's funeral. I told my sister it was a good thing we had rented a hearse. Her car was a clunker. She said, yeah, not the best time to pop the hood. My mom was crying was between us. She started laughing. I'm a bad influence. We were all crying and laughing.\n\nAkiva\n\nLinda ... go and marry dan perman ... he is in love with you ;) :p\n\nLinda\n\nGLeigh,\n\nI know what you are saying ;)\n\nLinda\n\nJealous, Akiva?\n\nGLeigh\n\nAmerican Jew – do you realize how many people post videos and opinions and want you to watch them all?\n\nGLeigh\n\nIf I made a movie and posted it and told you to watch it – would you feel obligated?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nRod Solomon and All,\n\nI have been reading 'One Country\"\n\nExcellent book!\n\nBrings out much that has happened since Oslo, Camp David 2 from 1993 to 2006.\n\nWhat we do not know nor pay attention to between these wars is VERY telling!\n\nGLeigh\n\nExcuse me another minute.\n\nRod\n\nI wanted American Jew and People with similar mentality watch my Video.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nYes, GL, I plead guilty, as I am one of them re postings.\n\nPeople just want to educate, isn't that what we are here for, to learn?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nOr are we just here to vent only?\n\nLinda\n\nWill someone please post a vidoe about the death frogs?\n\nLinda\n\n*video*\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nNo, you are certainly not obligated, but info is there to learn from, is all.\n\nSolomon\n\nGLeigh.\n\nactually it is nice to see both side of the story so you can try to be fair to both. if you are neutral to start with.\n\nso it is OK for me to see Videos, not propaganda Videos that is done by both side .\n\nthat is why my source is always western and Jewish sources so I will not be accused of being brainwashed by the brainwashed Zionists.\n\nbye for now.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nTo be honest, I cannot watch anymore videos showing maimed and injured kids, but some stuff, I will check out–not all, mind you, but some!\n\nAkiva\n\nRod\n\nhis video...\n\nthis children will endless suffer for life :(\n\nand theyr suffering is nothing at the side of the wounded, of the burned childs\n\nand i cant exactly follow the israelis...\n\nis this peace?\n\nwill such a terror by israel bing peace?\n\nits endless sad! a massacre a holocaust! its the same as hitler did to the jews :(\n\ni condemn hitler, i condemn israel, netanyaho and his gang are nazis :(\n\nban ki moon must stop them now! and not only talk endles until the next 100 generations!\n\nand they must face the international court of justice and pay for what they have done!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nLeaving Solomon?\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – you're just like my friend R. who always gets me in trouble. Her dad was a super strict preacher. One Sunday, when she was little, she roller her program into a spyglass and was watching him preach through it. He stopped after awhile. Everyone knew she was going to get it at home. She did. Sunday before last, I saw her a few aisles over. I had my church program and rolled it up. After a few seconds, she saw me looking at her and did hers. Luckily the preacher didn't notice. My husband did and jabbed his elbow into my side. My nose was running and I was strangling. Didn't laugh out loud though. Thought I'd choke to death though.\n\nLinda\n\nGLeigh and I were talking about some people posting links all of the time, time after time, and never having a conversation about them. that is why she made that comment.\n\nWe all want to see both sides, just just coming on, cut, copy, and pasting books, articles, and videos, without being willing to have a dialogue is very annoying.\n\nGLeigh\n\nbrainwashed by the brainwashed Zionist Solomon. Seems impartial to me.\n\nLinda\n\nI take that as a compliment, GLeigh :)\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nWhat do y'all think?\n\nWhen Solomon shared his human side tonight, telling his story of losing relatives, did that go further with your hearing his anguish as opposed to him calling names?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nNo one has ever asked me to have a dialogue of anything I have posted.\n\nGLeigh\n\nYes.\n\nLinda\n\nAmerican Jew,\n\nI think you hit the nail on the head. No one needs to call anyone names because we are all human, and have our own story. I feel bad for him and his family. I also wonder he and his family can move past it. I hope their hearts can heal, so that they may have real peace!\n\nRod\n\nAmerican jew.\n\nYes when people share their human side and their suffering they will have much more impact on others.\n\nRod\n\nLinda are you being mean to me and my friend American Jew?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nDoes it make a difference to hear a human story than to be called a name–do you hea a person better when that happens? Even if you don't agree with them?\n\nI would be more open to listening to a Beny or a (real) Dan Perman, if they weren't always calling names, belittling anyone who doesn't agree with them, etc\n\nThat goes for people I DO agree with, too, BTW\n\n9\n\nLinda\n\nNOOOO, I'm not being mean to anyone :) I love all of you. You are wonderful people!\n\nGLeigh\n\nAmerican Jew – no offense. It's just so many people post so much. I don't even try. It seems unfair to watch one and not the other.\n\nSolomon – In a way, I feel like we are friends. Just friends who see differently and from worlds that are much different. Excuse my silliness. I had trouble sleeping last night from a knotting up back. I don't have answers. Peace would be good. How that happens, I don't know. Luckily God is God and I'm not. Hopefully, it will all work out.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nMove past it hard when it is constant and unpredictable, but yes, I agree, I hope that one day can move past it, too\n\nRod\n\nok you guys are mean to American Jew because he is nice.\n\nNo one comes close to my friend the smart balanced and humanitarian American Jew\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nI'm not offended GL\n\nJust re-thinking my strategy–LOL\n\nI hate preaching 'to the choir' :P\n\nLinda\n\nMoving past it will take a lot of strength, and I am sure he and is family are so tired of the emotions, that their strengths are stripped. I will try to send some good vibs to him and his, and hopefull they can heal a little.\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – the death frogs just sent me over the edge. That's not a big leap. I will never look at the frogs the same way again.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nMuchas gracias, Rod–back atcha, guy!!\n\nLinda\n\nRod-\n\nYou are so funny. Step away from the love, step away from the love!\n\nLinda\n\nI'm stil laughing histerically! :)\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nGL, your back sounds like my neck!\n\nToo much time in front of the computer, I think.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nRod, Have you read 'One Country\"?\n\nRod\n\nLinda i feel happy when i make you laugh\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nDemographics is a big issue\n\nGLeigh\n\nAJ – Mine was from an accident. Yesterday I was spitting out toothpast into the sink and sneezed.\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – I know you are and you're going to get me in trouble. I'm not looking at you!!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nIsraeli demographer, Arnon Soffer (with the Israeli govt), predicted this Gaza war back in 2001\n\nLinda\n\n:) ;)\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nGL, I am so sorry! Awful LOL\n\n:)\n\nGLeigh\n\nMy dad said it in the 60's. I was born 1959 but still remember. It was bound to happen eventually he said.\n\nGLeigh\n\nI was under ten but listened to him.\n\nRod\n\nI have not read it yet. I am familiar with the idea about one state.\n\nit was just strange, 3 years ago we were discussing the palestinian issue and I proposed a solution to the problem by giving Palestinians the right to vote. One guy said \"ofcourse not\" .I was surprised mostly because he was an American who preaches about democracy.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nInteresting.\n\nIt is the only way really but probably a few–quite a few–years off.\n\nGLeigh\n\nSo we also told countries that they should all have the right to free government. Vietnam chose Communism. I think we might have gone to war with them over. I'm sure that was a shocker too.\n\nRod\n\nI do not think Israel will accept the one State solution and I promise you 99% of palestinians will accept it.\n\nGLeigh\n\nI think the United States has always had ideals but we are only slowly evolving into them. Like equality. Palestinians want Israel gone and the land back. Hence, the problem.\n\nRod\n\nif you give palestinians their rights they will not fight. but it is natural to fight for your rights. the notion that Palestinians should surrender is troubled because no one will accept to live as a salve. if they did their kids won't. Freedom is a human right and I wonder how some have it and deny it to others\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nRead the book, Rod.\n\nIt is very eye-opening about the processes over the past 20+ years–and no–no obligation to read :)\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nI'm preaching to the choir here, ladies...\n\n:)\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda must have left.\n\nGLeigh\n\nSolomon too.\n\nLinda\n\nNo, I'm here. I was just dozing off :) Where are the Death Frogs!\n\nGLeigh\n\nThe problem is simple. A peaceful solution is hard to figure out.\n\nRod\n\nI will read it American jew. and I feel obligated since it is recommended by you.\n\nI have a problem, I read a lot. others are blessed they talk about stuff they never read about.\n\nGLeigh\n\nI'm getting sleepy too. I was pooped after writing today. There were some hardcore, death to people people on then. I take all of that in stride, but still, it was tiring.\n\nRod\n\nGaza Emergency Fact Sheet\n\nJanuary 12, 2009\n\nThe Emergency: The conflict in Gaza that began December 27, 2008 following nearly two years of political instability and tensions has created an extreme humanitarian crisis. Intensive military operations have to date killed over 800 people, injured over 3,100 more, and have exacerbated the deterioration of Gaza's social services and infrastructure. Children and families are experiencing severe shortages of food, clean water, electricity, fuel, medical supplies and drugs. Although daily humanitarian cease-fires are allowing Gazans to seek basic supplies and medical services, the materials arriving in Gaza from international relief agencies is only a fraction needed to alleviate the crisis. As of Jan. 11, much of Gaza had no electricity or running water, and nearly 22,000 people were staying in 27 UN emergency shelters. Many water wells and sewage pumps are inoperable, leaving hundreds of thousands of children and adults without clean water and at risk of waterborne diseases. The World Health Organization has warned that the health care system is also near collapse due to the high number of injuries, shortages of supplies and electricity and the inability of staff to reach hospitals or health centers.\n\nLinda\n\nIt is very stressful, GLeigh! so is researching Death frogs!\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – there are frogs who produce a toxin on their skin, their backs. People lick it a little to get high. Too much, and you can die. I tried not to think about this, to keep it together, but had to tell you. Death frogs do exist!!!!!\n\nRod\n\nThe Impact on Children:\n\nChildren make up over half of Gaza's population, and the situation has reached a critical level for them. Many children are exposed to and experiencing violence, fear and unrest in their communities. At least 130 children have reportedly been killed since the fighting began. Caregivers say children are showing signs of emotional distress and exhaustion. Thousands of children also are at greater risk of malnutrition because of the shortages of food and dairy products. Even before the latest outbreak of violence, 50,000 Gazan children were malnourished; more than two-thirds of all children suffered from vitamin A deficiency and almost half of children under age 2 were anemic. The crisis also has interrupted children's education, as all schools in Gaza are closed, leaving over 441,400 students unable to learn. Sixteen schools have been damaged.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nRod,\n\nIts demographics from Israeli gov't perspective–terrified of being outnumbered by Palestinians in the 'Jewish\" state...\n\nRod\n\nthe source\n\nhttp://www.savethechildren.org/emergencies/middle-east-crisis/gaza-conlfict/gaza-emergency-factsheet.html\n\nGLeigh\n\nRod – it is heartbreaking. The death, the injuries. I blame Hamas one minute and Israel the next and the people who voted in Hamas after that. In the end, finger pointing doesn't fix anything. We need both sides to stop shooting at each other and outside mediators and monitors to seperate them both.\n\nLinda\n\nI know, they live in the rain forest. in costa rica The poison is what makes you high. I learned about all of that in biology. They can also tell you when the climate is changing. I have a pic of one on my calenday. Although, they can not cause death, the are not called death frogs in the scientific world. That is just slang, but Akiva doesn't know it. That is why I was going on and on about them.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nGL, whaddya talking about??\n\nIt's EXHAUSTING!!\n\nWhy do you think I disappeared for a couple of days?\n\nRod\n\nYes. That is Israel's biggest problem. cause Israel considers its end will be when the jews are outnumbered by the palestinians. similar to the Apartheid in South Africa.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nI\"ll lick a frog to that, GL.\n\nMay reconciliation and healing take the place of shooting and killing soon!\n\nGLeigh\n\nI don't blame you AJ. Probably good advice. Those with power will have to fix this one, if it is fixable. But it is heartbreaking. It's all about hate and distruction and death.\n\nAkiva\n\ni hope every member of IDF will carry the pictures of this war in his nightmares for life!\n\ni hope that they go in there to see what they have done!\n\ni am sure everyone, every israeli IDF member will come back to home and will be happy for life about what they did!\n\ni am sure they will share theyr happynes with theyr families!\n\nnetanyahu hates israelis! netanyaho hate jews! .. go and suffer for him.. be proud israel ... be proud!\n\nLinda\n\nI meant to say, Although they can cause death! BTW, I think IT was talking about the red eyed tree frog of costa rica.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nIt won't be, but that is their FEAR!\n\nFear can be deadly\n\nGLeigh\n\nLinda – where on earth did Akiva come up with death frogs anyway? Thought I'd bust a gut when you told me where to read. I am too tired and my back's too sore to start again. Think I'll soak it one more time. Can't hurt.\n\nLinda\n\nI have no idea, GLeigh. I think IT licked some death frogs, and was trippin! ;)\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nTake care of yourself, GL. Soak that back good!\n\nRod\n\nI agree they can still call the one State for Jews and Palestinians \"Israel\" and i do not think the palestinians will mind. The issue is a rights issue. non Jews in the State of Israel are not Treated as Humans. I have seen the suffering. It is horrible and you Know it first hand American Jew. Israel is not willing to give Palestinians their rights.\n\nAkiva\n\nLinda are you still hanging on this frogs? :D\n\ngo to wiki and inform your self about death frogs ;)\n\nyour realy smarter then dan :D\n\nGLeigh\n\nNo offense Akiva. Just struck me as an odd reference. I have to go soak my back awhile. Excuse me. See ya all another day. Night Linda, AJ, Rod, Akiva, whoever. Whatever.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nI have not been able to soak in a hot bath in almost 7 years! Sounds great!!\n\nLinda\n\nAkiva,\n\nI know about them without going to wiki, and you would know that if you could READ.\n\nAkiva\n\ngood nicht GLeigh\n\ni wish you peace!\n\nLinda\n\nGleigh,\n\nI'm with you, I nodding off again. Have a good soak, and don't dream about death frogs!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nHold off on the swear words Akiva?\n\nNot necessary\n\nAkiva\n\nLinda tell us more about death frogs ... oure interesst is totaly at your side ... tell us about death frogs!\n\nLinda\n\nGo read my previous posts.\n\nLinda\n\nGood night All, have a great night :)\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nWhen you read this book, Rod,,,i has been so invisible to the world, but bring light to why the Palestinians have reacted the way they have for years\n\nAkiva\n\n...sure i will ;)\n\nRod\n\nAmerican jew share some of these reason with people here.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nIf only there were a way to simplify it and get it out in the open to 'regular Joe Blows'\n\nThe Israeli Gov't depends on the ignorance of folks and what is NOT seen–between wars.\n\nMix in the rest of the region's political messes, it becomes a worse balaan/mess!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nThey are gone now and do nt like it when we do share info, see above about videos and sites posdtings\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nFrustrating.\n\nI came on these blogs to 'spread info' and, you know what?\n\nIts pointless.\n\nCan't change minds.\n\nAkiva\n\nthey know what hapenet to the clever smart dan, and they know dan is not the only clever guy! they never had any info ... they only did share propaganda from fake sites and other woerse sites!\n\ni wonder who will be the next dan :D\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nNo one has changed MY mind, that's for sure!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nIt is about providing info to the 'undecideds\" I guess.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nAnd to vent...\n\n:)\n\nJudy K Australia\n\nOK another stupid question. Egypt is an Arab nation why is it not taking the women and children over it's border and air lifting them to hospitals?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nEach 'side' provides their info, and folks take what they want and leave the rest...\n\nRod are you still there or am I talking only to myself.?\n\nAkiva\n\nAmerican Jew\n\ni have a question to you... a bit offTopic\n\nmay you dont answer ... i will accept :)\n\ndid you vote for bush? tho times?\n\nwhat you thing kabout today?\n\nwas he a liar? did h blind all americans or most of them?\n\nand if so ... what should happen now to him?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nNo question is stupid, Judy, even tho people call each other stupid all the time here.\n\nI don't know, good question. Politics, I'm sure. They probably don't want to get dragged into this mess.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nI have family in Tasmania Judy!\n\nBeen to Australia twice...beautiful country!!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nAre you kidding, Akiva?? No way!!\n\nI think they should put him, Cheney and gang on Guantanamo...give them a taste of their own medicine!!\n\nI am starting to sound like a 'terrorist', eh?\n\nJudy K Australia\n\nAJ Well I'm sorry but Egypt is in the middle of it as it it their border that the rockets are smuggle from. Non one seems to hit on Egypt and their part in all this. They have a border and the UN could use it to take away women and children and get them medical help. Why are they not doing this?\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nI'm with the 77% who think he's the WORST president we've ever had!\n\nLinda\n\nWow, I jumped back on to make sure I said goodnight to everyone, and low and hehold, I guess I got it right in the back. I said in my above posts, that I didn't like the same people, posting the same videos and links, and were not willing to discuss anything. I did not say anything about either of your postings. The people that do that know who they are. I guess I should go back and read each night, what was said when I get off the blog. I may learn something.\n\nGood night Guys!\n\nJudy K Australia\n\nAJ thankyou yes this country is lovely especially to bring children up in. Aussie are pretty lay back. I have only been to Tassie once for a cattle sale and it was so cold and windy. Would like to go again though. I am in the Hunter Valley, Wine making area of NSW It is about two and a half hours from Sydney. I moved here a couple of years ago. Before then I cam from Armidale in the New England region of NSW.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nWho knows what is happening behind the scenes?\n\nFrom my point of vies high falutin' political leaders have agendas we know nothing about on the surface.\n\nFor that matter, where is the rest of the Arab leaders?? And the world?\n\nEveryone is a talking head, but no one takes ACTION\n\nIt's terrible!\n\nAkiva\n\ni think bush is a liar! he did fool all americans!\n\nhe did legitimate his existence as a president with terror\n\nthis terror as we know today was never a fact! it was a theory or terrory in this case!\n\nall this weapons all this terrorists ... he found nothing and bin laden is still laughing at him!\n\ni think he and his gang did fool all americans and did messup the whole world!\n\nafter him, everything he touched is a disasster!\n\nJudy K Australia\n\nAJ. Once you watch Farenheigt 9/11 you can see how stupid George Bush is.

So I emailed the Egyptian Embassy here in Australia. I know I won't get an answer but I would so like to understand their tactics and why.\n\nAkiva\n\ni think netanyaho is not stupid as bush!\n\nbut i also dont think he is more true!!\n\nhe and his gang are proofed corrupt liars!\n\nand mybe today israel dont know about that\n\nbut hopefull in some years they will open theyr eyes!\n\ni hope they will see what they have done for what reason!\n\nkilling whole Gaza because they was the occupiers?\n\na homemade dessaster... a war because the own faults!\n\ni think in this moment israel is proud!\n\nbut i think also in some years they have no face, they will have no head anymore, they will hide and they will feel very ashame because all the pain which they have broght to gaza!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nIs everyone gone?\n\nGuess I'll call it a night.\n\nNice talking to you, Judy.\n\nG'dye :)\n\nI have a book called Talking Strine\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nGood deed there, Judy!\n\nAkiva\n\ni did also email alot to the embassy of israel :D\n\ni hink the ambassador hate me :(\n\nNick-Canada\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nIsrael is counting on the common sence of all the people , getting support from America, and people like me because we don't stand for terrorist attacks on innocent people, common sence you put an end to it. All this propaganda you supporters of terror bring to this table does not take away from Israel having the right to defend themselves against these filthy pigs that make up Hamas. Israel said this was not going to end any time soon, believe that. So thats all, I will leave you all to argue amongst yourselves, when If you really gave a crap about the Palestinians you would be over there fighting with Hamas, but no your here typing away. Well like I said this war will last a while so I'm sure you will be here tommorow, I'm sure with more good news of targets hit and Hamas weakened, so later\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nYou're not alone, Judy\n\nI emailed the Israeli Prime minister twice\n\nalapone\n\nI did not like Palestinians long time ago but after what Israel was doing in Lebanon and now in Gaza I do not like Israel . It became obvious the problem in middle east is an Israel backed up by USA and Grate Britain. Adolf Hitler was doing with Jews horrible crimes and it looks like Jews were very good students. Jews exterminates anybody else around their state now and International organizations can not do anything but call for cease fire. What about bombing Israel.\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nBackatcha, Nick, everything you just said except substitute the word \"Palestinian\" for Israeli.\n\nYou'll be here typing away too Nick, my friend!\n\njudy joss\n\nIt is only fair that you should give more time to show the affect on Israeli cidtizens. You seem to ply over & over the photage of Gaza's children. What abour the Israeli children, dont they count?\n\njudy Australia\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nIsrael is committing the terrorists acts more so than Hamas right now, Nick.\n\nSince Israel has at the moment the most powerful, they need to be the leaders to stop this insanity\n\nBoth sides need to stop.\n\nAkiva\n\ni did email o the whole israelian gov!\n\nand all embassies\n\nand i cant count how much\n\nthey all did ignore the warcrimes! theyr all guilty!\n\nAmerican Jew\n\nI'm going to bed Akiva\n\nSweet dreams, freunde!\n\nAkiva\n\nSweet dreams AJ :)\n\nhave a good time! ;)\n\nJudy K Australia\n\nOh and just then I emailed our member of the United Nations asking why Egypt does not let the injured women and children across their border to be air lifted out. Gaza does have an airport and if the US put Isreal under pressure they could fly them out too. You all go to bed as I am getting up !\n\nAkiva\n\nEgypt have lot of political interess in this israel gaza story\n\negypt ... the leadership cares not about humans! they cae more about politics\n\nthey will not change this political mind\n\nthey will only change if all egyptians go crazy at them ... then the leadership will see that they will win never a election again and that they will be suspendet by the egyptians\n\nthen they will act to safe them selfs:(\n\nthey are a bit poor minded :( i men the leaders of egypt\n\nAkiva\n\nno sleep to gaza .... no sleep to me :(\n\nNona\n\nGreetings friends and lovers of peace.

They & all Israelis deserve to live in peace. This is the Jewish home land paid for in blood. it is TIME.

That's why Americans who don't support Israel are so obviously ignorant - they see these horrific pictures and jump to ridiculous conclusions like they're grabbing a McDonald's value meal - easy, but no nutritious self-interest whatsoever. Just a bunch of satisfying fat-filled junk with no real substance that provides nothing except immediate gratification based on misleading information.\n\nblood is red\n\nThe Palestinians are sinking in a sea of misery. And the world has pink sunglasses made in ISRAEL\n\nGaza is the largest concentration camp in the World.\n\nThe Jews learn well from the past, and apply the lesson to the Palestinians.\n\nThe Holocaust\n\nThe Holocaust was the systematic persecution and annihilation of more than 6 million Jews as a central act of state by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945. Although millions of others, such as Romani, Sinti, homosexuals, the disabled and political opponents of the Nazi regime, were also victims of persecution and murder, only the Jews were singled out for total extermination.\n\nUnder the leadership of Adolf Hitler, this brutal campaign began with a deliberate series of progressively hostile acts of bigotry, repression, humiliation and discrimination. Authorized by the Nazis and their collaborators, such actions were based on the views that the German (or \"Aryan\") people were a superior \"race,\" that all non-Germans were therefore inferior, and that Jews were race-poisoners. The intervals between each phase - from antilocution (using hostile, bigoted language) to avoidance to discrimination to violence to genocide - were frighteningly small.\n\nJewish victims of the Holocaust were rounded up from all parts of Nazi-occupied Europe and shipped to concentration camps where almost all were shot, hanged, subjected to hideous medical experiments, gassed or worked to death. Only a small percentage survived. It did not matter whether they were rich or poor, religious or secular, or decorated soldiers of the First World War. If they had even one Jewish grandparent (a provision of the Nuremberg Laws), they were marked for destruction.\n\nAny act of resistance against this juggernaut demanded enormous courage. Those who helped or rescued Jews did so at great risk to their own lives and those of their families. While most people remained silent or excused their complicity on the grounds that they were only following orders, a few remarkable people, known today as the Righteous Among Nations, took the risks and hid or rescued Jews. Contrary to the bestiality of the Nazis and the indifference of most people in Germany and in the Nazi-occupied nations, these individuals represent the finest and noblest of the human spirit.\n\nWhen the Nazi regime collapsed in 1945 under the onslaught of the Allied nations and the world learned the full extent to which the hatred of Jews had been carried, the few Jewish survivors faced living without homes, possessions, families and communities. Many left Europe - the continent soaked with the blood of their fellow Jews - and tried to rebuild their shattered lives in the United States, in Israel and elsewhere. The Nazi dream of a \"master race\" came to an end at the War Crimes Trials held at Nuremberg in 1945. The United States, England, France and the Soviet Union joined forces to stand in judgment of the Nazi crimes against humanity.\n\nAkiva\n\nbenyemen\n\nwellcome ... i hope you have a nice time here ;)\n\nits very funy here :D\n\nso much clever people :)\n\nwe can learn here a lot :D\n\nand about the zionists ... international yourt of justice at den-haag!\n\nbenyemen\n\nAKIVA\n\nARE YOU AN ANGEL, TO CALL SATANS TO PRAY\n\nAkiva\n\nhope will never die ;)\n\nDavid Freeman\n\nDear Nona,\n\nyou either a Israeli propagandas or you live in a bubble. You are simply echoing what you here on the news without researching anything? (you're not naÃ¯ve enough to think Israel is our ally do you?) Sounds like youâre accusing others of your own ignorance. And you really believe that Israel is defending itself.\n\nAre you aware that Israel is occupying mostly Palestinian land illegally? And when people resist the occupation, Israel hit back claiming self defense.. the notion of Israel defending itself is merely propaganda to fool people like you. Why? the aggressor (Israel) cannot claim self defense.. you can call it what you want, but it is not self defense â¦LOL.\n\nNona, You are accusing people of being ignorant you stated âThatâs why Americans who donât support Israel are so obviously ignorant â they see these horrific pictures and jump to ridiculous conclusions like theyâre grabbing a McDonaldâs value mealâ it sounds to me like you overdosed on some Happy meals..LOL.. I encourage everybody to research on their own before the post anything on this blog. See videos below:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynWjYHP91gA\n\nNona, are you aware that Palestinians are ghettoized within 12 percent of the original territory in the West Bank. do you know that the West Bank is divided up into 70 isolated cantons with no physical movement without Israeli permission. There are over 500 military check points where Palestinians often wait hours, and must have ID cards and passes just to travel short distances. Israeli settlers can travel easily. Did you know Mr. Clarke that âThe permit system for the Closed Zone is administered in an arbitrary and humiliating mannerâ¦This system, which subjects Palestinian freedom of movement to the whim of the Occupying Power, creates anger, anxiety and humiliation among the population.\n\nYou should have figured it out by now Hamas is simply irrelevant..even if you wipe out Hamas from the face of earth today.. other groups with different name but similar cause will emerge.

THEY RIP ITS FRUITS UNTIL TOMMOROW.\n\nbenyemen\n\nHEY WHERE THE SATANS HAVE GONE, AND AKIVA THERE IS NO HOPE FOR SATANS AND THEIR PROFESSOR'S THE ZIONISTS\n\nDavid Freeman\n\nMr. Blood is Red,\n\nYouâre repeating a known history which mostly falling on deaf ears since it has no new meaning to current debate or events. When you say âThe Jews learn well from the past, and apply the lesson to the Palestiniansâ that implies that all Jews have the same beliefs and that by itself is a fallacy\n\nProfessor\n\nWho will save Israel from itself?\n\nBy Mark LeVine\n\nOne by one the justifications given by Israel for its latest war in Gaza are unravelling.\n\nThe argument that this is a purely defensive war, launched only after Hamas broke a six-month ceasefire has been challenged, not just by observers in the know such as Jimmy Carter, the former US president who helped facilitate the truce, but by centre-right Israeli intelligence think tanks.\n\nThe Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, whose December 31 report titled \"Six Months of the Lull Arrangement Intelligence Report,\" confirmed that the June 19 truce was only \"sporadically violated, and then not by Hamas but instead by ... \"rogue terrorist organisations\".\n\nInstead, \"the escalation and erosion of the lull arrangement\" occurred after Israel killed six Hamas members on November 4 without provocation and then placed the entire Strip under an even more intensive siege the next day.\n\nAccording to a joint Tel Aviv University-European University study, this fits a larger pattern in which Israeli violence has been responsible for ending 79 per cent of all lulls in violence since the outbreak of the second intifada, compared with only 8 per cent for Hamas and other Palestinian factions.\n\nIndeed, the Israeli foreign ministry seems to realise that this argument is losing credibility.\n\nDuring a conference call with half a dozen pro-Israel professors on Thursday, Asaf Shariv, the Consul General of Israel in New York, focused more on the importance of destroying the intricate tunnel system connecting Gaza to the Sinai.\n\nHe claimed that such tunnels were \"as big as the Holland and Lincoln tunnels,\" and offered as proof the \"fact\" that lions and monkeys had been smuggled through them to a zoo in Gaza. In reality, the lions were two small cubs that were drugged, thrown in sacks, and dragged through a tunnel on their way to a private zoo.\n\nIsrael's self-image\n\nThe claim that Hamas will never accept the existence of Israel has proved equally misinformed, as Hamas leaders explicitly announce their intention to do just that in the pages of the Los Angeles Times or to any international leader or journalist who will meet with them.\n\nWith each new family, 10, 20 and 30 strong, buried under the rubble of a building in Gaza, the claim that the Israeli forces have gone out of their way to diminish civilian casualties – long a centre-piece of Israel's image as an enlightened and moral democracy – is falling apart.\n\nAnyone with an internet connection can Google \"Gaza humanitarian catastrophe\" and find the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Territories and read the thousands of pages of evidence documenting the reality of the current fighting, and the long term siege on Gaza that preceded it.\n\nThe Red Cross, normally scrupulous in its unwillingness to single out parties to a conflict for criticism, sharply criticised Israel for preventing medical personnel from reaching wounded Palestinians, some of whom remained trapped for days, slowly starving and dying in the Gazan rubble amidst their dead relatives.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has flatly denied Israeli claims that Palestinian fighters were using the UNRWA school compound bombed on January 6, in which 40 civilians were killed, to launch attacks, and has challenged Israel to prove otherwise.\n\nWar crimes admission\n\nAdditionally, numerous flippant remarks by senior Israeli politicians and generals, including Tzipi Livni, the foreign minister, refusing to make a distinction between civilian people and institutions and fighters – \"Hamas doesn't ... and neither should we\" is how Livni puts it – are rightly being seen as admissions of war crimes.\n\nIndeed, in reviewing statements by Israeli military planners leading up to the invasion, it is clear that there was a well thought out decision to go after Gaza's civilian infrastructure – and with it, civilians.\n\nThe following quote from an interview with Major-General Gadi Eisenkot that appeared in the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth in October, is telling:\n\n\"We will wield disproportionate power against every village from which shots are fired on Israel, and cause immense damage and destruction. From our perspective these [the villages] are military bases,\" he said.\n\n\"This isn't a suggestion. This is a plan that has already been authorised.\"\n\nCausing \"immense damage and destruction\" and considering entire villages \"military bases\" is absolutely prohibited under international law.\n\nEisenkot's description of this planning in light of what is now unfolding in Gaza is a clear admission of conspiracy and intent to commit war crimes, and when taken with the comments above, and numerous others, renders any argument by Israel that it has tried to protect civilians and is not engaging in disproportionate force unbelievable.\n\nInternational laws violated\n\nOn the ground, the evidence mounts ever higher that Israel is systematically violating a host of international laws, including but not limited to Article 56 of the IV Hague Convention of 1907, the First Additional Protocol of the Geneva Convention, the Fourth Geneva Convention (more specifically known as the \"Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949\", the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the principles of Customary International Humanitarian Law.\n\nNone of this excuses or legitimises the firing of rockets or mortars by any Palestinian group at Israeli civilians and non-military targets.\n\nAs Richard Falk, the UN special rapporteur, declared in his most recent statement on Gaza: \"It should be pointed out unambiguously that there is no legal (or moral) justification for firing rockets at civilian targets, and that such behavior is a violation of IHR, associated with the right to life, as well as constitutes a war crime.\"\n\nBy the same logic, however, Israel does not have the right to use such attacks as an excuse to launch an all-out assault on the entire population of Gaza.\n\nIn this context, even Israel's suffering from the constant barrage of rockets is hard to pay due attention to when the numbers of dead and wounded on each side are counted. Any sense of proportion is impossible to sustain with such a calculus.\n\n'Rogue' state\n\nIsraeli commentators and scholars, self-described \"loyal\" Zionists who served proudly in the army in wars past, are now publicly describing their country, in the words of Oxford University professor Avi Shlaim, as a \"rogue\" and gangster\" state led by \"completely unscrupulous leaders\".\n\nNeve Gordon, a politics professor at Ben Gurion University, has declared that Israel's actions in Gaza are like \"raising animals for slaughter on a farm\" and represent a \"bizarre new moral element\" in warfare.\n\n\"The moral voice of restraint has been left behind ... Everything is permitted\" against Palestinians, writes a disgusted Haaretz columnist, Gideon Levy.\n\nFellow Haaretz columnist and daughter of Holocaust survivors, Amira Haas writes of her late parents disgust at how Israeli leaders justified Israel's wars with a \"language laundromat\" aimed at redefining reality and Israel's moral compass. \"Lucky my parents aren't alive to see this,\" she exclaimed.\n\nAround the world people are beginning to compare Israel's attack on Gaza, which after the 2005 withdrawal of Israeli forces and settlers was turned literally into the world's largest prison, to the Jewish uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nExtremist Muslims are using internet forums to collect names and addresses of prominent European Jews with the goal, it seems clear, of assassinating them in retaliation for Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nAl-Qaeda is attempting to exploit this crisis to gain a foothold in Gaza and Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and Syria, as well as through attacking Jewish communities globally.\n\nIran's defiance of both Israel and its main sponsor, the US, is winning it increasing sympathy with each passing day.\n\nDemocratic values eroded\n\nInside Israel, the violence will continue to erode both democratic values in the Jewish community, and any acceptance of the Jewish state's legitimacy in the eyes of its Palestinian citizens.\n\nAnd yet in the US – at least in Washington and in the offices of the mainstream Jewish organisations – the chorus of support for Israel's war on Gaza continues to sing in tight harmony with official Israeli policy, seemingly deaf to the fact that they have become so out of tune with the reality exploding around them.\n\nAt my university, UCI, where last summer Jewish and Muslim students organised a trip together through the occupied territories and Israel so they could see with their own eyes the realities there, old battle lines are being redrawn.\n\nThe Anteaters for Israel, the college pro-Israel group at the University of California, Irvine, sent out an urgent email to the community explaining that, \"Over the past week, increasing amounts of evidence lead us to believe that Hamas is largely responsible for any alleged humanitarian crisis in Gaza\".\n\nI have no idea who the \"us\" is that is referred to in the appeal, although I am sure that the membership of that group is shrinking.\n\nIndeed, one of the sad facts of this latest tragedy is that with each claim publicly refuted by facts on the ground, more and more Americans, including Jews, are refusing to trust the assertions of Israeli and American Jewish leaders.\n\nTrap\n\nEven worse, in the Arab/Muslim world, the horrific images pouring out of Gaza daily are allowing preachers and politicians to deploy well-worn yet still dangerous and inciteful stereotypes against Jews as they rally the masses against Israel – and through it – their own governments.\n\nWhat is most frightening is that the most important of Israel's so-called friends, the US political establishment and the mainstream Jewish leadership, seem clueless to the devastating trap that Israel has led itself into – in good measure with their indulgence and even help.\n\nIt is one that threatens the country's existence far more than any Qassam rockets, with their 0.4 per cent kill rate; even more than the disastrous 2006 invasion of southern Lebanon, which by weakening Israel's deterrence capability in some measure made this war inevitable.\n\nFirst, it is clear that Israel cannot destroy Hamas, it cannot stop the rockets unless it agrees to a truce that will go far to meeting the primary demand of Hamas – an end to the siege.\n\nMerely by surviving (and it surely will survive) Hamas, like Hezbollah in 2006, will have won.\n\nIsrael is succeeding in doing little more than creating another generation of Palestinians with hearts filled with rage and a need for revenge.\n\nSecond, Israel's main patron, the US, along with the conservative Arab autocracies and monarchies that are its only allies left in the Muslim world, are losing whatever crumbs of legitimacy they still had with their young and angry populations.\n\nThe weaker the US and its axis becomes in the Middle East, the more precarious becomes Israel's long-term security. Indeed, any chance that the US could convince the Muslim world to pressure Iran to give up its quest for nuclear weapons has been buried in Gaza.\n\nThird, as Israel brutalises Palestinians, it brutalises its own people. You cannot occupy another people and engage in violence against them at this scale without doing even greater damage to your soul.\n\nThe high incidence of violent crimes committed by veterans returning from combat duty in Iraq is but one example of how the violence of occupation and war eat away at people's moral centre.\n\nWhile in the US only a small fraction of the population participates in war; in Israel, most able-bodied men end up participating.\n\nThe effects of the latest violence perpetrated against Palestinians upon the collective Israeli soul is incalculable; the notion that it can survive as an \"ethnocracy\" – favouring one ethnic group, Jews, yet by and large democratic – is becoming a fiction.\n\nViolence-as-power\n\nWho will save Israel from herself?\n\nIsraelis are clearly incapable. Their addiction as a society to the illusion of violence-as-power has reached the level of collective mental illness.\n\nAs Haaretz reporter Yossi Melman described it on January 10, \"Israel has created an image of itself of a madman that has lost it\".\n\nNot Palestinians, too many of whom have fallen prey to the same condition.\n\nNot the Middle East Quartet, the European Union, the United Nations, or the Arab League, all of whom are utterly powerless to influence Israeli policy.\n\nNot the organised Jewish leadership in the US and Europe, who are even more blind to what is happening than most Israelis, who at least allow internal debate about the wisdom of their government's policies.\n\nNot the growing progressive Jewish community, which will need years to achieve enough social and political power to challenge the status quo.\n\nAnd not senior American politicians and policy-makers who are either unwilling to risk alienating American Jewish voters, or have been so brainwashed by the constant barrage of propaganda put out by the \"Israel Lobby\" that they are incapable of reaching an independent judgment about the conflict.\n\nDuring the US presidential race, Barack Obama was ridiculed for being a messiah-like figure. The idea does not sound so funny now. It is hard to imagine anyone less saving Israel, the Palestinians, and the world from another four years of mindless violence.\n\nUpdate: In a further challenge to the democratic process in Israel, on January 12, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the Central Elections Committee had voted overwhelmingly to bar Arab-led parties from participating in the upcoming parliamentary elections.\n\nAlso, there are reports that the claim that extremist Muslims are using the internet to collect names and addresses of prominent British Jews in order to attack them, might in fact have been a hoax.\n\nMark LeVine is a professor of Middle East history at the University of California, Irvine, and is the author of Heavy Metal Islam: Rock, Resistance, and the Struggle for the Soul of Islam and the soon to be published An Impossible Peace: Israel/Palestine Since 1989.\n\nProfessor\n\nIsrael 'using white phosphorus'\n\nHuman Rights Watch has called on Israel to stop using white phosphorus which it says has been used in military operations in the densely populated Gaza Strip.\n\nThe US-based group said that its researchers observed the use of the chemical, which can burn away human flesh to the bone, over Gaza City and Jabaliya on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"We went by Israeli artillery units that had white phosphorus rounds with the fuses in them,\" Marc Garlasco, a senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"Clearly it is [white phosphorus], we can tell by the explosions and the tendrils that go down [and] the fires that were burning,\" he said.\n\n\"Today there were massive attacks in Jabaliya when we were there. We saw that there were numerous fires once the white phosphorus had gone in.\"\n\n'Obscurant'\n\nInternational law permits the use of white phopshorus as an \"obscurant\" to cover troop movements and prevent enemies from using certain guided weapons, but its use is controversial as it can injure people through painful chemical burns.\n\n\"Even if they are using it as an obscurant, they are using it in a very densely populated area,\" Garlasco said.\n\n\"The problem is it covers such a wide area that when the white phosphorus wafers come down, over 100 in each artillery shell, they burn everything they touch and they don't stop burning until they are done.\n\n\"You are talking about skin damage, potentially homes going on fire, damage to infrastructure.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that it believed the use of the chemical in Gaza violated the requirement under international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injury and loss of life.\n\nThe Israeli military has previously denied using white phosphorus during the 15-day offensive in the Gaza Strip, but has said that any munitions that it does use comply with international law.\n\nIsrael used white phophorus during its 34-day war against Lebanon's Hezbollah movement in 2006, while the United States used it during the controversial siege of the Iraqi city of Fallujah in 2004.\n\nbenyemen\n\nDAVID FREEMAN\n\nI BELIEVE NOT ALL JEWS HAS THE SAME BELIEFS, BECAUSE TRUTHFUL AND REAL RELIGIOUS JEWS DONT EVEN WANT TO STAY IN PALESTINE AND THEY DON'T EVEN RECOGNISE ISRAEL EXISTANCE.\n\nProfessor\n\nIsrael's 'other voices' go unheard\n\nBy Rachel Shabi in Israel\n\n\"It is very difficult to add a different voice, because the public and media discourse is so monochrome and so militaristic,\" said Nomika Zion, an Israeli member of the peace collective, Another Voice.\n\nThis group, which comprises residents of both Gaza and neighbouring Israeli towns like Sderot, is seeking to present an alternative to the majority of Israeli pro-war opinions that currently dominate the media.\n\nIt is a tough task.\n\nZion, herself from Sderot, recalled one occasion when a colleague was verbally attacked in the middle of a TV interview by a group of passers-by who tried to pull the mike away from him.\n\n\"I really feel that our democracy is in trouble sometimes,\" she says.\n\n\"If you can't raise your voice and say things aloud without being scared that someone will attack you, it is very dangerous for our society.\"\n\nDeconstructing government justifications\n\nMedia reports on the Israeli view of the country's war in Gaza converge on the overwhelming public approval for it – polls show over 80 per cent are in favour of the attacks.\n\nIsraelis who are not supportive of the war face the sort of public derision that Zion describes.\n\nThey also face the challenge of deconstructing the government's justification for its deadly assaults on Gaza – a series of key messages that are strongly endorsed in both public and media spheres.\n\nSuch messages include assertions that Hamas is a terrorist organisation backed by Iran; Hamas broke the six-month ceasefire that ended a few weeks ago; and that Israel is waging a war of self-defence against Hamas and not against ordinary Gazans.\n\n\"Many people in Israel call us traitors and war criminals because we talk about the war while it is still going on,\" said Teddy Katz of the Israeli peace group, Gush Shalom.\n\n\"But the truth is that this government ordered a criminal war.\"\n\nAlternative voices\n\nGush Shalom is one member of a coalition that held a news conference on Wednesday, January 7, 2009, to brief the media on peace camp positions.\n\nSome speakers at the news conference focused on what they held to be Israel's real motives for the war – election success and also, according to Katz, sanitising corrupt political reputations is also a factor.\n\nOthers presented alternative voices from Israel's southern region, which has for years been in the line of fire of rockets from Gaza â and which is considered predominantly in favour of the war ostensibly waged to defend it.\n\n\"My son is there [serving in Gaza] and my other sons are scared by the bombs falling over our house,\" said Dr Yeela Raanan, from Moshav Ein-Habsor, a farm community on the Israeli edge of the Gaza strip.\n\n\"As a mother, it's scary ... and I think about the mothers in Gaza and how much more scared they are feeling during this time.\"\n\nIn Sderot, Zion explains that it is precisely because she has been traumatised by rocket attacks that she has less tolerance for her nation's current militaristic mood.\n\n\"As a wounded person, I cannot bear this,\" she said.\n\n\"I feel there is such a euphoria and glorification of war, as though it's a wedding or a celebration. I can't agree with this attitude. War is a dangerous and traumatic thing and we have to treat it like that.\"\n\nMedia shift\n\nMass support for war surfaces in the national media at the start of any assault, says Professor Gabriel Weimann, a communications expert at Haifa University who has researched media coverage across several conflict zones.\n\n\"During the first week, in every war, the media is very patriotic and rallies round the flag,\" he said.\n\n\"Journalists see themselves more as citizens than professionals.\"\n\nBut the national media shifts as a war progresses, he adds, and this is already beginning to happen in Israel.\n\n\"You can see a split and cleavages within the Israel public media,\" he said.\n\n\"At every junction of the operation, there is potential for disagreements. So, now, after the ground attack began, you see articles about how far Israel should go, if it should stay in Gaza, move into the cities, go after Hamas or negotiate with Hamas.\"\n\nAnalysts say that the fate of the Israeli combat soldiers on the ground in Gaza is the factor most likely to turn public opinion about the war.\n\n\"The value of a soldier is perceived as greater than the value of a civilian,\" said Professor Tamara Hermann, the co-author of a monthly poll that monitors Israeli public opinion.\n\n\"The media and public discussion on Israeli soldiers relates to them as children, as sons and not as actual soldiers in tanks and so on. There is an understanding that Israeli soldiers are all our children – so that's why they are so dear to us.\"\n\nkapil sharma\n\nit is very obvious that israel will use its full millitary might to dismantle hamas.hamas is a by produt of palestine only and they will have to bear the burnt for voting for a extremist organisation like hamas which been lablled as terrorist organisation by U.S.\n\nblood is red\n\nTo Mr. Freeman\n\nIt is obvious that not all the fingers are the identical.\n\nBut belong to the same hand.\n\nbenyemen\n\nPROFESSOR,\n\nWHAT JUSTIFICATION – DEFEND ISRAEL FROM WHAT?

The situation is untenable. It's genocide,\" d'Escoto said at the UN in New York.\n\nAbout 970 Palestinians have been killed and 4,300 injured since Israel began its Gaza offensive on December 27, which it says is to stop Palestinian fighters attacking Israel with rockets.\n\nEmergency session\n\nThe UN General Assembly said on Tuesday that it was set to hold an emergency session on Thursday to discuss the crisis after a previous session was postponed last week ahead of a UN Security Council vote on the issue.\n\nThe Security Council adopted a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, but Israel has escalated its offensive and Palestinian rocket fire has also continued.\n\n\"There have been some who were under the illusion that the Security Council would do something that could help the situation,\" d'Escoto said. \"I never thought so.\n\n\"Now we're faced with not only with a lack of compliance but with a prime minister of Israel who has practically responded to the Security Council by saying 'mind your own business'.\n\n\"It's unbelievable that a country that owes its existence to a general assembly resolution could be so disdainful of the resolutions that emanate from the UN.\"\n\nD'Escoto, a former Roman Catholic priest and Nicaragua foreign minister, is known for his outspoken criticism of Israel and last year likened Israel's treatment of the Palestinians to the racist apartheid system previously used in South Africa.\n\nGabriela Shalev, Israel's ambassador to the UN, called d'Escoto an \"Israel hater\" for having hugged Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president and a vocal critic of Israel.\n\nD'Escoto also said the UN had to bear some responsibility for the long-standing conflict in the Middle East as it had allowed the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, leaving the Palestinians stateless.\n\n\"You have to attack problems at their root cause and the Palestinian people have been subjected to subhuman treatment for decades and this [the Israeli offensive] is going to make matters worse.\"\n\nBan visit\n\nBan Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, is travelling to the Middle East to press for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nBan will first visit Cairo, where he will meet Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president, for talks on a joint French-Egyptian ceasefire initiative.\n\nHe then heads to Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian Authority-controlled West Bank, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria and Kuwait where he said an Arab League economic summit will also hold talks on Gaza.\n\nOfficials said he would not visit Gaza because of the ongoing conflict.\n\nProfessor\n\nIsrael 'shelled Gaza civilians'\n\nThe United Nations says it has received reports that about 30 Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces shelled a house after they had moved about 110 civilians inside it.\n\n\"According to several testimonies, on 4 January Israeli foot soldiers evacuated approximately 110 Palestinians into a single-residence house in Zeitun, warning them to stay indoors,\" the UN report said on Friday.\n\n\"Twenty-four hours later, Israeli forces shelled the home repeatedly, killing approximately 30.\"\n\nThe incident took place on Monday in the Zeitun neighbourhood of Gaza City on Monday, the report said.\n\nThe UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) called it \"one of the gravest incidents since the beginning of operations\" by Israeli forces in Gaza on December 27.\n\n\"Those who survived and were able walked two kilometres to Salah Ed Din road before being transported to hospital in civilian vehicles,\" OCHA said.\n\n\"Three children, the youngest of whom was five months old, died upon arrival at the hospital.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said on Friday that it had no knowledge of the incident.\n\nWounded wait\n\nThe Israeli B'Tselem human rights group quoted Meysa Fawzi al Samouni, a 19-year-old resident, as saying that soldiers forced her and dozens of others to move into the warehouse-like home of another resident before the attack.\n\n\"As far as I know, the dead and wounded who were under the ruins are still there,\" B'Tselem quoted her as saying.\n\nIbrahim Samouni, a 13-year-old boy who was wounded in the leg and chest, told the Reuters news agency that he kept his three younger brothers alive and tried to help the injured adults lying among the dead after his mother was killed in the incident.\n\n\"There was no water, no bread, nothing to eat,\" he said.\n\n\"Abu Salah died, his wife died. Abu Tawfiq died, his son died, his wife also died. Mohammed Ibrahim died, and his mother died. Ishaq died and Nasar died. The wife of Nael Samouni died. Many people died.\"\n\nEmergency workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Palestinian Red Crescent said they were not able to reach the wounded for four days because Israel would not allow them safe passage.\n\nThey said the children were starving when rescuers finally reached them after the \"unacceptable\" delay.\n\n\"They were too weak to stand up on their own. One man was also found alive, too weak to stand up. In all, there were at least 12 corpses lying on mattresses,\" the ICRC said.\n\nCivilian casualties\n\nPierre Wettach, the ICRC chief for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, said: \"The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded.\n\n\"Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestinian Red Crescent to assist the wounded.\"\n\nIsrael has repreatedly insisted it has tried to avert civilian casualties during its two-week aerial and ground assault on the territory.\n\n\"From initial checking, we don't have knowledge of this incident. We started an inquiry but we still don't know about it,\" Avital Leibovich, an Israeli military spokeswoman, said about the reported shelling incident.\n\nMore than 780 people, including at least 257 children and 56 women, have been killed during Israel's aerial bombardment and ground offensive, the UN has said.\n\nblood is red\n\nBy Stephen R. Kaufman, M.D.\n\nhttp://www.christianveg.com\n\nPart 20: Violence in the Hebrew Scriptures\n\nViolence is a central theme of the Hebrew Scriptures, with over 1000 passages discussing violence or threats of violence. (See Raymond Schwager, Must There Be Scapegoats?) Rarely, God is violently destructive for no apparent reason. Uncommonly, God angrily takes out revenge for evildoing. Much more frequently, God hands over evildoers to violent humans, who do the punishing for God. An example of God turning over evildoers to violent humans is Ezekiel 21:31, which describes Godâs wrath against the Ammonites: âAnd I will pour out my indignation upon you; I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver you into the hands of brutal men, skillful to destroy.â One might see this as divine retribution, but one may also read this passage as illustrating the effects of mimetic violence.\n\nThe Hebrews, hating their enemies, believed that their own violence was ordained by Godâsacred acts of retribution and justice. It is certainly possible that God is indeed bent on violence and revenge. I think that one may also, reasonably, adopt a Girardian approach and conclude that the ancient Hebrewâs own written account of conflicts attributes their own vengeful violence to the will of God.\n\nIt is remarkable that, in about 70 p"
