        "text": "Eduardo Jesús Vargas Rojas (Spanish pronunciation: [eˈðwaɾðo ˈβaɾɣas]; born 20 November 1989) is a Chilean footballer who plays as a forward for Liga MX club Tigres UANL and the Chile national team. Emerging as a top talent at Cobreloa, Vargas moved to Universidad de Chile where he won three titles, including the 2011 Copa Sudamericana, where he was named player of the tournament. In 2011, he was co-awarded the Chilean Footballer of the Year and also finished as runner-up for the South American Footballer of the Year. Following an £11.5 million move to Napoli, Vargas had subsequent loan spells at Grêmio, Valencia and Queens Park Rangers before moving to 1899 Hoffenheim in 2015. A full international since 2010, Vargas has earned over 80 caps for Chile, scoring 38 goals. He was part of their squad at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa América, the Copa América Centenario, the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2019 Copa América. He would finish as top scorer in Chile's victories at the 2015 Copa América and Copa América Centenario.\n\nEduardo Alberto Duhalde (Spanish pronunciation: [eˈðwaɾdo alˈβeɾto ˈðwalde]; born 5 October 1941) is an Argentine politician who served as President of Argentina from 2002 to 2003. Born in Lomas de Zamora, he was elected for the local legislature and appointed mayor in 1973. He was deposed during the 1976 Argentine coup d'état, and elected again when democracy was restored in 1983. He was elected vice-president of Argentina in 1989, under President Carlos Menem. Duhalde resigned as vice president and was elected Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 1991, and re-elected in 1995. He ran for president in 1999, being defeated by Fernando de la Rúa. De la Rúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and Congress appointed the governor of San Luis Province Adolfo Rodríguez Saá as president. When Rodríguez Saá also resigned, Congress appointed Duhalde. During Duhalde's term in office, a huge currency devaluation and an increase of the exchange rate led to a gradual recovery. He successfully supported the obscure candidate Néstor Kirchner against Menem, who sought a new presidential term. Duhalde had political disputes with Kirchner in later years, and is largely retired from politics since his defeat in the 2011 presidential elections.\n\nEduardo De Filippo (Italian: [eduˈardo de fiˈlippo]; 24 May 1900 – 31 October 1984), also known simply as Eduardo was an Italian actor, playwright, screenwriter, author and poet, best known for his Neapolitan works Filumena Marturano and Napoli Milionaria. Considered one of the most important italian artists of 20th century, Eduardo was the author of many theatrical dramas staged and directed by himself first and later awarded and played outside Italy. For his artistic merits and contribution to the culture was named senatore a vita by Italian Presidente della Repubblica Sandro Pertini.\n\nEduardo Alonso Nájera Pérez (Spanish pronunciation: [eˈðwaɾðo ˈnaxeɾa]) (born July 11, 1976) is a Mexican retired professional basketball player and currently a scout with the Dallas Mavericks. He is also a pregame and postgame analyst on Mavericks Live on Fox Sports Southwest, where he is identified as Eddie. Before being promoted to a scout with the Mavs, he was head coach of the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League."
