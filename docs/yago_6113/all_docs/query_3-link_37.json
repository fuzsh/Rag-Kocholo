        "text": "I met up with Joe (Bomitoni) and his boyfriend and Douglas Park for a Cinco de Mayo festival. They had a series special guest: Eduardo Capetillo, Bibi Gaytan, Alex Sirvent and some other actress, who I cannot recall her name, but you could see her on the pictures. I got there late because I could not find a ride. Unfortunately, I was not able to take pictures with anyone but I took pictures of the celebrities on stage. I mostly took pictures of Eduardo because he was closer to the public and was the only one who kept facing and greeting his fans. I was surprised to see, what I assume, is a beer belly. Bibi is beautiful though and there is no way you can tell she had 4 kids and is in her mid 30's. Since there were a lot of people, I was not able to find Joe, until after the presentation. By the time I met up with Joe, he had already called Bibi's attention with the album he had of hers. He was fortunate to get an autograph and a picture, which I'm sure he'll post soon and I'll share. Bibi is absolutely gorgeous and a tad taller than her husband, Eduardo. Here are a few pictures:\n\nFrom: bomitoni\n\n2006-05-08 03:30 pm (UTC)\n\nThanks for posting your pics as well! I went ahead and put them up on my blog for all to see!...\n\nFrom: bjorklin\n\n2006-05-08 06:26 pm (UTC)\n\nno problem\n\nFrom: moon_girl86\n\n2006-05-10 02:51 am (UTC)\n\nBibi is such a beautiful woman. I loved her in \"Camila\". Her and Eduardo make a lovely couple together. I can't believe either that she had four kids and she still looks fabulous. The actress you are talking about is Manuela Ímaz. She was actually in \"Camila\" with Bibi and Eduardo but I think her role in the telenovela was a small role.\n\nFrom: bjorklin\n\n2006-05-10 03:06 am (UTC)\n\ni remember her from corazones al limite\n\nFrom: moon_girl86\n\n2006-05-10 03:12 am (UTC)\n\nYeah, I did not even know she was in \"Camila\" until I put her name in search on imdb.com. It says there about her being in \"Camila\". I knew her from \"Amigas y rivales\".\n\nFrom: bjorklin\n\n2006-05-10 03:14 am (UTC)\n\nyep..\n\nFrom: suga_suga_shy_g\n\n2006-07-08 10:59 pm (UTC)\n\nlol\n\nyea thats manuela all right i saw her in camila in one of the times univision/telefutura reran it... i saw a little of it and she was just in the background talkin to people...she wasn't that very much important indeed\n\nFrom: bjorklin\n\n2006-07-09 02:54 am (UTC)\n\nRe: lol\n\ni remember her from corazones al limite.\n\nFrom: (Anonymous)\n\n2006-07-10 08:09 pm (UTC)\n\nRe: lol\n\nyea she was also in amigas y rivales, las vias del amor and apusta x un amor lol\n\nFrom: bjorklin\n\n2006-07-11 02:29 am (UTC)\n\nRe: lol\n\ni sense you are her fan. lol"
