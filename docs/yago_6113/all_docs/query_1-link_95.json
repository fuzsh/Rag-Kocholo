But, although they have proven to be a solid couple who love each other following more than three decades of marriage, the public has not been very in agreement with this love, as they affirm that the melodrama heartthrob is a super toxic person who truncates his life and It controls every aspect.\n\nSo in an interview with First handCapetillo once once more made it clear that he doesn’t care regarding all of this, since they have always experienced these attacks: “In the case of Biby and I, we have learned to let the comments slide us more. We have been married for 30 years; since At first, my divine wife was pregnant, and some said: ‘These two won’t last two months.’ They judged us,” adding that today they don’t take much importance: “We deal with many things. The rumors hurt much more before.”\n\nBiby yEduardo. Internet\n\nLikewise, the actor I am your mastermade it clear that they do not care regarding the very negative comments regarding them that they have been responsible for launching, highlighting that the best thing in their life is not fame or money, but the love of Gaytán and his children, in addition to the support of God: “I have to understand something: 30 years of marriage, a beautiful wife, children… That love I receive is my true success. It is not regarding the rating or the bank account; my God is not money or power.”\n\nFinally the participant of Voice Game He declared that he is clear that there will always be both fans and haters and he has already learned to value and give weight to what is truly important in his life: “I have to understand that I am not a gold coin for everyone to like me, there will be someone who “Don’t like my style of singing, my songs, whoever doesn’t like me returning to the stage, but that’s their problem, I love what’s happening, what I’m experiencing.”\n\nSource: Yaqui Tribune"
