Working hand in hand with Bibi Gaytán on our De mamá a mamá program, we can help Latina mothers across the U.S. make every day special for their families.”\n\nThe Kraft De mamá a mamá program incorporates a series of television vignettes and radio spots showcased in Hispanic markets.

There were also links to Recipe Exchange, Comida y Familia, Cooking School, Healthy Living, Promotions and Our Products sections.\n\nMexican-born actress and singer Gaytán gained popularity by acting in many popular telenovelas and when she joined the musical group Timbiriche in 1989. After meeting actor Eduardo Capetillo on the set of her last telenovela, she married and retired from show business to focus on being a wife and mother.\n\nKraft Foods, one of the world’s largest food and beverage companies, has annual revenues of more than $34 billion. Kraft markets a broad portfolio of brands in 155 countries, including seven brands with revenue of more than $1 billion, such as Kraft cheeses, dinners and dressings; Oscar Mayer meats; Philadelphia cream cheese; Post cereals; Nabisco cookies and crackers; Jacobs coffees and Milka chocolates.\n\n“Marketing to New Hispanic Moms – a case study” audio recording\n\nPresenter Cynthia Nelson, COO, Todobebe\n\nFind out about\n\n• New Latina mom market\n\n• Baby demographics including market size, profile\n\n• New moms’ language preferences\n\n• Latino baby market trends\n\n• Factors influencing Hispanic baby market\n\n• Location of new Hispanic moms’ market\n\n• Issues affecting new Latino moms\n\n• Todobebe strategies"
