        "text": "Lucero Mijares, Eduardo Capetillo Gaytán and Mía Rubín are part of the cast of 'Juego de Voces' (Photo by Adrián Monroy/Medios y Media/Getty Images)\n\nCelebrities such as Manuel Mijares, Eduardo Capetillo and Erik Rubín will collect part of the fruits of the work they have done as parents together with Lucero Mijares, Eduardo Capetillo Jr. and Mía in the singing contest. voice game, which is hosted by Angélica Vale and will premiere on April 14 on Canal de las Estrellas.\n\nIn the case of the Capetillos, there is a particular interest on the part of Eduardo to participate with his son because the boy represents the third generation of the dynasty that Manuel Capetillo started and was continued by Guillermo, Manuel and Lalo himself. The youngest of that lineage begins to open doors in the artistic world to develop in acting and music.\n\nAfter participating in the Netflix series where there was fire in 2022 and in the 2023 edition of the reality show Kitchen master from TV Azteca, Capetillo Jr. recognized that it is time to define himself as an actor, something that he had not planned three years ago when his intention was to focus fully on the musical field as a singer. For this process, he has a guide in his father who first formed him as a person and then gave him tools to face the vicissitudes of fame, such as the criticism and comparisons he will receive because of his last name.\n\n“When there are complex things, like trials, you feel the bad vibe. That's when I turn around and tell my kids 'welcome to the real world', welcome. \"They have two options: either you move away from the artistic medium, or you take it as it should be, with the perspective of what it is,\" To a specific question, he commented at a press conference what he talks to his son about his relationship with the press.\n\nCapetillo cares, above all, that his son is an upright, respectful and focused person. Together with Bibi Gaytán, his wife and mother of Eduardo Jr., they have made an effort to bring him to this stage of his career at the beginning so that he does not forget that the humanity in him is a guiding axis.\n\n«But far from professional teaching, I put the human being at the center. I try to give my children that teaching about being human. When they behave well, it gives me great pleasure and makes me proud when they say 'hey' to me. What a polite boy,' because then I think we've done something good. \"That is a responsibility of us parents.\"\n\nBibi Gaytán and Eduardo Capetillo throw their first-born son into the ring with instructions to understand respect for others, including the public. and do not resent anyone who thinks or expresses themselves differently in relation to their performance.\n\nManuel Mijares, Alicia Villarreal, Eduardo Capetillo, Isabel Lascuráin, Erik Rubín, Eduardo Suárez, Ricardo Margaleff, Angélica Vale, Marcelo Strupini, Lucero Mijares, Eduardo Capetillo Gaytán, Mía Rubín, Joss Álvarez and Melenie Carmona in the presentation of the musical contest' Game of Voices'. (Photo by Adrián Monroy/Medios y Media/Getty Images)\n\nBy contrast, Mijares has already gone through that stage that is just beginning for the Capetillos. In the company of Lucero, despite being separated, they worked together so that Lucerito began to carve out his professional path with determination, self-confidence and rigorous commitment to the stage and the public.\n\nOn an upward note, Lucero Mijares has resisted malicious comments about her weight or comparisons to her mother. However, since she is already treated like an artist her age, she resents that her career and that of other singers of her generation are a source of competition for the press. In that sense, Their parents do not intervene because they allow them to acquire maturity to act in these situations.\n\nMijares is in a position to support his daughter in the search for her style, within the framework of accentuating her personal stamp. She contributes by cooperating with Lucerito's ingenuity. This coexistence gives you the opportunity to be surprised by her and admire her. For example in voice game, He marveled at a freestyle challenge between the two.\n\n«In the captains' duel I drop my last name, I am no longer Mijares. It doesn't matter that you are the soldier of love, I swear that today I will make you feel terror. I will leave you disoriented. \"Better to stay still and see how inheritance wins over experience,\" he sang in his rap.\n\nBeyond the fact that it was a competition to entertain the public, Mijares could not let go of his paternal love. During his daughter's musical number he was captivated. Gaping and staring at her, The singer was the living image of the admiration that a famous dad can feel for an heiress who has an inexhaustible talent to explore.\n\nAnother father figure that stands out in the reality show is Erik Rubín. Just as he has done since Mía let him know that she wanted to develop professionally as a singer-songwriter, he remains by her side. Like Mijares and Lucero Mijares, they have been collaborating for some time in areas such as production, composition and image projection; Rubín was the one who supported the idea that he stop using the last name Rubín Legarreta to be able to move on his own.\n\nUnlike his colleagues, Erik comes to this program with the aim of distancing himself a little from the role of musician with which Mía is associated. He wants to open up, show himself vulnerable as her father, showing that the artist with her blood is ultimately her little girl: “They take us out of our comfort zone to try new and different things.”\n\nAlso participating in 'Game of Voices' are Alicia Villarreal and Isabel Lascuráin with her children Melenie and Joss Álvarez.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED | ON VIDEO\n\nPaul McCartney reveals the \"embarrassing\" moment he suffered live with the Beatles\n\nThis post appeared first on: es-us.vida-estilo.yahoo.com"
