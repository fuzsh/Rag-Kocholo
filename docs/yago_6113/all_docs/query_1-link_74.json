        "text": "ANAHEIM – For actresses Brooke Shields and Denise Richards, the opening of Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage wasn’t just about going on the re-opened Disneyland ride, it was a chance to bring their young daughters to the theme park for the first time\n\n“I remember the submarine ride from a long time ago,” said Richards, as she carried 3-year-old daughter Sam. “The kids don’t really understand it until they see it. They just understand they are at Disneyland\n\nDisneyland is going all out for the long-awaited return of the submarine ride, complete with Sunday’s “blue” carpet arrival for celebrities, weekend-long events for media and a major advertising push for months. The ride, which closed nine years ago, officially re-opens Monday with an updated theme and technology – animated characters from the “Finding Nemo” movie that appear like they are swimming in the water alongside the subs\n\n“It is fantastic,” said John Lasseter, chief creative officer of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios. “It’s more than we wanted it be: It brings the submarine voyage back, one of my favorite rides back. It brings the characters of ‘Finding Nemo’ to life in the park\n\nAbout 75 international reporters from countries including Japan, Australia, Spain and Mexico, as well as about 250 domestic journalists, flooded into the park for the ride and a chance to spot dozens of celebrities. The Australian “Today” morning show broadcast live from Sunday’s event, which happened at 6:30 a.m. Monday Australia time.\n\nSunday’s arrival included actors and actresses Courteney Cox and her husband, David Arquette, and his sisters, Patricia and Rosanna; Latino stars, including pop singer Noelia and telenovela stars/married couple Bibi Gaytan and Eduardo Capetillo, and athletes, such as basketball players Kobe Bryant and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Some toted their tots, while others had their children wait elsewhere\n\nSome never got the chance to go on the previous ride, which opened in 1959, but are fans of the Nemo movie. Others were looking forward to its return\n\n“We were just married when it was the last time (on the ride). We really missed it,” Capetillo said.\n\nShields made a weekend of the celebration, bringing 4-year-old Rowan and 1-year-old Grier starting Saturday. Last week, her daughters asked how many hours were left before they could go to Disneyland. When it got closer, they asked how many minutes. On Saturday, Rowan learned how to wave like a Disney princess and got to check out the Nemo ride\n\n“She’s been in awe,” said Shields of Rowan, who wore pink Mickey Mouse ears.\n\nActor Alexander Gould, who used to live in Cypress, was the voice of Nemo in the movie, but not the ride. Still, he was excited that the role that launched his young career would be in the park\n\n“It’s really awesome,” said Gould, 13, who is in the Showtime show “Weeds.” “I’m going to be immortalized in Disneyland forever.”\n\nFAKE FISH ARE OUT\n\nThe former voyage featured fish dangling from strings, animatronic mermaids and a menacing sea serpent.\n\nThey’ve been replaced by talking cartoon clown fish, bouncing iridescent jellyfish and a dark trip into a whale’s mouth.\n\nThe Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage may be in the same vessels and location as the previous Disneyland sub ride that closed nine years ago, but the new technology is among the most complicated Disney creators have attempted.\n\nOn Monday, general Disneyland visitors will be able to see the results when the attraction officially opens.\n\n“There’s a lot of sophistication which hopefully becomes totally transparent,” said Rick Rothschild, senior vice president and executive show director.\n\nDisney reportedly has spent more than $100 million to refurbish the ride, according to Al Lutz, editor of Miceage.com, a Disney watchdog Web site.\n\nNow, Disney is expecting long lines for the ride that it has promoted internationally. The park for now will allow guests to line up until park closing time and then stay open an extra 2 1/2 hours for the Nemo ride only.\n\nActivity guides will be handed out so weary children can search for “Hidden Nemos” and play other games while waiting.\n\nIn Tomorrowland, Nemo-themed food, including cheddar fish crackers, will be available for hungry ride-goers.With spiral staircase entrances and a 40-person capacity per sub, loading is expected to take more time than other rides.\n\nBetween 1,000 and 1,100 people can ride an hour. Pirates of the Caribbean, for example, can take about three times as many riders hourly, according to Mouseplanet.com.\n\nBut the Nemo ride is second only to Pirates in the time spent on the ride itself – about 13 1/2 minutes, Rothschild said.\n\n‘NEMO’ PREVIEW\n\nThe start of the new ride feels similar to the original 1959 model with a meandering journey through coral reefs. Soon, the bubbles trickle up and the sub goes “deep,” staying inside the tunnel for about 10 or 11 minutes – longer than the interior part of the previous ride.\n\nThe captain announces that special hydrophones allow riders to hear the fish talk. Animated characters from the movie appear as if they are swimming through the water. A story line follows Nemo as he separates from his class, going on an adventure through a shipwreck, a field of jellyfish, volcano eruption and out through a whale’s blowhole.\n\nThe continuous story line repeats in a 60-second transition from the front window of one boat to the front window of the next, Rothschild said.\n\n“The opportunity to see something new and different every time you ride is quite rich,” he says."
