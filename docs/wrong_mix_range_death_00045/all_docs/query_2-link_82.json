        "text": "Twenty years ago, Waylon Jennings - along with wife Jessi Colter, Willie Nelson and Tompall Glaser - set Nashville on its ear with the release of \"Wanted! The Outlaws.\"\n\nNot only did the album become country music's first to sell 1 million copies and create a much-celebrated movement in a staid, mushy genre, but it allowed Jennings a platform from which to preach what he'd said all along when only a few were listening:Emperor Nashville wore no clothes.\n\nJennings' stinging, no-punches-pulled criticism of those on both sides of Music City microphones made him a true outlaw in the business.\n\n\"If I wasn't making them so much money, they'd have been really mad,\" he says with a deep chuckle, talking from his Nashville home in advance of his shows Sunday in Tempe.\n\nHowever, many years have passed since those angry days. His notorious, lengthy relationship with cocaine is old news. After his 1989 triple-bypass heart surgery, he even gave up his multipack-a-day cigarette habit. His party-hard lifestyle has long since yielded to the joys of family: Jessi and their 16-year-old son, Scooter, are the primary focus of his affections these days.\n\nA kinder, gentler Waylon Jennings? Yes . . . and no.\n\nThe man whose rich, storied musical history features a memorable spell as a bass-playing Cricket for Buddy Holly - it was Waylon who gave up his airplane seat for Holly the day the music died - simply will not, as an exasperated Nashville would prefer, go gentle into that good night.\n\n\"I'm writing songs, recording 'em and playing 'em just the way I want,\" Jennings says. \"And I say what I want. Let me tell you, that drives some folks around here a little bit crazy.\"\n\nActually, his different-drummer inclinations started long before the Outlaws came to be. Born in Lit-tle-field, Texas, in 1937, Jennings found an early fondness for folk music, then embraced rhythm and blues, and rockabilly.\n\nAfter Holly died, he hit the road, lighting eventually in Phoenix. He gained a modicum of regional fame playing in local nightclubs, and his \"chicken-pickin' \" guitar style eventually caught the ear of Chet Atkins, who signed him to RCA in 1965.\n\nIn 1968, his major-league breakthrough occurred in the form of a top-5 hit - the now-classic, signature \"Only Daddy That'll Walk the Line.\"\n\nBut war with his label was well under way.\n\n\"I'll never, never understand,\" he says with a deep sigh, \"how a guy with a degree in marketing is going to tell me how my music should be, how to run my business. It's something I could never adjust to.\"\n\nStill, the 1970s treated Waylon (and RCA) well, with such monster hits as 1972's \"Good-Hearted Woman,\" allowing him leverage with the RCA execs in matters of production. Hot-selling LPs like \"Lonesome, Orn'ry and Mean\" and \"Honky-Tonk Heroes\" paved the way to the \"legend\" status cemented with \"Wanted! The Outlaws.\" And the hits - \"Luck-en-bach, Texas (the Basics of Love)\" with longtime soulmate Willie Nelson, the stunning ballad \"Amanda,\" and \"Mammas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\" - rendered his 1979 \"Greatest Hits\" quadruple platinum (4 million sold).\n\nBut the '80s brought big changes in the music and the man. Rebellion fell from fashion, and the first wave of country crossover significantly de-twanged country - and completely discouraged Jennings.\n\n\"It came hard and fast,\" he recalls. \"I didn't know what hit me.\"\n\nThe drug use increased while record sales declined, and he produced little in the studio. While he continued to speak forthrightly about what was on his mind, fewer people paid attention, especially those at his label. RCA dropped him in 1985.\n\nJennings and family had retreated to his \"favorite place on Earth\" - Phoenix - about a year earlier, and it took that year for him to kick his $1,500-a-day coke habit. While freed from that yoke, RCA's actions and his heart woes closed out the '80s on a down note.\n\n\"That was one tough, mean decade,\" Jennings says softly.\n\nThis decade, however, has spawned a rebirth of sorts. He says he has been clean and sober since his Phoenix rehab (the ticker's fine, too). While a brief return to RCA produced an outstanding double-CD retrospective, he found he still could not abide by Nashville dictates.\n\n\"Lord, they never change,\" Jennings says. \"This town has the mentality of a monkey. They don't do anything for country music or the people. It's just to make money for themselves.\n\n\"You know, whatever I say will sound like sour grapes, but I haven't changed my tune. This is a dirty town, with plenty of illegal stuff happening all the time. Should I say the word `payola'? One day, someone's gonna start an investigation.\"\n\nSo, Waylon continues to be Waylon. Currently, he's working with the tiny Texas label Justice Records.\n\nAnd there's always the lure of the road.\n\n\"You know, I draw more than I ever did,\" he says. \"The other day I heard someone say, `Rediscover Waylon Jennings,' but I've never really been gone at all.\n\n\"And,\" he adds, a clear twinkle in his deep Southern drawl, \"though it might make 'em mad around (Nashville), I'm not gonna go away very easy.\""
