        "text": "A collection of never-released Waylon Jennings recordings will finally be heard September 2nd when The Lost Nashville Sessions hits stores. The album’s track list includes classics such as “Only Daddy That’ll Walk the Line,” “Singer of Sad Songs” and “Green River.” A few cover songs are thrown into the mix, as well, including Jennings’ take on Chuck Berry’s “Brown Eyed Handsome Man” and Kris Kristofferson’s “Sunday Morning Coming Down.” (The latter song was made famous by Johnny Cash, who just so happened to be Jennings’ roommate in the few years prior to Jennings’ recording of the melancholic ballad.)\n\nAll of The Lost Sessions‘ vocals were recorded in the summer of 1970 but were recently enhanced by Robby Turner, the late country legend’s longtime steel guitarist and producer. Turner, who now plays with Chris Stapleton, among other country greats, added background vocals to the project, along with new instrumentation.\n\nIn 1970, Waylon Jennings was already a Grammy winner (for his “MacArthur Park” collaboration with the Kimberlys) but nowhere near the pinnacle of his career. In fact, he hadn’t yet developed his signature Outlaw country sound that has since been emulated and idolized by legions of fans. So what you won’t hear on this album are classics like “Lonesome, On’ry and Mean” or “Luckenbach, Texas.” Instead, The Lost Nashville Sessions gives a history lesson to the Lone Star State native’s more rockabilly beginnings. It will be released on both CD and vinyl.\n\nWaylon Jennings: The Lost Nashville Sessions Track List:\n\nTrending"
