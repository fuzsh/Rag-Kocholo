        "text": "Nashville Rebel spans 36 years, from 1958 to 1994, and gives a disc to each of the four phases of Waylonâs career. The first covers Waylonâs â60s output, when he dressed in a suit and pompadour and was marketed as âThe Nashville Rebel.â Fans tend to dismiss this period, but there's proof here that he created some of the best music of â60s Nashville. Not only are âMental Revenge,â âOnly Daddy Thatâll Walk the Lineâ and âJust to Satisfy Youâ essential songs, they also feature superlative production and arrangements courtesy of Chet Atkins. The second and third discs cover Waylonâs â70s career, during which time he ignited the Outlaw movement, then turned it into a powerhouse brand. While disc two features the essential music surrounding 1973âs landmark Honky Tonk Heroes, disc three shows the introspective shift in Waylonâs music, which resulted in rich ballads like âThe Wurlitzer Prize.â The final disc covers the last phase of Jenningsâ recording career (excepting his exceptional 1998 comeback album, Closing In On the Fire), and brilliant songs like âRough and Rowdy Daysâ show that he never sold out and retained his good taste and powerful voice to very end."
