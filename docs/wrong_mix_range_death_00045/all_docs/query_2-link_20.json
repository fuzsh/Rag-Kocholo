        "text": "Some obituaries called Waylon Jennings’ death in 2002 at age 64 premature. But odds are that he should have been dead long before then.\n\nHe was scheduled to fly on the small plane that crashed and killed Buddy Holly, Richie Valens and J.P. “The Big Bopper\" Richardson on Feb. 3, 1959. However, he gave up his seat at the last minute to Richardson and agreed to take the bus.\n\nHolly, who had hired Jennings to play bass for the tour, joked with the fellow Texan that he hoped the tour bus stalled out. Jennings shot back that he hoped the plane crashed.\n\nHe was so guilt-ridden in the aftermath that he stopped performing for a while.\n\nYears later, Jennings developed a ferocious drug habit, snorting enough speed and cocaine to kill a herd of elephants before his 1977 arrest by federal agents and his subsequent decision to detox.\n\nDiabetes ultimately took his life; he had developed a voracious appetite for food after he gave up cocaine.\n\nYet through all of his travails, his music remained strong. He may have cast himself as a rebel and an outlaw but Jennings left a stellar recorded legacy.\n\nOn Tuesday, RCA/Nashville Legacy released “Nashville Rebel,\" a four-CD box set that spans his career in its 92 tracks.\n\nThere are many highlights, including a previously unreleased 1978 duet with Johnny Cash, his former roommate.\n\nThere are also duets with Jennings’ wife Jessi Colter; Anita Carter; fellow “outlaw\" Willie Nelson; and Hank Williams Jr.\n\nHit records are sprinkled liberally across the set. They include tracks like “Luckenbach, Texas,\" “Are You Ready for the Country?\" “Mamas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys\"; “Lovin’ Her Was Easier\"; and “Honkytonk Heroes.\"\n\nOf course, there’s the “Theme from the Dukes of Hazzard.\"\n\nIt’s fascinating to hear Jennings’ early recordings on the first disc, which probes his musical roots. On his 1957 recording of the classic Cajun tune “Jole Blon,\" which Holly produced, his mellow baritone already is in place, fully mature and just as compelling as it would be 30 years later.\n\nChet Atkins produced most of the other songs on the disc, which follows Jennings’ career through the 1960s. These were not happy years, personally or artistically, for Jennings. His first marriages went bust, leaving him hard up financially. He began popping amphetamines. And he found the “Nashville sound\" that Atkins helped forge was a musical straitjacket. The only bright spot was his marriage to Colter in 1969.\n\nStill, he cut some worthwhile and memorable tracks like “Only Daddy That’ll Walk the Line,\" which hit No. 2, and Chuck Berry’s “Brown Eyed Handsome Man,\" which charted at Number 3. He even managed to have some fun in the studio, as evidenced by a previously unreleased track from 1969, “People in Dallas Got Hair.\"\n\nBy the decade of the 1970s, chronicled on Discs 2 and 3, Jennings had gotten control of his musical career, winning artistic autonomy from a reluctant RCA. These discs offer tracks from his masterwork albums like “Ladies Love Outlaws,\" “Lonesome On’ry and Mean,\" “Honky Tony Heroes\" and “Are You Ready for the Country.\"\n\nThe music crackles with rural electricity.\n\nJennings’ 1977 hit with Willie Nelson, “Luckenbach Texas,\" was an era-defining No. 1 hit, and songs like “Good Hearted Woman\" and “Are You Sure Hank Done it This Way\" aren’t far behind.\n\nBut as Jennings’ star as a performer rose, he slipped deeper into addiction, developing a consuming cocaine habit. He sings about his arrest by federal officers on a track from 1978 titled “Don’t Y’all Think This Outlaw Bit’s Done Got Out Of Hand?\"\n\nThat was to prove to be Jennings’ theme song. He went into detox; and mostly for the sake of his young son, Shooter Jennings, he kicked his cocaine habit.\n\nThe final disc covers his last years. Though he wasn’t touring as often, the hits just kept on coming. He logged no fewer than 18 in the country Top 10, including four that got to Number One: “Just to Satisfy You,\" “Lucille,\" “Highwayman\" and “Rose in Paradise.\"\n\nBut the real highlights on Disc Four are Jennings’ cover of Los Lobos’ “Will the Wolf Survive?\"; a duet with Hank Williams Jr., “The Conversation,\" which conjures up the spirit of Hank Sr.; and “Storms Never Last,\" a compelling duet with Colter, who stuck by Jennings until the end.\n\nThe package includes a book with a knowledgeable essay by Lenny Kaye, a writer and former New York punk rocker who hooked up with Jennings on a tour in mid-1990s.\n\nTheirs may have been an unlikely collaboration but considering the wide range of people who Jennings’ music influenced -- from Kid Rock to Kenny Chesney to Metallica -- maybe it’s not so surprising.\n\nJennings lived a rough life yet his music was sharp, powerful, incisive, cutting across lines, boundaries and divisions. He called it outlaw. You can call it all-American.\n\nThe A-List of Southern Music\n\n1. Jerry Lee Lewis, “Last Man Standing\" (Art1st)\n\n2. Bobby Charles, “An Introduction to Bobby Charles\" (Fuel)\n\n3. Yusef Lateef, “Before Dawn\" (Universal/Verve)\n\n4. Dixie Hummingbirds, “Still Keeping it Real\" (MCG)\n\n5. My Morning Jacket, “Okonokos\" (RCA)"
