His mother passed away when Virgil was a small boy, and he and his brother Daniel, were raised by their grandparents, William Boling McCay and Arena Catherine Bell. Virgil remained with his grandparents for the most of his teenage life. When he was twenty two years of age, he and the lady of his choice, Miss Mornie Louisa Tidwell, we reunited in marriage on Nov 1, 1903 at Midlothan Texas. To this union were born three children, a girl Ruby, and two boys, Rena Jarrell, better known as Texas Kidd Jr and Grafton Nickum, better known as Texas Kidd. Virgil and his wife were born to be rodeo performers. Virgil was among the best hands in his day and the event that he excelled in was the saddle bronc riding contest. Virgil and Lou also taught their children to perform in all events, such as saddle bronc riding, bull riding, bareback bronc riding, and others. They taught them well and they were among the \"tophands\" of the western range. Texas Kidd Jr was among the best in saddle bronc riding and in his early career, he also rode bulls. On two occasions, 1940 and 1943, Texas Kidd Jr west as a performer and a participant to Madison quare Gardens World's Championship Rodeo in New York City. It was in the saddle bronc riding contest on the 13 of Oct 1940 that Texas Kidd Jr came out on that onery critter known as \"Jackson\" to delight and amuse the crowd at the Garden. Jr. competed against tophands from the Rio Grande to the Canadian border. To mention a few of the places, Dallas Texas, Denver, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, Fort Worth, Texas, and Cheyenne Wyoming. In the exhibitor shows, Ruby Nuckols was a performer in the cowgirls' bull riding, saddle bronc riding, and bareback riding events. It was the bull riding events that she gave the crowd a thrill. She would come out of the chute astride a bull, but, much to the delight of the fans, she would be facing backward instead of forward. Ruby states in her memoirs that it was easier to ride facing backwards because she could lock her legs around the bull's neck. Grafton, better known as Texas Kidd, has ridden more than his share of broncos. The events that he preferred were saddle bronc, bareback bronc, and bull riding. On the mantel over the fireplace in his home you will see some of the many trophies that he has won over the years. Among them is the Saddle Bronc Riding Championship Trophy, won at Carlsbad, New Mexico, in 1936. In the fron room hangs a huge picture of Grafton, peacefully mounted astride a beautiful paint. Many motion pictures of Texas Kidd taken while he was performing in rodeos throughout the west are to be found in his home. They, as well as the trophies, have been preserved by his wife, Irene Agnes Wallis, after the retirement of Virgil Nuckols, Grafton operated the Texas Kidd shows fron 1942 to 1947. It w as R.C.A. approved and they toured the entire states of Texas, Oklahoma and Louisianna.\n\nFor many years, Floy Estus Brazzell performed with the Texas Kidd Shows. She thrilled the spectators with her skillful rides in the saddle bronc and bull riding events. She was a quaret Cherikee Indian and a tophand, with or without the saddle. Virgil and Lou taught the in-laws the tricks of the trade and practically all the family participated in the show owned by Virgil and Lou and known as Texas Kidd Wild West Shows. They showed in many of the states, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisianna, Arkansas, Michigan, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois,\n\nDes Moines Iowa, Minneapolis, Minnesota and the length and breadth of Texas. Virgil Port Nuckols departed this life on the 20th of May 1946 on the same day a rodeo opened at Fort Worth Texas. Virgil's horse was saddled, and as he stood at attention in the center of the ring, the band played \"Empty Saddles\" in tribute to a champion who had gone on to the \"Great Round-up\".\n\n[DI26746] Fort Worth Star Telegram June 1945\n\nVirgil Nuckols, Pioneer Rodeo Producer Dies\n\nVrigil (Texas Kidd) Nuckols, 67, pioneer owner and producer of wild west r odeos, died at 3 p.m. Thursday at his residence after an illness of nine weeks. Mr Nuckols early in life became known around his native Grandview for his daring ability to ride the wildest horses and catle on his father 's farm. Young Virgil later became a professional bronc rider and won t op prize money at rodeos over the country. He later organized his own traveling roedo and added a carnival which played in 27 states. At one time there were more than 500 persons in the troupe. He is credited with giving m any now famous rodeo contestants their final chance. Thransportation difficulties during the war forced him to retire in 1942. He had operated a used car lot at 110 S Main ST since that time.
