Rosie was blessed with a stubbornness that would not allow her to be held back, coupled with a steadfast determination, strength and faith, which allowed her to defy the unwritten but well known restrictions placed on ‘colored’ folks in South Texas. Those traits would prove paramount as she survived a marriage where her physical well being was in constant peril and yet she endured. She chose to sacrifice her happiness in order for her son, Marlon, to have the chance to see the world and have the seeds of possibility planted inside him. Rosie’s wishes came to fruition as they traveled extensively from various places in Europe, Washington State, South Carolina and eventually back to South Texas, where Rosie’s marriage met its long overdue demise. She met Larry, the love of her life in Refugio, where they married and soon after moved to Corpus Christi, Tx. They found a church home at the Corpus Christi Christian Fellowship (CCCFellowship) and in true ‘never too old’ fashion she learned how to make sushi and embarked on a career path, special thanks to James and his wife for embracing, encouraging and teaching her! It would be years later, at a time her son and daughter-in-law were in the midst of marital strife, when Rosie offered to take her eldest granddaughter, Morgen into her home. What was meant to be a temporary solution, ended up being Rosie’s second opportunity to nurture a child in need of love and guidance, but this time with a supportive husband and under different circumstances.The decision by her son to allow Morgen to stay was a selfless act based on who was in the best position to provide much needed stability in a faith filled environment. Rosie with Larry by her side stepped into this role with the grace befitting her tenured journey through countless challenges. Rosie went home to her Lord and Savior on 8/27/21 and truth be told, the family thought about reaching out to her Trusted & Loved Pastor Don and Sister Marva Leavell to discuss and plan a funeral service…but the clarity of her words rang in their ears as she had expressed her viewpoint in the forthright manner that was her trademark: “I do not want to have any type of service when I pass. If people did not reach out and stay in touch, break bread with me and at the very least call me from time to time to see how I was doing, I’d prefer they not come and pretend I meant so much to them after I am no longer here.” That was Rosie to a ’T,’ and although her wishes are being honored, it bears stating that the lack of a service is in no way meant to disparage those who cared about, loved and cherished her. Rosie Westervelt is survived by her son, Marlon, her grandchildren, Morgen, Tyler, Skylar and 4 beloved great grandchildren.

Rodney won many rounds of golf and collected checks on many Saturdays from his unsuspecting golf buddies but lost the one round that mattered most to his archrival Cancer. Rodney was one of the hardest working individuals you ever met. Any task could be fixed, repaired, or conquered with a little bit of elbow grease. Rodney was the king of DIY. Not only was he the king of DIY, but he could also do it with what ever he had lying around. It wasn’t always pretty but was effective. When Rodney decided to stop Trucking after 11 years, he Joined the US Army completing BT in San Antonio where he met the love of his life - Judy. Rodney completed 13 years of dedicated military service in the Army Reserves, but not before taking Judy as his bride. After years of working and dedicated Military Service Rodney and Judy decided to conquer the world of education. The two decided to attend college together for two reasons: 1. To help one another and 2. Ensure they each finished and walked the stage together. More elbow grease got the two across the stage. For the next 16 years Rodney educated 1,000’s of San Antonio’s youth teaching middle school science. Rodney had a fondness for teaching today’s youth and tomorrows future leaders. When Rodney wasn’t Teaching, Trucking, Golfing or Working on Cars, his other favorite past time was putting his cicerone skills to use with his wife Judy, swinging the evening away while karaokeing to Waylon Jennings, Hank Jr, or if Beach Day was close – Jimmy Buffet. Rodney enjoyed being home most and taking time to enjoy the small things in life he had worked so hard to build. Some say he enjoyed it more when family was around. Rodney Hendrickson; son of Ellen Osbourne and Walter Hendrickson (Deceased), leaves behind his Loving Wife Judy Hendrickson, three children Rodney, Shannon, and Kristie. His four Grandchildren Allania, Darren, Jaelyn, and Alyssa. And last, but certainly not least, his five beloved cats, Momma, Boo, Princess, Mishap, and Peewee.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nRobert Guerra Villalpando Senior - January 19, 1951 - August 16, 2021\n\nDeparted: 08/16/2021 (San Antonio)\n\nObituary Preview: Every once in a while the world loses a soul that makes us ALL the lesser for it. Robert G. Villalpando has been called home to be with our Father in heaven. There truly is so much good to say about this kind soul and the life he led. Our Dear God graced us with him on Jan 19, 1951 in Austin, Tx and called him home on Aug 16, 2021 in San Antonio, Tx. Though he was raised in the Westside of San Antonio the tough environment only made his passion for the love of life stronger and he never lost faith in the goodness of humanity. At the age of 17 and an upcoming Senior Robert found himself drafted into the U.S Army as a Combat Medic. Luckily he was blessed to train in San Antonio but upon the completion of his military training he moved on to a tour in Germany. Always sharing his adventures from the Military it was easy to see how he felt about his service to country. He was nothing short of proud and many times had stated that if it wasn't for his parents needing help at home the Military would've been his career. From his beginning to his end Robert always put others before his own needs. One incident which seemed to always tug at his heart involved helping a comrade in dire need. One morning he said a Soldier had just returned from Vietnam and was attempting to jump off a building but Spc Villalpando without a second thought climbed the building also and after 3 hours, was able to coax the Soldier off the roof simply with words of compassion and understanding. Because of Roberts selfless actions this Soldier was graced with more life to live. This incredible selfless feat made it's way to Europe's Commanding General. The fable sounding story had Europe's General curious and within a couple of days Robert was standing in front of the most highest ranking military officer in Europe and was handed a coin and a Certificate of Appreciation by Europe's Commanding General and the United States Army. He was proud of this story and told it each time with a sense accomplishment, his eyes lighting up each time he told it one more time. This was who Robert was though. Always placing others first and his greatest gift to others was HE NEVER EXPECTED ANYTHING IN RETURN from anyone. Their satisfaction and happiness was his reward. After his service he went on to trade school to learn the art of Carpet Laying. One thing about Robert was whenever he did anything he always made sure he did it right the first time. His awesome work ethic made his name known in all of South Texas. His work standard was of the highest caliber and he made it a point that he himself would finish any job he or his partners started under his name. I'd call him a sure case of OCD. He was nearly a perfectionist when it came to his work which also pushed him to become smarter, stronger and in turn filled him with a humbleness towards life. His hands have left an imprint on many establishments and homes inTexas but yet it will be his positive spirit, kind heart, compassion for others and his faith in God that will forever be imprinted and evident in the many lives he dared to touch. Yes he is gone but he will not be easily forgotten by all who were blessed to know him. His legacy will literally speak for itself. Robert was an incredibly simple, humbled kind man. He longed only TO BE HAPPY. He knew Gods love because he had been saved and reborn. He understood the power of prayer and always heeded the call of those in need. A strong man of God with a smile, positive words and an attitude that was always willing to help even if it meant he had nothing left to give. Believe me when I say he would still find a way to help. The world lost such a good person and though God felt it was time for him to return home the memory of love, kindness and charity left behind by Robert G. Villapando will be in the hearts, souls and lives that were blessed to know him and in those he touched daily through his living years. Our dad wasn't a president, a king or some prominent rich man but in spite of that OUR DAD WAS A GREAT MAN...OUR DAD WAS OUR HERO!! Robert is survived by his loving wife, Rosario E. Villalpando; his four daughters, Cynthia A. Garza, Monica G. Weber, Gina M. Villalpando, and Priscilla D. Villalpando; his grandchildren Maricella G. Marrero, Franchesca C. Garza, Joseph A. Jiminez, Jacob N. Jiminez, Justine M. Jiminez, Mathew W. Weber, Robert Villalpando Jr., Robert A. Villalpando Jr., Genesis M. Garcia, Gavin J. Villalpando Garcia, Ariel E. Flores, Alisa Ann Marie Flores, Abraham G. Flores, and Adam Flores Jr.; his sister, Grace Villalpando, and his niece, Roxanne Reyes. He was preceded in death by his parents; his brother, Gilbert Villalpando; and his son, Robert Villalpando Jr.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nWilliam Albert Ohler - July 11, 1944 - August 15, 2021\n\nDeparted: 08/15/2021 (San Antonio)\n\nObituary Preview: No description available\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nCelia Garcia - November 24, 1946 - August 12, 2021\n\nDeparted: 08/12/2021 (San Antonio)\n\nObituary Preview: Our beloved, Celia Garcia, was taken to her Heavenly home to be at the side of her Savior Jesus Christ on Thursday, August 12, 2021 at the age of 74.
