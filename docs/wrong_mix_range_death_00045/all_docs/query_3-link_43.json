        "text": "Waylon Jennings, a leading figure in US country music, has died aged 64. He passed away at his home in Arizona.\n\nJennings had battled against ill health for some time. He had his left foot amputated late last year due to diabetic problems after undergoing triple bypass surgery in 1998, and a further operation for vascular disorder last year.\n\nIn a career that spanned five decades, Waylon Jennings recorded 60 albums, enjoying 16 number one songs and collaborating with the likes of Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Buddy Holly. He sold more than 40m records worldwide.\n\nJennings met Holly in Lubbock, Texas in 1955 where he was working at a local radio station. Holly produced his first album and invited him on tour to play the bass guitar in his band.\n\nIt was while touring the midwest with Holly in 1959 that Jennings narrowly escaped death, having given up his place on the light aircraft that crashed and killed his friend.\n\nBorn in 1937 in Littlefield, Texas, Jennings was heavily influenced by the blues music of Jimmie Rodgers and BB King, and got his first job in the music industry as a radio DJ at the age of 12.\n\nIn 1963, Jennings formed his own band and was later signed to RCA records by Chet Atkins. His ensuing success with albums such as Leavin' Town and Nashville Rebel, both released in 1966, established Jennings's place in country music. In 1970 he contributed to the soundtrack of Ned Kelly, the film starring Mick Jagger.\n\nNever one to fit into the Nashville hit-factory mould, Jennings produced his own music, hired his own musicians and, along with Willie Nelson, helped create the 1970's \"outlaw\" movement. Albums such as Ladies Love Outlaws (1972) and the record-breaking Wanted! The Outlaws (1976), which became country's first platinum-selling album, confirmed Jennings as an innovator.\n\nJennings wrote the theme tune and song to The Dukes of Hazzard, while his wizened mountain prophet in Married with Children gave him further small screen exposure. Other acting contributions came in the Sesame Street film, Follow That Bird, and Mel Gibson's Maverick.\n\nDuring his career Waylon Jennings was awarded two Grammies and four Country Music Association awards though he was known to shun ceremonies preferring to play music rather than receive awards for it. Jennings was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October 2001, but was unable to attend the ceremony due to illness."
