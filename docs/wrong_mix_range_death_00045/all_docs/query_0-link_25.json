McBride - September 04, 1962 - February 16, 2023\n\nDeparted: 02/16/2023 (Cayuga)\n\nObituary Preview: Mark Brenton McBride, 60, of Dana, IN, went to be with our Lord and Savior on February 16, 2023, after a 2 year long battle with Gilliam-Barre Syndrome. Mark was born on September 4, 1962, in Danville, Illinois to the late Leonard Roe and Janice Elaine (Fortner) McBride. He graduated from North Vermillion High School in 1981. Mark married his beloved wife, Mary Jane (Huffman) McBride (surviving) on February 26, 2000, at Old Union Church of Christ and they shared 5 children. God called Mark to become an emergency foster dad for 4 years from 2019 until he passed and he cared and loved 95 children in that capacity. Mark was also very close with his 23 nieces and nephews. Mark was a lifelong member of Cayuga Christian Church. He studied music at Indiana State University. He was a gifted trumpet, baritone and piano player. Mark cherished his time volunteering with the North Vermillion marching band with friend Doug Finley. After Indiana State, Mark graduated from nursing school and worked as a licensed practical nurse for several years. Following that he joined McDonalds, eventually becoming a store manager until he was disabled in 2003. His greatest pleasure was training new employees for the work force.
