Dedicated to: My Mother, Mary Marie Spitzer Chatham Spitzer Descendants of Hans Bartholomeaus Spitzer SOME INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT THE EARLY SPITZER FAMILY Johann Heinrich Spitzer was bom in the Wachau Region of lower Austria, along the Danube River, a few miles west of Vienna. Spitzer was originally a family of noble knights dating back to Baron Hadmar Von Spitzer 1322. Johann brought with him from Germany a small hand-made loom, used in making lace and insertion for ladies bonnets. Mrs. Weldon Myers of Virginia still has the loom. Phillip Spitzer, son of Johann Spitzer, married Eva Holsinger of Virginia, whose father Michael Holsinger, purchased land in the Shenandoah Valley, in 1773. Michael Holsinger had little knowledge of agriculture, and paid very little attention to farming, and allow the land to fall into a very rude state. His residence for a long time was a miserable cabin, and there were no other buildings of value. When he chose to labor it was in basket making and flax breaking. The only property he owned was the land and two indifferent horses, two cows, two heifers, and a few sheep and hogs. His few farming utensils were of a wretched description and his household furniture scanty and miserable. There is not a chair, cupboard or chest in the house, and the plates and dishes were of earthen and pewter. On the 7tii of March, 1800, Michael Holsinger made an arrangement with such of his sons that had attained full age, by which he would be relieved from the cultivation and management of the land, and at the same time provisions would be made for the maintenance of himself and wife during his life, and for her maintenance after his death. The three older sons would have title to the land and they in turn would pay the remaining brothers and sisters 50 pounds each. The Holsinger house (log) had a secret cellar and secret underground passage to a spring escape hatch if penned in by Indians. The wall was very thick with small windows. Several springs, the ones that supply Michael M. Barber with water, still flow proftisely with cool bubbling water. Now by means of tank trucks, water from the springs is supplied to numerous homes in the valley by Robert Holsinger, son of Carlson and Vada, and the seventh generation to live on this place. Michael Holsinger served in the Revolutionary War, from Augusta County 1776-1 778, under Capt. Ruben Harrison. Then Rockingham County was formed in 1 778, and he served under Joseph Harrison. Three stars appear after his name on the muster roll in 1778. The meaning of the stars is not known.

His son, Cosmus and his grandson, Berlin, earned on the ti-ade. The whole chair was made and put together without pins or pegs or nails. Hickory was used for the whole chair, rungs and all. The wood was cut allowed to dry a certain length of time and then holes were bored and rungs put into them. When they dried, you could not pull them apart and today after 1 00 years, old chairs will not come apart. They were single splint bottom chairs and some of the original chairs are still in use.

At the breaking out of the civil war he joined the militia at Richmond, then enlisted in the regular service of the Fourth Missouri, and participated in a number of the most important engagements of the four year struggle. At the close of the war he returned to his Ray County home and in the fall was married to Harriett Rader. Mr. Spitzer is numbered among the country's most industrious and successful farmers and his friends are legion. In politics he is a Republican. Mr. Spitzer has owned several farms in Ray County. Later in life Eli and Harriett moved to Colorado. This was probably after or during the same time that his sons Sylvester and Luther filed on a homestead West of Wiley, Colorado.

Johann Henrich Spitzer bought himself free from servitude, has paid his emigration fee to America and disposed of his possession. He and his family are leav ing for the new world. One German historian told us that Germany was made up at that time of .several principalities and that the Mayor of Burgemaster. whiche\\er the head of the principality was called was paid a fee (tax) and that this was what Henry appears to have paid along with his emigration fee before he and his family left for America (Source: State Archi\\es at Karlsruhe.

Johann Heinrich Spitzer and his family arrived at Philadelphia, PA from Rotterdam, Holland, on the \"Brittania.\" Johann Heinrich and Johann .A.ndreas Spitzer were listed on the passenger list arriving in Philadelphia 26 Sep 1764.

Some of the family later migrated to Shenandoah County and Rockingham County. VA. Records of the 1st Reformed Church in Lancaster, PA indicated Henry Spitzer died there on 21 Apr 1793, aged 79 yrs, 1 1 mo. 7 days which made him bom 14 May 1713/14 in Germany.

Heinrich and Catherine Spitzer were sponsors to the children of John George Schoeppel and wife. Susanna Maria. Cathrine's name was Catherine Maria and part of the time she is shown as grandmother which leads one to believe that Susannah Maria Schoeppel was a Spitzer.

Notes for Joel Spitzer: The Bowman family records have them moving to Missouri immediately after their marriage in 1828. But according to the 1850 Census the family is still living in Rockingham.

VA until June 18. 1849. when they sold their land to Abram Hoover and then move to Ray County, MO the following year would be 1850. They settled 3 miles north of Morton, MO. -Harry Spitzer book on Spitzer \"Migrations to Missouri\" \"Our records show that the Joel Spitzer family, members of the Van Trump family. William C. Rader, and Harvey Showalter also were listed in the 1860 Ray County census. These families clearly arrived in the same time period as the above-mentioned families, perhaps even earlier. Joel Spitzer and John C. Van Trumpwere in Crooked River TWP. William C. Rader. Josiah Van Trump, and Harvey Showalter (living with David Bowman) were in Grape Grove TWP. We note that Harvey Showalter, age 21 in the 1860 census, was the nephew of Ann Showalter, wife of David B. Bowman. Also. William C. Rader was age 25, and we have evidence that his old brother John H. Rader was in Ray County in 1863. They may have arrived together.
