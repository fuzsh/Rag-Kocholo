        "text": "The themes are dark, there are few laughs. Gilles Jacob has mustered a selection of 22 potent and controversial films for the last Cannes festival of the 1900s. Rarely has there been a roster with such potential for scandal in the competition — pedophilia, incest, suicide — treated in a manner that Jacob, the festival's director, calls resolutely modern, with directors who \"innovate forms and ways of questioning today's world.\"\n\nThe 52d Cannes International Film Festival (May 12-23) promises to knock the socks off the black-tie audiences that climb red-carpeted stairs to the 2,400-seat Palais des Festivals — seats that can snap back in anger if the occupants don't like what they see on screen.\n\nFew festivals are as high risk as Cannes, and this edition features a host of first-timers in the Official Selection. Those tightly guarded Palais steps, lined with cameras, doused with floodlights, could resemble a war zone. Directors, flanked by their actors and crews, prepared to \"defend\" their newborn creations, might do well to wear crash helmets with their tuxedos. And it's a notoriously non-tux batch this year (some press agents are tucking extra bow ties into their pockets, just in case), made up of newcomers and prodigal sons.\n\nJacob notes the profusion of films on families in which \"emotion has replaced ultra violence.\" The families may be far-flung and disjointed, as in Pedro Almodovar's disconcerting, at times hilarious \"Todo Sobre Mi Madre,\" (All About My Mother), a gender-bending tragicomedy — Mom's straight, Dad's a drag queen. The film stars Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes and Antonia San Juan. Leos Carax's \"Pola X,\" the competition opener, adapted from Herman Melville's \"Pierre, or The Ambiguities,\" may disconcert differently: Pierre, who has lavish gifts — he is handsome, talented, rich — is lured from pastoral innocence to the lower depths by a strange, wild girl who says she is a lost sister. Catherine Deneuve, Guillaume Depardieu and Katerina Golubeva head the cast."
