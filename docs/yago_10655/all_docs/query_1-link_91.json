Best Friends Forever\n\nDirected by Owen Andrejco, USA, Animation, 2:50, Brooklyn Premiere\n\nA psychotic New York City subway dwelling rat, “Rat”, and his empty headed crocodilian best friend, “Croc”, prepare for a vindictive journey of revenge before shenanigans ensue.\n\nNalb Noum\n\nDirected by Xzaviah J.

Created for Things Took A Turn, an animation anthology that challenges artists of marginalized genders to create new animated short stories by twisting familiar narratives.\n\nA Tree Once Grew Here\n\nDirected by Johnnie Semerad, USA, Animation, 6:59\n\n“A Tree Once Grew Here” combines captivating visuals, animation, and imagery, to tell a tale that transcends language. We are reminded that we must rebalance harmony and nurture our planet; because we can no longer afford not to.\n\nSürgünlik (Exile)\n\nDirected by Jeremiah Dickey, USA, Animation, 2:15\n\nThis animated excerpt from documentary “Jamala: Songs of Freedom” illustrates the plight of a single mother and her children during the Soviet purge of Crimean Tatars at the end of WW2.
