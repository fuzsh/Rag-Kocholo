        "text": "Iranian actress Marzieh Vafamehr has been released from prison without suffering the additionally decreed punishment of 90 lashes for her role in the Australian film My Tehran For Sale.\n\nAn Iranian appeal court reduced her imprisonment to three months and overturned the flogging sentence on Monday night.The charges related to her appearance in one scene without the mandatory head covering which women in Iran are required to wear and appearing to drink alcohol in another scene, a point her husband Nasser Taghavi denies.\n\n“As filmmakers we believe in freedom of speech and support all artists who are imprisoned and punished in Iran for expressing themselves through their art. We admire their courage and the contribution they make to sharing with the world their truth about life for Iranian people,” said Kate Croser and Julie Ryan of Cyan Films and producers of My Tehran for Sale.\n\nThe Cyan Films-produced feature was banned in Iran.\n\nIn the past few weeks a Tehran appeals court upheld the six-year jail sentence and 20-year filmmaking and travel ban against director Jafar Panahi. Director Mohammad Rasoulof, who was also sentenced to a lengthy prison term with Panahi in December 2010, had his sentence reduced to one year in prison.\n\nIn the past few weeks a Tehran appeals court upheld the six-year jail sentence and 20-year filmmaking and travel ban against Jafar Panahi.
