        "text": "Fakhri Khorvash, an actress known for Sooteh-Delan (1978), Aqaye Hallou (1971) and Matarsak (1984), says Nasser Taghvai is one of the most independent and influential directors in Iran. In her words, \"Taghvai never bows to the outside pressures. Even if it’s just a small part, I would love to play in his movies.\"\n\nThe movie industry is in constant flux with new actors and actresses. One day they're famous the next day they're not. The movie industry is becoming so oversaturated in Iran too, but not for a veteran actress like Khorvash. After almost five decades playing on the screen, stage and Television, she still has some pulling-power. For whatever reason, her star refuses to fade away.\n\nKhorvash was born in Kermanshah. She finished high school at 16 and entered collage to pursue her dream of becoming a doctor. She was working as a teacher when she was chosen by the Bachelor Society to act in a play. Her outstanding performance brought her offers to participate in other plays. Since then, she has appeared in many films and collaborated with well-known names such as Jamshid Mashayekhi, Ezzatollah Entezami, Jamileh Sheikhi, Rokneddin Khosravi, Jafar Vaali, and Abbas Javanmard to bring different plays to life on the small or big screen. She has starred in a number of television series like Imam Ali; most notably was her portrayal of Mahd Olya in the period drama Amir Kabir.\n\nFor seven years though, Khorvash has been living in the United States with her children. Here is a quick chat with the legendary star herself:\n\nAs a young girl you did dream of becoming a doctor. What happened?\n\nBefore getting into cinema I wanted to become a doctor. I even went to college for it. But then I decided to teach. I went on the stage for the Bachelor Society. Doctor Vala who was in charge of the society picked me for a play and that’s how I began my stage life for the first time. I had no idea about acting and he taught me everything in four months. I suffered from stage fright but he helped me go through it. My first play was Dirty Hands (1948) by Jean-Paul Sartre. It was an instant hit. After that, Doctor Vala convinced me to try my luck on the silver screen.\n\nWhat about your parents? Were they fine with your new career move?\n\nAt that time successful actresses like Loretta and Irene had paved the way for other women to follow their dreams on the silver screen. Despite that, when I began to work in cinema my parents objected. For this, I couldn’t see them for 9 years. It was only after my father got sick and hospitalized that he let me see him again.\n\nYou have worked with some of the most successful directors in the movie industry. Which one would you prefer to work with again?\n\nI have great memories from Abbas Javanmard. I’ll never forget his plays Badsam and Golden City, in which I played against author Mahmoud Dolatabadi. Hamid Samandarian was equally great. Rokneddin Khosravi was another director with several major hits. Mr. and Mrs. Oskouei were great too. I watched Mrs. Oskouei’s play Otello and loved it. They were both graduates from the University of Moscow. I found that out when I visited the place in those early years.\n\nI have worked with many directors in cinema but for me Nasser Taghvai is different. If I get the chance I would love to work with him once again, even if it’s just a small part. He is an independent director, never influenced by others, never bowing to outside pressures.\n\nWhat about actors?\n\nWe have many great actors too. They include Ezzatollah Entezami, Davoud Rashidi, and Jamshid Mashayekhi, among others. I cannot say which one is the greatest. They are all theatrically oriented, they are all great.\n\nYou also travel to the United States. Tell us more about your new life.\n\nI go there every year to see my kids. I broke my leg twice last time and had to stay there to have it fixed. I suffered from depression during that period as I couldn’t return to Iran. Several people have approached me to write my biography. I have finished my childhood and school years. I want to get it done at the earliest.\n\nAny words for aspiring actors and actresses?"
