        "text": "The Hired Hand\n\nRating: *****\n\nDir: Peter Fonda With: Peter Fonda, Warren Oates, Verna Bloom, Robert Pratt, Severn Darden 90 mins, cert 12\n\nThis loving restoration of Peter Fonda's 1971 Western, supervised by Hamish McAlpine and its original editor Frank Mazzola, will surely come to seen as a lean, spare classic of the genre: an intimate chamber work to treasure along with the big orchestral pieces. Fonda directs, and plays Harry, a drifter who roams from town to town with his buddy Arch, played by Warren Oates, an actor whose rugged presence - dishevelled, rangy, grinning and grimacing with tombstone teeth - underwrites the movie's Western authenticity on its own. Harry decides to give up the rambling life and return to the wife he abandoned years before (a terrifically tough performance from Verna Bloom) and penitentially work as a hired hand on her farmstead. But he gets caught in a conflict of loyalties to his wife and his deserted friend.\n\nIt is a profoundly strange and disturbing film, beginning with the discovery of a dead child in a river: a bad augury which hangs over the rest of the movie, to be resolved with violence at the end. The Hired Hand resonates in the mind long after the film is finished, an effect which is partly due to Mazzola's slow, drawn-out fades and dissolves: a bit laboured for my taste, but certainly distinctive. And there is an added, eerie poignancy in the fact that while Oates died cruelly early at the age of 53, Peter Fonda is not only still with us, enjoying a restoration in his fortunes with the well-regarded Ulee's Gold, but also, particularly in The Limey, looking astonishingly good: better, perhaps than he did in 1971. This movie can only help in the revival of Fonda's stock price; it is a discreet classic: American cinema in a minor key.\n\nLovely Rita\n\nRating: ***\n\nDir: Jessica Hausner With: Barbara Osika, Christoph Bauer, Petr Fiala, Wolfgang Kostal, Karina Brandlmayer 79 mins, cert 15\n\nWith her debut feature, 29-year-old Jessica Hausner has become, like Michael Haneke and Ulrich Seidl, a director intent on finding a secret theatre of horror behind the rituals of gemutlich middle-class family life in Austria. Like them, she is adept at isolating shocking acts, immersing them in a kind of acid bath, inducing their detachment from what might normally be thought of as psychological, social or moral contexts - and all three considerations really do look very quaint - foregrounding a fiercely hard, deadpan action.\n\nHere, Hausner works with non-professionals, eliciting blank, reticent performances which certainly evoke the ordinariness of real life. Rita (Barbara Osika) is a moody, troubled teenager rebelling against her parents in a torpid, dumb-insolent way, rowing with them over such intensely embarrassing things as leaving the lavatory seat up. At school, she bunks off and deliberately screws up the sixth-form play. She attempts to seduce a much younger boy, and then gets off with a bus driver. She's a mess - and yet it doesn't seem to be leading anywhere: many are the listless, directionless scenes in class, at home, on the street. But something is coming, and that something can't be good: recent movies have taught us to break into a Pavlovian cold sweat at any polite family scene with everyone speaking Austrian-accented German.\n\nOddly, until this film was almost over, it looked like was going to be a Haneke film without the horror, and at the exact moment I thought this - it became a Haneke film with the horror. But derivative or not, Hausner's film differs from Haneke in calmly delaying the grisliness until the end: this gives a clearer sense of the banality and sheer boredom which causes despair and violence. This is hardly the \"moral\" of the film, though: it's too cool and blank for that. The point is not motive, it isn't the elucidation of the human mind; it is more the simple juxtaposition of horror and bourgeois normality as a kind of Neurotic Realist motif: sinister, enigmatic, disquieting.\n\nThe Day I Became a Woman\n\nRating: ****\n\nDir: Marzieh Meshkini With: Fatemeh Cherag Akhar, Hassan Nebhan, Shahr Banou Sisizadeh, Ameneh Passand 78 mins, cert U\n\nThis arresting mini-trilogy is set on Kish Island in Iran, and so very much resembles another tripartite Iranian film from 1999, Tales from Kish, directed by Abolfazl Jalili, Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Naser Taghvai. Director Marzieh Meshkini served as Makhmalbaf's assistant on The Door, his segment from that movie; her feature debut is written by Makhmalbaf and has the same mysterious quality, combining a playful sweetness with desperate sadness.\n\nThe first part shows a little girl, Hava, on her ninth birthday, longing to play with a little boy but forced to wear the chador and retreat into enforced modesty, as this is the day she has become a woman.\n\nThe next section is an all-female bicycle race: young women in chadors are pedalling madly through the desert scrub - a brilliant visual image, like the teachers with their boards in Samira Makhmalbaf's Blackboards or the desert wedding party in Kandahar. But the woman in pole position, Ahoo, is distracted by her husband who gallops beside her on a horse, demanding she abandon her cycling dreams and then divorcing her, then and there, on the hoof. And the final scene shows a very old woman being wheeled around Kish's tourist shopping mall, buying all the luxuries she was denied in her life. The movie returns to the beach where the three strands tie up - and the beach is a location to strip mankind, and womankind, bare.\n\nMeshkini very much shows the Makhmalbaf house style, but demonstrates a light, personal touch. Her movie has a dreamy surreality which is yet firmly grounded in the waking world as well as an urgent advocacy of women's rights which has not been considered fashionable or relevant in European or Anglophone cinema for many years.\n\nBeauty and the Beast - Imax Edition\n\nRating: ***\n\nDir: Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise With: Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, Angela Lansbury 84 mins, cert U\n\nThis is the much-loved 1991 Disney cartoon, pumped up to the size of the Imax screen - an enlargement that adds a sense of occasion to this animated favourite, but exposes the blank spots in the design.\n\nChildren are now rapidly acclimatising to the kind of technical strides made by the Toy Stories, Shrek and Pixar's forthcoming Monsters Inc, so the relative simplicity and charm of Beauty and the Beast are possibly better served in a smaller frame. (At any rate, with this, as with other IMAX presentations, if you don't want to be overwhelmed by the sheer size, sit well to the back of the auditorium.) This gigantic canvas discloses a grainy quality to the background colours and on the huge screen you notice utterly immobile supporting characters - frozen while the principals swirl around in transports of energy and action - looking as inert as storybook illustrations.\n\nThat said, there's enough wit and ingenuity in Roger Allers's story and Howard Ashman and Alan Menken's songs to give the CGI whizzkids a run for their money. I loved the architectural tour that poor imprisoned Beauty is given, showing all the points of interest in the Beast's castle; \"That ceiling's baroque! And I always say - if it ain't baroque, don't fix it!\""
