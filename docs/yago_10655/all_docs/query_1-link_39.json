        "text": "TAD’S EMERGING WORLD: GLEN CANYON EXPOSED – TRAILER\n\nThis film is about a conservation photographer, Dawn Kish, documenting the hidden treasure of the Southwest known as Glen Canyon. This epic landscape of red sandstone walls, flowing rivers and cultural sites is under a giant reservoir called Lake Powell. The lake is at its lowest water level since the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam in 1963. Kish is going on an adventure to explore this canyon she never knew with an old Crown Graphic 4×5 camera. This camera documented Glen Canyon pre-dam from an incredible photographer, Tad Nichols, from 1950-1963. What is emerging? What will be learned? What is preserved? What will develop? Glen Canyon’s destiny is still unknown.\n\nCAN’T BEAT THIS PLACE FOR FUN\n\n“Can’t Beat This Place For Fun” takes you into the work (and play!) shop of Flagstaff, Arizona’s Fretwater Boatworks as they keep the tradition of wooden boat building alive. Embodying the legacy of famed river runner and ardent conservationist Martin Litton, the Fretwater team will show you how, in Litton’s own words, “Win or lose, there’s a measure of victory in the endeavor.” Come along and join the fun!\n\nDirector/Camera: Dawn Kish, Camera/Editor: Jake Hewitt, Producer: John Tveten, Starring: Brad Dimock, Amy “Cricket” Rust and Pat Clark.\n\nTHE CLOSER YOU GET\n\nGet closer to your public lands and learn more about the surrounding areas of our most beloved Grand Canyon. These beautiful diverse lands are in need of our protection to preserve ancient forests and ban new uranium mining claims. Find out more information check out the proposed Greater Grand Canyon Heritage National Monument at GreaterGrandCanyon.org or GrandCanyonWildlands.org Special Thanks to SHEL for the lovely music.\n\nOLD MAN LIGHTNING – THE BIG TEASER\n\nCranky, yet witty bouldering legend John “Verm” Sherman has lost his mojo and is jonesing to regain it. What better way than to climb the world’s most famous boulder problem, Yosemite’s iconic Midnight Lightning? He climbed it 25 years ago, but since then the climb has gotten harder and Verm’s gotten softer due to beerlust and a third-degree burning passion for bird photography. Standing in his way is his age (57), weight (200 lbs), dozens of injuries, and myriad health issues. Nevertheless, he’s stubborn and determined. Verm needs to save condors from extinction, and if leveraging his climbing celebrity will help, he’ll stop at nothing. Verm enlists the assistance of Ryan “Meatball” Whited, a cheerfully sadistic personal trainer and musculoskeletal guru. A 6-month mission to whip Verm back into shape ensues, leading to a final confrontation with bouldering’s “Problem of Problems”.\n\nPUSHING BACK\n\nThis film inspires all who have had an accident and know how difficult it is to come back. Alyse Dietel fell off a cliff and shattered her body. The doctors told her she would probably never walk again, this included her passion, rock climbing. Her broken body was a vessel of constant pain but with a strong mind and her art to keep company, she pushed back the wheel chair and now is climbing harder than ever. Alyse is now an inspiration and a force to be recon with. She just was on the cover of Rock and Ice Magazine, achieved pro sponsorships and climbs 5.13 trad. A true inspiration.\n\nWUPATKI TRAIL CREW – HARD AT WORK\n\nNational Park Foundation supports many projects that the federal budgets cannot with private funds. NPS has me documenting some of their 100+ approved grants. This project is in my back yard at Wupatki National Monument with their trail crew and the American Conservation Experience. They are rebuilding trails to improve the old trails but also add handicap access as well.\n\nA GLIMPSE OF THE DINÉ\n\nThis film documents a little glimpse of the Dinè People (AKA Navajo) and their culture at the Western Navajo Fair in Tuba City, Arizona. It’s purpose is to connect the old and new traditions and tell their stories through their eyes. I would like to dedicate this film to my mentor and great friend John Running. If it weren’t for him I would have not known the beautiful ways of the Dinè. Thank you to all in front and behind the lens for making this beautiful work with me. Ahe’hee’"
