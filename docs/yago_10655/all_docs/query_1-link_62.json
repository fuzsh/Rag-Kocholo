        "meta_description": "Dawn Kish received her first camera when she was 17 years old and for over 25 years, she has been photographing adventure, sports and conservation. A boat-and river-lover who’s based in Flagstaff, Arizona, Kish directed the short film Can't Beat This Place for Fun (Mountainfilm 2021) as an ode to a boat shop that keeps the tradition of wooden boat building alive while honoring the story of Martin Litton’s Grand Canyon Dory. Her most recent film Tad's Emerging World — Glen Canyon Exposed (Mountainfilm 2023) is about documenting Glen Canyon, America's lost National Park as it returns from being submerged by the building of the Glen Canyon Dam in 1963. This film was screened at The Banff Book and Film Fest 2022. She is also a Mountainfilm Commitment Grantee for her upcoming film Old Man Lightning.",
