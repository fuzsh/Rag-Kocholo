        "text": "1999\n\n1 hr 12 mins\n\nDrama\n\nNR\n\nWatchlist\n\nGhesse Haye Kish was originally produced as a six-episode omnibus film with finances from investors on the Island of Kish in the Persian Gulf, which is a free zone belonging to Iran. All episodes take place on the abandoned island, which had profited from the passing ships between Asia and Europe in ancient times, and they are all about solitude. In \"The Greek Boat,\" the wife of a shopkeeper on the shore is psychologically affected by the cardboard boxes washed up by the sea that her husband uses to repair their hut. International brands that appear on the packaging bring out her fear of foreigners. An exorcist advises her husband to choose between the cardboard and his wife. The film tries to comment on the conflict between traditional and modern values, using minimal narrative. In the episode \"The Ring,\" a young Kurdish man from the country whose family cannot afford to pay for his studies arrives illegally on the island to find a job. He leads a lonely life, saving his earnings to buy a ring for his sister's fianc√©. The documentary style is evident in this simple tale without pretensions. Mohsen Makhmalbaf is responsible for the closing episode of Ghesse Haye Kish, called \"The Door,\" about a man left with only the door of his house after having sold everything else. He roams the barren island with his black-veiled daughter and a baby goat, while the postman chases after him to give him his mail. Simple in narrative, the film is rich in Makhmalbaf's metaphorical style, which blends absurdity and humor. These three episodes were shown in competition at the 52nd Cannes Film Festival in 1999."
