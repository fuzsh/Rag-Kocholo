        "text": "Nicky Rudolph (11), an aspiring director, is currently in the works of producing his second film Trepidation.\n\nAccording to Rudolph this film is a “typical black and white horror with a cute redhead model.” The lead role is being played by SJHHS alumni, Bree Kish. When asked how she feels about being in the film Kish said, “I’m super stoked to be in the film, man.” Some other members of the film crew include fellow students Jacob Kunysz (11) and Jack Greene (11). Kunysz’s role in the film is the creative consultant, and Greene’s role is head camera man.\n\nTrepidation is going to be filmed in the Ladera Ranch Library and a few other undisclosed locations within Ladera Ranch as well. The script for the film has already been drafted and shooting for the movie will begin in early November.\n\nRudolph was exposed to the filmmaking world through his father Stu Rudolph. Stu is in the movie making business and has been part of countless movie and television show production sets. This has allowed Rudolph to have a hands-on experience as he was able to see what it takes to produce and direct a film. Regarding Nicky’s production of the film, Stu said,“ I’m really proud he is doing something different and I am willing to help him with equipment and anything else that he needs.”"
