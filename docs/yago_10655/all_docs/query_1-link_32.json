Sitting on an exam table, she chats with Alison Morton, who carefully molds a cast around McMullan’s thigh and knee to create a prosthetic. The short film follows the pair, focusing the lens on the lower appendages as Morton measures, molds, and smooths a model that will help shape a new limb. As McMullan tries the leg on and shares how it forms to her body, she offers a unique view into the meticulous science behind the process of fitting the medical aid, along with the special intimacy between a prosthetist and a patient.\n\nWatch “Fitting” from Aeon Video on Vimeo. For more insight into prosthetics and their design, check out our interview with Sophie de Oliveira Barata from The Alternative Limb Project.\n\nShare this story\n\nadvertisement\n\nFilm\n\nWhat’s That Mark on the Wall? A Dryly Humorous Short Film Plunges into One Imagination’s Quest for an Answer\n\nWhen facing the unknown, the human brain is a powerhouse of dreams, paranoia, and pure ingenuity that helps fill in the gaps. An impeccably stylized short film written and directed by Anderson Wright plunges viewers into one woman’s inventive search for reason and rationality.\n\n“The Mark On The Wall” is based on Virginia Woolf’s short story of the same name, which opens with the mysterious line—”Perhaps it was the middle of January in the present year that I first looked up and saw the mark on the wall.”— before sinking into a stream-of-consciousness style monologue of speculation and intrigue. The film emulates Woolf’s signature form as the narrator visualizes all the joyful, harrowing, and disturbing possibilities that caused a dark spot to appear within her home. Unsurprisingly, it’s not what she thinks.\n\nWatch “The Mark On The Wall” on Vimeo, where you can find more of Wright’s films.\n\nShare this story\n\nAnimation Film Science Social Issues\n\nIn ‘Dance, Dance Evolution,’ Grooving Is the Millennia-Old Key to Health and Community\n\nMore effective than medication, therapy, and yoga, dancing recently topped the list of successful treatments for depression, and for good reason. Since time immemorial, boogying has permeated every culture and formed the basis of social bonds, a linchpin of community and strong mental health.\n\nA delightful short film directed and animated by Rosanna Wan and Andrew Khosravani for Aeon details the scientific link between dance and good feelings. When people come together to tango or jump-step through a polka, they often experience what’s known as collective effervescence, a concept coined by the French sociologist Émile Durkheim that describes the harmony and joy that arises when gathering in a group with a shared purpose.\n\nAs the film notes, “dance is the great accelerator of collective effervescence,” hurtling us toward synchronicity and happiness through a euphoric rush of neuro-hormones, endorphins, and more. When we dance together, we experience ourselves merging, becoming one energized, exuberant unit.\n\nWatch “Dance, Dance Evolution” above, and find more from Aeon on Vimeo.\n\nShare this story\n\nFilm\n\nSeeing with Sound: A Short Film Follows the Man Teaching Echolocation to Blind People\n\nDaniel Kish has taught thousands of students worldwide an essential skill: to see with sound. A lifelong advocate for the blind, Kish is a pioneer in echolocation, the ability to perceive one’s surroundings by making clicking noises or tapping a cane. As sound waves bump onto nearby walls and objects, the noises they reflect create a sort of audible map. “If I click at a surface,” he says in a new short documentary, “it answers back.”\n\nDirected by Ben Wolin and Michael Minahan for The New Yorker, “Echo” follows Kish and a few students who have benefited from his teachings. We witness a young boy learning to skateboard despite being told it’s too dangerous and hear from Juan, the first person Kish decided to help learn echolocation who has since become a lifelong friend. As the film moves through streets and various locations, animations accompany the soundscapes to help visualize what Kish and others experience as they interpret their surroundings.\n\nIn addition to celebrating powerful bonds between people, “Echo” is also a striking example of how adaptable and ingenious the human body is, considering studies show that the brain interprets echolocation in the same region that it processes visuals for sighted people. With the proper training and a skilled teacher like Kish, echoes can provide not only the position, distance, and size of an object but also the shape and even texture.\n\nThis opens up more possibilities for experiencing the world, which Kish notes at the end of the film: “Doors aren’t open to blind kinds in this society or almost any society. The doors are shut, barred, locked. You have to kick down that door because we’ve spent millennia being kept in the dark.”\n\nWatch “Echo” on Vimeo.\n\nShare this story\n\nFilm Nature Science\n\nInsects Inhabit Blooming Floral Worlds in ‘Umwelt’ by Yoshiyuki Katayama\n\nYoshiyuki Katayama captures the ineffable qualities of nature and time in her ongoing series Umwelt (previously), which traces myriad relationships between insects and flowering plants. The title takes its name from an ethological concept that uses the German word “umwelt,” usually translated to “self-centered world,” to describe how animals experience their surroundings. Through elegant timelapses of unfurling blossoms, Katayama composes portraits of hostas and gerberas inhabited by colorful six-and eight-legged creatures that, thanks to some great editing, move in real time.\n\nFind more on the artist’s website and Instagram.\n\nShare this story\n\nArt Film Social Issues\n\n‘A Ship From Guantánamo’ Navigates the Profoundly Creative Sculptures of an Artist Imprisoned Since 2002\n\n“When I start an artwork, I forget I’m in prison,” says Moath al-Alwi, presumably recorded from within Guantánamo Bay in a short documentary. Directed and produced by Dara Kell and Veena Rao for The New York Times Op-Docs series, the film zeroes in on al-Alwi’s elaborate ship sculptures, complete with anchors, towering masts, and sails imprinted with a stamp that reads “APPROVED BY US FORCES.”\n\nFrom Saudi Arabia, al-Alwi has been incarcerated at Guantánamo Bay detention center in Cuba without charges since 2002. Like others in prison, his art practice is circumscribed to the narrow range of materials available, including dental floss, cardboard, and the threads of a prayer cap. “A Ship From Guantánamo” reveals how the artist defies this particular constraint as he fashions intricate vessels from the items he gathers from guards and friends. “I want people to know that we can make beautiful things, even if we’re in a place like Guantánamo,” he adds.\n\nAl-Alwi and those imprisoned alongside him showed their artworks in the proactive 2017 exhibition, Ode to the Sea: Art from Guantánamo, at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. That show made waves after the Pentagon stated that artworks created at the detention center were the property of the U.S. government rather than the artists themselves, a decision that coincided with authorities refusing to release artworks from the prison.\n\n“A Ship From Guantánamo” is one such way artists like al-Alwi have been able to share their projects in recent years. Never showing the artist’s face, the film highlights the humanity of those detained and explains the profound necessity of art-making in such torturous environments.\n\nAlthough al-Alwi was cleared for release in 2021, he remains in custody, despite several attempts to finally close the infamous prison.\n\nShare this story"
