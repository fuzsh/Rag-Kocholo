This arresting mini-trilogy is set on Kish Island in Iran, and so very much resembles another tripartite Iranian film from 1999, Tales from Kish, directed by Abolfazl Jalili, Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Naser Taghvai. Director Marzieh Meshkini served as Makhmalbaf's assistant on The Door, his segment from that movie; her feature debut is written by Makhmalbaf and has the same mysterious quality, combining a playful sweetness with desperate sadness.

The first part shows a little girl, Hava, on her ninth birthday, longing to play with a little boy but forced to wear the chador and retreat into enforced modesty, as this is the day she has become a woman.

The next section is an all-female bicycle race: young women in chadors are pedalling madly through the desert scrub - a brilliant visual image, like the teachers with their boards in Samira Makhmalbaf's Blackboards or the desert wedding party in Kandahar. But the woman in pole position, Ahoo, is distracted by her husband who gallops beside her on a horse, demanding she abandon her cycling dreams and then divorcing her, then and there, on the hoof.

And the final scene shows a very old woman being wheeled around Kish's tourist shopping mall, buying all the luxuries she was denied in her life. The movie returns to the beach where the three strands tie up - and the beach is a location to strip mankind, and womankind, bare.

Meshkini very much shows the Makhmalbaf house style, but demonstrates a light, personal touch. Her movie has a dreamy surreality which is yet firmly grounded in the waking world as well as an urgent advocacy of women's rights which has not been considered fashionable or relevant in European or Anglophone cinema for many years.
