Curated by Bartomeu Marín, this presentation offers viewers the opportunity to revisit a selection of works chronologically bound between 1965 and 1975, paying homage to his landmark 1967 exhibition held at Marlborough Fine Art in London. Accompanying the exhibition is a new publication which contextualizes Genovés’s unique approach to the political context in which he lived.\n\n2021\n\nThe biography Juan Genovés, Ciudadano y pintor, written by Mariano Navarro, Armando Montesinos and Alicia Murría, is publishes (Turner, 2021).\n\n2020\n\nJuan Genovés passes away on 15th May in Madrid.\n\nOpening of the exhibition Juan Genovés XX-XXI at Museo Goya in Zaragoza, Spain.\n\n2019\n\nThe Moscow MOMA, in collaboration with the Marlborough Gallery in Madrid, hosts the exhibition Juan Genovés: Crowds, a major retrospective of his work.\n\nThe book Resistencia (La Fábrica, 2019) is published, a Spanish-English volume coordinated by the former director of the Marlborough Barcelona Gallery, Violant Porcel, which offers an exhaustive journey through the painter’s career from 1965 to 1977, delving into its more political aspect. The book includes texts by Violant Porcel, Armando Montesinos, Alicia Murría, Mariano Navarro, David Campany, Pedro G. Romero, Fernando Sánchez Castillo, Daniel G. Andújar, Ian Gibson, Patricia Esquivias and Juan Genovés himself. At the book presentation event held in Madrid in the fall of 2019, the historian Mariano Navarro and the artist Fernando Sánchez Castillo accompanied the artist.\n\nAt the Niemeyer center in Avilés, the exhibition The unit divided by zero is held. Curated by Ana Genovés, the show was a sample of around fifty pieces of painting, sculpture, video art installation or photography that brings together the work of Genovés with that of his children in a common thread, Pablo, Silvia and Ana. It is the first and only occasion in which the artist and his three children undertake an exhibition project together. The Transbase sculpture, placed in the Niemeyer Center square as part of the exhibition, was donated by the artist and is permanently in the cultural complex.\n\nHe continues to work with intervened graphics, runs of ten digital prints that the artist modifies with paint and small objects. The Juan Genovés exhibition is held. Live and coexist in the Benlliure gallery in his native Valencia.\n\n2018\n\nThe Reina Sofía Museum celebrates the collective exhibition Poetics of Democracy. Images and counter-images of the Transition as part of the commemorative acts of the 40th anniversary of the Constitution. The Embrace is one of the main pieces of the first part of the exhibition that collects anti-Franco art gathered at the 1976 Venice Biennale.\n\nJuan Genovés is inaugurated. Recent Paintings in Marlborough New York. It is the last exhibition that the artist does in life in the mother house of the gallery that accompanied him throughout his career.\n\nThe exhibition Irreversible, at the Marlborough gallery in Barcelona, revolves around his intervened graphics. This means of expression can be highlighted as one of his great projects in recent years since, according to the artist himself, it constituted an exercise in freedom prior to bringing some ideas to his paintings.\n\n2017\n\nAmnesty International launches a facsimile edition of the El Abrazo poster, which the Democratic Junta, in hiding, asked the painter to request the freedom of political prisoners.\n\nThe group exhibition Yesterday and Today. The labyrinth of time held at the Marlborough Gallery in Madrid and curated by Francisco Calvo Serraller, brings together works by all the gallery’s artists to establish a dialogue between their old and more recent works. The works by Juan Genovés present are Proyecto (1993) and Partido, (2016), in this context the artist has the opportunity to meet with his fellow creators who accompanied him through the years in this common space.\n\nThe Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Carlos of Valencia invests him as an Honorary Academician. During the delivery, the president of the institution, Manuel Muñoz, stressed that it was an “obligation for Genovés to be part of this academic body.” Genovés donated his work La calle to the institution.\n\n2016 y 2017\n\nHe grants a series of interviews for the art critics Armando Montesinos, Alicia Murría and Mariano Navarro, who are in charge of writing his forthcoming biography.\n\n2016\n\nAfter 40 years hidden in the basement of the Reina Sofía Museum, El Abrazo, is ceded by the institution to be placed in the Congress of Deputies thanks to the request of the deputies of the United Left.

On” from the series Imprescindibles in La 2. This audiovisual piece is still one of the most complete and profound that have been carried out on the life and work of the artist.\n\nEl Abrazo is exhibited within the framework of the historic collective exhibition Myths of Pop held at the Thyssen Museum. The presence of the work within an apparently incongruous context serves to testify to the social and political concerns that coexist with the artistic language of pop art.\n\n2013\n\nThe Center del Carme Cultura Contemporània (CCCC) in Valencia hosts the large individual exhibition Crowds, which brings together more than fifty works by the painter from the 1950s to the most recent, covering practically all of the artist’s production. In addition, two monumental sculptures made that same year are exhibited: Process and Speculum, in corten steel and aluminum, respectively.\n\nMartin Coomer, author of the introductory text of the catalogue, writes about the works that make up the exhibition: “When contemplating them, we inevitably think of barriers; Images of political or ideological frontiers come to mind that the artist deliberately prefers not to reveal. This is the reason why, although in a tone less declamatory but no less provocative than that of the irreverent icons of Pop art, half a century later, the echoes of Genovés’ painting from the mid-1960s still resonate with the same strength. In his hands, the human mass becomes an anonymous and recurring product of history. Power, persecution, resistance or displacement are some of the eternal themes of a work that continues to move the viewer regardless of the setting to which it is moved; whether it be Madrid in the 1960s, Berlin or Beijing in the 1980s, Cairo or any of the settings of the Arab Spring of 2010. History not only takes over Genovés’ work, it is more, it recreates it” .\n\nCrowds travels to Perpignan, A Coruña, Murcia and Moscow.\n\n2012\n\nReceives the Culture Prize of the Community of Madrid in the category of Plastic Arts.

The show is a great success and is praised by both critics and the public.\n\n2006\n\nTo commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Spanish Republic Juan signs a manifesto titled “With pride, modesty and gratitude” along with other prominent members from the spheres of culture, politics and the arts.

This meeting will influence his work and the two men become great friends until the death of Renau in 1983.\n\n1970\n\nJuan works on a series of monotypes. This will serve as the preparatory work for a series of ideogrammatic paintings where he substitutes literary titles for graphic signs or ideograms. These paintings are not understood and Juan chooses to give these paintings numbers instead of titles. He is still involved in the political struggle and is painting murals on walls.\n\n1969\n\nHis daughter Ana is born. The film “A Test of Violence” containing images of his work wins the Gold Medal at the Moscow International Film Festival, the Silver Medal at the Venice Film Festival and the Bronze statue at the Cork Festival. Juan works on two portfolios of work on paper titled “Silence silence…” which will be published by Marlborough Gallery Graphics and presented the following year in London and New York.

He receives a honourable mention at the XXXIII Venice Biennial.\n\n1965\n\nHe returns to his painting, but now his painting has changed dramatically being influenced by “political realism”. Disappointed in the art world he has decided to change his approach to painting. He now works in one of two ways either “man alone” or “crowd”. Juan has a solo show, which is key in his artistic career, in the gallery of the Fine Arts Board in Madrid, now housing the National Library. He is beginning to be a thorn in the side of the Franco regime. He paints a series of gouaches. He travels to Brazil where he makes contact with a new art dealer.\n\n1964\n\nAt this time the “Equipo Cronica” is formed in Valencia.

The exhibition is organised by the Friends of Art Society in the Madrid National Library’s gallery. At the end of the year the group breaks up and this leads to a profound crisis for Genovés who even considers giving up painting. He won’t paint for a year. To make ends meet he designs a silver jewellery collection, which he makes with his own hands. Feeling disappointed in the art world he decides to take a decisive role in the resistance to the Franco regime and joins the active workers’ movements of the time.

He takes part in the II biennial of Spanish American Art in Havana in Cuba. Angela Ballester joins the group Los Siete and Vicente Fillol leaves, to go to Paris. Juan is awarded the First Prize in Painting in the National Youth Show in Madrid.\n\n1952\n\nIn the summer he starts his military service in Ronda, Malaga.

In Madrid he rents a studio in the Beire Street along with the painters Angel Duarte and Julio Alvarez. He attends the conference given by Dalí in the Maria Guerrero Theatre titled “Picasso is a Communist just like I’m not”. He is still keeping up his work with Los Siete, now exhibiting in the Sala Braulio. They are now organising exhibitions, concerts, and poetry recitals among other cultural activities.

He has his first group show with Los Siete in his uncle Vicente Genovés Cubells’ furniture shop at 38 Colon Street. It is an important event in the Valencian art world at the time. From then on the group organises shows every two months around collective work sessions concerning a specified subject. The invitations are hand painted and given away. Genovés is awarded the Gold medal at the Valencia University Art show and wins the First National Prize for painting at the SEU University Art in Madrid.\n\n1949\n\nFranciso Candel sends him the two catalogues of the I and II Salones de Octubre (October Salons) held in Barcelona. He founds the group “El Siete” with his friends from art school and they rent a studio in the Quart Street. To begin with they don’t show they just organise “tertulias” (intellectual gatherings) and meetings. Here they discuss such subjects as abstract art. Juan defends figurative painting. He sells his first painting “Paisaje de Santo Domingo” (The Santo Domingo countryside) to José Carles who gives him the book “Theories” by Maurice Denis. From this moment on he develops an interest and preference for the writing of painters.\n\n1948\n\nHe becomes friends with a group of students who spurn academic studies and are eager to discuss and learn about the new trends from abroad. In the future these restless youths will form a group called “Los Siete” (The Seven). They start up an anti academic trend and turn their back on the work set by the school, preferring a more profound approach to study. Behind the slogan “entorna la vista” (Look inwards) they argue that “painting has to be seen with wide open eyes”, a type of neosorollismo. Juan starts to paint the countryside and the streets. He spends the summer holidays in Barcelona in his uncle’s house where his cousin Francisco Candel lives. Here he discovers Romanesque art and the first period of Picasso’s art. He travels to the Catalan Pyrennees and fills a sketchbook, which he will later turn into etchings.\n\n1947\n\nHe can continue studying thanks to his brother Eduardo who goes out to work so that he can carry on at art school. He fails the most important subject; painting, mainly due to the fact that he has never previously used oil paints. He also uses paint very sparingly as he can hardly afford to buy it. In September he passes. He campaigns against the teachers who support Franco and rallies his non-conformist student friends to demonstrate.\n\n1946\n\nHe starts his studies at the San Carlos art school where he is the youngest on the course. He sells his first work of art for 90 pesetas. It is a miniature to stick on boxes of chocolates. He will continue painting miniatures to help his family with money after the failure of the coal business.\n\n1945\n\nHe starts drawing on the walls in charcoal. He draws “the coyote,” a popular comic book character. He meets the painter Verchili who looks over his paintings and encourages him to keep on painting. He starts preparing to enter the San Carlos art school by going to night classes with Don Santiago who is preparing him for the theoretical exam. For the drawing exam he paints with the teacher trainers at the art school. Among those students are Eusebio Sempere and Custodio Marco who give him the nickname “El Xiquet”, the kid.\n\n1944\n\nHe starts to go to the technical college to study drawing in the artistic metalwork department where he copies engravings and plaster statues. He starts to learn the trade of engraver. He gets to know his cousin Francisco Candell who will become a writer and they start up a friendship, which will last all their lives. They paint watercolours together in the orchards and around Valencia.\n\n1943\n\nHe must leave school to help in the family coal-yard, which his father has opened in Doctor Sumsi Street. In the evenings he attends Don Santiago’s night classes.\n\n1942\n\nHe starts to help his father to paint children’s furniture in his uncle Vicente’s workshop. This is his introduction to paint, enamel, turpentine, brushes and stencils.\n\n1941\n\nThe family move again, this time to the maritime area, to 13 Vicente Sancho Tello Street. He changes schools. Here he starts to draw. He still remembers the republican teacher Don Santiago who encouraged him to develop his talent. He is still a great football fan. He hates getting dirty. He must look for charcoal and he goes hungry in spite of the ration books.\n\n1940\n\nJuan strikes up a great friendship with his cousin Ramon a militant anarchist who takes shelter in their home and who recounts stirring stories of war and solidarity. He speaks to him of the importance of culture for the workers. Juan becomes a great reader and reads anything he can get his hands on. He doesn’t believe what the priests at school tell him.\n\n1939\n\nThe Republican defeat affects the family and Juan personally. He is severely traumatised. He must start a new school and he is no longer allowed to speak Valencian. He must accept a new society where there is a strong military presence, with priests seemingly everywhere and the oppressive atmosphere of fear and silence. Books and magazines are burned in the patio of their home.\n\n1938\n\nJuan has his first taste of social protest at school when the children chant “men to war” at the only male teacher. The children feel satisfied with their collective strength when the man leaves the school. Genovés’ parents decide to send Juan and Eduardo to the U.S.S.R. but at the last moment they turn back from the station and flee from the war and it’s terrible consequences. They move to Villar del Arzobispo, a Valencian village inland where they find food and tranquillity. Juan’s sister Palmira is born.\n\n1937\n\nJuan Genovés starts at “La Pasionaria” primary school. (La pasionaria was the name given to Dolores Ibarurri, as she was such a passionate defender of communism and the Republic). The teachers take the children to the Rialto cinema to watch Eisenstein films and Stalinist cinema.\n\n1936\n\nDuring the first days of the Spanish Civil War Juan sees things that will stay with him all his life: bombings, the firing squad, people against the walls, missiles whistling overhead, empty streets, silence, darkness, corpses and injured people lying in the streets. His home is caught in the crossfire between the uprising in the barracks and the republicans in the football stadium. His family take shelter under mattresses on the floor. In his house they have an electric radio and the locals go round to hear the news. Valencia is still on the Republican side.\n\n1935\n\nThe family move to the paternal grandparents house at nº 1 General Pando Street in the Barrio Obrero”, (the working class district) which no longer exists, again, close to the football stadium. Juan Genovés’ grandfather, Vicente, a sawyer by trade was a left wing progressive, and as a young man had been friends with Pablo Iglesias, another comrade in the political struggles with Josep Renau. His opinions influenced his young grandson with whom he was very close.\n\n1934\n\nJuan takes a strong dislike to hairdressers after his father takes him to get his long blonde hair cut and he is mistaken for a girl.\n\n1933\n\nJuan’s brother Eduardo is born. The family continue to have monetary problems. The right wing is starting to gain support and there is tension among the workers. Juan Genovés sitting on his father’s shoulders and watching the crowds in the streets.\n\n1931\n\nThe Mestalla football stadium was close to Micer Mascó Street. Juan Genovés was to become an ardent football fan. When the Republic was declared Juan’s father was delighted while his mother was horrified.\n\n1930\n\nJuan Genovés is born in Valencia on the 31st of May at nº 17 Finlandia Street in the neighbourhood of the Great Exhibition. He was, however registered in the family book (book all Spanish families are given when a couple marry to register births and deaths) as being born on the 1st of June and was often congratulated on the 30th of May. His parents were Juan Genovés Cubells an artisan metal engraver and painter decorator of furniture. His mother was Maria Candel Muñoz. His father came from a family with strong ties to the progressive left wing and the woodworkers’ trade union. His mother’s family were practising Catholics. The atmosphere in the home was cultural and artistic. This same year the family moved to Micer Mascó Street in the same district."
