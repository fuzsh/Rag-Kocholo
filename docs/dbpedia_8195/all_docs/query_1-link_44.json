Many of you described your lives as driven by a commitment to improving access to justice and achieving substantive democracy in Bolivia, and you ­were extremely generous in sharing your experiences as you wrestled with how best to accomplish ­those goals. I owe a special debt of gratitude to ­people connected to the integrated justice centers—­staff, interns, and former volunteers—­and the Bolivian Ministry of Justice, for allowing me to work closely with them. So too I am indebted to the clients of the centers and o ­ thers I met along the way—­whether in conference rooms, in classrooms, in courtrooms, or on the streets—­who ­were willing to share their stories with me, both the painful and the happy. Some of you appear h ­ ere ­under pseudonyms. O ­ thers of you do not appear in the text but are very much pres­ent, nonetheless. You ­shaped this proj­ect and my thinking. And you are always on my mind as I try to get it right, try to show the commitments and conflicting agendas, frustrations, and triumphs, of the many ­people whose proyectos de vida are entangled with the country’s proceso de cambio—­including ­those who critique it. Thank you for your openness, insights, time, and thoughtfulness in the many conversations we have shared over the years. I am deeply grateful to the p ­ eople who nurtured this proj­ect from its beginnings at Brown University: Kay B. Warren, Daniel J. Smith, Jessaca Leinaweaver, and Keith Brown. Each of you played a critical but distinct role in helping me grow as a scholar. Kay, you may not remember offering me—­a stranger at the time—­advice in your Harvard office back in 2000. I was fresh\n\nout of college and considering gradu­ate school, and you urged me not to apply ­until I had a clear vision of the proj­ect I wanted to undertake. So I ­didn’t apply to gradu­ate school that year. Instead, I got a job that led me to Bolivia for four years. Six years and a master’s degree l­ater, I applied to PhD programs, and at the last minute discovered you had moved to Brown. And I applied. You, like every­one on my PhD committee, encouraged my ideas, pushed my thinking, and helped me wrestle with the inevitable dilemmas. Thank you. James Doyle, Sohini Kar, Colin Porter, Stacey Vanderhurst, Láura Vares, and Caitlin Walker, you also have been ­there since the beginning. You are brilliant interlocutors, but more importantly, you are wonderful p ­ eople and dear friends, and I could not have gotten through this pro­cess without you. Thank you for laughing with me, crying with me, writing with me, and taking the requisite dance breaks in Giddings—­located, ­ever so fittingly, at the corner of Power and Hope (streets). Many friends and colleagues generously read applications, papers, and, ultimately, draft chapters as this proj­ect unfolded (including t­hose named above). You have made me a better writer and thinker, and I am grateful for your critical eyes and listening ears: Paja Faudree, Andrea Flores, Kathleen Millar, Katie Rhine, Jessica Cooper, Carmen Soliz, Abou Farman, Inna Leykin, Katharine Marsh, Bianca Dahl, Erin Raffety, Rose Wellman, Naomi Murakawa, Hillel Soifer, Jennifer Ashley, Jorge Derpic, Amy Kenmore, Magnus Pharao Hansen, Bhawani Buswala, Yana Stainova, Hunter Farrell, Catia Confortini, Audrey Pieper, Rachel Douglas-­Jones, and the participants in the Wenner-­Gren–sponsored “Hope and Insufficiency” workshop and the “Oikos” seminar at Prince­ton. While I worked at Prince­ton University, Carol Green­house and João Biehl offered vital guidance, while Carol Zanca, Mo Lin Yee, Gabriela Drinovan, and Alan Mann kept my head on straight. Celeste Alexander, Pablo Landa, Peter Locke, Sebastián Ramírez, Joel Rozen, Megan Steffen, Serena Stein, and Shreya Subramani w ­ ere convivial conversation partners. At Wellesley College, a wonderful team of colleagues has encouraged and advised me through the final stages of this book, including Adam Van Arsdale, Anastasia Karakasidou, Deborah Matzner, Peggy Levitt, Kelly Rutherford, Smitha Radhakrishnan, Liza Oliver, Julie Walsh, Petra Rivera-­Rideau, Justin Armstrong, Elizabeth Minor, Sara Lewis, Sara Wasserman, Ryan Quintana, Octavio González, Ed Silver, Spencer Hey, Igor Logvinenko, and Adriana Mihal. I am grateful to my editor at Duke, Gisela Fosado, for her guidance and encouragement. Special thanks go to Lydia Rose Rappoport-­Hankins for steering me through the book’s production. Two anonymous reviewers ofx\n\nAcknowl­edgments\n\nfered fine-­grained readings of the manuscript and clarifying suggestions, and I enormously appreciate their generative feedback. As I was formulating this proj­ect and ­later grappling with what I found, I relied on the scholarship, critical perspectives, and advice of Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, Pamela Calla, Germán Guaygua, Juan Arbona, and Helene Risør. Nancy Postero has been a generous mentor all along the way, talking through ideas, reading drafts, encouraging per­sis­tence, and generally offering her limitless wisdom in all ­things. I am especially grateful to the Universidad de la Cordillera for the academic affiliation as I conducted research, as well as to the Bolivian Vice Ministry of Justice and Fundamental Rights, and Vice Minister Nelson Cox Mayorga, for the formal affiliation with the ministry as I worked in the integrated justice centers. I offer a special thank-­you to Bolivia’s former chief justice and president, Dr. Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, for his assessment of judicial reform and foreign aid in Bolivia. My fieldwork experience was enriched by a wonderful crew of bolivianistas, who debated policy, assembled in Bolivia’s National Museum of Ethnography and Folklore conference room, shivered in late-­night Federation of Neighborhood Associations gatherings, trekked to Sucre, and crowded into each other’s homes for thoughtful and rowdy conversations about politics, our research, and our own proyectos de vida: Yvonne Goodson, Nancy Egan, Lesli Hoey, Gabriel Hetland, Raúl Rodriguez Arancibia, Sarah Hines, Karl Swinehart, Chuck Sturtevant, Sara Shahriari, Magalí Rabasa, Nate Freiburger, Marcelo Bohrt Seeghers, Kevin Young, Nicole Pacino, Rubén Chambi Mayta, Santos Tola, Claudia Terrazas Sosa, Sarah Henken, Chenoa Stock, and Carmen Rosa Mamani Espinal. A vibrant intellectual community has influenced this proj­ect—­and me— in dif­fer­ent ways, including Richard Snyder, Ieva Jusionyte, Cathy Lutz, Matt Guttmann, Jim Green, Sherine Hamdy, Angelica Duran Martinez, Harris Solomon, Christine Reiser, Kendra Fehrer, Rebecca Galemba, Yağmur Nuhrat, Kristin Skrabut, Bryan Moorefield, Kim Lewis, Chelsea Cormier McSwiggin, Alyce de Carteret, Ana Catarina Teixeira, Sinem Adar, Erin Beck, Jennifer Costanza, Noelle Brigden, Andrea Maldonado, Elizabeth Bennett, Ann Barham, and Alissa Wilson—­who invigorated every­one and every­thing she touched for the better. Kathy Grimaldi was my anchor during much of the research phase of this proj­ect, and I thank her, Matilde Andrade, and Margie Sugrue, as well as Susan Hirsch and José Torrealba for their support throughout. Ajantha Subramanian and Michael D. Jackson led me back to anthropology while I was at Harvard Divinity School. Richard G. Fox, Lisa Baldez, John Herzfeld, and Melissa Derrick Martin helped set me on this path so many Acknowl­edgments\n\nxi\n\nyears ago. And Mandy Rice has listened to my stories and encouraged me along the way. Indeed, this book proj­ect has deep roots. It dates back to 2000, when I first traveled to Bolivia with the Washington University in St. Louis Catholic Student Center. We w ­ ere slated to volunteer with an organ­ization serving Cochabamba’s street kids. Instead, thanks to a chance encounter with Amanda Martin, I would end up using that summer to investigate U.S. drug policy while interviewing w ­ omen incarcerated in the San Sebastian w ­ omen’s prison in Cochabamba (along with Kate McCoy). I ­later returned to the country in 2001 to begin a four-­year stint working with a national network of Bolivian organ­izations pursuing social and economic justice. ­There are many ­people who played an enormously consequential role in this long journey, and two of ­those most dear to my heart are Kate McCoy and Rob Young, my kindred spirits. GeorgeAnn Potter and Melissa Draper w ­ ere some of the first ­people who interpreted po­liti­cal events in Bolivia to me. From 2001 to 2005, my committed colleagues and conversation partners spanned hemi­spheres: Maria Arroyo, Rebecca Barnes, Samuel Condori, Peter Davies, ­Sister Anitawa Fearday, Maggie Fogarty, Jason and Felicia Gehrig, ­Father Mike Gillgannon, Melanie Hardison, Brad Hestir, Enriqueta Huanto, Lourdes Huayhua, Alejandrina Ibáñez, Clotilde Loza, Lynn McClintock, Dan Moriarty, S­ ister Joan Mury, Jean Norris, Del Olsen, Julieta Paredes, Luis Pérez, Tim Provencal, Joanna and Erwin Ramos-­Romero, Cecilia Requena, Sara Weinstein, and Rina Yanapa. Andrea and Andy Baker, Hunter and Ruth Farrell, Lionel Derenoncourt, and Cati Williams w ­ ere my core community of accountability and care, each exemplifying dif­fer­ent ways to strug­gle for justice and find joy along the way. Mary Fred Coy and Stuart McCloy lovingly supported my ­mother, Helen, (and me) during the long stretches when I was away, as did the entire McCloy-­ Coy ­family. Thank you for all you did for her. Zoraida, Irma, Samuel, Braulio, y Basílica, gracias por hacerme parte de sus familias. Elizabeth López, no hay palabras suficientes para expresar mi gratitud por ser mi hermana en la lucha, por el amparo que me brindas y el empuje que me das. My fieldwork was made pos­si­ble thanks to the generous support of the Jacob K. Javits Fellowship, a Social Science Research Council ssrc-­a cls International Dissertation Research Fellowship, a Wenner-­Gren Foundation International Dissertation Research Fellowship, a National Science Foundation dissertation research fellowship (jointly funded by the Cultural Anthropology and Law and Social Sciences programs), the Tinker Field Research Grant through Brown’s Center for Latin American and Ca­rib­bean Studies, xii\n\nAcknowl­edgments\n\nand Brown University’s Gradu­ate Program in Development summer research grant. An earlier version of chapter 6 was published as “You Have to Comply with Paper: Debt, Documents, and ­Legal Consciousness in Bolivia,” Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 23(3). Material from chapter 2 appears in “Corrective Capacities: From Unruly Politics to Demo­cratic Capacitación,” Cambridge Journal of Anthropology 35(1). Fi­nally, I want to thank my parents for shaping how I relate to the world and write about it. My f­ather and stepmother, Bill Ellison and Linda Raymond Ellison, sat down at the dinner t­ able e­ very night, where we would talk through the major controversies of the day, including the multiple and conflicting perspectives that accompanied them. Their journalistic ethos has profoundly influenced the ways I approach fieldwork and tell stories—­even if my grammar leaves much to be desired. My f­ather, Bill, is my most enthusiastic cheerleader and approaches every­one he meets as worlds unto themselves, each one worth knowing and from whom much can be learned. My stepmother, Linda, encourages me to think of the world as bigger than my own experience or trou­bles. She read to me ­every night as a child, taking me to Narnia and to a ­Little House in the Big Woods, and taught me to listen to the rhythm of language. My ­mother, Helen McCloy, instilled in me a love of poetry and an eye for composition that inflects my writing to this day. She was invested in the lives, victories, and strug­gles of my friends in Bolivia, asking a­ fter them by name. All three of my parents encouraged me to take risks, to pursue social justice, to find my voice, and to ­really listen to the voices of ­others. I am grateful for their love, patience, and support throughout. All of t­ hese ­people—­and many more whom I have not been able to name ­here—­have influenced this book for the better. Any omissions, errors, or failings are mine alone.\n\nAcknowl­edgments\n\nxiii\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGiven a choice between a boiling, violent and a freezing, apathetic society as reaction to massive needs-­deprivation, topdogs tend to prefer the latter. They prefer “governability” to “trou­ble, anarchy.” They love “stability.” Indeed, a major form of cultural vio­lence indulged in by ruling elites is to blame the victim of structural vio­lence who throws the first stone, not in a glass­house but to get out of the iron cage, stamping him as “aggressor.” —­j ohan galtung, Peace by Peaceful Means\n\nLuz v. Jhonny Luz and her companion crouch in the front seat of the car, scanning the yogurt factory doorway for a familiar figure. They are watching for Luz’s estranged husband, Jhonny, who is coming off the night shift. We have been sitting like this, our breath barely vis­i­ble in the inky darkness, since about 5:30 a.m. We are h ­ ere to “serve” Jhonny with an invitation to conciliation—­a form of voluntary, third-­party mediation. In Bolivia, alternative dispute reso­ eople like Jhonny and lution (adr) programs aim to transform the ways p Luz ­handle their conflicts. But adr programs also aim to transform Bolivians as citizens and, indeed, to transform Bolivian democracy. Right now, however, we are focused on spotting Jhonny. Trucks bearing the com­pany logo are lined up awaiting entry. Minibuses periodically deliver workers for the early-­morning shift. The sky turns rosy as a slow trickle of workers exits the factory, nodding to the security guards, shivering against the piercing cold. We are not much warmer in the car Luz borrowed from her compadre de matrimonio—­the godfather of her marriage to Jhonny. A male friend has accompanied her. I learn he works with Jhonny and supplied the information\n\nabout Jhonny’s shift hours so that Luz could catch him as he left work. I never learn if he is Luz’s friend, a relative, a lover, or merely a coworker of Jhonny’s who is sympathetic to her plight. We wait. And wait. On edge. As we continue to monitor the exit, Luz turns to me, eyes apprehensive, and pleads: “I’m too ner­vous! Can you do it? I ­don’t want him to see me. Can you just do it?” I waver, but agree to hand Jhonny the letter and explain conciliation to him when he emerges. ­After several close calls, a lean, hunched man appears in the doorway. “It’s him!” Luz and her friend yelp in unison. I’m out the door, calling his name, walking briskly. No response. I call again, “Jhonny!” He turns his head slightly in my direction but continues walking down the block. “Jhonny!” I insist, trotting across the dusty, cobbled street. Jhonny stops, alarmed, and turns t­oward me. “¡No te asustes, no te asustes!” Do not be afraid, I try to reassure him. I tell him, “My name is Susan and I am from an integrated justice ­center. Your wife came to the center asking for help inviting you to conciliation. Conciliation is not a court pro­cess. Conciliation is about trying to find a solution to our conflicts. The idea is to have the help of a conciliator, a mediator, create a space where the two of you can talk through your prob­lems and arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement,” I say, repeating my oft-­rehearsed script. As I speak, I run my fin­ger along the lines in the letter that explains conciliation to invitees. I am parroting the short speeches I have heard center interns and staff deliver to potential clients when they inquire about l­ egal aid and conciliation ser­vices. Jhonny nods, hesitantly, his arms still outstretched as if anticipating a punch. He says, “You know my wife came h ­ ere claiming I had abandoned her with five kids—­making a scandal at work.”1 I respond, “What­ever your prob­lems, with conciliation you can talk about the issues and try to reach an agreement that is satisfying to you both. Conciliation ­isn’t reconciliation. Some p ­ eople do decide to work t­ hings out, to give each other a second chance, but o ­ thers want to separate definitively. Th ­ ose are ­things you two can discuss and put in an accord, a written agreement.” Jhonny nods again. “I understand.” “You should ­really think about coming,” I say, adding the ­little push I have learned from my colleagues: “It’s a good way to avoid the courts.” 2 Introduction\n\nI know that “the courts” ­will conjure many ­things for Jhonny, all of them negative. As many have insisted to me over the years, in Bolivia “­there is no justice.” Invoking “the courts” is code for tortuous administrative formalities, costly ­lawyers, and state agents more often associated with bribes and insults than fairness and succor. “Justice” is something that is mocked, or something that is manipulated, many Bolivians lament. And that’s the point of the extrajudicial conciliation ser­vices offered at the integrated justice center (ijc): it’s the easier, faster, more eco­nom­ical option, meant to appeal to Bolivians fed up with state bureaucracies and skeptical of the state ­legal system’s ability to deliver justice. I do not mention the fact that Luz may si­mul­ta­neously pursue a criminal case against him for domestic vio­lence. ­After months at the center, I know many ­women like her ­will not. “Yes, yes, I understand,” Jhonny repeats. “I ­will come [to the center].” And he does. This ­little stakeout was unusual. Most clients at Bolivia’s ijcs ­were expected to deliver their invitations to conciliation on their own. It is, a­ fter all, an invitation for a voluntary pro­cess, not a court summons. Conciliation is meant to be a friendly means to resolve disputes. But Luz was afraid.2 I had met Luz the previous day, when she approached the desk I was sharing with Angelica, the newest intern at the ijc in District 6 of El Alto, Bolivia. Luz had come to the center to ask for advice on a prob­lem she had with her husband who, she claimed, was violent and had been hiding out at his ­sister’s ­house, trying to escape her requests for financial support. Luz explained to Angelica that some years earlier, Jhonny had shoved her down a deep ravine, shattering her leg. She was hoping to bring him to the center so that he would promise to use his medical insurance to pay for the removal of several screws that ­were causing her discomfort. But Luz’s more pressing concern, she explained, was a debt she owed. She was due to make a quota payment on a loan from BancoSol that she took out at Jhonny’s request, and she needed her husband to help her cover the quota payment. Angelica discussed with Luz her options for initiating a domestic vio­lence case against her estranged husband, and she drafted letters of referral to the forensic medical examiner and a nongovernmental organ­ization (ngo) offering psychological ser­vices where she could obtain the documentation she would need as evidence. But Luz still insisted that she wanted to bring her Introduction 3\n\nhusband to the center sooner, to try conciliation first. She suggested, however, that she was afraid to go alone, so she begged me to accompany her. “If I go to his s­ ister’s ­house, ­she’ll just refuse to open the door,” Luz explained. “I want to catch him at work so that he ­can’t escape.” I happened to live close to the factory where Jhonny worked, and I agreed to go with her. As I wrote up my field notes the following day, I could hear Luz sobbing through the conciliator’s glass win­dow. She sat next to Jhonny, who had—­ despite my doubts—­shown up for the session. Luz gasped for breath and the conciliator held an X-­ray up to the light. The metal screws in her leg w ­ ere vis­ i­ble even to my untrained eye. ­Whether the injury occurred as Luz described it, I cannot verify, but Jhonny sat next to her looking sullen. I did not enter the conciliation session since I delivered the invitation letter and did not want to create any feelings of partiality (a recurring preoccupation among conciliation prac­ti­tion­ers). An hour ­later, the c­ ouple emerged. Jhonny ran across the street to make copies of the conciliation accord, which outlined the agreement they had apparently reached. Surprised and impressed that ­things had seemingly worked out, I wished Luz good luck. ­Later that eve­ning, however, I received a call from a very upset Luz. “Doctorita,” she moaned, “he falsified his signature!”3 “On the accord?” I asked. “Yes,” Luz responded mournfully. “He used a fake signature.”\n\nhow did luz end up crouching outside a yogurt factory at 5:30 a.m.? Why turn to adr rather than take her abusive husband to court for domestic vio­lence? Understanding how she got t­here—­and the choices she made—­ requires knowing a bit more about Luz’s case and the ways it reflects broader patterns of economic insecurity linked to vio­lence and debt. But it also requires a deeper historical and po­liti­cal analy­sis of programs like t­hose operating out of Bolivia’s ijcs and how they reflect broader foreign-­funded efforts to transform conflict and, indeed, politics in Bolivia. Knowing that history, we might also ask, how could a conflict-­resolution program aiming to help ­women like Luz become swept up in a larger debate over Bolivian democracy? adr programs like the one where I met Luz have become a commonsense platform for judicial reformers, democracy promoters, and good governance advocates worldwide.4 In the United States, adr is now taken for granted as the first resort for many civil and domestic disputes, including divorce 4 Introduction\n\nproceedings. In addition to court-­annexed conciliation—­which is directly affiliated with courts and aimed at facilitating settlements between disputing parties—­a dr encompasses a broader range of platforms. ­These include extrajudicial community mediation (often facilitated by volunteers) and commercial arbitration for business disputes. Beyond ­these institutional mechanisms for resolving conflict, the language of adr is likely familiar to readers. How many of us have learned to reframe our feelings in “I” statements (rather than accusatory ones beginning with “you”), to practice “active listening” techniques, and to identify the best alternative to a negotiated agreement (batna) of our counterpart in a business negotiation?5 adr is the stuff of corporate meetings, handbooks, and international symposia on better negotiation tactics. Recognizing the gendered dimensions of employment negotiations, female academics are encouraged to adopt negotiation techniques to improve their salary offers and to resist the socially ingrained tendency to not negotiate better packages. ­These are skills, toolkits, and methods often celebrated for improving communication and facilitating cooperation with outcomes that are beneficial to all parties. But throughout the world, the micropractices of negotiating a better salary offer or child support in the wake of divorce cannot be uncoupled from the macro-­politics of adr as a tool of democracy promotion and good governance platforms. ­These methods have spawned interdisciplinary fields of study concerned with peacemaking, academic journals, and ngos specializing in transitional justice.6 International ngos and the United Nations deploy conflict-­resolution programs in the wake of genocide and civil unrest. Canadian donors have encouraged indigenous communities downstream from multinational mining operations to utilize adr to s­ettle complaints over ecological degradation and its remediation with com­pany officials. German-­funded proj­ects have deployed adr-­trained analysts to rural communities beset by conflicts over territory ripe for agricultural production and export. Thus adr encompasses a multiscalar set of theories about conflict and its resolution, as well as techniques that travel from bedrooms to boardrooms, and from court-­annexed conciliation ser­vices to commissions on truth and reconciliation. In Bolivia, a network of ijcs enables ­women like Luz to access pro bono ­legal aid and conciliation ser­vices in order to resolve disputes with domestic partners and neighbors. Originally funded by the United States Agency for International Development (usaid), ­these adr programs encourage the urban poor to circumvent the courts and avoid over­burdened state institutions, Introduction 5\n\nthereby assuming personal responsibility for the resolution of their prob­ lems rather than relying on frustrating ­legal bureaucracies. Broader conflict-­ resolution programs also have targeted the more combative, confrontational organ­izing tactics of the city’s “militant” labor/trade u ­ nions and neighborhood associations. ­These “conflictual” movements, critics argue, threaten to destabilize Bolivian democracy and inhibit economic growth through unrelenting street protests. Donors have advanced adr as both a substitute to backlogged courts and as a means to instill Alteños—­residents of El Alto—­with more deliberative demo­cratic temperaments.7 In so d ­ oing, this constellation of programs yokes intimate conflict to po­liti­cal upheaval, and over­burdened courts to stunted economic development. Bolivian adr programs profess to improve access to justice, deepen democracy, improve governance, and create the conditions ­under which private enterprise might flourish. Yet adr and allied democracy-­promotion programs have become entangled in a much larger national debate over who sets the terms of democracy and what justice should look like in a plurinational Bolivia (that is, a multicultural society with a large indigenous majority). Foreign-­funded judicial reform and democracy-­assistance programs date back to the 1990s, when ­legal experts introduced adr alongside larger modernization and economic reform proj­ects. But conflict-­resolution programs took on new resonance in October 2003 following massive protests that rocked the city of El Alto and surrounding hamlets (see the “Uprising” interlude in this book). The government of Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada responded with military force. As Bolivia grappled with the aftermath, foreign donors renewed their efforts to reform Bolivian democracy and to deescalate simmering tensions through conflict-­resolution programs. In 2008, the Morales administration put usaid ­under the microscope, accusing the American mission of funding his right-­wing opposition and seeking to undermine his leftist government. Morales, Bolivia’s first indigenous president, rallied his base of support—­the coca growers’ u ­ nions in the Chapare and Yungas regions—­and accused usaid of po­liti­cal meddling (injerencia), ­later severing diplomatic relations with the United States. The accusations sent existing programs into a period of prolonged uncertainty about ­whether their proj­ects would continue or face imminent closure. The United States eventually suspended its democracy-­assistance programs, and in 2013, the Morales administration expelled usaid from the country. usaid had already transferred full control of its adr programs to the Bolivian Ministry of 6 Introduction\n\nJustice, while other European-­funded conflict-­resolution proj­ects continued to operate through the work of Bolivian ngos and through bilateral aid to the government.8 Regardless of who is executing them, however, conflict resolution, development, and related democracy-­assistance programs continue to spark debate over the aims and strategic interests b ­ ehind foreign aid—­the ubiquitous 9 cooperación internacional. Critics argue that Bolivia has become a kind of “project-­protectorate” (Rodríguez-­Carmona 2009), colonized by ngos and good intentions. Or, in Steven Sampson’s terms (2002), one of many “proj­ect socie­ties,” in which aid structures simply reproduce themselves as local elites and ngos strug­gle over scarce resources. This book examines how foreign aid ideologies, about legitimate demo­ cratic personhood, participation, and justice, chafe against local meanings of social relations, po­liti­cal engagement, and conflict in the city of El Alto. In par­tic­u­lar, I follow donor efforts to promote adr through workshops, public forums, and especially through the creation of a national program of ijcs meant to pull Bolivians out of the formal/state ­legal system. I show how the unfolding (geo)politics of foreign-­funded conflict-­resolution programs have become entangled with Andean kinship practices, local po­liti­cal tactics, and postcolonial governance proj­ects. In the pro­cess, ­these ostensibly apo­ liti­cal technocratic aid programs have been hyperpoliticized in Bolivia—as they have in other countries targeted by U.S. democracy assistance, such as Egypt and Rus­sia.10 The stated aim of El Alto’s ijcs—­like the one where I met Luz—­has been to help Bolivians find relief for their everyday disputes outside the state ­legal system. Yet adr experts sometimes blanched when I described cases like hers ­because they seemed to undercut the very reasons that advocates celebrate conciliation: informality, mutuality, voluntariness, and a more satisfying alternative than the courts. adr advocates praise t­ hese qualities as particularly valuable in countries like Bolivia, where the justice system is notoriously despised. But this book is less about how adr should be enacted than what actually happens when foreign aid programs hit the ground—in conciliation appointments, in the streets, outside yogurt factories, and in ­people’s homes. The following chapters link intimate experience of vio­lence and economic insecurity to globally circulating aid programs that seek to transform demo­ cratic institutions and influence po­liti­cal be­hav­ior. Alteños’ use of adr offers insights into broader questions of conflict, vio­ lence, and economic precariousness in a booming Latin American city. It Introduction 7\n\nalso reveals how intimate vio­lence and economic vulnerability are entangled with larger efforts to transform demo­cratic institutions and practices. In contrast to conciliation’s small-­scale, technocratic, and therapeutic intervention, Alteños clamor for a broader conceptualization of justice—­and a demo­cratic system capable of redressing structural forms of vio­lence and economic insecurity—­even as they utilize t­ hese stopgap mea­sures to make do in the meantime.\n\nADR in an Era of Plurinationalism Anthropologists have long studied dispute-­resolution mechanisms in the communities where they work.11 ­Legal scholars once characterized the kinds of third-­party mediation that anthropologists studied in “traditional” communities as “primitive” and premodern forms of law.12 ­Those practices have since been recast as thoroughly modern and even more “civilized” than formal courts; indeed, many “Western”-­style adr programs initially took their inspiration from indigenous and popu­lar justice practices from South African Tswana to rural Mexican villages—­and from the writings of anthropologists working ­there.13 adr first gained widespread recognition during the 1970s and 1980s during the American community mediation movement, with its most famous program being the Community Boards of San Francisco.14 Professional mediation is now widely used at the level of international relations and between private corporations.15 In the Bolivian context, adr gained traction during the 1990s, as donors promoted commercial arbitration, a history I explore further in chapter 1. The appeal of informal dispute-­resolution mechanisms in Bolivia, however, owes much to two major ­factors. The first was—­and continues to be—­the widespread distrust many Bolivians feel t­ oward the state l­egal system, as well as other state bureaucracies.16 As the anthropologist Daniel Goldstein has argued, many Bolivians living in marginalized neighborhoods experience the law not as “a force for ordering ­things and making them knowable and predictable . . . ​but [rather] something that in local perspective is barely distinguishable from illegality” (2012: 7). Bolivians endure endless trámites (paperwork) and accompanying coima (small bribes) as they navigate labyrinthine bureaucracies; poor and especially indigenous Bolivians report subtle disregard and outright humiliation at the hands of European-­descendent and mestizo bureaucrats. Goldstein has characterized the arbitrary application of Bolivian laws and regulations as a pro­cess of “disregulation,” a “manufacture of or­ga­nized disorder that is fun8 Introduction\n\ndamental to con­temporary urban governance” (2016: 237). Disregulation is not just a m ­ atter of state institutions lacking the technical skills or resources to more systematically apply existing laws or to ensure that their agents are informed about proper protocol. Municipal authorities benefit from keeping poor Bolivians in a state of permanent “suspended animation,” extracting fines and fees from poor itinerant vendors who circulate without proper registration (237). By allowing the urban poor to continue to operate outside formal regulation, government authorities never have to resolve the root ­causes of their precarious livelihoods—or offer real alternatives. Horror stories about Bolivian bureaucracy are so notorious and widespread that while I conducted fieldwork in 2011 the government sponsored a competition for “el peor trámite de mi vida,” or “the worst bureaucratic paperwork experience of my life.”17 Among Bolivia’s many bureaucracies, it is the ­legal system and its accomplices—­police, ­lawyers, and related institutions—­ that elicit the most anger and fear. The Morales administration made “decolonizing public administration” part of its po­liti­cal platform: simplifying bureaucratic formalities, prosecuting public officials for corruption, ensuring ser­vices are available in Aymara, Quechua, and Guarani. Nevertheless, many Bolivians remain deeply skeptical of the state ­legal system’s ability to secure justice or treat them with fairness and re­spect. This is especially true for Bolivians whose vulnerability to bureaucratic mistreatment is amplified by scarce financial resources, darker complexions, or other markers betraying their lower-­class status. It is in this context that informal conflict resolution and pro bono ­legal ser­vices hold such appeal. The second ­factor contributing to adr’s appeal is the historical confluence of donor platforms and social movement demands. The push for ­legal pluralism in Bolivia intensified in the 1990s as social movements and public intellectuals agitated for the recognition of cultural difference and indigenous autonomy.18 To stake their claims, activists built on the intellectual work of the Katarista movement, and drew on globally circulating rights language rooted in international treaties such as the International ­Labour Organ­ization’s Indigenous and Tribal ­Peoples Convention (169), ­adopted in 1989.19 During this same period, Bolivia embarked on a series of reforms aiming to decentralize state administration and bud­geting practices (see chapter 1).20 Critics such as Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui (2012) have argued that state reforms ­adopted a superficial, folkloric/ornamental, and essentialist mode of multiculturalism that masked continued social, po­liti­cal, and economic inequalities and softened the effects of stringent Introduction 9\n\neconomic reforms. Nevertheless, t­ hese policies formally embraced the coexistence of multiple ­legal ­orders and created new ave­nues for po­liti­cal mobilization.21 In 2009, Bolivia’s Constituent Assembly redrafted the po­liti­cal ­constitution of the state, launching the Plurinational State of Bolivia: one country, many nations contained within. Often glossed as usos y costumbres (customary law), indigenous, aboriginal, and peasant justice is now codified, alongside indigenous autonomy.22 In the years since its adoption, however, social movements, anthropologists, and government ministries have wrestled with how to meaningfully enact the constitution’s promise of indigenous sovereignty: where are ­those borders? Are ­there limits to indigenous jurisdiction for crimes like rape and murder? What does decolonization mean for the many millions of Aymara, Quechua, and Guarani Bolivians who make their primary residence in urban centers, and who are embedded within multiple social networks and associations—­ranging from urban trade ­unions to rural cabildos (indigenous councils)?23 When I first began researching foreign-­funded adr and affiliated “access to justice” programs, a number of ­people suggested I should be studying indigenous conflict-­resolution mechanisms if I wanted to see au­then­tic forms of popu­lar justice and understand Bolivia’s effort to put that much-­promised ­legal pluralism into practice. They pointed to the flexibility of community justice. ­These oral, dynamic, and nonrigid practices, they argued, resist stable definitions and institutionalization, raising questions about the effects of codifying such practices. Scholars and activists I met w ­ ere busy cata­loguing the variety of conflict-­resolution practices in rural hamlets. Such proj­ects paralleled efforts to promote “Western-­style” adr in cities like El Alto, Santa Cruz, and La Paz.24 Advocates have dubbed t­hese twin efforts morcs (metodos originarios, or aboriginal/indigenous methods) and marcs (“metodos alternativos,” or alternative dispute resolution methods), presenting them as parallel—if distinctive—­frameworks. Both approaches aim to decenter the state ­legal system from ­people’s lives. As I show in the second half of the book, popu­lar understandings of ­legal pluralism enacted through autonomous regions may reproduce a billiard-­ball image of ­legal pro­cesses, where “Western” and “indigenous” practices are seen as disconnected systems allowed to coexist. By contrast, I demonstrate how ­these ­legal systems and practices are in fact deeply interpenetrated.25 Nevertheless, the appeal of informal dispute ­resolution—in institutional settings like the ijcs or movements for indigenous sovereignty—­owes much to this larger historical context. 10 Introduction\n\n­ fter several years working with Bolivian activists and social movements A (see “Uprising”), and in conversation with Bolivian scholars such as Rivera Cusicanqui and Pamela Calla, I deci­ded not to focus my attention on movements for indigenous autonomy and ­legal pluralism. Instead, I turned my analytic lens to programs that have supported ­those movements—­and sometimes aimed to change them, or, that have provoked their ire. I turned to the donor-­backed proj­ects targeting the city of El Alto—­and Bolivian democracy more generally—­through the promotion of adr. Debates over the aims and effects of adr are not unique to Bolivia. Much of the vast practitioner lit­er­a­ture describes adr techniques and theorizes best practices for achieving good outcomes.26 By contrast, early critical analyses of adr centered on ­whether informalism extended the reach of state power into the lives of citizens via nonstate forms, while ­others pointed to the ways that prac­ti­tion­ers and community mediation programs resisted that state-­ expansionist proj­ect.27 A number of adr’s early critics argued that it merely serves to control and channel other pos­si­ble (and perhaps more radical) expressions of community organ­ization and po­liti­cal dissent while producing a hegemonic “ideology of mediator neutrality” or “harmony ideology.”28 Indeed, early critics of informalism maintained that neighborhood justice centers like ­those operating in El Alto or San Francisco w ­ ere not innocent of po­liti­cal aims. Richard Hofrichter (1982), for example, suggested that private dispute resolution served to “dampen class conflict” by redirecting ­people away from class-­based organ­izing and collective action. Rather than seeing themselves as aggrieved groups demanding redress as a collective, ­people come to see themselves as private consumers pursuing the satisfaction of their individual complaints (1982: 240). What adr advocates celebrated as a decentralized, participatory approach to resolving conflict, detractors saw as a managerial scheme that obscured broader patterns—­erasing politics entirely. As Christine Harrington concurred, “The origins of ­these prob­lems are depoliticized or ignored, and the resolutions are internalized by the individualized form of participation. Conflict in this setting is absorbed into a rehabilitative model of minor dispute resolution” (1982: 62). Ugo Mattei and Laura Nader (2008) have pushed the critiques further. They argue that the entire “rule of law” paradigm—­including the international export of adr—­ enables elite actors to plunder poor nations.29 It does so by encouraging poor countries to “harmonize” commercial laws with international standards and enact privatization schemes that serve the interests of foreign investors and national elites, while undercutting more antagonistic forms of seeking justice, such as street protest. Introduction 11\n\n­ ese assessments point to the multiple meanings of key terms in conflict Th analy­sis and resolution. How something is defined—as a means of re­sis­tance or a mechanism of control—is deeply po­liti­cal and historically contingent, revealing the diversity of approaches taken by p ­ eople and organ­izations appealing to informalism. Yet donor platforms advocating adr often obscure ­those contingencies by presenting adr as a natu­ral outgrowth of native traditions and more humanistic approaches to achieving justice. Th ­ ese debates and accusations are particularly pertinent to the Bolivian context, where recurring po­liti­cal upheaval is coupled with distrust of l­egal bureaucracies—as well as skepticism over foreign-­funded proj­ects aiming to displace them with substitutes such as adr. The ­legal scholar Amy Cohen (2006) has criticized the debate over adr in the United States for its emphasis on abstract aims—­focusing on what adr is meant to do, ­whether it is a tool of liberation and empowerment or purely one of social control. By contrast, Cohen argues for focusing primarily on adr in practice around the world. In many ways this proj­ect responds to Cohen’s call. I would argue, however, that separating the two questions—­ abstract aims versus local applications—­fails to account for the full picture of how t­hese concepts and practices travel as development models. It also misses the ways that abstract donor aims come to circumscribe the terms of the debate by determining which kinds of work get funded. Failing to attend to the intentionality b ­ ehind ­these programs and the ways local practices sometimes converge with donor agendas can err on the side of celebrating complexity at the expense of recognizing hegemony. How has informal dispute resolution become, to borrow a concept from Kay Warren and David Leheny (2010), an “inescapable solution”? How did such conflict-­ resolution programs emerge as a component of democracy-­assistance programs more broadly—in Bolivia and other “conflict-­prone” parts of the world? What impact have they had on po­liti­cal strug­gles and the lives of the p ­ eople they touch? What do they reveal about efforts to shape democracy in Bolivia? I propose we approach ­these questions through the lens of what it means to “domesticate democracy.”\n\nDomesticating Democracy Democracy means a lot of dif­fer­ent ­things to dif­fer­ent ­people, be they electoral observers in Venezuela or neighborhood activists in Detroit. As a system of government, democracy is, at its core, the ability of p ­ eople to exercise power over the decisions that affect their lives. Accounts of liberal de12 Introduction\n\nmocracies frequently stress the countervailing forces of individual freedoms and institutionalized constraints: what puts liberal in liberal democracy is the preoccupation with protecting liberty—­and the grounding of that liberty in rights-­bearing individuals. But ­these commitments, liberals argue, must be accompanied by mechanisms for protecting minority groups from the potential abuses of majority rule. Although democracies are frequently assumed to extend universal suffrage to all citizens, voting rights have been a hard-­won ­battle for many groups in formal demo­cratic states. In Bolivia, questions of substantive democracy have pivoted around the exclusion and ­later managed—or what Rivera Cusicanqui calls a “conditional”—­inclusion of the country’s indigenous majority; historically, po­liti­cal and economic power has been consolidated in the hands of ruling Euro-­descendent and mestizo elites. In describing liberal democracy, many ­people cite a litany of characteristics, ranging from ­free and fair elections, to mechanisms that prevent the consolidation of power in any one governing branch (“checks and balances”), to par­tic­u­lar values such as tolerance and pluralism as reflective of a demo­cratic ethos. Democracy also is associated with a ­whole host of rights, including freedom of the press and of association; freedom of information, speech, and movement; private property owner­ship; and religious freedom. Rather than taking categories like “democracy” or typologies of demo­ cratic governance for granted, anthropologists frequently emphasize that po­liti­cal forms and practices are not so easily segregated into demo­cratic or not demo­cratic. We learn more, perhaps, by understanding how and u ­ nder what conditions ­people who are “differently situated in relations of power” characterize something as demo­cratic or not (Paley 2002: 471). As I found while conducting research in El Alto, the same po­liti­cal tactics some activists described to me as undeniably and even radically demo­cratic, ­others characterized as grossly antidemo­cratic, authoritarian, and a violation of individual rights (Ellison 2015). Similarly, Matthew Gutmann reflects, “Democracy’s very multivalence is a key reason for the zeal with which so many ­people have employed the term to dramatically dif­fer­ent ends in recent history.”30 Paying attention to the micropolitics through which t­ hese meanings are consolidated, negotiated, or disputed provides insight into what democracy means to ­people in practice.31 Timothy Mitchell has taken the argument about democracy’s multiple meanings further, stating that it can refer to ways of making effective claims for a more just and egalitarian world. Or, it can refer to a mode of governing populations Introduction 13\n\nthat employs popu­lar consent as a means of limiting claims for greater equality and justice by dividing up the common world. Such limits are formed by acknowledging certain areas as ­matters of public concern subject to popu­lar decision while establishing other fields to be administered ­under alternative methods of control . . . ​(2011: 9) As component parts of larger democracy-­assistance programs, the practices of judicial reform, good governance proj­ects, training workshops targeting civil society, and adr programs are enmeshed in ­these strug­gles.32 Research on U.S. democracy assistance has tended to focus on (1) the ­intellectual and institutional history of democracy promotion as a form of U.S. foreign policy and aid intervention;33 (2) both the declared and the strategic (that is, undeclared) intent ­behind individual American administrations and par­tic­u­lar democracy-­promotion paradigms;34 (3) lessons learned or “best practices” in the field of democracy-­assistance implementation;35 and (4) the challenges of quantifying and mea­sur­ing the impact of democracy-­promotion interventions.36 Many of ­these proj­ects reflect a normative commitment to liberal democracy as a proj­ect worthy of refinement and dissemination. By contrast, critics of U.S. democracy assistance in Bolivia have tended to analyze it almost exclusively as a tool of imperial expansion. They see the United States as a puppeteer that uses covert mechanisms to direct local ngos and government ministries t­oward ends that are amenable to U.S. strategic interests—in collaboration with national elites.37 Such analyses criticize the liberal ideologies and strategic objectives expressed in declassified (or WikiLeaked) cables between the American mission and the U.S. State Department, but they offer l­ittle sense of how democracy-­promotion ­programs operate on the ground or what effect, if any, they produce. Instead, they frequently remain at the level of intentionality and ideology. ­Doing so, however, flattens the complicated history and po­liti­cal terrain of ngo work and development-­assistance programs in Bolivia—as in other parts of the world.38 Democracy promotion, judicial reform, and adr are not the sole property of the United States or usaid. Conflict-­resolution programs share a number of assumptions that crosscut other kinds of development aid (i.e., ­women’s empowerment proj­ects or participatory bud­geting), ­whether they are run by usaid or funded by other donors on friendlier terms with the Morales administration. Further, it would be a ­mistake to conflate participation in ­these programs with being right-­wing or anti-­Morales, given Bolivia’s 14 Introduction\n\nl­ ong-­standing reliance on foreign aid and ngos. As a consequence, many Bolivians across the po­liti­cal spectrum have found work with foreign-­funded development proj­ects, ­whether they ­were program designers, ­water engineers, or ­drivers of jeeps that transported German aid workers to remote outposts.39 Focusing exclusively on U.S. strategic interests, while understandable given the pattern of interventionism spanning from the Monroe Doctrine to the Cold War and beyond, may miss the subtle ways ­these programs operate as techniques of governance. It also tends to narrow our focus to aid directed to groups that Morales identifies as his opposition (even if that is a shifting category). It further narrows our analy­sis of informalism to U.S. foreign aid, rather than reckoning with the larger constellation of donor institutions that share similar approaches and assumptions about the social, economic, and po­liti­cal good produced through adr. Much like debates over informalism in the United States, the challenge remains the linking of critical analyses of operating ideologies with the lived effects of t­hese proj­ ects. I suggest we might think about adr as one technique of domesticating democracy. Domestication helps us get at the stated and strategic aid objectives of democracy-­assistance programs, the suspicions they generate, and the effects they produce in ­people’s lives. Domesticate is a po­liti­cally charged verb. It suggests an effort to control, tame, break, or train. For po­liti­cal activists wary of co-­optation, it suggests an attempt to neutralize opposition. Within the Morales administration, it’s about subterranean efforts to subjugate Bolivians to imperialist proj­ects. Indeed, donors and local contractors sometimes articulated their objectives to me through the equally charged language of pacification (apaciguar, or to calm, appease, pacify, or mollify an angry population). Ironically, critics have accused the Morales administration of operating with a similar disciplinary attitude ­toward its internal critics. I use the term b ­ ecause it captures something of the operating logic ­behind democracy-­assistance programs, but also the ways critics perceive them—on several registers. Both donors and adr advocates characterized their efforts as cultivating not docile populations (that is, subjugated to external control), but rather more constructive ones (agentive, autonomous citizens who make their/the nation’s ­future). They insist they ­don’t want tame Bolivians, but rather Bolivians capable of negotiating their demands through established demo­cratic channels and t­oward productive ends, promoting the common good rather than divisive sectorial interests. But that is the point of my argument about domestication’s many valences. adr programs fit within a larger Introduction 15\n\nassemblage of institutions and reformers seeking to mold par­tic­u­lar kinds of citizens out of “conflictual” Bolivians. The question is not ­whether democracy-­assistance programs encourage Bolivians to have a say, it’s what kind of voice they should use to articulate ­those claims. Donor representatives with whom I spoke lamented not ­Bolivian apathy before politics—­frequently the object of po­liti­cal empowerment proj­ects—­but rather overly bellicose modes of po­liti­cal participation.40 That is, a recurring concern among democracy-­assistance programs is not about a lack of po­liti­cal engagement, but rather about a tendency to engage in forms of po­liti­cal action that critics deem destabilizing, illiberal, or authoritarian. ­Those critiques sometimes conflate street protest and property destruction with physical vio­lence, characterizing all three as threats to a functioning, stable democracy. Yet adr advocates point to the very real physical vio­lence that erupts during both po­liti­cal disputes and intimate ones. Domestication, therefore, refers to the pro­cesses through which conflict-­resolution programs seek to discipline disruptive po­liti­cal tactics in the ser­vice of demo­cratic governability, as well as to deescalate and displace physical vio­lence as a means of resolving disputes. Thinking about what it means to domesticate democracy further invokes ideals of national sovereignty: the domestic as dominion over one’s own country. To what extent do Bolivian po­liti­cal leaders and citizens choose their own path, and to what extent have multilateral donors, foreign governments, and corporations s­ haped domestic policies? ­These questions have haunted development aid in Bolivia since the 1950s, when tensions arose, for example, over the “inherent asymmetry” of U.S.-­Bolivia cooperation in the healthcare sector (Pacino 2016: 30). As the historian Nicole Pacino argues, during the Cold War era, the Bolivian “Health Ministry’s reliance on U.S. financial and technical assistance for developing a national health program was a source of wounded Bolivian pride and internal orga­nizational friction” even as both governments benefited from the relationship (2016: 30). ­Under the Morales administration, Bolivia has confronted the role that vari­ous international donors and multilateral agencies have played in shaping (some would say dictating) its national policies: remaking Bolivia’s economy, funding basic infrastructure and social services—­often in the wake of t­ hose same economic reforms—­and prosecuting the drug war. ­Whether through plans to export lithium reserves to China, talk of nuclear power plants with Rus­sia, or close diplomatic relations with Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez (before his death), Morales has sought to displace U.S. sway. Yet ­these new po­liti­cal 16 Introduction\n\nalignments do not release Bolivia from foreign economic investments and po­liti­cal influence, but rather reconfigure how t­hese international relations shape national development proj­ects and po­liti­cal debates.41 Domestication can also refer to how liberal democracy is “translated,” “vernacularized,” “hybridized,” or “refracted” in par­tic­u­lar contexts.42 Maxwell Owusu (1997), for example, characterizes the pro­cess of domesticating democracy as the ongoing work required to transplant democracy into a new cultural-­political context; democracy is domesticated, Owusu argues, as it is adapted to a new national or cultural “soil.” By contrast to botanical meta­ phors, Shoko Yamada (2014) emphasizes how shifting conceptualizations of citizenship and democracy reflect the interests of po­liti­cal elites at par­tic­u­lar junctures, and how such elites inscribe ­those po­liti­cally useful definitions into textbooks and other civic education materials.43 For Yamada, domestic or national elites frame democracy in terms amenable to their continued rule. Thinking domestically also draws attention to adr’s entanglements with other domestics, that is, domestic policy debates internal to the United States and other foreign donors. Declassified documents convey the anx­i­eties that leftist leaders like Evo Morales provoke in Washington—as internal reports characterize Morales as a cuadillo and narco-­terrorist/guerrilla. However, as Winifred Tate (2015) has shown in her ethnography of Plan Colombia and U.S. policymaking, t­hose strategic interests are often as much about turf ­battles between Republicans and Demo­crats at “home” in the United States as they are about a perceived communist (or terrorist) threat. As Tate argues, the moniker “narco-­guerrilla” emerged as a particularly useful category to justify continued institutional funding in the post–­Cold War era, as military agencies fretted over shrinking bud­gets.44 Further, in her study of Finnish humanitarian efforts, the anthropologist Liisa Malkki explores the “domestic arts” of volunteers knitting trauma teddies distributed to ­children in war zones—­proj­ects often undertaken to deal with the volunteer’s own loneliness. Rather than dismiss ­these arts as inconsequential, Malkki insists they are revelatory of how “the practices of aiding ‘distant ­others’ . . . ​are as domestic as they are foreign—as much about ‘the home’ . . . ​as they are about any foreign elsewheres” (2015: 10). Thus multiple, embedded “domestics” inhere in any analy­sis of postconflict or democracy-­ assistance programs. Th ­ ese include the operating ideologies and the power strug­gles that occur, for example, on the floor of U.S. Congress or in po­liti­cal think tanks prior to becoming entangled with questions of national sovereignty in places like Bolivia. But they also include the ways lonely knitters find solace in the moral figure of distant suffering ­children. Introduction 17\n\nFi­nally, we might also think about domestic relations as a target for democracy-­assistance programs. Feminist scholars have long argued that “the separation of domestic (kinship) and public (po­liti­cal and economic) relations should not be presupposed but rather should be a ­matter of historical and ethnographic inquiry” (McKinnon and Cannell 2013: 13).45 ­Here, I want to underscore how aid programs imagine this relationship, as the so-­ called private realm becomes an object of intervention seeking to remake citizens and their relationship to state institutions—­and to each other. And this is where much of my own focus centers, particularly in the second half of the book. That is, how have intimate, h ­ ouse­hold relations, like the conflict between Luz and Jhonny, become the stuff of democracy-­assistance programs and related entrepreneurial citizenship proj­ects, and with what effects? How are po­liti­cal economic relations erased in the pro­cess? ­These are multiscalar moves—by me, but also by democracy-­assistance programs themselves. For many adr advocates, the grinding experiences of conflict and vio­ lence that characterize intimate relations in El Alto are matched only by the routine abuses of state bureaucracies. Alteños find themselves enduring interminable lines and bureaucratic red tape in order to obtain basic public ser­vices for their homes and to exercise their citizenship rights.46 By contrast, adr advocates argue that informal dispute resolution can spare the urban poor from the recurring indignities, frustrations, and abuses of ­legal bureaucracies as they cope with domestic tensions. adr allows clients to repair intimate relations, but it also indirectly aims to repair relations between states and their citizens—­who have been estranged by bureaucratic mistreatment. Domestication also draws our attention to ongoing efforts to redirect the solutions that p ­ eople seek for their prob­lems further inward, ­toward the intimate, interpersonal realm—­with the expectation that friendlier techniques of conflict resolution might transform Bolivian citizens in addition to liberating them from abusive and neglectful state institutions. Thus domestic-­ate gestures ­toward the ways that democracy-­promotion efforts strive to rehabilitate “conflictual” Bolivians as po­liti­cal actors and as husbands, wives, neighbors, parents, and in-­laws. By learning how to listen to one another, how to negotiate, how to work through prob­lems via better communication techniques, advocates hope adr ­will relieve tensions both in the home and in the country as a ­whole. This approach reflects a postulation about how conflict and its resolution scale up between intimate disputes and larger po­liti­cal ones. Taken together, ­these interventions reflect an ongoing effort to foster modes of citizenship I characterize as “entrepreneurial” and “counterinsurgent” in the ser­vice of demo­cratic governance and economic development. 18 Introduction\n\nEntrepreneurial and Counterinsurgent Citizens Definitions of citizenship frequently center on l­egal status—­tied to par­tic­u­ lar states, premised on certain requirements, and endowed with par­tic­u­lar rights and duties. Much as they do with “democracy,” however, anthropological approaches to citizenship move beyond ­legal categories to instead consider a broader array of emotions, practices, ethics, and claims making.47 Citizenship might be understood, as James Holston (2009) suggests, as a method of ­distributing inequalities rather than rights. Among the Mohawk of Kahnawà:ke, Audra Simpson speaks of feeling citizenship; ­under conditions of settler colonialism, feeling citizenship “may not be institutionally recognized, but [is] socially and po­liti­cally recognized in the everyday life of the community” (2014: 175). ­These are emotionally charged and shared frames of reference for par­tic­u­lar communities, “and p ­ eople get called out on them” on street corners and in tribal council meetings all the time (175). ­These more expansive understandings of citizenship include the ways p ­ eople declare their belonging to a variety of sociopo­liti­cal bodies, assert rights, stake claims to entitlements, and fashion themselves as po­liti­cal actors, ­whether or not they are officially recognized as the ­legal members of a par­tic­u­lar polity. ­These approaches also provide ave­nues for analyzing how ­people articulate what belonging or inclusion mean to them—in contradistinction to “top-­ down” efforts to produce par­tic­u­lar kinds of citizen-­subjects.48 My approach h ­ ere pivots around analyzing the kind of citizen that democracy-­ assistance programs envision—­ explic­ itly, but more often implicitly—­and how adr is implicated. When articulated through the vocabulary of citizenship, t­ hose framings often center on the unresponsiveness of state agents to citizen demands, the need to cultivate healthy expressions of po­liti­cal dissent, and debates over ­whether ­people’s rights are respected. However, I argue that adr is enmeshed in larger development paradigms and political-­economic reforms that link self-­fashioning, eco­nom­ically mobile, and financially “empowered” subjects with the rights, obligations, and proper conduct of good citizens. ­These broader citizenship proj­ects connect the actions of protesters to ­those of ambulant market vendors, and the be­ hav­ior of ­women blockading traffic during national strikes to ­those starting small businesses. What I want to emphasize h ­ ere are the ways that individual liberty, po­liti­ cal participation, and entrepreneurship get lashed up together ­under the umbrella of democracy-­assistance programs and allied development proj­ects. I describe ­these framings—­and the standards of be­hav­ior they entail—as the hallmarks of entrepreneurial and counterinsurgent citizenship. Introduction 19\n\nDemocracy-­promotion programs have roots in liberal preoccupations with protecting individual liberty, as well as cultivating and unleashing active citizens, “transforming the apathetic into the po­liti­cally active, the indolent into the productive, and the dependent into the in­de­pen­dent” (Cruikshank 1999: 25).49 Many democracy-­assistance programs c­ ouple this concern for safeguarding individual liberty (i.e., in weighing and exercising one’s conscience in po­liti­cal ­matters) with ideals of entrepreneurial autonomy. Over the last three de­cades an assemblage of institutions, including foreign donors, has encouraged Bolivians to adopt market solutions to social welfare and as an expression of individual freedom. In many parts of the world, ­Bolivia included, this orientation t­ oward the entwining of po­liti­cal and e­ conomic liberalism is often associated with “neoliberal” economic reforms. Neoliberalism, as the po­liti­cal geographer David Harvey succinctly explains, is “a theory of po­liti­cal economic practices that proposes that ­human well-­being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, ­free markets and ­free trade. The role of the state is to create and preserve an institutional framework appropriate to such practices” (2005: 2). Beyond specific policy mea­sures, however, scholars such as the po­liti­cal phi­los­o­ pher Wendy Brown argue that neoliberalism “imposes a market rationale ­ eople “who are ‘enfor decision making on all spheres” of life (2005: 42).50 P trepreneurs of themselves,’ ” the anthropologist Elizabeth Dunn explains, “flexibly alter their bundles of skills and manage their c­ areers, but they also become the ­bearers of risk, thus shifting the burden of risk from the state to the individual” (2004: 22).51 One of the most ubiquitous expressions of entrepreneurial citizenship has been the effort to extend “financial inclusion” through small loans to the poor. Microfinance is a diverse and shifting sector; broadly, it entails “the sale of standardized financial ser­vices in small quantities at high volumes. The basic product is credit, r­ unning on cycles that are usually shorter than one year, offered on a cost-­covering-­to-­profitable basis, normally with successively larger loans being issued in each cycle” (Mader 2016: 8).52 Much like the enormous variety of actors involved in democracy-­assistance programs, actors composing the microfinance sector include multilateral aid agencies, ngos, for-­profit financial institutions, think tanks, and private donors—­from Bill Gates to your aunt who made a loan to a ­woman she saw listed on the Kiva website. The microfinance industry now cites numbers ranging from 91.4 to 195 million borrowers to $100.7 billion distributed in loans worldwide 20 Introduction\n\n(Mader 2016: 10). The enormity of t­ hese numbers has been matched only by the impacts they have claimed to make. Microfinance programs have frequently targeted ­women through the language of empowerment, promoting national development through individual ­women’s increased autonomy over their bodies, livelihoods, and life choices.53 Lending programs include loans to small groups, as well as individual loan recipients, and accompanying bud­geting and business-­plan training sessions. But they also have encompassed often-­mandated workshops aimed at encouraging par­tic­u­lar bodily orientations t­ oward self-­care, reproductive health, and hygiene.54 Financial inclusion through access to credit is thus attached to other proj­ects aiming to promote w ­ omen’s empowerment through education, birth control, and courses on po­liti­cal leadership. As Sian Lazar argues, in the Bolivia context the question was not ­whether residents have a “credit culture” but rather what kind and the extent to which it is linked up with formal financial institutions (2004: 305). In El Alto, widespread practices of interpersonal lending once served as a primary source for credit—­whether through moneylenders, friends, or kin. Many of the ­stories explored in this book follow center clients who are enmeshed in complex webs of debt owed to intimate social relations and banking institutions. ­Women like Luz. What microfinance has done is connect more ­people to financial institutions and to encourage par­tic­u­lar kinds of be­hav­ior associated with being creditworthy and achieving “more efficient self-­help through credit” (Mader 2016: 2).55 Subsequent studies of microfinance have been far less enthusiastic, finding ­little evidence to support optimistic proclamations, or finding the impact it has made downright insidious.56 Nevertheless, ­those doubts have not slowed the expansion of the field. Indeed, Mader argues that the microfinance sector has largely come unmoored from the antipoverty, ­women’s empowerment goals that once motivated it; instead, “the pro­ cess of expanding microfinance becomes the end in itself,” a pro­cess Mader characterizes as the “financialization of poverty,” a mechanism for expanding the frontier of finance and extracting surplus from the poor (2016: 19). “Entrepreneurial citizenship” is thus promoted through microfinance agencies encouraging ­women to pursue credit as a means for personal and ­family uplift. It is promoted through donor institutions like the International Republican Institute, inviting small business ­owners to Washington, D.C., as “model citizens,” explic­itly linking economic liberalism and the individual entrepreneurship of small business o ­ wners to a per­for­mance of virtuous citizenship. To borrow from Hannah Appel, entrepreneurial citizenship expresses a “neoliberal Introduction 21\n\nimagination of democracy-­as-­market-­efficiency-­and-­access” (2014: 620). As I show in this book, it is further operationalized when Bolivians adopt tools of negotiation to privately manage conflicts tied to indebtedness, allowing them to repay their institutional bank loans according to schedule. In this context, programs promoting citizen-­entrepreneurs act within nodes of what the phi­ los­ o­ pher Michel Foucault (1995 [1979]) called ­“governmentality”: state agencies and ngos entice ­people to adopt new techniques of self-­reliance and self-­discipline. One of the most concrete ways to think about neoliberal governmentality is through the everyday ways we internalize norms of be­hav­ior mea­sured through per­for­mance indicators, quality assurance monitoring systems, evaluation reports, and other benchmarks of success.57 ­These appear to be neutral mechanisms aimed at ensuring we get ­things we value: transparency, accountability, and quality assurance. Yet critics have been particularly attuned to the ways that t­hese audit techniques have encouraged ­people to “identify with the goals of . . . ​increased market fitness through efficiency, empowerment, and self-­improvement” to the exclusion of other pos­si­ble life proj­ects or values (Vannier 2010: 284). And this is the crux of the tensions I explore in the chapters that follow. Alongside t­hese efforts to promote an empowered, entrepreneurial citizenry, donors, ngos, and government agencies alike have also sought to shape a mode of po­liti­cal engagement that I characterize as “­counterinsurgent.” Holston (2009) coined the term “insurgent citizenship” to describe the ways marginalized Brazilians make incursions on urban space as a means of claiming citizenship rights they had been denied. By contrast to the formal inclusion expected for citizens, historically what many Brazilians have experienced instead is “differentiated.” Differentiated citizenship refers to the gradations in rights that p ­ eople are actually able to enjoy in practice, given the per­sis­tence of exclusions based on race, class, gender, and other markers of social difference. Th ­ ese are gradations familiar to many Bolivians, particularly the country’s indigenous majority.58 Yet Holston argues that urban squatters on São Paulo’s peripheries make claims to their “right to the city” through the very ­legal frameworks that ­were used to marginalize them, deploying rights discourses, bureaucratic strategies, and the occupation of urban space to build their homes. Alteños frequently celebrate the 2003 uprising as a reflection of their rebellious and insurgent character: a willingness to put their bodies on the line for justice. Anthropologists and historians too have pointed to Bolivia’s “culture of rebellion and po­liti­cal turmoil” (McNeish 2008: 92; Lazar 2008). This form of insurgency includes the ways indigenous Bolivians have made 22 Introduction\n\nincursions into urban space marked “white” through ­legal and discursive tactics similar to t­hose described by Holston, but also through embodied, transgressive spectacles of dance and protest that make claims on po­liti­cal power beyond institutional frames.59 From social movements to the election of Evo Morales, Alteños and other indigenous Bolivians have indeed made inroads on the exercise of power, within the city and on the national stage. By contrast, I put the ­counter in counterinsurgent to characterize ongoing, top-­down efforts to transform po­liti­cal tactics deemed too conflictual amid t­ hese ­battles. Counterinsurgent citizens turn inward for the resolution of their prob­ lems rather than t­oward confrontation, and ­toward the negotiation ­table rather than street protest. In some ways, ­these approaches parallel Holston’s Paulistas, who creatively deploy land titles, liberal rights discourses, and proper bureaucratic channels to achieve substantive rights. Holston himself takes issue with the per­sis­tent “incivilities” that haunt Brazilian sociopo­liti­cal life, including graffiti and other signs of urban disorder and hostility. In the Bolivian context, reform proj­ects often distinguish between good citizenship practices and bad sectarianism, trying to steer p ­ eople ­toward the former. The latter includes ­those po­liti­cal tactics utilized by many social organ­izations—­ often criticized as authoritarian and illiberal threats to individual liberty and demo­cratic stability.60 My aim ­here is to analyze how t­ hese programs construe citizenship beyond ­legal definitions of membership, obligations, and rights to include appropriate modes of po­liti­cal participation, moderated communication, as well as economic self-­sufficiency. Many democracy-­assistance programs explic­itly understand their work as remaking Bolivians from the inside out, transforming first their dispositions t­ oward conflict, their interpersonal relationships, and, fi­nally, broader patterns of social conflict in the country. An entrepreneurial and counterinsurgent citizen demonstrates her enterprising spirit as she pursues credit and achieves economic in­de­pen­dence. She also demonstrates her responsibility as a citizen and a person in the ways she manages her interpersonal disputes. She ­doesn’t wait on the state to intervene, and when she does need to air her grievance on po­liti­cal ­matters, she channels her frustrations through designated institutional mechanisms and not street protests. She is a fully active and mature citizen not only in the realm of po­liti­cal participation (in elections, in neighborhood associations) but also in her livelihood strategies and the way she manages home economics. It is at the intersection of ­these twin efforts to promote an entrepreneurial and counterinsurgent citizenry that I locate my analy­sis of adr. adr Introduction 23\n\noperates as one “technology of citizenship” among many o ­ thers (Cruikshank 1999). This technology of citizenship links notions of active participation in demo­cratic pro­cesses and institutions with self-­governance, entrepreneurial modes of uplift, and peaceful means of conflict resolution. Yet neoliberal logics of individual “responsibilization” always exist alongside other competing ideas about what it means to be a moral person, and how moral personhood relates to social responsibility (Trnka and Trundle 2014) and economic justice (Lazar 2012). So too competing ideas about what kinds of po­liti­cal action are legitimate, including more confrontational ­tactics (Ellison 2015). What happens, then, when t­hese modes of entrepreneurial and counterinsurgent citizenship bump up against other meanings of belonging and justice? The ­people who came to the ijcs rarely talked about “citizenship” in the ways that adr advocates, donors, po­liti­cal scientists, and anthropologists did. Instead, they invoked dilemmas and disappointments couched in the language of justice and responsibility. The intersection of t­ hese two concepts might be better captured by the En­glish word accountability. Their invocation of responsibility—­applied to kin and state agents alike—­hails t­ hese modes of entrepreneurial and counterinsurgent citizenship, finding them deficient. In the ijcs, Alteños spent a lot of time talking about debts. As they sought to hold each other to account during conciliation sessions, the tabulations they made w ­ ere frequently quite explicit. They entailed debts owed, both moral and material, to neighbors, kin, and banking institutions. Clients often contrasted themselves with “irresponsible” kin, or commended ­others for being responsable in the face of economic duress, fulfilling their social and economic commitments to ­others. In a context of widespread neoliberalization, it would be easy to interpret Alteños’ appeals to responsibility through a similar frame of “responsibilization”—an indication that ­people have internalized this orientation.61 Yet as I show in the latter half of the book, ijc clients hitched notions of responsibility to a broader understanding of social obligation that entails a sustained relationship—­even if it is one that has fallen into asymmetrical disrepair. The value expressed through the language of responsibility was not about greater market efficiency but rather the ways ­people’s entrepreneurial aspirations had warped and strained their ability to meet their obligations to ­others. Th ­ ese debts, calculated on the backs of smudged envelopes or counted off on their fin­gers, ­were less about the rational management of financial resources (though that too was a concern) than an expression of disillusionment and growing distrust. Local idioms of responsibility also point to the 24 Introduction\n\nways that intimate relations can become grindingly burdensome when they are subject to prolonged economic vulnerability. As friends and kin strug­gle to cope with precarious incomes and physical insecurity b ­ ehind the walls of their domicilios—­the multigenerational compounds that shelter extended families—­they grapple with the fallout produced by their participation in entrepreneurial modes of citizenship. Mitchell has argued that, increasingly, “demo­cratic strug­gles become a ­battle over the distribution of issues, attempting to establish as m ­ atters of public concern questions that o ­ thers claim as private” (2011: 9). Following Mitchell, what happens in adr sessions is revelatory of how ­simple technical interventions aiming to improve access to (extra)­legal ser­vices can redistribute public concerns as private ones. But adr proj­ects also draw our attention to another dimension of this “­battle over the distribution of issues”: adr frames the the acceptable communicative par­ameters for how ­people might thrust ­those concerns back across the i­ magined private/public divide.\n\nADR in Action This book seeks to connect the geopo­liti­cal to the intimate and national strug­gles over justice to the everyday experiences of ­people targeted by aid programs, as well as ­those responsible for implementing them. I do so by moving from the design of donor-­funded proj­ects to the practices of ­people hired in Bolivia to administer them, to the p ­ eople whose lives are impacted by adr programs in El Alto.62 For fifteen months (2010–2011), I worked in foreign-­funded ­legal aid centers and conflict-­resolution programs, and I visited the criminal courts in El Alto and La Paz.63 As I did so, I tracked two broadly defined categories of aid interventions targeting social and interpersonal conflict in Bolivia. The first includes adr programs intended to help the general public, particularly social movements, to adopt negotiation strategies and communication tools for deescalating social and po­liti­cal conflict. The second includes the specific work of the ijcs, which offer pro bono l­ egal aid ser­vices, but promote extrajudicial mediation as an alternative to the state ­legal system.64 Both approaches endow adr with the power to facilitate personal and social transformation. resolution methods through Many adr programs promote conflict-­ training workshops, public forums, model debates (conversatorios), radio programs, and national ad campaigns. Their audiences included every­one from schoolchildren to u ­ nion leaders and state officials. I attended many such events, as well as book launches, the National Summit on Alternative Introduction 25\n\nand Indigenous Dispute Resolution, and, most recently, the 2016 Justice ­Summit (Cumbre de Justicia). I interviewed jurists and policymakers, donor representatives and aid recipients, ngo staff and workshop participants, and ­Bolivian officials at the Ministry of Justice. I also enrolled in a two-­ month-­long diploma course to understand (and receive) the training that was ­shaping a new generation of conflict-­resolution experts (conflictologos) in Bolivia. Among participants, I witnessed passionate debates about the usefulness or inappropriateness of adr models that have traveled from Harvard ­University’s Program on Negotiation, foreign law schools, and international ­donors. ­Those conversations further revealed the ways local aid “translators” or development “brokers” are putting adr programs and resources in conversation with Bolivian debates about l­egal pluralism and indigenous modes of conflict resolution.65 I also spent four months attending one of the criminal courts in La Paz—­with the aim of better understanding the challenges facing the formal ­legal system and motivating appeals to informalism. The bulk of my time, however, was spent working in one of El Alto’s six ijcs. I served in an official capacity as an intern with formal affiliation with the Vice Ministry of Justice and Fundamental Rights. I worked alongside public servants, student interns, and the few volunteers who continued to return to the center even a­ fter the volunteer program had been officially phased out. Alongside interns like Angelica, who was attending to Luz’s case, I registered detailed histories of domestic vio­lence, interpersonal conflicts, and vari­ous other prob­lems that brought residents to the center—­from formalizing land titles to fights over inheritance. Our day-­to-­day tasks included orienting ­clients about their l­egal and nonlegal options, setting up conciliation appointments, and drafting transfer letters to other agencies (e.g., the forensic medical examiner, child protective ser­vices). I observed the work of center staff and sat in on conciliation sessions. Attending conciliation sessions allowed me to observe the ways staff utilized adr, how clients responded to ­those methods, and to catch the turns of phrase and complaints that ­were written out of the succinct, bullet-­pointed final accords. With the permission of all parties, I conducted in-­depth followup interviews with clients about domestic vio­lence, debt conflicts, and corruption in the justice system, among other recurring themes. Through ­those interviews, I could further situate conciliation sessions within a broader array of conflict-­management strategies ­people in El Alto employ outside such institutions, including the use of kin, neighborhood associations, and rural indigenous community leaders (Mallkus). 26 Introduction\n\n­ ecause I was working as an intern at the center, the position posed unique B ethical challenges for how to best approach ­people whose stories and experiences I wanted to follow more closely through follow-up interviews. ­People often approached the intern desk where I sat with difficult issues on their minds—­and I never wanted anyone to feel that they had to assent to participating in my study before getting access to center resources or other help. As a consequence, I would approach ­people ­after their intake sessions ­were over, ­after they had their conciliation invitations and other necessary documents arranged, and sometimes weeks ­after we had first met, to ask w ­ hether I might interview them further about their experiences. Nearly every­one I asked said yes, as long as I could work around their busy lives rearing ­children, selling produce in the market, or traveling long distances hauling merchandise for other vendors. I interviewed ­women butchers outside their corner shops and prestamistas (moneylenders) as they leafed through bits of collateral in their homes. I spent many hours sharing tea and flaky empanadas as w ­ omen mapped out their debts and detailed histories of vio­lence in their lives. I flipped through cosmetic magazines as Mary Kay vendors tabulated sales and recounted strug­gles to obtain child support from estranged husbands. I listened in as b ­ rothers and s­ isters quietly debated how best to care for a disabled sibling a­ fter their el­derly parents died. ­These men and w ­ omen ­were incredibly generous in allowing me to ask questions about difficult and sometimes embarrassing topics, and they offered their own theories of and insights into the challenges they w ­ ere facing. I hope that chapters 4, 5, and 6 in par­tic­u­lar help put some flesh, sweat, and tears into an other­wise abstract debate about adr, foreign aid, and crumbling U.S.-­Bolivia relations. In addition to the clients of adr, however, I also spent a ­great deal of time speaking with its prac­ti­tion­ers. adr is, for its advocates, an ethical field, a concrete means to contribute to the social good, a practice that enables intimate partnerships and large social movements to transform vio­lence into constructive solutions, and a valuable mechanism to rescue potential victims from abusive l­egal bureaucracies. The p ­ eople I met working as conciliators, ­running conversatorios on peaceful conflict resolution, and training ngo workers and public servants in negotiation tactics w ­ ere a varied bunch, po­ liti­cally and socioeco­nom­ically. They came to their work in adr along dif­fer­ ent paths. Some ­were militantes of the Movement ­Towards Socialism (mas) party and ­others w ­ ere university students ­eager to gain experience for their résumés. Some ­were ­lawyers, and ­others ­were ­house­wives ­eager to cultivate Introduction 27\n\ndimensions of themselves beyond childrearing. But they almost all articulated ­ oing some proyectos de vida (life proj­ects) rooted in “making a living, while d good” (see chapter 3). Take, for example, Dr. Paloma Gil and the law intern Azucena, whose story opens chapter 1. The enormous re­spect that Paloma inspired in neighborhood residents, leaders, former volunteers, and center staff was palpable. Paloma began working with the ijcs as a volunteer while they ­were ­under the auspices of usaid. She was l­ater hired as a center director, and I met her as a public servant of the Morales administration. Paloma was driven by a fierce commitment to stopping the endless cycle of bureaucratic inertia that left residents of El Alto fumbling their ways between ­legal and administrative offices with no relief in sight. She wanted to be that relief. Like Dr. Paloma, the staff and interns at the center where I spent my days ­were often empathetic with their clients, outraged at the institutional deficiencies and discrimination they faced, and troubled by the grim ­family situations they encountered. They also ­were ser­vice providers who made ­mistakes, grew weary with difficult clients (and prodding anthropologists), and engaged in routine office politics and gossip. Some reproduced racialized ideologies about “conflictual” Indians, while o ­ thers ­were active leaders in the effort to implement indigenous ­legal sovereignty in places like Jesús de Machaca. Many of them w ­ ere facing strug­gles not unlike ­those of their clients: they grappled with ­family conflicts and debt burdens and sought professional opportunities for ­career advancement. They also generously shared with me the ambivalence they felt t­oward donor objectives. They strug­gled with uncertainty regarding their real contributions to their clients’ lives. And they reflected on their aspirations for the justice system, the country, and their own families. For all that and more, I am enormously grateful. It is my hope that in turn, my critical analy­sis of the workings of adr is recognizable to the ­people who are featured ­here. They may disagree with my conclusions—or find that the issues I choose to highlight are irrelevant to their own purposes.66 But it is my hope that they feel I have represented them as multidimensional p ­ eople wrestling with multidimensional dilemmas. A note on my use of pseudonyms: all the names of center clientele have been changed, as have ­those of bureaucratic staff, interns, and volunteers. The same goes for the names of most ngos appearing in the book, although they ­will likely be recognizable to a Bolivian audience familiar with their well-­known work on t­hese themes. The names of public intellectuals and prominent activists speaking at public events, as well as government officials 28 Introduction\n\nand foreign aid representatives speaking in their institutional capacities, remain unchanged.\n\nOrgan­ization of the Book The book that follows is divided into two parts. In the first, I focus on the history, politics, and practices of foreign aid programs, and I follow the experiences of the ­people tasked with implementing them: aid workers, development professionals, and volunteers responsible for the spread of adr in Bolivia. I open the second half of the book with a short “Recess,” in which I describe life in the Alto Lima neighborhood and point to the ways the ijc operating t­ here exemplifies strug­gles over l­egal pluralism in Bolivia. Following this brief, scene-­setting interlude, the second half of the book focuses on the everyday work of one center; the efforts of volunteers, professional staff, and interns; and, especially, the experiences of its clientele. While my research was primarily located in District 6, I conducted interviews with the directors, staff, and interns working at both El Alto’s and La Paz’s centers, and I draw on their perspectives for comparative purposes. Their stories illuminate a significant tension between the causal relationship that adr advocates ascribe to interpersonal and social conflict in El Alto and the ways Alteños themselves experience that causal relationship. As I show in ­these final three chapters, many adr advocates I spoke with saw conflict as “scaling up” from the interpersonal to the social—­that is, social conflict was generated by p ­ eople’s failure to find redress for everyday experiences of interpersonal conflict. In this conceptualization of conflict, if we fix the micro dimensions of conflict (e.g., by teaching ­people interpersonal conflict-­resolution skills), we can fix the macro (widespread protests, blockades, and other disruptive approaches to demanding redress). adr programs have accompanied ongoing waves of aid intervention that have sought to produce what I characterize as entrepreneurial and counter­ insurgent citizens in Bolivia, as in many other parts of the world. Th ­ ese broader development platforms do so by conflating market access and efficiency with democracy, and good citizenship with orderly po­liti­cal participation and entrepreneurship.67 Against this narrowing of political-­economic imaginations, social movements have occupied streets and redrawn consti­ eople tutions, to varying degrees of “success.”68 And yet, in the meantime, p like Luz and Justa, Manuela, and Lourdes—­whom you ­will meet—­frequently turn to ­these very same donor proj­ects to deal with the fallout produced by their participation in development proj­ects’ entrepreneurial invitations. Introduction 29\n\nIndeed, conciliation programs allow Alteños like Luz to manage the intimate conflicts and economic uncertainty that neoliberalism has wrought in their lives, to find some redress for their grievances. But their use of adr does not blind them to the political-­economic roots of their woes. Instead, residents of El Alto regularly point to the macro political-­economic dimensions of ­those conflicts, repoliticizing intimate disputes—­even as they seek immediate relief through the resources that adr offers in the meantime.\n\n30 Introduction\n\nUPRISING\n\nIt’s October 2003, and residents of the city of El Alto have laid siege to Bolivia’s adjacent seat of government, La Paz. Although the flashpoint of the uprising was the export of Bolivia’s natu­ral gas supplies, the popu­lar protests express a deeper dissatisfaction with neoliberal economic-­development policies and the state of demo­cratic institutions in the country.1 Protests in El Alto escalated rapidly ­after the military opened fire on residents in the rural Altiplano town of Warisata, killing several p ­ eople, including a child. ­People are still reeling from news that the military descended on the town in he­li­cop­ters in order to break up a blockade t­ here and to “liberate” tourists trapped in the nearby vacation destination, Sorata. The intervention, however, only succeeded in enflaming widespread anger about the government’s use of vio­lence to suppress protests. It proved to be a crucial turning point in helping to galvanize the disparate protests taking place in El Alto and surrounding rural hamlets. Now, ­those protests rally around a common ­battle cry: gas for Bolivia and the resignation of Bolivia’s president, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada (or “Goni” as he is commonly known). As the government’s repression increases, the demand for President Sánchez de Lozada’s resignation intensifies. I have been working as the facilitator for a national network of Bolivian grassroots groups, ngos, and faith-­based organ­izations that have joined together to look at the structural ­causes of poverty in Bolivia. In February, I had watched curling smoke plumes rise from neighborhoods in downtown La Paz as protesters burned government buildings and po­liti­cal party headquarters. Stopped by my neighbor from venturing out, I instead watched from my apartment, located high on one of La Paz’s steep laderas (hillsides) facing El Alto, Villa Copacabana. The February vio­lence was provoked by a new tax\n\nsystem pushed by the imf. Angered by the new policies, Bolivia’s police force abandoned their posts and took to Plaza Murillo (home to the Presidential Palace and Congress) to protest. ­There, they ­were joined by young students from a nearby school. The protests turned deadly. The military fired on the crowd of rock-­throwing students, and police shot back at the military using their own ser­vice weapons. For several days afterward, the wafting traces of burning buildings and paperwork filled the crater of La Paz. Now, in October, I watch once again as tear-­gas plumes and smoke hover around the city. This time, they rise from blockades that burn where the cities of La Paz and El Alto meet.2 Street traffic vanishes as the stranglehold grows tighter. Airlines stop ­running. Food shortages strip the markets bare. Friends concerned about me, a young foreign w ­ oman living alone, walk several miles to bring me a wilted head of lettuce they managed to stockpile before foodstuffs grew scarce. A neighbor’s f­amily secretly makes bread in their bakery’s large brick oven, dispensing it to their closest relatives. One brings me a gift of still-­warm, crusty marraqueta. I offer her a few eggs in return. For ­those of us living in La Paz, we can only imagine what is happening in El Alto by listening to radio reports and talking anxiously with friends ­there. As news of more deaths and injuries comes in, ­people call radio stations pleading with neighbors to let ambulances through the blockades. One dj begs, “If any health center is listening to this broadcast, please send help to . . .” But emergency vehicles c­ an’t respond. They have no gasoline. The wounded and dead must be wheelbarrowed to makeshift hospitals or morgues. Several stations continue to offer live updates even as they receive threats of military intervention. Neighbors gather to protect them. Listeners call in sobbing, terrified by what is happening, pleading with the government not to kill more ­people. ­Others speak with hushed voices, expressing their pain and shock. One caller identifies himself as a conscripto, a young soldier fulfilling his mandatory military service—­prob­ably a kid just out of high school.
