IT'S MY PARK DAY IN THE BRONX Solid Waste Management Plan Must Be Comprehensive The New York League of Conservation Voters, which works to make environmental sustainability a top political priority in New York, today called on all New York City mayoral candidates to support the comprehensive approach to solid waste as embraced in the current Solid Waste Management Plan. Passed in 2006 with strong support from New Yorkers, city leaders and environmental organizations, the Solid Waste Management Plan revolutionized the way New York handles its garbage. Prior to the plan’s implementation, the overwhelming majority of the city’s garbage was trucked into low-income and minority neighborhoods outside of Manhattan. For decades, those communities faced disproportionate environmental burdens including noise, reduced air quality and odors. The Solid Waste Management Plan addressed this environmental injustice by requiring each borough to handle its own share of waste. The plan also helped clean the air and reduce quality-of-life complaints by establishing a system of marine transfer stations to reduce truck traffic and transport waste more efficiently. The locations of the marine transfer stations were carefully selected after exhaustive studies and community input. “The strength of the Solid Waste Management Plan is its comprehensive nature. If one marine transfer station in Manhattan is eliminated, the burden simply shifts back to other stations and other boroughs – undermining the success of the entire effort,” said NYLCV President Marcia Bystryn. “Environmental and environmental justice organizations fought for the current Solid Waste Management Plan for many years. New York must not go back to the polluting and unfair ways of the past.” The New York League of Conservation Voters (NYLCV) was founded in 1989 as a nonpartisan, policy-making and political action organization that works to make environmental protection a top priority with elected officials, decision makers, and voters by evaluating incumbent performance and endorsing and electing environmental leaders to office in New York State.

Federal immigration reform proposals are moving quickly in Washington DC and both the US Senate and House of Representatives are scheduled to pass the legislation in June and August respectively. “Passage of immigration reform will open flood gates of immigrants seeking assistance with federal requirements and fraudulent immigration services providers are already lining up to strike thousands of victims,” stated Assemblyman Marcos A. Crespo, Chair of the Assembly Task Force on New Americans. In the spring of 2011 a sweep by federal and New York City law enforcement agencies found over 220 immigration service providers operating outside the limits of the law and issued over $288,000 in fines. Surveys on this type of fraud in other major US cities have found that over 40% of immigration assistance services operations are fraudulent. According to Crespo, “Immigration assistance services fraud is a serious problem facing the more than two million New Yorkers who are non-citizens, including some 800,000 who are considered undocumented immigrants. Many immigrants looking for assistance with federal immigration matters have been defrauded and have lost their lifes savings trying to navigate our immigration system.” Senator Ruben Diaz, Sr. stated, “I am proud to be the Senate Sponsor of this important bill and I thank my co-sponsors Senators Parker and Sampson for having the courage to put their names on this legislation. The Federal Government has taken long-awaited steps to improve the lives of millions of undocumented immigrants. The time has come for New York State to do everything in its power to protect these immigrants who live all throughout our great State, from the eastern shores of Long Island to Niagara Falls and everyplace in between. Now that the Assembly has passed this bill unanimously for the second time, I am calling on the Senate leadership to bring this bill to the Senate floor for a vote before the legislative session ends.” “With federal immigration reform on the horizon and a rush of huge number of immigrants seeking to qualify for the new Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status, it is anticipated that mass scale immigration services fraud will be committed. Tougher measures at the State level to discourage and punish immigration services fraud are needed and should be in place prior to the enactment of federal immigration reform,” declared Crespo. The legislation (A.158/S.786) which passed the Assembly on May 29, 2013 via a unanimous vote increases fines, requires qualifying criteria to be able to be an immigration assistance service provider and requires such providers to be registered with the New York State Department of State and requires that they prominently display their State certification. \"Comprehensive Immigration Reform is a very real possibility, and immigrant New Yorkers will be seeking assistance to determine their best options,\" said Wayne Ho, Executive Director of the Coalition for Asian American Children and Families. \"Immigrant New Yorkers deserve reliable, credible immigration assistance services. Service providers should not take advantage of immigrants who will be making important decisions that impact the well-being of not only themselves but also their children and families. Immigration services fraud should not be tolerated, especially in New York.\" “Immigrants living in New York City who could applying to legalize their immigration status need more than ever a law that guarantees a qualified assistance to fulfill a complex immigration application process. Therefore LULAC Queens Council 23047 supports the bill proposed made by Assemblyman Crespo concerning: \"Immigrant Assistance Service Enforcement Act.\" The bill propose increases fines imposed upon those who violate laws regarding immigrant assistance services; requires certain immigrant assistance service providers to be registered with the Department of State. I invites our Latino community to support it to prevent deceptive actions of people and organizations who are not following the laws, rules and procedures, causing serious consequences for the applicants,” stated Sylvia Mata, President of the Queens Chapter for League of United Latin American Citizens. \"The NYIC commends Assemblyman Crespo and the New York Legislature for addressing the need for consumer protections against the unauthorized practice of immigration law and the provision of incompetent or unscrupulous legal services. It enhances penalties for fraudulent services; establishes a registration system for immigration legal providers and requires that they meet clear criteria for registration and renewal of registration; and imposes penalties for providers who fail to register,” stated Chung-Wha Hong, Executive Director of the New York Immigration Coaliton. “Two key elements remain to be addressed: a robust public education campaign funded by the state to increase consumer awareness so that immigrant communities know how to protect themselves against unscrupulous providers; and a clear mechanism for reporting incidents of unscrupulous and incompetent practices to ensure both enforcement and restitution, as appropriate. We look forward to working with Assemblyman Crespo and the New York Legislature to make this bill as effective as possible.” According to Alfred Placeres, Esq., Legal Director for Casa Puebla, \"This bill will help to expose those unscrupulous immigrant service providers who continue to plague our community. Protecting our New Americans from getting ripped off as they travel down the path to citizenship is something we can all support. “Last year, my organization published a report that relied on community led research where we documented that Immigration Service Providers are routinely violating the law and engaging substandard, predatory and fraudulent practices.” says Valeria Treves, Executive Director of New Immigrant Community Empowerment, “In clear contravention of the law, none the ISPs visited by the our ‘mystery shoppers’ had a required “not an attorney” sign posted, up to a quarter of them advertised that they provide legal advice; and a quarter of them falsely identified themselves as an immigration attorney office. Furthermore, 23% of mystery shoppers received legal advice on the spot and one in three ISPs visited by the mystery shoppers guaranteed success in their applications for immigration benefits, which also forbidden by law. The consequences of an immigration services scam can range from the loss of money (sometimes thousands of dollars), to immigration consequences (including deportation) to social and emotional trauma.” TCM Bargain Bin, $5.99 and up! Labels: Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, immigration reform DISTRICT COUNCIL 37 ENDORSES NYC COMPTROLLER JOHN LIU FOR MAYOR John Liu has been an ally in our union’s campaign against wasteful contracting out and a good friend to New Yorkers we serve in communities citywide. On May 28, the 300-member Delegate Assembly of District Council 37, New York City’s largest public employee union representing 121,000 active members and its Retirees Association, representing 50,000 members, voted unanimously to officially endorse New York City Comptroller John Liu for Mayor. The union’s endorsement was announced at a news conference on the steps of City Hall on May 29. DC 37 Executive Director Lillian Roberts said, “DC 37 members and all New Yorkers face a critical mayoral election this November, which could bring a truly great mayor who will end the current favoritism toward the wealthy 1% and restore government ‘for the people’— the poor and working-class people of New York City. A mayor who makes New York City’s neglected communities and the public workers that serve them a priority. With last night’s vote by our Delegates, DC 37 officially endorsed New York City Comptroller John Liu as the candidate best qualified to be that mayor.” DC 37’s endorsement came after a process of careful deliberation and evaluation of mayoral candidates seeking its support, which included an evaluation and recommendation by the DC 37 Screening Committee and the Delegates. Earlier DC 37 also held a Mayoral Forum on May 16, co-sponsored by 15 labor/community partners, where candidates seeking the union’s endorsement had an opportunity to speak and answer questions on issues of importance to DC 37 and its labor/community partners before an audience of hundreds of members. “We evaluated Comptroller Liu’s answers to tough questions — both at our Mayoral Forum and from the DC 37 Screening Committee — regarding issues of importance to District Council 37 and the communities our union members serve,” said Roberts. “We also looked at his consistent track record of actions to curtail contracting out, overspending and waste of taxpayer dollars throughout his tenure as Comptroller. DC 37 members have been able to count on John Liu’s support during our fight to protect vital services and our jobs. \"With DC 37’s endorsement of Comptroller Liu,” Roberts continued, “comes a pledge to work diligently on his behalf with our powerful, sophisticated field operations to get out the vote. This union has a proven record of successfully supporting our endorsed candidates. We look forward to putting DC 37’s mighty army of volunteers into the field to help elect New York City Comptroller John Liu as New York City’s next mayor — a mayor who truly believes in government for the people.” District Council 37 is New York City’s largest public employee union, with 121,000 members and 50,000 retirees.

Labels: Wave Hill Events June 14–June 21 Last night the Ben Franklin Democratic Club held an endorsement meeting for the two positions of Civil Court Judge in the Bronx, the position of Public Advocate, and for Mayor. Club President Ellen Feld opened the meeting by saying that there was national news coverage of the BFDC Mayoral Forum that was held last week. She added that Sunday at the BFDC headquarters (4-6 PM) will be the kick off for the Cohen for Council campaign with several BFDC already endorsed candidates such as BP Diaz, Comptroller candidate Stringer, and others to be in attendance. 81st A.D. Male District Leader Bruce Feld announced that petitioning begins on June 4th, and that the club will have its own petitions available the day before for members to pick up. President Ellen Feld said tonight's meeting was for endorsement of 2 judges, Public Advocate, and Mayor should the club choose to endorse which included the option of no endorsement also for any of the positions. First up was current Acting Supreme Court Justice Larry Schachner running for Civil Court Judge. Second was Acting Supreme Court Justice Julia Rodriguez also running for Civil Court Judge in another capacity. Both Judges had been endorsed before by the club, and were overwhelmingly endorsed again this time. Next came the position of Public Advocate, where there seemed to be a split in the club. President Feld said that there were four candidates running, and that there was also the choice of no endorsement calling for a vote to endorse or not. Councilman G. Oliver Koppell stood up to ask that \"the club vote not to endorse for the position of Public Advocate, but also vote to not endorse for Mayor tonight\". Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said that he disagreed with Koppell on not endorsing. He suggested that the club vote for Public Advocate even though the club may not vote to endorse for Mayor. He added \"There are seven candidates now for mayor and only four for Public Advocate\". Discussion continued on the subject with one member asking that the candidates appear again which can not be done said President Feld who added that the club has already heard from the candidates. State Committeewoman Helen Morik said that she agrees with Councilman Koppell's position of no endorsement for both Public Advocate & Mayor. Former State Committeewoman Marcia Alina stated that if there is no endorsement the club would look like it is not being a part of the races. A voice vote was taken to decide to endorse for the position of Public Advocate or not was to close so that a show of hands had to be taken. The vote was to endorse for Public Advocate where as several members of the club spoke on behalf of the candidates running. this vote was taken by written ballot that was announced later after all the votes were counted. It was time to endorse or not for the mayors race. Club parliamentarian Bruce Feld explained from the section in the clubs by-laws that stated that a candidate must win with more than 50 percent of the vote cast. Then the top two candidates and the option of no endorsement is voted on, and then the top candidate and no endorsement which will provide the answer. He said that this happened four years ago when the club voted and endorsed for mayor and not for Public Advocate. A question of the club having a quorum was answered with \"Yes there is a quorum present\" by President Feld. Club member Mike Heller suggested that the club not endorse for mayor now as until the numbers change as it is to close right now. Club Vice-President Paul Ellis agreed on waiting, especially since the entry of Anthony Weiner into the mayors race. Member David Kornblau said that in 3-4 weeks the bloodletting would be done, and then the club could endorse a candidate. By a voice vote of over 2 - 1 the BFDC voted not to endorse any candidate for mayor, but the executive committee could bring the endorsement vote back on the agenda at the next meeting. The results of the vote to endorse for Public Advocate was won by current State Senator Dan Squadron with 34 out of 53 votes cast. It was also mentioned that the petitions of all mayoral candidates would be at the BFDC if the candidates would leave them for club members. Left - Councilman G. Oliver Koppell asking the BFDC not to endorse for Public Advocate or Mayor. Right - Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz disagrees with Councilman Koppell saying that the club should endorse for Public Advocate even if it chooses not to endorse for mayor.

Rubén Díaz 32nd Senatorial District, Bronx County, New York MY HUMBLE SUGGESTION FOR GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO You should know that while the worst of another Great Depression seems to be over in New York State and our Governor is claiming to have balanced the budget on time for three consecutive years, nonetheless, New York continues to face difficult times and ways of finding revenue to fill its commitments. To balance the Budget, drastic spending cuts have been made in many government agencies such as the New York State Office for the Aging, The Department of Health and State & City Universities. The workforce and education of the children continue to suffer, and many non-profit community organizations have either closed their doors or suffered unsustainable cuts. You should also know that during my ten years of service in the New York State Senate, I have and continue to present, advice and introduce pieces of legislation to help New York State find additional resources without having to hurt the poor and needy. The problem with my solutions and recommendations is that they will protect the poor and hurt the pocket of the wealthy and powerful, and for some people in power; it is much easier to hit the poor and not the wealthy. You should know that this is not the first time that I have written about this, but because the Legislative Session is about to end and no one seems to care, I just want to remind you, my dear reader, of my commitment and struggle to find solutions and alleviate the burden that every year is put on the shoulders of the poor and needy of our State. You should know that there are three pieces of legislation that I have introduced in the Senate, some of which are being introduced in the Assembly by Assemblymen Marcos Crespo, Jeff Dinowitz and Brian Kavanagh. My “Dead Peasants” or “Janitors” Insurance Senate Bill 5388 and Assembly Bill 3896 introduced by Assemblyman Crespo, deals with abuse or injustices committed by some powerful companies toward their employees and their families. Despite the current bleak economic picture, corporations are reaping huge financial benefits from life insurance policies they take out on their employees and/or retirees. Corporate-owned life insurance, better known as “Dead Peasants” or “Janitors” insurance, is a life insurance policy that is taken out on low-level employees, often without the knowledge or consent of the employee, and whose families are not named as beneficiaries when the employee or retiree dies. When the employee or retiree dies, these tax free benefits are collected by the employer. Furthermore, it is believed that companies are frequently using these policies to pay for retirement benefits and other perks for their top executives. Companies that supposedly engage in the practice of purchasing these policies include Wal-Mart, Dow Chemical, Proctor & Gamble and Walt Disney. One tragic example of this practice is that of a 48 year-old assistant manager at Wal-Mart who died of a massive heart attack. The man’s widow became the lead plaintiff in a class action suit after she learned that Wal-Mart collected $300,000 from a life insurance policy it owned on him. My bill would impose a 50% tax on all benefits received by companies in New York State who take out life insurance policies on their employees or retirees. Secondly, you should know that my Senate Bill S5150, introduced in the Assembly as A4066 by Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, and A157 by Assemblyman Brian Kavanagh, deal with taxes collected when purchases are made with a credit card. A major source of failure to comply with the New York State sales taxes being remitted to the State from credit card companies who collect such taxes from their customers and instead of sending those taxes to New York State Commissioner of Taxation, the credit card companies send the taxes back to the merchant where the purchase was made. The current system relies solely on the thousands of vendors to voluntarily remit such sales taxes to the state. It is believed that the state loses more than $800 million dollars every year on these taxes. My legislation will force the companies to send those taxes directly to the state and not back to the vendors. New York State cannot possibly audit every vendor and the vendors know this. However, the processors which are paid by the vendors to deal with the issuers of credit and debit cards, and who actually get the monies from the credit card issuers, are far less numerous. They know the true sales and actually get money from the credit card companies which include the sales taxes. It is more efficient to have these processors remit the sales taxes directly to New York State instead of sending the taxes back to the vendors and then relying upon the vendors to timely and accurately submit the sales taxes. Finally, another piece of legislation that I have introduced in the Senate is S1386 which Assemblymen Marcos Crespo and Jeff Dinowitz are carrying in the Assembly as bill A4003 and bill A308. You should know that some of the biggest money-making industries in the nation are pharmaceutical companies. The same prescription drugs that we purchase in the state of New York at sky-high prices are sold in Canada at minimum cost. Buying prescription drugs from Canada will save the state close to $1 billion dollars annually. My legislation is based on a program that has operated successfully in Schenectady County since 2005. Since then, the County has realized savings of over $17 million dollars. Additionally, County prescription drug costs have increased less than 8.9% since the program’s inception. This figure compares favorably with the average of U.S prescriptions drug programs which have seen prices escalate by more than 12% each year, or 76.2% over five years. Over 90% of Schenectady County’s employees represented by two unions, CSEA and 1199, now participate in the program. Since prescription drug costs are among New York State’s highest expenditures, one way the State can accomplish this goal is by creating the New York State Prescription Medication Cost Containment Program, which would be voluntary, for participants in the Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Program (EPIC) and for New York State civil service employees and retirees. My advice to New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo is that the State must be more creative in its approach to raising revenue and controlling expenses, without relying on the usual methods of raising taxes and cutting - or in some cases eliminating programs that hurt the poor and needy and balance the Budget on their backs. Governor Cuomo should take a really good look at my three pieces of legislation. If he feels that they are good for the State, he doesn’t even have to give me credit for them - he can take them and make them his top priority and push for them as he has done for same sex marriage, abortions, marijuana and election reform. This is Senator Rev. Rubén Díaz and this is what you should know.

Labels: Jacobi Hospital Senator Rivera Calls for Greater Asthma Awareness and Support for Legislation As Asthma Awareness Month Comes to a Close Senator Gustavo Rivera, the ranking member of the Senate's Health Committee, urges Bronxites to increase their asthma awareness as part of Asthma Awareness Month and urges the passage of legislation that can help prevent or minimize the harm caused by the disease. \"Asthma is a serious, but treatable health issue that affects over 1.1 million New Yorkers, including myself\" said Senator Gustavo Rivera. \"The lack of awareness surrounding this disease - and people's inability to recognize its causes and symptoms - leads thousands of New Yorkers to suffer unnecessary complications every year. We must work to increase awareness of the causes and effects of asthma and pass legislation that will help reduce the complications that develop from the disease.\" Asthma causes approximately 301 deaths per year and 41,797 hospitalizations in New York State. It is also the leading cause of missed school days for children and workplace absences for adults. Asthma is an even a greater problem in the outer boroughs. The Bronx has one of the highest rates of asthma in city. For instance, nearly one-third (32.3 percent) of children who made asthma-related emergency room visits in 2010 were from the Bronx. Asthma attacks can be caused by triggers such as cockroaches, mold, pet dander, dust, pollen, air pollution and, in particular, tobacco smoke. A study by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that exposure to secondhand smoke was associated with an increased risk of having three or more visits to a doctor or emergency room due to wheezing in the past year. \"Tobacco smoke is one of the most common asthma triggers in our society,\" said Senator Gustavo Rivera. \" While we have implemented measure that have considerably reduced New Yorkers' consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke in the past, it is not enough to curb the great number of children and adults who suffer needlessly from asthma related illness.\" Legislation, such as the bill introduced and passed by Senator Rivera that banned smoking within 100 feet from all school entrances, can be effective in minimizing the public's exposure to suffering from an asthma attack. According to a study published in Circulation, smoke-free laws quickly and dramatically have cut the number of people hospitalized for heart attacks, strokes and respiratory diseases. The study also found that hospitalization for respiratory disease, such as asthma, fell 24 percent after the implementation of smoke-free legislation. \"We need to continue to find ways to discourage unhealthy behaviors and to keep our youth from being exposed to harmful triggers,\" said Senator Gustavo Rivera. \"This is one of the reasons why I continue to make reducing tobacco usage a legislative priority. It is also why I strongly support any effort, such as raising the minimum age to buy tobacco, that will reduce our youth's access to these products.\" To support asthma awareness, Senator Rivera is encouraging Bronxities to attend the Asthma Resource Fair at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, 1650 Grand Concourse, Bronx, NY on Thursday, May 30, 2013 from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm. Attendees will be able to interact with health educators about their asthma and receive pertinent information about the disease's symptoms, triggers and treatments. Attendees will also have the opportunity to play asthma-related games and sign a pledge to control their asthma. To avoid unnecessary asthma related complications, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene provides the following recommendations: Encourage parents/caregivers to quit smoking. Encourage parents/caregivers to talk with landlords about household problems that may trigger asthma episodes. Get regular care and know when to seek emergency care for your child. Take your child to the doctor for regular asthma check-ups, even when no asthma symptoms are present. Identify asthma triggers in the home and try to reduce or eliminate them. Tell the school that your child has asthma and provide them with a completed Medication Administration Form from your child's doctor. Promptly repair leaks, cracks, holes and ventilation problems. Contain food and garbage so they don't become food for pests. Use only safe pest control methods when needed.

The club members may choose to endorse one of the now seven Democratic candidates running or may choose not to endorse any of them. In 2005 the Ben Franklin Club endorsed Anthony Weiner, while in 2009 they endorsed Bill Thompson. As for current endorsements in the Bronx, The Bronx County Democratic Organization has endorsed Bill Thompson as has Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. State Senator Gustavo Rivera has endorsed Christine Quinn, Assemblyman Luis Sepulveda has endorsed Bill DeBlasio, and Senator Ruben Diaz Sr. has endorsed Erick Salgado. BFDC President Ellen Feld opened the Forum by saying that it would not be a debate, but that each candidate would speak for 6 minutes, and then have 7 minutes to answer questions from the audience. She mentioned that the club has already endorsed Scott Stringer for City Controller, Ruben Diaz Jr. for Bronx BP, and Andrew Cohen in the 11th City Council race. Current Public Advocate Bill DeBlasio was first up, and praised the BFDC for being a leader in the world of political clubs. De Blasio then sounded like Freddy Ferrer (when he ran mayor in 2005) by talking of a tale of two New York cities. He said that the outer boroughs have been forgotten by the current mayor, and continued to hammer Bloomberg on other items such as Living Wage, Paid Sick Leave, and Stop & Frisk. DeBlasio said that he wants to build 200,000 units of affordable housing and return City Hall to the Democrats. To a question on education DeBlasio called the mayor a dictator, and that he wants to tax the wealthy to pay for additional school programs. After DeBlasio finished current 11th district councilman G. Oliver Koppell was introduced and addressed the audience. Former City Councilman Sal Albanese was next up saying that he is the only candidate not taking corporate money, he has 11 years experience as a teacher, poverty is the main issue why many children do not do well in school, he wants to have pediatric wellness centers, and create more jobs. Upon questioning Albanese said that education will be his top priority, as well as affordable housing, and senior programs. Long shot candidate Rev. Erick Salgado was next up saying that he was born in the Bronx, but grew up in Puerto Rico. He said that he is the only Latino in the primary, and that 15 years ago he opened up the first of 3 churches in Bensonhurst. There was only one question about education where Salgado gave the standard answer of better local control of the schools. He added that he wants to rent out schools to non-profits when they are not being used. Anthony Weiner then came into the room to a throng of camera people following him. Former City Comptroller Bill Thompson was next up. Thompson spoke of his experience as President of the Board of Education saying that more progress was made back in 1999 under Rudy Crew (an educator) was chancellor then a prosecutor (without naming Joel Klein). Thompson went on to slam the mayor and City Council (without mentioning council Speaker Quinn) for changing the term limit law in 2008. He closed by saying that he would be a mayor of all New York City. On a question of education and city worker contracts Thompson said under him there was a Chancellors District that reduced class size and added revenue to failing schools to turn them around. He added that of the 76 announced new schools created by the mayor that only 2 were really new, and the others were only failed schools that were closed. On the subject of city worker contracts Thompson said that he wants to open up the books to see where there is revenue, stop outsourcing jobs, and that to many contracts are expiring due to Mayor Bloomberg not wanting to negotiate with the unions. He closed by thanking the BFDC for their endorsement in 2009 when he came close to winning, and that in 2013 with the clubs help he can win. Next up was former congressman Anthony Weiner. Weiner opened up about his grandparents who lived on Waldo Avenue. Weiner then went into how his parents settled in Queens, and that in 2005 the BFDC had endorsed him. He added that the city is now worse off then in 2005. Weiner said that he has ideas to make schools better, and how the city with its vast health related resources can improve health care of the people. Weiner then said that he was sorry for what he had done in the past, the city needs to elect a Democrat, and that he do it in 2013. On a question of mass transit cuts, Weiner said that areas such as Riverdale should have ferry service. In mentioning the high cost of the 2nd Avenue subway line, he said that there could have been ferry service every 5 minutes. He spoke about the lack of mass transit options to get to the airports, and said that he would like to see ferry service to LaGuardia Airport. Next up was current City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. Quinn said that she has been speaker of the council for over 7 years, and that she has prevented layoffs, kept fire houses open, and helped tenants. She said that she would like to see 40,000 new units of affordable housing be built, and is proud of the legislation that she has passed. Quinn said that New York can remain the safest city under her as mayor, but belives that there is to much Stop and Frisk currently. On a question of changing the term limit law, Quinn said that in 2008 Councilman Koppell (who had left by then) and thers had supported changing the law to give voters a choice. To a question of a Times article that she is overbearing, Quinn answered that she is tough, pushy, and fights every day for the city. Quinn then ended by saying that she is \"One Pushy Broad\". Current City Comptroller John Liu was scheduled to be the last speaker. It was said that he was detained in traffic and could not make it in time to attend.

Rossiné started working on his instrument c1916. The Optophonic Piano was used at exhibitions of his own paintings and revolutionary artistic events in the new Soviet Union, Rossiné later gave two concerts with his instrument (with his wife Pauline Boukour), at the Meyerhold and Bolchoi theatres in 1924. Rossiné was influenced by the ideas of Alexander Scriabin who connected sound and colour with music to produce a aesthetic synthesis – this current formed an important, almost mystical theme within Russian electronic music; through the photo-audio experiments of the 1930’s until the ANS Synthesiser (itself named after Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin- ANS) in the 1940s. Painted glass disk of The Optophonic Piano Detail of painted disk Vladimir Rossiné left the Soviet Union in 1925, emigrated to Paris where he continued to hold exhibitions of paintings and concerts of his instrument.The Optophonic Piano generated sounds and projected revolving patterns onto a wall or ceiling by directing a bright light through a series revolving painted glass disks (painted by Rossiné), filters, mirrors and lenses. The keyboard controlled the combination of the various filters and disks. The variations in opacity of the painted disk and filters were picked up by a photo-electric cell controlling the pitch of a single oscillator. The instrument produced a continuous varying tone which, accompanied by the rotating kaleidoscopic projections was used by Vladimir Rossiné at exhibitions and public events: “Imagine that every key of an organ’s keyboard immobilises in a specific position, or moves a determined element, more or less rapidly, in a group of transparent filters which a beam of white light pierces, and this will give you an idea of the instrument Baranoff-Rossiné invented. There are various kinds of luminous filters: simply coloured ones optical elements such as prisms, lenses or mirrors; filters containing graphic elements and, finally, filters with coloured shapes and defined outlines. If on the top of this, you can modify the projector’s position, the screen frame, the symmetry or asymmetry of the compositions and their movements and intensity; then, you will be able to reconstitute this optical piano that will play an infinite number of musical compositions. The key word here is interpret, because, for the time being, the aim is not to find a unique rendering of an existing musical composition for which the author did not foresee a version expressed by light. In music, as in any other artistic interpretation, one has to take into account elements such as the talent and sensitivity of the musician in order to fully understand the author’s mind-frame. The day when a composer will compose music using notes that remain to be determined in terms of music and light, the interpreter’s liberty will be curtailed, and that day, the artistic unity we were talking about will probably be closer to perfection…”Extract of an original text by Baranoff Rossiné (1916) Copyright ©Dimitri Baranoff Rossine 1997 – Adherant ADAGP – Vladimir Baranoff Rossiné.

Unlike the other missions the story didn’t really wrap up in one neat package. Why not? We accidentally skipped the mid-game pow-wow. Seriously: do not underestimate the power of the pow-wow. Once again Jem takes the GM helm and Ping and I take the player seats, bringing back Kessler and Hollis from game two, Trapped in the Void. Mike isn’t around so Stark is still absent, leaving Hollis the XO at the helm again. The DAUNTLESS is responding to a distress call from a remote colony. The colony itself is fine, but a mysterious illness is afflicting the crew of the orbiting Prospect Station. The station is actually the used up old hulk of the colony ship that carried settlers to this planet (which we spontaneously named Valora) years back. It was stripped for parts and left in orbit as a docking station and communication point, manned by a skeleton crew. So ends the intro. The DAUNTLESS is at 10 franchise dice but we don’t want a super long game, so we settle upon a 12 die mystery. There’s always a little moment of pause when we look at the total dice needed to solve the mystery. After all, with reasonably good rolls you can win 2 dice with every skill check — you can wrap up a mystery very, very quickly. Sometimes that makes things a little intimidating: everyone’s a little shy to roll the dice and potentially lock-in a chunk of the mystery. We agree that we’ve already spoken to the surface and gotten the intro, so the focus is on the station. I break the ice and open a hailing frequency to the station (successful Contact check) but narrate that all I get is a recorded message warning anyone to stay away. The tone is unmistakably hostile: they say they’ve sealed the hatches and they’ll repel anyone who tries to board. So friendly! It’s a recording so we have no idea how long it’s been in place. Kessler makes a sensor sweep of the station (successful Technology check) and announces that the station’s engines are warming up. Ping was clearly paying attention during the intro and is now taking advantage of the fact that the station is actually a decommissioned space ship to put us under a little more time pressure. Thanks Ping! We’re ready to move in but Jem decides to give us a push and reaches for the Stress dice: there’s a blaring alarm and a crewmen on the scanner yells out that the station has fired a missile at us! There’s a distinct pause, a “why does an old colony ship have missiles?” moment, and after a little consideration Jem re-describes it as some kind of a cargo pod they jury-rigged with boosters to launch it towards us. Crude but dangerous in close orbit. Clearly the act of desperate men. We embrace the idea and prepare to take our lumps. [GMs take note: Jem certainly could have just said “yes, that is a good question, why do they have missiles? Now duck!” and made the incongruous fact part of the mystery, but after he thought about it for a moment he didn’t want to so he edited instead. Either one works, so long as everyone is on the same page about whether what just happened is a) expected or b) unexpected.] The junk-missile rockets towards the DAUNTLESS and we take evasive action. Kessler gets pummeled with Stress damage, while Hollis remains cool as a cucumber and navigates the ship to a higher orbit where the would-be saboteurs won’t be able to get another shot at them. This becomes an ongoing theme for the game: Kessler takes a total of 5 Stress hits this game and Hollis takes nada, zero, zip. Space is better with space walks Leery of more drastic measures by the crew of the station, Hollis orders a boarding party to don vacc suits: they’re going to keep the DAUNTLESS at a safe distance and then space walk over. Yeah it’s true: any chance I get I suggest a space walk. Really, what’s the point of going all the way into space if you aren’t going to go for a walk? Sitting on the bridge reading sensors all day is for sissies. Since we’ve already been met with hostile force the boarding party is a mix of security and medical personal. It’s still a rescue mission, but everyone is armed and sternly ordered to defend themselves if they have to. Hollis is leading the party personally (of course) and Kessler argues that she should come along to head up the medical team (of course). That’s all just as it should be. Hollis makes a check for the space walk (successful Athletics). It’s a breeze, but I narrate that even as we drift cautiously towards the silent hulk, what we _don’t_ see is that on the far darkside of the station there are glowing trails criss-crossing the hull, like the luminescent trails of some alien snail. Dum dum dum! Are they only on the far side, or are they only visible in the dark? We don’t know. After the boarding party touches down and is milling around trying to override one of the cargo airlocks to sneak aboard, Ping decides to drum up some trouble, so she says that while Kessler is standing around taking readings (successful Technology check) she spots a hint of the glowing stuff at the edge of the darkside of the hull and wanders over — alone — to check it out. But just as Kessler’s stooping to take a closer look Ping narrates that the ethereal slime lashes out at her! She yells and recoils and the rest of the party bounds over, but by then there’s no sign of motion. Was it just her imagination? She’s frazzled and her frantic protests that “it moved!” are met with skepticism — no one listens to the person who’s already taken Stress damage on their Contact. Just like in the last game, I’m secretly angling to show different sides of our characters than we have before. Sure enough, we’re once again in different roles: faced with a medical threat to the crew and the possibility of armed resistance, Hollis is all hard-nosed authority, issuing side-arms to the boarding party and warning them to exercise extreme caution. Kessler wants to go play with goo on the hull, but Hollis is shutting her down and telling her to stick with the plan: the people on board probably need medical attention. They come first. It’s a flip (again): now Kessler is the idealist (um, scidealist) and Hollis is the close-minded by-the-book commander. After all, he hasn’t seen anything weird yet and she has. Kessler grumbles but falls in line, reluctantly agreeing to save further goo examinations until the station has been secured and the crew located. Ping doesn’t mind, because at the end of her narration she had already said that though Kessler didn’t notice it, a strand of the goo had reached up and stuck to the back of her suit… Zombies in the Engine Room Attentive readers will now notice our mistake: that little chat on the hull was the halfway point. We should have had a pow-wow to theorize about what our characters thought was going on. We did have a good roleplaying interaction, but we never discussed the actual mystery. Once inside Hollis orders the boarding party to split up into teams and secure the station (successful Contact check). Its spooky creeping through dark hallways with flashlights — still in spacesuits of course — and with my success I narrate that we have to overide the lock on the engine room because a dead crewman has sealed himself inside. The logs show that he set the engines on autopilot to fly the whole station into the sun (as soon as they finish coming online). I also add that he’s not just dead, but whole sections of his body have vanished — they’re still there in some sense, because for example his arm is still attached even though his whole shoulder has faded into non-existence. Are they invisible, warped into some lower dimension but still physically attached? As usual, we don’t know. Kessler gets the call to come examine him, but as soon as she starts Jem grabs the Stress dice and declares that the not-as-dead-as-we-thought crewman opens his eyes and grabs her. There’s a quick “wait, do you mean he’s alive or do you mean he’s a zombie” dicussion which comes down on the “he’s alive” side. More Stress damage for Kessler and then the hysterical crewman is sedated — which we rapidly decided was probably a dramatic misstep, since asking him what had happened would have been more interesting. Too late, he’s out. Kessler goes ahead and examines him (successful Academics) and uses her success to narrate a completely unrelated fact that the whole station suddenly starts shuddering. Sneaky duck! Now normally that would be fine, but this is the second to last clue and it doesn’t get us any closer to an answer. We also don’t know if the shuddering is the engines firing up to fly us into the sun or the slime on the hull coming to life godzilla style. Down to our last mystery dice, Hollis overrides the engines (successful Technology) and forced to wrap-up I describe that the goo on the hull does indeed seem to be reacting to the sudden firing of the engines (the vibrations? the radiation?) but once we cut them off it settles down. It isn’t an intelligent creature, more like a space mold or fungus. Prospect Station is saved and (theoretically) we’ll be able to tend to the other crew members, assuming we find them. The end, sort of. “I need closure on that anecdote!” I know what you’re thinking: that game wrapped up somewhat inconclusively didn’t it? Yep. We didn’t move towards answering the mystery fast enough, so when the last franchise dice got earned we still had a lot of explaining to do. As I mentioned at the outset, a big part of the problem was that we unintentionally glossed over the half-time pow-wow, so instead of solving the mystery in the second half we were still wading through random events. The details were all there, so I think with a little liberal epilogue we could have wrapped it up if we tried. A fairly simple explanation (in hindsight) is that the goo on the hull was something carried along in space that hit the hull and then spread. The crew either brought it aboard for examination or (more likely) carried it in by mistake while working out on the hull, just like Kessler with the goo on her suit. As far as treating it, we’d already seen that it wasn’t making the hull disappear, so we could have easily narrated that it behaved differently in vacuum than it did in atmosphere. InSpectres has a rule that you only earn half the franchise dice if you solve the mystery early, and I think the same penalty would fit for solving the mystery late or not at all. On the bright side we already played game four and it was a win: we learned from our mistake and made sure to pow-wow. Ben Robbins | October 24th, 2008 | InSpectres, what we played | show 2 comments hide comments Yeah you’re right — we’ve been having fun forcing a dramatic finish when all the dice are earned (using the franchise dice for story pacing) but we could just keep going. #1 d7 says: I’m quite enjoying these AP reports of InSpectres in Spaaaace! (That’s the right number of As, right?) If I remember the details of an InSpectres review, the rules say that you can’t solve the mystery until you earn all the franchise dice, but you can keep going after if you want. I got the impression that it was a “can’t finish early” rule, not a “have to solve it now” rule. I don’t yet have a copy, so I can’t look it up to find the answer. « Making the Party: Wedge Issues | all posts | Your Mission… InSpace »\n\ncc/2020-05/en_middle_0082.json.gz/line16\n\n__label__cc\n\n0.73965\n\n0.26035\n\nIt seems to me sufficient in ordinary cases with slight involvement of the pectoralis muscle to remove the fibres which are diseased from origin to insertion with a wide margin, and to reserve the entire extirpation of the muscle for more du extensive disease.

He's caught, tried, sentenced and locked up. Then what? What do the rest of us want from the roughly two million inmates currently housed in U.S. prisons? And what do they want for themselves? One group of inmates in a Kentucky prison has made an unusual choice: They're staging a production of Romeo and Juliet. Their goal? To become \"better human beings.\" Graham Shelby The Luther Luckett Correctional Complex is a medium-security prison just outside of Louisville, Kentucky. It's home to about 1100 felons and one unusual theatre company. It’s an all-inmate ensemble called Shakespeare Behind Bars. For sixteen years, the group has staged plays like Hamlet and Macbeth, doing performances for other inmates and the public. Shakespeare Behind Bars is now in rehearsals for its next production: Romeo and Juliet. Graham Shelby recently visited Luther Luckett to find out how – and why – this group of convicted felons plans to present Shakespeare’s tale of young love.

Wade case legalizing abortion in the United States on the 39th anniversary of the decision, and Terry O'Neill, President of the National Organization for Women in Washington, D.C. on where women stand in 2012. KSFR Sarah Weddington discusses what it was like to argue one of the landmark Supreme Court cases of the 20th century as a 27 year old lawyer. Few women appeared before the Court, which was all male. She actually had to argue the case twice, and won both times. Weddington talks about the political landscape at the time, when abortion was illegal and many women died from illegal procedures. She also addresses the current Court and what may happen to women's rights in future decisions. Terry O'Neill discusses women's setbacks and progress during the Obama Administration, how the political winds are blowing for 2012, and what women, men, and families should be concerned about. Topics include the economy, child care, equal pay and wage erosion, birth control, and reproductive rights.

JJ Abrams Superman with Michael B Jordan So Kevin Smith reacts when he hears the news from us J.J. Abrams’ “Superman” with Michael B. Jordan: So Kevin Smith reacts when he hears the news from us Kevin Smith is one of the largest “Superman” fans at all – and the script for the never-realized “Superman Lives” with Nicolas Cage, he has also written. Still, he knew nothing of the new “Superman” project until we tell him about it … Cult filmmaker Kevin Smith ( “Clerks,” “Dogma”) is the most famous pop culture nerd on the planet – and currently he is touring America and the rest of the world to present to his new film “Jay And Silent Bob Reboot”. We have Kevin Smith therefore met in London for an interview – and since it is well known what a huge fan of “Superman” He, of course we have the advantage of the situation used to it possible also for his opinion on the news of a new “Superman” movie to question. We have Kevin Smith therefore met in London to interview Finally, less than 24 hours earlier came out that Warner Bros. apparently with J.J. Abrams worked as a producer and director on a new “Superman” with Michael B. Jordan in the lead role. But had to our surprise Kevin Smith, who not only a fixed panel on the San Diego Comic Con keeps, but has also directed four episodes of “Super Girl” in the past two years, yet no opinion on the subject – because he in Promo -Stress even nothing at all had heard of the message: FILM STARTS: Great news yesterday … Kevin Smith: Why? What happened then? Kevin Smith: FILM STARTS: Warner Bros. apparently planning a new “Superman” movie – with J.J. Abrams as director and Michael B. Jordan in the lead role … Kevin Smith (suddenly very loud): That’s what happened yesterday? Kevin Smith (suddenly very loud): FILM STARTS: Yes. I wanted you actually ask about the project in your opinion. But apparently the news is not yet arrived with you … Kevin Smith: Oh, my God, will you kidding me? I know that J GOMOVIES.J. a deal with Warner Bros. and will work for “Star Wars 9” primarily there … At last they make the things that we have always dreamed of. Finally they use the public as a focus group. Can you remember that there was such a rumor even a few years ago – not with J.J., but with Michael B. Jordan as Superman. One would have imagined great – but the studio people have then but politely declined. Now they do such things last. I can not wait any longer. That just does so much sense. J.J. is easily one of smartesten filmmakers in the business – that is fan service at the highest level. In the “Watchmen” series they have the Superman metaphor precisely really taken to the extreme – now it will be exciting to see what J.J. thus makes. (In a brief pause, the message seems slowly to really arrive.) WOW, that’s great. And they gave the yesterday? FILM STARTS: Yes. While it is still a rumor, but with a very high probability that it is true. Yesterday it was really reading everywhere … Kevin Smith: That is phenomenal. That’s incredible. When the deal by J.J. signed with Warner Bros., there was never the official announcement that he is there now worry about the comic book movies. Instead, it was just that he gets there a fat deal. But it’s obvious that if someone like J.J. goes to a club, where there are a lot of brands with which they did not always start right, it is of course the man who was so selecting a project. It just makes sense.

Or any other quirky, over-written rom-coms. But after all that have gone before, this feels strangely awkward and unconvincing. And rather insufferably smug. Nick Twisp (Cera) is a 16-year-old who feels out of sync with the world. He has a summer job in a caravan park, where he instantly falls in love with Sheeni (Doubleday), the fiercely protected daughter of religious nutcases (Walsh and Place). Sheeni is like a female version of him, only sexy and smarter, and he creates an imaginary alter ego named Francois Dillinger to give him the confidence to seduce her. But of course things go wrong from the start. Five years ago, Cera would have been the right age to play this character, and the film might have even felt fresh and funny. But after Juno, Superbad, Nick and Norah and even Paper Heart, Cera has worn out this character. No matter how disarmingly cute he is, this script's snarky dialog feels coldly calculated, leaving us completely uninvolved in Nick's internal adventure. So it's the characters around him who provide most of the interest here: Smart and Buscemi as his self-absorbed parents, Galifianakis and Graynor as their hapless new partners, Kalyan as Nick's girl-crazy pal, Liotta as a bent cop and Long as Sheeni's rebel brother. But despite some nice acting subtext, even these people feel cartoonish thanks to one-note characterisations and too-astute dialog. Essentially, Nash's script is playing with surfaces here, only rarely touching on something that feels like an emotion. Arteta's direction is similarly preoccupied with wacky touches, from inventively animated sequences to zany capers like the one at Sheeni's boarding school. Sure, there are some terrific touches along the way, and the film is shot with a lovely sense of colour and texture. Arteta has a way with a camera that makes his films refreshingly unlike most over-lit, bland Hollywood movies, and he even manages to make the most of this story's meandering structure. But when the film's only message seems to be that we need to be ourselves, it ironically feels like maybe he's sold out after all.

Such is the case for the 3x1x1 m3 liquid argon detector – a preliminary version of the future detector modules for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The prototype uses “dual phase” technology, where neutrinos interact in liquid argon and create charges which are passed into gaseous argon and amplified. Whilst DUNE is hosted at Fermilab in the United States, the 3x1x1 m3 detector is several thousand miles away at CERN in Switzerland. After months of construction, the detector was installed into the lab’s accelerator complex before taking its first data in June 2017. The detector allows researchers to understand the behaviour of neutrinos by using argon. Neutrinos produce signals, such as electrons or light, when they come into contact with matter. This means when neutrinos pass through the argon, researchers can use these signals to reconstruct their path. However, using dual phase technology (ie: using both liquid and gaseous forms of argon) requires some tweaking to optimise the detection systems for future use. As such, researchers from Task 8.4 of Work Package 8 (WP8) of the AIDA-2020 project have been working to do just that. “We are responsible for the light detection system, specifically the photomultipliers that detect and amplify the light produced by the particle interactions in the liquid and gaseous argon,” said Clara Cuesta, an AIDA-2020 Post Doc, based at the Unit of Excellence María de Maeztu-CIEMAT-Particle Physics in Spain. “At the moment we are performing characterization tests of the photomultipliers to understand their response to different light signals.” After analysing the data, scientists involved in Task 8.4 will use this information to inform design considerations for the ProtoDUNE dual phase detector of 6x6x6 m³ - a larger-scale prototype. The 6x6x6 m³ will then be tested with charged particle beams in 2018, with the aim of characterizing the detector’s performance with full-scale detector components and validating the installation plans. At the same time, the task group is also working on the light detection system for ProtoDUNE using 36 cryogenic photomultipliers. Not only has the team designed and produced electrical components to help operate the devices, but are currently performing tests to understand their response to various light signals. In addition, the researchers are in the process of designing and testing a light monitor system, which will help to verify the correct functioning of the photomultipliers. The light readout system will be installed inside the ProtoDUNE dual phase detector at CERN in 2018. Data taking is expected to begin during the same year. The performance of ProtoDUNE dual phase detector will be key for the DUNE Technical Design Report, which will influence future design considerations. On Track is the newsletter for AIDA-2020.
