Su estilo clÃ¡sico sorprendiÃ³ a quienes estÃ¡n acostumbrados a reconocer el arte del genio espaÃ±ol en las \"Demoiselles D'Avignon\" o en \"Guernica\".\n\nPor eso hemos decidido dar algunas explicaciones al respecto del cuadro y profundizar un poco en la vida del artista, sin las pretensiones de tratar el tema exhaustivamente, pues serÃ­a, como lo ha sido una tarea muy larga y para manos de expertos.\n\nEl cuadro \"Ciencia y Caridad\", fue pintado por Picasso en 1897, es decir a la edad de 16 aÃ±os y con Ã©l recibiÃ³ una menciÃ³n honorÃ­fica en Madrid. En un lecho pobre se ve a la enferma demacrada, que refleja en sus ojos, no sÃ³lo su gran debilidad, sino la tristeza de dejar -a su pequeÃ±o hijo. A su lado se encuentra la Ciencia, representada por el mÃ©dico, preocupado por los sÃ­ntomas de la paciente y por su curaciÃ³n. No parece prestar atenciÃ³n a lo que pasa\n\nal otro lado de la cama, en donde una rubicunda religiosa, que representa la Caridad, extiende a la enferma un poco de alimento y mantiene en brazos al pequeÃ±o, quien, sin comprender el drama, se aferra a la monja. la cual, parece estar cumpliendo su deber sÃ³lo como una parte de su rutina. Hay que anotar que el modelo para la figura del mÃ©dico fue el mismo padre de Picasso. El planteamiento del cuadro es sencillo, su tratamiento y composiciÃ³n clÃ¡sicos, sin duda es una bella obra, que sorprende en un muchacho de la corta edad a que lo realizÃ³ el autor.\n\nÂ¿QuÃ© habÃ­a sucedido en la vida de Picasso antes de realizar esta obra, y quÃ© pasÃ³ despuÃ©s? Vale la pena describirlo...\n\n-\n\nMicroscopy and the Mystery of Pablo Picasso's Paints\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRose, Volker\n\nA deep connection to our past and shared cultural heritage must be preserved to foster a balanced society where all humanity can thrive. This talk will describe analysis of paint materials used by Pablo Picasso at the nanoscale, as only possible at the brightest synchrotron sources. It will highlight how new imaging techniques can reveal the invisible, bringing to light underlying compositions of old masters' paintings. This in turn enables the writing of new art history and provides important material clues that can assist with attribution and authentication. We will explain how the use of new technology can lead to new discoveries, which, in turn, can change the public's and the specialists' perception of great works of art. âIn collaboration with scientists from The Art Institute of Chicago we have teamed up to study the chemical make up of zinc oxide pigments used in artworks by Pablo Picasso. We will show how highly focused X-ray beams with nanoscale spatial resolution and trace element sensitivity have helped to determine that Picasso has used conventional house paint in some of his paintings. Surprisingly, the study gives also new insights into the pigment material zinc oxide, which has also great potential in a variety of applications such as in spintronics or as transparent electrodes in solar panels. Work at the Advanced Photon Source and the Center for Nanoscale Materials was supported by the U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, under contract DEAC02-06CH11357.\n\nLos artesanos de la luz.

Breve historia de un balazo en la pintura de Pablo Picasso\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGodoy C., Ivan\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Paris 1901: unrequited love drove Carles Casagemas, a close friend of Pablo Picassoâs youth, to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head. This tragic event was a major blow to Picasso, causing him to dwell upon the subject of death and express his âmourningâ through his paintings. The âbullet holeâ in his friendâs temple symbolically displaced several areas of the young Picassoâs life and became a âdeep vacuumâ and âmelancholyâ, permeating various areas in Picassoâs paintings, and marking the start of his famous blue period.ParÃ­s 1901: por el amor de una mujer, se suicida de un balazo en la cabeza Carles Casagemas, amigo Ã­ntimo de juventud de Pablo Picasso. Este trÃ¡gico suceso producirÃ¡ un gran dolor en el artista, el cual, lo harÃ¡ internarse en el tema de la muerte y elaborar su âdueloâ apoyado en su pintura. El âhoyo a balaâ en la sien de su amigo se desplazarÃ¡ simbÃ³licamente a varios espacios de la vida del joven Picasso y devendrÃ¡ en âvacÃ­o profundoâ y âmelancolÃ­aâ, permeando diferentes Ã¡mbitos dentro de la pintura de Picasso, dando comienzo a su mentado perÃ­odo azul.\n\nOtto Dix, Pablo Picasso y la pintura de guerra\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÃngel Llorente HernÃ¡ndez\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available La Primera Guerra Mundial provocÃ³ desde su desencadenamiento cambios importantes en los paÃ­ses implicados que afectaron a todos los Ã¡mbitos de la vida de sus poblaciones. Algunos artistas sintieron especialmente la repercusiÃ³n moral y la convulsiÃ³n causadas por la guerra mecanizada en la que un nÃºmero cada vez mayor de soldados morÃ­an en el frente, a la vez que se producÃ­an masacres en zonas de la retaguardia. El pintor expresionista alemÃ¡n Otto Dix recogiÃ³ en sus dibujos, hechos en primera lÃ­nea de combate, la dureza de los enfrentamientos y de la vida de los combatientes en las trincheras del frente occidental y reflejÃ³ en grabados y pinturas posteriores a la Gran Guerra las penalidades y los horrores sufridas por aquellos. Sus obras son, ademÃ¡s de testimonios de las atrocidades de los combates, condena y denuncia de todas las guerras. En el aÃ±o 1937 el espaÃ±ol Pablo Picasso pintÃ³ el mural Guernica, cuyo tÃ­tulo alude al bombardeo de la localidad vasca del mismo nombre, ocurrido poco tiempo antes de que su autor lo comenzase. Ya desde su creaciÃ³n, el cuadro se convirtiÃ³ en una de las obras artÃ­sticas principales del pasado siglo y en icono de la lucha por la paz. Ambos artistas emplearon lenguajes vanguardistas para crear formas nuevas, alejadas de las maneras tradicionales de representar la guerra en la cultura occidental. Dix se sirviÃ³ del expresionismo para mostrar en sus composiciones escenas verosÃ­miles de una dureza difÃ­cil de soportar para quienes las contemplan. Picasso se apoyÃ³ sobre todo en el cubismo y el surrealismo para aludir a los efectos de la guerra moderna sobre la poblaciÃ³n indefensa.Countries involved in The Great War experienced dramatic changes in every aspect of their day to day life. Some artists were especially sensitive towards the moral convulsion caused by a mechanized war where an increasing number of soldiers were dying in the frontline and massacres were taking place in the rear.

AntÃ³n Castro\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFull Text Available In Pablo Picassoâs formative period in A CoruÃ±a (1891â1895, where he was born as an artist, the child and pre-adolescent who at that time signed himself as Pablo Ruiz, already knowing he was a genius, pursued an intense programme of creative activity while devoting himself to drawing and painting. Making use of his facility for reproducing the world around him in images, he also proved to be an incipient devotee of journalism as an instrument of communication and social awareness, a satirical draughtsman and caricaturist, seeking to give his version of events, in line with the magazines and newspapers of the period, and displaying a critical ability unusual in a child, a committed gaze, not devoid of humour and sarcasm, which prefigures the later Picasso with his progressive views, acute intelligence, meta-ironic approach and support for great causes.\n\nPicasso, \"Arte Joven\", and Unamuno's \"Niebla\"\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFranz, Thomas R.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBy means of his association with the short-lived newspaper \"Arte Joven\", Unamuno had unique access to a series of sexually charged drawings by the young Pablo Picasso.

Genova\n\n2003-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Guillaume Apollinaire, one of the most original poets of the early twentieth-century French avant garde , played a crucial role in the enunciation of modernist aesthetics. Through innovative poetic forms, Apollinaire set forth a new aesthetics which underscored the inherent ambiguity of an increasingly turbulent modern context. Apollinaire's interest in the pure dynamism of the contemporary material landscape, and his attraction to the image that explodes with immediate presence, also led him to a natural curiosity in the visual arts. Identifying with the Cubist mosaic style of inclusion, the juxtaposition of reality and imagination, and the simultaneity of spatial and temporal movement, Apollinaire saw modern artists as \"singers of a constantly new truth,\" inventors of a uniquely authentic modern experience. Apollinaire composed verse to honor his favorite painters, but he also wrote critical studies on the visual arts, and he declares that it is in Cubist art that we can discover a truly successful endeavor to come to terms with the upheavals of modernity. In several texts Apollinaire devotes specifically to Picasso, he argues that his canvases contain the most essential aspects of modern art: a new interpretation of light, a genuine understanding of the elusive notion of the \"fourth dimension,\" and an incarnation of the most modern of principles, surprise. Apollinaire's texts on Picasso, examples of his poÃ©sie critique , do not remain simply words printed on a page, but are transformed into an extension of the painting he wishes to convey, experimental and unpredictable in discursive tone and poetic style. Through these texts, Apollinaire moves beyond the parameters of a journalistic style of criticism, as his pieces on Picasso take on a chameleon-like power of movement, engendering unique forms of an avant-garde improvisation, the painting of prose poetry.\n\nHigh-resolution fluorescence mapping of impurities in historical zinc oxide pigments: hard X-ray nanoprobe applications to the paints of Pablo Picasso\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCasadio, Francesca; Rose, Volker\n\n2013-01-01\n\nHere for the first time we describe the use of high resolution nanoprobe X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping for the analysis of artists' paints, hierarchically complex materials typically composed of binder, pigments, fillers, and other additives. The work undertaken at the nanoprobe sought to obtain highly spatially resolved, highly sensitive mapping of metal impurities (Pb, Cd, Fe, and other metals) in submicron particles of zinc oxide pigments used in early 20th century artists' tube paints and enamel paints, with particular emphasis on Ripolin, a popular brand of French house paint used extensively by Pablo Picasso and some of his contemporaries. Analysis revealed that the Zn oxide particles only contain a little Fe, proving that the highest quality Zn oxide pigment, free of Pb and Cd, was used for Ripolin house paints as well as artists' paints. Nanoprobe XRF mapping also demonstrated that artists' tube paints generally have more abundant fillers and additional whites (based on Pb, Ti, Ca) than Ripolin paints, which contain mostly pure zinc oxide. The chemical characterization of paints at the nanoscale opens the path to a better understanding of their fabrication and chemical reactivity.

The art of science and the science of art\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCERN. Geneva\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAlmost simultaneously, in the first decade of the 20th century Albert Einstein discovered relativity and Pablo Picasso cubism. How - and why? This fascinating story involves their often turbulent personal lives; the high drama of their struggles to achieve new ideas in the face of opposition from contemporaries; and the unlikely sources for their creative leaps, ignored by everyone else. To fully understand what happened involves coming to grips with wide-ranging questions such as: Are there similarities in creativity between artists and scientists? What do artists and scientists mean by 'aesthetics' and 'beauty'? Can we unravel creativity at its highest level?\n\nPablo Gargallo y el nacimiento de la modernidad: literatura, fotografÃ­a y cine\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnsÃ³n, Antonio\n\n2011-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The author presents an analysis of the aesthetic relationship between the sculptural works of Pablo Gargallo and Cubist literature, photography and cinema.

It motivates the change of name from Picasso to ProcSee based on plans to extend the use of the product and to avoid a potential conflict regarding the name. It describes features introduced during the last years to motivate users to utilise new functionality, describes how tests shows that ProcSee has unique capabilities when it comes to performance for handling frequent display updates for large complex displays, and describes new planned features to be implemented in ProcSee. The report concludes that Picasso/ProcSee has been and will continue to be of vital importance for the HRP research programme within the fields of human-machine interface design and human-machine interaction.

The concept of the PICASSO experiment rests on an approach consisting of the detection of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) candidate particles, the neutralino in particular, through the use of large mass superheated droplet modular detectors. The sources of background signal for PICASSO detector are gamma rays, mips's, neutrons, radon and alpha particles due to U/Th contamination of the detector and its environment. Droplet detectors have high efficiency for detecting neutrons while being insensitive to mip's, gamma rays when operated at proper temperature and pressure. As in the case of other low background experiments radon is a very important source of background. Radon can diffuse into the detector during fabrication, storage, operation and induce an alpha background by its disintegration. The purpose of our long-term measurement was to define the tightness and penetrability of the PICASSO emulsion container against radon. The PICASSO box has been placed into a bigger plastic box and a Si detector has been installed in both boxes. The source of radon (pitchblende) has been inserted into an outer plastic box to obtain a high level radon environment. Radon monitoring was based on an electrostatic collection of its progeny 218 Po and 214 Po on the Si detector entrance window with spectroscopic counting of alpha particles (e.g. [2]). The spectrometer TAIP was used for a particle energy measurement. The spectrometer was developed at the Czech Technical University in Prague. The spectrometer contains all the spectrometric modules needed for energy measurement as well as the source of voltage for Si detector. It also includes digital memory to save spectra during measurement (up to 1792 spectra). Two long-time tests (2 months and 2.5 months) were performed. Radon concentrations in both containers (the outer plastic box, the PICASSO container) have been measured\n\n\"CafÃ© Picasso\" JÃ¤rve Keskuses = \"CafÃ© Picasso\" in the JÃ¤rve Shopping Centre\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2003-01-01\n\n2002. a. valminud kohviku sisekujundusest.

Picasso ships with occlusion maps and saliency maps, two visualizations which help reveal issues that evaluation metrics like loss and accuracy might hide: for example, learning a proxy classification task. Picasso works with the Tensorflow deep learning framework, and Keras (when the model can be loaded into the Tensorflow backend. Picasso can be used with minimal configuration by deep learning researchers and engineers alike across various neural network architectures. Adding new visualizations is simple: the user can specify their visualization code and HTML template separately from the application code.\n\nAre there really intergalactic hydrogen clouds in the Sculptor group\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHaynes, M.P.; Roberts, M.S.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nHigh-sensitivity 21 cm observations of the region of the Sculptor group of galaxies reveal at least 30 H I clouds distributed over only the southern sector of the group. These new data add two striking complications to the picture of the clouds as H I companions of Sculptor galaxies: first, a much wider spatial distribution of clouds in marked contrast with the clustering of clouds around NGC 55 and NGC 300 previously reported by Mathewson, Cleary, and Murray; and second, a cloud velocity distribution which does not match that of the galaxies.We cannot reconcile the spatial and velocity distributions of the H I clouds with those of the group or of any subgroup. We conclude that there are no intergalactic H I clouds of > or =10 8 M/sub sun/ and galactic dimensions within the Sculptor group. Of a number of explanations alternative to group membership, we favor the identification of the clouds as a component of the Magellanic Stream which is seen in projection. Observations reported here of other nearby groups, combined with those of Sculptor, rule out the existence of a significant population of discrete H I clouds having the above properties\n\nA grieving process illustrated?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHutchinson, Rory\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe sudden death of Pablo Picasso's closest friend Carlos Casagemas in 1901 came as a great shock to the young Picasso. From a young age, Picasso had ruminated on life and death; however, this was his first experience of bereavement. Following the death of Casagemas, Picasso's paintings can be seen as a diary of his grieving process and clearly illustrate the five stages of the grieving process as outlined by Kubler-Ross in ' On Death and Dying ' (1969).

With high-resolution VLT/FLAMES spectra, R~20,000, we are able to get accurate abundances of several n-capture elements in ~100 stars, from both the lighter n-capture elements (Y) as well as the heavier ones, both tracers of the s-process (e.g. Ba) and the r-process (e.g. Eu).

We analyze new and archival high resolution spectroscopy from Magellan/MIKE and VLT/UVES and determine stellar parameters and abundances in a consistent way for each star. Two of the stars in our sample, at [Fe/H] = â3.5 and [Fe/H] = â3.8, are new discoveries from our Ca K survey of Sculptor, while the other three were known in the literature. We confirm that Scl 07-50 is the lowest metallicity star identified in an external galaxy, at [Fe/H] = â4.1. The two most metal-poor stars both have very unusual abundance patterns, with striking deficiencies of the Î± elements, while the other three stars resemble typical extremely metal-poor Milky Way halo stars. We show that the star-to-star scatter for several elements in Sculptor is larger than that for halo stars in the same metallicity range. This scatter and the uncommon abundance patterns of the lowest metallicity stars indicate that the oldest surviving Sculptor stars were enriched by a small number of earlier supernovae, perhaps weighted toward high-mass progenitors from the first generation of stars the galaxy formed\n\nTekstiil maalis / Maire Toom\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nToom, Maire\n\n1998-01-01\n\nTekstiili kujutamisest maalikunstis ja kunstnike - Jan Vermeer, Rembrandt, Jan van Eyck, Diego Vel{u00E1zquez, Raffael, Peter Paul Rubens, Tizian, Frans Hals, EugÃ¨ne Delacroix, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Jaan Koort - loomingus.\n\nVaal-galeriis on sajandi suurkujud / KÃ¼lli Kariste\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nKariste, KÃ¼lli\n\n2001-01-01\n\nVaal-galerii nÃ¤itusest (avatud. 10. mÃ¤rtsini) \"Suured ja unustamatud\", kus eksponeeriti Georges Braque'i, Paul Delvaux, Francis Baconi, Pablo Picasso, Joan MirÌ¤ jt. tÃ¶id.

A.; Helmi, A.; Posti, L.; Brown, A. G. A.; Tolstoy, E.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe three-dimensional motions of stars in small galaxies beyond our own are minute, yet they are crucial for understanding the nature of gravity and dark matter1,2. Even for the dwarf galaxy Sculptorâone of the best-studied systems, which is inferred to be strongly dark matter dominated3,4âthere are conflicting reports5-7 on its mean motion around the Milky Way, and the three-dimensional internal motions of its stars have never been measured. Here, we present precise proper motions of Sculptor's stars based on data from the Gaia mission8 and Hubble Space Telescope. Our measurements show that Sculptor moves around the Milky Way on a high-inclination elongated orbit that takes it much further out than previously thought. For Sculptor's internal velocity dispersions, we find ÏR = 11.5 Â± 4.3 km s-1 and ÏT = 8.5 Â± 3.2 km s-1 along the projected radial and tangential directions. Thus, the stars in our sample move preferentially on radial orbits as quantified by the anisotropy parameter, which we find to be Î² 0.8 6-0.83+0.12 at a location beyond the core radius. Taken at face value, this high radial anisotropy requires abandoning conventional models9 for Sculptor's mass distribution. Our sample is dominated by metal-rich stars and for these we find Î²M R 0.9 5-0.27+0.04âa value consistent with multi-component spherical models where Sculptor is embedded in a cuspy dark halo10, as might be expected for cold dark matter.\n\nThe early days of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nJablonka, P.; North, P.; Mashonkina, L.; Hill, V.; Revaz, Y.; Shetrone, M.; Starkenburg, E.; Irwin, M.; Tolstoy, E.; Battaglia, G.; Venn, K.; Helmi, A.; Primas, F.; FranÃ§ois, P.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe present the high-resolution spectroscopic study of five -3.9 â¤ [Fe/H] â¤ -2.5 stars in the Local Group dwarf spheroidal, Sculptor, thereby doubling the number of stars with comparable observations in this metallicity range.

IV. Measurement for Sculptor\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPiatek, Slawomir; Pryor, Carlton; Bristow, Paul; Olszewski, Edward W.; Harris, Hugh C.; Mateo, Mario; Minniti, Dante; Tinney, Christopher G.\n\n2006-03-01\n\nThis article presents a measurement of the proper motion of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy determined from images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph in the imaging mode. Each of two distinct fields contains a quasi-stellar object that serves as the ``reference point.'' The measured proper motion of Sculptor, expressed in the equatorial coordinate system, is (Î¼Î±, Î¼Î´)=(9+/-13, 2+/-13) mas century-1. Removing the contributions from the motion of the Sun and the motion of the local standard of rest produces the proper motion in the Galactic rest frame: (Î¼GrfÎ±, Î¼GrfÎ´)=(-23+/-13, 45+/-13) mas century-1. The implied space velocity with respect to the Galactic center has a radial component of Vr=79+/-6 km s-1 and a tangential component of Vt=198+/-50 km s-1. Integrating the motion of Sculptor in a realistic potential for the Milky Way produces orbital elements. The perigalacticon and apogalacticon are 68 (31, 83) and 122 (97, 313) kpc, respectively, where the values in the parentheses represent the 95% confidence interval derived from Monte Carlo experiments. The eccentricity of the orbit is 0.29 (0.26, 0.60), and the orbital period is 2.2 (1.5, 4.9) Gyr. Sculptor is on a polar orbit around the Milky Way: the angle of inclination is 86Â° (83Â°, 90Â°).

Q.\n\n2001-05-01\n\nHampton University, a historically black university, is leading the Education and Public Outreach (EPO) portion of the PICASSO-CENA satellite-based research mission. Currently scheduled for launch in 2004, PICASSO-CENA will use LIDAR (LIght Detection and Ranging), to study earth's atmosphere. The PICASSO-CENA Outreach program works with scientists, teachers, and students to better understand the effects of clouds and aerosols on earth's atmosphere. This program actively involves students nationwide in NASA research by having them obtain sun photometer measurements from their schools and homes for comparison with data collected by the PICASSO-CENA mission. Students collect data from their classroom ground observations and report the data via the Internet. Scientists will use the data from the PICASSO-CENA research and the student ground-truthing observations to improve predications about climatic change. The two-band passive remote sensing sun photometer is designed for student use as a stand alone instrument to study atmospheric turbidity or in conjunction with satellite data to provide ground-truthing. The instrument will collect measurements of column optical depth from the ground level. These measurements will not only give the students an appreciation for atmospheric turbidity, but will also provide quantitative correlative information to the PICASSO-CENA mission on ground-level optical depth. Student data obtained in this manner will be sufficiently accurate for scientists to use as ground truthing. Thus, students will have the opportunity to be involved with a NASA satellite-based research mission.\n\nCOMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT THROUGH ERGONOMICS TRAINING WITH LOCAL WISDOM ORIENTED TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF SCULPTOR HEALTH IN THE PELIATAN VILLAGE, UBUD, GIANYAR, BALI-INDONESIA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nI.

This was probably inappropriate due to different size, since the literature data generally on the basis of western size of anthropometry. The objective of this research, therefore, was to establish community empowerment through ergonomics training with local wisdom oriented to improve the sculptor health care quality and productivity. Ergonomics training through workshops conducted with a systemic, holistic, interdisciplinary, and participatory (SHIP approach. The training is done to make people aware of the work as a sculptor that is very important to apply ergonomics in the workplace. The results showed that ( a participants judge that ergonomics workshop can open their insights about the importance of the application of ergonomics in the workplace, (b work equipment is not in accordance with sculptor anthropometric, (c inadequate working conditions, because the workers were exposed to noise working tool more than 80 decibel and the room temperature exceeds 34OC and work a lot of cockroaches and rats roam, and (d the data of sculptor health quality is very poor, increase the workload at about13.5 %, musculoskeletal complaints at about 41.3 % , and fatigue at about 46.8 % ( p < 0.05 between before and after working. That means the work is very necessary sculptor redesigned in order to achieve comfort, safe, healthy, effective, and efficient of working conditions. It can be concluded that the ergonomics training with local wisdom oriented is required in an effort to implement the principles of ergonomics to achieve adequate health care quality sculptors and maximum productivity.\n\nThe radial velocity, velocity dispersion, and mass-to-light ratio of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nArmandroff, T.

Here we present metallicity and carbon abundance measurements of 100 stars in Sculptor from medium-resolution (R â¼ 2000) spectra taken with the Magellan/Michigan Fiber System mounted on the Magellan-Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We identify 24 extremely metal-poor star candidates ([Fe/H] 1.0). The existence of a large number of CEMP stars both in the halo and in Sculptor suggests that some halo CEMP stars may have originated from accreted early analogs of dwarf galaxies. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.\n\nChemical evolution of Local Group dwarf galaxies in a cosmological context - I.

In particular, we focus on the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, for which a wealth of observational data exists, as a test bed for our model. We select four candidate Sculptor-like galaxies from the satellite galaxy catalogue generated by implementation of a version of the Munich semi-analytic model for galaxy formation on the level 2 Aquarius dark matter simulations and use the mass assembly and star formation histories predicted for these four systems as an input for the chemical evolution code. We follow explicitly the evolution of several chemical elements, both in the cold gas out of which the stars form and in the hot medium residing in the halo. We take into account in detail the lifetimes of stars of different initial masses, the distribution of the delay times for Type Ia supernova explosions and the dependence of the stellar yields from the initial metallicity of the stars. We allow large fractions of metals to be deposited into the hot phase, either directly as stars die or through reheated gas flows powered by supernova explosions. We find that, in order to reproduce both the observed metallicity distribution function and the observed abundance ratios of long-lived stars of Sculptor, large fractions of the reheated metals must never re-enter regions of active star formation. With this prescription, all the four analogues to the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy extracted from the simulated satellites catalogue on the basis of luminosity and stellar population ages are found to reasonably match the detailed chemical properties of real Sculptor stars. However, all model galaxies do severely underestimate the fraction of very metal poor stars observed in Sculptor. Our analysis thus sets further constraints on the semi-analytical models and, at large, on possible metal enrichment\n\nPablo Neruda: un poeta comprometido\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAdriane A.

However, the main channel in San Pablo Bay has continuously narrowed. The underlying mechanisms and consequences of this tidal channel evolution are not well understood. The central question of this study is whether tidal channels evolve towards a geometry that leads to more efficient hydraulic conveyance and sediment throughput. We applied a hydrodynamic process-based, numerical model (Delft3D), which was run on 5 San Pablo Bay bathymetries measured between 1856 and 1983. Model results shows increasing energy dissipation levels for lower water flows leading to an approximately 15% lower efficiency in 1983 compared to 1856. During the same period the relative seaward sediment throughput through the San Pablo Bay main channel increased by 10%. A probable explanation is that San Pablo Bay is still affected by the excessive historic sediment supply. Sea level rise and Delta surface water area variations over 150 years have limited effect on the model results. With expected lower sediment concentrations in the watershed and less impact of wind waves due to erosion of the shallow flats, it is possible that energy dissipations levels will decrease again in future decades. Our study suggests that the morphodynamic adaptation time scale to excessive variations in sediment supply to estuaries may be on the order of centuries.\n\nLondoni aruanne / Jaan Elken\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nElken, Jaan, 1954-\n\n2009-01-01\n\nNÃ¤itus \"Uus kunst LÃ¤his-Idast\" Saatchi galeriis.

Those who agree state that the law is needed to maintain the morality which has been getting worse, and those who disagree state that it may emasculate their freedom and creativities. This study gives answers to (1 what social practices were performed by the Balinese sculptors to pry into the Law of Pornography?, (2 why did they pry into the application of the law?, and (3 what was the meaning of their prying? Several relevant critical theories such as the theory of structuration, the theory of hegemony, and the theory of aesthetics were eclectically used in this study. The data needed were collected through observation, in-depth interview, documentation study, and library research. The result of the study showed that the Balinese sculptors showed their resistance to the application of the law by making adaptation, changing profession, and still producing pornographic works. The sanction which might be imposed upon them, the consumers of pornographic works decreased, and they were eliminated from exhibitions scared them when they pried into the law. What they did could not be separated from economic, political, ideological, moral, and ethic factors. The meaning of their prying was that it caused them to lose their idealism, their consumers went down, and the number of pornographic works dropped as well.\n\nReaching for Success: Picassoâs Rise in the Market (The First Two Decades\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEnrique Mallen\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This article explores the exhibitions of Picassoâs works in the first two decades of his artistic career, as well as the dealers and collectors who came into contact with them.

C.; Zavala, J.; De Boer, T. J. L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe combine the detailed star formation histories of the Fornax and Sculptor dwarf spheroidals with the mass assembly history of their dark matter (DM) halo progenitors to estimate if the energy deposited by Type II supernovae (SNe II) is sufficient to create a substantial DM core. Assuming the efficiency of energy injection of the SNe II into DM particles is Îµ gc = 0.05, we find that a single early episode, z â³ z infall , that combines the energy of all SNe II due to explode over 0.5Â Gyr is sufficient to create a core of several hundred parsecs in both Sculptor and Fornax. Therefore, our results suggest that it is energetically plausible to form cores in cold dark matter (CDM) halos via early episodic gas outflows triggered by SNe II. Furthermore, based on CDM merger rates and phase-space density considerations, we argue that the probability of a subsequent complete regeneration of the cusp is small for a substantial fraction of dwarf-size halos\n\nRED SUPERGIANTS AS COSMIC ABUNDANCE PROBES: THE SCULPTOR GALAXY NGC 300\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGazak, J.

Intima-medial thickness (IMT) is a well-known surrogate marker of atherosclerosis and has been used to predict stroke and cardiovascular events. However, the clinical significance of IMT and IMT change in stroke has not been investigated in well-designed studies. The PreventIon of CArdiovascular events in iSchemic Stroke patients with high risk of cerebral hemOrrhage-Intima-Media Thickness (PICASSO-IMT) sub-study is designed to investigate the effects of cilostazol, probucol, or both on IMT in patients with stroke. PICASSO-IMT is a prospective sub-study of the PICASSO study designed to measure IMT and plaque score at 1, 13, 25, 37, and 49 months after randomization. The primary outcome is the change in mean carotid IMT, which is defined as the mean of the far-wall IMTs of the right and left common carotid arteries, between baseline and 13 months after randomization. PICASSO-IMT will provide the largest IMT data set in a stroke population and will provide valuable information about the clinical significance of IMT in patients with ischemic stroke.

V.; Jaffe, B. E.; Roelvink, J.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nThe objective of the current research is to hindcast decadal morphodynamic development in San Pablo Bay, California, USA using a process-based, numerical model, Delft3D. Experience gained in the current research will be ultimately used to model future morphodynamic changes in San Pablo Bay under different scenarios of climate change. Delft3D is run in 3D mode including wind waves, salt and fresh water interaction, sand and mud fractions and applies a sophisticated morphodynamic update scheme [Roelvink (2006)]. Model outcomes are evaluated against measured bathymetric developments [Cappiella (1999), Jaffe et al (2007)] and include an extensive sensitivity analysis on model parameter settings. In the 19th century more than 250 million cubic meters of sediment was deposited in San Pablo Bay because of the increased sediment load associated with hydraulic gold mining activities. When mining stopped and dam construction regulated river flows and trapped sediment upstream early 20th century, San Pablo Bay showed an eroding trend. Focus of the hindcast is on the 1856 to 1887 depositional period and on the 1951 to 1983 erosional period. The results of the model heavily depend on parameter settings related to sediment transport, bed composition and boundary conditions schematization. A major handicap is that the (historic) values of these parameters are not known in detail. Recommendations by Ganju et al. (2008) are used to overcome this problem. The results show, however, that applying best-guess model parameter settings can predict decadal morphodynamic developments reasonably well in San Pablo Bay. From all varied settings sediment concentration, river discharge and waves have the most significant effect on deposition volumes, whereas waves have the most impact on sediment distribution within San Pablo Bay. For the depositional period Brier Skill Scores have values around 0.25 with a maximum of 0.43 (qualified as âgoodâ) although higher values (up to 0.65) were\n\nThe Sculptor, the Basket Weaver and the Carver: Traditional Northwest Indian Art Is Reflected in Old and New Media.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSyzmanski, Susan; Dennis, Lyn\n\n1993-01-01\n\nDiscusses the art department at Northwest Indian College which offers traditional arts and crafts along with conventional classes.

About 1,000 line-km of shipborne magnetometer data were collected in San Pablo Bay along approximately north-east and north-west trending traverses. Shiptrack lines were spaced 200-m apart in a N55oE direction and tie-lines were spaced 500- and 1,000-m apart in a N145oE direction. Magnetometer and Geographic Positioning System (GPS) data were collected simultaneously at one-second intervals using a Geometrics G858 cesium vapor magnetometer with the sensor attached to a nonmagnetic pole extended about 2 m over the bow. Diurnal variations of the Earth's magnetic field were recorded at a ground magnetic base station and shipborne data were corrected for diurnal variations, International Geomagnetic Reference Field, cultural noise, heading errors, and leveling errors. The heading correction applied to the shipborne magnetic data accounts for a systematic shift in the magnetic readings due to the magnetic field produced by the boat and the orientation of the boat. The heading correction was determined by traversing several shiptrack lines in various azimuths in opposite directions. Magnetic measurements off the main survey lines (e.g., turns) were removed from the survey. After applying the heading correction, crossing values or the difference in values where two survey lines intersect were compared and the survey was leveled. Shipborne magnetic data reveal a prominent magnetic anomaly immediately offshore of Point Pinole that probably reflects ultramafic rocks (e.g. serpentinite), similar to those exposed in the northern part of the onshore Hayward Fault. Further to the northwest, shipborne magnetic data enhance two prominent aeromagnetic anomalies along the Hayward Fault in the\n\nLa concepciÃ³n de âser humanoâ en Pablo Freire\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRoberto Pineda-Ibarra\n\n2008-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This article analizes how Pablo Freire, one of the main education theoreticians with broad trajectory and world influence and with a big contibution to what it is known as alternative pedagogy, conceives the human been and his participation in and with the world. He has built his conception on this matter through several publications, merged from his teaching practice.\n\nETNOGRAFÃA ARGENTINA: LA CÃTEDRA LIBRE DE MONSEÃOR PABLO CABRERA (1925 / Argentine Ethnography: Monsignor Pablo Cabreraâs free lecture (1925\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMariela Eleonora Zabala\n\n2010-12-01\n\nFull Text Available La Reforma Universitaria de la Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba (UNC en 1918, posibilitÃ³ la inserciÃ³n acadÃ©mica de la antropologÃ­a en el Ã¡rea central argentina, mediante dos iniciativas de los estudiantes. Una fueron los cursos y docencia libre de carÃ¡cter extracurricular, para alumnos de todas las carreras. Otra fueron los concursos docentes, destinados a excluir de la autoridad, la administraciÃ³n y el cuerpo docente a los catÃ³licos y conservadores, y beneficiar a los profesores âmÃ¡s capaces y dignosâ en nombre de âla idoneidadâ, âla justiciaâ y âla libertadâ.Este artÃ­culo examina una derivaciÃ³n directa de estas iniciativas que parece contradecir sus propÃ³sitos: la emergencia del primer curso libre de EtnografÃ­a Argentina en la UNC en 1925. Dicho espacio curricular fue propuesto y estuvo a cargo de MonseÃ±or Pablo Cabrera (1857-1936, sacerdote de la diÃ³cesis de CÃ³rdoba, miembro de la Academia Nacional de Ciencias, director del Museo HistÃ³rico Provincial, y prolÃ­fero autor de libros y artÃ­culos publicados en la Revista de la Universidad y el diario Los Principios. Â¿CÃ³mo fue posible que un intelectual de la Iglesia encabezara semejante innovaciÃ³n en un contexto anticlerical? Â¿CÃ³mo incidiÃ³ su adscripciÃ³n confesional en una instituciÃ³n laica, y cÃ³mo incidiÃ³ su obra universitaria en su vertiente clerical? Â¿CÃ³mo convivieron estas dos lÃ­neas en una misma persona, precursor de la antropologÃ­a cordobesa?Â Palabras Claves: Reforma universitaria; enseÃ±anza; EtnologÃ­a argentina; MonseÃ±or Pablo Cabrera.Â AbstractThe groundbreaking Reform that took place at the National University of CÃ³rdoba (Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba, UNC in 1918, paved the way to the academic start of anthropology in Central Argentina. This new presence was fostered by two initiatives of the studentsâ sector: extra-curriculum or âfreeâ courses, and public contests to professorsâ positions. The latter was meant to exclude\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging features of neuroinfections in patients with AIDS.

El Plan Bolonia propone un replanteamiento de la misiÃ³n que debe cumplir la Universidad acercando dicha instituciÃ³n a los intereses y necesidades de la empresa y de la sociedad. Uno de los pilares bÃ¡sicos de estos cambios es el que hace referencia a la formaciÃ³n del alumno por competencias. Presentamos un trabajo de investigaciÃ³n cientÃ­fica enfocado en dos aspectos: la adquisiciÃ³n de competencias profesionales en los alumnos de la licenciatura de Periodismo de la Universidad San Pablo CEU yÂ la importancia que otorgan a diferentes aspectos de un empleo. Ãste Ãºltimo aspecto, partiendo del Informe RÃ©flex de ANECA âEl profesional flexible en la Sociedad del Conocimientoâ establecemos una comparativa entre los resultados allÃ­ obtenidos y el caso particular de los alumnos de Periodismo de la San Pablo CEU. Para descubrir estos aspectos presentamos un trabajo empÃ­rico para conocer en quÃ© medida los alumnos de Ãºltimo curso de la licenciatura (que no de grado de la Universidad San Pablo CEU han adquirido las competencias profesionales que se reflejan en el Libro Blanco de ANECA de los tÃ­tulos de grado en ComunicaciÃ³n.Este estudio que presentamos nace con vocaciÃ³n de continuidad en un doble sentido: ser un indicador de la calidad de las enseÃ±anzas que reciben los alumnos de Periodismo de la San Pablo CEU y conocer en un futuro prÃ³ximo (cuando salga la primera promociÃ³n de graduados si existe una diferencia significativa entre los alumnos que cursaron la licenciatura y los nuevos graduados fruto de la reforma universitaria.
