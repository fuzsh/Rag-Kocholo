        "text": "eNAL: An Extension of the NAL Setup Correction Protocol for Effective Use of Weekly Follow-up Measurements\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBoer, Hans C.J. de; Heijmen, Ben J.M.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nPurpose: The no action level (NAL) protocol reduces systematic displacements relative to the planning CT scan by using the mean displacement of the first few treatment fractions as a setup correction in all subsequent fractions. This approach may become nonoptimal in case of time trends or transitions in the systematic displacement of a patient. Here, the extended NAL (eNAL) protocol is introduced to cope with this problem. Methods and Materials: The initial setup correction of eNAL is the same as in NAL. However, in eNAL, additional weekly follow-up measurements are performed. The setup correction is updated after each follow-up measurement based on linear regression of the available measured displacements to track and correct systematic time-dependent changes. We investigated the performance of eNAL with Monte Carlo simulations for populations without systematic displacement changes over time, with large gradual changes (time trends), and with large sudden changes (transitions). Weekly follow-up measurements were simulated for 35 treatment fractions. We compared the outcome of eNAL with NAL and optimized shrinking action level (SAL) protocol with weekly measurements. Results: Without time-dependent changes, eNAL, SAL, and NAL performed comparably, but SAL required the largest imaging workload. For time trends and transitions, eNAL performed superiorly to the other protocols and reduced systematic displacements to the same magnitude as in case of no time-dependent changes (SD â¼1 mm). Conclusion: Extended NAL can reduce systematic displacements to a minor level irrespective of the precise nature of the systematic time-dependent changes that may occur in a population\n\nLearning Based on the Project Entitled \"Design and Construction of a Wooden Bridge\"\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBarris, Cristina; Torres, LluÃ­s; Simon, Enric\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis article presents the results of a case involving the application of project-based learning carried out with students in the Mechanical Engineering degree program at the University of Girona.

In rice, mutations in Narrow leaf 1 (NAL1 show narrow leaf phenotypes. Previous studies have shown that NAL1 plays a role in regulating vein patterning and increasing grain yield in indica cultivars, but its role in leaf growth and development remains unknown. In this report, we characterized two allelic mutants of NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1, nal1-2 and nal1-3, both of which showed a 50% reduction in leaf width and length, as well as a dwarf culm. Longitudinal and transverse histological analyses of leaves and internodes revealed that cell division was suppressed in the anticlinal orientation but enhanced in the periclinal orientation in the mutants, while cell size remained unaltered. In addition to defects in cell proliferation, the mutants showed abnormal midrib in leaves. Map-based cloning revealed that nal1-2 is a null allelic mutant of NAL1 since both the whole promoter and a 404-bp fragment in the first exon of NAL1 were deleted, and that a 6-bp fragment was deleted in the mutant nal1-3. We demonstrated that NAL1 functions in the regulation of cell division as early as during leaf primordia initiation. The altered transcript level of G1- and S-phase-specific genes suggested that NAL1 affects cell cycle regulation. Heterogeneous expression of NAL1 in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe further supported that NAL1 affects cell division. These results suggest that NAL1 controls leaf width and plant height through its effects on cell division.\n\nMeasurement of Psychological Entitlement in 28 Countries\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nÅ»emojtel-Piotrowska, M.; Piotrowski, J.; Cieciuch, J.; Calogero, R.M.; Van Hiel, A.; Argentero, P.; Baltatescu, S.; Baran, T.; Bardhwaj, G.; Bukowski, M.; Chargazia, M.; Clinton, A.; Halik, M.H.; Ilisko, D.; Khachatryan, N.; KlicperovÃ¡-Baker, Martina; KoÅ¡Å¥Ã¡l, Jaroslav; Kovacs, M.; Letovancova, E.; Liik, K.; Marganski, A.; MichaÅowski, J.; Nord, I.; Paspalanova, E.; de Leon, P.P.; Techera, J.; Rojas, M.; RÃ³Å¼ycka, J.; Sawicka, A.; Seibt, B.; Semkiv, I.; Tiliouine, H.; Truong, H.K.; Van den Bos, K.; Wills-Herrera, E.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 33, Ä. 3 (2017), s. 207-217 ISSN 1015-5759 R&D Projects: GA ÄR GA15-11062S Institutional support: RVO:68081740 Keywords : psychological entitlement * Entitlement Attitudes Questionnaire * cross-cultural research * measurement invariance Subject RIV: AN - Psychology OBOR OECD: Psychology (including human - machine relations) Impact factor: 2.328, year: 2016 http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1015-5759/a000286\n\nThe Effects of Antimicrobial Peptide Nal-P-113 on Inhibiting Periodontal Pathogens and Improving Periodontal Status\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHongyan Wang\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Periodontal disease consists of chronic gingival inflammation characterized by both degradation of the periodontal connective tissue and alveolar bone loss. Drug therapy is used as an auxiliary treatment method in severe chronic periodontitis, aggressive periodontitis, and periodontitis-associated systemic disease. Nal-P-113, a modified antimicrobial peptide, specifically replaces the histidine residues of P-113 with the bulky amino acid Î²-naphthylalanine, and our previous studies have verified that this novel peptide is not toxic to the human body within a certain concentration range. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of Nal-P-113 on periodontal pathogens and periodontal status in clinical studies. In a split-mouth clinical trial, the pocket depth and bleeding index values tended to decrease in the experimental group compared with those in the control group. SEM results verified that Nal-P-113 restrained the maturation of plaque. Based on real-time polymerase chain reaction, the levels of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus gordonii, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque were decreased when the subjects were given Nal-P-113. Bacterial growth curve analysis and a biofilm susceptibility assay verified that Nal-P-113 at a concentration of 20âÎ¼g/mL restrained the growth of S. gordonii, F. nucleatum, and P. gingivalis and biofilm formation. Therefore, Nal-P-113 effectively reduces periodontal pathogens and ameliorates periodontal status.\n\nA natural variant of NAL1, selected in high-yield rice breeding programs, pleiotropically increases photosynthesis rate\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTakai, Toshiyuki; Adachi, Shunsuke; Taguchi-Shiobara, Fumio; Sanoh-Arai, Yumiko; Iwasawa, Norio; Yoshinaga, Satoshi; Hirose, Sakiko; Taniguchi, Yojiro; Yamanouchi, Utako; Wu, Jianzhong; Matsumoto, Takashi; Sugimoto, Kazuhiko; Kondo, Katsuhiko; Ikka, Takashi; Ando, Tsuyu; Kono, Izumi; Ito, Sachie; Shomura, Ayahiko; Ookawa, Taiichiro; Hirasawa, Tadashi; Yano, Masahiro; Kondo, Motohiko; Yamamoto, Toshio\n\n2013-01-01\n\nImprovement of leaf photosynthesis is an important strategy for greater crop productivity. Here we show that the quantitative trait locus GPS (GREEN FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) controls photosynthesis rate by regulating carboxylation efficiency. Map-based cloning revealed that GPS is identical to NAL1 (NARROW LEAF1), a gene previously reported to control lateral leaf growth. The high-photosynthesis allele of GPS was found to be a partial loss-of-function allele of NAL1. This allele increased mesophyll cell number between vascular bundles, which led to thickened leaves, and it pleiotropically enhanced photosynthesis rate without the detrimental side effects observed in previously identified nal1 mutants, such as dwarf plant stature. Furthermore, pedigree analysis suggested that rice breeders have repeatedly selected the high-photosynthesis allele in high-yield breeding programs. The identification and utilization of NAL1 (GPS) can enhance future high-yield breeding and provides a new strategy for increasing rice productivity.

The model project of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is coded RER/2/004 and entitled Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) for Nuclear Analytical Techniques had been approved in 1999 for a period of two years aiming at the implementation of a comprehensive QA/QC protocol in nuclear analytical laboratories (NALs) of Member States following the ISO 17025 quid. Member States are Turkey, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Latvia, Hungary,Estonia, Croatia, Belarus, Armenia and Agency's Laboratory Seibersdorf which made appropriate staff and facilities available for full participation in the project. In this summary, major goals of participation in the project, core stones of implementation in NALs (gamma, X-rays and alpha/beta), establishing the quality system, improvements of technical and management requirements as well as achievements and difficulties during two year program were discussed in detail. Progress of the nuclear analytical laboratories was monitored by IAEA staff using a concise scorning system that was applied to the submitted progress reports and the audit reviews. Two proficiency tests were applied to evaluate the technical competence of the laboratories by selected radionuclides of environmental importance. The main objective of the exercise were to validate the accuracy and precision of the measurements and to provide feedback to the participants on the performance of methods. PT sample results on gamma and alpha/beta measurements of NALs in center are compatible. It is expected that the reasonable progress gained in this project, will reflect as inching towards accreditation of NALs in near future.In addition to NALs of Centers in Ankara and Istanbul individual IAEA TC project for advanced nondestructive\n\nSynthesis, characterization and antifungal studies of metalloquinolone [Cd2(nal2(phen2(Cl2\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA.

The synthesized metal complex was characterized using CHN analysis, Fourier transformed infra-red, thermo gravimetric analysis, differential scanning chalorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultra violet-visible and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The newly synthesized complex shows more pronounced antifungal activity compared with the parent quinolone against four fungi, namely Pythium aphanidermatum, Sclerotinia rolfsii, Rhizoctonia solani and Rhizoctonia bataticola.\n\nEfficient immobilization of AGE and NAL enzymes onto functional amino resin as recyclable and high-performance biocatalyst.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCheng, Jian; Zhuang, Wei; Tang, Chenglun; Chen, Yong; Wu, Jinglan; Guo, Ting; Ying, Hanjie\n\n2017-03-01\n\nN-Acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase (AGE) and N-acetylneuraminic acid lyase (NAL) were immobilized for synthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) on three resins: Amberzyme oxirane resin (AOR), poly (styrene-co-DVB)-Br resin (PBR) and amino resin (AR). The loading capacity and immobilized enzyme activity showed that AR was the best carrier. Three methods of glutaraldehyde cross-linking were tested and simultaneous cross-linking and immobilization was demonstrated to be the best method. The functional properties of immobilized AGE and NAL were studied and compared to those of the free enzyme. The highest enzyme activities of free and immobilized AGE were obtained in 0.1Â M potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 and a temperature of 37Â Â°C. Comparatively, the highest NAL activities were at pH 8.5. Meanwhile, an increase in K m (from 1.14 to 1.31Â mgÂ·mL -1 for AGE and from 1.05 to 1.25Â mgÂ·mL -1 for NAL) and a decrease in V max (from 177.53 to 106.37Â ÂµgÂ·min -1 mL -1 for AGE and from 126.41 to 95.96Â ÂµgÂ·min -1 mL -1 for NAL) were recorded after immobilization. The AR-glutaraldehyde-enzyme system exhibited better thermal stability than the free enzyme, and retained 72% of its initial activity even after eight repeated runs. The apparent activation energy (E a ) of the free and immobilized AGE (NAL) was 117.14Â kJÂ·mol -1 (124.21Â kJÂ·mol -1 ) and 78.45Â kJÂ·mol -1 (66.64Â kJÂ·mol -1 ), respectively, implying that the catalytic efficiency of the immobilized enzyme was restricted by mass-transfer rather than kinetic limit. Subsequently, Neu5Ac production from GlcNAc using immobilized enzymes in one reactor was carried out resulting 101.45Â gÂ·L -1 of Neu5Ac and the highest conversion ratio of 82%. This method of enzyme immobilization may have a promising future for Neu5Ac production in industry.\n\nPractical Use of the Extended No Action Level (eNAL) Correction Protocol for Breast Cancer Patients With Implanted Surgical Clips\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPenninkhof, Joan; Quint, Sandra; Baaijens, Margreet; Heijmen, Ben; Dirkx, Maarten\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPurpose: To describe the practical use of the extended No Action Level (eNAL) setup correction protocol for breast cancer patients with surgical clips and evaluate its impact on the setup accuracy of both tumor bed and whole breast during simultaneously integrated boost treatments. Methods and Materials: For 80 patients, two orthogonal planar kilovoltage images and one megavoltage image (for the mediolateral beam) were acquired per fraction throughout the radiotherapy course. For setup correction, the eNAL protocol was applied, based on registration of surgical clips in the lumpectomy cavity. Differences with respect to application of a No Action Level (NAL) protocol or no protocol were quantified for tumor bed and whole breast. The correlation between clip migration during the fractionated treatment and either the method of surgery or the time elapsed from last surgery was investigated. Results: The distance of the clips to their center of mass (COM), averaged over all clips and patients, was reduced by 0.9 Â± 1.2 mm (mean Â± 1 SD). Clip migration was similar between the group of patients starting treatment within 100 days after surgery (median, 53 days) and the group starting afterward (median, 163 days) (p = 0.20). Clip migration after conventional breast surgery (closing the breast superficially) or after lumpectomy with partial breast reconstructive techniques (sutured cavity). was not significantly different either (p = 0.22). Application of eNAL on clips resulted in residual systematic errors for the clipsâ COM of less than 1 mm in each direction, whereas the setup of the breast was within about 2 mm of accuracy. Conclusions: Surgical clips can be safely used for high-accuracy position verification and correction. Given compensation for time trends in the clipsâ COM throughout the treatment course, eNAL resulted in better setup accuracies for both tumor bed and whole breast than NAL.\n\nActivity of MM-398, nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI), in Ewing's family tumor xenografts is associated with high exposure of tumor to drug and high SLFN11 expression.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKang, Min H; Wang, Jing; Makena, Monish R; Lee, Joo-Sang; Paz, Nancy; Hall, Connor P; Song, Michael M; Calderon, Ruben I; Cruz, Riza E; Hindle, Ashly; Ko, Winford; Fitzgerald, Jonathan B; Drummond, Daryl C; Triche, Timothy J; Reynolds, C Patrick\n\n2015-03-01\n\nTo determine the pharmacokinetics and the antitumor activity in pediatric cancer models of MM-398, a nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI). Mouse plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics of nal-IRI and the current clinical formulation of irinotecan were characterized. In vivo activity of irinotecan and nal-IRI was compared in xenograft models (3 each in nu/nu mice) of Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (EFT), neuroblastoma (NB), and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). SLFN11 expression was assessed by Affymetrix HuEx arrays, Taqman RT-PCR, and immunoblotting. Plasma and tumor concentrations of irinotecan and SN-38 (active metabolite) were approximately 10-fold higher for nal-IRI than for irinotecan. Two doses of NAL-IRI (10 mg/kg/dose) achieved complete responses maintained for >100 days in 24 of 27 EFT-xenografted mice. Event-free survival for mice with RMS and NB was significantly shorter than for EFT. High SLFN11 expression has been reported to correlate with sensitivity to DNA damaging agents; median SLFN11 mRNA expression was >100-fold greater in both EFT cell lines and primary tumors compared with NB or RMS cell lines or primary tumors. Cytotoxicity of SN-38 inversely correlated with SLFN11 mRNA expression in 20 EFT cell lines. In pediatric solid tumor xenografts, nal-IRI demonstrated higher systemic and tumor exposures to SN-38 and improved antitumor activity compared with the current clinical formulation of irinotecan. Clinical studies of nal-IRI in pediatric solid tumors (especially EFT) and correlative studies to determine if SLFN11 expression can serve as a biomarker to predict nal-IRI clinical activity are warranted.

Most discussions regarding these attitudes are anecdotal, but the pervasiveness of these accounts and the troubling effects that ensue warrant attention. Grade inflation, student incivility, altered classroom practices, and decreased faculty morale are all potential aftereffects of teaching students who hold academic entitlement beliefs. Numerous factors are posited as attributing to academic entitlement including personal issues, societal pressures, and broad academic practices. This paper discusses these factors and offers faculty members and administrators recommendations regarding practices that may curb or alleviate issues associated with academically entitled students.\n\nPreventive effects of the novel antimicrobial peptide Nal-P-113 in a rat Periodontitis model by limiting the growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis and modulating IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± production.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWang, Hong-Yan; Lin, Li; Fu, Wei; Yu, Hui-Yuan; Yu, Ning; Tan, Li-Si; Cheng, Jya-Wei; Pan, Ya-Ping\n\n2017-08-29\n\nP-113 (AKRHHGYKRKFH-NH2) is a 12-amino-acid histidine-rich peptide derived from histatin 5 that is highly degradable in high salt concentrations and biological fluids such as serum, plasma and saliva. Nal-P-113, a novel antimicrobial peptide whose histidine residues are replaced by the bulky amino acids Î²-naphthylalanine, causes the antimicrobial peptide to retain its bactericidal activity even in physiological environments. This study evaluated the effect of the novel antimicrobial peptide Nal-P-113 in a rat periodontitis model and the mechanisms of action of Nal-P-113 for suppressing periodontitis. Periodontitis was induced in mandibular first molars in rats receiving a ligature and infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis. Animals were randomly divided into six groups: a, P. gingivalis W83 alone; b, P. gingivalis W83 with 6.25Â Î¼g/mL of Nal-P-113; c, P. gingivalis W83 with 25Â Î¼g/mL of Nal-P-113; d, P. gingivalis W83 with 100Â Î¼g/mL of Nal-P-113; e, P. gingivalis W83 with 400Â Î¼g/mL of Nal-P-113; and f, control without P. gingivalis W83 or Nal-P-113. Morphometric analysis was used to evaluate alveolar bone loss. Microbiological assessment of the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis and total bacteria was performed using absolute quantitative real-time PCR and scanning electron microscopy. Gingival tissue was collected for western blot and immunohistochemical assays of IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± levels. Alveolar bone loss was inhibited by 100Â Î¼g/mL or 400Â Î¼g/mL of Nal-P-113 compared to the control group (PÂ periodontal tissue (PÂ periodontitis in rats by limiting the amount of bacteria and modulating IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± production. The use of Nal-P-113 in vivo might serve as a beneficial preventive or therapeutic approach for periodontitis.\n\nEntitlement and organizational behaviors: the moderating role of narcissism\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAgata Szalkowska\n\n2015-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Background The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between psychological entitlement (active, passive, and revenge, narcissism and two types of organizational behaviors in employees. Interactions between narcissism and psychological entitlement as predictors of organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB and counterproductive work behaviors (CWB were explored. Predictors were analyzed in an effort to determine whether psychological entitlement plays a more destructive role among narcissistic employees than among non-narcissistic ones and whether the effects of narcissism on OCB and CWB are mediated by entitlement. Participants and procedure Data were obtained from 100 employees (34% men aged 22 to 59 years (M = 37.00, SD = 9.30 from public and private companies. Participants were asked to complete the Organizational Citizenship Behavior Scale (OCBS, the Counterproductive Organizational Behaviors Scale (COBS, the Entitlement Questionnaire, and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI. Results Positive aspects of entitlement were positively associated with OCB only among narcissistic employees, and active entitlement mediated the effects of narcissism on CWB. Active entitlement was negatively related to CWB. Negative aspects of entitlement were negatively related to OCB and unrelated to CWB. Conclusions This study provides evidence for positive (healthy aspects of entitlement for organizations. The unexpected interaction between narcissism and entitlement in predicting higher levels of OCB suggests that among narcissistic employees, healthy aspects of entitlement are desirable and profitable for an organization. Psychological entitlement was observed to be an important predictor of organizational behaviors beyond narcissism itself.\n\nPentachlorophenol induction of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa mexAB-oprM efflux operon: involvement of repressors NalC and MexR and the antirepressor ArmR.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLisa M Starr\n\nFull Text Available Pentachlorophenol (PCP induced expression of the NalC repressor-regulated PA3720-armR operon and the MexR repressor-controlled mexAB-oprM multidrug efflux operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PCP's induction of PA3720-armR resulted from its direct modulation of NalC, the repressor's binding to PA3720-armR promoter-containing DNA as seen in electromobility shift assays (EMSAs being obviated in the presence of this agent. The NalC binding site was localized to an inverted repeat (IR sequence upstream of PA3720-armR and overlapping a promoter region whose transcription start site was mapped. While modulation of MexR by the ArmR anti-repressor explains the upregulation of mexAB-oprM in nalC mutants hyperexpressing PA3720-armR, the induction of mexAB-oprM expression by PCP is not wholly explainable by PCP induction of PA3720-armR and subsequent ArmR modulation of MexR, inasmuch as armR deletion mutants still showed PCP-inducible mexAB-oprM expression. PCP failed, however, to induce mexAB-oprM in a mexR deletion strain, indicating that MexR was required for this, although PCP did not modulate MexR binding to mexAB-oprM promoter-containing DNA in vitro. One possibility is that MexR responds to PCP-generated in vivo effector molecules in controlling mexAB-oprM expression in response to PCP. PCP is an unlikely effector and substrate for NalC and MexAB-OprM--its impact on NalC binding to the PA3720-armR promoter DNA occurred only at high ÂµM levels--suggesting that it mimics an intended phenolic effector/substrate(s. In this regard, plants are an abundant source of phenolic antimicrobial compounds and, so, MexAB-OprM may function to protect P. aeruginosa from plant antimicrobials that it encounters in nature.\n\nStudent Entitlement Models in Australia's National Training System: Expert Views.

One disadvantage in conventional antibiotics is their inability to penetrate biofilms, the main protective strategy for bacteria to evade irradiation. Previously, we have shown that synthetic antimicrobial peptides could inhibit bacterial biofilms formation. In this study, we first delineated how Nal-P-113, a novel antimicrobial peptide, exerted its inhibitory effects on Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 biofilms formation at a low concentration. Secondly, we performed gene expression profiling and validated that Nal-P-113 at a low dose significantly down-regulated genes related to mobile and extrachromosomal element functions, transport and binding proteins in Porphyromonas gingivalis W83. These findings suggest that Nal-P-113 at low dose is sufficient to inhibit the formation of biofilms although Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 may maintain its survival in the oral cavity. The newly discovered molecular pathways may add the knowledge of developing a new strategy to target bacterial infections in combination with current first-line treatment in periodontitis.\n\nAngiomyolipome rÃ©nal agressif avec extension Ã la veine rÃ©nale: Ã ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nExceptionnellement la tumeur peut avoir un caractÃ¨re agressive avec extension locorÃ©gionale et veineuse (la veine rÃ©nale et la veine cave inferieure).

[Fermilab\n\n2016-03-01\n\nE-36, an experiment on small angle proton-proton scattering, began testing equipment in the National Accelerator Laboratoryâs newly achieved 100-GeV beam on February 12, 1972, marking the beginning of NALâs experimental program. This experiment, which drew collaborators from NAL, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR at Dubna, USSR), the University of Rochester (Rochester, New York) and Rockefeller University (New York City) was significant not only as a milestone in Fermilabâs history but also as a model of cooperation between the East and West at a time when Cold War tensions still ran high.

The exercise demonstrates that, because participants are not willing to exchange their own opinion at random for another differing opinion to which the owner is, by the participantsâ own admission, entitled, they treat their entitlement to their own opinion differently, giving it a special status. This gives rise to rational obligations such as the obligation to provide reasons, and a willingness to risk those opinions to the force of the better reason.\n\nApplication of the No Action Level (NAL) protocol to correct for prostate motion based on electronic portal imaging of implanted markers\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBoer, Hans C.J. de; Os, Marjolein J.H. van; Jansen, Peter P.; Heijmen, Ben J.M.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nPurpose: To evaluate the efficacy of the No Action Level (NAL) off-line correction protocol in the reduction of systematic prostate displacements as determined from electronic portal images (EPI) using implanted markers. Methods and materials: Four platinum markers, two near the apex and two near the base of the prostate, were implanted for localization purposes in patients who received fractionated high dose rate brachytherapy. During the following course of 25 fractions of external beam radiotherapy, the position of each marker relative to the corresponding position in digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) was measured in EPI in 15 patients for on average 17 fractions per patient. These marker positions yield the composite displacements due to both setup error and internal prostate motion, relative to the planning computed tomography scan. As the NAL protocol is highly effective in reducing systematic errors (recurring each fraction) due to setup inaccuracy alone, we investigated its efficacy in reducing systematic composite displacements. The analysis was performed for the center of mass (COM) of the four markers, as well as for the cranial and caudal markers separately. Furthermore, the impact of prostate rotation on the achieved positioning accuracy was determined. Results: In case of no setup corrections, the standard deviations of the systematic composite displacements of the COM were 3-4 mm in the craniocaudal and anterior-posterior directions, and 2 mm in the left-right direction. The corresponding SDs of the random displacements (interfraction fluctuations) were 2-3 mm in each direction. When applying a NAL protocol based on three initial treatment fractions, the SDs of the systematic COM displacements were reduced to 1-2 mm. Displacements at the cranial end of the prostate were slightly larger than at the caudal end, and quantitative analysis showed this originates from left-right axis rotations about the prostate apex. Further analysis revealed\n\np Effe prolife ect of s eration cultur season and s res of H nal coll ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nSAM\n\n2014-08-07\n\nAug 7, 2014 ... of rubber tree occurred both in summer and rainy season.

Social well-being was based on Keyesâ model (1998 and psychological well-being on Ryffâs model (1989. Participants and procedure The study was performed in three nations (Poland, Puerto Rico and Vietnam on student samples (Poland, n = 245, Vietnam, n = 115, and Puerto Rico, n = 300. To assess entitlement level the Entitlement Questionnaire was used. The level of hedonistic well-being was measured with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS, and eudaimonic well-being by the Mental Health ContinuumâShort Form (MHC-SF. Results Active entitlement was positively related to all aspects of SWB. Revenge entitlement was negatively related to hedonistic and psychological SWB in all samples and negatively related to social well-being only in Poland. Passive entitlement was unrelated to SWB. Conclusions The current study shows cross-cultural similarities in relationships of entitlement with hedonistic and psychological well-being and cross-cultural differences in the relationship of entitlement with social well-being. Additionally, the study indicates positive meaning of healthy aspects of entitlement for subjective well-being and negative meaning of dysfunctional aspects of entitlement for subjective well-being.\n\nAcademic Entitlement in the Context of Learning Styles\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAndrey, Jean; Joakim, Erin; Schoner, Vivian; Hambly, Derrick; Silver, Amber; Jayasundera, Rohan; Nelson, Allen\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study explores the linkages between students' sense of entitlement and their approaches to learning, based on survey research at a large public university in Canada.

Biofilm formation favours the colonization of the host and the subsequent carrier state. Two different strategies of biofilm formation, either dependent or independent on extracellular DNA (eDNA), have been described for meningococcal strains. Here, we demonstrate that the autotransporter protease NalP, the expression of which is phase variable, affects eDNA-dependent biofilm formation in N.meningitidis. The effect of NalP was found in biofilm formation under static and flow conditions and was dependent on its protease activity. Cleavage of the heparin-binding antigen NhbA and the Î±-peptide of IgA protease, resulting in the release of positively charged polypeptides from the cell surface, was responsible for the reduction in biofilm formation when NalP is expressed. Both NhbA and the Î±-peptide of IgA protease were shown to bind DNA. We conclude that NhbA and the Î±-peptide of IgA protease are implicated in biofilm formation by binding eDNA and that NalP is an important regulator of this process through the proteolysis of these surface-exposed proteins.

This objective can be accomplished in a cost-effective manner under a planned and documented quality system of activities. It is well-known that serious deficiencies can occur in laboratory operations when insufficient attention is given to the quality of the work. It requires not only a thorough knowledge of the laboratory's purpose and operation, but also the dedication of the management and operating staff to standards of excellence. Laboratories employing nuclear and nuclear-related analytical techniques are sometimes confronted with performance problems which prevent them from becoming accepted and respected by clients, such as industry, government and regulatory bodies, and from being eligible for contracts. The International Standard ISO 17025 has been produced as the result of extensive experience in the implementation of ISO/IEC Guide 25:1990 and EN 45001:1989, which replaces both of them now. It contains all of the requirements that testing and calibration laboratories must meet if they wish to demonstrate that they operate a quality system that is technically competent, and are able to generate technically valid results. The use of ISO 17025 should facilitate cooperation between laboratories and other bodies to assist in the exchange of information and experience, and in the harmonization of standards and procedures. IAEA model project RER/2/004 entitled 'Quality Assurance/Quality Control in Nuclear Analytical Techniques' was initiated in 1999 as a Regional TC project in East European countries to assist Member State laboratories in the region to install a complete quality system according to the ISO/IEC 17025 standard. 12 laboratories from 11 countries plus the Agency's Laboratories in Seibersdorf have been selected as participants to undergo exercises and training with the\n\nAngiomyolipome rÃ©nal agressif avec extension Ã la veine rÃ©nale: Ã propos d'un cas et une revue de la littÃ©rature\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMajdoub, Aziz El; Khallouk, Abdelhak; Farih, Moulay Hassan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nL'angiomyolipome rÃ©nal est une tumeur qui est reconnue bÃ©nigne.

Job satisfaction measurement included employeesâ affective response to their overall job and to various aspects of their job. The three aspects of organizational commitment (affective, instrumental and normative were measured. Results Active entitlement had a positive effect on satisfaction with results, satisfaction with supervisor, pay satisfaction and overall job satisfaction. It was not related to organizational commitment. Passive entitlement had a positive effect on satisfaction with tasks, but it correlated negatively with pay satisfaction. Higher level of passive entitlement predicted instrumental commitment. Revengefulness was negatively related to task satisfaction, satisfaction with supervisor and overall satisfaction, and had a negative effect on affective commitment. Conclusions Different forms of entitlement have a diverse influence on the various aspects of job satisfaction and components of organizational commitment. Active and passive types of entitlement are more adaptive, whereas revengefulness is a maladaptive and dysfunctional attitude.\n\n24 CFR 81.93 - Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; security interests.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 24 Housing and Urban Development 1 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Creation of Participant's Security...

The authors examined the role of academic entitlement as a mediator of the relationship between permissive parenting and psychological functioning. Participants were 524 undergraduate students at a single institution (52% female; age range = 18-22). Data collection was completed in May 2011. Cross-sectional design. Participants completed online self-report measures of parenting styles, academic entitlement, stress, depressive symptoms, and well-being. Permissive parenting was associated with greater academic entitlement and, in turn, to more perceived stress and poorer mental health. Mother/father differences were found in some cases. Academic entitlement may partially explain why permissive parenting is detrimentally related to mental health for college students. Implications for academic affairs and counseling include helping students develop an appreciation of the role of self-regulation in college success.\n\n18 CFR 1314.5 - Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; security interests.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 18 Conservation of Power and Water Resources 2 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Creation of Participant...

The synthesis of a dipeptide (Boc-Ala-Gly-OPac) using amines for the conversion afforded an unsatisfactory yield with by-products. On the other hand, the use of neutral alumina-supported Na(2) CO(3) (Na(2)CO(3) /n-Al(2)O(3)) as a solid base for the conversion provided the dipeptide in a quantitative yield without by-products. The application of Na(2)CO(3) /n-Al2 O3 to the synthesis of some dipeptides protected by Pac ester gave the desired peptides in excellent yields.

Self-report scores of entitlement were collected for 916 individuals using an online platform. Model-based cluster analyses were conducted on the individuals with scores one standard deviation above mean (n = 159) using the five-factor model dimensions as clustering variables. The results support the existence of two groups of entitled individuals categorized as emotionally stable and emotionally vulnerable. The emotionally stable cluster reported emotional stability, high self-esteem, more positive affect, and antisocial behavior. The emotionally vulnerable cluster reported low self-esteem and high levels of neuroticism, disinhibition, conventionality, psychopathy, negative affect, childhood abuse, intrusive parenting, and attachment difficulties. Compared to the control group, both clusters reported being more antagonistic, extraverted, Machiavellian, and narcissistic. These results suggest important differences are missed when simply examining the linear relationships between entitlement and various aspects of its nomological network.\n\nRestricted health care entitlements for child migrants in Europe and Australia\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nÃstergaard, Liv Stubbe; Norredam, Marie; Mock-Munoz de Luna, Claire\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground: More than 300 000 asylum seeking children were registered in Europe alone during 2015.

This opens the door to the feasibility of new installations based on hydrokinetic microturbines even in zones of moderate speed. In this context, the accuracy of energy predictions based on hydrodynamic models is of paramount importance. This research presents a high precision methodology based on a multidimensional hydrodynamic model that is used to study the energetic potential in estuaries. Moreover, it is able to estimate the flow variations caused by microturbine installations. The paper also shows the results obtained from the application of the methodology in a study of the NalÃ³n river mouth (Asturias, Spain).\n\nPermissive Parenting and Mental Health in College Students: Mediating Effects of Academic Entitlement\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBarton, Alison L.; Hirsch, Jameson K.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective: Student mental health may suffer due to unreasonable expectations associated with academic entitlement; permissive parenting may be one source of these expectations.

Any reforms to the equalization grant system have to balance three concerns â âefficiencyâ effects that arise through federal financing of transfers, and the incentive effects on provincial fiscal policies, âentitlementâ to reasonably comparable public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation, and âownershipâ of resources and independence of fiscal policies by provincial governments. Five proposals for reform of the equalization system are discussed. With regard to the inclusion rate for resource revenues in equalization formula, we argue that the rate should be reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent and that ceiling on total equalization payments should be eliminated. We argue against the proposal to exempt from the calculation of equalization entitlements that are deposited in provincial sovereign wealth funds because this would not reduce total equalization entitlements in present value terms, it would be complex to implement if it extended to all forms of savings by provinces (such as debt reduction, and it would not alter the resource rich provincesâ incentives to save more of their resource revenues. We argue against a proposal to reduce CHT and CST to provinces with above average fiscal capacities because this would reduce their incentive to develop and tax their resources, and it would be counter to the purpose of these block grants, which is to reduce the vertical fiscal imbalance between the federal and the provincial governments. We review the Gusen (2012a proto-type model for incorporating variations in costs and needs in the computation of the equalization entitlements and argue that this procedure seems feasible and merits further analysis.\n\n20 CFR 404.337 - When does my entitlement to widow's and widower's benefits start and end?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 20 Employees' Benefits 2 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false When does my entitlement to widow's and widower's benefits start and end? 404.337 Section 404.337 Employees' Benefits SOCIAL SECURITY... does my entitlement to widow's and widower's benefits start and end?

In this study, the probable effects of TiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles (n-TiO2, n-Al2O3) on the toxicity of Cr(VI) were assessed with the dominant freshwater algae, Scenedesmus obliquus, in a low range of exposure concentrations (0.05, 0.5 and 1Î¼g/mL). In the presence of 0.05Î¼g/mL n-TiO2, the toxicity of Cr(VI) decreased considerably, which was presumably due to the Cr(VI) adsorption on the nanoparticle surface leading to its aggregation and precipitation. The elevated n-TiO2 concentrations (0.5 and 1Î¼g/mL) did not significantly influence Cr(VI) bio-availability, and a dose dependent toxicity of Cr(VI) was observed. On the other hand, n-Al2O3 did not have any significant effect on the Cr(VI) toxicity. The microscopic observations presented additional information on the morphological changes of the algal cells in the presence of the binary toxicants. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) suggested contribution of oxidative stress on toxicity and LDH release confirmed membrane permeability of algal cells upon stress.

Five studies demonstrated that higher social class is associated with increased entitlement and narcissism. Upper-class individuals reported greater psychological entitlement (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2) and narcissistic personality tendencies (Study 2), and they were more likely to behave in a narcissistic fashion by opting to look at themselves in a mirror (Study 3). Finally, inducing egalitarian values in upper-class participants decreased their narcissism to a level on par with their lower-class peers (Study 4). These findings offer novel evidence regarding the influence of social class on the self and highlight the importance of social stratification to understanding basic psychological processes.\n\n75 FR 68035 - Proposed Information Collection (Evidence for Transfer of Entitlement of Education Benefits...\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-11-04\n\n...

WhileKÄ±nalÄ±zÃ¢de represents an Ottoman State that was at the zenith of itspower at the end of the 16th century, Machiavelli represents Italy thatwas at the time an unstable and divided political structure. These twoscholars who lived roughly around the same time in quite differentgeographies, naturally, sought to remedy the problems of their owncountries. Nonetheless, they both had the same target in mind; carryingtheir homelands to greater heights. Both being the children of theirtime, they were involved in ways of thinking in line with thecircumstances of their societies. As a natural consequence of therealities they were in, the prescriptions they were to present to therulers of their homelands would vary to a great extent given thatKÄ±nalÄ±zÃ¢de was living in Ottoman soil where the prevailing atmospherewas that of order and stability, while Machiavelli was living in an Italyriddled with chaos and political immorality. KÄ±nalÄ±zÃ¢de was able tosearch for virtues by capitalizing on the fact that his country hadalready established a well working order. However, according toMachiavelli, it would be a mere waste of time to speak of virtues in aplace with no established order.

In an open-ended qualitative inquiry, 56 individuals with waitstaff experience described the types of behaviors entitled customers engage in and the kinds of service-related \"perks\" these individuals feel deserving of. Participants explained how they responded to entitled customers, how and when managers became involved, and how their dealings with these patrons influenced their subjective physical and psychological well-being. We found that the behaviors of entitled customers negatively impacted waitstaff employees. Participants reported physiological arousal, negative affect, burnout, and feelings of dehumanization as a result of dealing with these patrons. While respondents drew on a variety of strategies to manage their encounters with entitled customers, they indicated workplace support was often informal and described feeling abandoned by management in dealing with this workplace stressor. Approaching customer entitlement as a form of microaggression, we offer recommendations for practice and suggest new directions for future research. .

This paper draws on qualitative data from two groups typically at risk of transport exclusion: young people (12-18 years of age, n = 118) and older citizens (60+ years of age, n = 46). The data were collected in London, UK, where young people and older citizens are currently entitled to concessionary bus travel. We focus on how this entitlement is understood and enacted, and how different sources of entitlement mediate the relationship between transport and wellbeing. Both groups felt that their formal entitlement to travel for free reflected their social worth and was, particularly for older citizens, relatively unproblematic. The provision of a concessionary transport entitlement also helped to combat feelings of social exclusion by enhancing recipients' sense of belonging to the city and to a 'community'. However, informal entitlements to particular spaces on the bus reflected less valued social attributes such as need or frailty. Thus in the course of travelling by bus the enactment of entitlements to space and seats entailed the negotiation of social differences and personal vulnerabilities, and this carried with it potential threats to wellbeing. We conclude that the process, as well as the substance, of entitlement can mediate wellbeing; and that where the basis for providing a given entitlement is widely understood and accepted, the risks to wellbeing associated with enacting that entitlement will be reduced.

Since 1985, activities in this field, carried out with the technical co-operation of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) under the ARCAL (Regional Co-operative Arrangements for the Promotion of Nuclear Science and Technology in Latin America) Programme have produced satisfactory results. The ARCAL Programme started with 10 countries and nine projects, one of the most important being the project entitled 'Radiation Protection' (ARCAL I) carried out in two phases: 1985-90 and 1991-93. Work continued with ARCAL XVII (1994-96), entitled 'Radiation Protection Legal Framework', in which 18 countries participated. ARCAL XX entitled 'Control of Radiation Sources' is currently under way. ARCAL projects I and XVII have contributed enormously to improving radiation protection in the region through the implementation of numerous activities such as national and regional courses, seminars, workshops, expert meetings, training courses, expert missions, supply of equipment, regional congresses, the ARCAL Bulletin called 'Proteccion Radiological', etc. Radiological emergencies have been a priority subject in various projects, particularly ARCAL I, under which the first regional course was held in 1991 with participants from 10 countries and lecturers from the region. ARCAL I was very useful in promoting the exchange of experience, in providing staff with training opportunities involving countries with more experience in this field and in the training of staff at the national level.

The strength of this relation can, however, vary widely from study to study. Narcissism and revenge were examined in 84 independent samples (Nâ=â11297), along with the moderating role of sample type (i.e., child/adolescent, prisoner, undergraduate, or general samples), type of narcissism measure used (i.e., Narcissistic Personality Inventory, Psychological Entitlement Scale, Short D3, etc.), the nature of the provocation, and the type of provoked aggression examined. Narcissism was positively related to provoked aggression across studies (Ïâ=â.25), but that relation was stronger in child/adolescent samples (Ïâ=â.36) and when measures of entitlement or vulnerable narcissism were employed (Ïâ=â.29). Implications for practical research, as well as neglected areas of research on narcissism and provoked aggression are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 42:362-379, 2016. Â© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Diagnosis has expanded due to radiolabelling of DOTA-peptides such as somatostatin analogue DOTA-1-Nal 3 -Octreotide (DOTA-NOC) conjugated to Î²+ emitting radionuclides such as 68 Ga, which has very favorable physics-nuclear properties. This paper describes the radiolabeling procedures of DOTA-NOC with 68 Ga, in pure aqueous medium and in presence of non-aqueous solvents as well as the methods used for quality control where a formulation is obtained with a radiochemical yield exceeding 95%. The addition of ethanol (30% - v / v) to reaction mixture allowed to increase the specific activity of 68 Ga-DOTA-NOC radioconjugate, reaching a value of 182 MBq / nmol, higher than reported in the literature (50 MBq / nmol ) for labeling in pure aqueous medium. Stability studies are also presented (in presence of saline solution and saline phosphate buffer, transmetallation studies in Fe 3+ , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ and Zn 2+ solutions, challenges competition against EDTA and DTPA chelators and in vitro stability in human transferrin) performed to 68Ga-DOTA-NOC radioconjugated, showing its high stability (> 95%).

Two hundred and forty-eight university undergraduate students completed measures of agentic and communal narcissism, self-esteem, psychological entitlement and satisfaction with life. The findings suggest that there is support for the usefulness of the agentic-communal model of narcissism, and, consistent with predictions in the wider literature, self-esteem and psychological entitlement mediated the relationship between agentic-communal narcissism and life satisfaction.
