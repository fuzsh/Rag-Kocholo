“Gastón Orellana is the classic forward-thinking artist; his individual path through an artistic landscape that spans half a century is truly unique.

With his energy he digs into the cultural layering and wealth of artistic heritage, which he integrates with an existentialist engagement with the present. His devotion to experimentation and innovation creates an artistic chronicle of the contemporary that brings us closer to ourselves.

Beyond frontiers and artistic styles, the work of Gastón Orellana deserves in-depth research, to be known, to allow it to enrich us.”
