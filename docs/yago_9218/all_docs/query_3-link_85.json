        "text": "CHOCÓ BY JHONNY HENDRIX HINESTROZA Choco is a hard-working woman with two children and a drunkard musician for a husband. In the mornings, Choco works in a gold mine along the San Juan river. In the afternoons, she cleans clothes for richer families. When her daughter turns 7, the only thing Choco wants is to buy her a birthday cake. A humble wish that could change her life. ABOUT THE FILM The director chose a realistic path to create a human drama, not a feminist one but one that was only human, with credible characters. Therefore when he came up with this movie he always knew that the only way to accomplish it was by using natural actors, a region with people who have never been seen in films before, people with a unique shine on their skin, with a unique accent and rhythm that characterizes them and makes them distinguish from all the other regions of Colombia. Chocó is the story of a woman from the rural areas in the pacific coast of Colombia, subjugated by her husband and by the dominant male tradition from this part of the country. She portrays the life of many women who undergo violence and mistreatment at home not only in Colombia but also in the entire world. Chocó cannot sing, she can barely cry. Her husband ignores her as she works hard to support her family. Her life is a river of solitude and it is also the living proof of how the love for ones children and the acceptance of cultural traditions can misguide people’s conceptions, leading them to understand and perceive cruelty and mistreatment as something natural."
