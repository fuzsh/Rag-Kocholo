        "text": "Access every screening in the UCLA Festival of Preservation with a $50 pass.\n\nEnamorada (Mexico, 1946)\n\nPreservation funding provided by The Film Foundation's World Cinema Project and the Material World Charitable Foundation.\n\nEnamorada, which translates as “A Woman in Love,” is a loose adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew. Macho man and Mexican revolutionary General Reyes (Armendáriz) conquers the pueblo of Cholula, then falls hopelessly in love with Beatriz Peñafiel, the daughter of the richest and most conservative man in town. Embodied by María Félix, she knocks him off his feet with a slap after he whistles at her, then literally blows him off his horse with a bomb. Hollywood called it “meeting cute.” The “taming” here consists of the General getting down on his knees repeatedly and asking her for forgiveness for all the atrocities he has committed. She does fall eventually, signaled by an extreme close-up of Beatriz awakening to love, as Reyes serenades her under her window. The final scene pays homage to Josef von Sternberg's Morocco (1930), but this is one of the masterpieces of Mexican cinema.—Jan-Christopher Horak\n\nDCP, b/w, in Spanish with English subtitles, 99 min.
