The movie follows a Christ-like person to the Holy Montain, taken by an alchemist with seven materialistic figures, to find enlightenment for them. It wasn’t very well accepted for the conservative public, because it contains nudity and criticizes religion in a very harsh way.\n\nCast: Alejandro Jodorowsky, Horacio Salinas, Zamira Saunders, Juan Ferrara, Adriana Page.\n\n4. Ahí esta el detalle – Juan Bustillo Oro (1940)\n\nThe best film of the incomparable Mario Moreno, known as “Cantinflas”, in which Cantinflas (Mario Moreno) goes to the house where his girlfriend works as a maid and she needs him to kill a dog, but everything gets complicated when her boss thinks his wife is having an affair.
