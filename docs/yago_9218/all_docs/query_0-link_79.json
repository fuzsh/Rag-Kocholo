The variation of the muon counting rate during the Forbush decrease was also extracted for different intervals of the azimuthal angle of the incoming muons.\n\nUpdate of ESA EEE parts relifing rules\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLe Blanc, P.; Aicardi, C.\n\n2002-12-01\n\nStorage of EEE part represents a key process in space electronics activity. In order to cope with projects time schedule on one hand and with economical procurement constraints on the other hand, parts are often to be stored for quite a long time. Obsolescence issues could make us to build strategic stock in order to be able to still manufacture equipments over time. Up to now several documents ruled the way to de-store (relifed) EEE part in such a way we are able to guaranty their reliability despite their long period of storage. None of these documents backed up their figures and rules with consistent approach and physics. No field return existed or was used to assess these rules. In the frame of a contract from CNES we established an updated rule taking into account field-return and failure mechanisms analysis .We ended up by a new storage and de-storage procedure that is to be included in the ECSS format.\n\nEEE project special detector PolarquEEEst\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nOrdan, Julien Marius\n\n2018-01-01\n\nStudents from Norway, Italy and Geneva (college Voltaire) cam to CERN to follow seminars on cosmic rays and to assemble a special cosmic ray detector prototype, PolarquuEEEst, to be installed on board Arctic sailing vessel Nanuq to detect cosmic rays close to the North Pole this summer.

De; Bencivenni, G.; Dreucci, M.; Fabbri, F.L.; Coccia, E.; Giovanni, A. Di; D'Incecco, M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Extreme Energy Events (EEE) Project is meant to be the most extensive experiment to detect secondary cosmic particles in Italy. To this aim, more than 50 telescopes have been built at CERN and installed in high schools distributed all over the Italian territory. Each EEE telescope comprises three large area Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPCs) and is capable of reconstructing the trajectories of the charged particles traversing it with a good angular resolution. The excellent performance of the EEE telescopes allows a large variety of studies, from measuring the local muon flux in a single telescope, to detecting extensive air showers producing time correlations in the same metropolitan area, to searching for large-scale correlations between showers detected in telescopes tens, hundreds or thousands of kilometers apart. In addition to its scientific goal, the EEE Project also has an educational and outreach objective, its aim being to motivate young people by involving them directly in a real experiment. High school students and teachers are involved in the construction, testing and start-up of the EEE telescope in their school, then in its maintenance and data-acquisition, and later in the analysis of the data. During the last couple of years a great boost has been given to the EEE Project through the organization of simultaneous and centralized data taking with the whole telescope array. The raw data from all telescopes are transferred to CNAF (Bologna), where they are reconstructed and stored. The data are currently being analyzed, looking at various topics: variation of the rate of cosmic muons with time, upward going muons, muon lifetime, search for anisotropies in the muon angular distribution and for time coincidences between stations. In this paper an overall description of the experiment is given, including the design, construction and performance of the telescopes. The operation of the whole array is also presented by showing the most recent\n\nEEE (environmental engineering economics) attributes for oil and gas industry\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIsreb, M.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis paper outlined the basic attributes of environmental engineering economics (EEE) with reference to the oil and gas industry in Australia. The paper was designed as a reference guide for policy-makers, educators, and environmental engineers. Methods of calculating the Pareto Optimum status were discussed, and environmental values and principles were identified. Air quality indicators were outlined. The paper considered multidisciplinary approaches to EEE and sustainable development, as well as the application of statistics and qualitative methods in addressing contemporary issues. The ethical aspects of environmental policies were discussed. Issues related to environmental toxicity and public health were also examined. Various taxation approaches and financial incentives were reviewed. Environmental laws related to the oil and gas industry were outlined. Environmental assessment procedures were presented. It was concluded that environmental regulations within the industry will help to ensure appropriate pollution reductions. 7 refs\n\nThe EEE Project status and perspectives\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAntolini, R; Baldini Ferroli, R; Bencivenni, G; Blanco, F; Bressan, E; Chiavassa, A; Cifarelli, L; Cindolo, F; Coccia, E; De Pasquale, S; Di Giovanni, A; D'Incecco, M; Fabbri, F L; Garbini, M; Gustavino, C; Hatzifotiadou, D; Imponente, G; La Rocca, P; Librizzi, F; Menghetti, H; Miozzi, S; Pappalardo,G S; Piragino, G; Riggi, F; Sartorelli, G; Sbarra, C; Selvi, M; Williams, C; Zichichi, A\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Extreme Energy Events (EEE) project plans to build and use an array of cosmic ray telescopes for muon detection, distributed over the italian territory. The use of such telescopes, based on Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPC) will allow the study of cosmic ray showers and the correlation between multiple primaries producing distant showers. The project is also intended to involve high school teams in an advanced research work. The physics items which can be addressed by such array, and the present status and perspectives of the project are here discussed.\n\nComputational Flow Field in Energy Efficient Engine (EEE)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMiki, Kenji; Moder, Jeff; Liou, Meng-Sing\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn this paper, preliminary results for the recently-updated Open National Combustion Code (Open NCC) as applied to the EEE are presented. The comparison between two different numerical schemes, the standard Jameson-Schmidt-Turkel (JST) scheme and the advection upstream splitting method (AUSM), is performed for the cold flow and the reacting flow calculations using the RANS. In the cold flow calculation, the AUSM scheme predicts a much stronger reverse flow in the central recirculation zone. In the reacting flow calculation, we test two cases: gaseous fuel injection and liquid spray injection. In the gaseous fuel injection case, the overall flame structures of the two schemes are similar to one another, in the sense that the flame is attached to the main nozzle, but is detached from the pilot nozzle. However, in the exit temperature profile, the AUSM scheme shows a more uniform profile than that of the JST scheme, which is close to the experimental data. In the liquid spray injection case, we expect different flame structures in this scenario. We will give a brief discussion on how two numerical schemes predict the flame structures inside the EEE using different ways to introduce the fuel injection.\n\nNASA EEE Parts and NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) Program Update 2018\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLabel, Kenneth A.; Sampson, Michael J.; Pellish, Jonathan A.; Majewicz, Peter J.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nNASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) Program and NASA Electronic Parts Assurance Group (NEPAG) are NASAs point-of-contacts for reliability and radiation tolerance of EEE parts and their packages.

The NASA EEE Parts Standard, NASA-STD 8739.10\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMajewicz, Peter; Sampson, Michael\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDescribes development and content of a new NASA Standard for Electrical Electronic and Electromechanical (EEE) parts. This Standard reflects current practices, instead of changing them. Most NASA Centers utilize local documents, but there is minimal consistency across the Agency. A gap analysis clearly shows the differences that exist among the different centers and with respect to the NASA Parts Policy. Once approved, the new standard can be referenced in contracts and agreements with organizations outside of NASA.\n\nThe NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) Program: Overview and the New Tenets for Cost Conscious Mission Assurance on Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical (EEE) Parts\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLaBel, Kenneth A.; Sampson, Michael J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe NEPP Program focuses on the reliability aspects of electronic devices (integrated circuits such as a processor in a computer). There are three principal aspects of this reliability: 1) Lifetime, inherent failure and design issues related to the EEE parts technology and packaging; 2) Effects of space radiation and the space environment on these technologies, and; 3) Creation and maintenance of the assurance support infrastructure required for mission success. The NEPP mission is to provide guidance to NASA for the selection and application of microelectronics technologies, to improve understanding of the risks related to the use of these technologies in the space environment, and to ensure that appropriate EEE parts research is performed to meet NASA mission assurance needs. NEPPs FY15 goals are to represent the NASA voice to the greater aerospace EEE parts community including supporting anti-counterfeit and trust, provide relevant guidance to cost-effective missions, aid insertion of advanced (and commercial) technologies, resolve unexpected parts issues, ensure access to appropriate radiation test facilities, and collaborate as widely as possible with external entities. In accordance with the changing mission profiles throughout NASA, the NEPP Program has developed a balanced portfolio of efforts to provide agency-wide assurance for not only traditional spacecraft developments, but also those in-line with the new philosophies emerging worldwide. In this presentation, we shall present an overview of this program and considerations for EEE parts assurance as applied to cost conscious missions.\n\nRecent results and performance of the multi-gap resistive plate chambers network for the EEE Project\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAbbrescia, M.; Avanzini, C.; Baldini, L.; Baldini Ferroli, R.; Batignani, G.; Bencivenni, G.; Bossini, E.; Chiavassa, A.; CicalÃ², C.; Cifarelli, L.; Coccia, E.; Corvaglia, A.; De Gruttola, D.; De Pasquale, S.; Di Giovanni, A.; D`Incecco, M.; Dreucci, M.; Fabbri, F.

Each telescope is a tracking detector composed of three Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPC) with an active area of 1.60 Ã 0.80 m2. Their characteristics are similar to the ones built for the Time Of Flight array of the ALICE Experimentat LHC . The EEE Project started with a few pilot towns, where the telescopes have been taking data since 2008, and it has been constantly extended, reaching at present more than 50 MRPCs telescopes. They are spread across Italy with two additional stations at CERN, covering an area of around 3 Ã 105 km2, with a total surface area for all the MRPCs of 190 m2. A comprehensive description of the MRPCs network is reported here: efficiency, time and spatial resolution measured using cosmic rays hitting the telescopes. The most recent results on the detector and physics performance from a series of coordinated data acquisition periods are also presented.\n\nEvaluaciÃ³n de un modelo de formaciÃ³n inicial de profesores para su adaptaciÃ³n al EEES.

The single tracking telescope is composed of three large area () Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPCs). The data collected by the telescopes will be used for studies of air showers and also for the search of time correlations between sites which are far apart. The first telescope, recently installed in the Liceo B. Touschek in Grottaferrata (Rome), is successfully running, and other telescopes are going to be installed in a short time in other towns, opening up the way for the first search of long-distance coincidences over a total area of .\n\nMaterial Implications of Rural ElectrificationâA Methodological Framework to Assess In-Use Stocks of Off-Grid Solar Products and EEE in Rural Households in Bangladesh\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlexander Batteiger\n\n2018-02-01\n\nFull Text Available âUniversal access to electricityâ is proclaimed as the seventh sustainable development goal (SDG 7 of the United Nations (UN Sustainable Development Goals list. The achievement of this goal will result in a rapid diffusion of energy technologies that would in turn increase materials stocks, subsequently increase the raw material demand as well as the arising waste flows. This study describes a methodological framework to assess in-use stocks of off-grid solar products and electrical and electronic equipment (EEE for rural communities in developing countries. The methodology is based on energy-access data. Furthermore, the specifics of the characteristics of off-grid solar products are discussed. The methodology is applied to rural Bangladesh and its solar home system (SHS program. By the end of 2016, around 4.1 million SHSs were installed. This type of access to electricity has a significant impact on the in-use stocks, as households add the comparatively heavy SHSs to their in-use stocks. In-use stocks of EEE, in general, are low. Off-grid solar products are lighter than standard EEE, and fewer products types are available. These findings will help to better understand material stocks and future waste flows in the given context and will support the adaption of recycling infrastructures.\n\nTowards the installation and use of an extended array for cosmic ray detection The EEE Project\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAbbrescia, M; An, S; Antolini, R; Badala, A; Baek, Y W; Baldini Ferroli, R; Bencivenni, G; Blanco, F; Bressan, E; Chiavassa, A; Chiri,C; CicalÃ², C; Cifarelli, L; Coccia, E; Coccetti, F; De Caro, A; De Gruttola, D; De Pasquale, S; D'Incecco, M; Fabbri, F L; Frolov, V; Garbini, M; Garnaccia, C; Gustavino, C; Hatzifotiadou, D; Imponente, G; Kim, J S; Kim, M M; La Rocca, P; Librizzi, F; Maggiora, A; Menghetti, H; Miozzi, S; Moro, R; Noferini, F; Pagano, P; Panareo, M; Pappalardo, G S; Petta, C; Piragino, G; Preghenella, R; Riggi, F; Romano, F; Russo, G; Sartorelli, G; Sbarra, C; Scioli, G; Selvi, M; Serci, S; Siddi, E; Wenninger, H; Williams, M C S; Zampolli, C; Zichichi, A; Zuyeuski, R\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe Extreme Energy Events (EEE) project started to use an array of cosmic ray telescopes for muon detection, distributed over the italian territory.

The use of such telescopes, based on Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPC) allows the study of the local muon flux, the detection of cosmic ray showers and the search for correlations between distant showers. The project is also intended to involve high school teams in an advanced research work. The present status of the installation and the first physics results are discussed here.\n\nHigh Voltage EEE Parts for EMA/EHA Applications on Manned Launch Vehicles\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGriffin, Trent; Young, David\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe objective of this paper is an assessment of high voltage electronic components required for high horsepower electric thrust vector control (TVC) systems for human spaceflight launch critical application. The scope consists of creating of a database of available Grade 1 electrical, electronic and electromechanical (EEE) parts suited to this application, a qualification path for potential non-Grade 1 EEE parts that could be used in these designs, and pathfinder testing to validate aspects of the proposed qualification plan. Advances in the state of the art in high power electric power systems enable high horsepower electric actuators, such as the electromechnical actuator (EMA) and the electro-hydrostatic actuator (EHA), to be used in launch vehicle TVC systems, dramaticly reducing weight, complexity and operating costs. Designs typically use high voltage insulated gate bipolar transistors (HV-IGBT). However, no Grade 1 HV-IGBT exists and it is unlikely that market factors alone will produce such high quality parts. Furthermore, the perception of risk, the lack of qualification methodoloy, the absence of manned space flight heritage and other barriers impede the adoption of commercial grade parts onto the critical path. The method of approach is to identify high voltage electronic component types and key parameters for parts currently used in high horsepower EMA/EHA applications, to search for higher quality substitutes and custom manufacturers, to create a database for these parts, and then to explore ways to qualify these parts for use in human spaceflight launch critical application, including grossly derating and possibly treating hybrid parts as modules. This effort is ongoing, but results thus far include identification of over 60 HV-IGBT from four manufacturers, including some with a high reliability process flow. Voltage ranges for HV-IGBT have been identified, as has screening tests used to characterize HV-IGBT.

Considering the prohibition of production and the use of POP-PBDEs and knowing that these pollutants are still contained in electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and associated wastes (WEEE), it is necessary to determine their flows, especially in developing countries with limited end-of-life management. Following the inventory approach of the SC Guidance and utilizing the existing national e-waste inventory together with monitoring data, a material/substance flow analysis was conducted using the STAN tool. Within the period of 2000 to 2010, the total import for EEE/WEEE in Category 3 and 4 was approximately 8 million tonnes (Mt) containing approximately 2.4 Mt of polymers. For the inventory year 2010, it was estimated that from these polymers, about 0.8 Mt was still in stock and 1.6 Mt has reached the end-of-life. It was also estimated that approximately 1.1 Mt has ended in dumpsites, 0.3 Mt was burned in the open, and 0.2 Mt was recycled. In the plastic fractions, 1,270 t of POP-PBDEs was contained with about 370 t still in use/stock and approximately 900 t has entered the end-of-life phase. All three major end-of-life treatments result in environmental pollution with associated exposure risk. The implementation of the Stockholm Convention represents an important opportunity to improve this management situation in Nigeria and other developing countries.\n\nLa evaluacion de la docencia ante el reto del espacio europeo de educaciÃ³n superior (EEES\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCarmen CalderÃ³n Patier\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available El principal objetivo del proceso de convergencia de la enseÃ±anza superior que estamos viviendo, en el marco del Espacio Europeo de EducaciÃ³n Superior (EEES, es convertir a los sistemas universitarios europeos en un referente internacional por la calidad de la enseÃ±anza impartida.

Due to the serious nature of the disease, an investigational inactivated EEE vaccine (PE-6) is available to individuals at risk for infection. Both serologic and recent molecular analyses of EEE viruses have demonstrated marked differences between the two antigenic varieties of EEE virus, designated North American (NA) and South American (SA). In view of these findings, we have examined the reactivity of sera from three individuals immunized with the EEE vaccine, derived from an NA isolate, with field strains of EEE virus. Anti-EEE serum antibodies from vaccinees reacted strongly in Western blot assays with both of the envelope (E1 and E2) glycoproteins of each NA strain examined, while reactivities with the glycoproteins of SA strains were substantially weaker and variable and dependent upon both the immune response of the vaccinee and the virus isolate assayed. Most striking was the modest to virtual lack of reactivity with the E2 protein of SA strains. Antigenic differences among the glycoproteins of EEE viruses were not as pronounced in immunoprecipitation analysis. Most significantly, although human immune sera displayed high neutralizing titers against each of the NA isolates examined, only negligible neutralizing titers were obtained against SA isolates. These data suggest that immunized individuals would mount an effective antibody response against infection with NA strains of EEE virus, but that further investigation is clearly warranted to fully assess the protective capability of the vaccine against infection with SA strains.\n\nA preliminary categorization of end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment as secondary metal resources\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOguchi, Masahiro; Murakami, Shinsuke; Sakanakura, Hirofumi; Kida, Akiko; Kameya, Takashi\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHighlights: â End-of-life electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) as secondary metal resources. â The content and the total amount of metals in specific equipment are both important. â We categorized 21 EEE types from contents and total amounts of various metals. â Important equipment types as secondary resources were listed for each metal kind. â Collectability and possible collection systems of various EEE types were discussed. - Abstract: End-of-life electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) has recently received attention as a secondary source of metals. This study examined characteristics of end-of-life EEE as secondary metal resources to consider efficient collection and metal recovery systems according to the specific metals and types of EEE. We constructed an analogy between natural resource development and metal recovery from end-of-life EEE and found that metal content and total annual amount of metal contained in each type of end-of-life EEE should be considered in secondary resource development, as well as the collectability of the end-of-life products. We then categorized 21 EEE types into five groups and discussed their potential as secondary metal resources. Refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, and CRT TVs were evaluated as the most important sources of common metals, and personal computers, mobile phones, and video games were evaluated as the most important sources of precious metals. Several types of small digital equipment were also identified as important sources of precious metals; however, mid-size information and communication technology (ICT) equipment (e.g., printers and fax machines) and audio/video equipment were shown to be more important as a source of a variety of less common metals. The physical collectability of each type of EEE was roughly characterized by unit size and number of end-of-life products generated annually.

An empirical-evidence equilibrium (EEE) is a solution concept for stochastic games. At equilibrium, agents' strategies are optimal with respect to models of their opponents. These models satisfy a consistency condition with respect to the actual behavior of the opponents. As such, EEEs replace the full-rationality requirement of Nash equilibria by a consistency-based bounded-rationality one. In this paper, the framework of empirical evidence is summarized, with an emphasis on perfect-monitoring repeated games. A less constraining notion of consistency is introduced. The fact that an xEEE in a perfect-monitoring repeated game induces a correlated equilibrium on the underlying one-shot game is proven. This result and the new notion of consistency are illustrated on the hawk-dove game. Finally, a method to build specific correlated equilibria from xEEEs is derived.\n\nExogenous empirical-evidence equilibria in perfect-monitoring repeated games yield correlated equilibria\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nDudebout, Nicolas\n\n2014-12-15\n\nThis paper proves that exogenous empirical-evidence equilibria (xEEEs) in perfect-monitoring repeated games induce correlated equilibria of the associated one-shot game.

After explaining the reasons that make this happen, we consider the calculation of the rates for a process of the form l a l b âl a l c and its conjugate l-bar a l-bar b âl-bar a l-bar c , where l a ,l b ,l c denote charged leptons of different flavors. In the context of the standard model with Majorana neutrinos, we show that the difference in the rates depends on such phases. Our calculations illustrate in detail the mechanics that operate behind the scene, and set the stage for carrying out the analogous, more complicated (as we explain) calculations for other processes such as Î¼âeee-bar and its conjugate\n\nLa evaluaciÃ³n de los aprendizajes de los estudiantes en el marco del Espacio Europeo de EducaciÃ³n Superior (EEES: sus prÃ¡cticas, preferencias y evoluciÃ³n\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJavier Argos\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available El Espacio Europeo de EducaciÃ³n Superior (EEES comporta, al menos a nivel teÃ³rico, cambios sustanciales en los planteamientos formativos desarrollados que se concretan en diferentes Ã¡mbitos.

Many common crossing points emerged in UV-induced derivative-spectral changes to reveal the direct ZEZ-to-EEE photoisomerisation without the transient formation of an intermediate to suggest the bicycle-pedal mechanism. The solid-state photoisomerisation was subsequently monitored by tracing changes in the fourth-order derivatives of absorption spectra of a thin crystalline layer of ZEZ-DPH1 prepared by the drop-casting method, because the distortion of absorption spectra due to light scattering is cancelled. It was suggested that the solid-state photochemical event consists of three steps: fast ZEZ-to-EEE photoisomerisation, a subsequent slow ZEZ-to-EEE photoisomerisation and very slow disappearance of the EEE-isomer. Studies on powder XRD were also carried out for a drop-cast solid layer of ZEZ-DPH1 to disclose the coexistence of a crystal form other than the original one, and the former exhibited faster ZEZ-to-EEE photoisomerisation when compared with the original crystal form. The results revealed by XRD analysis are in line with those obtained by higher-order derivative spectra, confirming the solid-state one-way photoisomerisation to take place through the bicycle-pedal process.\n\nMRI findings in eastern equine encephalitis: the \"parenthesis\" sign.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNickerson, Joshua P; Kannabiran, Suma; Burbank, Heather N\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTwo patients with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) presented to a tertiary referral center. Both subjects' brain magnetic resonance imaging showed T2/FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) hyperintensities including linear areas of hyperintensity in the external and internal capsules with sparing of the lentiform nuclei. Single case reports of imaging findings in EEE exist with nonspecific patterns of abnormality. We propose that this \"( ) parentheses sign\" on T2 or FLAIR imaging may distinguish EEE from other processes. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Based on seroconversion of 31% of sympatric hatch-year sandhill cranes, Grus canadensis, and a previous 35% case fatality rate in whooping cranes, 17 (37%) of the 46 susceptible whooping cranes should have been exposed to virus and six should have died. As there were no deaths in these birds, the EEE vaccination program appeared to be efficacious in this whooping crane population.\n\nData of evolutionary structure change: 1M3DI-1T60W [Confc[Archive\n\nLifescience Database Archive (English)\n\nFull Text Available tryIDChain>1M3DI APLPM--MPVAE ...> -- EEE> ATOM 14546 CA ALA I 86 32.542 22.976 78.017 1.00...ain>1T60W EPMPMSMAPITG > EEE> IECHG-RGTCN >EEEE - EEEE.../entryIDChain> IECNGARGTCH >EEEEGGGEEEE>\n\nAnalogues of estradiol as potential breast tumor imaging agents\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGibson, R.E.; Rzeszotarski, W.J.; Ferriera, N.L.; Jagoda, E.M.; Reba, R.C.; Eckelman, W.C.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe radioiodinated analogue of estradiol, 11Î²-methoxy-17Î±-[/sup 125/I]iodovinylestradiol (MIVE/sub 2/), has been shown to be a good candidate for the imaging of estrogen dependent breast tumors. Although there has been no extensive study on the sensitivity of radiotracers of this type, the authors have not observed localization of the radiotracer in metastatic lesions containing less than 20 fmole estrogen receptor/mg protein or in bone metasteses. In order to improve the sensitivity, they have examined several structural analogues of moxestrol (the parent structure for MIVE/sub 2/) for affinity to the ER isolated from immature rat uterus. The 11Î²-ethyl analogue (EEE/sub 2/) of ethynyl estradiol (EE/sub 2/) exhibits the highest affinity with the 11Î²-methyl analogue second best. Although the lipophilicity is also very high this compound should not be much more lipophilic than 16-iodoestradiol or MIVE/sub 2/ since the introduction of iodine increases the log P by greater than 1.

A dramatic increase in the number of Culiseta melanura collected in 1989, as compared with the 3 previous years, was associated with virus isolations from this species (5/75 pools; n = 542 mosquitoes) and with seroconversion in sentinel quail (4/22 birds positive).

H.; Mursyidi, A.; Widyarini, S.; Rohman, A.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nDoxorubicin (Dox) is known as anticancer drug commonly used for cancer treatment. Eurycoma longifolia Jack or Pasakbumi was reported to have chemopreventive effect. In cancer patients, there are some dysfunctions of blood parameter, therefore some hematologic tests are needed to monitor cancer patients. In this study, the effects of combination of ethanolic extract of E. longifolia Jack (EEE) and Dox on hematologic profiles were investigated in rats injected by DMBA. Rats were divided into eight groups. Group I was normal group; Group II, rats were treated with extract dose 100 mg/kgbw; Groups III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII, rats were treated with Dox, DMBA, DMBA+Dox, DMBA+EEE, DMBA+Dox +EEE, and Dox+EEE, respectively. DMBA administration orally was conducted twice a week for 5 weeks. At 16th week of treatments, bloods were taken from orbitalis sinus for hematologicals profile (levels of Hb, erytrocyte, hematocrite, leukocyte, MCV, MCH, and differencial leucocyte count) measurements. These data were analyzed by one way ANOVA followed by LSD test. DMBA administration significantly decreased the hematological profiles compared to the normal group, except in lymphocyte level. Rats treated with extract and extract+Dox were able to increase the hematological profile compared to rats given by DMBA only. Based on these findings it can be concluded that the combination of EEE and Dox potentially increase hematological profile of rats given by DMBA.\n\nGraphical Calculation of Estimated Energy Expenditure in Burn Patients.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEgro, Francesco M; Manders, Ernest C; Manders, Ernest K\n\n2018-03-01\n\nHistorically, estimated energy expenditure (EEE) has been related to the percent of body surface area burned. Subsequent evaluations of these estimates have indicated that the earlier formulas may overestimate the amount of caloric support necessary for burn-injured patients. Ireton-Jones et al derived 2 equations for determining the EEE required to support burn patients, 1 for ventilator-dependent patients and 1 for spontaneously breathing patients. Evidence has proved their reliability, but they remain challenging to apply in a clinical setting given the difficult and cumbersome mathematics involved. This study aims to introduce a graphical calculation of EEE in burn patients that can be easily used in the clinical setting. The multivariant linear regression analysis from Ireton-Jones et al yielded equations that were rearranged into the form of a simple linear equation of the type y = mx + b. By choosing an energy expenditure and the age of the subject, the weight was calculated. The endpoints were then calculated, and a graph was mapped by means of Adobe FrameMaker. A graphical representation of Ireton-Jones et al's equations was obtained by plotting the weight (kg) on the y axis, the age (years) on the x axis, and a series of parallel lines representing the EEE in burn patients. The EEE has been displayed graphically on a grid to allow rapid determination of the EEE needed for a given patient of a designated weight and age. Two graphs were plotted: 1 for ventilator-dependent patients and 1 for spontaneously breathing patients. Correction factors for sex, the presence of additional trauma, and obesity are indicated on the graphical calculators. We propose a graphical tool to calculate caloric requirements in a fast, easy, and portable manner.\n\nCosmic rays Monte Carlo simulations for the Extreme Energy Events Project\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAbbrescia, M; Aiola, S; Antolini, R; Avanzini, C; Baldini Ferroli, R; Bencivenni, G; Bossini, E; Bressan, E; Chiavassa, A; CicalÃ², C; Cifarelli, L; Coccia, E; De Gruttola, D; De Pasquale, S; Di Giovanni, A; D'Incecco, M; Dreucci, M; Fabbri, F L; Frolov, V; Garbini, M; Gemme, G; Gnesi, I; Gustavino, C; Hatzifotiadou, D; La Rocca, P; Li, S; Librizzi, F; Maggiora, A; Massai, M; Miozzi, S; Panareo, M; Paoletti, R; Perasso, L; Pilo, F; Piragino, G; Regano, A; Riggi, F; Righini, G C; Sartorelli, G; Scapparone, E; Scribano, A; Selvi, M; Serci, S; Siddi, E; Spandre, G; Squarcia, S; Taiuti, M; Tosello, F; Votano, L; Williams, M C S; YÃ¡nez, G; Zichichi, A; Zuyeuski, R\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Extreme Energy Events Project (EEE Project) is an innovative experiment to study very high energy cosmic rays by means of the detection of the associated air shower muon component.

At present, 43 telescopes are installed and taking data, opening the way for the detection of far away coincidences over a total area of about 3 Ã 10 5 km 2 .

Brain tissue from 7 deer with EEE, as confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, was studied. Detailed microscopic examination, indirect immunohistochemistry (IHC), and in situ hybridization (ISH) were used to characterize the lesions and distribution of the EEE virus within the brain. The main lesion in all 7 deer was a polioencephalomyelitis with leptomeningitis, which was more prominent within the cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. In 3 deer, multifocal microhemorrhages surrounded smaller vessels with or without perivascular cuffing, although vasculitis was not observed. Neuronal necrosis, associated with perineuronal satellitosis and neutrophilic neuronophagia, was most prominent in the thalamus and the brainstem. Positive IHC labeling was mainly observed in the perikaryon, axons, and dendrites of necrotic and intact neurons and, to a much lesser degree, in glial cells, a few neutrophils in the thalamus and the brainstem, and occasionally the cerebral cortex of the 7 deer. There was minimal IHC-based labeling in the cerebellum and hippocampus. ISH labeling was exclusively observed in the cytoplasm of neurons, with a distribution similar to IHC-positive neurons. Neurons positive by IHC and ISH were most prominent in the thalamus and brainstem. The neuropathology of EEE in deer is compared with other species. Based on our findings, EEE has to be considered a differential diagnosis for neurologic disease and meningoencephalitis in white-tailed deer.\n\nOcular histopathology in Eastern equine encephalitis: A case report\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEleonora M.

The reaction between and showed first-order dependence in DTC and fractional order in MEE and EEE. The rate constant of the pseudo-first-order reaction decreased with an increase of [TeO4ââ2â], whereas adding [OHâ] enhanced the constant. In addition, the reaction had a negative salt effect. The rate of EEE was higher than that of MEE. A suitable assumption involving preequilibriums before the rate-controlling step and a free radical mechanism was proposed, based on the kinetic data. Activation parameters and the rate constant of the rate-determining step were calculated.\n\nA study of upward going particles with the Extreme Energy Events telescopes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAbbrescia, M.; Avanzini, C.; Baldini, L.; Ferroli, R.

[Profiles of University Professors in Spain for the European Higher Education Area (EHEA].\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRodrÃ­guez-GÃ³mez, Gregorio\n\n2009-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents the findings of a research study of professorsâ profiles for the European Higher Education Area (EHEA conducted in five spanish universities. Through the application of qualitative methods of inquiry, the perceptions of several groups of university professors over the principal teaching qualifications necessary for the coordination of higher education throughout the European Union have been obtained. Data analysis indicates a significant discrepancy between actual Spanish professors and those required by EHEA. It has also made possible the detailed description of teaching competency profiles that professors believe to be fundamental for the new functions demanded of them in the present changing social and educational situation. En este trabajo se presentan los resultados de una investigaciÃ³n llevada a cabo en cinco universidades espaÃ±olas sobre los perfiles docentes que demanda el EEES. Utilizando procedimientos de corte cualitativo se han obtenido en dos momentos consecutivos las percepciones de grupos de profesores sobre las principales competencias docentes necesarias para la armonizaciÃ³n de la educaciÃ³n superior en la UE. El anÃ¡lisis de los datos indica, por una parte, la discrepancia entre los tipos de profesores actualmente existentes y los percibidos como necesarios; por otra, ha posibilitado la descripciÃ³n pormenorizada de los perfiles de competencias docentes que el profesorado percibe como fundamentales para el ejercicio de las nuevas funciones que se le demandan en estos momentos.\n\nStocks, Flows, and Distribution of Critical Metals in Embedded Electronics in Passenger Vehicles.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRestrepo, Eliette; LÃ¸vik, Amund N; WÃ¤ger, Patrick; Widmer, Rolf; Lonka, Radek; MÃ¼ller, Daniel B\n\n2017-02-07\n\nOne of the major applications of critical metals (CMs) is in electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), which is increasingly embedded in other products, notably passenger vehicles. However, recycling strategies for future CM quantities in end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) are poorly understood, mainly due to a limited understating of the complexity of automotive embedded EEE. We introduce a harmonization of the network structure of automotive electronics that enables a comprehensive quantification of CMs in all embedded EEE in a vehicle. This network is combined with a material flow analysis along the vehicle lifecycle in Switzerland to quantify the stocks and flows of Ag, Au, Pd, Ru, Dy, La, Nd, and Co in automotive embedded EEE. In vehicles in use, we calculated 5 -2 +3 t precious metals in controllers embedded in all vehicle types and 220 -60 +90 t rare earth elements (REE); found mainly in five electric motors: alternator, starter, radiator-fan and electronic power steering motor embedded in conventional passenger vehicles and drive motor/generator embedded in hybrid and electric vehicles. Dismantling these devices before ELV shredding, as well as postshredder treatment of automobile shredder residue may increase the recovery of CMs from ELVs. Environmental and economic implications of such recycling strategies must be considered.\n\nHACIA EL EEES: CAMBIOS EN METODOLOGÃA Y EVALUACIÃN EN LA ASIGNATURA ALEMÃN COMO SEGUNDA LENGUA EN LA UNIVERSITAT DE VALÃNCIA (ESPAÃA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHerbert J.
