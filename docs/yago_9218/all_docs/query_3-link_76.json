        "text": "Mexican Film Performers--\"C\"\n\n(incorporates \"Ch\" using English alphabetization style)\n\nCabrera, Susana [Susana Cabrera Iglesias] (1924-1996): Rotund, acerbic comic actress. Born in Colombia (some sources say Mexico City)--where her actor parents were on tour at the time--Cabrera made her stage debut at the age of 3 (some sources say 11!). After a career as a dancer and comedienne in the variety theatre, she first appeared in films in 1956 (No me platiques más--with her cousin, \"Pompín\" Iglesias) and became a familiar figure--sarcastic and feisty--in the fichera (bargirl) genre of the 1970s. One of her best-known roles was in Autopsia de un fantasma (1966), in which she appeared with Basil Rathbone, John Carradine, and Cameron Mitchell. Due to a stroke, which paralyzed her facial muscles, Cabrera had been off-screen for some time prior to her death of cardiac arrest, in June 1996.\n\nCalvo, Armando (1919-1996) [Armando Pascual Calvo Gaspier] : Spanish actor (although reportedly born in Puerto Rico) who relocated to Mexico in 1946 and became a popular leading man opposite stars like María Félix, María Antonieta Pons, and Gloria Marín. Calvo, the son of well-known Spanish actor Juan Calvo, began working on the stage at the age of 5. His Spanish film debut came in 1934, and in late 1945 he was hired by Mexico producer Gregorio Walerstein to appear with María Félix in La mujer de todos (1946). During the 1960s, Calvo returned to work in the Spanish film industry, but came back to Mexico in the 1970s, where he was a TV and stage regular and made occasional film appearances. During the last few years of his life, Calvo was something of a recluse, living in straitened circumstances in a Mexico City hotel and spending his time writing and painting. He suffered from emphysema and kidney trouble, and died of heart failure in July 1996.\n\nCamacho, Alejandro: rather austere-looking telenovela leading man who has made a number of film appearances in the 1980s and 1990s. Married to actress Rebeca Jones, with whom he now produces telenovelas.\n\nCamacho, Cecilia: eternally youthful-looking actress nominated as Best Supporting Actress for La jaula de oro (1987); also won a special \"diploma\" for Presagio (1974). Can be seen recently doing TV commercials.\n\nCamacho, Marina (1934?--): brunette actress (real name: Margarita Camacho Estavilla) who made her film debut in 1955, appeared frequently in lower-case films in the latter half of the decade and the early '60s, but virtually vanished from the screen after 1962. The highstrung Camacho was notorious for her multiple suicide attempts (at least six times prior to 1961). She married actor Ramón Bugarini in 1961.\n\nCamarillo, Dolores \"Fraustita\" (1910-1988): extremely prolific character actress and makeup artist from the 1930s into the 1980s. Camarillo, who was married to actor Antonio R. Frausto, most often appeared in supporting roles as servants, but occasionally had more substantial parts. She played the girlfriend of Cantinflas in his first solo feature, Ahí está el detalle (1940).\n\nCampbell, Elizabeth: attractive U.S. actress who had a substantial career in Mexican films of the 1960s, including a recurring role as \"Golden Rubí\" in the \"Luchadoras\" (Wrestling Women) series. In the late '60s she reportedly left Mexico for NY to do TV work, but seems to have dropped out of sight.\n\nCampo, César del (1923--): Cuban performer who made his Mexican screen debut in small musical roles in late '40s films (he had previously appeared in Como tú ninguna, a 1946 film shot in Cuba with a multi-national cast). Del Campo began to receive dramatic parts in the 1950s, and worked steadily in supporting roles--mostly in action films--over the next two decades.\n\nCampos, Arsenio (1946--): boyish-looking actor who got his start in the late '60s, but still looks pretty young (except for his curly hair, which is now gray). Mostly a supporting actor, playing boyfriends, brothers, etc. Also on TV.\n\nCampos, Marco Antonio \"Viruta\" (1919-1996): Viruta, born in Tepito, a barrio of Mexico City, is chiefly remembered as half of one of Mexico's most popular comedy teams of the 1950s and 1960s, but he actually spent most of his career as a musician. His first professional work came in 1938, as a member of the quartet \"El Poker de la Harmonía\"; he was a member of the Trío Latino from 1940-42, and one of the Trío Romanceros from 1943 until 1949. In 1952, he formed a team with Gaspar Henaine \"Capulina,\" and found success on the Chiclets Adams radio show, then on television shows such as \"Cómicos y Canciones.\" The team first appeared on film in 1957 and broke up in 1967, apparently with considerable bad feelings. Viruta made a fair number of film appearances after the breakup, almost all in dramatic supporting roles. On television, he returned to his roots, working on shows like \"Advininanza Musical,\" and \"TV Musical Ossart.\" In 1976, he suffered his first heart attack, and retired from active performing. He was undergoing an operation to receive an artificial heart valve when he died.\n\nCañedo, Roberto [Robert Cañedo Ramírez--some sources list Martínez] (1918-1998): Distinguished-looking actor who rose from extra to leading man, then prolonged his career by switching to character roles. Cañedo, born in Guadalajara in 1918, made his film debut in 1938, but labored as an extra and bit player until the mid-1940s when he began to receive larger roles. He amassed literally hundreds of film and TV credits, despite health problems which disrupted his career several times (a heart attack in 1967, a broken knee in 1994). Cañedo won the Best Actor Ariel for Pueblerina (1948), and was also nominated for his work in Crimen y castigo (1950). He received the lifetime \"Ariel de Oro\" in 1997. He and his wife had six children, two of whom are actors. Cañedo died on 16 June 1998 of respiratory problems and heart failure.\n\nCano, Fanny (1944?-1983): Statuesque blonde actress of the 1960s and 1970s. Cano, born in the state of Michoacán, came to the attention of film producers while a college student in Mexico City. She began appearing in supporting roles in the 1962, and by the end of the decade was starring in telenovelas and film melodramas such as Flor de durazno (1969) and La amante perfecta (1969). In the 1970s Cano married businessman Sergio Luis Cano; she retired from the screen after 1978, devoting herself to her marriage and to her interests in Eastern religions, meditation, vegetarianism, and other spiritual pursuits. In December 1983, Cano was one of over 100 people who lost their lives when two airliners collided in the fog on the runway of Barajas airport in Madrid.\n\nCantinflas [Mario Moreno Reyes] (1911-1993): It is impossible to deal with the career of Cantinflas in such a brief space. Mario Moreno, born in Mexico City in 1911, briefly tried various careers (including the army and professional boxing) before entering the entertainment world, first as a dancer and then as a comedian, in the early '30s. He came to fame in the \"carpas,\" but really made his mark in the Follies Bergere theatre in 1935. For the rest of the decade, although he appeared in a number of feature films, Cantinflas was a far bigger stage star than film performer, but with Ahí está el detalle (1940), his movie career rapidly overshadowed all else. Cantinflas became an international sensation in Spanish-speaking nations (his two excursions in English were Around the World in 80 Days, a success, and Pepe, a failure), although his films after 1950 were increasingly critical failures. In his early years a labor activist--he served as president of ANDA (the actors' union), and first secretary general of the filmworkers' union STPC--Moreno turned to other interests in later life, investing his fortune in real estate, fighting bulls, and other ventures. Through it all, Cantinflas remained a favorite of the masses, and his films are still popular on video and television.\n\nCapetillo, Manuel (1926-2009): famous Mexican bullfighter, born in Jalisco, one of the \"Three Musketeers,\" a trio of young toreros who made their debuts in 1948. Beginning in 1955 with Las zapatillas verdes, Capetillo also worked as a film actor and occasional singer as well. After his retirement from the bullring, Capetillo concentrated on acting, and continued to take occasional movie roles into the 1990s. His sons Manuel Jr. and Guillermo are also bullfighters/actors; another son, Eduardo, is a popular TV actor and is married to actress Bibi Gaytán.\n\nCapetillo, Manuel hijo: the bullfighter/actor son of Manuel Capetillo Sr. has appeared in a number of action films since the late 1980s (such as Relámpago, 1987), and is also a popular TV performer.\n\nCapulina [Gaspar Henaine] (1924, '27 or 1930?-2011): Gaspar Henaine \"Capulina\" was born in the state of Puebla of Lebanese ancestry. Like his future partner Marco Antonio Campos \"Viruta,\" Capulina's early career was spent primarily as a musician in various groups that flourished in the variety theatre of the 1930s and 1940s. In the early '50s, Henaine and Campos were teamed up for a radio program sponsored by the Adams chewing gum company. Their combination of comedy and music became extremely popular, and in 1957 they made their screen debut in Se los chupó la bruja (Capulina had appeared in at least one film prior to this, while a member of the Trío Lation). Capulina and Viruta were successful in films, and on TV and the stage, but their partnership broke up in 1967. Capulina didn't break stride, appearing in a long string of screen comedies until the early 1980s (his last film to date is Mi compadre Capulina, 1989). He also worked steadily on television, and toured with his own circus, despite several life-threatening illnesses. His son Antonio made several films with his father, and also starred in a dramatic biography of singer Guty Cárdenas. Capulina returned to TV in 1998 with a dramatic role in a telenovela, \"Gotita de amor.\"\n\nCardán, Carlos: crafty-looking actor who began making films in 1966, with a leading role in Servando González's El escapulario but has generally essayed supporting (frequently villainous) parts since then. In some of his early pictures, he was billed as Carlos López Figueroa (probably his real name).\n\nCárdenas, Elsa (1938? or 1935?--): Petite brunette actress who began working in films in the 1950s. Because she speaks fluent English, Cárdenas has appeared in a significant number of Hollywood films, mostly those shot in Mexico (including 1963's Fun in Acapulco with Elvis Presley and Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, 1968), although she may also be seen with James Dean, Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor in Giant (1956). Cárdenas, who was married to Hollywood director Oscar \"Budd\" Boetticher in the 1960s, played first or second female leads in mostly routine pictures into the early 1970s, and continues to work--now in character roles--in television.\n\nCardinal, María: buxom actress, usually in decorative supporting roles, in the '70s and '80s, often in \"sexy-comedies.\"\n\nCardona, René [Sr.]: see DIRECTORS\n\nCardona, René Jr.: see DIRECTORS\n\nCardona, René III: see Coster, Al\n\nCarl-Hillos [Carlos Bravo y Fernández]: (1916-1997) (also billed sometimes as \"Carlillos\") A familiar face in bit parts (allegedly in over 400 films!) from the 1930s through the 1990s, Carlos Bravo y Fernández was actually a long-time film journalist who frequently played reporters, lawyers, clerks, etc. He occasionally had slightly larger roles.\n\nCarmina, Rosa [Rosa Carmina Riverón Jiménez] (1929?--): In 1946, director Juan Orol, recently divorced from María Antonieta Pons, traveled to Cuba to find another rumbera to star in his spy melodrama, Una mujer de Oriente. He met the exotically beautiful Rosa Carmina, who would star in most of his films for the next 9 years. Carmina continued to appear regularly in Mexican films for other directors into the early 1960s, making occasional pictures in later years, including a reunion with Orol in México de noche ('74).\n\nCaro, Alicia (1930--): Colombian actress whose period of greatest popularity came in the late '40s-early '50s; she had the female lead in Luis Buñuel's La hija del engaño (1951), for instance. Only sporadically on film in the 1960s; she retired from performing in the early '70s (her final appearance may have been in the Colombian-shot María, 1971). Married to actor Jorge Martínez de Hoyos (with whom she appeared in Cien gritos de terror in 1965) from the mid-1960s until his death in 1997.\n\nCaro, José Luis: (also occasionally billed as José Luis Carol): Spanish-born supporting actor, on-screen from the 1960s. Mostly played minor roles as doctors, lawyers, and so on, occasionally with a villainous tinge. Now more distinguished looking (the gray hair does it), although he sometimes appears in sexy-comedies as slightly-crazed doctors, cuckolded husbands, etc.\n\nCarr, Clifford (1903-1947): the stereotypical gringo of 1930s and 1940s Mexican cinema, the blonde, stocky, Carr (born in Connecticut) made his first appearance in El Rayo de Sinaloa (1935), but is perhaps best known for Los tres García and Vuelven los García (1946). His roles varied in size and importance, but Carr was generally a sympathetic--if comic--caricature of a gringo, speaking accented Spanish and smoking a big cigar. His last recorded screen appearance came in 1947.\n\nCarradine, John (1906-88): Hollywood actor in hundreds of films--from the biggest to the cheapest--from the 1930s through the 1990s. Brought to Mexico in '66 by Ismael Rodríguez for Autopsia de un fantasma; returned to shoot scenes for 4 Vergara productions in 1967, then came back again for Mary, Mary, Bloody Mary in 1974, and The Bees in 1978.\n\nCarrasco, Ada (1912-1993): character actress, usually in acidulous roles, onscreen since the mid-1950s. Nominated for an Ariel for one of her last films, Un año perdido (1993). Sister of Enriqueta Carrasco and mother of actress Malena Doria.\n\nCarrasco, Enriqueta \"Queta\" (1913-1996): character actress who followed her sister Ada into Mexican cinema, making her screen debut when she was already in her late forties (she had done television work in the 1950s, however). One of her first substantial roles was in Alejandro Galindo's La mente y el crimen (1961). After the death of Sara García, the long-time \"grandmother of Mexico,\" Queta Carrasco stepped into this slot, playing sweet (and sometimes not so sweet) grannies in over 100 films and in telenovelas and other TV shows, up until a few months before her death.\n\nCarreño, Meche (Mercedes) (1947 or 49?--): slim, dark dancer/actress who made her screen debut in 1964 and was soon promoted to leading roles in films such as Damiana y los hombres (1966) and No hay cruces en el mar (1967), where she invariably played innocent young women whose sexual attractiveness caused men (often older men) to go wild. In the early 1970s she began to receive more serious roles, winning the Best Supporting Actress Ariel for La choca (1973); she was also nominated for Los perros de Dios (1973). Carreño married director Juan Manuel Torres (she had previously been married to producer José Lorenzo Zakany Aldama), who directed her in La otra virginidad (1974), La vida cambia (1975), El mar (1976) and La mujer perfecta (1977). Torres died in an automobile accident in 1980 and Carreño made few screen appearances afterward (El día de las sirvientas, 1988, is her last to date), and moved to Paris for a number of years.\n\nCarril, Hugo del (1912-1989) [real name: Hugo Piero Fontana]: Argentine actor/singer (and later, director) who briefly emigrated to Mexico in 1945-46 (where he starred in El socio and two other pictures) but soon returned to his home country and became a powerful figure in the film industry during the Perón era.\n\nCarriles, Lupe (?--1964): scrawny character actress in many films from the the 1940s to the '60s, often playing servants, witches, etc.\n\nCarrión, Ricardo \"Guero\" (1938--): supporting actor from the '60s into the '90s. Carrión, despite being a blonde (hence his nickname), fairly handsome man, seems to have gravitated to villainous roles for some reason, although not exclusively. Ricardo Carrión was also one of the \"Hermanos Carrión,\" a 1960s singing group.\n\nCasado, Kippy (1939-2011): comic actress who made her name on TV in the late '50s and early '60s, and appeared in a fair number of films around this time. Only occasionally on screen since then, but still active on television. In 1997, she received the actors' union award for 50 years in show business.\n\nCasal, Gregorio [Jesús Casillas] (1935--) [occasionally billed as \"Casals\"]: slightly sinister-looking second lead, occasional leading man, and sometimes villain, who made his film debut in the late 1960s. In the early 1970s he played series hero \"Chanoc\" in several films (although he was second-billed to comedian Tin-Tan). He also directed several films in the 1980s. One of the Jalisco-born Casal's brothers is film director Jaime Casillas, for whom Casal worked in Chicano (1975), another is actor Mario Casillas, who can be seen with Gregorio in Las noches de paloma.\n\nCasanova, Delia (1948--): actress who began working in films in the mid-1970s. Between 1984 and 1995, Casanova was nominated four times for Arieles, winning the Best Actress prize in 1989 for Mentiras Piadosas (Merciful Lies). She has worked with some of the outstanding directors of the past two decades--Arturo Ripstein, Felipe Cazals, Gabriel Retes.\n\nCasanova, Fernando [Fernando Gutiérrez López] (1925-2012): husky leading man, chiefly in Westerns and rancheras. Casanova appeared as an extra as early as 1946, but began receiving leading roles in the early 1950s, notably in a series of pictures as \"El Aguila Negra\" (The Black Eagle), a Zorro/Lone Ranger clone. Continued to work into the 2000s, still in action films but now playing character roles.\n\nCastejón, Blanca de (1914-1969): Blonde actress (one source says she was born in New York City, another says Puerto Rico) who appeared in Argentine cinema as early as 1935, then moved to Hollywood where she had roles in several Spanish-language features, including Mis dos amores (My Two Loves, 1938), with Tito Guízar. Her first Mexican film was La razón de la culpa (The Reason for the Blame, 1942). In Mexico, she specialized in playing slightly dizzy, attractive but somewhat older women; for just such a role in Escuela de vagabundos (School for Bums, 1954), she won the Best Female Co-Star Ariel. At one time married to Rafael Banquells.\n\nCastelló, Florencio (1905 or' 10?-1986): balding, amiable Spanish comic actor who specialized in playing heavily-accented, stereotyped Spaniards in Mexican films, often as a bullfighter's sidekick. Active in Mexico from 1941 (Ni sangre ni arena--Neither Blood Nor Sand) through at least 1984 (El sinaloense). He was occasionally billed as \" Florencio Castellot.\"\n\nCastilla, Rosa de (1932--) [sometimes filed under \"R\" as \"Rosa de Castilla,\" i.e., Castilla is not her actual last name. Her real name is Victoria Ledesma]: attractive ranchera singer/actress whose primary period of screen activity was the 1950s-1960s. She was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Ariel for Tal para cual (Two of a Kind, 1952). Still active, she was in fact scheduled to appear in a film as recently as November 1997.\n\nCastillo, Braulio: Puerto Rican leading man in a few '60s and '70s films, including El cielo y tú (Heaven and You, 1970). His son Braulio Jr. is a popular telenovela actor of the '90s.\n\nCastillo, Eric del [Eduardo Castillo Negrete Galván] (1930, '34 or 35?--): after years playing slick villains (usually in Westerns), Eric del Castillo (he is occasionally billed as \"Erik\" and \"Erick\") eventually achieved a sort of elder-statesman status and was allowed to play leads in pictures like Las grandes aguas (The Great Waters, 1978) and Vagabunda (Vagabond, 1992). Del Castillo made his screen debut in the late 1950s, and was one of the busiest actors of the following decade, appearing in at least 70 films between 1960 and 1969! Beginning in the 1980s, he has also occasionally scripted and directed films, but continues to be a sought-after actor in films and telenovelas. His brother Federico del Castillo [aka Federico Falcón] had supporting roles in a fair number of 1960s and 1970s features, and his daughter Kate is a popular telenovela actress with a few film credits as well. Del Castillo was nominated for Ariel awards for Los marcados (The Marked Ones, 1970), Las grandes aguas and Perro callejero (Street Dog, 1979).\n\nCastro, Arturo \"Bigotón\" (1918-1975): beefy, moustachioed character actor (a carpa veteran), on-screen from the 1940s through the '60s, often as a police inspector or similar functionary. His nephews performed as the singing group Hermanos Castro, aka \"Los Panchitos\" (and Daniela Castro, daughter of one of these brothers, is currently a TV actress).\n\nCastro, Lupita and Castro, Mercedes: attractive brunette sisters who appeared together and singly in some '80s films like La cárcel de Laredo, La contrabandista, and Maldita miseria. Also singers. Mercedes was married at one time to singer Cornelio Reyna. Lupita, born in Culiacán, Sinaloa, made her professional debut in 1974 (Mercedes was a little earlier).\n\nCastro, Verónica (1952--): queen of Mexican soap operas (telenovelas) and TV talk shows, the diminutive Castro appeared in a fair number of films--such as El arte de engañar (The Art of Deception, 1970, in which she had a nude scene that proved to be a major selling point for the video release, nearly 20 years later) in the early 1970s (before she hit it big on TV) and has made sporadic appearances on the screen since. She remains extremely popular and has also had a very successful career as a singer. Mother of '90s pop singing star Cristian Castro (whose father is comedian Manuel \"Loco\" Valdés).\n\nCastro, Víctor Manuel \"Guero\": see DIRECTORS\n\n\"Catita\": see Marshall, Niní\n\nCavazos, Lumi: born in Monterrey, Cavazos is a young actress who gained international fame with her role (for which she received an Ariel nomination) in Como agua para chocolate [Like Water for Chocolate, 1991]. She began acting on the stage at the age of 15; Cavazos has made a few other films and also appears on television.\n\nCervantes, Martha Elena: actress who made numerous appearances as the second lead (and a few female leads) in lower-rank pictures, from the mid-'50s through the 1960s. She is still active in films, in supporting roles. Married to director Vicente Oroná Jr., who died in 1961(?).\n\n\"Chabelo\": see López, Javier.\n\nChabot, Amedée: former Miss California (1964) who appeared in a few Hollywood films (such as Three on a Couch with Jerry Lewis) before relocating to Mexico and making 24 films in just three years (1966-68). She then dropped out of sight, making an aborted comeback attempt in 1971-72. Although her dialogue was almost always dubbed into Spanish, the beautiful Chabot was one of the most popular screen actresses of this period, usually playing a stereotyped \"sexy American blonde.\" Her picture include Narda o el verano (Narda or the Summertime, 1968) and Agente 00 Sexy (1967). Amedee Chabot is now a real-estate agent in California.\n\n\"Chachita\": see Muñoz, Evita\n\n\"Chaflán\" : see López, Carlos\n\nChagoyán, Rosa Gloria: after years of roles in generally forgettable films, the statuesque Chagoyán hit the big time with Lola la trailera [Lola the Truckdriver, 1983] and its sequels, action films about evil narcotics smugglers persecuting a beautiful woman trucker. She followed these pictures with bigger budget efforts such as La rielera (The Lady Railroader, 1987) and Juana la cubana (Juana the Cuban, 1992). Most of her later films co-star her husband, Rolando Fernández.\n\nChaín, Angélica: extremely beautiful blonde actress of the 1970s and early 1980s. Frequently cast in \"sexy comedies\" but she also made a number of serious films, including the Western Matar por matar (Kill For Killing's Sake, 1978) and Cuando tejen las arañas (When the Spiders Spin, 1977), a contemporary drama in which she plays a lesbian. Rumor has it that she married a rich businessman which explains her retirement from the screen.\n\nChávez, Marcelo (1911-1970): rotund, balding straight man to Germán Valdés \"Tin Tan\" from the 1940s throught the 1960s (he actually made his screen debut in 1942, before teaming with Tin Tan and appearing in Hotel de verano--Summer Hotel, 1943).

Later became involved with in an actors' union dispute and has apparently been banned from acting in Mexico, although he is able to appear as a singer/songwriter, at which he is apparently quite successful, having released more than 80 records. One of his most recent films is the U.S.-made Rompe el alba (Break of Dawn, 1988), a biography of a Chicano radio personality.\n\nChávez, Roxana: rather slim, fey blonde actress and occasional singer who appeared in a fair number of films of the '80s and '90s, and on TV.

The son of a theatrical impresario, Chávez Trowe began working professionally at the age of 5. He was one of the founding members of ANDA, the actors' union, and continued to be interested in labor issues. Chávez Trowe's round face, moustache, burly physique and outspoken manner were suitable for both dramas and comedies; he was often cast as dim-witted villainous henchmen, honest campesinos, and even played Mexican Revolution hero Pancho Villa.\n\n\"Chelelo\": see García, Eleazar\n\n\"El Chicote\": see Soto la Marina, Armando\n\n\"Chóforo\": see Padilla, Raúl\n\nCiangherotti, Alejandro (1903-1975) [last name sometimes spelled \"Chiangherotti\"]: Argentine character actor, active in Mexico in the 1940s and 1950s, often in unsympathetic roles. Nominated for a Supporting Actor Ariel for his work in Canaima (1945). He married actress Mercedes Soler (sister of the 4 famous Soler brothers); their sons Alejandro Jr. (1940-2004) and Fernando (Luján) worked steadily as actors from childhood onwards, and another generation of Chiangherottis (TV actor and singer Fernando Ciangherotti, son of Fernando Luján) is currently active as well.\n\nCiangherotti, Alejandro Jr. (1940-2004): son of actor Alejandro Ciangherotti (the spelling of their last name varied from film to film) and brother of actor Fernando Luján.

Still active on TV.\n\nCibrián, José (1916-2002): sensitive-looking Spanish stage actor who broke into Mexican films in the title role of Jesús de Nazareth (Jesus of Nazareth, 1942). For the next four years Cibrián was one of the more popular leading men of the period, both in dramas and comedies, but he made his last Mexican film in 1946.

Born in Puebla, as a teenager Espino decided he wanted to be an actor. He began appearing on the stage in Mexico City in the mid-1930s, using nicknames like \"El Chumiate,\" \"Clavos,\" and \"Clavillo,\" before finally settling on \"Clavillazo.\" By the 1940s, he was a popular stage comedian who even owned his own \"carpa\" theatre; his film career began in earnest in the early '50s. During the latter half of the decade, Clavillazo starred in a significant number of films, and was also the host of a hit TV show. In most of his pictures he wore his stage costume--a baggy coat and an odd, pointed cap--and was known for his exaggerated hand gestures and a number of catch phrases, including \"No más,\" and \"la cosa está calmada.\" His film career declined precipitously in the '60s; in the '80s he made several appearances in semi-dramatic roles in films like En las garras de la ciudad. He suffered a stroke in 1987, and in 1993 had a series of heart attacks, which culminated with his death in November of that year.

The comedian died of a heart attack while standing outside the ANDA (actors' union) building.\n\nConesa, María (1892-1978): Spanish-born stage performer, nicknamed \"La Gatita Blanca\" after one of her biggest song hits, who worked in the Mexican musical theatre from the turn of the century well into the 1930s. She made her film debut in the silent era, but did not appear in a sound film until 1938's Refugiados en Madrid (Refugees in Madrid). Conesa made a few other pictures over the next decade and appeared on television well into the 1950s.

De Córdova grew up and was educated in various locations, including New York, Cuba, and Argentina. As a young man he returned to Mérida and began to work as a radio announcer and emcee. His radio work eventually led to film roles, beginning with Celos (Jealousy, 1935). The handsome young actor soon became one of the most popular stars in Mexican cinema, and during the 1940s worked in Hollywood as well, appearing in For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), Frenchman's Creek (1944), and A Medal for Benny (1945), among other titles. He later worked in Argentine, Brazilian, and Spanish films as well.

However, the general downward trend in the industry and de Córdova's advancing age led to a series of lesser roles in the 1960s, and in the late 1960s he suffered a stroke which left his left arm and leg partially paralyzed. However, he gradually recovered and in 1970 appeared with his close friend and co-star Marga López in the Cantinflas vehicle, El Profe (The Professor). This guest star spot would prove to be the last film role for the great star, who died in 1973. His son, Alonso de Córdova, made a few film appearances in the early 1960s.\n\nCórdova, Pancho (1916-1990): Chiapas-born character actor and screenwriter, best known for his comic roles but also capable of doing dramatic work when required.
