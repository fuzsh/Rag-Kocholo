        "text": "‘You have a vastly superior mind, but you have lost track of eternity.’\n\nA scientist is targeted by a vampire, who is a descendant of Nostradamus. The bloodsucker demands that he publicly acknowledge the seer’s legendary powers, or he will kill 13 times…\n\nThe first part of what was originally a 12-part Mexican serial cut into four films and dubbed into English for American theatres by producer K Gordon Murray. Federico Curiel directs a cast led by Germán Robles, Julio Alemán and Domingo Soler.\n\nIt’s been a pleasant evening of fine wine and good conversation for Profesor Durán (Soler). His guests are all congratulating him on his public stand against the power of superstition and ancient beliefs. Unfortunately, after the guests depart, he has one more visitor. Preparing some work in his study with his secretary Antonio (Alemán), they come face to face with a stranger called Ericson (Robles). The uninvited guest demands that Soler formally endorse the prophecies of Nostradamus. Soler scoffs at the very idea, but Robles is persistent, warning him that his continual refusal will mean the deaths of 13 people. He names the first as a man who has written to Soler supporting his views. Soler and Alemán don’t take the threats seriously.\n\nThe next day, however, they discover that the named man is dead. Soler receives another nocturnal visit from Robles, who names his next victim. Soler shoots at Robles, but the man transforms into a giant bat and flies away. Reluctantly conceding that he’s dealing with a vampire, Soler and Alemán rush to warn the second victim, a dealer in antiques. But they are too late; Robles has already put the man into a hypnotic trance, commanding him to kill one of his clients. The crime committed, the hypnotised man flings himself from a high window and dies down below in the street. Soler persuades Alemán to keep what they know from the police, a strategy that backfires when Robles tells his hunchback assistant, Leo (Manuel Vergara ‘Manver’), to kidnap the Professor’s pretty daughter, Anna (Aurora Alvarado).\n\nA question hangs over the exact genesis of this production. That it was a serial of a dozen episodes running 25 minutes each is not disputed. However, there is disagreement about whether it was intended for television or theatrical release. The latter seems likely due to the production values on display, the most obvious example being the interior of the Professor’s house, where a lot of the action takes place. It was probably a set, given some of the camera movements; a prime example is when Curiel tracks characters from a distance when they climb the central stairway, a manoeuvre likely to prevent problems in an actual location. The confusion may have arisen due to the circumstances facing Estudios América, who produced the film. At the time, they were barred from making features due to a union agreement, so this may have been initially announced as a television shoot as a clever way of circumventing this problem.\n\nIn some form, the project reached Mexican theatres in the autumn of 1961, when it caught the attention of American entrepreneur and film distributor K Gordon Murray. By this point, he was regularly importing films from South of the Border for American release on the small-town theatrical circuit. Curiel’s serial ran around 3 hours in total and would cut pretty neatly into four separate features, each running around 75 minutes. Of course, there would be a few problems establishing the story basics at the beginning of each separate instalment. However, due to the nature of serials, characters often spend time recapping the main plot anyway. Clearly, it didn’t concern Murray too much, and he was happy to slap on a perfunctory English language dub track and throw the results out onto the circuit.\n\nAs the saga’s opening episode, this entry has the advantage of including the initial setup. Curiel shows us Robles in the family crypt, talking with the corpse of his long-dead ancestor and establishing the plot. Apparently, after 400 years in the grave, the original Nostradamus (Victorio Blanco) is still a bit peeved at those snooty academic types like Soler, who won’t take his work seriously. It is unclear how he’s heard about the Professor and his unseen ‘committee’ and what they’ve precisely done to get on his nerves. At this point, Robles seems to be a distant descendant but is later referred to as his son. Rather than be known as Ericson, he soon takes on the name of Nostradamus. None of this is adequately explained, but the lazy English dub might be responsible.\n\nAs a dramatic project, it holds few surprises. Mexican filmmakers had been in thrall to the standard Lugosi template since the phenomenal success of Abel Salazar’s ‘El vampiro’ (1957), the film which kickstarted the entire Mexican horror craze of the period. Vampires were aristocratic and arrogant, with hypnotic eyes and impeccably tailored, dressing formally with a swirling cape. Robles’ Nostradamus is no exception, and that’s no surprise given that the Spanish actor had also played the bloodsucker in Salazar’s earlier film. To his credit, the actor seems fully engaged with this material, although he could have been forgiven for being a little less than enthusiastic. He had already reprised his undead role in the sequel to Salazar’s film and had delivered another vampire count in ‘El castillo de los monstruos (The Castle of the Monsters)’ (1958), even if that was more of a gag appearance.\n\nThe main issue here with Curiel’s film is a lack of action. Unlike a Hollywood serial crammed full of fistfights and cliffhangers, this is a slow, talky piece that’s more in keeping with Stoker’s original. Soler is our Van Helsing, of course, and daughter Alvarado steps into Mina Harker’s shoes. Robles does get a hunchback assistant, which is new, but there’s little else that deviates from the familiar formula. The connection with the original Nostradamus is just window dressing, and public recognition of his ancestor’s genius seems to be a weak motivation to initiate Robles’ killing spree. Soler’s behaviour is also a little strange. Why not acknowledge Nostradamus, as Robles asks? What’s to lose? It will stop the murders, after all. The Professor is also determined to keep everything from the police and fight Robles with only Alemán for support. If he goes to the authorities with what he knows, it will cause a mass panic, and that’s a lot worse than allowing more murders. Apparently. These seeming illogicalities may result from the words put into the actor’s mouths by the English dub, which offers dialogue that often sounds awkward and borderline ridiculous.\n\nThe conversion from a serial to a feature is not blindingly obvious, but it often feels that Robles should be paying rent, given the number of times he pops into Soler’s house for a little chat. His presence and the basic setup needed to be established in each original serial episode, so invariably there is some repetition of this kind. The film’s climax also seems rushed, and events end abruptly. Of course, this was originally the finish of episode 3 of the serial, so there is a lot more story to come, but an audience of the time would probably have felt short-changed. All in all, though, it’s not as awkward as it might be, and the film functions better as a stand-alone feature than ‘the sequel’ ‘Nostradamus y el destructor de monstruos/The Monsters Demolisher’ (1962), which covered episodes 4 to 6.\n\nIf the presence of Nostradamus seems a little incongruous when wedded to a vampire tale, the filmmakers may have been playing ‘name recognition’ with the Mexican film ‘Nostradamus’ (1937). Unfortunately, there is next to no information available about that film. However, it did star Carlos Villarías, who appeared as the most famous vampire of them all in ‘Drácula’ (1931), the Spanish version of Stoker’s tale shot by Universal concurrently with the Lugosi film. Curiel’s film doesn’t approach the artistry of either, but there is some effective lighting and black-and-white cinematography by Fernando Colín. The transformation from vampire to bat is usually achieved with a ‘jump cut’, but there is one where Curiel gets creative with a reverse zoom. It’s not a triumph by any means, but it’s pretty effective in its way.\n\nMurray was born in Illinois in 1925, the son of an undertaker. His first brush with the entertainment world was as a huckster with West’s World Wonder Shows Carnival. Helping with the casting of the Munchkins for MGM’s ‘The Wizard of Oz’ (1939) gave him his start in Hollywood, and he eventually worked his way up to the role of publicist for Cecil B DeMille’s ‘The Greatest Show On Earth’ (1952). Moving to Miami, he started K Gordon Murray Productions and began dubbing, retitling and distributing foreign films, hitting pay dirt with Rene Cardona’s bizarre seasonal favourite ‘Santa Claus’ (1959). Never one to ignore an opportunity, Murray flooded the market with so many dubbed children’s fairy tale films that he was known as the ‘King of the Kiddie Matinee’ by the end of the decade.\n\nAt the same time, he also focused on Mexican horror, bringing many now-familiar figures into American theatres, most famously Luchador Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask. He was also behind the English language appearances of such ‘South of the Border’ gems as ‘El vampiro’ (1957), ‘The Brainiac/El barón del terror’ (1962) and ‘The Wrestling Women Vs the Aztec Mummy/Las luchadoras contra la momia’ (1963). It’s estimated that Murray released over 60 films with various levels of creative input during his career. In later life, unpaid tax bills got him into trouble with the IRS and all his films were seized. He was due to begin court action to reclaim them when he died of a heart attack in the final days of 1979.\n\nFormulaic vampire action from Mexico. One for fans only.\n\n‘There are many things in life that appear absurd but aren’t.’\n\nA vampire rises from the tomb to threaten a family descended from his great love. He also intends to wreak revenge on the last of the line of the knight who plunged a steak into her heart…\n\nIt’s another fight with the forces of darkness for Mexican legend Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask. This was the final one of the quartet of films he made for producer Luis Enrique Vergara and was once again directed by José Díaz Morales and co-written by Fernando Osés, who also stars in the title role of the undead nobleman.\n\nBarón Brakola (Osés) has been sleeping the sleep of the dead for over one hundred years. When he wakes, he thinks only of vengeance, targeting the descendant of old enemy, the Knight in the Silver Mask, who staked his true love and thus condemned him to his long sleep. Later that night, masked wrestler Santo is cleaning up in his dressing room after a night in the square ring when he hears a commotion in the empty arena. There, he finds caretaker Don Luis (Manuel Arvide) being attacked by Osés. He jumps into the fray, but the vampire is only repelled by Arvide flourishing a crucifix.\n\nThe janitor then confesses all to Santo. He was only working at the arena to be close to the wrestler, knowing that Osés would return at some point to seek vengeance. Santo is descended from the Knight in the Silver Mask, and Arvide from the family of the vampire’s lost love, Rebeca (Susana Robles). He fears for the life of his own daughter, Silvia (Mercedes Carreño), so much so that he has lived apart from her for many years. Santo agrees to help and end the bloodsucker’s reign of terror forever.\n\nMany of the most familiar story elements that repeatedly occur in Santo’s Cinematic Universe were established in ‘Santo and the Vampire Women/Santo vs. las mujeres vampiro’ (1962). So, it’s no surprise to find most of them here in another tale of the legendary Mexican wrestler taking on bloodsuckers. However, it’s only three years later, and it’s disappointing to find a film leaning so hard into those tropes. Themes and story ideas were mercilessly recycled without shame in Mexican Horror films of the time, but this really does go above and beyond. The final results suggest that almost no effort was put into the script, co-written with Osés by usual suspects, Rafael García Travesi and director Morales.\n\nAccusations of a descent into formula could already be levelled at the series by this point, with the other three films produced by Vergara hardly breaking new ground. However, those still possessed some eccentric and enjoyable flourishes, with ‘Profanadores de tumbas/Santo contra los profanadores de tumbas/Grave Robbers (1965) being particularly extravagant. Here, the audience gets nothing but a tired retread of a certain book by some chap called Stoker, focusing on the section where the Count pays nightly visits to Lucy’s bedroom. After all, Brakola… what could that possibly rhyme with?\n\nThe most significant flaw, however, is the lengthy flashback sequence, which takes up almost half an hour of the short running time. For a start, it removes our hero from the action, his ancestor looking suspiciously less bulky behind his silver eye mask. A similar storytelling device was also employed in the second of the Vergara films ‘Diabolical Hatchet/Santo vs. the Diabolical Hatchet/El hacha diabólica (1965). However, here it results in the presentation of what is effectively the same story twice over, as the events in modern times replicate far too closely what happened in the sequences set in the past.\n\nThere’s also some confusion regarding Brakola’s bloodsucking credentials. When first presented in the flashback, he’s already dressed like a vampire with the high-collared cloak he wears throughout the film. He visits a tavern where he hires some thugs to attack the Knight in the Silver Mask and uses his purse to sweet-talk a serving girl into returning to his lair. There, he uses his hypnotic powers to seduce and bite her. All well and good. However, subsequent events confirm that he’s not a vampire yet. While attempting to kill the Knight in the Silver Mask, he catches a fatal sword thrust, vanishes into thin air, staggers back to his coffin and dies. Only then does he become a vampire (apparently, he has a pact with the devil or something, which explains it…?) It says something about the amount of effort put in by the filmmakers that they can’t even keep such a simple story straight.\n\nOf course, some aspects still give the film entertainment value. Rather than bother with crosses, holy water or battles of wills, Santo and Osés just duke it out, with the villain even assuming the place of Santo’s opponent in a World Championship match. No one disputes his identity when he enters the ring because, apparently, any old foreigner can just turn up and get a crack at the title! Two men in the crowd confirm that no one knows the challenger or has seen his photograph, which clears up any accusations of silliness that ill-informed viewers might have made. By this point in the series, you might have thought someone would have reviewed arena security, as getting a match with Santo seems to be an almost guaranteed one-way ticket to the boneyard. At best, challengers get possessed; at worst, killed. That visitor’s dressing room is officially the most dangerous place on the planet.\n\nThe four films made under the deal Santo signed with producer Vergara were a mixed bag of entries in the series, but this undoubtedly rates as the most disappointing. Budgetary issues showed in all of them, especially with the repeated use of locations and props, but, watched in isolation, that becomes less of an issue. What hurts this film is the absence of ideas and cleaving too close to some established in earlier films. It’s an accusation that can be levelled at many of the series, of course, but most of the other entries threw in a few wrinkles to try and keep things fresh. The only moment of creativity here features Robles’ portrait. When she turns into a bloodsucker, her face becomes lined and haggard; when she’s staked, it returns to youthful beauty. It’s only a tiny touch, but the film could have used more moments like that.\n\nCarreño is mainly confined to her bed as an item on the menu for Osés, but she does bring some youthful energy and personality to her early scenes in the film. It was her first credited role and led to working with director Julio Bracho on romantic dramas, where she starred and shared co-writing credits. Later project ‘La sangre enemiga’ (1971) became a huge domestic hit, but she became known more for nude scenes than her acting abilities. However, recognition came when she won the Premios ACE for Best Actress for Francisco del Villar’s serious drama ‘Los perros de Dios’ (1974), which also saw her nominated for a Silver Ariel, Mexico’s equivalent of the Academy Award. A year later, she went one better, winning the Silver Ariel as Best Supporting Actress for ‘La choca’ (1974). She continued acting until the late 1980s, but her credits became increasingly sporadic, her last leading role being ‘El noa noa’ (1981). She passed away in 2022.\n\nA weary addition to the series, which needed new blood.\n\nSanto will return in ‘Blue Demon vs. The Satanic Power/Blue Demon vs. El Poder Satanico’ (1966).\n\n‘Affection is important, but beans are always needed.’\n\nSightings of flying saucers have sent the Mexican public into a frenzy. When a young couple dressed as aliens for a fiesta are rescued from the wreckage of a bizarre car accident, they are mistaken for the real thing…\n\nLight-hearted Mexican musical comedy with a science-fiction twist from co-writer and director Julián Soler. Adalberto Martínez and Evangelina Elizondo play the wannabe extraterrestrials with support from Andrés Soler and José Venegas.\n\nYoung couple Marciano and Saturnina (Martínez and Elizondo) are deeply in love, but there’s little prospect of a happy future together. Money is tight, and his work as a plumber and general fix-it man in their poor neighbourhood seems like a dead end. His lack of financial clout and prospects makes him a non-starter in the marriage stakes for Elizondo’s grasping father (Carlos Riquelme), and he forbids them from carrying on their relationship. He’d much prefer his daughter to hook up with local blowhard Venustiano (José Venegas), who has the means to help him clear his debts. Martínez and Elizondo dress as aliens for a local fiesta, but a fight breaks out with the bullying Venegas. The couple flee in an experimental car with a jet engine that Martínez has built in his garage.\n\nOnce they leave the city, Martínez puts his new ride to the test, but it takes flight, eventually crashing to the ground near an isolated village. When locals retrieve the unconscious couple from the wreckage, they believe them to be actual aliens and contact eminent scientist Prof. Saldaña (Soler) in the city. The news of the discovery of dead extraterrestrials also leaks to the press and becomes a global sensation. The situation takes on a new dimension when Soler finds out that the couple are still very much alive. As an honest man, Martínez initially wants to come clean about the entire mistake. However, the more practical Elizondo convinces him that this happy accident is their big chance to leave poverty behind and ensure a future together.\n\nGenerally speaking, the American science fiction bonanza of the 1950s had little effect on Mexican cinema. Tales of giant bugs, dangerous space missions and alien invasions seem to have had little box office appeal for the Mexican public. Of course, mounting such adventures can take considerable resources, but the American screen was deluged with dozens of low-budget examples, so it seems strange there were almost no equivalent movies south of the border. Instead, the national imagination was seized by the Gothic horrors of ‘El Vampiro’ (1957) and the many subsequent films betraying the influence of the Universal Monsters. Science fiction was limited to mad scientists and their creations, with the occasional extraterrestrial visitor such as ‘The Brainiac/El barón del terror’ (1962), and he wasn’t even an alien. Perhaps it’s indicative that the evil alien queen in the gloriously deranged classic ‘The Ship of Monsters/La nave de los monstruos’ (1960) is also a vampire. Of course, offworlders did become semi-regular opponents for masked wrestlers after ‘Santo vs. The Martian Invasion/Santo el Enmascarado de Plata vs’ La invasión de los marcianos” (1966), but it still seems that science-fiction never really caught on in Mexican cinema.\n\nAll that makes Soler’s film a somewhat unusual enterprise and informs what the audience gets in the finished article. The science fiction element is central to the plot, but it’s essentially a hook on which to hang some good-natured hi-jinks and fun. There are a few opportunities for social satire, mainly when Martínez and Elizondo give their ‘message to the world’ via a global radio hook-up. Soler sprinkles such gags and observations throughout, but he’s far more interested in getting to the next musical number. These include the odd presence of a ballet featuring Cuban-Mexican dancer Amalia Aguilar. It makes little sense in story terms as Aguilar does not appear in the film elsewhere. However, she was a big international star, so her presence obviously helped with box office receipts. The sequence itself is supposed to be a visual representation of life on Mars, and it’s interesting to note that the minimalist set and the costumes do bear a passing resemblance to Soviet science fiction landmark ‘Aelita/Aelita, the Queen of Mars/Аэлита’ (1924), albeit on a far smaller scale.\n\nThe film’s primary concern, however, is the comedy. What is pleasing to note is that, although the situations are never subtle or very inventive, Soler avoids laying on the laughs with a trowel. He often allows the appeal of his stars to carry the humour. In this respect, Martínez may be slightly reminiscent of a young Jerry Lewis, but Elizondo provides the necessary balance so that his exaggerated antics never spiral entirely out of control. Their relationship also gives the film a heart, which is not usually prioritised in such a venture but appears in just the right quantity here. The presence of Famie Kaufman as the professor’s amorous daughter is another win, with the actor delivering a wonderfully eccentric turn which manages to be both incredibly silly but strangely endearing at the same time. She’s also an enthusiastic participant with Martínez and Elizondo in a semi-ridiculous musical number that provides one of the film’s highlights, particularly when the actors don’t just break the fourth wall but actually wink into the camera at the audience!\n\nOf course, given the plot, it’s not unreasonable to question whether the film has any real science fiction credentials. However, it could be argued that the silly and inevitable coda earns the label. Certainly, our main protagonists are terrestrial, even if they have strangely appropriate character names. Martínez identifies as Martian and introduces Elizondo as from Saturn, and the script has them as Marciano and Saturnina (probably not that common a girl’s name in Mexico!) Local bully boy Venustiano also seems to be named after a planet! It’s a good indication of what to expect here; nothing wildly inventive or off the wall, just an amiable 90 minutes spent with friendly faces eager to please.\n\nMartínez was a well-known dancer and comedian, usually billed as ‘Resortes’, a word that translates to ‘Spring’, referencing his unusual gait and dancing style. It was a nickname he initially hated but later embraced. Growing up in poverty, he sold wooden pallets outside the Hidalgo Theater as a teenager and became sucked into the world of show business, initially working in a circus. His big break in film came as the star of the mystery-comedy ‘Confidencias de un ruletero’ (1949). Further success followed over the next two decades in both movies and television. ‘The Girl of the Blue Backpack/La niña de la mochila azul’ (1979) and its sequel made him a star all over again when they became the biggest teen hits in Mexican film history. Some even allege that he invented the ‘Moonwalk’ for a film called ‘Escuela de verano/Summer School’ (1959). However, reliable sources do not include the project in his list of credits, so this remains unverified at best.\n\nGenial comedic outing that’s a harmless way to wile away your time.\n\n‘Then I thought you would let me have his thyroid.’\n\nA mad scientist and his gang carry out a series of grave robberies to get raw material for his experiments in raising the dead. However, after several failures, he decides to experiment on people with exceptional strength and power…\n\nMexico’s legendary crime-fighting luchador is back as Santo again tackles the forces of evil for co-writer-director José Díaz Morales. This was the third of the films the wrestler made in his four-picture deal with producer Luis Enrique Vergara and, as per usual, Rafael Garcia Travesi was also behind the typewriter with the director.\n\nBrilliant but misunderstood, scientist Doctor Toicher (Mario Orea) has set up shop in Mexico to continue his vital experiments in resuscitating the recently departed. It’s valuable work, to be sure, but the stuffy establishment refuses to acknowledge his genius, forcing him to consort with lowlife criminal types and raid cemeteries for his test subjects.\n\nUnfortunately, his equipment tends to explode when his experiments fail, and he realises that only exceptional corpses will serve his needs. Silver-masked wrestler Santo becomes his primary target, although he’s also interested in professional footballer Carlos Resendiz (Jorge Peral) and his girlfriend Marta (Gina Romand), a nightclub singer. He plots to kill and acquire their bodies using the strange devices invented by his chief assistant Hunchback (Jesús Camacho), using parts of dead bodies.\n\nOn the surface, this was already a standard set-up for a feature film set in the somewhat off-kilter cinematic world of Mexican wrestling. Mad scientist? Check. Lots of fights and wrestling? Check. Strange experiments? Check. Santo in the crosshairs? Check. It’s a basic template present in ‘Santo contra los zombies/Santo contra los zombies’ (1962) and wasn’t original then, being adapted from earlier wrestling adventures that were nodding back in their turn to Hollywood movie serials of the 1930s and 1940s. It’s the bizarre elements that Morales and Travesi throw into the script that make it stand out from the crowd.\n\nAfter the usual introductions, we see Santo at home, receiving a present from his friend Peral. It’s a lamp with a shade depicting the anatomy of the human heart. Plugging it in causes the big man to writhe around on the floor while the cameraman suffers a frenzied attack of the zoom button, and the soundtrack starts to scream like an emergency warning system. Santo manages to withstand the psychedelia of it all, but the lamp’s heart fails, bleeding all over the shade as it expires. Santo consults with Peral and finds that he knows nothing of the gift. Right away, Santo figures out that the incident is linked to the recent grave robbing in the city. There’s no apparent link between the two, but he is Santo, the great detective, and, after all, he is right, isn’t he?\n\nThis is just the beginning of the odd delights on offer in the film, which are mainly centred on the rather peculiar activities of our main villains. Orea looks like he’s having the time of his life as the ranting, maniacal Toicher, who lays about his minions with a whip while cursing their continued inability to deal with Santo. Camacho is also great as his cringing assistant, who is more interested in healing his own twisted body with thyroid glands than in the doctor’s obscure schemes and cheerfully vague long-term goals.\n\nWhat seals the deal, though, are Camacho’s inventions, which are apparently made with leftover pieces of the dead. Apart from the lamp (which has an encore appearance later on), there’s paint made from human blood, a deadly violin, and a wig with a mind of its own. Somewhat bizarrely, these are all on sale at a store run by gang member Nathanael León (billed as Nothanael Frankenstein!).\n\nNow, I realise that Orea’s researches are probably costly, even with getting his raw materials for free from the local boneyard. After all, his equipment blows up every time one of his experiments fails, and electrical do-dads that throw out sparks and make loud buzzing noises aren’t exactly ten a penny. So, it’s reasonable that he’d have a side hustle to help pay the bills. Still, I question the business model of selling products designed to kill the people who buy them. You’re not going to get much repeat custom, are you? Think of all the returns and refunds too! And exactly what kind of store sells paint, violins and wigs, and can order you face cream and ladies’ underwear?!\n\nAll this wonderful tomfoolery leads to some of the film’s greatest moments. As well as Santo wrestling on the floor with a household appliance, we get fiddler Jorge Fegán fighting off a homicidal violin string. At the same time, his instrument dances around the floor on its own before exploding. Best of all, Romand performs her nightclub act in the deadly black wig, but halfway through the number, it tries to strangle her! Fortunately, the audience is full of our heroes and villains, most of them in disguise, so there’s a massive punch-up while she fights for her life. Eventually, she manages to tear off the wig, which then hops around on the floor by itself while the fight rages on!\n\nOrea dresses like the Phantom of the Opera but doesn’t bother with the mask despite being facially scarred. He loses his hat in the cemetery after his minions fight with Santo, which proves to be an issue as he has his name written in it! Maybe it was put there by his mum. Other delights include a corpse buried in her high heels, Santo disguised as a street vendor selling chestnuts (in the middle of the night) and two henchmen (one played by the ever-present Fernando Osés) who let him escape from a walk-in freezer because they are too busy laughing hysterically at a small fire (don’t even ask, I have no idea!)\n\nThere’s also a crucial sequence where Camacho tries to stab Santo with a poisoned needle during a bout in the ring. Orea assures his assistant that no one will notice this attempted murder in the excitement of the moment (and no one does!), only he stabs the wrong wrestler, who goes mad and drops dead. I’m surprised anyone ever agrees to fight Santo. His opponents either end up getting killed or possessed by something and then getting killed. It does strike me, however, that one of the surprising perks of being a supervillain is ringside seats at Santo’s fights. They all seem to get them.\n\nIt’s possible that Peral was a real-life footballer, as the series made a habit of casting athletes from other sports from time to time. However, they usually appeared as themselves rather than being given a character to play, and no available evidence supports the notion. On the other hand, Peral has only one additional acting credit. The woman playing his sister, Estela, appears very briefly in a couple of scenes and has no other acting credits at all. Who is she? Estela Peral! So, make of all that what you will.\n\nOne of the most entertaining of the series. A treasure trove of ridiculous delights for fans of the great man and his (very) strange cinematic adventures.\n\nSanto will return in ‘El barón Brakola/Santo vs. Baron Brakola (1965)‘.\n\n‘In that distant land, I caught an abnormal being.’\n\nA promising young doctor begins working with an older scientist, who is shunned by the medical community due to his mysterious methods. He also neglects his beautiful fiancé, who begins spending time with his new collaborator…\n\nEarly horror talkie from Mexico, directed by Juan José Segura, who also co-scripted the film with Jorge Cardeña Álvarez. Ramón Armengod and Consuelo Frank star as the romantic leads, with Carlos Villarías as the scientist who comes between them.\n\nIt’s another night at the club for amiable man about town Sóstenes (Leopoldo’ Chato’ Ortín). He’s supposed to be meeting his best friend, Dr Alberto Mont (Armengod) and his pretty fiancé Margarita (Frank), but he prefers to spend his time swindling people into paying for his drinks and getting shitfaced. In the meantime, Armengod is defending his new colleague, Dr Denys (Villarías), before representatives of the medical establishment, who regard his clinical successes with suspicion as he refuses to reveal his methods. The elderly Dr Castillo (co-writer Álvarez) also claims to have gone to medical college with Villarías, even though the scientist appears to be only half his age.\n\nOn the same evening, Villarías sends his exotic servant Idúa (Emilio Fernández) to the home of Armengod’s aunt Susanita (Aurora Campuzano) to obtain some of the younger man’s research notes. However, Armengod has brought home the drunken Ortín to sleep it off, and the latter surprises Villarías’ henchman in the act. Of course, without a supporting witness, no one believes Ortín’s fantastic tale and his professions of love for the cynical Campuzano only make things worse. Back at Villarías’ underground laboratory, Fernández delivers the stolen documents. Unexpectedly, they also contain a photograph of Frank, and Villarías is immediately smitten.\n\nThe international success of Universal’s 1930s horror films and their stable of classic monsters did not go unnoticed in other parts of the filmmaking world. This effort to ride their coattails to box office glory is an early effort from the Mexico film industry, which had already tipped its toe tentatively into those murky waters with films like folk horror ‘La Llorona/The Crying Woman’ (1933) and supernatural mystery ‘The Phantom of The Convent/El Fantasma Del Convento/The Fantasy of The Monastery’ (1934). However, the main touchstone here seems to have been ‘Frankenstein’ with an added dash of ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’. Unfortunately, there’s a distinct lack of focus on these elements, and the results are half-baked at best.\n\nThe main issue here is with our villain, the enigmatic Dr Denys. What exactly is he doing? We’re told that his healing methods are nothing short of ‘miraculous’, but no specifics are provided at all, and the sum total of information the audience discovers about his work is that it’s really ‘great’ and ‘humanitarian.’ Whatever he’s up to apparently involves his own private monster (Raúl Urquijo), who he keeps chained up in a subterranean cell. This creature, whose origins or purpose are never explained, is dressed in a torn shirt, rubber fangs and a hideous fright wig. He looks like nothing so much as Bruce Banner waking up in the gutter after a massive bender. Of course, he gets free at the climax because that’s what he’s there for, but otherwise, he seems to be thrown in almost at random.\n\nThe other major problem is the presence of Ortín’s comedy relief. He gets way too much screen time in a role that’s peripheral at best, and his frequent appearances don’t advance the plot a single iota. In fact, there are times when he almost seems to be the film’s lead, and his relationship with Campuzano threatens to overshadow the central romance between Armengod and Frank. This unfortunate emphasis contributes to the slightly muddled, unbalanced feel of the finished film. The nature of the comedy also hasn’t dated too well. Typically, in the 1930’s movie world, severe alcohol dependency was a source of much hilarity, so its treatment here shouldn’t come as any surprise. However, persistently sticking friends with the bill and cheating others into paying otherwise does not make a character cute and endearing, as this film seems to suggest. It’s more likely to be a quick invitation to a knuckle sandwich.\n\nOverall, this feels a lot like Mexican Cinema taking tentative, baby steps into the horror arena. The filmmakers seem unwilling to fully commit to horror themes or ideas, instead almost sidelining Villarías and his experiments (whatever they are!) in favour of more hilarious hi-jinks with the inebriated Ortín. One interesting, if implausible, idea centres around Villarías’ eternal youth and how it unravels. It’s kind of a reverse of Dracula’s deal in Bram Stoker’s original novel, as the Vampire King becomes visibly younger as he consumes more blood. Unfortunately, it’s unlikely that the filmmakers had the skill or resources to realise a subtle depiction of slow ageing, so the concept’s potential is largely wasted. But it’s a rare spark of originality in what’s almost exclusively a grab bag of odd ideas cherry-picked from far better films. Campuzano also has a little dog called ‘Fu Manchu’ who gives such a fine performance, it’s surprising that the world never heard from him again.\n\nVillarías is best remembered for playing the title role in Universal’s Spanish language version of ‘Dracula’ (1931). The film was shot at the same time as the famous Bela Lugosi version using the same sets, with the Spanish crew shooting at night after the main production had finished for the day. A few other horror roles followed, such as this one and ‘The Mystery of the Ghastly Face/El misterio del rostro pálido’ (1935), but Villarías mostly found his niche in supporting roles in mainstream projects. He split his time between the Mexican and American industries, with the latter association providing him with appearances in Western programmers like ‘The California Trail’ (1933) as well as major releases such as ‘Bordertown’ (1936) starring Paul Muni and Bette Davis. He worked regularly until the late 1940s but retired in the early years of the following decade and passed away in 1976.\n\nA largely forgotten film, little more than a minor footnote in Mexican horror history.\n\n‘You will disintegrate into nothing, and you will enter my infernal domain from which nobody ever escapes.’\n\nDuring a wrestling match, a man in a Black Mask appears out of nowhere in the ring and tries to kill one of the fighters with a large hatchet. He vanishes into thin air in front of everyone, and the wrestler attempts to solve the mystery behind the attempt on his life…\n\nAfter battling gangsters, zombies, vampire women and beast men, legendary Mexican luchador Santo finds himself up against witchcraft and Satanic powers for the second time in a row in this early entry in his long-running adventures on film. Director José Díaz Morales returns from ‘Santo in the Witches Attack/Atacan las brujas/The Witches Attack’ (1964), and ex-wrestler Fernando Osés is back behind the typewriter with Rafael García Travesi.\n\nThe film opens with a shock. Santo seems to be dead, carried in mask and cape to his final resting place by a group of chanting monks. Thankfully, when they close the coffin lid, the inscription tells us that events are taking place in ‘the year of our Lord, 1603.’ As soon as the funeral party has departed, the villainous Black Mask (Osés) appears out of thin air, vowing to pursue Santo through the centuries to wreak an act of deadly revenge.\n\nFlash forward to the modern day, and Santo is wrestling in the ring when Osés appears out of nowhere, swinging his hatchet. Santo fights him off, and the mysterious figure vanishes. Santo consults egghead Dr Zanoni (Mario Sevilla), who realises that the weapon bore the ‘mark of satan’. Then the ghost of Dona Isabel de Arango (Lorena Velázquez) appears, asking them to find her bones so her spirit can move on. Santo seems to recognise her, so Sevilla proposes a trip in his time machine.\n\nOk, so there’s more to unpack than usual in this entry in the Santo Cinematic Universe. The notion that Santo’s silver mask and cape have been handed down through the years from one hero to another before arriving on the head and shoulders of the current champion was established pretty early on, in the fifth episode ‘Santo vs. the King of Crime/Santo contra el rey del crimen (1962). This idea was soon expanded into one of the fundamental tropes of the series; various members of his ancestral line fighting supernatural forces who, in defeat, swore vengeance on their conqueror’s descendants. The films went back to this story template again and again.\n\nSanto’s trip in Sevilla’s time machine is in spirit only, allowing him to watch events in the 17th Century when his ancestor loved Velázquez. Unfortunately, Osés was just as smitten with her and pledged his soul to the diabolical Ariman (played by a giant stuffed bat!) in exchange for unearthly powers. Ariman transforms him into Black Mask and showers him with jewels and gold, but it’s useless; Velázquez still turns him down. In retaliation, he kidnaps and chains her up in his secret lair, refusing to reveal her whereabouts even as he’s burned at the Inquisition stake.\n\nSeeing Santo in an earlier incarnation is a solid idea, although it’s plain it’s not the great man himself in the silver eye mask and flowing garb of a sword-wielding cavalier. The fight with Black Mask is also a strong opening, with the wrestling arena partially shot from overhead, which provides some of the dynamism lacking in similar sequences elsewhere in the series. It’s also great fun to watch the referee and Santo’s opponent retreat to neutral corners when Black Mask appears, and the police storm the ring with their guns blazing.\n\nThere’s also a new wrinkle to Santo’s origin story. With Velázquez lost, his ancestor goes to see the hermit Abraca (Sevilla, again). This mystic transforms the cavalier into our familiar well-muscled hero in the iconic silver mask and cape and charges him with his mission to ‘fight evil through the centuries’. In modern times, Sevilla’s Dr Zanoni finds a magic symbol inside Santo’s mask, which provides him with greater strength in times of trial and protection from evil. The magic word inscribed within it? Abracadabra!\n\nThere’s also a curious subplot featuring Santo’s blonde girlfriend, Alicia (Bety González). He takes her for a drive to a picturesque location with a fountain. They stop, and she begs him to give up the mask, and he refuses. Much later in the film, when the audience has forgotten her existence, he drives her out to the same fountain, where they stop for another brief heart-to-heart. Then he drives her away again, back the way they came. Maybe it’s just the place where they like to have serious chats or something.\n\nGonzález’s ultimate fate is quite a dramatic one but is passed over so swiftly that it feels like an afterthought and has no emotional weight. Similarly, the fabulous wealth that Ariman bestows on Osés when he becomes Black Mask seems highly significant. There’s even a scene later on where he’s entertaining two young women with his jewellery collection, but it’s over in the blink of an eye and never mentioned again. These loose threads, a short running time and an uneven rhythm, suggest some significant editing may have occurred at some point.\n\nThis was the second of the four films Santo made for producer Luis Enrique Vergara after the enjoyable but slightly disappointing ‘Santo in the Witches Attack/Atacan las brujas/The Witches Attack’ (1964). This entry benefits from more ambition and invention, even if some animal props are recycled from the witches’ cave. Unfortunately, these look like they were purchased from the worst taxidermist in the world.\n\nStill, Morales keeps things moving at a swift pace, and the story never drags, with Osés always threatening to pop into the frame at any moment with his hatchet swinging. As in Santo’s encounter with the witches, there are no official authorities to gum up the works, save for the brief appearance of the police officers at the arena. This allows for more action, with fewer side characters and less need for chat and exposition. This helps to give the film a more direct, leaner feel than many in the series.\n\nMorales was born in Central Spain in 1908 and worked as a journalist in Madrid up until the Civil War of 1936. Relocating to Mexico as a refugee from the conflict, he began work in the film business as a screenwriter and graduated to the director’s chair with the religious drama ‘Jesús de Nazareth’ (1942). Awards followed for the musical comedy-drama ‘La Revoltosa’ (1950), and he was incredibly prolific during the rest of the decade, shooting approximately 30 pictures. He helmed all four of the features Santo made for Vergara, and although he worked in many different genres, they seem somewhat of an anomaly in his long career. He passed away in 1976.\n\nOne of the sharper early entries in the series and likely to be favoured by aficionados.\n\nSanto will return in ‘Profanadores de tumbas/Santo contra los profanadores de tumbas/Grave Robbers’ (1966)\n\n‘Creatures, whose steps shake these dusty spider webs, which imitate diabolical tentacles ready to trap in their web whatever exudes life.’\n\nNightmares have plagued a young woman since returning to her parent’s house to claim her inheritance. In her dreams, she is abducted by witches to be a human sacrifice, and her only hope is a man in a silver mask…\n\nLegendary Mexican hero and champion of justice, Santo tangles with the supernatural again under the direction of José Díaz Morales. Script duties were in the hands of regular writers Fernando Osés and Rafael García Travesi, who had been involved with other entries, such as ‘Santo and the Vampire Women/Santo vs. las mujeres vampiro’ (1962).\n\nDespite the calming influence of her boyfriend Arturo (Ramón Bugarini), young blonde heiress Ofelia (María Eugenia San Martín) is becoming increasingly nervous. A clause in her late parent’s will means she has to stay in their gloomy old mansion for a year to claim her inheritance, and the atmosphere is getting her down. Every night she dreams of being captured by a witch’s coven led by Mayra (Lorena Velázquez).\n\nAll her fears are pure nonsense, of course, as her parents’ old secretary, Elisa (Velázquez, again), is only happy to confirm. Still, Bugarini takes them seriously and is particularly intrigued by her description of a man in a silver mask, realising that it must be Santo. A little investigation reveals that Elisa died 15 years ago, so he reaches out to the wrestler, who is only too happy to look into the matter himself.\n\nThis was the first in a four-picture deal Santo inked with producer Luis Enrique Vergara, and their first collaboration is a bit of a disappointment. That’s not to say the film is not entertaining; there’s certainly enough action and bizarre elements for fans of the series. The problems are twofold; firstly, it’s just a rehash of ‘Santo and the Vampire Women/Santo vs. las mujeres vampiro’ (1962); secondly, it’s on a noticeably smaller budget and with none of the gothic style of its predecessor. In short, there’s a little less delivered in every department.\n\nStill, there’s plenty to enjoy. Santo is apparently some kind of P.I. now. He has an office in a tower block with a desk and filing cabinet. No more secret underground lab for him or big screen TV communication hookup with the police department. For the first time in the series, this is Santo out on his own; the authorities never appear. There’s also a brand new element: sex. Velázquez sends her right-hand woman Medusa (Edaena Ruiz), to seduce our hero via the time-honoured technique of a drugged drink and glittery underwear, but, fortunately, Santo finds it all a bit absurd and kicks the door down to escape.\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of budget shows through at times. Almost the first fifteen minutes of the film are one of San Martín’s dreams, and these are some of the same events that happen at the end of the film, although it’s not repeated footage. Bugarini’s car accident is horribly unconvincing, and when Santo climbs over the mansion’s wall, the day suddenly turns into night. The only wrestling in the ring also arrives without warning, or any logic, and proves to be one of the contests from ‘Santo vs. the King of Crime/Santo contra el rey del crimen (1962). It’s easy to tell because there’s actor Augusto Benedico as butler-confidante Matias, cheering him on from his corner.\n\nThere is a definite second-hand feel to everything here. High priestess Ruiz resurrects Velázquez at the start of the film. In turn, she invokes their satanic master, Lord of the Shadows. This is beat for beat what happens in ‘Santo and the Vampire Women/Santo vs. las mujeres vampiro’ (1962), which also starred Velázquez in what is effectively the same role. Again, other than Ruiz, her homegirls just stand around as if posing for a photo shoot rather than doing anything, leaving all the action to a trio of nameless male warlocks. One of these is played by Fernando Osés, who fulfilled the same function in the previous film and, as you may recall, was involved with writing both of them.\n\nThe more you look at it, the film seems to be an unofficial remake than anything else. After all, the witches can only be killed by daylight, fire or the symbol of the cross, which sounds a lot more like the weaknesses of vampires. There’s one scene where Velázquez uses her hypnotic powers to get San Martín to take off the crucifix she’s wearing for protection and another where Santo chases some of the witches with burning torches, and they turn into bats! San Martín’s opening voiceover even includes the line, ‘They are ready to drink my blood and transform into a creature of the darkness.’\n\nSo it’s not that far a stretch to suggest that Velázquez and her girl gang were initially written as vampires, and the change to witches came late on in the production process. The film also includes a somewhat baffling disclaimer at the start stating that ‘all the characters are imaginary and fictitious’, which is an oddly redundant thing for the filmmakers to include in a movie about supernatural witches! It’s also inaccurate because Santo is a real person, playing himself!\n\nThere’s also a generally agreed release date of 1968, placing it after the other three films Santo made for producer Vergara and seemingly four years after it was shot. Could legal action of some sort have delayed the release? Mexican fantastic cinema of the period ruthlessly recycled plots, ideas and concepts over and over again, but perhaps this instance of commonality was a little too close for comfort? It’s worth remembering that Santo had broken with his old associates to sign with Vergara.\n\nVergara entered the film business as a producer in the late 1940s and first enjoyed success with the three-part film story of ‘The Black Whip’ (1958), who was played by Luis Aguilar and wasn’t anything like Zorro. After signing up Santo, he also helped bring the wrestler’s main rival, Blue Demon, to the screen with ‘Blue Demon: El Demonio Azul’ (1965). Further projects with Blue followed, and the producer also recruited horror royalty John Carradine and Boris Karloff to appear in multiple productions toward the end of the decade, although sadly never together. The Karloff films were all completed after his death, and Vergara also has a script credit on the last one, the atrocious science-fiction horror ‘The Incredible Invasion’ (1971). It was the final credit for them both.\n\nGood fun on its own terms, but probably best not to compare it to a certain earlier entry in the series.\n\nSanto will return in ‘The Diabolical Hatchet/Santo vs. the Diabolical Hatchet/El hacha diabólica’ (1965)\n\n‘I want to be the star because I am young, I am beautiful, and I sing better than that.’\n\nA masked serial killer targets actresses at a variety theatre. Unable to apprehend him, the investigating police inspector calls in a silver-masked wrestler to break the case…\n\nIt’s another crime-busting assignment for real life, Mexican wrestling legend Santo. René Cardona takes the director’s chair for the first time in the series and co-writes with Rafael García Travesi.\n\nTensions are running high at the theatre owned by businesswoman Claudia (Emma Arvizu). The show must go on, of course, but after the recent two murders committed by the notorious Strangler, performer Odette (Mayte Carol) has had enough. One last trip alone to her dressing room to change, and then she’s clearing out for good. Unfortunately, the killer’s calling card of a White Gardenia is on her table when she gets there, and one quick swish of a sliding panel later, she’s history. It’s the last straw for Inspector Villegas (Carlos López Moctezuma), who orders the theatre closed and calls in his old friend, Santo.\n\nBefore the wrestler can start his investigation, the Strangler recruits some local talent to rub him out and, when that fails, shoots at him with a sniper rifle during a wrestling match. The bullet kills his opponent, Jerry Marcos (Eric del Castillo), the boyfriend of the theatre’s resident bitch, Lilian (Ofelia Montesco). Arvizu’s lawyers have overturned Moctezuma’s court order, and the theatre reopens. On the opening night, the Strangler waits to kill again while Santo and Moctezuma plan to catch him.\n\nIt’s Santo: the Musical! Taking obvious inspiration from ‘The Phantom of the Opera’, writer-director Cardona pits the iconic luchador against ‘The Phantom of a Small Variety Theatre’! Skulking backstage in a mask, hat and cape, the killer is already on the job when the film starts, having claimed two victims already, although the film never bothers the audience with details of who they were. The evening’s show is also in progress with Edith Barr belting out some jazz, Montesco giving us a more sophisticated, slinky number, Irene (Begoña Palacios) making a decent stab at Peggy Lee’s ‘Fever’, Javier (Alberto Vázquez) ripping through Tennessee Ernie Ford’s ’16 Tons’ (mainly in English), and a number from the star of the show, Laura (María Duval). In between the songs are a few lines of dialogue, Carol’s quick backstage murder and a couple of brief trips to see Santo in action in the ring!\n\nOnce all that’s over, we’re twenty minutes in, and it’s time for Moctezuma to ’round up the usual suspects’ after Carol’s body is found. This scene introduces our leading players; the wonderfully cold-blooded Montesco, her dumb wrestler boyfriend del Castillo, arrogant stage manager Julian Fiorelli (Julián de Meriche), owner Claudia (Arvizu), heartthrob Vázquez and singing sisters Duval and Palacios. Moctezuma doesn’t bother inviting hunchbacked caretaker Guillermo Bravo Sosa to the party, so he just hangs around outside, looking suspicious.\n\nSanto prepares for the case by hanging out in his secret lab and talking to the Inspector on his big-screen TV. However, his hideaway doesn’t seem all that secret, considering the Strangler has his phone number! Perhaps it’s listed in the yellow pages. Our mysterious villain’s long record of dastardly crimes is often mentioned, but no details are provided, so the audience gets no context. His attempts to kill Santo are a little puzzling, too, as the only headway our muscular hero makes in the case is the direct result of these botched attempts on his life. It’s more of a ‘whodunnit’ than anything else, as Santo suspects the Strangler is hiding in plain sight as a member of the theatre company.\n\nA strange development is the sudden appearance halfway through the picture of annoying orphan Milton Ray who pops up from the back seat of Santo’s car and wants the grappler to adopt him! It comes completely out of left field and has almost nothing to do with the rest of the film. What’s weirder is that Santo just agrees to do it, and everything is fixed up in moments. No need to bother with all that pesky official paperwork! Later, the kid even gets to sing ‘Blame It On The Bossa Nova’ on stage at the theatre! It’s baffling until you consider the possibility of a record industry tie-up with the film.\n\nVázquez, Duval, Barr and Sonora Santanera (a group who perform a song about football!) were all established recording artists in Mexico when the film was made. Vázquez’s label, Musart, is credited in the opening titles and was a major player in the national music industry, distributing many famous recordings from the ‘British Invasion’ of the 1960s, including singles by Manfred Mann, The Animals and the Beatles. The company still exists today. It’s not unusual for Mexican films to feature a song or two, but the sheer number included here suggests a joint financing arrangement of some kind may have been in place.\n\nOver half a century later, production information on Santo’s films is hard to come by. There is even some difficulty in establishing a clear order of the shooting and theatrical release of the entries in the series. Most sources credit this film with a date of 1965, yet it seems more likely that it was made as early as 1963. Curiously enough, the secret lab that appeared in the loose ‘trilogy’ of early films made by director Fernando Curiel in 1961 (but released in 1963!) makes a reappearance here, when it had not featured in the films, which were apparently shot in between. Whatever the truth of it, given the duplication of some of the cast and crew, it’s highly likely that the sequel, ‘Santo vs. The Ghost of the Strangler/Espectro del estrangulador’ (1963), was shot back to back with this one. After all, actor Roberto Cañedo is third-billed here, which makes little sense considering his small role, but he features heavily in the next film.\n\nCardona was a Cuban national born in Havana in 1905. Due to political unrest in their homeland, his family relocated to New York in 1926. After working as an extra in films, he went to Hollywood and shot its first feature film in the Spanish language. He directed ‘Sombras habaneras’ (1930), wrote it, produced it and took one of the leading roles. In 1932, he moved to Mexico, where he began a dual career as an actor and a director. Over the next half century, he racked up over 100 acting appearances and almost 150 directing credits, mainly in different projects. He first crossed Santo’s path when he unsuccessfully attempted to get the wrestler to star in his own film vehicle ‘El Enmascarado de Plata/The Silver-Masked Man (1954). He began to embrace the fantastical aspects of cinema with ghostly folk tale ‘La Llorona’ (1960) and ‘Doctor of Doom/Las luchadoras contra el médico asesino’ (1963). He would go on to direct nine of Santo’s cinematic adventures and many other horror and science fiction titles before his death in 1988.\n\nIt’s an odd mixture, and the musical numbers slow things down considerably, but there are still some good moments for fans of the great man.\n\nSanto will return in ‘Santo vs. The Ghost of the Strangler/Espectro del estrangulador’ (1963).\n\n‘Later, I’ll turn you into a toad with a tarantula’s head.’\n\nA mortician’s assistant falls in love with a young woman who has come to town to arrange her aunt’s funeral. Unfortunately, she is kidnapped by a mad scientist who plans to transform her into a perfect woman…\n\nGood-natured movie vehicle for popular Mexican funnyman Clavillazo. Julián Soler directs while Evangelina Elizondo and Carlos Orellana co-star and wrote the script together from a story by Fernando Galiana.\n\nIt’s a slow day at the funeral home for the mortician’s assistant, Clavillazo (his name in the movie, too), when in walks love in the beautiful form of the grieving Beatriz (Elizondo). She’s in town to bury her recently deceased aunt but has no money for services. Clavillazo is immediately smitten and pays for everything by borrowing money from friends Gargle (José Wilhelmy) and Popsicle (José Luis Moreno). As she has nowhere to go, he even moves out of his small home so she can move in, and he stays with blind upstairs neighbour Don Melchor (Orellana).\n\nHowever, there has been a spate of grave robbing in the area, and locals are fearful of hunchback Licenciado (Alejandro Reyna), a recent arrival who never speaks to anybody. In reality, he has been brought back from the dead by the mysterious Dr Sputnik(!), who lives in a nearby castle with some monsters (just go with it!) Sputnik is tired of his failed experiments with dead animals and human bodies and wants to experiment on the living. Using his hypnotic powers, he lures Elizondo to his lair. Clavillazo follows, desperate to rescue his lady love.\n\nAbbott and Costello really have a lot to answer for, don’t they? Some say that just meeting up on the big screen with the classic Universal Monsters alone is enough to condemn them. However, those ventures had a less obvious consequence: international copycats. Although this effort is not a direct rip-off of ‘Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein’ (1948) like ‘Frankestein el vampiro y compañía/Frankenstein, the Vampire and Co.’ (1962), it’s glaringly obvious where the inspiration lies. Surprisingly, though, it was released barely a year after the Mexican horror boom began with ‘El Vampiro’ (1957) rather than at the end of such a cycle when its popularity was in decline.\n\nIt’s also unusual that the monsters only feature heavily in the last thirty minutes or so. Indeed, we only visit the castle twice in the film’s first half, and then quite briefly. Instead, the focus is mainly on the romance between Clavillazo and Elizondo, and, although it would be stretching it a little to describe these early scenes as character development, Elizondo is a skilful actress and the two work well together. There are also plenty of opportunities for Clavillazo to present what was likely his trademark screen persona: the socially awkward, big-hearted clown barely hidden beneath a harmless, slightly blow-hard exterior.\n\nThe latter part of the proceedings is, of course, what horror fans will come for, although you probably won’t be surprised to learn that most of it involves Clavillazo running around the castle dungeons and screaming a lot when he encounters its various occupants. There’s a handyman who looks suspiciously like Frankenstein’s Monster, a Beast Man in a cage, a werewolf (Vicente Lara), a Mummy and a cut-price ‘Creature from the Black Lagoon’ (1954)! Best of all, there’s a bloodsucker in a dinner suit played by Germán Robles, reprising his starring role from ‘El Vampiro’ (1957). Sadly, it’s only a brief cameo, but it must have been fun for audiences of the time.\n\nAll of this does call Dr Sputnik’s working practices into question, though. Did he create these creatures in his laboratory? Are they the ‘failed experiments’ he refers to early on? And what is he actually doing anyway? After kidnapping Elizondo, he plans to use mind control to turn her into the ‘perfect woman’; his ‘Galatea’, as he puts it, with a nod to George Bernard Shaw. This is a little weird as he’s already informed us that ‘women are the worst thing in nature.’ What all this has to do with a basement full of monsters, bringing his assistant back from the dead, keeping a pit filled with crocodiles, and grave robbing is anybody’s guess. If I may make a suggestion, the good doctor needs to focus his energies a little more and concentrate on just one area of research at a time.\n\nDelivering laughter is top of the agenda here, and Clavillazo and the filmmakers amp up the energy in the final third and even include a couple of fourth wall breaks. The references to the classic Universal horror films may not be subtle, but they are sometimes vaguely amusing. It’s always nice to see the heroic couple trapped in the room with the crushing walls at the climax, seemingly a nod here to ‘The Raven’ (1935). Gustavo César Carrión’s musical score is impressively gothic at times, too, although obviously, there are a fair amount of wacky cues in the later stages to try and sell some of the gags. Similarly, the sets and Soler’s direction create a bit of atmosphere in the moments between the jokes, and the monster makeups aren’t as tragic as you might expect.\n\nElizondo was a multi-talented individual with more accomplishments than there is room to list here. Born in Mexico City in 1929, she was working as a dancer when she won a national contest to provide the voice of Walt Disney’s ‘Cinderella’ (1950) for its Mexican release. Becoming a successful actress on stage and screen over the next few years, she mainly concentrated on comedies and musicals. She married engineer José Luis Paganoni in 1959 but separated shortly afterwards. In May of the following year, Paganoni shot the well-known actor Ramón Gay outside Elizondo’s home in a fit of jealousy. Gay died of his wounds in hospital, and Paganoni was sent to prison.\n\nThe following year, Elizondo began a complementary music career, releasing the album ‘La sensacional Evangelina’ to great success. Several albums followed, ranging from religious to children’s songs to opera. She also led her own orchestra for 12 years. Scaling down her film career in the 1970s, she studied under some of Mexico’s most notable artists at the National School of Painting and held her first of many solo exhibitions of her work in 1973. There was also time to qualify for a degree in theology before she resurrected her screen career in the late 1980s, which included a featured supporting role in ‘A Walk in the Clouds’ (1995) with Keanu Reeves and Anthony Quinn. She passed in 2017 at the age of 88. Oh, I forgot to mention that she also wrote a couple of books. Because, of course, she did.\n\nHarmless but forgettable horror comedy.\n\n‘Undoubtedly, there’s a monster like this hiding in all human souls.’\n\nMysterious disappearances are occurring in the vicinity of a wax museum. Fearing he’s being framed for these crimes, the owner asks a silver-masked wrestler to investigate on his behalf and prove his innocence…\n\nEveryone’s favourite grappling crimefighter, Santo, returns with writer-director Alfonso Corona Blake for the eighth entry in his cinematic odyssey. Claudio Brook co-stars in another effort that owes an obvious debt to Hollywood horrors of the 1930s.\n\nPhotographing some of the exhibits at a wax museum seems like a straightforward assignment for magazine stringer Susana Mendoza (Roxana Bellini). However, she fails to return afterwards, and a passerby finds her camera on the street. It’s a concern for her sister Gloria (Norma Mora) and reporter Ricardo Carbajal (Rubén Rojo) because two other people have disappeared recently after visiting the museum. Unsurprisingly, the establishment has become the focus of Inspector Fernández (Víctor Velázquez) and his investigations, but owner Dr Karol (Brook) is adamant that he is not involved.\n\nThrough chance, Brook discovers that his good friend Professor Armando Galván (José Luis Jiménez) is acquainted with Santo, so he asks the famous crimefighter to help clear his name. When an attempt is made on Brook’s life by a mysterious assailant (Fernando Osés), Santo agrees. However, he soon comes to suspect that this is an effort at misdirection and that Brook is the man behind everything.\n\nPlundering the vaults of Universal Studios for horror ideas became par for the course in the Mexican film industry after the considerable success of Abel Salazar’s ‘El vampiro’ (1957), which stuck pretty close to the Lugosi template of Tod Browning’s ‘Dracula’ (1931). However, on this occasion, the filmmakers cast their net a little wider for inspiration, zeroing in on projects from two rival studios. The result is a mash-up of elements from Warner Bros’ ‘Mystery of the Wax Museum’ (1933) and Paramount’s ‘Island of Lost Souls’ (1932), which was based on the H G Wells novel ‘The Island of Dr Moreau.’ The surprise box-office success of the former’s remake, ‘House of Wax’ (1953) with Vincent Price, was probably also a touchstone.\n\nUnfortunately, this combination makes for an awkward, messy concoction that, although enjoyable, doesn’t hang together as a coherent story. The problem centres around the activities of Brook’s Dr Karol and his strange museum. It’s a going concern, with a ‘Chamber of Horrors’ in the basement. There we find Jack the Ripper, Bluebeard and other real-life monsters, but also featured are Mr Hyde, Quasimodo and a fair approximation of Karloff’s Frankenstein Monster. Added to that are many non-specific ‘beast men’ who don’t seem to be famous in the slightest.\n\nIt’s no spoiler to reveal that Brook is the main villain, the film giving up on any pretence otherwise before it reaches the halfway point. It was pretty clear from the start, anyway. When he chats with Bellini, he asks her if she wants to see his laboratory, which is usually a dead giveaway. Then he mentions that his next intended creation is a Panther Woman, which would have been an obvious red flag for her if she’d ever seen ‘Island of Lost Souls’ (1932). The problem with it all is that it doesn’t make any sense. Karol is obsessed with ‘the ugliness in men’s souls’ and clearly deranged, but what is he trying to achieve? What’s his endgame, apart from indulging his madness?\n\nThere’s also a lack of fundamental clarity about the basic setup. Henchmen Osés and Nathanael León stand ready to operate a vat of boiling wax in Brook’s lab, which suggests that he is using the kidnapped victims to create his exhibits. Yet the ‘Beast Men’ come to life at night and obviously can’t just be people covered in wax. Also, how come they are just inanimate figures during the day? Brook seems to have no method of controlling them. It’s all a bit puzzling, really.\n\nStill, that’s hardly the point. Santo gets it, and that’s the important thing. We’ll just trust in the great man’s judgement. Actually, what strains credibility the most is that Brook has never heard of the Man in the Silver Mask! Conveniently, this allows friend Jiménez to provide a thumbnail sketch of his achievements and activities, bringing anyone in the audience unaware of his crime-busting activities up to speed. Jiménez can also contact Santo via a wall TV which can find him wherever he is via some kind of magic floating camera thingy that must follow him around. One time the Prof calls him up, he’s in the ring for one of the rather lengthy wrestling sequences. His opponents in this film are Caveman Joe Henderson and a Frenchman known as Billy the Legs!\n\nOne of the film’s highlights is the performance of the tall, rail-thin Brook. At first, he’s very gracious and distinguished as Karol, although he does seem a tad too enthusiastic about his work when he talks to Bellini. As time progresses, he unravels in fine fashion until he’s chewing the scenery with the best of them at the somewhat demented climax. For a change, the character gets a decent amount of backstory, which is unusual in one of Santo’s films. Velázquez tags him as a concentration camp survivor who ran a similar establishment in London. As in ‘Mystery of the Wax Museum’ (1933) and ‘House of Wax’ (1953), this went up in flames with Brook severely injured. However, a photograph sent from London suggests that he hasn’t aged at all in the years since. If you’re familiar with the other films, you’ll know what that means; only it doesn’t, as this film promptly forgets all about it.\n\nThis film was the first of the series where Osés gets no writing credit, just one for his work in front of the camera. Director Blake also ditches the heavy gothic tones he brought to the previous entry, ‘Santo and the Vampire Women/Santo vs. las mujeres vampiro’ (1962) – the films released between them were shot earlier in 1961. Instead, he favours a far more contemporary approach, perhaps reflecting that this was more of a modern-day story, with an outlandish threat but not one that was supernatural.\n\nSome of the uncredited supporting cast display skill at portraying the waxworks, whereas others are definitely struggling. The exhibits on the top floor of Brook’s museum are also an unusual combination. There’s film star Gary Cooper standing next to Mahatma Gandhi, who is rubbing shoulders with Josef Stalin! Strange bedfellows, to be sure, but probably the only genuine waxworks the production could lay their hands on. It’s also interesting that Mr Hyde, Quasimodo and the Frankenstein Monster sit out the climactic fight and let the Beast Men grab the glory. Perhaps they feared a sudden assault by a group of copyright lawyers.\n\nBrook was born in Mexico City in 1927 and began his screen career in the mid-1950s. Some of his first credits were four guest appearances on TV’s ‘Sheena, Queen of the Jungle’ and a role in Republic Pictures ‘Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer’ (1956) which also featured Lon Chaney Jr. In 1960, he featured in celebrated director Luis Buñuel’s unusual but effective, ‘The Young One/La joven’ (1960), which starred former Hollywood leading man Zachary Scott late in his career. Brook appeared several more times for Buñuel and, by the end of the 1960s, had also appeared in diverse projects such as Louis Malle’s enjoyable comedy-western ‘Viva Maria!’ (1966) and as the lead of Eurospy ‘Coplan Saves His Skin/Coplan sauve sa peau’ (1968). He also starred in the title role of the religious epic ‘Jesus, our Lord/Jesús, nuestro Señor’ (1971). He passed away in 1995 with over 100 film and TV credits.\n\nA little too slow and cluttered to be one of Santo’s best outings, but still good value entertainment.\n\nSanto will return in ‘Santo vs the Strangler/Santo vs el estrangulador’ (1963)"
