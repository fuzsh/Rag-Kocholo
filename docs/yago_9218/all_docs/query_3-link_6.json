        "text": "'La Choca' (also known under the rather useless English title 'The Bump') is a pretty wild Mexploitation ride that wasn't quite what I expected. I was waiting for kind of a home invasion revenge story, but that's not exactly what this is. The story takes a few turns I didn't see coming and especially the title character La Choca - the scared wife of the man who's jungle home falls victim to an invasion of drug smugglers that he betrayed - developed in ways I didn't expect.\n\nThe opening five minutes featuring multiple kills by wild animals and shoot-outs are a pretty crazy way to start this off and it certainly doesn't keep up that pace, but I still mostly enjoyed this. It's well shot and acted and it was nice to see Mexican Sam Peckinpah regular Santiago Eduardo Urueta in this.\n\nNot a great choice to get started on Mexican exploitation but a curious one for fans.\n\nStrange late-career piece by Emilio Fernandez, about drug-smugglers home-invading a family's thatched cottage in the Oaxacan outback; there's some attempt, early on, to affirm the progressivist values that EF had always preached, but those quickly get subsumed into a... would you call it a meditation on the deep-rooted violence in Mexican history? You might...\n\nIt has the tone of Mariscal/Delfos' early-seventies westerns -- violence and ugliness, with a bruise-colored tonal palette. I wasn't thinking much of it, but the last reel -- where one of the women becomes an avatar of Coatlicue, in a major, major twist ending -- had me riveted.\n\nAVAILABILITY: shite rip, no subs.\n\nEDIT: A line of dialogue during the fade-out goes full-circle in reaffirming the Fernandez humanism that was on display in the beginning. Missed it, till I went and read contemporary reviews."
