Gina Tognoni plays the eccentric, slightly off-beat, beautiful Kelly Cramer, who came to Llanview for a fresh start after being kicked out of boarding school. Kelly had her sights set on a grand new life with her rich Aunt Dorian. Since her arrival, Kelly has grown a lot. Much to Dorian's dismay, Kelly got together with Joey Buchanan (a very young ex-lover of Dorian's). The two had a nice relationship, until Joey left for Paris, leaving Kelly behind, which was achieved by Dorian's interference. Kelly has now befriended Joey's cousin Drew, especially now that she has learned that she was the driver, who caused the accident that killed her cousin Blair's unborn baby. Of course this is known only by Kelly and Drew (at least so far).

Gina was born in St. Louis, Missouri and grew up in Syracuse, New York and Bristol, Rhode Island. A former beauty pageant participant, Gina was named Miss Rhode Island Teen USA in 1992. She went on to compete in the Miss Teen USA Pageant, where she placed in the top 12 in the country and won the title of Miss Photogenic. After winning Miss Rhode Island Teen All-American in 1993, Gina was first runner-up in the Miss Teen All-American Pageant.

It was this pageant that would be the start of Gina's career. Her future manager, who was judging the competition, and actress Halle Berry, also a judge, noticed Gina among the crowd of participants and approached her after the show. Gina was signed almost immediately and went to New York to study acting.

Gina had just moved to California to begin auditioning when she received a casting call for the role of Kelly Cramer. This is the first professional role of Gina's career.

When not working, Gina is a self-proclaimed "astrology addict," and enjoys horseback riding, skiing, and songwriting.
