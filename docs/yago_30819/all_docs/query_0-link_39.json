        "text": "On today’s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Regan discuss the latest in All My Children, As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:\n\nVincent Irizarry’s contract status at All My Children and the Who Killed David Hayward murder mystery that had David laid out on a morgue slab. Can’t get enough of JR and Annie? Well expect them in even more story, but with that comes more air time for Scott and Marissa. Jamey has a Wishful Casting replacement for Marissa that should make DC’s Mel happy. What is Asher up to and who is his father?\n\nAs the World Turns killed of Reid and gave his heart to Chris Hughes. Does this mean that Noah ends up winning Luke by default? John Dixon’s return to Oakdale and his ripping into Lucinda provided some wonderful scenes between Larry Bryggman and Elizabeth Hubbard. Will the DC gang be watching ATWT’s replacement The Talk when it premieres?\n\nOwen delivers Bridget’s baby on The Bold and the Beautiful. Does anyone else think Jackie is headed for a breakdown and kidnapping storyline? Rick kissing Jackie came out of left field. Where is that plot point headed? The father/son story of Bill and Liam continues to be B&B’s best story as Scott Clifton and Don Diamont go toe-to-toe.\n\nWhat is happening to Days of our Lives once delicious villain Vivian? Dena Higley has let it be known she’s writing DAYS, but its ratings are down. Where did her shiny ball go that had kept her occupied? Jennifer returns to Salem to facilitate Bo and Hope’s reunion.\n\nGeneral Hospital’s Brenda and Sonny finally reunite, but is Regan happy with how this storyline is playing out? All this talk of Brenda has given Sam and Carly a lot to worry and each is handling it differently. What will these two do when Brenda arrives back in Port Charles? Robin punches the psycho Lisa and lets Patrick know it isn’t about him, it’s about their daughter. Wouldn’t it have been nice if Anna or Robert had been the one to get Lucky to go under cover?\n\nOne Life to Live put out a casting call for Joey Buchanan. Luke suggests ATWT’s Eric Sheffer Stevens while Jamey thinks ATWT’s Michael Park is perfect for the role, especially if OLTL had been able to cast Jon Hensley as Kevin Buchanan. Will casting Joey fix Gina Tognoni’s storyline as Kelly Cramer? Jamey reveals what he’s been hearing about the Roger Howarth rumors.\n\nRonan shot Chance on The Young and the Restless, but is Chance really dead? Can soaps do crime mystery storylines well or she they focus on other things? Jamey’s beloved Villy got married, but Jillian and Luke weren’t feeling it. Luke suggests a Phyllis/Deacon/Nikki triangle would be smokin’ hot. Is Y&R really implying with Nikki’s storyline that the only way a woman can take on Victor is if she is drunk?"
