        "text": "Kevin Buchanan and Lee Ann Demerest\n\nFirst Got Together: 1991\n\nKevin began seeing Lee Ann right after breaking up with his first real girlfriend — Carlo Hesser’s niece, Stephanie. However, Max Holden was also in love with Lee Ann. When it appeared that Max had moved on with Luna, Lee Ann and Kevin slept together; they eloped when they learned she was carrying his child. Soon after, though, Lee Ann cheated on Kevin with Jason Webb. She and Kevin divorced, and she moved to Texas with their son, Duke. An adult Duke recently returned to town.\n\nJoey Buchanan and Dorian Lord\n\nFirst Got Together: 1994\n\nDorian originally seduced — and deflowered — the younger Joey so she\n\ncould stick it to his mother, her long-time rival, Viki. Revenge\n\neventually turned into romance, however, as the duo discovered that they\n\nhad genuine feelings for one another. Their affair came to an end when\n\nViki (under the influence of her alternate personalities) imprisoned\n\nDorian and blackmailed her into dumping Joe.\n\nJessica Buchanan and Cristian Vega\n\nFirst Got Together: 1995\n\nJessica and Cristian’s relationship definitely had its ups and downs.\n\nWhen a then-high school-age Jessica and Cristian began seeing each\n\nother, her father, Clint, and Cris’s mother, Carlotta, disapproved.\n\nStill, they continued to sneak around. They were forbidden to see each\n\nother after they were caught heading for Viki’s cabin in the woods, but\n\nwere permitted to go to the prom. However, at the event, Jess got drunk\n\nafter seeing Cristian dance with her friend; she then dumped him. The\n\npair eventually reconciled, but Jessica was wary of his relationship\n\nwith childhood friend Roseanne. Jessica also befriended her new\n\nstepbrother, Will, and ended up getting pregnant with — and then losing\n\n— his baby. Things got more complicated for the couple when Roseanne and\n\nWill worked together to keep the pair apart, and Roseanne tricked Cris\n\ninto marrying her. Eventually, Cris and Roseanne had their marriage\n\nannulled and he got engaged to Jessica. Their relationship fizzled,\n\nthough, when he lied to Jess about a letter from Will.\n\nKelly Cramer and Joey Buchanan\n\nFirst Got Together: 1996\n\nWhen Dorian’s niece, Kelly, came to town, she had her first serious\n\nrelationship with Joey. He soon left for Paris, though, and sent her a\n\n“Dear Jane” letter to break up with her; a distraught Kelly went for a\n\ndrive and ended up in a car accident with her pregnant cousin, Blair,\n\nkilling Blair’s unborn child. Joey returned the next year, and he and\n\nKelly rekindled their relationship. They got engaged, but by then, Kelly\n\nhad developed feelings for Kevin. In 2000, she and Joey eloped, but her\n\ninterest in Kevin was too strong to ignore; she admitted everything to\n\nJoey and they divorced in 2001."
