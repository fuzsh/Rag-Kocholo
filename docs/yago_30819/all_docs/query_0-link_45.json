        "text": "As the World Turns favorite Terri Colombino (Ex-Katie) spoke with TV Guide for a preview of her new role of Aubrey Wentworth, the secret sweetheart of Joey Buchanan (Tom Degnan) on One Life to Live who will first be seen on November 29. She also discusses the fan backlash to the ending of the Reid Oliver/Chris Hughes storyline that ended in tragedy in Oakdale. Here are a few excerpts!\n\nColombino on if she hopes she will be vying for the attention of Joey with his ex-flame Kelly (Gina Togoni): “Oooh, I hope so! I love triangles, and I love Gina! I did my very first scenes with her. Kelly and Aubrey meet on the plane and start chatting it up, girlfriend-style. Kelly says there’s this guy in her life she’s finally realized is her true love and she’s going to tell him. And Aubrey talks about her man and how she’s going to Llanview to see him. Neither ever mentions the name Joey — but of course they’re both talking about the same guy!”\n\nColombino on ATWT sacrificing the gay character of Reid in order for the straight character of Chris to live and love and have a heart: “I had no idea about the controversy until after the show was off the air. I didn’t know people were upset but I can certainly understand it. They loved Reid and latched right onto him, and Eric is an amazing actor. I think they’re making it a sexual orientation issue — why does the gay guy have to be the only one who is not happy at the end? — but I don’t believe it was that at all. Chris’s heart condition and Reid’s death provided a huge and important story for the whole Hughes family. Look at the work Kathryn Hays [Kim] did — she’s going to win an Emmy! It’s understandable that people want everything tied up with a nice little bow. Everybody wants everybody happy, and Luke and Reid had developed such a great relationship. They were just starting out in life. I understand the disappointment, but I was surprised at the depth of it.”\n\nThe multi-talented Melanie Smith (ex-Emily Stewart, As the World Turns ) career has seen her go from young actress bad girl on the beloved CBS soap opera, to becoming a life coach, and to now in 2024, releasing a jazz album as a vocalist.\n\nSmith enlisted some of the greatest session musicians in the jazz world for her project; many of whom played with the late Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, on their Grammy-Award winning album.\n\nDuring an all-new visit to the Michael Fairman Channel, Smith talked about her time on ATWT, why she decided to depart the show after five years, how she felt about Kelly Menighan taking over the part, and how releasing her upcoming album, The Broken and the Breaker, has been a passion project she has had in mind for several years.\n\nThe first single from the album, the classic song, Smile, is given a new twist by Smith and is available now on Spotify and other music streaming platforms. For more on the release and all the songs on The Broken and the Breaker, many of which are co-written by Melanie, and several of which are jazz cover tunes, make sure to click here.\n\nIn addition to chatting on her new album, Melanie shared how art imitated life when she landed the role of Emily on ATWT in the first place, “I used to joke, I never wanted to be an actress, I just wanted to live in Oakdale.” She explained, “It was my mom’s favorite show, and so I was like obsessed with Oakdale. My friends would rush home (from school) to watch (GH’s) Luke and Laura, and I was rushing home to watch James and Barbara. When I got that job, my mom lost her mind. She just thought it was incredible.”\n\nSmith also revealed her thoughts when the soap was sadly canceled, “When the show went off the air it was so sad, But, it was so sad that the genre on the East Coast went off the air. To me, I don’t care what anybody says, reality television does not replace this art. I think it’s a loss for those of us that really loved that daily experience and those stories.”\n\nAfter playing Emily from 1987-1992, Smith made the decision to exit ATWT. She says the decision was something she had to do. “It wasn’t hard. Doug Marland (ex-head writer, ATWT) really tried to get me to stay. He was so wonderful to me. I loved him, but my mother was dying,” admitted Smith. “Then once that happened, something happened to me. I needed to be somewhere else. So, I wouldn’t say it was necessarily hard to leave. Did I miss? It’s still to this day, my favorite genre.”\n\nAfter Smith never returned, the soap hired Kelly Menighan to take over the role of Emily in 1983. Melanie shared her thoughts on another actress taking on the part. “I didn’t have a problem with someone taking the role over. I did think it was a very different character. I really only watched on occasion. But, I did think it was a whole different interpretation, which is fair. It’s fair to reinterpret a character when you make it your own. There was no obligation or reason for her to follow in my footsteps.”\n\nNow below check out our full conversation with Melanie.\n\nThen let us know, did you enjoy Melanie as ATWT’s Emily? What do you think of her new single “Smile” which you can preview below? Share your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nAfter much speculation, General Hospital’s Jon Lindstrom (Kevin) and Cady McClain (ex-Jennifer, DAYS, ex-Rosanna, ATWT, ex-Dixie, AMC et al) have officially confirmed and announced they have gone their separate ways and have ended their marriage.\n\nFor months on social media, it was clear that the two were seemingly apart, not appearing pictured in any of each others posts.\n\nNow, on a mutually shared Instagram post, Jon and Cady made an official statement on the status of their relationship, beginning with “Cady and Jon here. We are taking this opportunity to make a short statement about our relationship status. It may be obvious to some based on our posts that we’ve taken some time apart. After serious consideration we have decided that our goals have been taking us in different directions and to end our marriage.”\n\nAs to the future, Jon and Cady explained, “We remain friends and wish each other every happiness. As people who work in the public eye, it can be difficult to have a private life. Regardless, we ask for your kind consideration in this matter.”\n\nJon and Cady met when they both appeared on As the World Turns, he as Craig Montgomery, and she as Rosanna Cabot. After four years together, the couple decided to get married in 2014.\n\nShare your well-wishes for Jon and Cady’s separate futures as they ask for privacy on this matter in the months ahead via the comment section below."
