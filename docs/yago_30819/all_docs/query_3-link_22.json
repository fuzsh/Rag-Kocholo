        "text": "The role of ________ will now be played by!\n\nList some of the soaps best and worst recasts. (This may have been done before...)\n\nNo particular order\n\nBEST\n\nLesli Kay as Felicia Forrester, B&B\n\nRobin Strasser as Dorian Lord, OLTL (I never saw other Dorians but you can assume right?)\n\nBilly Miller as Billy Abbott (Y&R)\n\nPeter Bergman as Jack Abbot (never saw Terry Lester but - I'm thinking of how the actor has been able to embody the role and become known for it)\n\nJess Walton as Jill Foster Abbott (same reasoning as above)\n\nJeff Branson as Shane, GL (havent seen the others but this one really looks like he could be J&R's son)\n\nJudith Chapman as Gloria Fisher Abbott, Y&R (Sorry JVA but you can pick up your face and go home. Judith Chapman owns the role, even if she should walk around with her hand cupped in front of her face in case her eyeballs fall out)\n\nBilly Magnussen as Casey Hughes, ATWT\n\nHunt Block as Craig Montgomery, ATWT\n\nTrevor St. John as Todd Manning, OLTL (ducking veggies)\n\nKassie DePaiva as Blair Cramer, OLTL\n\nWORST\n\nNoelle Beck as Lily Snider ATWT\n\nAlmost any of ATWT's recent mishaps\n\nCharity Rahmer as Belle Black (This one owns it I'm sure)\n\nChristina Chambers as Molly Conlan McKinnon, ATWT\n\nChristina Chambers as Marty Saybrook, OLTL\n\nAmelia Heinle as Victoria Newman, Y&R\n\nTammin Sursok as Colleen Carlton, Y&R\n\nJon Lindstrom as Craig Montgomery\n\nJennifer Bransford as Carly Corinthos, GH\n\nthere are scores more! Let us know what you think\n\nRepetitive but I love this particular subject\n\nBEST:\n\nCarrie Genzel as Skye Chandler, All My Children\n\nCarrington Garland as Kelly Capwell, Santa Barbara\n\nJess Walton as Jill Abbott, The Young and the Restless\n\nGordon Thomson as Mason Capwell, Santa Barbara\n\nKaren Witter as Tina Lord, One Life To Live\n\nMichael Lowry as Jake Martin, All My Children\n\nCady McClain as Rosanna Cabot, As The World Turns\n\nWinsor Harmon as Thorne Forrester, The Bold and the Beautiful\n\nSean Kanan as AJ Quartermaine, General Hospital\n\nKimberly Simms as Mindy Lewis, Guiding Light\n\nHunt Block as Craig Montgomery, As The World Turns\n\nPeter Bergman as Jack Abbott, The Young & the Restless\n\nBrenda Epperson as Ashley Abbott, The Young and the Restless\n\nRobin Mattson as Janet Green, All My Children\n\nWORST\n\nSusan Batten as Luna, er Connor Walsh, As The World Turns\n\nEileen Davidson as Kelly Capwell, Santa Barbara\n\nTerry Lester as Jack, er Mason Capwell, Santa Barbara\n\nChristina Chambers as Marty Saybrooke, One Life To Live\n\nKrista Allen as Billie Reed, Days of our Lives\n\nAnn Hamilton as Mindy Lewis, Guiding Light\n\nChristina Chambers as Molly Conlon, As The World Turns\n\nGlynnis O'Connor as Margo Hughes, As The World Turns\n\nJeffrey Meek as Craig Montgomery, As The World Turns\n\nBest recasts\n\nI think one of the most successful one in recent years is probably Austin Peck replacing Patrick Muldoon. The recast went on to sort of personify soap hunkdom.\n\nJill Larson as Opal on AMC was good, but she is no Dorothy Lyman.\n\nCady McCain as a brilliant recast as Dixie Cooney.\n\nJay Kenneth Johnson gets the award for best re-recast in reclaiming his Philip role on DOOL.\n\nThere are so many...the guy who played Nik on GH while Tyler Christopher took a few years off was good. John Ingle is great as Edward Quartermaine.\n\nB&B\n\nGood\n\nHeather Tom as Katie (Not great so far, but it's not her fault)\n\nLesli Kay as Fefe (Colleen Dion was great originally, but Lesli Kay fits Felicia now)\n\nWinsor Harmon as Thorne\n\nJacq M-W as Steffy (Spot on for looks and one of the best younger cast members in a long while)\n\nKyle Lowder as Rick (Not a huge fan of him, but he's better than Torkildsen, IMO)\n\nBad\n\nEmily Harrison as Bridget (I don't think she would've been that bad had she not followed JenFin so quickly)\n\nI guess we haven't had that many recasts, especially compared to other shows.\n\nBEST\n\nJess Walton as Jill Abbott, Y&R (\"Yes I wanted to hurt Katherine! She killed my Phillip!\" The Greatest Recast Ever)\n\nPeter Bergman as Jack Abbott, Y&R (\"Have a seat, on me!\")\n\nBilly Miller as Billy Abbott, Y&R\n\nLauren Koslow as Kate Roberts, DAYS (while I too love Deborah Adair I think Koslow reinvented the role and gave Kate staying power, passion and bite)\n\nMartha Madison as Belle Black, DAYS (she's a great young actress, DAYS really blew it on that one!)\n\nLesli Kay as Felicia Forrester, B&B\n\nWinsor Harmon as Thorne Forrester, B&B (plays rage better than anyone)\n\nAustin Peck as Brad Snyder, ATWT (who knew he could act!? He's got an 'aww shucks' style that is perfect in that role)\n\nJoan Collins as Alexandra Spaulding, GL (\"I'm Alexandra Spaulding and I couldn't care less!\" She can read the phone bookd and I love her)\n\nConstance Towers as Helena Cassadine, GH (Ice Cold Blonde, perfect)\n\nAnne Heche as Vicki and Marley Love, AW (\"So is that why you jumped into that sack with your son in law *slap*)\n\nCarmen Duncan as Iris Cory, AW (not everyone's taste...but I LOVED her, much sexier and more humorous than Beverlee McKinsey's Iris, she played her light and I loved it)\n\nJill Larson as Opal Courtland, AMC\n\nDan Gauthier as Kevin Buchanan, OLTL (ABC really blew it with him)\n\nWORST\n\nAmelia Heinle as Victoria Newman, Y&R (dull but I bet she might just improve, she's got a cute baby though)\n\nTammin Sursock as Colleen Carlton, Y&R (can't get her accent right, doesn't look like she cares to be there...just...no)\n\nSusan Walters as Diane Jenkins, Y&R (Alex Donnelly IS Diane Jenkins)\n\nRachel Kimsey as Mackenzie Browning, Y&R (smarmy, sugar coated crap)\n\nMackenzie Mauzy as Phoebe Forrester, B&B (can't act her way out of a paper bag, thank you for killing her off Brad!)\n\nPhelice Sempler as Donna Love, AW (Anna Stuart IS Donna Love)\n\nJosh Taylor as Roman Brady, DAYS (loved him on The Hogan Family, loved him on Y&R, loved him on DAYS as Chris...)\n\nCharity Rhamer as Belle Black, DAYS (there are no words...)"
