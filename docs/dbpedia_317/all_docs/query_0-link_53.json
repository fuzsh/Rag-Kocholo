Photo © Mark Zanzig/zanzig.com\n\nThe story behind the image\n\nVictoria on Vancouver Island is proud of its heritage and presents the culture of the First Nations in several places across the city. One of the most fascinating place is Thunderbird Park in downtown Victoria. Established in 1941 as a display of totem poles from the provincial museum’s collection at the corner of Belleville and Douglas streets. In 1952 they needed restoration, and Kwakwaka’wakw master carver, Mungo Martin, as chief carver.\n\nWhen we explored the harbour and the city center, we also visited this beautiful place. I especially liked this totem pole and took a couple of photos.\n\nThe high resolution image"
