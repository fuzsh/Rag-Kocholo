The province of BC is home to more than 200 distinct First Nations — a third of all of Canada. Totem poles are unique monuments carved from large trees and embody significant historical narratives. They depict spiritual reverence, family legends, sacred beings or historical events of First Nations people and can be found in many areas of BC. If you happen to be in these areas, go check them out. Most of the ones I mention below are in the lower mainland and Vancouver Island but there are many more totem poles throughout BC. When I was in my teens, I visited Ksan Village and watched a master carver create a new totem pole. I would love to drive north again and see all of this with fresh eyes. Please comment below and tell me of the ones you’ve seen that I need to visit. I’ll update this post as I see more!\n\nBritish Columbia is home to Métis and more than 200 distinct First Nations – one-third of all the Indigenous people in Canada.\n\nindigenoustourism.ca\n\nVancouver Airport\n\nTotem poles and aboriginal carvings are scattered throughout YVR airport, particularly the terminal.
