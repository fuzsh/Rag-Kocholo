The 92 sport had the same style front and rear bumper as the 93, and almost the same moldings except that on the sides it had chrome trim at the back of the quarter molding, which 93s didn't have. If you pause the video at 1:32 there is a broadside shot of the car, and you can see the chrome on the body side molding. Between that and the wheels, that tells me it is a 92 sport. Granted someone could have changed the wheels, but on a movie set, if they were going to change the wheels because some were damaged, they would probably get the same style wheels so they have continuity through the film. Plus there is no reason they would take off the body side moldings to replace them with an earlier style with such a slight difference.\n\nYou make an interesting point, and frankly, I think you are right, I stand corrected :thumbsup:\n\nXR7-4.6\n\n· Banned\n\n1994 Cougar XR7 DOHC/5-Speed\n\nJoined Apr 7, 2006\n\n·\n\n25,077 Posts\n\nThat doesn't say it was a sport, 92 LX's were identical to the sport other than the tape stripes and badge. Only the base had the non SC style bumper in 92.\n\nIt's not uncommon for there to be more than one car used for stunts in a movie, but the pic in the first post is clearly a 93. As for the wheels 89-92 wheels would've been much more common at the time of the filming than fanblades. If you know you needed to stockpile wheels for stunts are you going to use a 5 year old wheel or a two year old wheel design to trash multiple times?\n\n1996Project-bird\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Mar 25, 2010\n\n·\n\n1,728 Posts\n\nThat bird is a tank.\n\nR1dd1cK\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Sep 26, 2006\n\n·\n\n461 Posts\n\nOk well back to the main thing of this thread Louvers.

I knew they made louvers in that style for our cars but really want some sleeker looking louvers that look more like the old Mustang Mach 1s.\n\nI'm thinking I'll need to make my own.

That is kinda cool...I just watched the youtube video in this thread...classic line from the bum at the end of the video...IIRC there is more footage later in the film of that black bird, seems like it goes into the bay at some point...what I'd like to see is the cars used for the huuuge jumps right after the jump occured...hard hits like that would have to cause some damage.\n\nmachausta\n\n· Registered\n\n2018 Ford F-150 XLT V8\n\nJoined Jan 29, 2004\n\n·\n\n1,087 Posts\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_%28film%29\n\n1993 Thunderbird LX is the plotline...but watching the film, there are at least 2 Thunderbirds, and one is a 92 (hint: its not this one)\n\nhttp://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_16974-Ford-Thunderbird-1992.html\n\nmachausta\n\n· Registered\n\n2018 Ford F-150 XLT V8\n\nJoined Jan 29, 2004\n\n·\n\n1,087 Posts\n\nThis is the 93 rear end you guys were looking at...\n\nThis is a 92.

Does anyone know 100% what year Thunderbird rear window louvers they have on that car? To me it looks like the louvers I've seen on the fox birds from time to time.\n\nThis has been bugging me since I bought mine because I have always wanted those louvers but could never find them. Not going to pick up the ones you can get for the MN12 birds...not that there is anything wrong with them I just really want to find those specific louvers.\n\nHere is a pic of the car if you have never seen or don't remember the movie.\n\nCheck out the first stickie in this section. page 2, post 42\n\nRaptor22\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Dec 13, 2009\n\n·\n\n2,294 Posts\n\nJeez.
