The series has struck a chord among viewers of all ages with its unique perspective and its authentic, relatable and hilarious take on family relationships,” said Sally Catto, general manager, programming, CBC. “We couldn’t be more thrilled with how CBC audiences have responded to the series and its talented cast, and look forward to partnering with Thunderbird and Soulpepper to bring fans a second season in 2017.”\n\n\"All of us at Kim’s have loved making this show and are enormously gratified that it has connected with audiences so viscerally, “ said the series’ producer, Ivan Fecan. “We can't wait to start work on season two.\"\n\nBased on the Soulpepper production of Ins Choi’s award-winning play, KIM’S CONVENIENCE is the funny, heartfelt story of The Kims, a Korean-Canadian family who run a convenience store in downtown Toronto.
