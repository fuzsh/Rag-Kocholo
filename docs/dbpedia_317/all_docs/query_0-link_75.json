        "text": "Funds flow for B.C. films\n\nGetting started in the film industry isn’t easy. Accordingly, five emerging B.C. filmmakers are receiving a helping hand from the BC District Council of the Directors Guild of Canada, and British Columbia Film. Out of 41 applicants, Colin Cunningham, Robert Holbrook, Ryan Mains, Leigh Ann Maynard, and Brae Norwiss will each receive a boost of $20,000 in financial support (plus post-production assistance) from the Kick Start 2007 program to make his or her own 10-minute calling-card film or video. Each filmmaker will work with a mentor director (Martin Wood, Scott Smith, Andrew Currie, Tara Hungerford, and Michael Bafaro, respectively) who will act as a consultant for their project. Applicants were judged on a 10-page script and a variety of criteria including craft skills and imagination. The program, now in its 13th year, has recognized such recipients as Julia Kwan (Eve & the Fire Horse), Aubrey Nealon (A Simple Curve), and Trent Carlson (The Delicate Art of Parking).\n\nMeanwhile, British Columbia Film also announced the seven recipients of the Slate Development Fund 2006/07. Each will receive a financing envelope to assist in the development and marketing of a portfolio (rather than just one individual project) of independent film and TV productions. According to Lodi Butler, director of development initiatives and partnerships at British Columbia Film, Atomic Cartoons (Atomic Betty), Howe Sound Films, and Infinity Filmed Entertainment Group (Almost Heaven, Ben Johnson: Drugs & the Quest ?for Gold?) will each receive ?$100,000 while Keatley Entertainment (Cold Squad, Godiva’s), Nerd Corps Entertainment, Shavick Entertainment, and Thunderbird Films will each ?receive $150,000, all for a total budget allocation of $900,000.\n\n> Craig Takeuchi\n\nCanadian great to be feted at Whistler\n\nNorman Jewison gets the tribute treatment at the Sixth Annual Whistler Film Festival, happening for four days in the mountain village, starting next Thursday (November 30), with the director of Moonstruck and other popular favourites holding forth for a clip retrospective and chat.\n\nLong-time Cineworks and Cinémathí¨que veteran Bill Evans, now the fest’s chief programmer, narrowed the final field down to just under 100 features and docs, homing in on a number of premieres from British Columbia. These include Bojan Bodruzic’s tough Immigrant; Vancouver Asian Film Festival founder Barbara K. Lee’s Between the Laughter; Carolyn Allain’s A Safer Sex Trade; Liam Walsh’s The Pipe Dream, about local snowboarders heading to the Turin Olympics; and Sisters, Douglas Buck’s retelling of the same-named Brian De Palma flick from 1973.\n\nInternational premieres include American D.B. Sweeney’s buddy flick Dirt Nap; the French thriller Them; a funky doc called Air Guitar Nation; and the appropriately named closing film, Snow Cake, a vehicle for Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman that opens in Vancouver around Christmas. And keep some aprí¨s-ski time free for Whistler Stories, a collection of locally commissioned short films.\n\nInformation on tickets, passes, and accommodation can be found at www.whistlerfilmfestival.com/.\n\n> Ken Eisner\n\nVancouver loves chicks flick\n\nAudiences at Fifth Avenue Cinemas have always liked their women strong. So says Festival Cinemas president Leonard Schein, whose theatre also reported the highest North American gross for Shut Up & Sing: The Dixie Chicks, a documentary about the Texan trio after their lead singer’s anti-Bush remarks. Playing four times a day on one screen to 4,000 people per week, Fifth Avenue raked in $45,000 in 10 days. In a phone interview, Schein pointed out that “we outgrossed Toronto, Montreal, or San Francisco, or places in the States that are also quite liberal and democratic, and we’re a much smaller population than any of those cities. So it is actually quite significant that a city the size of Vancouver has more people seeing that film than any theatre in New York or L.A.”\n\n> Craig Takeuchi\n\nAltman left unique legacy\n\nOne of the all-time great American directors, Robert Altman, died Monday (November 20) at a hospital in Los Angeles, of undisclosed causes. At 81, he had just seen his valedictory work, A Prairie Home Companion, receive critical praise barely five years after Gosford Park became his biggest commercial hit since the 1970s heyday of M*A*S*H, Nashville, and McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Ultimately, Altman will be remembered less for individual titles than for his loose-limbed yet literary style, with sharp dialogue delivered with densely overlapping musicality by a repertory stable of actors who adored him. According to a November 21 New York Times obituary, this made him the favourite “Bohemian uncle” to many independent directors working today.\n\n> Ken Eisner"
