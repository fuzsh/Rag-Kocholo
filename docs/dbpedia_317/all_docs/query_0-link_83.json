        "text": "Dr. Gregory Fahlman\n\nFew of us accomplish enough to have a minor planet named after us. Dr. Gregory Fahlman is one of those few. One of the most important figures in world astronomy, Dr. Fahlman has fostered excellence in all he has done, including leadership of Canada’s national laboratory for astronomy, now known as National Research Council Herzberg, Astronomy and Astrophysics Programs.\n\nHe has made significant achievements in scientific research, producing more than 140 refereed papers that have been cited more than 5,000 times by researchers worldwide. He has devoted nearly a decade to leading NRC-Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, with responsibility for six observatories, including two in British Columbia. During his time as Director General, the institute amassed an impressive array of accomplishments in astronomy.\n\nA leader in collaboration, Dr. Fahlman has played a major role in Canada’s participation in international projects such as the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope, the Gemini Observatory, the Atacama Large Millimetre Array and others. Strongly representing the interests of Canadian researchers, he has played a major part in making Canada a world leader in astrophysical research.\n\nDr. Fahlman has worked cooperatively with other countries and with leading companies such as B.C. high technology firms Profile Composites Inc., Dynamic Structures Limited and Altair Engineering Canada, among others. Contracts directly related to observatories in which the Canadian government has an interest have brought our province more than $56 million over the past two decades.\n\nThroughout his long career, almost all of it in British Columbia, Dr. Fahlman has distinguished himself as a scientist and a visionary scientific leader.\n\nLynda and Murray Farmer\n\nMurray and Lynda Farmer have enhanced British Columbia as a place to study, live, work and visit. With grace and generosity, they have set an example for community involvement as volunteers, philanthropists and leaders.\n\nCamosun College and the University of Victoria, in particular, have grown in capacity and status as a result of the Farmer’s leadership and service.\n\nMurray served on the UVic board of governors including a period as chair followed by two terms as university chancellor. Lynda served on the Camosun College Foundation and the college’s board of governors including as its chair.\n\nThe two established the Lynda and Murray Farmer Walk of Excellence to honour former UVic athletes and coaches. As co-chairs of the Camosun College Foundation Trademark of Excellence Fundraising Campaign — the largest capital fundraising campaign in the college’s history — the college’s Centre for Trades Education and Innovation was made possible.\n\nThe couple led the fundraising for the Shaw Centre for the Salish Sea. As well, Lynda assisted the community of Sidney in establishing the Mary Winspear Centre.\n\nThe Victoria Foundation has also benefitted from the Farmer’s leadership and philanthropy. Apart from helping to expand the foundation’s capacity by relocating to new offices and attracting new donors, the couple established a fund in their name that provides annual grants for community projects.\n\nCurrently, Murray serves as the Honourary Colonel, Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary’s) while Lynda is a Director on the provincial board of the BC Cancer Foundation.\n\nMurray began his career with Farmer Construction before forming Commercial Crane, the largest privately held crane rental business in the province. He has served as a governor of the Workers’ Compensation Board of B.C. and chair of the Canadian Construction Association. Lynda’s career focused on work within the not-for-profit sector.\n\nBrian Fehr\n\nBrian Fehr supports the growth rural B.C. economies and contributes to the sustainability and safety of the forest industry through his innovations in the industry, commitment to maintaining operations in the North, and boards he serves on.\n\nAlthough having only a Grade 12 education, he built a billion dollar group of companies — BID Group — that provides innovative technical systems and construction services for wood products industries in B.C., across Canada and into the United States and employs 400 in B.C. and 1400 more throughout North America.\n\nAs Fehr built his company, his personal and emotional commitment to the health and well-being of rural B.C. — and in particular Vanderhoof, Prince George, Salmon Arm and Canal Flats — remains strong. He is expanding manufacturing facilities in Vanderhoof, and is renovating a head office there. In Canal Flats, a community devastated by the rationalizing of the forest industry, Fehr has purchased a small steel fabrication business and he expects to employ 100 people at the facility within the next five years.\n\nAlways with an eye to innovation and through its subsidiary DelTech, the BID Group has developed biomass energy systems that lower energy costs and greenhouse emissions using wood waste that was formerly burned by the forest industry. Following the Babine and Lakeland sawmill explosions, Fehr developed a dust mitigation system that would not allow recurrence of these disasters and BID retrofitted all of the 15 Canfor sawmills with the system.\n\nHe foresaw the potential of artificial intelligence and the potential for machinery to make decisions that would improve productivity. His ‘profiling’ technology allows a log to be processed into lumber with a single pass, cutting labor costs. Auto grading, which uses computers to optimize the value of each piece of lumber by making decisions at a much higher production rate than manually grading lumber, has revolutionized the industry through minimizing loss in process, improvements in the value of finished products and cost reduction. His predictive maintenance processes for sawmills means equipment can be fixed before a breakdown occurs, increasing worker safety, and improving efficiency.\n\nFrom a young age, Fehr struggled with alcohol and drug addiction that threatened both his life and financial stability. At 37 he focused on his recovery, overcoming odds against him. He now gives others a second chance by hiring them. As well, he is a champion for the Baldy Hughes Therapeutic Community in Prince George and participates on the Northern Interior Health Board. Fehr served on the board of the BC Association for Crane Safety where he championed the need for better training and changes to WorkSafe regulations. He also served on the board of directors of the BC Safety Authority (now Technical Safety BC).\n\nSam L. Feldman\n\nSam Feldman might have lived anywhere. Born in Shanghai of Jewish parents whose ancestors had been persecuted in Russia, he and his family moved to the first place a visa was acceptable – Vancouver in the 1950s.\n\nThe Feldmans loved the peace they found in this sleepy Commonwealth outpost. Although young Sam Feldman experienced some degree of antisemitism growing up, this paled in comparison to the positive experience of growing up in Vancouver and the many life-long friends he made.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Vancouver’s entertainment scene was booming. It was very early in Feldman’s business career that he identified an opportunity and a desire to be part of that musical environment. He established himself by representing and booking musical artists for what became a launch pad for many iconic artists.\n\nFeldman continues to turn that humble start into an international juggernaut, primarily through artist representation by building an internationally known talent agency and management firm that has been responsible for more than 250 million records and countless tickets sold from past and present clients, such as Joni Mitchell, Sarah McLachlan, Diana Krall, Elvis Costello, James Taylor, Tracy Chapman, Bette Midler and Norah Jones. While the numbers are impressive, Feldman measures success through long-standing relationships and the positive musical influence his clients have brought to the community and beyond.\n\nAfter a staggering 50-plus years, Feldman’s involvement in various aspects of the entertainment business is still growing and his legacy is intact. Uniquely, at a time when Los Angeles, New York, and London were the epicentres of the music industry, he chose to stay in Vancouver. He has been quoted as saying: “I wouldn’t move elsewhere, as there is no better place than British Columbia to bring up your family.”\n\nContributing to the culture of this community and beyond is another part of Feldman’s legacy. From Expo 86 and the 2010 Olympics to countless sold-out stadiums, he’s brought some of the biggest musical acts in the world here to record and perform, and he’s sent some of B.C.’s biggest stars into the world. He’s proud to have contributed to the excellence of culture here, sharing values he learned from his mother, a high-level concert pianist, and his father, an amateur actor and salesman. His parents were a huge influence on him, and their mid-life immigrant status framed tough times. They urged him to work harder and shine brighter. Having watched their struggles, the lesson was not lost.\n\nIn an era when it was difficult for female artists to succeed, Feldman helped female clients through the headwinds, of what can only be characterized as a sexist industry, to access what their male counterparts were already achieving.\n\nHaving been born in Shanghai, China, in 1949, immigrating to Canada, with a Russian Jewish heritage and building an entertainment empire in a province most people had never visited, Feldman knew first-hand what it felt like to have to work twice as hard to succeed.\n\nTo be a successful music business entrepreneur, one must straddle the divide between art and commerce, and treat both with equal respect. Feldman is an interpreter – he has bridged those worlds. This is a skill set he has been able to bring to many good causes, using his connections and resources to support the revitalization of Chinatown, plus many health initiatives particularly targeted at youth.\n\nFeldman has been recognized repeatedly, garnering awards such as the Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award for extraordinary contributions to the Canadian music industry, and the SOCAN Special Achievement Award for contributions to Canada’s music industry and heritage. He has been inducted into the Music Managers Forum Honour Roll, the BC Entertainment Hall of Fame and the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame.\n\nFeldman is a huge believer in the positive change music can bring to people’s lives. It’s in the mission statement of his business and it’s key to his support of the Sarah McLachlan School of Music, Odd Squad Production Society, Zajac Ranch for Children, music therapy for children on the autism spectrum and many others.\n\nIt’s all part of giving back to the province he committed to so many years ago. Celebrity can be exciting, but it can also disappear overnight, unless you build a solid platform through exceptional relationships and hard work. Feldman has demonstrated that by building something honest and sustainable, you can literally change the world.\n\nLance S.G. Finch *\n\nOver three decades as a judge of B.C.’s two highest courts, including twelve years as Chief Justice of British Columbia, Lance Finch was a role model for how to be and do the difficult business of judging. His judicial decisions are admired for their thoughtfulness, lucidity and intellectual rigour and have influenced the Canadian legal landscape.\n\nHe was appointed to the B.C. Supreme Court in 1983, the year after the Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into force, and over his judicial career he consistently applied the Charter in a way that gave it full force and effect as a statement of Canada’s fundamental values. He is recognized for his decisions in the area of aboriginal rights and title in section 35 of the 1982 Constitution Act.\n\nDuring his term as Chief Justice, he spoke passionately and courageously on the legal system’s need to address with a sense of humility the narratives and laws of indigenous people. He was a forceful advocate for access to justice, which he sought to construe as an essential public service, akin to education and healthcare.\n\nHe was committed to court innovation and under his watch the Court of Appeal modernized its case tracking system that enhanced access to justice. He also developed the Memorandum of Understanding that outlines the responsibilities of the executive and judicial branches.\n\nHis contributions are recognized throughout Canada and internationally as he played a leading role on the Canadian Judicial Council that has a number of functions including dealing with allegations of judicial misconduct for which he had special responsibility. He was also president of the International Society for the Reform of Criminal Law.\n\nIn retirement, Lance Finch became one of three founding trustees of Pro Bono Canada, which supports programs that deliver free legal services annually to more than 36,000 low income Canadians.\n\nHe received honorary doctorate of laws from the University of British Columbia, Thompson Rivers University, and the University of Victoria.\n\nHonourable D. Ross Fitzpatrick\n\nRoss Fitzpatrick’s commitment to British Columbians is demonstrated in many ways: business leader, volunteer, and ten years as a member of the Canadian Senate.\n\nHis special concern for First Nations has benefited the Okanagan Nation economically, environmentally and spiritually.\n\nDuring his career, Mr. Fitzpatrick founded businesses in the aerospace, oil and gas, and mining industries. Business always meant caring for the environment. One of the mines he developed was recognized as a “model mine” by the U.S. Bureau of Lands and Management and it won various environmental awards.\n\nIn 1986, Mr. Fitzpatrick turned his attention to agriculture as he launched Cedar Creek Estate Winery and pioneered planting vinifera grapes to produce premium wines. He remains the proprietor of the winery and is Chairman of Greata Ranch.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2008, Mr. Fitzpatrick served in the Senate representing Okanagan-Similkameen.\n\nHis work helped provide federal funding for projects including infrastructure upgrades, women’s shelters, detox centres and airport expansion. He was key in reacquiring Spotted Lake, a healing ground for First Nations, as well as helping establish the first aboriginal winery.\n\nHe supported the Westbank First Nations Self Government Agreement and the First Nations Fiscal Agreement. He was involved in Senate committees and guiding a range of bills to benefit parks, small business and pension plans.\n\nHe has served on numerous boards and societies and has received awards such as the Confederation Medal, the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal, the Freedom of the Town of Oliver, the Freedom of the City of Kelowna, Westbank First Nation Recognition, and was named to the order of Canada.\n\nDavid Foster\n\nFrom a very early age, it became apparent that David Foster was going to make his mark on the music scene. This he has certainly done, with a long list of Grammy Awards and Academy Award nominations for his music and songs. In fact, there may be only four or five Canadians who have ever reached such international success and recognition in the music field.\n\nBorn in Victoria, David Foster progresses quickly from piano lessons at the age of five to a summer music scholarship at the University of Washington at the age of 13. At sixteen he was launched into his professional musical career in the backup band for rock ‘n roll legend Chuck Berry.\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles in 1971, he built a solid reputation as a musician, composer, arranger and producer whose talents were sought by a virtual who’s who of the music world.\n\nBut he is much more than a successful and respected international music giant. He has added even more lustre to his list of credits with the David Foster Foundation Society, giving generously of his time and talent to raise money to assist families of British Columbia children who require organ transplants. The Foundation has raised more than one and a half million dollars over the past seven years so that children won’t have to be alone through this traumatic time.\n\nIn recognition of his musical success and humanitarian efforts, David Foster received the Order of Canada, and was recently granted an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Victoria.\n\nDr. Jiri Frohlich *\n\nRecognized as the founder of modern preventative heart disease practices, Dr. Jiri Frohlich’s research and clinical work shaped contemporary medical thinking around the link between cholesterol and heart disease. As well, he led the creation of national guidelines for identification and treatment for inherited heart disease.\n\nAs former Professor of Pathology at UBC and Academic Director of the Healthy Heart Program at St. Pauls’ Hospital, he was the provincial opinion leader on the relationship between cholesterol and heart disease and was one of Canada's most influential and respected medical leaders.\n\nHe was among the first physicians in Canada to address the need for identification and treatment of inherited dyslipidemia — high blood fats including cholesterol and triglycerides — that is not the fault of lifestyle. He was the lead author on the first Canadian guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias commissioned by Health Canada in 1998.\n\nIn 1980, he established the Lipid Clinic in Western Canada, which specifically diagnosed and treated lipid and cholesterol disorders to prevent heart disease. The clinic, the largest of its kind in English Canada seeing several thousand patients visits a year, is now part of a broader prevention strategy since merging with the Healthy Heart Program. He then founded the Healthy Heart Society (HHS) of British Columbia, which supports all health care providers across the province working in the area of heart disease prevention.\n\nHe conducted over 200 clinical and basic science research studies to establish the cause of the diseases and strategies for treatment. He also investigated the safety and effectiveness of cholesterol lowering strategies including, diet, exercise, nutritional supplements and prescription drugs. He published hundreds of scholarly papers leaving a legacy where all British Columbians have access to evidence-based strategies for cholesterol management.\n\nDr. Frohlich’s list of awards and recognition includes the BC Heart and Stroke Foundation outstanding contribution award; the Ludwig Sherman Memorial Award; the Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists Research Excellence award; David Hardwick Lifetime Achievement award; and the BCMA Excellence in Health Improvement Award. Numerous times he has been awarded Distinguished Medical Scientist awards.\n\nLori Fung\n\nRhythmic gymnastics is a sport that requires an incredible degree of discipline and dedication.\n\nLori Fung began training in 1976 and the following year was already competing in the National Championships. Hearing that rhythmic gymnastics would be included in the 1984 Olympics, Lori took her grade 12 courses by correspondence and started training in earnest.\n\nShe became B.C. Provincial Champion in her class for the years 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980. She came first in national competition in 1982 and placed first in the Invitational Meet in Switzerland the following year and went on to become seven-time Canadian Grand National Champion.\n\nShe capped her brilliant career with the distinction of winning the first Gold Medal ever in rhythmic gymnastics at the 1984 Olympic Games.\n\nToday, Lori is a world-class coach in rhythmic gymnastics at UBC with a reputation for excellence and extraordinary effort and enthusiasm. She acts as a role model for all young women and has the ability to instill in her students a desire to excel. This has been borne out by the national team members emerging from her classes.\n\nShe has brought credit to the Province through her live performances for visiting dignitaries including Pope John Paqul II and Their Royal Highnesses, the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n\nLori extends her hard work and determination to the community where she actively promotes fitness through TV, radio and personal guest appearances. She is currently honorary Chairperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.\n\nJohn Furlong\n\nJohn Furlong is one of Canada’s most influential sport leaders and was most recently the face of the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (VANOC).\n\nAs CEO of VANOC, Mr. Furlong was the team leader who organized and delivered the Olympic Games to positive reviews the world over.\n\nPrior to his appointment at VANOC, Mr. Furlong was the President and Chief Operating Officer for the Vancouver 2010 Bid. In this role, he became the Bid’s international voice, tirelessly clocking more than 1.2 million miles in his travels to promote Vancouver’s candidacy.\n\nMr. Furlong, a long time member of the Canadian Olympic Committee, has been involved in athletics all of his life, having competed at the international level in basketball, European handball and squash. He became Canadian Squash Champion in his age group in 1986.\n\nMr. Furlong has also led many high profile sports organizations in Canada and has served as the Chair of the B.C. Summer and Winter Games, and Sport B.C.\n\nIn 2009 Mr. Furlong was named Canada’s Most Influential Sport Figure by both the Globe and Mail and the CBC. Most recently Mr. Furlong was named B.C.’s Sportsman of the Decade.\n\nMr. Furlong has been awarded honorary doctorate degrees from UBC, the Justice Institute, and BCIT.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Furlong was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada, for his contributions to the planning and realization of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.\n\nGordon J. Fyfe\n\nGordon Fyfe is an exceptional leader who has been recognized globally for his efforts in combating financial fraud, his advocacy for environmental, social and governance issues, and his outstanding achievements as CEO of the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI).\n\nAs CEO of BCI, Fyfe has achieved extraordinary results by transforming the organization into a highly respected and successful industry player. Its investments have increased from $112 billion to $235 billion, resulting in significant returns that have been beneficial for B.C. residents. Investments for which Fyfe is accountable provide 75 cents of every dollar in public-sector pensions.\n\nAs the CEO of BCI during the COVID-19 pandemic, Fyfe faced significant challenges in navigating the financial markets amid a global health and financial crisis. His decisive leadership and sound decision-making enabled BCI to weather the storm and maintain a strong financial standing.\n\nDespite his achievements, Fyfe does not seek personal attention. He remains humble. His experiences growing up working on farms and in sawmills ensure that pensioners are protected today. Fyfe’s life was affected greatly by the loss of his father’s pension in the Eaton’s bankruptcy. Witnessing his parents struggle with financial insecurity and dependence in their later years motivated him to dedicate his life to preventing other families from facing the same traumatic experience.\n\nFyfe had been a global banker and private asset manager when he chose to enter the public service in Canada. He had served as the CEO of the federal Public Sector Pension Investment Board and also held a leadership role at Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec before returning to his hometown of Victoria. Throughout his extensive 35-year career in finance and investment, he has successfully managed assets worth over half a trillion dollars.\n\nFyfe has been tireless in his efforts to promote ethical practices in the financial industry, and to hold those who engage in fraudulent activities accountable for their actions. He has been instrumental in fostering a culture of transparency and accountability within the investment management community and has worked tirelessly to ensure that B.C. residents can trust in the integrity of the financial-services sector.\n\nFyfe has been a passionate advocate for environmental, social and governance issues, recognizing that healthy communities depend on healthy ecosystems, and that both must be preserved if we are to thrive as a society. He has taken a leading role in promoting sustainable investing strategies that prioritize diversity, gender equality, Indigenous reconciliation and responsible practices across a range of industries. He has ensured that the investment decisions made by BCI reflect the values of the people of the province.\n\nBCI was among the first Canadian institutional investors to sign the United-Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment. Fyfe has led an impressive initiative that offers opportunities for Indigenous youth to acquire expertise in finance and asset management to help equip them to independently and successfully handle funds generated through economic reconciliation. With Vancouver Island University, BCI has established a program that provides scholarships, work experience and education in financial literacy, with more educational institutions to come.\n\nFyfe has overseen an investor group managing $7.3 trillion worth of assets that encourages companies to achieve a gender-diverse workforce by including underrepresented communities, including Black, Indigenous and other visible minorities, individuals with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ2S+ community in leadership and governance roles.\n\nFyfe has established BCI as an internationally respected investment powerhouse with successful partnerships established around the world. He has made B.C. competitive with the BlackRocks of the world, all while keeping his B.C. values. He has transformed BCI into an in-house asset manager, increasing control of the assets for which he is responsible and reducing fees paid to outside managers, thereby increasing the share of returns for pensioners.\n\nHis astute vision has grown BCI to three international offices, 750 employees and established one of the world’s largest real-estate companies (QuadReal), all looking after 750,000 pension-plan members.\n\nPaul George\n\nOver the course of 40 years Paul George has helped to steward a contemporary view of British Columbia beyond a province of just resource extraction with the creation of the Western Canada Wilderness Committee.\n\nGeorge, a Vietnam war objector, immigrated to Canada from the U.S. in 1968 to teach senior high school sciences, drawn to B.C. by the magnificent images of its wilderness. Work, research and friendship in Haida Gwaii led Paul to collaborate with Haida leader Guujaaw and others in order to protect Gwaii Haanas (South Moresby), today a Haida Heritage Site and National Park Reserve.\n\nIn 1980, George founded Western Canada Wilderness Committee (Wilderness Committee) with a group of friends. Under his leadership the organization grew to over 100,000 members with donors across Canada.\n\nIn 1983, George helped to found North America’s first Green Party, the Green Party of B.C.\n\nFrom 1980 to 2005, George led dozens of campaigns building public support for wilderness protection. He left WCWC after writing his seminal book about the organization, its campaigns and tactics: “Big Trees not Big Stumps.”\n\nThrough education and facts, with beautiful images of endangered wild places alongside graphic images of large-scale clear-cut logging, George helped shape an era of public focus on wilderness protection, laying the bedrock for political decisions to protect more of British Columbia’s magnificent natural heritage.\n\nAn inspirational leader, George came up with ideas for unique campaigns, tactics and strategies that no other environmental group had used including widely distributed educational newspapers, and building the world’s first upper canopy temperate rainforest research station.\n\nGeorge co-authored over 120 newspapers, each with a call to action on a specific wilderness area or wildlife cause and often in collaboration with local conservation groups. The largest run, “Conservation Vision for Vancouver Island,” saw over 300,000 distributed to households in every community on Vancouver Island. Featuring a scientific analysis recommending half the Island’s remaining wilderness be protected in order to save biodiversity, the paper prompted loggers to chant “12 percent and no more” in a protest on the lawns of the legislature.\n\nGeorge also launched the trail-building that became a renowned WCWC activity, involving hundreds of volunteers. He believed that enabling people to see beautiful places under threat was essential to building support for their protection.\n\nWorking with First Nations, George campaigned collaboratively with the Haida, Nemiah, Nuu-chah- nulth, and Squamish Nations to declare several Tribal Parks founded in Indigenous rights and title. He also pushed the boundaries of law, winning cases that established the right of an environmental group to represent wildlife in B.C. court (re: the B.C. wolf kill) and the right of public access to Crown land under tree farm license (Carmanah Valley). Some of the successful campaigns George worked on included South Moresby (Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve), Stein Valley, Carmanah Valley, Meares Island, Clayoquot Sound, and Stoltmann Wilderness (Elaho Valley).\n\nOver 25 years, his tireless work resulted in the park protection of millions of hectares of wilderness areas and a lasting legacy for all British Columbians.\n\nLeila Getz\n\nLeila Getz had a dream-to present outstanding musicians in recitals for Vancouver music lovers. In 1980, she brought that dream to life when she founded the Vancouver Recital Society. Her vision and leadership have established the Society as one of North America’s most respected classical music organizations and its concerts are sought-after platforms for presenting new talent. As artistic director, she has been instrumental in launching the careers of numerous emerging local and international artists, and brought renowned artists to Vancouver from around the world.\n\nIn 1986, she established the successful Summer Chamber Music Festival, showcasing the finest and most promising young musicians from Canada and abroad. The Festival has commissioned new works, held workshops for young musicians, and has reached out to the community with free concerts. One of her brainwaves was a summer “Musical Instrument Petting Zoo”, where with a gathering of the festival’s musicians, children can touch, feel, blow into, strum and familiarize themselves with the instruments. This proved to be a huge success, and led to innumerable demands for music lessons.\n\nMs. Getz has served on the juries of the national finals of the Canadian Music Competitions, the Canada Council, the Ontario Arts Council, the nominating committee for the Governor General’s Performing Arts Awards, and is a member of the International Council for the Esther Honens International Piano Competition.\n\nMs. Getz received an Achievement Award from the State of Israel Bonds in Vancouver; the Canadian Arts Presenters’ Association Award in Toronto; and the International Association of Performing Arts Presenters’ Harold Shaw Award in New York. She received the YWCA Woman of Distinction Award for Arts and Culture, a Canada 125th Anniversary Medal, and a Golden Jubilee Medal.\n\nIn 1994, Leila Getz was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada.\n\nAnne Giardini\n\nAnne Giardini is a celebrated B.C. business leader, board director, lawyer, community advocate and internationally-published writer who had a distinguished career for two decades with the Canadian subsidiary of one of the world’s largest international forest products companies, Weyerhaeuser. Six of those years she was Canadian president after serving as Canadian General Counsel.\n\nA thoughtful leader, Giardini provided strategic advice and direction for the Canadian operations of Weyerhaeuser, led acquisitions and divestitures across Canada, the US and Mexico, developed lasting relations with Indigenous groups, ensured safety and sustainability, and oversaw international ethics matters.\n\nShe has blazed a trail for women in business, law and board directorship, exceling in her roles, inspiring other women to follow, and — as a person of influence in so many fields — demonstrating that one not need limit one’s interests, nor be limited by one’s gender. She served on The Law Society of British Columbia’s retention of women task force, federal advisory council for promoting women on boards, and chaired the YWCA Women of Distinction Awards. She has also been the manager of a Thunderbird minor hockey team.\n\nShe serves or has served on the boards of numerous organizations including: CMHC, TransLink, World Wildlife Fund-Canada; Nevsun Resources; Vancouver International Writers and Readers Festival; Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, where she is immediate past chair; BC Council of Forest Industries; SFI; Forest Products Association of Canada, where she chaired the Aboriginal relations committee; PEN Canada; Writers Trust of Canada, and BC Achievement. She is the 11th chancellor of Simon Fraser University and serves on its board of governors.\n\nShe is the author of two acclaimed novels, The Sad Truth about Happiness and Advice for Italian Boys, and a collection of her mother’s writing advice, Startle and Illuminate.\n\nEvanna Brennan * and Susan Giles\n\nEvanna Brennan, RN, and Susan Giles, RN, have provided life-saving care to people living with HIV/AIDS and other significant health issues in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside for more than 40 years.\n\nThey took action at the beginning of the HIV epidemic. Similarly, they reacted quickly to the drug and overdose crisis as it developed into what it is today. Throughout it all, they have remained stalwart pillars of advocacy, care and compassion for Vancouver’s most vulnerable population. They have provided crucial assessment, medication and wound care while helping connect patients to the health-care system. They are exceptionally dedicated to their work, having continued past their 2012 retirement from Vancouver Coastal Health, through the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic and Brennan surviving cancer.\n\nAt 76 and 70 years old, respectively, Brennan and Giles continue to work regularly, plunging into chaotic and sometimes dangerous situations to provide vital care. Their two-nurse-visit approach bolsters them and allows them to combine their expertise to provide effective patient care.\n\nGenerously, they have shared their knowledge and experience, contributing significantly to nursing education in B.C., Canada and beyond. They have taught nursing students from Canada, the U.S., Europe and Asia. They have presented at national and international conferences, such as the International Conference on HIV/AIDS, Canadian HIV/AIDS Skills Building, Canadian Palliative Care and the American Association of Nurses in AIDS Care. They are long-standing members of the Canadian Association of Nurses in HIV/AIDS Care (CANAC) and have presented repeatedly at their own professional conferences.\n\nIn 1999, they were co-recipients of CANAC’s Jill Sullivan Award of Excellence in HIV/AIDS Nursing and later the Award of Distinction in Nursing. A recent award-winning documentary about their approach to nursing, titled Angels on Call, has been presented at professional conferences. It is available online.\n\nBrennan and Giles have used their extensive experience to develop an innovative model for nursing called Action-Based Care, or ABC, which is a holistic, relationship-based approach to nursing that emphasizes flexibility. That is being able to adjust and respond quickly to situations. If the person’s immediate need is not met, there is little chance of them allowing any health intervention. ABC also incorporated harm-reduction by name a decade before its application became common practice.\n\nABC is designed to create access to care and meet patients “where they are at.” They build close, long-lasting patient relationships, making a point to respect patient autonomy and provide non-judgmental care; what works for the patient comes first, above all.\n\nTheir innovations include:\n\nearly use of their own cellphones to connect with patients;\n\nproviding real-world experience for student nurses;\n\nproviding pop-up clinics at various shelters and drop-in centres, that they called “Clinic in a Corner;” and\n\ndeveloping channels of communication with hospitals and community groups.\n\nBrennan and Giles have saved countless lives by providing life-saving medications, such as antiretrovirals and wound care to those who otherwise would have fallen through the cracks of the health-care system.\n\nThey have touched and enriched the lives of B.C.’s most vulnerable citizens and have consistently shared their four decades of accumulated front-line knowledge with other health-care professionals. Brennan and Giles have achieved outstanding excellence in their field and greatly benefited the people of B.C. They are exemplars of compassion, kindness, dedication, determination, education, innovation and advocacy.\n\nByng Giraud\n\nByng Giraud is an aggressive advocate for economic reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.\n\nHe believes that economic development can raise all people and thereby can help ensure that Indigenous Peoples experience the same health, education and economic outcomes as other British Columbians. He is not afraid to challenge existing rules or orthodoxies. For example, working with Squamish Nation, together they changed the landscape of Indigenous-led environmental assessment, something not allowed in law until 2018. Giraud said: “Don’t tell me we can't do it. That makes me want to make the change even more.” Today, he is focused on supporting the financial tools Indigenous Peoples need to own and lead major projects within their lands.\n\nThe origins of Giraud’s support for Indigenous advocacy date back to his younger years. While working as a labourer in the Peace River area, a prejudiced supervisor intentionally excluded an Indigenous co-worker from being given a ride back to the camp. Giraud chose not to abandon the co-worker and opted to walk alongside him the lengthy distance back to camp. He's been walking the reconciliation path ever since. Today, he works closely with Indigenous communities to assist them in taking full advantage of economic opportunities in their lands. Through his leadership, Byng has facilitated more than $1 billion in economic partnerships for First Nations to leverage their assets.\n\nThe ground-breaking economic reconciliation initiatives Giraud has participated in include negotiating and helping the Squamish Nation implement the first-ever Indigenous-led environmental assessment process in Canada. That process, led by Squamish Nation, directly resulted in federal and provincial legislative changes allowing Indigenous-led environmental assessments. He was also active in creating and negotiating the first agreements between First Nations and operating mines in B.C, including agreements with five Nations at two separate projects. Prior to this, no operating metal mine had economic agreements with Indigenous communities. Today, almost every operating or new mine in B.C. has an economic agreement with affected Indigenous communities.\n\nHe has led the Indigenous consultation processes that reopened the Huckleberry Mine in northern B.C. after years of conflict with local First Nations. This turned conflict into partnership.\n\nHe also led the Northwest Powerline Coalition of Indigenous groups and companies that successfully lobbied the Province to build the Northwest Transmission line along Highway 37, bringing electricity to the remote Tahltan Nation communities. This is one of the first times in B.C. that Indigenous communities joined industry to lobby for collectively needed infrastructure.\n\nWhile on the board of Ridley Terminals, Giraud worked with the then-chair and partnered with board member Gitxsan Hereditary Chief Elmer Derrick to bring the first economic agreement between local First Nations and the terminal. He served as a founding member of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations-BC Business Council Champions Table, a committee dedicated to practical projects to advance economic reconciliation in B.C.\n\nGiraud worked with a coalition of more than 30 First Nation communities on purchasing a major pipeline. He acted as an adviser to the 130-member-plus First Nations Major Project Coalition - an organization dedicated to enabling Indigenous equity participation in major projects.\n\nGiraud’s contributions have not been limited to economic reconciliation. He actively supports Indigenous cultural and sporting initiatives because actions speak louder than words. This has included raising thousands of dollars for various Indigenous organizations in B.C\n\nRusty Goepel\n\nBusiness trailblazer and respected community leader Ruston (Rusty) Goepel has made lasting contributions to British Columbia’s economic growth and social prosperity. With family roots in B.C. extending more than a century, Goepel’s dedication to his home province can be seen across five decades of work: in a successful investment career bringing employment and prosperity to people and businesses locally and nationwide; through his key leadership role in the 2010 Winter Olympics; and in his enduring support for many community causes that improve the lives of British Columbians.\n\nGoepel co-founded Goepel Shields & Partners in 1989, bucking traditional business models to create an independent institutional brokerage where all employees shared in company profits. Starting with a staff of 18, Goepel Shields & Partners grew quickly throughout B.C., Alberta and Ontario under Goepel’s leadership. A 1996 merger with a retail-based broker created Goepel McDermid, a full-service investment brokerage with 500 employees. In 2000, the company completed a $130-million transaction with Raymond James Financial to form Raymond James Canada. Today, it is the largest independent investment dealer in the country, employing 700 people in B.C. and more than 1,600 staff nationwide.\n\nGoepel’s business acumen has also helped other B.C.-based companies flourish. He serves as chair of Vancouver-based Yellow Point Equity Partners, which has raised $320 million and currently holds a controlling interest in seven B.C.-based companies that employ more than 3,700 people. He has also served on numerous corporate and public boards, including the Business Council of B.C. and Vancouver Airport Authority.\n\nA lifelong passion for volunteerism and sport attracted Goepel as a central player in the 2010 Olympic Games. First joining the Olympic bid corporation in 1998 as a director, Goepel was later appointed to the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC) Board. There, he was intimately involved in key planning and decision-making around the Games, from hiring CEO John Furlong to budgetary oversight. Following the passing of founding chair Jack Poole in 2009, Goepel was elected by his fellow directors as new chair to deliver the games to the world. He continued to serve until VANOC’s dissolution in 2013.\n\nGoepel is a tireless community champion.

Volunteering under the auxiliary flag, he has assisted in the rescue of hundreds of vessels either in distress or disabled.\n\nIn 1988 Horton began volunteering with the Canadian Lifeboat Institutes’ Search and Rescue service (SAR) – a not-for-profit registered charity that provides non-government supported search and rescue assistance in the Lower Fraser River and Gulf of Georgia waters. From its base in Steveston, Horton has trained volunteers to be competent crew members. As well he has devoted thousands of hours and his own money to maintain its 52’ Delta Lifeboat, formerly the Steveston Lifeboat. Its safety role to the fishing fleet in the Gulf of Georgia and Fraser Estuary cannot be over-estimated; to date almost 900 incidents have been attended by Horton aboard the Lifeboat.\n\nIn recognition of his marine art he is the only Canadian artist mentioned in the late Dennis Brook-Hart’s definitive book, “Twentieth Century Marine Painting.” He is a founding member of the Canadian Society of Marine Artists and member of the Federation of Canadian Artists, the Naval Officers Association of B.C. and the Honourable Company of Master Mariners. Through his art, he has supported many schools, museums, hospitals and community-based charities.\n\nPaul Frederick Howard\n\nBy leading the first team in the world to use fuel cells to power a zero-emission vehicle, Paul Howard has brought distinction to himself and to his province.\n\nThe people at Ballard Power Systems knew they had the technology to revolutionize the energy world. They had made significant advances in fuel cell power density, efficiency and cost but no one was listening to this small, unknown company. To catch the attention of the public and of investors, they decided to leapfrog from a small demonstration model to a 125 horsepower fuel cell to power a nine-meter long transit bus.\n\nHundreds of people worked on the project, but Paul Howard was the key figure whose determination, detailed engineering excellence and perseverance made the operating nine-meter bus a reality. The project was completed on time and on budget in spite of skepticism from many experts. The design has been tested by B.C. Transit and the Chicago Transit Authority on city transit routes.\n\nIn 1996 Paul Howard received the meritorious achievement award from the Association of Professional Engineers of B.C. for his leadership and significant contributions to the development of an environmentally clean power generation alternative for the transportation industry. This remarkable engineering feat with the potential to clean up inner-city air pollution has allowed Ballard Power Systems to become the dominant company it is today.\n\nDr. Edward John Hughes *\n\nDr. Edward Hughes was a master painter and legendary artist renowned for his depictions of British Columbia’s landscapes. His distinguished career spanned over seven decades, and his work defined the look of B.C.’s landscapes in art.\n\nDr. Hughes’ earlier canvases caught the attention of members of the Group of Seven, and he was the first recipient of an Emily Carr Fellowship, which allowed him to explore the province and make the sketches that would later serve as a source for his acclaimed paintings.\n\nIn addition to this, Dr. Hughes served in the Second World War as a gunner and an Official War Artist. His work contributed greatly to the documentation and depiction of those who served in the armed forces at that time, and now hangs in the Canadian War Museum.\n\nDr. Hughes’ paintings represent a visual history of the province, and effectively capture the essence of west coast life.

Richard Hunt began carving with his father at the age of 13.\n\nIn 1973, he began work at the British Columbia Provincial Museum in Victoria as an apprentice carver under his father. The following year he assumed the duties of chief carver in the Thunderbird Park carving program. He remained at the museum in that capacity for 12 years. In December 1986, Mr. Hunt resigned this position and began a new career as a freelance artist.\n\nRichard Hunt has played a leading role in the renaissance of Northwest Indian art. It is a rebirth that has spread throughout North America and influenced indigenous art around the world. A master carver, experienced ritualist and dancer, Richard Hunt has created a diverse body of art that contributes much to the preservation and perpetuation of Kwa-gulth culture and traditions. His totems, prints, drums, masks and bowls are the pride of museums and private collections around the world. He has also communicated his art and culture, in talks to students, from preschool to university level, and museum visitors who watched over the years as he worked.\n\nOutside Canada, Richard Hunt has been an effective ambassador for native people, for British Columbia and Canada. Richard Hunt’s Indian name – ‘Gwe-la-yo-gwe-la-gya-les’ – means ‘a man that travels around the world giving’. Through his art, Richard Hunt has indeed given much.\n\nHe is a man possessed of enormous reserves of energy and has dedicated his creative talents towards furthering the cultural ambitions of the Kwa-gulth people.\n\nChief Tony Hunt (Nakapnkim) *\n\nChief Tony Hunt was hereditary chief of the KwaGulth people and was one of the greatest native artists of the Pacific Northwest. He was fluent in his native Kwak’wala language, which was taught to him by his grandfather, legendary artist Chief Mungo Martin.\n\nChief Hunt created Thunderbird Park with his father, Chief Henry Hunt, and his grandfather. Chief Tony Hunt also designed the Hunt Family Big House in the Royal B.C. Museum, which is a showpiece for the world and a place of pride for his people.\n\nHis grand masterpiece is the KwaGulth ceremonial Big House at Fort Rupert – the largest traditional native structure ever built in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nChief Hunt has designed nearly 100 full-scale totem poles – more than any First Nation artist. Many of his works are celebrated monuments in countries around the world. Victoria’s sister cities Morioka, Japan and Souchow, China, both have poles carved by him as gifts from the people of Victoria. He also has works of art in international museums and in the Canadian Embassy in Mexico City and the former Canadian Embassy in Bonn.\n\nAmong the many honours awarded to Chief Hunt outside his traditional culture are an Honorary Doctorate of Law from Royal Roads University and Citation of Merit from the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.\n\nChief Hunt was presented to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II and gave her three works of art.\n\nMost recently Chief Hunt worked with The Honourable Steven L. Point, OBC, Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, on two canoe projects. The first was the river going canoe “Shxwtitosel”, which was given by His Honour to the Province of B.C. The second canoe, “the Salish Seas”, was given by His Honour to the Canadian Navy.\n\nVicky Husband\n\nVicky Husband is a passionate defender of British Columbia’s natural heritage, especially the coastal rainforest and its inhabitants.\n\nThrough her volunteer effort over the past 20 years, she has become for many the outspoken voice of environmental reason — speaking straight to the point with courage and determination, fueled both the science and by personal knowledge of the salmon, trees, bears, people and places of our province.\n\nIn the decade-long campaigns to protect Gwaii Haanas/South Moresby, the Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary, the Carmanah Valley and Clayoquot Sound. Vicky has worked along side of others, and irreplaceable source of inspiration and support for her colleagues, a tireless champion for biodiversity and natural places in the halls of government, school gymnasiums and the daily news.\n\nShe can also go it alone if need be, and the Tahsish, Kwois and Silburn, the Nasparti, the Power and the Battle watersheds on the northwest coast of Vancouver Island are protected today largely because Vicky Husband made them her personal campaigns.\n\nShe blends equal measures of respect for scientific knowledge and the understanding of First Nations, and pioneered the use of satellite imagery for helping others see for themselves how much ancient rainforest has been logged and how little remains.\n\nVicky Husband is a leader in this generation’s commitment and responsibility to ensure a natural legacy for those to come."
