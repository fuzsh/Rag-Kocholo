        "text": "The list of movies and TV shows filmed around Vancouver is a long one.\n\nFilm sets and actors are so commonplace in the city that there is even a free Hollywood North exhibit with Superman's suit. Some Vancouverites may even recognize certain iconic Vancouver landmarks in films and shows.\n\nAs for Halloween thrillers, slashers, and horror movies, there are plenty filmed around Metro Vancouver that slide Surrey, Langley, Maple Ridge and other locations in the region, but this list is all about what was shot in the city of Vancouver itself.\n\nScary Movie\n\nThis lighthearted Halloween slasher movie parody filmed some of its scenes at the Vancouver Technical Secondary School (the same filming location seen in Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Air Bud, Batwoman and many more).\n\nHalloween: Resurrection\n\nThose watching this classic Halloween movie may spot the 2400 Court Motel at 2400 Kingsway during the movie's motel scenes. The real store MacGillycuddy's at 4881 Mackenzie St was transformed into fictional store The Richest Rags in the movie.\n\nFriday the 13th: Jason Takes Manhattan\n\nBack in 1989 this movie's producers had a limited budget of around $5 million, so they decided to film most of it here in order to stretch that out. In the flick, Jason Vorhees took the SkyTrain, where he proceeded to wreak havoc.\n\nFreddy vs Jason\n\nSeveral scenes from this movie were filmed in Vancouver's Kerrisdale neighbourhood, including Lori's house at 3258 W 36th Ave, Blake's house at 2170 W 35th Ave, Mark's house at 1615 McBride St, and other scenes at Kerrisdale Elementary School.\n\nFinal Destination\n\nFour movies of the Final Destination movie series filmed in Vancouver. In the first movie it was Tod's house at 1312 Balfour Ave, Alex's house at 4688 Connaught Dr, and Kerrisdale Elementary School.\n\nThe second movie involved a scene filmed at the Plaza of Nations (760 Pacific Blvd) in False Creek.\n\nThe third movie filmed scenes at Vancouver College at 5400 Cartier St and at Playland.\n\nThe fifth Final Destination movie filmed the bridge collapse scene at Lions Gate Bridge, transformed The Fish Shack at 1026 Granville St into Le Cafe Miro 81, filmed gymnastic practice scenes at the Thunderbird Winter Sports Centre at UBC, and turned Alexander Gastown at 91 Powell Street into Ming Yun Spa.\n\nIt (1990)\n\nThe TV mini series included many Vancouver filming locations:\n\nYoung Beverly Marsh's house at 417 Heatley Ave\n\nBridge and creek scenes at Pipeline Road and Ravine Trail\n\nAdult Ben's loft at 505 Railway St\n\nBeverly's Chicago apartment exterior at 411 Dunsmuir St\n\nEddie's house in Great Neck at 2328 SW Marine Rd\n\nPenn Station at Pacific Central Station - 1150 Station St\n\nMike's house at 1171 Keefer St\n\nDerry Community Library interior at The Cambrian Hall - 215 E 17th Ave\n\nAdmiral Seymour Elementary at 1130 Keefer St\n\nThe Cabin in The Woods\n\nThis horror movie was filmed mainly in the woods (which are actually the Coquihalla Canyon Provincial Park) but Dana's apartment is located in Vancouver at 2605 West 5th Avenue.\n\nThe Changeling\n\nThose watching this movie may catch a glimpse of Vancouver's Orpheum Theatre and Hotel Europe (43 Powell Street) in some scenes.\n\nThe Exorcism of Emily Rose\n\nTwo UBC buildings make an appearance in this movie: the D Block of the Buchanan Building and the MacMillan Building which are both at the Robson Square campus.\n\nJennifer's Body\n\nThe teen horror cult classic used the gymnasium and building exterior of Norma Rose Point School (the former University Hill Secondary School) on Vancouver's University Endowment Lands as Devil's Kettle High School, remodelled the gym and locker rooms at Vancouver Technical Secondary for filming, and filmed scenes of the band at a hotel at The Sutton Place Hotel in downtown Vancouver.\n\nValentine\n\nThe 2001 slasher film has only one filming location in Vancouver at a Spanish Colonial Revival-style mansion named Rio Vista at 2170 SW Marine Dr. This location has seen many other films and shows, including Fifty Shades of Grey, Charmed, iZombie, and Supernatural.\n\nThe Butterfly Effect\n\nThis well-known movie filmed in Vancouver's downtown and Gastown neighbourhoods, plus around UBC's Vancouver and Robson Square campuses:\n\nBar scene at Blarney Stone Pub - 216 Carrall St\n\nMovie theatre scenes at Granville Cineplex Odeon\n\nSeveral scenes at UBC's Robson Square Campus:\n\nThe \"want a granola bar?\" scene at Koerner Plaza\n\nLecture hall scenes in Room 100 of the Geography Building\n\nUniversity campus scenes around the campus\n\nUBC Vancouver campus filming locations:\n\nMartha Piper Plaza as University path\n\nFormer building as University Quad\n\nChemistry building as Sorority exterior\n\nWalter C. Koerner Library as University plaza\n\nUBC Rose Garden for Kayleigh's wedding\n\nWith a file from Bob Kronbauer"
