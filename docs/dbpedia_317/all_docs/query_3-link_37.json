        "text": "\"Point me!\"\n\nThis article is about the magical creature. You may be looking for the Ilvermorny house.\n\nThe Thunderbird was a large, magical avian beast native to North America, and most commonly found in Arizona in the southwestern United States.[1][2] A close relative of the phoenix,[2] the Thunderbird could create storms as it flew and was highly sensitive to danger. A House at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was named after this creature.[3]\n\nDescription[]\n\nThe Thunderbird was described as having a head that was \"similar to that of an eagle\"; or, in the wizarding world, \"similar to that of a Hippogriff\". They possessed three pairs of powerful wings, and had feathers that shimmered with cloud-like patterns.[1]\n\nThe Thunderbird was known to change colours as it summoned storms, its iridescent feathers shifting from various shades of gold to electrifying blue, to grey and silver, to white, and even to deep navy.\n\nThe Thunderbird could also sense danger and created storms as it flied.\n\nUses[]\n\nThunderbird tail feathers could be used as wand cores, with this type of wand being difficult to master, but powerful and skilled with transfiguration. They were also able to sense danger, much like their donors, and were able to cast curses on their own.\n\nThunderbird feathers could also be used as quills, although this was very uncommon.[4]\n\nHistory[]\n\nShikoba Wolfe, who was of Choctaw descent, was primarily famous for intricately carved wands containing Thunderbird tail feathers. Wolfe wands were generally held to be extremely powerful, though difficult to master. They were particularly prized by Transfigurers.[5]\n\nAround 1926, Albus Dumbledore told Newt Scamander about a Thunderbird captured by traffickers in Egypt. Newt rescued the bird, named him Frank, and travelled to America, intending to return him to his natural habitat in Arizona.[1] He arrived in New York City via a Muggle transatlantic passenger ship, hoping to avoid the attention of the MACUSA, due to then current laws on private possession of Magical Creature.\n\nDue to a large number of magical occurrences in New York City during Scamander's visit, culminating in the Obscurial attack on New York, he released Frank over the city, using the Thunderbird's weather related powers to create a large rainstorm laced with Swooping Evil venom. The diluted venom helped obliviate the population, allowing the MACUSA agents to more easily cover up the major potential Statute of Secrecy breach.\n\nAfter his release, Frank flew under his own power and ultimately made it to Arizona.[6]\n\nIn late 1927, Madam Seraphina Picquery, then-president of MACUSA, declared the Thunderbird a protected species, a protection that was later extended to all North American magical creatures.\n\nIn the 1980s or early 1990s, a troubled Thunderbird caused disruptions around Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1990–1991 school year. Hogwarts gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid and seventh year student Jacob's sibling were assisted by Holly Blackbird in calming down the agitated Thunderbird, who was being harassed by wizard and con artist Todd Cribb, who was placed under arrest after being defeated by Jacob's sibling in a brief duel.[7]\n\nSeveral Thunderbirds lived in Luna Scamander's suitcase. When Luna came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 2010–2011 school year to assist Rubeus Hagrid in the investigation of the mysterious infestation of baby Manticores within the school grounds, she accidentally let the Thunderbirds out the suitcase. One of them caught a cold and created a local thunderstorm above Hagrid's Hut.[8]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the late 2010s or early 2020s, Luna took a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force into the field to learn how to detect, catch, and befriend Thunderbirds, teaching them how to control their mind when vulnerable.[9]\n\nKnown Thunderbirds[]\n\nThunderbirds Notes Frank The Thunderbird that Newt Scamander rescued from traffickers in Egypt.

It is especially prominent within the cultures of the Pacific Northwest and is frequently featured in their art, songs, and stories. Versions of the Thunderbird are also found in the traditions of peoples of the American Southwest, Great Lakes, and Great Plains regions of the continent. Accounts of the Thunderbird and its characteristics vary, but it is often described as a very large bird, capable of generating storms and thunder as it flies.[10]\n\nBased on concept art in The Case of Beasts: Explore the Film Wizardry of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and pop art commissioned from artist Andy Singleton forPottermore, the Thunderbird may have different colour variations within the species. Based on similar birds of prey, such as the Bald Eagle, the Thunderbird may also have sexual dimorphism between males and females. The standard sexual dimorphism noted in Bald Eagles is that females tend to be about 25% larger than males.\n\nBased on historical accounts, and the widespread tales of large birds/\"Thunderbirds\" in Native American lore and mythology, the range of the Thunderbird once may have extended across the continental United States. In the folklore of the Penobscot and Abenaki tribes of Maine, there exists a legendary bird named \"Pamola\" (meaning \"he curses on the mountain\"), who was likely a Thunderbird. He was said to be a spirit that lived on the summit of Mount Katahdin, the highest mountain in Maine, and \"resented mortals intruding from below\". Pamola was said to be \"the god of thunder\", and \"the protector of the mountain\". He was both feared and respected by the Penobscots and Abenakis, and his presence was one of the main reasons that climbing the mountain was considered taboo. Pamola was associated with causing \"wind, snow, and storms\"; caused \"a noise like the whistling of a powerful wind\" when flying; and was \"large enough to carry off a moose\".[11] The legend of Pamola may have also been the inspiration for Chadwick Boot in naming House Thunderbird of Ilvermorny. Martha Steward (II), the Squib daughter of Ilvermorny founders Isolt Sayre and James Steward, married a no-Maj of the Pocomtuc tribe, and may have been familiar with this story, or the mythical bird itself. Around 1754, the Pocomtuc tribe, due to the Seven Years' War, joined and merged with the Abenaki tribe. Many of the present-day Abenaki of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Canada are of part-Pocumtuc ancestry.[12]\n\nMany schools and colleges in the United States and Canada use a Thunderbird as their mascot and symbol. Notable schools include Mesa Community College, located in the Thunderbird's native habitat of the Arizona desert, and the University of British Columbia.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Phoenix is the closest relative of the Thunderbird, as both birds are affiliated with the elements of fire and lightning respectively, both of which are forms of the fourth state of matter, plasma.\n\nThe Thunderbird is also connected to the Phoenix in that they both have life renewing properties: while the Phoenix rejuvenates itself by burning and rising from its ashes in addition to the healing properties of its tears, the Thunderbird summons storms that bring life-giving rains to the deserts.\n\nFunnily enough, the Phoenix is the namesake of the State Capital of Arizona, Phoenix Arizona, which is part of the Thunderbird's native range and habitat.\n\nIn Sioux, the Thunderbird is known by the name, Wakinyan, which translates to \"thunder being\" or \"thunder spirits\" in English. It is typically in reference to this legendary creature. Interestingly, the Sioux believed the Wakinyan to be the mortal enemy of the Unktehi, the Horned Serpent, which is the mascot of another house of Ilvermorny.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore states in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald that the Dumbledore family have an bloodline inherited affinity with great magical birds, which include Thunderbirds and phoenixes. Albus knew of the events surrounding the Thunderbird Frank, who Newt was with in the first Fantastic Beasts film, despite being on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Also, Albus stated that his great-great-grandfather had a phoenix who left when his great-great-grandfather died, and never returned, which also happened to Fawkes when Albus died in June 1997. Meaning, once a Dumbledore dies, the phoenix leaves forever. In Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, Albus Dumbledore further states that the reason why Credence has a phoenix is because he was dying from his Obscurial nature poisoning him to death, and that he knows this because he saw the same thing when Ariana was dying from her Obscurial nature poisoning her to death.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2017 edition)\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay (Mentioned only)\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (Mentioned only)\n\nPottermore (First appearance)\n\nWizarding World\n\nLEGO Dimensions\n\nLEGO Harry Potter\n\nHarry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery\n\nHarry Potter: Wizards Unite\n\nHarry Potter: Magic Awakened\n\nHarry Potter: Puzzles & Spells\n\nNotes and references[]"
