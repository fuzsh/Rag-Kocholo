Dine out on some of the best seafood in the area, relax in waterfront cafés, or take part in a variety of water activities.\n\nVisit the lush and beautiful oceanfront city of Victoria. The city is rich in British heritage, has the oldest Chinatown in Canada, and is home to the historic BC Parliament Buildings.
