        "text": "Welcome to Con Air\n\nFrom the Bonneville Salt Flats, it’s only 10 minutes to Wendover, where the Wendover Airfield is bursting with film history. Scenes from \"Independence Day,\" ”Jurassic Park III,\" and the 2003 film adaptation of \"Hulk,\" were all filmed at this historic World War II outpost, as well as the action-thriller, “Con Air,” starring Nicholas Cage.\n\nAlthough the film was released in 1997, almost all the locations of the fictitious Lerner Airfield on the South Base of the former military site are recognizable: The hangars and warehouses, the long barbed wire fence, and even the tower. It’s a replica of the airfield’s original tower, into which the DEA agent’s Corvette crashes in the film. Visitors can climb the tower for a panoramic view.\n\nTo visit South Base, visitors should register in advance (call 435-665-7724) for an all-access tour. At the airfield’s main building is the Jailbird, the Fairchild C-123 Provider transport aircraft, featured in the movie.\n\nA special discovery that I didn't expect was the historical swimming pool, only a few minutes away from the airfield. Here Steve Buscemi, as serial killer Garland Greene, speaks and sings with a little girl who, thankfully, is spared. The swimming pool, which opened in 1943, and was in operation until the 1980s. Here and at other “Con Air” locations it almost seemed as if the film crew had just left.\n\nThelma & Louise Meet Indiana Jones\n\nThe town of Moab is an old hand at starring in films, due to its location between Arches and Canyonlands national parks. In 1949, the town became a popular setting for westerns, and notable director John Ford shot his film classics \"Rio Grande\" and \"Wagon Master\" in the area. The Moab to Monument Valley Film Commission was founded in 1949, and has earned a reputation as the longest running film commission in the world.\n\nMy starting point is the Red Cliffs Lodge on the Colorado River, where John Wayne, notably, stayed, and many westerns were filmed on the property. Visitors can explore the lodge’s Moab Museum of Film and Western Heritage to view rare film posters, memorabilia and props, and to further understand how movies and this place have been interwoven for decades.\n\nThe Red Cliffs Lodge is located on Scenic Route 128, so fans of the HBO series \"Westworld\" are likely to have a déjà-vu experience as many scenes were created along this route and Castle Valley’s adjacent La Sal Loop Road. That’s just another sign of Moab’s long-lasting cinematic appeal (Read: HBO's Westworld. See it now, in Utah).\n\nAt the town’s front door is Arches National Park, one of the country’s most beautiful landscapes, featuring more than 2,000 stone arches. An easy hike, about ¾ of a mile there and back, led me to the impressive Double Arch, where I found myself in the setting of the opening scene from \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\" This is the spot where River Phoenix, as the young Indiana Jones, runs out of the cave entrance to save the Cross of Coronado from shady treasure hunters. The \"Hulk\" has already jumped through this landscape.\n\nAt Courthouse Towers, not far from the park’s entrance, roadtrippers Thelma and Louise (Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon), who are under suspicion of murder and armed robbery, are stopped by a state trooper. That’s the scene where Thelma locks the trooper into the trunk of his police car, after Louise has taken his gun. When the two girlfriends seem to be standing at the Grand Canyon at the end of the movie, it's actually Fossil Point below Dead Horse Point State Park. (See the itinerary: Thelma & Louise: A Tribute Road Trip Through the Classic Film’s Utah Settings)\n\nIn their hopeless situation, the women drive their Ford Thunderbird over the gorge. Fossil Point can be reached from the west through Canyonlands National Park, or from the east via State Route 279 and San Juan County Road 142, also called Shafer Trail or Potash Road. The spot is even identified on Google Maps as Thelma & Louise Point. From Moab, it takes a little more than an hour to drive either route.\n\nDead Horse Point State Park itself is easier to reach, and is a familiar backdrop from an episode of \"Westworld\" and the pilot of \"MacGyver.” When film viewers see Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) daringly climbing up the rocks at the beginning of \"Mission: Impossible 2” until he stands in front of a breathtaking panorama, it’s easy to assume this was shot at the Grand Canyon."
