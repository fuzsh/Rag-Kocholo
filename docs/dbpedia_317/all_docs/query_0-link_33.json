        "text": "Like clockwork each year, as soon as the flowers start to emerge and birds start singing their dawn chorus, Victoria, BC springs to life for another eventful season. Whether you are looking to frolic through rainbow-hued blooms, stroll along the tranquil Inner Harbour or want a fun-filled family spring break, Victoria makes for a quick, easy and affordable getaway to reconnect with family and friends. Kick off your springtime travel planning with our picks for 70 things to do in Victoria, BC this spring!\n\n1. The Butchart Gardens\n\nCelebrate the glory of all things green (and red, yellow, purple and pink) in the 55-acre grounds of The Butchart Gardens. Stunning any time of year, The Gardens are an absolute must in the spring. Feast your eyes on an explosion of swoon-worthy blooms as tulips, magnolias and daffodils spring to life.\n\nKiddo bonus points for letting your small fry put their drawing and scavenger hunting skills to the test as they scamper down stone-lined pathways on a family discovery walk. Not only is it an entertaining and educational way to take in the grounds, but it will also allow you to experience a side of The Gardens you never knew existed.\n\n2. Tea or Cocktails at the Empress\n\nTreat yourself like royalty for the day with Tea at the Fairmont Empress. Sip on exquisite loose leaf tea from china literally fit for a king and queen (it was originally created for the royal visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1939). Dine on a lineup of scrumptious goodies each more delicious than the last. If you want to make it special, order flutes of sparkling wine and toast to a day of fun and relaxation.\n\nIn addition or alternatively, you don’t want to miss out on grabbing a drink at Q Bar, one of Canada’s top-rated cocktail bars.

A must-stop on your visit to Victoria.\n\n3. Fisherman’s Wharf\n\nPop around the corner of Victoria’s Inner Harbor to Fisherman’s Wharf and admire the colorful houseboats as they creak and bob with the tide.

Abkhazi Gardens\n\nOne of the best secret gardens in Victoria, bar none, there is no more romantic place to go for a stroll than the secluded Abkhazi Garden. The garden was created as a labor of love by Prince and Princess Abkhazi, who were separated in World War II, but were reunited and married after the war.\n\nWander through the one-acre grounds to check out colorful clusters of blooms hanging from 100-year-old rhododendrons and carpets of alpine flowers flowing around natural rocks.\n\n5.

Time your visit to catch the “Running of the Goats,” a furry stampede of baby goats that will have the kids squealing with excitement!\n\n9. Victoria Butterfly Gardens\n\nTuck inside a tropical paradise at the Butterfly Gardens & Insectarium. Wander through the jungle-like grounds and marvel at exotic flowers, carnivorous plants, frogs, tortoises, flamingos, insects, large iguanas and, of course, thousands of colorful butterflies.
