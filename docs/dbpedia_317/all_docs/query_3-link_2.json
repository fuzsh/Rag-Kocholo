        "text": "VANCOUVER, March 7, 2019 /CNW/ - Thunderbird Entertainment Group Inc. (TSXV:TBRD) (\"Thunderbird\" or the \"Company\"), a global multiplatform entertainment company, is pleased to announce that its releasing division, Thunderbird Releasing, will be distributing Sara Colangelo's award-winning drama The Kindergarten Teacher, across the UK and Ireland. Following its UK debut at the 2018 London Film Festival, the film arrives in theatres on Friday, March 8, 2019. The film will open in key venues in London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin and various others across the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe Kindergarten Teacher is being supported by Birds' Eye View, a UK-based agency campaigning for gender equality in film; as part of the Reclaim The Frame series, which is dedicated to highlighting films by women to build a more balanced film future. With International Women's Day around the corner on March 8, the film's release has special significance as part of the day's celebration of the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women around the world.\n\nStarring Maggie Gyllenhaal and Gael Garcia Bernal, the dramatic film focuses on a teacher who discovers her young student (Parker Sevak) may be a poetic prodigy, and goes to extraordinary lengths to nurture his talent. Written and directed by Colangelo, the film scooped the U.S Dramatic Directing prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2018, amid fierce competition from Bo Burnham, Paul Dano and Boots Riley, among others.\n\n\"We're hugely proud to be staging this significant theatrical release of Sara Colangelo's remarkable film, The Kindergarten Teacher, with an arguably career best performance from Maggie Gyllenhaal,\" says Edward Fletcher, Managing Director of Thunderbird Releasing. \"Responses to the film from the theatres and critics alike have been fantastic and we're delighted to be able to share it with audiences across the UK & Ireland.\"\n\nEarly reviews for the film are overwhelmingly positive, with Jordan Hoffman of the Guardian calling it a \"brilliantly observed ethical pretzel\" and Tim Grierson of Screen International calling Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance \"superbly enigmatic.\"\n\nFor images, please visit Thunderbird Releasing's press assets page: http://www.thunderbirdreleasing.com/press-area/\n\nAbout Thunderbird Entertainment Group Inc.\n\nThunderbird Entertainment Group is a Vancouver-based global multiplatform entertainment company with offices in Vancouver, Los Angeles, Toronto, Ottawa and London.
