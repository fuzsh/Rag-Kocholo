        "text": "A Hollywood producer with back-to-back Academy Awards for best picture says he’s fed up with Los Angeles, and he’s moving to Oklahoma where he plans to spend upwards of $250 million to make movies from a home base in Norman.\n\nRichard M. Greenberg, a fixture in Tinseltown from as far back as the 1980s, says making movies in L.A. and New York isn’t what it used to be with today’s high wages, cumbersome regulations and skyrocketing operating costs.\n\nBut the producer of “Platoon,” which won best picture in 1987 and “The Last Emperor,” the best picture winner in 1988, has found affinity in the Sooner State. He likes the people, he likes the countryside, and he likes the friendly business attitude so much that he’s not only going to make movies in the state, but he plans to buy a home here too.\n\nAnd Greenberg isn’t just a two-hit wonder. Making successful feature films is a habit of his. He’s made 27 major motion pictures in his career, and he says all of them have made money.\n\nPeople in Hollywood still remember Greenberg’s astounding run of 17 major motion pictures produced from 1982 to 1985. According to reports, he raised $700 million to produce those movies, which included prominent titles, such as “Terminator,” “Excalibur,” “Summer Lovers,” “Easy Money,” “Platoon,” “Lone Wolf McQuade,” “King Solomon’s Mines,” and “Return of the Living Dead.” That run also included “First Blood,” the original “Rambo” movie starring Sylvester Stallone.\n\nBut the movie business has changed, Greenburg says, and the Oklahoma enterprise he is bringing to Norman is changing with the times.\n\nThe managing partner of HIP Capital Resources is no longer interested in producing the big-budget film projects he’s known for. Starting in the second quarter of this year, he and his colleagues will begin shooting TV movies for a growing market of entertainment streaming services that have an insatiable appetite for original content.\n\nServing subscribers from around the world, streaming services will pay millions of dollars per movie, he said. And with a cadre of veteran filmmakers by his side, Greenberg plans to churn out several movies a year.\n\n“That is good news for Norman,” said Lawrence McKinney, president of the Norman Economic Development Coalition. “I’m very excited.”\n\n“The fact that Richard is the only living producer with back-to-back Academy Awards for major motion pictures, you can’t get any better than that,” McKinney said.\n\nMcKinney and his office have been working with Greenberg and fellow Hollywood producer and production manager Randy Turrow since last year, introducing them to local investors and showing them potential filming venues in Norman, Cleveland County, Oklahoma City and elsewhere.\n\nHe says Norman is a unique city with more to offer the film industry than most communities. There are beautiful neighborhoods, historic areas, and tree-lined streets. Norman has Lake Thunderbird, the Canadian River, and downtown Norman. Oklahoma City and other surrounding communities offer urban cityscapes, rural settings, and a variety of other backdrops.\n\nAnother attractive asset is the University of Oklahoma, which produces actors, engineers, writers, and other talent. The Moore Norman Technology Center would also be a resource for set design, construction, and other technical services.\n\nIt’s always challenging to bring new companies into a community, but the City of Norman and Cleveland County have been helpful, McKinney said. Work is now underway with the Oklahoma Film + Music Office to certify Norman as an Oklahoma Film Friendly Community, which will help pave the way for filming projects throughout the area.\n\nThe economic benefits for Norman and surrounding communities could be enormous, McKinney says.\n\nOn average, each movie project employs about 200 workers, and wages start at $35 an hour, McKinney said. Most of the workers could make six figures per project.\n\nThe movies Greenberg will be shooting may not be big-budget Hollywood blowouts, but they’re not small potatoes either. McKinney says TV movie productions can cost $100,000 to $150,000 per week, and there could be multiple movie projects going simultaneously.\n\nAnd in Oklahoma, those dollars go much farther than they do in California, which is another reason why Greenberg likes the Sooner State.\n\n“When you think of California verses Oklahoma, just think of the energy costs,” he said. “They are going to save a ton of money on fuel and electricity costs alone.”\n\nWhile the Oklahoma Film Commission’s state subsidies for the movie industry have attracted box office projects, such as the recently released “Killers of the Flower Moon,” Greenberg said state money is not luring him to Oklahoma.\n\nInstead, private investors from Norman and the Oklahoma City area have gotten involved. Since December, they have put $3 million into the long-term enterprise. Along with financial returns, these investors will see capital gains tax savings through the Federal Opportunity Zone program.\n\nEstablished through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Opportunity Zone program was created to be an economic development tool to encourage investment in low-income communities. Because there are three Opportunity Zones located in Norman and Cleveland County, Greenberg’s HIT Capital Resources is eligible to be a qualified Opportunity Zone business, which gives investors access to attractive tax advantages provided under the law, said Jordan Cramer, chief executive of the Norman-based Revive Opportunity Zone Fund.\n\nThere are $250 million worth of scripts and movies that are ready to be produced,” Cramer said. “The goal is to take that $250 million of what HIP Capital Resources is bringing to Norman and make the city into a full backlot for movie making.”\n\nOklahoma has seen other filmmakers venturing into the state, but Greenberg is the first to have a plan that will establish a sustained movie-making presence in Oklahoma. But he’s not likely to be the last, Cramer said.\n\n“And that’s OK,” he said, “The more the merrier. We would welcome them to come to the state. It would be good for Norman.”"
