        "text": "For three years, Colten was also a halibut fisherman on board the boat Ocean Twilight, which would eventually lend its name to the production company he founded, all the while continuing to write scripts, dreaming about acting, and telling his adventure stories. To his surprise, his fisherman friends and family encouraged him in his dream to become an actor and filmmaker.\n\nIn 2015, he relocated to Victoria BC, to sign up for a one-year diploma course at the Victoria Academy of Dramatic Arts. He fell in love immediately with acting, while also absorbing the arts and culture of the city.\n\nColten then moved to Vancouver to pursue acting and filmmaking, and established Ocean Twilight Films, while continuing to learn all the ins and outs of making movies and documentaries. His first of several projects is the feature film Thunderbird being released in May 2021, in which he is the lead actor/producer/executive producer. His next film Airband is in pre-production, and he has three other scripts ready to go. His philosophy is to find creative people passionate about expression, and to work with them to bring compelling stories to life on the screen.\n\nHe is also focused on documentaries and factual television, launching Hoghead Media, which will explore Canadian history. He recently led an expedition to find a sunken locomotive lost in Slocan Lake shortly after World War II. He filmed the underwater footage, leading the diving operation determined to find the train. This documentary is now in post-production. Colten’s talents of diving in deep waters, exploring mine shafts and his determination to write untold stories make him unique as a filmmaker and one to watch as his adventures continue.\n\nHis first television breakthrough would come in 2010 on the gritty and critically acclaimed Canadian First Nations television series Blackstone. Four seasons of Black Antelope’s portrayal of Darrien Tailfeathers - a villain that audiences would come to love-to-hate, would earn him a CSA nomination (Canadian Screen Award formerly known as a Gemini) for best Guest Star in a TV series alongside Ed Asner and William Shatner. In 2014 Black Antelope was cast in John Logan’s Penny Dreadful, which took him overseas where he secured European representation and has since worked consistently both nationally and internationally on Film and TV projects in leading, supporting and guest star roles in Debris, The Flash Hold the Dark, Condor, Caught, Hell on Wheels andJann just to name a few.\n\nAlso a self-taught creative producer and filmmaker, JBA has produced an impressive slate of award-winning feature films screened worldwide in high profile festivals in addition to writing, directing and producing his own television series for broadcast.\n\nAn actor with a strong sense of physicality, JBA often plays characters with stunt action who are fearsome, menacing and psychotic villains. He credits his sanity, strength and foundation to the practice of his cultures belief systems, traditions and his loving and supportive wife Tracy and their three beautiful daughters Sparrow, Emiko and Romin.\n\nCurrently Ava can be seen as ‘young Beth/Alice’ on CW’s Batwoman. Ava's heart breaking portrayal of Beth/Alice’s backstory has caused fans to root for the redemption of the network’s biggest and baddest villain.\n\nHaving been fortunate to have worked with some of the best directors, production teams, and actors in the industry Ava has learned so much in a short time, yet at 14 years of age she’s really just getting started. She looks forward to the challenge of more complex roles and storylines in her future.\n\nWhen Ava is not working on a film project, she enjoys competing in dance, swimming, skimboarding, spending time with her family, and walking her adorable Labradoodle Maisie.\n\nAfter completing the CMPA Mentorship Program Michael continued to work with Force Four (now E-One) in various positions including Director, Field Producer and Assistant Director. He worked on the National Geographic series Border Security Canada & USA. In addition, he worked as a Field Producer on Slice's Emergency Season 1, and CBC’s Keeping Canada Alive.\n\nIn 2017 Michael co-founded Ocean Twilight Films and is a partner in the company. In early 2019, He produced and completed his first feature film ‘Thunderbird’. Michael currently continues to work in the film and television industry in Vancouver. Bigger than any film ever made he and his supportive and loving wife Mariel welcomed their son Heath in 2019, who he reads to, and fosters opportunity for imagination daily.\n\nLastly Michael’s energy thrives when he is being of service to others, sharing his passion for film and his skill set with those who are marginalized. He strives to listen to what is needed for voices to be heard, and stories to be told."
