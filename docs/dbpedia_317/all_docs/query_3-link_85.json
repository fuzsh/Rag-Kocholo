        "text": "Thunderbirds are pretty sweet if we're being honest. So big they could snatch whales out of the ocean with their talons. Called thunderbirds because they created thunder with the flap of their wings. Controlled rain and could shoot lighting from their eyes. Put me on team thunderbird for creatures that could f up a dragon.\n\nBigfoot is so popular in the Pacific Northwest that I find it hard to believe more hasn't been done with it in fantasy. Maybe writers who live there are just tired of it in all the gift shops of nearly every small forest town and don't want anything to do with it. Maybe it'll just forever be a big hairy creature throwing rocks at hunters. I think it needs the orc treatment where there's a wave of people trying to paint them in a different light.\n\nI know the wendigo has gained a little bit of traction on the horror side of things, but I think it's still underused.\n\nWhat other creatures in the western hemisphere could use a little more love in fantasy? Or where can great works with the creatures mentioned above be found?"
