        "text": "As part of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation’s programming for Reconciliation Week in 2023, Wookey Films was commissioned to produce a 30 minute documentary that was shown in thousands of classrooms across Canada. WFI is incredibly grateful for this opportunity to contribute positively to the NCTR’s mandate, as well as contributing to the education of young people throughout the country.\n\nThe doc featured three incredible artists: Nikki Komaksiutiksak, an Inuit throat singer, Ryan Richard, a master of the Red River Jig, and River Nelson, a young yet incredibly talented First Nations Grass Dancer. Together at Thunderbird House in Winnipeg, the three shared their talents with one another, performing their craft and teaching each other about their respective art forms. This showcase of cultural traditions from Indigenous peoples across Canada was beautifully shot and crafted by the very talented duo of Quan Luong and Jesse de Rocquigny."
