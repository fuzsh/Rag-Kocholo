        "text": "Toronto Thunderbird Summit October 15-18, 2014\n\nThe Thunderbird Community is planning to get together at the Mozilla Office in Toronto, Canada for 4 days, Wednesday October 15, 2014 - Saturday October 18, 2014.\n\nCurrent Status\n\n2014-10-15 It happened!\n\n2014-10-09 Travel arrangements have been made, and we are looking forward to getting together. We hope to have video available for a half-day on Friday, Oct 17 for any who may want to participate remotely in critical group discussions.\n\n2014-09-18 status update: Mike Conley is working with a travel agent to sort travel arrangements for people whose attendance will be paid by Mozilla.\n\n2014-09-05 status update: The Summit is happening!\n\nLocation\n\nMeetings: Mozilla Toronto office\n\n366 Adelaide St W, Suite 500 Toronto, ON M5V 1R9 Canada\n\nmap to Mozilla office\n\nHotel: Hilton Garden Inn Toronto Downtown\n\n92 Peter Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5V 2G5, Canada\n\nmaps and direction to hotel\n\nMap of airport transit\n\nCommunications\n\nMailing list\n\njoin irc.mozilla.org #tb-summit for backchannel discussion\n\nMinutes: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Summit_2014/minutes\n\nOverall Goals and Purpose\n\nIn 2012, Mozilla made a major change to the funding and structure of Thunderbird. Funding was dramatically reduced, but Mozilla agreed to provide basic funding and staff to ensure the continuing stability of Thunderbird, leaving innovation up to a community of volunteers. The departing Thunderbird staff and existing volunteers had a meeting in Warsaw in Fall 2012 to discuss the transfer of responsibility.\n\nWe've now had a couple of years to see how this is working out. Thunderbird usage continues to grow (in spite of media reports in 2012 that \"Thunderbird is dead\"), and we've recently released a new version of Thunderbird.\n\nYet there are many issues confronting the Thunderbird product that need resolving if we are to effectively serve our user base. Thunderbird has a community that would love to move the product forward, and we need to resolve some of these issues to remain useful and relevant. A short, incomplete list of issues:\n\nThe Thunderbird staff team that was originally promised to provide stability to Thunderbird has been largely preoccupied with other Mozilla initiatives, and is not able to maintain the product.\n\nExisting volunteers spend most of their time keeping Thunderbird functional at all in the light of massive changes occurring in the base code, leaving little time for innovation or improvements.\n\nInnovation efforts that were in-process in 2012, and were badly needed, have largely remained frozen and incomplete. This includes maildir, replacement address book, async database processing, and others.\n\nMany volunteer contributors express frustration at the lack of direction and leadership of Thunderbird.\n\nThe governance structure of Thunderbird is a remnant of the old staff-driven project, rather than reflecting a community-driven project.\n\nOn June 13, 2014, rkent sent out an email to approximately 20 key contributors asking if we should consider some sort of meetup to discuss issues, and see what it would take to move Thunderbird forward. The vast majority responded that this was needed, and we arrived at October 15-19, 2014 as viable dates for most people. We investigated locations, and chose the Mozilla office in Toronto as the best location, as it is fairly centrally located, visas are easy, Mozilla has space there we could use at no direct cost, and several contributors live in the Toronto area.\n\nInvited Attendees\n\nR Kent James, Mailnews Peer (Washington, USA)\n\nMagnus Melin, Thunderbird Peer (Finland)\n\nRichard Marti, Thunderbird Theme Module Owner (Switzerland)\n\nFlorian Quèze, Thunderbird Instant Messaging module owner (France)\n\nMike Conley, Thunderbird Peer (Toronto, Canada)\n\nIrving Reid, Mailnews de-facto Peer (and assigned Mozilla Thunderbird staff), (Toronto, Canada)\n\nPhilipp Kewisch, Calendar Module Owner (Germany)\n\nPatrick Cloke, Thunderbird Instant Messaging peer (Massachusetts, USA)\n\nWayne Mery, Thunderbird drivers and QA volunteer (Pennsylvania, USA)\n\nAceman, Thunderbird key developer, (Slovakia)\n\nThomas Düllmann, Thunderbird key bug triager and key UX contributor (Germany)\n\nHiroyuki Ikezoe, Mozilla Japan Thunderbird developer (Japan)\n\nSuyash Agarwal, Thunderbird key developer and GSOC intern (India) visa declined\n\nBlake Winton, Thunderbird Peer and UI lead (Toronto, Canada)\n\nJoshua Cranmer, Mailnews multi-module owner and peer (New York, USA)\n\nJosiah Bruner, Thunderbird Theme Peer (Michigan, USA)\n\nMark Banner, Thunderbird and Mailnews Module Owner (England) is not coming\n\nJim Porter, Thunderbird MIME Peer (Boston, USA) is not coming\n\nRoland Tanglao, Thunderbird support (Vancouver, Canada)\n\nAndreas Wagner, Add-on reviewer and developer, DFKI GmbH, ForgetIT Project (Germany)\n\nDaniel Scruton, Instantbird contributor (Italy) is not coming\n\nNihanth Subramanya, Instantbird contributor (Goa, India)\n\nMerike Sell, Lightning contributor (Estonia)\n\nMakeMyDay, Lightning contributor (Germany)\n\nPossible non-funded participants\n\nBron Gondwana, IMAP protocol expert (FastMail, Australia)\n\nEvert Pot, Interested bystander from Fruux (Toronto)\n\nJoeS1\n\nSchedules\n\nFull Name Email Address Check-In Date Check-Out Date Arrival Time Arrival Airport Departure Time Departure Airport \"Bruner, Josiah\" josiah@programmer.net 15-Oct-2014 18-Oct-2014 \"Cloke, Patrick\" clokep@gmail.com 14-Oct-2014 18-Oct-2014 14-Oct-2014 8:20PM YYZ 18-Oct-2014 8:30PM YYZ \"Conley, Mike\" mconley@mozilla.com \"Cranmer, Joshua\" Pidgeot18@gmail.com 15-Oct-2014 18-Oct-2014 15-Oct-2014 7:30PM YTZ 18-Oct-2014 9:35AM YTZ \"Düllmann, Thomas\" thomasd.bugzilla@gmail.com 14-Oct-2014 19-Oct-2014 14-Oct-2014 2:55PM YYZ 19-Oct-2014 8:30PM YYZ \"MakeMyDay\" makemyday@gmx-topmail.de 14-Oct-2014 19-Oct-2014 14-Oct-2014 3:50PM YYZ 19-Oct-2014 9:20PM YYZ \"Ikezoe, Hiroyuki\" hiikezoe@mozilla-japan.org 14-Oct-2014 18-Oct-2014 14-Oct-2014 4:40PM YYZ 18-Oct-2014 2:05PM YYZ \"James, Kent\" kent@caspia.com 13-Oct-2014 20-Oct-2014 13-Oct-2014 5:45PM YYZ 20-Oct-2014 6:10AM YYZ \"Kewisch, Philipp\" kewisch@gmail.com 14-Oct-2014 18-Oct-2014 14-Oct-2014 5:12PM YYZ 18-Oct-2014 7:30PM YYZ \"Marti, Richard\" richard.marti@gmail.com 14-Oct-2014 19-Oct-2014 14-Oct-2014 7:55PM YYZ 19-Oct-2014 5:35PM YYZ \"Melin, Magnus\" mkmelin+mozilla@iki.fi 15-Oct-2014 18-Oct-2014 15-Oct-2014 3:50PM YYZ 18-Oct-2014 3:10PM YYZ \"Mery, Wayne\" vseerror@lehigh.edu 15-Oct-2014 18-Oct-2014 15-Oct-2014 5:16PM YYZ 18-Oct-2014 11:39AM YYZ \"aceman\" acelists@atlas.sk 14-Oct-2014 19-Oct-2014 14-Oct-2014 7:05PM YYZ 19-Oct-2014 9:20PM YYZ \"Quèze, Florian\" fqueze@mozilla.com 14-Oct-2014 19-Oct-2014 14-Oct-2014 1:00PM YYZ 19-Oct-2014 7:00PM YYZ \"Reid, Irving\" irving@mozilla.com \"Sell, Merike\" merikes@gmail.com 14-Oct-2014 19-Oct-2014 14-Oct-2014 2:45PM YYZ 19-Oct-2014 6:25PM YYZ \"Subramanya, Nihanth\" nhnt11@gmail.com 14-Oct-2014 18-Oct-2014 14-Oct-2014 11:10AM YYZ 18-Oct-2014 6:30PM YYZ \"Tanglao, Roland\" rtanglao@mozilla.com 14-Oct-2014 7:26PM YYZ 19-Oct-2014 8:15PM YYZ \"Wagner, Andreas\" mail@andreaswagner.org 14-Oct-2014 20-Oct-2014 14-Oct-2014 4:15PM YYZ 20-Oct-2014 5:50PM YYZ \"Winton, Blake\" bwinton@mozilla.com\n\nAgenda\n\nTuesday October 14\n\nFor those in town for dinner, please come to the BarHop at 391 King Street for beer and food. rkent will be there at 6:30 PM.\n\nWednesday October 15\n\nDoors to the Mozilla office will be accessible from 9 AM on (with breakfast). We will start our first session around 10 AM with a group session for introductions, and discuss workgroups that will form for the day to address various topics. We should quit by 5:30 PM.\n\nPossible topics:\n\nDesign and plans for a new address book (code-named Ensemble)\n\nFixing crasher bugs\n\nDesign of the user interface for a filter editor supporting boolean search criteria\n\nIssues in landing New Account Types extension to support email-like items in extensions\n\nChat group to work together -- (likely) WebRTC over XMPP and IRC\n\nCalendar group to work together\n\nDinner: Join us at Pizzeria Via Mercanti.

We may schedule some specific topics to present to the group in the afternoon.\n\nDinner: We'll be eating at a restaurant called Hush: http://hushrestaurants.ca/. Food and drink will be covered. For those who have indicated nut allergies, we have alerted the restaurant, and your meals will be nut free.\n\n10:00 - Compose (Joshua)\n\n10:30 - New Account Types/SkinkGlue (R Kent)\n\n11:00 - Developer Tools (Philipp)\n\n11:30 - OAuth/GMail (Joshua)\n\nBreak for lunch.\n\n1:00 - Autoconfig (Bron)\n\n1:30 - Profiler (Mike)\n\n2:00 - Performance (Wayne)\n\nFriday October 17\n\nwill be devoted to all-hands discussions where we will try to resolve a number of critical issues affecting the project. This session will be available for live participation beginning at 9:30 AM EST (6:30 AM Pacific Daylight Time) using the normal channels for Thunderbird status meetings. See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/StatusMeetings for connection details.\n\nKey agenda items:\n\nHow should we organize the project governance to make a transition between the old Mozilla-dominated leadership, to a community-based governance model?\n\nDevelop and maintain a list of Core Contributors for Thunderbird (perhaps annually), who can use that title in personal communications, and may vote for Thunderbird leadership positions. Currently would be around 30 people.\n\nElect a smaller Thunderbird Executive Council that has the responsibility over all aspects of Thunderbird.\n\nShould we be raising income through donations? If so, what form would that take, and how would the income be used?\n\nHow can we fill non-coding gaps in project operations, including marketing, business development, and contributor engagement?\n\nIn Thunderbird 31, critical bugs that prevented unthrottling updates and were causing great grief (bug 1036338 and bug 902158) did not get any visibility for months after release. How can we prevent that in the future? We need ways to increase attention to users and their actual experiences with Thunderbird.\n\nShould we ship Lightning with the core product, and consider it a first-class part of Thunderbird?\n\nSet some reasonable goals for Thunderbird 38 of features to add or issues to fix.\n\nHow can we better empower bug triagers to have an impact to actually get bugs fixed?\n\nProposal to communicate with users for fund raising and engagement using the start page. Discuss any issues around having a more dynamic start page that communicates with users.\n\nFunding appeal would be very visible but time limited.\n\nEngage core team with users by featuring individuals (maybe by locale) on start page, including video.\n\nUnderstand why core contributors are involved with Thunderbird, and ways that we can better meet their expectations.\n\ncomm-central is currently either broken or restricted most of the time. Developers wanting to contribute are held hostage to fixing build issues, test breakages, starring obscure breakages, or m-c integration issues. Are there alternatives, like landing new code on comm-aurora, or introducing an m-c integration layer?\n\nI (rkent) have stated in my proposals for the future of Thunderbird that we remain a project under the Mozilla umbrella, but with increased autonomy. This should be discussed and, if appropriate, confirmed by the community.\n\nRemote participation or viewing of Friday group sessions is possible, beginning at 9:30 AM EDT (6:30 AM Pacific Daylight Time) using the same channels as the regular weekly Thunderbird status meetings.\n\nVideo Instructions: See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/StatusMeetings for details.\n\nOverall Summit Description and Agenda: See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Summit_2014\n\nNotes from actual Friday meeting: See https://etherpad.mozilla.org/17october2014-tbsummit\n\nFeel free to join in if you are interested in the future of Thunderbird.\n\nOther potential agenda items\n\nIs the income raised by promoting particular partners in email providers, filelink providers, and search worth the intrusion and inconvenience to the user?\n\nRecommend changes to module ownership and peers to reflect our actual current situation.\n\nHow can we work collaboratively to make plans for product direction (a roadmap) with our limited resources? Should we even have a roadmap? Can we agree on how to decide on, and flag in BMO, features that we would really like to see (Example: bug 119977 \"Option to exapnd mailing list into addresses window\")\n\nWhat are the obstacles and frustrations that people are experiencing in contributing to Thunderbird, and how can we overcome these?\n\nWho are our users? How can we better understand and meet the needs?\n\nWhat are some reasonable promises that we could make with our funding campaign? Ideas:\n\nFully Support maildir\n\nFully Support > 4GB folders\n\nCardDAV in address book\n\nFilter on Send\n\nWhat should we be doing to engage more effectively with Mozilla staff and resources? Reps, academic programs, etc.\n\nCan we agree on a set of values, or a mission statement, for the Thunderbird?\n\nHow should we be making feature decisions for Thunderbird? Role of ui owner, exec council, TB peers. Examples: Folder selection ui, new search terms.\n\nDiscuss merits of shipping certain features as extensions with the product. Lightning is one example, but there could be others.\n\nHow can we more effectively engage with stakeholders outside of Mozilla? Examples: email providers (like Fastmail), Linux distros (like Debian and Ubuntu), large enterprise users (???), protocol communities (like IMAP)\n\nI (rkent) believe that we should provide some recognition to organizations that are providing staff support for Thunderbird, including Linagora, Mozilla Japan, and Mozilla itself. (Full disclosure: my own MesQuilla might also be a candidate here). Pro or anti comments? How could we do that (like brief links on Start Page?)\n\nAn alternative to a donation-based funding model for Thunderbird (which could also co-exist) would be a \"Thunderbird Pro\" version that added extra features or support with a paid subscription. Any interest in this direction from folks?\n\nSaturday will be divided into subgroups to develop plans and address issues, according to interest areas. These subgroups may come out of the Friday discussions.\n\nLightning Talks\n\nSome of the group sessions will be devoted to informal Lightning talks of 5 - 15 minutes duration. We will have a signup for these at the Summit. Some talks we would like to see:\n\nPerspective from email providers, and specifically Fastmail, including account discovery (brong)\n\nHow to use bugzilla to track bugs, including use of status fields, flags, keywords, and whiteboard (thomasd wayne)\n\nCurrent status and plans for Chat\n\nCurrent status and plans for Lightning\n\nPerspective from addons, including important abandoned or non-AMO addons (Andreas)\n\nChanges in Support (Roland stepping down)\n\nUsing developer tools (Fallen)\n\nStatus of Darkmail (clokep)\n\nIssues with OAuth (jcranmer, Fallen, bron)\n\nLocalization community and issues (Merike)\n\nFunding Appeal Video\n\nDuring the summit, we intend to film a video that will be used as part of our proposed direct appeal to users for Thunderbird funding. Brainstorming for that video is here: Thunderbird Funding Appeal 2014\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the schedule? The current expectation is that Oct 15 & 16 will be work days for people to collaborate on Thunderbird-related projects. Friday Oct 17 is the \"all hands\" day where we will try to have any critical discussions about the project, as the most regular contributors are available on that day. The conference continues through Saturday afternoon, October 18. You may attend all or part of the conference, but if you are not a regular contributor, it might be best to attend just Friday and Saturday.\n\nWho may attend? The conference is open to all. Regular project contributors are strongly encouraged to attend.\n\nWhat will it cost? The conference itself will be without charge. We are currently trying to gather funds so that we will be able to pay the travel and expenses of 10 - 20 regular contributors, though others are free to come if you can fund your own travel and expenses.\n\nHow can I get more information? Email R Kent James <kent@caspia.com> or contact rkent in Mozilla #maildev IRC\n\nMay I make a suggestion? Sure. Use Thunderbird Summit 2014 Suggestions for agenda or other suggestions\n\nOther"
