        "text": "Artists\n\nCherie Dimaline\n\nMétis author, Cherie Dimaline, is best known for the 2017 bestselling dystopian young adult novel, The Marrow Thieves, which won awards in both Canada and the United States. She was born in 1975 and is a member of the Georgian Bay Métis Nation in Ontario.\n\nDimaline published her first book, Red Rooms, in 2007. The novel won the Fiction Book of the Year award at the Ankoshk Aboriginal Literature Festival. She went on to publish her next novel, The Girl Who Grew a Galaxy, in 2013. The following year, she was named the Emerging Artist of the Year at the Ontario Premier's Award for Excellence in the Arts and became the first Indigenous Writer in Residence for the Toronto Public Library. Her short fiction collection, A Gentle Habit, was published in 2016.\n\nThe Marrow Thieves is set in a dystopian future, but reflects the destructive impact of Indian Residential Schools on Indigenous peoples in Canada. It won a Governor General's Literary Award for Young People's Literature, the Kirkus Prize for young readers' literature, the Amy Mather's Young Reader's Award and was named the \"One Book\" for both the cities of Brampton and London, Ontario. It was also a finalist in the 2018 Canada Reads competition on CBC Radio and is the YA selection for the Global Read Aloud program. Vancouver-based Thunderbird Entertainment optioned the book's television rights. She has also been the editor of both FNH Magazine and Muskrat Magazine and is currently part of the editorial team at Theytus Books, Canada's oldest Indigenous publishing house.\n\nFind out more at Quill and Quire's article on Cherie Dimaline.\n\nJeremy Dutcher\n\nJeremy Dutcher is a classically-trained, First Nations tenor, composer, musicologist, performer and actor. His 2018 album, Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa, a tribute to the traditional songs of his people, won both the Polaris Music Prize and a JUNO Award.\n\nDutcher was born in 1990 and is a Wolastoqiyik (previously known as Maliseet) member of the Tobique First Nation in New Brunswick. He studied music and social anthropology at Dalhousie University in Halifax where he began a research project exploring the tonal differences between Western classical music and traditional Wolastoqiyik music.\n\nAn interview with traditional Wolastoqiyik song-carrier Maggie Paul led him to study early 20th century wax cylinder recordings of Wolastoqiyik music in the collection of the Canadian Museum of History. He was deeply moved to hear the recordings of his ancestors' songs, which, had been declared illegal and had to be kept alive in secret, like so much of Indigenous spiritual and cultural practices.\n\nToday, Wolostoquey is an endangered language, with fewer than 100 people who speak it fluently. His award-winning album, Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa intertwines songs he composed and sings with samples of original recordings of traditional songs. Dutcher is devoted to the renaissance in Indigenous languages and cultures.\n\nFind out more at JeremyDutcher.com.\n\nAlanis Obomsawin\n\nAlanis Obomsawin is a prominent First Nations documentary filmmaker, singer, artist, storyteller and activist who has focused her work on the struggles of Indigenous peoples and on ensuring their voices are heard.\n\nObomsawin is a member of the Abenaki Nation, born in August 1932 in New Hampshire on Abenaki territory but grew up on the Odanak Reserve near Sorel, Québec.

She is also a faculty member in the University of British Columbia's (UBC) Faculty of Medicine and is leading an innovative biobank project located at the University Hospital of Northern British Columbia.\n\nCaron was born and raised in Kamloops, British Columbia. Her Anishnaabe mother grew up on a reserve in Ontario, attended residential school and became a teacher. Inspired by her example, Caron was an excellent student. She completed her Bachelor of Science degree in kinesiology at Simon Fraser University in 1993, where she was a star basketball player and a top undergraduate student. She was also a top student as she studied medicine at UBC. Caron earned a Masters degree in public health from Harvard while completing both her surgical residency as well as a postgraduate fellowship at the University of California specializing in endocrine surgical oncology.\n\nShe returned to British Columbia in 2005 and began her practice as a general and endocrine surgeon at the Prince George Regional Hospital. Caron is an associate professor in UBC's Northern Medical Program and founding co-director of the UBC Centre for Excellence in Indigenous Health. She is also an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins Centre for American Indian Health.\n\nAt the University Hospital of Northern British Columbia Caron is spearheading the Northern Biobank Initiative. This initiative will bank tissue from medical procedures to enable northern British Columbians, including members of rural, remote First Nations communities, to have more equitable access to genomic research into diseases such as colorectal, breast and thyroid cancer. Among other partners in the Northern Biobank Initiative is the British Columbia First Nations Health Authority.\n\nCaron received the Dr. Thomas Dignan Indigenous Health award from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada in 2016.\n\nFind out more at Nadine Caron's profile on The University of British Columbia's website.\n\nSenator Lillian Eva Dyck\n\nTrailblazing neuroscientist Senator Lillian Dyck was the first First Nations woman to obtain her PhD in the sciences in Canada. She is also the first female First Nations senator in Canada and the first Canadian-born Chinese senator.\n\nDyck was born in 1945 in North Battleford, Saskatchewan. Her father, Quan Leen Yok, had immigrated to Canada from China. Her mother, Eva Quan (McNab), was Cree and a member of the Gordon First Nation. However, her mother's Indian status was revoked because she married Quan, a non-status man. Her mother had attended an Indian Residential School where she learned to be ashamed of her Cree identity. She told Dyck and her brother to pretend they were just Chinese, so they would face less racism. After her death when Dyck was still a young girl, she and her brother helped their father run his cafés as they moved around small towns in Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\nDyck was always an excellent student, and she earned three degrees from the University of Saskatchewan, culminating in a PhD in biological psychiatry in 1981. She was a full professor in the Neuropsychiatry Research Unit, Department of Psychiatry and associate dean in the College of Graduate Studies and Research at the University of Saskatchewan. In 2005, she was appointed to the Senate and is the Chair of the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples. Her areas of work in the senate include Chinese Canadians, women in science and post-secondary education. She has been particularly focused on the tragedy of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, such as proposing bill S-215 to address violence against them.\n\nFind out more at the Senate of Canada, Senator Lillian Eva Dyck.\n\nLouie Kamookak\n\nInuit Elder, educator and historian, Louie Kamookak, is best known for his extensive research into the lost Franklin expedition that was essential for the discovery of the HMS Erebus shipwreck in 2014.\n\nKamookak was born in 1959 at a seal-hunting camp on the Boothia Peninsula near Taloyoak, Nunavut. He learned hunting and fishing skills out on the land with his father and grandfather and began to attend school when he was 12. Lessons about the ill-fated 1845 Arctic expedition led by Sir John Franklin sparked his life-long interest in the mystery. He remembered his great-grandmother's stories of finding artifacts such as forks and spoons on the north shore of King William Island. He became a schoolteacher, working with youth in his hometown of Gjoa Haven, Nunavut and passing on traditional knowledge.\n\nKamookak continued to look for clues about Franklin and his crew, interviewing many Inuit in his area over decades. He assisted various searches and in 2008 began working with the Parks Canada team that found the shipwrecks in 2014 in the area that the Inuit stories had pointed to all along.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Geographical Society made Kamookak an honorary vice-president in 2016. He also received a Governor-General's Polar Medal, the Inuit Heritage Trust Recognition award and in 2017 he was invested as a member of the Order of Nunavut and the Order of Canada.\n\nFind out more at Remembering Inuit oral historian Louie Kamookak.\n\nDr. Stanley Vollant\n\nDr. Stanley Vollant, the first Innu surgeon in Quebec, has worked to inspire and help Indigenous youth to fulfill their dreams, including embarking on a 6,000 km walk to bring Indigenous peoples together and foster cross-cultural understanding in Canada.\n\nVollant was born in 1965 in Québec City and raised by his grandparents in the village of Pessamit in the North Shore region of Québec. He spoke Innu and learned a love of the land from his trapper grandfather. He learned French when he started school and excelled in his studies and sports. He studied medicine at the Université de Montréal and finished his residency in general surgery in 1994. He began his work at the regional hospital in Baie-Comeau, Québec where he became known for his innovative work, particularly with laparoscopic surgery and lectured in many schools.\n\nIn 2001, he was elected president of the Québec Medical Association, the first Indigenous person to head a medical association in North America. After moving to Ottawa, he served as director of the Aboriginal program at the University of Ottawa's Faculty of Medicine.\n\nDespite his professional success, Vollant fell into a deep depression. He eventually found a remedy in reconnecting with the Earth while traveling in New Zealand. In 2008, while walking the famous Santiago de Compostela route in Spain, he had a dream of his grandfather telling him to start a similar walk in Canada to help connect Indigenous communities and inspire Indigenous youth. In 2010, he began his 6,000 km Innu Meshkenu (My Innu Path) from Labrador through Québec and Ontario, speaking at schools and bringing Elders and youth together along the way. In 2016, he founded the Puamun Meshkenu (path of a thousand dreams), a non-profit organization with the goal of inspiring and supporting Indigenous individuals on their way to developing their full mental, spiritual, physical and emotional potential.\n\nFind out more at The Canadian Encyclopedia, Stanley Vollant."
