Here’s the new link: https://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/204180702979678/\n\nI DARE anybody to find 2001 ads in the Thunderbird section!\n\nNoir on\n\nGreat place. The drive up to it seemed narrow and long. I remember almost an entirely African-American audience from 1972-1974.Before that it is vague. I remember the films with black stars—I do not remember what we saw—-Shaft, Superfly, Grier, Buck and the Preacher, …\n\nThis area was completely surrounded by a majority African-American community and you could access it from black areas with out passing through non-black areas via Highway 70 to Goodfellow, drive down Natural Bridge from Union or Kingshighway, drive from Kienlen…safe physical access mattered.\n\nIt was called “The Bird.”\n\nBeing from the city, Thunderbird was a drink, like Rosie O'Grady, Freight Train,or Brass Monkey.\n\nNext door: I liked the Goody Goody Restaurant. I liked Sam the Watermelon man There was a liquor store across the street. I love Skateking in 1970’s 1980’s and 1990’s—-real DJ’s, real mixes, real dancing with couples, Soul Train line on skates, flips and jumps, slow songs, fast songs a real vibrant sycopated dance floor. Fabulous urban line dancing on skates—you name it. Christian nite, old school for elders night and so on. Groups use to travel from Skateking to other rinks around the country—New York, Atlanta, Detroit—-and people use to ask—elsewhere —about Skateking. Tom Casevelli Ford was there on Goodfellow. Old reserve Army Barracks and Small Ammunition plant.\n\nAfter thunderbird closed,\n\nNorth Twin was the only drive-in left within range.\n\nMichaelKilgore on\n\nFrom the Motion Picture Exhibitor, July 1, 1959: “Construction work is being pushed on the new Thunderbird Drive-In (in St. Louis), which is being built by the Jablonow-Komm Theatres.”\n\nThe follow-up on July 15, 1959: “The Thunderbird Drive-In, with accommodations for almost 900 cars, opened.”\n\nThe Thunderbird (finally) debuted in the Motion Picture Almanac in the 1963 edition, capacity 800, owner Louis Jablonow. It stayed that way through 1966, then the MPA didn’t list owners in 1967-76. In 1977, the Thunderbird’s owner was Mid-America Theatres. And even though we have a better closing date, the MPA continued to list the Thunderbird through 1979. Sigh!\n\nChris Utley on\n\n12 years after that…”debate” about movie titles at the T-Bird began, the St. Louis area newspapers are now archived online. I have embarked on my own personal tracking of the old St. Louis movie theater listings from the 1970’s and the T-Bird listings under the Mid-America banner show roughly 75% Blaxploitation, 10% Kung-Fu, 10% Horror and a scant 5% mainstream titles (like westerns and such).\n\nI suspect that the memories of those residents that were mentioned before are from the days of traveling to the Airway, St. Ann 4 Screen, Holiday & North Twin to see those big ticket titles. Because none of those played here. And we now have the receipts."
