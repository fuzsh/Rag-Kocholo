Thunderbird Films was founded in 2019 by two industry veterans, Randy Wayne and Talia Bella, who decided to partner their strengths and relocate from Los Angeles to Oklahoma and provide the local film industry with much needed production services and support to help in the growth of local infrastructure, equipment and qualified crew. Thunderbird Films hopes to bridge the gap and support filmmakers coming to Oklahoma to film.

“I’ve filmed in eight countries and half of the U.S. and there is no place I’d rather be making movies than Oklahoma,” said Wayne. “Being an Oklahoman myself, I have a lot of state pride. I want the state to succeed. Oklahoma is not only friendly, it’s also full of unknown talent.” He continues, “The state is gorgeous. The people are friendly. The talent is plentiful. Why film anywhere else?”

Thunderbird has either produced or provided production services for five films and four commercials since making the move. Notable credits include the 2021 Sundance Official Film Selection “Wild Indian”, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kate Bosworth, and the recently wrapped production of “Bob and Amy”, starring Anna Camp and Joseph Mazzello. Thunderbird Films has expanded into a turnkey production company with their own G/E, transpo, production supplies, location services and camera rental company. Thunderbird is currently producing two documentaries in Oklahoma and are in active development for a slate of films.

“I left the commercial production world and moved into independent film to be more creative and make stories come to life,” said Bella. “I was hesitant to jump into the indie world and even more so in Oklahoma. It was a scary transition for this big city girl, but I’m glad I did. I’ve only been living and making movies in Oklahoma for a year and a half and it already feels like home. I was relieved to see a film industry that was already up and running and with full steam ahead.”
