A central figure in the Fifties Los Angeles doo-... and R&B scene, Richard Berry is best known for his frat-rock classic 'Louie Louie'. A Louisiana native, Berry was raised in Los Angeles, stricken with polio as a toddler. Attending Jefferson High School, Berry was surrounded by a host of future R&B stars including Jesse Belvin and Curtis Williams. Working with a series of vocal groups, he collaborated on recordings with The Crowns, The Flairs, and The Robins. Berry first appeared on a hit record in 1954 as a guest lead vocalist on The Robins' 'Riot In Cell Block #9'. Also that year, he traded vocals with Etta James on her smash hit 'The Wallflower (Roll With Me Henry)'. Recording 'Louie Louie' in 1957 as by Richard Berry and The Pharaohs, the record was a minor hit at the time, the song detailing the exploits of a bartender and a love-starved customer in a Jamaican bar. Needing money to get married, in 1957 Berry sold the copyrights of seven of his songs, including 'Louie Louie', for $750. Over the years, the three-chord song was covered by several Pacific Northwest rock groups; after The Wailers scored a regional hit in 1960, both Paul Revere & The Raiders and The Kingsmen recorded the song, with the latter's version becoming a rock classic. Although Berry remained a fixture on the Los Angeles music scene throughout the Sixties, he was unable to garner national success. When Rhino Records was compiling an all 'Louie Louie' compilation album in 1986, the label asked Berry to submit a newly recorded version after the song's copyright owners demanded an exorbitant fee for Berry's original rendition. By the mid Eighties, Berry reclaimed partial ownership rights to the song, winning about $2 million of its $10 million accrued royalties.

The success of his dramatic symphony Heimferd (Homecoming) in 1930 brought him national fame, but the post-War triumph of modernism, coupled with his personal modesty, pushed Irgens-Jensen's tonal music into the shadows: its contrapuntally based textures and its modally tinged harmonies were seen as things of the past. But a growing number of recordings is revealing him as one of the most distinguished and distinctive voices in twentieth-century music, a figure of international importance who wrote music of striking nobility and strength of purpose - with some meltingly lovely melodic lines. Arvid O. Vollsnes' Ludvig Irgens-Jensen: The Life and Music of a Norwegian Composer is the first discussion in English of this profoundly decent man and his life-enhancing music. A review of the original Norwegian publication of this book in Aftenposten, the main Norwegian daily paper, described it as 'a gripping biographical portrait. As well as Irgens-Jensen's life we get a broad picture of Norwegian musical life from the 1920s to his death in 1969'.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjVuJ5xRcgk\"]Passacaglia - Ludvig Irgens Jensen - 1927 - YouTube[/ame]​\n\nin 1970 - Delroy Pearson, rock vocalist (Five Star-Between the Lines) is born.\n\nin 1970 - Beatles' \"Let It Be,\" single goes #1 and stays #1 for 2 weeks.\n\nin 1970 - Peter Green quit Fleetwood Mac while on tour in Germany, to avoid breach of contract he agreed to finish the current tour.\n\nin 1970 - The Beatles started a two week run at No.1 on the US singles chart with 'Let It Be'.

When Tiny Tim appeared on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1968, no one was quite sure what to make of him. Here's this guy with a massive, hooked nose, powdered face, and long, scraggly, dyed hair, wearing baggy clothes, singing one of the greatest hits of 1929 (12 weeks at #1 in 1929 for Nick Lucas), \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" in a vibrato-laden falsetto, strumming a ukulele.\n\nAs it turned out, the answer to both questions was yes. Herbert Khaury was born to a Lebanese father and Jewish mother, both working in the garment industry. As a young man, he didn't fit in. He spent hours poring through the sheet music collections at the N.Y. Public Library, learning songs on his ukulele. By the late 1950s, he was playing the songs of Rudy Vallee on the ukulele as \"Larry Love the Singing Canary,\" performing at Hubert's Museum in Times Square as a freak attraction. By the early 1960s, he'd moved up in the world, playing places like Cafe Bizarre in Greenwich Village. By 1964, he had taken the Dickensian moniker of Tiny Tim for keeps and often played at a club called the Scene, one of the places Jimi Hendrix would frequent only a few years later.\n\nTim earned some notoriety for singing both parts of romantic duets, singing the woman's part in a warbly falsetto and the man's in his natural baritone. He was booked on TV shows like Merv Griffin and earned a part in Peter Yarrow's film You Are What You Eat. Yarrow, of Peter, Paul, and Mary, brought Tim to the attention of the president of his record company, who signed the unlikely performer. His first album, 1968's God Bless Tiny Tim, which included \"Tiptoe through the Tulips,\" went to #7 while the single hit #17. Thus began Tim's 15 minutes of fame.\n\nTim became a regular on the Tonight Show,leading to his Dec. 17, 1969 wedding to 17-year-old \"Miss Vicki\" Budinger on the show. For several decades, this episode of the show was the highest-rated late night show ever! However, Tim's second album didn't do nearly as well, and by the time he put out For All My Little Friends in 1969, he had lost his novelty appeal. There just weren't that many people who enjoyed the sheer musicology of what Tim did. By 1977, his marriage to Budinger had gone the way of his musical career.\n\nTim performed club dates when he could through the late 1970s and 1980s, occasionally recording material that ranged from minstrel show songs from the tum of the century to AC/DC. In the mid-1990s, Tim attracted the attention of a new generation of musical experimenters. In 1996 he recorded .... with Tex.-bred polkamaniacs Brave Combo, featuring his underground hit cover of \"Hey Jude.\" He also appeared on TV shows like Roseanne.

American saxophonist born in Memphis; he began his interest in music at the Mount Nebo Baptist Church were his father was pastor. His music education continued in high school and at University in Oklahoma. He returned to Memphis in 1965 and began session work at Stax Records where he teamed up with trumpeter Wayne Jackson. The two created the signature horn sound at Stax, heard on hit records by Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others, and helped fuel the label's golden era. After recording numerous tracks at Stax, he and Wayne formed themselves into the renowned Memphis Horns and began freelancing (complications from Alzheimer's disease) - Born November 21, 1941.\n\n12 APRIL\n\npage 2 of 2\n\n13 APRIL\n\npage 1 of 2\n\nin 1713 - Pierre de Jelyotte, composer is born.\n\nin 1728 - Johann Christoph Schmidt, composer, dies at 63\n\nin 1733 - Johann Heinrich Zang, composer is born.\n\nin 1742 - Giovanni Veneziano, composer, dies at 59.\n\nin 1756 - Johann T Gottlieb Goldberg, German klavecinist/composer, dies at 29.\n\nin 1762 - Karl Friedrich Horn, composer is born.\n\nin 1799 - Joseph Rastrelli, composer is born.\n\nin 1810 - Felicien (-Cesar) David, French composer, is born at Cadenet, Vaucluse. After the death of his parents, he was sent to be a chorister at the cathedral of St. Sauveur in Aix-en-Provence. He entered the Paris Conservatory in 1830, where he studied with F. Fetis (fugue) and F. Benoist (organ); he also studied privately with H. Reber. In 1831 he joined the St. Simonians, a messianic socialistic cult patterned after the ideas of Claude-Henri de Rouvroy, Count of St.-Simon (1760-1825).\n\nAfter its forced disbanding in 1832,he made a pilgrimage to Egypt and the Near East, where he absorbed the flavor of the Orient. Returning to Paris in 1836, he produced a number of works based upon his travels, many with titles reflecting oriental exoticism. His first success came in 1844 with the symphonic ode Le Desert for Soloists, Men's Chorus, and orchestra. After visiting Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer in Germany in 1845, he turned his attention to opera. He achieved little success, with the exception of his Lalla-Roukh (1862), which retained its popularity for many years.\n\nAlthough he received many awards, including the rank of Officier de la Legion d'Honneur (1862) and membership into the Academie des Beaux Arts (succeeding Berlioz, 1869), his music virtually disappeared; occasional revivals are fostered by those with an interest in the exoticism of the period. - Died at St.-Germain-enLaye, Aug. 29, 1876.\n\nin 1816 - Sir William Sterndale Bennett, distinguished English pianist, conductor, and composer, is born at Sheffield. His father, Robert Bennett, an organist, died when he was a child, and he was then placed in the care of his grandfather, John Bennett, who was also a musician. At the age of eight he was admitted to the choir of King's College Chapel, Cambridge, and at ten he became a pupil at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where he studied theory with Charles Lucas and piano with William Henry Holmes, and played violin in the academy orchestra under Cipriani Potter; he later studied music theory there with William Crotch.\n\nSoon he began to compose; he was 16 years old when he was the soloist in the first performance of his Piano Concerto No. 1 in Cambridge on Nov. 28, 1832. In 1836 he made an extensive visit to Leipzig, where he became a close friend of Mendelssohn and Schumann; also appeared as a pianist and conductor of his own works with the Gewandhaus Orch. there. He continued to compose industriously, and played his Piano Concerto No. 4 with the Gewandhaus Orchestra in Leipzig on Jan. 17, 1839. He visited Germany again in 1841-42. From 1843 to 1856 he gave a series of chamber music concerts in London; in 1849 he founded the Bach Society.\n\nFrom 1856 to 1866 he conducted the Philharmonic Society of London; concurrently he held the post of professor of music at the University of Cambridge; in 1866 he assumed the position of principal of the Royal Academy of Music. His reputation as a composer grew; Mendelssohn and Schumann were eloquent in praising his works. He amassed honors: in 1856 he received the honorary degree of D.Mus. from the University of Cambridge, which also conferred on him the degree of M.A. in 1867; he received the degree of D.C.L. from the University of Oxford in 1870; in a culmination of these honors, he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1871. The final honor was his burial in Westminster Abbey. - Died at London, Feb. 1, 1875.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir-F8hVRytc\"]YouTube - William Sterndale Bennett - Piano concerto No.4 in F-minor - Finale - Presto agitato (3/3)\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube - William Sterndale Bennett - Piano concerto No.4 in F-minor - Finale - Presto agitato (3/3)[/ame]​\n\nin 1822 - Gaetano Valeri, composer, dies at 61.\n\nin 1825- Josef Gelinek, composer, dies at 66.\n\nin 1826 - Franz Danzi, composer, dies at 62.\n\nin 1830 - Eduard Lassen, composer is born.\n\nin 1831 - Ferdinand Kauer, composer, dies at 80.\n\nin 1864 - Johann Schneider, composer, dies at 74.\n\nin 1865 - Heinrich Reinhardt, composer is born.\n\nin 1868 - John Blackwood McEwen, composer is born.\n\nin 1873 - Theodore Morse, composer is born.\n\nin 1873 - Carlo Coccia, composer, dies at 90.\n\nin 1883 - Alexander Alexandrov, composer is born.\n\nin 1886 - Ethel Leginska, composer is born.\n\nin 1886 - Karoly Thern, composer, dies at 68.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjVuJ5xRcgk\"]YouTube - Passacaglia - Ludvig Irgens Jensen - 1927\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube - Passacaglia - Ludvig Irgens Jensen - 1927[/ame]​\n\nin 1890 - Ludwik (Ryszard Marian) Bronarski, Polish-Swiss musicologist, is born at Lemberg. He traveled to Vienna, where he studied musicology with Adler and Dietz at the University (1909-13), later completing his training with Peter Wagner at the University of Fribourg (Ph.D., 1919, with the dissertation Die Lieder der heiligen Hildegard; published in Zurich, 1922); he subsequently received a law diploma (1926). He taught at the Fribourg Conservatory (1946-67). With J. Turcyriski, he edited the Paderewski edition of Chopin's works (21 vols., Warsaw, 1949-63). - Died at Fribourg, Nov. 9,1975.\n\nin 1895 - Olga Rudge, violinist is born.\n\nin 1899 - Alexander Alexandrovich Davidenko, composer is born.\n\nin 1906 - Bud (Lawrence) Freeman, tenor saxophonist, clarinetist, composer, is born at Chicago. Freeman started on \"C\" melody sax in 1923, taking a few lessons from Jimmy McPartland's father, then studied for six months with Duke Real. He was an early cohort of the Austin High Gang, playing regularly with Jimmy (cornet) and .... (guitar) McPartland, and Frank Teschmacher (reed player) in The Blue Friars. From April 1925, he played the tenor sax. The Blue Friars worked under Husk O'Hare's management as The Red Dragons and began broadcasting on radio station WHT; when the original Wolverines disbanded. During 1926, the group worked as Husk O'Hare's Wolverines, played at White City Ballroom, Chicago, and in other local venues.\n\nLater that year, Bud joined Herb Carlin, then toured with Art Kassel. On his return to Chicago, he played for various leaders, and recorded with the McKenzie and Condon Chicagoans, as well as leading his own recording band. In late 1927, he joined Ben Pollack and moved with the band to N.Y. in February 1928. He had left Pollack by summer of 1928, briefly accompanied Bea Palmer (left after a week), and then sailed to Europe for a two-week date playing aboard the lIe de France. He returned to N.Y. and then worked through mid-1934 with Red Nichols, Zez Confrey, and other jazz-pop bands.\n\nFrom 1934 on, he worked primarily with big bands, including Joe Haymes from (spring 1934),Ray Noble's arch. (opening at Rainbow Room, Radio City, N.Y., 1935), Tommy Dorsey (April 1936-March 1938), and Benny Goodman (March-November 1938).In April 1939,he took his own Summa Cum Laude Band into Kelly's, N.Y. The band played many residencies, as well as for the short-lived musical Swingin' the Dream (a version of A Midsummer Night's Dream with Louis Armstrong and Maxine Sullivan) in November 1939. They disbanded in July 1940, and Bud toured with his own big band before joining Joe Marsala in October 1940.\n\nHe returned to Chicago, and then led his own big band (soon reduced to a small group) for club work. He served in the U.S. Army from June 1943 until 1945, and led a service band at Fort George, Md., then led a big band in the Aleutians. After the war, he worked stints in Chicago and N.Y., leading his own small bands, and continuing prolific freelance recording activities, including regular sessions with Eddie Condon.\n\nHe continued leading small groups throughout the 1950s and 1960s, regularly featured at major jazz festivals throughout the Ll.S. He was temporarily out of action for six months (late 1967 to spring 1968) after an automobile accident. In 1969, he was a founding member of the World's Greatest Jazz Band, with co-leaders Bob Haggart and Yank Lawson, remaining with it until 1971. He moved to London in 1974, continuing to perform and tour. In 1978, he returned to Chicago.\n\nHe worked club jobs and toured through the remainder of his life, and also authored three books. He died of cancer just short of his 85th birthday. Critics mistakenly listed him as a source of Lester Young's style, based on Young's comment that he liked Bud Freeman's playing with Benny Goodman in 1938; too late for either of them to influence each other. In any case Freeman's earliest recordings are in a heavy style quite unlike Young's, or his own bubbling later work. Died at Chicago, March 15, 1991.\n\nin 1911 - Nino Sanzogno, composer is born.\n\nin 1921 - Carlo Prosperi, composer is born.\n\nin 1925 - Hilda Dianda, composer is born.\n\nin 1928 - Luis Iruarrizaga Aguirre, composer, dies at 36.\n\nin 1930 - Howard Mayer Brown, American musicologist, is born at Los Angeles. He studied composition with Piston and musicology with Gombosi at Harvard Univversity (B.A., 1951; M.A., 1954; Ph.D., 1959, with the dissertation Music in the French Secular Theater, 1400-1550) published in Cambridge, Mass., 1963); also studied in Vienna (1951-53) and later held a Guggenheim fellowship in Florence (1963-64). He was a member of the faculty at Wellesley College (1958-60). In 1960 he was appointed to the staff of the University of Chicago, where he subsequently was made a professpr (1967) and chairman of the music dept. (1970). From 1972 to 1974 he taught at King's College, University of London, and then returned to the University of Chicago. In 1989 he was made an honorary member of the American Musicological Society. He published Instrumental Music Printed before 1600: A Bibliography (Cambridge, Mass., 1965), Embellishing Sixteenth-Century Music (London, 1976), and Music in the Renaissance (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1976; 2nd ed., 1999, with L. Stein). In 1970 he was named editor of the compendium Italian Opera, 1640-1770: Major Unpublished Works in a Central Baroque and Early Classical Tradition (N.Y, 1977 et seq.). With S. Sadie, he edited Music Before 1600 (Basingstoke, 1989) and Music After 1600 (Basingstoke, 1989). - Died at Venice, Feb. 21, 1993.\n\nin 1931 - Anita Cerquetti, Italian soprano, is born at Montecosaro, near Macerata. After training in Perugia, she made her operatic debut in 1951 as Aida in Spoleto. She then sang in various Italian opera houses. In 1955 she made her U.S. debut at the Chicago Lyric Theatre. In 1958 she scored a major success when she substituted for Callas in the role of Norma at the Rome Opera, and that same year she made her first appearance at Milan's La Scala as Abigaille. Her promising career was cut short by a debilitating illness which compelled her to retire in 1961 aged only 30.\n\nin 1932 - Karl Kroeger, composer is born.\n\nin 1934 - Horace Kay, US singer (Tams-You Lied to Your Daddy) is born.\n\nin 1934 - Siegfried Matthus, composer is born.\n\nin 1936 – Milton Brown, musician know for 'Milton Brown and his Musical Brownies' dies.\n\nin 1937 - Richard and John Contiguglia, identical twins, brilliant American duo-pianists, are born at, N.Y. They began taking piano lessons in early childhood, and grew in parallel congruence. They played in a duo recital in public when they were six, and continued to develop in close consanguinity; they composed music for two pianos and transcribed solo works for their concerts. When they were 12, Percy Grainger invited them to play at one of his recitals; he subsequently befriended them and gave them valuable advice.\n\nLater they took piano lessons with Jean Wilder and with Bruce Simonds at Yale Univ., and upon graduation received a Ditson Fellowship, which enabled them to study with Dame Myra Hess in London. They made their professional debut in London in 1962, playing piano Four-Hands; in 1964 they made a major European tour. In addition to the standard literature for duopianos, they performed piano transcriptions for two pianos and for piano Four-Hands of obscure works.\n\nIn 1971 they gave an all-Liszt concert in London, which included his piano transcription of his symphonic poems Mazeppa and Orpheus, and of his arrangements of excerpts from Bellini's Norma and La Sonnambula and Mozart's Don Giovanni. In 1972 they played Liszt's transcriptions of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in London, arousing considerable curiosity, and repeated this exhibition in N.Y. in 1974. They gave the first performance of Liszt's Grosses Konzertstiick tiber Mendelssohn's \"Lieder ohne Worte\" for two Pianos, composed in 1834, in Utrecht on Oct. 19, 1986. They further played duo-piano works by Bartok and Grainger. For a brief period, they split their original fetal name into two fungible parts, Conti-Guglia.\n\nin 1938 - Frederic Rzewski, Westfield Mass, composer (Spacecraft) is born.\n\nin 1940 - Lester Chambers, Ms, vocalist (Chamber Brothers-Time Has Come Today) is born.\n\nin 1941 - Margaret Price, Tredegar Wales, soprano (Pamlina-Die Zauberfl\"te) is born.\n\nin 1942 - Bill Conti, Providence RI, composer (For Your Eyes Only, Rocky IV) is born.\n\nin 1943 - Eve Graham, rocker (New Seekers) is born.\n\nin 1943 - Guy Stevens, a former British deejay turned rock producer, Guy Stevens was a well respected arbiter of taste for the British mod scene of the mid Sixties. Having developed an early interest in American rock'n'roll, soul and R&B, Stevens ran the UK division of the Sue record label for Chris Blackwell, and used it to put out obscure singles not only from the US Sue group of labels, but from any number of tiny independent record companies, and some of the bigger ones. Stevens was also president of the Chuck Berry Appreciation Society, and had a say in the UK releases that the Pye record label put out by Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and others on the Chess and Checker labels. Stevens even flew to America to help secure Chuck Berry's release from prison, not that Berry thanked him for his efforts, and brought him to the UK for his first tour. As a deejay at the Scene Club in Soho, London, Stevens' impeccable taste for rock'n'roll, R&B, ska, jazz and soul meant that his weekly record sessions became a Mecca for the burgeoning Mod movement.\n\nHis stunning record collection was made available to the likes of such acts as The High Numbers (later The Who) from which to build their stage repertoire. He also put together several compilations of the Sue and Chess catalogue for Island. Moving into music he appeared as part of the 1967 artist collective Hapshash & The Coloured Coat, and produced such Island acts as The VIPs (who evolved into Art and then Spooky Tooth), Free and Mott The Hoople. An amiable eccentric, Stevens was highly respected in the industry though he spent time in jail for drug offences and, during one session with Mott The Hoople, destroyed a studio clock when someone pointed out that the session was running into overtime. Having lain low for several years with various alcohol-related problems, in 1979 he was invited to produce The Clash's third and arguably most defining album, London Calling. His production techniques at Wessex Studios were eccentric to say the least, with chairs being thrown about to coax better performances from the musicians while he filled a piano with beer to try to make it sound better.\n\n(Heart attack) He died in London. - Died August 29, 1981\n\nin 1944 – Brian Pendleton rocker (Pretty Things) is born. The rhythm guitarist of British R&B/rock act The Pretty Things, Brian Pendleton appeared on the group's early records. The Pretty Things were formed by singer Phil May and guitarist .... Taylor, who had just left an embryonic line-up of The Rolling Stones in 1962. A native of Wolverhampton, Pendleton joined the \"Pretties\" a year later. Among the first British groups to achieve mainstream success with blues/R&B material, the long-haired Pretty Things wore their hair longer than any other British group – even The Rolling Stones, a group they were constantly compared to. The group's UK chart entries between 1964/66 ran (in order): 'Rosalyn', 'Don't Bring Me Down' (banned in the US due to its lyrics), 'Honey, I Need', 'Cry To Me', 'Midnight To Six Man' and 'Come See Me', but the group were unable to make headway in the US, partly due to their wild sound and image. Experiencing personal problems, Pendleton quit the band in 1966 and soon dropped out of the music scene altogether. He made a brief appearance with the group in 1995 at the legendary 100 Club in London, performing on the encore 'Rosalyn'. At the time of his death, he was looking forward to receiving long-overdue Pretty Things' royalties. Stricken with cancer, he was found dead near the front door of his home in Maidstone, Kent. - Died May 16, 2001.\n\nin 1944 - Cecile Chaminade, composer, dies at 86.\n\nVideo Notes: This piano toccata, Op.39 (1887) by Cecile Chaminade, is a perfect example of the modern toccata form as developed by Bach, Schumann and others. It was flawlessly performed in 1993 by Enid Katahn. It is track 1 on the CD, which may still be available. Chaminade is seen in the 2nd and 3rd frames and elsewhere. Steel Moegle writes, \"Chaminade frequently used exotic titles, like Orientale, Sérénade, and Les Sylvains. These may have attracted people desiring an escape from the humdrum of everyday life. Chaminade had an exquisite gift for composing melodies. They are somehow familiar and very memorable. Chaminade was neglected in the later 20th century, but is being rediscovered in the 21st by folks like you and me.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SG2OkKHyvE\"]YouTube - Toccata by Cecile Chaminade\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube - Toccata by Cecile Chaminade[/ame]​\n\nin 1944 - Jack Casady, Wash DC, rock bassist (Hot Tuna, Jefferson Airplane) is born.\n\nin 1945 - Stacy Johnson, US singer (Sharpees-Tired of Being Alone) is born.\n\nin 1945 - Raymond van Geytenbeek, Dutch singer/drummer (Les Baroques) is born.\n\nin 1945 – Lowell George is born. A widely admired slide guitar player and founding member of the rock group Little Feat, Lowell George was also an alumni of several other groups. Born in Hollywood, California, the son of a furrier, George was raised in a privileged environment (his next-door neighbour was actor Errol Flynn). Studying the flute, at the age of six George performed on The Ted Mack Amateur Hour. Attracted to the guitar at age 11, George borrowed his brother's instrument. Emerging as a talented guitarist while attending college, in 1965 George formed a Byrds' cover group called Factory (Of Man), joined by future Little Feat member Fred Martin and future CSN&Y drummer Dallas Taylor.\n\nThough aided by the production skills of Frank Zappa, the group floundered. After briefly returning to college, George passed through a pair of one-hit wonder garage-rock bands, The Standells and The Seeds, both of whom were in their waning days. George subsequently joined Frank Zappa's Mothers Of Invention as the replacement for singer Ray Collins. A better guitarist than vocalist, George displayed his talent on the Zappa albums Hot Rats (1969) and Weasels Ripped My Flesh (1970). During this time George honed his songwriting skills, composing 'Willin'', which was recorded by Linda Ronstadt, and 'Truck Stop ....' which was included on The Byrds' Untitled album. Leaving The Mothers in late 1969, George joined Fraternity Of Man, appearing on the group's second album, Get It On (1969). Then, at the urging of Zappa, George formed his own group in early 1970.\n\nFrom the Mothers, George recruited bassist Roy Estrada, and from The Fraternity of Man, Bill Payne and Richie Hayward, to form the first line-up of Little Feat. Signing with Warner Brothers Records, the group was a huge critical success, often considered a country-rock or folk-rock extension of Zappa. Beginning with Little Feat (1971), Lowell George supplied the rhythm guitar on eight of the group's albums. Uncomfortable as the group's leader, George preferred to take a democratic approach to decisions. After Little Feat briefly disbanded in late 1973, George worked as a session player. Reforming in 1974, Little Feat enjoyed a radio hit with the funky George co-penned 'Rock And Roll Doctor' from the album Feats Don't Fail Me Now. In late 1975, during the recording of the album The Last Record Album, George was stricken with hepatitis. After recording three more albums, none of them big sellers despite the rave reviews they earned, and touring extensively in America and Europe, the group disbanded in 1979.\n\nBy this time their reputation as a hot and funky stage act was without peer but they were unable to trans"
