Now, a year later, the couple celebrated their wedding nuptials!\n\nAlthough the couple is staying ‘hushed’ in regards to the event, we know the wedding took place on Sunday, December 9, 2007 in New Jersey. Surrounded by family, friends and their Llanview castmates, the couple was announced as Mr. and Mrs. David Fumero. Should we receive more details from the happy couple, we’ll be sure to give you a little glimpse into their joyous day!\n\nMelissa Fumero, who will now take on David’s name, will be exiting her role after her contract is up sometime toward the end of January.
