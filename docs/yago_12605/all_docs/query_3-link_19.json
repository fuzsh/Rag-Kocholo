        "text": "[http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/2008/20080918.html \"One Life to Live\" recap (9/18/08) - ABC.com] ] and began appearing on a recurring basis starting October 2, 2008.\n\nCharacter history\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn May 2003, 15-year-old Adriana Colón arrived in Llanview to stay with her godmother Carlotta Vega for the summer. Upon arriving, she met and quickly fell in love with River Carpenter, to Carlotta's chagrin. Disapproving of the relationship, Carlotta did everything she could to separate the lovers, culminating in having Adriana whisked to a convent school in Puerto Rico in September 2003. Upon tracking her down, River brought her back to Llanview in January 2004.\n\nUpon Adriana's re-arrival in Llanview, Dorian Cramer Lord announced that she was her biological daughter and that Adriana, meanwhile, was to inherit $30 million dollars from Dorian's Aunt Betsy. In spite of Dorian's revelation to being Adriana's daughter originating as a scheme, cooked up by she and David Vickers to secure Betsy's money for themselves, it was later proven that Adriana was indeed actually Dorian's biological daughter.\n\n----\n\n\"NOTE: Adriana being Dorian's daughter was originally meant to be a hoax. The storyline, however, was switched midway through when OLTL's producers recognized a resemblance between Robin Strasser and Melissa Fumero.\"\n\n----\n\nWhile sitting as the Ambassador to Mendorra in the mid 1980s, Dorian was introduced to mobster Manuel Santi (brother of her longtime maid, Carlotta Vega.) The two briefly married, but six weeks later a now pregnant Dorian had the marriage annulled. Upon giving birth to Adriana, fearing for the child’s safety, in light of Santi’s reputation and lifestyle, Dorian (with Carlotta's help) placed her in the custody of the Colon family in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn summer 2004, Manuel Santi’s volatile son Tico Santi came to Llanview, forging a sibling relationship with Adriana. In the meantime, it was also revealed that Antonio Vega was too Santi's biological son, and also half-brother to Adriana.\n\nAdriana and River's relationship, meanwhile, took a serious turn—resulting in the two teenagers making love. They, however, failed to use protection and Adriana feared that she could be pregnant. To her relief, the test came back negative. Later, Adriana was temporarily kidnapped by members of Tico’s organization. Her sudden disappearance caused River to think that she no longer wanted to be involved with him, resulting in his then giving in to the temptations of the flirtatious Shannon McBain. Upon Adriana returning to Llanview, she caught the two together and steadfastly ended her and River's relationship. A heartbroken River left Llanview to study music at Juilliard.\n\nRelationships with Duke and Rex\n\nIn early 2005, Adriana began dating Duke Buchanan, despite that fact that their families were rivals and ardently objected to their involvement. That summer, Adriana even followed Duke to Argentina where Duke's great-grandfather Asa Buchanan was in hiding. While there, the two were chased by Argentine thugs, after overhearing a conversation between Asa and Carlo Hesser about eliminating one of the Cramer women, and assuming that they were speaking of Adriana.\n\nDuke and Adriana were captured by Carlo's henchmen and held for ransom. The two young lovers managed to escape on their own and return to Llanview. Adriana was bothered when Duke began spending more time with his job at Buchanan Enterprises. During this time, Adriana befriended Rex Balsom, and began feeling an attraction toward each other. Adriana resisted it, because of her relationship with Duke. The attraction, however, later lead to a kiss. When Duke learned of Adriana's indiscretion from Ginger Foley, he was angered but willing to work things out. When Adriana and Duke were about to make love for the first time, in the heat of the moment, she called Duke by Rex's name. Furious, Duke ended their relationship. The two slowly made inroads back with each other and tentatively began seeing each other again, but Adriana's attraction to Rex remained a palpable presence in their relationship . Realizing her feelings for Rex weren't going away, Adriana broke things off with Duke, but a misunderstanding led her to believe that Rex wasn't interested in her. After dancing around their feelings, the two began dating.\n\nAdriana and Rex's new relationship was tested when she learned that he had aided and abetted a fugitive Todd Manning. In the spring of 2006, Adriana began modeling and quickly forged a successful career, resulting her becoming stalked by an obsessed fan. Adriana was anonymously attacked several times by her unknown pursuer, while Rex sought to protect her. Fearing for her safety, Adriana and Rex left Llanview. The stalker, however, became aware of their whereabouts and followed them into seclusion. As Rex investigated who was behind the ordeal, Adriana mistakenly believed that he was the culprit, and made haste to get away from him.\n\nWhile trying to get away from Rex, the real desperado captured Adriana. The actual stalker was shady attorney Bruce Bartlett. During this time, Adriana was startled to learn from Bruce that he'd been hired by Dorian to tail her while the two plotted to make Rex look like the guilty party, in Dorian's attempt to break up Adriana and he. Bruce, however, turned on Dorian and was now demanding ransom for Adriana's safe return.\n\nMeanwhile, Rex continued to investigate, and eventually intervened. During a ferocious fight, Rex killed Bruce. While Adriana and Rex reunited, Adriana was livid with Dorian for the stunt she pulled and exiled her from her life. Adriana later moved in with friend Layla Williamson, while the two joined forces to going into the lingerie design business. The two soon hired a model by the name of Tate Harmon, and he and Adriana became friends. Rex did not trust Tate and began to investigate, which led to him and Adriana's break-up. Rex continuted to investigate, and turned to the police commissioner Bo Buchanan. Tate was later verified as a member of the One Pure People, a racist group. Adriana still loved Rex, and they soon got back together.\n\nAdriana recently has a very interesting conversation on her cell phone. Rex does a double take when Adriana asks questions about her pregnancy, such as \"When will I start to show?\" Rex's mother, Roxy is shown on the phone with Rex and ask when are they going public with the news. Later Rex confront's Adriana about the baby and is trying to be supportive, unsure how Adriana feels. Adriana laughs and informs Rex that she was doing research for a possible maternity line to add to \"Exposed\". She reassures Rex that she is not pregnant and if she were, she would talk to him immediately and they would make any decisions together.\n\nAdriana would later go to Paris, after a man named Jean-Pierre expressed interest in her work. It was later discovered that Adriana's trip was a set up by Dorian in order to keep her and Rex apart. Adriana has given Dorian an ultimatum: if she doesn't marry Rex, then she will cut Dorian out of her life. However, Adriana's attitude is seemingly based on jealousy towards Rex's ex-girlfriend Gigi Marasco rather than resentment towards Dorian. Adriana has taken on a darker attitude due to insecurity about Gigi and Rex. Gigi's son Shane, noticed Adriana's personality, and designed his comic book supervillain \"Evelyn Evil\" in Adriana's likeness.\n\nRex and Adriana marry on May 20, 2008. The wedding has a few ups and downs, including Gigi standing up and declaring her feelings for Rex, as well as the return of Brody Lovett, who was believed by everyone to be dead, as well as Shane's biological father. Brody was brought to Llanview by Adriana, in the hopes that Brody and Gigi would resume their previous relationship. Adriana later wises up to Dorian's involvement in Gigi's declaration of love, and trying to get Brody to leave Llanview, and lashes out at her, blaming Dorian for her problem with Rex, and hating the fact that she has become a manipulative schemer like her mother. She tells Rex the truth about all of her lies, with the exception of Rex being Shane's father, and leaves town for Paris to sort things out.\n\nGigi tracks a missing Rex down in Texas and finally tells him that he is Shane's father; soon Rex and Gigi discover that Brody has faked a paternity test, fearing that Gigi had disappeared and Shane would end up in foster care. On September 18, 2008, Rex tells Adriana over the phone that he wants a divorce after realizing that she had known about Shane's paternity all along and had even provided Brody with the means to fake the DNA test. Adriana returns on October 2, 2008 after Rex is shot."
