        "text": "Bitchy Bangs is Back and Luke’s Jig Is Up\n\nBoth OLTL and General Hospital were boring today so I decided to write about both for change.\n\nFirst off to Llanview (or Paris depending on the scene):\n\nOh, Adriana how I’ve missed you and I really enjoyed you messing with Gigi today. And who wears a plaid shirt while in Paris to begin with? You used to have better clothes Gigi. So what happened?\n\nDorian hired a man for Kelly because she doesn’t like the male company that Kelly keeps. Kinda can’t blame her for that one. But she should be more concerned about her daughter who is dating one of the Himbos.\n\nSo let me get this straight: Your aunt hiring a man for you to ummm…do as you please with is totally wrong. Yet having sex with your stepson in a church during a tornado is perfectly fine. Gotta love that messed up soap logic.\n\nWhat kind of gym has a steam room that men and women share? Kelly and Rex should just have crazy, wild sex right there in the steam room because that at least would create drama and angst unlike Rex and his neverending search for his parents and well, anything that Kelly has done since she returned. Afterall, Rex is supposedly a Buchanan so that would be right up Kelly’s alley.\n\nI wish Layla was still in Llanview. I’ve really missed her.\n\nCole is going to jail so Brandon Buddy can exit the show. I’m sure he will get his appeal when TPTB decide to recast Cole.\n\nNo Fords and No Todd. I love it when Christmas comes early.\n\nMeanwhile, in Port Charles:"
