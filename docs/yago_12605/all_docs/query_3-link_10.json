        "text": "Over the last 48 hours, remembrances have been pouring in on social media for the late Kamar de los Reyes (ex-Antonio Vega, One Life to Live). The actor passed away on Christmas Eve at the age of 56 after a short battle with cancer.\n\nAs we have previously posted, so many touching tributes have honored the life of de los Reyes and what he has meant to so many people, and what an extremely talented actor he was throughout his television and film career. At the time of his death, Kamar was taping new episodes for the sixth season of the CW’s All American, in his recurring role as Coach Montes.\n\nTwo stars who grew up with Kamar during his earlier years on ‘One Life’ were Melissa and David Fumero. The couple met while at the ABC soap opera, where she played Adriana Cramer and he played Cristian Vega. They have been married since 2007 and share two sons together. As for their beloved former castmate, Kamar also married his One Life to Live co-star, Sherri Saum (ex-Keri Reynolds) in 2007. The couple shared twin sons together. Taking to their Instagram accounts, Melissa and David reflected on the loss of their friend and former co-star.\n\nMelissa Fumero, who rose to fame in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, beautifully said in her remembrance to Kamar: “You took me to my first work event. It was a Latino event. From the very beginning you instilled in me the importance to show up for the community. To show up for your people. This goodbye is too hard. But I will pick myself up and believe and have hope and stay positive and laugh and love my loved ones hard and do my best to spread fuckin joy because that’s what you did everyday. We love you Kamar. We always will.” The actress included some very heart-tugging images along with her post illustrating the close bond she had with de Los Reyes (see below).\n\nDavid Fumero who played Kamar’s on-screen brother, and went on to be featured in Starz Power, and other numerous primetime roles, expressed: “Kamar De Los Reyes…Can’t say goodbye my friend. But thank you for your love and wisdom. For the many laughs that would brighten my days. You’re a legend and a warrior in my book. I will keep my ears open for your whispers that I know will come. Rest In Power…Till we meet again my brother! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽”\n\nFumero’s Instagram post included very poignant photos of both he and Kamar together and with others including: former WWE champion, Hulk Hogan and their One Life to Live on-screen mom, Patricia Maucieri (ex-Carlotta Vega).\n\nYou can check out the Melissa and David’s tributes to Kamar below.\n\nWhat are you remembrances of Kamar, David and Melissa from One Life to Live? What did you think of these beautiful tributes to a man gone too soon? Share your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nOn Monday, during a press conference held by Los Angeles County prosecutors, two of the four suspects in the death of Johnny Wactor (ex-Brando Corbin) have now been officially charged with the murder of the beloved General Hospital actor.\n\nThe charges were announced by L.A. County District Attorney George Gascón and interim police chief Dominic Choi. The suspects charged with Wactor’s murder are Robert Barceleau and Sergio Estrada, both 18.\n\nThe most serious charge is for Barceleau, who was charged with murder, including a special circumstance allegation of killing in the commission of a robbery, which could lead to a life-without-parole prison term. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both with allegations he was armed with a firearm.\n\nEstrada, was also charged with murder, but without the special circumstance allegation. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both also allegedly while armed with a firearm. Estrada is also facing a life sentence.\n\nThe two other suspects were also formally charged, Leonel Gutierrez, also 18 was charged with attempted robbery and grand theft by embezzlement, both with allegations he was armed. Meanwhile, Frank Olano, 22, was charged with being an accessory after the fact to the killing, along with receiving stolen property and three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Barceleau, Estrada and Gutierrez remain in custody in lieu of $2 million bail each, while Olano must post a $1 million bail.\n\nWactor was killed May 25 in the early morning hours in downtown Los Angeles after his shift as a bartender at the Level 8 bar/restaurant. He, and co-worker, Anita Joy were walking to their cars, when Wactor came upon the thieves trying to steal the catalytic converter from his vehicle and was shot in the chest and died in Joy’s arms.\n\nSo, are you glad Johnny’s murderers have been officially charged? Share your thoughts via the comment section below. But first, you can check out the press conference from Fox 11 Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sunday, the world learned of the passing of veteran actor, John Aprea who died back on August 5th at the age of 83.\n\nAprea appeared on Another World in two roles throughout his career – Lucas (Luke) Castigliano from 1989 to 1993, and Alexander Nikos from May 1997 to January 1998.\n\nIn story, Lucas was one of the loves of Felicia Gallant’s (Linda Dano) life.
