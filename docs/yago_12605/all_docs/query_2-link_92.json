        "text": "R24 Y&R had plenty ... in the 90s but has been unwatchable the last 10 years or so\n\nDAYS had some brilliant character driven stuff when Bill Bell was headwriter in the 70s that as TIME magazine set in their cover story, \"sets it apart from the other serials\". Too bad SONY won't release the old DAYS episodes from the 70s, it was EVERYTHING great about soap opera without the cheap gimmicks, ironically DAYS would become mostly about those cheap gimmicks by the time the 90s rolled around.\n\nThank you James Reilly\n\nI loved OLTL when it was great, I loved it when it stank, I loved it when it was new, I loved it when it was old. It was a constant in my life, while I grappled with life's many vicissitudes. There were always Jenny and Karen and Viki and Megan and, yes, even Tina and Dorian to root for. And there were Cordero and Jon Russell and Christian and Brody to drool over.\n\nR54 Marty was not a major character at the time. She became one because of the impact of the story. When it began the major characters were all surrounding the story. Kevin mostly and Nora. But that made it the great story. It was an umbrella story that involved the majority of the canvas. I remember a preview that even stated \"What do you do in a town divided?\"\n\nWhat also made the story great was the Marty was, at first, unsympathetic. She had been mean to Andrew and a spoiled rich girl. So the audience had to come to terms with a mean girl who was the victim of a horrific crime. Hillary B. Smith was great in this story and the Kevin at the time (Kirk Geiger?) did a serviceable job as the innocent man accused. The story had texture. Making Todd sympathetic in later years and having him kidnap a amnesiac Marty and her falling in love with him made a mockery of the earlier glory of the story.\n\nHowarth was great with Slezak! They had that rare chemistry. Besides Strasser no one made Viki as interesting of a character. Howarth made all his co-stars great sad we never got a reunion with Howarth and Haskell who were pure gold together!!!!\n\nTina and Gabrielle were the best duo! Perfect blend of camp and dramatic hijinks.\n\nTSJ was a good recast. He really made Todd a sociopath and wasn't afraid to be the bad guy.\n\nThe Marty gang rape SL was one of the show's best a true impactful umbrella story that effected the whole town. I liked Todd and the role he played on the show. The Todd show made more sense than the John Mcbain show in the 2000's. Didn't like seeing so many core characters go missing or be sidelined in the 90s like Tina, Cord, Max, Gabrielle, Kevin, Joey...\n\n[quote]Carlivati started off very promising at OLTL, but something went very wrong. But there was a lot wrong over there between Frank and Frons bullshit.\n\nAll smoke and mirrors with Cartini r38. Ron in particular only held out a lot of empty promises (key word here empty) of refocusing on core families and respecting history when all he actually did was rehash and piss all over history with his own campy soap take on stories that were originally treated seriously.\n\nIt didn't take OLTL viewers to catch on that Ron's camped up rehashes weren't actually going anywhere and I can't think of a single one of those stories that didn't end with a resounding thud.\n\nThe problem with Ron Carlivati was that he couldn't actually tell a coherent, original story on his own. All he could do borrow a premise from the past and fuck it up royally. One of the most egregious examples of that was the Todd/Marty rapemance. Or the AIDS quilt story as opposed to RC's moronic Big Gay Wedding storyline that totally buried the viable gay pairing of Kish.\n\nI agree he's a better fit at DOOL where camp has ruled for many years now but he never has or ever will be a competent HW even for soaps.\n\nI gave up when they started fucking with the Victor Lord timeline. What happened between Victor and Dorian(when played by Nancy Pinkerton) wasn't just tenet it was fucking gospel. It was the events of that story line that caused the unfolding of so much of what happened on OLTL. If you watched it from that far back I don't think you couldn't help but being disgusted at the rewrite of Victor and changing everything that happened.\n\nThe scene when Dorian held the old man's medication from him explaining that she always hated him, knew Tony was his son, etc etc etc was top notch. Very few OLTL scenes have ever come close.\n\nRon always does good in the first year to 18 months of his gig, because he's able to see what needs to be moved where, and address immediate needs. Some writers are very good at this. It could be argued Hogan Sheffer did a good job of this at ATWT.\n\nIt's only when that first honeymoon period ends that the real test comes. And with Ron, so far at both OLTL and GH, when he's hit that 12-18 month period, he had problems sustaining story, and would destroy canon/characters for cheap, quick fix splashes. He also leans entirely too much on the crazy lady crutch. You'd think Almodovar was writing his shows by how many crazy bitches and DID cases he has on his shows.\n\nI won't go into Kathy Glass troll mode BUT original Jenny, Original Brad, and Original Sam brought a spark of life back to OLTL. They were something special in daytime. It was really surprising that they'd all be gone in three years. It must have sucked for the writers and producers. They were finally able to bring in some young people who fit and they were rewarded with ratings. Lets not forget Jackie Zeman as Lana. Kathy Glass really was something special though. This will be my last post about her LOL.\n\nEach actress who played Tina made the character a little bit of their own. I was happy with all the actresses who played her. I liked each one. The Kevins and Joeys were disposable. I can't really remember a single one. I do remember the friend of theirs though that was getting hit on by Niki. Oh my. Dorian had the most impact on a recast. Brynn Thayer made Jenny a forever back burner character. Brynn was a fine actress but the writing made it kind of hard to give a shit about her Jenny. She was the female Larry. Of course the recast of Karen took the character a whole other way. I kind of liked all the Cassies too. Don't forget Slay was a recast Victoria. Gillian Spencer was the first Victoria. Like Pinkerton's Dorian, Gillian's Victoria was a bit creepy. When she played her Vicki she wasn't such a goody goody and her Nicki Smith was VERY creepy.\n\nYes, I believe Clint Richie was one of the many young actors who Henry Wilson found, r177. I'm pretty sure he was mentioned in the bio of Henry Wilson, but not in any detail. It's been a decade or more since I read the book, so I can't remember every detail.\n\nAs for the tractor accident, apparently it really changed Clint. Really fucked with his mind while he recuperated. Seems like his girlfriend left him shortly after the accident. Not sure if he was still with Candace Early at that point, but I do remember an interview with him when he came back to OLTL where he sounded very bitter about his girlfiend dumping him.\n\nAs I recall, the show allowed the Viki-Sloane pairing to progress in natural time (slowly) to accommodate Clint Richie's time away from the show while he recovered. Otherwise, the pairing would have happened much quicker.\n\nDan Gautier was handsome, to be sure. Tim Gibbs also handsome, but an annoying actor to watch. Too full of himself. Of the Joeys, I most enjoyed Nathan Fillion and Don Jeffcoat. Of course, Tom Degnan had a great body, as did Bruce Michael Hall. I remember a scene in which Bruce Michael Hall and John Paul Lavoisier were in towels in a locker room....it was extremely homo-erotic but, of course, they didn't go there. Chris McKenna was just a kid at the time but he turned out to be one hot stud. Y&R missed a great opportunity to pair him with Greg Rikkaart and make soap's first gay male super couple.\n\nR154 soaps have been doing that for YEARS. You must if missed the James Reilly headwriting years of Days of Our Lives in the 90s? It was the gayest show on TV, GORGEOUS model type bare chested men in every scene who couldn't act, non stop camp storylines, demonic possession, Marlena being kept in a bird cage in the Paris underground tunnels by Stefano Dimera, Eileen Davidson playing five different characters, including a man!, ALL the women seemed to be written as catty and bitchy and looked great in the best fashion. There was even a black telekenetic town psychic introduced named Celeste Perrault, who would scream out \"I sense danger!\" and the room would shake and she was always dressed to the nines and had a new wig every other episode!\n\nRon Carlivati is at home as the headwriter of DAYS\n\nIt's been reported that DAYS is in talks to bring Erika Slezak on the show as Dr. Sandy Horton. Supposedly it's been going on for months now but Erika doesn't want to fully commit to moving to LA unless it's a long-term contract role. Ron Carlivati floated the idea to Ken Corday and suggested Slee over a year ago but DAYS is unsure of a lot of things regarding the character . Around the time he pitch3d his Abby multiple personality storyline, in fact Slee as Dr. Sandy Horton was supposed to figure into that storyline and help Abby and her alters, that was the original idea\n\nRon wanted to really refocus DAYS on the Horton's.\n\nR181- regarding Erika and Andrea. That infamous quote was from the SOD cover story of OLTL’s 20th anniversary. The cover was Tina and her men (Faux Bo, Cord and Max). Andrea was in a red dress and the men were in tuxes. In the feature, Erika said Tina (who was at her peak popularity at this point) was not a substitute or worthy replacement of Dorian. It definitely read harsh. But in other interviews, they always spoke highly of each other and even on The View’s special tribute show to OTL when it left ABC, they seemed to be very fond of each other. For what it’s worth.\n\nDoes anyone else remember Robin Strasser’s first exit from OLTL? There was a big send off for her at the hotel (oh god what was it called...?) and it just goes to show how much Rauch defanged Dorian because everyone came by to bid her a find farewell. I remember Wanda Wolek packing her a picnic basket or some shit. Even Clint and Viki came by to give her a hug. It was so weird. That was when the show spun solely around Tina and Viki.\n\nR219- is the cunt really necessary? Actually, I love that word, so it’s fine. I know patriarchs were a daytime trope and a certainly valuable one at that - but if we are talking “star billing” Erika Slezak was that in terms of storyline heft, air time, tenure and popularity. Asa was a major character but not of the magnitude of Viki and even Clint, Bo and Cord. It was just lazy to be like “let’s give star billing to the old white guy who plays a Texas oilman.”\n\nr226, actually r224 is absolutely right. Erika Slezak could never carry the show on star power because she didn't have star quality. For all intents and purposes, she should have been in Susan Lucci and Deidre Hall's league as a 'name' but it never happened for her. She may have had the Emmy wins but she never had the mainstream recognition that they enjoyed. That's why the show had Dorian and Tina to lift her up, because alone she did nothing for ratings, which plummeted after Andrea Evans left. It was Andrea's show, she was the Lucci of Llanview.\n\nYou have to judge the stars based on the actual show they’re in. And while she never matched Lucci’s mainstream recognition (she hosted SNL for god sake)- she was the absolute leading lady and biggest star and MVP of OLTL. What’s so funny about my defense of her is that I totally favored Andrea Evans for her camp and charisma, but Viki was the main character and the show revolved around her. She definitely deserved to be billed above Phil Carey. Period. End of story.\n\nCan we discuss Lee Halpern? She was so great at her peak. When Charles Sanders died in bed with her and she took on Elizabeth Sanders???? That was a great storyline and was a rare breakthru during peak the Viki/Tina era. I was disappointed when she abruptly left the show. I thought that actress was really strong. Looking back on it, she really was that strong woman of the 80s type. Not a shrinking violet, not an ingenue. Just very competent and together. And yes, she did start off as a madam, but was redeemed.\n\n[quote]Viki was the main character and the show revolved around her. She definitely deserved to be billed above Phil Carey. Period. End of story.\n\nNope.\n\nWhen that opening first debuted (December 1984), Asa was a dominant character on the show, and among the older folks of that generation, Phil Carey was much better known performer due to his background in mainstream movies and television. Slezak wasn't known outside of the soap world.\n\nI can see a case made for Erika in the 90s, when she was winning the bulk of her Daytime Emmys. But in the 80s Phil deserved that first shot.\n\nR255 and R256- there was NEVER a time on OLTL where Viki wasn’t front burner. Even during the golden era of Karen Wolek, it was Viki on trial for murder. Viki was on the show from day one, from Joe Riley to Clint- yes during 85/86 Paul Rauch became obsessed with her but she was always lead. And bigger than Asa. It isn’t about “who is bigger outside the soap world” you fucking idiots- it is who is the main star and main character of that particular soap universe. Viki over Asa. Any day of the week.\n\nWhen ABC cancelled OLTL, I hoped that they would kill Viki off... but in a very moving, poignant way. Basically the show would ultimately be revealed that it was Viki’s “One life to live” and when she was gone, so went the show. It would’ve been a great way to have legacy characters come back and bid her farewell, Jessica Tuck would be there to welcome her to heaven... so many good flashbacks. Dorian and Viki’s final goodbye scene... would’ve been AMAZING.\n\n[quote][R255] and [R256]- there was NEVER a time on OLTL where Viki wasn’t front burner. Even during the golden era of Karen Wolek, it was Viki on trial for murder. Viki was on the show from day one, from Joe Riley to Clint- yes during 85/86 Paul Rauch became obsessed with her but she was always lead. And bigger than Asa. It isn’t about “who is bigger outside the soap world” you fucking idiots- it is who is the main star and main character of that particular soap universe. Viki over Asa. Any day of the week.\n\nFirst, I've never said Viki wasn't ever front burner.\n\nSecond, Asa was just as big in the early 80s, when the \"Tour of Llanview\" intro debuted..\n\nAnd finally, if you think having a performer who is recognized outside of daytime isn't a big deal, you discredit all your other comments. (Although you had already done so by launching personal insults within a conversation about soap opera intros. I mean, get a grip. Honestly.)\n\nI recall a smug comment Erika Slezak made in a soap article where she said everybody who leaves OLTL thinks they are going off to become a big star and that it never happens for them. She was projecting her own garbage onto people, because she never had the courage to leave the show ... because we all know she would never have been able to cut it in primetime or movies.\n\nOh fuck all of ya - the ladies of the early 70's - Anna, Eileen, Carla, Vicki, Meredith, Julie and Cathy were great and all identifiable in some way. Sadie was in and out during this period. Then Dorian showed up with sister Melinda and the show in 1972./73 was SO good. I know there are tapes to show but I loved this show more than any other. Vicki was torn between Steve and Joe; Eileen was popping pills because her husband died; Julie was 'frigid' and drove hubby Mark (Tommy Lee Jones) into Dorian's arms. Carla was being romanced by Ed Hall. It was glorious.\n\nI just rewatched the 1985 opening. This is clearly a cast in transition. And Andrea Evans is there... buried in the 3rd batch just waiting to come out and own the show. Shelly Ralston didn’t know what hit her. What are the politics involved with those moves in the 80s? Does a producer bring you in and say “sorry Shelly, you used to follow Erika Slezak but we’re moving your composite to the 2nd to last group?” Or does her agent tell her??? I want to know.\n\nI just fell down the rabbit hole watching all the openings from 1985-1990. All with Peabo crooning to me about not finding the rainbow’s end. A couple things- Holly Gagnier was lovely as Cassie. Dare I say underrated. Second- at some point, the Gordon sisters (aka Sarah and Megan) pull up and take precedence over Gabrielle in that all important and prominent 2nd batch of cast photos. I’m sure that was a dark day for Fiona. I’m sure someone got ripped a new asshole by her that day. As they should’ve!!!\n\nThere are some characters that just write themselves and Gabrielle was one of them. You could tell the writers loved writing for her. She segued from story to story without missing a beat. Also, Fiona was maybe the best soap crier in history. She could turn on the water works like no one’s business. And her lovely accent. Oh! She and Andrea Evans were the best of that decade.\n\nI think the problem with Gabrielle's return was twofold - 1) the camp of Tomlin's OLTL was more cartoon than the camp of the 80s and 2) Max had been so decimated by that time that it wasn't the same character.\n\nThat being said, I thought Gabrielle fit in quite well after the initial problems. It was a damn shame they had to completely annihilate the Holden family to make room for those insipid McBains - but now I see this is Frank's MO.\n\nWhen Gabrielle came back to the show, she could have taken the Dorian role, since RS was not there at the time. There was no need to bring Dorian back if they had just kept Gabs as the fabulous divalicious bitch in town. They should have had her take over Dorian's mansion too. Then if AE as Tina had come back, we could have gotten the show back to being about Tina and Gabrielle, instead of Viki and Dorian.\n\nFor anyone who doubts that Erika Slezak had a petty and vicious streak:\n\n[quote]On why people leave Daytime: “Because they think they can do better somewhere else. And the track record isn't good. In the number of years I've been here, I've seen any number of people leave...”I'm gonna be a star'...and off they go. And two years later, they're back. Sometimes they come back, and almost without exception, it does not work when they come back. Andrea (Evans, ex-Tina) was the only exception.”\n\nR303 But, look where ES' picture is in the closing, her's is the biggest one right in the center, because she was the center of the show. That being said Philip Carey probably got to be first in the credits, because he was fulfilling the patriarch role on the show, and was well known from primetime tv. ES didn't mature into the show's matriarch until the late 1990's, at the earliest.\n\nThe funny thing is, Victoria Lord always SEEMED old, even in clips I've seen from the 70s. I think because Slezak gave off a sexless or asexual vibe (kind of like Julie Andrews). She was very reserve, staid and lacking in passion. That's probably why all of her 'alter egos' on the show seemed like ridiculous farce as opposed to anything that was truly compelling. She just didn't have any earthy or sensual appeal which is why somebody like Kim Zimmer wipes the floor with her as an actor.\n\nVikki always seemed \"older\" because that was what the character was supposed to be, she was supposed to a staid, tightly wound, old school WASP. Tina wasn't supposed to be that, SHE was the wild child. Dorian was different as well because she was a brash self-made career woman. Vikki was supposed to be the prim and proper old-school person, which is why Nikki Smith was shocking! If Tina, had developed an alter, her alter would have had to be like Vikki, because Tina's normal behavior was like Nikki.\n\nWhen writers murder a character by toilet, you know they have something against the actress.\n\nViki, Tina, and Dorian were wonderfully complementary. Viki, so repressed and damaged; Tina, so needing acknowledgement and love; and Dorian (the Strasser version, not the Pinkerton version), so angry at the world at the injustices done to her. Slezak, Evans, and Strasser played them so well -- it was like something out of Pirandello. They came together and apart so amazingly, primarily because of the actresses and not the writers, I would contend. Much of the rest of the show was entertaining, but these three were the lightning rod at the center. They gave the show its electricity. When they weren't on, or weren't interacting, the show was less. But when you lit up these three, the show made you laugh, cry, and cheer.\n\nI cannot imagine Malone had any ax to grind with Fiona. In fact, didn't he say he had wanted to write for Gabrielle since his first stint?\n\nI have a feeling this was more a Frons mandate - didn't Fiona speak out about the firing of James DePaiva and Al's death, etc? Sort of like the \"punishment\" Cady McClain got death by pancakes.\n\nIf Andrea Evans was the star of OLTL in the 80s then why didn't they immediately scoop her back up with a long-term contract when Evans returned to soaps in the early 2000s?\n\nInstead James Reilly, the extremely over the top former headwriter of Guiding Light and Days of Our Lives and a huge OLTL and AMC fan, got her for his new supernatural camp fest soap, Passions\n\nHe also got Robin Strasser over on Passions for a few years playing a witch named Hecuba\n\nR383 There are quite a few of the saddest, fattest people on earth who seem to just LIVE to do shit like that. There are a number of \"recreated\" show openings out there with sad computer mock-up programs.\n\nOne sad one was a remake of the mid 60s CBS interstitial/ID that said \"In Living Color.\" Some queen put her own voice on the remake.\n\n\"CBSSSSSSSSSSSS pressssenths this program in collah!\"\n\nPrinci always seemed to me to be doing a Robin Strasser imitation.\n\nI know that the three Buchanan actors were interviewed somewhere roughly around the beginning of the Gottlieb years and they hated either Princi or Strasser and complained about her, but I cannot remember if they wanted Strasser back and complained about Princi, or vice versa.\n\nAsa was one of the best characters in OLTL history if Phil Carrey wanted nothing to do with witchy bitchy Robin I’m sure she really was from Hell.\n\nI can’t help wonder how great OLTL would have been if AE Tina and Gabrielle stayed into the 90s. I think their dynamic could have been better than the Viki/Dorian feud.\n\nThe episodes surrounding “the letter” showcase how great the Viki, Dorian, Tina trio truly were!!!\n\nWish they had the guts to have made Joey Buchanan the gay character. Or even Rex when he came to town was rumored to be gay same goes for Paul Cramer.\n\nI wish Tina and Gabrielle had stayed into the 90s too r396. I just think they both gave the show such a light entertainment factor and that it could get so fucking grim during the Todd and Marty years, it needed the high spirited camp and comedy that AE and FH excelled at, even though Fi could do dark and tragic stories too, she always made them fun to watch.\n\nI was a fan of OLTL until its last few years or so. I hated Ron's vision of the show and I hated what Frons turned it into even more; both of them killed the show for me.\n\nAlthough I still wonder how that absolute POS GH is still on the air.\n\nR406 yup just like her headwriting stints on Days of Our Lives, just awful\n\nGary Tomlin and Christopher Whitesell got DAYS back on track after Dena nearly destroyed it the first time and then she was hired back only to destroy it again until Ken Corday fired her and hired Ron Carlivati, now at least it's watchable again\n\nDidn't Dena, Ron, Gary Tomlin, Christopher Whitesell and even Josh Griffith, ALL write for both OLTL and DAYS\n\nSoaps are SO incestuous\n\nDena had one mildly interesting story in the very beginning which was with Nora and Daniel Colson. Fans actually thought Nora would be getting a real storyline. Of course, after that reveal, HBS was put into exile.\n\nThe Santi mess was a huge bust, and that was under Malone. I think that story is what ultimately led to him going (and rightfully so).\n\nTina and Gabrielle's relationship was fascinating because they were really the first ever frenemies on television. Whatever one was plotting or trying to pull off, the other would invariably find out and try to use the information to her advantage. The end result was never one of open hostility but a kind of playful bitchiness, that just made them so much better than the boring Viki-Dorian dynamic with its broad strokes of heroine vs villainess. With Tina and Gabrielle, both had questionable morals, but they were there through each other's dramas and that is why they defined the show's most entertaining era.\n\nYeah Rex should have NEVER been made a Buchanan. Same goes for David. Both characters would have made more sense being at the very least Bi. Both hustler con-man opportunist jokester types. Doesn't surprise me if the actors were getting it on in real life.\n\nGigi was one of the worst characters of all time!!! Marcie a close second.\n\nTina & Gabrielle were complex frenemies more so than straight up enemies. I was always Team Lindsay I understood how she could hate Nora.\n\nR419 Well there is no reason that they couldn't be Buchanan and BI or gay. The strangest thing to me was when they made Nigel straight.\n\nI liked Gigi in Paris, TX, but she and her son got annoying after coming to Llanview. I did like her sister, Stacy, though. She reminded me of Tina or Alex, in a way.\n\nTo me Marcie was ok, as she sort of filled the Luna type role.\n\n[quote] I LOVED Luna, and have never understood the hate for her.\n\nMe too.\n\n[quote] Maybe, it was just because I liked Crystal Hunt as Lizzie Spaulding on GL, but I didn't think she was bad on OLTL.\n\nLoathed CH on GL, and hated her on OLTL too. She couldn't so much as fart convincingly.\n\nR450 I'm just about in complete agreement with your list, especially the 1,2,3 order. Except for one big thing: I'd cut it off after 3.... Strasser had some good years when she first came on, but for me it was all camp city once she returned. I only saw Tuck's last season, and I pretty much missed the Hutchison years, (sorry).\n\nHaving watched from 1970 to about 1980, Margaret Klenck was terrific.\n\nAnd Andrea Evans gets my vote for the greatest bad actress in daytime history, even over Susan Lucci. I used to call Andrea the Pia Zadora of daytime.\n\nOnly on this board could the most honored actress in daytime history, be considered to not even be the best actress on her show. Look I love Judith Light, and I would agree that she was great on OLTL, but I can't rank all these people against one another because Judith's six wonderful years on the show and two daytime Emmys cannot compare to Erika's 41 years of excellence, and six Emmys.\n\nStrasser was mesmerizing during the Malone years. Having been too young to fully remember her earlier run, I remember being glued to the screen during that whole Lord of the Banner story through the murder trial to the personalities. I know older/long-term viewers had a huge problem with the history/retcon used in this story, but to me at that time, it was stellar.\n\nI love all of you misguided people who judge a show based only on that time your were watching it and make silly lists about who's the best whatever based on limited and biased criteria. Slezak wasn't even the best Viki, let alone the best actress on the show. Maybe you should just stick to discussing storylines and stop with the best of lists.\n\nI don't agree R463. You can talk about storylines from when you watched, but best of lists are meaningless unless you take the show, in its entirety, into account. When doing best of lists you have to take the full 43 years into account, from July 15, 1968 until January 13, 2012. Unless you make clear that this is a best of list from 1985 until 1989.\n\nAnyone who saw Gillian Spencer play Viki would laugh at the idea that Slezak is the best anything.\n\n1. Light 2. Slezak 3. Haskell 4. Strasser 5. Smith 6. Tognoni 7. Tuck 8. Lozano 9. Hutchison 10. DePaiva\n\nI think this a good list but on pure charisma alone Andrea Evans belongs on here somewhere. Patricia Elliot was always great. I think Tognoni was very green yet charming at the start. Lozano and Strasser sometimes chewed scenery. Depaiva grew into her role. I liked Jensen Buchanan and Grace Phillips as Sarah too.\n\nEvery year for the past six years on January 13th I light my candles and pray to the Episcopal God (or was Andrew an Anglican Reverend?). Either way I pray for Marty that she and Patrick are finally living happily ever in peace, for Victoria that she gets more prune contracts, for the Ford Brothers to finally learn the joys of incest, for Jessica to finally get some job other than just being an alter and for the protection of the feet of\n\nAnyone remeber Angela Holiday and the Tabernacle of Joy? Always wished they gave her more to do.\n\nSame goes for Yasmine Bleeth as LeeAnn would be great if she came back to avange her son Duke's death and destroyed Kevin and all the Buchanan's in a Hell Hath No Fury like a Mother scorned.\n\nToo bad they didn't do anything with Casper Van Dien/Ty Moody? or Ryan Phillippe/Billy Douglas? So much untapped potential.\n\nR501 I agree, except I thought he and Viki were great in scenes with one another, honestly as much as others on here dislike her I think ES could play a scene with a mannequin and make it believable. I like how when RH came back they paired him with Blair and TSJ with Tea. I always liked RH's Todd with Blair, but not TSJ's and I hated Tea with RH's Todd, but loved her with TSJ's.\n\nThe sexiest soap scene I ever saw was on the OLTL online reboot. It was with TSJ already Victor Jr, I think that was his name when he stopped being Todd and Tea. He actually put his hands down the front of her panties while holding her with her back pressed tightly against him front. After that early on they stopped being daring except for throwing the word \"shit\" around every chance they got. It became ridiculous after a while, like a child trying to be wicked and only sounding foolish. I read they wanted to get the word \"fuck\" in but I don't know if they ever did. I don't remember.\n\nR517, R518 .... I think they screwed up. If the writer's theory was that DID was congenital, then it would have made more sense for Natalie to be the one afflicted with it. She was the one left in the hands Roxy and Mitch Lawrence, and would have undergone far more trauma growing up in a sick religious cult. It also would have made her intense mood swings more understandable. I also thought Melissa Archer was a better actress than Williamson.\n\nI liked TSJ's Todd but I agree with R504. Part of what made Howarth so powerful in the part was that he was there for the crime. He always played the shame even when he was doing something awful. The minute someone brought up the rape he broke a little. St John could slap it down arrogantly even when playing that color and it didn't have the same effect. Because he was separated from it by recasting.\n\nI still cannot believe they allowed that trash to happen where they essentially blamed Viki for Jessica getting abused.\n\nThey were so desperate to \"change\" the character to suit awful Bree Williamson, and no writer was ever creative enough to just write a complex Jessica rather than an alter.\n\nBut the worst crime is how it was played for laughs, especially under that hack Ron.\n\nBy the end of OLTL's run the show was a cartoon. The characters had been destroyed and the majority of the show was newbies. For me having both Rex and David be long lost Buchanan's made it clear that this show was a parody of it's former self. They couldn't even get Andrea Evan's returns as Tina right. Dorian had become a joke. The only character I enjoyed was Clint's transformation into Asa.\n\nGabrielle should have been revealed to be very much alive. Would have been amazing if Tina stumbled upon that fact. Always wished we got the Max/Gabrielle reunion we deserved. They wasted AE Tina on dealing with Tess and Natalie. She didn't even interact with Viki or Dorian. It was horrible. Tina was a ditz but she was cunning. They made her this bimbo that just wasn't age appropriate. Clearly Ron and Frank didn't get the Tina character. Always hated how Gabby got declawed too. These Frenemies should have driven storyline into the 90's!!!!\n\nRobin Strasser asked to be written out so she could have time off for back surgery. Problem was, she hadn't gone to other doctors for second opinions when she made that request. So, Ron writes her out, and THEN she starts going for second opinions and learns there are alternatives to reduce her back pain that don't involve surgery.\n\nSo, she decides not to have the surgery and then wants to be written back in. Ron is busy wrapping up the show and preparing for the Prospect Park online version and doesn't write her back in.\n\nWas that petty of him? Probably. This is Ron we're talking about, after all, so he's not above being petty. But he also went out of his way to give Dorian a nice send-off week of episodes.\n\nPersonally, I felt like Dorian had a proper send off five months before the show ended. I didn't especially miss her presence in those final weeks of show.\n\nr575, Frank didn't even bother asking Michael Storm ( Larry Wolek) to return one last time for the final shows on ABC: and he started on the show in 1969! He was the closest thing the show had to an original cast member, and Frank never even asked him. Michael Storm himself said he might have been willing to do it if asked, but he was never asked.\n\nFuck Frank.\n\nR592 The Saundra Santiago version of Carlotta with the hot fuckable sons. Dorian could have died and left her La Boulaie in her will, as a reward for all those countless hours spent hovering over the staircase railings, polishing. I know they aged the actress slightly when she took over the part, but she was really quite attractive and they could have easily given her softer and bouncier look if she continued."
