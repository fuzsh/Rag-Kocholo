        "text": "Used: See description\n\nDescription\n\nSigrid Undset won the Nobel Prize in 1928, Undset's historical novels emphasize men and women's struggle to find meaning in life. Included is a 2 page Annotated and Signed Typed originalManuscript by Undset, in which she reflects on World War II's impending violence and how to explain it to children: An interesting and poignant document by Undset written in behalf of her anti-totalitarian activities in the U.S. a the beginning of WWII. Undset was in Norway at the time of the German invasion. Her native town was leveled by German bombers and her son was killed as a guerrilla fighter by the Nazis. This essay deals, in the first part, with how children should be taught to distinguish between blind hatred from the hatred of free men for those who would suppress them. She talks about the effects of war on the human race. \"Of course, a child should not be brought up to hate anybody. But if a child is taught to hate, cruelty, lies, meanness, impurity, injustice, brutality, and to be honest, decent, kind, and willing to protect the weak and the defenceless, truthful and courageous, as I think every child ought to be taught. I cannot see how a child in any of the invaded countries in Europe or Asia can help hating with a corrosive hatred the invaders of his country. The Germans and the Japanese have seen to that.\" Very good. Unfortunately, still timely thoughts about world filled with war. Wikipedia: \"Sigrid Undset (20 May 1882 - 10 June 1949) was a Norwegian novelist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928. Undset was born in Kalundborg, Denmark, but her family moved to Norway when she was two years old. In 1924, she converted to Catholicism. She fled Norway for the United States in 1940 because of her opposition to Nazi Germany and the German invasion and occupation of Norway, but returned after World War II ended in 1945.\"."
