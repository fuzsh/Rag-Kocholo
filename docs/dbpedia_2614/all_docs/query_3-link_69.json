It is situated on the northwestern coast of the largest Danish island, Zealand (or Sjælland in Danish), on the opposite, eastern side of which lies the capital Copenhagen, 110 km (68 mi) away.\n\nQuick Facts Country, Region ...\n\nClose\n\nKalundborg is famous as the location of a large broadcasting facility, the Kalundborg Transmitter. The city was also home to the largest coal-fired power station in Denmark, the Asnæs Power Station, which started its transition to biomass in 2017.[3]\n\nKalundborg is mainly a trading and industrial town, but is also well known for its five-spired Church of Our Lady, which is closely associated with King Valdemar I and the Archbishop Absalon. The church itself is said to have been built by Absalon's brother, Esbern Snare.[citation needed]\n\nKalundborg is also the traditional seat of the aristocratic Lerche family. Their stately home, Lerchenborg, the best example of rococo architecture in Denmark, can be seen in the town's outskirts."
