Neither the German nor the English Wiki mentions any of this.

Undset (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigrid_Undset#Catholicism)? Do you think it hits the mark concerning the atmosphere in Norway and the reactions towards her conversion?

Vadstena is a very small town and probably perceived as relatively far away, given this was her first trip abroad for 7 years. So unless she had relatives in Vadstena, why would she choose to go there if not to visit a monastery or maybe as a pilgrimage in honor of Saint Bridget?\n\nRegarding her nunnery admission in 1928: Would she even have had the possibillity to become a vowed nun as she was/had been married? Even though they had separated by then, the Catholic Church would still consider her married before God and the church, I assume.\n\nI also recall that she continued to live at her house outside Lillehammer until she had to escape to Sweden and later the United States during WWII.\n\n12kjellika\n\nOct 13, 2008, 2:24 pm\n\n#11\n\nSigrid Undset went to Stockholm in 1921 to visit her sister Ragnhild (who was suffering from a rather bad state of health and a difficult family position). Sigrid stayed at a hotel for some days, and then she went to her proper destination, Vadstena Monastery (Does it still exist? Is it near Stockholm?). There she wanted to stay at Easter with contemplation and her newly purchased \"Birgittas åpenbaringer\" (Birgitta's Revelations).\n\nI'm not sure what it means that she was admitted a 'dominikanerinne' (I couldn't find an English name for it, sorry) of third degree, but I imagine she not ever became a vowed nun, probably according to the circumstances you mention.\n\nI'll continue the timeline (WWII, etc.) soon, I hope.\n\n#10\n\nI guess Sigrid Undset didn't join the convent (cf. my answer to #11).\n\nWhat is NPOV?\n\nI have read the English Wikipedia on S. Undset, and I'll have to consult a History of Norway to answer your question about the atmosphere in Norway in the 1920s. I don't have the time for it now, alas.\n\n13Annix\n\nEdited: Oct 13, 2008, 3:37 pm\n\nThanks for checking that out, Kjell! Yes the nunnery in Vadstena still exists. I just checked their homepage out. They have all of 13 nuns now ... I used to live not so far from there, so I've actually visited the monastery with my school a long time ago. Vadstena is a given day trip for the schools in the area as the town carries a lot of medieval history. It is located about 200 kilometers southwest of Stockholm, on the east shore of lake Vättern. At Undset's time there were railroads going all the way there from Stockholm.\n\nETA: As a matter of fact, there are two nunneries in Vadstena now. As the town has a total population of 5000 or so, the convents are rather hard to miss ... The second convent, however, did not yet exist in the 1920's. Also, that one started out Lutheran but converted to catolicism a couple of decades ago, so even if it had been there it might not have had the same attraction to Sigrid Undset if she was leaning toward turning catholic.\n\nAnother intresting thing about Vadstena with respect to Kristin Lavransdatter, is that the royal Folkunga (aka Bjälbo) dynasty, that Lavrans supposedly descended from were originally from Bjälbo, not far from Vadstena. The \"Bjälbo Dynasty Palace\" is still there in central Vadstena. Maybe Sigrid Undset was looking for a little inspiration for her writing there as well?\n\n14GirlFromIpanema\n\nEdited: Oct 13, 2008, 3:42 pm\n\nI found something about the \"third degree\": As I suspected, it is something outside the regular Dominican order, called \"the Third Order\", a lay movement:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Order_of_Saint_Dominic\n\n\"The Third Order as it exists to-day can be divided into two categories: regular, i.e. comprising Tertiaries, whether men or women, who live in community and wear the habit externally; and secular, i.e. whether married or single, cleric or lay, who live their lives like others of their profession, but who privately take up practices of austerity, recite some liturgical Office, and wear some symbol of the Dominican habit.\"\n\nHere is an official site: http://curia.op.org/en/index.php/about-us/laity\n\nRE: NPOV: It should be POV (point of view), after re-reading my own message above.

The Third Order (currently referred to as Lay Fraternities of St. Dominic) is canonically part of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) together with friars and nuns. When Sigrid Undset 7 March 1928 (four years after becoming a Catholic) promised to live according to the Rule of the Third Order Secular (revised a few years before, in 1923), she thus committed herself to a kind of life recommended to all Christians, to all Catholic laity - but inspired and directed by Dominican saints, Dominican tradition, Dominican friars and Dominican sisters.\n\nWhen her biographer Tordis Ørjasæter tried to make sense of it all and made Sigrid Undset into some kind of nun, she was mistaken about this.\n\nSee my article (in Norwegian, I'm afraid - but I suppose you can make some sense of it using Google translate or something) on the subject here: http://legdominikaner.wordpress.com/2010/02/27/sr-olave-sigrid-undset-t-o-p/"
