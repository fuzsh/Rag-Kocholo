        "text": "The paper discusses selected reactions to the Nobel Prize for Literature awarded to Olga Tokarczuk. The author focuses on the dispute about the legitimacy and justification of the Swedish Academy’s decision, highlighting the sceptical opinions, in some cases challenging the Academy’s members’ verdict. Referring to a book by James F. English on cultural prizes, the author recalls the role of public controversies as an essential tool of influencing the general public. He also compares the situation of two winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature (Olga Tokarczuk – for 2018, Peter Handke – for 2019), announced on the same day. Concluding, the author seeks to present the most important aspects of the dispute on the position and influence of Tokarczuk’s literary output.\n\nThe Stella Prize was designed to address the field-wide discrimination against women’s writing. To assess the prize’s potential impact, this paper examines the text lists for VCE English (the final year of high school in Victoria, Australia) from 2003-2014, and analyses the data to assess the relationship between gender, prizes and consecration by the education system. These results are discussed in the context of gender in contemporary literary culture and Bourdieu’s theories of literary production, particularly his ‘circuits of legitimation’: ‘systems of sponsorship, evaluation, and consecration by means of which power euphemizes itself as merit (as intrinsic and proper rather than imposed and arbitrary) and thereby secures its symbolic efficacy’ (Bourdieu 1990, 66-67). A prize exclusively for women, such as the Stella, ensures that a female-authored book will enter the public discourse every year as a prize-winner. If there is a direct link in the data between prize-winners and books studied in high schools in Victoria, this will go some way to prove the comment of Stella Prize founding patron Ellen Koshland, that the Stella Prize is a ‘landscape changer’ for Australian literature.\n\nThe paper discusses selected reactions to the Nobel Prize for Literature awarded to Olga Tokarczuk.

This quote by Fabrizio Moreira holds good for men but for women this dream posses many challenges before it is fulfilled. Women are multifaceted and perform a significant role in society. Across the world women have their challenges to face in this man\"s world. In India women are considered as the goddess from the ancient time however, it is also true that they are not treated as goddess. Considering them as goddess alone is not enough, it needs positive continuous effort and participation of both men and women to really bring women empowerment. Initially women were confined to domestic chores and kept within the four walls of the house. Gradually women started getting educated and as the rate of literacy in women increased there has been some progress. Women since ages have expressed their felling, thoughts, anger, experience and anxiety through their writing not only in English but also in other languages.. This paper is an attempt to explore the various genres of women\"s writing across the world to understand the life of women and also the manner in which they were portrayed in literature. This paper also tries to make a comparative study of the writings in India with other countries both in the past and present in an attempt to know how successful we have been in achieving women empowerment."
