        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nWhile looking through something I was surprised to find that women on stamps were one of the most popular topical areas.\n\nSo, it seems fair that there should be a thread for this.\n\nTo start with, the only two examples I had handy- my avatar stamp and a semi-postal from German Berlin.\n\nPost by cjd on\n\nThat Greta Garbo stamp is a work of art.\n\nIt would be a cliche to go right to the Grace Kelly stamp, so,\n\nshoot me. At least I went for the Monaco version rather than the U.S. issue. Slania's artwork is basically the same, but I like the color of the Monaco version a bit better. And as long as we're on Monaco, a Europa issue with Grace:\n\nPost by tomiseksj on\n\nI had assumed that the first woman featured on a U.S. stamp would have been Martha Washington; however, it was Spain's Queen Isabella on the 1892 $4 Columbian shown below (I can't afford one of my own so the image was taken from www.gradedstamps.com/gallery/search.php?page=search&task=det_item&item_id=24664).\n\nMartha has the distinction of being the first American woman featured on a U.S. stamp -- the 8c violet black issue of 1902 (Scott 306).\n\nPost by tomiseksj on\n\nMartha Washington would again be the subject of a U.S. stamp with the issuance of this 4c yellow brown perf. 11 regular issue stamp on January 15, 1923 (Scott 556).\n\nThis design would also appear on 5 other stamps of the era (Scott 585, 601, 636, 662 and 673).\n\nPost by Perfs14 on\n\nNot really sure if these qualify as real stamps, they may be illegals. They concern the art work of Fritz Willis(1907 - 1979). Willis handled ad work for Pepsi, Quality Papers, Max Factor, Purex, Sunkist, Crown Zellerbach, SpringMaid Sheets and others. He also did story work for Esquire, Saturday Evening Post, Redbook, Collier's, and covers for Ice Follies programs from 1952-1969. At least one movie poster, \"On Our Merry Way.\" An author himself, he wrote instruction books for Walter Foster (Art Secrets and Shotcuts, The Nude, Faces and Features, The Model, and a number of children's books (Cancan, Jelly and George, Muffin, Me Too, Amber - the Story of a Good Little Dog). His 15-year stint of Artists's Sketchbook and other calendars for Brown & Bigelow made him one of the last pin-up greats.\n\nIf interested further, just do an image search on Google.\n\nThe image I have, without scanning another, was \"sanitized\" as a request from another forum admin. Since I am not sure on Jacks feelings about this, I thought that I would err on the side of caution.\n\nPost by Perfs14 on\n\nAnd you cannot have a topic on women on stamps without the face that has been photographed, printed, stamped, sculpted, filmed more that any other in the history of the world...\n\nQEII\n\nPost by Ryan on\n\nI have seen the resurrection of old threads called \"necroposting\" elsewhere, implying that it's a bad thing. I think the exact opposite, it's a great thing when old threads are found again and has new posts added to it, that way I get to look at the old posts one more time!\n\nRyan"
