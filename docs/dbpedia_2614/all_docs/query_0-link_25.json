        "text": "The job is the result of a good collaboration between a private architectural firm and the Royal Academy's architectural education in Kalundborg.\n\nBy journalist Sonja Husted Rasmussen\n\nEline Kristiansen is very happy\n\nShe has got a study-relevant job at the design studio of architect Dan Betak DLB ARCHITECTS in Holbæk and therefore takes the train to Holbæk several times a week and later returns to Kalundborg. She was hired on March 1, so far 8 hours a week, maybe it will be more hours eventually, but only if it fits in with the studio. This is very important, Dan knows from when he himself was in education.\n\nHe attended an open house at the Royal Academy's architectural education in Kalundborg and was highly motivated to find a student who might want to make the trip to Holbæk and become part of a small design studio and all that that entails.\n\nHe contacted the architectural education in Kalundborg, and Eline was quick to respond. Study jobs must be advertised on the Royal Academy's website, but the administrative staff in Kalundborg are happy to help pass the word on to the students.\n\n- It's great to have the opportunity to get relevant work assignments, to develop myself and learn something about working life as an architect and thus gain experience that can benefit me when I have to apply for a job as an architect one day.\n\nThat's what Eline says in sounding Norwegian. She is Norwegian and comes from the vicinity of Oslo. It was difficult to get into the architectural education in Norway, and therefore she applied to Denmark, and she has absolutely no regrets.\n\nPioneers at the old station\n\nEline is happy that it was the Royal Academy's newly established architecture course in Kalundborg, because here, together with the other students, she has been given a unique opportunity to help shape the place of education, down to the smallest details.\n\nWhen the team of a dozen students moved into the old station building in Kalundborg, which previously also housed Restaurant Fjorden, there was nothing, NOTHING.\n\nPart of the students' learning has therefore been about finding out how to live in and furnish a building that was not intended or designed for an architectural education. The students have been involved in furnishing the kitchen, which is used extensively for both communal dining and more outward-looking activities such as Open House. In addition, they have made wooden tables for the library themselves, and they have been hunting in Kalundborg's thrift stores for plates, cutlery, mugs and cups, and part of the education's service comes from the now closed hotel Ole Lunds Gaard.\n\nYes, Eline, together with the others, has helped to leave her mark on the surroundings.\n\nHousing community and student café\n\nEline has settled in well in Kalundborg, and this is not least due to the fact that she has moved in with four other students in a house on Lundevej. The roommates get on well together, and right now they are in the process of realizing the plans to plant a kitchen garden.\n\nThey also participate in the student cafe's events. Here, the students, who also come from Absalon vocational college, cook together in Restaurant Fjorden's old kitchen, and afterwards they all eat downstairs in the association SYMB's premises, have fun and perhaps play table tennis and various board games.\n\nStudy town Kalundborg\n\nThe student café is a visible result of the work in the Studieby Kalundborg working group, where Kirsten Hauge, who is the department coordinator at the Royal Academy's architectural education in Kalundborg, is a member. The group works to make Kalundborg better and more attractive to be in for young people. The group also includes representatives of Kalundborg Municipality's settlement team, and one of the architecture students has been given a job starting the student café and creating a website for students and for people moving to Kalundborg.\n\nThe architectural education in Kalundborg is also part of two subgroups in Studieby Kalundborg that work to provide student jobs, one with the aim of providing emergency jobs for students who come from countries outside Europe and who cannot cope financially without a job, the other is working more long-term to find a job, and that group includes, among others, a representative of Kalundborg Jobcentre.\n\nBicycle markets\n\nThe contact with the local associations has been an advantage, among other things, at the bicycle markets, which first Absalon and now also the architecture education organize. Here, citizens can sell used bicycles to the students, and prior to the sale, the bicycles are checked by the cycling club.\n\nThere is a bicycle market on the program again for August, and institute coordinator Kirsten Hauge hopes that the citizens of Kalund still have old, usable bicycles in the garage. In the first two markets, supply corresponded to demand.\n\nThe architect and artificial intelligence\n\nThe student job with Dan Betak meant that the boss invited his intern to the annual meeting of Danish Architectural Firms on 18 April in Copenhagen.\n\nAfter the ordinary general meeting, there was a presentation on artificial intelligence, and here the participants got an insight into the importance of the use of artificial intelligence for the work of architects.\n\nEline was happy to be involved, and the shared experience gives rise to the subject being brought up for discussion at home in the design studio.\n\nEline is not daunted by the prospect that artificial intelligence might make the profession she is currently training for redundant:\n\n- But it is important that we learn to use it, she says.\n\nDan Betak adds by saying that AI, Artificial Intelligence, is becoming very important for the architecture industry, and if you don't understand what it is and actually use it, there is a big risk that the industry will lag behind.\n\nHowever, he also has a positive story about how it can go. A couple of customers had bought a program with AI based on the opinion that there was no reason to use an architect. They came back to the architect and said they didn't want to mess with that program themselves. They needed an advisor:\n\n- The architect has the important task of understanding the technology and using it. You have to make it to your advantage instead of fearing that it will take your job, he says, and Eline Kristiansen agrees.\n\nShe is now in full swing with her studies, which after 5 years (3 years for the bachelor's degree - 2 years for the master's degree) will bring her out on the other side as a fully qualified architect - and she can stay in Kalundborg during the entire course, because the master's degree can also be taken here.\n\nKirsten Hauge\n\nhas been employed as department coordinator at the Architecture course in Kalundborg since it started in September 2023.\n\nKirsten has previously been a school secretary at Special Center Sigrid Undset and then a management consultant at Absalon University of Applied Sciences. She has extensive knowledge of Kalundborg and the town's associational life, and she uses this actively in her position as institute coordinator at the Royal Academy.\n\nArchitecture student Eline Kristiansen working with Dan Betak, DLB ARCHITECTS in Holbæk."
