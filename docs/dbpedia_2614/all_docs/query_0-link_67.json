Therefore, the logic of obtaining a result on this concern is first to see how different forms and forces of the universe have rationed between divinity and matter/universe. In this part, the scientists have differences of opinion on the idea of the universe and the existence of all its different elements and forms. How mysteriously the universes, Sun, moon, stars, the earth, water, animals, plants and human beings were created by the will of the Supreme from nothingness? In a way the Ultimate Being has gifted the universe/nature with the capability of ruling all, seeing everything and controlling, even determining facts by connecting all together with an Ultimate. An attempt is made to prove the undeniable ...\n\nAfter an extended reflection on how I came to value exploring the interfaces of science and theology, this paper explores three of my recent areas of research in the field. The first is the area of natural theology, which is here presented as a natural and potentially productive interface between science and theology, with the potential to catalyze and inform discussion between these two disciplines. The second is the raft of questions raised by the \"New Atheism\" of writers such as Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett, which offer a challenge to theology to offer a more persuasive reading of the nature and limits of science. The third is the intellectual difficulties raised by interdisciplinarity, in particular the observation that different disciplines-such as individual natural sciences and Christian theology-rest on quite different understands of methods, norms, and investigative procedures."
