Janet Garton Norwich\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nSeries Foreword The aim of the Women in Context series is to present a countryby-country survey of women's writing from the beginnings of the struggle for emancipation until the present day. It will include not just feminist writers but women's writing in a more general sense, incorporating a study of those working independently of or even in direct opposition to the feminist aim of greater autonomy for women. While the principal emphasis is on literature and literary figures, they are placed in the context of the social, political and cultural development without which their position cannot be properly understood, and which helps to explain the differing rates of progress in different areas. The volumes therefore combine survey chapters, dealing with women's place in the public and private life of a given period, with more in-depth studies of key figures, in which attention will be focused on the texts. There is no attempt at encyclopaedic completeness, rather a highlighting of issues perceived as specifically relevant by women, and of writers who have influenced the course of events or made a significant contribution to the literature of their day. Wherever possible, parallels with other countries are drawn so that the works can be placed in an international perspective. Modern critical currents are also taken into account in relating feminist criticism to recent critical theory. Until quite recently women's writing has been virtually excluded from the literary canon in many countries; as a result there is often a dearth of information available in English, and an absence of good translations. Women in Context represents a move to remedy this situation by providing information in a way which does not assume previous knowledge of the language or the politics of the country concerned; all quotations are in English, and summaries of central texts are provided. The general reader or student of literature or women's studies will find the volumes a useful introduction to the field. For those interested in further research, there is a substantial\n\nxii\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nbibliography of studies of women's writing in the country concerned and of individual authors, and of English translations available in modern editions. Janet Garton\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhy a volume on Norwegian women writers? Norwegian literature is an area to which not even the most informed general reader has had much access. Ibsen is an internationally acclaimed dramatist (without, often, being much associated with Norway at all); Knut Hamsun is known to some; but of women writers, none but Sigrid Undset has ever achieved noteworthy success in the English-speaking world. Like Selma Lagerlöf in Sweden, Edith Södergran in Finland, Karen Blixen in Denmark, she seems an isolated figure; yet behind each of these writers lies a rich and diverse tradition which is in many cases only now becoming available to English readers through the medium of translation. The Scandinavian countries are often held up today as models of liberated thinking and radical legislation as regards women's role in the family, in employment and in politics; and the admiration is justified. Yet behind these achievements lies a long struggle, originating in a form of society which in the early nineteenth century was as male-dominated as any in Europe. In Norway the conflict was exacerbated by the fact that the country itself was struggling into independence in the first part of the century. Unlike Denmark and Sweden, with centuries of independence behind them, Norway had been for hundreds of years a protectorate under the Danish crown, and even during the whole of the nineteenth century it was partially dependent on Sweden. During the years after independence from Denmark in 1814, Norway was gradually evolving its own system of government and its own distinct literary tradition; and the issue of women's rights was one which emerged slowly. The major woman writer in mid-nineteenth century Norway, Camilla Collett, would ruefully compare her own country's progress in such matters with that of Great Britain and the United States, and hold up John Stuart Mill as a model to her own countrymen. In literature too, women were\n\nxiv\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nfor a long time practically invisible, despite the fact that creative writing enjoyed enormous prestige in the new nationalism of the nineteenth century. Norway's men of letters were regarded not just as entertainers but as representative national figures, guardians of the national spirit. Yet until the last couple of decades of the century, one looks in vain for well-known female literary figures; in an epoch which in English literature produced Jane Austen, Charlotte and Emily Bronte and then George Eliot, there is only one woman writer who is pre-eminent in Norwegian literature, and that is Camilla Collett herself.1 The last two decades of the nineteenth century, however, saw the founding of groups dedicated to the cause of liberation for women, and particularly to winning the vote; and women began to play an increasingly public role in literary and cultural debate. Camilla Collett, who came to public attention with her novel Amtmandens D0ttre (The District Governor’s Daughters) in 1854—55, became the first of several women writers to contribute both in fiction and in polemic utterances to the debate about women's role in society and about sexuality and the double standard, which reached a pitch of vociferousness bordering on hysteria in Scandinavia as a whole in the 1880s and 1890s. Once the Women's Liberation Movement in Norway got going, it moved comparatively quickly. It had its share of frustrations, but nevertheless succeeded, without resorting to the extreme measures to which the British suffragette movement was driven, in winning universal suffrage in 1913. Norway was only the second European country to give all women the vote, after Finland in 1906; Denmark followed in 1915, Sweden not until after Britain in 1921. For a time Norway was in the vanguard, acclaimed by American liberationists who did not achieve universal suffrage for the whole of the USA until 1920. (All the Protestant countries of Northern Europe were, of course, much earlier than the Southern Catholic countries in according this privilege to women; countries like France, Spain and Italy had to wait until after the Second World War.) 2 After the winning of the vote, there was something of a lull in liberationist activity in Norway, as in many other countries; important as was its symbolic significance, it did not radically alter the structures of power or the programmes of the political parties,\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nand women's direct influence in public life did not increase to any marked extent.3 It was not until 1924 that the first woman was elected to the Norwegian Parliament, and the Church, the legal profession, industry and finance remained solely the preserve of men. Legislation to improve women's social standing, begun in the nineteenth century, proceeded slowly; but the economic depression of the 1930s and the upheaval of the Second World War, with the German occupation, focused attention elsewhere. It was not until the late 1960s that there began the surge in feminist agitation which resulted in a degree of participation in public life at the highest level and a real equality of opportunity in most fields, enshrined in law, which is second to none in the world. If there was a slackening in the rate of women's political achievements in the earlier part of the twentieth century, the same cannot be said of women's writing; from the 1880s onwards, Norwegian literature has produced a number of literary figures who would be as well known internationally as George Sand or George Eliot had they written in French or English. And the last generation in particular has seen women writers becoming a major force in literary life, responsible for much of the most exciting work being written. The majority are still, as they have always been, writers of fiction; but they have made significant contributions to drama and poetry as well. Feminist literary criticism has emerged as a discipline in Norway since the early 1970s, and has attracted some of the best talents amongst researchers. The majority of research has adopted the historical-biographical approach, the so-called ‘Anglo-American’ method, undertaking the task of rewriting literary history in order to rediscover the lost tradition of women writers, along the lines of Elaine Showalter’s A Literature of Their Own,4 or re-evaluating the work of well-known authors from a fresh perspective, as in Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar’s The Madwoman in the Attic.5 But there are also adherents of the ‘French’ school of linguistic criticism, which starts from the premiss that it is impossible for women writers and critics to liberate themselves from the strictures of the male tradition unless they first reinvent language to embody the multiplicity of the feminine.6\n\nxvi\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nLittle criticism in English about Norwegian women's writing exists, beyond a few articles on authors like Sigrid Undset or Cora Sandel.7 This makes it difficult to refer English speakers to secondary reading, much of which is in Norwegian. Part of the reason for this has been the lack, until very recently, of any substantial body of translated works. Sigrid Undset is unique in being the only Norwegian woman writer whose major works were translated not long after they were written — no doubt in part due to the award of the Nobel Prize. Twenty-two of her books had been published in English by the time of her death in 1949. Otherwise only Cora Sandel made any impact before the last few years, thanks to the indefatigable efforts of Elizabeth Rokkan, who translated five of her novels in the 1960s. In the last decade, however, there has been a considerable change, due largely to the enterprise of a few small publishing houses in Britain and America, and to the Norwegian government's policy of supporting the publication of its literature abroad.8 Nineteenth-century classics like Amalie Skram’s Constance Ring and Betrayed, short stories by Nini Roll Anker, Ragnhild Jølsen, Solveig Christov and others have at last been published in English. Camilla Collett’s The District Governor's Daughters has just appeared for the first time in English, almost 140 years after its publication in Norway. Halldis Moren Vesaas’s Selected Poems has also appeared. Contemporary literature is faring better too; the list of recent translations includes Bj0rg Vik’s An Aquarium of Women, Out of Season and Daughters, Cecilie Løveid’s Seagull Eaters and Sea Swell, Gerd Brantenberg’s What Comes Naturally and The Daughters of Egalia, Herbjørg Wassmo’s The House with the Blin Glass Windows. The time is ripe for a fuller presentation of these works and their authors in English. My decisions about which authors to foreground in the following study have been influenced in part by the availability of translations, but also by my own sense of their relative importance in both a historical and a literary context. Of the authors to whom I have devoted a complete chapter, most are principally writers of fiction, but I have included one poet (Halldis Moren Vesaas) and one dramatist (Cecilie Løveid). Because much of the material will be relatively unfamiliar to many readers, I have introduced a fair amount of historical and biographical information, highlighting the\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\ntensions which lie behind as well as within the texts. Yet the main emphasis is always placed on the texts themselves. I have been concerned to examine not only what Norwegian women write but the way they write, the rhythms and images of their poetry and prose - to demonstrate that they do indeed have a literature of their own.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPART I 1850-1913\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 Finding a Voice The Birth of a Nation It was with the publication of Camilla Collett's novel Amtmandens D0ttre (The District Governor's Daughters) in 1854-5 that the struggle for women's rights in Norway can be said to have properly begun. In order to understand the frustrations out of which the book arose, however, it is necessary to look back to the beginning of the nineteenth century or, more precisely, to 1814, the year in which the modern Norwegian state came into being. For many hundreds of years before 1814 - ever since the latter part of the fourteenth century - Norway had not existed as an independent sovereign state. The country was ruled by the Danish monarch; and although in theory all (male) citizens of the twin kingdoms were equal, in practice it was Danish administration, language and culture which predominated. The Norwegian civil service was largely staffed by Danes, and Copenhagen was the cultural as well as the administrative centre of both countries. Norway did not have its own university; its scholars studied at the University of Copenhagen and its intellectuals and artists often settled there permanently. The population was small and largely rural. Of the total of 885,000 in 1815, only 9.8 per cent lived in towns; the rest were scattered over a wide expanse of often inhospitable terrain. In comparison with the rest of Europe it was backward; in the eyes of the great powers it was negligible. The beginning of the nineteenth century brought international conflicts in which Norway became an incidental victim. The British naval blockade of Denmark from 1807 meant that Norway was virtually cut off from its ruler and, more seriously, from its trade links; near starvation followed. In the bargaining of the great powers, Swedish ambitions to take over Norway grew, as it became politically expedient for the Swedes to look westwards to compensate for the loss of Finland to the Russians in 1808-9. The\n\n4\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nSwedish crown prince, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte (later Karljohan), took advantage of Denmark's vulnerability to threaten Frederik VI into ceding Norway to Sweden. The union with Sweden, which was to last until 1905, was, however, very different from the utter dependency of the relationship to Denmark. National feeling had been growing in Norway since the late eighteenth century, and the years of isolation from Denmark gave it further impetus. In 1809 a society for the promotion of economic and educational advance, Selskabetfor Norges vel, was founded, and 1813 saw the foundation of a Norwegian university and plans for a national bank. When news of the cession reached leading Norwegians, they were not disposed to accept their new overlords passively. At a meeting of a hastily organized national assembly at Eidsvoll in April 1814, regional representatives drew up and ratified a Norwegian constitution, which laid down provisions for a national Parliament [Storting] to oversee the running of national affairs in collaboration with the king and his ministers. The Swedes saw the expediency in ensuring a peaceful takeover by accepting the constitution, which thus provided a significant degree of autonomy for Norway, and the basis for much future wrangling as the Norwegians progressed towards complete independence during the uneasy century of union. The constitution confirmed Norway's growing sense of nationhood, which began to make itself felt in all areas of public life during the first decades of the nineteenth century. The Storting gradually acquired more confidence in its dealings with the Swedish king, local government was introduced and political parties were formed, until in 1884 full parliamentarianism under Johan Sverdrup's new Liberal administration began the process of dismantling the union. The building up of the cultural life of Norway, and especially of the capital, Christiania (Oslo1), was a vital ingredient in the creation of a national identity. There can be few countries in which there has been such intense interaction between writers and politics, and in which writers' pronouncements have been taken so seriously, as they were in Norway throughout the nineteenth century. The milieu was small, and prominent figures often played many roles. In the 1830s and 1840s, nationalism coincided with Romanticism to produce a National Romantic movement of which the hero\n\nFinding a Voice\n\n5\n\nwas Henrik Wergeland (1808-45), son of one of the founders of the constitution. He has been given the lion's share of the credit for restoring Norwegians' confidence in their cultural inheritance;2 as well as producing some fine poetry and plays, he was an ardent advocate of education for the people, writing a series of popular textbooks, a furious polemicist and a devotee of the Norwegian line in politics and literature, striving for a native and colloquial tone in his writings. In this he was opposed by a Danophile group which favoured a gradual development of the joint Dano—Norwegian culture which had grown up over the centuries, based on the Danish language as the natural medium of expression. The leader of this group was also a poet, Johan Sebastian Welhaven (1807-73), whose classically restrained verse was as much a contrast to Wergeland's as were his politics. Reviving the national culture involved looking back to the past - and in Norway's case, to find a heroic past one had to look some way back, to before the Black Death and the collapse of Norwegian autonomy. There was thus a revival of interest in medieval culture during this period (further encouraged by Romantic tendencies, which, in Norway as elsewhere, encouraged a glorification of this half-mythical time). Sagas, ballads and tales of the Norsemen provided material for quasi-historical treatments of Norway's golden age - amongst others, for Ibsen's early historical dramas in the 1850s. Turning to the more recent past, researchers also became aware of the oral tradition which had preserved the folk literature down through the centuries. The pioneers in this field were P.Chr. Asbjornsen and Jorgen Moe, who travelled around the country collecting Norske folkeeventyr (Norwegian Folk Tales, 1841—4). These collections are important not only for the tales which they rescued for posterity but also for the language in which they are retold, which attempts to capture the colloquial style of the teller and give them a more native Norwegian form. The importance of the language question in the development of the modern Norwegian state can hardly be exaggerated; it still raises hackles today in a way which amazes foreigners whose own language development has been a process of gradual growth. During the centuries Danish had become the official written language, differing in orthography and vocabulary from the still spoken Norwegian. A reinstatement of Norwegian became part\n\n6\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nof the national programme. There were two different schools of thought, however. One advocated a gradual adaptation of Danish to conform more closely to educated Norwegian usage, the other a radical break with Danish and the substitution of a new language form based on the rural language of the people. In the event and one might say unfortunately, in view of later ramifications both directions were followed, with the result that two Norwegian languages developed. Dano-Norwegian, which developed into the modern bokmdl ('book-language'), approximated to urban usage in Eastern Norway, and has always been the language of the majority. However, a significant (but now dwindling) number, among them some of Norway's finest writers, opted for the other language, originally called landsmdl (national language) but since 1929 called nynorsk (Neo-Norwegian). The latter is a language which owes its formation to one man, the philologist Ivar Aasen, who travelled around rural Norway in the 1840s collecting dialects out of which he constructed a dialect norm, publishing a grammar in 1848. In the 1880s landsmdl was accepted as an alternative language of instruction in schools.\n\nWhat part did women play in the birth of this modern Norwegian state? In direct political terms, the answer is, not surprisingly: absolutely none. There were no women delegates at Eidsvoll in 1814; both the electors and the representatives they chose were male. So were the electorate for the Storting, and the Members of Parliament. It has been suggested that it was a retrograde step for women's participation in public affairs: Those tough, strict, responsible men had little ability to understand and value the female mind. There were several women who were well-known and had wide influence in the centuries before the nineteenth. From the beginning of the nineteenth century - or rather from 1814 onwards - there is not a single woman in Norway who is visible beyond the narrow circle of the family. And in the furious politicking which developed in Norway after 1814 we do not hear a single woman's voice.3 The men themselves, of course, represented an elite. The franchise was restricted during most of the nineteenth century to men\n\nFinding a Voice\n\n7\n\nwith a property qualification; as late as the 1870s, only 7-8 per cent of the population was entitled to vote. But stranger than the absence of female electors is the almost total absence of women from any form of public life during the early part of this century. This is no doubt largely due to the fact that there was so much emphasis on 'politicking' during this period. Women had no legal status in their own right, could not carry on a trade and had no access to higher education. Bourgeois women were respectable only as members of a family; workingclass women toiled at menial tasks for even less pay than their menfolk. During the first decades of the nineteenth century there were some cautious political reforms which benefited a small number of women. In 1839 the Storting decreed that women over forty should be authorized to practise a craft if it was necessary for their own support; in 1842 this right was extended to all unmarried women. There is no evidence that women themselves agitated for these reforms, however; they were seen primarily as a relief to heads of families who had previously had to support unmarried female relatives who were unable to earn their own living, and whose presence in the household was becoming burdensome as labour-saving devices made housework easier and there was less need of their unpaid labours. Yet this was the beginning of a process of reform which gradually recognized women's right to participation in economic and public life. There was no well-known female writer or artist in Norway in the first half of the nineteenth century. Cultural life too was the preserve of an elite, and flourished mainly in circles connected with the University of Christiania - to which women did not have access. That is not to say that women were not writing before 1850; they had been writing since before books were printed, and the tradition of published women's writing in Norway goes back to the poet and psalmist Dorothe Engelbretsdatter in the seventeenth century. But their writing was often of the intimate kind which did not catch the public eye: religious meditations, translations, stories for children, memoirs. Often it was anonymous, and has been overlooked by literary historians.4 It is also of relevance to\n\n8\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nnote that the novel, which has shown itself to be a form congenial to the talent of women writers, developed rather late in Norway; in fact the realistic novel of family life did not make its appearance in Norwegian literature until there was a woman of sufficient talent to create it. That woman was Camilla Collett, and the novel was The District Governor's Daughters.\n\nTwo Pioneers Camilla Collett's novel was the culmination of a long struggle on the part of its author, a cry of protest against the stultifying conventions which she felt had ruined her life. She came from the privileged elite (she was a Wergeland), but was assailed by her own temerity in publishing at all, and tried to preserve her anonymity. It was only in later life that she began to speak out in her own name about the injustices perpetrated against women of her class - and others; and by then she had been joined by other educated women whose efforts were directed to practical reform. (See Chapter 2.) The other pioneer of the women's liberation movement in Norway was an equally remarkable woman, Aasta Hansteen (1824-1908). She too came to feminism as a result of personal suffering. She was in many ways the opposite of Camilla Collett; although she also was privileged in terms of background and opportunity, she felt herself to be unattractive where Camilla was beautiful and feted, yet she came - paradoxically - to seek public attention, whereas Camilla shunned it. She threw herself passionately into many causes.5 She began her career in the 1850s as a painter and continued to regard herself for most of her life as first and foremost an artist. In the 1860s she took up the language cause, becoming only the third writer after Ivar Aasen and the poet Aasmund Olafsson Vinje to publish in landsmdl; her book Skrift og Umskrift i Landsmaalet (Writing and Rewriting in Landsmaal, 1862) contains both her own original poetry in the language and her recasting of texts by other authors, including Wergeland, Asbj0rnsen and Moe. It was not until the 1870s that she began to agitate for the rights of women;\n\nFinding a Voice\n\n9\n\nand then she dedicated herself to that cause, giving public lectures and writing articles with a lack of moderation which made her a favourite subject for caricature. (She has also left more serious traces in men's writing, being used as a model by Ibsen for his Lona Hessel in Samfundets st0tter (Pillars of Society, 1877) and by the playwright Gunnar Heiberg for the eponymous heroine of Tante Ulrikke (Aunt Ulrikke, 1884)). Embittered by lack of recognition, in 1880 she took refuge in America, where she remained for nine years, making contacts with women's organizations and enjoying the more liberal climate. In Norway too, however, things were changing; in the 1880s, women became organized and the fight for liberation began in earnest. When Aasta Hansteen returned in 1889, it was to a quite different atmosphere. Both she and Camilla Collett lived long enough to hear their lone voices taken up by a chorus, and to receive recognition in their old age for their achievements. Neither Aasta Hansteen nor Camilla Collett had a programme of practical reform; different as their methods were, they shared the view that it was a change in consciousness rather than in political and social structures that was needed. Both still saw woman's place as being within the family, but wanted to give her greater autonomy within her proper sphere. There were other influences that were making themselves felt during the 1860s and 1870s, however, which were to have profound repercussions for the status of women. Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859) was known and discussed in Scandinavia during the 1860s (and translated into Danish by the author J.P. Jacobsen in 1871-3); as in other European countries, it had the effect of making people question the superiority of mankind and the supremacy of the Church and the patriarchal institutions it sanctioned. More directly, John Stuart Mill's On the Subjection of Women (1869), which appeared in the same year in Danish in a translation by the critic Georg Brandes, provoked heated discussion about the place of women in society. In Norway, the gradual process of reforms continued, with women gaining more control over their own affairs, training for the new office work, and obtaining access to higher education — culminating in the\n\n10\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nadmission of the first female student to the University of Christiania in 1882.\n\nPolitical Progress and Social Realism In the 1880s, development was rapid in many areas. In political life, the development of the dual-party system which culminated in the first Liberal administration in 1884 stimulated a reassessment of conservative institutions; the Liberals were more sympathetic towards underprivileged groups, including women, and instrumental in seeing through social and educational reform. But women too were beginning to take a more public role. 1884 also saw the formation of Norsk kvinnesaksforening (The Norwegian Women's Liberation Organization), the first public organization to fight for women's equality. Many of its most influential members were men. It was, however, cautious about going as far as demanding the right to vote, and in the following year a new organization, Norsk kvinnestemmerettsforening (The Norwegian Women's Suffrage Organization) was formed by a breakaway group. This was to be entirely a women's organization, and chose as its leader Gina Krog, a campaigner who had given up her teaching post in 1880 in order to devote the rest of her life to the cause. She was the editor of the movement's journal Nylcende (lit. 'newly cleared land') from its inception in 1887, and kept it going, often practically single-handed, until her death in 1916 (the journal actually survived until 1927). The group worked for political reform, stimulated by similar organizations abroad, in particular in America and England, and in 1890 a motion to give the vote to property-owning women got as far as the Storting. It was defeated, but had attracted considerable support; the women felt that the tide was turning in their favour.6 Literary figures played a major part in public debate in the 1880s too. This was the period of 'problem' literature, the so-called Modern Breakthrough, when social issues were a central concern for many writers. It was a literary direction which was fostered and focused by Georg Brandes, who in a series of lectures in Copenhagen during the 1870s on Hovedstmmninger i del 19de Aarhundredes Litteratur (Main Currents of Nineteenth-Century\n\nFinding a Voice\n\n11\n\nLiterature) had explained new developments in European literature to his fellow Scandinavians and urged them to write in a realistic manner about contemporary society. Preoccupation with modern social problems led many authors to focus on the position of women - and not only bourgeois women. The working class became a serious literary subject for the first time, rather than a rural idyll or a backcloth; and working-class women were perceived to be doubly disadvantaged. Sexual morality too became the subject of a furious pan-Scandinavian literary feud which lasted over decades, but reached its climax in the 1880s. Drama had become a medium for literary debate in Norway by the 1880s. After a late start - the first Norwegian-language theatre was founded by Ole Bull in Bergen in 1850, followed by one in Christiania in 1852 — Norwegian theatre had acquired two major talents, Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906) and his equally famous contemporary Bj0rnstjerne Bjornson (1832-1910). It was in 1879 that Ibsen wrote what came to be seen as his clarion call for women's liberation, Et Dukkehjem (A Doll's House); this was followed by many plays in which it is the female central character who demonstrates a strength of purpose or a breadth of vision unequalled by the men (Mrs Alving in Gengangere [Ghosts, 1881], Rebekka West in Rosmersholm, 1886), or whose life has been ruined by lack of opportunity (Hedda Gabler, 1890) or callous exploitation (Irene in Ndr vi d0de vagner [Wlien We Dead Awaken, 1899]). Although Ibsen did maintain that he was a supporter not of women's liberation but of people's liberation, his strongest sympathies lie with those whose efforts in the pursuit of self-realization are most severely hampered, and in nineteenth-century Norway that category consisted largely of women. Bj0rnson played a central role in public debate throughout the second half of the century, taking up the cudgels on behalf of a breathtaking number of causes. Many of his plays and novels contain what would now be called positive role-models: strong and self-assured women whose men are not always equal to the challenge they pose. His emancipated women include Valborg in his play En Fallit (A Bankrupt, 1875), and the heroines of Leonora (1879) and Paul Lange og Torn Parsberg (1898). With Georg Brandes, August Strindberg and others he played a leading role in\n\n12\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nthe sexual morality debate, which revolved around the question of the double standard: whether society should condone promiscuity in men while simultaneously demanding chastity of women; this led to questions of free love, prostitution, contraception, the right to divorce, etc. Bjornson's main literary contribution to the debate was his play En Hanske (A Gauntlet, 1883), in which the item in question is thrown down in challenge to her fiance by the heroine Svava, when she discovers that he has had an affair. The other two writers who make up the 'four greats' of this period - Jonas Lie (1833-1908) and Alexander Kielland (1849-1906) - also contributed to the debate. Jonas Lie's novels from the 1880s, Familjen paa Gilje (The Family at Gilje, 1883) and Kommand0rens D0ttre (The Commodore's Daughters, 1886) explore the lack of opportunities for women and their fates under the tyranny of convention. The title of the latter novel is a reference to Camilla Collett's The District Governor's Daughters, and it is written in the same spirit. (It is noteworthy in this context that Jonas Lie's wife, Thomasine, played a major role - as he acknowledged - both in developing his ideas and in giving them artistic form; yet her name does not appear on any publications.)7 Kielland's satirical novels and short stories expose male pretensions and self-delusion; he is also concerned about the exploitation of working-class girls and the evils of prostitution, a theme which aroused growing outrage throughout the 1880s until the Storting passed a law in 1887 abolishing legalized prostitution. Kielland's short story Else (1881), which depicts an honest working-class girl who is seduced by a cynical adventurer and forced into prostitution to stay alive, helped to raise the storm of indignation which led to a change in the law. Battle in this area was also joined by authors whose books caused such a scandal that they were banned: Christian Krohg's Albertine (1886), which went further than Else in portraying moral corruption (amongst the police) and the horrors of prostitution and enforced medical examination; and Hans Jaeger's Fra Kristiania-Bohemen (From the Christiania Bohemia, 1885), one of the major works of the 'Bohemian' literature which made the case for unfettered sexual indulgence for both men and women.\n\nFinding a Voice\n\n13\n\nThus the interweaving of literary activity, social debate and legislation was intimate during the 1880s; women's lack of autonomy was highlighted by socially concerned writers, who helped to form the climate of opinion which made changes possible. It is symptomatic of this involvement that in 1884, when the Storting had discussed the question of whether a married woman should have the right to own her own property and a referendum of local council members had overwhelmingly defeated the proposal, Bj0rnson took the initiative to send a protest, signed by Ibsen, Kielland and Lie, pointing out the unfairness of making a woman automatically subject to her husband, and of asking only men to vote on the matter. (It was, commented Ibsen archly, 'like asking wolves to approve of increased measures of protection for a flock of sheep'.8)\n\nIt was not only male writers on whom the burgeoning women's movement relied for support — although they were invaluable during the early stages, which is why they have been given so much space here. An increasing number of women were responding to the calls for socially committed writing. The most well-known was Amalie Skram, who made her debut in 1885 with Constance Ring. This is the first of many novels which investigate the consequences of the double standard, here the fate of a young girl brought up in complete ignorance of sexuality, who is married off to an older, experienced man - with catastrophic results. Both in her life and in her writing Amalie Skram was to demonstrate the classic problems of self-realization for an independent woman in a male-dominated society (see Chapter 3). Amalie Skram's talent, like Camilla Collett's, has been to some extent recognized in traditional literary histories.9 The same has not been true of other nineteenth-century women writers, who have been remembered - if at all - for reasons other than their writing. Magdalene Thoresen (1819-1903) is a case in point. Her main claim to fame was first as Ibsen's mother-in-law, and second as a model for various of his and Bjornson's characters. A sensual woman, who was clearly not satisfied by her marriage to the kindly but considerably older Pastor Thoresen, she was thought to have been the model for Ellida in Ibsen's Fmen fra havet (The\n\n14\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nLady from the Sea, 1888). Many of Bjornson's strong-willed female characters, like the heroine of Fiskerjenten (The Fisher Girl, 1868) and of Leonora (1879), probably owe much to the woman whose passionate nature at once fascinated and alarmed him. But she was herself a successful writer who was rated alongside Camilla Collett by critics like Georg Brandes. She published a book of poems, Digte of en Dame (Poems by a Lady), as early as 1860, becoming the first woman author in Norway to eschew anonymity. Her poems still seem remarkably fresh and intimate; they give direct expression to female desire in an unprecedented way. Some are addressed by an older woman to a young man - a scandalous subject, but concealed in the imagery offlowers('Resedaen taler' 'The Mignonette Speaks') or as a regret for her own lost childhood ('En Dr0m' - 'A Dream'). It is a theme which recurs in one of her best stories, 'Min Bedstemoders Fortaelling' ('My Grandmother's Tale', 1867), in which a grandmother on her deathbed recounts the story of her hopeless love for a younger man - which was unexpectedly realized when his wife died, and she demonstrated the courage of her love and claimed him as her husband. (The young poet in the story bore such a strong resemblance to the young Bj0rnson that no one could be in much doubt - and certainly not Bjornson himself, who was so offended by her use of him that they were estranged for some time. Although he was happy to use her as a model, he did not wish to have the compliment returned.) Magdalene Thoresen wrote throughout her life after being left a widow with small children in 1858, endeavouring to support herself by her pen - a battle which she gradually won, as her work became popular. She wrote mainly novels and short stories, somewhat uneven in quality, inclining towards the melodramatic and fatalistic; but in the best of them, such as the popular Bilkder fra Midnatsolens Land (Pictures from the Land of the Midnight Sun, 1884-6), she gives finely observed portraits of life in rural Norway, and particularly of women. Her later work was popular with women readers, and with women critics as they began to appear towards the end of the century.10 Dramatic writing is a genre in which women writers have traditionally made less impact; and they play little part in the official history of nineteenth-century Scandinavian theatre, dominated as it\n\nFinding a Voice\n\n15\n\nis by figures like Ibsen, Bj0rnson and Strindberg.1 ] From the late eighteenth century onwards, however, women were involved in the dramatic societies which were formed in several Norwegian towns as private clubs with restricted membership. Their involvement was principally as actresses, and women from the leading families did not regard it as improper to take part. They also played a part behind the scenes, for example in translating foreign plays - though such work was often anonymous. As the nineteenth century progressed they began to write too - and had their works performed in progressively larger numbers. During the period 1870 to 1900, for example, the originally Danish-language Christiania Theatre performed fifty plays written by Norwegian dramatists, of which eleven were by women. Amongst the better-known women dramatists are Mathilde Schj0tt (1844-1926) and Marie Colban (1814-84). Amalie Skram wrote one major play, Agnete (1893), which did not do well when it was first staged in Bergen but has since become a popular part of theatrical repertoire. In the history of the Norwegian theatre too, Magdalene Thoresen is an important but largely forgotten name. She wrote many plays, of which no fewer than four were staged (anonymously) at the Norwegian Theatre in Bergen during the 1850s - three of them whilst Henrik Ibsen was director. None did very well, but they were useful training for her later more successful dramas: Et rigt Parti (A Good Catch, 1870), a play about the immorality of young girls selling themselves to rich husbands, which was performed both in Copenhagen and at the Christiania Theatre; and Inden D0re (Behind Closed Doors, 1877), a study of generation conflict which had considerable success in both Christiania and Bergen, and was also performed abroad. Of some importance in theatrical history is another largely forgotten name, Laura Kieler (1849-1932). Forgotten as an author, that is; for she has an assured place in literary history as the model for Ibsen's Nora in A Doll's House. Laura Kieler's marital history resembled Nora's, although the details reflected even less credit on her husband; Ibsen has drawn more closely from real life here than in any other of his plays. But he had known of her well before 1879; as early as 1869, when she was only twenty, she had published a novel under the pseudonym Lili called Brands d0tre (Brand's Daughters). This was a sequel to Ibsen's Brand,\n\n16\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nwhich she maintained gave a false picture of Christianity; in the novel, Brand has survived with two grown-up daughters, and is brought to realize the error of his harsh religion and to exchange it for a milder faith. It is an immature novel, with melodramatic episodes interspersed with long passages of religious tracts; but the remarkable thing is that she dared to publish it at all. Ibsen said little about it, but followed her career from then on with interest. She had a difficult life as a writer, and her public image was not helped by Ibsen's use of her. Some time after A Doll's House she appealed to Ibsen because she was being accused of dishonesty by those who did not know the facts, and begged him to write and confirm that she had acted honourably; but inexplicably, Ibsen refused to do so. Like several other authors of this period, Ibsen practised his own form of double standard; though he helped through his writings to arouse public concern about the oppression of women, he was less forthcoming when it was a matter of lending a beleaguered woman his personal support. Laura Kieler was responsible for the play which caused the most indignant public discussion in Scandinavia in the nineteenth century after Ibsen's social dramas: Mcend afsEre (Men of Honour), which was finished in 1888, published in 1890, and performed in Copenhagen in 1890 and in Christiania in 1891. The subject matter was daring: it was an attack on the ideals of free love, and a demonstration of its consequences for the woman, who faced public disgrace when her partner moved on to pastures new. Additional furore was caused by the fact that the play was interpreted by the critic Georg Brandes as a personal attack on himself — although it was not until a few months after it had been finished in 1888 that Brandes's rejected lover, Victoria Benedictsson (one of Sweden's leading writers), took her own life. Although the play was praised by many, including Ibsen and Bj0rnson, it did not do well in performance, and was soon taken off.\n\nFin de siecle Stagnation and Final Victory After the optimism of the 1880s, the 1890s were a time of frustration for the women's organizations. Politically, other issues were regarded as more important, particularly the future of the\n\nFinding a Voice\n\n17\n\nunion with Sweden, which caused a governmental crisis in the mid-nineties. New political parties had been formed; the old Liberal Party had split into Moderates and Radicals in the late 1880s, and a Labour Party had been formed in 1887. There were many changes of government in the 1890s, and several minority ministries. The women's movement could no longer rely on automatic support from the Liberals, who feared - perpetuating the common myth — that women were naturally conservative, and that they would suffer if women were given a say in government. Industrial strife was growing too. Industrialization had come late to Norway, but there had been rapid growth in the second half of the nineteenth century. In 1850 only 14,000 people were working in industry, but by 1875 there were over 95,000. The population had grown from 885,000 to over two million by 1890 - even though more than 400,000 had emigrated to America since 1814 - and was to reach 2.5 million by 1900. The urban population was expanding particularly rapidly - the population of Christiania more than doubled between 1878 and 1900. Accelerating industrialization brought industrial unrest, and demands for better working conditions. Unions had begun to form in the 1870s, but the union movement did not acquire momentum until the end of the 1880s. It was galvanized by two strikes in 1889, one of which was a protest by women matchmakers against their dangerous working conditions and low rates of pay; this achieved much public support and led to the formation of the first women's trade union, Kvindelige Fyrstikarbeideres Forening (The Women Matchmakers' Union) in 1890. Finally, in 1899, a trade-union federation, Landsorganisasjonen, was formed. Women could be members of unions, but they were mostly run by men for men; the idea of equal pay for equal work was a long time coming. The campaign for extending the franchise to women, which had seemed to be gaining ground during the 1880s, received several setbacks during the 1890s. In 1891 the Liberals published a manifesto declaring their support for universal manhood suffrage - a double insult to women in that it would exclude even property-owning women whilst including all classes of men. Then in 1896 the Storting decided to give the vote to all taxpaying men, whilst still excluding all women. The anger caused by this\n\n18\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nled to disagreements within the Norwegian Women's Suffrage Organization between those women who were campaigning for the right to vote for all women and those who believed that a property qualification was advisable. The organization consisted entirely of middle-class women; there was no broad women's movement in Norway which succeeded in uniting women of different classes, although they had campaigned for better conditions for working-class women and engaged in social and charitable work, especially between 1888 and 1895. Working-class women had always made common cause with their class rather than with middle-class women. But the disagreement resulted in a split in the organization; when the majority voted to lower its sights and try to achieve partial voting rights, Gina Krog left, and with her fellow sympathizers formed Landskvinnestemmerettsforeningen (The National Women's Suffrage Organization), which took over the old slogan of 'national and local suffrage on the same conditions as men'. The ultimate goal of both groups was universal suffrage, but different tactics were employed. By the end of the century, no progress had been made on the vote, although other reforms had been achieved, which improved the position of unmarried mothers and their children and introduced proper training courses in household management, cookery, etc. An important step was a change in the constitution in 1898 to allow women to be appointed to government and civil service posts. But both women's organizations were electrified when, in 1901, the Liberal Party put before the Storting a motion to extend voting rights to non-taxpaying men - again without including any women. Only idiots, convicts, paupers - and women would not be enfranchised. A storm of protest followed, and it became clear that support from the Conservatives, traditionally the opponents of reform, was now greater. In May 1901 came partial victory: the right to vote in local elections was extended to women of a certain income. But it was a near thing, with only one vote tipping the balance. During the first years of the twentieth century, links with international organizations were strengthened. Moral support from women in other countries, particularly in England and America, had always been important, but until now it had been largely a matter of personal contact. In 1904 Norwegian women, on the\n\nFinding a Voice\n\n19\n\ninitiative of the indefatigable Gina Krog, founded Norske kvinmrs nasjonalrad (The Norwegian Council of Women), which became affiliated to the International Council of Women. Support from abroad gave new hope; and with their recent acquisition of partial voting rights Norwegian women, who had felt for so much of the nineteenth century that they were lagging behind other Western countries, were now in the forefront of reform. In 1905 came the decisive crisis in the union with Sweden. The growth of national feeling culminated in a demand for independence which the Storting decided to test by a plebiscite on 13 August. The result was overwhelmingly in favour of dissolving the union. Unfortunately, however, it was yet again decided to exclude women from voting. So they held their own poll, using their nationwide organizations, and by 22 August they were able to hand in a petition of 300,000 names in favour of dissolution. Their action impressed the Storting and helped to swing the tide of opinion in their direction, aided by the fact that the decision of 1901 had not been the catastrophe that some had feared; women had used their vote in local elections in increasing numbers and with responsibility. After this, the worst struggle was over. In 1907 the Storting decided, by a comfortable majority, to enfranchise women of a certain income in general elections. Congratulations poured in from abroad, as although this was not total victory, it was a great step forward on an international scale. After this followed universal suffrage for local elections in 1910, and finally universal suffrage for general elections in 1913. At the final vote, not one member of the Storting voted against.\n\nNorwegian literature in the 1890s was still partly dominated by the authors of the 1880s; the 'four greats' lived until the early twentieth century, and with the exception of Kielland produced important works during this last decade. Yet there is a shift of emphasis, particularly in the work of Ibsen and Lie, during the 1890s. Ibsen had moved away from social drama, and was writing symbolic explorations of guilt and retribution and of his own artistic vocation, such as Bygmester Solness (The Master Builder, 1892) and When We Dead Awaken. Jonas Lie, who had had to\n\n20\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\ndo violence to his fascination for the mystical and mysterious to suit the 1880s vogue for 'problem literature', now allowed his imagination freer rein in works like Trold (Trolls, 1891—2), short stories which draw on folk belief in trolls and demons to incarnate the irrational forces which can invade the daylight consciousness of the mind. A similar change can be seen in the work of another author who had made a significant contribution to the social debate - and to the linguistic debate (he adopted landsmal as his literary medium) - in the 1880s: Arne Garborg (1851-1924). In 1886 he had published Mannfolk (Menfolk), a collective portrait of male sexuality which was deemed so crass that it cost him his government post; by 1891 he had written a novel with the typical title Trcette Mcend (Tired Men), a study of a decadent, cynical and burnt-out man. The new male authors of the 1890s showed a similar tendency to strike out in new directions. The most important of them, Knut Hamsun (1859-1952), gave a series of lectures in 1891 in which he declared war on 'modern literature' in the shape of Ibsen, Bj0rnson, Kielland and Lie, and heralded the advent of 'psychological literature', which would investigate the finer nuances of the life of the soul. He proceeded to provide examples of this way of writing in novels such as Suit (Hunger, 1890), Mysterier (Mysteries, 1892) and Pan (1894), exquisite studies of tortured souls struggling with their own internal conflicts. There is afin-de-siede atmosphere about the work of many authors during this period: a sense of disillusion, a movement away from realism and rationality, and a disinclination to take up causes. The poet Sigbjorn Obstfelder (1866—1900) is in many ways a typical nineties figure, writing poems which are mood-pictures of wonder, fear and alienation, and dying appropriately of consumption at the end of the decade. Hans E. Kinck (1865-1926) began writing in the 1890s, and his short story collection Flaggermus-vinger (Bat-wings, 1895) investigates the obsessive and potentially destructive power of irrational and erotic forces over the human mind. The central female figures in these works from the 1890s are typically rather different from heroines in the socially aware 1880s, who were generally either oppressed victims or articulate activists. Now the emphasis shifted back to woman as a sexual being; the interest of writers in the irrational and the subconscious involved\n\nFinding a Voice\n\n21\n\na return to a theme which resurfaces continually in literary history and had last done so during the Romantic period earlier in the century: that of dangerous female sexuality. There are signs of it in Ibsen's plays; a major element in the destruction of Solness the master builder is his erotic fascination for the provocative Hilde, and the young sculptor Rubek from IVtien We Dead Awaken was only too aware of the temptation posed by his beautiful naked model, which he had to resist in order to be able to create. Jonas Lie's Trolls goes further in its depiction of the demonic in woman; the story 'Jorden drar' ('The Earth Draws'), for example, depicts the battle for a man's soul between his ordinary, pretty blonde fiancee and the black-eyed, broad-shouldered, hairy troll's daughter who lures him into the mountain. The troll wins, as in most of Lie's haunting stories; everyday rationality is no match for the power of repressed desire. Woman as an object of desire predominates in the work of the new authors of the 1890s too. Hamsun's hero in Hunger, starved of sex as well as food, becomes fascinated by a girl he sees in the street, whom he transforms in his dreams into Princess Ylajali, who waits longingly for him on a throne of yellow roses. Lieutenant Glahn in Pan makes love to real women and dream women under the midnight sun, but desires nothing so much as the one woman it seems he cannot have. Obstfelder's priest in En Prests Dagbok (A Priest's Diary, 1900) intoxicates himself with visions of the breasts and thighs of dancing women. Kinck's stories imbue the whole of nature with a seductive sensuality which has an equally powerful effect on both men and women. It is not only in literature that the threatening power of female sexuality is so central during this period; the painter Edvard Munch's various studies entitled Vampire, a red-haired woman enfolding and devouring a passive man, are from the first years of the decade, and his Harpy is from 1900. Thus it was not only politicians who did little to advance the cause of women's equality during the 1890s; women campaigners had some reason to feel aggrieved at this literary reaction to the rationalist 1880s. Not all books fall into these categories, of course; authors do not fit neatly into decades. Bj0rnson continued to write committed literature until his death in 1910, although his views became more conservative with advancing years, and Garborg's\n\n22\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\ndefeatism in Tired Men reverted to a more optimistic belief in the strength of an earthy country lass to overcome demons in the poem-cycle Haugtussa (1895). But there is nevertheless a marked swing of the pendulum which coincides with the 1890s' lack of interest in the idea of woman as a political animal. The work of women writers during this period, however, does not exhibit the same dichotomy between the mood of the 1880s and that of the 1890s. Women were not tired of the ideas of equality, and did not feel that the subject of social injustice and oppression had been exhausted. Camilla Collett and Aasta Hansteen were still campaigning, and the latter continued well into the twentieth century. Amalie Skram's writing changed and developed, but not in a mystical or neo-Romantic direction. She carried on writing studies of the crippling effect of sexual ignorance on young women in novels like Forraadt (Betrayed, 1892), and later in the decade she produced semi-autobiographical accounts of the struggle of being an artist as well as a wife and mother (e.g Professor Hieronimus, 1895). In between her other writings she was also working on Hellemyrsfolket (The People of Hellemyr, 1887-98), her epic Naturalistic study of a Bergen family trapped in a Zolaesque downward spiral into despair. Women who made their debut in the 1890s belong in general to the category of writers overlooked by literary historians. Alvilde Prydz (1846-1922) began writing in 1870 but had even more of a struggle for recognition than most women; her breakthrough did not come until the 1890s. In two linked novels, Mennesker (People, 1892) and Dram (Dream, 1893) she depicts Helene 0rn's unsuccessful attempt to achieve a marriage based on mutual respect; and in a four-volume series of which the central novel is Gunvor Thorsdatter til Hcero (Gunvor Thorsdatter at Hser0, 1896) she studies different kinds of women: the young bride who is tyrannized by an older husband; the snake-like, sexually voracious woman who drains the strength from a man; and the fearless independent woman whose qualities are not recognized by the man until it is too late. She is a nineties author in the sense that her ideals are portrayed as ultimately unrealizable, and the end is often disillusion. She also wrote several plays, of which two were staged: Han kommer (He's Coming) at the Christiania Theatre in 1895, and Aino at the new National Theatre in 1901 - to a mixed reception.12\n\nFinding a Voice\n\n23\n\nDikken Zwilgmeyer (1853-1913) has a place in literary history as a writer of books for children. Her books about Inger-Johanne won lasting popularity; she is one of the best-selling children's writers. Her books for adults, however, are less well known. In 1895 came Som kvinder er (The Way Women Are), a collection of stories about disappointed lives. These are women who stand outside the mainstream of society as companions, spinsters and aunts, their talents unrealized and their dreams of fulfilment mocked. The sisters Olga and Malli in 'Paa egne ben' ('On Their Own Feet') are left helpless by the death of their parents, with no training for any work and no idea of how society functions; Olga ends up in a cold, lonely job in the city as an underpaid cashier, whilst Malli chooses the other evil: life as the wife of an older, petty-minded country teacher. In an introduction written in 1913, Sigrid Undset drew attention to the originality of these stories: In the midst of a time of neo-Romanticism they stand quite on their own, these grey stories about fine, unnoticed pettybourgeoises. Through all the stories there vibrates the undertone of these women's desperate, unspoken longing for love and warmth and fulfilment . . .'3 But when they were published, this volume and the subsequent novel, Ungt Sind (A Young Mind, 1896) met with little appreciation, and it was some time before Dikken Zwilgmeyer wrote any more books for adults. Hulda Garborg (1862-1934), the wife of Arne Garborg, made her debut with an outspoken contribution to the sexual morality debate, Et frit Forhold (An Open Relationship, 1892). The novel traces the fate of a young shop assistant through seduction, pregnancy, rejection and the death of her child; it is unusual in its frankness about physical details and in the elasticity of its heroine, who refuses to be crushed by her tragedy but manages to salvage a tolerable life in the end. Her most popular success was as a playwright, with Rationelt Fj0sstel (Rational Farming), which was performed more than eighty times at Christiania Theatre between 1897 and 1899 - more than any other play by a woman in the nineteenth century. It can hardly be said to have struck a blow for women's rights, however, being a comedy which pokes fun at a farmer's daughter who thinks she has all the answers to\n\n24\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nmodernizing the farm. Hulda Garborg, like her husband, was a staunch supporter of the landsmal movement, and wrote in both languages; her wide-ranging authorship, including essays, memoirs and journalism as well as novels, poems and plays, continued until her death. She always wrote from a woman's perspective, though she was not always in agreement with more radical campaigners; she laid more stress on the essential maternal nature of woman than did some of her contemporaries. The end of the nineteenth century saw many more women taking up writing as a profession. Some of the most important authors who made their debut in the years before 1913, however, will be considered in the next chapter, as the main bulk of their writings is in the later period; Nini Roll Anker's first novel was published in 1898 and Sigrid Undset's in 1907. But there is one author who, because of the shortness of her life, both began and finished her writing in the few years between the turn of the century and 1913: Ragnhildjolsen (1875-1908). Ragnhild J01sen was an isolated figure who has only recently been 'rediscovered', with new editions of her books and renewed critical attention. More than the other women writers she combines the demands for autonomy of the women's movement with the interest in the darker irrational forces of the mind expressed by the neo-Romanticists. Her central female characters in Rikka Gan (1904) and Hollases kronike (The Chronicles of Hollas, 1906) are women with their own aims in life, who challenge male domination; yet both acknowledge the power of their own sexuality and the way in which it can make them accomplices in their own defeat (see Chapter 4).\n\nConclusion With the exception of Camilla Collett and Amalie Skram, the women writers of Norway's first century of independence are not well known in their own country - much less abroad. One part of the problem is that they have been overlooked by a tradition which still writes them out of history; another is that their works are often uneven in quality. When one enquires why that should be so, one finds an answer resembling the one Virginia Woolf discovered to\n\nFinding a Voice\n\n25\n\nher famous question: why is there no female Shakespeare? 14 The women of nineteenth-century Norway did not have the time, the money, or the education to write; it was a struggle with practical difficulties as much as with the Muse. Even the life of a male author in nineteenth-century Norway was not an easy one; the reading public was small, and making a living by one's pen was a considerable challenge. Ibsen did not make a comfortable living until he was well over middle age, despite comparatively substantial sales. Alexander Kielland complained constantly to his publishers that he could not make ends meet, and Knut Hamsun nearly starved before his work was recognized. Travel grants and stipends were vital to authors, and especially important from the 1860s onwards was the diktergasje, a guaranteed annual stipend awarded by the Storting to selected authors. During the last forty years of the century this stipend was awarded to Bjornson, Ibsen, Lie, Garborg and several minor authors - though not to Kielland, whose refusal was a cause celebre. But the only woman to be awarded a stipend was Camilla Collett, who had to wait until 1876 and be content with considerably less than her male colleagues. Magdalene Thoresen applied for a grant but was told that she was not eligible since she was born Danish, although she was married to a Norwegian; Amalie Skram applied but was told that she was not eligible since, although she was born Norwegian, she was married to a Dane. All three women were bringing up children alone, and their lives were dogged by fear of destitution. Financial assistance was not required only to maintain a decent standard of living, however; it was essential to be able to travel. For most of the nineteenth century, the capital Christiania was a cultural backwater, and the cultural centre of Norway remained Copenhagen. (Interestingly, it showed no sign of moving to Stockholm; Norwegians' feeling of greater temperamental - if not linguistic - affinity with Denmark has persisted to this day.) The largest publishing house in Scandinavia in the nineteenth century was Gyldendal in Copenhagen, and it remained the main publisher of Norwegian literature until the turn of the century. Theatrical life, too, flourished in Copenhagen as it did not in Christiania. It was not only Denmark to which Norwegian authors felt drawn. The nineteenth century was the time of the grand tour;\n\n26\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nand Scandinavian authors as well as English sought out the classical European centres of humanism, to partake of a culture which would enrich their provincial experience. Ibsen spent twenty-five of his most creative years in Germany and Italy; Bj0rnson, Kielland, Lie, Hamsun and many others spent formative years in the cultural capitals of Paris and Rome. Artistic interchange flourished at Zum schwarzen Ferkel in Berlin, where Munch and Strindberg belonged to an international community. Such an interchange was difficult for female writers to experience, when their opportunities for travel were restricted by convention as well as lack of funds. Camilla Collett was desperate to travel and did so, but at the cost of breaking up her family; and for many women authors it was not an option. Small wonder, then, that the privations of the artistic life took a particular toll on women who wished to write.\n\n2 Camilla Collett (1813-95) Life and literary apprenticeship I grew up under the threefold pressure of a crushing loneliness, individuals of gigantic strength in my nearest family and in others who gained power over me, and in addition a harsh law of femininity, of which it is difficult nowadays to have any conception. (SFII, p. 204) ] This statement from the essay collection Sidste Blade (Last Leaves, 2nd and 3rd series, 1872) sums up the conditions under which Camilla Collett's writing took shape. Her childhood home, Eidsvoll, was a place already redolent of history when the family moved there in 1817, three years after the adoption of the constitution. It was set in beautiful wild country, which was the young Camilla Wergeland's cherished refuge; yet it was a provincial backwater, bereft of cultured society, and two days' uncomfortable journey from the capital Christiania. It was the capital which offered entertainment and the friendships — both male and female — for which the adolescent Camilla longed; yet trips there were rare, and served most often to highlight the gloom of the long dark winters. The family into which she was born was a mixed blessing, dominated as it was by its temperamental male members. Her father, the theologian Nicolai Wergeland, had been one of the Eidsvoll representatives, and partly for that reason had applied for the living at Eidsvoll. But the place did not live up to his expectations, and his ambitions were frustrated. He became a disappointed man, a gloomy father for whom Camilla felt a mixture of affection and apprehension. Her eldest brother Henrik was the family genius, recognized as a phenomenon from his schooldays; his fiery creative energy, wild escapades and furious polemics were the focus of the family's worry and admiration throughout his short life. Her mother, who was of a warmer, more extrovert nature, played a\n\n28\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\ndomestic role, and wanted the best for her two daughters: a happy marriage. It did not occur to anyone that there might be unusual talent in a daughter. It did not occur to Camilla herself, who agreed with the others that Henrik was the talented member of the family. Not until later did she realize that it was nurture, not nature, that had made their early lives so different: Take two similar shoots from a thriving forest plant, plant one of them in the fresh air and the earth where it belongs, and the other in a pretty plant pot in a little room in the house, and don't ask then why one of them shoots up strong and fruitfully whilst the other one droops.2 As if this were not enough, her bruising contact with assertive male egos was compounded by the fact that at the age of seventeen she fell in love with Henrik's arch-rival, Johan Sebastian Welhaven. It was a passion immediately conceived and never conquered; to the end of her life it remained her most vital experience. Welhaven was charmed by her graceful beauty, which several of his poems record; but he did not take the relationship seriously. The cause for which he fought was all-important to him, and it would have been damaged by an alliance with the enemy; he did not realize until much later the strength of the feelings which Camilla kept jealously hidden. The 'episode' dominated ten years of her life; when she finally became engaged to Peter Jonas Collett in 1839, her letters to him circled obsessively around this passion.3 Jonas Collett was the last of the four central men in her life, and quite a different character. He was a tolerant and practical man, deeply in love with Camilla but prepared to win her affection slowly. He responded to her confessions of her passion for Welhaven, which kept bursting out in her letters to him, with patient sympathy. There is no doubt that he provided a support which drew her affection and trust - although there are hints that he could never kindle her physical passion as Welhaven had done. They married in 1841, and Camilla bore him four sons during the next decade. He died of nerve fever in 1851, and Camilla Collett lived the last forty-four years of her life (more than half of it) as a widow. There is a reason for beginning this study of Camilla Collett's writings with a detailed account of the men in her life; for it is\n\nCamilla Collett\n\n29\n\na prerequisite for an understanding of her as an author. She was born into the most patriarchal period in Norwegian history, and was intimately connected with its leading figures. She was always conscious of the fact that her love for Welhaven and her marriage to Collett were both regarded by her family as a betrayal; they belonged to the opposition and both had attacked her father and her brother in print. She was bold enough to defy family feelings, but not thick-skinned enough to ignore them. She must have felt as if she had been singled out to be martyred by the passions of a time of ferment; she returned again and again in her later writing to the conflicts, trying to set the record straight. The last words in her collected works are addressed to her brother Henrik, dead fifty years, appealing to him to accept her choice of husband.4 To some extent her family circumstances were a help to her aspirations to write - she received a relatively good education, made occasional trips abroad, and came into contact with the leading men of her age, hearing discussion of the burning political and cultural issues - but increasingly they came to be felt as a cloak which made her own achievements invisible. The crassest confirmation of the way in which society saw her as an adjunct to her family came in 1876 when, after twenty years of trying to make her living as a writer, she was finally awarded a half author's stipend: the government declared that her merits were (a) that her father Nicolai Wergeland was one of the founders of the constitution, (b) that her brother Henrik Wergeland was one of the country's foremost poets, (c) that her husband Jonas Collett had been a distinguished employee of the university, and (d) that her literary works were of such merit that she deserved the nation's gratitude. It must have seemed a rather backhanded compliment. After her death, literary historians perpetuated the myth. Accounts of her writings in literary histories until quite recently have devoted as much space to her men as to her writings. Her husband is given the lion's share of the credit and she becomes a medium rather than an originator; thus Kristian Elster the Younger in 1924: 'He salvaged her passion and suffering and spiritual strength for a great body of writing', and Francis Bull as late as 1960: 'Collett had succeeded in restoring his wife's courage, calming her restlessness and showing her the way to a great life's work as an author.'5 In these accounts she becomes the object rather than\n\n30\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nthe subject, a fate she shares with many other women writers.6 Writing was a strong drive in her from early youth, but at first it was channelled into letters and diaries rather than fiction.7 Both tell of her family conflicts, her love of nature, her trips to Christiania; and above all of her love for Welhaven. Many letters are addressed to Emilie Diriks, her shy confidante in Christiania, who admired her greatly, and reflected back her passions like an enlarging mirror. In the letters Camilla paints various scenarios for her own life, experiments with style and language, discovers the vivid metaphors drawn from her own experience which were to become a hallmark of her mature work. She compares her own lack of purpose with the heroic actions of women from Sparta and Rome; she feels condemned to 'a nightcap-life' (DB II, p. 316), where she must 'sit at the spinning-wheel in an old, desolate vicarage in a desolate district of a lonely, desolate country' (ibid., p. 289). She plans a magazine, 'Forloren Skildpadde' ('Mock Turtle') with Emilie (of which a couple of handwritten issues did appear) and plays half-ironically with the idea of being an author: 'I must tell you frankly that I do think in all seriousness that Our Lord was thinking of making some such thing out of me, but that he had second thoughts halfway through, and told himself: \"Oh no, there are enough in that family'\" (ibid., p. 82). Yet she is entirely serious in her comments on style, striving for a natural tone and referring wryly to Paul de Kock's comment that no woman can write two lines without becoming precious. Signs of her wide reading of European literature, particularly German and French, are already apparent. She has discovered George Sand, a writer whose style she greatly admired and to whom she often turned as a model - though she had more ambivalent feelings about her lifestyle: 'I'm just reading George Sand's Jacques. How light and fluent these letters are, how natural and entirely free of artificiality is this Fernande - or rather her style. . . . This George Sand is marvellous. She is a blot on our sex as A. Dudevant, but as George S. she is its greatest glory' (ibid., pp. 245-6). Towards the end of the 1830s she was beginning to write more sustained prose, encouraged by Jonas Collett, who saw in her writing a distraction from morbid dwelling on the past. Her first article, published in 1842 in the journal of Welhaven and Collett's party, Den Constitutionelle (The Constitutional), was\n\nCamilla Collett\n\n31\n\n'Nogle Strikket0isbetragtninger' ('Reflections of a Knitter'), in which she took men to task for their arrogant treatment of women. Several more articles followed, all anonymous; though the anonymity was an open secret in Christiania. Asbjornsen and Moe were frequent guests in her home, and both Colletts were interested in their work on folk literature; this led to some collaboration, with Camilla retelling stories she had heard as a child from her nurse, and actually composing some parts of Asbjornsen's stories. (The join cannot be seen; their styles were so similar that even J0rgen Moe could be deceived and accused Asbjornsen of being the author of one of her journal articles.) Her interest in folk tales and in the supernatural is evident from many later stories. Despite her recognition within an inner circle, there was nothing which could have prepared her acquaintances for the appearance of the novel The District Governor's Daughters. When Jonas Collett died in 1851, she had made a start on the introduction; but she had got no further, and had been discouraged by him: 'Our civilized society, he maintained, was still in a stage of fermentation, and had not yet formed any foundation on which a novel could be securely built. . . . And perhaps nothing would have come of it if I had not become a widow' (SF III, pp. 90—91). That remark is a useful corrective to those who would give Jonas Collett the credit for her achievements. The first part of the novel was ready in 1853, but she was nervous of showing it to anyone; finally she approached the Danish author J.L. Heiberg, and was so encouraged by his positive response in the summer of 1854 that she allowed it to be published that year, and then finished the second part so quickly that it appeared in June 1855.\n\nThe District Governor's Daughters: the first swallow We are taken into the world of the novel by means of the arrival of an outsider, Georg Kold, who has come to take up the post of private secretary to Amtmand Ramm. Through his conversation with a post-house keeper we gain our first impressions of the family:\n\n32\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing Finally he asked whether the governor had many children. 'Of course he has children; he has a son.' 'But no daughters?' 'Oh good heavens yes, he has daughters too; there was Miss Marie and Miss Louise, they got married, one to the clerk and the other to the tutor who got a country living. Now there's only Miss Amalie at home.'(5 V I, p. 244)\n\nThis conversation reveals as much about unconscious attitudes as it does about the situation. First, it is clear that it is the governor's son who counts; he is immediately visible, whereas the existence of daughters is revealed only on further probing. Yet as the title indicates, it is the daughters who are the subject of the novel; the son disappears to become a student in Christiania. Secondly, it becomes apparent a few pages later that there is another level of concealment in this exchange, for there are in fact not three daughters but four; the fourth one, Sofie, being not only female but also a child, is not visible at all. Yet it is this fourth daughter, Sofie, whose fate is to be the focus of the story. The family live on an estate two days' journey north of Christiania, in an isolated rural area. They are the leading family of the district, comfortably off and cultured. Yet this combination of circumstances, which guarantees the son good prospects, is the source of their major problem for the four daughters. They have been educated with one aim: to make a suitable marriage; and yet their opportunities of doing so are alarmingly restricted. They travel infrequently, and are practically dependent on attracting the attention of one of the more or less eligible men who come their way. Inclination is rarely involved. This is demonstrated by the fates of the two eldest daughters. Marie, the beauty of the family, was still single at the age of twenty-five, and so was urged into a marriage with Broch, a pedantic, middle-aged pietist; within three years she had lost the desire to live, and simply died. Louise had been forced to give up her love - because the man she loved had not declared himself formally - and to marry the tutor Gaspers, who turned out to be a drunkard. During the time of the novel she is eking out a wretched existence, earning enough money by weaving to pay for her son to be brought up away from home to escape from the pernicious influence of his father.\n\nCamilla Collett\n\n33\n\nThe fates of the two remaining daughters are not decided when Kold arrives; yet little has been learned from experience. For the same pressures under which they gave way still exist, and are embodied in the figure of their mother, fru Ramm. Fru Ramm is the dominant figure in the parents' partnership, and - it is unequivocally stated by the omniscient narrator - the less noble nature. The governor is a rather sad figure, who wishes everyone well but lacks the energy to take any decisive action. He had married his wife without asking if she loved him, and by way of compensation her energies have been channelled into duty and propriety. In the perverse way of those who have been denied their own fulfilment, she has brought her daughters up in the same spirit, deluding herself that it is best for them: I married my husband without loving him passionately, and our marriage has been happy despite that. I found my happiness in resignation and in the fulfilment of my duties. My eldest daughters have not made marriages of inclination either; but they have become happy wives nevertheless . . . And my daughters . . . will one day thank me for it, thank me for teaching them that self-denial is a woman's greatest virtue. (SV I, pp. 395-6) With such a capacity for self-deception, fru Ramm offers little support. Yet she is not tyrannical; she allows Amalie to marry the man she has chosen and refuse a much better match. Even this marriage, though, falls far short of the ideal; for Amalie, with her sentimentally romantic notions, has chosen a man who could not be more different from her dreams of him. Bracher is a humourless pedant, and the poetry of their engagement culminates in a depressingly prosaic marriage. As she matures, Sofie becomes conscious of the miserable compromises around her. The marriage of her beloved sister Louise, when Sofie was ten, left a deep fear in her mind, which becomes a fear of love itself. She is an intelligent girl, who loves to read and to think - and yet does so alone, knowing that it is not a 'feminine' activity, and torn between her growing sense of her own worth and her awareness of what life has to offer. It is an awareness which fru Ramm loses no opportunity of reinforcing with well-chosen examples such as that of Jomfru Mollerup, who was so sure of\n\n34\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nher love that she wrote a passionate letter of declaration, which her beloved repaid by circulating it amongst his friends. For the cardinal crime of declaring herselffirst she has paid with madness, and her life is now spent continually knitting and unravelling the same sock. Sofie falls in love with Georg Kold; but the effect of her conditioning is such that she devotes all her energies to concealing her emotions. Kold is equally in love, and equally inhibited, though for different reasons. His behaviour is affected by his other friends. His mentor Miiller comes to see him at the governor's home and teases him unmercifully about his propensity to fall in love; his predictions that Kold will marry one of the daughters make Kold determined to prove him wrong. He is also made uncertain by Margarethe D, an older woman who has been disappointed in love and whose courageous life inspires him with a determination to act nobly. On her death he receives her letters and diaries, in which she implores him never to force his attentions on a girl, but to wait until he is sure of her love; only then will it be a mutual bond, not an abuse of power. Georg, who is as sensitive as the other suitors in the novel are unfeeling, determines that he will wait for a sign from Sofie. This stalemate is interrupted by the intervention of another of the novel's rich gallery of characters, Lorenz Brandt.8 Brandt was a young man of great promise who succumbed to the temptations of the student life in Christiania and became a disreputable drunkard. He too loves Sofie, and his presence stirs Kold into action. Kold saves Sofie from him in a dramatic incident which involves carrying her across a stream; jolted out of her usual firm resolve, she admits her feelings for him, and their happiness seems secure. A happy ending, however, would go against the whole drift of the novel - and it is not to be. Sofie's consciousness that she has acted wrongly in declaring herself first is reinforced by overhearing Kold declaring to Miiller - from whom he is determined to keep his love secret - that she means nothing to him. From then on she refuses to have anything to do with him, never giving him the chance to explain; she agrees to marriage to the much older Dean Rein, who is looking for a companion and a mother for his children. She thus reinforces the pattern of the whole novel, accepting a union of mutual respect, but one where\n\nCamilla Collett\n\n35\n\nsexual fulfilment will for ever be denied.\n\nThe District Governor's Daughters was an ambitious undertaking - an attempt, as Camilla Collett put it in her preface to the third edition, to depict 'the social conditions which prevailed in our patrician Norwegian life after our political rebirth' (SV I, p. 239).9 It is painted on a broad canvas, with a mixture of narrative styles. The main part is related in the third person by an omniscient narrator, who sometimes reports events without comment, but often - as in the depiction of fru Ramm - makes her opinion of characters clear. The narrative is also punctuated by first-person interpolations from several of the characters in the form of letters, diaries and memoirs. The pace of the narrative varies, and there are longueurs in the early part; yet the various threads of the story all have a bearing on the central theme, providing a background against which Sofie's dilemma is thrown into relief. It will be evident from my summary that there are many parallels between the events in the novel and those of the author's life. Not only does she transmute her own struggle with a love which dares not speak into that of Sofie; many of the details of the novel are drawn directly from her own letters and diaries, and thus acquire a deeper resonance. Margarethe's pronouncements about woman's lot are Camilla's own; in her macabre predictions of her own death, the reference to the 'black casket' reminds the reader of the black casket in which Camilla all her life carried around her correspondence with Welhaven, and Margarethe's doctor's remark that she would probably die 'when the leaves fall from the trees' (SV I, p. 343) is a direct quotation from Welhaven's letter of farewell from March 1836: 'Camilla! In the summer when the leaves fall from the trees it is time to part' (DB I, p. 235). The author did not deny the connections; in 1868 she characterized the novel as 'the long-repressed scream of my life' (SV II, p. 63), into which she had poured her despair at the fact that her life's greatest victory was over her own feelings. Yet at the same time, she maintained, it was much more: it was an account, in no way exaggerated, of the way in which women of the 'better' classes lived in mid-nineteenth-century Norway:\n\n36\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing I have decided to let the story retain the title of The District Governor's Daughters; but it could perhaps much more accurately be adapted to A Country's Daughters. It provides, considerably softened, a portrait of the destinies in store for daughters of the educated classes, especially in more isolated rural areas.... In my long life, spent under these conditions, I have not come across anything other than tragedies in these families, nor, as far back as the stories go, heard tell of anything else. (SFI, p. 239)\n\nWhen the novel first appeared, it occasioned considerable critical debate.10 Intellectuals in Norway were acutely aware of the lack of an independent tradition of prose writing. Poetry had flourished since 1814, with Wergeland and Welhaven in the vanguard; but the only prose writer of any note, Maurits Hansen, was traditional and conservative, and his stories, although popular, soon became dated. This novel, with its minutely observed depiction of everyday life in a Norwegian milieu, was immediately hailed and has since been canonized as Norway's first realistic novel. To modern readers, however, it will probably be the non-realistic aspects which are more apparent; there is a tendency to idealize some of the characters and scenes which is more reminiscent of Poetic Realism than of what we would now understand as Realism proper. With historical hindsight, it is truer to say that The District Governor's Daughters represents a transitional stage between the Romantic tradition out of which it grows and the Realist writing which it heralds. In its content too the novel is a transitional work. It was the first work of Norwegian literature which deserves the name of 'tendenslitteratur' (the Norwegian equivalent of 'litterature engagee'), and the first to take up for serious discussion the rights of women. However, the rights which Camilla Collett advocates are minimal compared with those demanded by activists elsewhere in Europe and in America at this time.11 Compared with those of Mary Wollstonecraft or her admired George Sand, Camilla Collett's aims are modest indeed. The message of the novel is the need not for practical political reform, but for what she calls 'inner liberation'. Neither here nor anywhere else in her writings does Camilla Collett dispute the fact that marriage is a woman's ideal state, and that to be left an old maid is the saddest fate of all.\n\nCamilla Collett\n\n37\n\nIt is the conditions of marriage that she is trying to change; it is a woman's feelings which should be consulted rather than a man's more superficial judgement. The boldness of Camilla Collett's stand shows up more clearly, however, if it is seen in a Scandinavian context. She was writing during a time when pietistic moralizing texts about women's duties as wives and mothers were popular reading, and before writers like Ibsen and Bjornson challenged traditional assumptions. Her literary sisters in other Scandinavian countries hardly provided radical models. The most popular woman writer of the day, the Danish Thomasine Gyllembourg (1773-1856), was one of her favourites, and she began her novel with the intention to model it largely on the former's 'Hverdagshistorier' (Everyday Stories) from the 1830s; she soon found, however, that she could not conform to the reactionary tone of stories which presented obedient wives as models of femininity. The only comparable feminist writer of the period was Sweden's Fredrika Bremer (1801-65), whose novels from the 1830s, like Presidentens dottrar (The President's Daughters, 1834) and Nina (1835) also describe the struggles of bourgeois daughters to decide their own fates. Together with Fredrika Bremer's works, The District Governor's Daughters could be said to mark the beginning of the raising of public awareness in Scandinavia about the injustices in the position of women. Camilla Collett's novel, however, is of more than purely historical interest. Though its ideas have been superseded and the social conditions out of which it grew had changed radically before the end of the nineteenth century, it has retained its popularity.12 The drama of the doomed relationship between Sofie and Kold, the liveliness of the portrayal of family life, the accuracy of the descriptions of the Norwegian countryside — all these have retained their appeal for new generations of readers. Modern literary criticism has returned to the novel with renewed interest in aspects of it which had earlier been obscured by a concentration on its overt message. Closer attention to the novel's symbolism, and in particular to Sofie's 'grotto', reveal it to be a study of female space.13 The grotto is a natural formation, part cave, part overhanging cliff, surrounded by thick vegetation and not visible until you are upon it; difficult of access, it is a wild and secretive place\n\n38\n\nNorwegian Women's Writing\n\nin contrast to the gentle, cultivated contours of the estate. It is discovered by Sofie, and associated particularly with her. Her first experience of it is as a small child, on her first real voyage of discovery, when she experiences an ecstatic communion with nature. On her return, however, she is harshly punished by her mother for her dirty, torn clothes and her long absence. The shock of this punishment, which she does not understand, leaves a lasting impression on Sofie, who becomes nervous about experiencing pleasure, wondering always whether retribution will follow. Thus the grotto becomes for Sofie a joy which must be kept hidden. It is the place where she can relax and do as she pleases. It is to the grotto that she brings her books, to study with a concentration that the world would find eccentric. It is here she plays with her favourite doll, called Louise after her sister - and here that she buries the doll on the day of her sister's wedding. Here she has her decisive meeting with the two suitors, Brandt and Kold. And here, finally, she has her last meeting with Kold just before her marriage, when he appeals to her to break off the engagement, but she has lost her courage and it is too late. Her private space takes on different functions at different stages of the novel; at first a paradise, it becomes a playroom, a school, a church, a fortress and finally a tomb. When Kold leaves her there for the last time, she is sitting with a white shawl over her head 'like a shroud' (SV I, p. 516). Not only is the grotto a place where Sofie can find refuge, however; it is also herself. The sexual overtones of the grotto episodes suggest a Freudian interpretation, in which the grotto stands for the female sex organs - a place at first innocently associated with pleasure, rapidly overlaid by repression following her mother's reaction.14 Sofie's upbringing does not allow free expression of her sexuality, but inhibits her so that she almost manages to conceal her passion. In line with this interpretation, the rivals Brandt and Kold become the"
