Ingvald spent his formative years in Trondheim, where he attended the Latin School. He graduated in 1871 and the following year went to Oslo to study.[1]\n\nIngvald was listed in the 1865 Norway Census, living in Trondheim with his family. Living in the household were his parents, Halvor Undseth and Kristine Øllegaard Undseth (born Dahl); and his siblings: Halma Christence, age 6; and Kristine Halvora, age 2. [2]\n\nOn 29 July 1881, Ingvald was married to Marie Nicoline Charlotte Gyth at Kalundborg, Denmark.[3] They were the parents of three daughters, Sigrid, Ragnhild, and Signe.\n\nHe was employed as an assistant at the University's Old Testament Collection from 1875 until his death. He earned a doctorate in archeology in 1881, and his dissertation, which was published in German, made him famous in his field of work and study. Ingvald and his family lived at Rome for a time, and then moved to Kalundborg in Denmark before returning to Oslo in 1884.[4]\n\nBy the early 1890s, Ingvald's health declined. At the time of the 1891 Norway Census, he was living in Oslo at 89 Keysers Gade, along with his wife, Anna Marie Nicoline Charlotte Undset, and their children: Sigrid, Ragnhild and Signe. No occupation was listed for him. [5] He died in Oslo 3 December 1893 at the age of 40. His remains were buried at the church at Trefoldighet 11 December 1883.[6]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Ingvald Undset at Norway Wikipedia.\n\n↑ Folketelling 1865 for 1601 Trondheim kjøpstad.\n\n↑ \"Danmark Kirkebøger, 1484-1941,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QG8H-2PL6 : 15 March 2018), Ingvald Martin Undset and Marie Nicoline Charlotte Gyth, 29 Jul 1881; Marriage, Kalundborg, Vor Frue, Holbæk, Danmark, , Rigsarkivet, København (The Danish National Archives), Copenhagen.\n\n↑ Ingvald Undset at Norway Wikipedia.\n\n↑ Folketelling 1891 for 0301 Kristiania kjøpstad.\n\n↑ Record of the Death and Burial of Ingvald Undset."
