The individual novels are \"Kransen\" (\"The Wreath\"), first published in 1920, \"Husfrue\" (\"Wife\"), published in 1921, and \"Korset\" (\"The Cross\"), published in 1922. \"Kransen\" and \"Husfrue\" have also been published in English translation under the titles \"The Bridal Wreath\" and \"The Mistress of Husaby\".\n\nThis work formed the basis of Undset receiving the 1928 Nobel Prize in Literature, \"principally for her powerful descriptions of Northern life during the Middle Ages\"; her work is much admired for its historical and ethnological accuracy.\n\nPlot introduction\n\nThe cycle follows the life of Kristin Lavransdatter, a fictitious Norwegian woman who lived in the 14th century. Kristin grows up in Sel in Gudbrandsdalen, the daughter of a well-respected and affluent farmer. She experiences a number of conflicts in her relationships with her parents and her husband, Erlend in medieval Norway. She finds comfort and conciliation in her Catholic faith and eventually dies at peace with her world.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe Wreath\n\nKristin Lavransdatter is the daughter of Lavrans, a charismatic, respected nobleman in a rural area of Norway, and his wife Ragnfrid, who suffers from depression. Raised in a loving and devoutly religious family, Kristin develops a sensitive but wilful character, defying her family in small and large ways. At an early age, she is exposed to various tragedies, and is sent to a convent in Oslo. This proves to define her outlook on life.\n\nShe is betrothed to a neighboring landowner's son, Simon Darre, but falls in love with the knight Erlend Nikulaussøn, from the estate of Husaby in Trøndelag. Erlend is living under the ban of the Roman Catholic Church for openly cohabitating with Eline, the wife of a prominent judge. They have two children together, Orm and Margret. These children have no legal rights since they were born of an adulterous relationship.\n\nErlend and Kristin begin a passionate romance which is sealed with Erlend's seduction of Kristin and their eventual complicity in the murder of Eline -- both grievous sins in the eyes of both Church and State. After three and the death of his younger daughter, Lavrans no longer has the strength to oppose Kristin any longer. He consents to her marriage to Erlend. Erlend and Kristin are formally betrothed, but before the wedding, she becomes pregnant. Out of shame, she keeps this a secret from everyone, including Erlend, and is wed wearing a golden wreath, a privilege reserved for virgin brides.\n\nThe Wife\n\nThe second book opens with Kristin's arrival at Husaby. She is suffering from remorse for her sins and fears for her unborn child. Her relationship with Erlend is no longer the careless one of days past, as she can see that he is impetuous and wasteful of his possessions although his passion for her is unchanged. She gives birth to a son, Nikulaus (Naakkve for short), who to her surprise is healthy and whole in spite of the circumstances of his conception.\n\nAfter confessing to her parish priest, Kristin undertakes a pilgrimage to St. Olav's shrine in Trondheim to do penance and give thanks for her son's birth. She donates her golden wreath, which she wore undeservedly at her wedding, to the shrine.\n\nOver the following years, Kristin and Erlend have six more sons together, as Kristin becomes the head of the household. She must deal with her husband's weaknesses while running the estate, raising her children as well as those of Erlend's former mistress, and trying to remain faithful to her religion. During these years, her parents die and her sister is married to Simon Darre, although he secretly still loves Kristin.\n\nErlend, impulsive to the point of recklessness, runs afoul with the political powers of his time and is imprisoned. Through the efforts of Kristin's former fiance, Simon, his life is spared but his property must be forfeited to the crown. Husaby is lost to them. The only property left to the family is Kristin's childhood farm, Jørundgård.\n\nThe Cross\n\nKristin, Erlend, and their children return to Jørundgård but fail to gain the acceptance of the community. Hardship forges strong family bonds and highlights Kristin's sense of obligations to her family and her faith. After an argument, Erlend leaves the manor; he and Kristin reunite temporarily during his absence, and upon his return to the farm, Erlend is slain, and dies in Kristin's arms.\n\nAfter handing the farm over to her third son and his wife, Kristin returns to Trondheim, where she is accepted as a lay member of a nunnery. When the Black Plague arrives in Norway in 1349, Kristin dedicates herself to nursing the ill before she herself succumbs to the plague.\n\nRelated Works\n\nUndset wrote a tetralogy, \"The Master of Hestviken\", which takes place around the same time as Kristin Lavransdatter. Kristin's parents make a brief appearance in this book, near the end of the part called \"The Snake Pit\". They are depicted as young married people, playing with their baby son. They are a happy and prosperous couple at their first home in Skog, before Kristin's birth. The unfortunate life of Olav, the main character of \"The Master of Hestviken\", stands in stark contrast to the happiness and good fortune of the young couple. Anyone who has read \"Kristin Lavransdatter\" knows that Kristin's parents eventually lose all their sons in infancy, and suffer many other misfortunes and sorrows in their life.\n\nCharacters in Kristin Lavransdatter\n\n* Kristin Lavransdatter, the protagonist\n\n* Lavrans Bjørgulfsson, her father (also referred to as Lavrans Langmandsson)\n\n* Ragnfrid Ivarsdatter, Kristin's mother\n\n* Simon Darre (also called Simon Andresson), initially engaged to Kristin\n\n* Erlend Nikulausson, the reckless and handsome knight who seduces and marries Kristin\n\n* Ulvhild Lavransdatter, Kristin's younger sister left chronically ill and unable to walk after an accident\n\n* Bjørgulf, Haavard, and Sigurd Lavransson, Kristin's three brothers who died in infancy\n\n* Ramborg Lavransdatter, Kristin's youngest sister and eventual wife of Simon Darre\n\n* Åashild Gautesdatter of Dovre, a wise woman skilled in magic and the healing arts whom Kristin befriends.

The original translation to English was made in the 1920s by Charles Archer. His choice of archaic and stilted English phrasing (\"thee\", \"I trow\", \"methinks\" etc.) is considered by critics today to cloud Undset's clear prose and make it unnecessarily formal and clumsy. However, to those with some knowledge of Norwegian, who realise that many of Archer's choices deliberately reflect back on the original language (for example 'I trow' from the Norwegian 'tror' meaning \"to believe\" etc), the language seems more genuine and resonant rather than archaic. Other bowdlerizations include a sexually explicit scene being edited out of the English edition at the time.A new and complete translation by Tiina Nunnally was released by [http://us.penguinclassics.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143039167,00.html Penguin Classics] in 2005, and this translation is considered by many critics to be the superior of the two.\n\nAllusions/references to actual history, geography and current science\n\nUndset's characterizations of the ethnology and history of 14th century Norway have held up as archeological and literary evidence has emerged since its writing.\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n* Nobel Prize in Literature, 1928\n\nFilm, TV or theatrical adaptations\n\n*, 1995, directed by Liv Ullman: Critics gave it a lukewarm reception at best, and consider it to be more true to the present than the past. But it was viewed by as much as two-thirds of the population, one of Norway's most domestically successful films ever -- an important cultural event.
