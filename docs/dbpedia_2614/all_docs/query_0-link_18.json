        "text": "Apologies for the lack of post last week. I was behind to begin with, I got halfway through typing up my notes but I was feeling horrible, and wound up spending all day in bed instead of doing anything at all productive. üò¶ But here we are this week with the post I should‚Äôve written for last week. Hopefully that won‚Äôt happen again.\n\nThis week we have a Nobel Prize winner in literature for a book I‚Äôve been wanting to read for a while (I finally picked it up last weekend!), Sigrid Undset. Sigrid was born at her mother‚Äôs childhood home in Kalundborg, Denmark on May 20, 1882. She was the oldest of three daughters of Charlotte Undset (n√©e Anna Maria Charlotte Gyth) and Ingvald Martin Undset, a Norwegian architect. When Sigrid was two, her family moved to Kristiana, Norway (what is now Oslo; the name changed in 1925).\n\nWhen Sigrid was eleven, her father died after a prolonged illness. This put the family in financial trouble, and Sigrid had to give up her hopes of going to university. Instead, Sigrid enrolled in a one year secretarial course, and at age sixteen went to work for an engineering company in Kristiana; she would work there for ten years.\n\nThroughout this time, Sigrid was writing fiction. When she was sixteen she had started a novel set in Denmark in the Middle Ages. This was completed by age twenty-two, but it was turned down by the publishers she approached. Two years later, Sigrid had a new manuscript; it was only eighty pages and was set in contemporary Kristiana, focusing on a middle-class woman. This too was turned down at first, but was then published. The work, Fru Maria Oulie, created a stir upon its publication; the opening line reads ‚ÄúI have been unfaithful to my husband‚Äù and scandalized its readers with its frank discussion of adultery.\n\nThe publication of Fru Maria Oulie made Sigrid Undset a ‚Äúpromising young author in Norway‚Äù (1). In 1907 she joined the Norwegian Authors‚Äô Union; in the 1930s she would head their Literary Council and was one of their chairmen as well.\n\nFrom the time Fru Maria Oulie was published in 1907 until 1919, Sigrid wrote about life in contemporary Kristiana, ‚Äúabout the city and its inhabitants,‚Äù ‚Äúworking people, of trivial family destinies, of the relationship between parents and children‚Äù (2). She focused a lot on women and who and how they loved. In 1911 Jenny was published, and in 1914 Varren (Spring) was published. All of her works sold well immediately, and after her third book was published, she was able to quit her office job to write full time.\n\nSigrid was given a writer‚Äôs scholarship and travelled throughout Europe. She went to Denmark, Germany, and Italy, where she spent nine months in Rome. Her parents had loved Rome and she spent her time travelling to all the same places she knew her parents had visited. In Rome there was a group of Scandinavian writers and artists and Sigrid made friends with them.\n\nIn Rome in 1909, Sigrid met the Norwegian painter Anders Castus Svarstad. He was nine years older, and was married with three children, but they fell in love. They waited three years for Anders‚Äôs divorce to finalize, and then married in 1912. They travelled to London for six months and then came back to Rome where their first child was born in January 1913. The child was a boy, named for his father. By 1919, Sigrid had had another child, a mentally handicapped daughter, and had taken in Anders‚Äôs other three children, including a mentally handicapped son.\n\nThroughout this time, Sigrid continued writing, working on more novels and some short stories. She also entered public debates, critical of women‚Äôs issues, and the moral and ethical issues she saw that had led to the First World War.\n\nIn late 1919, Sigrid moved to Lillehammer, Norway with her two children, and pregnant with her third. The plan was for Sigrid to rest in Lillehammer while hers and Anders‚Äô home was being built in Kristiana. However, the marriage broke up and the couple divorced before their home was completed. Sigrid stayed in Lillehammer and her third child was born there in August of that year.\n\nWithin two years, though, the home that was being built was completed. Bjerkeb√¶k was a large home with traditional Norwegian architecture. It had a ‚Äúlarge fenced garden with views of the town and the villages around‚Äù (3).\n\nWhile the home was being completed, Sigrid worked on a Norwegian retelling of the King Arthur myth. She also ‚Äústudied Old Norse manuscripts and Medieval chronicles and visited and examined Medieval monasteries, both at home and abroad‚Äù, becoming ‚Äúan authority on the period ‚Ä¶ and a very different person from the 22-year-old who had written her first novel about the Middle Ages‚Äù (4). Her works are ‚Äúprecise, realistic, and never romanticized‚Äù (5), showing true human emotions, just set in a different time period. By using the Middle Ages, she was able to give herself the necessary distance, but also allowed for her admiration of Medieval Christendom.\n\nThe work this research led to is Krisin Lavransdatter, a trilogy published between 1920 and 1922. The trilogy shows ‚Äúlife in Scandinavia in the Middle Ages, portrayed through the experiences of a woman from birth until death‚Äù (6). In addition to the attention to detail about the historical period she was writing about, Sigrid employed modernist techniques such as stream of consciousness in Kristin Lavransdatter; these were cut out of the first English translations of the work though.\n\nAround this same period, Sigrid became a Catholic. Her parents had been atheists and her upbringing was secular, though living in a Lutheran country she had been baptized and had attended Lutheran church growing up. With the outbreak of the First World War and the break-up of her marriage, Sigrid had had a crisis of faith, and Catholicism was the answer for her. In 1924, at age 42, Sigrid was received into the Catholic Church and also became a lay Dominican.\n\nSigrid‚Äôs conversion was scandalous at the time in Norway. As mentioned, Norway was a Lutheran country; almost no one practiced Catholicism. There was also a lot of anti-Catholic rhetoric in the country at the time. As an author, Sigrid was also part of the intelligentsia at the time. They too didn‚Äôt accept her though, being mostly socialist and communist themselves. Sigrid was open about her Catholicism though, defending the Catholic Church in public debates.\n\nHer next work after Kristin Lavransdatter was Olav Audunss√∏n (translated in English as The Master of Hestviken). Olav, a four volume novel, was written during her conversion and published right after; it takes place during a time period when Norway was a Catholic country. After Olav, Sigrid went back to writing contemporary books, set in Oslo and ‚Äúwith a strong Catholic element‚Äù (7). In 1928 Sigrid won the Nobel Prize for Literature ‚Äúprincipally for her powerful descriptions of Northern life during the Middle Ages‚Äù (8).\n\nFollowing this, Sigrid was translating the Icelandic Sagas into Modern Norwegian and writing literary essays on English literature, mainly on the Bront√´s and D. H. Lawrence. In 1934 she published Eleven Years Old, an autobiographical piece about her childhood in Kristiana. In the 1930s she was also starting a new historical piece, this time to be set in eighteenth century Scandinavia, but only one volume was published before World War Two broke out. After the war Sigrid was too broken herself to finish writing it.\n\nWith World War Two came a lot of changes in Sigrid‚Äôs part of the world. Stalin invaded Finland; Sigrid donated her Nobel Prize to the Finnish war effort. In 1940 Germany invaded Norway. Throughout the 1930s Sigrid had been critical of Hitler, and so fled Norway upon the German invasion. She and her son first went to Sweden and then to the United States; they lived in Brooklyn and she pleaded for help for her country and for the Jews. In 1940, also, her oldest son, Anders, was killed in battle (her daughter had died before the war broke out).\n\nAfter World War Two ended, Sigrid returned to Norway, but never wrote again. Sigrid Undset died in Lillehammer on June 10, 1949 at age 67. She is buried in Mesnali, east of Lillehammer. The son and daughter that predeceased her are buried there as well; there are three black crosses marking their graves.\n\nSigrid Undset has been honored in many ways. In addition to the Nobel Prize in 1928, there is a crater on Venus named Undset for her. She was on the 500 kronur note and a 1982 2 kronur postage stamp in Norway. In 1998, Sweden put her on a stamp as well. Her home of Bjerkeb√¶k is now a part of the Maihaugen museum.\n\nThe book I finally got of Sigrid Undset‚Äôs is Kristin Lavransdatter, but now I‚Äôm interested in her other works. I think her books about contemporary Norway would be really interesting, reading about how Norway was in the early twentieth century, especially Fru Maria Oulie and its controversial opening line. I‚Äôm also now interested in her more Catholic novels, though I‚Äôd wait and read those after I‚Äôd read her earlier works. (While I love Evelyn Waugh‚Äôs Brideshead Revisited, I wish I had read it after I‚Äôd read his earlier works. He went through a similar conversion to Catholicism and it becomes more and more prevalent in his works.) I hope I‚Äôve inspired you all to go find some Sigrid Undset books as well!\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ‚Äì Sigrid Undset\n\n8 ‚Äì Nobel Laureates in Literature\n\nThis week is a little off. I‚Äôve been much busier than normal (I got a job, yay!), and haven‚Äôt been able to research as much as I‚Äôd like. Oddly, this means I‚Äôm doing a new topic every week, which winds up being more research ultimately since it‚Äôs more topics, but each entry needs less information so‚Ä¶ This week is also weird because it‚Äôs not, strictly speaking, a history topic. When listening to Sawbones (if you haven‚Äôt listened to this podcast go do it right now), Stendhal Syndrome came up in one of their episodes ‚Äì I think it was the fainting episode, given what it is, but I‚Äôm not positive on that. It sounded weird and interesting, so I thought why not? Also, my husband has wanted to read The Red and the Black by Stendhal for a while now so I‚Äôd heard of the guy before.\n\nBriefly on Stendhal himself. He was born Marie-Henri Beyle on January 23, 1783 in Grenoble and died March 23, 1842 in Paris. The Red and the Black is his most well-known novel, but he wrote six novels, two biographies, a memoir, some nonfiction, and a few novellas. Stendhal‚Äôs works were written in a realistic style at a time when Romanticism was popular. He used a number of different pseudonyms before settling on Stendhal. Stendal was a town in Germany where he stayed near once and where he fell in love; he added the ‚Äòh‚Äô to make the pronunciation clearer.\n\nIn 1817, Stendhal travelled to Italy and was just in awe of Florence. In his book Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio, he wrote ‚ÄúAs I emerged from the porch of Santa Croce, I was seized with a fierce palpitation of the heart (that same symptom which, in Berlin, is referred to as an attack of the nerves); the well-spring of life was dried up within me, and I walked in constant fear of falling to the ground‚Äù (1). This description is what would lead to the condition known as Stendhal Syndrome.\n\nFirst off, Stendhal Syndrome is not recognized in the American Psychiatric Association‚Äôs Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Apparently it‚Äôs pretty much just a European thing, heh. Stendhal Syndrome ‚Äì also known as Florence Syndrome, hyperkulturemia, and tourist syndrome ‚Äì is described as ‚ÄúA psychosomatic response ‚Äì tachycardia, vertigo, fainting, confusion and even hallucinations ‚Äì when the ‚Äòvictim‚Äô is exposed to particularly beautiful, or large amounts of, art in a single place ‚Äì e.g. Florence (Italy), which has a high concentration of classic works; the response can also occur when a person is overwhelmed by breathtaking natural beauty‚Äù (2). Stendhal Syndrome can also cause nausea, paranoia, and even temporary psychosis. It‚Äôs caused by concentrated art, ‚Äúimmense beauty (such as something in the natural world like a beautiful sunset)‚Äù (3), and ‚Äúmost commonly occurs in tourists who have created stress symptoms by attempting to see and do too much‚Äù (4).\n\nThe name Stendhal Syndrome was coined in 1979 by the Italian psychiatrist Dr. Graziella Magherini who, at the time, was the chief of psychiatry at the Santa Maria Nuova Hospital in Florence (5). She noticed that an awful lot of people visiting Florence were coming down with panic attacks or temporary madness, but not really requiring any medical help. Dr. Magherini remembered having read Stendhal‚Äôs account and coined the condition after him.\n\nIn 1989, Dr. Magherini published La Sindroma di Stendhal, in which she documented 106 cases at her hospital in Florence between ‚Äô77 and ‚Äô86. She broke these cases down into three different types. Type 1 had 70 patients who had psychotic symptoms; type 2 had 31 patients with affective symptoms; type 3 had 5 patients with panic attacks (6). Thirty-one percent of the people with type 1 had prior psychiatric history, and over half of the patients in type 2 had. That was pretty much it; not much else has been written on the condition in academic literature.\n\nIn 2005 one article claimed there was evidence that Dostoevsky suffered from this due to a description he gave of what happened when he viewed Hans Holbein‚Äôs Dead Christ. In 2010 another claimed that Proust, Freud, and Jung also had it, based on descriptions they gave of similar occurrences. Currently though, a team in Italy is trying to study tourists‚Äô reactions in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence. If people do suffer from Stendhal Syndrome, Dr. Magherini has a clinic with beds available for people to rest and recover.\n\nIt seems like Stendhal Syndrome is caused when people are already stressed about travel and/or have been looking forward to seeing a particular thing for a long time. Basically, you‚Äôre just extremely overwhelmed or overcome by the beauty of what they‚Äôre seeing. It‚Äôs not actually the place, but our expectations or exhaustion before getting to the place. It‚Äôs most common in Italy, but it seems that Italians are immune, presumably because they live among these things. The Japanese don‚Äôt get it either, due to their ‚Äúhit-and-run, highly regimented tourism‚Äù (7).\n\nSo, how can you prevent getting Stendhal Syndrome? Experts advise trying not to do too much at once (again, especially in Italy) and balancing your time between art and other activities (8). Beware though, there are other Syndromes you could still get. There‚Äôs: Paris Syndrome, from taking in too much culture at once; Jerusalem Syndrome, from taking in too much religion/religious sites at once; and Rubens Syndrome ‚Äúfor erotically charged activity to break out after, or even during, viewings of Old Masters, particularly those depicting a figurative romp‚Äù (9). The Rubens one has actually been studied too; of the 2000 people that were observed or talked to, 20% had ‚Äúbegun ‚Äòan erotic adventure‚Äô in a museum‚Äù (10) (for someone who works in museums‚Ä¶ Um‚Ä¶ Please don‚Äôt‚Ä¶).\n\nSo that‚Äôs the weird case (and so a weird entry today) of Stendhal Syndrome. I think it‚Äôs really neat but weird and crazy and I‚Äôm curious what other weird medical things there are like this! When you look at the Wikipedia page for Stendhal Syndrome it also suggests Lisztomania, Paris Syndrome, and Jerusalem Syndrome; Lisztomania was just done on Stuff You Missed in History Class, but I may have to look at the other two a bit more, or see what the Liszt page might tell me to look at. Crazy stuff!\n\n1 ‚Äì Stendhal Syndrome.\n\n2 ‚Äì Stendhal Syndrome, The Free Dictionary.\n\n3, 5, 6 ‚Äì Griffiths, Mark D., Ph.D., ‚ÄúHaving an Art Attack: A brief look at Stendhal Syndrome,‚Äù Psychology Today, Mar 10, 2014.\n\n4, 8 ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat is Stendhal Syndrome?,‚Äù wiseGEEK.\n\n7, 9, 10 ‚Äì Guy, Melinda, ‚ÄúThe Shock of the Old‚Äù, frieze, Issue 72, January-February 2003.\n\nI chose today‚Äôs topic because her work keeps popping up for me. Gertrude K√§sebier photographed Evelyn Nesbit, who I‚Äôm fascinated by; her photos have been used on book jackets, stamps‚Ä¶ a lot of things. She was a portrait photographer and a co-founder of the Photo-Secession movement. A lot of her work focused on domestic images of women. Despite knowing all this now, I still don‚Äôt feel like I really know her. I think I understand her art a bit better, and the changes in photography, but not really what she was doing. Maybe writing this and rereading it will help me know her better in the future.\n\nGertrude Stanton was born on May 18, 1852 in Fort Des Moines (now just Des Moines), Iowa in a log cabin. Her parents were John W. and Gertrude Muncy Shaw Stanton, and she had a younger brother. In 1859, John moved to Eureka Gulch and opened a sawmill hoping to make some money from the gold rush happening in Colorado; the following year the family followed. The family moved around a lot, John trying to find gold where he could. Eventually the family moved to Golden, the capital of the Colorado Territory; John was elected the first mayor of Golden. The family‚Äôs new wealth and status meant they wanted bigger and better things for their children now, and so Gertrude was pushed towards music. She resisted though, always more interested in art and pictures than anything else.\n\nWhen the Civil War broke out, the Stantons moved to Brooklyn, New York. At the time of their move, John may have been dead already. Some sources said that he died, and that caused the family to move; another source said that he moved with them and worked processing minerals in New York. However it all exactly happened, the family moved to New York and Gertrude‚Äôs mother rented out rooms in their home to make money.\n\nFrom 1866 (or 1868) to 1870, Gertrude went to the Bethlehem Female Seminary (later Moravian College) in Bethlehem, PA, living with her maternal grandmother while she went to school. She would return home to New York on occasion though, and on one of these occasions Gertrude met her future husband. Eduard K√§sebier was a German businessman, working to import shellac into the United States. Eduard rented a room at the Stantons home on some of his trips.\n\nGertrude and Eduard married on Gertrude‚Äôs twenty-second birthday, May 18, 1874. This marriage gave Gertrude a home and family and financial stability, but not much else. Gertrude didn‚Äôt have patience for housework and was still interested in art. Eduard wanted a normal wife and family. Neither person would budge and the marriage collapsed. The couple had three children ‚Äì Frederick William in 1875, Gertrude Elizabeth in 1878, and Hermine Mathilde in 1880 ‚Äì but once the last child was born, the couple separated. Gertrude once said, ‚ÄúIf my husband has gone to Heaven, I want to go to Hell‚Äù (1).\n\nDespite their separation, Eduard continued to support Gertrude financially. This support allowed Gertrude to go to art school. Once her youngest child was grown enough, Gertrude enrolled in the Pratt Institute in 1889. Originally she studied painting, but quickly fell in love with photography. In 1894 she won places in two photography competitions: The Quarterly Illustrator for best photograph, winning $50, and runner up in the New York Herald‚Äôs contest.\n\nIn 1894 Gertrude took a yearlong trip to Europe to further study art and broaden her knowledge. She was still taking typical art photographs at this time, focusing on cityscapes and landscapes. While she was in France, though, the weather was too bad to take pictures outside, and so Gertrude shifted to portraiture. Also while in France, Gertrude was publishing photos and essays in French magazines. In addition to studying in France, Gertrude studied in Germany under Hermann Wilhelm Vogel, who had also worked with Alfred Stieglitz.\n\nAt this same time, Eduard fell ill and Gertrude returned home. Eduard was only given one year to live, but ultimately lived another twelve. Moving back to New York, Gertrude had to find a way to bring in an income. She worked as an assistant to Samuel H. Lifshey, learning how to run a studio and work as a professional photographer. In 1896 Gertrude opened her own studio in her home, moving shortly after to ‚Äúthe emerging upscale shopping district known as the ‚ÄòLadies Mile‚Äô developing rapidly along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan‚Äù (2). This is when Gertrude‚Äôs portraits took off; she took over 150 photos of New York socialites at this time. Her photos are reminiscent of classically painted portraits, but she always denied this comparison.\n\nIn1896, Gertrude had her first solo show at the Boston Camera Club; this was to drum up business without being seen as commercial. Many of her other early photographs are of friends and family and highlight the theme of motherhood. (While Gertrude never had anything positive to say about marriage, she always showed motherhood in a positive, but realistic, light.) Gertrude‚Äôs style became popular; she used few props and only simple backgrounds.\n\nGertrude also took a number of photos of Native Americans. Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West show was very popular and was touring the country; on their stop in New York, Gertrude took their photographs. Having grown up out West, Gertrude wanted to show the Native Americans as she saw them as they were, nothing romantic; her photos were completely different from those of Edward Curtis, who was known for his photos of Native Americans.\n\nIn 1898, Gertrude entered some pieces into the Philadelphia Photographic Salon. Out of 1200 entries, only 259 were picked; Gertrude had ten pieces in the Salon. The following year Gertrude was one of the judges in addition to showing more pieces that year and in 1900. In 1899, Gertrude showed The Manger. The piece was purchased for $100, setting a record for photographic art.\n\nIn 1898, also, Gertrude reached out to Alfred Stieglitz, ostensibly ‚Äúasking for his advice on photographing outdoors, even though she had already published outdoor photographs‚Äù (3). They had similar ideas about photography, and he started promoting her works. In 1899, he printed five of her pieces in his journal, Camera Notes, saying she was ‚Äúbeyond dispute, the leading portrait photographer in the country‚Äù (4). In 1899 Gertrude was also praised in Everybody‚Äôs Magazine, ‚Äúplacing her at the top of both art photography and magazine photography‚Äù (5).\n\nGertrude began to be known for photographs of famous people. Between 1900 and 1902, ten of her portraits of famous people were shown in World‚Äôs Work, including Mark Twain, Arthur Twining Hadley (president of Yale), Booker T. Washington, and Jacob Riis (6). Her photos were also being used alongside fiction as illustrations. Unlike Jacob Riis, and fellow early female photographer Alice Austen, Gertrude K√§sebier was not interested in photographing the lower classes.\n\nGertrude was one of the first two women elected to join the Linked Ring in England (the other being Anne Brigman). In 1901, Gertrude travelled to Paris with Edward Steichen and photographed sculptor Auguste Rodin. Also in 1901, in Ladies‚Äô Home Journal, Frances Benjamin Johnson included Gertrude in a piece on ‚ÄúThe Foremost Women Photographers of America‚Äù (7).\n\nGertrude‚Äôs assent in the art photography world happened very quickly. In just over three years she had reached the ‚Äúhighest level of accomplishment and acclaim in art photography in the United States‚Äù (8). In her art, Gertrude was trying to be symbolic, yet intimate. To give her photos this dual purpose, she would rework her photos to change the appearance. Originally Gertrude worked with platinum prints, but moved to gum-bichromate in 1901, allowing her to create a different look.\n\nIn 1902, Alfred Stieglitz formed the Photo-Secession group, including Gertrude, Clarence H. White, and Edward Steichen as founding members. This group was an offshoot of Pictorialism. Pictorialism is all about manipulating the image and elevating photography to an art form. These photographers would use different focus types, print in something other than black and white, and alter their prints with brushstrokes or other surface manipulations (9). Photo-Secessionists were artists aligned with Stieglitz‚Äôs point of view. Stieglitz dedicated the first issue of his second journal, Camera Work, to Gertrude‚Äôs pieces.\n\nBy 1908, Gertrude‚Äôs relationship with Stieglitz was over, having been strained for years. In 1906, she had joined the Professional Photographers of New York which was more about selling photographs. Gertrude had to make money to support her family due to her husband‚Äôs continuing illness, and Stieglitz was opposed to commercial art. Additionally, Gertrude also cofounded the Women‚Äôs Federation of the Photographers of America with Clarence H. White, another group Stieglitz was opposed to. Gertrude officially resigned from the Photo-Secession in 1912.\n\nIn December 1909, Eduard finally died and was followed shortly by Gertrude‚Äôs mother in August 1910. This began a decline in Gertrude‚Äôs output, though she still focused on portraiture. In 1914 she opened a new studio in New York and in 1916 became one of the founding members of the Pictorial Photographers of America. In 1925, with failing eyesight and hearing, Gertrude‚Äôs daughter Hermine joined Gertrude‚Äôs business; in 1929, though, Gertrude shut her studio. That same year, there was a retrospective of Gertrude‚Äôs work at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. Gertrude K√§sebier died on October 13, 1934 in Hermine‚Äôs home.\n\nIn 1979 Gertrude was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame. In the late twentieth century there was renewed interest in Gertrude‚Äôs works. In 1979 the Delaware Art Museum put on an exhibition of her work; in 1992 the Museum of Modern Art had an exhibition, which eventually travelled to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 2002, Gertrude‚Äôs best-known work, Blessed Art Thou Among Women (1899), was put on a US postage stamp.\n\nGertrude K√§sebier was not only ‚Äúone of the first American women to have a successful career as a photographer, but she was one of the first photographers anywhere to focus on the family‚Äù (10). Her work still looks fresh, to me, and just so beautiful and atmospheric.\n\n1 ‚Äì Lori Oden, ‚ÄúGertrude Kasebier,‚Äù International Photography Hall of Fame.\n\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ‚Äì Beverly W.

I was researching someone else (they‚Äôll be up next week), and then realized that it was almost the birthday of the other person I‚Äôd considered for this week, as in, this person would have turned 125 tomorrow. So, I changed my plan and rushed to finish this. So Happy Day-Early Birthday to Agatha Christie, one of my favorites.\n\nAgatha Christie was born Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller in Torquay, Devon, England on September 15, 1890. Her family was comfortably middle class, and her father, an American, homeschooled Agatha; her mother, Clara, didn‚Äôt want Agatha to learn to read until she was eight. Agatha was the only child in the house (she had two older siblings, but ‚Äúwas a much loved ‚Äòafter thought‚Äô‚Äù (1)) and was bored, so she taught herself to read by age five.\n\nAgatha read children‚Äôs stories that were popular at the time, including E. Nesbit and Louisa May Alcott, but also read poetry and ‚Äúthrillers from America‚Äù (2). When Agatha was five, her family spent some time in France; this is when Agatha first learned French. When Agatha was eleven, her father died after a number of heart attacks.\n\nWhen Agatha was eighteen, she began writing short stories; some of these would be published in the 1930s after serious revisions. Two years later, Agatha traveled with her mother to Cairo for her mother‚Äôs health. They stayed for three months at the Gezirah Palace Hotel. During this period Agatha went to house parties galore and had a number of marriage proposals, none of which she accepted.\n\nIn 1912, Agatha met Archie Christie, an aviator with the Royal Flying Corps. They had a whirlwind romance, and wanted to marry, but neither had the money to make it possible. When World War One broke out, Archie went to serve in France and Agatha worked at the Voluntary Aid Department at the Red Cross Hospital in Torquay. They decided not to put off marrying any longer, and married on Christmas Eve of 1914. Archie returned to France on the 27th.\n\nThroughout the war, Agatha and Archie didn‚Äôt see much of each other. In January 1918, though, Archie was posted to the War Office in London, and so they were finally together again; this is when ‚ÄúAgatha felt her married life truly began‚Äù (3).\n\nThroughout the war, Agatha had been writing. She started in earnest on a bet from her sister ‚Äúthat she couldn‚Äôt write a good detective story‚Äù (4), as well as to relieve some of the monotony at work. Agatha would first develop her plot and then came up with her characters. At this time she was working at the Hospital Dispensary. She had had to take and pass a test from the Society of Apothecaries in order to get that position. This gave her the background she needed when she would use poisons in her writing. Her use of poison in her first book ‚Äúwas so well described that when the book was eventually published Agatha received an unprecedented honour for a writer of fiction ‚Äì a review in the Pharmaceutical Journal‚Äù (5).\n\nThis first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, was published in 1919. This was a big year for Agatha; in addition to the book‚Äôs publication, she and Archie moved to London, and their daughter Rosalind was born. The publication of Styles came after having sent it to four other publishers. This publisher, John Lane of Bodley Head, suggested a couple of changes to the book, including moving the resolution of the story from a courtroom to the, now famous, library.\n\nThe Mysterious Affair at Styles is the first book to feature Hercule Poirot, a Belgian former policeman. During World War One, a lot of Belgian refugees came to England; this is why Agatha Christie made Poirot a Belgian refugee.\n\nAfter the war, Agatha continued writing. Tommy and Tuppence Beresford and Miss Jane Marple soon followed Hercule Poirot. Agatha kept writing, even while she was travelling with Archie, ‚Äúpromoting the Empire Exhibition of 1924‚Äù (6). Agatha received news that The Secret Adversary (her second book, the first Tommy and Tuppence) would be published while she was in Cape Town. (While in Cape Town, also, Agatha became the first British woman to surf standing up.)\n\nAgatha used inspiration from her travels with Archie, as well as people she knew. For her fourth book, The Man in the Brown Suit, Agatha based Sir Eustace Padlar on Archie‚Äôs boss. For publication of this book, Agatha switched from Bodley Head to William Collins and Sons (now HarperColins).\n\nAround this time, Agatha and Archie returned to England to their daughter. They named their new home in the suburbs of London, Styles, after her first book. Shortly after this, Agatha‚Äôs life hit a hard spot. Agatha‚Äôs mother died, leaving Agatha to empty out the family home in Torquay. She was working on a novel at this point, but the strain of her mother‚Äôs death also strained her writing.\n\nAt this same time, 1926, Archie fell in love with Nancy Neale. Archie golfed, Nancy golfed, Agatha did not. Agatha found out about Archie‚Äôs relationship with Nancy. In early December of that year, Agatha left Rosalind with the maids at home and left. Her car was found several miles away, and a nationwide search took place. Finally she was found to have travelled from Kings Cross to Harrogate to the Harrogate Spa Hotel. Agatha was staying at the hotel as Theresa Neale, from South Africa. Luckily the staff at the hotel had recognized her and had called the police. Agatha didn‚Äôt recognize Archie, and didn‚Äôt know who she was, when he came to get her; she had amnesia and possibly a concussion. Agatha never spoke of this time with anyone.\n\nAfter her disappearance, Agatha separated from Archie. She moved to London with Rosalind and with her secretary, Carlo. She underwent psychological treatments at this time. Agatha was struggling financially, and was having trouble writing. Her brother-in-law suggested collecting some previously written Poirot short stories and publishing them; these short stories were published as The Big Four.\n\nIn 1928, Agatha and Archie‚Äôs divorce was finalized, and Agatha went to the Canary Islands with Rosalind. She finally finished The Mystery of the Blue Train, the story she had been struggling with after her mother‚Äôs death. In late 1928, Giant‚Äôs Beard was published; this was her first book as Mary Westmacott. Agatha would write six romances as Mary Westmacott (in addition to the sixty-six novels and fourteen collections of short stories as herself).\n\nIn the autumn of 1928, Agatha finally travelled on the Orient Express, something she had always wanted to do. She also travelled to Baghdad and to the archeological site at Ur, making friends with the Woolleys, the people who ran the site. The following year, Agatha came back to the dig and met 25-year-old Max Mallowan, and archeologist in training. Max showed Agatha around the site and ‚Äúeach found the other‚Äôs company relaxing‚Äù (7).\n\nMax and Agatha fell in love, their relationship ‚Äúforged by travel‚Äù (8). Max proposed to Agatha on the last night of his trip to Ashfield, her family home. They were married on September 11, 1930. Max and Agatha spent their summers at Ashfield, springs on archeological digs, and the rest of the year in London or at their home in Wallingford, Oxfordshire.\n\nThroughout most of her marriage to Max, Agatha was writing two or three books a year. When they were on Max‚Äôs digs, she would write ‚Äúa chapter or two during quiet mornings and helped out on site in the afternoon‚Äù (9). Many of Agatha‚Äôs Middle Eastern themed or placed books came out of this period.\n\nIn 1938, Agatha and Max bought Greenway House on the River Dart to replace Ashfield. During World War Two, though, the home was taken over by Americans. Agatha also worried they‚Äôd have to sell Greenway House in order to pay taxes. During the war, Max was in Cairo, using his knowledge of languages to assist the war effort; Agatha stayed in London, doing much as she did during the First World War, volunteering at the dispensary at University College Hospital, and writing. Agatha wrote N or M? as a patriotic gesture at this time, but the publication of the book was delayed so it didn‚Äôt quite have the effect she‚Äôd have liked.\n\nWith Max gone, and there being so much less to do, Agatha‚Äôs output during the Second World War was prolific. Between 1939 and 1945, Agatha published twelve books under both her name and as Mary Westmacott. In 1946, her cover as Westmacott was blown and she stopped using that name; she had ‚Äúenjoyed the freedom to write without the pressure of being Agatha Christie‚Äù (10).\n\nAfter the war, Agatha‚Äôs output slowed. She had Max back, and the tax implications of her writing were just too much. Throughout the rest of the 40s and 50s, she worked on theatrical productions, and less on books. (Though she would continue to publish throughout the rest of her life, she wasn‚Äôt putting out multiple books a year anymore, and some years would publish nothing.)\n\nOne of her theatrical contributions was The Mousetrap. Premiering in the West End on November 25, 1952, The Mousetrap is the world‚Äôs longest running play, never having ceased performance since then. It has been performed over 25,000 times.\n\nAgatha‚Äôs last public appearance was at the premiere for the 1974 film of Murder on the Orient Express, with Albert Finney. Agatha liked the film but thought Poirot‚Äôs mustaches ‚Äúweren‚Äôt luxurious enough‚Äù (11).\n\nAgatha Christie Mallowan died on January 12, 1976. She is buried at St. Mary‚Äôs, Cholsey, near Wallingford.\n\nAgatha Christie holds a number of records for her works. As mentioned, The Mousetrap is the world‚Äôs longest running play. She‚Äôs also in the Guinness Book of World Records as the best selling novelist of all time, with over two billion copies of her books in print. She is the world‚Äôs third most-published author, behind only Shakespeare and the Bible. She is the most translated individual, having been translated into 103 languages. And And Then There Were None (first published in 1939) is the best selling mystery novel in the world, and one of the best selling books ever, with 100 million sales.\n\nThat‚Äôs Agatha Christie, quick and not super in depth, but hopefully fun. I love Agatha Christie, I love Poirot (David Suchet forever!) and Miss Marple. I wanted to do something about her for her 125th birthday, and so many other events in her life happened in September, I thought why not. I‚Äôll probably wind up rereading some Agatha Christie tomorrow, or maybe finally read The Mysterious Affair at Styles (surprisingly hard to track down‚Ä¶). Happy early birthday, Agatha!\n\n1, 2, 3 ‚Äì Agatha Christie, Childhood\n\n4, 5, 6 ‚Äì Agatha Christie, Poirot is Born\n\n7, 8, 9 ‚Äì Agatha Christie, A New Start\n\n10, 11 ‚Äì Agatha Christie, Autumn\n\nLast week, we learned about Gertrude Ederle‚Äôs early life, her Olympic achievements, and her first attempt to swim the English Channel. This time, her second attempt and the rest of her life and legacy.\n\nSo, for her second attempt, Ederle decided not to have the WSA sponsor her again, instead coming up with the $9,000 herself. She secured contracts with both the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune. These papers sponsored her in return for having the first interviews with her upon her success.\n\nIn 1926, when Ederle made her second attempt, many other women were attempting to swim the Channel too. In addition to Ederle, Lillian Cannon, Clarabelle Barrett, and Amelia Gade Corson tried. Ederle said her ‚Äúresolve was strengthened by the fact that competitors were trying to do the same thing‚Äù (1). Cannon was sponsored by the Baltimore Post; the Post tried to create a rivalry between Cannon and Ederle, since both women were training in France at the same time.\n\nOn August 6, 1926, Ederle began her trip from Cape Gris-Nez, near Calais in France. Ederle was outfitted with a red two piece bathing suit that she had created with her sister, a red diving cap, and yellow goggles. Burgess had used motorcycle goggles in 1911to help protect his eyes from the salt water; Ederle did the same, edging hers in paraffin wax to make them more watertight for her eyes. Ederle also coated herself in a combination of olive oil, lanolin, and Vasoline to help insulate her from the cold water, and from possible jellyfish stings.\n\nEderle took off from Cape Gris-Nez at 7:08 in the morning. The weather started out alright, but grew increasingly rough. Around the six hour mark, the cross currents were incredibly dangerous. At hour twelve she was just exhausted and with the bad weather, Burgess asked her if she wanted to stop. ‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù was her response.\n\nEderle‚Äôs attempt was followed by two boats. The main tug boat had her father and her sister, Meg, on it, as well as a reporter from the New York Daily News. The reporter wouldn‚Äôt let other reporters on the boat, and so other reporters hired a second tug so they could follow. At a few points in the crossing, the second tug came in very close to Ederle, nearly hurting her chances for success. This second tug also ‚Äúled to accusations in the British press that the two tugs had in fact sheltered Edele from the bad weather and thus made her swim ‚Äòeasier‚Äô‚Äù (2).\n\nEderle said that she was kept motivated ‚Äúby several encouraging telegrams that her mother had sent from New York, and which her supporters read to her during the swim‚Äù (3). She sang ‚ÄúLet Me Call You Sweetheart‚Äù to herself, to the beat of her stroke. Anything she could do to push herself she did. She paused every so often for food, ‚Äúbeef broth and bits of cold chicken ‚Äì extended to her from the accompanying boat on a long pole‚Äù (4).\n\nAfter fourteen hours, thirty-one (or thirty-four) minutes, Ederle came ashore in Kingsdown, Kent, near Dover. Ederle‚Äôs trip had been about thrity-five miles due to the rough weather; the crossing is actually only a twenty-one mile trip. (The trip from France to England is considered a rougher, more dangerous trip than the trip from England to France.) The first person Ederle met in England was a British immigration officer, asking for her passport.\n\nEderle‚Äôs record for swimming the English Channel stood until 1950, when Florence Chadwick did it in thirteen hours, twenty minutes. (Ederle never considered her record beaten though, since she had swum so much farther due to the rough weather.) Of the other women who were also trying the swim in 1926, Barrett and Cannon did not succeed. Corson did succeed three weeks after Ederle, but was fifty minutes slower.\n\nIn Kingsdown, there were ‚Äúscreaming spectators, flares, and searchlights ‚Ä¶ waiting for her‚Äù (5). Ederle‚Äôs father had bet Lloyd‚Äôs of London that his daughter would succeed, making $175,000 on the bet. On return to New York he handed out free frankfurters in his neighborhood to celebrate. When Ederle returned to New York, she was greeted by massive crowds at the dock and in all the streets. She was given a ticker-tape parade and over two million people lined the streets. New York‚Äôs Mayor Jimmy Walker congratulated her at City Hall. She was invited to the White House to meet President Coolidge, who called her ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Best Girl‚Äù.\n\nEderle had at least two songs written for her: ‚ÄúTell Me, Trudy, Who‚Äôs Going to Be the Lucky One?‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrudy‚Äù by Charles Tobias and Al Sherman (crowds always called her Trudy, though her family called her Gertie). She had a dance step named for her. She was nicknamed ‚ÄúQueen of the Waves‚Äù. In New York she was ‚Äúflooded with book, movie, and stage offers, as well as proposals for marriage‚Äù (6). Ederle played herself in the movie Swim Girl, Swim with Bebe Daniels. She toured the vaudeville circuit too.\n\nBy 1928, though, all of this had drained her health and she suffered a nervous breakdown. Her manager also didn‚Äôt know how to market her after her initial fame, so between that and the onset of the Great Depression, she didn‚Äôt wind up making much money, despite all her fame. She had also never finished school, and was only interested in swimming, and so had a rough transition to adulthood.\n\nIn 1933 Ederle fell down the steps in her apartments building, twisting her spine. She was bedridden, in a cast for four to five years. She had very limited mobility and was in near constant pain. She never competed again, but in 1939, at the New York World‚Äôs Fair, she did perform in Billy Rose‚Äôs Aquacade.\n\nEderle did have a lasting impact on women in sports though. When she was coming up, women were slowly being able to swim and compete. With her successful swimming of the Channel, people could see just what women were capable of.\n\nEderle had suffered from the measles as a child, and had hearing problems because of it. She had been warned against swimming affecting her hearing, but just wanted to swim. Her hearing was permanently damaged during her Channel cross, and by the 1940s she was practically deaf. While she never learned sign language, she managed to teach swimming to children at the Lexington School for the Deaf.\n\nDuring World War II, Ederle worked at LaGuardia checking flight instruments. She quit this job after the war; she could have continued the work if she had wanted to move to Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nDespite all the proposals she got when she returned to New York, Ederle never married. She had one serious proposal, but when she pointed out the difficulties they would have ‚Äúbecause of the social limitations caused by her deafness‚Äù (7), he left. She did not want to go through that again, and so never put herself in that position again. Instead, she lived with a few female friends in Queens, before eventually moving to a nursing home in New Jersey.\n\nIn 1965, Ederle was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame as an ‚ÄúHonor Swimmer.‚Äù In 1980 she was inducted into the Women‚Äôs Sports Hall of Fame. Her one ambition in life had been to swim the Channel and she did it. Over the years, as anniversaries of her swim would come up, she would be interviewed for the papers. She always granted the interviews, but never wanted to be made pitiable. ‚ÄúI have no complaints ‚Ä¶ I am comfortable and satisfied. I am not a person who reaches for the moon as long as I have the stars‚Äù (8).\n\nGertrude Ederle died on November 30, 2003 in Wyckoff, New Jersey at age 98. She‚Äôs interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.\n\nEvery year there is an annual swim, following her 1925 route from Battery Park to Sandy Hook called the Ederle Swim. In the Upper West Side Manhattan, near where she grew up, there is the Gertrude Ederle Recreation Center. In 2010, there was a radio play by Anita Sullivan about Ederle, based on Gavin Mortimer‚Äôs 2008 book The Great Swim. So Ederle lives on (even through a yarn colorway). You can watch a newsreel from her swim on YouTube.\n\n1, 3, 5, 6 ‚Äì Gertrude Ederle Facts, YourDictionary.\n\n2 ‚Äì Gertrude Ederle.\n\n4, 7 ‚Äì Ann T. Keene, ‚ÄúGertrude Ederle,‚Äù American National Biography Online.\n\n8 ‚Äì Richard Severo, ‚ÄúGertrude Ederle, the First Woman to Swim Across the English Channel, Dies at 98,‚Äù The New York Times, December 1, 2003.\n\nThis topic came to me in a weird way. About a year and a half ago I was out buying yarn with my friend. I found one I really liked, this gorgeous deep green, deep purple, and maroon variegated one. It was being discontinued so I snapped it up. The tag on it about the yarn and the company and everything, had the name of the colorway: Gertrude Ederle. The tag also gave a brief bio of the person. (Turns out the yarn line did all their colorways based on famous, important women. I wish they hadn‚Äôt gone out of business, it‚Äôs so cool!) So Gertrude Ederle has been in my head for about that long. Well, last week I saw a list of famous women you should know, or some such thing, and she was on there too, so I decided she was going to be my next topic.\n\nGertrude Ederle was born October 23, 1905 in New York City. Her parents were Henry and Anna Ederle, ‚ÄúGerman immigrants who owned a butcher shop on Manhattan‚Äôs Upper West Side‚Äù (1). Ederle was the third of Henry and Anna‚Äôs six children (four girls, two boys). Ederle worked in her parent‚Äôs butcher shop after school and during the summertime.\n\nHer parents also had a small summer cottage in New Jersey, where her father taught Ederle to swim. Ederle had had measles when she was young, and her hearing had been damaged. ‚ÄúThe doctors told me my hearing would get worse if I continued swimming, but I loved the water so much, I just couldn‚Äôt stop,‚Äù she recalled (2). Ederle said she was a water baby and was ‚Äúhappiest in the waves‚Äù (3). She spent most of her time in the ocean, even though her doctors had given her that warning. While she didn‚Äôt care, her father did, disapproving of Ederle‚Äôs swimming.\n\nBack in New York, Ederle would swim in the ‚Äú10th Avenue horse troughs, earning punishment from her father‚Äù (4). When she was twelve, Ederle joined the Women‚Äôs Swimming Association (WSA). For $3 a year, Ederle had access to the WSA‚Äôs facilities and trainers. At this time, swimming was really taking off as a sport, and the WSA was the center of competitive swimming, training others such as Esther Williams. The new bathing suits that had been developed since the turn of the century really helped increase a swimmer‚Äôs speed through the water.\n\nAdditionally, the WSA‚Äôs director, Charlotte ‚ÄúEppy‚Äù Epstein, was able to convince the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) ‚Äúto endorse women‚Äôs swimming as a sport in 1917 and in 1919 pressured the AAU to ‚Äòallow swimmers to remove their stockings for competition as long as they quickly put on a robe once they got out of the water‚Äô‚Äù (5). Also, former Olympian Louis Handley worked at the WSA, developing new swimming styles. Handley developed the American crawl, based on the Australian crawl, at the WSA; Ederle would later adapt Handley‚Äôs American crawl further. These factors made the WSA the place to be for up and coming swimmers in the early 1900s, and turned swimming into an acceptable sport for women to practice and even compete in.\n\nThe year Ederle joined the WSA, at age twelve, she set her first world record in the 880 yard freestyle. This made Ederle the youngest world record holder in swimming. She would set eight more world records, setting seven alone in one afternoon at Brighton Beach in 1922; she would also hold 29 combined US national and world records between 1921 and 1925. At age sixteen (1921/22), Ederle won her first championship as the Metropolitan New York junior 100-meter freestyle champion (6).\n\nOn August 1, 1922, Ederle won the Joseph P. Day Cup. This was a three and a half mile race across New York Bay. Before this Ederle had only ever done short races, but she beat 51 other competitors ‚Äúincluding Helen Wainwright and British Champion Hilda James‚Äù (Wainwright will come up again later) (7). Over the next few years Ederle broke nine world records in races from one- to five-hundred meters, and ‚Äúwon six national outdoor swimming titles, and earned more than two dozen trophies‚Äù (8). Ederle always said she enjoyed ‚Äúbeating men‚Äôs records, proving that women could succeed in reaching sports goals that most people thought were impossible‚Äù (9).\n\nIn 1924, Ederle was part of the United States Olympic team for swimming, for that year‚Äôs Paris Olympics. During the Olympics Ederle had an injured knee. Additionally, the US did not want its athletes corrupted by Paris‚Äôs low morals, so just to get to the venues to practice and compete, the swimmers had to travel five to six hours. Despite all this, the US won 99 medals in Paris. Ederle won three: gold as a member of the 4x100m freestyle (setting a new world record of 4:58.8 for the event), and bronze in the individual 100m and 400m freestyles. Ederle had been favored for golds in all her events and ‚Äúwould later say her failure to win three golds was the biggest disappointment of her career‚Äô‚Äù (10).\n\nIn 1925, Ederle swam from Battery Park, NY, to Sandy Hook, NJ. The twenty-two mile trip took her only seven hours and eleven minutes. This record stood for eighty-one years. Ederle‚Äôs nephew believed this was her warm up for what she would do next.\n\nIn 1925, the WSA sponsored Helen Wainwright (who Ederle had beat in that 1922 race), one of the other members of the gold-medal winning 4√ó100 team, and Ederle to swim across the English Channel. Only five men had ever swum the Channel (two Americans, two English, and one Argentinian), the first, Englishman Matthew Webb, having done so in 1875, and the best being done in sixteen hours, thirty-three minutes by Enrique Tiraboschi. Wainwright and Ederle would be the first women if they were successful.\n\nUnfortunately, Wainwright had to drop out pretty quickly due to an injury. Ederle decided she would still do it though. Ederle trained with Jabez Wolffe, who had tried to swim the Channel twenty-two times. Pretty much from the beginning things seemed strained between them. Wolffe almost immediately tried to get Ederle to slow down, believing she wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep it up at the speed she was going.\n\nDespite this, Ederle made her attempt on August 18, 1925. This attempt was not successful though. Ederle was disqualified when Wolffe thought she was drowning and had someone attempt to rescue her. As soon as the other person touched Ederle, she was disqualified. Ederle said she was not drowning, but was just resting, floating face-down in the water. Other stories have it that Wolffe thought she had swallowed too much ocean water, or that he thought the current was too rough, or that he thought she was seasick. Whatever exactly happened, this first time Ederle was disqualified, and Wolffe was fired as her trainer.\n\nEderle was not going to quit though, and hired a new trainer, Thomas William Burgess. Burgess had swum the Channel in 1911, one of those five successful men, after having tried thirty-two previous times; less than seven percent of attempts to swim the Channel are successful.\n\nI‚Äôm going to stop there for now. Ederle‚Äôs had her first attempt at swimming the Channel and was not successful. She‚Äôs going to try again. Will she do it? Next time, we‚Äôll find out (though I‚Äôm sure you can guess the answer).\n\n1 ‚Äì ‚ÄúGertrude Ederle,‚Äù Bio.

This time‚Ä¶ The rest of Olive‚Äôs life.\n\nOn the night of September 4-5, Olive and Jack were out late, partying in Montparnasse. They returned to their hotel around 3am that night. Jack passed out pretty quickly upon their arrival back at the hotel. Olive went to the bathroom to take medicine of some kind: aspirin, sleeping medicine, cold medicine, or even just water, it‚Äôs not clear. What is clear is that, instead of taking whatever she had intended, Olive took bichloride of mercury liquid. This either had a label in French, or no label, causing the confusion over what she was taking. It seems like the mercury was Jack‚Äôs for his syphilis.\n\nAfter she realized she‚Äôd taken the wrong thing, Olive started shouting. Jack woke up and ‚Äúforced water, egg whites, milk and butter down her throat‚Äù (1). He carried her to the bed and called for an ambulance. Olive was taken to the American Hospital in Paris where doctor‚Äôs tried their best to keep her alive. Olive ‚Äúlost the power of speech and sight‚Äù and so was unable ‚Äúto explain how she came to make the mistake of drinking from the bottle‚Äù (2). Olive died at 10:15 on the morning of September 10, 1920, a month shy of her twenty-sixth birthday.\n\nIt‚Äôs not clear if she took the mercury ‚Äúaccidentally, committed suicide or was murdered by her husband‚Äù (3). The reasons for a possible suicide included: supposed trouble adjusting to fame, Jack‚Äôs infidelities, Jack‚Äôs having given her syphilis. There were also rumors that Olive had a drug addiction, or that Jack tricked Olive to take the mercury so he could collect insurance money on her. Michelle Vogel, author of Olive Thomas: The Life and Death of a Silent Film Beauty, believes that ‚Äúthe actress drank the poison accidentally‚Äù but that Jack‚Äôs ‚Äúalcoholism and incurable womanizing contributed‚Äù (4). Whatever it was that caused Olive to ingest the poison, her death was ruled an accident, having been caused by nephritis from the mercury bichloride.\n\nAt the inquest into her death, ‚Äúmaids and valets of the hotel‚Äù were ‚Äúunanimous that up to the hour of her death Miss Thomas was ‚Ä¶ of a happy disposition and serene and content with her life and its future prospects.‚Äù Additionally, it was reported that Olive ‚Äúwas planning to come back to Paris‚Äù to work for Mary Pickford‚Äôs ex-husband, and had ‚Äúbeen busy buying frocks for new plays in which she was to appear‚Äù (5).\n\nAfter Olive‚Äôs death, Jack gave interviews to newspapers and was quoted about how hard both Olive and the doctors struggled to keep her alive. He gave his full account of what happened to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. Jack brought Olive‚Äôs body back home to the United States. It was rumored that he tried to commit suicide on the voyage over, but was talked out of it. Years later in her autobiography Mary Pickford says he confessed that to be true.\n\nOlive‚Äôs funeral was held on September 28 at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in New York. Fifteen thousand mourners tried to pack into the church, so many more so than expected that ‚Äúit was found necessary to increase the number of policemen on duty from ten to twenty-five‚Äù (6). Women fainted and men‚Äôs hats were crushed, the crowd was so thick. Olive‚Äôs casket was ‚Äúblanketed in purple orchids, topped by a spray of yellow and brown orchids from Jack Pickford‚Äù (7). Olive was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, originally just in a vault, but in 1921 was ‚Äúput in the recently completed Pickford mausoleum‚Äù (8).\n\nOlive‚Äôs estate was split between her mother, brothers, and Jack. Jack did not take his share, giving it to her mother instead. In November, Olive‚Äôs things were sold off in an estate sale. ‚ÄúNearly $20,000 was realized from the sale of the jewelry, and one of her two automobiles was sold for $5,000. The entire proceeds of the sale were about $30,000‚Äù (9). Items sold also included a cigarette case, a gold toilet set, and a sable coat.\n\nOlive is fascinating in her death. This was one of the first times the media really sensationalized a Hollywood star. Her death was also one of the first Hollywood scandals; hers and others that soon followed led to morality clauses being written into actors‚Äô contracts. As Dr. Jeanine Basinger, chair of Wesleyan University‚Äôs film studies program, said ‚ÄúHad he not been Mary Pickford‚Äôs brother, had they not been married, had they both not been in movies, the death would not have been sensationalized in the same way it was‚Äù (10).\n\nRumor has it that her ghost still haunts the New Amsterdam Theatre (the theater where she worked in the Ziegfeld Follies). In 1997, ‚Äúa security guard resigned after seeing a woman in lingerie wandering the stage clutching a green bottle, and cast members still touch a portrait of Olive as they leave the stage door every night‚Äù (11). Others say her ghost is ‚Äúcrying, in a white dress trimmed in silver;‚Äù supposedly ‚Äúshe was buried in a white dress trimmed in silver‚Äù (12).\n\nSo that‚Äôs Olive Thomas. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm so drawn to Olive‚Äôs story. For sure she ticks off many boxes of my favorite things ‚Äì old, silent Hollywood; flappers; tragic death ‚Äì but some of those I didn‚Äôt really realize until I started researching her for this. I didn‚Äôt know the movie that made her a star was The Flapper, or if I had known I‚Äôd forgotten; maybe it still niggled in my head and made me want to know more somehow. At any rate, she has such an interesting history and such a tragic end; I wish more people knew of her.\n\n1, 3, 4, 10, Marylynne Pitz, ‚ÄúOlive Thomas, the original ‚ÄòFlapper‚Äô and a Mon valley native, still fascinates,‚Äù Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, September 26, 2010.\n\n2 ‚ÄúOlive Thomas Near Death,‚Äù The New York Times, September 10, 1920.\n\n5 ‚ÄúMiss Thomas‚Äô Death Found Accidental,‚Äù The New York Times, September 12, 1920.\n\n6, 7 ‚ÄúWomen Faint at Olive Thomas Rite,‚Äù The New York Times, September 29, 1920.\n\n8 ‚ÄúOlive Pickford Put in Mausoleum,‚Äù The New York Times, September 26, 1921.\n\n9 ‚ÄúOlive Thomas Sale Amounts to $30,000,‚Äù The New York Times, November 23, 1920.\n\n11 Tony Perrottet, ‚ÄúTraces of Ziegfeld‚Äôs New York,‚Äù The New York Times, May 8, 2015.\n\n12 William Grimes, ‚ÄúA Gang of Ghosts Ready to Rumble,‚Äù The New York Times, October 29, 1993."
