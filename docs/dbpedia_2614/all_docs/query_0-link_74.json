These objects are manufactured from a variety of materials, most often metals, and were often, but not always, worn as pendants. However, all are miniatures, objects shaped like something else – tools, weapons, animals, people, or more abstract religious symbols, including hammers and crosses. They can be understood as material symbols which gained meaning through reference to phenomena beyond themselves – real animals, people and so on. I argue that this symbolism must be understood within a religious frame of reference. Previous archaeological research into Viking Age religion has suffered from an uncritical acceptance of written sources that are late, biased and geographically isolated. Since religion is also behaviour in the world, there is no intrinsic reason why texts should be a better source of information that should artefacts. As an archaeological material, the corpus of amulets has a history of recovery. Analysis of times of recovery for different types of contexts reveals how the composition of the archaeological archive changes. Contemporary texts highlight the different priorities and interests, which in turn shaped research strategies. Thus, it is clear that the archive cannot be isolated from its own history. The archive represents a real, but partial record of what existed in the past. The history of recovery throws light on how the archive is partial. The present study examines the various types, materials and contexts of the amulets. It documents how amulet types have different dates and distributions, suggesting that religious practise changed through time. Some of this change may be due to influences from Christian Europe, but this may not explain everything. In any case, the chronology and distribution of amulets suggest that late, Norse sources may not be perfectly suited for understanding all amulets everywhere in the Viking world. I divide contexts into four types, graves, hoards, settlement finds and stray finds. Amulets in graves do not appear to reflect accidental inclusions of whatever the living used, but were rather selected carefully to answer needs specific to the dead. Many burial amulets are made of iron, and may have been made specifically for burial. Silver is largely absent, and may have been part of collective, rather than individual wealth. Hoard finds are dominated by silver. Viking Age silver hoards seem to be explicable in purely economic terms. There seems no reason to regard these hoards as ritual or sacral in any way. Settlement finds cluster on a few important sites, including Hedeby, Helgö, Birka and Tissø. Unfortunately, these sites do not compare readily with each other, and no clear pattern of intersite distribution appears. Most settlement finds are made from supposedly cheap materials, including iron and lead, suggesting that the amulets selected for graves and hoards do not represent everything. At least part of the settlement material seems to have been intentionally deposited. Stray finds highlight the influence of post-depositional factors. Much may originate in other contexts, and stray simply due to accident or poor recording. However, the stray finds also contain unreasonable amounts of copper-alloys, suggesting that this material cannot simply represent accidental strays from other contexts. Rather, amulets of copperalloy, especially, must have been used in activities that did not centre on burial, hoarding or settlement. Possibly, these amulets were specifically deposited at sites away from the settlements. Finally, I offer some tentative suggestions for how to relate amulet studies with emergent archaeological theory on personhood and the landscape. I analyse craftsmanship in some detail, and argue that a wide variety of different situations existed. Some craftspeople were clients of the elite, others free traders, and there is little reason to think that they were uniformly credited with supernatural gifts.\n\ni\n\nForeword This text is adapted from my Ph.D.-thesis, written at the University of Copenhagen in the period 2005-2008 and rewritten in English in 2009. The work has received a decidedly mixed reception from colleagues, which is only what I should expect: I am dissatisfied with much of what gets written in Viking Age archaeology, and I think many archaeologists are entirely too uncritical in how they use written sources. We have a body of sources, most of them very late, very North-Western, and all of them very difficult to understand, and I see archaeologists rush in where historians and linguists fear to tread. I have not minced words in expressing my concern over this, and my esteemed colleagues have not minced words in explaining to me that they disagree. In particular, many seem so in love with the game of speculative interpretation that they will accept no methodological critique that forecloses that option. The idea that archaeologists should actually base our work on the sort of sources and facts we know best has proven remarkably unpopular, while the idea that we might actually read some theory not pre-digested by our Cambridge colleagues has been received as virtual heresy. I am increasingly concerned that Scandinavian Iron Age archaeology is turning into a house of straw built on the quicksand of silent agreement. There seems to be an unhealthy fashion for accepting interpretations simply on the say so of our excavators, and for skipping actual argumentation. I cannot but think this imprudent. That said, I must thank the people who opened their doors and especially their archives to me when I collected my catalogue. I must also thank those who discussed these issues with me. Most particularly, I must thank Dr. Ulla Lund Hansen, my chief supervisor and Dr. Morten Warmind, my supporting supervisor, for their help, critique and patience.

On a practical note, the catalogue is presented as an Access database. Those who truly need paper are advised to design their own reports from the database. Any standard report becomes prohibitively long and dull, and given the current state of the world’s environment, we are probably better off with only the hard-copies that we truly need.\n\nii\n\nThe easiest way to use the database is to open the formula “sites”. Here, users can search for specific place-names or other relevant criteria. Information about individual contexts with the site (e.g. graves on a grave-field) appears in the nested sub-formula, and information about individual amulets in these contexts in a sub-formula nested within this one. Users can scroll through the subformulas using the arrows at the bottom or standard scrolling functions.\n\nPlease note that the database is available to download from www.barpublishing.com/additional-downloads.html\n\niii\n\nContents Part 1: Background and context 1) Introduction 1.1) The structure of the work 1.2) Method: discipline rather than interdisciplinary approaches 1.3) Delimitation: what are “Viking Age amulets”?

They are a remarkable body of evidence, but one that has so far received little systematic attention. Many pieces have not been published at all, and those that have, have often only been mentioned briefly ways in publications dedicated to other topics, such as excavation reports. The notable exceptions from these observations are Birgit Arrhenius’ early introduction to the subject (Arrhenius 1961) and Miriam Krogtvedgaard Zeiten’s more recent survey of the Danish material (Zeiten 1997). These works are valuable, but limited in scope: Arrhenius’ text is limited to Sweden, and while it does introduce most of the types, it does not attempt any quantitative overview. Also, since 1961, a lot has happened: new material has been found and new interpretations suggested. Zeiten’s work is longer, more ambitious and more up to date, but is limited to Denmark and immediate surroundings. Others have discussed individual types in great detail, most notably Jörn Staecker (1999a). However, such efforts have been limited to crosses, Thor’s hammers and a few other types. As a result, most types, most areas and most problems have only been treated in unsystematic ways. This has created much confusion and more than a few mistakes. As detailed below, several interpretations seem based on counterfactual claims about the material.\n\nI am unhappy with the way many archaeologists approach the Viking Age. To take a random example, in his 1954 article on amulets and idols, Sigurd Grieg took as his starting point the image of Thor at Hundrop. This idol is not an artefact preserved today. Instead, it is only know from a description in the saga of Olav the holy (Grieg 1954, 157). Thus, Grieg chose a written source as starting point for his discussion of an archaeological material. When writing about a class of material objects, Grieg preferred text to object. He had more confidence in the text’s ability to tell us about Viking Age use of these artefacts than in the artefacts themselves. Grieg’s text is but one example of a very common tendency to reduce the archaeological material to mere illustrations of the written sources. This tradition makes much of the archaeological research in the Viking Age and its religion inaccessible for non-specialists. Many archaeologists use jargon such as blót and hov, volva and shaman, cosmology and hierorgamy, as if these terms were self-explicatory and demanded no further introduction or justification. Experts draw on texts such as Saxo and Snorre, Völurspá and Austrfárarvisur, as if their authority, credibility and relevancy were selfevident. The more extreme writers even insist on authentic Old Norse spellings or on quoting sources Old Norse, Greek and so on without translation. This seems absurd and unhelpful. In addition, much of this tradition builds on hermeneutic readings of obscure sources, and implicit theoretical premises so complicated that the resulting research becomes virtually occult. A reader might easily get the impression that it is impossible to study the archaeology of the Viking Age without having read all of the mythological literature.\n\nThe present work builds on a catalogue of some 1350 Viking Age amulets from Scandinavia and the West. It has several aims: 1) To collect a catalogue of these pieces, previously published piecemeal, if at all. 2) To form an informed, statistically credible overview of this material, in order to improve on the somewhat impressionistic approach used by many previous researchers. 3) To problematise the uncritical use of written sources. I argue that there was regional and chronological variation in Viking Age amulet use, and that this consequently cannot be understood from written sources for late, western pagan religion alone. 4) To highlight how archaeology can use the amulets to understand real people in the Viking Age, instead of projecting abstract ideas about gods and beliefs back on the period.\n\nThis, I do not believe. Prehistoric archaeology studies societies without any written sources at all. We try to understand the society of the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age without any written sources. If we can do this, surely we can also understand Viking Age society without having to quote written sources all the time. It cannot be true that we, using the archaeological method, can say less about the Viking Age than about the Neolithic. The methods that work in prehistory must also work in the historical period.\n\nTheoretically, the work builds on several premises: 1) A postmodern scepticism towards the sufficiency of always already established narratives. 2) An archaeological scepticism towards the sufficiency of historical narratives. 3) A pragmatic recognition that some theories are more convincing than others, and that those most strongly supported by archaeological evidence should be most convincing in\n\nThe text-centred tradition does no justice to the archaeological material. After Grieg wrote, the archaeological find-picture has changed markedly. Our 1\n\nViking Age amulets in Scandinavia and Western Europe Western Scandinavia. The archaeological sources are better at throwing light on the real variation than are the written sources, because the archaeological sources are far more widely distributed in time and space.\n\nsources have multiplied. The same is not true for the historical sources. Much has happened in the development of historical method after Grieg. However, any present day investigation taking its starting point in the saga of Olav the Holy would add very little of archaeological interest to Grieg’s findings, except for new illustrations. The information about the amulets in the written sources is unchanged despite all improvements in the readings of these sources. We cannot utilise our archaeological evidence to its greatest potential if we keep prioritising the written sources. Therefore, in the present work, I shall attempt something else: I shall attempt to understand the amulets of the Viking Age by taking the amulets themselves as my starting point. I shall attempt to de-mystify and deromance them, and see them as archaeological objects to be understood within an archaeological approach.\n\n1.1) The structure of the work The work begins with a delimitation (part 1, where we are now), followed of a theoretical discussion (part 2). After this, the amulet material is presented, divided into types (part 3) and materials (part 4), types of context (part 5) and combinations (part 6). An important goal of these sections (3-6) is to show that there really is geographical and chronological variation in the material (elaborated in part 7). This has not been generally recognised in earlier studies. It means that the amulets’ use and meaning also varied in time and space, and that for instance Icelandic medieval sources are not necessarily relevant for all of Scandinavia’s Viking Age. This is important relative to my theoretical starting point. My analysis progresses gradually from the individual amulet to the total findcontext. In the work’s final part, I shall attempt to go even further and locate the contexts in larger context, by discussing the amulets in landscape, society and the creation of identities (part 8). This must necessarily be speculative, but builds on the more factual empirical investigations in the earlier sections. Finally, last chapter contains a summary and some conclusions (part 9).\n\nThis means that the meaning of the amulets must be drawn from the amulets themselves, their contexts and regional distribution. I have no confidence in archaeological interpretations that privilege written sources or theoretical models borrowed from other disciplines over the archaeological material. This must also inform questions of what we can reasonably expect to find out. There are tasks that the archaeological method is well suited for, and tasks it is poorly suited for. It is well suited to understand physical objects, mirroring the physical reality of antiquity, though influenced by post-depositional factors. It is unsuited to throw light on ideal structures and transcendental meanings, disassociated from the material. Such analyses must be entrusted to historians and historians of religion, who have a body of methods better suited for them.\n\nThus, the general structure of the work is that the amulets are first discussed as single objects (part 3-4), then localised in context of the find (5-6), and finally interpreted in relation to a larger, reconstructed social context (7). Each section draws to some degree on the previous ones. Especially section 3, 4 and 5 about the individual types, respectively types of context, obviously draw on each other. Each individual find consists both of an amulet and a context. However, to improve readability I have chosen to start with it smallest unit, the individual amulet. The next sections (6, 7 and 8) are one-sidedly derived from these earlier ones. It would not be possible to discuss these problems without these earlier discussions.\n\nSpecifically, I shall interpret the amulets as material symbols. The present work takes its starting point in the hypothesis that the archaeological material from the Viking Age includes amulets, and that these can be understood as symbolic objects. If this is correct, it follows that contexts for amulets can be understood as symbolic contexts. Differences in the amulet material from different contexts, periods and regions can mirror real differences in Viking Age symbolism. If this symbolism was partially religious, such differences may also throw light on differences in concrete cult practice. These differences can possibly indicate more general differences in religion. Thus, the overreaching thesis is that an archaeological treatment of the amulets can throw light on of the Viking Age system of symbols and possibly religion, and indicate variations invisible in the written sources. However, I must be stress that the main focus of this text is the concrete amulets, not some abstract religion.\n\nThe work has three aims: to account for the amulets as archaeological material, by collecting the most complete catalogue ever seen; to interpret the amulets as sourcematerial in relation to current theoretical problems; and to show how humanist theoretical discussions can be elucidated on through concrete, archaeological observations. However, it is not my goal to throw light on Viking Age religion as a more general phenomenon. Nor is it my aim to solve problems in the history of religions far removed from archaeological material. These problems, I leave to those qualified to deal with them.\n\nIt is a fundamental assumption for this work that the Viking Age system of symbols was more varied than the written sources can show. It is also a fundamental assumption that one-sided dependency on written sources has created a falsely homogenous image of the period. This image is really only relevant for late Viking Age\n\n1.2) Method: discipline rather than interdisciplinary approaches The study of the Viking Age is an interdisciplinary field. It draws the interest of archaeologists, historians, and researchers on religions and language. If the amulets of 2\n\n1: Background and contex demands readers fluent in eight dead languages (Niels Lund in lecture 2002). The secondary literature demands rather more. In addition, from an archaeological viewpoint, this literature is indeed secondary: our primary sources are not the theories of other archaeologists, or other researchers, but the archaeological material itself. Those theories that do not build on material can be safely ignored. Consequently, I have decided to prioritise material over interpretations, and only discussed interpretations in as far as they could be related to the archaeological material. This approach has resulted in an extensive catalogue, as far as I know it most extensive and complete catalogue of Viking Age amulets ever collected. I believe such a catalogue is valuable in itself. It provides a far better basis for observations than any previous, less extensive catalogue can do. Consequently, I also believe that observations based on this catalogue are better than are observations based on less extensive catalogues. Even if the conclusions are the same, they must be considered better founded when they are based on more observations. Finally, I have used these observations in a discussion about interpretations. In this phase of the work, earlier research is of obvious relevance, but also obviously subject to re-evaluation. The whole point in collecting new and more complete catalogue is to tie interpretation more firmly to the material. If older interpretations could not be re-evaluated in relation to new material, there would be no sense in collecting new evidence. Archaeology’s greatest strength is that our material is ever growing. We cannot take advantage of this if we maintain an un-reflexive respect for earlier generations of researchers. We must base our interpretations on a critical evaluation of argument and material. Archaeological theories cannot be evaluated on whether they were suggested by Mackeprang, Müller or Montelius. They must be evaluated on whether they retain their credibility in relation to the archaeological primary material.\n\nthe Viking Age are to be understood in relation to the religions of the time, the interdisciplinary aspect is even stronger. Despite this, I have chosen not to prioritise interdisciplinary approaches. I have chosen instead to focus on a purely archaeological approach, which I believe interdisciplinary work often ignores. The present work is primarily a piece of archaeological work. During this work, I have benefitted from discussing theories and results with Dr. Morten Warmind, sociologist of religions, but these discussions have also made it even more obvious to me how important it is to know and respect the limits of my own discipline. Archaeologists are not generally qualified to produce original research in history or history of religions. Certainly, I am not. The trained historians and students of religion have a far better understanding of their special sources and methods than we do. However, we do have something to offer as archaeologists: we have access to a unique source-material and a unique collection of methods which permits us to work on altogether different premises than the other disciplines. This does not mean that archaeological knowledge is superior or inferior to other disciplines’ knowledge, but it is different. It throws light on other problems, using other sources. Such archaeological knowledge is in itself valuable for the other disciplines, exactly because it is independent of their sources and methods. An archaeological reading of the saga of Olav the Holy is unlikely to reveal anything new to historians and historians of religion. They can read the text themselves. However, archaeological discussions of an archaeological material may reveal something new. Experts from other disciplines cannot date a pot or grave themselves. The amulets I discus here are archaeological objects. Very possibly, they may also provide evidence for other disciplines, most obviously as sources for the history of religions. However, archaeologists have a special responsibility and a special opportunity to understand them as archaeological sources. Researchers in other disciplines would be able to formulate other interpretations, but such interpretations typically place less weight on the purely archaeological aspects. Similarly, a more interdisciplinary archaeological approach would also pay less attention to these. I do not believe that any such approach is particularly desirable in an archaeological work. I believe that the best interpretations of history or history of religions are written by trained historians and historians of religion, not by archaeologists. As an archaeologist, I would rather write a solid archaeological work than a less wellfounded, interdisciplinary one. Interdisciplinary works must be left to authors who are solidly based in all the relevant disciplines, most obviously through the cooperation between different researchers. Such cooperation was not possible for the present work.\n\nThe analytical method used in this work is to a large degree quantitative. This is an informed choice. I have chosen to prioritise arguments based on many observations over ones based on a few high-quality observations. It is quite possible to base works on microarchaeology, and select a few good contexts to extreme detailed analysis. Indeed, this approach is currently very popular. However, I do not believe that this method is better than the quantitative method. It has some strengths, but also obvious weaknesses, of which it greatest is that the results cannot be generalised. I do not believe that observations based on single contexts can be projected onto other sites, no matter how spectacular, wellexcavated and well-preserved the single contexts might be. On the contrary, some of the best excavated and published sites in amulet-studies are quite obviously atypical sites (Birka, Tissø, Helgö, Borg). Just as Helgö cannot be taken as an example of the Viking Age typical settlements, nor can amulet use on Helgö be taken as typically for amulet use in other Viking Age communities.\n\nMuch has already been written about the Viking Age, and about its religions. I have no mastery of all of this literature. I doubt anyone has. Historian Dr. Niels Lund once pointed out that the primary written sources alone\n\nThis choice of method is also strategic: the aim of this 3\n\nViking Age amulets in Scandinavia and Western Europe believe that those interpretations that are supported by primary data are better than those that are not. This approach should make sense within classical positivist ontology.\n\nwork is to argue that there is regional and chronological variation in the material. This can only be done through regional and chronological comparison. Such comparison is obviously more credible, the bigger a material it builds on. Similarly, this problem has demanded a very large geographical area: all other things being equal, it is more probable that regional variation is visible over large distances than over short distances. To achieve the greatest geographical spread it has been necessary to include as many amulets as possible (but see below, about geographical delimitation).\n\nOn the other hand, I have attempted to make visible the role that post-depositional factors play in the formation of the archaeological achieve. Here, I claim that the body of data we have access to is shaped by our methods. We do not know everything about all Viking Age amulets. We only have whatever information has been recorded about those amulets that are known to us. There are strong grounds to believe that these data are not really representative.\n\nIt is my hope that this approach will also tie the study more closely to everyday archaeology. After the 1970s, archaeology’s day-to-day practice changed very much, and today its everyday activity is dominated by rescue excavations and stray finds. The large research excavations on well-preserved, spectacular sites constitute a rare exception. The vast majority of the archaeological activity is placed elsewhere. I believe that we ought to attempt to make best use of this material. I believe it would be irresponsible to ignore these finds, even if they are not documented under optimal conditions. We shall get never any opportunity for to document these exact pieces under better conditions, and the archaeological material is a limited resource. One of the best illustrations of this may be the finds kept at Saffron Walden Museum, Essex: the Thor’s hammer from the Roddings (cat. 239) was found by a metaldetectorist. Unfortunately, the finder only recognised it as prehistoric several years after it was found. In the meantime, information was lost, and the provenience is consequently imprecise. The cross from Saffron Walden (cat. 240) was found during excavations in the 1800s, with the bad recording so typical of the time. Despite this, these two pieces are some of the finest sources we have for how different Scandinavians in the Danelaw adapted to their new circumstances. If we insist on only working with finds from well-excavated sites, then we can say almost nothing about amulets among the Vikings in the Danelaw. We cannot expect that the better documented material from Scandinavia to say anything about the special, English situation. Although we lack wellexcavated, well-documented sites, these finds highlight that there were Viking Age amulets in England. This material not is optimally documented, but it is the only source we have.\n\nWithin a classical positivist approach, these two projects might seem to contradict each other: if our data are coloured by post-depositional processes, they do not constitute an ideal positivist dataset. Some might even take an extreme point of view, and suggest that the possibility of source-criticism invalidates all conclusions. Certainly, 1980s archaeology showed a marked tendency to focus either on source criticism, and reject all interpretations, or to ignoring all source criticism in order to allow for interpretation. I believe this polarization to be unproductive. We cannot ignore the source-critical problems. Nor can we ignore that some interpretations are better than others. Indeed, I believe that some interpretations are better than others exactly because of source-critical concerns: interpretations that offer few serious problems are better than those handicapped by many such problems. All data sets are coloured by the history of research. Yet, some datasets are better than others. The very bias created by historical factors makes different datasets more or less suited for different projects. Source-criticism is not about declaring once and for all whether a given dataset is “perfect” or “not good enough”, but about evaluating which arguments it is suited or unsuited to support. My goal is to formulate robust archaeological interpretations. A robust interpretation is one that can survive relevant critique. By my definition, an archaeological interpretation is one that finds support in the archaeological material and in a logical argumentation based on this material. Consequently, I have placed less weight on interpretations based on other disciplines (history of religions, history, place name studies, folklore), because these rarely refer to directly to archaeological materials or problems. Any evaluation of these disciplines’ theories demands another set of methods and sources which I, as an archaeologist, cannot marshal.\n\nAll of the above is rather traditional. It is nothing new in archaeology to collect catalogues and base argumentation on observations of an actual material. I think I have been more innovative in that I have tried to follow two “tracks” at the same time.\n\nIn this connection, it makes sense to combine direct descriptions of the known material with reflective sourcecriticism. The direct descriptions permit observations that can strengthen or weaken different interpretations. Source-criticism permits us to evaluate if these observations are caused by post-depositional factors or real variation in antiquity. The reflective source-criticism is consequently an important control, meant to ensure that\n\nOn one hand, I have dealt with an actual set of data: there are about 1350 Viking Age amulets from Scandinavia and Western Europe and these have a number of attributes that van be described reasonably objectively. Each was made from a specific material, found in a specific context and so on. In this argumentation, I 4\n\n1: Background and contex apply to all. Some lack suspension loops, and seem carried in other ways, for instance in leather bags (Näsman 1973, 95, cf. Lindqvist 1915, 115). Also, some are so poorly preserved that it is impossible to decide if they are pendants or not.\n\nthe material-based interpretations actually are robust. I suggest that the established understanding of the amulets is too poor. It has reduced them to illustrations of written sources, which are late and geographical marginal. This tradition cannot account for it regional and chronological variation among the amulets, or the similar variation in religion and cult that probably existed in the period.\n\nOther miniatures seem used as toys. These include e.g. wooden horses and boats from Dublin (Lang 1988, 34 and 80). The metal figurines are generally too small and too two-dimensional to support such an interpretation, and many are undoubtedly pendants, but there are some questionable cases (cf. Sandal 2000, 24).\n\n1.3) Delimitation: what are “Viking Age amulets”? The archaeological material of the Viking Age includes a number of miniature objects whose only use seems to be symbolic. In this work, I shall refer to these as “amulets”. These Viking Age amulets can be defined reasonably sharply in terms of function and chronology, less sharply geographically:\n\nA number of natural objects (fossils, plant seeds, bones etc.) have also occasionally been described as amulets (e.g. Lindeblad & Nielsen 1995, 111). These identifications are often uncertain, based on much older or more recent traditions (Fuglesang 1989, 15). Also, this assembly is not comparable with the above assembly of man-made amulets, because of different conditions of preservation and collection. Similar problems apply for stone axes and for the Irish so-called amulets of polished deer antler (below and Edwards 1998, 14, Sandal 2000, 18). Consequently, these objects are not included here. Thus, Viking Age amulets can be defined provisionally as miniature objects, mainly pendants of metal. This permits a reasonably precise delimitation of this assembly from the rest of archaeological material of the Viking Age. However, a few objects still constitute problematic borderline cases.\n\nTypological delimitation: amulets as miniatures and (pendant) jewellery The most obvious amulets in the Viking Age material are the Thor’s hammers, which are almost univocally associated with myths about the god Thor, as recorded in later written sources (e.g. Wamers 1994, 85). Likewise, the Christian cross must be seen as a univocally identified religious symbol. The cross became common in Scandinavia during the Viking Age. Miniature strike-a-lights, miniatures scythes and the socalled staves are occasionally found as part of sets with the Thor’s hammers. Consequently, they can be interpreted as amulets, even when they are found without Thor’s hammers. Beside these types, other types of miniature figurines are found in the archaeological material of the Viking Age. They, too, must be considered symbolic objects which referred to a larger complex of ideas. Consequently, they can be tentatively interpreted as amulets. They include inter alia human and animal figurines, miniature weapons, miniature tools and miniature chairs. All these objects are miniatures whose form imitates other objects, animals, etc. This suggests that their cultural meaning depended on a frame of reference that went beyond their practical use (cf. Derrida 1997, 204, Kaul 2004b, 65 and below). As discussed below, they can be seen as material signs. Unlike Thor’s hammers and crosses, these pieces can rarely be identified convincingly from the written sources. Their identification as amulets depends on a purely archaeological argument. Most of these miniatures are of metal.\n\nA special problem is presented by the so-called dress pins with axe-heads and cruciform heads (Schwartz-Machesen 1976, 27, Scheitzel & Crumlin-Pedersen 1985, 10; cf. Paulsen 1939, 161). These pieces are made of bone. In form, these bone miniature axes are quite like the copperalloy miniature axes from Dublin and Avnsøgård (O’Brien 1998, 211, Munksgaard 1981; cat. 262 & 93). However, the bone axes’ heads are notably smaller. The long-shafted Dublin axe (cat. 268) is often interpreted as a dress-pin, although its heavy head speaks against this. This axe is more than 10 cm long, and probably too big to wear in the same way as the other amulets. This piece is probably not quite comparable with the pendant jewellery. Consequently, neither an interpretation as amulet nor one as dress-pin is entirely satisfactory. The other miniature axes of copper-alloy have so short shafts that they cannot be interpreted as dress pins. In this work, I have chosen to treat all copper-alloy miniature axes as amulets, including the Dublin piece, and all bone miniature axes as utilitarian objects. The logic of this choice is debatable, but I must stress that there is a striking lack of definitely identified amulets of bone.\n\nMany of these objects are pendants, but this does not\n\n5\n\nViking Age A amulets inn Scandinavia a and Westernn Europe\n\nT Irish national museum holds three t such pieces,, while no similarr object is knownn Figure 1.1) Amuulet?

It is less probable that any of the objects that are included here are not amulets.\n\nLikewise, some of the figurine brooches may very well have served as amulets for some of their wearers. However, I see no way that figurine brooches worn as amulets can be separated univocally from those carried for practical reasons. If these figurine brooches were to be included in the analysis, they would weaken the central hypothesis that all amulets always were symbolic objects. For example, one figurine brooch from Tissø shows two billy-goats (Pedersen & Dreyer 2003, 24). There is no reasonable doubt that this brooch should be understood as a reference to the complex of myths surrounding Thor’s two billy-goats, described in the written sources. It is less clear if its final deposition was caused by its religious frame of reference or its function as brooch. To define a homogenous material of univocally identified amulets, I shall exclude this Tissø brooch from the amulet material. It was probably a religious symbol, but it was also something else. Similar conditions apply to the cruciform brooches, the crossornamented Terslev brooches and other similar objects. The religious symbolism need not always have been more important than the practical use (cf. Staecker 1999a, 15 and 66, Zeiten 1997, 2).\n\nThe above should hopefully define a body of material. Yet, this does not mean that the label “amulet” necessarily applies. I shall address this problem presently: A problematisation of the term “amulet” The term “amulet” is problematic for several reasons: First, “amulet” is not a concept known from Viking Age Scandinavia (emic meaning, see below). On the contrary, debatable whether Viking Age Scandinavians had any one word that covered the same content (Sandal 2000, 11). Nor does the word describe any phenomenon, archaeologists and other present-day readers can recognise from their own everyday life (“etic” similarity, see below). Second, there is no direct evidence for what functions the miniature objects had. Zeiten defines an amulet as an object worn on the person and supposed to ward off evil or bring advantages. However, this attribution relies on functions that cannot be directly observed in the\n\nThis delimitation is relatively narrow. It is possible that 7\n\nViking Age amulets in Scandinavia and Western Europe The capsules and lunulae are not proper miniatures. They do not look like anything else. One capsule, from Birka (cat. 719), carries a runic inscription that documents its protective use. Other pieces may have shared this function, although the Birka-piece is atypical (see below). However, capsules and lunulae are found strikingly often as hack-silver, unlike other amulets. Both types are mainly import. There are no certain, local products. I have included both capsules and lunulae as amulets in the present work, but this decision is debatable.\n\narchaeological material. Thus Zeiten has to spend much of her paper arguing that the objects discussed were indeed supposed to ward off evil or bring advantages (Zeiten 1997, 3 and throughout; cf. Landelius 2005, 4). Third, the term “amulet” carries unfortunate connotations of magic and religion. One of the major problems in amulet studies has been an all too ready willingness to reduce the amulets to illustrations of always already known religious myths. Little has been done to study them as archaeological objects. As an archaeologist, I am not primarily interested in the artefacts as sources for an imagined religion, but as objects in themselves.\n\nA related problem concerns the Thor’s hammer rings: these are large iron rings with various pendants, all iron. Some, but not all, such rings carry recognisable Thor’s hammers. Clearly, these are both similar to and different from the lose pendants. The other pendants include some that are broadly similar to the other types of lose amulets, notably miniature spears and axes, as well as some that are not recognisable as miniatures of anything, such as pendant rings or spirals. All this is iron, and in some cases the pieces are badly corroded and difficult to recognise.\n\nAll this suggests that “amulet” might not be the best term for the Viking Age miniature symbols, yet it is the term established in tradition and no better term springs to mind. There is a coherent body of material, and we have to refer to these pieces by some name or other. I recognise that the term “amulet” seems to foreclose problematic connections to pagan mythology, but I see no obvious alternative that solves that particular problem. Dubious amulets\n\nMoreover, the state of publication is very uneven. Most other amulets are well-published, often even with published pictures. This is not the norm for the Thor’s hammers rings, where terse verbal descriptions are more common, and many of these are open to interpretation. In many cases, these descriptions do not detail what types or pendants were present, or how many, nor is there any general agreement as to how to describe the objects: some writers distinguish between Thor’s hammers rings with and without hammers, other between Thor’s hammer rings and amulet rings, and others between amulet rings with and without Thor’s hammers. Thus, most isolated references do not make clear whether Thor’s hammers, let alone other types of pendant, were present on any given ring.\n\nThe amulets discussed below are divided into different types and materials. Some of these are more convincingly identified as amulets than are others. Special doubts concern the lead objects, the tweezer-crosses, the capsules and lunulae, and the so-called idols. The lead objects are often interpreted as positives meant for lost-mould casting. However, the anchors are known in lead, only. It seems unreasonable to assume that we have half-fabrics preserved, but no finished pieces. Rather, the lead anchors must be finished pieces in their own right. Several anchors also show defects that can be interpreted as traces of use. As discussed below, lead amulets are also known from graves where the inclusion of unfinished half-fabrics must surprise. Consequently, not all lead amulets are likely to be models. Nor is it likely to be possible to distinguish between models and finished amulets of lead on archaeological criteria. Consequently, I have included all relevant lead pieces as amulets. On the other hand, some amber pieces can be recognised as half-fabrics, discarded because they broke under the work. These, I have not included.\n\nUnfortunately, no up-to-date overview of this material exists. Most researchers seem to rely on Ambrosiani’s unpublished analyses of his own catalogue from 1954, although a more recent catalogue was collected, but neither published nor analysed, by Krister Ström sometime in the 1980s. Obviously, both these are outdated. Ideally, analyses should be based on a new catalogue, collected by someone with physical access to the relevant pieces and the time and opportunity to describe them. They should also be based on the original find reports. I have had access to neither. Instead, I have had to rely on highly imperfect publications. Working from these, I have chosen only to include those rings where I was certain that Thor’s hammers were present, and to ignore all other types of pendant, since these are very rarely explicitly mentioned in the published descriptions. I suspect that they are relatively frequent, but I have no way of judging how frequent, or where, or when.\n\nThe cross-tweezers are often interpreted as tools (see for example Bergquist 1989, 39ff). This interpretation is rejected by Staecker (1999a, 105f). He admits that the sliding ring on the cross from Verdal (cat. 308) is a practical detail. Such rings are found on tweezers used in surgery, where they allow surgeons to cramp a vein shut and keep both hands free. However, Staecker also points out that the Sædding cross (cat. 230) is closed at the bottom, and consequently cannot work as tweezers, and that the cross-shape generally serves no practical purpose. These pieces could perhaps combine practical use and symbolic character, but I accept Staecker’s theory that they are primarily symbolic.\n\nThe resulting catalogue is obviously highly imperfect. It does not contain sufficient contextual information to 8\n\n1: Background and contex allow for a discussion of whether Ambrosiani’s old observations are still tenable. It likely does not contain all Thor’s hammer rings with Thor’s hammers actually discovered. It only contains those pieces I have been able to learn of. Yet, this imperfect catalogue is, unfortunately, better than anything else available at the moment. It does allow for a general description of the type, and I think the broad tendencies identified are so strong that no amount of additional material is likely to change them much. There may well be some Thor’s hammer rings with Thor’s hammers that I am unaware of, but I would be greatly surprised if any of these were not made of iron, or if any significant numbers were found in Scandinavia outside of Uppland and Södermanland.\n\nZeiten, the “idols” can be excluded by the same logic. However, this question demands further discussion:\n\nClearly, this information is of a much lower quality than that which I have gathered for the other amulets. Arguably, it is so much poorer that it should have been left out of the work altogether. Yet, the Thor’s hammer rings are an important parallel to the lose Thor’s hammers, and no better catalogue is available, let alone published.\n\nThe amber figurine from Feddet has suspension holes at the back, something that seems inexplicable for a playing piece. Perkins also argues that amber was considered a magical or special material, but this seems unsupported (Ibid. 70; see below). However this piece is probably not just a playing piece.\n\nOf the “idols”, the one least likely to be an amulet may be Baldursheimur (Perkins 2001, 135), found with twentyfour other playing pieces. Despite Perkins’ reservations, this context would seem to indicate that it is indeed a playing piece. All other pieces are stray finds. The bone figurine from Lund seems quite similar to that from Baldursheimur. Perkins argues that written sources mention idols made of ivory (Ibid. 62f), yet this is hardly proof that all figurines made of ivory were idols. Again, the Lewis ivory chess-men indicate otherwise.\n\nPerkins (2001, throughout) has argued that the Eyrarland bronze figurine, at least, is an idol of Thor, rather than a weight or a playing piece. He stresses that Eyrarland is too heavy and unstable for a well-designed playing piece, and does not fit any known unit of weight. Perkins has tried to extend this interpretation to the Lund and Baldursheimur figurines. I am unconvinced that the Eyrarland image is really an idol of Thor. However, this is not the issue here. If Eyrarland is not a playing piece, it could well be an amulet in the sense used here, whether or not is portrays Thor.\n\nThe so-called “idols” constitute another special problem. These are human figurines interpreted as cult objects. There are other human figures that cannot be connected to religion or cult by any stretch of the imagination, such as the famous Lewis chess-men. However, the finds from Lund (Skåne, Sweden), Feddet (Præstø, Denmark), Rällinge (Södermanland, Sweden), Baldursheimur and Eyrarland (Iceland) have all been suggested as idols. The Rällinge figurine is phallic, and often described as a figurine of Frey, presumably based on Adam of Bremen’s description of the phallic idol of this god in Uppsala. The Eyrarland figure is often identified as Thor, based on claims that its beard is shaped like a Thor’s hammer. Rällinge has been described as Odin, on unclear grounds. The other figurines do not have traditional identifications. The “idols” differ from most other amulets in that they are mostly three-dimensional, meant to stand on a surface rather than be worn as pendants. However, the same is true for some of the animal figurines, which can hardly be interpreted as chess-men. As Shetelik observed, the polish on some of the latter suggests that they may have been worn in pouches, and as Perkins and Grieg note, there are written sources for “idols” being worn in that way (Grieg 1954, 181, Perkins 2001, 55).\n\nThe Rällinge bronze figurine is rather different. It does not resemble the others too closely. Although more stable than the Eyrarland image, it is unlikely to be a playing piece. Both its ithyphallicism and its tailor’s seat are quite different from anything known from more conventional chess-men. One final piece merits discussion here: the small figurine from Lindby (e.g. Perkins 2001, 101). I remain unconvinced that the slight asymmetry of its eyes can provide any strong argument for an interpretation as Odin. In any case, this piece is not a playing piece, since it cannot stand unsupported. Nor is it as obviously threedimensional as Rällinge or Eyrarland. As a small, twodimensional miniature, very possibly worn as a pendant, it fits the criteria of the other amulets included here.\n\nZeiten excluded the Feddet and Lund figurines from her catalogue of Danish amulets, arguing that they were likely playing-pieces. However, she also remarks that “This does not preclude, however, that the figures in addition to their gaming potential may have had cultic functions. They were perhaps used as little house deities or even as amulets…” (Zeiten 1997, 12). The other “idols” were found outside her geographical area of interest, and are not discussed in her work. However, similar arguments should apply. Zeiten argues, then, that these pieces may have been idols, but that they were likely also something else. This logic is similar to that which I applied to figurine brooches above. Following\n\nJust to sum up: I believe that Baldursheimur is a playing piece. Based on this, Lund also seems to be. The Feddet figurine seems to have been worn as a pendant, and the Lindby figurine may well have been. The Rällinge and Eyrland figurines are unlikely to be playing pieces, and bear comparison with some of the animal amulets. However, the Eyrland piece seems too heavy, the Lindby piece to large, to bear comparison with other amulets. In terms of analysis, the decision to include or exclude any of these pieces means very little: the overall material is so large that a few undated stray finds only contribute a 9\n\nViking Age amulets in Scandinavia and Western Europe slight statistical influence. I have decided to exclude them, given the uncertainty of their identification as amulets.\n\nOne was only published after his catalogue was completed, but the others are discussed in his section on cross-like objects.\n\nChronological delimitation\n\nI accept all these pieces as proper crosses, but the contexts cause problems: the finds from Eriksberg Slott and Karlslund were included in cremation graves. The find from Valsta originate in a grave with secondary inhumations, and the find from Pollista from settlement context. As discussed below, cremation is not necessarily incompatible with Christianity. Yet, it may be more probable that these graves contain the remains of very early Christians, buried by pagans, who did not know Christian burial tradition. I accept these three pieces as Viking Age crosses. On the other hand, there is reasonable doubt about the date of the pieces from Valsta and Pollista. They are certainly crosses, but may not be Viking Age. The Pollista cross was found on a village ground in unbroken use from late Iron Age to the 1960s, in cultural layers without any clear stratigraphy. In its proximity, another cross was found. Staecker dates that other cross to the High Middle Ages. On this basis, I suspect that the simple cross from Pollista is also High Medieval. Therefore, I do not include it in my analyses. The Valsta cross was found in the pit dug into the Valsta grave. This grave was dominated by a triple inhumation in cruciform cist. This is probably a Christian grave. Outside the grave was found a facetted quartz bead and a metal setting with a piece of cabochon rock crystal which Andersson (1998) compares with details on Christian relics from Ireland and Norway. Both bead and crystal date to the Middle Ages. They show that some finds in connection with this grave are younger than the inhumations. Thus, the Valsta cross may also be medieval. As in Jelling (cat. 226), it seems probable that the Christian graves in Valsta were emptied by later Christians. These may have wished to rebury their pioneers’ relics in another place or in another way. The cross may well have been left by these people. Then again, both the Valsta and Jelling crosses may be part of the original burial equipment. I have included both in the analysis.\n\nChronologically the Viking Age amulets constitute a somewhat homogenous group. Not all types are limited to the Viking Age, but the most typical amulets of both the (preceding) Iron Age and the (following) Middle Ages are clearly distinct from those of the Viking Age. A few types cross periods: wheels and miniature weapons seem developed already early in the Iron Age (Sanmark 2004, 161, Näsman 1973, 100). The Iron Age and Viking Age forms are not identical, and it is quite possible that they did not have the same meaning in the two periods. Also, the cross continued in use into the Middle Ages, when the Sami wheel-crosses may have continued something of the wheel amulets’ form, recontextualised as Christian symbols (S. Krogh 1969, 152, cf. I. Zachrisson 1984, 84). However, these are exceptions. Generally, there is a clear difference between amulets of the Iron Age, the Viking Age and the Middle Ages. The Iron Age material is dominated by stamped foil-work, including bracteates and “guldgubber” (picture gold foils), the medieval material by rune-amulets and organic materials. Miniature figurines are only dominant in the Viking Age. Thus, there are rather obvious differences between Viking Age amulets and earlier and later groups. Only the distinction between the Viking Age and later crosses has given earlier researchers trouble. The established use seem to be to include only well-dated pieces, and to limit these at some an arbitrary point in time (Solli 2002, 20ff, Zeiten 1997, 29). For the other amulets, the latest available date is 1020 AD, for the Johannishus hoard (cat. 365-369), and this seems as good a point of demarcation as any. Obviously, the later the date, the more crosses could be included, but including late crosses will reveal little or nothing about Viking Age amulets. As with other types, I include stray finds that have obvious typological Viking Age. Likewise, I have included those crosses found in Viking Age contexts. From Great Britain and Ireland I have only included crosses found on Scandinavian sites or with stylistic associations to Scandinavia.\n\nThe simple crosses do not fit perfectly into Staecker’s typology. They come closest to his types 1.1.1 and 1.1.2, simple cross pendants of foil and cast metal. The single piece that looks most like them in shape may be the find from Borgunda Kyrkby (cat. 1205). However, that piece is cast lead. Staecker subdivides these types further, but the general types have a broad date to the 10th and 11th century. The shape is so simple that it may very well have been reinvented at a later date. The Karlslund cross show that crosses of the same type as Valsta and the simple cross from Pollista were in use in the Viking Age, but it cannot show that the type is limited to the Viking Age. I exclude the cross from Pollista from the analysis because I suspect that it is too late.\n\nA small group of possible cross pendants deserves a special discussion. It consists of the finds from Eriksberg Slott, Turelund, Kalslund, Valsta and Pollista. The finds from Eriksberg (cat. 638) and Turelund (cat. 1006, 1007) are very alike, small crosses of copper-alloy with a central square and drawn-out corners. Duczko considers these pieces to be Byzantine in origin, while Gräslund and Floderus suggest that they can have reached Sweden through Russia (Duczko 1989b, 125, Floderus 1940, 130ff, Gräslund 1984c, 112). These two interpretations do not rule each other out. The crosses from Karlslund, Valsta and Pollista (cat. 519, 949, and not included) are simpler, made of thin, forged iron. Staecker does not include any of these pieces in his catalogue of crosses.\n\nThis discussion of chronology also demands a brief discussion of curation: the problem is a simple and universal one, that the typological and contextual dates of 10\n\n1: Background and contex England, and miniature axes in men’s graves in Russia (Pedersen 2004, 64). Despite this, these pieces were probably reinterpreted locally. The same form in another culture need not have the same meaning (cf. for instance Gosden & Knowles 2001, throughout, Roslund 2001, 79). Consequently, it makes sense to treat all Viking Age amulets from sites with Scandinavian culture as one body of material, and separate them from similar, contemporary amulets from other cultures. For the present investigation this also reflects practical considerations, notably language difficulties. I do not read Russian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithauanian, Polish or Finnish. Also, different records are shaped by their situation of registration and of research. I could not realistically attempt to understand these factors for e.g. Russia inside the time-frame of this project (cf. Sindbæk 2005, 213). For this reason, I have chosen to focus on Scandinavia and the West. I have excluded both the Eastern Baltic and the Sami material. I have done so from the assumption that Scandinavian people in England and Ireland shared much the same cultural frame of reference as their peers in Scandinavia, as evidenced in the fact that they produced the same sort of material culture and used it in the same way. The Sami did not do so. In as far as we can tell these two cultures apart, it seem entirely pointless to conflate them with each other.\n\nan object need not be the same. Sometimes, people keep and even reuse objects that are already quite old, and there is good evidence that Viking Age Scandinavians did just that. Thus, one of the graves on Birka contains a coin stuck in the 480s, but seemingly deposited there in the 800s, and the oval brooches from Skaill, Orkney were deposited as a pair, but have typological dates a lifetime apart. It is very likely that some objects with typological dates to the Viking Age were deposited after whatever chronological limit chosen, and that some objects with typological dates to the iron Age may in fact have remained in use and been deposited in the Viking Age. This problem seems inevitable if we are going to work with periods at all. The only way out would be to rely exclusively on one or the other type of dates, i.e. either on scientific dating alone, or on typology alone, both of which would severely limit the material available. If we are going to use “the Viking Age” as a meaningful, heuristic term at all, we will have to accept that this term conflates typology and absolute chronology, and that these different techniques may sometimes yield conflicting results. This problem is universal, but perhaps more acute for historical archaeology because we have so many different ways to date finds, and because dates are so precise and periods so short and precisely defined that a few dates make a great difference. One very central discussion in Viking Age studies in the past century has been whether the beginning of the period should be set to 750 AD or 793. It is very difficult to imagine similar discussions in Palaeolithic archaeology where dating uncertainties of a few centuries are common.\n\nThe present analysis is shaped by the present-day nationstates’ and administrative regions’ practice of registration. The relevant material is documented by different institutions. In connection with the work I have visited the Danish National Museum, ATA and Statens Historiska Museet, Universitetets Oldsaksamling, British Museum, Museum of London, Norwich Castle Museum, the Yorkshire Museum, Leicester Museum, Saffron Walden Museum, the Irish National Museum, the Scottish National Museum and Sloß Gottorf. I have also been in contact with the museums in Bergen, Trondheim, Stavanger and Tromsø. Today, each of these institutions works inside modern national or regional borders, and their collections and registers are shaped by these modern state’s and region’s legislation. Although Hedeby was not “in Germany” in the Viking Age, the site and the finds from Hedeby are in Germany today. Our knowledge about Hedeby is to a large degree shaped by special German history and Bodendenkmalpflege-gesetze (laws on the preservation and care of scheduled monuments). Consequently, it is logical to work with these modern borders for practical reasons, even though they did not exist in the Viking Age. There was no German Federal Republic when Hedeby was inhabited, but there has been one during much the excavations.\n\nIn this regard, I must also briefly address the question of site-continuity: the central places of Helgö, Tissö and Uppåkra certainly continued in use from the Iron Age to the Viking Age. On other Iron Age special places, the evidence for continuity is more ambiguous, but continuity is certainly a possibility. Indeed, at Lunda, Södermanland, the Iron Age deposits and offerings may still have been visible and exposed in the Viking Age. Likewise, some Viking Age sites continued in use into the middle ages, such as Jelling. Again, it could be argued that it makes no sense to isolate the Viking Age from earlier and later periods. Again, I think doing so is necessary, if we are to work with periods at all. We can distinguish between the Iron Age and the Viking Age activities on these sites, and Viking Age Scandinavians did not use them in the same way as their predecessors or successors did. If we are to understand the past at all, we must be able to study aspects of it, such as specific areas, types or periods, without having to include everything else all the time. The changes in how these sites were used are at least as interesting as the continuities.\n\n1.4) A preliminary description of the body of Viking Age amulets\n\nGeographical and cultural delimitation\n\nFollowing the definitions above, an assembly of amulets can be isolated. These are described in details in the catalogue. Almost 1350 securely identified Viking Age amulets are known from nearly 700 sites. Most of these amulets are of silver or iron, most are from Uppland, the\n\nThe geographical delimitation of the material is not as clear as the chronological one. For instance, shield amulets are found among non-Scandinavian cultures in the Baltic (Skovmand 1942, 253), snake amulets occur in 11\n\nViking Age amulets in Scandinavia and Western Europe can also be found in the catalogue.\n\nrest of Sweden or Denmark. The most common types are Thor’s hammers and crosses. Most amulets are found in graves, secondarily hoards.\n\nI have followed Fuglesang & Wilson (2006) and systematically used the place-name “Hoen”, rather than the alternative “Hon”. I have referred to “Hedeby” rather than “Haithabu”, and respected the conventions of Swedish archaeology that names the site on Lillön as “Helgö” and that on Björkö as “Birka”. For other placenames, I refer to the catalogue. As per convention, all graves on Birka are referred to with Bj.-numbers, for example Bj. 750 = Birka grave 750. These graves are published in Arbman 1943.\n\nThere are striking chronological tendencies in the history of recovery: the early material is dominated by stray finds and finds with unclear information. A bit later, hoard finds became the dominant group, then grave finds, and today strikingly many new finds originate on settlements and as stray finds, now especially metal detector finds. Although grave finds still constitute almost half of the known material, this is more due to the history of registration than to what existed in the past. It is to be expected that the relationship between types of context will change in the future, also (graphs for distribution on materials, context-types and types can be found in later chapters).\n\nAll quotes are translated to English. The originals can be found in the notes. Ellipsis (“…”) marks my shortenings and selections. As far as possible, I have given mythological names in their normalised English form rather than in the Old Norse original (i.e. “Odin” rather than Othinn or Oðinn). Where accepted English forms exist, I see no profit in insisting on exotic spellings. However, I have maintained the Scandinavian spellings “Skåne” and “Fyn” for “Scania” and “Funen”. I understand that these have wide currency in the English-speaking world.\n\n1.5) Some conventions Much of the material discussed in this work has a long history of research, and parts of it have been published under several different names. The graves in Hedeby and on Stora & Lilla Ihre on Gotland have been given new numbers after the first excavations. I use the new numbers, and indicate the old numbers in brackets. These\n\n12\n\n2: Theory\n\nPart 2: Theory In this section, I shall introduce some fundamental concepts. The chapter is divided into in four parts: a discussion of semiotics and of symbols as a phenomenon, and of how the amulets’ materiality challenges such abstract theories; a discussion of, how the archaeological archive is formed; a discussion of John Moreland’s theories about similarity, difference and analogy; and a discussion of how these challenge the established image of the Viking Age and can be used to form a better understanding of the Viking Age world of thought.\n\nsituations are more symbolic than others. One way to treat this complexity is through structural semiotics. Originally, this discipline focused on spoken and written language. Here, Ferdinand de Saussure emphasized how signs (words) are structured through binary opposition and are arbitrary. That is, signs work because they can be clearly separated from other signs, not because they look or sound like their meaning (Derrida 1997, 44). The classical example is that of the words “dog” and “chien” (“dog” in French). Neither conveys any meaningful information about these animals, their bark, smell, wagging tails, ability to herd sheep or fetch slippers. Yet, both words work within their respective languages. They are arbitrary, looking and sounding nothing like dogs, yet they are adequate placeholders because they cannot be mistaken for most other words they might co-occur with. In everyday use, “dog” may be contrasted to “cat” or “wolf” or “person” all of them equally arbitrary and equally adequate. For purposes of communication, it is highly useful that the words “dog” and “wolf” are less similar than the animals might be.\n\nI shall take my starting point in Jacques Derrida’s interpretation of Ferdinand de Saussure’s semiotics. This can probably not be separated from Derrida’s other philosophy. As Brit Solli has suggested, it is a mistake to treat philosophy as a “super-market of thought with free choice on all shelves” 1 (Solli 1992, 19). A philosophical approach is a coherent system, and ought to be understood in context. I find many archaeologists too uncritical in their borrowings of key concepts from different, often disagreeing, thinkers. If the theoretical starting points are incompatible, the conclusions must also be incompatible. I believe that archaeology would gain much by a more critical reflection over where our theoretical concepts come from, and what they mean in their original context. I have consequently sought to write a text with coherent theory, source-criticism and epistemology. Here, I have drawn on the larger postmodernist critical project that Derrida’s works are part of, and especially on Donna Haraway, whose ideas fit surprisingly well with Derrida’s (see Haraway & Goodeve 2000, 21, Haraway 2008, 292ff, and more generally Law 2000, 163).\n\nTo take another example, a standing man’s silhouette means one thing on a toilet door, another in a traffic light. On the toilet door, (standing) man is opposed to (standing) woman and sometimes to wheel-chair user, indicating that the differentiation is between men and women, and sometimes wheelchair users. In traffic, standing (man) is opposed to walking (man), suggesting that here, the man is a mere placeholder for “pedestrian”, and the differentiation is between standing and walking. The sign excludes women from the toilet, but includes pedestrian women in traffic. Pedestrian women effortlessly make the transition between being and not being “standing men” in different contexts. Not incidentally, these signs are as arbitrary as the word “dog”: as Irish pubs show, it makes just as much sense to label the doors “fir” and “mna”, if everyone speaks the language.\n\nHere, I shall not attempt to locate this theoretical approach in larger context. Such an explanation would either demand unreasonable simplifications, extensive explanations or jargonistic references. Experience suggests that few Scandinavian archaeologists have any patience with that sort of theoretical discussion. Although I do not have the opportunity to account for it here, I shall still stress that there is a logical coherence between the post-structuralist semiotics and the source-critical considerations.\n\nEven on toilet doors, the signs “men” and “women” can be modified by the sign “wheel-chair users”. This is probably not meant to deny wheelchair users the status of men and women, but rather to recognise that some men and women may have special needs. Thus, what a signs means depends on which other signs are in play. A wheel-chair user may select to be a “woman” or even a “woman wheel-chair user”, given the choice, but she will have to choose from the doors available.\n\n2.1) A theoretical approach to symbolism: poststructuralist semiotics I suggest that the amulets can be understood as symbolic objects. This demands a discussion of what symbols are. Under the right circumstances, anything can be used as symbol. However, although anything can be used as a symbol, this does not mean that anything and everything is always equally symbolic. As Freud likely never said, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Some objects and some\n\nThe signs’ arbitrary and provisional nature was further emphasised by Jacques Derrida. He suggested that all symbols got their meaning through definition up against other symbols which got their meaning through definition up against other symbols etc. to infinity. This, he called “endless deferral” (Derrida 1997, 101; 2005, 160, 263 & 347; B. Olsen 1990, 168ff, Yates 1990, 114; cf. Spivak\n\n1 ”Franske filosofer og litteraturvitere kan fungere som et tenkningens supermarked, men da må vi velge råvarer med tanke på hvilken rett som skal tilberedes. Labskaus står neppe høyt i kurs hverken hos franske tenkere eller gastronomer.”\n\n13\n\nViking Age amulets in Scandinavia and Western Europe dominant. Thus, symbols’ meaning cannot be reduced to their origins. Symbols change meaning when the context changes. Thus, an explanation of the causes of the differences in amulets cannot explain what consequences the same differences had. Although the Thor’s hammer did not arise as a reaction against the cross, it may later have been used as such. Its symbolism in a concrete context cannot be reduced to its origins.\n\n1997, lvii, Sinclair 2000, 476). The point is that meaning must always be temporary, subjective, contextual and open to challenges and changes. In every concrete situation, the symbol’s meaning depends the concrete situation, not on anything essential in the symbol. Ideas about ideal, totalising structures must be rejected (Bass 2005, xviii, Yates 1990, 209). It is not really possible to describe all of the sign’s potential contents, because the sign’s meaning always relates to other symbols, which again relate to still others. In the final analysis, the sign can relate to all other possible signs. On the other hand, its meaning is not completely free, exactly because it always relates to other signs (cf. D. Whitley 1998, 18). The signs are consequently provisional, in it sense that their meaning is conditional and contextual, dependent on it concrete situation. They do not have one universal meaning, independent of the moment, but they can attain a number of concrete meanings in the concrete situation (cf. also Haraway 1991, 198, Persch 2005, 25).\n\nSymbolic objects, symbolic actions Unlike Sassure’s linguistic semiotics, archaeology does not deal with abstract signs. The archaeological primary material consists of physical objects and the use of these as symbols contain special aspects, which do not occur in the case of the linguistic signs. Most symbolic objects must be understood as provisional non-discursive symbols (B. Olsen 1997, 180ff, Shanks & Hodder 1995, 17). A large part of their social value lies in the fact that their role as symbols is ambiguous. Although they can be used as symbols, they are never only symbols (Hays 1993, 82). Sometimes, a cigar is just a cigar. Even when it is also a symbol, it is still a cigar. Because of this, an actual cigar may be more socially acceptable than the claim it stands for. It is more difficult to argue against the implicit, ambiguous symbolism in a cigar than against an unambiguous, spoken claim. The objects’ symbolic potential can be strengthened, be weakened or be denied by different persons in different situations. Thus, the same objects can be used as symbols in some situations, and serve purely practical purposes in others. Indeed, a material sign can work well on a practical level, without communication. As Alison Wylie points out, a uniform coat only works as sign of its wearer’s rank if it is recognised, but it can keep her warm, even if no-one sees it (Wylie 2002, 128).\n\nThus, the meaning of “dog” is also contextual. To be sure, Fido may be a dog any way you look at him, but plenty of other dogs are more metaphorical. A statue may be a “dog” (statue), as opposed to, say, being a “human being” (statue), and a stuffed toy may be “a dog” (toy) as opposed to a teddy-bear (toy). For that matter, bones found on an archaeological excavation may be “a dog” (skeleton) in the context of conversation. Likewise, you may label a person “a dog”, in offence. Each of these claims to dog-ness is meaningful, yet problematic, and anyone assuming that Greyfair’s Bobby, the dogs playing poker, you landlord or the contents of box 414B are real (living, breathing) dogs is likely to misunderstand the situation entirely. It we look at physical objects as symbols, these semiotics mean that the objects do not lie about “meaning” anything in themselves. They only get meaning in concrete situations. Taking a modern example familiar to archaeologists, a live candle means altogether different things in a church, during a power failure, and on a dinner table (Deetz 1977, 51, cf. for instance Collins & Mayblin 2000, 29, B. Olsen 1997, 174ff, B. Turner 1994, 91f, Hodder 1982, 10, Vandkilde 2000, 14, Barthes 1969, 148). The candle does not mean any one thing when you buy it, it only gets meaning when used. More relevantly, Viking Age amulets need not mean the same in graves and hoards, although the amulets themselves are identical (cf. V. Turner 1965 throughout, Persch 2005, 32; cf. Derrida 1997, 39ff and note 1:2:38, p. 329; Ricoeur 2003, 144).\n\nI shall suggest that amulets, specifically, were less flexible symbols than many other objects. Although their precise meaning could likely be negotiated by both sender and receiver, their role as symbols for something could not be doubted. Viking Age amulets were not just symbols. They were and remain physical objects, and the present find-picture is partly shaped by their materiality as physical objects (cf. Hodder 1982, 9; Dugdale 2005, 199ff.). Like any other archaeological material, the amulets are subject to post-depositional factors. These include systematic differences in preservation and reporting of different types of finds. I shall address post-depositional factors presently, and discuss reporting below.\n\nOn the other hand, it is probable that identical amulets in comparable contexts will have related meanings. Derrida’s theory also means that the amulets’ meaning at any given time depended on which other amulets were in use at the same time. Consequently, the meaning of the amulets can change over time, although the amulets themselves retain the same shape. As discussed below, the Thor’s hammer was probably not an emblem for nonChristian identity in the earliest Viking Age, but it can have attained this meaning after the cross became more\n\nBradley remarks that the archaeological remains often throw most light on two points in the object’s use-life: production and deposition (Bradley 1990, 32). However, objects may have a long biography between these to points, difficult as it is to reconstruct archaeologically. It is also obvious that some objects were lost to archaeology along the way: not all the objects that were 14\n\n2: Theory\n\nFigure 2.1 ) Summary of objects’ use-lives.\n\nproduced were ever part of a larger set such as a hoard; not all objects or sets were deposited in archaeological context; not all deposited objects are preserved today; and not all surviving objects have been found.\n\ncontracting rituals change the participants’ legal and social duties, independently of any supernatural frame of reference. This type of rituals include for example weddings, peace settlements and legal judgments, all of which should ideally be witnessed by local society, typically at the public assembly (thing; Habbe 2005 & 2006 throughout, cf. Moreland 2001, 57).\n\nThe objects’ use-life can be summarized as in figure 2.1. So far, I have discussed the objects in themselves. However, the focus for the present study is the objects in context. This context consisted of actions, and in many cases these actions can be described as rituals.\n\nOnce a ritual had taken place, material traces seem to have played an active role in showing what had happened: ibn Fadlan remarks that the visible consumption at the Volga burial was marked for posterity with of a mound and a monument with runes. This is entirely in keeping with the archaeological sources. Likewise, Thietmar of Merseburg mentions how Odin’s victims in Lejre hung from the trees until the flesh fell from the bones. At-Tartushi describes how the sacrificial animals were hung up outside the houses in Hedeby (or possibly Wolin cf. Hægstad 1964). All these elements must have served as visible reminders or traces of the rituals. The social context consisted not only of the act itself, but also included its traces. Even those who had not witnessed the ritual could witness the physical evidence left by it.\n\nA ritual is not necessarily a religious act. There are civil, bureaucratic and military rituals, wherein religion plays a small or no role. Archaeologically, it seems more reasonable to understand the ritual as a concrete act, rather than to enforce some absolute divide between religious and other rituals. The written sources suggest that many Viking Age rituals took place in public. Indeed, one of the rituals’ important social functions seems to have been communication. Viking Age and medieval culture was an oral culture. Common knowledge became common because there were witnesses to events. Many social relations were established or changed through ritualised social theatre that took place in special, public fora. Peter Habbe has described what he calls Viking Age “contracting rituals”, 2 where the ritual established a social contract. These\n\nThe same is true today: the legal value of a public wedding is independent of whether you do or do not recognise the religious authority invoked. You do not need to be a Hindu to accept that a Hindu couple may be married to each other. As in the past, so today the wedding ring is still widely accepted as evidence of\n\n2 ”Kontrakterande ritualer.”\n\n15\n\nViking Age amulets in Scandinavia and Western Europe reconstruct the Viking Age religion or imaginary in its totality. My goal is to understand a definite archaeological material, the amulets. In this connection, it makes more sense to focus on concrete actions, “rituals”, than on theories about abstract ideas and structures, “religion”.\n\nmarriage in many informal situations. We combine public ritual, material evidence and legal paperwork to change the relationship between people, and we can do so without any meaningful divide between religion and anything else. “Ritual” without “religion”\n\nA methodological approach to archaeology as a source for religion\n\nThe established, archaeological discourse about the amulets is dominated by references to “religion”. This may be misleading. This idea of religion, as a distinct phenomenon separate from the rest of life, was probably unknown to the Viking Age people. Moreover, “religion” is often equated with “faith”. This builds on a very peculiar protestant evaluation of which parts of religion are central. The idea that religion should only be about faith, as opposed to also being about deeds, was one of the great issues of the reformation. Both written sources and modern parallels outside protestant Christianity show that religion may just as often be a practice. In many cases, religion influences what people eat, and when, whom they sleep with, and when, how they do and do not make money, and many other issues far removed from the pure abstraction of faith. If the religious image of the world was the frame of reference for all activities, the divide between religious and secular makes no sense (cf. for instance V. Turner 1986, 25; Russell 1994, 155, cf. K. Thomas 1971, 165, Barthes 1999, 74ff, Bredalsmo 1992, 134, Insoll 2004, 14f & 78, Jennbert, Andrén & Raudvere 2002, 9, J. Levy 1982, 6, R. Levy 2001, 156, J. Lund 2003, 86ff, Näsström 2002, 285, B. Turner 1994, 54ff, Clunies Ross 1994, 12f, Bowie 2006, 22, Stutz 2004, 85). Also, archaeologically, it is very difficult to study “religion” as “faith”. The archaeological traces are left by physical actions, and it is far easier to reconstruct these as actions than to throw light on what participants believed. A somewhat different discursive tradition focuses on “cosmology”. This approach has been especially popular in anthropology and history of religions. The word “cosmology” is taken from Greek and corresponds more or less to “world order”. The implication is an idea that religion primarily concerns spatial relations, and keeping different worlds in order. This is also problematic: religions can rarely be reduced to cosmologies. Although many religions have cosmologies, cosmology is far from always religions’ most central element. On the contrary, organisations like Oxfam or its Danish counterpart, Folkekirkens Nødhjælp, build on a Christian basis, but prioritise pure water and warm food over cosmology’s unworldly systems of heavens and hells, or its occult hierarchies of angles and demons. These people are religious, but rarely cosmological. They may be devout, but their actions seem more important than their abstract beliefs.\n\nAs already indicated, this is an archaeological work. I have emphasised archaeological sources and discussions. Many other disciplines are involved in the discussion of Viking Age society and religion, but I am not qualified to discuss their findings. I understand that the methodological disagreements and discussions in these other disciplines are so large and so complicated that they deserve to be treated for themselves by professionals. Nor am I impressed with other archaeologist’s attempt to work interdisciplinarily. Archaeological methods are largely unsuited to evaluate the claims of history or history of religions. An archaeological work must convince through its use of archaeological data and methods. It cannot do so by drawing on other sources that cannot be evaluated through archaeological methodology. If religion is defined as faith, archaeology’s chances of throwing light on it are poor. They are significantly better if religion is defined as practice. Practice leaves archaeological traces. Thus, for archaeologists it may be useful to define the study of religion as research into ritual practice, more than as research into religious ideas. This definition is strategic: it does not describe what religion is “in reality”, but what religion is for the purposes of an archaeological investigation. Consequently, in this work, I regard religion as a concrete human behaviour in the physical world. I am uninterested in discussions of transcendent ideals, be they shamanist, structuralist, psychological or Indo-European. I am equally uninterested in deeper structures or remains of an original form that made sense once upon a time. I suggest that religious behaviour makes subjective sense for those who perform when it takes place. Similarly, I do not see religion an a priori faith that expresses itself in later behaviour. On the contrary, I see a behaviour that may possibly be explained with reference to faith, but rarely or never builds on this alone. Ritual and practice are primarily ways to live in the real, physical world. Religious people are not passive robots who unconsciously reproduce an unchanging structure dictated to them by myths and passages of scripture. They are active historical persons who react to concrete situations in the world. When the world changes, the religious adapt. These historically specific adaptations are what is visible archaeologically, not any unchanging myths and ideas.\n\nI do not find “religion” an especially productive frame of reference for understanding of the amulets. “Religion” carries all too many connotations of “faith” and “cosmology” that are probably not relevant for an archaeological investigation. It seem more productive, to see the amulets as ritual objects, without trying to tie this ritual closely to the religious. My goal is not to\n\nSummary: amulets as source for the Viking Age world of ideas Amulets can be understood as material symbols. They 16\n\n2: Theory institutions such as museums and royal antiquaries or national heritage boards have had great impact on our image of the past.\n\ncan be understood as a source for those practical, ritual actions that constituted an important a part of the period’s world of ideas. Because the amulet material is local and dateable, it can be used to challenge the hegemonic homogeneity in the text-based tradition (below). Amulet studies cannot replace text studies. However, the amulet material is a source for the Viking Age rituals and symbolism that can be studied independently of the written sources. An analysis of regional and chronological variations in amulet deposition can throw light on regional and chronological variations in ritual, world-view and possibly religion. These analyses constitute the investigation’s empirical part. However, before I get to that, it is necessary to discuss epistemology, the question of how knowledge in generated.\n\nHere, I shall use the term archive for the total, archaeological knowledge that is collected at these institutions. This archive is not identical with the archaeological discourse, which is far less factual and far more thematic (see below). I stress that archaeology’s archive is a product of a specific practice of registration. Consequently, it is both a social construction and real, but incomplete. Earlier archaeologists have probably not documented anything (much) that did not exist, but nor have they recorded all information about all that existed. Their understanding of what counted as relevant archaeological data existed in a social context, just as our own does. Thus, the archive is both a construction and a source for describing reality. It becomes no less real by being collected by people, but use of the archive demands a source-critical understanding of how and why it was collected. Specifically, the institutionalisation of the archaeological archive needs to be recognised as part of the bourgeois Enlightenment. This ideology emphasised centralised, rational state institutions empowered by law to act in perceived public interest. The empowerment of archaeological institutions also disempowered local populations. A new ideological narrative about the shared national past was instrumental in making these shifts in power acceptable. As discussed below, early interpretations of specific finds directly reflect these new ideas about local populations as part of a greater national community, united by its shared past. As Svanberg (2003a) has recently stressed, Scandinavian Viking Age archaeology was nationalist from its inception. Yet, I find he fails to stress that such nationalism was not an accident or mis-development, but a fundamental trait of the national institutio"
