        "text": "Sigrid Undset (1882-1949) is one of the three Norwegian authors (and so far the most recent one) to have received the Nobel Prize for Literature. The others are Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, the national bard, in 1903, and Knut Hamsun in 1920. Undset received the Prize in 1928, for her powerful description of life during the Middle Ages in Scandinavia, as the Nobel Literary Committee in Sweden put it at the time. They were speaking about her two extensive serial novels set against the background of medieval Norway in the 13th century, the 3-volume Kristin Lavransdatter, and the 4-volume Olav Audunssønn.\n\nBy GIDSKE ANDERSON\n\nBoth these novels about the Middle Ages, in particular \"Kristin Lavransdatter\", became international best-sellers at the time. According to Alfred Nobel's will, the Literature Prize is to be awarded to the author who has written \"the most outstanding work of an idealistic tendency\", and so Undset's books fell within this somewhat elastic category. But it was Sigrid Undset's talent as a great story-teller rather than the idealistic tendency which fascinated her readers all over the world. Her books had been translated into the most important foreign languages even before she received the Nobel Prize. After 1928, they were published in virtually every major language. Now, after a lapse of 70 years, her books are still being read worldwide, by new generations of readers.\n\nOutside Norway, her reputation has been mostly confined to \"Kristin Lavransdatter.\" Not so in Norway. I noticed this in connection with my biography of Sigrid Undset, published in 1989. I have received letters from women and men, old and young, from every part of Norway, showing that she is being read, by an increasing number of people -- in this age of television.\n\nUndset's books are being read, and not only the novels about the Middle Ages. She wrote 36 books, the mediaeval novels being one part. Another part are her contemporary novels of Kristiania (now Oslo) and Oslo between the turn of the century and the 1930s, the third part being literary essays and historical articles. Her authorship is wide-ranging and of considerable substance. And, quite obviously, a new generation of readers in Norway has discovered this.\n\nNone of Sigrid Undset's books leaves the reader unconcerned. She is a great story-teller, with a profound and realistic knowledge of the labyrinths of the human mind - at all times and in all places. With her literary and historical expertise, acquired first-hand, her thorough knowledge of nature and her understanding of its significance for all of us, Sigrid Undset has enormous riches, emotional and intellectual, to draw on.\n\nWho was Sigrid Undset? It might be worth mentioning that Sigrid Undset was born the same year as Virginia Woolf and James Joyce, three years before D.H. Lawrence and Karen Blixen. From the literary point of view, none of these were of importance to her personally, except D.H. Lawrence, whose work greatly interested her in the 1930s. But they all belong to the same generation; they are contemporaries, each one in his/her own corner of Europe. Their respective author-ships did indeed develop along very different lines, but they do have one thing in common: they are the children of a Europe in crisis, and they are very conscious of it.\n\nSigrid Undset's themes are clearly Norwegian, but equally clearly European too, in the same way that James Joyce's themes are intensely and exclusively Irish.\n\nIn Undset's case, this has to do with her adolescence. The environment she grew up in was a European environ-ment in Norway, in Scandinavia. Her father, Ingvald Undset, was an internationally respected archaeologist, whose special subject was the Iron Age in Europe, with Norse and European pre-history as supplementary fields. He pursued his profession through extensive travel and archae-ological research all over Europe. Her mother, Charlotte Undset, was Danish. She was deeply involved in her husband's work, spoke German and French, and was very well versed in Norse and European culture.\n\nSigrid Undset was born on May 20, 1882, at Kalundborg, in Denmark, at her mother's handsome childhood home on the market place of the small town. Sigrid was the eldest of the couple's three daughters. She came to Norway at the age of two, when her parents moved on account of her father's illness, which forced him to give up further scientific travel in Europe.\n\nShe grew up in Kristiania, the capital (the name was changed back to Oslo in 1925). The first 11 years of her life were strongly influenced by her father's serious illness but also by his extensive historical knowledge. At an early age, Sigrid learnt not only the secrets of archaeology, but also the mysteries of the Norse sagas and Scandinavian folk songs.\n\nHer father died, only 40 years old, when she was 11. Her mother was left to cope single-handedly with three young daughters, on very slim means. This family tragedy left its mark on Sigrid Undset's childhood and adolescence. Her hopes of a university education had to be abandoned. Having passed the intermediate school (Middelskole) examination, she took a 1-year secretarial course, and, at the age of 16, got a job as secretary with a major German-owned engineering company in Kristiania. Did she have a talent for that? That was hardly the point; it was necessary for her to earn money to help her mother and her two younger sisters. She worked with the same company for 10 years as a secretary, gradually assuming a highly trusted position. There were times when she detested office work, feeling she was wasting her time and her youth. But it gave her insight into a major industrial enterprise, taught her how to work systematically, and made her into an expert typist. She later exhibited a considerable talent for organization, both as housewife and subsequently as chairman of the Society of Norwegian Authors. Furthermore, systematic office routine undoubtedly taught her a good deal about how to proceed with major literary works such as her serial novels.\n\nBut the ten years of office work were a torment to Sigrid Undset. Late at night, and during weekends and holidays, she stole the time to write. Sigrid was no more than 16 years old when she made her first hesitant attempt at writing a novel set in the Nordic Middle Ages. For several years, she wrestled with the subject. At the same time, she read a lot, acquiring a thorough knowledge of Nordic as well as foreign literature, English in particular.\n\nShe was deeply moved by Shake-speare, enthusiastic about Chaucer, attracted by legends of King Arthur. But she also immersed herself in the work of Scandinavian writers, such as Ibsen, Strindberg, Brandes, and English authors such as the Brontë sisters and Jane Austen. On her own initiative and in her spare time she thus acquired a sound knowledge of the art of writing, preparing herself for what she felt from an early age to be her \"fate\" in life.\n\nThe manuscript of Undset's first novel was ready by the time she was 22. It was the result of burning the midnight oil for many years. It was an historical novel set in the Denmark of the Middle Ages, clearly of the rather romantic type. The manuscript was turned down by the publishing house, and to her this was a devastat-ing blow. All the same, two years later, she had completed another manuscript; much less voluminous this time, only 80 pages. She had put aside the Middle Ages, and had instead produced a realistic description of a woman with a petit-bourgeois background in contemporary Kristiania. The title was Fru Marta Aulie, with an opening sentence which scandalized the readers: I have been unfaithful to my husband. These were the words of the book's main character. This book was also refused at first, but after the intervention of a well-known writer of the time, it was subsequently accepted.\n\nThus, at the age of 25, Sigrid Undset made her literary debut with a short, realistic novel on adultery, set against a contemporary background. It created a stir, and she found herself ranked as a promising young author in Norway. During the years up to 1919, Undset published a number of novels set in contemporary Kristiania. The 10 years at the office had been lonely and difficult ones, but they had given her a foothold in the world of unimportant, everyday people; those who bravely, if not necessarily heroically, strove to find some happiness in life. Undset was a shy, rather introvert young woman with few personal friends. But she had unusually sharp eyes, she saw people, and she saw through them. Her way of breaking out of her loneliness was to take long strolls in and around Kristiania, both east and west, and she came to know it better than most. Her contemporary novels of the period 1907-1918 include all this -- the city and its insignificant inhab-itants, the monotonous boarding-house existence of secretaries in a gloomy town, their longing for a little warmth and love, and their brave, not to say heroic, rejection of seediness. These are the stories of working people, of trivial family destinies, of the relationship between parents and children, written with warmth, but soberly, and completely unsentimentally. Her main subjects are women and their love. Or, as she herself put it -- in her typically curt and ironic manner -- \"the immoral kind\" (of love).\n\nThis realistic period culminated in the novels \"Jenny\" in 1911 and \"Vaaren\" (Spring) in 1914. The first is about a woman painter who, as a result of romantic crises, believes that she is wasting her life, and in the end commits suicide. The other tells of a woman who succeeds in saving both herself and her love from a serious matrimonial crisis, finally creating a secure family. These books placed Undset more or less clearly apart from the incipient women's emancipation movement in Europe -- perhaps not exactly against it, but on an entirely different level.\n\nUndset's books sold well from the start, and after the publication of her third book, she quit the office job, and prepared to live on her income as a writer. Having been granted a writer's scholarship, she set out on a lengthy journey in Europe. After short stops in Denmark and Germany, she continued to Italy, arriving in Rome in December 1909, where she remained for nine months.\n\nUndset's parents had had a close relationship with Rome. As a matter of fact, Sigrid should have been born in Rome while her parents lived there in 1882. But just before her birth, her father became suddenly and seriously ill, her parents travelled north in a great hurry to her mother's home at Kalundborg, and that is where Sigrid was born. However, Undset herself very likely felt that her proper place of birth was Rome, and during her stay there in 1909 she followed in her parents' footsteps.\n\nThe encounter with Southern Europe meant a great deal to her. She immediately made friends within the circle of Scandinavian artists and writers in Rome, she became more open, and more outgoing and lively in her relations with other people.\n\nIn Rome, she met Anders Castus Svarstad, a Norwegian painter, whom she married two or three years later. She was then 30 and, most likely, he was her first love. Svarstad was nine years older than her, he was married, and had a wife and three children in Norway. Their meeting must have been a case of love at first sight, but it was nearly three years before Svarstad got his divorce.\n\nThey were married in 1912, and went to stay in London for 6 months. Svarstad painted, and Undset developed strong ties with English art and letters, which were to be of decisive importance to her for the rest of her life. From London, they returned to Rome, where Sigrid's first child was born in January 1913. It was a boy, and he was named after his father.\n\nMarriage and the other children who came later, meant a great deal to Sigrid Undset, both as a person and as a woman. But it was a serious dilemma for the creative artist. In the years of marriage up to 1919, she had three children of her own, and a large, busy household to look after; one which also included Svarstad's three children by his first marriage. They were difficult years for Sigrid Undset. Her second child, a girl, was retarded, and Svarstad's retarded son also lived with them. She kept an open and busy house for the large family and for old and new friends.\n\nAt the same time, she continued writing at night, after the others had gone to bed, finishing her last realistic novels and collections of short stories. She also entered the public debate on the most topical themes: women's emancipation, ethical and moral issues. She had considerable polemical gifts, and was categorically critical of emancipation as it was developing, and of the moral and ethical decline she felt was threatening in the wake of the First World War, which was raging beyond the shores of neutral Norway.\n\nIn 1919, she moved to Lillehammer, a small town in the Gudbrandsdalen, a valley in south-east Norway, taking her two children with her. She was expecting her third child. The idea was that she should take a rest at Lillehammer and move back to Kristiania as soon as Svarstad had their new house in order. However, it was not to be.\n\nInstead, the marriage broke down. In August 1919, Sigrid Undset gave birth to her third child, at Lillehammer. She decided to make Lillehammer her home, and within two years, Bjerkebæk, her large, beautiful house was completed. It was a property consisting of three large, handsome houses of traditional Norwegian timber architec-ture, and a big, fenced garden with lovely views of the town and the villages around. Her ailing daughter and the two boys now had a secure and exceptionally beautiful home. At last, after years of moves and changes, Sigrid Undset, the writer, had a quiet place to which she could retreat from the world at large in order to do the one thing she now knew she was really good at: writing.\n\nMarriage and the First World War were to change Undset's atti-tudes. During those difficult years she had experienced a crisis of faith, almost imperceptible at first, then increasingly strong. The crisis led her from clear agnostic skepticism, by way of painful uneasiness about the ethical decline of the time, towards Christi-anity. She had grown up in a tolerant, free-thinking home, and had herself been a skeptical free-thinker, though without the blind faith of the time in science and materialism being the be-all and end-all.\n\nIt would appear that Sigrid Undset had had a personal religious experi-ence at one time or another during those years. In all her writing one senses an observant eye for the mystery of life, for that which cannot be explained either by reason or common sense. At the back of her sober, almost brutal realism, there is always an inkling of something unanswerable. It would seem that this recognition of mystery resulted in a personal religious experience. At any rate, this crisis changed her view of Christianity. She no longer believed that man had created God, but had come to believe that God created man.\n\nIt was not the Lutheran Church, the Protestant State Church of Norway, where she herself had been christened, that became her choice. She joined the Roman Catholic Church in November 1924, having received thorough instruction from the local Catholic priest in her home district. She was 42 years old at the time.\n\nIn Norway Sigrid Undset's conversion to Catholicism was not only considered sensational; it also had an air of scandal about it. It was also noted abroad, where her name was becoming known through the international success of \"Kristin Lavransdatter.\" Today, we can only smile at that sensation. But at that time there were practically no Catholics in Norway, an almost obsessively Protestant country. \"Papism\" was held in contempt, even feared by large sections of the community, and not only by the Church, but actually just as much by free-thinkers, and among those more or less closely connected with Marxism, Leninism, and socialism. The attacks were quite vicious at times, with the result that Sigrid Undset's polemical gifts were aroused. For many years she participated in the public debate, in fact going out of her way to join in it, in almost total defense of her Roman Church.\n\nHowever, it is not, after all, the Mistress of Bjerkebæk or the Catholic lady who interest us most when it comes to Sigrid Undset, it is Sigrud Undset the writer, and this is a productive period for her.\n\nAs soon as her third child had been born, and she had a secure roof over her head, she started on \"Kristin Lavransdatter,\" a major project indeed. She was completely at home in the subject matter, having written a short novel at an earlier stage, about a period in Norwegian history closer to the pagan times. She had also pub-lished a version in Norwegian of the Arthurian legends, from the British/Celtic Middle Ages. She had studied Norse manuscripts and medieval texts, and had closely investigated medieval churches and monasteries, both at home and abroad. She was now an authority on the period she was struggling to portray, and a very different person from the 22-year old, who had written her first novel on the Middle Ages.\n\nWhat had happened to her in the meantime has to do with more than history and literature, it has just as much to do with her development as a person. She had experienced love, and passion, to the bitter end. She had been in despair over a sick world in the throes of the bloodbath of the First World War. When she started on \"Kristin Lavransdatter\" in 1919, she knew what life was about.\n\n\"Kristin Lavransdatter\" is, of course, an historical novel. But it is more than that. The historical novel aspect is not even the most important part of it. The historical background is precise and realistic enough, and never romanticized. This is by no means a writer's escape from the contemporary scene into vague longings for the past. Instead, in these three volumes Undset transfers the feelings -- well known to herself -- of happiness and sorrow, of ecstasy and despair back into a distant past. Not in order to romanticize them, though obviously Undset's choice of the Middle Ages is a result of her admiration of the rock-firm faith that characterized this period.\n\nShe transfers the protagonists to a distant past in order to establish the distance the author needs, in order to create a work of art from her own strong feelings and strict thoughts. She was aware of being on the threshold of something new in her authorship. She searches for, and finds, the necessary distance by going back to the Middle Ages. \"I am finding my feet, and quite unaided at that,\" she wrote to a friend.\n\nIt is life's mystery, as she knows it from her own experience, that she writes about in \"Kristin Lavrans-datter.\" That is why these 1,400 pages, as well as the 1,200 on \"Olav Audunssønn\" are timeless. Her characters are men and women of flesh and blood, they could well be our neighbors today. And Undset has put them in a natural setting which is ours to this day. It is the city of Oslo she knew so well, the valley -- Gudbrandsdalen -- that she loved, and her father's Trøndelag region.\n\nShe knew those settings intimately and they remain as they were when she wrote about them 70 years ago, and indeed as they were in the 13th century.\n\nIt was after she had broken out of her marriage that Sigrid Undset became mature enough to write her masterpiece. In the years between 1920 and 1927 she first published the 3-volume \"Kristin\", and then the 4-volume \"Olav\" (Audunssøn). Simultaneously with this creative process, she was engaged in trying to find the meaning of her own life, finding the answer in the God of Christianity. As she herself put it: \"He brought me in from the outposts.\"\n\nAt the end of this creative eruption, Sigrid Undset entered calmer waters. After 1929, she completed a series of novels set in contemporary Oslo, with a strong Catholic element. She selected her themes from the small, though interesting Catholic community in Norway. But here also, the main theme is love. She also published a number of weighty historical works, which undoubtedly did their bit in putting the history of Norway into a more sober perspective. In addition, she translated several Icelandic sagas into Norwegian and published a few literary essays, mainly on English literature, of which a long essay on the Brontë sisters, and one on D.H. Lawrence are especially worth mentioning. These are not great literature, but they are strong and inspiring.\n\nIn 1934, she published \"Eleven Years Old,\" an autobiographical work. With a minimum of camouflage, it tells the story of her own childhood in Kristiania, of her home, rich in intellectual values and love, and of her sick father. It is one of the most fetching Norwegian books ever written about a little girl, surpassed by very few. Sigrid Undset was passing from strength to strength.\n\nAt the end of the thirties she started on a new book, an historical novel set in 18th century Scandinavia. Only the first volume, \"Madame Dorthea,\" was published in 1939. The Second World War broke out. It was to break her, both as a person and as a writer. She never finished the set of 18th century novels. The War had sapped all her strength.\n\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in April 1940, she was forced to flee. She had strongly opposed Hitler and Nazism since the early 1930s, and from an early date her books were banned in Germany. She had no wish to be taken hostage by the Germans, and fled to Sweden. Her elder son, Anders, was killed in action at the age of 27, in April 1940, only a few kilometers from their home at Bjerkebæk. He was an officer in the Norwegian army and was killed in an encounter with German troops. Her sick daughter had died shortly before the outbreak of the War. Bjerkebæk was occupied by the German Army, and used as officers' quarters during the War.\n\nIn 1940, Sigrid Undset and her younger son left neutral Sweden for the United States. There, she untiringly pleaded her occupied country's cause, in writing and speeches. She returned to Norway after the liberation in 1945, worn out. She lived for another four years, but she never wrote another word.\n\nToday there is a strong indication that younger generations of Norwegians are becoming interested in her work. She accepts the moral responsi-bility of the individual, not only for him or herself, but also for the extended family, for nature, and for all living things around us.\n\nSigrid Undset in the 1990s By JANNEKEN ØVERLAND\n\nEven into the 1990s people continue to be fascinated by Norwegian author Sigrid Undset and her lifework. This fascination is manifested in the fact that her works, particularly the books about Kristin Lavransdatter, continue to be among the best-selling and most-read books in Norway. New stage and screen versions of Kristin Lavransdatter have been introduced. A Finnish-Norwegian theater production with original music written by bassist Arild Andersen has been performed in Norway and abroad. A clearer picture of Sigrid Undset is emerging in other ways as well.\n\nThis is due not least to the extensive biography published in 1993, \"Menneskenes hjerter - Sigrid Undset. En livshistorie\" (Aschehoug), written by Tordis Ørjasæter, professor of special education.\n\nThis biography complements in many ways the biography published by Gidske Anderson in 1989: \"Sigrid Undset - et liv\" (Gyldendal). Ørjasæter's book is based on an enormous amount of material including several new sources and gives a very well-documented picture of Sigrid Undset, particularly as a private person, but also as an author. Ørjasæter presents among other things new information about the father's illness, which it turns out was most likely a nervous disease like multiple sclerosis and not syphilis as previously believed. The biography provides an insightful depiction of the difficult working conditions she experienced as a young author and single parent, particularly her close relationship to her middle, retarded child. She also describes Undset's reasons for converting to Catholicism in greater detail than anyone else before. She shows how Undset's special knowledge of history and interest in the Middle Ages gave her a natural platform for gravitating towards Catholicism in Protestant Norway, and points out that her interest did not start in the 1920s, but had roots going far back in her life. Ørjasæter's book received the Norwegian \"Brageprisen\" award for the best nonfiction book in 1993 and has been translated into other languages.\n\nNot least, Norwegian actress and director Liv Ullmann's 1995 film version of the first part of the Kristin Lavransdatter trilogy helped put Undset on the Norwegian cultural map again. Over three hours long in its first version, the movie traces Kristin's early life on the farm and her relationship to her father, Lavrans, but concentrates mostly on the love story between her and Erland and ends with that she, against her parents' wishes, marries him. The movie was filmed for the most part on location in a Norwegian mountain valley, where an authentic medieval farm was built for that purpose. The combined talents of capable Norwegian actors and the world-famous Bergman photographer Sven Nykvist made film a success from the very beginning. A shorter version aimed at overseas markets and a TV version have also been made. A large, international film audience is thus set to become acquainted with Undset's Kristin Lavransdatter, perhaps the most famous Norwegian literary figure after Peer Gynt."
