        "text": "Sigrid Undset (born May 20, 1882, Kalundborg, Denmark—died June 10, 1949, Lillehammer, Norway) was a Norwegian novelist who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928.\n\nHer father was an archaeologist, and her home life was steeped in legend, folklore, and the history of Norway. Both this influence and her own life story are constantly present in her works—from Elleve aar (1934; Eleven Years), in which she tells of her childhood, to the story of her flight from Nazi-occupied Norway, published originally in English as Return to the Future (1942; Norwegian Tillbake til fremtiden).\n\nShe worked in the office of an electrical engineering firm for 10 years before she married, bore children, and began to write. Her early novels deal with the position of women in the contemporary unromantic world of the lower middle class. These include Splinten av troldspeilet (1917; Images in a Mirror) and Jenny (1911). She then turned to the distant past and created what is considered her masterpiece, the trilogy Kristin Lavransdatter (1920–22). Though the medieval climate of the novel is strikingly evoked, it is still a story of a woman’s fate, portraying the proud, independent Kristin’s growth, through her marriage to a charming but irresponsible man, into a strong but humble and self-sacrificing woman. Both in this and in the four-volume historical novel Olav Audunssøn (1925–27; The Master of Hestviken), religious problems are prominent and reflect the author’s preoccupation with such matters."
