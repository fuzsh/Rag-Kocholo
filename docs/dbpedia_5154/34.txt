Major General (retired) John Cantwell served in the first Gulf War in 1991, in Iraq in 2006 and as commander of all Australian forces in Afghanistan.

He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and was made a Member of the Order of Australia.

But in the course of his service John witnessed some truly dreadul events that burned images into his mind and wouldn't leave him.

It took a long time for John to finally open up about the post traumatic stress he'd been struggling with for years. He hopes it may help many others, too frightened or ashamed to speak up, to follow his lead.
