        "text": "Cover Type: Softcover\n\nBook Condition: As New\n\nJacket Condition: None Issued\n\nPublisher: Melbourne University Press\n\nPublisher Place: Carlton\n\nPublisher Year: 2013\n\nEdition: Reprint\n\nDescription: 398 pages. Book appears to have hardly been read and is in As new condition throughout. Even Though This Is My Story, It Is Also The Story Of Thousands Of Australian Veterans From Iraq, East Timor, Afghanistan And Other Conflicts Who Bare Similar Emotional Scars.\n\nPublishers Description: New edition includes a postscript and new article about the battle that led to Corporal Daniel Keighran's VC award John Cantwell, Queensland country boy, enlisted in the army as a private and rose to the rank of major general. He was on the front line in 1991 as Coalition forces fitted bulldozer blades to tanks and buried Iraqi troops alive. He served in Baghdad in 2006 and saw what a car bomb does to a crowded marketplace. He was commander of Australian forces in Afghanistan in 2010 when ten of his soldiers were killed. He came home in 2011 to be considered for the job of chief of the Australian Army. Instead, he ended up in a psychiatric hospital. Exit Wounds is the deeply human account of one man's tour of the War on Terror, the moving story of life on a modern battlefield- from the nightmare of cheating death in a field strewn with mines, to the utter despair of looking into the face of a dead soldier before sending his body home to his mother. Cantwell hid his post-traumatic stress disorder for decades, fearing it would affect his career. Australia has been at war for the past twenty years and yet there has been no stand-out account from these conflicts - Exit Wounds is it. Raw, candid and eye-opening, no one who reads this book will be unmoved.\n\nISBN: 9780522864670"
