        "text": "The eclectic paradigm has arguably become the dominant theoretical basis in the study of FDI, multinational corporations and internationalisation over the last two decades. The contributions to this volume evaluate the eclectic paradigm in the global economy and its validity as a theoretical basis to understand developments such as economic globalization and the subsequent growth of global and alliance capitalism.\n\nBiography\n\nJohn Cantwell is Professor of International Business at Rutgers University, USA (from 2002), while on leave of absence as Professor of International Economics at the University of Reading, UK.
