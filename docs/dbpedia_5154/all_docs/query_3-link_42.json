        "text": "About\n\nJohn Cantwell is the co-founder and director of Slí An Chroí School of Irish Celtic Shamanism based in Dublin, Ireland. He is also the co-founder of the City of Dublin Winter Solstice Festival. Having trained as a teacher and studied with the Irish Centre for Shamanic Studies, the Four Winds Society and indigenous communities in Australia, Mexico and Peru, John heard the call of the ancestors yearning to be remembered. He researched, journeyed and unearthed the Rites of Passage of the land of Ireland so that their wisdom could be restored to Celtic soul seekers worldwide. John incorporated these vital traditions into the Slí An Chroí ‘Introduction to Irish Celtic Shamanism’, which accepts students from different dogmas and backgrounds. This serves as a strong foundation for the Slí An Chroí ‘Medicine Spiral’, which introduces students to shamanic practices and deepens their spiritual connection.\n\nIt’s important to note while the participants at our events & on this site take their work very seriously, all consultations with the psychic & mediums listed are for educational, spiritual, and entertainment purposes only and are not intended to, nor should they ever, take the place of any medical, legal, financial, traditional psychological, or other professional advice. In addition, all holistic therapists listed do not claim to cure or diagnose any medical condition in the same way as a doctor/physician. Their opinion is that of a holistic, complementary, and alternative therapist and their professional opinions, advice, examinations, and recommendations do not constitute the medical advice of a doctor/physician."
