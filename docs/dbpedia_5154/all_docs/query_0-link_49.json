        "text": "Michelle DeLaune is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.\n\nSince she began her career at NCMEC two decades ago, DeLaune has held numerous positions, most recently serving 8 years as its Chief Operating Officer. During her tenure at NCMEC, she witnessed first-hand the evolving threats that face our children and has expanded NCMEC's programmatic response to both missing and exploited children.\n\nNCMEC continues to see an explosion in cases of children going missing from the child welfare system as well as children being sexually trafficked. In addition, incidents of child sexual exploitation online continue to grow exponentially. Under her leadership, new programs have been implemented to better serve these vulnerable populations including a child sex trafficking recovery-planning team and NCMEC's Child Victim Identification Program which has contributed to the identification and rescue of thousands of children from sexually abusive situations.\n\nEmphasizing the human element, DeLaune has championed a reignited focus on the importance of survivor informed responses where those with lived experience provide valuable input into NCMEC programs. She's helped establish multiple survivor expert working groups to amplify the voices of those impacted by these crimes and inspire change in the world.\n\nEmbracing new technology has transformed NCMEC and its impact. DeLaune created the first-ever data science program as a discipline at NCMEC. Data mining allows NCMEC to provide timely, meaningful information to better protect children.\n\nDeLaune is the first woman to lead the non-profit organization since it opened its doors in 1984.\n\nOn numerous occasions, DeLaune has testified before the U.S. Congress about matters pertaining to the sexual exploitation of children and has represented NCMEC at high-level events around the world. She has written articles regarding the importance of identifying child victims depicted in sexually abusive material. She received a B.A. with a major in psychology from George Mason University and an M.A. in Criminology from the University of Maryland at College Park. She lives with her husband and daughter in Northern Virginia.\n\nStaca Shehan joined the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in 1999 and is the vice president of the Analytical Services Division. She is responsible for policy decisions and overall operations within the division, including oversight of the Child Sex Trafficking Team and Sex Offender Tracking Team. In this role, she helps create and manage the division’s budget; conducts interviews about issues relating to child sex trafficking, noncompliant registered sex offenders, internet crimes against children and attempted abductions of children; and provides training sessions to the public, private industry, other nonprofits and law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn 2011, Ms. Shehan spearheaded the creation of the Child Sex Trafficking Team at NCMEC to respond to the increased need for technical assistance and analysis in child sex trafficking cases. This dedicated team provides support to law enforcement agencies who are working to identify and recover children victimized through sex trafficking and successfully prosecute those involved in trafficking children. These unique resources include analysis of potential suspects and child sex trafficking victims/potential victims.\n\nIn 2017, Ms. Shehan was selected as one of 21 representative members on the National Advisory Committee on Sex Trafficking of Children and Youth in the United States. The Committee advises the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General on policies improving the nation’s response to the sex trafficking of children and youth in the United States. She has also written several articles on behalf of NCMEC regarding child sex trafficking and children missing from care. Such publications were featured in the ‘United States Attorneys' USA Bulletin, Vol. 65, No. 6’ and by the OJP Diagnostic Center.\n\nDuring her career at NCMEC, Ms. Shehan also developed and implemented the Sex Offender Tracking Team. The team created procedures and protocols used by analysts to provide technical assistance to law enforcement in their efforts to locate noncompliant sex offenders. During this process, she worked closely with NCMEC programmers to outline the creation of the Sex Offender Case Management system. This system allows analysts to track offenders and compare their geographic locations to open and unsolved child abductions, attempted abductions and incidents of child sexual exploitation.\n\nMs. Shehan holds a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from La Salle University with a minor in Criminal Justice and Certificates in Executive Leadership and High-Performance Leadership from Cornell University.\n\nRevé Drew Walsh is co-founder of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. In 1981, after the tragic abduction and murder of their son, Adam, Mrs. Walsh and her husband, John, began what would become a lifetime of service dedicated to finding missing children, reducing child exploitation, and preventing future victimization. When it became undeniable that there was a lack of attention to the issues of missing and exploited children, what started as Revé responding to letters from other families of missing children in the garage of their Florida home, turned into the establishment of the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, which would go on to become the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.\n\nTheir advocacy has influenced the course of child protection in the U.S. through legislation and the work of the National Center. The first law that passed in the aftermath of Adam’s murder, the “Missing Children’s Act” in 1982, required the FBI to enter a missing child’s information into their national database which all law enforcement could access. Then, in 1984, President Reagan signed the “Missing Children’s Assistance Act,” which officially created NCMEC and designated it as the country’s clearinghouse for missing children. Twenty-two years later, President George W. Bush signed a new, resolute law to track and apprehend convicted sex offenders who disappear after their release from prison: The “Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act.”\n\nOver the 35+ years since NCMEC’s founding, Revé Walsh has been a tireless advocate for children and has served on NCMEC’s Board of Directors.\n\nRevé and John are proud of the legacy they have created for their son Adam, and are similarly proud of their three other children; Callahan, Meghan, and Hayden and all that they have and will accomplish.\n\nThe Honorable Regina B. Schofield is Director of Corporate Engagement and Education Outreach for Battelle. Ms. Schofield’s portfolio includes furthering innovative efforts to create tomorrow’s workforce by leading STEM education outreach and directing all of Battelle’s regional philanthropy engagements.\n\nPrior to her position with Battelle, she was employed with Casey Family Programs and transformed Casey’s approach by integrating policies and data from state level stakeholders with broader, national public policy objectives in Washington, D.C. Before joining Casey, Ms. Schofield was nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve as Assistant Attorney General (AAG) for the Office of Justice Programs at the U.S. Department of Justice. As AAG, she served as the nation’s AMBER Alert Coordinator and instituted Wireless Amber Alerts and Amber Alerts in Native American communities. She oversaw a range of federal programs, including Project Safe Childhood, the Prisoner Reentry Initiative, and the White House Initiative on Helping America’s Youth among many other programs.\n\nBefore her appointment as Assistant Attorney General, Ms. Schofield was Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and White House Liaison at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In this dual capacity, she served as the Secretary’s senior advisor on all state, local, and tribal issues regarding HHS policies and programs and was the primary personnel link between HHS and the White House.\n\nMs. Schofield is a recipient of the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement Award and currently serves on the boards of the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation, Children’s Science Center, the Conrad Foundation, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the National Center for the Prevention of Community Violence (aka Solve Violence), the Maryland Business Roundtable for Education, 100kin10 Post 21 Cabinet, the Research Advisory Committee of the National Collaborative on Gun Violence Research and is a corporate officer of the Battelle Education board.\n\nShe received her M.B.A. from Jackson State University and her bachelor’s degree in business administration from Mississippi College.

Providing equal economic opportunity to Rural America continues to be her lifelong pursuit.\n\nFormer Republican Senator Bob Corker called Senator Heitkamp “stronger than battery acid.” Democratic Senator Jon Tester said “she has been incredibly effective” in the Senate.\n\nSenator Heitkamp courageously voted against Justice Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court after hearing testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanuagh’s response testimony. Following the vote, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said Senator Heitkamp had, “become a bit of a feminist icon.”\n\nThroughout her time in public service, Senator Heitkamp has stood up for tribal communities and worked to improve outcomes for Native American children, women, and families. The first bill she introduced in the Senate, which became law in 2016, created a Commission on Native Children. Her bill with former Senator John McCain became law to create Amber Alerts in Indian Country. She introduced Savanna’s Act to help address the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women.

The settlement resulted in the award of about $527.5 million to North Dakota taxpayers to date. It was one of the largest civil settlements in U.S. history. When very little of this funding was being spent on anti-tobacco programs as intended, Senator Heitkamp led a successful ballot initiative in 2008 that mandated significant increases.\n\nPreviously, Senator Heitkamp served as North Dakota’s Tax Commissioner. Under her tenure, the State of North Dakota attempted to make catalog retailers collect the sales tax the state and municipalities were already owed on sales. The debate went all the way to the Supreme Court in the case Quill v. North Dakota. Two and a half decades later, in 2018, the Supreme Court overturned the 1992 ruling siding with Senator Heitkamp’s arguments, and finally leveling the playing field for brick-and-mortar businesses.\n\nSenator Heitkamp received a B.A. from the University of North Dakota and a law degree from Lewis and Clark Law School.
