        "text": "[spouse(s) unknown]\n\nProfile last modified 14 Aug 2022 | Created 16 Feb 2021\n\nThis page has been accessed 364 times.\n\nThe 2nd of two consecutive John Cantwells who were Archbishop of Cashel in the 1400s. It is unclear how exactly they were related -- possibly uncle and nephew. The John Cantwell who preceded him was Archbishop from 1440-1452.\n\nThis John (ca.1424-1484) is considered to be the progenitor of the Lords of Moykarky of the 1500s. In terms of pedigree, John's direct ancestor appears to have been Gilbert Cantwell, founder of the Tipperary branch of Cantwells in the early 1200s.[1] Gilbert was the likely son of \"gateway ancestor\" Hugh Cantwell, who arrived in Ireland with Strongbow.[2]\n\nNote: For more background on the Irish Cantwells, please see the page Cantwells in Ireland 1200-1600.\n\nBiography\n\nJohn Cantwell served as Archbishop of Cashel from May 1452 (shortly after the death of the earlier John Cantwell) until his own death in 1484.[3]\n\nHe had a son, John Cantwell, Lord of Moykarky (b.1450) who gave testimony in 1516, age 66, in favor of Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond and his right to inherit the title in the male line.[4]\n\nExcerpts from the Dictionary of Irish Biography, with edits for clarity:[5]\n\nJohn Cantwell (1424–82?), Archbishop of Cashel, was, like his kinsman and predecessor, John Cantwell (c.1405–52), an illegitimate member of the important Cantwell family of Kilkenny & Tipperary.\n\nHe was a scholar at Eagle Hall, Oxford, in May 1439, and later graduated as a bachelor in civil law. He returned to Tipperary, was ordained, and became Dean of Cashel sometime before 1445. He was consecrated in May 1452 after provision to the archbishopric by Pope Nicholas V, but was attainted by the Irish parliament in November 1456 for taking office without the King's prior permission, and failing to appear before parliament to account for his actions. This attainder was reversed in February 1458 on the grounds of illness, and Cantwell continued to hold his episcopal office till his death in 1482.\n\nHe held two provincial synods, at Limerick (1453) and Fethard (1480), and was also active in the secular matters of his diocese, endowing monasteries and protecting church lands within the diocese, by force or interdict if necessary.\n\nHe does not seem to have supported the Butler Revolt of 1469,[6] but he was closely connected with the family and probably acted as a neutral intermediary between the minor Butler clans. On his death Cantwell was buried in the Cathedral in Cashel. A professional praise poem concerning his life survives, indicating that he was accepted and admired by the Gaelic Irish of his diocese as well as by the Anglo-Irish.\n\n\"The Oxford [University] register notes 5 Cantwell entrants from Ireland in the late 14th and early 15th century. which must have been an expensive family investment. At least 3 of them were illegitimate. However. the investment paid off and both rose, consecutively, to position of Archbishop of Cashel in the church. As they were both illegitimate, dispensation was needed for them to take holy orders. Further, it is clear that the latter of the two fathered at least one son himself who seems to have inherited family lands, as it is believed that the Cantwells of Moycarky were direct descendents of the archbishop.\"[7]\n\nFrom History of the Irish Hierarchy:[8]\n\nJohn Cantwell, bachelor of laws, was promoted in 1450 by provision of the Pope; was consecrated in 1452, in which year he was granted the vicarage of the church of Rathkellan to the monastery of Holycross. He held a provincial synod at Limerick in 1453. In July 1480 he celebrated another at Fethard, assisted by Mathew, bishop of Killaloe; Thomas, bishop of Limerick; John, bishop of Ardfert; and William, bishop of Cork and Cloyne. This prelate obtained many privileges from King Edward IV. He repaired the monastery of the Dominicans [1480] at his own charge, which had been destroyed by fire.\n\nArchbishop Cantwell is mentioned in William Grattan Flood's A History of Irish Music, Chapter XIV (1905): [9]\n\nExcerpted from the chapter \"Cashel History\" in Samuel Lewis' A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837):[10]\n\n\"In 1243 a Dominican friary was founded by Archbishop David Mac Kelly, which being destroyed by an accidental fire, was rebuilt by Archbishop Cantwell, who was constituted both patron and founder by an instrument dated at Limerick about the year 1480.\"\n\nExcerpted from \"English Settlers in 14th Century Ireland\":[11]\n\n\"Four elegies for marcher lords of Ely[12] have been translated from the Irish. It is believed that they were written by a poet living near Cashel in the late 15th or early 16th century. The introduction suggests that they were (along with other verse and prose in the manuscript) written for a John Cantwell of Moycarky, son of John Cantwell, archbishop of Cashel (died 1482). The archbishop is the subject of the first elegy, whilst James Purcell of Loughmoe,[13] Tadhg [Teige] O'Carroll of Rathenny and Philip Hacket of Balysheehan, probably families related to the Cantwells, are the others.\"\n\n\"The elegies follow usual Gaelic tradition; extravagant sorrow, the similarities of the subject to earlier Irish heroes and the battle roll (although John Cantwell's roll consists of administrative victories for the church). The very fact that the poems were written for these English lords, as well as the insights from the content, shows how much of the Gaelic culture had been assimilated by these marcher lords by the 16th century.\"\n\nElaborating on the above: The younger John Cantwell, Lord of Moykarky, gave testimony in 1516, age 66 (born 1450), that his father John Cantwell, Archbishop of Cashel, had travelled widely across Ireland with James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond (the White Earl), in the days before the elder John became Archbishop (bef. 1452).[14]\n\nFamily Origins\n\nThe Cantwells came to Ireland following the Anglo-Norman invasion. Although they produced no famous figure in Irish history, they played a prominent part in the life of the country starting in the early 13th century, when they appeared as de Kentewall, de Cantwell etc. (of Kentwell in Suffolk). In the records of the Ormond country, a witness to the foundation charter of Owney Abbey in 1200 is found. Their estates lay chiefly in the baronies of Knocktopher and Gowran, Co. Kilkenny, Cantwell's Court, 4 miles north of Kilkenny city, was their principal seat. In 1598 they were listed among the principal gentlemen both in Co. Kilkenny and Co. Tipperary.[15]\n\nThough they appeared as soldiers and officials -- two were officers in James II's army and one was sheriff of Kilkenny and three were attainted in 1691 -- the most notable Cantwells were ecclesiastics. As early as 1208 we find a Cantwell in the registry of the monastery of Kells (Ossory). Two John Cantwells were Archbishops of Cashel in the 1400s.[16][17][18] Richard Cantwell was Bishop of Waterford and Lismore from 1426 to 1446, and Oliver Cantwell (d.1527) was Bishop of Ossory for almost 40 years. Also in the 1500s, Patrick Cantwell was Abbot of Navan and Richard Cantwell was Prior of St. John's Kilkenny.[19]\n\nChief families since the English invasion in Kilkenny: Butler, Grace,[20] Walsh,[21] Fitzgerald, Roth,[22] Archer,[23] Cantwell,[24] Shortall [Forstall],[25] Purcell,[26] Power, Morris, Dalton or d'Alton,[27] Stapleton, Wandesford, Lawless, Langrish, Bryan, Ponsonby.[28]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Carrigan, History of the Diocese of Ossory (1905), Vol.3, pp.275+\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/historyandantiq01carrgoog/page/n319/mode/2up?q=Gilbert+de+Kentewell\n\n↑ Possible pedigree for John Cantwell (work in progress):\n\nHugh (born in England ca.1145)\n\nGilbert (born in Ireland ca.1180)\n\nThomas (born ca.1210), witness ca.1259-1283 (Ormond Deeds, Vol.1, entry 127, p.57)\n\nJohn (born ca.1240) witness in 1305 (Ormond Deeds, Vol.1, entry #374, p.148)\n\nMilo (born ca.1270), witness in 1305 (Ormond Deeds, Vol.1, entry #374, p.148)\n\nJohn (born ca.1300), summoned to war in Scotland 1335)\n\nMilo (born ca.1325)\n\nJohn (born ca.1350) of Buolick, Slievardagh, Tipperary (Ormond Deeds v2, item 183)\n\n(1 or 2 generations)\n\nArchbishop John (born illegitimate ca.1424)\n\nJohn, Lord of Moykarky (1450-1531)\n\npossibly \"Master/Magistrate/Monsignor James Cantwell\" (born ca.1485), official of the city and diocese of Ossory, mentioned often in the Ormond Deeds, Vol.4, as witness for the Earls of Ormond from the 1510s until at least the 1530s:\n\nCalendar of Ormond Deeds, Vol IV, 1509-47:\n\nhttp://www.irishmanuscripts.ie/digital/Calendar%20of%20Ormond%20Deeds%20Vol.%20IV.%201509-1547/data/search.xml\n\nPiers, Lord of Moykarky (1520-ca.1572)\n\nJohn, Lord of Moykarky (1550-1622)\n\n↑ http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/cash0.htm#32534\n\n↑ James Graves, The history, architecture, and antiquities of the cathedral church of St. Canice, Kilkenny (Dublin: Hodges, Smith, & Co, 1857), p.209:\n\n\"There exists in the Evidence Chamber, Kilkenny Castle, another document (under the mark and certificate of Thomas Fyan, an Ossory clergyman, and notary public), whereby Oliver [Cantwell], Bishop of Ossory, makes known to all whom it may concern, that on the 8th of November, 1516, Piers Butler, Earl of Ormonde, petitioned him to record the testimony of certain witnesses in proof that the Earldom of Ormonde, and the property attached thereto, were entailed on heirs male.\"\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/TheHistoryArchitectureAndAntiquities/page/n245/mode/2up\n\n↑ Dictionary of Irish Biography, entry for John Cantwell (1424-84), Archbishop of Cashel:\n\nhttps://www.dib.ie/biography/cantwell-john-a1450\n\n↑ The Butler Revolt of 1569 pitted 2nd son Sir Edmund Butler of Cloghgrenan & Dullogh against his elder brother Thomas, 10th Earl of Ormond.\n\n↑ Angela Mungham, English settlers in 14th-century Ireland.
