        "text": "Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and Washington are up next with their primaries on Tuesday. Another dozen states will hold contests through September 10. See the calendar >>\n\nNote that in Washington, all candidates appear on a single ballot. The top two finishers advance to the general election. The election is also conducted entirely by mail.\n\nUse the links below for full results. Displayed are the poll closings converted to Eastern Time.\n\nKansas - 8/9 PM* Michigan - 8/9 PM* Missouri - 8 PM Washington - 11 PM\n\n* 7:00 PM local time. The vast majority of Kansas and Michigan are in the time zone closing at 8:00 PM Eastern.\n\nOn this page, we'll highlight some of the key races to watch, organized by office.\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nMichigan, Missouri, and Washington each have a Senate seat up this year. At this point, only Michigan looks to be competitive in the general election.\n\nMichigan\n\nDemocratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiring after four terms in office. Her party primary pits Rep. Elissa Slotkin (MI-07) against actor Hill Harper. Slotkin is a strong favorite to win the nomination.\n\nFor the Republicans, a larger field early in the campaign has shrunk as several prominent names withdrew. One of those, Sandy Pensler, withdrew too late to be removed from the ballot. Of the other three active candidates, Former Rep. Mike Rogers (MI-08) is favored over former Rep. Justin Amash (MI-03) and physician Sherry O'Donnell.\n\nThis article summarizes both primaries in a bit more detail.\n\nMissouri\n\nRepublican Sen. Josh Hawley is unopposed for renomination. Most forecasters see him as likely to win a second term in November.\n\nLucas Kunce, who leads a nonprofit, is favored to win the Democratic nomination. Kunce ran for the state's other Senate seat in 2022. He finished second to Trudy Busch Valentine in a large primary field that year.\n\nWashington\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maria Cantwell is favored to win a 5th term. She is joined by ten others on the all-party ballot, including five Republicans, three independents, and one Democrat.\n\nCantwell and Republican Raul Garcia are expected to advance to the general election. Garcia previously ran for governor in 2020, finishing fifth out of 36 (!!) candidates on the primary ballot that year.\n\nU.S. House\n\nThere are two incumbents at risk of losing their seats in Tuesday's primaries.\n\nMissouri District 1 (Democratic)\n\nThe pro-Israel groups that helped oust Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D, NY-16) are looking to do the same here with Rep. Cori Bush. Both are members of \"The Squad\" of far-left Democrats. Like Bowman, Bush has been a vocal critic of Israel's prosecution of the war with Hamas.\n\nSt. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell has benefited from over $8 million in attack ads against Bush. The support has made this one of the most expensive House primaries in history.\n\nPolling has been limited. A late July survey showed Bell with a 48% to 42% lead over Bush. The same pollster had it 43% to 42% for Bell a month earlier. Taken at face value, this indicates a competitive race perhaps moving toward Bell. However, some caution is warranted as the sponsor of the survey is supportive of Bell.\n\nWashington District 4\n\nOf the ten GOP House members that voted to impeach Donald Trump, only Reps. Dan Newhouse and David Valadao (CA-22) remain in Congress.\n\nNewhouse has seven challengers on the primary ballot. The most notable are fellow Republicans Tiffany Smiley and Jerrod Sessler. Trump endorsed Sessler, a former NASCAR driver, early in the campaign.\n\nSmiley, a nurse, ran for Senate in 2022, losing to Democrat Patty Murray in the general election. She received a late endorsement from Trump.\n\nGiven a split Democratic field in a strong GOP district, there's a decent chance that two Republicans will advance to the general election. Whether the incumbent is one of them remains to be seen.\n\nThe remainder of these House primaries are in alphabetical order by state and then district.\n\nKansas District 2 (Republican)\n\nRep. Jake LaTurner is not seeking a third term. He won by a 15% margin in 2022 and most forecasters see the general election as safely Republican.\n\nEndorsed by Donald Trump, former Attorney General Derek Schmidt is favored. Schmidt was the party's nominee for governor in 2022, losing by 2% to incumbent Democrat, Laura Kelly.\n\nMichigan District 8 (Both)\n\nThe retirement of six-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee has most forecasters rating this district a general election toss-up.\n\nThree candidates are seeking the Democratic nomination; state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet appears to be the frontrunner.\n\nThe Republican field also numbers three. Paul Junge, who was the 8th district nominee in both 2020 and 2022, is expected to get a third opportunity to win the seat. Junge is a former TV news anchor and prosecutor.\n\nThe nearby 7th district is the state's other toss-up general election race. Incumbent Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin is running for Senate. Democrat Curtis Hertel and Republican Tom Barrett have no primary opposition.\n\nMichigan District 10 (Democratic)\n\nOpen after Census redistricting, Republican Rep. John James won this district in 2022 by about 0.5% over Democrat Carl Marlinga. James is unopposed for renomination.\n\nMalinga is looking for a rematch, but must first get by three others on the primary ballot.\n\nMissouri District 3 (Republican)\n\nRep. Blaine Luetkemeyer is retiring after eight terms. This is a safe GOP district; the incumbent won his final election by a 30% margin in 2022. There are seven candidates on the ballot, although state Rep. Justin Hicks has withdrawn from the race.\n\nThe nominee is expected to be either Bob Onder or Kurt Schaefer, both former state Senators. Onder has been endorsed by Donald Trump.\n\nWashington District 3\n\nOne of the closest general election races in 2022 occurred here. Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez flipped the district, besting Republican Joe Kent by less than 1%.\n\nKent had finished second in the top-two primary that year, ousting incumbent Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler.\n\nThis primary is expected to result in a general election rematch in November.\n\nWashington District 5\n\nIncumbent Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers is not seeking reelection. Eleven candidates are looking to succeed her. Per The Cook Political Report ($), \"Spokane County Treasurer Michael Baumgartner is the only candidate with an almost guaranteed ticket to November. He’s been up on TV since mid-June with a series of ads touting his conservative record in the state senate, and has a $500,000 fundraising lead over his nearest competitor.\"\n\nSecond place could go to a Democrat or another Republican. Either way, the seat is expected to remain in GOP hands after the November election.\n\nWashington District 6\n\nIncumbent Democratic Rep. Derek Kilmer is not seeking reelection. There are five candidates on the ballot. Three appear to be competitive: state Sen Emily Randall (D), Public Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz (D) and state Sen. Drew MacEwan (R).\n\nThe top two finishers could be both Democrats or one of the Democrats and MacEwan. Either way, the seat is expected to be won by Democrats in November.\n\nGovernor\n\nMissouri\n\nRepublican Mike Parson is ineligible to run due to term-limit laws. The winner of the GOP primary will be favored to succeed him in November.\n\nThere are nine candidates on that ballot. Polling indicates a very tight race between Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe. Also seeing significant support is state Sen. Bill Eigel.\n\nAll three of these candidates have been endorsed by Donald Trump.\n\nFor the Democrats, most of the establishment support is behind House Minority Leader Crystal Quade. However, businessman Mike Hamra has raised more money, largely due to his ability to self-fund.\n\nThe only recent public poll ($) showed Hamra leading 23% to 21%. That is well within the margin of error, and may not ultimately be all that predictive given nearly half of those polled were still undecided.\n\nWashington\n\nDemocratic Gov. Jay Inslee is not seeking a 4th term. A massive field of nearly 30 candidates is looking to succeed him. However, all signs point to Attorney General Bob Ferguson (D) and former Rep. Dave Reichert (R, WA-08) advancing to the general election.\n\nAlthough Washington hasn't elected a Republican governor since 1980, the general election between these two is shaping up to be at least somewhat competitive.\n\nUpcoming Elections and Events\n\nDown-ballot primaries will continue through early September. The remaining ones are listed below, along with other contests we'll be tracking during that period."
