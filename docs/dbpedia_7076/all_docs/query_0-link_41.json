        "text": "This article is updated frequently as movies leave and enter Netflix. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nYou want to see something really scary this October? Netflix subscribers have commonly made horror films the most-watched on the streaming service, and the original filmmaking factory at the company keeps churning out new ones in time for Halloween — or picking them up at film festivals. The truth is that the horror section of Netflix’s movie library is one of its deepest catalogs, which can make separating the quality from the junk harder than in some other sections. That’s why we’re here. These are the best horror films on Netflix right now.\n\nHow We Pick Our Films\n\nCritic Brian Tallerico watches and writes about movies and TV every day. To curate this list, he dives into Netflix’s catalogue every month to surface terrifying horror titles — using his taste and a lifetime of cinema study as his guide, instead of whatever the algorithm happens to be pushing. After triple-checking to make sure they’re still available, he watches each and writes his recommendation. We highlight more than just the crowdpleasers: Filmmakers can use horror to craft spine-tingling moods, keep audiences on their toes, and comment on culture. Read on to find something to watch.\n\nAmerican Psycho\n\nYear: 2000\n\nRuntime: 1h 41m\n\nDirector: Mary Harron\n\nMary Harron’s adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel was instantly controversial but also instantly iconic. Christian Bale stepped into the role of the serial killer that had caused an uproar in the literary world and redefined the way we see psychopaths in cinema. His performance has been mimicked so many times just in the two decades since this unforgettable film was released.\n\nAnnabelle\n\nYear: 2014\n\nRuntime: 1h 38m\n\nDirector: John R. Leonetti\n\nThe universe of The Conjuring got its first spin-off in this unpacking of the tale of Annabelle, a doll being held in the haunted objects chamber of Ed and Lorraine Warren in those films. The origin story of the haunted doll stars Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, and Alfre Woodard. It’s not great — the sequels are actually better — but it’s essential to the overall story of this wildly successful horror universe.\n\nApostle\n\nYear: 2018\n\nRuntime: 2h 10m\n\nDirector: Gareth Evans\n\nDid you know the director of The Raid (and its awesome sequel) has also directed a kick-ass Netflix Original horror movie? Released in 2018, Apostle stars the great Dan Stevens (The Guest) as a man who journeys to a Welsh island in search of his missing sister and finds a community that’s not exactly welcoming. Kind of written off as a riff on The Wicker Man, this is a wicked little movie, elevated greatly by a fantastic performance from Michael Sheen.\n\nThe Babadook\n\nYear: 2014\n\nRuntime: 1h 33m\n\nDirector: Jennifer Kent\n\nOne of the best horror films of the 2010s has not always been widely available for streaming subscribers so take the chance to watch it again while it’s on Netflix. Jennifer Kent’s directorial debut centers on a mother (Essie Davis) who struggles to raise her problem child alone after the death of her husband. Oh, and there’s also a real monster in the boy’s room.\n\n*Bone Tomahawk\n\nYear: 2015\n\nRuntime: 2h 11m\n\nDirector: S. Craig Zahler\n\nS. Craig Zahler has become one of the most divisive filmmakers working today after three vicious, brutal movies — Bone Tomahawk, Brawl in Cell Block 99, and Dragged Across Concrete. This one is still his best, a slow-burn Western that stars Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, and Richard Jenkins as a posse of men who hunt a group of indigenous savages. The final act is terrifying and intense. You won’t forget it.\n\nCam\n\nYear: 2018\n\nRuntime: 1h 35m\n\nDirector: Daniel Goldhaber\n\nYou haven’t seen a mindbender quite like this one. Madeline Brewer stars as a camgirl who will do whatever it takes to rise the ranks of her online service. As she does so, she discovers that there’s a competitor who has basically taken her place, leading to a Lynchian dissection of how much someone can give of themselves to the internet machine. It’s unforgettably weird.\n\nThe Conjuring\n\nYear: 2013\n\nRuntime: 1h 51m\n\nDirector: James Wan\n\nOne of the biggest horror films of the 2010s introduced the world to Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga), the real investigators of paranormal occurrences, and it launched an entire industry of horror movies. The first film is still the best, anchored by Lili Taylor’s great performance as a woman whose ordinary life was turned upside down by a ghost in her farmhouse in the early ‘70s. Note: Both sequels are on Netflix too.\n\nCreep 1/2\n\nYear: 2014\n\nRuntime: 1h 17m\n\nDirector: Patrick Brice\n\nDirector Patrick Brice draws something fascinating and malevolent out of Mark Duplass in these very low budget horror indies. Duplass plays a man who places an ad for a videographer — played by Brice himself in the first and Desiree Akhavan in the second — and then basically proves the depth of his insanity. In the first film, he seems like more of an annoying friend until it’s revealed he’s a sociopath, and the superior second film explores just how crazy he is with a better set-up in which to play.\n\nDisappear Completely\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 1h 40m\n\nDirector: Luis Javier Henaine\n\nDisappear Completely one rocks, and you probably haven’t even heard of it. This Mexican horror film is the story of Santiago, a photographer who will do whatever it takes to get the story. After one particularly gross assignment, he’s cursed, leading him to lose each of his five senses, one by one. It’s kind of like Serpent and the Rainbow meets Nightcrawler.\n\nFear Street\n\nYear: 2021\n\nRuntime: 1h 47m\n\nDirector: Leigh Janiak\n\nRemember how much this took over the horror world in Summer 2021? Based on the books by R.L. Stine, these three films told the story of a curse that had descended on a small town and unfolded across three films set in different eras — 1994, 1978, and 1666. Fans argued over which one was the best (1994), but it’s best to appreciate these now as one piece of sharply-written horror entertainment. And a couple of the most talented Stranger Things stars (Sadie Sink and Maya Hawke) help too.\n\nGerald’s Game\n\nYear: 2017\n\nRuntime: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: Mike Flanagan\n\nBefore he helmed The Haunting of Hill House, Mike Flanagan co-wrote and directed one of the best Netflix Original horror films in this adaptation of Stephen King’s 1992 novel of the same name. Carla Gugino is phenomenal as a woman who gets handcuffed to her bed by her toxic husband…and then he has a heart attack. As she tries to figure out how she will survive, she accesses the trauma of her past.\n\nHis House\n\nYear: 2020\n\nRuntime: 1h 33m\n\nDirector: Remi Weekes\n\nWhat if it’s not houses that are haunted but people? That’s the question at the core of this story of an immigrant couple (a fantastic Wunmi Mosaku and Sope Dirisu) from South Sudan who move to an English town and face enemies both outside of their new home and within it. This is a strikingly original horror flick that has been largely underrated. Don’t miss it.\n\nIt Follows\n\nYear: 2015\n\nRuntime: 1h 40m\n\nDirector: David Robert Mitchell\n\nMaika Monroe stars in this 2014 indie horror breakthrough hit as a young woman who discovers that her recent sexual activity has cursed her with a supernatural force that will chase her until she passes it along to someone else. Stylish and striking, this felt like nothing else on the American horror market in 2014, really ushering in the era of what is now called “elevated horror.” Whatever you call it, It Follows is still an unforgettable genre flick.\n\nOuija: Origin of Evil\n\nYear: 2016\n\nRuntime: 1h 39m\n\nDirector: Mike Flanagan\n\nSequels to mediocre horror films aren’t traditionally any good. Every rule has an exception. The director of Gerald’s Game helmed this fantastic prequel about a couple who have a phony séance business. Their lives are turned upside down when they bring a Ouija board into their act, unknowingly unleashing a spirit that possesses their daughter. Smart and tightly made, it was a sign of things to come from the future Hill House creator.\n\nThe Perfection\n\nYear: 2019\n\nRuntime: 1h 30m\n\nDirector: Richard Shepard\n\nGirls and Get Out star Allison Williams stars in this twisting and turning tale of a talented young musician who travels to Shanghai where she meets a competitor named Lizzie, played by Logan Browning. A story that keeps shifting and changing ultimately arrives at a shocking conclusion in this Netflix Original that took the festival scene by storm in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe Platform\n\nYear: 2019\n\nRuntime: 1h 34m\n\nDirector: Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia\n\nSometimes the only thing a fun horror movie needs is a clever concept. This one is undeniably that. This Spanish film takes place in a “Vertical Self-Management Center,” a prison with dozens of floors to house its inmates. For sustenance, a platform descends the center of the tower. People near the top get much more than those at the bottom, which is kind of like a symbol for, well, everything. Unpredictable and tense, this is one of the best Netflix Original horror flicks.\n\nThe Pope’s Exorcist\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: Julius Avery\n\nListen, this is no masterpiece, but there’s something fascinating about seeing an Oscar winner like Russell Crowe commit so completely to a B-movie this ludicrous. Crowe is all-in as the infamous Father Gabriele Amorth, a purported real-life exorcist who tries to save a possessed boy in Spain. This is a defiantly goofy movie, but it’s better than its quick theatrical run would have you believe, and a great fit for the Netflix horror roster of movies you can watch while you do something on your phone.\n\nThanksgiving\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 46m\n\nDirector: Eli Roth\n\nThe famous horror director went full slasher with this adaptation of his trailer from the 2007 film Grindhouse into a full, grisly feature. It starts with a Black Friday sale that becomes a bloodbath, leading to a series of violent murders on the one-year anniversary of the chaos, committed by a man in a John Carver mask. Obviously inspired by grindhouse horror of the ‘70s and ‘80s, it’s a reminder that sometimes horror is better when it’s more fun than “elevated.”\n\nUnder the Shadow\n\nYear: 2016\n\nRuntime: 1h 24m\n\nDirectors: Babak Anvari\n\nThe Iranian-born Anvari wrote and directed this brilliant interplay of horror tropes and commentary on how war and violence can shatter the world more than a ghost could ever consider. A mother and daughter are haunted in 1980s Tehran during the historical War of the Cities. If the falling bombs won’t get them, something more supernatural might.\n\nThe Wailing\n\nYear: 2016\n\nRuntime: 2h 36m\n\nDirector: Na Hong-jin\n\nNa Hong-jin’s 2016 film is not one you should pick to watch casually for date night. It takes a commitment over 150 minutes, but it’s worth every minute. There’s a cumulative power to this story of a policeman who investigates a strange series of events in a small town and basically discovers ancient evil, an epic tale that rewards your commitment with a final act that’s devastating and unforgettable.\n\nIf you subscribe to a service through our links, Vulture may earn an affiliate commission."
