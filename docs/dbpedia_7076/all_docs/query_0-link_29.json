YES NO\n\nAmityvillle horror house\n\nI wanted to go to the amityville horror house with my mother and brother. When i got to the road that it was on, I felt a strange feeling I couldn't explain. We couldn't find it thinking it could have been bulldozed. We went back exactly a year later. This time we found it I took a picture and I had a strange feeling after taking it, so I deleted it. After that I had nothing strange over taking me, I felt free.\n\nWas this review helpful? YES NO\n\n13 out of 27 found this review helpful"
