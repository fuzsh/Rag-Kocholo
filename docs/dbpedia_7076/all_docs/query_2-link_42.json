This is one of the best psychological horrors we have ever seen. And it is so intense and gripping from the beginning till the end and you should watch it if you haven’t already.\n\n9. Hereditary (2018)\n\nHereditary, which is unbelievably creepy, is one of those films you shouldn't describe in detail because doing so will not only spoil surprises but also leave the reader wondering if you actually saw the movie or if you were just dreaming. The first 90 minutes of the film are filled with a palpable sense of dread, and the final 30 are positively off-the-wall. The Graham family is a cursed clan, both by Biblical bad luck and a genetic propensity towards various types of mental illness. Writer/director Ari Aster structures the story so that it's difficult to know if the strange events you're seeing are real or figments of the Graham family's imaginations.\n\n10. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\nHeather Langenkamp's character, Nancy Thompson, is a typical American child growing up in a nice, middle-class neighbourhood. She is outgoing, a good student, and well-liked. A series of terrifying nightmares—the monstrous stalking by a ferocious cold-blooded killer—quickly shatters her idyllic existence. After looking into the phenomenon, Nancy comes to believe that a sinister family secret may hold the key to solving the mystery, but can she and her boyfriend Glen (Johnny Depp) figure it out before it's too late? The bravery and resourcefulness of one exceptional girl are the subjects of the psychological fantasy/thriller A Nightmare on Elm Street, which tears down the line between reality and dreams. It will make us all pause before turning in for the night and dreaming sweet dreams.\n\n11.

But will their efforts be sufficient to protect them from these ferocious animals? The Abbott family, which consists of mother Evelyn, father Lee, deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau, is going to great lengths to protect one another from the dangerous creatures. They create sand paths, go barefoot, and communicate primarily through sign language. Despite taking safety measures, the difficulties just keep getting worse.\n\n12. Get Out (2017)\n\nYes, racism is frightening. However, Get Out isn't about the blatantly, obviously terrifying type of racism that involves lynchings, burning crosses, and snarling hatred. Instead, it aims to make us feel that horror viscerally and physically by demonstrating how racist behavior that tries to be aggressively unscary is just as horrifying. Get Out transforms casual racism, a subject that is frequently approached cerebrally, into something you feel in your stomach, following in the tradition of the best social thrillers. Additionally, it does so with wicked humor. Get Out's basic premise has been used before: A young black man (Daniel Kaluuya) visits his white girlfriend's parents at their home. From there, you can pretty much fill in the blanks. Except that you can't. Jordan Peele, one half of the renowned comedy team Key and Peele, wrote and directed the film Get Out, which makes the incredibly wise decision to cast this story about racism as a horror movie rather than a drama or comedy.\n\n13. The Shining (1980)\n\nAfter taking a job as an off-season caretaker, Jack Torrance, an aspiring author and former alcoholic, drags his wife Wendy and his talented son Danny up to the snow-capped, remote Overlook Hotel in Colorado. The manager gives Jack a tour of the massive hotel as it closes for the season, and the aged Mr. Hallorann, the facility's chef, has an interesting conversation with Danny about a rare psychic ability called The Shining, making sure to warn him about the hotel's abandoned rooms, especially the off-limits Room 237. But instead of getting out of the depressing creative rut, Jack gradually begins to lose his mind as he is imprisoned in a harsh environment of seemingly never-ending snowstorms and a massive, silent prison filled with bizarre occurrences and unsettling visions. Now, Jack's inner voices are clamouring for sacrifice. Is Jack a murderous person?\n\n14. Abigail (2024)\n\nStarring Alisha Weir, Melissa Barrera, Kathryn Newton, Kevin Durand, and the late Angus Cloud, Abigail revolves around the kidnapping of a 12-year old girl by a group of rookie criminals. They hold her hostage in an isolated mansion for hefty ransom, but they soon discover that the little girl is a bloodthirsty vampire.\n\n15. Late Night with the Devil (2023)\n\nThe supernatural movie Late Night with the Devil stars David Dastmalchian, Laura Gordon, Ian Bliss, Fayssal Bazzi, Ingrid Torelli, Rhys Auteri, Georgina Haig, and Josh Quong Tart. It is about a late-night talk show, Night Owls, where the host, Jack Delroy, invites an allegedly possessed girl named Lilly to boost ratings on Halloween night."
