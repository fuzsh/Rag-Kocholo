        "text": "This article is about the primary Halloween event that is intended for teens and adults. For the daytime festivities of Halloween at the park, see Tricks and Treats Fall Fest .\n\nHalloween Haunt (Also known simply as Haunt, formerly known as FearFest) is a seasonal event that occurs during the late evening of Fridays and Saturdays in late September and all of October and sometimes in early November. at Kings Island. The event is based on the traditions of the Halloween season, with the park being decorated in macabre scenery, and new attractions (mostly haunted mazes) that feature actors portraying various monsters and evil characters that guests will encounter. In some cases, animatronics and other special effects are also used in this event. Each of the attractions exclusive to this event focus on different themes of monsters, such as werewolves, zombies, and cannibals. In addition to the mazes, a large number of attractions are also open during the event.\n\nHistory[]\n\nAs the name suggests, Halloween Haunt is a seasonal event at Kings Island that celebrates the primary traditions of the Halloween season, particularly the concept of macabre settings and themes, touching on one's fears, and the depiction of various monsters popularized in horror media such as zombies, ghosts, and serial killers. The event began as FearFest in 2000, when Paramount owned and operated the park. During this time, Paramount had a heavier focus on intellectual properties, and multiple horror properties. Some of the attractions were based on Paramount's own works, such as Friday the 13th, and Sleepy Hollow were featured, in addition to Cassandra Peterson's Elvira character and Bram Stoker's Dracula, the latter of which was included multiple years due to being in the public domain. The following year after Cedar Fair acquired all of Paramount's parks (including Kings Island) in 2006, the event was renamed to its current name of Halloween Haunt. Since this retheming, the event no longer focuses on notable intellectual properties in the horror genre of various media, though some of the music played during the event has come from films that fit the Halloween season, such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Beetlejuice. Almost all of the haunted houses in the event, especially mainstay attractions that have been around for years like Madame Fatale's Cavern Of Terror, are housed in buildings of former attractions, while others are located in backstage areas.\n\nIn 2019, Kings Island introduced a new feature to the event called Hallow-Tween. This event features altered versions of some of the mazes and scare zones, for guests who might be considered too old for the festivities of Tricks and Treats Fall Fest, but still too young to brave the mazes of Halloween Haunt. The altered mazes primarily removed all scare actors, and replaced them with hosts that gave instructions on how to get through the maze, which were reworked into escape rooms. Interestingly, one of these altered mazes was C.H.A.O.S.: Expedition Orion, which served as a teaser for Orion that opened in the same area the following year in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, Halloween Haunt was cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there was a replacement event called Tricks and Treats Fall Fest, which focused more on the tradition of trick-or-treating usually used in The Great Pumpkin Fest, but with safety protocols such as face mask and social distancing requirements in place to reduce spread of the virus.\n\nSinister Shows[]\n\nMonster Rock(Festhus)\n\nDr Nightmare(International Street Bandstand)\n\nNyteWalkers(International Showplace)\n\nCurrent Houses and Scare Zones[]\n\nNote that although many of the houses may share the same name throughout different years, the layout and features of each maze sometimes changes, with the theme remaining primarily the same.\n\nABANDONED-Located in Rivertown The problem started years ago on the grounds of the newly developed Miami Valley Lumber Company. Men and women, 66 in total, entered the lumber company and were never seen again… at least not the way they used to be. Stepping into Rivertown, outsiders find themselves immersed in a small abandoned lumber village that’s haunted by something mysterious. The forest is overrun by supernatural creatures that have riddled their confines with darkness and despair. Are these the lumber yard workers from days past? And, which of them are evil?\n\nAlien Abyss-Located in a warehouse across from the entrance of Flight of Fear in Area 72. The Department of Alien Research has been secretly cross-breeding two aggressive life forms. Their goal: to develop a biological weapon in the event of future warfare. When civilians are invited to tour the research compound, something goes terribly wrong. The only way to exit the compound is to move forward, but are they being followed? And where are those new life forms?\n\nCornered- Located in the Timberwolf. A corn maze, featuring monsters based on scarecrows and other farm-based characters. A similar maze called Field of Screams was open from (2016-2019), in part of the area where Dinosaurs Alive! once operated. In 2021, Cornered opened in the Same spot Cornstalkers was originally located as basically the same house. In 2022 it moved to Timberwolf!\n\nKill-Mart - Housed in a former arcade building of Coney Mall. This maze is themed to a shopping center that was initially a safe haven from a zombie apocalypse, but has since been overrun by the infected.\n\nSlaughterhouse - This maze was originally featured in the Action Zone in the Chicken Shack restaurant, but it has since been moved to a new building in Rivertown that can be seen year-round from the queue line of The Beast. Slaughterhouse is themed to a butcher shop for animal meat, though the characters portrayed by the actors are heavily implied to also be cannibals. Actors are dressed primarily as meat cooks, with some wearing pig masks, possibly loosely and unofficially inspired by the Saw series of horror films, in addition to the primary concept possibly being loosely based on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\n\nMadame Fatale's Cavern of Terror - Located in the attraction building that formerly housed The Crypt. This maze is themed to a wax museum, where it's implied that the titular owner may have soaked living people in hot wax for her museum's figures.\n\nPumpkin Eater - Scare zone featured in Action Zone. This area is decorated with a large number of pumpkins and jack-o-lanterns, some of which can be seen hanging above guests heads. Dismembered corpses can also be found inside larger pumpkins. A pumpkin monster animatronic hiding behind fake bushes will occasionally make its presence known in this area.\n\nHotel St. Michelle: located in the former action theater. Everyone has heard about the haunting tales of the old Hotel St. Michelle, but are they true? As you sneak into the abandoned hotel, named after the manager's missing daughter, you eerily find the hotel is not abandoned but very alive in spirit!\n\nConey Maul - A frequent tradition of the event involves renaming the Coney Mall area to \"Coney Maul,\" a play on words referring to the act of violently and gruesomely killing something, like a carnivorous animal would. Due to the Coney Mall area always having a carnival theme as the primary area for carnival games and classic carnival rides, the Coney Maul retheme often focuses around a haunted carnival. Several years of the event have featured many scare actors and decorations based on various concepts such as evil clowns, and freak show acts with mutated humans or creatures.\n\nAlien X: When darkness falls, the personnel working inside Area 72 show their true form, and the secrets of Area 72 are revealed. Walk through the displays of Alien creatures who have been contained...well most of them.\n\nInternational Street Fear- A Scare Zone located on International Street.\n\nInternational Street[]\n\nInternational Street is the entrance area of the park. This area is themed to a small town, possibly to imply the beginning of an adventure. Most of this area features restaurants, gift shops, and restrooms, but there are also a few attractions as well:\n\nAttractions:[]\n\nInternational Street Fear- A Scare Zone located on International Street.\n\nEiffel Tower\n\nGrand Carousel\n\nTheaters/Stages:[]\n\nDr Nightmare (international Street Bandstand)(Outdoor)(Located near Eiffel Tower near fountain)\n\nNYTE Walkers(International Showplace)(Outdoor)(Located near Eiffel Tower)\n\nRestaurants:[]\n\nFunnel Cakes (Located On Left Back Side of midway)\n\nAuntie Anne's (Located On Left Back Side of midway)\n\nWishbone Grill (Located On Left Front Side of midway near Starbucks)\n\nStarbucks (Located On Left Front Side of midway)\n\nGrain & Grill (Located On Left Front Side of midway)\n\nTom & Chee (Located to the Right of International Showplace)\n\nFrench Corner (Located On Right Back Side of midway)\n\nGraeter's Ice Cream (Located On Right Front Side of midway)\n\nCinnabon (Located On Right Front Side of midway near LaRosa's Pizzeria)\n\nLaRosa's Pizzeria (Located On Right Front Side of midway)\n\nShops:[]\n\nKI Collections (Located On Left Back Side of Entrance)\n\nCreative Glass (Located On Left Back Side of midway in front of Emporium)\n\nEmporium (Located On Left Back Side of midway)\n\nHomage (Located On Left Back Side of midway)\n\nSweet Spot (Located On Right Back Side of midway)\n\nBuild A Bear Workshop (Located On Right Front Side of midway)\n\nAnimal Fair (Located On Right Front Side of midway)\n\nKings Island Trading Company (Located On Right Front Side of midway)\n\nKI Essentials (Located On Right Side of Entrance)\n\nFunpix(Located on left side)\n\nFast Lane Buying Stand(Located on Left Side)\n\nRestrooms:[]\n\nMen's- (Located to the right of the main entrance next to Kings Island Trading Company)\n\nWomen's- (Located to the right of the main entrance in the same building(when looking at the main entrance from the fountain it is on the left of the building next to KI Essentials))\n\nMen's- (Located on the left side of the entrance in same building before you get in the park)\n\nWomen's- (Located on the left side of the entrance in same building before you get in the park)\n\nLockers[]\n\n(Located near the Front Entrance to the right of the KI Collections)\n\nOktoberfest\n\nAttractions:\n\nViking Fury\n\nShows:\n\nMonster Rock(Festhus(Indoor)(Located near Viking Fury or Delirium)\n\nGames:\n\nGuess Age and Weight(Located next to Festhus near Pond)\n\nResturants:\n\nOktoberfest Bar(Located near Viking Fury)\n\nFesthaus (Panda Express, LaRosa's Pizzeria) (Located across from Viking Fury or Delirium)\n\nRestrooms:\n\nMen(Located in Festhaus)\n\nWomen(Located in Festhaus)\n\nAction Zone[]\n\nAction Zone is home to many of the major thrill rides of the park. Although originally themed to a stunt arena for films under Paramount's ownership, it is now themed around thrill-seeking and adventure, and features many rides to accompany this theme. The site of this area originally opened as Lion Country Safari (later renamed Wild Animal Safari), and featured a monorail attraction where guests could observe various zoo animals. A sub-area named Adventure Village later opened in this spot, before all animal attractions were removed and the Adventure Village name was given to the entire area. The area was again entirely rethemed and renamed to its current iteration of the Paramount Action Zone, featuring rides either based on or named after Paramount films. The film company's name was removed along with several rides being renamed following Cedar Fair's acquisition of the park.\n\nAttractions:[]\n\nBanshee (***No Bags Allowed in Queue***)\n\nFast Lane Available(Enter near Entrance)\n\nThe Bat (Previously known as Flight Deck and Top Gun)\n\nThis Ride is off the path past Banshee and X-Treme Skyflyer\n\nDrop Tower (Previously known as Drop Zone: Stunt Tower)\n\nFast Lane Available(Enter near Entrance)\n\nDelirium\n\nFast Lane Available(Enter near Entrance)\n\nInvertigo (Previously known as Face/Off)\n\nFast Lane Available(Enter near station, under batwing)\n\nXtreme Skyflyer(Pay Per Ride)\n\nCornered- Located in the Timberwolf .

Replaced by C.H.A.O.S. in 2018.\n\nTombstone Terror-Tory - Located at the former entrance of White Water Canyon, with the Kings Island and Miami Valley Railroad used as part of the experience. In this maze, guests would board the aforementioned train with the expectation of going on a peaceful train ride through the woods. Halfway through, actors dressed as Old West bandits would \"hijack\" the train, causing the guests to be let off elsewhere, with the conductor noting that the nearby path was the only way back to the station. Guests would then travel down the maze, with several actors portraying hostile figures and monsters based on the Old West genre of fiction. The maze would conclude at the entrance of White Water Canyon, which was closed due to autumn not being an appropriate season for water rides in the Cincinnati area. After the opening of Mystic Timbers required a new entrance to be built for White Water Canyon, the maze was retired. During Paramount's ownership of the park, this layout was used for a maze themed to Sleepy Hollow, a 1999 Tim Burton film from Paramount that starred Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, which is in turn based on the folklore tale of a similar name by Washington Irving.\n\nCornstalkers - Located in the Tower Gardens. A corn maze, featuring monsters based on scarecrows and other farm-based characters. Closed to make way for Backwoods Bayou. A similar maze called Field of Screams would later open in 2016, in part of the area where Dinosaurs Alive! once operated.

Then in 2022 it was moved to Timberwolf.\n\nCutthroat Cove - Located in the outdoor dining area of what is now Enrique's in Adventure port, across the pond from Viking Fury. This maze was themed to undead pirates, which also had suitable decorations near the pond at the time. The area has not been used for a maze since then, and Cutthroat Cove was not relocated to a new location afterwards.\n\nShipwrecked - Scare zone themed to pirates. Located in Action Zone. Take a stroll through a bustling town full of seafarers, merchants, and scrappy ruffians that rival the ports once visited by Blackbeard himself. It may look innocent on the surface, but inexplicable terror lies beneath - where lost treasure and the song of the siren have put even the strongest, sturdiest pirates in a watery grave. (2019, 2021). Replaced by Pumpkin Eater in 2022.\n\nHoliday Horror - Located in the theater space now occupied by Peanuts Playhouse in Planet Snoopy. The maze featured various holidays such as Christmas and Easter, but each of them have been changed significantly in a manner similar to the events of the film The Nightmare Before Christmas, in which elements of Halloween have invaded each holiday. For instance, friendly characters such as the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus were replaced with far more evil versions of these characters.\n\nSorority House/Delta Delta Die- Located where Coney BBQ is today. This maze was themed to a sorority of killer coeds. Due to the construction of Coney BBQ, it did not re-open for the 2017 season.\n\nBackwoods Bayou - Located in the Tower Gardens to the left of the Eiffel Tower and the Grand Carousel. Themed to a dark and murky swamp in which several creatures are lurking in wait for prey.

Replaced by Cornered in 2021, then now the area holds the Ride Cemetery.\n\nWolf Pack - Located in the Action Zone section of the park near The Bat, and housed in the former loading station of Son of Beast. The queue and exit for this attraction also used that of Son of Beast. This maze focused on guests attempting to trek through a dark forest where werewolves are said to lurk.(last ran in 2019).\n\nBlackout - Located in a warehouse near the entrance of The Bat, the latter of which had alterations made to its queue line to allow line space for the maze. Blackout is themed to the fear of the dark and claustrophobia. As the name suggests, much of this maze takes place in the dark, with little to no lighting. Attraction descriptions never make it clear what kind of monsters are featured in this maze.(last ran in 2019).\n\nDance of the Macabre - Scare zone located underneath the Eiffel Tower. This scare zone is themed to the French Revolution, and featured scare actors dressed in elegant old time clothing that has been damaged in some form, and with noticeable wounds primarily on their face. The scare zone featured a photo-op station based on old-time painted portraits, a banquet table overrun with rats, and torsos impaled on spiked poles.(last ran in 2019).\n\nRivertown Reaping - Set in the area of the same name. Unlike most scare zones, this area did not have a large focus on new scenery that's exclusive to the event, and instead just uses scare actors themed to the old time theme of Rivertown. Open in 2019-2019. Replaced by Abandoned in 2023.\n\nZombie Mall - Scare zone themed to zombies. Located in back of Coney Mall near Kings Mills Antique Autos. The sale of a lifetime is happening now at this one-of-a-kind outdoor market, and everything must go!

Open 2019-2019.\n\nUrgent Scare - Housed in Coney Mall behind Windseeker, in the building that formerly housed the Action Theater motion simuator theaters. This maze is set inside a hospital where a zombie outbreak has gotten out of control. Actors primarily portrayed infected staff and patients, in addition to mannequins depicting brutally dismembered patients who were attacked by zombies. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, this Maze was removed before the 2021 season(last ran in 2019).
