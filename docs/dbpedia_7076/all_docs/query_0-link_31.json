        "text": "When I was nine years old, I saw a movie on television that would have an unpredictably lasting effect on my life. That film was The Haunted – a made for TV movie about a family who suffered the effects of a demonic infestation in their house. I had a friend over and we were eating pizza when we saw a commercial for the movie, which announced that it would be starting in just a few minutes. We decided to ditch our plans of watching TGIF reruns and watch this instead. Our parents were out and we had been left to our own devices, so what better way to spend a Friday night than by watching a movie that most certainly would have been off limits if the parents had known anything about it?\n\nThe movie tells the purportedly true story of Jack and Janet Smurl and their family. In the late 1970s, they move into a duplex in West Pittston, Pennsylvania with Jack, Janet and their children occupying one side, and Jack’s elderly parents occupying the other. They experience a few strange occurrences surrounding the move – tools and other items suddenly going missing, hearing family members call out for one another, only to realize that the person speaking was nowhere nearby. But eventually, that calms down and the family is able to enjoy life in their new home. A few years later, the occurrences start up again, but this time, they are impossible to ignore. Janet hears knocks in the walls and whispering when she is alone in the house, a chandelier falls and almost kills one of the children and both Jack and Janet experience the physical sensation of a presence touching them. When the Catholic Church is no help, they reach out to noted demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (Stephen Markle and Diane Baker), who would later be the focal point of James Wan’s The Conjuring series.\n\nThis movie scared the living hell out of me. My parents were pretty strict with what I watched, so I hadn’t had a lot of exposure to horror, and this was the most intense thing I had seen to date. There is a particular scene that has stuck in my mind ever since – Janet is alone in the living room and she sees the demon manifest itself as a dark, billowy shadow. It is faceless and formless, but you get the distinct impression that it is watching her. Regarding her. After a few moments, it crosses the room and disappears when it reaches the wall. That scene terrified me. In my young mind, ghosts wore sheets or maybe were transparent versions of the people they had been in life. This was something completely otherworldly. I remember lying awake in the nights following the viewing, staring through my open bedroom door and into the well-lit hallway, where I was certain I would eventually see the shadowy figure appear.\n\nAs impactful as this movie was, it wasn’t something that I could easily revisit as I got older. Made for television movies are a corner of horror that is not as readily available as theatrical films, especially when they came from the era before streaming video. I remember scouring our local video store to see if I could find it on VHS, but had no luck. Shudder recently added The Haunted to their always stellar list of offerings, and I immediately took the opportunity to revisit it. I was immediately transported back to my family’s living room, experiencing the first scares of what would become a lifelong love affair with horror cinema and ghost stories.\n\nI am thrilled to report that The Haunted really holds up. Sure, it might not be on same level of intensity as modern horror, but it can still hold its own. Like any good haunting story, pacing is important, and here, director Robert Mandel makes good use of the slow increase in ghostly activity in order to set the stage and hook the audience. It flows smoothly, is carried well by the cast (led by Sally Kirkland and Jeffrey DeMunn), and has some legitimately creepy elements. The scene that frightened me as a child remains one of the most impactful moments in the film. The effects are simple, but surprisingly effective. Every shadow stands out, every whisper can be heard and the sound design brings some well-timed bass hits that really give the scary moments an unearthly quality. It’s one that I would definitely recommend – particularly if you are a fan of The Conjuring films. It offers another ghost story based on the work of the Warrens, and it is one that has not yet been covered in James Wan’s universe.\n\nIn fact, looking back on it, The Haunted had a much bigger impact than just a few sleepless nights. It was the first time of many that my path would intersect with stories of Warrens. Several years later, I was in the library and I saw the book by Robert Curran that this movie had been adapted from. I checked it out and took it home (to this day I still can’t understand why my dad, a staunch Catholic and hater of anything horror-related) let me do that. But I was able to reacquaint myself with the terrors of the Smurl Haunting and the work of Ed and Lorraine. When I was in college, I caught an episode of A Haunting on the Discovery channel that focused on another of the Warren’s cases, known as “A Haunting in Connecticut” (not the 2009 movie, but based on the same story). Years later, James Wan announced that he was developing The Conjuring, a movie that would be based on one of the case files of the Warrens. As we all know, the film was a massive success and went on to spawn sequels, spin-offs and a new universe of horror stories.\n\nI find it fascinating that Ed and Lorraine Warren have been a part of the modern horror scene for so long. Their cases had been a part of the landscape long before Wan developed his film series, and will no doubt continue to be a part of it for years to come. Whether you believe in the history of these events or not, it’s clear that these stories have made an impact. They have inspired a number of filmmakers and storytellers, and their cases have been responsible for keeping countless horror fans terrified and hiding under their covers at night – in 1991 and in 2019.\n\nHurricanes are frightening all on on their own without having to involve a predatory animal. Yet Carlos Brooks’ Burning Bright not only features a Category 3 hurricane, a ferocious tiger is thrown in for added effect. Back when this film was first announced, its plot was met with laughter and doubt; the idea was as intriguing as it was ridiculous. Over time though, this suspenseful story of a girl, a boy, and a tiger has become a shining example of how to follow through on a high concept.\n\nTwo distinct yet equally uncontrollable forces are on display at the beginning of Burning Bright. As Hurricane Isabel builds a sense of foreboding in the background, a young woman finally confronts her family situation. The collegebound Kelly (Briana Evigan, Sorority Row) is making the difficult decision of leaving behind her autistic brother Tom (Charlie Tahan, Super Dark Times) when life catches her off guard again. Kelly’s plans are dashed after her late mother’s husband Johnny (Garret Dillahunt, Last House on the Left) steals the money intended for Tom’s new care. And for what? A wildlife ranch with the centerpiece being, of course, a former circus tiger deemed more evil than scary by Meat Loaf. The musician’s fulsome cameo feels nearly out of place in this film, but the character is a forceful reminder not to take the tiger lightly, even when the plot comes across as absurd.\n\nThere is no organic way to have a tiger present in this story, seeing as these creatures are exotic to most people. They don’t belong in, much less originate in a place like Florida. So there needs to be a bridge of some kind that brings these disparate elements together. And after assuming Johnny’s latest purchase would simply escape his enclosure and enter Kelly’s house, Burning Bright thinks outside the box even further by revealing the tiger was released. This plot development is both so nutty and so fiendish it sounds like something drummed up by EC Comics.\n\nThe film neither has nor needs time to ponder the whys and whats of the characters’ sudden predicament; like Kelly and Tom, Burning Bright is in survival mode. The director is instead too busy finding efficient ways to keep the momentum up and the audience engaged. Those forty-something minutes of a (big) cat and mouse game could have quickly gone south in less capable hands, but Brooks manages to avoid the worst possible outcome in these kinds of conceptual stories. That is, boring the audience by either desensitizing them to the threat or animal, or just being too repetitive.\n\nUnlike Alexandre Aja’s somewhat similar natural-horror film Crawl — the ’80s snake thriller Fair Game is an even closer match — Burning Bright doesn’t have the luxury of a dynamic venue (among other things). Kelly and Tom are very much sentenced to their home after it was sealed up with them inside. So there is a fair deal of the characters going around in circles here and revisiting the same parts of the house. In turn though, that story tightness becomes more and more intense as well as detectable on screen. The camera gets almost uncomfortably close and fixed on the actors’ faces, in particular when their rawest emotions are coming out in some form or another.\n\nEscaping the tiger would be easier than this film’s symbolism. Perhaps taking a page out of The Descent and other films like it, Burning Bright uses a deadly creature — albeit a non-fantastical one — to contextualize a personal dilemma. What’s missing is nuance, on account of the straightforward approach. There is no mistaking what is being communicated here as Kelly fights for hers and Tom’s life. That level of simple storytelling could maybe minimize the film’s impact, however, the uncomplicated route works well in this case. An allegory being precise is preferable to a poor one.\n\nBurning Bright would not be anywhere as effective without its leads. Charlie Tahan tends to be overlooked due to Tom being nonverbal, yet for his age, he turned in an impressive performance that is never ostentatious. Then there is Briana Evigan, a familiar face of 2000s horror, who is owed some credit for her character’s lasting impression. She requested the filmmakers give Kelly a personality touch-up so she would be more likable: “If you didn’t care about [her], why would you care if she survived?” And the work put into the protagonist pays off well. Yes, there is little delay before Burning Bright throws the brother and sister into the tiger pit that is now their home. However, it’s important to remember that Christine Coyle Johnson and Julie Prendiville Roux’s script doesn’t sacrifice character for action once the tiger shows up; the sibling relationship is always being explored. Every scene — especially ones with the tiger — deepens the personal story at the heart of the film, and paves the way for a rewarding and cathartic ending.\n\nThis isn’t a subtle film. Far from it. No, Burning Bright lays it on rather thick with traps both literal and metaphorical, which, by virtue of solid direction and performances, culminate into a worthwhile story of resilience. Apropos of thematic complexity, the film is still a far ways off from its namesake — William Blake’s poem The Tyger — but there are poetic moments here and there.\n\nHorror contemplates in great detail how young people handle inordinate situations and all of life’s unexpected challenges. While the genre forces characters of every age to face their fears, it is especially interested in how youths might fare in life-or-death scenarios.\n\nThe column Young Blood is dedicated to horror stories for and about teenagers, as well as other young folks on the brink of terror."
