        "text": "Nell Bowen, the protégé of Lord Mortimer, wants to help change the conditions of notorious St. Mary's of Bethlehem Asylum (Bedlam). Though she tries to reform Bedlam, the cruel Master Sims who runs it has her committed there, but ultimately, it's the lunatics who've taken over the asylum.\n\nMad doctor uses patients at his isolated psychiatric institute as subjects in his attempts to create longevity by surgically installing an artificial gland in their skulls, with disastrous results.\n\nA young woman is plagued by nightmares of her asylum-patient mother. Upon returning to her family home, the nightmares become real when she sees a strange woman pacing the halls.\n\nTeenage Susan Shelley is released from an asylum where she's been confined after the shock she suffered from her glamorous socialite mother Jessica's fiery death. Her father has a new wife, who has only married him for the money Jessica left him. Susan is still haunted by her mother's memory, and her stepmother is conspiring with her lover, Maxwell Reed, to trick the troubled girl into leading them to Jessica's missing diamond necklace.\n\nAfter escaping from an insane asylum, a medical student assumes the identity of a mysterious dead man, who appeared to be his doppelganger, and gets lured to a sinister island ruled by a mad scientist and his malformed men.\n\nOn her way home to California from a stay at a Swiss mental institution after a traumatic rape seven years earlier, twenty-year-old Susan Wilcox realizes that someone is deliberately trying to drive her insane. Written by Jimmy Sangster.\n\nA young woman is brought to an asylum to receive special treatment from a mysterious doctor. Dr. Spector does more than just run the hospital -- he offers his patients as sacrifices to Satan.\n\nThe owner of a roadside diner and his new waitress kill people and feed them to a pen of 12 pigs.\n\nA young psychiatric nurse goes to work at a remote asylum following a murder. There, she experiences varying degrees of torment from the patients.\n\nA nymphomaniac goes to a sanitarium in hopes of being cured; it turns out the sanitarium is a front for a Satanic cult luring young women into a web of madness, torture, and sex... But mostly just sex.\n\nThree inmates in an asylum tell their stories. Story 1, a husband and wife discover they should be careful what they wish for. Story 2, a naked female ghost gets revenge from her watery grave. Story 3, a dead prostitute returns as a ghost.\n\nYears after being traumatized by witnessing the drowning deaths of her beloved father and stepmother as a child, a wealthy young woman is released from a sanitarium and returns to the remote country estate where she grew up. Shortly afterwards, her psychiatrist, her estranged, greedy brother, and his beautiful but immoral fiance converge on the estate and a series of grisly murders begins.\n\nAn ex-marine psychiatrist attempts to rehabilitate his patients by indulging their fantasies, and seeks to prove the existence of a loving God to one especially troubled inmate.\n\nA disturbed telepathic man is unable to fully control his ability to transmit his dreams and visions into the minds of the people around him, or even influence reality. A female therapist tries to help him, but his mother gets in the way.\n\nA horribly disfigured lawyer, wrongfully pronounced dead after a terrible car accident, is taken to an asylum for dissection, only to come back alive, kill everyone, and make the asylum his killing grounds."
