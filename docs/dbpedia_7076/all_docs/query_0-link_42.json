One night, the topic of ghost tours came up. It turned out that all of us make it a point to seek them out while we’re on vacation, which led us to wonder why ghost tours aren’t offered in one of the most beautiful and haunted vacation destinations in America, Block Island.\n\nBy telling the stories of our ancestors we create exciting experiences which focus on the haunted history of Block Island with an eye on historical accuracy. We provide spooky fun for earthly beings of all ages."
