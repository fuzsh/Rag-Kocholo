        "text": "If your idea of a perfect horror movie is a tense, psychological thriller, then we suggest you stop reading, because we're here to discuss the scariest, goriest, most in-your-face horror movies currently streaming on Netflix. From blood-soaked slashers to horror anthology movies that might scar you for life, we combed through all the scary movies Netflix has to offer to unearth the best and the bloodiest, and we've come out with some good picks.\n\nMaybe you're in the mood for a gruesome murder tale like the one you'll find in \"1922,\" which is about a farmer who convinces his son to murder his mother. Maybe a more comical horror story like \"The Babysitter\" with lots of bloody scenes that'll (surprisingly) make you laugh is more up your alley. Or maybe monsters are more your style — there's the demon-haunted \"Death Note,\" which stars Nat Wolff as a boy who finds a notebook that kills anyone whose name is printed in it — or if zombies are your thing, then \"Dawn of the Dead\" is always a great and graphic choice.\n\nNo matter what kind of bloody horror you're in the mood for, we have everything you need for a fright fest at home, right here.\n\n— Additional reporting by Haley Lyndes and Lauren Harano\n\n01\n\n\"1922\"\n\nWhat you're in for: This tense, disturbing Stephen King adaptation sees Thomas Jane playing a backwoods farmer who convinces his son (Dylan Schmid) to help murder his own mother (Molly Parker) in 1922. Unfortunately their choice continues to haunt them, long after she's gone.\n\nNotable gore: If you're scared of rats, do not watch this movie.\n\nWatch \"1922\" on Netflix.\n\n02\n\n\"The Babysitter\"\n\nWhat you're in for: To be totally honest, we find this movie starring Samara Weaving as a killer babysitter pretty funny and heartfelt. But that doesn't stop the McG-directed horror comedy from being drenched in blood as Weaving's pals get rightfully picked off by a clever kid.\n\nNotable gore: Imagine if the elaborate pranks Kevin sets for the robbers in \"Home Alone\" were actually deadly, and then you'll get a good idea of all the ways young Cole (Judah Lewis) takes out his captors.\n\nWatch \"The Babysitter\" on Netflix.\n\n03\n\n\"Ravenous\"\n\nWhat you're in for: This is actually a pretty introspective and beautiful movie, as far as films in the zombie genre go. That being said, watching a small group of desperate survivors attempt to navigate the aftermath of a zombie-like outbreak in rural Quebec is going to come with some nauseating moments.\n\nNotable gore: It's a zombie movie, so prepare for free-flowing intestines and blood.\n\nWatch \"Ravenous\" on Netflix.\n\n07\n\n\"I Am Mother\"\n\nWhat to expect: Starring Hilary Swank and Rose Byrne, this sci-fi thriller tells the story of a teenage girl raised by a robot designed to repopulate the Earth, but an unexpected encounter with a gravely wounded human woman forces the teen to question everything she was told by her robot mother about the outside world.\n\nNotable gore: A woman stumbles into a bunker with a bleeding gunshot wound, the robot mother gets shot at with a gun, and more.\n\nWatch \"I Am Mother\" on Netflix.\n\n08\n\n\"Malevolent\"\n\nWhat to expect: This paranormal thriller is centered on a brother/sister con-artist team, Jackson and Angela, who run a lucrative (and fake) \"ghostbusting\" business but encounter very real spirits on their latest job.\n\nNotable gore: If the idea of characters getting tied to chairs with their mouths sewn up, chopped with a machete, and then hit in the head with a shovel freaks you out, this isn't the movie for you.\n\nWatch \"Malevolent\" on Netflix.\n\n09\n\n\"May the Devil Take You\"\n\nWhat to expect: This Indonesian horror flick tells the story of a young woman who, upon learning about her estranged father's mysterious illness, returns with her stepsister to her family's old villa to uncover the secrets of her family's demonic past.\n\nNotable gore: Blood runs and drools out of mouths as these characters endure some pretty nasty violence.\n\nWatch \"May the Devil Take You\" on Netflix.\n\n10\n\n\"Gerald's Game\"\n\nWhat to expect: Yup, it's another Stephen King adaptation! In \"Gerald's Game,\" a couple spice up their love life at a remote lake house, and the wife (Carla Gugino) confronts her inner demons about past abuses.\n\nNotable gore: A feral dog chewing on a corpse, an apparition of a zombie-like giant, and much more.\n\nWatch \"Gerald's Game\" on Netflix.\n\n11\n\n\"In the Tall Grass\"\n\nWhat to expect: Based on the Joe Hill and Stephen King novella, \"In the Tall Grass\" follows a group of people who enter a twisted field of grass. Soon, the powers and secrets of the grass slowly drive them insane as they lose all understanding of time and space.\n\nNotable gore: There's definitely a few gruesome deaths, like a woman's skull being pressed together.\n\nWatch \"In the Tall Grass\" on Netflix.\n\n12\n\n\"The 8th Night\"\n\nWhat to expect: This mystery horror film, written and directed by Kim Tae-hyoung, follows an architect who discovers and reawakens an ancient demon. A monk with supernatural abilities then steps up to the plate to fight the primordial evil.\n\nNotable gore: Definitely a lot of axe murdering.\n\nWatch \"The 8th Night\" on Netflix.\n\n13\n\n\"Blood Red Sky\"\n\nWhat to expect: \"Blood Red Sky\" is a German horror thriller where all the action takes place on an airplane. What derails this seemingly normal flight? Some of the passengers are vampires.\n\nNotable gore: Prepare for blood and guts.\n\nWatch \"Blood Red Sky\" on Netflix.\n\n14\n\n\"Day Shift\"\n\nWhat to expect: \"Day Shift\" stars Jamie Foxx as a vampire hunter with a lot on his plate. Dave Franco joins him as his union supervisor.\n\nNotable gore: Vampires get stabbed, shot, and even decapitated.\n\nWatch \"Day Shift\" on Netflix.\n\n15\n\n\"Rattlesnake\"\n\nWhat to expect: Morality gets foggy in this thriller starring Carmen Ejogo as Katrina, a single mother whose daughter Clara (Apollina Pratt) gets bitten by a venomous rattlesnake. Desperate to save her, Katrina accepts the help of a mysterious woman in the desert, but her miraculous healing powers come with a price: Katrina must kill a stranger to repay the debt, or else Clara will die by sundown. Theo Rossi and Emma Greenwell costar.\n\nNotable gore: Gunshots, knives, a rock to the head: this movie is filled with tons of gore.\n\nWatch \"Rattlesnake\" on Netflix.\n\n16\n\n\"Open House\"\n\nWhat to expect: Starring \"13 Reasons Why\"'s Dylan Minnette, this (admittedly terrible but still entertaining) thriller follows a teenager and his mother as they settle into a new home, only to find themselves troubled by their elderly yet eerily eccentric new neighbor.\n\nNotable gore: The main character's dad gets hit by a car . . . which, as you can imagine, isn't pretty.\n\nWatch \"Open House\" on Netflix.\n\n17\n\n\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"\n\nWhat you're in for: This modern-day sequel to the original 1974 film sees the infamous Leatherface resurface after nearly 50 years of hiding, starting up his killing spree with a new group who accidentally disrupt his carefully shielded world. The serial killer's murderous legacy is awakened once again, but this time, one of his original survivors is determined to seek revenge.\n\nNotable gore: The title says it all, but expect a lot of murders by chainsaw.\n\nWatch \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" on Netflix.\n\n18\n\n\"Apostle\"\n\nWhat you're in for: This period horror film — which features \"Downton Abbey\"'s Dan Stevens and \"Sierra Burgess Is a Loser\"'s Kristine Froseth — tells the story of a man who must travel to a remote island to rescue his sister after she's held for ransom by a religious cult.\n\nNotable gory: Kidnapping someone for ransom, stabbing, death, and much more.\n\nWatch \"Apostle\" on Netflix.\n\n19\n\n\"The Ritual\"\n\nWhat you're in for: Here we have one of the rare cases in which there's a horrifying monster and they show it in all its glory. And let me tell you, it's truly a sight to see. It all tumbles into one rather haunting tale.\n\nNotable gore: Very bloody deaths, plus human sacrifice and a ritual killing.\n\nWatch \"The Ritual\" on Netflix.\n\n20\n\n\"The Babysitter: Killer Queen\"\n\nWhat you're in for: Two years ago, a boy defeated a demonic cult led by his babysitter, but to this day, no one believes him, even though the babysitter and her friends have all vanished. When he accepts an invitation from his crush to a Halloween lake party, he discovers that old evil isn't quite so dead after all.\n\nNotable gore: Expect lots of blood from weapons like flamethrowers, hacksaws, and even a high-heeled shoe.\n\nWatch \"The Babysitter: Killer Queen\" on Netflix.\n\n21\n\n\"Death Note\"\n\nWhat to expect: Loosely based on the Japanese manga of the same name by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, this supernatural thriller stars Nat Wolff as Light Turner, a high schooler who discovers a mysterious leather-bound notebook that has the power to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. He and his girlfriend (played by Margaret Qualley) team up to eliminate all criminals, while an eccentric detective (played by LaKeith Stanfield) attempts to stop them.\n\nNotable gore: Fist fights, decapitation, as well as the frequent presence of a \"demon god\" that you don't want to mess around with.\n\nWatch \"Death Note\" on Netflix.\n\n22\n\n\"The Platform\"\n\nWhat to expect: \"The Platform\" is about a dystopia where people are trapped in a prison, each room stacked on top of each other. Every day, a platform full of food makes its way from the top to the bottom, and if the people on top eat too much, there's nothing for those on the bottom. The movie follows one prisoner who wants to make it out alive.\n\nNotable gore: There's a lot of cannibalism.\n\nWatch \"The Platform\" on Netflix."
