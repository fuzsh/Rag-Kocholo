        "text": "On her YouTube channel, Sreelekha said the industry at one point of time was run by only Prosenjit whose onscreen love interest was always Rituparna Sengupta.\n\n\"Bumba da used to control the industry. All filmmakers used to pacify him. Rituparna used to come late on the shooting floor day after day, but all used to wait for her. While Rituparna was selected for all films, we used to prove our punctuality,\" she said in a direct attack on once-a-popular onscreen pair Prosenjit-Rituparna.\n\nProsenjit has not yet reacted to the allegations levelled by Sreelekha.\n\nFurther in the video, which went viral on social media, Sreelekha recounted her experience during the shooting of Bengali film 'Sagar Banya' when she had met with an accident.\n\nShe alleged Prosenjit didn't even pay a courtesy visit to her while she was admitted to a hospital.\n\n\"We were going to Digha for the shooting of the film 'Sagar Banya'. Prosenjit Chatterjee and Indrani Haldar were there in the film. We had met with an accident. I was admitted to a hospital in Digha. The director had come to meet me in the hospital. But Prosenjit Chatterjee didn't come,\" she said.\n\nSreelekha has also alleged that she was dumped from a film as Prosenjit had felt she \"would not earn money for the film\".\n\nHowever, the actor claimed she was inducted to the film later.\n\nReacting to the explosive video, Rituparna told a news channel that she was hurt by Sreelekha's comment and added that she had not acted with Prosenjit from 2001 to 2015.\n\nActor Swastika Mukherjee wrote a long post on Facebook to counter Sreelekha's allegations \"logically\". She questioned why only female actors were accused of compromising for a role in films but not the male ones.\n\nFollowing the suicide of Sushant last Sunday, netizens as well as Bollywood personalities including Kangana Rananut, Abhinav Kashyap called out filmmaker Karan Johar, actors Alia Bhatt, Salman Khan for indulging \"favouritism\", \"nepotism\" and maintaining a control in the film industry.\n\nThe social media was stormed with posts calling for a boycott of films made by the \"nepotism-supporter\" filmmakers or actors."
