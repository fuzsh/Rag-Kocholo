So, why think too much about his death. Life is short, so live it while you still breathe. Let’s celebrate the way he lived his life. We have so much negativity surrounding us. Every day we wake up in the morning to see death news. He was not only an accomplished artist, but he was also a very lively person. Let’s honour him by celebrating life. We already have enough to be sad. So, I would say we all have to be positive in life,” Sreelekha shared with ETimes adding that she doesn’t believe in showing fake emotions and using emojis bluntly on social media.",
