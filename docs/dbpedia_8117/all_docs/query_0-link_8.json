        "meta_description": "Nowadays many songs on Instagram become a blockbuster overnight that touch the hearts of the people and go viral. And one such song is 'Manike Mage Hithe'. Interestingly it’s not a Bollywood song and has been literally going viral for quite a few months as millions  of users have taken to the beats of this song to groove on and create videos. Now, the latest celebrity to join the list is Bengali actress Sreelekha Mitra who has taken to her Instagram handle to share a video of her dancing on this lovely song. In the video, Sreelekha is seen wearing a red and black churidar kameez looking absolutely lovely. While posting the adorable video Sreelekha captioned the video as ‘Jai kotha kintu rakhlam!’, which means 'I have kept my words'. As soon as the video hit cyberspace, fans showered all their love on the actress and wrote beautiful comments. One user wrote, ‘So graceful!!! Such elegance and superfluous enigmatic!’ while another commented, ‘Sexiest woman on earth’. Many users have showered their love for her and most of the comments are in Bengali or in the regional languages, but the thing which can be made out easily is the love netizens have for her. Sri Lankan singer Yohani Diloka De Silva's viral song Manike Mage Hithe has not just been recreated multiple times on various social media platforms but also received much love from many Bollywood celebrities as well. Due to her rising popularity, Yohani was also invited on Bigg Boss 15 in one of the weekend episodes where she shared the stage with host Salman Khan and even sang with him. Yohani will be making her Bollywood debut with the film 'Thank God', featuring Ajay Devgn, Sidharth Malhotra and Rakul Preet Singh. As per a statement, Yohani will sing the Hindi version of the hit track.",
