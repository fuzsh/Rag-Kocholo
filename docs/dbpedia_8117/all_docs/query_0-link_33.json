        "text": "Birdman is an ascent (and I have intentionally stayed away from descent) to madness. It is refreshing for viewers like moi who prefer heavy on dialogues and layered storylines. Let me set the expectations, this film is not for everyone and some of you may even find this pretentious crap. But those who have internalized the existential crisis where life imitates art and art imitates life will find this worthwhile.\n\nI admire Iñárritu’s work. Right from Amores Perros, 21 grams, Babel followed by Biutiful, he has never disappointed me. Will this move him in the Scorsese, Eastwood league? Iñárritu’s “Birdman” is a celebration of cinema. It’s an audacious achievement that where he (over)familiarizes us with the theater stage and backstage. He makes the surroundings a living, breathing character for us to know, understand and enjoy.\n\nA satire on showbiz, it is the story of an aging, washed up actor Riggan Thomspon (Micheal Keaton who has given his all in this role), well known decades back for playing a superhero. Riggan’s fault is he’s deeply ashamed of ‘selling out’ years earlier when he took on his superhero role and he wants to redeem himself by attempting to mount a ‘serious’ Broadway play. Riggan hopes to reinvent his career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver’s short story “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love“. But his Birdman persona, a shadowy figure from his past, keeps appearing in the form of a disembodied voice and later hallucinations, goading him into believing that he will fail.\n\nThere are a host of characters surrounding Riggan. His manager cum producer cum friend who is hassled enough to dangle impossible carrots to make the show work (Zach Galifinakis) , his ex-wife (Amy Ryan) who still cares in spite of the threatening with knife episode, an estranged daughter (Emma Stone) who pulls a credible ‘I am fucked up’ routine but is the most sane voice in the film and of course the other actors in Riggan’s (Edward Norton, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough)play.\n\nWhile the film on one hand is a like a commentary on Keaton’s own history in Batsuit, the real story is focused on personal matters; artistic temperament, troubled relationships, integrity, fragility of the term success, Hollywood vis a vis Broadway and of course how one defines and talks about love.\n\nA truth and dare game does its round at some point between two of the main characters. And it suddenly hits you that this rather teenager-ish game can have such deep revelations if played with all honesty. There are insecure actresses who appear selfish but at one weak moment when they crack you can see the little girl they were once. There is a method actor, very good at his job, generally being too confident who when asked in a cramped smoker’s zone, “how does it feel to pretend to be someone else in front of an audience every night?” answers without blinking that “I pretend everywhere else BUT not on stage”. There are various such deep moments which makes you stop and ponder.\n\nYou see, everything in this movie happens inside the theatre where it is shot. People scream at each other, realize they are not suited for each other, make love in cramped alleys, discuss how terrible they would be as parents while doing their make-up, trying on costumes and rehearsing their parts.\n\nThe entire film is shot as if it’s one long take in a cinema verité style. Perhaps the best thing about the film is the behind-the-scenes peek at the technical aspects of a Broadway theater production. Emmanuel Lubezki, take a bow. You can’t watch a movie shot by the Academy Award winning Cinematographer and not find yourself drawn intimately to the realm of movies. A year after stunning us with “Gravity”, Lubezki, takes the audience inside the movie where they are present in every scene, every movement, and every thought that a person is having. We feel as though Riggan and the cast are interacting with us. When they’re laugh, we laugh, when they cry, we cry. Lubezki used the Alexa M for hand held sequences thus allowing h the camera to get into tiny spaces and close to the actor, sometimes 2 inches from the actor’s face.\n\nI personally adore Zach Galifinakis in the man-child roles he has played but yes he has so much more to offer as an actor. Edward Norton and Emma Stone have delivered stellar performances. But above all Birdman (forget the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is about a father, actor, husband, lover who is NOT superhero; just a regular guy with his flaws and madness.\n\nAnd yes, how different people aspire, define and accept love when they talk about Love.\n\nIs it possible to fall in love with a man 12 years after his death? Or to be more particular with one of the character he played onscreen while alive? Am not referring to the heart beats faster, must buy expensive Valentine’s Day gift, type, but where the deep admiration of his genius slowly wraps itself around you like a comfortable and favourite from the memories woven into it, patchwork blanket?\n\nI chanced upon Inspector Morse, 2 months back, while navigating the array of free goodies YouTube offers. Must be providence; I actually clicked on ‘Dead of Jericho” – the first of 33 episodes of the splendid Inspector Morse series that was broadcast in 1987 in the UK. And 27 years later as I sat through the nearly two hour episode, I realized what I have missed all these years.\n\nMy entire teenage and 20s were spent on a staple diet of American TV shows with crime series (but obviously) on top of priority list. Once upon a time, I was the most ardent Remington Steele fan. Most of those series involved fast cars, cocky cops/ detectives, everyone in the cast had near perfect physique and extra white teeth, numerous racy car chases to add to the ‘thrill’ factor and some canned humour thrown in at the right moment.\n\nWhy and how did Morse – the grumpy, graying man with an old fashioned view of women and pedantic about grammar, get so close to my heart? I guess versatile, talented actors can do that to you; after all therein lies the headiness that art forms provide. Or maybe deep down, I do have a father figure obsession; shrink and close friends have always said so, I have diligently ignored. A picnic date by the river side, basking in the winter sun reading out favourite quotes to each other seems so much more attractive a proposition that hanging out with the regular hunks.\n\nMorse grew on me like good wines do in a blind tasting session. You are a little skeptical at first; after all you know nothing about the liquid being poured out from the black glass, but as you put aside your mind block and soak in the aroma and relish the after taste, you realize THIS is it!\n\nMorse is one of those whose idiosyncrasies make you smirk inwardly when you initially meet them, but over a period you start finding comfort in those same quirks; you actually start relating to some of them.\n\nSlightly balding and cerebral, Morse is a senior CID officer with the Thames Valley Police force in Oxford who famously drives a bright red Jaguar, has a thing for crossword puzzles and likes ‘real’ British ale; he completely sniggers if offered canned beer! Morse also has ‘highbrow’ passions – music (especially opera; Mozart and Wagner which he often listens in his car audio or Roksan Xerxes record player), poetry, art, classics and Shakespeare. He appreciates real ink (the nostalgia junkie in me is highly impressed) and often makes his sidekick Lewis pay for the beer while investigating a case.\n\nIn fact, many of his cases touch on Morse’s interests and it is his deep knowledge on certain subjects that helps solve them. He understands the importance of the rule of law and justice, the interests of which he always puts ahead of gain or personal advancement. Sometimes he openly sneers at his boss (I mean we all have done that once in a while) but respects him in his own way. He is said to have graduated from Oxford and can be considered rather laid back. He ignores forensic science throughout the series (imagine what would Kay Scarpetta think!) and cannot stand the sight of blood. I have never met an onscreen detective who is so against the stereotype!\n\n************\n\nThe series,beautifully filmed in and around photogenic Oxford, has intelligent scripts and are based on a series of award-winning novels by Colin Dexter as well as some original television stories. The episodes are has complex plots, (the studio did hire good writers and screen players) has sufficient suspects and red herrings and deals with themes in the way good literature always has. And yes, the support case, each and every one does a brilliant job.\n\nFew television series can truthfully be called a phenomenon. Morse can.\n\nSome actors remain etched forever because of that one role which defines them. In case of John Thaw his greatest was being Chief Inspector Morse. He played the role with aplomb from 1987 – 2000. The character died from a heart attack in, The Remorseful Day, published in 1999. He died on-screen in 2000. Thaw died two years later. Plain co- incidence I suppose?\n\nWhen first approached to play Morse, Thaw read one of Colin Dexter’s novels and decided he didn’t like the man much. But then he began to realize there were some subtle things that really appealed to him, especially Morse’s love of classical music and opera. “I love music,” said Thaw, “and I listen to it the way Morse does. It helps me to think, to learn my lines. I thought that was a pretty good indication of what kind of guy he was. That was the key for me”, as he stated in an interview.\n\nThaw had a special appreciation (and so did I) of the fact that Morse was different from classic detectives such as Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes. Morse, though above average brilliant, was not always right. He sometimes arrested the wrong person or came to the wrong conclusion. As a result, unlike classic sleuths, Morse does not always simply arrest his culprit; ironic circumstances have the case end and the crime brought to him. Morse, though not capable of a steady relationship, was a romantic at heart; he did mildly flirt with colleagues, witnesses or suspects—occasionally bordering on the unprofessional, but had little success in finding true love.\n\nAnd his voice; there is something deeply resonating about his voice. Not the Amitabhish rich baritone but his voice is indeed fantastic and Thaw was capable of taking the stories to another level with it.\n\nAuthor Colin Dexter sensed the public’s love for Thaw’s Morse and never cared that the actor didn’t resemble the man on the printed page much. At its peak, the series attracted more than 18 million viewers in the UK, and the show was sold to some 200 countries. So pleased was Dexter with Thaw’s rendition of Morse that, Dexter’s will clearly states that no one apart from Thaw can play Morse ever!\n\nAfter playing Morse for several seasons, Thaw took on a genuine proprietary interest in the show, though he didn’t own any part of it. In the final years, he negotiated the title of “executive producer” for himself by involving his own production company with the program. Though quite common in the U.S., where the stars of long-running TV series often begin to “take over” their show, that move was extremely rare in British television.\n\n*********\n\nThere is a prequel ‘Endeavour’ portraying a young Morse which has aired few episodes (2012, ’13 and ’14). Yes that was Morse’s first name. I do not want to know whether Shaun Evans fits the bill as Morse or whether a younger Morse looks appealing with a head full of blond hair. Set in 1965, Evans plays the young Detective Constable Morse, who as he prepares to hand in his resignation becomes embroiled in an investigation involving a missing schoolgirl.\n\nTo me, Morse will always be the magnificent John Thaw and vice versa. The dignified looking man who showed unexpected bouts of kindness and respect to fellow humans, often quoted from his favourite classics, and sang in the choir. Some performances are timeless.\n\nThank you for letting me the pleasure of knowing you Mr. Morse. I so wish I could have met you for real in this lifetime and discussed quotes. And art. And literature. While we basked in eternal sunshine.\n\n*********\n\nHow does an individual feel when she is expected to develop rather intimate relations with another person to help accomplish a third person’s goals? A carefully woven web, where she is made to feel important but her dilemma and emotions are ruthlessly side tracked for a bigger picture.\n\nViolated? Powerful? Sorry? How does it feel to be a honeytrap?\n\nEva Delectorskaya felt all three as she ran out of the discreet, posh hotel room post being photographed in a compromising position with a powerful US senator. As she hurriedly buttons herself up, checks her makeup and hair at the foot of the stairs, the camera catches the emotions in her eyes – that of an animal caught in a net. No matter how nonchalant Eva acts she knows deep down that she will live and die a spy.\n\nOne, who systematically indulges in betrayal to prove her loyalty.\n\nFew figures throughout history are as compelling as female spies. Whether you think of them as sleuths or femme fatales, most of them have been exceptionally brave and have done things for the country/ regime they believed in which we cannot even imagine emulating.\n\n—————————————————————————–\n\nI came across Restless (a two part miniseries) created for BBC1 based on William Boyd’s novel by the same name, recently as I meandered aimlessly on the virtual sphere. It was time well spent 🙂\n\n——————————————————————————————-\n\nThere are 2 parallel stories going on set 35 years apart.\n\nIt starts with a rather fetching in a hippie avatar young woman Ruth played by Michelle Dockery (of downtown Abbey fame) visiting her mother with her young son. The mother played with elan by Charlotte Rampling (age I can see has increased her beauty manifold!) lives in a country cottage with empty stretches all around. Pure, far from maddening crowd set up. It seems like an idyllic setting for a little break for Ruth and her son, when one evening Ruth’s mom pushes a file in her direction and informs her that someone is lurking around waiting for an opportune moment to kill her.\n\nRuth laughs her off. I mean people who are getting old sometimes say odd things and you need not take them seriously even if she is your mother.\n\nThe name on the file says Eva Delectorskaya; Ruth soon learns that her mother has all along lead a double life! She is in fact a Russian girl Eva who was WWII spy for Britain. Along with Ruth the audience are taken back to the early 1940s. Hayley Atwell as the young Eva is pure delight – transporting herself rather believably from the innocent emigrant girl who was devastated by her young brother’s death to the professional spy who can kill someone by simply jabbing them in the eye with a sharp pencil. And then take that pencil out without batting an eyelid as blood oozes out making the death look like a mere fatal accident.\n\nEva was initiated to the world of Mata Hari with the best advice – a) Never trust anyone and b) Never assume anything as a co incidence by her mentor Lucas Romer played by a suave Rufus Sewell.\n\nThe action moves between Paris, Scotland, fictitious Dutch border own, USA and part of SA and of course Britain. The twists and turns keep you engaged. And yes, like in a well done spy thriller there is love, betrayal and revenge. At some point Ruth gets dragged in her mother’s war; the mother she believed was nothing but a perfect English homemaker. The mother was at some point everything but it. And someone who could not let her past go. What if one day I come to know my parents are not really who I thought they were? I think I will freak. Ruth was far more stoic (in her expressions as well !) Should we involve our children in our past? And even if we do, how much of the past still matters? There are far bigger questions involved in the plot that does not get addressed in the film. Those are for conversations over cocktails as my blog name suggests 😉\n\nA lot of detailing, good cinematography and above all superb casting make it an enjoyable watch. The plot has some loopholes but that’s because I read too many crime thrillers.\n\nOh and for us Indians there is a serious DDLJ moment when Eva desperately wants the man she loved to turn around and give her a backward glance J\n\nGo, get yourself some wine and watch it over the weekend.\n\n—————\n\nPS: There is an instance where Eva looking fetching in a polka dotted dress, white rimmed sunglass and heels waits for an important package in a barren land, smoking one cigarette after another while her car is at least a mile off on the highway. She is not harmed at any point. In fact she returns safe and sound back to her motel. We live in a non -war era. I wondered how many women can replicate that in today’s context and come home safe.\n\nI addressed my paternal grandmother Amma.\n\nThe name given to her at birth was Molina – apparently because she was not too (ahem) fair complexioned. Yes, the fair and lovely obsession runs generation deep in our subcontinent. She in turn called me Shonamoni (complete horror to be saddled with that name, but never mind; we Indian kids know how to survive weirdest of pet names).\n\nA slightly frail, bespectacled, wheatish complexioned woman, she had soft wrinkly skin like a regular grand mom and a typical smell – a heady mix of cooking oil, agarbatti and Mysore Sandal soap. Yes, that’s the brand she preferred. Cooking was one of her core skills; in fact even after 28 years that she has ceased to exist, whenever she gets a mention in some or the other family gathering by people who have tasted her lip smacking dishes, she is still recounted as the lady with the golden touch. She marvelled at rustling up pure Bengali (read Bangal or those who hailed from Bangladesh) cuisine; veg dishes were her speciality.\n\nI mostly do not recollect the taste of the food she would diligently prepare and serve –first to my father and only then to everybody else as we sat in our respective chairs around the old but solid dining table. My favourite dish those days consisted butter rice or Mohan’s cornflakes and milk which as you can guess did not require much ‘cooking’.\n\nI do remember the snacks she prepared post Durgapujo. Day long hectic activities were undertaken at the kitchen by Amma and Ma ensuring that the glass jars got their fill of naru, moya, nimki and the likes to be offered to relatives and family friends who came visiting personally to wish ‘Bijoya’. Bijoya greetings were big in those days. Crisp white kurta –pajamas did its rounds as did new curtains and upholstery. The worn-during-Pujo sarees were re-worn (I mean you did not meet all your friends and relatives during Pujo right, so they needed to see the pujo shopping post Pujo) prior to sending them to dry cleaners, fun and festivity along with non-stop misthi consumption continued till Kalipujo.\n\nNow? We (extended family, friends) sms each other. Saves time, effort and human interaction.\n\nHer culinary skills earned her a ‘must be in kitchen’ status as a core member of the cooking team in the huge joint family which flourished in Faridpur (now Bangladesh). Such was the mandate that she was not given a break from the kitchen even when her first born, a son, was dying of some cannot-be-cured disease at the age of eight – nine. She narrated this spine chilling story in a state of delirium one day; she was rather unwell and I was her diligent companion post my school hours.\n\nWas she proud that her cooking mattered so much? Was she repulsed at the cruelty meted out? I don’t know. I was hardly eight myself and there were far more important things in my mind to pay close attention – which doll to be fed first, which bedtime story to be selected for post lunch read, whether I can bypass yawn inducing homework etc.\n\nOnce, as she returned home from casting her vote, I had pestered her to tell me which party she voted for even though I was a mere seven year old. But I did know the names of the two biggest rival parties in our State. As one knows being Bengali means we discuss politics, food and culture even when we are zygotes. She did whisper her choice in my ears because it was not ‘cool’ to discuss votes openly. We giggled. It was our little secret that stayed with me. She had defiantly gone ahead against my father’s favourite political party!\n\nMarried off an early age (I guess around 14ish) she and my Dadu (paternal grandfather) lived together for nearly 60-62 odd years till death parted them. They sometimes shared puffed rice and oily potato crispies from the same bowl. They definitely shared the four poster bed – a relic from the past. She would often press my Dadu’s forehead post dinner and ensure he has a jug of water and glass next to his side of the bed.\n\nAs I polish the few silver items that she cherished sometimes on a lazy weekday, her sindoor kouto among them, I wonder at her unwavering faith in her marriage and her husband. No matter whether he did something right or wrong, whether his decisions or words affected her, she was one of those who believed that ‘marriages are meant for keeps’. When I read the inscription on it along with her name Molina, ‘Pati param guru’ or as in English ‘Husband is the ultimate teacher’ I am mostly at a loss whether to smirk, smile or sigh!\n\nThe concept of marriage has changed or better still evolved! The latter, is a nicer sounding word. Nowadays, we take neither the relationship seriously nor the other person involved. But sometimes I contemplate – was her’s a safer life knowing that no matter what, someone will always have your back? How does one trust another person so unwaveringly? Is it actually reassuring to know that through thick and thin and immense compromises there still will be that one familiar face till then end?\n\nAnd how on earth did she manage to make those mouth-watering narkel naru (coconut sweets)?\n\nGosh, the narkel naru craving will do me in one day.\n\n*************\n\nSindoor kouto:“Ek chutki sindoor ka kimat tum kya jano Dev Babu?” – an epic Bollywood (read FILMY) dialogue that we have all laughed at. Considered dramatic now, there was a time, few decades back when vermilion or sindoor was truly the Holy Grail for women of marriageable age. Vermilion powder applied on the hair parting stands for the woman’s identity after marriage in most parts of India – definitely Bengal. Sindoor-kouto is the container in which the powder is kept.\n\nComes in all kind of shapes and sizes J\n\nA personal note: I watched Blue Jasmine and Queen in the same week. Both have female protagonists trying to move on with their lives. The former is based in America, a country I have never visited. I have very limited all American friends. The later, Queen is about a girl from Delhi. Having lived and loved Delhi, I could not relate to the central character in Q (apparently there are real girls in 21st century who introduce themselves as ‘Myself Rani from Rajouri!) at all while every 15 minutes there would be a sense of déjà vu as I watched Blue Jasmine.\n\nI guess that is the power of good cinema and flawless performance. It makes you one of their own. Even if you do not belong to the land they hail from. This is the kind of film I wish was made more. This one will stay with me. For a long, long time.\n\n————————————————\n\nWe first meet Jasmine, dressed nattily in pearls and a Chanel jacket, talking in a slightly high handed manner to her fellow passenger. Soon after, though, she stands with her monogrammed luggage on a nondescript San Francisco sidewalk, looking frightened, alone and someone who could benefit from some kindness. Instead, she waves off a stranger and asks the most existential and practical, question in a demanding manner, “Where am I, exactly?”\n\n‘Where am I, exactly in the bigger picture called life? This is so relevant in the world I inhabit. Most humans including me seem to be suffering from perpetual existential crisis. I hop jobs, cities, trying to belong somewhere; I know others who even hop relationships as the question keeps playing in a loop in our mind.\n\nA former Park Avenue socialite, she had shed her unexciting past life and name from Jeantte to Jasmine (sounds much more exotic) to marry the wealthy Hal Francis. Hal is played superbly by Alec Baldwin who looks every inch an investment banker type, slippery, suave with all smiles and no soul.\n\nAs Allen moves the story between past and present, we see that Jasmine’s full of branded clothes and accessorised life consisting of talked about parties, vacations in the most coveted destinations, turns upside down following her husband’s imprisonment (he was after all a smooth talking swindler) and subsequent suicide. The government took him, and then it took the rest, leaving Jasmine with little more than her designer threads and luggage. Thus humbled, Jasmine finds herself forced to park her Louis Vuitton luggage in the incompatible surroundings of her adoptive sister’s San Francisco apartment. When she first walks into Ginger’s apartment, she stops dead, as if paralyzed by its unspeakable middle- classness.\n\nThe destruction begins as she tried to rebuild her life supported by alcohol and Xanax and her ordinary, mother of two, working sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins). Jasmine is finally out of her depth as she swings between ill-fitting employment, ill-judged social climbing and abysmal interpersonal relations clutching to her Channel jackets as life saving oxygen.\n\nThere was once a girl who had to ‘move on’ with life trying to find her foothold in a very competitive new city still reeling from an all-consuming personal tragedy aided with alcohol and prescribed anti-depressants. In her case, there were a lot of genuine well-wishing friends and her aunt and uncle. Maybe if Jasmine had a bigger support group, her story would be different? I muse as I watch her spiralling out of control. I can empathize with her fear. Jasmine masks that by overwhelming anyone willing to listen with grandiose stories of the opulent life she once led.\n\nThe film draws deep from the well of ‘Streetcar named desire’. Yes, Ginger’s boyfriend Chili is the blue collared, cool hairdo ‘Brando’ here. Mr. Allen has managed to turn a somewhat borrowed storyline into an exquisite tragic drama where he has replaced the sexual tension from Tennessee Williams’ iconic play and replaced it with lust for power and position.\n\nAs a delusional and mutters-to-herself Jasmine, Cate Blanchett has simply inhabited the character in a monster of a performance borrowed from Vivien Leigh and Katharine Hepburn to create a character that’s terrifying yet heart wrenching. She had of course played Blanche DuBois in Liv Ullmann’s acclaimed stage production, prompting the New York Times to proclaim that “the lady who lives for illusion has never felt more real”. Blanchett glows with old-world charm in scenes set during Jasmine’s better times, her voice taking an affected New England tone, looking beautiful with a perpetual glint of loss in her eye. In scenes where she begins to finally doubt her husband we see fear in her eyes which is immediately replaced by denial, whether in the shape of a bracelet or sex. Tennessee Williams sent his Blanche into the abyss, Allen sends his Jasmine to the magical world where she always longed to be.\n\nThe climactic confrontation between Jasmine and Hal, takes place in their living room, a shrine to their wealth, where against the colour of money (the walls are green), they fight for their lives taking swings at each other without a thought to everyone else they are about to take down. In Blue Jasmine, there is a paradoxical game being played with haves and have nots, detailing how Jasmine, for all her cushion of wealth, lacks everything that matters – love, inner peace, real security.\n\nAnd I know quite a few who are on the same path – engulfed in all that which will not matter in the end.\n\nWith time it becomes clear that, while losing her money helped push Jasmine over the edge, it was also the easy money that drove her nuts to begin with. What did Jasmine know, and when did she know it? These questions come to haunt “Blue Jasmine,” and as the past catches up with the present, they help drive this moving film toward its shattering end.\n\nSally Hawkins is earnest, Peter Saarsgaard the perfect political ladder climber, Sally’s boys chubby, cartoonish and in a way surreal. But it is Cate with her stellar performance stands so tall that you only remember her.\n\nShe is just brilliant as the anti-heroine and delivers the kind of performance we film lovers live for.\n\nAs for Woody, this film reconfirms that his greatest triumphs may yet lie ahead.\n\nI wish the story had a somewhat happy ending. But life is not always fair to everyone.\n\nI chanced upon this film out of the blue and realized it is always good to catch a not over hyped, light film with an inherent interesting message. The message in the film, the old Arabian tale of Aladin’s magic lamp set in contemporary Calcutta, is simple yet profound. The gadget freak genie informs his disillusioned, heartbroken owner at some point that “Rupkothay sobta bola thake na” or ‘not everything is mentioned in fairy tales’.\n\nWe all just prefer to look at the bright side of a tale, but each has its dark corners which raises its ugly head from time to time.\n\nAschorjo Pradip based on Shirshendu Mukhopadhya’s story has been adapted as an adult fable with witty dialogues, sarcasm and believable protagonists by the director Anik Dutta (of Bhuter Bhobisyat fame). Anil (Saswata Chatterjee in a spectacled, relevant rings on his finger to improve his fate persona) and Jhumur (Sreelekha Mitra) a typical middle class Bengali couple live, aspire and fight it out on a daily basis in an overstuffed with furniture 1.5 room rented accommodation in a Bechu Dutta lane (sounds middle class enough !) house where Anil has lived all his life.\n\nThey have hazaar issues in their life and marriage – husband does not speak enough English to appear for their son’s admission test, son wants a playstation, wife needs a brand new i10 since her sister has a bigger car, she regrets marrying him just because she liked his songs in a Pujo pandal, husband hardly sings anymore, the son pukes whenever he has to drink milk for breakfast, the husband needs to work harder to meet sales target and secretly pines for his company’s sultry Bong bombshell brand ambassador who goes by the cheeky name Mala M(aal), he turns the photograph of Baba Loknath to face the wall when he tries to cajole his wife for physical intimacy – it is basically a household we all have seen / been to at some point in our lives.\n\nThe first half till Saswata comes across the magic lamp while helping neighbourhood kids find their cricket ball, has its good moments. Of course, if you are a Bengali, you totally get the jokes; not sure if they will come across that funny in translation.\n\nSample this: Anil late for his office, having been rejected by Taxi drivers somehow manages to get himself in a crowded bus. As the bus takes a nasty turn he nearly falls over a lady standing in front of him. Lady turns and looks at him with pure disgust. Just as she opens her mouth to say something, Anil says “Ache”. The taant wearing lady angered beyond recognition snaps “Ki ache?” Anil stoically replies, “Barite ma bon ache”.\n\nSaswata is good. I have seen him in 2-3 movies till now and have started acknowledging him as an actor who does have a range.\n\nAs expected, once the lamp is rubbed, the genie (Rajatava Dutta in a bald, blue tooth wielding plastic avatar) makes an appearance and thus starts the new, always wanted but could not afford life of Anil’s. He is able to purchase a duplex apartment in a swanky project, hangs out at the famed Golf club, and drinks premium scotch at expensive eateries, closes business deals successfully with international companies’ blah blah.\n\nOf course, like all stories this ends one fine day. And not on a nice note at all. I personally found the climax interesting.\n\nYes, the film could have done away with all the songs except Charidik bodle gechhe, wherein composer Raja Narayan Deb collaborates with Amit Kumar to recreate the evergreen number sung by his legendary father Kishore Kumar, Prithibi bodle gechhe. Keeping the melody intact, the director has re-worked the lyrics. Yes, the film could have been edited better. It does drag in the second half and there are some boring stereotypes (Marwari businessman stating Bengalis are only bothered about culture, art and Tagore, a typical atheist intellectual who corrects Anil’s English pronunciation etc) but it is definitely worth a one-time watch.\n\nOne should not always look for deep, meaningful in every frame cinema. Grab a beer, get some snacks and chill today evening with Aschorjo Pradip.\n\n*************\n\n‘Comrade’, the word, has a deep-brass-voice-evoking-reverence kind of zing to it. It creates a vision of those innumerable rebels (with and without a cause) trying to change the world order, tirelessly shouting anti establishment slogans, walking miles in a hungry stomach, playing hide and seek (and succeeding) with the law enforcers, you get the drift. However, the term comrade in its simplest form also means, ‘ally’, ‘companion’, ‘colleague’.\n\nThe terribly busy for their age boys in the wonderfully captured photograph are comrades in their own right. Except theirs is a case of ‘comrades of lost childhood’. One that’s gone forever. That does make them ‘fellow member of fraternal group’ – as defined in the dictionary, right?\n\nThe grime and dirt, the constant hunger, the once a day bath in the unbearable summer under a municipal tap, the street dance during a procession, the same old tattered clothes during festivals, the luxury of lighting a beedi, the action flicks in the going-to-be-closed-soon single theatre, the shy smile when someone actually speaks to them like a human being and remembers their individual names and not address them as universal ‘chotu’, the impromptu jig when the latest item number blares from the nearly defunct radio when no one is watching, the hard wooden bench that serves as a bed, they the boy-comrades share it all.\n\nThere is no summer or Diwali vacation. Or medical and paid leaves. Oh wait, they are not even supposed to be working at this age if you believe the policies framed by the Government, so how can they even question or consider fair terms and conditions?\n\nQuoting just two of what the National Legislation and Policies against Child Labour in India states:\n\na) Children shall be given opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth shall be protected against moral and material abandonment (Article 39-f) and\n\nb) The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age six to 14 years. (Article 21 (A));\n\nBut these are words that are beyond their understanding. They have never been to a school except when maybe they were five-six year old; the alphabets are a blur. But what they understand is companionship. They don’t score brownie points by pointing out the child who actually made the deafening noise in order to become the coveted blue eyed pet, they don’t mind sharing their once a year elaborate Biryani meal in a roadside stall, they share the crackers they burst during Diwali even if that is just one packet chocolate bombs that they can afford among themselves. They don’t sulk if one toy among the hundreds is broken by a friend. And yes, during bandh, they play gulli cricket with other boys from neighbouring shops. The required gadgets are amiss, but the fun, the enthusiasm, the elation when a six is scored – its all there!\n\nThey can handle the world and its eccentricities; they have each other to rely on. They are comrades, in its truest sense.\n\n*********\n\nTimes of India on 23rd February 2014 carried a wittily put together article on snobbery and included TRAVEL SNOBS in that. It cheekily mentions that folks who do not swim with sharks or chase vicunas in Atacama are looked down by the highbrow travelers.\n\nNow I am yet to chase vicunas, but I realize I suffer from alienation issues with the travel plans of an average, middle to upper middle class Indian. Couple of conversations reiterated that. Look, I have no issues that you want to visit Bangkok, Singapore and Thailand. I understand airlines have decent deals; you can dutifully inform your FB friends (the most important people in our lives) that you are indeed part of the jet setting type and truth is phoren locales do make us Indians, salivate. But I do raise my eyebrows (inwardly) when your entire year’s travel itinerary does not include any part of our exotic country. Quite a few of my north Indian friends have not heard of quaint yet interesting places in Bengal. A whole bunch of my Bengali friends do not know about historically rich places in South India. It is exasperating indeed!\n\nThus a post about a historically rich place tucked away in the interiors of West Bengal which some real travel aficionados may have missed. Whenever you visit that part of the country, incorporate this in your schedule if you are remotely interested in history of mankind and that of our motherland. Or even if you are a car/ bike enthusiast, looking for a short yet interesting trip. For a nostalgia junkie like me, it was of course in ‘must visit’ in the bucket list.\n\n—————————————————\n\nFYI: I had undertaken this trip in 2005; memories and photographs may be slightly faded.\n\nExquisite terracotta temples that stand testimony to its glorious past, Bishnupur, located in the Bankura district of WB, 150 kms from Calcutta, is also renowned for its handicrafts and Baluchari sarees. Bishnupur caught my attention for the first time while devouring one of Sastipada Chattopashya’s * “Pandab Goyenda”.\n\nThose who grew up in Bengal in the 80s and can read Bengali must have heard of this series; it was kind of a localised version of Famous Five. In one of their daring adventures while they were vacationing in Bishnupur during their summer holidays, they expectedly helped nab a bunch of dangerous criminals. It was awe inducing. I mean, at that ripe old age of 7-10, I so badly wanted to be them – they travelled on their own, had a pet Indie dog, ate lots of samosa-jalebis and other munchies and even carried knives/ pistols to combat criminals. I had made up my mind that one day I will walk those exact lanes of Bishnupur, and maybe I will be lucky enough to shoo away some rogue criminal with my mere presence!\n\nHistory is something I became fond of much later in life.\n\nFor history addicts: The history of Bishnupur can be traced back to 694 AD, when King Raghunath 1 founded the Malla dynasty. Bishnupur was the capital of Mallabhoom or regions ruled by the Mallas that included Bankura, parts of Midnapore, Burdwan and Chota Nagpur. Malla, an aboriginal title was used for many centuries before they took the Kshatriya title of Singh; locally they have been referred as the Bagdi Rajas all over Bengal.\n\nUnder their able rule, Bishnupur developed a unique form of architecture and has perhaps the most brilliant and detailed terracotta work in Eastern India that has withstood the ravages of time. However it was much later in 994 AD that the place was named Bishnupur. The name is derived from the name of the Hindu God ‘Vishnu’ and the majority people then belonged to the ‘Vaishnava’ sect. Though it reached its zenith in the 17th and early 18th centuries, the Maratha ravages followed by the famine of 1771 depopulated their territory and the kingdom slowly dissolved. Eventually the entire estate was sold by the Government for arrears of revenue in 1806. The last of the Rajas was Ram Krishna Singh Deb who died without a son or heir.\n\nHow to reach: Bishnupur is well connected and can be reached both by train and by bus.\n\nCalcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) and South Bengal State Transport Corporation (SBSTC) buses ply regularly between Dharmatala/ Esplanade bus stand of Kolkata and Bishnupur. Or if you are in any other part of WB, you can take a bus from Tarakeswar, Durgapur, Bardhaman and Kharagpur.\n\nTrains to Bishnupur depart from 2 stations in Kolkata: Howrah Jn (HWH) and Santragachi Jn (SRC)\n\nIf you hire a cab or decide to drive down from Kolkata travel to Dankuni, take the Durgapur Expressway, at Ratanpur crossing turn left and take the Sheoraphuli-Tarakeswar road, go straight through to Arambagh and Bishnupur.\n\nOnce you reach Bishnupur, you can hire private auto-rickshaws or cycle-rickshaws; I personally feel cycle ricksaws with their sluggish pace enables you to inhale the rich history of the town better.\n\n————————————————\n\nHow and why I detoured to Durgapur from an intended Nepal trip 2005, is a long story, so we will let that be. I was required to stay at Durgapur for 2-3 days attending some personal work, when it struck me that my wish of visiting Bishnupur can be converted to reality. One of my friends knew a reliable cab driver and she and I left for our day trip post breakfast the very next day. Ideally an overnight option at one of the hotels/ lodges is a better way to explore leisurely the town and its people.\n\nDetails of stay options can be found at: http://sdobishnupur.in/portal/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7&Itemid=159\n\nSome part of the journey did have roads which were not in the best of shape (the situation may have changed for better now). But overall it was a pleasant ride through the outskirts of villages and forests and you can enjoy the fresh air caressing your face and hair while your eyes feast on the laidback vistas of rural Bengal as you approach the town. The sky was overcast adding to our sense of adventure rather than act as a deterrent. We reached post 10 am and had around 4 hours with us, barring a late lunch at my friend’s extended family members’ place so we decided on hiring a cycle ricksaw for some parts of the tour. I have a soft corner for these major non-polluting vehicles that invariable reminds me of my childhood, spent in another small town of Bengal where it was a major form of transportation. Lalan, our ricksaw puller also pitched in from time to time as our tour guide.\n\nMajor attractions: I will personally not describe Bishnupur as a temple town because I feel it has so much more to offer but yes, the temples are the major attraction. Crafted intricately by native craftsmen with mostly local laterite and brick as raw materials, the temples have elaborate tiles depicting scenes from Ramayana, Mahabharata, Shri Khrishna’s life, war scenes and some domestic scenes depicting life in those days. Till such time that I visited Bishnupur, I had no idea that terracotta tiles can be so breath taking!\n\nRasamancha, the oldest of the brick temple, is curiously shaped like Pyramid, surrounded by hut like turrets. Built in the late 16th century, it is extremely unique and perhaps the only one in eastern India) not dedicated to any particular Hindu God/ Goddesses. In fact during the yearly “Rasparba” all the deities belonging to Radha and Khrishna would be collated under the same roof.\n\nThe other important ones are the Radha Madhav temple, Shyamray Temple (considered the most beautiful), Khrishna-Balaram Mandir, Jorh Bangla Temple, RadhaShyam temple, LaljiTemple and the Madanmohan temple.\n\nNote: The Sub Divisional Officer- Bishnupur’s site mentions that presently RashMancho, Kalachand and JorBangla temples are illuminated at night to showcase the cultural finesse. However because of miscreants (how we love to disrespect our history) some of the temples have a wired boundary which means you cannot go up close to see that beautiful terracotta work and can only appreciate it from a suitable distance.\n\nStone Chariot (yes not only Hampi can claim that they have it J), ‘Pathar Daraja’ or fort and Dalmadal Kaman (cannon) are the other attractions.\n\nhttp://bishnupurguide.blogspot.in/2009/09/dalmadal-canon-made-by-human-used-by.html is a page that narrated the story attached to the mammoth cannon.\n\nThen there is Lalbandh ( a huge water body) and Nutan Mahal. This has a Bollywood potboiler story attached. King Raghunath Singh was so much in love with his mistress Lalbai (for whom Nutan mahal was constructed) that not only did he promise to organize a bigger celebration on the occasion of their son’s birthday as compared to his own younger sibling Gopal Singh, but forced everyone to accept that invitation. The subjects were worried that Lalbai has conspired with Katlu Khan (a powerful Mughal ruler) to overpower Raghunath Singh and take control of the kingdom and throne. The misunderstanding between the king and his wife reaches a point where she kills him. Struck with grief, she joins her husband in the funeral pyre as Sati (yes, that atrocious practice was highly recommended in those days). On the head priests’s instruction, a chained Lalbai was forcefully drowned in Lalbandh by angry mob. Her child was adopted by the head priest. Phew!\n\nHandicrafts & textiles: What caught my eyes and is still imprinted in my mind as me and my friend scouted for keepsakes, is that the craftsmen and artisans who toil to make the eye catching products are impoverished and needs encouragement from all sections of our society.\n\nThe most famous art form of Bishnupur is of course Terracotta followed by Baluchari and Swarnachari sarees. One saree may even have an entire episode of Mahabharata crafted in its border and pallu – such is the brilliant craftsmanship.\n\nBesides that you also have Dokra figuruines, bell metal &brass artefacts, woodcrafts & Bishnupuri lanterns. The conch shell carving is one of the traditional art of Bishnupur mostly patronised by the Sankha Banik caste. Besides, making bangles (sanka), the artisans beautifully curve various mythological characters of Hindu pantheons on conch shell.\n\n‘Pot‘ and ‘Dash Avatar Taash‘ another important handicraft item has foreign market demand. The ‘Dash Avatar Taash‘ used to play by Malla Rajas. Contrary to usual 52 no. of parlaying cards, 120 no. of ‘Dash Avatar’ playing cards is required. In Bishnupur Mela, the demonstration of the playing ‘Dash Avatar Tash’ is made to popularize the ancient game.\n\nFYI: In the whole trip we had to take tickets twice, once from Archaeological Survey of India for visiting 3 temples under their care and protection and another for Lalgarh Nature Park. On our ricksaw puller insistence, we did stop at one of those emporiums that sell stunning handicrafts, I did purchase an elephant (everyone and their cousins have the Bishnupur horses, I needed to be different!) and an intricate terracotta conch. And yes, they are conversation starters.\n\nOn our way back, we were quiet. The sleepy, laid back, quaint town had a very soul satisfying effect. Go ahead, smell unpolluted air, touch the red soil and discover the rich heritage of our land for yourself. Its enchanting!\n\n————————————-\n\nNotes: The Sub-Division administration of Bishnupur, since 1988, with the help of Bankura District administration and Zilla Parishad has been organizing 5-Day long Bishnupur Mela in December.The Tourism Department in association with local administration, to promote tourist interests organize 2-Day long Classical programme at Bishnupur during the month of December/ January. Similar to Konark or Khajuraha Festival, such classical programme is organized keeping the temples of Bishnupur at background.\n\n*Sastipada Chattopadhya was born on 9th March, 1941 in Central Howrah, Khurut Sashtitala..He started his literary work from early adulthood.
