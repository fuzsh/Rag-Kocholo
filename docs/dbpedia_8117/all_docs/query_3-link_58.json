        "text": "In a shocking turn of events, popular Bengali actress Sreelekha Mitra found herself trapped in a online electricity bill scam that led to a financial loss of more than one lakh. The incident unfolded on August 29, just a day before her birthday, while she was battling a bout of fever, a Times of India report mentions.\n\nIn an interview, Sreelekha revealed that she received an unexpected call a day before her birthday.The caller persuaded her to download a mobile app. She said she was so weak because of her fever that she could not figure that she was interacting with a cyber criminal. Unfortunately, Sreelekha failed to realize the impending danger, resulting in a significant loss of her bank account.\n\nShocked and disheartened by the deceitful tactics of the scammer, Sreelekha turned to her social media platforms to share her harrowing experience. She emphasized the need for caution and vigilance when encountering such situations. She also admitted that she was wrong in trusting the caller. However, now that the incident has taken place with her, her goal now is to alert others about the looming threat of similar scams.\n\nTalking about the incident, Sreelekha said, \"I thought I was being smart, but I ended up making a foolish mistake. I urge everyone to be cautious to avoid falling into a similar trap. I won't disclose the exact amount I lost, but it's more than a lakh. I have reported the incident to the police and contacted the cyber cell.\" She also commended the prompt action taken by the police upon receiving her complaint.\n\nThis unfortunate incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of cybersecurity and vigilance in our increasingly digital world. Even well-known figures like Sreelekha Mitra can fall victim to these scams, highlighting the need for everyone to stay alert and informed to protect themselves from cyber threats.\n\nTo stay safe from scams, be extra cautious when someone you don't know asks for your personal information or to download strange apps. Don't share sensitive details like passwords or bank information with anyone online or on the phone. Always verify the identity of the person or organization reaching out to you, and if something seems fishy, trust your instincts and don't proceed. Remember, your bank or trusted organizations won't ask for confidential information over the phone or email. Lastly, keep your computer and phone's security software up to date to help protect against scams. Stay smart and stay safe!"
