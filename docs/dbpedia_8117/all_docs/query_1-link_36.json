        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe 'Hothat Brishti' actress while narrating her ordeal on Instagram, urged fans to refrain from downloading any app or browsing any link if they were not sure about their credentials.\n\nPopular Bengali actress Sreelekha Mitra recently revealed on social media that she had lost about Rs 1 lakh to an online electricity bill fraud.\n\nOn August 29, the actress was reportedly tricked into downloading an app on her phone, with the help of which the scamsters siphoned off the money. The actress claims she received a mysterious call, which prompted her to install the suggested app on her smartphone.\n\nThe 'Hothat Brishti' actress while narrating her ordeal on Instagram, warned fans to refrain from downloading any app or browsing any link if they were not sure about their credentials.\n\n\"I was in a bad mood on my birthday because I got scammed the day before ...It has become a profession.. So beware, please do not download any app or open any link without knowing. #BewareOfFraudsters ...I never cheated on anyone, so I didn't know how to cheat... I don't want to know details... #cybercrime #cybercellkolkata #haridevpurpolicestation,\" Mitra, who had recently wrapped up shooting for Tathagata Mukherjee's 'Pariah', posted on her account.\n\nA police complaint was lodged at the Haridevpur station. The Behala division cyber cell is also investigating the case.\n\n\"We expect a breakthrough soon,\" an officer from the Behala division, looking into the case, Times of India reported.\n\nThe cyber cell of the detective department has issued a fresh alert against such fraudulent activities.\n\nDon't Make Yourself Vulnerable. Follow These Tips To Prevent Online Fraud\n\nOnline payments have simplified our lives. But one click gone wrong, and you can land in a big mess. Being aware and alert can help you avert a financial tragedy.\n\nHere are some ways to protect yourself from online fraud:\n\n1. Use verified apps only: Every time you install an app on your device, make sure it is a verified one. Download all applications only from official play stores like Google Play Store, Windows App Store or Apple App Store.\n\n2. Browse on authorised websites only: Beware of imposter websites that may look professional or carry the same domain name as the original one in the URL. Look for \"https://\" before \"www\" and the lock icon on the address bar of your browser.\n\n3. Use secure connections only: There are no free lunches! Truly! Avoid using public hotspots - free WiFi at hotels, airports or cafes - for making a financial transaction. Public networks are often prone to data theft risk as their encryption can be cracked easily to access information.\n\n4. Be vigilant while using card: When paying by a credit or debit card, make sure that it is done in your presence. There have been cases where cards have been cloned by skimmers while the transaction was being done.\n\n5. Never click on suspicious links on SMS or emails: Do not entertain unsolicited calls or mails. Link-baiting, spurious emails and SMSes are the most common forms of trapping people into fraud. These links may seem genuine and attract your attention with claims of lottery or a job overseas. Do not follow any such links, as they may lead you to a phishing site and rob you off your mobile’s security features.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nHNIs invested in Piramal PMS.
