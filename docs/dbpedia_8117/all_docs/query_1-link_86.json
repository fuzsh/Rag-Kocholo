        "text": "Sreelekha Mitra is not known to be the shy one. However, in her recent photo, she is evidently giving a coy smile. In the photo, she stands, holding an award, and blushing. In a green saree, she looks like a diva. Actor Chanchal Choudhury stands beside her. The colour of his kurta matches Sreelekha's saree.\n\nThe actress shared this photo after she received an award at a show on Friday. Along with the photograph, she captioned it, “Please someone cast us together.” She also wrote, “This photo… Kuch Kuch Hota Hai…”\n\nChanchal’s fan following increased in West Bengal after Karagar was released in Hoichoi. Many people expressed their wish to work with him. Sreelekha also revealed her wish.\n\nLots of comments were posted on her status. Sreelekha also has numerous fans. Someone wrote, “Did you coordinate before to wear the same colour?” Another one wrote, “I am ready, given I get a producer.” Sreelekha previously talked openly about searching for a producer.\n\nSreelekha also concentrated on directing films. Her short film Ebong Chad was much acclaimed and loved. She also directed an ad film a few days back. Chanchal is also busy with his work. He will be seen as Mrinal Sen in Srijit Mukherji’s film, Padatik."
