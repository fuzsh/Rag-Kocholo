        "text": "Sreelekha Mitra is known to be a very open person about her personal life on social media. She does not shy away from making controversial comments, be it expressing opinions about current politics or posting her bold pictures. On the day of Laxmi Puja, Sreelekha posts her photos decked up in vermillion and Alta.\n\nIn her selfie, where she is seen wearing a white T-shirt. Meanwhile, the vermillion initiated a conversation on her post as the actress Sreelekha is divorced for a long time. Pointing it out, she said, “Don’t think I married again.”\n\nExplaining her decked-up avatar, Sreelekha said that she was following her mother’s tradition. “Following my mother’s tradition, I am also doing a small Laxmi Puja at my place. I am doing a shoot which will be public today. I will let you know the time and venue,” she wrote on her social media handle.\n\nSomeone replied to this post by addressing Sreelekha, who is known to be a staunch left supporter, as ‘my secular sister’. Sreelekha retorted, “Exactly. Everyone has the right to celebrate their religion.”\n\nSreelekha got married to Siladitya Sanyal in 2003. She has a friendly relationship with Siladitya even after the divorce. They have a daughter named Oishi.\n\nRecently Sreelekha debuted in direction. A short film, Ebong Chad, directed and produced by her, was screened in Nandan and garnered praise. Her film Once Upon a Time in Kolkata, which is directed by Aditya Vikram Sengupta, was praised in the international circle. Sreelekha Mitra said that she does not want to confine herself to acting and hence started to write stories."
