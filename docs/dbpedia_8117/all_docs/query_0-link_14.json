The seasoned actress often gives her fans and followers a taste of her incisive wit with a generous serving of her signature humour. This time around, her social media universe got to see yet another classy witticism.  Sreelekha took to her Facebook handle and wrote, “Sorry Hrithik Roshan your bra was too tight for me.” She also shared a screenshot. Surprised right? Well, the actress recently bought her innerwear from an e-commerce site and the product is from Hrithik Roshan’s company brand. In the screenshot, we can see she’s returning the product but what grabbed everyone’s attention is her witty side and the way she captioned the post. As soon as she dropped the post fans and followers flooded the comment section appreciating her sense of humour. Sreeleka is always at her sassy best on social media. Whether it is sharing comical memes, taking a dig at celebs, sharing her political views or giving updates about her work life – she is on top of her social media game.",
