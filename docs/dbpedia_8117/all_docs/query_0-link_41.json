        "text": "This long weekend, sit with your favourite snacks and beverages and binge on Taj Mahal 1989.\n\nI am so glad that Netflix has started churning our good content keeping in mind Indian audience and nuances typical of our country and melting pot culture. In 1989, India went through socio-political changes that in various ways impacted the generations to come. It started with the murder of Safdar Hasmi by INC goons which many busy assuming that only one political party in India plays dirty games seems to have forgotten conveniently. Sachin Tendulkar played his debut match in 1989; Maine Pyar Kiya released in the same year. It was also the year the Berlin wall collapsed and Ayatollah Khomeini issued a Fatwa against Salman Rushdie. All in all it was an era pre internet, dating sites and dating apps like Tinder.\n\nIt is the love story of four couples, college politics, mid-life crisis and friendship that stood test of time and borderline jealousy.\n\nPushpendra Nath Misra, the series creator has woven many tender moments in a very well written story line. Of the four couples perhaps it is easier to identify with philosophy professor Akhtar Baig (played brilliantly by Neeraj Kabi) and his physics professor wife Sarita (played equally brilliantly by Geetanjali Kulkarni). I said easier because given I am in my 40s and have been married to the same guy for 12 years I could identify with the couple who love each other but end up being at loggerheads while trying to navigate life and adulating. It was also much of a relief to see a man bawling his heart out in front of the local lawyer while filing divorce under mutual consent instead of the wife and the wife fixing electrical plugs while the husband keeps harping shayyari. These are small moments that break stereotype instead of hyping it up.\n\nThe couple played by Danish Hussain and Sheeba Chadda who play Sudhakar Misra and Mumtaz respectively, is perhaps most tender. There are so many like Sudhakar and Mumtaz who in their own way break all the society inflicted shackles and tries to live their life with dignity and hard work only to be defeated by fate. And how despite how ill-fated the couple is, one still believes in doing the right thing.\n\nThe show features a bunch of youngsters trying to find their way in love and life as they attend college. There is Paras Priyadarshan playing the good looking, hot tempered Dharam, Anshul Chauhan playing the bubbly pretty Rashmi who learns to let go and stand up against violence in relationships as the show progress and Anud Singh Dhaka who plays the witty and deeply caring Angad who reminded me of a younger Ranveer Singh.\n\nThe series could have fleshed out the younger characters better and the camera could have stopped focussing on Camel Geometry box and other non-living objects to prove it is indeed 1989.\n\nNear the end of the series, the ever squabbling couple visits Taj Mahal where Akhtar tells Sarita, it looks pink in the morning, white in the afternoon and golden at night. So even when the most well-known monument of love never looks the same, is it fair to expect love to remain unaltered? Taj Mahal 1989 may not be the most poignant or grand love story you have watched but the story is very relatable (buying cakes from local bakery, rickshaw rides, students making fun of profs and their lack of sex, a rich guy pretending to be a communist just to win over a college mate ‚Äì it is all there, the way the world functioned once) and has powerhouse performances.\n\nThus, go binge üôÇ\n\nOnce in a while, rarely to be precise, you end up watching a television show with zero expectations which stays with you weeks after it ran its course. Quicksand, the Swedish 6 episode series available on Netflix, is based on the novel by the same name.\n\nIt starts with stark visuals of a shootout in a school. The initial few minutes establish that there is blood all over a young survivor ( at that point you do not know whether it is her own blood) and the audience comes face to face with Maja Norburg, an intelligent, beautiful 18 year old from a well off family. Maja along with her lover Sebastian is on trial for the multiple murders. With Sebastian dead, wherein Maja shoots Sebastian fatally possibly in self-defence, Maja is left to face justice alone. The law firm that takes her case up looks confident but as viewer you wonder how can someone get off unpunished from something so grave ‚Äì after all whichever corner of the world you live in news about mass shootings in schools trickle in and leaves its bloody marks on your heart.\n\nThe show unfolds slowly in a non-linear format and keeps moving between flashbacks and the present. The protagonist admits the murder at an early stage but denies the crime ‚Äì the entire trial and the series is about why than whether murder was committed. At the beginning, it is difficult to like Maja. She looks utterly shocked and confused when the police nab her but her insolence refuses you to feel anything but contempt for her when the series starts. Maja is shown to be suffering from PTSD and there are blank patches in her story. However since the story is told mainly from her pov, you get to understand the world she inhabits ‚Äì rich parents with little time for their children, very little parental interference even when they can see that the child is going down a nasty slope, the adult world these teenagers navigate without the emotional bandwidth, self-absorbed friends and entitled classmates who attend drug fuelled parties like it is part of school curriculum / homework. As the show progresses, Maja wants to keep holding onto her past which is strength and flaw both, to her well-developed character. There is phenomenal change in her as a person within the span of time when she meets Sebastian and who she becomes as a result of the relationship with him.\n\nMaja keeps asking a lot of ‚Äòwhy‚Äô throughout the 5 episodes. Why Sebastian did choose her? Why did she stay when everything was falling apart? And as a viewer you ask those questions in your head too.\n\nSebastian Fagerman, is a rather grey character. The handsome, charismatic son of one of the richest man in Sweden, he sweeps Maja off her feet. There are yachts and an entire team at the disposal of these teenagers, weekends are for Paris, they jet set to Africa just to shoot some hapless animal (trophy hunting). But all these entitlements aside, there is no emotional connect between Sebastian and his elder brother and father. Sebastian has enough pocket money to throw the most lavish parties in town which includes expensive drugs and hookers. All this as a 17 year old! He is so far gone wallowing in self-pity and the concoction of drugs he uses that he does not even care for Maja (the one person who possibly genuinely cares) and he steadfastly refuses to focus on a future path; his father often drops the hint that he can get him enrolled in any expensive career course he wants.\n\nThere are moments of deep tenderness in this roller coaster ride. There is a scene where Maja has a breakdown and the female guard comes to hold her hand ‚Äì a very unlike prison guard but a very humane thing to do to a young, 18 year old. Then there is that poignant moment when Maja‚Äôs best friend‚Äôs, Amanda‚Äôs mother is called as a witness. The shootout resulted in Amanda‚Äôs death among others. Maja and Amanda met each other at pre-school, became friends that extended to include the respective families over years wherein Amanda‚Äôs mother openly states she loves Maja as a daughter. The prosecutor asks if she believes Maja killed her daughter and the mother says, ‚ÄúNo. She is not capable of killing Amanda‚Äù. Imagine organising your daughter who had a bright life ahead, her funeral and then few weeks later looking at the child who possibly accidentally shot her and still doing the right thing as an adult ‚Äì not putting blame on her for something with such devastating consequence.\n\nMaja is a complex character to play. A teenager who does not trust her own parents especially her mother, dotes only on a much younger sister, sniggers when she describes the teacher who was shot to death as someone who thought ‚Äúrock concerts could save the world from war, famine and disease‚Äù and exclaims that her bff Amanda was so superficial that ‚ÄúWhen she watched YouTube videos about the world‚Äôs fattest man leaving his house for the first time in thirty years she would say ‚ÄòSshh! Not now! I‚Äôm watching the news.‚Äù She oscillates between being the uber cool teenager who had it all and the hunted animal that has nowhere to run and hide and all that she has endured including being raped now out for all to see and discuss. Hanna Ard√©hn‚Äôs phenomenal performance made it so believable and human.\n\nThose of us not clued into Swedish legal system may find the way the trial went a little too one dimensional. However, the main characters have a wide arc and able performances by most of them lifts this series few notches up. Add good storytelling and good cinematography (you can see stark difference in the way American and European series are shot and I love the latter) to that.\n\nGo watch it. It encourages you to look at crimes committed by young people from different perspective and showcases the grey zone that exists in humans. Maja keeps making poor choices in life, the parents whether Maja‚Äôs, Sebastian‚Äôs or Amanda‚Äôs seem to have very little control, no one clearly states whether Sebastian behaved the way he did was because of mental illness that was never addressed ‚Äì it makes you fill in the blanks yourself. But it makes you think. What if the entitled teenagers leading this wild life had another chance to grow up differently? And does the society judge spoilt rich brats more harshly just because superficially they seem to have it going for them?\n\nNote: All pictures used in this blog has been taken from the Internet.\n\n****************\n\n‚ÄòHannibal‚Äô created by Bryan Fuller is macabre. It is also rather ambitious as a TV series that takes you into the dark minds and wood panelled, richly upholstered lavish sitting rooms where some of the main characters spend considerable time conversing albeit with a an unknown chilly feeling lurking in the atmosphere. Even when they smile, the feeling that you need to look back to check everything is alright is paramount. This is series where murders are beautiful and poetic with dynamic music adding to the atmosphere (composed by Brian Reitzell) chilling and comforting the viewer alternatively; a series that is overall inescapable. Will Graham, the troubled FBI profiler is played by Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelson plays his nemesis cum friend cum sometimes life coach Hannibal Lecter, who also moonlights as a forensic psychiatrist.\n\nFuller had once stated in RogerEbert.com that when he hires directors for this series he tells them ‚ÄúThis is NOT an episode for television. This is a pretentious art film‚Äù. Given most people have watched Silence of the Lambs and a lot of suspense seekers are familiar with the work of Thomas Harris, it has not been an easy journey to recreate. But it has been totally worth it!\n\nWhen you don‚Äôt want your mind to grasp that a corpse was actually carved into a cello and the vocal chords were ‚Äòplayed‚Äô or when Dr. Fredrick‚Äôs gut was carved out of his abdomen while he was still conscious, you focus on Mads Mikkelsen‚Äôs cheek bones. He has that perfect chiseled face, he is aloof like a demi-God watching the world pass by from a distance, is as sophisticated as they come (you will swoon at his well fitted suits) he plays uncommon musical instruments and is a sitting member Baltimore philharmonic orchestra‚Äôs board of directors. As a gourmand, when he presents a liver or a heart (of a human he has artistically killed of course) with flourish to his unsuspecting house guests, you do not know whether to feel good about plating or cringe because you know what ingredients went in making that delectable dish! And trust me the dish looks inviting. The cinematography is THAT good.\n\nMost episodes have some or other breath taking cooking montage, you start feeling a little hungry but then the guilt comes with it too; I have reflected on my own food choices while I watch this series wide eyed ‚Äì if I can kill a hapless chicken and devour drumsticks why can‚Äôt Hannibal Lecter kill a member of the human community ‚Äì after all meat is meat. The series, unlike others like Dexter, does not take a moral stand or justifies Hannibal‚Äôs cannibal instinct. For one of his well-known, few chosen ones can attend dinner parties Hannibal actually goes through a stack of business cards of those who have annoyed him; he remorselessly focuses on the perfect cuts of meat to make the dinner a success.\n\nCrimes are staged like art exhibits. A forensic expert is dissected; a judge blinded, some repurposed as mushroom farms and so on. There is no gender sadism in this series, no woman is raped like common criminal stories/ series but there is art in the killings. Victims‚Äô shoulder blades are spread as wings! As a viewer you gobble the grandeur, the fairy tale like sequence of the stag which Will sees often and you feel ashamed that you have started waiting for Hannibal to do something more atrocious in an aesthetic way every weekday night when you have your ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô date with him. You just can‚Äôt look away.\n\nThere is Gillian Anderson, poised and sexy in her golden halo hair and burgundy figure hugging dresses speaking calmly to Hannibal who for a change is on the couch as a patient not a practitioner. Laurence Fishburne, Richard Armitage and a host of other actors capably lift this into an extraordinaire tale.\n\nHannibal sheds his ‚Äòperson suit‚Äô from time to time to allow himself to be perceived as ‚Äònormal‚Äô, don‚Äôt we all? Watch is just for Mads Mikkelson if nothing else; he has devoured Hannibal as a character, he made me forget Hopkins ‚Äì that is some ‚Äòacting‚Äô.\n\nHannibal airs at 11 pm IST on AXN.\n\nRight now as I write this, Indian news landscape is filled with one of the biggest bank fraud case ‚Äì the INR 11,300 crore PNB scam with high flying diamond merchants ‚Äì Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi at the helm. I will keep the masterminds aside and focus on the bank employees who were part of this grand heist. Mr. Gokulnath Shetty‚Äôs name shines bright as the Deputy Managaer who aided this siphoning followed by some other lower ranking staff.\n\nWhat makes employees who work for an organisation that takes care of them go rogue so badly? These are people who share a coffee, lunch, greetings (seasonal and regular ones) with their unsuspecting colleagues knowing fully well that when the cover blows it will impact even the innocent parties. How do these people sleep at night? And once they have done the bidding for their masters who comes to save them? Do they have the clout to move away from the country and reside in some fancy part of the globe shrugging off something as big as this like it‚Äôs just a minor deviation from plain vanilla work days?\n\nAldrich Ames, is the central character of ABC 8 part mini-series ‚ÄòThe Assets‚Äô. Similar in tone to Le Carre‚Äôs novels, this is the story of a man who at the time of his arrest had compromised maximum number of CIA assets in the history of moles. A bespectacled, very unlike our charming James Bond, Ames was a CIA officer/ counterintelligence analyst turned KGB mole.\n\nFilmed in Lithunia, with stellar performances by its lead actors ‚Äì Jodie Whittaker, Paul Rhys, Harriet Walter, Stuart Milligan, Julian Ovenden, Christina Cole, Ralph Brown, the show has a non glamourous washed out look, giving the viewers a sense of life in, around and behind iron curtains.\n\nNY times stated ‚ÄúThe British must be better liars, for they are always chosen to play Americans on American TV shows‚Äù.\n\nMr. Ames had reasons to become a traitor. He loved his drinks and his second wife whom he met while posted in Mexico City who had v-e-r-y expensive tastes. Viewers know from the onset who the mole is. The intriguing part about the TV series (Rhys as the sweaty, awkward Ames even looks rather like the original sinner) is not why Ames did what he did; it is how a supposedly smart organisation like CIA for the longest time could not figure out who the mole was! And Ames left enough clumsy clues in his wake.\n\nSeems people do walk around with eyes wide shut. In banks and in spy agencies. The irony of it lies there.\n\nAldrich Ames has been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1994, without parole.\n\nAssets is on air in the Indian subcontinent at Zee Caf√© at 10 pm.\n\nImages sourced from internet : Bangalore mirror, pinterest, moviefone, tvseriesfinale.com and Nirav Modi signature line.\n\nI devour crime thrillers and the television series and films that are made on them. Maigret, a British television series by ITV, is aired every Friday at 10 pm on Zee HD in association with BBC first.\n\nSet in 1950s Paris, based on George Simenon‚Äôs novels featuring French detective Jules Maigret or Maigret to most people including his spouse, played very ably by the 60 plus Rowan Atkinson.\n\nThe 90 minutes episodes are pure visual treat and capture the long gone era with brilliant camerawork and painstaking detailing. If you are a nostalgia junkie like me, the period detailing, intricate lace curtains on doors, whiskey tumblers, the lampshades, the doilies, the upholstery, it will suck you in and weave its spell. Shot in Budapest and Szentendre, it is a world where detection is done without a lot of gadgets we are used to reading and seeing as second skin in contemporary crime series and our daily lives. The crimes, some especially gruesome especially when you have a ten year old seeing her mother tied to a chair in their own living room, breasts being burned with candle before slitting her throat and letting her bleed to death is spine curdling ‚Äì have the same motivations as it has been for ages ‚Äì money, lust, power, revenge, frustration and so on.\n\nMaigret has been described in the novels as broad shouldered, large statured, gruff man who Rowan Atkinson is definitely not but he wears the character so well that one forgets he is Mr. Bean. Since this is first time I am watching Maigret I have no pre conceived notion as to which actor was more suited (this role has been played by ten actors including Atkinson ‚Äì 76 novels after all!) like I do when it comes to Chief Inspector Barnaby or our Indian home grown Feluda.\n\nThe ruminative, unhurried in his gestures, pipe smoking sleuth or to be precise the commissaire of the Paris ‚ÄúBrigade Criminelle is an ordinary man doing an extraordinary job and doing it well one may add üôÇ\n\nJeremy Gwilt, the producer of Maigret, acknowledges that they thought long and hard about Atkinson‚Äôs comic heritage. ‚ÄúWe had a discussion about every single aspect of his performance ‚Äì intonation, gesture, walk, anything that might give Rowan away as Mr Bean or Blackadder. We made sure we were creating something absolutely brand new. That‚Äôs how we dealt with people‚Äôs anticipation.‚Äù (Quoted in an article in Independent, UK by James Rampton, 12th April, 2017)\n\nThere are some very poignant moments reiterating that no matter what profession we choose being a considerate human being should be our first responsibility. Maigret is aware a certain woman has been complicit in a few gruesome murders and yet requests the Nurse in a hospital to keep some flowers in that woman‚Äôs room because she has given birth to a baby a day back and the room is cold. Or when he reaches out to hold the hand of a young child because he knows how difficult it will be for her to identify her parents‚Äô killer as he showcases her specific photographs.\n\nMr. Atkinson is supported competently by Lucy Cohu who plays Madame Maigret and the actors playing the faithful four, Maigret‚Äôs core team in our modern day corporate parlance. Even the extras do a thorough job in this series. Watch it if you want to enjoy old world charm, well shot scenes, an unhurried storytelling, good acting and the cobbled streets and cozy cafes which form the perfect backdrop.\n\n***********\n\nBirdman is an ascent (and I have intentionally stayed away from descent) to madness. It is refreshing for viewers like moi who prefer heavy on dialogues and layered storylines. Let me set the expectations, this film is not for everyone and some of you may even find this pretentious crap. But those who have internalized the existential crisis where life imitates art and art imitates life will find this worthwhile.\n\nI admire I√±√°rritu‚Äôs work. Right from Amores Perros, 21 grams, Babel followed by Biutiful, he has never disappointed me. Will this move him in the Scorsese, Eastwood league? I√±√°rritu‚Äôs ‚ÄúBirdman‚Äù is a celebration of cinema. It‚Äôs an audacious achievement that where he (over)familiarizes us with the theater stage and backstage. He makes the surroundings a living, breathing character for us to know, understand and enjoy.\n\nA satire on showbiz, it is the story of an aging, washed up actor Riggan Thomspon (Micheal Keaton who has given his all in this role), well known decades back for playing a superhero. Riggan‚Äôs fault is he‚Äôs deeply ashamed of ‚Äòselling out‚Äô years earlier when he took on his superhero role and he wants to redeem himself by attempting to mount a ‚Äòserious‚Äô Broadway play. Riggan hopes to reinvent his career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver‚Äôs short story ‚ÄúWhat We Talk About When We Talk About Love‚Äú. But his Birdman persona, a shadowy figure from his past, keeps appearing in the form of a disembodied voice and later hallucinations, goading him into believing that he will fail.\n\nThere are a host of characters surrounding Riggan. His manager cum producer cum friend who is hassled enough to dangle impossible carrots to make the show work (Zach Galifinakis) , his ex-wife (Amy Ryan) who still cares in spite of the threatening with knife episode, an estranged daughter (Emma Stone) who pulls a credible ‚ÄòI am fucked up‚Äô routine but is the most sane voice in the film and of course the other actors in Riggan‚Äôs (Edward Norton, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough)play.\n\nWhile the film on one hand is a like a commentary on Keaton‚Äôs own history in Batsuit, the real story is focused on personal matters; artistic temperament, troubled relationships, integrity, fragility of the term success, Hollywood vis a vis Broadway and of course how one defines and talks about love.\n\nA truth and dare game does its round at some point between two of the main characters. And it suddenly hits you that this rather teenager-ish game can have such deep revelations if played with all honesty. There are insecure actresses who appear selfish but at one weak moment when they crack you can see the little girl they were once. There is a method actor, very good at his job, generally being too confident who when asked in a cramped smoker‚Äôs zone, ‚Äúhow does it feel to pretend to be someone else in front of an audience every night?‚Äù answers without blinking that ‚ÄúI pretend everywhere else BUT not on stage‚Äù. There are various such deep moments which makes you stop and ponder.\n\nYou see, everything in this movie happens inside the theatre where it is shot. People scream at each other, realize they are not suited for each other, make love in cramped alleys, discuss how terrible they would be as parents while doing their make-up, trying on costumes and rehearsing their parts.\n\nThe entire film is shot as if it‚Äôs one long take in a cinema verit√© style. Perhaps the best thing about the film is the behind-the-scenes peek at the technical aspects of a Broadway theater production. Emmanuel Lubezki, take a bow. You can‚Äôt watch a movie shot by the Academy Award winning Cinematographer and not find yourself drawn intimately to the realm of movies. A year after stunning us with ‚ÄúGravity‚Äù, Lubezki, takes the audience inside the movie where they are present in every scene, every movement, and every thought that a person is having. We feel as though Riggan and the cast are interacting with us. When they‚Äôre laugh, we laugh, when they cry, we cry. Lubezki used the Alexa M for hand held sequences thus allowing h the camera to get into tiny spaces and close to the actor, sometimes 2 inches from the actor‚Äôs face.\n\nI personally adore Zach Galifinakis in the man-child roles he has played but yes he has so much more to offer as an actor. Edward Norton and Emma Stone have delivered stellar performances. But above all Birdman (forget the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is about a father, actor, husband, lover who is NOT superhero; just a regular guy with his flaws and madness.\n\nAnd yes, how different people aspire, define and accept love when they talk about Love.\n\nIs it possible to fall in love with a man 12 years after his death? Or to be more particular with one of the character he played onscreen while alive? Am not referring to the heart beats faster, must buy expensive Valentine‚Äôs Day gift, type, but where the deep admiration of his genius slowly wraps itself around you like a comfortable and favourite from the memories woven into it, patchwork blanket?\n\nI chanced upon Inspector Morse, 2 months back, while navigating the array of free goodies YouTube offers. Must be providence; I actually clicked on ‚ÄòDead of Jericho‚Äù ‚Äì the first of 33 episodes of the splendid Inspector Morse series that was broadcast in 1987 in the UK. And 27 years later as I sat through the nearly two hour episode, I realized what I have missed all these years.\n\nMy entire teenage and 20s were spent on a staple diet of American TV shows with crime series (but obviously) on top of priority list. Once upon a time, I was the most ardent Remington Steele fan. Most of those series involved fast cars, cocky cops/ detectives, everyone in the cast had near perfect physique and extra white teeth, numerous racy car chases to add to the ‚Äòthrill‚Äô factor and some canned humour thrown in at the right moment.\n\nWhy and how did Morse ‚Äì the grumpy, graying man with an old fashioned view of women and pedantic about grammar, get so close to my heart? I guess versatile, talented actors can do that to you; after all therein lies the headiness that art forms provide. Or maybe deep down, I do have a father figure obsession; shrink and close friends have always said so, I have diligently ignored. A picnic date by the river side, basking in the winter sun reading out favourite quotes to each other seems so much more attractive a proposition that hanging out with the regular hunks.\n\nMorse grew on me like good wines do in a blind tasting session. You are a little skeptical at first; after all you know nothing about the liquid being poured out from the black glass, but as you put aside your mind block and soak in the aroma and relish the after taste, you realize THIS is it!\n\nMorse is one of those whose idiosyncrasies make you smirk inwardly when you initially meet them, but over a period you start finding comfort in those same quirks; you actually start relating to some of them.\n\nSlightly balding and cerebral, Morse is a senior CID officer with the Thames Valley Police force in Oxford who famously drives a bright red Jaguar, has a thing for crossword puzzles and likes ‚Äòreal‚Äô British ale; he completely sniggers if offered canned beer! Morse also has ‚Äòhighbrow‚Äô passions ‚Äì music (especially opera; Mozart and Wagner which he often listens in his car audio or Roksan Xerxes record player), poetry, art, classics and Shakespeare. He appreciates real ink (the nostalgia junkie in me is highly impressed) and often makes his sidekick Lewis pay for the beer while investigating a case.\n\nIn fact, many of his cases touch on Morse‚Äôs interests and it is his deep knowledge on certain subjects that helps solve them. He understands the importance of the rule of law and justice, the interests of which he always puts ahead of gain or personal advancement. Sometimes he openly sneers at his boss (I mean we all have done that once in a while) but respects him in his own way. He is said to have graduated from Oxford and can be considered rather laid back. He ignores forensic science throughout the series (imagine what would Kay Scarpetta think!) and cannot stand the sight of blood. I have never met an onscreen detective who is so against the stereotype!\n\n************\n\nThe series,beautifully filmed in and around photogenic Oxford, has intelligent scripts and are based on a series of award-winning novels by Colin Dexter as well as some original television stories. The episodes are has complex plots, (the studio did hire good writers and screen players) has sufficient suspects and red herrings and deals with themes in the way good literature always has. And yes, the support case, each and every one does a brilliant job.\n\nFew television series can truthfully be called a phenomenon. Morse can.\n\nSome actors remain etched forever because of that one role which defines them. In case of John Thaw his greatest was being Chief Inspector Morse. He played the role with aplomb from 1987 ‚Äì 2000. The character died from a heart attack in, The Remorseful Day, published in 1999. He died on-screen in 2000. Thaw died two years later. Plain co- incidence I suppose?\n\nWhen first approached to play Morse, Thaw read one of Colin Dexter‚Äôs novels and decided he didn‚Äôt like the man much. But then he began to realize there were some subtle things that really appealed to him, especially Morse‚Äôs love of classical music and opera. ‚ÄúI love music,‚Äù said Thaw, ‚Äúand I listen to it the way Morse does. It helps me to think, to learn my lines. I thought that was a pretty good indication of what kind of guy he was. That was the key for me‚Äù, as he stated in an interview.\n\nThaw had a special appreciation (and so did I) of the fact that Morse was different from classic detectives such as Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes. Morse, though above average brilliant, was not always right. He sometimes arrested the wrong person or came to the wrong conclusion. As a result, unlike classic sleuths, Morse does not always simply arrest his culprit; ironic circumstances have the case end and the crime brought to him. Morse, though not capable of a steady relationship, was a romantic at heart; he did mildly flirt with colleagues, witnesses or suspects‚Äîoccasionally bordering on the unprofessional, but had little success in finding true love.\n\nAnd his voice; there is something deeply resonating about his voice. Not the Amitabhish rich baritone but his voice is indeed fantastic and Thaw was capable of taking the stories to another level with it.\n\nAuthor Colin Dexter sensed the public‚Äôs love for Thaw‚Äôs Morse and never cared that the actor didn‚Äôt resemble the man on the printed page much. At its peak, the series attracted more than 18 million viewers in the UK, and the show was sold to some 200 countries. So pleased was Dexter with Thaw‚Äôs rendition of Morse that, Dexter‚Äôs will clearly states that no one apart from Thaw can play Morse ever!\n\nAfter playing Morse for several seasons, Thaw took on a genuine proprietary interest in the show, though he didn‚Äôt own any part of it. In the final years, he negotiated the title of ‚Äúexecutive producer‚Äù for himself by involving his own production company with the program. Though quite common in the U.S., where the stars of long-running TV series often begin to ‚Äútake over‚Äù their show, that move was extremely rare in British television.\n\n*********\n\nThere is a prequel ‚ÄòEndeavour‚Äô portraying a young Morse which has aired few episodes (2012, ‚Äô13 and ‚Äô14). Yes that was Morse‚Äôs first name. I do not want to know whether Shaun Evans fits the bill as Morse or whether a younger Morse looks appealing with a head full of blond hair. Set in 1965, Evans plays the young Detective Constable Morse, who as he prepares to hand in his resignation becomes embroiled in an investigation involving a missing schoolgirl.\n\nTo me, Morse will always be the magnificent John Thaw and vice versa. The dignified looking man who showed unexpected bouts of kindness and respect to fellow humans, often quoted from his favourite classics, and sang in the choir. Some performances are timeless.\n\nThank you for letting me the pleasure of knowing you Mr. Morse. I so wish I could have met you for real in this lifetime and discussed quotes. And art. And literature. While we basked in eternal sunshine.\n\n*********\n\nHow does an individual feel when she is expected to develop rather intimate relations with another person to help accomplish a third person‚Äôs goals? A carefully woven web, where she is made to feel important but her dilemma and emotions are ruthlessly side tracked for a bigger picture.\n\nViolated? Powerful? Sorry? How does it feel to be a honeytrap?\n\nEva Delectorskaya felt all three as she ran out of the discreet, posh hotel room post being photographed in a compromising position with a powerful US senator. As she hurriedly buttons herself up, checks her makeup and hair at the foot of the stairs, the camera catches the emotions in her eyes ‚Äì that of an animal caught in a net. No matter how nonchalant Eva acts she knows deep down that she will live and die a spy.\n\nOne, who systematically indulges in betrayal to prove her loyalty.\n\nFew figures throughout history are as compelling as female spies. Whether you think of them as sleuths or femme fatales, most of them have been exceptionally brave and have done things for the country/ regime they believed in which we cannot even imagine emulating.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì\n\nI came across Restless (a two part miniseries) created for BBC1 based on William Boyd‚Äôs novel by the same name, recently as I meandered aimlessly on the virtual sphere. It was time well spent üôÇ\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nThere are 2 parallel stories going on set 35 years apart.\n\nIt starts with a rather fetching in a hippie avatar young woman Ruth played by Michelle Dockery (of downtown Abbey fame) visiting her mother with her young son. The mother played with elan by Charlotte Rampling (age I can see has increased her beauty manifold!) lives in a country cottage with empty stretches all around. Pure, far from maddening crowd set up. It seems like an idyllic setting for a little break for Ruth and her son, when one evening Ruth‚Äôs mom pushes a file in her direction and informs her that someone is lurking around waiting for an opportune moment to kill her.\n\nRuth laughs her off. I mean people who are getting old sometimes say odd things and you need not take them seriously even if she is your mother.\n\nThe name on the file says Eva Delectorskaya; Ruth soon learns that her mother has all along lead a double life! She is in fact a Russian girl Eva who was WWII spy for Britain. Along with Ruth the audience are taken back to the early 1940s. Hayley Atwell as the young Eva is pure delight ‚Äì transporting herself rather believably from the innocent emigrant girl who was devastated by her young brother‚Äôs death to the professional spy who can kill someone by simply jabbing them in the eye with a sharp pencil. And then take that pencil out without batting an eyelid as blood oozes out making the death look like a mere fatal accident.\n\nEva was initiated to the world of Mata Hari with the best advice ‚Äì a) Never trust anyone and b) Never assume anything as a co incidence by her mentor Lucas Romer played by a suave Rufus Sewell.\n\nThe action moves between Paris, Scotland, fictitious Dutch border own, USA and part of SA and of course Britain. The twists and turns keep you engaged. And yes, like in a well done spy thriller there is love, betrayal and revenge. At some point Ruth gets dragged in her mother‚Äôs war; the mother she believed was nothing but a perfect English homemaker. The mother was at some point everything but it. And someone who could not let her past go. What if one day I come to know my parents are not really who I thought they were? I think I will freak. Ruth was far more stoic (in her expressions as well !) Should we involve our children in our past? And even if we do, how much of the past still matters? There are far bigger questions involved in the plot that does not get addressed in the film. Those are for conversations over cocktails as my blog name suggests üòâ\n\nA lot of detailing, good cinematography and above all superb casting make it an enjoyable watch. The plot has some loopholes but that‚Äôs because I read too many crime thrillers.\n\nOh and for us Indians there is a serious DDLJ moment when Eva desperately wants the man she loved to turn around and give her a backward glance J\n\nGo, get yourself some wine and watch it over the weekend.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nPS: There is an instance where Eva looking fetching in a polka dotted dress, white rimmed sunglass and heels waits for an important package in a barren land, smoking one cigarette after another while her car is at least a mile off on the highway. She is not harmed at any point. In fact she returns safe and sound back to her motel. We live in a non -war era. I wondered how many women can replicate that in today‚Äôs context and come home safe.\n\nA personal note: I watched Blue Jasmine and Queen in the same week. Both have female protagonists trying to move on with their lives. The former is based in America, a country I have never visited. I have very limited all American friends. The later, Queen is about a girl from Delhi. Having lived and loved Delhi, I could not relate to the central character in Q (apparently there are real girls in 21st century who introduce themselves as ‚ÄòMyself Rani from Rajouri!) at all while every 15 minutes there would be a sense of d√©j√† vu as I watched Blue Jasmine.\n\nI guess that is the power of good cinema and flawless performance. It makes you one of their own. Even if you do not belong to the land they hail from. This is the kind of film I wish was made more. This one will stay with me. For a long, long time.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nWe first meet Jasmine, dressed nattily in pearls and a Chanel jacket, talking in a slightly high handed manner to her fellow passenger. Soon after, though, she stands with her monogrammed luggage on a nondescript San Francisco sidewalk, looking frightened, alone and someone who could benefit from some kindness. Instead, she waves off a stranger and asks the most existential and practical, question in a demanding manner, ‚ÄúWhere am I, exactly?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòWhere am I, exactly in the bigger picture called life? This is so relevant in the world I inhabit. Most humans including me seem to be suffering from perpetual existential crisis. I hop jobs, cities, trying to belong somewhere; I know others who even hop relationships as the question keeps playing in a loop in our mind.\n\nA former Park Avenue socialite, she had shed her unexciting past life and name from Jeantte to Jasmine (sounds much more exotic) to marry the wealthy Hal Francis. Hal is played superbly by Alec Baldwin who looks every inch an investment banker type, slippery, suave with all smiles and no soul.\n\nAs Allen moves the story between past and present, we see that Jasmine‚Äôs full of branded clothes and accessorised life consisting of talked about parties, vacations in the most coveted destinations, turns upside down following her husband‚Äôs imprisonment (he was after all a smooth talking swindler) and subsequent suicide. The government took him, and then it took the rest, leaving Jasmine with little more than her designer threads and luggage. Thus humbled, Jasmine finds herself forced to park her Louis Vuitton luggage in the incompatible surroundings of her adoptive sister‚Äôs San Francisco apartment. When she first walks into Ginger‚Äôs apartment, she stops dead, as if paralyzed by its unspeakable middle- classness.\n\nThe destruction begins as she tried to rebuild her life supported by alcohol and Xanax and her ordinary, mother of two, working sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins). Jasmine is finally out of her depth as she swings between ill-fitting employment, ill-judged social climbing and abysmal interpersonal relations clutching to her Channel jackets as life saving oxygen.\n\nThere was once a girl who had to ‚Äòmove on‚Äô with life trying to find her foothold in a very competitive new city still reeling from an all-consuming personal tragedy aided with alcohol and prescribed anti-depressants. In her case, there were a lot of genuine well-wishing friends and her aunt and uncle. Maybe if Jasmine had a bigger support group, her story would be different? I muse as I watch her spiralling out of control. I can empathize with her fear. Jasmine masks that by overwhelming anyone willing to listen with grandiose stories of the opulent life she once led.\n\nThe film draws deep from the well of ‚ÄòStreetcar named desire‚Äô. Yes, Ginger‚Äôs boyfriend Chili is the blue collared, cool hairdo ‚ÄòBrando‚Äô here. Mr. Allen has managed to turn a somewhat borrowed storyline into an exquisite tragic drama where he has replaced the sexual tension from Tennessee Williams‚Äô iconic play and replaced it with lust for power and position.\n\nAs a delusional and mutters-to-herself Jasmine, Cate Blanchett has simply inhabited the character in a monster of a performance borrowed from Vivien Leigh and Katharine Hepburn to create a character that‚Äôs terrifying yet heart wrenching. She had of course played Blanche DuBois in Liv Ullmann‚Äôs acclaimed stage production, prompting the New York Times to proclaim that ‚Äúthe lady who lives for illusion has never felt more real‚Äù. Blanchett glows with old-world charm in scenes set during Jasmine‚Äôs better times, her voice taking an affected New England tone, looking beautiful with a perpetual glint of loss in her eye. In scenes where she begins to finally doubt her husband we see fear in her eyes which is immediately replaced by denial, whether in the shape of a bracelet or sex. Tennessee Williams sent his Blanche into the abyss, Allen sends his Jasmine to the magical world where she always longed to be.\n\nThe climactic confrontation between Jasmine and Hal, takes place in their living room, a shrine to their wealth, where against the colour of money (the walls are green), they fight for their lives taking swings at each other without a thought to everyone else they are about to take down. In Blue Jasmine, there is a paradoxical game being played with haves and have nots, detailing how Jasmine, for all her cushion of wealth, lacks everything that matters ‚Äì love, inner peace, real security.\n\nAnd I know quite a few who are on the same path ‚Äì engulfed in all that which will not matter in the end.\n\nWith time it becomes clear that, while losing her money helped push Jasmine over the edge, it was also the easy money that drove her nuts to begin with. What did Jasmine know, and when did she know it? These questions come to haunt ‚ÄúBlue Jasmine,‚Äù and as the past catches up with the present, they help drive this moving film toward its shattering end.\n\nSally Hawkins is earnest, Peter Saarsgaard the perfect political ladder climber, Sally‚Äôs boys chubby, cartoonish and in a way surreal. But it is Cate with her stellar performance stands so tall that you only remember her.\n\nShe is just brilliant as the anti-heroine and delivers the kind of performance we film lovers live for.\n\nAs for Woody, this film reconfirms that his greatest triumphs may yet lie ahead.\n\nI wish the story had a somewhat happy ending. But life is not always fair to everyone.\n\nI chanced upon this film out of the blue and realized it is always good to catch a not over hyped, light film with an inherent interesting message. The message in the film, the old Arabian tale of Aladin‚Äôs magic lamp set in contemporary Calcutta, is simple yet profound. The gadget freak genie informs his disillusioned, heartbroken owner at some point that ‚ÄúRupkothay sobta bola thake na‚Äù or ‚Äònot everything is mentioned in fairy tales‚Äô.\n\nWe all just prefer to look at the bright side of a tale, but each has its dark corners which raises its ugly head from time to time.\n\nAschorjo Pradip based on Shirshendu Mukhopadhya‚Äôs story has been adapted as an adult fable with witty dialogues, sarcasm and believable protagonists by the director Anik Dutta (of Bhuter Bhobisyat fame). Anil (Saswata Chatterjee in a spectacled, relevant rings on his finger to improve his fate persona) and Jhumur (Sreelekha Mitra) a typical middle class Bengali couple live, aspire and fight it out on a daily basis in an overstuffed with furniture 1.5 room rented accommodation in a Bechu Dutta lane (sounds middle class enough !) house where Anil has lived all his life.\n\nThey have hazaar issues in their life and marriage ‚Äì husband does not speak enough English to appear for their son‚Äôs admission test, son wants a playstation, wife needs a brand new i10 since her sister has a bigger car, she regrets marrying him just because she liked his songs in a Pujo pandal, husband hardly sings anymore, the son pukes whenever he has to drink milk for breakfast, the husband needs to work harder to meet sales target and secretly pines for his company‚Äôs sultry Bong bombshell brand ambassador who goes by the cheeky name Mala M(aal), he turns the photograph of Baba Loknath to face the wall when he tries to cajole his wife for physical intimacy ‚Äì it is basically a household we all have seen / been to at some point in our lives.\n\nThe first half till Saswata comes across the magic lamp while helping neighbourhood kids find their cricket ball, has its good moments. Of course, if you are a Bengali, you totally get the jokes; not sure if they will come across that funny in translation.\n\nSample this: Anil late for his office, having been rejected by Taxi drivers somehow manages to get himself in a crowded bus. As the bus takes a nasty turn he nearly falls over a lady standing in front of him. Lady turns and looks at him with pure disgust. Just as she opens her mouth to say something, Anil says ‚ÄúAche‚Äù. The taant wearing lady angered beyond recognition snaps ‚ÄúKi ache?‚Äù Anil stoically replies, ‚ÄúBarite ma bon ache‚Äù.\n\nSaswata is good. I have seen him in 2-3 movies till now and have started acknowledging him as an actor who does have a range.\n\nAs expected, once the lamp is rubbed, the genie (Rajatava Dutta in a bald, blue tooth wielding plastic avatar) makes an appearance and thus starts the new, always wanted but could not afford life of Anil‚Äôs. He is able to purchase a duplex apartment in a swanky project, hangs out at the famed Golf club, and drinks premium scotch at expensive eateries, closes business deals successfully with international companies‚Äô blah blah.\n\nOf course, like all stories this ends one fine day. And not on a nice note at all. I personally found the climax interesting.\n\nYes, the film could have done away with all the songs except Charidik bodle gechhe, wherein composer Raja Narayan Deb collaborates with Amit Kumar to recreate the evergreen number sung by his legendary father Kishore Kumar, Prithibi bodle gechhe. Keeping the melody intact, the director has re-worked the lyrics. Yes, the film could have been edited better. It does drag in the second half and there are some boring stereotypes (Marwari businessman stating Bengalis are only bothered about culture, art and Tagore, a typical atheist intellectual who corrects Anil‚Äôs English pronunciation etc) but it is definitely worth a one-time watch.\n\nOne should not always look for deep, meaningful in every frame cinema. Grab a beer, get some snacks and chill today evening with Aschorjo Pradip.\n\n*************"
