        "text": "RBN Web Desk: On the day of their anniversary, a couple finds they have been accidentally locked inside a room in their apartment. There is no way the door can be opened. Their patience runs thin and after a point of time the two start blaming each other for the situation that they are in. Both bare their fangs and fissures appear in the relationship between the couple with a big age difference. The morning of their anniversary soon changes for the worse.\n\nThat in a nutshell is the story of Sabyasachi Bhowmick’s short film titled Locked. Popular TV and film actress Sreelekha Mitra and Sankhadeep Roy play the dysfunctional couple in the film. Sankhadeep plays the husband to a much older Sreelekha Mitra in the film.\n\nSrijit Mukerji to Adapt Shankar’s Chowringhee\n\nThe actress said that the script interested her to say yes to Sabyasachi. The film exposes the hypocrisy behind a so-called successful marriage, where both individuals knowingly indulge in playacting to keep each other in good humour. It shows how a couple pastes together a crumbling marriage, just to appear normal to the people around them, she added.\n\nThe 20-minute film only involves the two characters of the husband and the wife. Shooting for the film is likely to start in mid-February.\n\nChhinnamastar Abhishap Next Feluda Film: Sandip Ray\n\nSabyasachi said that he has plans to send his film to various festivals.\n\nLocked is slated to release online later this year."
