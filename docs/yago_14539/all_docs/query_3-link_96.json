        "text": "Rarely is an actor born who has such tremendous multi-faceted talent as Naseeruddin Shah. Even though he is commonly regarded as one of the pioneers of ‘New Indian Cinema’, Shah has shown distinct ability in creating a bridge between impressive arthouse fare and entertaining commercial fare. And the best part is; he seems to bridge this gap so effortlessly!\n\nNaseeruddin Shah was born on July 20, 1950 in Barabanki of Uttar Pradesh. While his father was a navy officer, he is, interestingly, also the descendant of the 19th century warlord Jan Fishan Khan. Shah completed his schooling from St. Anselm’s Ajmer and St Joseph’s College, Nainital. After completing his graduation in arts from Aligarh Muslim University in 1971, he attended National School of Drama in Delhi. He was first discovered by the legendary director Shyam Benegal. It was under the influence of Benegal that Shah went on to specialize in the off-beat genres of acting. His unparalleled expertise in subtle acting and gestures earned him impressive footing in the good-books of not only Benegal, but also other noteworthy directors like Saeed Mirza and Mrinal Sen.\n\nShah started his acting career with the 1975 film called Nishant. He then went on to act in innumerable movies in each of which he outshined all other co-actors. His most significant films include Aakrosh, Sparsh, Mirch Masala, Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Ata Hai, Trikal, Bhavni Bhavai, Junoon, Mandi, Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho!, Ardh Satya, Katha, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, etc. His performance in the role of a torn, helpless father in the film Masoom was not only critically acclaimed but also loved by the masses.\n\nNaseeruddin Shah became actively participating in the mainstream Bollywood movies starting with the 1980 film Hum Paanch. Next came the blockbuster hit called Karma. In this commercial movie he acted alongside veteran legend Dilip Kumar. Shah continued to give back-to-back hits like Ghulami (1985), Ijaazat (1987), Jalwa (1988) and Hero Hiralal (1988), Tridev (1989) and Vishwatma (1992). The year 1994 saw the release of his 100th film as an actor – Mohra. However, his capability to give outstanding hits was far from exhausted.\n\nIn 2003, he starred with the legendary Sean Connery in the Hollywood comic book adaptation of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. In the movie he played the role of Captain Nemo. The most recent milestones in his acting career include films like Maqbool, Asambhav, Ishqiya and Khuda Ke Liye. He has also directed a movie called Yun Hota To Kya Hota.\n\nHis lengthy and incomparable career in the film industry has also won him much recognition including many Filmfare Awards and National Awards. He has also been awarded the Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan by the Government of India.\n\nConnect with Siti Digital on facebook.com/sitidigital and never miss an update."
