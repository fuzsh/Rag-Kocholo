Or characters growing or characters changing or characters learning to like each other or characters overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. Y'know ? Movie shit.\"\n\nKaufman is sweating like crazy now. Valerie is quiet for a moment - from \"Adaptation\".\n\nWe are all about CINEMA. That movie shit.\n\nNOTHING is sacred.\n\nNOBODY is spared.\n\nBecause we talk about films, dammit.\n\nNot your sex life.\n\nFilms, fests, unsung, indies, undiscovered - all that and some fun. If you have dope on anything related to cinema or you would like to share something, do write to us at moifightclub@gmail.com.\n\nLike us, if you are a fan of Saaed Akhtar Mirza and his cinema, there is some good news!\n\nSaeed Akhtar Mirza is back. Almost after a decade! And is ready to roll his new film titled “Ek Tho Chance”. Its a multicast film starring Purab Kohli, Amrita Arora, Rajat Kapoor, Zafar Karachiwala, Vijay Raaz, Pawan Malhotra, Ashwini Kalsekar, Sadia Siddiqui, Saurabh Shukla and Vinay Pathak.\n\nThe film is produced by Pritish Nandy Communications (PNC).\n\nIf you have any clue about the north indian dialect, its not difficult to guess whats the deal with the “Tho” in the title of the film. Set in Mumbai, the film deals with various stories of migrant population. We are waiting and how!\n\nBtw, if you havent read his recent book Ammi : Letter to a democratic mother, do check it out. Its a compilation of monologues, dialogues ( with his mother) , essays and an interesting read for sure."
