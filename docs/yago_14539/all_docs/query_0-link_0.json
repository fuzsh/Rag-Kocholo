(transl. Summons for Mohan Joshi) is a 1984 Hindi art film, made by Saeed Akhtar Mirza, based on his own story, during the Parallel Cinema period of Indian cinema.[1]\n\nThe film is a comic satire on a judicial system, where cases drag on for decades, where plaintiffs either die or lose hope and money, while the corrupt run scot free, thanks to their nexus with corrupt lawyers.\n\nIt won the 1984 National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare.\n\nAn elderly couple, Mohan Joshi (Bhisham Sahni) and his wife (Dina Pathak), sues their landlord (Amjad Khan) for not maintaining their 'collapsing' apartment building. For this, they hire two cunning lawyers (Naseeruddin Shah and Satish Shah), while Rohini Hattangadi is the opposition lawyer.\n\nThe court case drags on for years and the lawyers milk the old couple dry, while they become rich. Back home in the society, the old couple is ridiculed for fighting the landlord, but they fight on nevertheless.\n\nIn the end, when the judge comes to check the condition of the chawl, the landlord's men prop up the place, thus convincing the judge that all is well. Finally, Joshi gathers all his strength and pulls down the temporary supports put up by the men causing the building to collapse on himself.[2]\n\nNaseeruddin Shah as Advocate Malkani\n\nBhisham Sahni as Mohan Joshi\n\nDina Pathak as Joshi's wife\n\nDeepti Naval\n\nMohan Gokhale\n\nRohini Hattangadi as Advocate\n\nPankaj Kapur as Promoter 1\n\nAmjad Khan as Kundan Kapadia, landlord\n\nSatish Shah as Advocate\n\nSalim Ghouse as Promoter 2\n\nAnjali Paigankar as Joshi's Son's girlfriend\n\nMohan Joshi Hazir Ho! was shot at Kamithapura, Bapty Road, and Duncan Road (Two Tanks/Do Tanki) at Mumbai's middle-class Hindu Muslim locality."
