When the owner of his apartment building makes it clear that he will not perform repairs, Mohan attempts to convince his fellow tenants that the only solution to their problem is to refuse to pay rent. They shy away from such drastic actions, though. Mohan then sacrifices all of his time and money in an attempt to build a legal case against his landlord, only to learn that he must sift through mountains of red tape to get a trial.",
