        "text": "Noted Indian screenwriter and director in Hindi films and television, Saeed Akhtar Mirza has called The Kashmir Files ‘garbage’.\n\nIn an interview with an Indian English newspaper, The Indian Express, Mirza said that the ‘point is not to take sides’ and added that it is necessary to ‘try to understand’ the issues.\n\n“For me, The Kashmir Files is garbage. Is the Kashmiri Pandit issue garbage? … is it just Kashmiri Hindus? No. Muslims, too, are caught in an incredibly vulgar trap of the machinations of intelligence agencies, nations with so-called national interests… The point is not to take sides. Be human and try to understand,” he said.\n\nThe propaganda film Kashmir Files, written and directed by Vivek Agnihotri, centers on the so-called exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in the early 1990s. It was screened at IFFI 2022 on November 22 under the Indian Panorama section at IFFI.\n\nSaeed Akhtar Mirza is known for films such as Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho, Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyoon Aata Hai, Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro and Naseem. He is the director of popular TV serials like Nukkad and Intezaar.—KMS"
