        "text": "by Dorottya Ruisz\n\nSome 14,000 people took part in the US cultural exchange programme between 1947 and the end of the 1950s. The programme was part of the so-called Reeducation and Reorientation of the West German population and served the so-called Containment policy. The participants were selected based on a careful procedure. Preference was given primarily to people who had a distinct potential to be a disseminator. Among them, a large number of top figures from business, politics and society can be found. School pupils and students also participated in the stays that often lasted multiple months, taking part in the so-called Teen-Age programme. Prominent participants from Bavaria included Franz Josef Strauß (CSU, 1915-1988), Baron Waldemar von Knoeringen (SPD, 1906-1971), Hildegard Hamm-Brücher (FDP, 1921-2016) and Maria Probst (CSU, 1902-1967).\n\nIn the context of the US-American re-education policy\n\nWhen the US-American occupation forces arrived in Bavaria in 1945, they saw the containment of Nazi ideology as one of their most important tasks. The aim was to replace the National Socialist world-view with a firmly established democracy. This was considered an indispensable prerequisite for long-term international understanding. Democratisation was to be accomplished through an extensive re-education programme. It covered the revision of the education system and the new regulation of religious affairs, the transfer of the cultural and media policy into pluralism, the implementation of a film, women and youth programme, the establishment of America houses and an exchange of personnel at suitable hubs.\n\nInitially, the re-education activities concentrated on the education system, mainly because the potential for influence was considered particularly high there. However, the prospects of success were limited for a number of reasons: a quick reopening of the schools was necessary to prevent the neglect of children and young people, so it was not possible to complete the replacement of all the staff and the textbooks. Additional challenges for the occupying forces were the rebuilding and equipping of school buildings, school meals and increased student numbers due to refugees and displaced persons.\n\nFurthermore, the Military Government had to deal with strong resistance towards the school reform, which was fuelled by the re-established local Education Authority (Müller, 111–288). It was unsettled by the intended “external reform”, which included an alignment with the US-American school system and its purely horizontal structure. The background for the American efforts was provided by the so-called Zook Report (American Commission on Education, State of Education, 1946). It saw the Bavarian system, with its vertically separated school types after the four-year primary school period, as a breeding ground for elitist thinking, which had, amongst other things, paved the way to National Socialism.\n\nHowever, the lack of progress and the memorandum from a university working group from Chicago (USA; Working Group for German Issues at the University of Chicago) led the US military government to abandon the planned structural school reform. From the beginning of the 1950s onwards, measures increasingly did not focus on the discussion of educational goals and content in schools anymore, but on extracurricular areas such as the construction of the America Houses and the organisation of a cultural exchange programme (Füssl, Kulturaustausch, 169-201).\n\nOrganisation by the military government\n\nThe move away from the external school reform manifested itself in the change of the Military Government's head of the education department, when Alonzo Grace (1896-1971, Head of the Education Department 1948-1949) took over the management of the \"Education and Cultural Relations Division\" (E&CR) in the summer of 1948. The cultural exchange programme had begun the year before and was further expanded at the beginning of the 1950s. The E&CR's own sub-division for cultural affairs (\"Cultural Affairs Branch\"; Heydenreuter, Office, 230), opened in 1948, also shows the great importance attached to this part of the re-education policy. The term \"exchange\" mainly referred to trips by specialists and executives to the USA, which were summarised under the title \"German Experts to the United States\". For example, participants from the education sector spent between one and three months in the United States. The Military Government provided the financial basis for the endeavour.\n\nImplementation on site\n\nThe planning and implementation of the programme on site in the United States was the responsibility of the \"sponsors\", exchange supporters recruited from the relevant professional or trade associations (OMGUS 1.10.1948-31.12.1949, Mf. 1–9). This skilful bringing together of people in similar technical and professional positions was intended to ensure that the participants in the exchange programme were able to experience satisfying technical discussions, meaningful participation in conferences and the like.\n\nContent design\n\nLying within the framework of the re-education policy, the cultural exchange programme was subordinated to the goals of international understanding and democratisation. Getting to know the United States was supposed to contribute to developing tolerance on the path to the peaceful coexistence of nations. The US-Americans' democratic behaviour patterns were to be observed and appropriated. As many areas of public life as possible were to be supported, for example trade unions, women's organisations and political institutions (Latzin, Lernen [2005], 139–304). Special support was given to the education sector; people from this group made up about twelve percent of the participants in the exchange programme.\n\nWith the goal of changing the school system having receded into the background, the projects in the education sector concentrated on an “internal school reform” following the turnaround in policy under Alonzo Grace. For example, Bavarian participants, sitting in on classes, were to observe the use of objective test methods in mathematics and science lessons. By promoting impartiality and freedom from prejudice, the learning of this method was to be a model for peaceful problem-solving strategies in everyday life and a small step on the path to world peace. The \"Curriculum and Curriculum Making\" project aimed to promote curriculum revision through familiarisation with US-American curricula and how they are written. The aim was to modernise the Bavarian timetables and curricula and to focus on relevance to life. The \"Study of Social Studies Teaching in the U.S.\" project took the concept of civic education into consideration; the aim was to impart how democratic action could be learned on three levels: in a class-transcending school community, through teaching methods that allow for pluralism, and in a separate subject, social studies.\n\nSelection of participants\n\nThe number of participants in the exchanges was limited; on average, only four people were selected for each project. Therefore, it is understandable that the selection was made very carefully, not least out of consideration for the American taxpayer and the high organisational workload involved in the exchange. In addition to political reliability, the overriding criterion was the candidate's potential role as a disseminator. They had to demonstrate that they had the ability, the professional network and the competence to disseminate the knowledge and skills acquired in the USA in Bavaria.\n\nThe curriculum project can be used as an example to illustrate the primacy of the dissemination potential. Selected candidates had already made a name for themselves in curriculum development and held positions that allowed them to gain experience abroad. Thus, from Bavaria, Countess Silvia von Brockdorff (1908–2003), who worked in an advisory capacity for the Office of Military Government for Bavaria (OMGB), and Paul Wilpert (1906–1967), who held a professorship for philosophy and education in Passau, took part in 1949. Both of these were later involved in advising on the \"Foundation for the Reconstruction of the Bavarian Education and Schooling System\" (so-called Wallenburg Foundation). The foundation was established on 5 April 1948 by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and was named after Schloss Wallenburg (Miesbach district), its first meeting site (from 1 December 1948 on the meeting venue was Kempfenhausen [Starnberg district]). In the Wallenburg Foundation, a group of experts dealt with various issues regarding the Bavarian education system, such as the highest educational goals and the content of teacher training. Participants returning from the United States were systematically supervised to guarantee the transfer of professional knowledge and the dissemination of democratic behaviour (Latzin, Lernen [2005], 304-321).\n\nHowever, factors of a completely different nature were also relevant: married applicants were preferred as it was assumed that they would actually return to Bavaria. English skills also played a role as a prerequisite for successful communication in the target country. Professional experience and therefore the age of the candidates was also important. During the planning phase pre-1948, it had looked as if cultural exchange would be open primarily to the younger generation. The age group of 16 to 19-year-olds finally got their money's worth in the smaller “Teen-Age programme” (Pilgert, Exchange, 60–62; Puaca, Missionaries). However, right after the start of the exchange programme, the majority of the participants were managers.\n\nImportance of the programme\n\nThe cultural exchange with its peak between 1949 and 1953 falls into a period of increasing partnership between Germany and the USA and can be seen as part of the so-called Containment policy, in which the USA wanted to prevent or contain the spread of communism using political means. The measures were part of the \"Reeducation Programme\", although considering the lack of directive actions the term \"reorientation\" is more relevant to what actually happened.\n\nBetween its beginning and end in the 1950s, 14,000 people completed the exchange programme, including the 2,000 participants who visited Western European countries. The \"Teen-Age programme\" accounted for around 2,300 one-year stays in the first half of the 1950s. The exchange was seen as the heart of the reorientation. The Governor of the Office of Military Government for Germany (OMGUS) Lucius D. Clay (1898–1978, Military Governor 1947–1949) described it as the \"foundation upon which our reorientation program was built\" (Clay, Decision in Germany, 301).\n\nThe skilful placement of the returning top executives on the committees of post-war Bavaria that matched their experience abroad is evidence of the programs potential reach. In the end though, it is not possible to clearly determine which democratic elements can actually be traced back to the exchange (for the public's reactions to the exchange, see Latzin, Lernen [2005], 321-326). The success of the programme for the younger generation can probably be regarded as moderate, since the United States was extremely attractive to young people, which made it difficult for them to reintegrate in Bavaria.\n\nThe unilateral nature of the exchange, which was also intended to promote the USA, is worthy of criticism. For this reason, historical research has already suggested the term “visit programme” to replace the concept of exchange (Kreis; Latzin). In fact, just 2,000 Americans came to Germany as part of the cultural exchange. In terms of content, it was completely characterized by one-sidedness – from the very beginning, there was the implication that the only thing that needed to be improved was the way of life in Germany. The most extensive bilateralism could be observed in teacher exchanges, although this included just a few participants. Cultural exchange became more reciprocal after its assignment to the US State Department from 1951, when the \"Fulbright Programme\" was also opened up to Germany. The programme initiated by James William Fulbright (1905–1995) in 1946 supports academic exchange from and with the USA (as of 2019: over 160 partner countries and over 390,000 participants since 1946).\n\nA summary assessment of the impact of cultural exchange is difficult to make simply because of the heterogeneous nature of the participants. Its contribution to the success story of the country's democratisation cannot be quantified; historical research sometimes estimates the impact of these measures as small compared to the influence of the improved economic conditions. It is documented that the Bavarian graduates were impressed above all by the prosperity and progressiveness of the host country, but were critical of the school system, for example. However, the cultural exchange programme, the largest in history, definitely made a certain contribution to democratisation on its way to becoming firmly anchored in the Western world.\n\nÜberblick über einige Teilnehmer, die Themen der Studienreisen, die Reisedauer und die Stationen der Reise Name Biographical data Role at the\n\ntime of the\n\nstudy trip Study trip subject Study trip length Stops on the\n\nstudy trip Sources/Literature Adam, Robert born 1894 Head of Section and Deputy Secretary of State for Refugees Refugee support and assimilation 1950/51, four months Latzin (2005), Lernen, 337.
