        "text": "W\n\ne have a right royal summer ahead, as the Queen, our longest-reigning monarch, celebrates her Platinum Jubilee – 70 years of unswerving service to the nation. The occasion will no doubt generate outpourings of national pride and much waving of Union Jacks. But our monarchy is a truly international institution – from the French Plantagenets to the German Hanoverians, dynastic names show that the royal family has roots and branches deep and wide. The royal house of Hanover produced six British monarchs, from King George I, who was crowned in 1714, to Queen Victoria, forging centuries of rich relations between Britain and Germany. And the Queen has personally strengthened those connections, making five memorable state visits to Germany during her reign, the first in 1965 and the latest in 2015, along with two trips just to Berlin. So, on the occasion of her Platinum Jubilee, we have created three themed “royal tour” holidays in Germany – in cooperation with the German National Tourist Office – exploring its historic cities, art, culture and palaces – where you can follow in the Queen’s famous footsteps.\n\nDiscover three enthralling tours to explore a country full of history, culture and magnificent palaces\n\nNext stop: North Rhine-Westphalia\n\nTour 1\n\n1,000 museums await you\n\nCITIES\n\nCurious visitors can take their pick from more than 1,000 museums in North Rhine- Westphalia\n\nCLICK A TICKET TO CHOOSE A TOUR\n\nERMANY\n\npromoted content\n\nYou could feel the excitement in the air when, on May 25, 1965, the Queen arrived at Cologne Cathedral. As she stood before its massive gothic entrance, press cameras clicked and confetti blew about, thrown from windows by locals to celebrate her visit.\n\nologne, Bonn, Düsseldorf… Some of the best-known place names in Germany lie in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, known for its historic cathedrals, musical heritage and dazzling landscapes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Queen has visited more cities here than in any other German state. Other royals have graced North Rhine-Westphalia with their presence. The Queen Mother paid a private visit to Münster in 1983, as did Charles and Diana in the summer of 1991. This bike-friendly university city should be on any traveller’s must-see list, with its buzzy\n\nCathedrals, composers – and some pretty cool nightlife. The cities of Stuttgart, Cologne and Berlin have all welcomed the Queen – and now they’re ready for you\n\nCITIES\n\nTour 1\n\nCULTURE\n\nTour 2\n\nPALACES\n\nTour 3\n\nHAMBURG The historic 1965 visit to West Germany ended in Hamburg, where the Royal Yacht Britannia waited to take the Queen and Prince Philip along the River Elbe and then home. Her stay included meeting Hamburg’s mayor, who broke the local tradition of welcoming VIPs at the top of the staircase at city hall by descending the steps to greet her.\n\nBERLIN On June 23, 2015, on a three-day visit to Berlin, the Queen was a guest at the celebrated Hotel Adlon, beside the Brandenburg Gate. The royal standard was raised above the hotel in anticipation of her arrival – but it was upside down. Fortunately, the staff ran up the flag again, this time the right way round, before she checked in.\n\nWhen the Queen reached Stuttgart on May 24, 1965, half a million people turned out to welcome her. It was, ahem, a new high for the royal visitor, who ascended Stuttgart’s TV Tower to sign the Golden Book of the City. It’s said that the rather inadequate lawn around the tower was painted green for her arrival.\n\nAs part of her first state visit to Germany in 1965, the Queen came to Munich on May 21, to be met by ecstatic citizens. Dressed in vibrant yellow, she took in the paintings of the Alte Pinakothek gallery with Bavaria’s prime minister, Alfons Goppel. (Much as she might have appreciated the city, the Queen had reminders of home during her visit, enjoying English Earl Grey tea brought along by her entourage.)\n\nMUNICH\n\nSTUTTGART\n\nCOLOGNE\n\nHAMBURG\n\nBERLIN\n\nDRESDEN\n\nMAINZ\n\nBONN\n\nLEIPZIG\n\nBREMEN\n\nThe Queen has been to Bonn three times, in 1965, 1978 and 1992. On her first visit to the city, she laid a bouquet of white and pink roses at the Beethoven Monument in Münsterplatz. In 1845, Queen Victoria had attended the unveiling of the monument, which commemorated the 75th anniversary of the birth of the composer.\n\nIn 1978, the Queen and the Duke visited Mainz – birthplace of Johannes Gutenberg, the 15th-century inventor of printing in Europe. Prince Philip was shown how the process worked by Mainz lord mayor Jockel Fuchs, and is said to have printed a book of his own to take home.\n\nDuring the 1992 royal tour, the Queen visited the Kreuzkirche (Church of the Holy Cross), where a special service was organised for some 2,000 attendees. The sermon was shared by the Bishop of Dresden and the Bishop of Coventry (the cities are twinned), and the Duke of Edinburgh read a lesson in German.\n\nIn 1992 the Queen and Prince Philip enjoyed a rousing welcome in Leipzig, as well as a busy itinerary, which included both the old and new town halls, and St Nicholas Church. Her Majesty ended up with sore feet, according to Prince Philip's explanation in German.\n\nOn the Queen’s 1978 tour of Germany, ports of call included Bremerhaven, where she disembarked from the Royal Yacht Britannia, and Bremen. Here, on the Martini pier, the royal visitor was presented with flowers by an admiring young girl. The mayor, Hans Koschnick, walked her along the boardwalk to the Marktplatz.\n\nHM the Queen made her mark on Dresden, Bonn and Mainz during some memorable state visits. Here’s how to follow in her regal footsteps for your own unforgettable break\n\nWIESBADEN\n\nBRÜHL\n\nDÜSSELDORF\n\nPOTSDAM\n\nHANOVER\n\nDüsseldorf has featured twice on royal tour itineraries, in 1965 and 2004. The people of the city’s Benrath district, home to an eponymous palace the Queen visited, were clearly excited to see her on her first trip. Not only did they lay on a sumptuous breakfast reception, but they also gave the railway station a fresh coat of paint in anticipation of her arrival.\n\nX\n\nThe town of Brühl, in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, pulled out all the stops to welcome Her Majesty during her 1965 visit. A gala dinner was held at Augustusburg Palace in her honour, which was attended by German president Heinrich Lübke and his wife.\n\nOn the 1965 tour, Wiesbaden, one of the oldest spa towns in Europe, also welcomed Her Majesty.

The occasion will no doubt generate outpourings of national pride and much waving of Union Jacks. But our monarchy is a truly international institution – from the French Plantagenets to the German Hanoverians, dynastic names show that the royal family has roots and branches deep and wide. The royal house of Hanover produced six British monarchs, from King George I, who was crowned in 1714, to Queen Victoria, forging centuries of rich relations between Britain and Germany. And the Queen has personally strengthened those connections, making five memorable state visits to Germany during her reign, the first in 1965 and the latest in 2015, along with two trips just to Berlin. So, on the occasion of her Platinum Jubilee, we have created three themed “royal tour” holidays in Germany – in cooperation with the German National Tourist Office – exploring its historic cities, art, culture and palaces – where you can follow in the Queen’s famous footsteps.\n\nNext stop: North Rhine-Westphalia\n\nThe jewels of this western state include Media Harbour in Düsseldorf, Cologne Cathedral, and Prinzipalmarkt square in Münster\n\nologne, Bonn, Düsseldorf… Some of the best -known place names in Germany lie in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, known for its historic cathedrals, musical heritage and dazzling landscapes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Queen has visited more cities here than in any other German state. Other royals have graced North Rhine-Westphalia with their presence. The Queen Mother paid a private visit to Münster in 1983, as did Charles and Diana in the summer of 1991. This bike-friendly university city should be on any traveller’s must-see list, with its buzzy harbour district and sturdy cathedral towering over the Domplatz.

The people of the city’s Benrath district, home to an eponymous palace the Queen visited, were clearly excited to see her on her first trip. Not only did they lay on a sumptuous breakfast reception, but they also gave the railway station a fresh coat of paint in anticipation of her arrival.\n\nDÜSSELDORF\n\nX\n\nThe town of Brühl, in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, pulled out all the stops to welcome Her Majesty during her 1965 visit.

On her first visit to the city, she laid a bouquet of white and pink roses at the Beethoven Monument in Münsterplatz. In 1845, Queen Victoria had attended the unveiling of the monument, which commemorated the 75th anniversary of the birth of the composer.\n\nBONN\n\nX\n\nIn 1978, the Queen and the Duke visited Mainz – birthplace of Johannes Gutenberg, the 15th-century inventor of printing in Europe. Prince Philip was shown how the process worked by Mainz lord mayor Jockel Fuchs, and is said to have printed a book of his own to take home.\n\nMAINZ\n\nX\n\nDuring the 1992 royal tour, the Queen visited the Kreuzkirche (Church of the Holy Cross), where a special service was organised for some 2,000 attendees. The sermon was shared by the Bishop of Dresden and the Bishop of Coventry (the cities are twinned), and the Duke of Edinburgh read a lesson in German.\n\nDRESDEN\n\nX\n\nIn 1992 the Queen and Prince Philip enjoyed a rousing welcome in Leipzig, as well as a busy itinerary, which included both the old and new town halls, and St Nicholas Church. Her Majesty ended up with sore feet, according to Prince Philip's explanation in German.\n\nLEIPZIG\n\nX\n\nOn the Queen’s 1978 tour of Germany, ports of call included Bremerhaven, where she disembarked from the Royal Yacht Britannia, and Bremen. Here, on the Martini pier, the royal visitor was presented with flowers by an admiring young girl.

Dressed in vibrant yellow, she took in the paintings of the Alte Pinakothek gallery with Bavaria’s prime minister, Alfons Goppel. (Much as she might have appreciated the city, the Queen had reminders of home during her visit, enjoying English Earl Grey tea brought along by her entourage.)\n\nMUNICH\n\nX\n\nWhen the Queen reached Stuttgart on May 24, 1965, half a million people turned out to welcome her. It was, ahem, a new high for the royal visitor, who ascended Stuttgart’s TV Tower to sign the Golden Book of the City. It’s said that the rather inadequate lawn around the tower was painted green for her arrival.\n\nSTUTTGART\n\nX\n\nYou could feel the excitement in the air when, on May 25, 1965, the Queen arrived at Cologne Cathedral. As she stood before its massive gothic entrance, press cameras clicked and confetti blew about, thrown from windows by locals to celebrate her visit.\n\nCOLOGNE\n\nX\n\nBERLIN On June 23, 2015, on a three-day visit to Berlin, the Queen was a guest at the celebrated Hotel Adlon, beside the Brandenburg Gate. The royal standard was raised above the hotel in anticipation of her arrival – but it was upside down. Fortunately, the staff ran up the flag again, this time the right way round, before she checked in.\n\nBERLIN\n\nX\n\nHAMBURG The historic 1965 visit to West Germany ended in Hamburg, where the Royal Yacht Britannia waited to take the Queen and Prince Philip along the River Elbe and then home.
