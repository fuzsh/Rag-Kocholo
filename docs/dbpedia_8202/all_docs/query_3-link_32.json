May 2024 the Thesaurus linguae Latinae in Munich will host the Latin Grammarians Forum, a seminar on the ancient grammatical tradition organized by Andrea Consalvi, Manfred Flieger, Roberta Marchionni, Elena Spangenberg Yanes. The programme can be viewed here.\n\nIt will be possible to attend the event online via the Google Meet platform by sending an email to andrea.consalvi(at)uniroma1.it or elena.spangenbergyanes(at)uniroma1.it.\n\nThe \"application for establishing a new completion date\" drawn up by the Thesaurus team in collaboration with the Research Department of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities was successful: the highest decision-making body of The Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities, which is responsible for the Academies' Program, is continuing to fund the Thesaurus, i.e. the project will be funded for an initial 12 years (with the prospect of a further 13 years).\n\nThis is wonderful news for all employees, but also for the academic community.\n\nA big thank you to everyone who contributed to the success of the project and encouraged it along the way!\n\nThe International Commission for the Thesaurus linguae Latinae meets every three years in Munich; because of the pandemic, the anticipated meeting in 2020 had to be cancelled, and this year the meeting was held online as a result of current travel restrictions. Thirty-two delegates from twenty-six countries \"met\" on 8 and 9 July, 2021. The participants' locations show the global significance of the project: from Tokyo to Cambridge, Massachusetts, from Cape Town to Oslo and Helsinki\n\nThe Commission discussed important issues concerning the future of the project.\n\nNow available in our Open Access: Fascicle R5 (refocilo-regno).\n\nThe sixth fascicle of R (from regnum to relinquo) has been published at De Gruyter: It contains among others the important lemma religio.\n\nAnd the lemma list in Open Access has been improved, so that it is now possible to search for words that contain brackets in the printed version. Thus, for example, the lemma pulc(h)er can now be found both when searching for the form pulcher and when entering pulcer.\n\nDear friends of the Thesaurus, visitors to our homepage,\n\nnos autem ita sumus deducti ad Thesaurum linguae Latinae, ut, quoad possimus et liceat, ab eius officio numquam discedamus.\n\nThese words alluding to CIC. Lael. 1 might describe the time-honored, unshakeable commitment of Thesaurus lexicographers to Latin. The current COVID-19 pandemic and the public measures taken to bring it under control force us to travel untrodden paths: since last Tuesday we have been working from home, quoad possumus. The pictures show two of us, Roberta Marchionni and Michael Hillen, at our respective home offices.\n\nThe Archive and Library of the Thesaurus are, along with the entire Bavarian Academy of Sciences building, closed to external visitors for the moment.\n\nLast week was marked by impressive creativity in the search for and making available of digital resources for lexicographic work, far from our fantastic library. This is another step into the digital future for our working methods. The willingness of our colleagues to help each other is impressive, who are constantly finding new ways to be productive in the current situation. The work must go on. We have simply taken on so much to accomplish this year!\n\nA constant companion to our work is worry about our families, friends, and colleagues, both near and far, especially those in the countries most affected by the pandemic.\n\nTo all of them we wish good health, patience, and abundant caution!\n\nMichael Hillen, March 25th 2020\n\nWhy the World Must Continue to Exist\n\nTo those who work on the\n\nThesaurus Linguae Latinae,\n\nto its users,\n\nand to us.\n\nA stream unceasing of letters and words\n\ncarved on stones and bronze, scratched\n\non pots and shards, on the inside of rings,\n\nin the black of uncials and the thorns\n\nof medieval script, from the archbishop's\n\ncollection of Roman tombstones in Ravenna,\n\nthe plaster walls of Pompeii, all carrying\n\nthe words of millions who spoke them,\n\nthought them, read them, wrote them,\n\nweeping at the cemetery, picking at\n\nthe knots of thought in their studies,\n\ndeclaiming drama, orating in law suits,\n\nshouting on battlefields, spitting in graffiti,\n\n\"Drusilla is a whore and her husband\n\nis a eunuch,\" making sense of the world,\n\nsilent voices, silent pens, silent chisels,\n\nwords now copied onto paper slips,\n\nprobed to the finest points of meaning,\n\nwhirled around, combined, slowly pooling\n\ninto the calm waters of the dictionary,\n\nso that the ancients can speak to us,\n\nbreathe out in winged words, today,\n\ntheir part in the revelation of who we are.\n\nLawrence N. DiCostanzo\n\nIm Rahmen der Latin Lexicography Summer School präsentiert der Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (BAdW) einen Vortrag von\n\nProf. Dr. David Langslow\n\n(University of Manchester)\n\nüber\n\nThe Latin Alexander Trallianus\n\nDonnerstag, 25. Juli 2019, 16:15\n\nSitzungssaal 1, Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften\n\nAlfons-Goppel-Str. 11, München\n\nThe lecture discusses a sixth-century Latin medical treatise translated from Greek (based on Alexander of Tralles’s Therapeutics and On Fevers), which has never been critically edited, but enjoyed enormous popularity and remained on university syllabuses until the 18th century. Questions include: How many translators were involved? How ‘correct’ or poorly controlled is the Latin of the various parts? What was the first language of the translator(s)? Are there features of the Latin that link the Latin Alexander with other Latin medical texts? Are there features of the Latin that allow us to locate the translator(s) in space and time?"
