        "text": "The Kentucky Derby Museum is one of the region’s premier attractions, celebrating the tradition, history, hospitality, and pride of the world-renowned event that is the Kentucky Derby. Each year, the Museum welcomes over 240,000 visitors from across the U.S. and around the world. With a general admission ticket, visitors can enjoy two floors of interactive exhibits, a 30-minute guided historic walking tour at Churchill Downs Racetrack, and get their heart racing and emotions soaring watching the Museum’s signature 18-minute movie, “The Greatest Race” on a 360°, 4K high-resolution screen.\n\nThe Museum’s exhibits tell the story of how the Kentucky Derby got its start, going back to the first Derby in 1875. Displayed are unique artifacts ranging from early fashion pieces to winning Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas’ trophies and artwork entrusted to the Museum in 2017. Visitors can call a race, play Derby trivia and learn about what it takes to be a jockey.\n\nThe Derby Café offers a modern take on some of Kentucky’s signature dishes, including a Hot Brown Panini, Burgoo, and Bourbon Bread Pudding. The bourbon bar offers Mint Juleps, bourbon flights, and other drinks at the full bar.\n\nIn addition to the Historic Walking Tour of Churchill Downs that comes with General Admission, guests can upgrade to other tour options that include some of the most exclusive spots inside Churchill Downs, including Millionaires Row and the backside where Thoroughbreds live and train during racing season.\n\nWith our newly renovated event space, the Kentucky Derby Museum can accommodate special events such as weddings, rehearsal dinners, corporate meetings, and special occasions for small and large groups of up to 2,000 people. Kentucky Derby Museum offers guests unique spaces that bring the thrill of horseracing to any occasion.\n\nKentucky Derby Museum is a 501(C)(3) non-profit public charity organization in Louisville, Kentucky. Our mission is to ENGAGE, EDUCATE and EXCITE everyone about the extraordinary experience that is the KENTUCKY DERBY."
