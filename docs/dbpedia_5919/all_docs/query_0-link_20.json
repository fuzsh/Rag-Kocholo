        "text": "Great Yarmouth BC has been named LGC Council of the Year at a ceremony that celebrated the very best of the local government sector.\n\nThe council beat competition from Dorset Council, Gravesham BC, Knowsley Council and Oxford City Council. Judges made in-person visits to all five councils in the weeks leading up to the ceremony, before they underwent rigorous live judging for the headline award category, sponsored by Zurich Municipal.\n\nThe judges said: “Through foresight and vision for its place and people this council has delivered tangible regeneration and impressive economic development whilst also leaning in to every area that could improve lives for its population, even if not its direct responsibility.\n\n“The judges were unanimous in their view that the kindness, energy and commitment on show from staff, members and partners is infectious and a beacon for the sector. This council is a perfectly timed example of how a small local authority with a relatively modest budget can punch well above its weight through leveraging significant financial investment but also partnership capital.\"\n\nThe winners of the 22 categories were announced at a glittering black-tie ceremony held at London’s Grosvenor House, hosted by actor Will Mellor.\n\nSee the full list of winners at the bottom of this story.\n\nLGC editor Sarah Calkin told the ceremony that the awards are a “time to celebrate you, the difference you make to countless families and businesses every day, whether they realise it or not”.\n\nShe added: “The LGC Awards 2024 shortlist is full of tales of dedicated teams and individuals going above and beyond, day after day, week after week, often in extremely challenging circumstances to care for the most vulnerable in your communities, deliver the vital services we all rely on every day, and convene, champion – whatever it takes – to support your places to thrive.”\n\nThe 2024 awards were sponsored by Zurich Municipal, Attenti Consulting, Believ, Connected Places Catapult, Local Partnerships, Norse Group, Odgers Interim, Penna, Repic, Tile Hill and Triple Value Impact."
