        "text": "NACOGDOCHES, Texas — Stephen F. Austin State University’s James I. Perkins College of Education’s hospitality program will host the sixth annual Kentucky Derby dinner and auction at 6 p.m. April 19 at the Fredonia Hotel.\n\nThe evening commences with a cocktail reception featuring a cash bar at 6 p.m., followed by a four-course dinner inspired by Kentucky Derby cuisine at 7 p.m. Silent and live auctions will take place throughout the evening featuring items from numerous businesses in Nacogdoches and beyond, including multiple gift baskets, gift certificates and other fun items.\n\nStudents in the special events production course will plan and execute the event. The students’ responsibilities include organizing the menu, auction items, marketing, ticket sales, decorations and all other aspects of the planning. Students from the introductory hospitality course, as well as other hospitality students, will assist with the event.\n\n“In addition to contributing funds to the program, this event provides an opportunity for students to get valuable, hands-on experience in event planning,” said Carlie Allen, adjunct instructor in human sciences. “They are able to learn all the different aspects of planning an event, and they have opportunities to interact with guests and demonstrate the skills they have learned in the hospitality administration program.”"
