Statement from Leader of Derby City Council, Cllr Nadine Peatfield and Council Cabinet on the ongoing violence facing the region and the UK: \"Derby is a city where people come first. We are a diverse community united by our shared belief in respect, equality, and understanding. The recent surge of Islamophobic and racist violence across the UK is a stark reminder that we must remain united against hatred. We continue to be aware of the issues facing our region and are working in partnership with Derbyshire Constabulary, the Derbyshire Police and Crime Commissioner and local community leaders to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all citizens. Derby is a city of sanctuary and a place where people from all backgrounds come together to create a vibrant and welcoming community. These hateful attacks are an affront to our city’s shared values. We stand in solidarity with those affected and pledge our unwavering support. These individuals do not represent the values of Derby or the residents who call Derby their home. We will not tolerate racism and discrimination of any kind in our city.\" Read more on our newsroom👉https://orlo.uk/LRKSw\n\nWhether you want to know more about cost of living support or are thinking about adoption, we’ve got updates for you! 👨👩👧👦 Like any new parents, many prospective adopters worry about their ability to cope, but adoption is a journey you can navigate together.
