        "text": "A smooth victory in the Grade III Matt Winn Stakes in his last outing has the connections of Society Man hoping for a positive outcome in the $500,000 Grade III West Virginia Derby for 3-yearolds at Mountaineer Sunday.\n\nSociety Man, a Good Magic gelding who races for Reeves Thoroughbred Racing, West Paces Racing, GMP Stables, Carl Pascarella and Yurie Pascarella, rated off the pace in the 1 1/16-mile Matt Winn at Churchill Downs but circled much of the eight-horse field to win by 2 1/2 lengths. It was the first graded stakes score for Society Man, who earlier this year finished second in the Grade II Wood Memorial Stakes and 16th in the Grade I Kentucky Derby.\n\nAn $85,000 yearling purchase at the Keeneland September sale in 2022, Society Man has been working regularly at Saratoga Race Course for trainer Danny Gargan, who also trains Dornoch, winner of a pair of Grade I stakes — the Belmont and the Haskell — in his last two starts.\n\nGargan is pleased with how Society Man is coming into the 1 1/8-mile West Virginia Derby.\n\n“He’s doing really well, and we opted for the (West Virginia Derby) over the Jim Dandy Stakes (at Saratoga) because we thought it would be a better fit for him,” Gargan said. “Hopefully, we made the right decision. He ran really well last time at Churchill and his Wood Memorial was a good race.”\n\nIn the Kentucky Derby, Society Man, at 47-1, was within four lengths of the leader in a crowded field before fading in the drive.\n\n“He certainly benefited from the Derby effort,” Gargan said. “We would love to win the West Virginia Derby, or at least hit the board.”\n\nSociety Man was ridden last time by Corey Lanerie, who has the call at Mountaineer. He is the 9-2 third choice from post position eight in a nine-horse field.\n\nMeanwhile, Dragoon Guard, the 9-5 morning-line favorite for the Derby, was scheduled to ship from Kentucky to West Virginia Aug. 2 as he shoots for his fourth victory in a row.\n\nThe Juddmonte Farms homebred colt by Arrogate won his first stakes, the Grade III Indiana Derby, in his last start July 6. Trainer Brad Cox said it has been all systems go since his gate-to- wire score at Horseshoe Indianapolis. The Indiana Derby was at 1 1/16 miles.\n\n“The horse has done very well since the Indiana Derby, and we thought (the West Virginia Derby) fit very well on the calendar for him,” Cox said. “It will be his second race around two turns and we’re looking for some more experience for him.”\n\nDragoon Guard, who lost his first start by a neck as a 2-year-old before beginning his streak this year, has gradually increased distances from seven furlongs.\n\nHe will add another sixteenth of a mile at Mountaineer.\n\n“We hope he takes a step forward and continues to improve like he has in each and every start this year,” Cox said.\n\nFlorent Geroux, who has ridden Dragoon Guard in all of his races, has the mount from post position three.\n\nFirst post time for the Sunday program at Mountaineer is 5 p.m."
