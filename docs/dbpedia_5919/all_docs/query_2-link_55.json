        "text": "I was born and raised in Foxboro, MA and so I am a New Englander at heart. I came to know Jesus as my Savior through the ministries of my youth pastor in the mid-2000's. In 2009 I met my wife, Norma, and later we attended the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago together. We got married in June of 2012 and graduated from Moody in 2014. Though we enjoyed the mid-west we were eager to come back and serve the Lord in New England. Immediately after graduating from Moody I attended Seminary at Gordon-Conwell to work towards a Masters of Divinity degree. In the Spring of 2016, while at Gordon-Conwell, I accepted a role as Pastor of the Derby Community Church in Derby, Vermont. I spent 2 years as a full-time pastor/full-time student and I finally graduated from Gordon-Conwell in the Spring of 2018.\n\nBeing part of my church family and this community in Derby has been a great blessing to my family and I. My wife and I both share a strong passion and desire to minister to God’s people in the North East and we especially love the North East Kingdom of Vermont. My wife was born and raised in northern VT and so she is as much a New Englander as I. We have 4 hilarious and wonderful children ages 3-9, Isabelle, Teddy, Mikey, and Grace. We also have a Golden Retriever and nine chickens. In my free time I enjoy hiking with my kids, skiing, camping, fishing, hunting, writing guitar music, reading novels, and watching the Patriots, among other things.\n\nSend me a message anytime at [email protected]"
