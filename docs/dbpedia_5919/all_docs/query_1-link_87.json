        "text": "Dodgers LF Teoscar Hernández took home the MLB Home Run Derby title last night, prevailing 14-13 at Globe Life Field after Royals SS Bobby Witt Jr.'s final swing \"hit the base of the wall in left-center.\" Hernández was not only the first Dodgers player to win the Derby in the event’s 40-year history, but also \"one of the more unlikely champions of the annual slug-off in recent memory.\" After Hernández earned the win, he \"claimed the Derby trophy, the $1-million winning prize, and a gold chain that read 'Derby Champ'\" (L.A. TIMES, 7/15). An \"otherwise unremarkable Derby was suddenly careening toward a dramatic ending\" -- one that would \"come down to a matter of feet\" (ESPN.com, 7/15).\n\nThis year's event \"switched up the rules governing the bonus round.\" Instead of an additional time period tacked on to the end of rounds, batters \"were given three outs at the conclusion of their allotted time, where each ball that wasn’t a home run was scored as an out.\" The Home Run Derby is \"sometimes criticized for its lack of dramatic fireworks,\" but \"thanks to the configuration of the bonus round, we got plenty\" (THE RINGER, 7/15).\n\nThe event \"was something of a dud,\" as the \"wonderful moments that have so often elevated the Derby -- when a hitter goes on a heater, ripping ball after ball into the bleachers, the oohs and ahhs growing in volume with each blast -- were nowhere to be found.\" The event’s new, hybrid pitch-count-plus-clock system \"might be the culprit for the dip in numbers.\" The system was \"a bit difficult to follow and resulted in the worst of both worlds\" -- players were \"exhausted, and the raw totals were underwhelming\" (YAHOO SPORTS, 7/15).\n\nThe sellout crowd at Globe Life Field for the event \"was not in fact a sell out,\" as the Derby \"had plenty of seats in the right and left field corners.\" The announced attendance was 38,578, but the stadium seats 40,300. The home run derby is \"not a great product, and it’s terribly over priced\" -- tickets in those empty sections were going for $86. As \"evidenced by the healthy crowds at the All-Star village\" the past few days in Arlington, MLB’s All-Star event and its surrounding festivities \"are fine.\" What \"needs help\" is the Derby -- it’s \"flat. Boring\" (Fort Worth STAR-TELEGRAM, 7/15)."
