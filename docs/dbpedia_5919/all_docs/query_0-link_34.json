        "text": "About this guidance\n\nThis guidance has been developed by NHS England with the following partners:\n\nCare Quality Commission\n\nCentre for Governance and Scrutiny\n\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\n\nHealthwatch England\n\nLocal Government Association\n\nNational Voices\n\nNHS Confederation\n\nNHS Providers\n\nPatients Association\n\nThe Health Creation Alliance\n\nIntegrated Care Systems in Dorset, North East and North Cumbria, Sussex and West Yorkshire.\n\nIt also had input from NHS England’s public participation networks and forums. NHS England undertook a public consultation on this guidance during May 2022.\n\nThis statutory guidance is made up of a suite of documents – the main body and two annexes:\n\nGuidance on working with people and communities: this sets out how the guidance should be used; the main legal duties; reasons for working with people and communities; and the leadership needed to realise these benefits. It gives 10 principles to follow to build effective partnerships with people and communities.\n\nAnnex A gives the detail on putting it into practice. It describes the approaches to take for different contexts and how organisations can work together to create genuine and authentic relationships with local communities.\n\nAnnex B explains the public involvement legal duties in more detail and organisations’ responsibilities for working with people and communities.\n\nFurther information about all the case studies can be found on the NHS England website. It links to other relevant guidance on integrated care and to further resources on working effectively with people and communities.\n\nForewords\n\nEdward Argar, Minister of State for Health\n\nPeople and communities are at the heart of everything the NHS does. Working with people and communities is critical if we are to create a health and care service which offers personalised care, is tailored to the needs of each individual, and which works for everyone.\n\nThe Health and Care Act 2022 is designed to enable a more joined up, collaborative system. System leaders from across health and local government told us they wanted to work better together to tackle the big challenges in health and care. The Act ensures that every part of England is covered by an Integrated Care System, which brings together NHS, Local Government and wider system partners to empower them to put collaboration and partnership at the heart of planning. To achieve real impact, we need systems to look beyond those who are typically involved – building partnerships across traditional boundaries and working with people, communities and those who represent them to create real change.\n\nThe Act also introduces a new duty on NHS organisations to have regard to the effects of their decisions on the ‘Triple Aim’ of the health and wellbeing for the people of England, quality of services provided or arranged by NHS bodies, and sustainable use of NHS resources. The previous legislative framework directed organisations to work primarily in the best interest of their own organisations and their own immediate patients – but this does not fully support the delivery of integrated, patient-centred care. The new duty requires organisations to think about the interests of the wider system and provides common, system-wide goals that need to be achieved through collaboration. We expect NHS organisations to draw on the knowledge and experience of wider partners, including the voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) sector, local authorities and Healthwatch, alongside their communities when considering how to meet this duty.\n\nBy working with people across places, we can better tailor services to meet their needs and preferences, so that they are designed and delivered more effectively. This ensures that locations, opening times, models of care, and patient information are suitable for the communities we serve. Involvement helps us prioritise resources to have the greatest impact; and helps us make better decisions about changing services. Information from involvement activities can be used alongside financial or clinical information to ensure that services are delivered in a way that works for patients and their carers, and can be tailored to the needs of a particular area.\n\nThis guidance has been developed in partnership with organisations with experience of working with communities and ensuring their voices are heard in health and care services. It is intended to support health and care systems to build positive and enduring partnerships with people and communities in order to improve services and outcomes for everyone. It is an important next step in realising the benefits of the changes brought about by the Health and Care Act 2022.\n\nAmanda Pritchard, Chief Executive, NHS England\n\nThe NHS has always been at the heart of communities. Our hospitals, primary care and community health services provide services to millions of people every week, and a reassuring physical and psychological presence for many more. And never has the NHS been a source of more reassurance and more pride for communities than during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe NHS response to the pandemic – both the initial efforts to protect people from the virus, and especially our delivery of the vaccine programme – has depended in large part on our ability to work with and through communities, not just to spread broadcast messages, but more importantly to understand and overcome barriers to accessing services.\n\nAs we move into a new phase, our mission now is to continue recovery and tackle Covid backlogs, reform for the future and build resilience to future pressures. But we must also do so with respect for our patients and communities, ensuring their needs and opinions are central to how we plan, deliver and improve services.\n\nThrough Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) – particularly now they are underpinned by statutory Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) and Integrated Care Partnerships (ICPs) – we have an opportunity to further strengthen the relationship with the communities we serve collaboratively, with our Local Government and Voluntary Sector partners. The involvement of our people and communities sits right at the heart of this relationship; we can’t achieve the best outcomes in the most effective way, without working with the people we treat and care for.\n\nThe public rightly have high expectations of the NHS. But equally they understand the challenges we face, and want ways to be involved in finding solutions. They have knowledge, skills, experiences and ideas to develop solutions that best meet their needs and support their health and wellbeing. Without insight from people who use, or may use, services, it is impossible to make truly informed decisions about service design, delivery and improvement.\n\nThis is particularly important in addressing the health inequalities highlighted by the pandemic; we need to take this opportunity to address the barriers and challenges people experience and ensure we improve the health and wellbeing of the people who need care and support the most. And sometimes this means having the courage to be challenged on our current and historic performance.\n\nFortunately, we are not starting from scratch. As this guidance sets out, we can build on examples of existing collaboration already taking place in ICSs and on the benefits we have already seen and are seeing from working with communities this way.\n\nSam Allen, Chief Executive, North East & North Cumbria Integrated Care Board\n\nListening and involving the communities and citizens we serve through open conversations, to truly make a difference together, and with the aim of reducing inequalities is at the heart of our Integrated Care System. People and communities are why we are here, and we are in service to them. We will draw on their lived experience, wisdom and expertise and involve them as partners in our work.\n\nAdam Doyle, Chief Executive, Sussex Integrated Care Board\n\nI am very pleased to support the guidance for all ICBs and ICSs. The communities that we serve are best placed to help shape and co-produce health and care services that are meaningful to them. I encourage all colleagues to consider this guidance in as they take forward their 5-year strategy in each of their systems.\n\nPatricia Miller, Chief Executive, Dorset Integrated Care Board\n\nI am very privileged to confirm my support for a new approach to involving communities. If we are going to fulfil the ambition of integrated care systems around reducing inequalities, we need to understand the lived experience of our communities and design solutions with them that enable them to live their best lives and thrive. Our citizens should be at the centre of every decision we take.\n\nKate Shields, Chief Executive, Cornwall Integrated Care Board\n\nOur view about person voice is really clear. Without the voices of our people and our communities we will fail from the start. What we do and how we do it has to be aligned with what matters to the people we serve.\n\nPeople and their communities will increasingly be engaged in our services re-design across our system and we’ll ensure their voice is heard in our ICB and be at the heart what we do in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.\n\nExecutive summary\n\nThe Health and Care Act 2022 mobilises partners within Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) to work together to improve physical and mental health outcomes. These new partnerships between the NHS, social care, local authorities and other organisations will only build better and more sustainable approaches if they are informed by the needs, experiences and aspirations of the people and communities they serve.\n\nThis is statutory guidance for Integrated Care Boards (ICBs), NHS trusts and foundation trusts, and is adopted as policy by NHS England. It supports them to meet their public involvement legal duties and the new ‘triple aim’ of better health and wellbeing, improved quality of services and the sustainable use of resources. It is relevant to other health and care organisations, including local government, to ensure that we work collaboratively to involve people and communities, in ways that are meaningful, trusted and lead to improvement.\n\nThe public involvement legal duties require arrangements to secure that people are ‘involved’, and this can be in a variety of ways. ICBs, trusts and NHS England need to be able to demonstrate that they assess whether that the duties apply to decisions about services and, where they do, that they are properly followed. NHS England’s assessment of ICBs’ performance will include how they meet their legal duties. There are also policy requirements for Integrated Care Boards (ICBs), Integrated Care Partnerships (ICPs), place-based partnerships and provider collaboratives to involve people, including in their membership and when developing plans and strategies. Involvement is a contractual responsibility for Provider organisations, including General Practice, as set out in the NHS Standard Contract.\n\nWhile involving people and communities is a legal requirement, working with them also supports the wider objectives of integration including population health management, personalisation of care and support, addressing health inequalities and improving quality. The legal duties provide a platform to build collaborative and meaningful partnerships that start with people and focus on what really matters to our communities. However, the ambition is for health and care systems to build positive, trusted and enduring relationships with communities in order to improve services, support and outcomes for people.\n\nThere are clear benefits to working in partnership with people and communities. It means better decisions about service changes and how money is spent. It reduces risks of legal challenges and improves safety, experience and performance. It helps address health inequalities by understanding communities’ needs and developing solutions with them. It is about shaping a sustainable future for the NHS that meets people’s needs and aspirations.\n\nSenior leaders have a particular role in making this happen. They should ensure that they:\n\nunderstand and act on what matters to people\n\ndemonstrate how their organisations meet met the legal duties to involve\n\nwork with partners to put people are at the centre of everything they do\n\nensure there are resources for their organisations to do this work effectively\n\nspend time personally listening to and understanding their local communities.\n\nAccessible diagram text:\n\nThe 10 principles for working with people and communities are:\n\nCentre decision-making and governance around the voices of people and communities\n\nInvolve people and communities at every stage and feed back to them about how it has influenced activities and decisions\n\nUnderstand your community’s needs, experiences, ideas and aspirations for health and care, using engagement to find out if change is working\n\nBuild relationships based on trust, especially with marginalised groups and those affected by health inequalities\n\nWork with Healthwatch and the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector\n\nProvide clear and accessible public information\n\nUse community-centred approaches that empower people and communities, making connections what works already\n\nHave a range of ways for people and communities to take part in health and care services\n\nTackle system priorities and service reconfiguration in partnership with people and communities\n\nLearn from what works and build on the assets of all health and care partners – networks, relationships and activity in local places.\n\nThis guidance is structured around 10 principles. These have been developed from good practice already taking place, and will help organisations achieve the benefits of effective working with people and communities:\n\nApplying the principles means taking a variety of approaches to working with people and communities, depending on context and objectives. Regardless of the approach used, organisations should start with existing insight about the needs and experiences of their communities, and work with partners that already have links to them. They should also consider taking community-centred approaches – ones that recognise the strengths within communities and that build on existing assets that support people’s health.\n\nTo ensure legal duties are met, all approaches should be fair, proportionate and have regard to equalities, so that all relevant groups can take part. They should be designed to take account of the contexts that people live their lives in. This means building trust, safety, and shared understanding.\n\nIntegrated care gives an opportunity for the NHS to collaborate with partners on working with communities. This is both within the NHS (for example, commissioners and providers coordinating their involvement activities so they do not duplicate), and between the NHS and other partners – including local authorities, social care providers, Healthwatch and voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) sector organisations that already have links to and knowledge of communities.\n\nTerminology\n\nIn this guidance we talk about working in partnership with people and communities. We use this phrase to cover a variety of approaches such as engagement, participation, involvement, co-production and consultation. These terms often overlap, mean different things to different people, and sometimes have a technical or legal definition too.\n\nBy people we mean everyone of all ages, their representatives, relatives, and unpaid carers. This is inclusive of whether or not they use or access health and care services and support. Communities are groups of people that are interconnected, by where they live, how they identify or shared interests. They can exist at all levels, from neighbourhood to national, and be loosely or tightly defined by their members.\n\nCommunity-centred approaches recognise that many of the factors that create health and wellbeing are at community level, including social connections, having a voice in local decisions, and addressing health inequalities.\n\nWe refer to health and care systems as all organisations working to improve people’s physical and mental health, nationally and locally, including the NHS, local authorities and social care providers. We use the term trusts to refer to NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts.\n\nIntegrated care systems (ICSs) are partnerships of health and care organisations that come together to plan and deliver joined up services, and to improve the health of people who live and work in their area.\n\nEach ICS consists of an:\n\nIntegrated care board (ICB): a statutory organisation that brings the NHS together locally to improve population health and care\n\nIntegrated care partnership (ICP): a statutory committee (established by the ICB and relevant local authorities) that is a broad alliance of organisations and representatives concerned with improving the care, health and wellbeing of the population.\n\nICSs also include place-based partnerships and provider collaboratives. The King’s Fund animation explains more about the new organisations in the NHS and how they can collaborate with partners to deliver joined-up care.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis new guidance sets the ambition and expectations for how integrated care boards (ICBs), NHS trusts and foundation trusts should work in partnership with people and communities in this new collaborative environment. It is also adopted as policy by NHS England and will be useful for local authorities and other partners to understand the statutory duties on NHS England, ICBs and trusts.\n\nMany colleagues across these organisations already recognise the value of working with people and communities, and the experiences and knowledge that they contribute to improving health and care services. People and communities have the skills and insight to transform how health and care is designed and delivered. Working with them as equal partners helps them take more control over their health and is an essential part of securing a sustainable NHS.\n\nThis guidance aims to spread effective practice across all systems by building on the expertise and experience that exists and approaches already being applied (Health and wellbeing: a guide to community-centred approaches, Community-centred public health: taking a whole system approach). It provides practical advice and signposts to further information including training and resources. It also shares learning from areas where partnership is already making the vision a reality and makes clear the difference that working with people and communities makes.\n\nThe response to COVID-19 saw communities mobilise themselves to support family, friends and neighbours including those self-isolating and to encourage vaccine take-up; developing approaches that fitted local circumstances and needs (UKHSA: The community response to coronavirus (COVID-19), Health Creation Alliance: Learning from the community response to COVID19; how the NHS can support communities to keep people well). Communities worked alongside health and care partners to find innovative solutions to new challenges (National Voices: Unlocking the digital front door – keys to inclusive healthcare). There was agreement between communities and the organisations that provide services about the shared priorities. This led to joint working often with communities leading and systems responding to the needs and preferences voiced by people.\n\nThis learning should be transferred to help meet other challenges that health and care services face by listening to people and working with them to decide what will work best for them. The pandemic brought into sharp focus the disproportionate impact on certain population groups. A key part of how we address physical and mental health inequalities is to begin by listening to diverse communities and working with their knowledge, commitment and resources to improve access, experience and health outcomes.\n\nWho is this guidance for?\n\nThis is statutory guidance issued by:\n\nNHS England for ICBs under section 14Z51 of the National Health Service Act 2006 in relation to their ‘public involvement’ duty under section 14Z45\n\nthe Secretary of State for Health and Social Care for NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts under section 242(1G) in relation to their ‘public involvement’ duty under section 242(1B).\n\nIt replaces the 2017 statutory guidance for commissioners, the 2008 statutory guidance for trusts and the 2021 implementation guidance for ICSs.\n\nAs statutory guidance, this means that ICBs and trusts must have regard to this guidance. They must consciously consider the guidance and, where appropriate, be able to explain any substantial departure from it.\n\nNHS England has its own ‘public involvement’ duty (section 13Q of the National Health Service Act 2006). It is NHS England’s policy to have regard to this guidance in the same way that ICBs and trusts are required to as statutory guidance.\n\nNHS England is also required under section 14Z59 to conduct a performance assessment of ICBs that must (amongst other things) include how well the ICB has discharged its public involvement duty.\n\nWhile it is statutory guidance for the ICBs and trusts, it supports the vision of integrated care where organisations work in genuine partnership. It is therefore relevant to the entire health and care system.\n\nAccessible diagram text:\n\nThis guidance has the status of:\n\nPolicy for NHS England, under its public involvement duty in the NHS Act 2006, as amended by the Health and Care Act 2022\n\nStatutory guidance for Integrated Care Boards, under its public involvement duty in the NHS Act 2006, as amended by the Health and Care Act 2022\n\nStatutory guidance for NHS trusts and foundation trusts, under their public involvement duty in the NHS Act 2006, as amended by the Health and Care Act 2022\n\nGood practice for other partners in Integrated Care Systems.\n\nFor ICS partners it will be used by:\n\nIntegrated care partnerships (ICPs) to help inform their strategies, during the development of which they must involve people\n\nplace-based partnerships as a guide on how they involve people in decision-making processes and engage them on plans for change\n\nprovider collaboratives, clinical networks and cancer alliances, as it supports working with people on improving whole care pathways across multiple places and systems\n\nhealth and care partners involved in research, as the guidance supports working with communities to identify research needs (both locally and across care pathways), and to be involved in shaping research studies that align with what matters to communities\n\nPrimary care networks for their work at neighbourhood level with local communities, to understand local needs and reduce health inequalities.\n\nIt will also be of interest to other partners within health and care systems as good practice, including local authorities – in particular health overview and scrutiny committees (HOSCs), health and wellbeing boards (HWBs) and other local democratic structures – voluntary community and social enterprise (VCSE) sector organisations, social care providers, local Healthwatch and patient groups. Finally, it is relevant to people interested in how their NHS should work with them.\n\nThis guidance complements separate guidance on involving people in their own health and care (there are legal duties on involving people in their own health and care, covered in separate guidance. An update to this guidance will be published in 2022).\n\nSetting the ambition\n\nThe ambition is for health and care systems to build positive, trusted and enduring relationships with communities to improve services, support and outcomes for people.\n\nThis means a health and care system that:\n\nlistens more and broadcasts less\n\nundertakes engagement which is ongoing and iterative, not only when proposing changes to services\n\nis focussed on and responds to what matters to communities and prioritises hearing from people who have been marginalised and those who experience the worst health inequalities\n\nworks with and through existing networks, community groups and other places where people identify and feel comfortable\n\ndevelops plans and strategies that are fully informed and understood by people and communities\n\nlearns from people and communities, using insight, data and a range of approaches to understand whether their needs are being met and what their priorities, ambitions and ideas are\n\nprovides clear feedback about how people’s involvement leads to improvement\n\ninvests in different approaches to working with people and communities, enabling them to contribute meaningfully in ways that are safe and accessible for them\n\nshares power with communities so they have a greater say in how health services are shaped and can take responsibility to improving their health.\n\nLegal duties and responsibilities\n\nPublic involvement legal duties\n\nThe legal duties on public involvement require organisations to make arrangements to secure that people are appropriately ‘involved’ in planning, proposals and decisions regarding NHS services.\n\nAnnex B provides the detail on these legal duties, when they are likely to apply and how they can be met. Key requirements of ICBs, trusts and NHS England include that they:\n\nassess the need for public involvement and plan and carry out involvement activity\n\nclearly document at all stages how involvement activity has informed decision-making and the rationale for decisions\n\nhave systems to assure themselves that they are meeting their legal duty to involve and report on how they meet it in their annual reports.\n\nICPs, place-based partnerships and provider collaboratives also have specific responsibilities towards participation, summarised below. There are statutory requirements for ICBs and ICPs to produce strategies and plans for health and social care, each with minimum requirements for how people and communities should be involved (see Annex B).\n\nAccessible diagram text:\n\nDifferent parts of the ICS have their own participation responsibilities. The roles of the new organisations and partnerships are described in this diagram along with their participation responsibilities.\n\nIntegrated care board (ICB)\n\nRole: New statutory organisation leading integrating within the NHS, bringing together all those involved in planning and providing NHS services.\n\nParticipation responsibilities:\n\nInvolve people and communities in the planning of services and proposal and decisions having an impact on services\n\nDemonstrate how legal duties have been met at different levels\n\nDevelop integrated health plans with people and communities\n\nCreate strategy on how the ICB will work with people and communities\n\nIntegrated care partnership (ICP)\n\nRole: New statutory committee established by the ICB and relevant local authorities, responsible for developing overarching strategies that cover health, social care and public health and address the wider dominants of health and wellbeing.\n\nParticipation responsibilities:\n\nDevelop integrated care strategies with people and communities\n\nInclude community leaders and independent representatives of local people\n\nLocal authority role in making connections to communities and democratic representatives\n\nPlace-based partnership\n\nRole: Partnerships between the NHS< local government and other system partners working together in a locally defined ‘place’ to collectively plan, deliver and monitor services\n\nParticipation responsibilities:\n\nFully engage those affected by decisions\n\nBuild on existing approaches to involve people in decision-making\n\nSupport PCNs and neighbourhood teams to work with people and communities to strengthen health promotion and treatment\n\nProvider collaborative: Partnership arrangement involving trusts working together within and across system to plan, deliver and transform services\n\nParticipation responsibilities:\n\nShare and build on the good practice that exists in member organisations, such as co-production approaches and links to local communities\n\nUse insight and feedback from patient surveys, complaints data and partners like Healthwatch\n\nTrusts must meet their legal duties to involve people when planning and developing proposals for changes through the collaborative\n\nThe triple aim duty\n\nNHS England, ICBs, NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts are subject to the new ‘triple aim’ duty in the Health and Care Act 2022 (sections 13NA, 14Z43, 26A and 63A respectively). This requires these bodies to have regard to ‘all likely effects’ of their decisions in relation to three areas:\n\nhealth and wellbeing for people, including its effects in relation to inequalities\n\nquality of health services for all individuals, including the effects of inequalities in relation to the benefits that people can obtain from those services\n\nthe sustainable use of NHS resources.\n\nEffective working with people and communities is essential to deliver the triple aim, as shown in the diagram below.\n\nOther relevant legal duties\n\nEffective working with people and communities will also inform and support organisations in meeting other legal duties:\n\nEqualities: The Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) of the Equality Act 2010\n\nHealth inequalities: The National Health Services Act 2006\n\nSocial value: Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012.\n\nAnnex B explains how working with people and communities can help meet these duties.\n\nThe triple aim duty and participation\n\nAccessible diagram text:\n\nWorking with people and communities will help to meet the triple aim duty:\n\n1. Better population health and wellbeing:\n\nHealth inequalities: Improve understanding of the experiences, perspectives and needs of people and communities that experience the worst health inequities, including inclusion health groups, and working together, beyond clinical boundaries, to develop solutions\n\nData and Insight: Accessing data and insight including qualitative data from communities and the VCSE sector, to build knowledge of the communities we service, and the impact of wider dominants of health\n\nAssets: Understanding the assets in our communities that will help to improve population health and wellbeing and to strengthen understanding of community needs and perspectives\n\n2. Better quality of services for individuals:\n\nDesigning services: Designing services in partnership with people so they meet their needs and preferences and reflect experience\n\nApproaches and solutions: Jointly develop improvement approaches and solutions to concerns about quality, including patient safety and experience\n\n3. Improved efficiency and sustainability:\n\nPrioritising resources: Prioritising resources to where they have the greatest impact based on the needs, knowledge and experience of communities\n\nUnderstanding barriers: Understanding the barriers to access which impact on the efficiency and sustainability of services and work together in solutions to address them.\n\nWhy work in partnership?\n\nAccessible diagram text:\n\nThere are several benefits of partnership with people and communities, shown in this diagram:\n\nImproved health outcomes\n\nValue for money\n\nBetter decision-making\n\nImproved quality\n\nAccountability and transparency\n\nParticipating for health\n\nMeeting legal duties\n\nAddressing health inequalities\n\nThe benefits of partnership\n\nImproved health outcomes\n\nWorking in partnership with people and communities creates a better chance of creating services that meet people’s needs, improving their experience and outcomes. People have the knowledge, skills, experiences and connections services need to understand in order to support their physical and mental health. Partnership working contributes to defining ‘shared outcomes’ that meet the needs of their communities (GOV.UK: Health and social care integration: joining up care for people, places and populations. This is particularly relevant in the context of population health management and reducing health inequalities.\n\nValue for money\n\nServices that are designed with people and therefore effectively meet their needs are a better use of NHS resources. They improve health outcomes and reduce the need for further, additional care or treatment because a service did not meet their needs first time.\n\nBetter decision-making\n\nWe view the world through our own lens and that brings its own judgements and biases. Business cases and decision-making are improved when insight from local people is used alongside financial and clinical information to inform the case for change. Their insight can add practical weight and context to statistical data, and fill gaps through local intelligence and knowledge. Challenge from outside voices can promote innovative thinking which can lead to new solutions that would not have been considered had the decision only been made internally.\n\nImproved quality\n\nPartnership approaches mean that services can be designed and delivered more appropriately, because they are personalised to meet the needs and preferences of local people. Without insight from people who use, or may not use, services, it is impossible to raise the overall quality of services. It also improves safety, by ensuring people have a voice to raise problems which can be addressed early and consistently.\n\nAccountability and transparency\n\nThe NHS Constitution states: ‘The system of responsibility and accountability for taking decisions in the NHS should be transparent and clear to the public, patients and staff.’ Organisations should be able to explain to people how decisions are made in relation to any proposal – and how their views have been taken onboard. Transparent decision-making, with people and communities involved in governance, helps make the NHS accountable to communities. Engaging meaningfully with local communities build public confidence and support as well as being able to demonstrate public support for proposals.\n\nParticipating for health\n\nBeing involved can reduce isolation, increase confidence and improve motivation towards wellbeing. Individuals’ involvement in delivering services that are relevant to them and their community can lead to involvement at a service level and to more formal volunteering roles and employment in health and care sectors. It is well recognised that doing something for others and having a meaningful role in your local community supports mental health. Getting involved can be health creating – being part of a community and being in control is good for our health.\n\nMeeting legal duties\n\nAlthough this should not be the primary motivation, failure to meet the relevant legal duties risks legal challenge, with the substantial costs and delays that entails, and damage to relationships and trust and confidence between organisations, people and communities.\n\nReducing health inequalities\n\nJoint solutions\n\nTackling the causes and consequences of health inequalities is a central priority for health and care systems. It is one that has been given new momentum by the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on those people and communities who already face the worst inequalities (Public Health England: COVID-19: review of disparities in risks and outcomes).\n\nHealth inequalities can be reduced by jointly identifying solutions, developed in partnership with people using community-centred approaches. This builds on the approach of CORE20PLUS5 – a national framework that helps define the population groups in each system experiencing health inequalities. Hearing their experiences and understanding the barriers these groups face in accessing care and treatment is an important part of addressing unequal access to services. From there we can work with them to co-create community-centred solutions.\n\nFocussing engagement on groups who have been marginalised and excluded helps tackle the inverse care law, whereby those with the most need for services are the least likely to receive them and least likely to feel safe to participate. By building engagement approaches that include people who are currently not well supported by existing services, systems can design models of care that meet the needs of all their communities and address inequalities. This includes recognising that some communities may require different approaches to meet their needs. Population groups facing the worst health inequalities are often the most disempowered, with the lowest levels of various markers for control, belonging and wellbeing. Working with the most marginalised groups needs to be based on building trust and connection as an important foundation for improving their health outcomes.\n\nCollaborative approaches\n\nThe NHS cannot do this alone. Wider determinates of health – for example, poverty, discrimination, educational attainment, employment and housing – relate to barriers that the NHS by itself cannot overcome. Collaboration brings an opportunity to capture a holistic picture of inequalities and work with people and communities on joined up solutions. Local authorities and other partners are well placed to understand the social determinants of health and how they can be addressed together.\n\nThere is also an opportunity to share power and strengthen relationships with people that experience inequalities. They can be involved in agreeing ambitions, shared outcomes and plans to improve health outcomes through commissioning and service delivery. For example, they could work with the groups identified through CORE20PLUS5 to make decisions collaboratively on how to address their specific health and care needs. This helps ensure intended objectives are relevant, achievable, and based on skills, experiences and what really matters to the people they are intended to help. This means proactively seeking their participation and using approaches that enable diverse communities to contribute and take more control.\n\nIt is important to recognise that boosting the power of communities to make decisions and encouraging them to take more responsibility has a strong health creating effect. If the NHS can support people and communities to take more control, they will be helping to improve health and address inequalities (NHS England will publish guidance on addressing health inequalities in 2022/23).\n\nBuilding a culture of partnership\n\nLeadership is vital to achieving these benefits. Communities and staff will look to system leaders to role model a culture of partnership, to demonstrate that their views are taken seriously and that they prioritise giving people a genuine part in decisions about how services are designed and delivered (Kings Fund: Understanding integration: How to listen to and learn from people and communities. Leadership can be a joint endeavour, with leaders from systems and from within communities working together.\n\nCollaborative and inclusive leadership means seeing participation as everybody’s business and fundamental to meeting shared objectives. This means leadership teams that value participation as part of all their roles and seeking assurance that it is happening within their organisation, rather than being delegated to one individual who is accountable for ensuring it happens. This sets the tone for practitioners and communities to work, learn, and improve together. It creates the culture to enable staff to innovate and collaborate in new ways and gives them permission and autonomy to try things out, to learn and to celebrate success.\n\nThis requires a commitment for sufficient funding, resources, training and support to do so effectively, and allowing time to build trust and relationships. This will support working with all groups of people and communities, including those whose voices are not currently heard in a meaningful way.\n\nSenior leaders and decision-makers will want to make sure that they understand and take action on what matters to people in the decisions that they are responsible for and to work with partners to really make sure that people are at the centre of everything they do. Spending time with local communities, listening to and building understanding about their experiences is essential. This visible leadership helps to unlock potential and demonstrates that working in partnership with people is everyone’s business.\n\nTen principles for working with people and communities\n\nThe guidance is based on ten principles that will help health and care organisations develop their ways of working with people and communities, depending on local circumstances and population health needs.\n\nThey are intended to be a golden thread running throughout systems, whether activity takes place within neighbourhoods, in places, across system geographies or nationally.\n\nThey have been developed from good practice already taking place and are intended to support existing approaches which may exist locally. They will form the basis of NHS England’s assessment of how well integrated care boards meet their legal duties (see 12.1 below). However, they can be used by all organisations to develop effective ways of working in partnership.\n\n1. Ensure people and communities have an active role in decision-making and governance\n\nBuild the voices of people and communities into governance structures so that people are part of decision-making processes\n\nRecognise the collective responsibility at board level for upholding legal duties, bringing in lay perspectives but avoiding creating isolated, independent voices\n\nMake sure that boards and communities are assured that appropriate involvement with relevant groups has taken place (including those facing the worst health inequalities); and that this has an impact on decisions.\n\nEnsure that effective involvement is taking place at the appropriate level, including system, place and neighbourhood, and that there is a consistency and coordination of approaches\n\nSupport people with the skills, knowledge and confidence to contribute effectively to decision-making and governance\n\nMake sure that senior leaders role model inclusive and collaborative ways of working.\n\n2. Involve people and communities at every stage and feed back to them about how it has influenced activities and decisions\n\nTake time to plan and budget for participation and start involving people as early as possible so that it informs options for change and subsequent decision-making\n\nInvolve people and communities on a continual basis, as part of meaningful partnerships, rather than taking a stop-start approach when decisions are required. As a result, there will be much greater, ongoing awareness of the issues, barriers, assets and opportunities\n\nBe clear about the opportunity to influence decisions; what taking part can achieve; and what is out of scope\n\nRecord and celebrate people’s contributions and give feedback on the results of involvement, including changes, decisions made and what has not changed and why\n\nKeep people informed of changes that take place sometime after their involvement and maintain two-way dialogue so people are kept updated and can continue to contribute\n\nTake time to understand what works and what could be improved.\n\n3. Understand your community’s needs, experiences, ideas and aspirations for health and care, using engagement to find out if change is working\n\nUse data about the experiences and aspirations of people who use (and do not use) health and care services, care and support; and have clear approaches to using this information and insight to inform decision-making and quality governance\n\nWork with what is already known by partner organisations, from national and local data sources, and from previous engagement activities including those related to the wider determinants of health\n\nShare data with communities and seek their insight about what lies behind the trends and findings. Their narrative can help inform about the solutions to the problems that the data identifies\n\nUnderstand what other engagement might be taking place on a related topic and take partnership approaches where possible, benefiting from your combined assets. This will also help avoid ‘consultation fatigue’ amongst communities, by working together in an ongoing dialogue that is not limited by organisation boundaries\n\nBuild on existing networks, forums and community activities to reach out to people rather than expecting them to come to you. Be curious and eager to listen; don’t assume you know what people will say or what matters to them\n\nInvolve people in designing evaluation frameworks and deciding what ‘good’ looks like, using measures of change that matter to them. Include evidence collection in engagement plans to demonstrate the impact that working with people and communities has had.\n\n4. Build relationships based on trust, especially with marginalised groups and those affected by inequalities\n\nProactively seek participation from people who experience health inequalities and poorer health outcomes, connecting with trusted community leaders, organisations and networks to support this\n\nConsider how to include people who do not use services, whether because they do not meet their needs or are inaccessible, and reach out to build trust and conversations about what really matters to them\n\nWork with people and communities from the outset, taking time to build trust, listen and understand what their priorities are\n\nBe honest and realistic about what is in scope and where they can set the agenda for change\n\nTailor your approach to engagement to include people in accessible and inclusive ways so you include those who have not taken part before. This includes recognising that some communities will not feel comfortable discussing their issues and needs within wider meetings, so may need bespoke approaches. They may need additional support to take part including reimbursements for their time\n\nWhen reporting on engagement activity, explain the needs and solutions for different communities rather than simply aggregating all data and feedback together. This also supports equality impact assessments.\n\n5. Work with Healthwatch and the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector as key partners\n\nBuild strong partnerships with Healthwatch and the Voluntary Community and Social Enterprise sector to bring their knowledge and reach into local communities. Work with them to facilitate involvement from different groups and develop engagement activities\n\nUnderstand the various types of Voluntary Community and Social Enterprise sector organisations in your area, from larger national charities to local user-led groups, their links to different communities and how the NHS can connect with them\n\nRecognise that resources can be limited and that organisations may need financial support and capacity building to take on partnership roles\n\nWhen commissioning other organisations to work with communities, ensure that decision-makers remain personally involved and hear directly what people or their representatives have to say.\n\n6. Provide clear and accessible public information\n\nDevelop information about plans that is easy to understand, reflecting the communication needs of local communities and testing information where possible\n\nWhere accessible formats such as easy read and translations into other languages are used, these should be ready at the same time as other materials\n\nProviders of NHS care must meet their requirements under the Accessible Information Standard for the information and communication needs of people in their own care. The same principles can be applied for public information so that it is clear and easy to understand, for example, taking steps to ensure that people receive information which they can access and understand, and receive communication support if they need it\n\nBe open and transparent in the way you work, being clear about where decisions are made and the evidence base that informs them. Provide people with an honest picture of the health and care landscape, along with resource limitations and other relevant constraints. Where information must be kept confidential, explain why\n\nMake sure you describe how communities’ priorities can influence decision-making, including how people have influenced research priorities or planning for future health care ambitions; and how people’s views are considered. Also ensure that you regularly feedback to those who shared their views and others about the impact this has made\n\nProvide feedback in inclusive and accessible ways, that suit how people want or are able to receive it\n\nMake sure information on opportunities to get involved is clear and accessible and encourage a wide range of people to take part; including targeting information at particular communities who might traditionally not be involved.\n\n7. Use community-centred approaches that empower people and communities, making connections to what works already\n\nSupport and build on existing community assets, such as activities and venues which already bring people together such as faith communities, schools, community centres, local businesses and community-centred services, including those that involve link workers, community champions and peer support volunteers.\n\nAdopting asset based approaches to community development to understand how these assets can support people’s physical and mental health. Link with local authorities where they already have approaches in place and consider jointly funding.\n\nBuild trust and meaningful relationships in a way that people feel comfortable sharing ideas about opportunities, solutions and barriers. Design, deliver and evaluate solutions together that are built around existing community infrastructure.\n\nRecognise existing volunteering and social action that supports physical and mental health and create the sustainable conditions for them to grow (for example, by providing places to meet, small grants or community development support).\n\n8. Have a range of ways for people and communities to take part in health and care services\n\nChoose the ways of working with people and communities depending on the specific circumstances, ensuring they are relevant, fair and proportionate. Use a combination of approaches where appropriate. The approach that gives the greatest opportunity for people to take part in decision-making should be used that is suitable for the situation.\n\nDesign activities to take place at times and in ways that encourages participation and consider the support people may need to take part, including reimbursements for their time and expenses\n\nRecognise that people are busy and have other priorities such as work and caring responsibilities. Ensure that there are different ways to get involved with varying levels of commitment\n\nInclude approaches such as co-production where professionals share power and have an equal partnership with people to plan, design and evaluate together\n\nUsing different approaches can bring in a wider range of voices beyond those who already contribute and ensure findings are more representative of the whole population\n\nHave clear, achievable and actionable goals that can comprise both quick wins to inspire people, as well as longer term goals that may be more challenging to achieve but may ultimately be more transformative\n\nWhere decisions are genuinely co-produced, then people with lived experience work as equal partners alongside health and care professionals (those with learnt experience), jointly agreeing issues and developing solutions.\n\n9. Tackle system priorities and service reconfiguration in partnership with people and communities\n\nPeople who use health and care services have knowledge and experience that can be used to help make services better. They can put forward cost-effective and sustainable ideas that clinicians and managers have not thought of, which inform planning for future healthcare development\n\nCommunities often have longer memories than the professionals who may change roles and move. Understanding the local history of change that communities have experienced helps to learn and build trust with people\n\nWhen people better understand the need for change, and have been involved in developing the options, they are more likely to advocate the positive outcomes and involve others in the process.\n\n10. Learn from what works and build on the assets of all health and care partners – networks, relationships and activity in local places\n\nCollaborate with partners across your system to build on their skills, knowledge, connections and networks\n\nReduce duplication by understanding what is already known and what has already been asked, before designing the approach to engagement.\n\nLearn from approaches taken elsewhere in the country and how they can be adapted and applied locally\n\nPlan together across systems so that partnership work with people and communities is co-ordinated, making the most of partners’ skills and networks.\n\nAnnex A: Implementation\n\nA1 – Different ways of working with people and communities\n\nThis chapter sets out a variety of approaches to working with people and communities however there is no ‘one size fits all’. The options for doing so will vary depending on the context and objectives, and there needs to be flexibility depending on the aims and scale of the programme.\n\nA blended approach can also work well, with different approaches and ways of working used at different stages of a project to build a more detailed picture of what matters to people and what improvements can be made.\n\nSome of the main ways to work with people are set out below. They each offer different levels of involvement, from sharing information through to more extensive ways of working such as co-design and co-production, where there is a greater opportunity for people to have influence. As a general principle, partnership should be achieved by using the most effective approach (or combination of approaches) as is feasible and suitable in any given situation.\n\nStarting with people means going to the neighbourhoods and places where they already are and begin by listening to them about their priorities. From this we can design approaches that should ensure relevant communities can take part, recognising that different approaches work better for different groups.\n\nDifferent ways of working with people and communities\n\nAccessible diagram text:\n\nThis diagram shows some of the different ways of working with people and communities, with examples for each\n\nInform: Sharing information about proposed changes so people understand what they mean. Examples are Letters, emails or social media, and information on notice boards in local community facilities\n\nConsult: Asking for people’s opinions on one or more ideas or options. An example is a formal public consultation to gather views and ensure they are considered appropriately, including webinars, public meetings and surveys\n\nEngage: Listening to people to understand issues and discuss ideas for change. Examples are focus groups or interview, citizens’ panels and deliberative engagement, patient and public membership on decision-making committees and boards, and patient forums and advisory groups\n\nCo-design: Designing with people and incorporating their ideas into the final approach. Examples are service redevelopment tools such as Experience Based Co-Design and co-design sessions for people with lived and learnt experience\n\nCo-production: An equal partnership where people with lived and learnt experience work together from start to finish. An example is community development approaches including asset mapping, appreciative inquiry and community conversations.\n\nFor all the approaches used, there are three main pitfalls to avoid:\n\nTick box exercises. Involvement is not an obstacle to overcome on the way to achieving a predetermined outcome. Any perception that it is tokenistic or that a strategy or service change has not been informed by insight from the public, will not only undermine trust, it is unlikely to be supported at local, regional or national level.\n\nUnrealistic timescales. Service design and service changes should be planned to achievable timescales that allow for early, ongoing and effective public involvement, including careful consideration and discussion of the views expressed by people and communities.\n\nLimiting public dialogue to service change proposals. While consultations necessarily focus on the proposals being consulted on, involvement should not only take place when a system wants to make changes – it should be part of how every system operates, with insights from community conversations informing and driving policy decisions. Systems should be in regular dialogue with people and communities; enabling them to also influence the agenda.\n\nExisting sources of feedback and insight\n\nThe starting point for any involvement is to consider existing sources of insight about the needs and experiences of different groups of people – what do you already know, what have people already told you? A review of existing information can save time and money and point to gaps in insight, while also avoiding asking people to repeat themselves. This helps to ensure that involvement is focused, meaningful and avoids duplication. This may be information held by partner organisations, including patient feedback, complaints, needs assessments and insights collected during previous activities. Consider whether the context of this previous work has changed significantly and when it took place to understand whether it is still relevant.\n\nInvolving partners in the planning process helps identify what is already known and also where the gaps are. Some people, such as those in inclusion health groups (see next chapter) and others who face social exclusion, may be systematically missed in feedback, qualitative and quantitative data sources. For example, if existing ways to give feedback are not accessible for people with learning disabilities, then their views are more likely to be missing.\n\nOne source of insight into population health needs are the intelligence functions that ICSs are building. These are system-wide, multi-disciplinary collaborations which share data and provide analytical support to help understand their local contexts. A key purpose of the intelligence function will be to support a population health management approach to care, including by pooling information and data held by partners on a local population’s health and care needs, such as granular intelligence on inequalities across different population groups (see NHS England resources for more on population health management). Intelligence functions should work with patient experience and engagement colleagues to ensure that qualitative and quantitative insights about the population are informing the interpretation of other analyses and are given equal weight in decision-making. Contextualising this intelligence with people and communities is essential and needs to be undertaken in sensitive and accessible ways.\n\nICBs and trusts can work in partnership with local authorities (in particular local health scrutiny functions and public health, social care and housing teams), other ICS partners and local communities to share insight and develop a detailed understanding of population health needs. A combination of national data tools, insight collected by partners and local engagement can be used to understand what works for different communities. Combined with insights drawn from the community, data can support primary care and neighbourhood teams to increase uptake of preventative services while also tackling health inequalities by identifying those groups that may currently be underserved (Next steps for integrating primary care: Fuller Stocktake report, NHS England, May 2022). One approach some ICSs are taking is to set up a network of engagement colleagues across partner organisations to share insight and coordinate engagement (see case study below).\n\nExamples of insight and feedback sources:\n\n·National patient surveys\n\nFriends and Family Test\n\nLocal surveys and engagement by the NHS and local authorities\n\nSocial media and review websites\n\nLocal Healthwatch reports and Healthwatch England national reports\n\nIntelligence from the VCSE sector and local authorities\n\nCare Quality Commission (CQC) reviews, surveys and reports\n\nPatient Participation Groups (PPGs)\n\nComplaints and compliments\n\nPatient Experience Library\n\nPatient Safety Specialists\n\nPatient experience discussions at System Quality Groups\n\nStaff feedback including their own views\n\nMapping of previous consultation and engagement activities including those by partner organisations\n\nLocal Health Profiles\n\nICS intelligence functions\n\nLocal authority reports including Director of Public Health annual report, joint strategic needs assessment and joint health and wellbeing strategy and reviews by scrutiny committees.\n\nPatient participation groups\n\nIt is a contractual requirement for every GP practice to have a Patient Participation Group (PPG). The form a PPG takes is not specified and this provides flexibility for practices to work in partnership with people and communities in ways that best support the practice populations. While the PPG is one of the main ways General Practice have used to engage with patients, it should not be the only approach if it does not reach diverse groups, people with the worst health inequalities or people not accessing the services. These groups are more likely to be hesitant about getting involved in traditional PPG models. However, PPGs do not need to be limited to the meeting style group which has become the most common. Primary care networks (PCNs) and practices need to consider if the form of the present PPG supports people to take part or if other approaches are also needed to widen participation. This animation has some useful principles to use as a starting point to think through how practices currently hear the voice of their community and where the gaps are. While the main focus of a PPG is on making improvements to its local practice, their insight and experiences can be relevant to its PCN. PCNs can also learn from their practices’ PPGs about how different structures can effectively engage diverse groups.\n\nCo-production\n\nCo-production is a way to involve people by sharing power with them. The Coalition for Personalised Care defines co-production as:\n\n‘a way of working that involves people who use health and care services, carers and communities in equal partnership; and which engages groups of people at the earliest stages of service design, development and evaluation.’\n\nCo-production can be used strategically, to design services, make quality improvements, design and undertake research and innovation, and develop participatory budgets. At an individual level, it is the cornerstone of person-centred care such as personal health budgets. As well as being well suited to designing services in places and neighbourhoods, it can also be applied strategically for systems and national organisations.\n\nThe starting principle is that people with ‘lived experience’ are often best placed to advise on what support and services will make a positive difference to their lives. When done well, co-production helps to ground discussions and to maintain a person-centred perspective.\n\nWhere partnerships are genuinely equal, professionals are comfortable with not having the answers and with sharing resources, responsibility and power. This can be difficult to achieve without cultural change and support for staff and people to share power and take on co-production roles.\n\nThe Coalition for Personalised Care sets out the values and practical steps to make this ambition a reality. These includes:\n\nsenior leaders supporting co-production through culture and behaviour\n\nidentifying areas of work where co-production can have a genuine impact and involving people at the earliest stages\n\ninvesting in training and development so that people with lived experience and people working in the system know what co-production is and how to work in ways that enable this.\n\nCommunity-centred approaches\n\nCommunity-centred approaches build on existing assets to support communities to take more control over their lives and their areas. The diagram below shows the different types of assets that can contribute to creating health. These approaches (which include community development, asset and strength-based approaches) help identify the issues that matter to local people and support them in tackling them, working with the relevant public sector organisations.\n\nAccessible diagram text:\n\nThere are different types of community health assets which are shown in the diagram:\n\nThe resources and facilities within the public, private and VCSE sectors\n\nPhysical, environmental and economic resources that enhance wellbeing\n\nFriendships, good neighbours, local groups and community and voluntary associations\n\nThe skills, knowledge and commitment of individual community members.\n\nRecognising assets rather than deficits is an important aspect of how to tackle health inequalities. It builds on strengths and ensures that health action co-produced between communities and services so that it effectively meets local needs. Identifying community assets also reduces the possibility that new interventions inadvertently override what already works well or are not fully used because people still defer to preferred and trusted community initiatives\n\nThis can require a shift in how health services view their communities and, like co-production, requires leadership and support to make a reality. It can need time and sustained effort before communities can take collective control. Asset based approaches are already well established in parts of local authorities and social care so there may be opportunities to learn from local authority partners (Evidence for strengths and asset-based outcomes, Social Care Institute of Excellence, August 2019).\n\nPeople often relate closely to their neighbourhood where links between communities and services can be strongest. Neighbourhoods contain a wide range of roles which work closely with their communities including community nurses, GPs, pharmacists, community and mental health teams, Social Prescribing Link Workers, social workers, housing workers and VCSE sector organisations. There are also community-led services, such as peer support workers and community champions whose roles are designed to address local needs and health inequalities.\n\nPrimary care networks that are most effective in improving population health and tackling health inequalities are those that work in partnership with their people and communities and local authority colleagues (Next steps for integrating primary care: Fuller Stocktake report, NHS England, May 2022; Health Creation: How can Primary Care Networks succeed in reducing health inequalities? The Health Creation Alliance, February 2020). This includes using co-production to work with marginalised groups to break down barriers to accessing healthcare. In some neighbourhoods general practice is the hub through which many relationships are built between the community and the health and care system. In other neighbourhoods, partnerships are led by others, so it is important that health supports and builds on these existing networks rather than reinventing something new. There is an opportunity to leverage the knowledge and expertise of different workforce groups, including general practice, housing, policing and schools about the concerns and priorities of their communities, including its most vulnerable members whose voices are less likely to be heard.\n\nCommunities organise themselves in many ways and understanding where and how they do this is crucial to reaching and hearing diverse voices. An integral part of building a system-wide approach to involvement is to start at neighbourhood level with understanding what matters to people’s health and the assets they have. It means that engagement should start with where people are already and aggregate findings to make the links to wider geographies.\n\nCommunity-centred approaches help understand the specific local context where people live their lives and so design more integrated and preventative interventions that are tailored to local needs. These early public physical and mental health responses can prevent the need for acute services. These can be co-delivered by communities, employing local people and making the best use of the assets in each neighbourhood. This boosts the power of communities to take responsibility and set an agenda for change which has a strong health creating effect.\n\nWhile for many people their community is at the level of neighbourhood, they may also belong to wider communities. For example, as a member of a national support group for a rare condition, where peers help each other to understand treatment options.\n\nA2. Key considerations for all approaches\n\nWhile the approaches to working with people and communities depend on the specific context, there are some universal considerations that apply. These help meet the legal duties and ensure that people are supported to take part safely.\n\nFair and proportionate approaches\n\nWhichever approach is taken, it needs to be fair and proportionate. Judgement is needed and it is not an area where definitive advice can be offered without knowledge of the specific circumstances. Where staff need to make a particularly complex or potentially contentious judgement, they may wish to consider seeking legal advice.\n\nThe courts have established guiding principles for what constitutes a fair consultation exercise, known as the Gunning principles:\n\nconsultation must take place when the proposal is still at a formative stage\n\nsufficient information and reasons must be put forward for the proposal to allow for intelligent consideration and response\n\nadequate time must be given for consideration and response\n\nthe product of consultation must be conscientiously taken into account.\n\nFor more information, see Annex B5. These four principles relate to formal consultation but can be informative for other approaches.\n\nThe approach should also be proportionate. NHS organisations need to meet their duties to involve the public alongside their duties to act effectively, efficiently and economically and make sustainable use of NHS resources.\n\nStaff will need to consider the impact of proposals on the different groups of people who may be affected. Generally, the greater the extent of changes and number of people affected, the greater the level of activity that is likely to be necessary. However, the nature and extent of public involvement required will always depend on the specific circumstances.\n\nDecisions in urgent situations\n\nIn an urgent situation, it may be necessary to consider the duty to involve the public alongside the public interest in maintaining continuity of care and protecting the health, safety or welfare of patients or staff.\n\nIt will only be reasonable to justify carrying out a limited (or no) public involvement exercise on grounds of urgency when the lack of time was genuinely caused by an urgent situation or where there is a genuine risk to the health, safety or welfare of patients or staff. These can arise from staff shortages, estate issues or other causes. It does not permit commissioners or providers to leave public involvement until the last moment without enough time to carry out a fair and proportionate exercise, when the public could and should have been involved earlier or to a greater extent.\n\nWhere urgent changes are made on a temporary basis, the legal duties still apply if organisations subsequently consider whether to make them permanent. This equally applies when changes were introduced because of the COVID-19 pandemic; public involvement should be undertaken if there are plans to make them permanent.\n\nICBs, Provider collaboratives and Trusts are encouraged to maintain an open and ongoing dialogue with ICP members and Health Overview and Scrutiny Committees on the services it regards as at risk and the actions it may need to take in order to maintain patient and staff safety. This can fulfil a valuable function in anticipating and evaluating the impact on patients of urgent changes made in these circumstances and ensuring that health inequalities are not increased. Of course, organisations that have in place ongoing mechanisms of working with people and communities will be in a much better position to undertake rapid engagement as an interim measure.\n\nEquality considerations\n\nPublic authorities including ICBs, trusts and NHS England are required to comply with the public sector equality duty of the Equality Act 2010. When it comes to proposals for changes to services, carrying out an equality and health inequality impact assessment can help identify people who experience the greatest health inequalities, including socio-economic groups and those people with protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 who may be affected by a particular plan or decision.\n\nThe Health Equity Assessment Tool can also help identify what action needs to be taken to reduce health inequalities and promote equality and inclusion.\n\nThese can be used alongside the Equality Delivery System for the NHS, a framework to help local NHS organisations, in discussion with local partners including local communities, to review and improve their performance for people who share protected characteristics.\n\nApproaches to working with people should be designed to include these groups and planned to ensure that they are fair and equitable. Involvement plans should consider how to include all groups affected by proposals for changes to services and prioritise hearing from those affected by the greatest inequalities. In practical terms this means recognising that not every type of involvement works for everyone and that there can be additional complexities to work effectively with some groups, so you may have to carry out a range of activities. This can mean:\n\nusing accessible venues, making reasonable adjustments or specific effort to ensure disabled people, autistic people and people with a learning disability can participate\n\nworking with peer support workers to facilitate the involvement of people who may be struggling with their mental health\n\ntargeting resources and approaches at ethnic minority groups to provide the additional support that some of their members will need because of the health disparities that they experience\n\nrecognising that deprivation and poverty can prevent people taking part in activities unless financial support and resources are in place that enable their involvement\n\nconsidering health literacy levels and language. Content should be relatable rather than using NHS terms and acronyms. Jargon can be a barrier for everyone\n\naccounting for digital literacy and access to digital systems in areas of socioeconomic deprivation\n\nbuilding people’s knowledge of how different parts of the health and care system fit together and where their input will make a difference. People will be at different levels of understanding about the NHS structures.\n\nAuditing and monitoring the participation of certain groups, for example in events and formal governance roles, should be undertaken. This will help identify any gaps in engagement requiring attention; and supports staff to promote the involvement of people who are more reflective of the population in question.\n\nWhilst the Equality Act refers specifically to the protected characteristics, there are also other communities such as inclusion health groups that should be considered and included within engagement.\n\nInclusion Health Groups\n\nThese groups often experience the worst health inequalities through being at risk or living with extremely poor health because of poverty, marginalisation, multi-morbidity and social exclusion, and further impacted by discrimination and stigmatisation, and are not consistently accounted for in electronic records (such as healthcare databases). These can overlap with protected characteristic groups. These are any socially excluded population including, but not limited to:\n\nGypsies, Roma, Travellers, Showmen and Liveaboard Boaters\n\npeople experiencing homelessness\n\npeople experiencing alcohol and/or drug dependence\n\nsex workers\n\nvulnerable migrants and refugees\n\nyoung carers\n\nvictims of modern slavery\n\npeople in contact with the criminal justice system.\n\nThere are other groups that experience barriers to accessing services, like people with a learning disability and autistic people, and people with severe mental illness. They can also belong to inclusion health groups.\n\nIt is essential to understand the barriers that the system inadvertently creates to the involvement of inclusion health groups. Approaches should be developed in partnership with trusted organisations and people with lived experience and seek to ensure that involvement means that people’s voices are heard and understood. These may be national organisations where there is not the local expertise of working with specific groups. Approaches must be trauma informed (see box below), culturally aware and provide a psychologically informed environment for people to take part safely.\n\nPCNs can use a self-assessment tool to assess their engagement with inclusion health groups. Further guidance on inclusion health is on the GOV.UK website.\n\nThe impact of wider experiences\n\nApproaches to involvement should be designed to take account of the contexts that people live their lives in and should recognise that everyone experiences health services differently. It should start from a position of building trust, safety, and shared understanding.\n\nThis means recognising and reflecting the wider lived experiences of the people we work with and how this can affect how they participate. We should also involve people and communities in a way that considers how social determinants (such as racism, stigma, discrimination, poverty, access to greenspace and healthy food, poor housing, employment and education) affect physical and mental health. It means recognising intersectionality – that people are affected by several overlapping characteristics and experiences. They can face multiple sources of exclusion, discrimination and disadvantage, which will affect how they want to participate and their perceptions of health and care services.\n\nIt is also important to consider that previous involvement experiences, both good and bad, can affect how someone wants to be involved. For example, a bad hospital appointment where someone feels like they have not been listened to, could influence how they respond to invitations to get involved. These things may not seem directly relevant to the conversation you want to have but can matter a lot to those you are wanting to engage.\n\nThere is a responsibility to keep people who get involved safe. Being asked repeatedly to go back over bad or even traumatic experiences so professionals can learn how to improve services, will cause distress and increase lack of trust. One way to keep people safe is not to create isolated positions of ‘lay representation’ which can burden people with the responsibility of bringing a public perspective to a large group of professionals. Instead it can be better to work with groups who can continue to support each other outside of meetings and help each other to take part effectively. Depending on the context, it may be necessary to arrange therapeutic support at activities and afterwards.\n\nTrauma informed approaches\n\nWorking with people and communities should start from a position of building trust, physical and psychological safety, and shared understanding. It acknowledges what may be difficult. Trauma informed approaches are often partnership based, working with people and organisations that are trusted, well informed and specifically trained. VCSE sector organisations can have a particular role to work with people who have often experienced significant trauma in their life or who have been excluded by society. Working with community leaders, experts by experience and others who already hold people’s trust is often a more appropriate way of reaching people. Acknowledging and validating people’s previous and current negative experiences are a key part of this, alongside building shared understanding and authentic relationships.\n\nWest Yorkshire Health and Care Partnership has collated resources on trauma informed approaches.\n\nSupporting people to take part\n\nIt is important to have a consistent approach to recruiting, training and supporting the range of people who get involved in different roles. This helps ensure they have the knowledge, skills and confidence to contribute effectively, and that opportunities are equally accessible to people on low incomes and those with health and social care needs or disabilities.\n\nThe level of support needed will partly depend on the role. Those with ongoing involvement or which include decision-making activities as part of co-production approaches may require specific training, for example to help people to understand their own lived experience in the wider context and have the skills and confidence to influence professionals. This could also include having pre-meetings to help people explore the issues and check their understanding, as well as follow-up debriefs.\n\nIt is good practice for organisations to have a written policy giving details about their approach to reimbursing and paying people. A policy helps to clarify the situation for everyone and avoids people being treated differently on different occasions. There are advantages to developing a consistent approach across organisations within an ICS so that people can easily understand whether and how they will be reimbursed. Any policy on payments will need to be compliant with HMRC rules.\n\nConsider the resources required to take part, including the cost to an individual of travelling to a meeting or attending online, especially where they may have limited income or no recourse to public funds. Payments can support participation from more diverse groups and helps recognise the value that organisations place on people contributing their experiences, knowledge and skills. Organisations paying people for their time as part of involvement activities have a responsibility to ensure that people who receive benefits are supported with independent welfare rights advice.\n\nBeyond financial means, there are many ways to recognise people’s contributions including receiving an acknowledgement in writing, support to develop skills and experience, and seeing the improvements made because of their input. Ask people what form of recognition they would value and would support them to take part.\n\nIt is important to recognise that there can be a cost to partner organisations such as VCSE organisations or Local Healthwatch. This can be in terms of staff time to provide insight or to take part in advisory groups as well as arranging for communities to participate in engagement activities.\n\nThere are also practical considerations to ensure different people can take part by making activities accessible, such as when and where they take place, making reasonable adjustments so everyone can take part, provision of British Sign Language and community language interpretating, and providing accessible information. This links to the recognition that a range of approaches are likely to be needed to involve relevant groups, and that we should go to where they are already, rather than expect them to come to us.\n\nNHS England has a patient and public voice partners policy that sets out how it supports people to be involved in its work. It sets out the different types of roles people can do and includes support and training. There is also a policy on reimbursements and payments.\n\nA3. Collaboration between the NHS and other partners\n\nThis chapter sets out how different organisations can collaborate on how they work with people and communities. Collaboration is about building relationships with partner organisations and local communities, treating all partners equitably with a valid and useful contribution to make to the health and care system.\n\nThe partners highlighted in the diagram below can help systems to work with people and communities in terms of contributing views, sharing insights and providing outreach. It is not an exhaustive list and systems should map the different partners in their areas to understand how they can work with them.\n\nLocal authorities, social care providers and the Voluntary Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE) sector may already have well-established mechanisms for including people in decision-making and, where possible, NHS organisations should use the insights from these and work through existing forums and activities, rather than setting up new ones.\n\nThere is also an opportunity to coordinate working with people and communities. For example, an integrated care board (ICB) and a trust can work together on engagement over changes to hospital services for which they both may have public involvement duties. Their approach could include working with existing forums run by the local authority, or commissioning Healthwatch and the VCSE sector to engage the communities they already have links with.\n\nJoining up conversations across sectors and coming together to involve people about what matters to them can lead to significant improvements and reduces the need for people to contribute separately to each organisation.\n\nPartners for the NHS on working with people and communities\n\nAccessible diagram text:\n\nDifferent partners shown in the diagram are: local authorities and councillors, social care providers, Healthwatch, the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector, Social Prescribing Link Workers, volunteer and peer roles, non-executive roles, workforce, other health and care partners\n\nLocal authorities and councillors\n\nLocal authorities are important partners in working with people and communities. Their membership of integrated care system’s (ICSs) brings their experience of working with people to design and deliver services that meet local needs and build community assets.\n\nThe Boards of each ICB must include at least one ‘partner member’ jointly nominated by the local authorities within the area of the ICB. The ICB, and each responsible local authority wholly or partly within the ICB’s area, must establish an integrated care partnership (ICP) as a statutory committee of the ICB.\n\nAll local authorities have a role in delivering better health and care and influencing people’s health outcomes through the operation of a wide range of statutory powers and duties. These include those relating to children and young people, health and wellbeing, adult social care, housing, environment protection and planning, to name just a few. As such they are all important partners in working with people and communities. Partnerships should exist with councils, including district and other councils such as town or parish councils, and beyond the formal membership of the ICB and ICP.\n\nLocal authorities are key partners in designing and commissioning person-centred services. They also have expertise in co-production – especially in relation to direct payments for social care.\n\nThey often employ community development workers with experience of community-centred approaches. They are also significant funders of local VCSE sector organisations providing care and support to communities.\n\nCouncil public health teams work closely with their diverse communities to provide information and support to improve population health and address health inequalities.\n\nCouncillors are elected to represent their local communities at ward level. They have detailed knowledge of the communities they serve, including their concerns around health services and the wider determinants of health. They have links to community resources and networks, including neighbourhood forums, and a reach into their communities.\n\nCounty council and unitary authorities are responsible for health and wellbeing boards – inclusive place-based forums in which political, clinical, professional and community leaders agree shared priorities to improve the health and wellbeing of their communities. The boards have a statutory duty to develop and publish joint strategic needs assessments (JSNA), an invaluable source of information on an area’s demographics and the profiles of local communities. The boards are required to publish joint health and wellbeing strategies (JHWS) that identify the priorities for improving health and wellbeing and the actions needed to achieve this. ICBs and their partner trusts must involve the boards in producing the new joint forward plan for each ICS (see Annex B5). In many cases, the JSNA and JHWS are developed with extensive collaboration and co-production with communities and with people who use services.\n\nUnitary and county councils have powers and duties in respect of Health Overview and Scrutiny. This role is usually carried out by a Health and Overview Scrutiny Committee (HOSC) of the local authority for its local area or a joint HOSC appointed by two or more local authorities to cover a larger area. Working with scrutiny can help systems take a wider perspective and develop effective partnership working.\n\nMore information on when consultation with HOSC is required and the role of HOSCs more generally is contained in Annex B.\n\nSocial care providers\n\nSocial care is the term used to describe the personal care given by public or private organisations to help people in society who need specialised assistance to live a comfortable, healthy, fulfilling life. Services aim to provide care for and protect society’s most vulnerable and this could include children, young people, adults or older people.\n\nSocial care providers can bring an understanding of the needs of the people they support, with advocacy and insight into their experience in the current systems and what will make those better. Social care providers often have frequent and long-lasting connections with the people they work with and can support connections and relationship-building with them. Social care providers can also be experienced at working with co-production so that people can actively shape their care and support they receive.\n\nHealthwatch\n\nHealthwatch is the independent body responsible for understanding the needs, experiences and concerns of people who use health and social care services, and to ensure their views are put at the heart of their care.\n\nIts activities include:\n\npromoting the involvement of local people in health and care services\n\nenabling people to monitor standards of care and how services can be improved\n\nobtaining their views and experiences of services.\n\nAt a national level, Healthwatch England provides leadership and support to local Healthwatch organisations. Its other statutory functions include escalating concerns raised by local Healthwatch to the CQC, and to provide advice to Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, NHS England and English local authorities, especially where they hold the view that the quality of services provided are not adequate.\n\nThe Health and Social Care Act 2012 put the focus of local Healthwatch at top-tier local authority level. The development of ICSs means that Healthwatch will need to work at both system and place levels if local voices are to be property represented where decisions are made. As local Healthwatch are not ordinarily funded to do this work at system level, ICBs and ICPs will need to consider what additional support Healthwatch will need to make an effective contribution.\n\nProviders of health and social care services are under a duty to allow entry by local Healthwatch. This power to ‘enter and view’ services, offers a way for Healthwatch to undertake their activities and allows them to identify what is working well with services and where they could be improved. Healthwatch can use this evidence to make recommendations and inform changes both for individual services and across the system. There are requirements for the service providers to respond to a Healthwatch report and its recommendations within a set timeframe.\n\nThrough their role in obtaining views of local people about their needs and experiences of care, local Healthwatch can provide insight about the breadth of health and care, particularly picking up on issues which go beyond a single service such as integration and the impact on people. ICSs should build on the existing statutory activities of local Healthwatch in their geographies, working with the organisations to resource the co-ordination and analysis of user experience data. This will complement insight collected by commissioners and providers.\n\nSystems can also work with local Healthwatch to involve local people. One of their functions is to support the involvement of local people in the commissioning, provision and scrutiny of care services. Their scrutiny function means they can make recommendations of service improvements to commissioners, providers, Healthwatch England and the CQC. These functions help them have knowledge of how to work effectively with local communities and how services can be improved to meet local needs.\n\nLocal Healthwatch must be involved in developing joint strategic needs assessments and integrated care strategies (see Annex B5). Healthwatch organisations may provide views, reports and recommendations on decisions and decision-making processes based on the evidence available. This includes the option to refer issues to overview and scrutiny where they feel it is appropriate (see Annex B3).\n\nLocal Healthwatch organisations have a place on their local Health and Wellbeing Boards, so they can present people’s views in strategic discussions. They can have strong relationships with local authorities, working with both service delivery and elected members.\n\nMany ICSs already have some system-level arrangements in place with their local Healthwatch. Arrangements for how Healthwatch can work at both system and place level will vary depending on the geography of the system and different local authority commissioning arrangements. ICSs should consider how they can invest in these partnerships in order that Healthwatch has the resource to take on their roles effectively, including commissioning them to undertake engagement or fulfil the roles at system level.\n\nWhile Healthwatch have different roles from VCSE sector organisations, their shared values mean they should be seen as complementary rather than competing (and many Healthwatch are hosted by VCSE sector organisations). Strong relationships with both will help ICSs hear the voices of people at all levels.\n\nThe voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) sector\n\nOrganisations within the VCSE sector have many different roles. They are often providers of services (both commissioned and funded through voluntary or charitable income) to the most disadvantaged communities and consequently can have an excellent understanding of the health and care issues faced by those communities. The sector has a key role in tackling the wider determinants of health by reaching people who experience health inequalities and removing barriers to accessing services. At both national and local levels, the VCSE sector has an important contribution to make in shaping and providing health and care services, and in developing and implementing plans to tackle wider determinants of health.\n\nVCSE sector organisations can bring their knowledge of how to work with people and communities:\n\nthey are often trusted, accessible and skilled at outreach and engagement\n\nthey have routes into and established relationships with different groups, especially those that experience health inequalities, and can help communicate with them\n\nthey provide expertise in directly working with people and communities in service planning and delivery, including experience of community-centred approaches\n\nthey have knowledge of the needs and strengths of those they work with and can support them to be more directly involved in health and care strategies and plans.\n\nWithin ICSs, VCSE sector partnerships should be embedded in how they operate (see the 2021 integrate care system implementation guidance on partnerships with the VCSE sector). All ICBs should have a formal agreement to work with the VCSE sector in governance and decision-making, building on their existing involvement in place and neighbourhood level forums, and where they have well-established relationships with other NHS organisations and partnerships such as Cancer Alliances. This agreement should consider the role of infrastructure organisations including the new VCSE Alliances or leadership groups that can bring strategic voice to governance of ICSs.\n\nDepending on the engagement taking place, it may mean working with national VCSE sector organisations. For example, if redesigning the pathway for a rare condition, there may not be relevant groups in the system, but a national organisation could advise on what approaches to take and help contact people.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, health inequalities manifest at highly localised levels, such as wards. Community organisations are close to the ground and with strong intelligence about their communities. These organisations may not be members of system level partnerships. As such, it is vital that they are factored into the design of engagement and co-production processes to reduce the risk of unintentionally excluding local voices.\n\nIt is also important to work with informal groups and networks such as user-led organisations, peer support groups and advocacy organisations. Many people who are excluded or stigmatised by society are often involved in their own community group or user-led organisation.\n\nVCSE sector capacity and infrastructure will vary between areas and some organisations will have only limited resources to facilitate and support engagement. They may need financial support to meet the costs of staff time, training or the direct costs of carrying out engagement with communities. Commissioning VCSE organisations to lead engagement with the groups they work with supports investment in community assets and can secure wider benefits by strengthening local organisations. Building longer-term partnerships beyond short-term projects can support financial planning and build the sector’s resilience so that they can help tackle health challenges.\n\nThe COVID-19 response saw organisations across the VCSE sector support people and communities. Through ICSs there is an opportunity to deepen partnerships with VCSE sector organisations and, if this does not already exist, to amplify the voices of the communities they work with in decisions about health and care. For more information see Creating Partnerships for Success, NCVO, January 2020 and How health and care systems can work better with the VCSE sector, NHS Confederation, August 2020.\n\nSocial prescribing link workers\n\nSocial prescribing link workers (SPLWs) support people with practical, social or emotional needs that affect their physical and mental health. As part of primary care networks, SPLWs work with people to co-produce a simple personalised care and support plan (PCSP) which includes medical needs alongside psycho-social needs. It is a planning process which leads to activities or solutions of care which support the person’s goals, and works with the person’s skills, strengths, and preferences. It addresses the things that are not working in the person’s life and identifies outcomes and actions to resolve these. This could include connecting people to a range of activities, groups and services in their local community, including supporting people to acces"
