        "text": "The government has called for \"pragmatism\" from all sides as Derby County's future hangs in the balance.\n\nThe Championship side is in administration with severe debt and faces expulsion from the league if it cannot prove it can fund the rest of the season by 1 February.\n\nBut administrators say legal cases brought against the Rams by other clubs are delaying a takeover.\n\nThe matter was raised by several MPs in the House of Commons on Tuesday.\n\nConservative MP for Mid Derbyshire Pauline Latham, who secured the urgent question, said: \"Derby County Football Club cannot be allowed to be removed by the English Football League (EFL) on February 1.\n\n\"Is the minister convinced the EFL is acting fast enough to resolve the football debts issue before the deadline or will they extend it?\"\n\nCulture minister Chris Philp said \"urgent pragmatism\" was required from the governing body, the administrators and the Rams.\n\nHe said: \"We do want to see the EFL work urgently and pragmatically and rapidly to resolve these outstanding issues which are in the way of a takeover by a new owner, who we hope can invest the money needed to turn the club around.\n\n\"He [sports minister Nigel Huddleston] is pressing the EFL very hard on these points.\n\n\"We should be clear that governance surrounding the administration of Derby County Football Club is a matter for the EFL, the administrator and the club.\n\n\"But the government takes a very close interest in this.\"\n\n'Obstacles'\n\nDerby County went into administration in September and have been docked 21 points for breaching EFL financial rules.\n\nAdministrators Quantuma said efforts to secure a buyer were being hampered by outstanding legal cases involving Middlesbrough and Wycombe Wanderers.\n\nBoth clubs are seeking compensation for loss of earnings in relation to the Rams' financial breaches.\n\nHowever, both have also indicated they are willing to discuss a compromise.\n\nLabour MP for Derby South, Margaret Beckett, added: \"Mr Philp said in his opening remarks that nobody wants to see the club go under. Well, some of us are beginning to wonder.\n\n\"If inadvertently this were to happen because the football league was unable to remove the obstacles which at the moment they appear to be so firmly putting in Derby County's way, none of those participating in it will be forgiven.\"\n\nThe EFL said it was committed to resolving \"a complex legal position\" surrounding the club's future.\n\nIn a statement, it said: \"The current situation remains challenging as Middlesbrough and Wycombe Wanderers consider their claims should be protected under the terms of the Insolvency Policy. The administrators disagree.\""
