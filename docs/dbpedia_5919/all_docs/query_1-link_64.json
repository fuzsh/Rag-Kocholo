        "text": "One aspect of Derby senior Addy Brown’s game repeatedly surfaced during her final time in a Panther uniform earlier this month at the Class 6A girls basketball tournament.\n\nBrown smiled. A lot.\n\nThe setting – a third-place game in Wichita’s Koch Arena just hours after a hard-fought semifinal loss – isn’t always joyous for those who participate. But with one of Brown’s counterparts, Blue Valley junior Jayden Wooten, frequently engaging her in friendly banter, the Panther standout appeared happy and at ease.\n\n“I was upset we weren’t playing for the championship,” said Brown, a two-time KSHSAA Covered All-State selection. “I wasn’t the happiest after we lost. But Coach (Dan) Harrison and my parents told me you can decide how you want this to go. You can hang your head and show up tomorrow and wish you were in the championship game, or you can show up and play for third and end your career on a win.”\n\nBrown, a multi-talented 6-foot-3 forward, chose the latter. She scored 19 points and grabbed 16 rebounds, and contributed to a stifling defensive effort that limited Blue Valley to two second-half points in a 43-30 victory.\n\nBrown, an Iowa State signee who will compete in the McDonald’s All-American Game on March 28 in Houston, served many roles for Derby as the lone senior on a 22-3 team. She averaged 20.3 points and 10.8 rebounds while playing a variety of positions, including point guard at times.\n\nBut in addition to honing her ball-handling and shooting skills – assets that will help her adjust to a future in the Big 12 Conference – Brown worked to strengthen her leadership ability as well.\n\n“We talked daily,” said Harrison, Derby’s head coach the last two seasons after serving the previous three as an assistant to former Panthers coach Jodi Karsak. “The good thing about Addy is not only does she make teammates around her better through encouragement and leadership, she makes coaches better. She was constantly challenging me. It was, ‘Coach, can we do this? Hey, I’ve been watching film and I saw this player do this. Can we do that?’\n\n“And as for her, she challenged herself. She was like, ‘I have to be better. I have to get my body language right and be more positive toward my teammates.’ Realizing that in herself and knowing that she’d have to change a little bit of that in order to bring out the best in everybody else really helped us.”\n\nBasketball is in Brown’s bloodline. Her parents, Mike and Danika, played at Butler Community College in the early-1990s before Danika continued her career at Michigan State. One of Addy’s older sisters, Kennedy, led Derby to its first and only state girls title in 2018, and now plays at Duke after beginning her collegiate career at Oregon State.\n\nKennedy Brown was the first Kansas girl to be chosen to play in the McDonald’s All-American Game four years ago. A 6-foot-6 post player, her competitive fire is typically guarded by a stoic demeanor.\n\nAs for Addy?\n\n“I probably have the most competitive drive and passion for the game and sometimes that shows,” Brown said. “I’ve tried to work on my body language a little more this year – just not being frustrated and letting my teammates see that. It’s something that brought them down quickly, and at the beginning of the year, I struggled with showing my frustration too much. Really, I was more mad at myself and not them.”\n\nEven with four new regulars in the starting lineup, there was limited turbulence this season for the Panthers. Derby lost its opener 41-32 at Blue Valley Northwest, but quickly recovered against a challenging pre-holiday group of opponents that included Class 4A runner-up McPherson, Andover Central and Maize South.\n\nThe Panthers won nine straight before falling to 5A quarterfinalist Seaman in the semifinals of the Glacier's Edge Invitational in Emporia.\n\nNobody, however, could touch Derby in Ark Valley-Chisholm Trail Division I play, as it finished 12-0. Brown earned her third straight league MVP honor and was joined on the first team by teammate Destiny Smith, whose 26-point effort in a late-season victory at Maize South showed the Panthers had become more than a one-player show.\n\nHarrison noticed strong team chemistry developing through it all.\n\n“Addy was the glue, and we just had very little drama this year,” he said. “It was the most together team I think I’ve ever coached. I had a dad whose girls played at Derby years ago come up to me after a game and say, ‘This is a team I love to watch. It’s a team that plays together and not against each other.’”\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to Washburn Rural in the 2022 state championship game in which Derby was held to 23 points, the Panthers returned to the 6A tournament as the No. 2 seed. They got past Olathe Northwest 43-38 in the quarterfinals, but fell to eventual champion Blue Valley North in the semis despite Brown’s 24 points and nine rebounds.\n\nThe third-place game – and Brown’s career finale – matched the Panthers against Blue Valley at state for the second straight year. In the 2022 tournament, Wooten, a crafty guard who has committed to Oklahoma State, took Derby to the brink in the semifinals with 31 points before the Panthers prevailed 51-49 in double overtime.\n\nWooten and Brown became friendly acquaintances after that classic, and exchanged some mild trash talk in the early stages of their rematch – banter that put the smile on Brown’s face.\n\n“We’ve talked and been friends, and she said I want another chance at Derby,” Brown said. “I was like, ‘I guess you’ve got your chance. Let’s see what you do with it.’ That was kind of ironic to be playing them.”\n\nBrown, who was also named the Kansas Gatorade Player of the Year, has shifted toward preparation for Iowa State, where she will report in June. The Cyclones signed Brown as part of its highest ranked recruiting class (No. 10 by ESPN) after she considered a group of all-Big 12 finalists that included Kansas State, Oklahoma State, TCU and Texas Tech.\n\n“I thought the Big 12 as a whole was the conference that fit me the best as far as style of play,” Brown said. “But looking even deeper into that, Iowa State was the next great fit. I just think the offense they run and the system they run fits me.\n\n“(Iowa State) Coach (Bill) Fennelly has said if you’re versatile, you’re going to thrive here. He told me that many times and I think just watching them play and seeing them 1 through 5, I think I’ll fit in really well there.”"
