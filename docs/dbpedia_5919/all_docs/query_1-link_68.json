        "text": "Medina Spirit has officially been disqualified from the 2021 Kentucky Derby. The colt crossed the line first in May’s race but failed a post-race drugs test. His trainer, Bob Baffert, was banned from entering horses at the Kentucky Derby for two years after the controversy. He denied deliberately doping the horse, which had been a 12-1 outsider to win the race, and blamed the failed test on an ointment used to treat a rash on the horse.\n\nMedina Spirit died in December after suffering a suspected heart attack while working out at California’s Santa Anita track.\n\nOn Monday, the Kentucky Horse Racing Association also fined Baffert $7,500 and handed down a 90-day suspension. Medina Spirit’s owner, Amr Zedan, will not be allowed to collect the $1.8m prize for winning the Derby. Mandaloun, who finished second behind Medina Spirit, is now the official winner of the race.\n\n“We look forward to celebrating Mandaloun on a future date in a way that is fitting of this rare distinction,” Churchill Down, which hosts the Derby, said in a statement on Monday.\n\nBaffert’s attorney, Craig Robertson, told the Daily Racing Form that “we will be filing an immediate appeal” against the sanctions."
