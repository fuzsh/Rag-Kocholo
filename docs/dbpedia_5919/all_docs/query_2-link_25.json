        "text": "The 67-year-old is deputy leader of the Workers Party of Britain, led by George Galloway MP, who won the Rochdale by-election two weeks ago.\n\nMr Williamson is expected to stand in the Derby South seat, currently held by Labour veteran MP Margaret Beckett.\n\nHe said he had been approached by \"numerous people\" asking him to be a candidate.\n\nMr Williamson served two stints as the Labour MP for Derby North, between 2010 and 2015, and from 2017 to 2019.\n\nHe is also a former leader of Derby City Council.\n\nHe resigned from the Labour Party in 2019 following his suspension for comments about its investigation into antisemitism allegations in the party.\n\nAsked if he aimed to return to politics for the Workers Party of Britain, he said: \"That's the plan.\"\n\nThe party's leader, Mr Galloway, won a landslide victory to become the MP for Rochdale after Labour's candidate was disowned by the party for comments about the ongoing situation in Gaza.\n\nThe current leader of Derby City Council, Baggy Shanker, has been selected as Labour candidate for Derby South.\n\nFellow city councillor Jamie Mulhall has been selected as the Conservative candidate for the seat, which has been held by Mrs Beckett for more than 40 years."
