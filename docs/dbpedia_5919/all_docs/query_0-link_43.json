A link to your selected authority's Index page will be emailed to you shortly afterwards.\n\nNot from a government authority? You can still access our report on the Index here.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Index ranks 303 English local authorities by the proportion of total published direct procurement spending with SMEs/VCSEs and local businesses over the calendar year of 2022.\n\nLocal spending is defined as transactions between buyers and suppliers based in the same region (using NUTS 1 classification). SMEs are defined using the European Commission definition. VCSEs are defined as suppliers with either (a) the term 'CIC' in their name, or (b) are classed as a: Registered Charity, Charitable Organisation, Community Interest Company, Guarantee, or Non Profit Organisation.\n\nSome English local authorities are not included in the Index because of late data publishing, or lack of data.\n\nIf you have any further questions about how we compiled the Index, please email contact@tussell.com"
