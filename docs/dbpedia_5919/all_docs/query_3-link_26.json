        "text": "About your Member of Parliament\n\nYour MP (Catherine Atkinson) represents you, and all of the people who live in Derby North, at the UK Parliament in Westminster.\n\nMPs split their time between Parliament and their constituency. In Parliament, they debate and vote on new laws, review existing laws, and question the Government. In the constituency, their focus is on supporting local people and championing local issues. They have a small staff team who help with casework, maintain their diaries, and monitor their inbox.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nFind out more about your MP, including their voting summary, register of interests and recent speeches.\n\nWrite to your MP, or find out about your other local representatives on WriteToThem.com.\n\nFind out more about Derby North on the Local Intelligence Hub.\n\nSupport TheyWorkForYou's work in the new Parliament\n\nTheyWorkForYou is run by mySociety, a small UK charity.\n\nWe're a very efficient operation and do a lot with a small team. At the moment TheyWorkForYou, which is used by millions of people each year, is run with less than the equivalent of one full-time person.\n\nIf we had a bit more money, we could achieve a lot more.\n\nWe want MPs to meet the standards and expectations of the people who elected them - you!\n\nIf you share that goal please donate today to enable greater transparency and accountability of the next government.\n\nLearn more about our current work, and our new project WhoFundsThem - looking into MPs’ and APPGs’ financial interests.\n\nLearn more about how we'll use your donation and other ways to help.\n\nNote for journalists and researchers: The data on this page may be used freely, on condition that TheyWorkForYou.com is cited as the source.\n\nThis data was produced by TheyWorkForYou from a variety of sources.\n\nFor an explanation of the vote descriptions please see our page about voting information on TheyWorkForYou."
