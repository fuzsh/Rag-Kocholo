Here, you can experience cutting edge culture, shopping and entertainment in the heart of a compact city where history combines with a very modern atmosphere. Plus Derby is England’s most central city, so you can benefit from staying in the lively city but have glorious countryside within a 10 minute drive. In fact, 80% of the population is within a 2 hour drive and over six million people within in an hours' drive!\n\nVideos about Derby\n\nThe following videos about Derby are shown by kind permission of Marketing Derby.\n\nDerby Past and Present\n\nDerby became a city in 1977 as part of the Queens Silver Jubilee celebrations, but as a town goes back a long way. It was given its name by the Danes, and eventually became known as Derby which means ‘place of the deer’. Famously Derby is the furthest south Bonnie Prince Charlie travelled in his attempt to overthrow the government in the 1700’s.\n\nHighlights within an hour of Derby include Chatsworth, three National Trust properties, the breathtaking Peak District National Park, stunning landscapes and quaint market towns and villages, e.g. Bakewell and Castleton. In fact Derby is often referred to as the '15 minute city', as its centre is 15 minutes from rural Derbyshire and the Peak District.\n\nDerby has a thriving University and a large FE college with a recently opened new campus at the Roundhouse on Pride Park.\n\nThe city has been at the vanguard of high technology industry since the 1700s, and as the home to many iconic brands is the UK's leading export city.\n\nA friendly and welcoming place, Derby is undergoing a £2 billion transformation, yet is able to complement its history and heritage with all the trappings of a modern dynamic city."
