        "text": "Republican voters in Derby, Conn., have rejected the city’s three-term incumbent mayor in favor of a man who was charged with trespassing during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nGino DiGiovanni Jr., a member of the local board of aldermen, beat Mayor Richard Dziekan in the Republican primary by just 10 votes — 202 to 192. The initial result was confirmed in a recount on Friday afternoon, which was triggered automatically by the slim margin.\n\nThe rise of Mr. DiGiovanni, 42, has astonished leaders in Connecticut, where 59 percent of voters cast their ballots for Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020. Only a handful of Connecticut residents have been charged in connection with the riot.\n\nHis win is also notable for Derby, an old mill city of just over 12,000 people. The presidential race was close: Mr. Biden beat Donald J. Trump in Derby by four points. So was the 2021 race for mayor: Mr. Dziekan beat his Democratic opponent by just 48 votes.\n\n“It’s not like Derby is some town in the Deep South where there’s an overwhelming amount of support for Trump,” said Roy Occhiogrosso, a longtime Democratic operative in Connecticut, adding, “It’s not a hotbed of MAGA activity.”\n\nMayor Dziekan, 57, intends to appear on the November ballot anyway, as a candidate unaffiliated with a political party. He will also face Joe DiMartino, 57, the Democratic nominee; and Sharlene McEvoy, a 73-year-old retired law professor, another nonaffiliated candidate.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
