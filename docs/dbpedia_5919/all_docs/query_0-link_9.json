        "text": "NEW MANIFESTO – LGIU@40:FOR THE FUTURE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT calls for immediate local government reforms and a new covenant between central and local government.\n\nLGIU’s 40th anniversary has come at a critical juncture for local government. Longstanding problems such as pressure on finance and increased demand for services and on infrastructure are butting up against more existential threats to communities like climate change, populism and unregulated, poorly understood technology.\n\nWhile utilising our unrivalled experience of working with local government to drive our LGIU@40 campaign, this work has been very much a programme for the future. Identifying three core themes – finance, participation and trust – we have worked extensively with our members and the wider sector to develop a set of new ideas for how local government could work better in the future. The manifesto we developed through this extensive consultation provides a blueprint of the steps required to create the firm foundations that local government needs to help communities navigate the challenging times we face.\n\nWhile the LGIU began life as an English-based membership organisation, we now support local government across the UK, Ireland and Australia with thousands of staff and local elected representatives using our services every day.\n\nThe LGIU@40 campaign speaks to challenges that communities everywhere have to contend with. From populism and climate change to economic crisis and rapidly evolving technology, solutions and opportunities will be created locally. We need to ensure that we have a thriving local democracy and a sustainable local government sector to meet the future head-on.\n\nRead Jonathan Carr-West’s white paper, introducing the ideas behind this programme of work.\n\nLGIU@40 Collection: Trust\n\nAre we living in an age of post-trust politics? This collection brings together some of LGIU’s work on trust; it looks at why trust is so important to good governance and to public service delivery, examines the consequences of a “trust deficit”, and considers how trust can be rebuilt. Explore the collection.\n\nTrust: the ultimate currency\n\nCllr Lorna Fielker, Deputy Leader at Southampton City Council, explores the value of trust in local government and how it is perhaps undervalued despite being critical to achieving aspirations. Is it time to ask tough questions about the mistrust running through the sector and our communities? Read the article.\n\nUK attitudes the work of councillors and role of local government: Keiran Pedley\n\nWatch the LGIU@40 symposium session with Keiran Pedley, Research Director, Public Affairs, Ipsos.\n\nSolutions for a digital future for local government: Theo Blackwell MBE\n\nWatch the LGIU@40 symposium session with Theo Blackwell MBE, Chief Digital Officer, Mayor of London\n\nThe changing role of the monitoring officer\n\nThis report from the LGIU’s Local Democracy Research Centre looks at the role of the monitoring officer in English local government – hugely important to trust and good governance – and makes recommendations for changes to improve the status and effectiveness of the position. Read the report.\n\nThe core principles of trust applied to local government\n\nDr Hannah Bunting, lecturer in Quantitative British Politics at the University of Exeter, outlines the core principles of trust, applying them to the context of local governance and Dr Greg Stride adds some additional insights from the LGIU’s Local Democracy Research Centre’s recent work. Read the article.\n\nInclusive local economies\n\nWorking the Centre for Local Economic Strategies, the LGIU’s Local Democracy Research Centre has been looking at the potential to create stable local economies that support strong social and environmental outcomes without economic growth. Read the report.\n\nTrust me, I work in local government\n\nChris Elliott, Chief Executive at Warwick District Council reflects on a 40-year career in local government and the importance of reversing the declining levels of trust in councils going forward.
