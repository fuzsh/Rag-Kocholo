        "text": "Section one of preliminary non pro competition at the 6666 National Reining Horse Association (NRHA) Derby presented by Markel wrapped up today at the Oklahoma City Fairgrounds. The event was a display of remarkable horsemanship by a group of skilled riders and their equine partners, all vying for a shot at competing in the non pro finals on Friday, June 21.\n\nLevel 4 Non Pro Leaders – Mandy McCutcheon, Addisyn Schmersal, and Gina Maria-Schumacher\n\nAt the conclusion of the first section of the Non Pro Derby, three powerhouses took the lead in the Level 4.\n\nNRHA $2 Million Rider Mandy McCutcheon rode Dun It For Whiz to the top of the Level 4 and the Colston Paving 4-Year-Old Stakes. The gelding, owned by Mandy and her husband, NRHA $2 Million Owner Tom, already has $140,868 in NRHA lifetime earnings (LTE) with Mandy at the reins. Bred and nominated by Calvin Burger, the mare is by Dun It For Whizkey and out of Indians Gunalena.\n\nAddisyn Schmersal and Enterprizingattitude currently lead the Level 4, the Level 3, the Youth division, and the American Paint Horse Association (APHA) Chrome Cash division. The 5-year-old gelding’s successful career started and stayed within the family. He is owned and bred by Hickory Creek Ranch LLC and nominated by Ginger Schmersal. All of his previous earnings have been with Addisyn’s dad, NRHA $5 Million Rider Craig Schmersal.\n\nNRHA Million Dollar Rider Gina Schumacher and Gunin Addy Tude have already earned $105,407 in the showpen. The 6-year-old stallion was bred and nominated by NRHA Corporate Partner Toyon Ranch and was purchased by the Schumacher-owned XCS Ranch LLC in 2021. Schumacher looks to defend her 2022 Level 4 Non Pro Derby Championship title this year on the stallion by NRHA Hall of Famer Gunnatrashya and out of Miss Lil Addy Tude, a mare owned by nominator Toyon Ranch.\n\nLevel 2 Non Pro Leaders – Kelly Moran and Flinns Smoking Gun\n\nKelly Moran and Flinns Smoking Gun scored a 220 to take the lead of the Level 2. The 5-year-old gelding (NRHA Million Dollar Sire In Like Flinn x Shes All Vogue) has more than $42,000 in NRHA LTE. He was bred and nominated by Neiberger Performance Horses and was purchased by Moran in February. Moran lives in Laguna Hills, California and has $152,000 in NRHA LTE.\n\nLevel 1 Non Pro and Elementa Amateur Derby Leaders – Jenna Meimerstorf and Long Live Diamonds\n\nFrom draw 84, Jennifer Meimerstorf and Long Live Diamonds scored an impressive 218, bounding to the lead in both the Level 1 Non Pro and Elementa Amateur Derbies. Nominated by Amy Medows and owned by Todd and Julie Meimerstorf, Long Live Diamonds is by NRHA $4 Million Sire Walla Walla Whiz and out of Chicsdreamofdiamonds.\n\nPrime Time Non Pro Leaders – Dana Pastorino and Ziggy Rocks\n\nAfter scoring an impressive 220, Dana Pastorino and Pastorino Hay & Ranch Supply Inc.’s Ziggy Rocks took the lead in the Prime Time Non Pro. The 2018 gelding by NRHA $3 Million Sire Whizkey N Diamonds and out of Shes Got Good Guns had nearly $45,000 in NRHA LTE prior to entering the Derby.\n\nMasters Non Pro Leaders – Catherine Crandon and Flinns Dun Twistin\n\nIn 2019, Catherine Crandon nominated her own Flinns Dun Twistin (In Like Flinn x Wimpys Dun Twistin) with NRHA, making her eligible to compete at this event. It paid off after the duo’s 212.5-point performance from draw 88, giving them the lead in the Masters Non Pro Derby.\n\nClark’s Pump-N-Shop Novice Horse Non Pro Derby Leaders – Sarayah Voorhees and Gotta Lotta Magic\n\nSarayah Voorhees and Wild Rose Ranch’s Gotta Lotta Magic rode to a 218 to take the lead in the Clark’s Pump-N-Shop Novice Horse Non Pro Derby. Although it was only the duo’s first show together, the 2018 mare by NRHA Hall of Famer Spooks Gotta Whiz and out of Smoke N Magic performed well for nominator Bobby Lewis with Voorhees at the reins.\n\nWith the first section of non pro preliminary competition completed, excitement mounts for tomorrow’s continuation. The remaining sections will compete for the chance to advance to the prestigious non pro finals. We look forward to witnessing another day of exceptional reining talent on display at the 6666 NRHA Derby presented by Markel.If you are not in Oklahoma City to cheer on the competitors in person, visit nrhaderby.com for access to the free live feed of the event."
