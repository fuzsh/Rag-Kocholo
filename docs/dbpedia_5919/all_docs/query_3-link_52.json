        "text": "The population passed a quarter of a million\n\nBetween the last two censuses (held in 2011 and 2021), the population of Derby increased by 5.1%, from around 248,800 in 2011 to around 261,400 in 2021.\n\nThe population here increased by a smaller percentage than the overall population of the East Midlands (7.7%), and by a smaller percentage than the overall population of England (up 6.6% since the 2011 Census).\n\nIn 2021, Derby was home to around 23.9 people per football pitch-sized piece of land, compared with 22.8 in 2011. This area was the third-most densely populated local authority area across the East Midlands (after Leicester and Nottingham ).\n\nThis article generally uses percentages to enable comparisons over time and between areas. The percentage point change is also used to show the difference between the 2011 and 2021 percentages.\n\nPopulation growth was lower in Derby than across the East Midlands\n\nPercentage population change, Derby and surrounding areas, 2011 Census to Census 2021\n\nEngland ▲6.6% East Midlands ▲7.7% Derby ▲5.1% Source: Office for National Statistics – 2011 Census and Census 2021\n\nSave as image (PNG <200KB) | Download the data (CSV <100KB) |\n\nMedian age in Derby\n\nBetween the last two censuses, the average (median) age of Derby increased by one year, from 36 to 37 years of age.\n\nThis area had a lower average (median) age than the East Midlands as a whole in 2021 (41 years) and a lower average (median) age than England (40 years).\n\nThe median age is the age of the person in the middle of the group, meaning that one half of the group is younger than that person and the other half is older.\n\nThe number of people aged 50 to 64 years rose by around 7,200 (an increase of 18.1%), while the number of residents aged 4 years and under fell by around 2,500 (14.2% decrease).\n\nThe share of residents aged between 50 and 64 years increased by 2.0 percentage points between 2011 and 2021\n\nDerby residents' country of birth\n\nIn the latest census, around 205,700 Derby residents said they were born in England. This represented 78.7% of the local population. The figure has decreased from just under 208,900 in 2011, which at the time represented 84.0% of Derby's population.\n\nPakistan was the next most represented, with just under 8,100 Derby residents reporting this country of birth (3.1%). This figure was up from around 5,900 in 2011, which at the time represented 2.4% of the population of Derby.\n\nThe number of Derby residents born in India rose from around 5,400 in 2011 (2.2% of the local population) to just over 7,100 in 2021 (2.7%).\n\nIn 2021, 78.7% of Derby residents reported their country of birth as England\n\nEthnic groups in Derby\n\nIn 2021, 15.6% of Derby residents identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category, up from 12.5% in 2011. The 3.1 percentage-point change was the largest increase among high-level ethnic groups in this area.\n\nAcross the East Midlands, the percentage of people from the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" ethnic group increased from 6.5% to 8.0%, while across England the percentage increased from 7.8% to 9.6%.\n\nIn 2021, 73.8% of people in Derby identified their ethnic group within the \"White\" category (compared with 80.3% in 2011), while 4.0% identified their ethnic group within the \"Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African\" category (compared with 2.9% the previous decade).\n\nThe percentage of people who identified their ethnic group within the \"Mixed or Multiple\" category increased from 2.9% in 2011 to 3.7% in 2021.\n\nThere are many factors that may be contributing to the changing ethnic composition of England and Wales, such as differing patterns of ageing, fertility, mortality, and migration. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses.\n\nRead the bulletin Ethnic group, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 15.6% of usual residents in Derby identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category\n\nMarriage and civil partnership in Derby\n\nOf Derby residents aged 16 years and over, 42.8% said they were married or in a registered civil partnership in 2021, down from 44.9% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, around 4 in 10 people (40.0%) said they had never been married or in a civil partnership, compared with 36.5% in 2011. The percentage of adults in Derby that had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership decreased from 9.0% to 8.9%.\n\nThis area had the region’s third lowest percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were married (or in a civil partnership). Across the region, only Nottingham (30.8%) and Lincoln (32.1%) had a lower percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were married (or in a civil partnership).\n\nThese figures include same-sex marriages and opposite-sex civil partnerships in 2021, neither of which were legally recognised in England and Wales in 2011. Same-sex marriages have been legally recognised in England and Wales since 2014 and opposite-sex civil partnerships have been recognised since 2019.\n\nThe percentage of adults who were married or in a civil partnership in Derby decreased by 2.1 percentage points\n\nMore people looking after their family or home\n\nDerby saw the East Midlands' third-largest percentage-point rise in the proportion of people who were economically inactive because they were looking after their family or home (from 4.4% in 2011 to 5.7% in 2021).\n\nAcross the region, only Leicester (from 5.8% to 7.8%) and Oadby and Wigston (from 2.8% to 4.2%) saw a greater increase in the percentage of people who were economically inactive because they were looking after their family or home.\n\nEvery local authority area across the East Midlands saw a rise in the percentage of people who were economically inactive because they were looking after their family or home, as the regional percentage grew from 3.6% to 4.3%.\n\nCensus 2021 took place during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a period of rapid and unparalleled change; the national lockdown, associated guidance and furlough measures will have affected the labour market and our ability to measure it.\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were looking after their family or home (economically inactive) in Derby increased by 1.3 percentage points\n\nNational identity in Derby\n\nThe increase in the percentage of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK was greater in Derby (3.8 percentage points) than in nearby South Derbyshire (1.3 percentage points).\n\nIn Derby, the percentage of people who did not identify with at least one UK national identity increased from 8.1% in 2011 to 11.9% in 2021. During the same period, the percentage in nearby South Derbyshire increased from 1.9% to 3.2%.\n\nThe percentage of people who identified with a UK and non-UK national identity in Derby increased from 0.7% to 2.0%, while the percentage of people who identified as \"British only\" increased from 20.0% to 54.7%.\n\nIn Census 2021, “British” was moved to the top response option and this may have influenced how people described their national identity. For further information, please see our quality report.\n\nThe percentage of people who did not identify with at least one UK national identity in Derby increased by 3.8 percentage points\n\nDerby stood out from other areas for working hours\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked 15 hours or less per week fell in Derby, but rose across England.\n\nIn Derby, the percentage that worked 15 hours or less in a week fell from 9.8% in 2011 to 9.4% in 2021, while across England it rose from 9.7% to 10.3%. During the same period, the regional percentage remained at 9.8%.\n\nThe percentage of adults in employment who worked 49 hours or more in Derby fell from 9.9% to 7.8%, while the percentage of adults in employment who worked 31 to 48 hours increased from 59.4% to 62.0%.\n\nWorking hours may have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThe percentage of adults who worked 15 hours or less in Derby decreased by 0.4 percentage points\n\nRise in private renting\n\nIn Derby, the percentage of private renting increased from 16.8% in 2011 to 21.3% in 2021. During the same period, the percentage in nearby South Derbyshire increased from 13.0% to 14.7%.\n\nThe rate of social renting in Derby fell from 19.8% to 18.8%, while the rate of home ownership decreased from 61.4% to 59.0%.\n\nPrivate renting in Derby increased by 4.4 percentage points\n\nUnpaid care in Derby\n\nIn 2021, 4.3% of Derby residents (aged five years and over) reported providing up to 19 hours of unpaid care each week. This figure decreased from 7.3% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nThe decrease in the proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care in Derby (3.0 percentage points) was similar to the decrease across the East Midlands (2.8 percentage points, from 7.4% to 4.6%). Across England, the proportion fell by 2.8 percentage points, from 7.2% to 4.4%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and managed their provision of unpaid care, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care in Derby decreased by 3.0 percentage points\n\nReligion in Derby\n\nIn 2021, 36.6% of Derby residents reported having \"No religion\", up from 27.6% in 2011. The rise of 9.0 percentage points was the largest increase of all broad religious groups in Derby. Because the census question about religious affiliation is voluntary and has varying response rates, caution is needed when comparing figures between different areas or between censuses.\n\nAcross the East Midlands, the percentage of residents who described themselves as having \"No religion\" increased from 27.5% to 40.0%, while across England the percentage increased from 24.8% to 36.7%.\n\nIn 2021, 40.2% of people in Derby described themselves as Christian (down from 52.7%), while 11.1% described themselves as Muslim (up from 7.6% the decade before).\n\nThere are many factors that can cause changes to the religious profile of an area, such as a changing age structure or residents relocating for work or education. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses. Religious affiliation is the religion with which someone connects or identifies, rather than their beliefs or religious practice.\n\nRead the bulletin Religion, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 36.6% of usual residents in Derby reported having \"No religion\"\n\nHealth in Derby\n\nIn 2021, 43.2% of Derby residents described their health as \"very good\", increasing from 41.2% in 2011. Those describing their health as \"good\" fell from 35.8% to 35.5%. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nThe proportion of Derby residents describing their health as \"very bad\" remained 1.5%, while those describing their health as \"bad\" fell from 5.3% to 4.9%.\n\nThese data reflect people’s own opinions in describing their overall health on a five point scale, from very good to very bad.\n\nCensus 2021 was conducted during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and rated their health, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nIn 2021, 1.5% of usual residents said their health was very bad in Derby\n\nFamily in Derby\n\nOf Derby households, 15.6% included a couple but no children in 2021, down from 16.4% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just under one in five households (19.0%) included a couple with dependent children, compared with 19.7% in 2011. The percentage of single family households including a couple living with only non-dependent children increased from 5.6% to 6.1%.\n\nThe decrease in the percentage of households including a couple but no children was greater across the East Midlands (1.3 percentage points, from 19.5% to 18.2%) than in Derby (0.8 percentage points). Across England, the percentage fell by 0.9 percentage points, from 17.6% to 16.8%.\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple without children in Derby decreased by 0.8 percentage points\n\nDisability in Derby\n\nIn 2021, 8.8% of Derby residents were identified as being disabled and limited a lot. This figure decreased from 10.3% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nIn 2021, around one in nine people (11.1%) were identified as being disabled and limited a little, compared with 11.2% in 2011. The proportion of Derby residents who were not disabled increased from 78.5% to 80.1%.\n\nThe decrease in the proportion of residents who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot in Derby (1.5 percentage points) was similar to the decrease across the East Midlands (1.6 percentage points, from 9.3% to 7.7%). Across England, the proportion fell by 1.6 percentage points, from 9.1% to 7.5%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived their health status and activity limitations, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot in Derby decreased by 1.5 percentage points\n\nAbout the data\n\nCensus data are adjusted to reflect estimated non-response so that the published results relate to the entire usually resident population as it was on Census Day (21 March 2021).\n\nThose respondents who were on furlough because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were asked to classify themselves as \"temporarily away from work\" to ensure they remained in the economically active population.\n\nStudents are counted as usually resident at their term-time address even if they were not physically present there on Census Day.\n\nThe questions relating to disability differed slightly between 2011 and 2021 to ensure that data were more closely aligned with the definition of disability in the Equality Act (2010). There was also a change to question wording for unpaid care, for more information read the health, disability and unpaid care quality information.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout the health, disability and unpaid care sections. They allow for fairer comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure. The 2013 European Standard Population is used to standardise proportions.\n\nPercentages and percentage point changes have been individually rounded to one decimal place. This means they may not sum exactly.\n\nTell us what you think about this publication by answering a few questions.\n\nDownload the data used in this article\n\nxlsx (1.5 MB)\n\nAbout these articles\n\nThere is an article like this for every local authority district in England and Wales.
