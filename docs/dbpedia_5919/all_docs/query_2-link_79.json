        "text": "Consultant, Advisor, Writer, Speaker\n\nEsther Derby\n\nMy clients call me when they’re not seeing the results they expect from their organization. They’ve tried new processes, change programs, and new methods. They may have the people and skills that should produce results–but something isn’t clicking, in spite of all their efforts.\n\nHowever, in my experience, the issues they are seeing are symptoms. I work with my clients to identify the visible—and sometimes invisible—factors within the environment that contribute to the problems they see. So they can adjust the environment and their team will function and work more effectively together to solve problems like creating great products and services.\n\nAvailable Now!\n\n7 Rules for Positive, Productive Change\n\nEven if you don’t have change management in your job description, your job involves change.\n\nChange is a given, as modern organizations respond to market and technology advances, make improvements, and evolve new practices to meet new challenges.\n\nThese are not simple changes on the organizational, group, or even team level. Often, there is no indisputable right answer and responding requires trial and error, learning and unlearning. Whatever you choose to do, it will interact with existing policies and structures with unpredictable results.\n\nRather than more rigorous planning, the answer is to shift to an approach that is adaptive, responsive, and engages people in learning, evolving, and owning the new way. 7 Rules for Positive, Productive Change presents a set of heuristics—guides to problem-solving—that help answer the question: “What should I do next?”—clearing the fog to provide a new way forward, in a way that honors people and creates safety for change."
