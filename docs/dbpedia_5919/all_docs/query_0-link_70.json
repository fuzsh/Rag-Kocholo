Our mission is to create a safe and inclusive culture and a comprehensive educational experience that propels students toward their fullest potential so they can positively impact their community. We are known for providing an excellent education, along with a plethora of unique opportunities.\n\nDerby Public Schools has nine elementary schools, two middle schools and one high school. Our award-winning schools are made possible by incredible educators and administrators, parents, support staff and the supportive community. Derby Public Schools passed a $114 million dollar bond in 2018 that enhanced facilities with new construction, intruder locks, storm shelters, Americans with Disabilities Act accessible playgrounds and more.\n\nDerby is an award-winning and supportive community. With a population over 26,000, it is small enough that you feel a part of the community, yet large enough to have all the amenities you could want. Some include a regional water park, hotel, golf course, many restaurants, popular retail stores and unique local shopping options. Recent additions include Warren Riverview Park, a unique waterfront park with canoe and kayak access, Field Station: Dinosaurs, and Rock Regional Hospital located along the growing Rock Road corridor.\n\nDerby has housing options at a variety of price points including apartments, single family housing and retirement communities. Located just south of Wichita, Derby is the second largest city in Sedgwick County and is a great place to call home.\n\nYou do not have to be licensed in the state of Kansas to apply for a position in Derby Public Schools. You do have to be licensed in Kansas to teach for Derby Public Schools. If you are offered a position, KSDE.org can guide you through the steps to transfer your license to Kansas."
