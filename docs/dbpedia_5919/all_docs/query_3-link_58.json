        "text": "Background\n\nSince 2009, Waste Connections has provided Derby residents with curbside recycling every other week. On January 1, 2022, a new five-year contract with Waste Connections began that continues to provide curbside recycling service to all residential customers.\n\nParticipating in Curbside Recycling\n\nResidents who do not currently recycle and would like to start doing so can call Waste Connections at 316-838-4920 to request a recycling cart. Recyclables are collected biweekly on the same day as your trash is picked up. It is important to only place recyclable items in the recycling cart so that these materials can effectively be processed. The guide below outlines items that can be recycled, as well as common items that cannot be recycled.\n\nThe decision to put recyclables out at the curb every other week is a decision to be made by each household. Derby does not mandate recycling. We provide a system that encourages recycling by making it easy and affordable. Approximately 90% of Derby trash customers participate in biweekly curbside recycling. Before this program started in 2009, the rate of recycling in Derby was less than 5%.\n\nNew in 2022\n\nEffective Jan. 1, 2022, Waste Connections will notify customers if trash or non-accepted items are found in their carts. If contamination is found, the customer will receive two warning notices. After that, their cart will be removed and the customer will be billed $25 for the removal. Customers who do not wish to recycle may contact Waste Connections at 316-838-4920 to have their carts removed. Canceling recycling services will not change the service rate charged."
