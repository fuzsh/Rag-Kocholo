        "text": "WFTDA is Overseen by a Volunteer Board of Directors elected annually by WFTDA Member Leagues. Learn more about the current BoD below.\n\nDiFibrillator – President\n\nGolden City Rollers (Johannesburg, South Africa)\n\nPronouns: she/her\n\nDianne “DiFibrillator” Silva hails from Golden City Rollers in Johannesburg, South Africa. She found Roller Derby accidentally when she was asked to be a medic at a home season game back in 2014. For the first three jams, she was like, “this is madness.” At around jam four, she was like, “ok, this is cool.” And halfway through jam five, she was like, “where do I sign up!” And the rest is history. Other than the inclusivity of the sport, the thing that excites Difibrillator the most about Roller Derby is its potential to empower members, regardless of where they find themselves.\n\nDiFibrillator has held many caps within Golden City Rollers during her tenure, from NSO, to HNSO, Charter Team Bench Manager, Coach, Charter Team Skater, Risk Coordinator and Medical Consultant, WFTDA Skater Representative, and Chairwoman of Golden City Rollers. She was an NSO for the 2018 Roller Derby World Cup and was elected the RDNC Global Chair in 2020.\n\nIn her professional life (i.e. the one that pays for her derby life), she is a financial advisor who runs her own insurance brokerage and co-owner of Origin Skates Shop. She has an MBA and various insurance and finance qualifications. She is also a mom to too many animals (prepare for cats joining Zoom meetings), loves cooking and baking, and is a big fan of riding Harley Davidsons.\n\nTarabyte – Vice President\n\nSanta Cruz Roller Derby (California, USA)\n\nPronouns: she/her they/them\n\nTaraByte fell in love with roller derby in the summer of 2009. Never having seen a game before going to a scrimmage and scorekeeping, she didn’t know what a ghost point was and somehow managed to do the job and came back to another scrimmage. It was at that point that she joined the Silicon Valley Roller Girls, working to NSO, and quickly became the HNSO for the league. During her time at SVRG, TaraByte worked with the WFTDA committee, COC committee, and BOD a general board member.\n\nTaraByte realized when joining the WFTDA committee for the league that she wanted to do more with the organization. So she started in HR and helped create a process for evaluating leagues in the organization for participation. TaraByte then started to work with the officiating pillar, Starting by applying for the TOSP chair, then in 2019 Co-Officer of the officiating pillar.\n\nIn officiating she continued in her never ending quest to THNSO Champs, and in 2019 that goal/dream became a reality. Then in 2020 TaraByte made a new goal to join the BOD of WFTDA and that happened quicker than expected. Excited to get going and be a part of this organization.\n\nIron Tyrant – Secretary\n\nGolden City Rollers (Johannesburg, South Africa)\n\nPronouns: she/her\n\nAimée “Iron Tyrant” Plank was first dragged to a Golden City Rollers’ practice in 2011; unbeknownst to her that this sport, and its community, would soon become one of the greatest loves of her life.

Following this, she was elected to the Compliance Panel in 2017 and then joined the Board of Directors in 2021.\n\nBack home, Iron has served in many roles within GCR; including Vice-Chair, Director of the Board, Head of Coaching, and Charter Team Captain.

She previously served as the WFTDA Marketing Officer and Public Relations Committee chair.\n\nAfter skating eight seasons with DCRG, Lois retired from active skating but remains a passionate fan of the sport, and you will still find her with skates on her feet now and then.

In 2008 a new league was formed and she has been with Circle City Roller Derby ever since, as one of the original members.

She has also served on Certification Oversight.\n\nAfter a medical diagnosis, Bambi switched from skating to officiating and served as Tournament Head Ref for WFTDA Championships in Montreal in 2019. Don’t be surprised to see someone go from crutches/walker/wheelchair to skates, that would be her. Becoming physically disabled due to Multiple Sclerosis has not kept her down.\n\nProfessionally, Bambi is a Licensed Paramedic with a ton of specialized initials that go after that because that’s what medical people do. Bambi has worked with special events and sports for over 20 years.\n\nRhodes Warrior – General Board Member\n\nSacramento Roller Derby (California, USA)\n\nPronouns: she/her\n\nRhodes quickly fell in love with roller derby in February 2012 and never looked back after joining a small league in the Sierra Foothills of California as a skater and official. Today, she is the Executive Director of Sacramento Roller Derby while skating for their A charter and coaching their B charter, and is a recognized level official with Sacramento and Bay Area Derby.\n\nHistorically, Rhodes has been on her leagues’ Board of Directors since 2012 with High Country Mountain Derby Girls and then after transferring to Sacred City Derby Girls in 2014. Rhodes was also actively involved in the unification between Sacred and Sac City Rollers to become Sacramento Roller Derby in 2018, and has continued to be nominated into leadership roles. She encourages skater to official crossover, and empowers members to take ownership of their roles within the league to promote pride, growth, and retention.\n\nSacramento associates her with doing all the things: blocker, pivot, jammer, leader, coach, NSO, and referee; and she expresses that each position helps strengthen another. Professionally, Rhodes is a social worker and educator, with her Masters of Science in Forensic\n\nPsychology.\n\nBabe Runner – General Board Member\n\nCape Girardeau Roller Derby (Missouri, USA)\n\nPronouns: she/her\n\nBri “Babe Runner” DeWitt joined roller derby in 2018 after seeing a flier for recruitment.

She loves the role that smaller leagues play within WFTDA.\n\nFor her league, Babe serves a variety of roles: acting as CFO on the CGRD Board, creating the graphics and social media posts, acting as the WFTDA rep., and she’s a member of the league’s training committee.

She quickly learned that roller derby at its very best is never just for any individual. Roller derby is at its very best when the sport and the community are coalesced into a society of like minded folks working together to make this important part of their lives something meaningful and impactful for everyone involved.\n\nAfter holding a multitude of volunteer roles, both in life and roller derby, it made sense for sLoLo to want to try to be a part of effecting change on a larger scale and she is very grateful to have found that path as a member of the WFTDA Board of Directors.\n\nTenacious Dee – General Board Member\n\nRocket City Roller Derby (Alabama, USA)\n\nPronouns: she/her\n\nDominique (Tenacious Dee) has been skating with Rocket City Roller Derby in Huntsville, Alabama since November 2016.
