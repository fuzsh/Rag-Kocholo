        "text": "Delight in a Disney honeymoon destination made even more magical in one of the most romantic cities in the world. With 2 fabulous theme parks—Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park—cavort to your hearts' content!\n\nDisneyland Paris is celebrating its 25th Anniversary and the parks will be spectacularly sparkly. Join in the pageantry with all-new attractions, shows, special menus and much more—including Disney Stars on Parade, Disney Illuminations and Mickey Presents: Happy Anniversary Disneyland Paris. For stellar thrills, do battle with the evil Empire on Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain—an epic takeover of a classic attraction! Relish enchanting dining experiences at larger-than-life Bistrot Chez Rémy featuring French fare—from lil' Remy's perspective. Or canoodle over noodles at Pizzeria Bella Notte and recreate one of the classic romantic moments in Disney's Lady and the Tramp.\n\nFor exemplary service and convenience, stay at one of 7 Disney Hotels—from 5-star luxury lodgings to simple log cabins. Decide to go big? Book a Disney Suite or Castle Club Room and get the VIP treatment, including special access to attractions, in-room amenities and exclusive Club services. You can also treat yourselves to some extra \"magic\" with a private, guided tour, an in-room celebration and more.\n\nGet a rally going on the tennis courts at Disney's Hotel New York—a perfect match for love! Afterwards, head to Celestia Spa inside the nearby Disneyland Hotel—the only Disney accommodations with a full-service spa—for a rejuvenating couple's massage. If golf is your game, play 18 holes on a country club course or get a private lesson for two from a friendly Disney golf pro. When it comes to night life, Disney Village is the spot to dine, dance and shop. This lively colorful district also hosts live concerts, a theater complex, an arcade and so much more—even rides in hot-air balloons!\n\nBeyond The Theme Park\n\nThe \"City of Light\" lies well within reach of Paris Disneyland. Take a break from the parks to commune with nature at an underwater world just a 5-minute drive away or venture further to Big Cats Park where lions, tigers and leopards roam. If fashion is your foray, visit La Vallee® Village—10 minutes from Paris Disneyland—for designer outlet shopping (tax-free for non-EU citizens). Enjoy the sights of Paris on a tour by foot, by bus, even by night. Then again, discover the region and tour its treasure trove of medieval castles and chateaus. There's endless possibilities in a place like Paris!\n\nWhat's Your Dream Disney Honeymoon? Call (321) 939-4610 (Option 2) to book yours today."
