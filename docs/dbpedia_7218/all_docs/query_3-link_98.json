        "text": "Warning: spoilers\n\nHoneymoon is the story of a young couple who gets married and goes on their titular honeymoon. They go to a secluded cabin owned by a distant family member and look forward to spending time fishing, swimming, and just being alone together. The movie plays out like a pretty typical horror film: a loving couple goes to a secluded cabin, things go wrong, and the horror and tension intensify- but there is much more hidden under the simple facade of this movie.\n\nThe couple on their wedding day (picture from IMDB)\n\nBea and Paul seem like the ideal couple. The film opens with a clip from their wedding video where they cheerily retell the story of their relationship. It’s full of cute and quirky details that make them seem real and endearing: they serve Indian food at their wedding because they ate it on their first date and it made Paul incredibly ill, Paul calls Bea “honeybee” and she responds by buzzing, their wedding had a camping theme because they wanted to take a camping trip together but Bea was too sick to go so they went camping at home by setting up a tent in the bedroom. These details are adorable and serve as a repetitive motif throughout the movie.\n\nThe couple goes to their honeymoon at the cabin and everything is beautiful and romantic. Late in the night, Paul wakes up to find Bea missing. He finds her in the woods naked and shaking. She doesn’t know how she got in the woods and doesn’t remember what happens to her.\n\nPaul finds Bea’s torn lingerie (picture from IMDB)\n\nThe next day, Bea begins acting strange. She is distant and seems to be trying to stay positive and cheery. Sometimes, she will overcompensate and do something completely off the cuff in an attempt to make Paul smile, such as jumping into cold water while they are on a boat ride. Paul is just confused by this and annoyed with her not being herself. Bea begins to fumble in other ways: she ruins the french toast she’s trying to make for breakfast by forgetting the simple steps. She can’t make coffee in a french press. Paul becomes more irritated. Later, Bea forgets details of their relationship. She doesn’t buzz when Paul calls her “honeybee”. She doesn’t remember their first date or their failed camping trip. She seems confused by simple things and this serves to ramp up Paul’s irritation. By the end, Bea is caught writing her name, address, and husband’s name over and over in a blank journal. Paul is furious that Bea would need to write down these basic details of her life. The tension of the movie culminates with Paul finding Bea in the bathroom covered in blood as she attempts to remove a writhing creature from her vagina. The body horror ramps up and the movie ends with the reveal that all of this is caused by some type of alien occurrence.\n\nBea fiercely faces body horror (picture from IMDB)\n\nThe first time I saw this movie, I felt for Paul. The woman that he loves is changing before his eyes. Her mind is deteriorating. He doesn’t know how to cope with these changes. On subsequent viewings, I began to see the movie in a different light. When Bea disappears, she is sexually abused. Even if you ignore the alien connotations, what happens to Bea is not her fault. She doesn’t ask for this to happen to her. Bea tries to cope with this. She tries to recover and celebrate her marriage with her husband. She does love him. She needs him to be supportive, and he never is. He is just baffled by her odd behavior, annoyed that she isn’t celebrating with him and that she doesn’t remember how to cook or details from their relationship. When sexual abuse occurs to women, they often freeze and shut down. (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-assault-may-trigger-involuntary-paralysis/)\n\nAfter sexual abuse, women will replay the encounter. Why didn’t they fight back? What did they do wrong? Was it their fault? Is it so unbelievable that Bea won’t be able to perform simple tasks? That she won’t remember details from her life? Can you blame her for trying to tear her body apart to remove the memory of the abuse? As women try to recover from the abuse, their identity shifts, and changes. They may forget who they are, all they are is a rape survivor. They are possessed and haunted. How can Bea explain how she feels to Paul when he is unreceptive to her? He blames her. He is irritated as she struggles with life after abuse. Her attempts to revert to her cheery self cause more anger. She is attempting to cope without support as she relives her attack.\n\nOn the surface, Honeymoon is a simple horror movie with body horror elements, but with a little more inspection the movie is an allegory for surviving sexual abuse. The movie is a cautionary tale to anyone close to a woman who survives abuse."
