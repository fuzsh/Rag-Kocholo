        "text": "It is hard to analyze Bobby as a character by using one theoretical perspective but I am confident that Lenore Walker’s “Cycle of Violence Theory” (Barnett, Miller-Perrin, and Perrin 315) best describes Bobby’s behaviors as a classic batterer. As defined, the theory has three phase’s, the first phase is “Tension Building”, minor incidents of violence, along with the build-up of anger, verbal put-downs, jealousy, threats, and breaking things. This phase could describe the initial escalation by Bobby to start intimidating Fran prior to their marriage. The second phase is the “Battering Phase”, where major violent outbursts occur like Bobby breaking Fran’s collarbone and nose. The last phase is the “Honeymoon Phase” where the perpetrator is remorseful and loving. There were times where this would apply, but Bobby was not consistently loving after he beat Fran, rather he would often attempt to downplay the intensity and effects or even blame Fran for causing the incident while downplaying his violence, and in some cases denying that it took place, as with the initial instance where Bobby explained that he “just came at you a lil”.\n\nIn the article \"Can't Ask, Can't Tell: How institutional Review Boards Keep Sex in the Closet\" by Janice M Irvine, the social scientists are frustrated with the Institutional Review Boards for stymied research about sexuality. The IRBs believe that the topic of sexuality is too sensitive for studies, and it is has been considered to be one of the special cases that do not want to present to the public. For decades, the IRBs' works are heavily influenced by the Belmont's three principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. However, sexuality has become one of the topics that the IRBs would automatically decline because they believe that it is not qualified any of the Belmont's three principles. In 2011, Irvine conducted a survey\n\nIn this chapter, the author says that pretending could help us develop the behavior God desires of us. In other words, by pretending to be a decent human being even if he is not, one begins to develop into that reality. To illustrate his point, Dr. Lewis refers to what happens when we say our prayers. He explains that when we kneel down and say our prayers, we say \"Our Father.\" At this juncture, he says that you assume the role of a Son of God and in a sense, you are pretending since you realize you are not a Son of God. Nonetheless, pretending is not always terrible; it can, occasionally, lead us to worthwhile outcomes. Consequently, when we pretend, we seize an opportunity to practice those virtues, and over time, those virtues may become a reality. Also by pretending, Dr. Lewis says,\n\n“Hell You Talmbout”, a new protest song from Janelle Monáe’s Wondaland collective, is striking in its simplicity. Monáe (along with fellow Wondaland member Jidenna) made headlines yesterday for marching in Philadelphia against police brutality, and this song sounds like an extension of that march. Drums dominate the scene; they are at once tribal but organized, like a powerfully primal marching band. The lyrics are simple as well, but there’s nothing more to say - “Walter Scott - say his name! Jerame Reid - say his name! Philip White - say his name!” Three men who died at the hands of police, all in the last year; all three are widely considered to have been unfairly killed. These are not the only three, either. Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Sean Bell, Freddie Gray, Aiyana Jones, Sandra Bland, Kimani Grey, John Crawford, Michael Brown, Miriam Carey, Sharonda Singleton, Emmett Till, Tommy Yancy, Jordan Baker, and Amadou Diallo make up the rest of the verses. Their deaths range from days gone by, where racism\n\nWhen you associate words like shameless with everyday life you don’t think of it being a television show, one may think of shameless as a negative adjective used to describe a person showing a lack of shame, but it's a comedy/drama television show that really digs deep into real life scenarios and shows how a true dysfunctional family lives in the “hood” of Chicago. Shameless details how much leadership and mental stability Fiona Gallagher has to have in order to run a family of six in her early twenties.\n\nIn the novel, Behind Closed Doors written by B.A. Paris., power is the focal point of the text portrayed by the antagonist, Jack Angel, whom uses power to manipulate the protagonist, Grace. Paris uses Jack to shine a light on a societal issue dealt with on a daily basis. Paris is able to illustrate patriarchy through the power demonstrated by Jack and the position that he has on Grace which makes him the one always a few steps ahead of her. Power is illustrated through the language and dialogue between the characters as well as word choice. The author’s purpose of the work as a whole focuses on Paris’ concern about a social issue on male authority and inequality or feminism and patriarchy. Paris presents these beliefs she uses to convey the ultimate or the overall meaning of the text through the main characters as well as through tone, voice and the author’s writing style.\n\nThis film (1996) was very similar to Violet and Bradley story. For instance, Violet had not had much luck with men before she met Bradley, which was one of the reasons she felt so in love with him. That is very similar to the way Stacy thought about Bobby. Stacy often mentioned that Bobby made her feel special and that nobody had ever made her feel special before him. She too did not have much luck with guys before Bobby. Also, Stacy and Violet both had trouble recognizing their abuse. Even though Stacy's abuse involved physical interaction and Violets did not, they still had to have support and help from the outside before recognizing the signs. Stacy's friends are who helped her while Violet sought help from a therapist and group therapy. They also experienced a lot of the same symptoms from abuse such as confusion, exhaustion, and suffocation which is referred to as the battered women syndrome. Something else they have in common is that they often blamed their selves for what was happening in their relationship, which is a good example of the looking glass self-theory. Since they were so isolated from everyone else, especially Violet, they only went by the judgments made by their significant other. Those judgments were often saying they were always doing something wrong or that they weren’t good enough at something. Contrariwise, Bobby and Bradley had a lot in"
