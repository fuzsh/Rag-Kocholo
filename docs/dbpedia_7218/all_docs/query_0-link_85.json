        "text": "This post contains spoilers for Fifty Shades Freed.\n\nFifty Shades Freed the movie is great fun, regardless of how familiar you are with the book. Either way, the drill is familiar by now: it's an impossible task to fit every single detail and timeline into a film adaptation, otherwise, you’d be in the theater watching Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan for 12 hours without a pee break to spare. (For more on this subject, please see entry two.) Sure, that might sound like an adventure you’d like to go on, but Freed, directed by James Foley (who also did Darker) is the next best thing. The third film clocks in at a tight 105 minutes and, despite cutting out some major characters with say, a medical background, Freed serves as a nice cherry on top of the sundae a pint of Ben & Jerry’s vanilla ice cream that is the Fifty Shades movie franchise. Below, 25 major items the film left out. I’ll miss you forever, Dr. Flynn.\n\n1. Mia catches Ana’s wedding bouquet by way of brother Elliot. In the book, Ana’s bouquet is tossed into a sea of young women, but Mia comes out on top and “triumphantly holds it aloft, grinning from ear to ear.” In the movie, Elliot is the first to catch the bouquet (by accident, likely); he nonchalantly hands it to Mia, who is just as excited as ever to have it.\n\n2. Christian doesn’t order Ana to have a full bladder before they have boat sex during their honeymoon. They do, however, have sex while Ana’s wrists are handcuffed to her ankles, just like the book. But back to the not peeing thing: in the book, he makes Ana gulp down her gin and tonic and warns, “I’m going to make an example of you.” He later explains, “The fuller your bladder, the more intense your orgasm.” Who else is solely craving a gin and tonic right now and nothing else? Anyone?\n\n\"Wheeee!\" - Ana and Christian, probably.\n\n3. She doesn’t go on the jet ski on her own and “defy” him. Honestly, the movie versions of Ana and Christian have enough on their plate, and we do get a nice shot of the newlyweds going from beach to yacht via jet ski.\n\n4. Ana does not buy Christian a fancy camera on their honeymoon. Too bad, I was really looking forward to that phone call to José, who sure knows a lot about cameras!\n\n5. The Grey security team is slightly shuffled for the movie. For starters, Barney does not exist in Freed (he’s not in Darker, either). In the scene where Ana and Christian are reviewing security footage of the Grey Enterprise Holdings Inc. server room fire started by Hyde, the movie has this conversation taking place on the yacht during their honeymoon, not at home at Escala. They’re also speaking to Ros, not Barney. P.S. Ryan (see entry 13) also does not exist in the movie.\n\n6. There’s no discussion of a pre-nup in the movie. There’s no post-honeymoon Grey family brunch, where this discussion takes place in the book, either.\n\n7. Movie Ana doesn’t shave her pubic hair. In the book, Christian has a reaction to this discovery, and eventually finishes the job for her. On the topic of body hair, though, movie Ana is oddly obsessed with commenting on her husband’s facial hair. In her office, she reminds him to shave his face. And at home (just like the book), she gives him a haircut.\n\n8. “That GQ profile on you? I love what you’re doing in Africa.” Gia Matteo, the architect and part time jewelry expert who used to date Elliot, says this to Christian as she shows him and Ana the house they’re about to renovate. What is this profile you speak of, Gia. And what has Christian been doing in Africa? While this ridiculous line is on par with the other memorable one-liners from the book, E.L. James most certainly did not write this in Freed.\n\n9. The car chase happens after they visit their future home in the movie. In the book, it’s after brunch with Christian’s parents. But in both versions, he surprises Ana by letting her drive his Audi.\n\n10. They don’t have sex when she gives him a haircut in the bathroom. Ana says in the book, “To hell with the haircut – I’ll do it later,” and she does, only after they have hot bathroom tile sex (ie. “seven shades of Sunday”). In the movie, while sex may have been implied – it’s Christian and Ana after all – it doesn’t happen on screen.\n\n11. Mrs. Jones and Taylor are not a thing in the movie. Next to Christian and Ana, these two were unstoppable in the book.\n\n12. The X-Files are nowhere to be seen. Christian and Ana go from zero to 60 (in her words, “we completely bypassed third base”) while watching an old episode of The X-Files in Chapter Seven. This does not happen in the movie. What, did you guys not get the rights to one of the best shows in the history of television? Not even a few precious seconds of the theme song?\n\n13. Jack actually sneaks up from behind and grabs Ana when he breaks into Escala. In the book, he’s already been apprehended by Ryan by the time Ana gets back to the apartment after a night of drinking with Kate. In the movie, it’s Prescott who takes Jack down. Hot Sawyer also chips in. These two obviously need to start in a bodyguard drama ASAP.\n\n14. José goes to Aspen with everyone. Meanwhile, poor Ethan (Kate’s brother, who falls for Mia in the books), continues to not exist.\n\n15. Christian sings “Maybe I’m Amazed” in the movie, not “Wherever You Will Go.” And this #blessed moment happens in Aspen, not at his parents’ house during their post-honeymoon brunch.\n\n16. Ana has a dream about Jack. This doesn’t happen in the book. Give me Christian’s dreams! (Like the one where he sees her dead.) Leave Ana alone!\n\n17. They actually have good weather in the movie and go hiking in Aspen. In the book, the group gets rained out, giving way to Mia’s brilliant idea of “Girls, shopping – boys, outdoor boring stuff.” This translates to Christian going fishing. In the movie, they all go hiking without Christian, who mysteriously stays behind and chats with Taylor about files he just got on Jack.\n\n18. Elliot proposes to Kate in a club. Not the fancy restaurant described in the book. A. CLUB.\n\nGets proposed to in a club.\n\n19. Ana doesn’t dance with the wrong person at said club, leading Christian to punch him. But this moment, which exists in the book, was shown in an early trailer, so maybe it will make the extended edition of the DVD?\n\n20. Ray's hospitalization does not happen. In the book, Ana's dad lands in the hospital in Portland after getting hit by a drunk driver. Come to think of it, was Ray even at the wedding in the movie?\n\n21. Jack goes to court! And Ana appears in court while wearing the worst disguise of all time. And they make eye contact as he passes her while wearing an orange jumper. This is most definitely not in the book.\n\n22. Leila and Susi, Christian's other former sub, don't visit Ana at her office. This happens in the book, Christian goes berserk, and Prescott gets in trouble. The film skips it entirely, which is too bad. Bella Heathcote was an excellent Leila in Darker.\n\n23. Ana’s birthday Audi, an R8, does not exist. In fact, they don’t even celebrate her 22nd (!) birthday in the movie, so you can forget about those moving scenes between Ana and her mom at her birthday dinner in Portland.\n\n24. Hyde’s note in the movie says, “You owe me a life.” In the book, Christian says it’s something to the tune of, “Do you know who I am, because I know who you are, Baby Bird,” referring to the name their foster mom used to call Christian. They’re both poorly-constructed notes, but I guess “You owe me a life” gets his point across faster.\n\n25. Ana tells Christian she’s found his birth mother’s grave and they actually visit it. It’s a tender moment leading up to the glorious montage of Fifty Shades movie flashbacks (yes, Christian’s pommel horse performance made the cut). There’s no mention of Christian’s birth mother’s grave site in the book.\n\n26. Paging Dr. Flynn, who is also missing from this movie. Hugh Dancy’s casting as Christian’s psychiatrist remains one of the greatest mysteries of the Fifty Shades movie franchise.\n\nThis post has been updated."
