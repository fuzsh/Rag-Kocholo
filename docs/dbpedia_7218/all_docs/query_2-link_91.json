        "text": "First of all I want to thank Rhonda Byrne for changing my life with The Secret! My life would not have been the same without this knowledge!\n\nI hope by sharing my story I will inspire many others to manifest all of their dreams no matter how big they are!\n\nI fell madly in love with a great guy! But we were having a lot of obstacles in our relationship, mainly because it was a long distance relationship. We lived on different continents!! I live in Europe and he lives in Asia. We fell in love when I was doing an internship in his country for 5 months. After that, I returned to his country twice for a few weeks to be able to see each other. It was quite hard for him to visit me as he had his own business to maintain and he came from a very traditional country where relationships have to be secret until they turn into marriage.\n\nOn my last visit to him we talked about a possible marriage and I had decided that I could never settle down in his country. Itâs just too different for me. He confided to me that he would never be able to leave his family and thus his country to settle with me. Our relationship kind of got stranded there.\n\nI was so depressed and feeling so low for a few weeks, but then I suddenly remembered the LOA. I had read all 3 books and seen the movie many times before but I had never tried it long enough for results to show. So this time I decided to really go through with it as I didn’t have anything to loose. I watched the movie again and again until the message really sank into my mind.\n\nI thought if my boyfriend would just come and see my country just once, maybe he would change his mind and feel it would be worth settling here. So I started believing that he had already told me he would come here to visit me. And I started doing all these extra things: I put an extra bed in my room where he would sleep when he would come. I started buying all the special drinks and special sweets of my country that I wanted him to taste when he was here. I started cleaning my room as if he was coming very soon. I started to buy new clothes which I would wear when I picked him up at the airport and I also made a vision board with pictures of us two and of all the other countries we would visit together when he was here in Europe. I wished to do a Euro-trip with him.\n\nThen after some time, he suddenly told me he was considering visiting me because he was just missing me so much. I noticed the LOA was working so I just kept on doing the same things. I believed with my strong faith that it was already decided that he would come, and I would tell most of my friends he was coming and I would really feel the joy of knowing he was going to come soon. I also made a list of all places I wanted to visit with him and I really imagined being there with him already. I imagined him meeting my parents here, my friends, my sister, my home. At night when I went to bed, I imagined he was sleeping in the bed next to me.\n\nAnd guess what!\n\nIt really worked!\n\nHe did decide to come! Everything just fell into place immediately. For example when he told me he would come, suddenly I wished I would find a job immediately so that I could save up money until the time he would come, but then again it had to be a job that could give me holidays once my boyfriend was here. I just wished for this kind of job.\n\nAnd guess what?\n\nI suddenly got an offer for a well-paid temporary job for exactly 2 months, which was the exact time left until my boyfriend would come here and the job required someone with my skills! It was just meant to be!\n\nAnd so he did come here and I was so ecstatic! But before coming he had told me, he was dealing with some money issues and he could come visit me, but we would probably not be able to do the Euro-trip we had planned. Well, when he came, we went to inquire with the travel agent about possible countries we could visit, and we found out that the prices were a lot better than expected! And we eventually did do our Euro-trip and it was the most amazing holiday ever, together with him!\n\nAfter he left, I got my vision board back out of my cupboard. I had hidden it in my cupboard so that he wouldn’t see it when he was here, and suddenly I was so shocked!\n\nWe had visited all the countries in Europe that I had put on my vision board! All the images on my vision board were exactly the same as our holiday pictures! We had visited exactly those places and I hadn’t even realized this when booking the trips! I had also put one picture of a night club there, and we had in fact, gone to a night club one evening together. I was just amazed!\n\nWell, when he went back, he told me he wished to settle here with me!!! After one year he would have wound up his business and he would move here to settle with me! I was so happy!\n\nHe had also told me he would be able to come visit me again after 4 months. This was OK, but it still seemed so far for me, so again, I decided to apply The Secret! I made new vision boards and practiced gratitude daily with The Magic. I really, truly believed he was coming soon.\n\nSuddenly he told me he was able to come 2 months earlier than expected!\n\nSo now itâs just two weeks until he comes here, and I am trying to manifest that he will stay here forever at once!! I know I can!\n\nIâm so overjoyed! Not only does The Secret make your dreams come true, but this knowledge has even helped me to be in a good mood all the time! Now that Iâm practicing gratitude I am always in a great mood! And who doesn’t want to be in a great mood all the time?! Whenever I felt my mood sinking or met with a setback and felt low, I would just ask myself why I am I sad if the Universe is bringing me what I want very soon? And then I would just cheer up!\n\nIf I can do it, so can you! My biggest advice is donât give up, and to find that thing that works for you! Find the thing that generates the feelings of “having it now” for you! The way I would make vision boards and put them somewhere I could see them every day. The way I imagined sleeping next to my boyfriend every night, the lists I made of the places we could visit, find the thing that helps you the most and donât give up!"
