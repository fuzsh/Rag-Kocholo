        "text": "Surrounded by ancient Caledonian pine forests and soaring mountains, escape to the beautiful cedar lodges at Eagle Brae. Sit on the deck of your cabin, a glass of wine in hand and keep an eye out for wildlife. You'll see wandering red deer, Eagle Brae's own goats, and wheeling birds of prey, to name a few. Loch Ness and Glen Affric are nearby too, if you can drag yourself away from your cabin.\n\nWith uninterrupted views across Loch Torridon to Beinn Eighe and Lialath, two of Scotland's most dramatic mountains, you can't get a much more spectacular honeymoon cottage in Scotland than the Boat House at The Torridon. The cottage is self-catering, but the hotel's restaurant, 1887, is right next door, and you have access to the hotel's range of on-site adventure activities too.\n\nAbove the arty-cool city of Dundee is The Hideaway Experience, featuring four luxury honeymoon cabins with hot tubs. More like miniature boutique hotels than log cabins, the hideaway is complete with a spa bathroom and a wood burning stove in the bedroom - all the lavish luxuries you need for a romantic honeymoon in Scotland.\n\nOn the far north coast of Scotland is Croft 103; two eco-cottages built into the hillside. Hill Cottage and Shore Cottage have floor to ceiling windows, luxury décor, and outdoor roll-top bathtubs - perfect for stargazing.\n\nHidden in the woods in the Cairngorms is The Lazy Duck, a collection of off-grid cabins. The Woodsman's Hut offers seclusion with only red squirrels (and a few lazy ducks!) for company. The best bit? Lazy Duck's wood-fired hot tub is out in the woods - so light the candles, grab a glass of fizz and relax among the trees.\n\nOn north-west Skye, with views to Harris and the Outer Hebrides, is Mint Croft, two luxury traditional Hebridean Blackhouses with turf roofs and one metre thick walls. The croft might be remote, but just 5 miles away is Loch Bay (temporarily closed), the Isle of Skye's Michelin-starred restaurant, as well as the oldest pub on Skye, the Stein Inn.\n\nAccessed only by a 17km walk or by boat from Mallaig, The Knoydart Hide is a gorgeous honeymoon cottage hidden away in the forest with its own sauna and outdoor hot tub with incredible views. Nearby is The Old Forge, mainland Britain's most remote pub and seafood restaurant - so you won't go hungry!\n\nEver thought of spending your honeymoon in a treehouse? Brockloch is an unusual gem hidden away near Dumfries, sitting in a bluebell-filled wood surrounded by trees. There might be no TV or wifi but outside your door is the gorgeous rolling hills of south-west Scotland. Why not visit the town of Kirkcudbright, Scotland's book town at Wigtown, or have a romantic stroll in the Galloway Forest Park?\n\nLooking for truly unique honeymoon accommodation? The Uist Forest Retreat offers three round houses perched high above the trees on the island of North Uist in the Outer Hebrides. Spot sea eagles and little owls from the floor-to-ceiling windows whilst lazing in your roll top bath.\n\nEnjoy a taste of luxury at the 5-star Ness Walk Hotel in Inverness. Awarded ‘Best for Romance’ at the Conde Nast Johansens Awards for Excellence 2024, the judges were swooned over with the hotel’s tranquil lounges, peaceful and spacious rooms and intimate dining experience in the hotel’s restaurant, Torrish. Expect a memorable dining experience with each dish on the menu celebrating the finest seasonal ingredients from local artisan producers and farmers."
