        "text": "Feel-good movies are criminally underrated. Sure, we love a hard-hitting blockbuster as much as the next person, but—after a difficult few years—it's no surprise we're craving as much lighthearted entertainment and feel-good films as possible. So, to relieve any anxiety you may be feeling right now—or if you’re simply looking for a pick-me-up—we've rounded up the best flicks that will give you a much-needed mood boost.\n\nSure, you could go for a run and get those endorphins flowing. Or you could instead grab your favourite person, your comfiest loungewear, a glass of wine and/or some delicious snacks, and stick on a bloody good film.\n\nNone of these films will make you cry, and they possibly won’t exercise your brain cells, but doesn’t our mind need a much-needed break RN? We're not here to judge how anyone spends their free time.\n\nSo, we have delved into the vaults of Netflix, NOW TV, Amazon Prime, Disney+, the lot… and found some seriously feel-good movies, from those pom-pom dazzling cheerleading routines in Bring It On to the hilariously cutthroat world of fashion in The Devil Wears Prada. Also, how about The Terminal starring Tom Hanks (because doesn't Tom Hanks make everything better?) to Will Ferrell's LOL-worthy hit Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, also starring Rachel McAdams. Or how about guaranteed laughs with Tiffany Haddish and Regina Hall in Girls Trip?\n\nWe even included the classics, like the very first Harry Potter movie, which has single-handedly united generations, created a colossal following, and disrupted the world of fantasy and storytelling. After all these years, no matter what age you are, it’s still a good watch!\n\nSo, if you are looking for an easygoing flick—something to make you laugh, inspire you or generally restore your faith in humanity here are the feel-good movies for you…\n\nThis story first appeared on glamourmagazine.co.uk"
