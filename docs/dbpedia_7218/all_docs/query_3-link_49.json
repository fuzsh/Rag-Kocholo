        "text": "Where to go on honeymoon in February 2025\n\nFebruary is a smart time to travel with relatively low prices. The best long-haul honeymoon destinations include the Caribbean and Mauritius, but you can also find good weather in the Canary Islands and Madeira and in Morocco, Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\n\nSpeak with a specialist tour operator before booking your honeymoon. Follow the links below for details and prices.\n\nQuick links\n\nCaribbean – Indian Ocean – Short haul sunshine – The Americas – Africa – Asia – Australia – Other short haul\n\nCaribbean Honeymoons in February 2025\n\nIt’s peak season in the Caribbean in February with perfect temperatures (around 28°C), an average nine hours of daily sunshine and cooling sea breezes.\n\nIf you’re looking for some glitz and plenty of activities on site, head to one of the couples-only all-inclusive Sandals Resorts. They boast superb locations and they are specialists in creating romantic honeymoon experiences.\n\nIf you love deserted beaches and fine dining, head to the unspoilt coral island of Anguilla which is a wonderful place to kick back, swim and sunbathe. Stay at Cap Juluca, or the Four Seasons (I love their rooftop suites with private pools) or Aurora Resort.\n\nSt Lucia is always a good choice for honeymooners but especially so in February with good underwater visibility for snorkelling and diving. I recommend the glorious Anse Chastanet which is set on one of the island’s best beaches.\n\nStruggling to pick a Caribbean island? Then a Caribbean cruise is the solution, especially aboard one of the romantic tall ships from Star Clippers. You could choose a cruise around the evocatively named Treasure Islands, including St Kitts, St Barts, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands.\n\nEurope, Africa and Middle East Sunshine\n\nThere are plenty of February getaways that are around fours hours’ flying time from the UK to take you to the sun, though you shouldn’t expect scorching temperatures.\n\nMadeira (18ºC, 6 hours of sun) is a wonderful island for honeymooners with its romantic quintas (restored country houses) and dramatic mountain scenery. If you enjoy walking, trekking and even abseiling, Madeira is a great destination.\n\nIt’s only a four-hour flight to Tenerife (18ºC, 7 hours of sun) with departures from regional airports across the UK. Spend the money you save on flights on a fabulous hotel such as the Gran Hotel Bahia del Duque or The Ritz-Carlton Abama. The island is packed with things to do including whale and dolphin watching.\n\nIt’s five hours flying time to Egypt. Begin with a tour of the Pyramids in Cairo (23ºC and 8 hours of sun) followed by a relaxing Nile cruise. Or relax in the sunshine on either Sharm el-Sheikh or Hurghada on the Red Sea. Check out these honeymoon ideas in Egypt.\n\nFebruary is a good month to visit Dubai – you’ll find guaranteed fine weather (26ºC and 8 hours of sun) and it’s only a six-hour flight from the UK with a choice of regional departures. Indulge at The Ritz Carlton Dubai, one of the emirate’s most sophisticated hotels, or at the Anantara The Palm Resort & Spa which has a kilometre-long sandy beach, lagoon pools and a superb spa.\n\nMorocco has an impressive choice of beautiful hotels for honeymooners from converted riads in Marrakech to glamorous desert camps, although expect chilly evenings in the Sahara this month – and not forgetting Sir Richard Branson’s sumptuous Kasbah Tamadot. See a full range of honeymoons in Morocco.\n\nFly a little further and you reach, Sal and Boa Vista in the Cape Verde islands. The five-star Hilton Cabo Verde Sal Resort is the island’s most luxurious place to stay while Spinguera Eco Lodge has just 12 cottage-style rooms.\n\nIndian Ocean\n\nThe Maldives remain one of the world’s most desirable honeymoon destinations. The Indian Ocean islands are a good bet in February (32ºC and 10 hours of daily sun) and there are fabulous resorts to choose from such as the ultra-romantic Huvafen Fushi with its underwater spa.\n\nFor all-out luxury, take a look at NIYAMA Maldives which has 87 studios and pavilions – most with private pool – spread out across two secluded islands, along with an underwater nightclub and a chance to spend a night at sea with a butler and private chef in a beautifully-restored Maldivian sail boat.\n\nIt’s only a 90-minute flight from the Maldives to Sri Lanka: this twin-centre honeymoon is one of the most popular ways to combine the two destinations.\n\nYou could also get some great deals when you combine Dubai and the Maldives or Dubai and Mauritius.\n\nAfrica in February\n\nDo you dream of safari? Kenya avoids the worst of the heavy rains falling on Africa this month – you’ll see newborn animals and a good chance of big cats hunting, along with luxurious camps like Mahali Mzuri and the elegant Cottar’s 1920s camp with its vintage game drive vehicles.\n\nIf you fancy safari and beach, combine it with nearby Zanzibar on a Kenya & Zanzibar Honeymoon, while Tanzania and Zanzibar is another safari and beach combination to consider; the tempting white sands at Zuri Zanzibar are hard to beat.\n\nYou can ramp up the excitement further on this Crater, Migration and Beach Adventure Honeymoon in the Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Crater and Zanzibar with guided bush walks and hot air balloon safaris.\n\nFurther south, South Africa is another great bet for February, particularly at the Cape and along the Garden Route. Choose this Luxury Cape and Coast honeymoon or team Cape Town with the Winelands on a Ultimate Cape Town, Winelands and Kruger escape.\n\nGorgeous Mont Rochelle is in Franschoek in the heart of the Winelands. You can also get married at this luxury boutique hotel or combine it with an equally indulgent safari on a Winelands and Wildlife honeymoon, staying at Ulusaba.\n\nBotswana is home to Africa’s most romantic camps and it’s the “green season” so, although there’s a risk of rain showers, you can expect fewer tourists, lower prices, brilliant colours and plenty of newborn animals. You’ll want to combine the Okavango Delta with Chobe National Park.\n\nThe Americas\n\nGet behind the wheel for a luxury road trip across America. How about a self-drive tour of Las Vegas and Southern California including a stay in Palm Springs?\n\nIt’s summer in South America. Head to Brazil where you can see the sights of Rio de Janeiro (31ºC, 7 hours of sun), take a cruise on an Amazonian riverboat, then kick back in trendy Trancoso on the Bahia coast. If you time it right, you can experience the Rio Carnival in February.\n\nArgentina is one of this year’s hottest honeymoon destinations and great value for money once you’re there. There’s the party capital of Buenos Aires (29ºC, 9 hours of sun) and the incredible vistas of Patagonia, not to mention cutting-edge hotels.\n\nFor both Brazil and Argentina, we recommend Dehouche, a company based in Brazil but run by British expats who can tailor-make an incredible itinerary to suit your personal requirements. See their guide to honeymoons in South America.\n\nFor lovers of nature and adventure, it’s hard to beat Costa Rica (32ºC, 8 hours of sun), a delicious combination of rainforest, volcanoes, surf beaches and amazing wildlife. Try this two-week Costa Rica in Style trip. If you want to keep costs down, try this 12-day Costa Rica Highlights private tour.\n\nHoneymoon Destinations in Asia\n\nFebruary is the driest month of the year in Vietnam, making it a favourite destination for adventurous couples. This two-week private honeymoon, Vietnam in Style, features Hanoi, a cruise in Halong Bay, Hoi An, the buzzing city of Saigon (33ºC, 7 hours of sun) and the superb beaches of Con Dao.\n\nIf you’ve already been to Vietnam and got the T-shirt, how about the lesser-visited Philippines – an archipelago of almost absurdly beautiful islands and beaches and natural wonders.\n\nIf India has always been on your radar, February is a great time for a honeymoon. It’s the start of the summer season but temperatures are still pleasant. Check out these honeymoons in Goa (28ºC, 10 hours of sun).\n\nAnd in nearby Sri Lanka it’s the best time of year for blue whale watching. Whet your appetite by taking a look at these stunning lesser-known hotels: Ulagalla Resort and Chena Huts. This Slow Paced Luxury honeymoon features a mix of beaches, tea plantations, wildlife reserves and cultural immersion. Expect 32ºC and 9 hours of sun in the capital Colombo.\n\nAustralia and the South Pacific\n\nGoing all the way? How about Australia where you’ll find some amazing places to stay including Southern Ocean Lodge on Kangaroo Island, and Longitude 131º overlooking Uluru.\n\nSee more of the sights Down Under from the windows of a train as part of a two-week itinerary travelling from Adelaide to Darwin’s beaches, through the Outback, the Barossa Valley vineyards and Uluru, including a trip on board The Ghan.\n\nHow about wearing flowers in your hair in an idyllic South Pacific paradise – Tahiti and The Cook Islands are among the most perfect beach destinations on the planet. When I first visited, I was completely blown away and felt like I’d landed on a magical film set. Some of the most popular places to stay for honeymooners include Te Manava Luxury Villas and Le Taha’a. Take a look!\n\nOther European Honeymoon Ideas\n\nThe great cities of Europe might not be hot in February, but you can get fantastic deals on hotels. Head to the Spanish cities of Andalucía including Seville, Cordoba and Granada, where you’ll find warm weather and no crowds. See more ideas in Andalucia.\n\nParis is romantic at any time of year. Travel by First Class Eurostar, stay in a luxury boutique hotel such as the four-star Pavillon de la Reine or the charming Relais Christine on the Left Bank, and enjoy the city free of tourists.\n\nItaly never fails to charm. You could line up a mini tour of Venice, Florence and Rome or enjoy Venice at its most atmospheric. February is Carnival in Venice, so make sure if you want to go at this time that you book well in advance (22 February to 4 March in 2025).\n\nThe best Venice hotels for honeymooners include the four-star Hotel Londra Palace near the Bridge of Sighs and The Danieli, a former palazzo dating back to the 14th Century. Make your arrival even more memorable by travelling on the Orient-Express.\n\nAnother option is to head north. Check out these Arctic honeymoons with The Aurora Zone, which specialises in bespoke travel to Finland, Sweden and Norway. You could stay in a glass igloo gazing up at the Northern Lights, or hide away in a cosy remote log cabin. Or go husky sledding and ice fishing on this unique adventure honeymoon.\n\nYou could explore the snowy wilderness of Iceland with its cosy bars, stylish boutique hotels and breathtaking landscapes. I recommend staying at the lovely Hotel Ranga on the banks of a salmon river overlooked by glaciers and mountains. After dark, you can sit out in geothermal hot tubs, watching the light show overhead.\n\n> Visit our sister site 101 Holidays to find where’s hot in February and where’s hot in Europe along with more expert recommendations for February.\n\nTry another month…\n\nJanuary, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December\n\nLast updated: 26 January 2024\n\nGet holiday deals sent to your inbox"
