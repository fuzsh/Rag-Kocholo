        "text": "DUBAI: Elie El-Semaan says being a director is physically exhausting, but that’s what fuels his love for filmmaking. The Lebanese director gained international acclaim with his breakout work, the TV show “Shatti Ya Beirut” (Rain Over Beirut), which won him a Murex D’or (the annual Lebanese awards for achievements in the arts) for Best Drama Director in 2022.\n\nNow, El-Semaan is ready to bring his expertise to the silver screen with his feature-film debut, “Honeymoonish”, a romantic comedy that will come to Netflix later this year.\n\nThe project, as the first Kuwaiti film to be shot in Lebanon, comes with a nuanced take on the Arab world and the cultures that make it unique.\n\n“I think the film will change the perception of Arabs,” El-Semaan says to Arab News. “Once people watch it, they’ll understand what I mean.”\n\nThe film, written by Egyptian author and director Eiad Saleh, stars Kuwaiti-born Egyptian actress Nour Al-Ghandour as Noor and Kuwaiti actor Mahmoud Boushahri as Hamad. In it, the couple navigate a web of misunderstandings and unexpected truths to discover love and the possibility of redemption, inviting viewers on an emotionally resonant journey.\n\nThough the pressure of making his debut feature for a powerhouse like Netflix may have been daunting, El-Semaan says that the raising of the bar for pan-Arab television in recent years had given him confidence.\n\n“I think series are now being treated as films,” he says. “The quality of our series is up to the level where each episode is like a film. In terms of quality, in terms of responsibility, in terms of everything, it was quite similar. You cannot give (audiences) what they used to watch in the past because the world has so much to offer.\n\n“The main difference between series and film is the amount of time you have — in a series you have, let’s say, three days to shoot an episode,” El-Semaan continues. “Whereas for a 90-minute film, you have 30 to 40 days to shoot.”\n\nWith this added time came the opportunity to refine and understand the cultural subtleties of cast and crew.\n\n“One of the most difficult things for me as the director was the different dialects — Lebanese and Kuwaiti Arabic. That’s why I had a Kuwaiti on set with me who could explain different things. It was very diverse,” El-Semaan says.\n\nBringing pan-Arab stories to the world stage is something El-Semaan often thinks about. It is important to the director to break down misconceptions and authentically represent his people.\n\n“It’s a fine line, not shifting to a story that doesn’t look like our society and that doesn’t look like us,” he says. “You have to maintain the authenticity of the project, but, at the same time, take things up a notch and build on the story to do something that people haven’t seen before.”\n\nTo do that, El-Semaan says he tried to foster an on-set environment that offered his actors and crew the freedom to collaborate in the filmmaking process. While he acknowledges his role as the final decision-maker, El-Semaan’s approach hinges on mutual involvement, with actors and crew members encouraged to contribute their insights and creativity. He shuns the notion of a director versus crew dynamic, instead fostering an environment where every individual is a valued partner in the project.\n\n“I do not work with people who are not partners, I want people involved,” he says. “I want them to help build my vision, change my vision, and surprise me at times.” It is then his job to know how best to handle those surprises.\n\n“There are always things you need to know how to deal with on the spot. That’s what we do for a living: make decisions,” El-Semaan says.\n\nHis championing of the idea of collective dreaming and dialogue, he believes, gives him a greater chance of creating the best possible film from the material. In his words, “That’s how you come up with a better project.”\n\nAs he eagerly awaits the film’s launch, El-Semaan reflects on the transformative power of cinema and the joy of bringing diverse voices together to create something truly special. To him, it’s not just about entertaining audiences, but also about sparking conversations, challenging stereotypes, and fostering a deeper understanding of the human experience.\n\n“I’m sure there’s always room for improvement,” he says. “There’s always more we can do.”\n\nDUBAI: The Middle East, especially the GCC, has always been an important region for luxury fashion labels. More recently, Saudi Arabia with its fast growing fashion ecosystem and its appetite for luxury takes center stage with luxury labels increasing their presence in the Kingdom – be it through hosting events, collaborating with local talent or opening new stores. Fausto Puglisi, creative director of Roberto Cavalli recently visited the Kingdom as part of Women’s Wear Daily’s (WWD) global fashion summit held in Riyadh and Arab News spoke to him after the event to get his take on the burgeoning significance of the regional market.\n\nThe designer was struck by the dynamic blend of tradition and modernity that defines Saudi Arabia, saying: “What’s fascinating is the respect for the roots and, at the same time, the curiosity for the new. It’s one of the few places in the world where you can feel and breathe this mix of past and future.”\n\nThe brand has a long history with Arab clientele and its 2019 sale to Emirati owner Hussain Sajwani further strengthened its relationship with the region. This bond is reflected in the brand’s successful collaborations with Middle Eastern influencers like Karen Wazen, who in 2022 became a global ambassador for the brand. “Roberto Cavalli himself had a lot of business in the Arab world – so there is a connection in the DNA,” Puglisi explained.\n\nPuglisi's vision for Roberto Cavalli involves blending the classic with the contemporary, a concept he feels resonates well with the Saudi market. Since taking over as creative director in 2020, Puglisi is looking to lead the brand into a new era.\n\n“I am very happy and honored. My journey is connected to a bigger ambition — to make this brand very big again,” he said.\n\nFor the future, he also envisions targeted collections for the local market.\n\n“I would like to develop a collection of abayas and scarves for women to pair with jeans and beautiful shoes creating a look that blends classic and modern styles,” he said.\n\nDUBAI: Uruguayan filmmaker Fede Alvarez – known for directing popular horror flicks like “Evil Dead” and “Don’t Breathe” – takes on one of the most iconic horror/sci-fi franchises of our time with “Alien: Romulus,” and with a masterful touch, pares it back to its roots.\n\nWritten by Álvarez and Rodo Sayagues, “Romulus” takes place between the events of Ridley Scott’s 1979 classic “Alien” and James Cameron’s beloved 1986 follow-up “Aliens,” firmly putting itself in the narrative of the original films.\n\nGiving the franchise a young adult spin for the first time in its long history, “Romulus” follows a group of 20-something space colonists who decide to explore a derelict, decommissioned space station in the hopes of getting off their sunless mining colony and making their way to a lush planet in a faraway system.\n\nAt the heart of the crew are Rain (Cailee Spaeny, who you will know from “Priscilla” and “Civil War”) and her adopted brother Andy (David Jonsson), who is a synthetic created by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation (the company behind the mining colony and the space station).\n\nOther than the siblings, the rag-tag crew of rebellious colonizers include Tyler (Archie Renoux, “Shadow and Bone”), Kay (Isabela Merced, “The Last of Us”), Bjorn (Spike Fearm, “Back to Black”) and Navarro (debutant Aileen Wu).\n\nThe film shines when it is exploring its themes of fraternity and finding courage in dark moments; and the messy interpersonal relationships between the young group members drive the story forward in meaningful, if predictable, ways. Spaeny and Jonsson especially turn in nuanced performances and have a satisfying arc to their personal and intertwined journeys.\n\nThe real draw of the movie is, of course, its monsters — the Xenomorphs and the face-huggers are as terrifying as ever and the movie never lets up on the body horror and gore. Combining retro-futuristic, expansive sets, expertly crafted practical effects and a gorgeous-yet-eerie background score, “Romulus” is a fun ride for thrill seekers who want a lived-in and familiar vibe while getting spooked.\n\nIf forced to nitpick, a minor quibble would be the gratuitous fan service, which at best is cringey and at its worst takes away from the emotional gravitas of the film. While not completely unwelcome, a little bit of restraint could have gone a long way.\n\nLONDON: There are few more exciting movie lineups than Damon, Liman and Affleck. The first two, of course, are star and director of 2022’s “The Bourne Identity” and kickstarted one of the smartest spy franchises to date, and though the Affleck in question here is Casey, not Damon’s regular collaborator, Ben (who takes a producer role), “The Instigators” is still stuffed with enough star power to make for a tantalizing proposition. And that’s before you even get to a supporting cast that includes Ving Rhames, Hong Chau, Ron Perlman, Paul Walter Houser, Toby Jones and Alfred Molina.\n\nDamon and Affleck star as Rory and Cobby, a pair of down-on-their luck Bostonians who agree to rob the corrupt city mayor (Perlman) for a local crime boss. When the job goes wrong, they wind up on the run, stopping only to snatch Rory’s therapist (Chau) who believes she can talk them into turning themselves in. As they lurch from one calamitous misstep to the next, the pair bicker (in the way that only on-screen Bostonians can) and snipe their way across the city as they flee cops, hitmen and special operatives.\n\nPart buddy-comedy, part-heist thriller, part-action movie, “The Instigators” ends up being none of these things in their entirety. What’s remarkable, in fact, is that it’s so middle-of-the-road that it’s actually very satisfying — funny but not hilarious, sweary but not gratuitous, exciting but never blockbusting. Liman races through the setup so he can have fun with the fallout, and in his two leads he has a duo with peppy chemistry and believable snark. Chau’s deadpan, incredulous shrink is a lot of fun, while Perlman chews the scenery as the slimy mayor, and Molina steals every single one of his few scenes as a brooding enforcer. Set pieces are used sparingly, but efficiently (this is definitely not an all-out action movie).\n\nUltimately, it’s the Damon/Affleck dynamic that makes “The Instigators” really hum, with both leads very much on their game. “The Instigators” isn’t spectacular, but as a couple of hours of escapism, it’s as satisfyingly competent as you could hope for."
