        "text": "From relaxing seaside hamlets to glamorous metropolitan cities, the European country that gave us pizza, pasta, gelato, and much more offers something for every kind of couple. Honeymooning in Italy is simply timeless; travelers are spoiled for choice when it comes to the romantic experiences they can have while visiting this Mediterranean gem.\n\n“In Italy, you can have a really varied itinerary, and traveling between places is relatively easy,” says luxury travel advisor Katie Jacobson. That’s likely why Italy has been the top requested honeymoon destination for her clients.\n\nBut with so many destinations packed into a country roughly the size of California, how do you begin to plan your dream trip? With an outline of the best options, of course! Read on for a helpful overview of how to honeymoon in Italy, including the best season to visit, the average cost, our top romantic hotels, and places you should definitely consider adding to your must-see list.\n\nPlanning Your Italy Honeymoon\n\n“The best time to visit Italy is May to mid-June, but September is my favorite,” says Jacobson. “The weather is really nice, but you don’t have as many crowds as in the peak summer months. Also, the sea has had all summer to warm up, so it’s a great time for swimming and boating on the Amalfi Coast.” When it comes to when to avoid going, Jacobson notes that July and August are typically the busiest months, and when museums and historical sites will be packed with throngs of tourists. August is also when many Europeans themselves head on vacation, which could mean that a lot of smaller, family-owned establishments in Italy will be closed.\n\nPer Jacobson, a ten-day or two-week trip is ideal—as is spending a minimum of three nights in each place. “Otherwise, things are too rushed,” she says. “I don’t ever want couples to feel like their honeymoon is just packing and unpacking.” A two-week honeymoon in Italy also gives you time to relax and kick back before gearing up for more ambitious adventures. Jacobson always aims to construct her itineraries accordingly. “After the wedding, traveling, and jet lag, I think it’s nice to start somewhere really relaxing,” she explains. “Then you’re more ready and excited to explore a city or be active.”\n\nIf your trip runs two weeks, that leaves time to explore three-to-four destinations at a comfortable pace.\n\nPlaces to Stay During Your Italy Honeymoon\n\nWith so many incredible hotels throughout the various destinations within Italy, you'll want to do your research when it comes to accommodations. From seaside resorts along the Amalfi Coast to sleek, modern hotels nestled into palazzos in Venice, these are our top picks for the best honeymoon hotels in Italy.\n\nAman Venice\n\nAn obvious choice for romance, it's nearly impossible to go wrong by staying at an Aman property, and the luxury hotel brand's Venice output is exceptionally romantic. Nestled into the floating city's Palazzo Papadopoli, guests can expect a beautiful balance of Rococo artwork and Jean-Michel Gathy interiors, art-forward suites (think frescoes and classic Italian reliefs) with prime views of the Grand Canal, and private gardens.\n\nGrand Hotel Tremezzo\n\nThis iconic art nouveau gem on the western shores of Lake Como is the epitome of Italian romance; three umbrella-dotted pools, a private beach, an on-site park, and sweeping views of the Grigne Mountains are just a few of its many selling points. Couples can either stay at the sumptuous main property or explore one of the smaller nearby villas like Villa Passalacqua, an 18th-century mansion-turned-hotel with stunning lake views, 24 individually-appointed rooms, and an intimate setting for couples in search of an especially private escape.\n\nPalazzo Avino\n\nFor a particularly memorable stay along the coast in Ravello, book a suite at Palazzo Avino, a five-star hotel built in a 12th-century villa with a Michelin-starred restaurant. Interiors are light, airy, and elegant, and the cliffside location is a top-tier Amalfi Coast experience.\n\nCa' di Dio\n\nNestled along the harbor in Venice sits Ca' di Dio, a modern darling of the Venice hotel offerings, designed by renowned architect Patricia Urquiola. Wood paneling and Murano lamps are just a few of the enticing, fresh design elements throughout the property, which feels like a respite from the hustle and bustle of Venetian streets. Couples should be sure to give the on-site restaurant, Vero, a visit (or two).\n\nLA ROQQA\n\nAfter three years of renovation, the 55-room-and-suite LA ROQQA, tucked away in Tuscany's Porto Ercole, has been transformed into a chic, contemporary getaway that's perfect for couples and honeymooners. As of June 2024, the hotel now boasts the ultra-cool Isolotto Beach Club, where guests can take in the sun and sea from plush chairs or enjoy oceanfront drinks from the beachside bar. If you're looking for more formal dining during your stay, the hotel's rooftop restaurant, Scirocco, which affords guests views over Porto Ercole and the Corsini Botanical Gardens, is the spot to dine. (Don't miss the seemingly simple but surprisingly complex spaghetti 8 pomodori.) And, with a focus on sustainability (the property is plastic-free, donates each day's unused food to the needy, and was renovated using traceable materials), it's a post-nuptial getaway destination you can feel very good about.\n\nGrand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria\n\nSituated on a stunning cliffside in Sorrento, overlooking the glimmering Gulf of Naples, this five-star luxury hotel is the stuff of honeymoon dreams. Just as elegant as it is historically significant (it's been in operation since 1834), the Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria will whisk honeymooners to a place of Italian romance. With 81 beautifully-appointed rooms and suites, locally-sourced cuisine served by the waterfront, and an ever-attentive staff, this should be a special stop on your Italian itinerary.\n\nLe Sirenuse Positano\n\nStriking from the inside out, Le Sirenuse features light and airy, sophisticated rooms with an elegant yet home-away-from-home feeling that will leave honeymooners debating whether stay in bed a little longer or head into the lively streets of Positano (you can't go wrong with either decision). From the outside, the iconic red-and-white exterior pops against the pool and the glimmering Mediterranean. The noteworthy restaurants on-site, La Sponda and Aldos', are both worth booking for at least one meal,\n\nBorgo Santo Pietro\n\nNestled amongst the rolling hills and vineyards of Tuscany, this five-star boutique hotel was once a healing retreat for medieval pilgrims. Between the multiple restaurants, the relaxation spa, the farm-to-plate dining concept, and a bountiful 300-acre estate for exploration, this is the perfect countryside retreat for the discerning couple.\n\nBrunelleschi\n\nLocated in Florence's Renaissance district and housed in a sixth-century Byzantine tower, Brunelleschi emulates romance from every corner of the property. With close proximity to city attractions like the Uffizi galleries, the Ponte Vecchio, and Palazzo Strozzi, rooms and suites are refined and offer stunning views of the city skyline.\n\nReschio\n\nFew experiences are like that of Reschio, a sprawling luxury estate nestled between Umbria and Tuscany. Stay in the property's castle—one that is over 1,000 years old—or opt for one of the seven available farmhouses and spend days playing tennis, exploring the pristine, lush grounds (a whopping 1,500 hectares), riding horseback, and admiring the interior's bespoke design and antique collections.\n\nEitch Borromini\n\nEitch Borromini, located within a 17th-century palace, occupies prime real estate in a particularly romantic corner of Rome overlooking the Fountain of the Four Rivers by Bernini and the charming Piazza Navona. With no detail left untouched, the hotel is the perfect respite from the busy streets of this Italian metropolis. Couples should make sure to see both the on-site art gallery and the stunning rooftop bar.\n\nThings to Do During Your Italy Honeymoon\n\nWith so many desirable destinations spread across this Mediterranean paradise, you'll want a solid idea of what to expect well before you begin plotting your itinerary. Here are our top recommendations for romantic things to do in Italy, conveniently broken down by location.\n\nExplore the Amalfi Coast\n\nJacobson’s top pick for a seaside honeymoon destination in Italy is the Amalfi Coast. Situated about an hour south of Naples on the Tyrrhenian Sea, the picturesque cliffside towns are best known for their beaches, but there’s so much more to do. “It’s great for hiking, there are wineries, and cooking classes are really popular in the area,” says Jacobson. Though Positano is perhaps the most well-known, Jacobson’s favorite town in the region is Ravello, which is situated a touch higher in the hills, and, as a result, offers stunning views of the fishing villages below.\n\nHike Along Cinque Terre\n\nTravel east from Portofino to reach these five picturesque villages in the La Spezia Province of Liguria. Known for pastel-hued homes built into seaside cliffs, the small towns of Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore and the surrounding hills became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1997. Several walking and hiking paths connect the villages, with Via dell'Amore and Sentiero Azzurro being the most popular, but check conditions with a local tourist office before you head out—landslides and ongoing construction may mean major parts of your chosen path will be closed.\n\nSpend a Day in Florence\n\nThe capital of Italy’s Tuscany region is known for walkable cobblestone streets and the world’s largest collection of Italian Renaissance art. You’ll find Michelangelo's David at the Accademia Gallery, and Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus at the Uffizi Gallery, an absolute treasure trove of classic works from the once-private collections of the Medici banking family, which wielded considerable power over the city from the 15th through 18th centuries—and produced four popes.\n\nFor couples looking for romance on the water, Jacobson has booked sunset cruises down the Arno River, which runs through the heart of the city. Though Florence is famed for its street food—and there are many tours available to guide you through sampling it all—be careful about where you consume your snacks. In 2018, the city banned eating on the sidewalk in the historic center.\n\nBook a Hotel at Lake Como\n\nLive like George and Amal with an excursion to Lake Como, a beautiful body of water nestled at the base of the Alps in northern Italy’s Lombardy region. Ninety minutes north of Milan, the area is filled with grand villas that were once the countryside homes of the city’s nobility. Beyond relaxing at any one of the opulent waterside hotels, you can also hike the hillsides and book boat trips for watersports. Also good to know: Because of its northern location, Lake Como is an especially enjoyable destination during peak summer months, because the temps are noticeably cooler.\n\nExplore Milan\n\nThough perhaps more frequented by business travelers than honeymooners, this major northern Italian city, capital of the Lombardy region, should still be high on your must-visit list—particularly for the sartorially inclined. As one of the major global fashion capitals, it’s home to high-fashion brands such as Armani, Prada, Missoni, and Versace.\n\nBeyond great shopping, there’s also Il Duomo, the largest church in Italy, which took almost six centuries to complete, and The Last Supper mural by Leonardo da Vinci, which can be seen at its original location at the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In lieu of fancy dinner reservations, you may want to spend your evenings hopping between eateries for aperitivo, particularly in the lively canal-side neighborhood of Navigli. Milan is well-known for its over-the-top approach to happy hour, during which bars and restaurants put out lavish spreads of apps to enjoy alongside your drinks.\n\nVisit Pompeii\n\nIn 79 A.D., the volcano Mt. Vesuvius erupted in the Gulf of Naples and wiped out the nearby Roman city of Pompeii in the process. Thick layers of ash preserved the remains of the city surprisingly well, and today, you can walk through excavations that paint a remarkably complete picture of what life was like there almost 2000 years ago. Recent discoveries make it even more exciting to visit right now, as does the fact that the city of Naples, the birthplace of pizza, is less than a 30-minute drive away.\n\nSee Portofino\n\nThe Italian Riviera is a coastal strip in northwest Italy’s Liguria region that winds around the Ligurian sea. (Head west along the water for a few hours and you’ll eventually reach Nice and Cannes.) The electric blue waters are dotted with the colorful buildings of quaint fishing villages—Camogli and Santa Margherita Ligure being two of the more low-key—but for a taste of the chic life, plan to stop in Portofino. Though you can’t lounge on the beach, you can peruse high-end boutiques, drink limoncello cocktails and eat fresh seafood at waterside restaurants, and maybe even do a little celeb-spotting. (Everyone from Jennifer Lopez to Beyonce and Jay-Z has vacationed in town.)\n\nHead to Puglia\n\nForming the heel of the Italian boot, this coastal region on the Adriatic Sea is an up-and-coming destination with American travelers, and for good reason. Hotels are opening at a rapid clip to take advantage of the turquoise waters and white sand, but many other travelers are drawn in by the slower pace of life that emanates from the surrounding farmland. (For the full rustic experience, book a farmhouse-style masseria.)\n\nSituated further inland, Lecce is known as the “Florence of the South” because of its impressive Baroque architecture, while Ostuni, less than one hour north, attracts visitors with its white-washed buildings. To really vacation luxuriously, book a suite at Borgo Egnazia, which hosted Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel’s 2012 nuptials.\n\nExperience Rome\n\nIf you’ve never been to Italy, the country’s capital city should absolutely be on your itinerary. Situated just off the center of the western coast, Rome is Italy’s most populous city and home to several world-renowned historical ruins. Built between 70 and 80 A.D., the open-air Colosseum amphitheater was used for public spectacles such as gladiator battles, while the Pantheon, one of the best-preserved monuments of the same era, served as a house of worship for the Roman gods. Love to people-watch? Head to the Spanish Steps and nearby Trevi Fountain, a massive ornate Baroque fountain set in the center of the city, where tourists and locals alike are known to gather.\n\nBeyond bucket-list tourist attractions, there are also many charming neighborhoods to explore in Rome. Jacobson’s favorite? Trastevere. “It’s so charming, with its small pedestrian-only walkways,” she says. “It’s the kind of place where you can go to a restaurant with six tables and hear only Italian spoken because there aren’t as many Americans.”\n\nEscape to Sardinia\n\nAnother less well-known destination amongst non-European travelers, the Mediterranean island of Sardinia offers a bit of everything, as well as a taste of life at a deliciously slower pace. There are romantic resorts and white-sand beaches (Costa Smeralda and Spiaggia di Piscinas are both popular), but also rugged mountains and ancient stone-walled ruins (nuraghi towers being the most common). For a unique foodie experience, visit during the Feast of San Francesco in May or October for a chance to try su filindeu, the world’s rarest pasta.\n\nAdventure in the Dolomites\n\nOutdoor adventurers flock to this remote mountain range in Northeastern Italy for skiing and snowshoeing in the winter and mountaineering in the summer. With parts originally belonging to Austria until Italy annexed them after World War I, Dolomite food and culture can feel unique from the rest of the country: In certain places, expect lots of strudel and sauerkraut, and to hear German spoken more commonly than Italian. Two must-dos: hike to Lago di Braies, a remote Alpine lake where you can rent wooden rowboats come summer, and the Messner Mountain Museum Corrones, where you’ll explore the history and science of mountain climbing in a futuristic Zaha Hadid-designed structure.\n\nEat and Drink Your Way Through Tuscany\n\nItaly’s most well-known wine region is located in the west-central part of the country. With rolling hills, expansive sunflower fields, and rustic country estates, it's every bit as pretty as the movies paint it. Yes, there are vineyards aplenty—Jacobson especially loves Castello di Albola, as well as options in the Bolgheri region—where you can see the grapes and sample chiantis, but don’t forget about the olive oil. For a bit of history, head to Siena—the historic city center is a UNESCO World Heritage site—or the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The towns of Montepulciano and San Gimignano, both easy day trips from Florence, also paint a pristine picture of medieval Italy.\n\nSee Vatican City\n\nYou don’t have to be Catholic, or even religious, to be wowed by the home of the highest leader of the church. Though it’s fully surrounded by Rome, the 109-acre Vatican City is technically its own city-state, with its own government. Here you’ll find the Sistine Chapel, where the massive ceiling is adorned with elaborate frescoes painted by Michelangelo, and room after sumptuous room of historical treasures in the many Vatican museums. Especially breathtaking: The Gallery of Maps, and the four Raphael rooms.\n\nWander Through Venice\n\nLocated high in the eastern portion of the boot in the Venetian Lagoon, Venice is known for water. In lieu of roads, many of its main passageways are canals, which makes romantic gondola rides and water taxis an integral part of a visit. To marvel at ornate architecture from a comfortable cafe seat, head to Piazza San Marco, the city’s largest and most important square. (Be sure to order a bellini—the cocktail was invented in Venice.) To take in priceless works of modern art, schedule a visit to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, where you’ll see paintings and sculptures from the Cubism and Surrealism movements. To shop colorful glassware and pose for pics against rainbow-hued homes lining canals, head to the nearby islands of Murano and Burano.\n\nWith so many winding streets and hidden gems to explore in a city like Venice, it can feel overwhelming to figure out where to head first. For that reason, Jacobson recommends hiring a guide for a few hours on your first day. “They can help you get oriented, share off-the-beaten-path areas, and tell you about their favorite restaurants,” she says.\n\nWhere to Eat During Your Italy Honeymoon\n\nNeedless to say, one of the most enticing elements of planning an Italian honeymoon is, of course, the cuisine. And the wine. The pasta. The pizza. The gelato. Need we say more? To help you get some reservations on the books, here are a few of our top recommendations for romantic meals around Italy.\n\nLa Pergola\n\nLa Pergola is an exquisite gastronomical experience—if you can get a table there. Located in Rome Cavalieri, a Waldorf Astoria Hotel, this restaurant sits perched high atop the Eternal City and is considered one of the most beautiful restaurants in Italy. It boasts three Michelin stars under the guidance of famed chef Heinz Beck, so this is an experience you'll want to book well in advance of your trip.\n\nLa Sponda\n\nLocated within the aforementioned Le Sirenuse, La Sponda's cuisine is just as stunning as the vine-covered walls of the restaurant's interior. The menu features dishes inspired by the traditional food from Naples, with a focus on fresh, local ingredients.\n\nEnoteca Pinchiorri\n\nThis three-Michelin-star restaurant in Florence is well worth booking in advance. Honeymooners can expect fine Tuscan cuisine on beautifully-plated dishes at an establishment with technique, skill, and refinement as its core philosophy.\n\nFelix Lo Basso\n\nJust steps from the Duomo, this Michelin-star outpost in Milan has views and atmosphere (an open-air kitchen) that are just as important to the dining experience as the excellent, artfully-curated Italian cuisine itself.\n\nAmerigo 1934\n\nLocated in the small town of Savigno near the Apennine mountains within Bologna, this low-key trattoria with a long-standing grasp on its Michelin star is known for its truffle-inspired dishes and traditional, expertly-crafted Italian fare.\n\nPizzeria Antonio E Gigi Sorbillo\n\nIf you find yourself in Naples in search of some of Italy's best pizza, it's worth the one-to-two-hour wait for a pizza at Sorbillo, arguably the best pizza spot in the city, where these delicious, hand-crafted pizzas made of organic ingredients are a Neapolitan favorite.\n\nHosteria Giusti\n\nDiners have to walk behind a retro-style delicatessen counter to reach this delightful, authentic Modena restaurant, which offers lunch-only—expect traditional Italian fare in a beautiful setting, and just four tables, so reserve far in advance. (You may have seen it featured on an episode of Netflix's Master of None!)\n\nBudgeting for an Italy Honeymoon\n\nAs with any destination, the cost of a honeymoon in Italy will vary greatly, depending on when you visit, how long you visit, and the level of luxury you're looking for in accommodations, meals, and activities.\n\nYou’ll need to budget for tourist taxes levied upon accommodations in certain cities, as well as VAT, or value-added taxes, on many goods and services. In Italy, the tax is called L’imposta sul valore aggiunto, and shows up as the acronym “IVA” on receipts. The standard rate is rather high—22 percent—but non-European Union residents can claim some of that back when exiting the country. Italy has one of the highest refund rates of all European Union countries, but it also, unfortunately, has one of the highest minimum spend amounts as well."
