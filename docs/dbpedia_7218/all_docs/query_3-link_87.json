        "text": "What is it like traveling on a group tour for your honeymoon?\n\nWe asked travelers Aly and Jared, who joined us on our London, Paris & Rome tour for their honeymoon:\n\n“We loved our tour group. It felt like a giant family by the third day of the tour. Because we were given two and half days of free time in each of the three cities we visited, we were able to spend a lot of alone time together. When we wanted company, we had plenty of friends to tag along with. We highly recommend taking a tour for your honeymoon—the details of traveling were taken care of, and we were able to enjoy every moment with each other soaking in what each city had for us!”\n\n2. Explore Europe’s most romantic cities: London, Paris & Rome\n\n“In London, we wanted to ride the London Eye, and it was everything we could have dreamed of,” said traveler Aly of her honeymoon with husband Jared on our London, Paris & Rome tour. “In Paris, we wanted to see the Mona Lisa at the Louvre. In Rome, we wanted to see the Roman Forum. In every instance, seeing it in person was more than either of us could have expected. We still get goosebumps thinking about each experience.”\n\nIf you can jet off for two enchanting weeks for your honeymoon trip, you’ll return with an incredible travel story to go along with your love story. On one sweeping tour through England, France, and Italy, you’ll see all the iconic sights. Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower, and the Colosseum are just the tip of the iceberg as you delve deep into the history and culture of three of the world’s most inspiring, influential, and romantic cities. Grab a selfie at the Wall of Love in Montmartre, Paris, where you’ll find “I love you” in 250 languages. In London, take in the settings for royal weddings: Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s Cathedral. And in Rome, toss a coin in the Trevi Fountain to ensure you’ll return to the Eternal City.\n\nRomantic, free time excursions\n\nCruise the Seine River at night after dinner at a local restaurant\n\n“We celebrated being newlyweds with a dinner and nighttime cruise on the Seine River in Paris,” said traveler Aly. “That was our favorite dinner of the whole trip. Seeing the Eiffel Tower sparkle was amazing!” Cruising along the Seine on a nighttime excursion, past Paris’ illuminated monuments, is a very romantic way to take in the allure of the City of Light.\n\nBe dazzled by the bling at the Tower of London\n\nWhile famous for its dark history of treason, imprisonment, and beheadings, the Tower of London also sparkles with the Crown Jewels. On this excursion, a local Blue Badge Guide will lead you through the nooks and crannies of this royal castle, seeing ancient coin collections, suits of armor, and the glittering Crown Jewels as you go. Keep an eye out for the Koh-i-Nûr diamond. At 105.6 carats, it’s one of the world’s largest.\n\nExplore the treasures of Vatican City\n\nThe world’s smallest country, Vatican City, may not immediately come to mind as a romantic excursion. But expect to be awed, amazed, and inspired as you gaze up at Michelangelo’s masterpiece on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel or discover masterpieces at every turn in the enormous St. Peter’s Basilica. A visit to Vatican City also allows you to check off another country visited!\n\nStill searching for the best honeymoon destinations? Check out the full itinerary for London, Paris & Rome→\n\n3. Feel the love in Italy’s three must-see cities\n\nOne of traveler Stephanie’s favorite memories from her honeymoon trip on our Venice, Florence & Rome tour was during a free evening in Florence. After the day’s activities, she and her husband spent the evening like locals and went to Piazza della Repubblica. “We were sitting there listening to street performers. I couldn’t have pictured a better moment,” said Stephanie. “They were playing their instruments and singing songs, and everyone was outside singing along.” The romantic simplicity and authenticity of the moment made it unforgettable for the couple.\n\nA honeymoon trip to Italy’s three iconic cities lets you feel the pulse of the country’s vibrant culture, both past and present. It’s everything you want: sightseeing, adventure, and free time with your partner. You’ll find romance in Venice with its sprawling Baroque palaces and gondola-dotted canals. In Florence you’ll be inspired by some of the world’s greatest art. And Rome will capture your hearts with its history, food, people, and way of life.\n\nRomantic, free time excursions\n\nTake a private gondola ride for two in Venice\n\nOne of the most romantic adventures you can have in one of the best honeymoon destinations is a gondola ride through Venice’s canals. You’ll cruise past palaces, along the Canal Grande (the most beautiful street you can imagine), and drink in every magical moment. Don’t forget to ask your gondolier to snap a picture of the two of you!\n\nPicnic in Florence’s Boboli Gardens\n\nIt’s nice to take a break for just the two of you. “Do as the Florentines do and stop in a salumeria to pack a picnic lunch,” said staffer Jamie. Then head to Florence’s beautiful Boboli Gardens to enjoy a bottle of wine and picnic for two under the shade of the oak and cypress trees.\n\nTake a Cooking Class in Rome\n\nMangiamo! There’s nothing more romantic than cooking a special meal together and enjoying the delicious results. “We went to a market and picked out the ingredients, then learned how to make ravioli and fettuccine,” said traveler Stephanie. “It was amazing being around a professional chef who had a passion and talent for cooking with authentic ingredients.”\n\nTop six reasons to honeymoon on a guided group trip→\n\n4. Honeymoon in the romance capital of the world: Paris\n\n“An amazing travel experience from the very beginning of signing up through the very end when we left Paris,” said traveler Marla. “This was my first trip to Europe, and I was nervous to try to plan it all out myself, but this is where Go Ahead steps in and takes care of all the travel worries with lots of coordination and ease. The hotel, dinners, and excursions were all wonderful. I could not have planned any better myself!”\n\nYou’ve been captivated by the l’amour of Paris in movies, books, and TV shows. Your honeymoon is the perfect time to discover it for yourself. You’ll find it all in the City of Love’s charming arrondissements, cozy cafes, and captivating atmosphere. Unpack only once and spend the rest of your honeymoon strolling hand-in-hand along the Seine, marveling at the Eiffel Tower, or finding a table at a sidewalk café to watch Parisians do their thing. Along with your guided tours, you’ll have plenty of free time to be in love in Paris. There’s no better place to go on your honeymoon.\n\nRomantic, free time excursions\n\nShop the food markets of Paris like Julia Child\n\nThere’s a reason, beyond the recipes, French cuisine is so revered: fresh ingredients gathered daily in the local patisseries, charcuteries, and marches. On this delectable excursion, a local guide will take you on a culinary-themed walking tour through Marché des Enfants Rouges, the city's oldest covered market. You’ll stop to sample fresh fruit, cheese, crepes, and pastries at local shops. Bon appétit!\n\nSoak in the splendor of the Sun King’s decadent château\n\nIt took 50 years and 35,000 workers to create Versailles Palace, but you’ll only need a half-day excursion to explore its decadence. Louis XIV’s magnificent 2,300-room palace was the envy of royalty worldwide and set new standards for opulence among the crowned heads of Europe. Come satisfy your curiosity as you marvel at the glittering Hall of Mirrors, the State Apartments, and lavish gardens.\n\nDine like a true Parisian in a local’s home\n\nWhat better way to learn how Parisians eat, live, and think than joining a local at their home to enjoy traditional dishes. During this dinner, you and your spouse will gain an authentic understanding of your host’s day-to-day life while learning about French culture and traditions from a new perspective. It’s a unique experience not to be missed!\n\nSee why Paris is one of the most beautiful honeymoon places→\n\n5. Fall in love all over again on a Grand Tour of Ireland\n\n“Best honeymoon ever!” said traveler William. “This was my husband and I’s honeymoon trip, and it was the best decision ever! Our tour director, Joanne K, was absolutely fabulous and made memories with us to last a lifetime. Go to Ireland now!”\n\nNeed we say more? When you’re searching for the best places to go for a honeymoon, the Emerald Isle has all the ingredients, especially if it’s your first time overseas. Ireland is a short hop across the pond, the scenery is spectacular, the locals are welcoming, the pub culture is fun, and, if you pay close attention to the brogue, the language isn’t a barrier.

From the sheep-dotted green landscapes to the small villages and historic cities that span the country, all the way from Dublin to Derry, you’ll find romance is alive and well in a country famous for its hospitality.\n\nRomantic, free time excursions\n\nFeast like royalty at a castle banquet dinner\n\nKeep the honeymoon magic going with a feast fit for a newlywed king and queen inside the walls of a nearby castle. On this excursion, you’ll sip from a goblet of mead and learn the castle's history before proceeding to the banquet hall, where you’ll enjoy a sumptuous, four-course dinner and an evening of live entertainment, including songs and stories. Think of it as a second wedding reception!\n\nWalk in the footsteps of a mythical giant\n\nPay a visit to the rugged Giant’s Causeway, a series of naturally formed basalt columns the Irish call the 8th Wonder of the World. A colorful local legend says that mythical giant Finn McCool built the walkway so that he could cross the sea to Scotland. The unique rock formations make a great spot for a unique honeymoon photo. Because you’re on a group tour, you’ll always have a friendly fellow traveler to take the perfect shot.\n\nTake afternoon tea in an 18th-century castle\n\nBesides a pint of Guinness, nothing feels quite as Irish as a traditional afternoon tea complete with sweet and savory pastries, including the region’s renowned scones served with clotted cream and jam. Making the tea even more special, you’ll enjoy it at Hillsborough Castle after a guided tour of the castle’s State Rooms and gardens.\n\nSearching destinations for a honeymoon? Discover the top 10 things to do in Ireland on a group tour→\n\n6. New Zealand is a once-in-a-lifetime honeymoon destination\n\n“The beauty of New Zealand takes your breath away,” said traveler Marianne. “Snow-capped mountains, crystal-clear lakes, rivers, waterfalls, glaciers, meadows dotted with sheep and dairy cows, and the most beautiful forests. And there is the ocean and its beaches. I recommend it highly.”\n\nWe couldn’t create a more perfect romantic destination than New Zealand, no matter how hard we tried. Whether you’re in search of adventure or quiet moments, you’ll find it all on this island nation. When you cruise through the fjords of Milford Sound or ascend the peaks of the Southern Alps, you’ll understand why New Zealand is known for its stunningly varied and untamed setting. You and your spouse will get a taste of it all on this small group Adventure Tour, while we take care of every detail of one of the best honeymoon destinations ever.\n\nRomantic, free time excursions\n\nTake a torchlit nighttime wildlife walk\n\nGrab a torch and your partner’s hand and join a guided nighttime walk through Zealandia Ecosanctuary to see and hear the nocturnal sights and sounds in the native forest. You’ll encounter rare and endangered species that can only be seen at night, including incredible glowworms and spotted kiwi.\n\nGo kayaking on Lake Wakatipu\n\nOne of New Zealand’s most stunning sights, Lake Wakatipu is even more beautiful when viewed from the water. You’ll learn the basics of kayaking (no experience needed) before you paddle out into Lake Wakatipu, where the two of you can admire its tree-lined shores and The Remarkables mountain range that rises dramatically above the shoreline.\n\nSoak in the spectacular views on Waiheke Island\n\nHop aboard a ferry for a scenic cruise to Waiheke Island, where you’ll spend a relaxing day tasting award-winning olive oils and wines at a boutique vineyard. You’ll have free time together to eat lunch, visit the art galleries and shops, or head to the beach for some alone time.\n\nSee what we have planned for you in New Zealand—one of the top honeymoon destinations→\n\n7. View incredible wildlife on safari in Tanzania\n\n“Every park, in some aspect, will blow your mind,” said traveler Susan. “From Tarangire's elephants to Lake Manyara's tent accommodations to the incredible vastness and difficulty of the Serengeti, and to the sheer abundance of animals and beauty of the Ngorongoro Crater. Go Ahead Tours has hit a home run with this one! Tanzania will not disappoint.”\n\nAdventure awaits honeymooners who want to take a walk on the wild side. The wild side of the animal kingdom, that is. Time seems to stand still in the eternal plains of Tanzania, yet every day on this small group Safari Tour is thrilling and new. You’ll go in search of lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos (even the exceedingly rare black rhino!), and more with the help of a local guide. The landscape, from the legendary Serengeti to the “Garden of Eden” at Ngorongoro Crater, is as stunning and spectacular as the wildlife. It’s one of the most thrilling and memorable honeymoon destinations.\n\nRomantic, free time excursions\n\nMake like a sultan on the magical island of Zanzibar\n\nWhile the nature of safaris doesn’t allow for free time excursions, you could lengthen your honeymoon (who wants it to end?) by adding a three-night extension to one of Africa’s most beautiful islands: Zanzibar. You can kick back on one of its breathtaking beaches, tour the Sultan’s Palace with a local expert, and view endangered sea turtles at a coral lagoon.\n\nTake a sunset sail on a traditional Arab pearling boat\n\nTop off an incredible two weeks in Africa by setting sail on a dhow, helmed by a skilled crew. Your only job is to sit back, relax, and enjoy the peacefulness of the ocean as the two of you watch the sunset with a cold drink in hand.
