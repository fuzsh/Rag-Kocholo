So did the Creel Triplets and Barry Bostwick. This film was released only seven months after the previous sequel.\n\nPlot[]\n\nAfter inheriting a family resort in Hawaii, Susan (Hayley Mills) and Jeffrey Wyatt (Barry Bostwick) decide this is the place to stay at their honeymoon. They both head for Hawaii with their triplets, Lisa, Jessie, and Megan Wyatt with Sharon Grand (Hayley Mills), Susan's twin sister.\n\nThey find the resort in such a run-down condition, that they decide to repair it and sell it. The triplets, spending most of their time at the beach begin meeting boys while Susan and Jeffrey repair the resort. Jeffrey meets an old high school rival, Ray (John M. Jackson) who promises to keep the resort as-is if Jeffrey will sell it to him. He has other plans in mind, however, and they are not limited merely to Jeffrey's resort.\n\nCast[]\n\nRole Actor Susan Wyatt/Sharon Grand Hayley Mills Jeffrey Wyatt Barry Bostwick Lisa Wyatt Leanna Creel Jessie Wyatt Monica Lacy Megan Wyatt Joy Creel Ray John M.
