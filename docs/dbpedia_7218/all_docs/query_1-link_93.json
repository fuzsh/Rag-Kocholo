        "text": "Rarely do we acknowledge loving, caring male parents, and sometimes we even take fathers for granted. The official holiday that is meant to compensate for this oversight is Father’s Day, one Sunday in June dedicated to appreciating dads.\n\nA father figure can fill the void as a loving mentor, whether he’s a stepfather, another relative, a teacher, or a friend. Stepparents have a bad reputation, but they can be wonderful influences on their stepchildren’s lives.\n\nModern entertainment and media tend to depict fathers and other male figures of authority as bumbling, clueless goofballs instead of dignified, intelligent role models. To find respectful, inspiring father figures in films and television shows, you often must look to movies made decades ago.\n\nHe is determined to win them over, though, despite their formality with him. Preparations for the nuptials go smoothly until Katie’s sister (Lillian Bronson) falls down the stairs right before the ceremony and breaks her leg.\n\nSince she was going to care for the children, the newlyweds can either cancel their plans or take the children with them on their honeymoon. They decide on the latter.\n\nDuring their trip to the Grand Canyon, they face a series of adventures and misadventures, including losing the boys at a train stop, spending the night with a farmer who skins skunks, sleeping on a daycoach, and almost losing the daughter’s beloved stuffed toy off a ledge. Can the new marriage survive all these trials?\n\nHe tries to win them over by describing the things they’ll do together once he lives with them, but he can’t measure up to their late father’s skills. He even struggles to keep the boys’ names straight, and the three youngsters still call him Mr. Jordan!\n\nDuring the titular family honeymoon, Grant quickly proves that he will be a loving, doting father figure. He caters to the youngsters’ whims, buying them anything they want and prioritizing their feelings, no matter how silly. He even risks his own life to rescue Zoe’s beloved but troublesome stuffed panda bear from the edge of the canyon. Yet instead of being grateful, the children often respond with criticism and continued formality. Through it all, Grant remains patient and loving.\n\nIn addition, the cinematography of the beautiful Grand Canyon in the 1940s will entice you to pack your bags and head for Arizona’s most famous landmark. Unusual for this era, scenes for “Family Honeymoon” were actually filmed on location at Grand Canyon National Park.\n\nWhether you want to celebrate biological fathers, stepfathers, grandfathers, uncles, or other father figures, “Family Honeymoon” is a delightful tribute to the men who shape our lives."
