        "text": "If you are reading this right now, particularly if you’re engaged- can you imagine your life in 5 years? What you two will look like, where you’ll live, how you’ll feel about each other?\n\nI certainly couldn’t have dreamed up where Justin and I would be in our 5th year of marriage. I love him so much more than I did on our wedding day (people kept saying that was a thing- it didn’t really make sense to me until now) we WORK together full time(!), we’ve purchased our first home, and it seems like life just keeps getting better.\n\nAs we’ve reflected back on our wedding planning, we wanted to share three pieces of advice. Our hope is that these will change how you think about wedding planning, and get you excited and ready for the adventure of marriage ahead.\n\n1) Do the first look\n\nI did NOT want to do a first look, y’all! Since I was younger, I always loved that quintessential “aisle moment”, and couldn’t imagine anything else. While planning, Justin told me he was particularly passionate about the first look and asked if I’d reconsider. (Especially when I said I wanted a lot of time with him and to enjoy cocktail hour with our guests) Marriage is about compromise, so I went on with it. Looking back- I can’t imagine how little we would have seen each other that day if we didn’t do that first look! Our first look allowed us to spend the day together starting at 1:30 pm as opposed to 5:00. 3 extra hours of quality time with my husband on our wedding day is something I wouldn’t trade for anything.\n\nTo read more about why I loved my 180 on this choice, see my blog “5 reasons to consider a first look” here.\n\n2) Plan out a ceremony that is meaningful\n\nDon’t believe the lie that you have to “get through the ceremony” to get to the fun part of the day (the reception). Nothing breaks my heart more than when I hear this sentiment!\n\nOur wedding ceremony was sacred, and we look back on it still in awe at the sense of emotion that came along with the commitments we made that day. I love that we took the time to incorporate readings, a song our friend sang, communion, a ring warming ceremony, and writing our own vows. We had a friend officiate for us, and meticulously thought about each detail of this special time. It’s worth so much more to us than flowers, food, music, etc. It’s the reason we were all there that day and we wanted it to feel that way! Would highly recommend everyone take the time to create a ceremony that is meaningful.\n\n3) Hire the amazing photographer (and videographer)\n\nHonestly, I’m not saying this because I’m a photographer. This isn’t a sales pitch. This is just me, a former bride, understanding ONLY post-wedding just how much our wedding photos and video mean to me. Many people assume Justin and I hired a friend, or got a discount on photography because he was a photographer too. NOPE! Justin and I hired our amazing wedding photographer Brett Heidebrecht (@brettheidbrecht) simply because we loved the quality of his work and felt connected to him after talking. In full transparency, he was more expensive than Justin’s wedding collections at the time. We happily paid every penny, and now looking back, my only regret is not paying for MORE time and another photographer on the team to have even more of his amazing images! Truly some of the best money we’ve spent in our life together has been on quality photography- we look at our images all the time and can’t wait to share these heirlooms with our kids someday.\n\nHow did you two meet?\n\nHaha! Online....super romantic, right?! It took us a while to finally admit we liked each other enough to give the relationship a real \"go\" - Jack refuses to believe that I didn't like him all that much at first. LOL! We tell people we aren't super close to that we met at a bar though...which is *technically* true. The first time we ever saw each other in person was at the rooftop bar at Del Friscos.\n\nTell us about the proposal!\n\nJack once told me while we were vacation in Italy (and I was getting mass amounts of texts from friends asking if he'd proposed yet), \"Italy isn't our life...why would I propose here? I'm more likely to propose on a random Tuesday in the kitchen.\"\n\nSo imagine my surprise when he proposed on a random WEDNESDAY in the kitchen! He had gone to get the kids from a play date down the street and they all came back in carrying baby carrots and in unison, they said \"how does a carrot ask a question?\" Jack is notorious for his dad jokes, but I was so confused. Then my son walked to me with his carrot, which had the ring on it. The kids screamed \"we have carrots and he has a question!\" :) He then smacked my behind and said \"Let's get married!\"\n\n“Wedding albums are so expensive, and I really don’t see the point of spending all of that money when we have our pictures online to look at whatever we want.”- Me.\n\nYep, I said that exact sentence, years ago, right after Justin and I got our wedding images and he wanted to order an album. I’m the Sally saver in our relationship, and to be honest I had a little bit of sticker shock when I looked into purchasing a wedding album; I quickly decided it wasn’t worth it.\n\nWell, marriage is about compromise, so eventually Justin convinced me, and he did everything on his own when it came to ordering our wedding album and getting it on the way. When it came in, it sat in the box for days because I really didn’t care that much about looking at it. Fast forward to the night Justin and I finally sat down on the sofa to flip through it- and cue the waterworks. It was the first time I actually cried looking at our wedding images! Since then, I’ve reflected a lot on why the album made me feel the way it did, because let me tell you, I went from album scrooge to album believer in about 5 seconds.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I truly feel it’s my responsibility to share with you the 5 reasons I firmly believe every person should own a high quality wedding album- scroll on!\n\n1) Re-visit your wedding day cuddled up in bed, not huddled behind a computer screen\n\nRecently, I polled our followers on instagram about wedding albums… Did you know that 75% of people who don’t have a wedding album have to pull out their computer every single time they want to look at the images from their big day? This honestly and truly broke my heart. One of my all time favorite moments on Justin and I’s anniversary is when we crack open a bottle of wine, get in bed or sit on the sofa, and slowly reminisce on our wedding day as we flip through the pages of our album. I don’t know about you, but enough of my day is spent behind a glowing screen- I love having something I can physically hold and touch anytime I want to look back on our wedding day, and I know you will too.\n\n2) Create a family heirloom\n\nOk- this was the cry moment for me. When we opened our album for the first time and I burst into tears, I immediately told Justin “Oh my gosh- Our grandkids are going to hold this someday”. That really hit me hard. Maybe I’m an old soul, but in today’s world of fast fashion and disposable everything, it seems like no one thinks about the future or invests in quality anymore! Sure, you can make a shutterfly book of your wedding images…. but I promise you it’ll be faded and ripped and thrown away someday. I didn’t realize until I held our album in my hands how sturdy and luxurious it felt, and I can honestly say I have confidence that this book will outlive us. I’m so excited we had the opportunity to create an heirloom that our kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids can enjoy.\n\n3) Don’t rely on technology alone\n\nSocial media apps come and go, and yet the other 20% of people (that I polled online that don’t have a wedding album) said that that’s how they re-visit their wedding day. I have a hard time believing that at 75 years old, when you want to take a look at your wedding pictures, you’ll whip out your iPhone and scroll back on your instagram by 50 years.\n\nComputers fail, hard drives fail, the ‘it’ social media app is ever changing…. but a tangible wedding album is truly timeless and outlasts technology trends.\n\n4) Design a beautiful statement piece for your home\n\nIf nothing else- wedding albums are beautiful! Justin spent years sourcing the absolute best album company in the country, because we believe our clients are deserving of the best. Each album is designed from scratch, and made completely custom for each couple we work with. From the fabric and color, to what’s printed or debossed on the cover, you can choose something that fits your personal style so that you can proudly display your wedding album on a coffee table, bookshelf, or bedroom accent table.\n\nOur albums are all crafted by hand right here in the united states and truly have an un-matched quality and luxurious feel. You’ll be proud for any guest in your home to flip through it’s pages as they’re transported back to your special day!\n\n5) Tell the story of your wedding instead of combing through 1000+ images\n\nDid you know that 50 years ago, most people typically only received a small handful of images from their wedding day? I’m talking… for sure less than 100. Goodness, how times have changed! Depending on the number of hours booked, most of our clients receive close to 1000 or more images from their wedding day! As great as it is to have all of those pictures, you don’t exactly have an hour or two to spare every time you want to look at your wedding photos. I love wedding albums because we design a concise story that showcases the wedding from start to finish- no overwhelm involved.\n\nTropical palm trees, beautiful beach front sunsets, the iconic Gasparilla Inn…. what more could you want in an engagement session? Bridget and will are getting married in Boca Grande this December because it’s meaningful to them. They have so many special memories as a couple in this Florida paradise, so it was only natural that we captured their engagement session in Boca Grande doing all their favorite things: bike riding around the island, playing backgammon at the Gasparilla Inn, taking a cruise on Bridget’s boat, and watching sunset together on the beach. This session was too good not to blog- scroll below to see some of our favorite images, and read a little more about this couple and their story.\n\nHow did you two meet?\n\n“Bridget's family has been coming down to Boca Grande since 2005, and Will's family bought a home there in 2015. We ran into each other on Christmas Eve in 2015 at The Pink Elephant, and Bridget decided to set up the parents because she thought they'd make good friends. Bridget invited the Morrison family over for a boat ride (or what she calls the \"parent date\") and Will quickly developed a crush. Flash forward to Christmas 2016, where we spent more time together in Boca Grande. After flirting at the Boca Bande Bash (a party that a group of families organized), we shared our first kiss at midnight on New Year's Eve at Miller's Dockside. And the rest.........is history.”\n\nTell us about the proposal!\n\n“Will proposed on the first night of summer in 2020 in Cotuit, MA (where Bridget's family spends their summer). Will was \"going up to New Hampshire\" to golf with his dad for Father's Day, when in reality he picked out the ring in Boston. He then picked up Bridget's older sister, Lizzie, from the airport (she had just flown in from San Francisco) and drove back to Cotuit. We grabbed a drink and went out to the patio overlooking Cotuit Bay, and Will got down on one knee and popped the question. Bridget (obviously) said yes, and then they celebrated with Bridget's family afterwards! “\n\nBright Indoor Studio\n\nAn indoor studio is a new addition for this year! We’re renting the space for the afternoon to add some variety- especially for those of you who have been with us for many years! Because it’s new we don’t have a ton of photos to show you the exact space, but picture all white, lots of light and a few neutral pieces of furniture to do some seated shots as well as standing combos. I love this idea as well because it’ll look great on just about any Christmas card design, and if it’s a rainy day it won’t mean a re-schedule. It’s super conveniently located in Ybor city.\n\nWe’ve heard it said that Florence, Italy is a city of love. After this Florence photoshoot, we couldn’t agree more!Though this is truly amazing inspiration for Florence engagement photos, Jill and Grady were actually having these photos taken on their Italian honeymoon! Jill works for the amazing Along Came Stephanie and happened to be in Italy the same time we were, so it was truly fate to work together on this beautiful session. We felt so inspired by the architecture, the weather, and the sights around the city- it was a place unlike any we’d ever been... We couldn't help but photograph this session 100% on film!It would be such a unique destination engagement location for those who like the hustle of a big city, but the feeling of old world architecture and history! This sweet historical town was definitely crowded on a Saturday, but keep on scrolling to see the magic that can happen, even in a bustling city like Florence."
