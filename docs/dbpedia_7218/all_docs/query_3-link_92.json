Why? Because it has an adults-only resort, has beautiful resort areas on the sunny and dry side of the island, has a mix of everything you could want, and offers an easy day trip to another island.\n\nThe best resorts in the sunniest spots.Chances are, you’ll stay in Wailea or Ka’anapali and these two spots on the island also come with the most sun and the best resort and condo accommodations.\n\nThe only adults-only hotel. The kids are great. But on your honeymoon, you may want the quiet tranquility that comes with a kid-free vacation. Because Hawaii is so family-friendly, this can be hard to find. But you have a luxury adults-only hotel on Maui.\n\nIt has a mix of everything. Whatever you’re looking for, you’ll find it on Maui. The island has some of the best resorts, a relaxed night scene that’s not too quiet, and memorable outdoor adventures like the Road to Hana and Haleakala.\n\nLanai is just a boat ride away.

Maui has no shortage of hotels and you can find something in nearly any price range. These are some of our favorite hotels on the island.\n\nAdults-Only: Hotel Wailea\n\nEveryone loves Hawaii, including families. And while Hawaii is extremely family-friendly, when you’re on a romantic honeymoon you likely don’t want to have enthusiastic kids ruining your relaxing vibe. If that sounds like you, welcome to Hotel Wailea. This adults-only resort is luxurious and is perfect for a romantic honeymoon.\n\nLuxury: The Four Seasons, The Andaz, and Montage Kapalua Bay\n\nMaui has no shortage of luxury resorts, but these three are extra special honeymoon spots:\n\nThe Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea: Every Four Seasons resort is stunning, but this one takes the cake. Located along Wailea beach, it has everything you could hope for: an adults-only pool, amenities like free snorkel rentals and canoe experiences, and exceptional service.\n\nAndaz: Also located in Wailea, the Andaz is a modern and sleek hotel with plenty of secluded areas that make the resort feel less crowded. They have an adults-only pool, a fantastic breakfast buffet, and a shuttle service to the restaurant area in Wailea.\n\nMontage Kapalua Bay: On West Maui just north of Lahaina is Kapalua Bay, one of the best snorkeling spots on the island. This sprawling resort offers one to four-bedroom suites, rather than standard hotel rooms. The sunsets are spectacular, the service is top-notch, and you feel like you have space to roam up here. Plus horseback riding, guided hikes, a world-class golf course, and romantic dining at Kapalua Cliff House make this a perfect honeymoon spot.\n\nAffordable Honeymoon Hotels: Kohea Kai Maui or Ka’anapali Beach Hotel\n\nKohea Kai Maui: Just north of the resorts in Wailea you’ll find Kohea Kai. It’s a well-priced hotel with direct beach access and free breakfast served daily. The location makes it easy to explore the island and the lush grounds make evening strolls feel magical.\n\nKa’anapali Beach Hotel: This hotel is nestled between two hotels that are much more expensive, so you know the location is great. Located right on Ka’anapali Beach and close to Black Rock, this hotel has sprawling grounds and friendly staff.\n\nCharming Island Inns: Paia Inn and Hana-Maui Resort\n\nIf you want to spend your honeymoon on Maui away from the crowds, these are the two best spots.\n\nPaia Inn: Located in the charming surf town of Paia, this inn features tropical and Asian-inspired rooms.

This hotel features 75 private bungalows on 72-acres. The experience is truly immersive and you can spend time exploring the remote area, luxuriating in the spa, and experiencing the quiet side of Maui.\n\nWhat to Do on a Maui Honeymoon\n\nOnce you’ve settled where to stay, it’s on to what to do for your Maui Honeymoon. One of the reasons we picked Maui as the best island for a honeymoon is there is just so much to do. While you will likely spend a lot of time sleeping, relaxing, and recovering from the wedding, you may also want to get out and explore all the island has to offer.\n\nSome of the most popular (and most spectacular) things to do on Maui include:\n\nDriving the Road to Hana\n\nVisiting Haleakala for sunrise or sunset\n\nSnorkeling with tropical fish and turtles (read: The Best Hawaiian Island for Snorkeling (with snorkel spots)\n\nWhale watching between mid-December and late March\n\nExploring upcountry Maui, including MauiWine, Makawao Town, the Ali’i Kula lavender farm, and Surfing Goat Dairy – 15 Things to Do in Upcountry Maui\n\nSnorkeling the 450-acre Olowalu reef on a kayak tour\n\nTaking a day trip to Lanai\n\nSpending an evening at Old Lahaina Luau or Feast at Lele (read: which luau is right for you)\n\nSome of our favorite, quiet beaches on Maui that are perfect for a honeymoon include:\n\nKua’u cove north of Paia Town (and an excellent spot to view turtles)\n\nHo’okipa Beach Park north of Paia Town\n\nKahekili (Airport) Beach Park in Ka’anapali (great snorkeling and significantly less crowded than Ka’anapali beach)\n\nKapalua Bay\n\nSecret Beach, located close to Makena Beach\n\nMaluaka Beach in Wailea\n\nWant to climb a mountain?

Neither can we. Check out the best Maui waterfalls\n\nWhen to Consider Other Islands for Your Honeymoon:\n\nWe admit that Maui might not be the dream destination for everyone. If you’re not sold on Maui, there are other islands you should consider.\n\nWe have the best things to do in Hawaii for your honeymoon across the state.\n\nKauai: Best for the Most Secluded Honeymoon\n\nWhile Maui is the overall winner when it comes to a Hawaiian honeymoon, it doesn’t necessarily win in every single situation. Kauai is the most romantic island for your honeymoon as it’s the most secluded and quiet island. It’s a close competition so we’ve compared Maui vs Kauai for honeymooners.\n\nHead to the Garden Isle for secluded, untouched, Hawaiian wilderness, tropical jungles, and great hiking.\n\nWhile you’re there, set sail on a romantic Na Pali Coast sunset cruise and enjoy the stunning scenery. Tour Waimea Canyon State Park, aptly nicknamed the Grand Canyon of the Pacific. And enjoy the beach at Hanalei Bay.\n\nDrawbacks to consider before planning your Kauai honeymoon:\n\nThe island is called the Garden Isle for a reason. Kauai is the wettest island, so depending on when and where you go, you run the risk of getting some rain.\n\nIn fact, unlike Maui where the nicest resorts are on the sunniest side of the island, one main resort area on Kauai (Princeville) is on the north shore of the island, where you’ll get windward rain and big surf during the winter. This makes this a less than ideal spot for snorkeling and swimming during the winter.\n\nWhile the north shore will give you more seclusion, it’s not the only option. You can head to the drier south side of the island near the ever popular Poipu Beach. Here you can find safer winter beaches and less rain.\n\nWhether you opt for tropical paradise, or you want to stay on the sunny south shore we have some suggestions on where to stay:\n\nOne Hotel Hanalei Bay: a luxury spot on a secluded cove. It’s close to charming Hanalei town with it’s picture-perfect Hanalei Bay.\n\nThe Palmwood: This secluded 5-acre estate hosts a B&B in the Moloa’a hills of the north shore Kauai.\n\nGrand Hyatt Kauai: Located on the sunny side of the island in Poipu at the end of the resort strip, this hotel feels less crowded compared to the rest of Poipu.\n\nKoloa Landing Resort at Poipu: Located on the sunny South Shore of Kauai, this Marriott Autograph Collection property is the nicest hotel on the South Shore.\n\nDive into more Kauai Planning Resources:\n\n– Our Kauai Travel Guide will give you the lay of the land and answer common questions\n\n– Discover incredible things to do on Kauai and more Kauai hotels for couples.\n\n– Explore the Napali Coast on a boat tour or the best Kauai waterfalls.\n\nBig Island of Hawai’i: Best for an Adventurous Honeymoon\n\nIf lounging around a resort isn’t your thing, the Big Island of Hawai’i might be your best bet. With 10-climate zones, the island has a lot to explore. Stay on the Kailua-Kona side (for the sun) and rent a car to explore the island.\n\nSee the desserts on the Kohala Coast, a rainforest in Hilo, and the snow-capped mountains of Mauna Kea volcano. Take a tour of the observatories, go stargazing, swim in waterfalls, snorkel with manta rays, and hike through Volcanoes National Park.\n\nPlan one perfect day in Hilo with our itinerary.\n\nNote: Kilauea volcano is not currently erupting but always check for updates here.\n\nIf that sounds like your dream honeymoon, we suggest checking out one of these resorts for your stay:\n\nFour Seasons Resort Hualalai: enjoy hula classes, lei making, picture-perfect lawns, six swimming pools, and a self-contained five-star resort.\n\nHolualoa Inn: Nestled in the hills above Kailua Kona is this B&B, spread out over a sprawling 30 acres.\n\nMauna Kea Beach Hotel: Located along Kauna‘oa Bay on the Kohala coast, this five-star resort has plenty of activities on-site, including tennis courts and a golf course.\n\nDive into more Big Island Planning Resources:\n\n– Our Big Island Travel Guide will give you the lay of the land and answer common questions\n\n– Discover incredible things to do on the Big Island and the best luxury hotels on the Big Island\n\n– Explore the Manta Ray night snorkel tours in Kona or the best Kauai waterfalls.\n\nOahu: Best for a Cosmopolitan Honeymoon\n\nIf a quiet island isn’t quite your style, head to Oahu. Not only will you have gorgeous white sand beaches and stunning mountains, but you’ll also have the big city feel and nightlife you won’t find on any other island. Check out our five day Oahu itinerary to visit all of the best spots.\n\nIf you’re looking for the best romantic hotels, head to:\n\nThe Royal Hawaiian: This iconic hotel is smack-dab in the middle of Waikiki Beach, so you’re certain to be in the center of it all.

Horseback riding, snorkeling, golf, excellent food, and picturesque sunsets.\n\nFour Seasons at Ko Olina: A spectacular hotel on the leeward side of Oahu, you’ll find fewer crowds than in Honolulu and more reliable weather than the North Shore of Oahu. Plus, the Four Seasons service is hard to beat.
