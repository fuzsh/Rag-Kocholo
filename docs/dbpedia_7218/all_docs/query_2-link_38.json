        "text": "So, what is love-bombing?\n\nThere’s a difference between love-bombing and the initial excitement/honeymoon phase of a relationship. Love-bombing happens very quickly, and it’s super intense. It can feel incredibly overwhelming.\n\nWithin the first week or two, they’ll throw excessive compliments at you and promise awesome things. They may even be giving you lavish gifts like huge bouquets, jewellery, and planning holidays.\n\nLet’s break love-bombing tactics into six points:\n\nExtravagant gifts\n\nYou’ve been speaking for three weeks, and they’ve bombarded you with bouquets and booked plane tickets for a week-long holiday in Spain? Uh-oh! These gifts don’t come from the goodness of their heart; they want you to feel like you owe them. If you’re indebted to them, you’re easier to manipulate.\n\n“I took you on holiday, and you don’t even have the decency to message me back immediately?”\n\n“I bought you a diamond necklace, and you won’t cancel on your friend you haven’t seen for three years? You’re so selfish.”\n\nThe worst part? You didn’t even want these gifts, and now they’re a bargaining chip.\n\nThey’re constantly in contact with you\n\nWhile constant texting can feel nice, especially if you’re lonely, it may feel smothering and one-sided. If you ask for space and they ignore your boundary and manipulate you, get out. Boundary violators will ignore pretty much any “no” and attempt to coerce you into whatever they want through guilt trips or force. This study demonstrated how narcissists are more likely to sexually coerce their partners. (Discretion is advised if you have prior trauma.)\n\nBeing in constant contact also makes it really easy for them to use this as a manipulation tactic. You said something they didn’t like? They’ll ignore you for a few hours or a day to let your self-doubt set in. “Shit, maybe I shouldn’t have said that? What if they don’t like me anymore?” Maybe you’ll start changing the subject, apologising, or trying to get their attention in other ways. The silent treatment is a powerful weapon at their disposal.\n\nExcessive compliments\n\nAgain, it’s lovely to hear that you’re a great, attractive person. But love-bombing takes it a step further. You’re the best person they’ve ever known. You’re perfect! They love everything about you.\n\nThey’re putting you on a pedestal. It isn’t a nice place to be. How can you possibly live up to someone’s initial expectations of you 24/7? How exhausting would it be to try and be perfect forever? What even is perfect?\n\nWe’re soulmates\n\nThis is a classic. They try to convince you that destiny brought you together. You’re twin flames, soulmates, whatever you want to call it. You’ve been on one date, and they say that you must be twin flames. You know them better than anyone.\n\nYour partner of ten years calling you soulmates is really sweet.\n\nYour love interest deciding you’re made for each other after one date? Nope. Out you get!\n\nCommitment\n\nWhile some people have commitment issues, love-bombers are the opposite. They’ll be talking about marriage or moving in far too quickly. You’ll be caught off-guard, and it might feel completely inappropriate, especially after two weeks. You can’t know you want to marry someone and spend the rest of your life with them after only a fortnight, so this is a clear manipulation tactic.\n\n“Hey, my lease is ending next month; maybe we should move in together?”\n\nFine after two years, not after two weeks!\n\nMe, me, me!\n\nThey’ll want your undivided attention. This comes with constant messaging, calling, whatever. They might act put out and be jealous when you talk about spending time with other people. It can come across as super needy as well.\n\nHere’s another place where they may not respect your boundaries or commitments. You might have plans with your best friend, but they’ll offer a much more appealing, luxurious date to try and turn your head. This plays into yet another abusive tactic, isolation. (But that’s for another day.)\n\nHopefully, your gut instinct has noticed that these behaviours are pretty weird and intense, even with all the “love.” Listen to that gut feeling.\n\nThey’ll keep the love-bombing phase up for 6–12 weeks before things start to change. Some stop even sooner than that. If they manage to hook you into living with them or committing in some way after a month, the “love” is pretty much guaranteed to end there and then. After this, things get dangerous.\n\nOther red flags to look out for\n\nOf course, love-bombing in isolation could just be a very intense person. But if you’re having doubts about this behaviour, look out for these things:\n\nDevaluing and “jokes”\n\nThe stage after love-bombing in narcissistic abuse is devaluation. Even in the love-bombing phase, they may say harsh things that take you aback. Hearing something offensive can be very jarring when you’re used to sweet compliments. Of course, they’ll be a “joke” or “just teasing”. What’s commonly known as “negging” is something to look out for.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nBackhanded compliments: “Great job completing your degree! Shame it’s in a useless field.”\n\n“Constructive” criticism: “I don’t wanna ruin your day, but that dress makes you look fat.”\n\nOne-upping: “Yeah, it’s great you did that, but I did it way faster.”\n\nComparison: “If only you looked as good as your best friend.”\n\nInsults posed as questions: “Wow, you’re not really going to eat all of that, are you?”\n\nIf you respond (like anyone would) with shock, upset, or anger, they’ll say you’re overreacting, too sensitive, and call it a joke. This is an element of gaslighting.\n\nThe devaluation phase is painful. They replace the beautiful compliments with finding your faults. Their mask has well and truly slipped. Maybe they’re not even a nice person at all!\n\nBut your brain is hooked on the love-bombing. “What did I do wrong? How can I get that intense, loving phase back?” You can’t: it was never really them, just a great facade they used to draw you in. You’re not really in control here. If you start voicing your discontent and try to leave, they might turn the charm back on again. Those flowers might start turning up once more. But as soon as you’re back and fully invested, the mask slips once more.\n\nThe love-bombing phase is never permanent. They replace it with hatred and serious damage to your self-esteem. They’ll happily cycle back and forth through these two phases, but it becomes more dangerous each time. Trauma bonding is real and terrifying. It’s best not to let it reach this stage. Get out while it’s still seemingly okay and you have enough self-respect to protect yourself from constant belittling and your bank account from therapy bills. Trust me, I know about therapy bills.\n\nAsking you lots of deep questions about yourself\n\nOf course, this isn’t a huge issue on its own as many people love getting to know each other this way. But when combined with love-bombing, it can be a good indicator that something isn’t quite right.\n\nWhen they show an interest in deeper stuff, you might think, “Wow, they’re so into me!” Perhaps they’re actually looking for your insecurities. Here’s a great example:\n\nIf you’re texting, and you reveal something about yourself that’s vulnerable and something they consider a weakness, they’ll capitalise on that. Whether that’s asking more probing questions to find out more or ignoring you for a little while to make you question yourself, this is another flag to look out for.\n\nNarcissists love self-doubt. It’s how they get you to stick around. “Oh, my best friend said that they don’t seem like a nice person, and they’re getting weird vibes. I had a gut feeling too, but they’re so nice, I’m gonna just ignore it!”\n\nIt might be fleeting, but don’t ignore that gut feeling. It exists to protect you.\n\nMirroring\n\nMirroring is a normal behaviour we use unconsciously. However, it’s also a narcissistic tactic where they pretend to love everything you love. It’s a great way to bond. You might think you have so much in common. Actually, they’re just using your hobbies and the things you love as a way to get in. They’ll start to mock the things you love in the devaluing phase.\n\n“Oh, you want to go to that gig? But that band’s shit. What? I never said I liked them. Don’t talk shit!”\n\nNarcissists typically lack any real identity, so taking on yours isn’t a struggle for them. They can’t empathise or get close to people without manipulation, so mirroring is a perfect strategy.\n\nPromising you the world\n\n“Future faking” is another classic element, and this comes into play over a whole relationship, not just the love-bombing phase. This is really where the romcom aspect kicks in. It might seem like they’re promising you a fairytale future! Well, that’s because it is a fairytale. It’s all BS to keep you hooked and keep getting what they need from you.\n\n“Oh, I can’t leave them because they promised we’d go to the Bahamas! Yeah, I know we still haven’t been yet, and there are no plans, but they said we would.”\n\nExamples include:\n\nAn amazing holiday in New York where they’ll propose to you at the top of the Empire State Building.\n\nYou’re going to name your first child or dog after your grandmothers! (Sorry, but Elizabeth Florence isn’t happening with this person.)\n\nThey’ve promised you an amazing new car in a year, but they can’t stop spending their money on frivolous stuff, and they’re deep in debt.\n\nNot taking responsibility or apologising\n\nThis is quite a general red flag (and one that I pay so much attention to).\n\nSay they’re late for your date because they didn’t leave on time. They’ll create many excuses to avoid saying, “Sorry, I left too late to get here on time. I’ll keep a better eye on the clock next time!” They will not take responsibility.\n\nOne of the first Google autofill results for “Why don’t narcissists…” is “apologise”! It’s just not something they can do. They prefer to blame everyone else than deal with the “shame” of their shortcomings. Everyone makes mistakes, but they don’t want anyone to see them as less than perfect. Image is so important to them, so they’ll blame everything and everyone but themselves.\n\nEmotionally healthy people want to patch up an issue as soon as possible, but narcissists don’t care. They have to stay in control, and if that’s at your expense, even better. They’re heavily emotionally stunted. You’re not getting an apology unless it benefits them.\n\nWhat does your gut say?\n\nAre your instincts screaming at you that something is at least a little bit fishy here? Even if you have the slightest concern, listen to it. Many victims of narcissistic abuse have ignored that gut feeling. Don’t be one of them. If it feels off, it most likely is. You don’t want to be questioning their every move or second-guessing your concerns.\n\nHow to counter love-bombing\n\nI’d simply say “get out!” but I know most people prefer to give others a chance (second chances are dangerous, but we’ll leave that for now). So try these strategies to see if you’re dealing with a toxic person/narcissist or someone who’s just really frigging intense.\n\nBoundaries\n\nA great way to deal with love-bombing is to set boundaries. Even just saying “this is moving too quickly for me” can give you a great insight into the person. Do they accept your comment with grace and scale back their affections? Do they respect your boundary?\n\nAnother example: they’re trying to set up a date that’s a little too romantic, and you really want to scale it back without offending them. (Being too nice is probably something that comes naturally to you!) “Sorry, I’m busy that day, can we grab a coffee on Wednesday instead?” Do they accept you have the right to say no to their ideas? Or do they react with anger, guilt trips, or throw the silent treatment at you?\n\nBe very wary of someone who can’t take a no. If they try and coerce you into agreeing or ignoring your boundaries, get out. These people are dangerous and don’t respect you.\n\nDon’t accept expensive gifts/holidays\n\nA major love-bombing tactic is gifting. This looks beautiful on the surface, but if you’re a few weeks into talking to someone and they’re trying to give you an overly expensive/personal gift or whisk you away to someone romantic, that is a red flag! Why? Because they’re trying to gain the upper hand. If they buy you a beautiful necklace in week two, you can be sure they’ll hold it over your head in a disagreement. You say no to sex one day? “I can’t believe you’d reject me like this after I bought you that expensive diamond necklace! You owe me!”\n\nIf you ever bring up the fact they forgot your birthday or anniversary, they’ll bring up a random romantic gift they gave you years ago.\n\n“After all I’ve done for you!” is a disgustingly common manipulative phrase.\n\nStay grounded\n\nIf you’ve got low self-esteem and someone comes along and starts telling you how beautiful and amazing you are, you’re ripe for manipulation. Taking a step back and looking at the full picture, not just the compliments and gifts, can help you see red flags you might have ignored otherwise.\n\nThings to look out for:\n\nIs this moving too fast for you?\n\nAre they pushing your boundaries? Do they respect “no”?\n\nHave they slipped in an insult here and there under the guise of teasing?\n\nDo you like them, or do you just like what they say and do?\n\nDo they genuinely apologise, or do they guilt trip you?\n\nHave you been in an abusive relationship before? Or did you have a horrible upbringing? You’re more likely to continue to get into abusive relationships as your “normal” is warped.\n\nTalk to trusted people\n\nPart of staying grounded is talking to the people you trust and love. They can hopefully give you an unbiased insight into the person, and it’s even better if they’ve dealt with a manipulative person before and recognised it. They’ll be able to smell these tactics a mile off. (I call it my narc-dar)\n\nIf you can afford it, speaking to a therapist/counsellor is also a great idea. They can give you their unbiased view on what’s happening and work on any underlying issues you have, such as low-self esteem or codependency.\n\nAbusers try to isolate their victims from family and friends because they don’t want them to have a support network or see what’s actually happening beneath that Instagram Valencia veneer. Keep talking to people you love. They are (usually) your biggest weapon against narcissistic abuse. Self-respect is the other. Love yourself like you love your best friend."
