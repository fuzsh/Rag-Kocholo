        "text": "‘The House of Rothschild’\n\nThe Nazis liked this 1934 20th Century Fox production about the rise of the Jewish family of European bankers so much — they believed it supported their racist stereotypes of Jews — that they pirated a clip for a 1940 propaganda film.\n\nThe Nazis liked this 1934 20th Century Fox production about the rise of the Jewish family of European bankers so much — they believed it supported their racist stereotypes of Jews — that they pirated a clip for a 1940 propaganda film.\n\n‘The Lives of a Bengal Lancer’\n\nGary Cooper's 1935 film was more popular than Triumph of the Will. The Nazis thought it was a tendenzfilm (a movie that exhibited good National Socialist values) for both the sacrificial leadership of Cooper's character (not unlike Hitler, they believed) and the way his subordinates were ready to sacrifice their lives for him in return. Here's an example of a scene they liked.\n\nDarryl F. Zanuck\n\nAfter isolationists claimed Hollywood made movies designed to lead the U.S. into war, Congress held hearings in 1941. Zanuck gave a rousing speech during his testimony claiming that one of the first things Hitler did was throw out American studios after taking power in 1933, despite the fact his company did business in the country until 1940."
