        "text": "Whether you’ve been married for 60 years or six months, you and your spouse should be feeding your marriage with the word. Studying Bible verses about marriage and watching inspirational movies about marriage are two ways to enrich your marriage and is something you can do with your significant other.\n\nToday, nearly one in five new marriages is between a Christian and a non-religious partner. This kind of “unequally yoked” marriage can lead to arguments over many things including priorities, values, and attitudes. There are also questions of whether to raise the children as Christian or atheist, whether to allow the religious spouse to donate to their church, and whether religion should be a topic discussed in the home.\n\nWhile each relationship has its own unique challenges, Lee Strobel, the author of “The Case for Christ,\" says there are a few marriage tips that can really help those who are unequally yoked to bring peace back into their marriage.\n\nThe first step is to make sure your spouse still knows that they are the most important person in your life. It’s also important to focus on the qualities that you love about your spouse rather than focusing on their unbelief. Be sure to always stick to your Christian values while dealing with topics of potential conflict. And finally, when teaching religion to your children don’t turn them against your spouse. Instead, teach them mutual respect for both parents.\n\nREAD ALSO: 29 Bible Verses About Wives, Love and Marriage\n\n5 Bible Verses On Marriage\n\nBefore we explore movies about marriage, let’s dive into these Bible verses about marriage -- scriptures that can help you learn and grow as a couple:\n\n“Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.\" -- Hebrews 13:4 (NIV)\n\n“Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor\" -- Ecclesiastes 4:9 (NIV)\n\n“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her\" -- Ephesians 5:25 (NIV)\n\n“However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.” -- Ephesians 5:33 (NIV)\n\n“Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.
