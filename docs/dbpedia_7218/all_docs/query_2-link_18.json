        "text": "Wedding videos are great for capturing authentic moments with guests, saving your favorite memories, sharing your ceremony with distant loved ones, and much more. These 29 wedding video ideas are among the most inspiring and creative you’ll find, covering a wide range of budgets, types, and styles. So whether you want wedding video ideas for you and your partner to watch after the big day, ideas for wedding videos to be shown during the reception, or even ideas to be shared with guests before the actual wedding, this post has something for everyone!\n\nExplore 29 must-see wedding video ideas:\n\nThe best wedding video ideas combine filming style with unique moments and perspectives. Whether you plan on hiring a videographer or making your wedding video yourself, use one or more of the following ideas to capture your day the way you and your partner want to remember it.\n\n1. Create a wedding trailer.\n\nUse dialogue, music, and various clips throughout the day to create a story. Order the clips chronologically, but look for moments within sections (like the ceremony or the photo session after) that capture the emotions you felt during that period. Add music that emphasizes those feelings and include dialogue through voiceover if you’d like to add commentary, or through natural ceremony moments like the “I dos.”\n\n2. Make a social media collage.\n\nUse your wedding hashtag to identify videos of your ceremony and reception taken by your guests. Look for their videos on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Save and edit their videos in the order of events for the day. Use an app such as Animoto to add finishing touches like music.\n\n3. Interview the exes.\n\nThis only works if you’re all on good terms and they’re already invited to the wedding, but a good-natured participant can really add some fun to the wedding video if you choose to include them. Ask them what it was like to date each other and what advice they would give to your future spouse. This could also be a hilarious option to show to your guests during the reception.\n\n4. Make it funny.\n\nPick out your favorite moments from your wedding day and create a video around that. For example, we’ve heard of a bride who asked that all her brother’s “um’s” and “uh’s” during his reception speech be cut into one hilarious mega clip for her to torture him with. So the sky really is the limit.\n\n5. Be sentimental by honoring loved ones.\n\nHonor those you’ve lost by including clips of them at their own weddings alongside similar ones of yours. For example, if you have a clip of them making a silly face while getting ready for their big day, mimic that shot while you’re getting ready, too. If you don’t have their videos available, then add photos of them to your video slideshow.\n\n6. Focus on the reception.\n\nIf you’ve chosen to elope, a reception wedding video is a great way to capture the fun with all your friends and family. Pro tip: Capturing audio at a reception is challenging because of the music and conversations going on in the background, so make sure you or your videographer has a lavalier microphone to capture the moment without having to stop the party.\n\n7. Highlight the ceremony.\n\nIf you choose to focus your wedding video on the ceremony, you’ll want to set up at least three camera angles: Down the aisle cam, groom cam, and bride cam. Editing these points of view together will help you capture every moment. And if you have a professional videographer, they’ll help set up and run these angles, plus capture more candid moments on a handheld for those small-yet-special moments, like your favorite aunt turning in her chair to watch you walk down the aisle.\n\n8. Creatively save the date.\n\nReenact your proposal, add title cards that tell the story of your journey as a couple, or even hire an animator to create a beautiful cartoon version of the video like the unique storybook example below. Make sure you at least include large and legible text that clearly states your names, the wedding venue address, and the ceremony date and time. Cover all your bases by adding this information to the video description box if it’s uploaded to YouTube or Vimeo.\n\n9. Capture the proposal.\n\nThere are two options for every proposal wedding video. You can either film the surprise by setting up cameras ahead of time and/or asking invited observers to assist using their own smartphone cameras. Or you can reenact the moment with enhancements that make it look extra beautiful on film. For example, filming at that same location during sunset hours will help you capture a magical glow, plus some gorgeous B roll footage of the sun going down.\n\n10. Introduce the wedding party.\n\nGet the gang involved by asking them to introduce themselves, say what their role is in the wedding party, and explain how they know the bride or groom. They can also add a line or two of advice they would give about marriage and some well wishes. This is another option that you can have completed before the big day.\n\n11. Use mixed media.\n\nA mixed media wedding video uses a combination of different filming styles and cameras to capture a truly unique feeling that can reflect the way you want to remember your special day. For example, if your goal for the wedding video is to highlight your most important family members, you can combine interviews of them with getting-ready footage, adding their loving messages in voice-over for some poignant moments.\n\n12. Do a same-day edit.\n\nSame-day edits are wedding getting-ready and/or ceremony videos that are edited and shared during the reception. It’s a beautiful keepsake that doubles as entertainment for your guests. Make sure you really trust whoever you hire or ask to do this edit since their first draft will also be their last and you’ll be too busy to give them notes on it before it’s shown.\n\n13. Try stop-motion.\n\nStop-motion is a whimsical film technique that stops filming, moves a person or object within the shot, then begins filming again. In the amazing example shown below, the videographer chose to use stop-motion on items such as the bridal party’s shoes, the glassware, and the couple cutting cake.\n\n14. Turn it into a music video.\n\nRecreate your favorite music video or give your own unique spin on a song you absolutely love. One important thing to know: Copyright laws might prevent you from sharing this on social media and YouTube.\n\n15. Tell your love story through interviews.\n\nYou and your partner can talk separately about the night you met, your first kiss, and the first time you said you love each other. The differences between your two stories may be heartfelt or hilarious depending on the outcome. You can also get the perspective of your family members and wedding party too if they were an integral part of your union.\n\n16. Attach a GoPro to your pet.\n\nHave your dog be a ring bearer and capture the looming faces of your loved ones laughing and cheering with delight as he or she trots down the aisle. If you use GoPro, you’ll need their dog-specific harness. Also be sure to practice filming during the rehearsal so your pet can get used to the experience of wearing the gear with a lot of people around.\n\n17. Do a film parody.\n\nMake a mini version of your favorite movie. If you’re not interested in learning lines, you can always recreate a memorable scene such as The Notebook film’s kissing in the rain moment. If it’s a dry day outside, have friends dump water bottles over your heads so it’s visible in the shot for a hilarious take on the iconic moment.\n\n18. Lip sync with your wedding party and guests.\n\nThe below example of a cute wedding video shows scenes from the ceremony intercut with their bridal party joyfully dancing and lip syncing to a Justin Timberlake song.\n\n19. Host a video booth.\n\nAssign a camera operator to set up and run a camera in front of two seats in a quiet spot of the wedding venue. Give them prompts to answer or invite them to use the video as a digital signature book.\n\n20. Get the kids involved.\n\nKids say (and film) the darndest things so, with permission from their parents, have them use a smartphone to capture moments they love about the wedding. You can even create a video scavenger hunt to entertain them with items like “best dance move” and “funniest bridal party member” on their list.\n\n21. Send video thank-you notes.\n\nFilm 10-second videos thanking each guest for their time and gift. Add special effects, music, and text to make it extra special. TikTok is a great platform for short-form videos like these because it offers plenty of creative editing options and allows you to easily send your creations to family and friends who don’t have the app.\n\n22. Share your honeymoon trip.\n\nFilm your partner dozing off by the pool, your first dinner together, and any funny moments you may share while you’re out adventuring.\n\n23. Film in a cinematic style.\n\nCinematic wedding videos are a little more elaborate than your average wedding video because they’re more like an artistic short film rather than a compilation of the day’s best moments. As professional wedding cinematographers White in Revery discuss in their vlog on filming cinematic weddings, they often go out of their way the days or hours before the wedding to create Hollywood-like scenes to elevate the piece. Natural landscapes such as beaches or forests look pleasantly dramatic, as do candles, hanging lights, and paper lanterns.\n\n24. Film the beginning and end of the wedding day.\n\nYou and your partner can capture your first moments getting up and out of bed separately from each other in a vlog style. Then, once everyone has gone home and you’re on your way back to your lodging, you can take a video together reflecting on how the day started versus how it ended.\n\n25. Infuse your culture.\n\nFor example, if you are of Russian descent, add a beautiful wedding tune with Russian lyrics to your video. Or, if you observe a particular religion, make a highlight reel that focuses on those specific traditions.\n\n26. Do a reactions-only cut.\n\nYour parents’ first glimpse of you in your dress or outfit. Your friends listening to the speeches. Your bridal party laughing as you get ready together. All of these small moments highlight your connection to your loved ones, and including these clips will add their experience of the day to the video in addition to your own.\n\n27. Show one-second clips.\n\nCapture bite-size moments like the knife cutting the cake, the kiss, and the first dance into one fun, social media-friendly micro trailer.\n\n28. Use your wedding vows as a voiceover.\n\nRecord these separately or, if you plan to use a microphone during the ceremony, capture them in real time. Then, add your footage together, cut the original sound, layer in the music, and let your vows poetically narrate the day.\n\n29. Do a group dance.\n\nIf your wedding party and/or guests are up for a little rehearsal, then you’ll be able to incorporate a short choreographed routine for your wedding video. Or, if you’re keen to include dancing but don’t want to ask your guests to prepare ahead of time, consider implementing dances like the “Cha Cha Slide.”\n\nHow much does a wedding video cost?\n\nA professional photographer may charge as little as $300 for a very basic wedding video package or as much as $6,000+ for all the bells and whistles. DIY versions will vary, but your biggest expense will be what camera you shoot on (you can buy, borrow, or rent) and how long it takes for you to edit it (if you’re not tech savvy it might save you some headache to outsource this part to a professional). If you choose to borrow a camera, ask a friend to operate it, and do all of the video editing yourself, you could hypothetically DIY your entire wedding video for free.\n\nPut these wedding video ideas to good use!\n\nIf you’re not confident in your own skills as a video director, producer, and editor, there are plenty of wedding videography packages to choose from. Before you shop around, make sure you have some wedding video ideas — like the ones above! — in mind so you can capture the essence of your wedding exactly as you want to remember it."
