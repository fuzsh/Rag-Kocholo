        "text": "I'll say it a million times but Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray are one of the best on screen duos, they just work really well together. If they are a couple or even if they are fighting they just mesh well together.\n\nThis is also the case for this film. I enjoy this one a lot, it's really entertaining with some laughs and even though the kids in this film start out really annoying it ends on a good note!\n\nWhat a beautiful hidden gem of a film this one turned out to be and with my one of favourite duos Claudette Colbert & Fred MacMuarry. They just work so beautifully together and when they are all romantic with one another itâ€™s just so magical. Once the kids are introduced though chaos definitely ensues and just makes it all the more fun to watch. I think the final twenty seconds were my favourite though seeing Fred carry Claudette up the stairs before a final kiss I swooned so hard. I even played it twice because it brought me such joy and it reminded me of why I adore classic films so much.\n\nAw.... Claudette Colbert & Fred MacMurray together again..... for the 7th and last time. The whole film is built-up by scenario gags and ends up feeling a bit ridiculous because of its structure. Especially since the laughs aren't that big. Yet, for me... it made me happy. Mainly because of the two, but also for the lighthearted adventures they were on."
