Now, under the dynamic management of designer Marie-Louise Sciò, the hotel has refined its service, become a Michelin-starred gourmet haven and added a spa without losing its insider cachet. The nearby town of Porto Ercole is a magnet for the Roman and Florentine yachtie set, but Il Pellicano takes its distance – standing in majestic natural seclusion amid stone pines and cypresses with breathtaking sunset views. The 50 rooms and suites are divided between the the Pompeii-red central building and the beautifully tended gardens. There's a small but well-run spa, a tennis court and its own heated seawater pool. Be sure to order a cocktail made by Italy’s best bartender.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 3,082\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nConsider it a dream project: an American lawyer falls in love with Tuscany, buys up most of a small village, and turns it into a rural idyll. His vision was spot on. While preserving the exterior façades, interior designer Ilaria Miani has brought a sense of light and modernity without sacrificing the building’s authenticity. The terraced gardens are just as charming: a lap pool is bordered by lavender bushes and fig and olive trees. In addition to the amenities (spa, restaurant, gallery, bars), there are also many events planned seasonally—a lecture by Wes Anderson before a film screening, say, or a classical concert in the village church—itineraries can also include wine tastings at local vineyards, guided tours of Etruscan ruins, and even a day in Florence. Go for room number 9 with a fireplace and stand alone bathtubs.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 850\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nMr & Mrs Smith\n\nThis noble Renaissance villa sits lordly in Italian gardens and vine-clad hills, overlooking a serene landscape that (legend has it) inspired Leonardo da Vinci. Many will know it as the romantic setting for Kenneth Branagh's film 'Much Ado about Nothing'. It was the 14th-century home of the Mona Lisa's ancestors and is one of the oldest wine estates in Chianti; even the villa walls have faded to a mellow Rosé. Facilities include two pools (edged with those dreamy views), tennis courts and a small spa with whirlpool tub and Turkish bath. There are hiking paths that wind through the estate's vineyards and woodland; complimentary bikes; cooking lessons and horse riding. The restaurant enjoys heavenly views from its terrace, and its farm-to-table policy means much of the produce comes from the surrounding organic estate. Opt for a room in the Casolese farmhouse, done up in a Scandi-Tuscan style.\n\nRead expert review\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\n• The best luxury hotels in Tuscany\n\nItalian Lakes\n\nLeading Milan-based designer Patricia Urquiola is behind the hotel’s sober architecture and contemporary interiors. The building was constructed using natural materials, including stone, wood and copper, and local artisans were called in to make the custom-designed furnishings. At the centre of the main garden is an infinity pool with gazebos and sun loungers, a small sandy beach can be found down by the lake shore, plus a spa with a hot tub which overlooks the lake. Guests can rent the hotel’s two all-wood Riva motorboats, with or without a driver, while the Vaporina del Lago water limousine shuttles guests around the lake. Floor-to-ceiling glass windows in the 30 suites ensure beautiful views, and waterfront terraces have cushioned chairs. The Michelin-starred restaurant serves Italian dishes with a contemporary touch.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 2,542\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nVilla Larios is secluded and private, spread out on a hillside more than 160ft above the lake, offering jaw-dropping vistas. From the lakeside road a lift descends to the main villa, which is flanked by a leafy terraced garden with infinity pool looking out over the water. From here a second lift goes down to the lakefront garden from where it’s possible to stroll into the tiny village of Pognana Lario – no tourists here, just the occasional resident strolling the front. The villa has a private jetty, and boat hire and water taxis can be organised. With only six suites, guests feel as if they have most of the place to themselves. The restaurant serves delicious, hearty homemade cooking inspired by Italy’s regions.\n\nRead expert review\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nThis exclusive hotel, set in eight-acre grounds on the western shore of Lake Garda, is located in a historic 19th-century villa which was once the home of Mussolini and his family during the Republic of Salò. Interiors have been lavishly restored and feature frescoed ceilings, Venetian mirrors and Art Nouveau lamps. The manicured gardens are home to olive, ancient oak and magnolia trees, and there’s a limonaia (tiered lemon garden) dating back to the 1800s. There’s also an outdoor heated swimming pool and a croquet green. With a staff ratio of 3:1, the service is outstanding. Tailor-made boat trips around the lake can be organised. Rooms in the main villa have original antiques and cream-coloured draperies; guesthouses are more contemporary. The two Michelin-starred restaurant serves exceptional Italian cuisine and fresh lake fish.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 957\n\nper night\n\n• The best Italian Lakes - and where to stay\n\nAmalfi Coast\n\nCarved into the sheer rock face like something out of a James Bond movie and hidden from prying eyes , il San Pietro lies a few bends in the road east of Positano. All around there is the deep, blue sea. Just about anything you could possibly wish for is on site, and for a zip up the coast, one of the hotel’s private boats will pick you up from the jetty. There is a bar with a spectacular terrace, a gourmet restaurant, fabulous terraced gardens and, on sea level, a private ‘beach’, a tennis court, spa and restaurant. The bedrooms and suites tumble down the cliff-side in a series of flower-bedecked terraces; each has its own private outside space, some of which are enormous. All have extraordinary sea vistas, some even from the bath.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 2,220\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nFrom its perch atop a sheer, rocky outcrop, just outside the quiet the village of Conca dei Marini and aloof from the day-trippers down on the coast, the Santa Rosa enjoys a magnificent location. Its creation is down to one woman, American Bianca Sharma, who bought the vast, clifftop building after spying it from a boat. She spared no expense in transforming the 17th-century monastery into a stylish and cocooning hotel, while fully respecting the building’s origins. As you would expect, there’s everything you are likely to need on site; fabulous terraced gardens with a heated infinity pool that seems suspended over the water; a huge spa (one of the biggest and best on the costiera); an outdoor gym with a view; shuttle bus service to and from Amalfi. The dining terrace – suspended high over the sea – is a supremely romantic spot for dinner. Expect superlative renditions of coastal cuisine.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 1,604\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nBuilt into the steep southwest-facing side of Positano, the hotel’s oxblood-coloured facade is high enough to command excellent sea views, while being within a 10-minute walk (down lots of steps) to the resort’s dark-sand beach. An eclectic collection of antique furniture and art helps the hotel retain its atmosphere of the private home it originally was, though over time it has conjoined with neighbouring houses to become a warren of rooms and public areas on several floors. A compact pool terrace has outdoor loungers and is shaded by lemon trees. Nearly all 58 rooms are unfussy, whitewashed with tiled floors, classical prints and highly-polished, antique furniture. The Michelin-starred La Sponda restaurant is about as romantic as a dining room can possibly be. Entirely lit by 400 candles it has creeper-clad walls, stiff white tablecloths and views over the twinkling lights and sea.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 1,395\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\n• The best luxury hotels on the Amalfi Coast\n\nSorrento\n\nA hotel in grand Italian style with a fresh, modern approach and a spectacular Vesuvius-facing location. Sorrento’s lidos, accessible via a lift, lie just below and a 10-minute walk down a narrow, cobbled lane brings you to the fishing village of Marina Grande. Inside, its cool marble hallways and dazzling white paintwork offset museum-worthy antique pieces, Murano chandeliers, modern art and photography and colourful, quirky ceramics. There’s a private bathing deck with sea access at the bottom of the cliff and a small pool with sun loungers on an upper terrace. Only two out of the 50 bedrooms miss out on sea views. The huge, sexy Suite Roccia is hewn out of solid tufa rock and features a hydrotherapy pool in the bedroom and the Suite Pompeiana comes with a vast bathroom and whirlpool tub looking out to sea.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 886\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nAs a 'get-away-from-it-all' location, this spot close to the tip of the Sorrentine Peninsula is perfect. The sweeping views that take in Capri, the wide curve of the Bay of Naples and the looming bulk of Vesuvius are extraordinary. On arrival, you may be forgiven for wondering why the place isn’t called 'Relais White' – but step out onto the terrace and get an eyeful of the deep blue sea that plays wraparound backdrop, and the name makes perfect sense. Wide terraces on different levels offer private corners for relaxing, while there’s an infinity pool at the top of the property, plus a small spa and a hot tub on a sea-facing terrace. Boats can be hired and if you want a day at Capitan (sic) Cook’s laid-back beach club, staff will arrange for you to be picked up in a tiny Piaggio van. All rooms have sea views and all but two have private gardens or large terraces. The Michelin-starred restaurant is one of the hotel’s highlights.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 421\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\n• The best hotels in Sorrento\n\nPuglia\n\nThe restoration of 16th-century Trapanà has remained faithful to the bones of the old masseria. The original taupe, tufo stone and arched ceilings are modernised through the use of glass walls, fresh flower displays, thick-pile colourful rugs, coffee-table books, snazzy Moroccan cushions and music blaring out across the main courtyard all day. Six walled gardens, verdant with cacti, ferns and more than 500 orange and lemon trees, are dotted with colourful hammocks, a fire pit and croquet lawn. The serene swimming pool is surrounded by large daybeds and shaded by plum trees – and there’s a pool phone should you require a cocktail. All rooms have arched ceilings and stone walls, which keep them cool in summer, though there are fireplaces and underfloor heating for autumnal nights. All but two have outdoor bathtubs. Expect a menu of the region’s deliciously simple cucina povera ('peasant cooking').\n\nRead expert review\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nConstructed entirely from the local tufa stone, you could be forgiven for thinking the imposing Borgo Egnazia has history. It doesn’t: it was built from scratch. Every detail is an ode to Puglia, from the artworks based on the symbols on trulli roofs to the waft of lemons in reception. The estate is divided into three: the stately La Corte, which opens out to two tiered swimming pools; the maze-like Il Borgo ('The Village', with a family pool, piazza and rows of duplex townhouses); and 30 outlying villas, each with a private pool. Escape for a Vair spa treatment, learn to make orrecchiette pasta or local pottery, play tennis, golf, take up windsurfing, kitesurfing, kayaking or just peg out at one of the resort’s two private beaches or three outdoor pools. The five restaurants put a strong emphasis on traditional local cooking.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 2,218\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\n• The best hotels in Puglia\n\nSicily\n\nThe hotel is set on its own private stretch of beach surrounded by lush gardens.

It’s halfway between Taormina and Catania, high up on the eastern skirts of Etna. Many guests go nowhere but spend their days lounging by the pool, a cool blue splash amidst citrus and olive groves. The 13 rooms in the main house and a series of outbuildings are stylish dens, some with wood-burning stoves, exposed lavastone walls and weathered ceiling beams (like the theatrical Amabile suite), others fresh and bright, with contemporary artworks playing off against Sicilian antiques. Rooms have no televisions or phones – a deliberate choice, as the experience is all about tuning into nature.

Sixty-one rooms and suites, housed across eight different ivy-covered houses, follow different styles, from rich country houses to fisherman-inspired suites. The vinotherapy spa (which uses products made with the waste from the vines) features 20 treatment rooms, an indoor spring-water pool, a whirlpool tub and a hammam.

Nowhere could be more convenient for bars, restaurants, boutiques and boat trips out to sea. The reception sets the royalty-chic tone straight away, with its delicate blue chinoiseries, deep-set sofas and a fireplace by which a ravishing cat purrs quietly before setting off for a scrap of fish from the kitchens. A swimming pool is open to guests in the hotel’s sister address, Villa Clarisse. Each of the rooms pays homage to a personality of the island’s history.

The fortress, in the honey-toned local marés sandstone, was dug into the cliff at the end of the 19th century and was transformed in 2010 into the sumptuous sanctuary it is today. As the name suggests, the coastline below Cap Rocat is rocky, which means clear water that is ideal for snorkelling. When you emerge, there will be a mojito waiting for you at a sunbed next to the rocks or by the saltwater infinity pool. Afterwards, head to the spa housed in a former limestone water deposit.

Stylishly smooth rather than full-on rustic, and on the smart side of the boho-ometer, Torralbenc is a masterclass in modern Mediterranean good taste. There is a 25-metre, unchlorinated outdoor pool and a Natura Bissé spa. There are 27 rooms distributed around the main house and several former stables or outhouses, all now transformed into light, airy spaces with beamed ceilings, chestnut furniture and sandstone floors.

The main areas are navigable via wide paths set in the natural red gravel native to the island; many are lined with prickly pear cacti that bear red fruit late in the season. Large terraces overlooking the countryside, sweeping fields of grass, and a warm beige colour scheme – punctuated only by the crisp turquoise of the pool – ties everything together. The Premier suites are spacious and quiet, with plenty of seating and relaxation space thanks to a large lounge and private terrace – some of which offer direct access to the Ibiza countryside.

A great weekend break spot, especially when twinned with their property in Barcelona. The group took over the former Hotel Quim, which originally opened in the 1950s, and the retro feel still remains, not least because the interior design choices respect the hotel’s heritage: the restaurant tables were created using original designs. Add to that plenty of hessian cushions, big palms, raffia seating and the group’s ubiquitous striped towels – here found on the beach beds – and you have a very stylish stay. It almost borders on feeling Californian or Hawaiian-esque – if it weren’t for the decidedly Balearic beats floating across the beach from the rooftop most evenings.

Fragrant gardens surround the two outdoor pools, which are lined with emerald tiles. One is 30-metres long with a childrens’ pool; a short stroll brings you to the more private adults-only 50-metre pool.

Suites get stunning views onto the sea, Dubrovnik and Lokrum.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 798\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nVilla Orsula is situated in a terraced garden overlooking the Adriatic and the green islet of Lokrum, a 10-minute walk along the coast from Ploče Gate, the eastern entrance into Dubrovnik's Old Town. Built as a private residence, this 1930s Art Deco villa exudes good taste and refinement. In the lobby, three magnificent Moorish-inspired Art Deco stone arches set the mood. With just 13 rooms, it provides the sort of personalised service that only a small hotel can achieve – you'll be treated more as a dear friend than a guest. From the fragrant garden, steep stone steps lead down to a lovely bathing platform, with sun beds, beach towels and easy access into the sea. You also have the use of the outdoor pool and spa (with indoor pool, hot tub, sauna and treatment rooms) at the neighbouring Grand Villa Argentina. The best rooms are the ones with stone balconies and sublime sea views.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 589\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\n• The best hotels on the Croatian islands\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\nEffortlessly graceful and romantic, the fortified islet of Sveti Stefan rises from the deep blue Adriatic. Two completely separate and different properties are within the complex. There is the fortified island, with 50 rooms, suites and cottages in carefully renovated old-stone buildings (open summer-only); and Villa Miločer, a 1930s villa set in gardens with eight suites (open all-year). The Aman Spa, sitting in a secluded bay backed by pinewoods, has an indoor (sea-view) pool, and offers personalised health and beauty treatments, combining movement, relaxation, nutrition and custom-made products based on locally sourced wild herbs, olive oil and honey. There are three pink pebble beaches on the mainland, and two (small-ish) outdoor pools on the island.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 950\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nMr & Mrs Smith\n\nAll eyes are on the Aegean at the Turquoise Coast outpost of the EDITION. The hotel tumbles down in layers, punctuated with olive trees, terraces and plunge pools, right down to the private beach with cabana-studded jetty and direct sea access. There are ample spots for relaxing, from the private beach and the deck with cabanas and ladders into the sea (book ahead to reserve), to the infinity pool. The spa has plunge pools, plus a Turkish hammam, steam room and beauty parlour. Those looking to be active can rent kayaks, stand-up paddleboards and even jet packs. Rooms are understated with a muted palette, with the view of the Aegean being the only pop of colour through the windows (most have a view of the blue).\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 301\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\n10 Telegraph expert rating\n\nQueen Victoria and Churchill have both sojourned at this fantasy Victorian mansion on the fringes...
