        "text": "You're in for major laughs with your Sunday night movie The Honeymoon. The movie is about a man named Adam who surprises his wife with a trip to Venice, but there's just one problem, his best friend Bav tags along. To make matters worse, Adam and Bav get wrapped up in a dangerous drug mission, with hilarious consequences. Let's take a look at other funny honeymoon movies on screen.\n\nThe Heartbreak Kid\n\nBen Stiller and Michelle Monaghan star in this black comedy which is a remake of the 1972 film of the same name. Eddie Cantrow (Stiller) marries the eccentric Lila but falls in love with another woman named Miranda (Monaghan) during his honeymoon in Mexico. During his stay, he experiences several hilariously bizarre incidents with Lila, making him question his marriage. He continues to bump into Miranda, further fuelling his attraction to her. Stiller, the king of comedy, shines in this movie that will have you laughing for days.\n\nJust Married\n\nAshton Kutcher and the late Brittany Murphy star in this heartwarming comedy that shows you love can defy all odds. Newlyweds Tom (Kutcher) and Sarah (Murphy) go on an adventurous honeymoon in Europe and encounter several obstacles along the way that test their new marriage. Tempers flare and sparks fly as Tom also has to deal with Sarah’s obnoxious rich daddy, an old flame of Sarah's, and secrets they're both keeping. The movie has loads of laughs and is a classic tale that will have you sweethearts out there falling in love all over again.\n\nHoneymoon in Vegas\n\nJames Caan, Nicolas Cage, and Sarah Jessica Parker drive this 1992 comedy drama. Jack (Cage) proposes to Betsy (Parker), the woman of his dreams, and they head off to Vegas to tie the knot. However, when gambler Tommy (Caan) catches a glimpse of them in Vegas, he thinks Betsy looks like his deceased wife and a crazy love triangle begins. The movie is filled with comedy and cons and shows you how far some will go in the name of love.\n\nYou’re about to embark on the honeymoon of a lifetime in The Honeymoon.
