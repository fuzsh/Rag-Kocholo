        "text": "LEONARD KASTLE'S \"The Honeymoon Killers,\" which opened yesterday at the Cine Malibu and neighborhood theaters, recounts the criminal partnership of Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez, who were executed for murder at Sing Sing Prison, in March, 1951.Fernandez and the 29-year-old, 200-pound Mrs. Beck, known as the \"Lonely Hearts Killers\" at the time of their trial, made a career of stealing from lonely women whom Fernandez met through correspondence clubs, with Mrs. Beck, a trained nurse, posing as his sister. Two of their more recalcitrant victims were murdered, and a third died as a result of an overdose of sleeping pills administered by Mrs. Beck.The movie follows the killers from just before their meeting (through a lonely hearts club correspondence) until just before their trial. Although it takes only the slightest (and most essential) liberties with the facts of the Beck-Fernandez case, \"The Honeymoon Killers\" is basically a fiction film—of a type virtually unknown in recent years, except as transmuted in the myth-making romanticism of, say, a \"Bonnie and Clyde.\" Within the limits of its type it is one of the best and, curiously, most beautiful American movies in recent years.Photographed in black and white, with fairly rudimentary sound recording and with lighting that seems always to come from natural sources or from whatever electric light bulbs might be at hand, \"The Honeymoon Killers\" virtually epitomizes the low-budget murder melodrama of everyone's fondest imaginations.In fact, it is concerned with murder less as crime than as unambiguous event. There is no conflict between law and disorder, no trail of clues, no hot pursuit, not even much suspense. When Martha decides that Raymond has taken more than monetary interest in one too many of their victims, she calls the police and turns him, and herself, in. And that, without climax, is the end of that.But \"The Honeymoon Killers\" has something else — a more concentrated, less cluttered, clearer vision than you are likely to have found in even the best conventional crime movies. Unusually seedy in all its particulars, utterly unflattering to all its characters, sufficiently horrible (but never gratuitously shocking) in the details of its murders, Kastle's film succeeds as a kind of chamber drama of desperate attraction and violent death.Although it is profoundly involved with the quality of individual middle-class American lives, it completely subordinates anecdote to action and pathos, even the pathos of its central characters, to passion.The secondary performances range from acceptable to excellent, with special praise for Mary Jane Higby as a 66-year-old Albany widow who proves especially difficult to kill. Shirley Stoler certainly looks the part of Martha Beck, but she brings to the role an air of grand disdain that seems reasonable as interpretation but sometimes awkward in performance. But Tony LoBianco, with slightly too much profile and a characterization that suggests an immensely humanized early Bela Lugosi, is brilliant.The real star of the movie is its writer-director. Leonard Kastle is a 40-year-old composer who has not previously made films. Oddly, the musical background—selections from Mahler symphonies, which oversell every climax—is the only serious failure in \"The Honeymoon Killers.\" But direction, the sum of those decisions that the filmmaker must feel as moral imperatives and that constitute the authorship of a movie, places Kastle among the important deliberate artists of his medium.\n\nThe CastTHE HONEYMOON KILLERS, directed and written by Leonard Kastle; director of photography, Oliver Wood; music by Gustav Mahler; produced by Warren Steibel; distributed by Cinerama-Releasing Corporation. At the Cine Malibu, 59th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, and neighborhood theaters. Running time: 107 minutes.
