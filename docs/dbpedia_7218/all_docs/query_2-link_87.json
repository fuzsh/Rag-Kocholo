When our son turned three and our daughter one, I asked my husband, “Shall we plan a trip now?” That’s how the idea of visiting New Zealand with our little ones was born.\n\nWhy Choose New Zealand for Your Family Trip?\n\nOur first long-distance trip was to New Zealand. After all, if you’re going to travel, you might as well do it right, right?\n\nExperience the Natural Beauty of New Zealand\n\nNew Zealand is a land filled with numerous nature reserves. This means no endless drives, but rather a new, breathtaking view at every turn!\n\nTraveling to New Zealand with Little Kids: Camper or Car?\n\nWhen planning a trip to New Zealand with little kids, you might be tempted to opt for a camper. However, my top advice is to avoid this mode of transport. While New Zealand may seem like the perfect camper country, there are many restrictions. Campers are prohibited in numerous locations, including some of the best hiking spots which are often situated in areas with dirt roads. Additionally, camper spots can be quite costly.\n\nOur Family Adventure in New Zealand\n\nWe arranged our trip through TravelEssence, an organization run by a New Zealander. They offer a variety of beautiful accommodations suitable for families traveling through New Zealand. Options range from a house atop a mountain, a bungalow in a village, to farm stays. You can discuss your preferences with the organization to find the perfect fit for your family.\n\nOur Family Adventure in New Zealand with a Stopover in Hong Kong\n\nOur family trip to New Zealand was an unforgettable experience. With our son nearing his 5th birthday and our daughter at 2.5 years, we embarked on this journey with a 14-hour stopover in Hong Kong. We had a comfortable stay at the Regal Airport Hotel, where we enjoyed a hearty breakfast and a refreshing dip in the pool.\n\nExploring Hong Kong\n\nDespite the jet lag, we decided to explore Hong Kong. A quick 20-minute train ride from the airport took us to the heart of the city. The bustling cityscape was quite impressive, especially for me, as it was my first time outside Europe.\n\nI highly recommend taking a long stopover and visiting Hong Kong. It’s a great way to break up the journey and experience a different culture.\n\nArriving in New Zealand\n\nAfter our Hong Kong adventure, we continued our journey to New Zealand. We arrived in Auckland after a brief stopover in Queenstown. Our first night was spent in a charming hotel, marking the beginning of our New Zealand adventure.\n\nExploring New Zealand with Little Kids\n\nTraveling with little kids can be a challenge, but it’s also an opportunity to create unforgettable family memories.

It’s clear that New Zealand is incredibly child-friendly. If you’re planning a trip to New Zealand with your kids, make sure to add these activities to your must-do list:\n\n1. Spotting Blue Penguins and Sea Lions at Broad Bay, Dunedin\n\nSeeing sea lions in their natural habitat is an amazing experience, especially when it’s just a 10-minute drive from our accommodation! We were thrilled to see young sea lion cubs with their mothers – a truly incredible sight. Although we could observe these beautiful creatures from our car, we decided to step out and get a little closer. However, remember to maintain a safe distance as the mothers can be quite protective of their young.\n\nAfter our sea lion encounter, we headed to see the penguins. Despite the cold wind and the setting dusk, our spirits weren’t dampened. The kids were equally thrilled to see the penguins.\n\n2. Relax & Walk Tour in Abel Tasman National Park\n\nUpon arrival at Kaiteriteri, we hop into a taxi for a 20-minute ride to the bay. The journey is filled with fun sights, including numerous sea lions and the renowned Split Apple Rock. Once we reach our destination, we embark on a short, scenic walk around the bay. The kids enjoy playing in the sand while my husband takes them for another walk. If you wish to extend your stay, overnight options are available.\n\n3. Playgrounds\n\nTraveling to New Zealand with little ones? You can’t miss out on the playgrounds. They are abundant, well-maintained, and safe, with no splinters or broken parts. One playground even features a dinosaur slide atop a mountain, offering a stunning view! Relax and enjoy a BBQ while the kids have fun on the playground.\n\n4. Puzzling World\n\nLocated in Wanaka, Puzzling World is a small, entertaining museum that will keep the kids highly engaged. It features a café with various table games, mind-bending areas where kids can appear as tall as their parents, and much more. It’s a must-visit when traveling to New Zealand with young children. The museum also houses the world’s first 3-D labyrinth, which is fun but requires careful supervision due to its tricky nature.\n\n5. Discover Doubtful Sound\n\nWhile Milford Sound is a well-known attraction in New Zealand, its lesser-known sibling, Doubtful Sound, offers a diverse and engaging experience. This trip is perfect for kids, combining a boat ride, a bus journey through the rainforest, and another boat trip through Doubtful Sound. It’s an 8-hour adventure that keeps the little ones entertained and intrigued.\n\n6. Explore Rob Roy Glacier Track at Wanaka\n\nRob Roy Glacier, located near Wanaka, is a hidden gem. The journey to the glacier is an adventure in itself, featuring a dirt road filled with fords (water-filled holes), making it a challenging route for campers. The road winds through meadows teeming with sheep and cows, offering breathtaking views. A walk through a meadow with enormous cows and a narrow, wobbling bridge adds to the thrill, especially for those with a fear of heights.\n\n7. Experience Maori Culture in Rotorua\n\nThe Maori, New Zealand’s native inhabitants, are known for their impressive and friendly nature. A visit to “Te Puia”, a beautiful park with a captivating show, is a must-do. Even kids who usually struggle to sit still will be mesmerized for the entire 55-minute performance. The nature reserve behind the show features a volcanic area with a geyser that shoots spectacular gusts of steam from the ground, adding to the awe-inspiring experience.\n\n8. Discover the Warm Waters of Kerosene Creek, Waiotapu\n\nImmerse yourself in the beauty of nature at Kerosene Creek in Waiotapu. This unique spot is where a warm water source meets a river, creating a creek with a constant, comfortable temperature of 30 degrees. It’s a perfect place to relax and unwind.\n\n9. Experience Rural Life at Peet’s Farm Stay Near Christchurch\n\nEnjoy a delightful stay at Peet’s Farm, located near Christchurch. This charming farm stay, run by a friendly couple, offers not only a bed and breakfast but also two clean and comfortable mobile homes. Upon arrival, guests are treated to a tour of the farm. For the little ones, there’s a fantastic playground complete with a trampoline. It’s a place your kids won’t want to leave!\n\n10. Encounter Wildlife at Willowbank Wildlife Reserve in Christchurch\n\nWillowbank Wildlife Reserve in Christchurch is more than just a zoo. It’s a place where animals are incredibly tame and approachable. Whether it’s a kangaroo or a chicken, these friendly creatures are sure to delight visitors of all ages. It’s a wildlife experience that kids, in particular, will absolutely love.\n\nBudget Tips for Visiting New Zealand with Kids\n\nTraveling through New Zealand with little ones can be an exciting adventure, but it can also be quite expensive.
