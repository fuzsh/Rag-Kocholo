Why risk our lives for them?\n\nSo we sent the cat ahead to find them and bring them back.\n\nNow... why are you here again?\n\nTo do your job. So hand over those Stimpaks. Awesome, we're off the hook! Here you go. To do your job. Now give us your RadAway. You won't be needing them. Awesome, we're off the hook! Here you go. To do your job. And we'll be taking one of your Laser Rifles to help us out. Fine by us! Here you go. To do your job. But we'll keep quiet about your cowardice if you've got enough Caps. I guess that's fair. A good reputation isn't going to keep itself! We're saved! Thank you so much!\n\nA nice cat kept us safe when those creatures attacked! But otherwise it just slept...\n\nBut please don't take us back to the settlement. It's horrible there!\n\nThe wedding gifts we got were so cheap! We can't imagine going back.\n\nWould you please just shut up and go home already? You've caused enough trouble. Fine. But you're stuck with the ugly dress they gave me. A dusty Librarian Outfit? Really? Actually, there's room in my Vault for one more person. Patricia, you can come. Darling, I'll never forget you as I toil away in complete safety. Stay strong! You know... there's room in my Vault for one more person. Grant, you're invited. My husband would never aband... Oh, you want to go? Fine then. Go."
