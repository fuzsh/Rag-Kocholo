        "text": "You might think you know everything about the tortured artist biopic, but long held expectations are challenged once again with Kwon-taek Im’s Chi-Hwa-Seon: Painted Fire. Jang Seung-Ub (Min-sik Choi) is the temperamental mad-genius artist who used his gift to feed into his basest primal desires.\n\n“In 1882, the Chosin dynasty is ending. The Koreans are rebelling against foreign invasions and corrupt governments. The country is in decline.”\n\nThe Korean world in the 19th century was in turmoil, suffering from impending Japanese and Chinese imperialism, and persecuted Catholics led to widespread civil unrest; communities are torn by fear of not adhering to conformity. This biopic starts with the subject young, we see Jang's existence would have withered away in early childhood…\n\nChihwaseon, co-winner (along with Paul Thomas Anderson’s superior Punch-Drunk Love) of the prize for best director at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, is a rather conventional artist’s biopic that’s occasionally blessed with an astute sense of physical movement and natural spectacle. The film opens with a pre-title sequence that shows a close-up of a brush as it paints a large black spot on a blank canvas. After the painting is done, the camera zooms into the black space, and the film begins properly. The implication here seems to be that director Im Kwon-taek is helping us better understand the film’s subject (late 19th century Korean painter Jang Seung-up) by taking us inside the paintings that he made. It’s a fine…\n\nA conventional biopic of Jang Seung-Eop, whose eccentrics and distinctive style have made him among the more prolific (not the most, to note) painters of the late-Joseon era. It is one film that's been on my watchlist for some time, especially considering its symbolic significance - the first Korean winner of a major prize in Cannes when it won the Director's Prize at 2002 Cannes with none other than PTA's Punch-Drunk Love.\n\nIt is also one of the most well-known and highly-regarded works of Yim Gweon-Taek, one of the Korean greats whose name isn't mentioned as much in public discourse due to his well-documented history of abuse in his films (see: Kechiche over last ten years), even if it's not…"
