        "text": "Making his directorial debut in 1960, Korea's most productive director ever - Im Kwon-taek - has more than hundred films on his resume. His 98th film won him the prize for best director at the Cannes film festival. Each frame is a diamond in terms of composition, use of colour, placement and movement of characters. The pictorial style is dictated by the subject: the half-fictional biography of the wandering Korean painter prince and bon vivant 'Ohwon' Jang Seung-up who lived in turbulent second half of the nineteenth century. In elegant tableaux, Im paints the portrait of an exuberant artist who is completely absorbed in his work, goes through life drinking and copulating, never defends those in power, and always retains his freedom and independence.\n\n\"Grounded by a vigorous, physical performance from Choi Min-sik, who brings both earthiness and grandeur to the central role, the film vividly evokes the world of an obsessive natural talent.\" - Variety\n\n\"Another masterpiece from one of the world's more neglected great directors, a master artist who here reveals the soul of another.\" - Chicago Tribune"
