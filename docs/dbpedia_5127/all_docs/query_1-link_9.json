        "meta_description": "Class is one of the foremost factors in the formation of cultural identities of contemporary Koreans living as a divided nation. This chapter discusses six films made in North Korea and South Korea between the year 1980 and 1990. The texts from North Korea are O Pyongch'o's The Untrodden Path, Ch'ae P'unggi's The Brigade Commander's Former Superior and Cho Kyongsun's Bellflower. The corresponding South Korean films are Yi Changho's A Nice Windy Day, Pak Chongw on's Kuro Arirang and Pak Kwangsu's Black Republic. These six films commonly concern the life of the working class by portraying various consequences of the social dislocations and cultural confusion of contemporary Koreans. With the emergence of the cinema of social criticism, the government intensified its ideological and political control over the film industry.",
