        "text": "The two books by Steven Chung and Young-a Park that I discuss in this essay signal the growth of Korean studies by simply beginning in medias res. That is, unlike many books that came before them, they offer no lengthy exposition to set things up, to declare and justify the need for the study at hand. These new books also reflect the recent scholarly trend of reaching beyond the established area studies or Korean studies models to present studies that are interdisciplinary and transnational in scope. Park’s Unexpected Alliances is a narrative at once of South Korea’s transition to a (truly) civil society, of its artistic struggle for independence and integrity, of the individual’s negotiations with the state, and of feminist awakenings in unlikely circumstances. Chung’s Split Screen Korea, which I will discuss first, is similarly expansive in scope. As he lays out in the beginning, the book follow[s] the trajectories that Shin Sang-ok took, the ways in which his work continued throu...\n\nThe idea for Rediscovering Korean Cinema struck me unexpectedly during the BIFF Film Conference and Forum held at the Twentieth Busan International Film Festival (BIFF) in October 2015. I was a respondent to the panel \"Re-evaluating Korean Film Authors. \" Four well-established panelists, Seung-hoon Jeong, Hyangjin Lee, Nam Lee, and Mi-Jeong Lee, discussed such distinguished authors as Bong Joon-ho (Pong Chun-ho), Hong Sang-soo (Hong Sang-su), and Kim Ki-duk (Kim Ki-dŏk). After their thought-provoking talks, during the question and answer session, two audience members raised questions about the availability of an appropriate textbook for teaching Korean cinema in their home countries. One of them strongly requested that we write an accessible and readable book that would cover canonical film texts for students and general readers alike. After the panel, we discussed the request. All of us took this matter seriously and indeed had already acknowledged the absence of such a textbook. Despite the quantum leap in Korean film scholarship in recent years, there is still a shortage of essays on individual films and directors. Yi Man-hŭi (Lee Man-hee), Han Hyŏng-mo (Han Hyung-mo), Kim Su-yong (Kim Soo-yong), Ha Kil-chong (Ha Gil-jong), Yi Chang-ho (Lee Jang-ho), Yi Tu-yong (Lee Doo-yong), Chŏng Chi-yŏng (Chung Ji-young), and Pae Ch'ang-ho (Bae Chang-ho) are among the many Korean directors whose cinematic treasures have not been written about in the English language. Even worse, no systematically structured book-length textbook offering a comprehensive history of Korean cinema had been published when the idea for this book was proposed. I began this project to fill this gap in the field. Three panelists-Seung-hoon Jeong, Hyangjin Lee, and Nam Lee\n\nGenerally, the younger generations tend to rapidly embrace new subcultures and trends, weakening the role of traditions. Such is the case of Korea in the last hundred years, as Koreans have had to adapt to various new influences, and the old traditions were either maintained with great effort or adapted to new situations. The “Korean Wave”, which is not only the promotion of Korean pop music but also of Korean movies and television series, reflects this continuous process by shining a spotlight on both the old traditions and the new trends of Korean society. The survival of the Korean traditions is portrayed in the movie “Seopyeonje” (1993), directed by Im Kwon-taek, which follows two teenagers, who were taught pansori by their stepfather, as they strive to survive as pansori singers in a society where Western songs are more appealing. Conversely, the movie “Love, Lies” (2016), directed by Park Heung-Sik, showcases why the old way of singing will become less appreciated, as the new ...\n\nThe aim of this short survey essay is to rediscover and reevaluate a his-tory of contemporary South Korean cinema, the ways in which South Korean cinema has been curated, exhibited, and received in the Westt hrough international film festival circuits, art houses, and specialized theatre chains in North America and, to some extent, Europe. This essay begins with the Hawaii International Film Festival (HIFF) in the early 1980s where South Korean cinema was „discovered‟ by Anglophone film critics and academics for the first time and folds the discussion in the mid-2000s when South Korean cinema had finally become a fixture of the international film festivals after getting critical acclaims of celebrated auteurs."
