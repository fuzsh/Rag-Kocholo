I write these essays to be heard in a video and so it won't have in-text citations, I'll included references in a bibliography at the bottom. Thank you!) My YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/ScreenTherapy/videos\n\nWhat Could I Say Now?\n\nI’m about 2 years late to the scene in writing an essay about this film, but I’ve wanted to write this since it came out.\n\nI guess I’ve just been a little scared that people might not like what I have to say.\n\nI’m not scared to say this movie is a masterpiece. I’m not scared to say that it’s also a dreadful fun-house of subverted expectations. What I’m scared to say is that this black comedy reads much better as a Tragedy – and that the Tragedy of the Kims has a very real villain – a force that dooms everyone in the story, infecting their lives from the inside out – but this villain might live somewhere we don’t really want to accept.\n\nParasite and its message on class relations elicits many strong, destabilizing emotions – it can leave audiences paralyzed by dread, anger, desperation, denial, or an overwhelming apathy.\n\nTrue of all of my Screen Therapy reviews, I’ll do my best, to model how to interpret films from a Positive Media Literacy lens. My writing is informed by Positive Media Psychology techniques – techniques that can be used to take impactful films, games, or other media we come across and use them mindfully as tools for self-discovery and self-improvement.\n\nSo, in short, my aim with this review, like all my other reviews, is to do more than just talk about the film’s artistry or how well-written it is – but to go a step further and make it useful for us in a practical way. I will explore what we can learn from this powerful story that can actually help us understand ourselves and the world around us a little better.\n\nHow is Parasite (2019) a Tragedy?\n\nWhen I say the conclusion of the film is “Tragic” I’m arguing that this film, although its categorized as a Black Comedy, reads much closer to a classic Tragedy with a capital T.\n\nTragic plots, as summarized by Media Psychologists C. Scott Rigby and Richard M. Ryan in the Handbook of Media Use and Well-Being, are plots that entail fundamental conflicts which cause tension and whose resolution is in doubt. Tragic conflicts are between extrinsic goals for power or wealth and intrinsic moral or prosocial pursuits.\n\n“In tragic narratives, there is a desire to achieve a specific goal that is often pursued as a non-autonomous or obsessive passion.”\n\nRigby, C. S., & Ryan, R. M. (2016).\n\nAnd, of course, Tragedies almost always result in the downfall of our lead protagonists, usually just as they acquired or are about the acquire what they always wanted. And many tragedies, like Oedipus Rex, feature relatable and underdog protagonists who commit some terrible crime without realizing the depth of what they’re doing. As the protagonist realizes their error their world and accomplishments crumble around them. Through hubris, they realize they overstretched themselves and crash, like Icarus, back down to Earth.\n\nWe see these themes played out perfectly by the Kim family. They find incredible opportunities to fulfill goals for wealth, dignity, respect, and status.\n\nThey’re willing to overlook some moral codes and even forsake compassionate attitudes to maintain what they’ve accumulated. And like a true Tragedy written by Sophocles or Euripedes these characters still remain highly relatable. No matter what they do, knowingly or unknowingly, we want them to succeed – we want them to stay safe and get a happy ending. And so, regardless of what crimes our protagonists commit we’re enraged, horrified, overcome with pity or terror when we see their demise.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, this was the purpose of Tragedy. He argued that tragedies receive so much attention and acclaim because they purge us of our petty concerns and worries and we can experience the cathartic release of pity and fear. Since ancient times many scholars maintain that tragic theatre has served therapeutic, cathartic functions like this.\n\nI’ll explore why we love tragedies and what makes them psychologically helpful to us, but first, let’s figure out what caused their tragedy. What was the fatal flaw that led to the Kims’ downfall?\n\nThe Cause of the Tragedy\n\nA typical reading might say that the Kims experienced their tragedy because they were either too greedy or they were pushed into desperation by the rich Park family.\n\nThis is a heated debate, actually. One that I was too shy to enter till now. Many people read the film as a narrative about the evils of a detached, un-empathetic, greedy upper class – but, to me, this doesn’t really make complete sense.\n\nI’ve tried the reading of the villainous rich family that pressured the Kims into their moral ambiguity and downfall but it never sat well with me since the worst crime I could pin on the Parks was snobbery and cold manners while the moral infringements the Kims committed stacked relatively higher.\n\nThe Kims hurt several people to get what they wanted and even contemplated or accidentally committed murder.\n\nOf course, we don’t know what the Parks did to get rich – its never explained – who knows if Mr. Park was somehow hurting people with his job or hurt people to climb the ladder, or maybe he, like many wealthy people in real life, simply had wealthy parents- but there was never investigation into whether Mr. Park earned his wealth morally or not. There’s nothing else in the story that shows any of the Parks being anything but oblivious and sometimes rude.\n\nSo, unfortunately, I couldn’t join those who blamed the rich for the tragedy of the Kims. Although, absolutely, the lack of social infrastructure and welfare programs to bridge inequality and provide resources to the disadvantaged is a key factor in the Kims’ lives and the snobbery they experienced from the rich definitely aggravated their condition. And it can be argued that the main lesson we should take from Parasite would be an urgent plea to bridge opportunity gaps and invest and social welfare programs that would combat food or shelter insecurities. But, again, my analyses always look at the psychological and emotional lessons we can take from a story and classic Tragedies also focus the individual’s actions instead of creating social commentaries.\n\nSo, what individual microcosmic events or perspectives led to the Kims’ tragedies?\n\nThe cause of the tragedy, the acute condition that plagued all the characters, poor or rich, and the force that motivated the final crimes of the film was something called Status Anxiety – and it lives silently gnawing away in almost all of us.\n\nWhat is Status Anxiety?\n\nStatus Anxiety is a term coined by philosopher Alain de Botton. Its one of his most helpful insights.\n\nStatus Anxiety is the anxiety concerned with our status in society: how we’re seen, judged, and valued based on our occupation, wealth, or how many nice things we own.\n\nIt’s that panic we experience when someone asks us, “So what do you do?“, and we suddenly feel self-conscious that our answer won’t persuade the person asking us to understand just how worthwhile and valuable we are as a person because we’re not a high level executive with a complicated title. Its the all-motivating fear that we don’t have a high enough status to earn dignity or respect.\n\nStatus Anxiety makes It feels like a tall order to hope that the person who asks us what we do for a living should still be interested in us as a friend or even as a human being if we say we fold pizza boxes or, god forbid, that we’re unemployed.\n\nStatus anxiety runs deep in highly individualistic meritocratic societies where our worth is routinely measured by the status of our jobs, our wealth, our possessions, our style, and our reputation with others of high status.\n\nIf you struggle with Status Anxiety you might recognize some of these behaviors in yourself:\n\nWhen you have to explain your job you get nervous they will think less of you because of it. You sometimes might also subconsciously think less of someone else because of their job.\n\nYou’re scared that if people know how little money you make or have they’ll judge you.\n\nYou routinely buy as many status symbol items like new cars or accessories because the idea of others seeing you with those items is comforting – it helps you feel like you could be accepted and respected by others. Not staying up to date with your accessories might even be a source of stress.\n\nYou sometimes lie awake at night scared of how little you have on your resume or how few accomplishments you have compared to others on social media.\n\nYou might even put yourself down and think badly about yourself because of a lack of high status.\n\nA few misconceptions to avoid:\n\nThis is not a commentary on South Korean society or culture. I am not an expert in the social norms or culture of South Korea, but Status Anxiety is found all over the world – just particularity in societies that value high levels of individualistic competition or presents itself as a meritocratic society with social mobility that is “earned” through hard work. As an American, Status Anxiety manifests itself in my society in a way that seems very familiar to what I saw in Parasite. And that’s all I can speak to.\n\nStatus Anxiety isn’t about materialism or greed, I am not interested in demonizing those who struggle with this anxiety – I have had my battles with it as well. This form of anxiety is easy to look down on as being shallow or greedy, but its actually the poignant fear of not being seen, understood, respected, or treated with kindness the way any human should be simply because you have not “earned” enough status to unlock those heavily guarded privileges from others or, even deeper, to unlock that kindness and respect from yourself for yourself.\n\nStatus Anxiety is not simply a tool of oppression from the rich onto the poor. The anxiety around status does play in the favor of the rich- however, the rich are not the only ones who enforce these boundaries of status. We all have done our part. We have all learned from those older than us to judge others on their job and their income or wealth or collection of status symbols. In conversation, we probably have joked about certain professions or speak with more respect about someone with a complicated job title.\n\nBut before we feel guilty about this, we also need to recognize that we often police ourselves the most about what we think we deserve and what we don’t deserve based on how successful we feel we are compared to others. We keep ourselves from our internal wells of self-respect or self-compassion if we feel we haven’t earned those feelings.\n\nAdditionally, we were taught these ideas from a young age and have not been made aware of them regularly, awareness is the first step towards releasing ourselves from these expectations and releasing expectations we put on others for them to prove their worth to us.\n\nAll in all, Status anxiety is wholly unhelpful not only because it can steal decades of our life as we compete in a rat race for more wealth and resources in exchange for status to exchange for dignity, but because it pits us against ourselves and each other.\n\nIn a world obsessed with status, there is only one “right” way to live and that is to have high status, but its impossible for everyone to have high status because then there would be no one beneath them to compare themselves to.\n\nIn meritocratic societies the rich are quietly assumed to be more important, impressive, and worthy of our admiration, respect, and kindness – anyone who thinks otherwise is assumed to just be jealous or bitter. In these same societies, those who are poor are usually seen as lazy or unintelligent and must’ve, in some way, “chosen to become poor.” This feeds the narrative that the underprivileged deserve to be ignored, disrespected, and partitioned from the rich because their very existence is a shortcoming.\n\nBut, thinking about this, we know, on some level, this isn’t right, fair, or logical. Someone, no matter how smart, hard-working, or kind they are will always have to be on the bottom for this system to work.\n\nAs a side note this ties in very well with the main themes of Bong Joon Ho’s Snowpiercer and its allegory about social stratification and how inequality serves a purpose in placing everyone with a specific “function” to feed those above them. But I’d like to focus on Parasite for now.\n\nThese ideas are so well-ingrained in our minds its hard to find the roots of how deeply they reach. Even after learning about this concept we might not be aware of just how detrimental this kind of anxiety is on our sense of self-worth or mental well-being.\n\nI argue that Parasite is a tragedy because it is a portrait of just how malignant and destructive status anxiety can be.\n\nAll the Characters Suffer From Status Anxiety\n\nAll the characters in this film are living and breathing status anxiety.This film is an exploration on how status anxiety is upheld by imaginary lines, rules, and the rationing of dignity and respect.\n\nStatus Anxiety for those in Lower Status\n\nThe Kim Family\n\nFirst, looking at the Kims, they are the most obvious victims of Status Anxiety. More than anyone else in the film, this family knows the sorrows of being seen as lesser than. As the film progresses we witness a bitterness grow in the Kims.\n\nAfter being confronted with the lines and boundaries enforced by the rich they struggle to reconcile how they’re seen and treated because of their low status and the knowledge that they deserve more dignity and comfort.\n\nHowever, the Kims were the perfect protagonists because they subvert many expectations that Status anxiety instills in us. They are not living in low status in a subterranean apartment because they are “dumb” or “lazy”.\n\nThe opening scenes establish right away that although the Kims are dealing with shelter and food insecurity – they are intelligent, cunning, and work very hard to attain even basic necessities.They are doing the best they can with the few resources they have. We see through them that they don’t choose poverty – they are unlucky, unsupported, and marginalized. Those in impoverished conditions are usually made invisible by status anxiety in real life – those who observe status rules have learned to ignore real-life Kims or think harshly of them and their lifestyle – but by making a family like the Kims our main characters in a film like this – they are brought out of the obscurity they’re usually kept in in real life and quickly become sympathetic underdogs that everyone wants to root for.\n\nThis is a good moment of mindfulness for ourselves as the audience- we can check with ourselves about how much respect and dignity we ascribe to families like the Kims in real life. Recognizing the complexity of the lives of those who people are usually taught to ignore or belittle is a good step in the direction of breaking our status anxious lens.\n\nKim Ki-Woo (Kevin)\n\nKi Woo is our central figure for the Kim family and he is the one who sparks their tragic journey – he is, in a way, patient zero of the rampant status anxiety that plagues the Kim family in the second half of the film.\n\nIn the beginning, his family had seemed more or less concerned with simply surviving their day to day life. They would celebrate their small victories, and appreciate what they did have. But this all starts to change when Min gifts them the viewing stone.\n\nIn that moment, Ki Taek seems happy for the kind gift, and Ki Woo’s mother, Chung Sook, is more concerned with practicalities over ideas of status and would’ve preferred food. But the stone becomes a source of inspiration and obsession about status and social mobility for Ki Woo.\n\nAs a young and clever man watching his peers grow into great opportunities, he is preoccupied with attaining high status, by any means necessary. Ki Woo enjoys the fineries of the Park’s home and his new income and he does climb to higher status with his eyes set on marrying into the Park family as a way of taking the elevator up the social ladder – but towards the end of the film, we see what truly haunts him.\n\nWhen faced with the decision to either cut his losses and run or solidify his ascension in status – he takes a moment to think about what he really wants.\n\nIt’s not the house, not a rich wife – those aren’t the things that motivate his decision to attempt murder – it was this moment, when he considered whether he could ever fit in with these shiny, comfortable, happy families. That is, after all, what is at the end of our status anxiety – our concerns that we are being left out or overlooked. Our concern that a lack in status means we’re less deserving of comfort, happiness, or community.\n\nNow I want to rewind a moment to this scene:\n\nThis is the scene where Ki Woo confronts a drunk man relieving himself next to their home. Its a scene that confused me on my first watch – I had wondered why it was included. Sure it was a moment of levity and silliness, but I wasn’t sure what it was contributing to the movie as a whole. It didn’t make sense until I applied my analysis of status anxiety to the film.\n\nI don’t think its a coincidence that Ki Woo’s first choice of weapon (before his father gives him a water bottle, instead) to ward off the disrespect and humiliation of having your home peed on is the viewing stone. It also isn’t a coincidence that at the start of the film Ki Woo had been ridiculed for not having the same vigor as his wealthy friend to scare the drunk man away from relieving himself on their home.\n\nThis second scene is halfway through the film and after getting into the Parks good graces, Ki Woo insists on fighting back now. In a way this moment symbolizes Ki Woo’s growing confidence that his imminent ascent in social status earns him the right to enforce respect from others in a way he or his family hadn’t asserted before because he and they finally “deserve” better.\n\nWhile I’m not one to defend the attack of even a rude drunk man with a bludgeoning object I argue that Ki Woo’s Status Anxiety is what made him ever believe he had to wait until he accumulated more status before allowing himself the confidence or self-worth to assert boundaries and even basic respect from others.\n\nKim Ki-Taek\n\nKi-Taek is another vehicle for status anxiety and how it eats away at our sense of identity and self-worth. The symbol of status anxiety in his journey was smell. Bong Joon Ho used smell as a symbol since its something that would realistically be noticeable when these two families meet. Throughout the film the smell of characters becomes a signifier of their status. The poor smell strangely and the rich have no mentionable scent – they are simply the normative, the default, the expected.\n\nThe device of smell being connected to status is very realistic. Anyone who has struggled with housing or utility insecurity would understand the high anxiety around being seen and judged as unclean when interacting with more privileged people. To smell bad or different is shameful and usually seen as a personal fault – one becomes repellent and an object of disgust, no longer a fellow human but an imposition. This motif also come to a peak in the final scenes of the film.\n\nChung Sook\n\nFor Chung Sook, I just want to focus on one specific moment during the night of the storm for Chung Sook that changed the fate of every character in the film. Arguably, it was the first domino to fall to spark the rising conflicts of the conclusion, and I argue it was pushed by status anxiety.\n\nIt was noted by some essayists that a sharp departure in message from Bong Joon Ho’s Snowpeircer is that the disadvantaged in Parasite don’t share a sense of camaraderie. In Snowpeircer, those from the back cars work together to move forward. Here, it plays out differently, when they’re discovered, Moon Gwang – the previous housekeeper -tries to relate to Chung Sook. Saying, “we’re not so different.”\n\nChung Sook might have seen the similarities and understood that they really aren’t very different in their struggles and deceptions. Yes, living under the house was particularly strange, but after all they both had been lying to the Parks in significant ways to pull themselves out of poor living conditions and if we were watching closely we’d remember that the shop mentioned in this scene that had gone bankrupt and put Guen Sae and Gwang Moon in debt, landing them in this position hiding from loan sharks, was the same shop that Ki Taek used to work for. This detail further highlights their similarities.\n\nBut, in this moment, Chung Sook is angered by the comparison. Instead of helping, she doubles down and antagozes Moon Gwang by threatening to callt he cops. Moments later, Chung Sook is at Moon Gwang’s mercy when its discovered the Kims’ situation is discovered. Moon Gwang takes advantage of this and the rising conflicts start.\n\nIn a way, I feel this scene highlights how Status Anxiety is a highly competitive and individualistic feeling. Paradoxically, those in lower status who are anxious about their status can be some of the harshest critics of those who are most similar to themselves. They can be so preoccupied with the game of status mobility that they won’t mind competing with others like them and climbing over them – in fact, by climbing over others and putting them down – the anxious further assert their ascension in the ranks of status. Those who are trying to climb the ladder can look down at those they left behind in the competition as a means of building self-esteem. That’s why Moon Gwang’s momentary comparison that they are similar was so insulting to Chung Sook.\n\nThis anger and game of comparison further perpetuates and fortifies the hold of status anxiety on us not only as an individual but as a society – when competition and “winning” is prized over camaraderie or collaboration.\n\nMoon Gwang and Guen Se\n\nEven the previous housekeeper and her husband are fueled by Status Anxiety – however they are the opposite from the Kims. Where the Kims have become angry at the Parks and the boundaries between them, these two have bought into the illusion of status completely.\n\nInstead of anger, they, especially the husband, truly believe that the Parks must be nearly divine for having maintained such power and wealth. The husband exalts and worships the patriarch of the Park family like a religious figure – he is dizzy with love and gratitude for his unknowing benefactor.\n\nGeun Se is a great symbol of those who idolize status to the point they no longer question the status quo and are willing to give their time, energy, and love to reinforce these ideals. He might be a stand in for people who idolize the wealthy zealously, thinking about them constantly, rationalizing income disparity, while never being appreciated or even seen by those they put on pedestals.\n\nStatus Anxiety in those of High Status\n\nThe rich in real life, like the Parks, enjoy all the many benefits of high status, they have access to many resources, comforts, and limitless dignity. They live in a world of overflowing light and space. All of the social niceties that the poor are denied, the rich collect in surplus. People are extra patient, extra kind, extra generous with those of high status.\n\nBut even the rich aren’t exempt from a few negative effects from status anxiety. The Kims constantly describe the Parks as nice, naive, and simple. These are both virtues and weaknesses. With so many social and physical resources insulating them from the outside world, they can afford to be blind to the struggles of those who work around them to build them up.\n\nI’d make a brief argument here that films like Parasite are useful for those of higher status to watch so that they can have a window into the lives of others with less status and to understand just how tall their ivory towers are.\n\nThe unpopular opinion I’m bringing to this analysis is that, while the Parks are a part of unempathetic and inequitable system, they aren’t malicious. They’re uneducated in the struggles of those beneath them – they are so detached from the rest of society that they are self-obsessed and easily overwhelmed by slight discomforts all while being oblivious to the deep-rooted pain and suffering of others outside their ivory tower. The narrative of Status Anxiety has taught them that they earned their resources, they’ve earned a surplus of respect, dignity, and admiration and should use them as much as possible, and shouldn’t need to worry about anyone with less because all it takes is hard work and anyone could have what they do (even though this is not entirely true.)\n\nThe worst crime I can contribute to the Parks is that, Status Anxiety in the wealthy manifests as highly conservative and defensive views. They are pressured internally to not only maintain but elevate their image with expensive tastes and the best education. The rich need to reinforce boundaries in society that keep themselves on a higher rung and others beneath them.\n\nSo, as we see in the movie, One of their priorities when interacting with those they perceive as below them on the status ladder is maintaining the line between them.\n\nThis is said explicitly by Mr. Park many times – he praises chauffeurs who can stay behind a status line and help reinforce the strata that affords the Parks so much comfort. Any time anything crosses the line, it upsets or angers Mr. Park quietly.\n\nWhile the Parks don’t need to worry about resources or food or shelter insecurities – they worry about maintaining and gardening the status quo – their home, their clothes, the accomplishments of their children. They draw lines and focus on small details like smells as a means of buying into the illusion of status that serves them very well, but it is still one of their own primary causes of anxiety. Those in lower status look at their concerns and what they spend their resources on as lavish, excessive, and maybe a bit ridiculous but these purchases come from a place of status anxiety, too.\n\nAnother layer of how the Parks related to those of lower status creeps up during the night of the storm. It becomes clear that they also fetishize those in lower status. When Mr. Park finds what he thinks are cheap underwear in the car he sniffs them, and although he’s seemingly repulsed, we learn later it becomes a fantasy of his.\n\nThe fantasy probably centers around how the imaginary woman who would own cheap underwear and have sex in a backseat must be someone wild and doesn’t care about protecting her reputation or status. They desire what they think are the carefree and unrestrained lives of those beneath them. It seems like a fantasy of the wealthy to be as “reckless” as the people who don’t have to mind rules, images, and boundaries the way they do in their high status.\n\nThis whole exchange is incredibly humiliating for the Kims to hear and probably degrading to witness how the Parks fetishize those beneath them, this further aggravates an obsession with status for the Kims.\n\nSo while the Parks reinforce status anxiety and keep up boundaries, the Parks are just as tangled in the web of status anxiety as the other characters in this stories, though they suffer much less and do, both knowingly and obliviously, contribute to the symbolic oppression of those beneath them, again, the worst crime they commit is snobbery. Their worst crime is simply reinforcing status anxiety in others – but I argue that’s something that almost everyone in a status anxious society is trained to do from childhood, regardless of how wealthy you are.\n\nThe Breaking Point\n\nThe beginning of the end is when the Kim family’s home is flooded. Their dreams of ascent are dashed by the reality of their condition – their helplessness in living in a subterranean home in a part of the city lacking the infrastructure needed to stop floods. What little comforts and possessions they had are jeopardized.\n\nWhat Ki Woo finds in his flooded home is the viewing stone again. It seems to bubble up to the surface although it must be very heavy. Its the only thing Ki Woo cares about and finding it in this condition, without its base and among the remains of his home, seems to aggravate something inside him. The stone is a symbol of his obsession with status – finding it while at one of his lowest points in the story tells us exactly how his character is changing. Instead of focusing on the imminent danger of himself, his family, or what to do to get through the night – Ki Woo becomes fixated on protecting their chance for social mobility.\n\nHe clings onto the stone all night, talking about it with his father. The next day, we learn what plans had been hatching from Ki Woo’s desperation and trauma.\n\nWe get one more insight into Ki Woo’s mind before the final confrontations. He talks to the Park daughter about the party guests, all rich in status, style, and dignity. Even after attaining so much and having plans to marry into the Park family one day – when he asks the daughter whether or not he belongs with them we see his true fear— not that he isn’t rich or comfortable, but that he might never attain the dignity, respect, and inclusion he covets from the wealthy. I would say that this desire for the intangible and social benefits of status was what spurred him on the entire film – not material wealth.\n\nWhen Ki Woo takes the viewing stone downstairs instead of using any other blunt object around him, it’s of course a symbolic choice of weapon. It’s presumed he went downstairs with the stone to silence Moon Gwang and Guen Se, who were being held captive in the basement during the party. The object that symbolizes his obsession with status became his tool to dehumanize and destroy others for his own gain. Ultimately, in a tragic turn, it actually is used by a man “beneath” him to inflict brain damage on him and rob him of some of his cognitive and emotional talents, talents he had hoped to use to ascend the ranks of society.\n\nAt this same time, Ki-Taek, on the other hand – is coming to his own realizations. Up till the day of the party, he had been trying his hardest to humanize the Parks throughout the film by asking personal questions, commenting on their relationships, and trying to conceptualize them not as snobby rich people or deities, but as people similar to himself and his family.\n\nIn this scene with Mr. Park, he crosses a line by mentioning how much Mr. Park must love his wife. Mr. Park had been visibly bothered the first time Ki Taek tried to cross this line.\n\nMr. Park puts his foot down and clearly reinforces what he has only mentioned in private – the boundaries between them. Kim is reminded that he’s just an employee, he is getting paid for this, so there’s no room for any other kind of connection. This is the moment where Kim’s efforts to try and understand the Parks falls apart – he’s left with the degradation and dehumanization that had been piling up since meeting the family.\n\nEverything moves very quickly once Geun-se attacks.\n\nI think Bong Joon Ho used the Guen-sae to instigate the climax of the film to relieve both Mr. Kim and Mr. Park from the responsibility of spurring the bloody and tragic ending. Because of the violence and confusion, these two men collided as humans, and in the traumatic frenzy, tensions that had been brewing the entire film reached a boiling point.\n\nJessica is stabbed and Mr. Park’s son faints from the shock and begins to seize. The two patriarchs are tending to their families but Mr. Park demands Mr. Kim’s attention for his own son and without glancing at Jessica.\n\nAlthough Mr. Park doesn’t know Ki Taek is also trying to save his own child, the fact that Ki Taek is still expected to respect his employer’s demands to release his daughter’s wound, which needs constant pressure, to retrieve the keys shows Ki Taek something important.\n\nHe follows orders out of habit, releasing his daughter’s wounds, and its clear that even in that moment Mr. Park’s status affords him more resources and attention that will save his son but will cost his daughter life-saving attention.\n\nAnd as Guen-se lies there, still adoring Mr. Park, Mr. Park is so disgusted by the man’s smell he has to plug his nose. Ki Taek looks at this in disbelief. Of course, its strange that this moment would bother Ki Taek – after all Guen Sae had just stabbed his daughter, who in that position would care whether Mr. Park found Guen Sae disgusting?\n\nIn my interpretation, in that moment, Ki Taek was driven to a breaking point by witnessing how high and low status was being acknowledged and enforced even during a moment of raw human terror. People were dying and, still, Mr. Park was the most important person in all their minds – what he wanted and disliked was paramount.\n\nKi Taek suddenly turned the knife of Mr. Park because he was a symbol of how the dignity, respect, and safety that Ki Taek and others with low status needed so desperately had been taken away from them so that a man with high status like Mr. Park could have more.\n\nIn the end, all the emotional violence in this film was instigated by the deep anxiety and frustration around status its grip on access to human dignity – both status and dignity are treated as nonrenewable and rare resources that only the rich deserve and dole out leaving people on the lower rungs trapped in a position to be loathed or ignored by those above them, those around them, and even themselves.\n\nThe Kims and Parks did what they did because characters in tragedies aren’t supposed to make better decisions, instead they’re supposed to fail so that we learn something. So… I’d like to use my analysis of the film to present a solution for our own woes with Status Anxiety.\n\nHow Do Tragedies Help Us?\n\nTragedies offers us important learning opportunities and emotional experiences.. In the essay Meaningful Entertainment in an Introduction to Positive Media Psychology, you’ll find some corrective language that explains although tragedies are so popular we don’t necessarily psychologically “enjoy” tragedies, we don’t enjoy them like our other media, instead we “appreciate” them. This distinction is important because although we don’t feel happy from watching Parasite, we don’t have the positive feelings of “enjoying” it, it received so much attention because we “appreciated” how deeply it made us feel and think. Enjoyment is short-lived, but Appreciation responses to media are characterized by the audience feeling motivated to participate in self-reflection, self-development, relationship reflection, and personal growth. In short – we like Tragedies because they help us discover who we are.\n\nIn the language of Positive Media Literacy, this means tragedies are useful tools for self-development. Our daily lives are most likely very tame, if tragic circumstances are brewing, we’re often blind or numb to them until its too late – watching a film like Parasite, beautiful, mesmerizing, and painful, can wake us up to considering in what ways we are directing our lives towards similarly unhelpful destinations and what emotional revelations we might need to pursue in order to prevent meeting similar conflicts.\n\nWhat Can We Learn?\n\nSo I’d like to make all of this useful for us in real life.\n\nIn the conclusion, we see Ki Woo mourn his lost life from before. Rewatching the film you see that even in the subterranean home they shared in the beginning, there was vibrancy and comfort that is lost by the end. What little they had in each other is gone. Ki Woo wishes again to become rich, but now his fantasy isn’t to use money to accumulate status but to simply be reunited with his father. With this ending, our attention is directed to what Ki Woo has learned from his tragedy. He recognizes that on his way to attain status, he lost what was truly important to him.\n\nWe don’t know if Ki Woo will achieve his goals, the director has hinted that he won’t – reminding us that for all the time and obsession we give to social mobility it really is very difficult if not impossible to attain.\n\nThe answer to status anxiety is not to simply accept our place on our rung and keep our heads down – but to practice the radical acceptance of our intrinsic, unshakeable worth as a human being outside of what we do, earn, or our style. Instead of running ourselves ragged in the rat race, always scheming to make and do more until we collapse with exhaustion or disillusionment, we can instead treat the root of our anxiety and work to remove ourselves from the narrative of Status Anxiety entirely. Removing ourselves from this unfair narrative will not only help us leave the rat race but can strengthen our sense of community and connection with others since we no longer feel like we’re competing with them to get to the top. Status anxiety can’t be solved by becoming rich, like the Parks – we’d just make new problems and goals for ourselves and worse become blind to those around us or actively try to keep them quarantined from us.\n\nIt takes practice, maybe years of mindfulness, to rewrite our perceptions of money, fame, careers, and status objects. Little by little, with reminders like the one we see in Parasite, we can remind ourselves that our bank accounts are not a faithful indicator of character. Having lots of money or fame is nice, if we have it it doesn’t mean we’re more valuable as a human. We become indifferent to our status we can focus on how to live more mindfully, gratefully, and with more joy.\n\nLike Ki Woo placing the viewing stone into the river at the end, we can realize that the meaning behind the stone – its symbol of status and importance – was just an illusion. Even after its role in the destruction of three families we see that it was really just a rock. Riches are just riches. Reputation is just reputation. Neither completely in our control. This film can be a powerful reminder of the illusions we spend years worrying about and convince us, a little, to let them go.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat’s so scary about this interpretation I’m offering is the idea that some will hear this and think I am saying that the rich should stay rich and the impoverished should just learn to get over it. This is not at all what I’m saying. Living with food, shelter, and utility insecurities is a reality for millions of people and everyone, regardless of their status, should have access to resources that help them fulfill their basic needs. Its an unfortunate reality that many people have to work incredibly hard within a system pitted against them to just survive and there should definitely be systemic changes driven by the everyday citizen like ourselves to appeal to local governments to provide more care for the underprivileged. There is real change needed. All I am trying to address is the emotional and psychological well-being of everyone struggling with status anxiety – in all rungs of society.\n\nI do believe that social mobility is a worthwhile pursuit and we can still work hard and do our best to gain more comforts in life, even if its an uphill and inequitable battle for many, but my message is that we also need to mentally budget for the fact that we live in societies riddled with status obsession and prejudice against the underprivileged. We cannot rely on societies riddled with status anxiety to respect us as we should be respected but we can work to develop a strong sense of self-respect and self-worth regardless of our jobs or bank balances and we can guard ourselves against making high status a prerequisite for self-compassion or happiness.\n\nWe can’t change what others say or do, but we can un-assign meaning from what our homes or closets look like to others. We can learn to shrug off the invisible boundaries and smells the rich talk about, we can ignore the inner voices trained into us telling us we need to accomplish more in order to earn or be worthy of admiration from ourselves or others. We can curate our happiness and self-respect within ourselves and for ourselves.\n\nLastly, If we no longer make high status or praise a prerequisite for our happiness or sense of identity we’ll discover the freedom to live a simple life happily. We can unlock the freedom of never having to prove our worth to others or hurt others in a competition for status but to enjoy our lives as they are while also setting future goals that aren’t fueled by an obsession with high esteem and status.\n\nIn the end, the tragedy Parasite reminds us that the system is inherently unfair and that there is an undercurrent of status anxiety we all feel that feeds the imaginary and hurtful boundaries of status and respect. We’re reminded to, of course, take action in our lives to take care of ourselves and our loved ones, and to help those struggling as the Kims are, but we can also use this film as a reminder to soothe our status anxiety once in a while so that it doesn’t motivate us into abandoning our integrity or self-compassion.\n\nTaking inspiration from the tragedy of the Kims, we can place our own viewing stones back into the river and remember what truly matters in life.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nI’ll be trying to re-upload the video sometime in March 2022, as well.\n\nBibliography\n\nJanicke-Bowles, S.
