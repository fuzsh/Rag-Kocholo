        "text": "Crystal Mun-hye Baik (she/her) is Associate Professor in the Department of Gender and Sexuality Studies at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). She is a co-founding member of the Ending the Korean War Teaching Collective; a Lead Researcher of Critical Pedagogy & Publications at UCR’s Memory & Resistance Laboratory (MEM-RES); and a co-editor of the Critical Militarization Studies book series with Dr. Anjali Nath at the University of Michigan Press. Dr. Baik’s first book, Reencounters: On the Korean War & Diasporic Memory Critique (Temple University Press, 2020) examines what it means to live with and remember the ongoing Korean War when its everyday manifestations – hypervisible and deeply sensed – are delinked from militarization. Dr. Baik offers the concept of reencounters to better track how the Korean War’s illegible entanglements impact daily life through a diasporic feminist memory archive that includes oral history projects, live performance, and video installations. Currently, Dr. Baik is working on two sole-authored book projects, including Unsanctioned Knowledges: The Life and Labor of Korean Diasporic Feminist Activists, and the Grief Archive. She has edited special issues that focus on the Cold War, Asian Diasporas, and the impact of militarization for Periscope (Social Text), Amerasia, and the Critical Ethnic Studies Journal (forthcoming winter 2023), and she is also a co-editor of Detours: A Decolonial Guide to Korea (Duke University Press).\n\nPresentations offered by Professor Baik:\n\nThe Work of Mending – The Korean War and Diasporic Memory Work\n\nWhat does it mean to remember the Korean War as ongoing and indefinite? What kinds of cultural memory practices, or memory work, might be culled to register the war’s site-specific manifestations – too often perceived as something other than war— across a diasporic geography? Lastly, how might memory work reckon with a militarized colonial present in Korea, the Pacific, and Oceania, while also enacting expansive visions of a demilitarized reparative future? While this talk considers a broad scale of Korean diasporic cultural memory works that have emerged these past two decades (including live performance, graphic novels, oral history, film, and installation), I place special focus on the feminist multimedia oeuvre of Jane Jin Kaisen (https://janejinkaisen.com/). In the talk, I address the praxis of mending in Kaisen’s work (weaving, spinning, braiding, shamanic rituals, caregiving), a gendered form of labor that accounts for how war, militarized violence, and capitalist extraction has unevenly impacted different spaces, bodies, and communities. More specifically, by engaging with an emergent genealogy of multimedia works that center the audacity of critical care and connection against US-South Korean bilateral policies of occupation and separation (Community of Parting, The Pull of the Moon, Braiding and Mending, Burial of this Order, Offering – Coil Embrace), this talk considers the reparative work of mending taken up by peripheralized figures – Korean female shamans in Jeju-do, transnational adoptees in Korea and Western Europe, and communities residing in the Korean DMZ area – who simultaneously bear the disproportionate burden of war, militarization, and division.\n\nThe Grief Archive – The Korean War and Mourning Beyond Melancholia\n\nIn Seeing Like a Child: Inheriting the Korean War (Fordham University Press 2021), Clara Han powerfully addresses the worldmaking capacity of the Korean War. In the book, Han insists that the effects of the Korean War are not traumatic ruptures inherited by younger generations but active dynamics that (re)create the worlds we inhabit across geographical, temporal, and generational lines.\n\nTaking cue from Han’s work, this talk considers how a constellation of recently published or developing academic monographs and cultural works – Han’s book alongside Stephen Sohn’s Minor Salvage: The Korean War and Korean American Life Writings (University of Michigan Press, 2022), Grace Cho’s Tastes Like War (2021), and my own emergent writing on familial loss and grief – examines the Korean War as it continues to make and unmake the intimate worlds we navigate. In particular, this talk begins to piece together a working paradigm of grief that converses with and departs from how mourning is typically discussed within Transnational Asian/American studies: through the Freudian lens of racial melancholia and as a by-product of the racialized gendered formation of the US settler nation-state. In contrast, I explore how this grief archive gestures to a transborder articulation of loss and grieving and considers crucial elements that cannot be wholly relegated to the national borders of the United States or Korea.\n\nDr. Ruediger FRANK is Professor of East Asian Economy and Society at the University of Vienna, where he is also the Director of the European Centre for North Korean Studies. He was born and raised in socialist East Germany and lived for five years in the Soviet Union in the 1970s, experienced German unification first hand as a 21-year-old in 1989/1990, and then spent one semester as a language student at Kim-Il-Sung University in Pyongyang in 1991/1992. He holds an MA in Korean Studies and International Relations, and a PhD in Economics. On the basis of these skills and experiences, he has written extensively on various topics related to North Korea, including economic history during the 1950s, the connections between ideology and economic reform after the 1990s famine, the transformation of state-socialism, tourism and trade, the political economy of unification, and many more. He has been working in various Korea-related councils of the World Economic Forum since 2011~2021 and was named one of the 50 most influential German economists by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in 2012. He tweets as @RFrankVienna.\n\nPresentations offered by Professor Frank:\n\nGrowth or Decline of North Korea’s Economy? A Discussion Based on the Annual SPA Budget Reports\n\nGrowth or Decline of North Korea’s Economy? A Discussion Based on the Annual SPA Budget Reports This talk deals with some of the practical problems in North Korea research, in particular the acquisition and interpretation of aggregate quantitative data. Using the example of GDP figures, it will be shown which sources exist, what their strengths and weaknesses are, and how scholars try to deal with them.\n\nComparing German and Korean Unification: Challenges and Pitfalls\n\nThis talk deals broadly with the comparison of the German unification case (1990) and the expected Korean unification. It argues that such a comparison is risky and should be undertaken with utmost caution, in order to avoid misleading results that could lead to ineffective or damaging policy choices. It identifies a large number of specific issues where differences are substantial, including geopolitical, economic, and ideological aspects.\n\nChallenging the Korean Fear of High Costs: German Unification as an Economic Win-Win Situation\n\nThis talk focuses on the question of unification costs, which is one of the major concerns especially among South Koreans when it comes to discussing the issue of Korean unification. It challenges the conventional narrative that German unification was extremely costly, and argues that it has in fact resulted in quantitative economic gains for all involved sides.\n\nHow Can External Actors Increase the Likelihood of Economic Reforms in North Korea: An Analysis Based on the CRE Model\n\nThis talk addresses the question of how to increase the likelihood of a deep and broad economic reform drive in North Korea. Rather than doing so based on an ad-hoc interpretation of isolated events or randomly available data, it will attempt to take a systematic approach. The CRE model helps to break down a very broad question into smaller, more precise tasks. As a result, it will be shown that efforts directed at the elite and the middle class, and aimed at increasing perceived gains from reforms and losses from non-reforms, are the most promising measures. This sheds a new light on various policies applied by the West including economic sanctions and summitry with the top leader, and helps explaining the rationale behind current North Korean policies such as inward-orientation and fight against cultural infiltration.\n\nRudiger Frank currently has the following number of speaking engagement opportunities available in his term on the NEAC DSB:\n\n3 engagements between April 1, 2022-March 31, 2023\n\n3 engagements between April 1, 2023-March 31, 2024\n\n3 engagements between April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025\n\nChristina Klein is a cultural historian and film scholar whose research interests include US-Korean encounters, the Korean Wave, the cultural Cold War in Asia, gender, and historical memory. Her most recent book, Cold War Cosmopolitanism: Period Style in 1950s Korea Cinema (University of California, 2020) explores the cinematic representation of women in the tumultuous postwar period. She has published articles on the CIA-funded Asia Foundation, the globalization of film industries, why American studies scholars should pay attention to Korean cinema, and the martial arts film. Her first book, Cold War Orientalism: Asia in the Middlebrow Imagination, 1945-1961 (University of California, 2003) examines how American cultural producers cultivated a sense of political obligation to non-communist Asia by deploying a sentimental discourse of connection. She earned a BA in Film Studies from Wesleyan and a PhD in American Studies from Yale. She is a professor of English and member of the Asian Studies faculty at Boston College.\n\nPresentations offered by Professor Klein:\n\n“The Feminine 1950s: Social Change and Popular Culture in the Postwar Period”\n\nThe 1950s has been something of a “lost decade” within South Korean historiography, wedged as it is between the two longer periods of colonialism and developmental militarism. Recent scholarship, however, has revealed the postwar period to have been a time of rapid and contentious social change, during which women played an important role. The Korean War and the waging of the cultural Cold War spurred the movement of women out of the home and into public life, where they took on new roles as college students, breadwinners, entertainers, and feminists. This talk explores how these changes caused women to become the focal point for highly-charged debates about modernization and Westernization. It focuses on how popular culture, especially film, served as an arena in which these debates took place and it charts the rise of the woman-centered melodrama as the era’s most popular, and representative, genre. This talk will help students understand how the study of popular culture can illuminate aspects of women’s history that can be difficult to access through traditional archival sources.\n\nRemembering the Korean War: Film and Historical Memory\n\nThe Korean War was a deeply traumatic event that shaped the lives and psyches of tens of millions of people across multiple generations. Over the past seventy years it has been memorialized through statues, museums, and numerous other forms of cultural expression. This talk explores the concept of “historical memories”: acts of public remembering that link the past to the present and invite use to interrogate the nature of the relationship between them. It investigates how the Korean War has been remembered on film, comparing how movies produced decades apart have depicted specific aspects of the war while also conveying the concerns and perspectives of their own historical moments. The films under discussion include The Marines Who Never Returned (1961), which was produced during the peak of the Cold War; Welcome to Dongmakgol (2005), which was made during the Sunshine Policy period; and Swing Kids (2018), which is a product of the cosmopolitan hallyu era. How does each film identify South Korea’s enemies? How does it define the country’s allies? How does it characterize the issues at stake in the war? By asking and answering these questions, we can see how understandings of the war’s significance have changed dramatically over time and have been shaped by the concerns of the present as much as by events of the past.\n\nParasite, Squid Game, BTS: The Globalization of Korean Popular Culture\n\nIn the years between 2019 and 2021, Korean popular culture achieved an unparalleled degree of global visibility, critical attention, and popular success. Parasite took top awards at Cannes and the Academy Awards, Squid Game occupied the number one slot on Netflix, and BTS sold out stadium shows and broke records worldwide. How did this happen? This talk charts the history of the Korean Wave (hallyu) from its origins in the late 1990s to the present. It discusses the role of government support, export-oriented production, the globalization of media companies, the impact of social media, the creation of new forms of fandom, the influence of the American market in conferring status, and the development of culturally hybrid styles.\n\nChristina Klein currently has the following number of speaking engagement opportunities available in her term on the NEAC DSB:\n\n3 engagements between April 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023\n\n3 engagements between April 1, 2023 and March 31 2024\n\n3 engagements between April 1, 2024 and March 31 2025\n\nYoujeong Oh is Associate Professor in the Department of Asian Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Her book, Pop City: Korean Popular Culture and the Selling of Place (Cornell, 2018), explores how Korean municipalities have used Korean TV dramas and K-pop music in their placeand tourism promotion. Her current research is about (over)development, dispossession, and desires in Jeju. Her other research interests include urban social movements, colonization through development, decolonization, indigenous resurgence, and media, tourism, and place in East Asia. Her work has been published in the International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, Tourism Geographies, Media, Culture & Society, and the Journal of Korean Studies. She received a Ph.D. in Geography from UC Berkeley.\n\nPresentations offered by Professor Oh:\n\nDevelopment, Dispossession, and Desires in Jeju\n\nJeju has been a target of tourism and mega real estate development since the 1960s. Under the banner of making Jeju into the “Hawai’i of Korea,” tourism development in the 1980s and 1990screated multiple leisure complexes, golf courses, resort towns, and theme parks. Built through land expropriation, dispossession of the commons and communal resources, the disintegration of collective village economies, relaxed land use and environmental regulations, and the commodification of culture and landscapes, the tourism development in Jeju has brought windfall profits to the mainland capitalists who participated in it as developers, investors, and facility owners. Aiming to cultivate Jeju as a regional hub able to compete with Hong Kong or Singapore, Jeju Free International City Development has initiated several mega-urban projects since the mid-2000s such as Jeju Global Education City, Healthcare Town, Myth and History Park, and Yerae Resort Town. Tolerating relaxed forms of visa regulation, taxation, labor and environmental regulation, for-profit healthcare and education, and casinos, Jeju is now an international capitalist frontier where extremely mobile transnational capital drains developmental profits out of the island. Disputing the conventional belief that tourism/urban development benefits Jeju, this talk provides critical analyses of how speculative development projects have colonized the island since the 1960s through dispossession, extraction, and exclusion. Despite the obvious negative impacts of mega-development, the state’s and societal entrenched desires for “development (baljeon)” complicate the situation.\n\nDetours on Jeju: Painful Histories and Decolonial Activism Behind the Tourist Paradise\n\nAs part of Jeju Olle Trail Route 10 and one of the best photo spots on the island, Songaksan boasts dazzling ocean views. But behind the scenic landscapes lie multiple intersecting histories of violence and pain. By confiscating local farmers’ land and forcibly mobilizing Jeju people, the Imperial Japanese Navy constructed Alddreu Airfield, which was used as Japan’s forward operating base during its invasion of China and as the last line of defense during the Pacific War. One anti-aircraft artillery camp built at that time became a site of mass killing during the April Uprising and Massacre under the US military occupation. After the United States Air Force (USAF) utilized the site during the Korean War, the Ministry of National Defense took it over andhas continued to own the land until today. Recently Chinese capital has purchased a vast amount of land near Songaksan and promoted the construction of a mega-resort, which involves the risk of severe environmental destruction and landscape privatization. This talk delves into Songaksan’s contentious histories fraught with colonialism, war, militarism, developmentalism, and encroachment by foreign capital. On the other hand, Songaksan is also aplace of activism, decolonial collective praxis, and a vision of alternative development. In the late 1980s, residents rose up against the planned construction of a new military base and year-long protests eventually nullified the plan. The massacre site has been revisited by dark tour participants who have looked back at the violent past and learned lessons from it. Recently, the Clean Jeju Songak Declaration was announced, promising to restrict rampant development projects and preserve the area’s historical, cultural, and environmental values. By telling stories of resistance and the rejection of militarism, tourism, and dispossession, this talk also evokes decolonial encounters with the place. Unsettling the notion that Jeju is a tourist paradise, this presentation introduces new ways of learning, experiencing, and feeling the island. The rich andpowerful documentation of Songaksan’s densely layered and hidden histories leads audiences to think about broader questions of militarism, developmentalism, and predatory capitalism in Jeju and Korea.\n\nImagine Your Korea: Experiences and Effects of K-Pop Tourism\n\nThe globalization of K-pop is not only about outward expansion with more export market penetration. The outward circulation of Korean entertainment has spawned inbound global flows by drawing in its audience as tourists and shoppers. As Korean popular culture functions as a window through which audiences come to know South Korea, specific places within the country have emerged as physical sites through which K-culture experiences can be extended. Even though they do not offer any of the traditional touristic opportunities for sightseeing, heritage, or leisure, K-pop-related places are newly rising as tourist destinations: they include sites where K-pop groups filmed music videos and had album jacket photo shoots, places frequented by K-pop idols, or stores offering K-pop merchandise. This talk navigates specific practices of K-pop tourism: what motivates fans to visit Korea, what specific destinations exercise an attraction for them, and how they experience K-pop-related places. Belatedly recognizing the explosive power of K-pop-induced mobilities, Korean municipalities have startedto employ K-pop and K-pop artists in their tourism promotion. Although the pandemic blocked opportunities for K-pop groups to hold overseas concerts, it led to various places in Korea being featured in prerecorded performances that were broadcast across the globe. The second part ofthe talk presents the specific practices, developments, impacts, and limitations of K-pop-themed place promotion. In both the practices of K-pop tourism and promotions of K-pop-featured places, the K-pop fans’ roles are critical in terms of reconfiguring, enriching, and publicizing the socially constructed meanings of places."
