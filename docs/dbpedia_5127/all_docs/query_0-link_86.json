He started working as a migrant worker in an RMG factory. The employees there had to work in a horrible and hazardous environment and Mahbub decided to voice against the horrendous conditions.\n\nSeven months later his mother died but Mahbub was adamant about changing his fate.\n\nThe actor started to participate in seminars and social movements with the workers.\n\nIn order to gain media coverage for the movement, Mahbub started to make documentaries to expose the unhygienic conditions of South Korean RMG industries. Those documentaries were broadcast on several national media of South Korea.\n\nFrom the initiative of 10â€”12 migrant workers including Mahbub himself, they were able to launch the \"Migrant Worker's Television\" in South Korea in 2004. They even hosted a film festival in 2006 where Mahbub acted as the director of the festival.\n\nMahbub's debuted in acting with a role in the short film \"The Road of Revenge\" and soon the actor gained international recognition with his performance in \"Bandhobi,\" his first feature film.\n\n\"Bandhobi\" was made with a budget of Tk3 crore only and focused on the love story of a migrant Karim and a Korean lady. The film highlighted different problems of the migrant workers\n\nThe 40-year-old actor has made an incredible career in South Korea by starring in 15 South Korean films, TV dramas and advertisements."
