        "text": "A recent U.S. Surgeon General’s report indicated that only 17% of Asian Americans with a psychological problem sought professional help and less than 6% sought this help from a mental health treatment provider (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). One approach to addressing this problem is for Asian American clients to be served by ethnically and linguistically matched mental health professionals. However, pragmatically speaking, ethnically and linguistically matched health delivery is rare and not available in all geographic locations. Moreover, the vast majority of mental health providers are European American. For example, according to a recent study, 87.5% of psychologists who are service providers are European American, whereas 3.6% are Hispanic, 2.7% are Black, 1.7% are Asian/Pacific Islander, and less than 1.0% are Native American (American Psychological Association Center for Workforce Studies, 2009). In addition, even among Asian Americans seeking services at an ethnicity-specific agency, approximately 33% of clients miss a scheduled intake appointment (Akutsu & Chu, 2006) and 10% to 22% of clients drop out of treatment after the intake (Akutsu, Tsuru, & Chu, 2004).\n\nTherefore, another approach to addressing the pattern of under-utilization of psychological services by Asian Americans is to examine ways in which non–Asian American counselors, especially European American counselors, can provide more culturally relevant and sensitive services to clients with an Asian American background. As a matter of fact, an expanding body of theoretical literature highlights the importance of multicultural counseling competence in producing positive counseling process and outcome (e.g., Ponterotto, Casas, Suzuki, & Alexander, 2010; Pope-Davis, Coleman, Liu, & Toporek, 2003).\n\nThe increasing visibility of multicultural counseling competence as a topic of interest in research, practice, and training has led to a greater understanding of the potential components of multicultural competence that counselors can acquire in order to provide effective services to clients who are culturally different from themselves. Originally developed by Sue et al. (1982); revised by Sue, Arredondo, and McDavis (1992); and further operationalized by Arredondo et al. (1996), multicultural counseling competencies have been proposed to represent three characteristics: (a) being aware of assumptions, values and biases; (b) understanding the worldview of the culturally different client; and (c) developing appropriate intervention strategies and techniques. Each of these characteristics comprises three domains (attitudes/beliefs, knowledge, and skills), and there are 31 competencies across these domains.\n\nHowever, the literature on multicultural counseling competencies has been consistently criticized for lacking empirical support and validation (Atkinson & Israel, 2003). Research literature has been scant in terms of examining whether these competencies lead to increased effectiveness in cross-cultural counseling process and outcome. Atkinson and Israel (2003) concluded that the successful policy changes resulting from the multicultural counseling competence movement actually took place without strong empirical evidence. Thus, to address this significant limitation, one could begin to study the multicultural counseling competencies in the context of a counseling session. Specifically, we focused our attention on the seven competencies under the skills domain of intervention strategies and techniques. These competencies span from verbal and nonverbal communication skills to language, consultation, testing, psychoeducation, and client advocacy skills. In the present study, we compared a session that used these competencies with a session that lacked these competencies.\n\nThe third approach to addressing early termination or limited usage of mental health services by Asian Americans is to consider client characteristics that may come into play during the process of counseling, such as client cultural beliefs or attitudes. Ting and Hwang (2009) suggested identifying both environmental and population factors as determinants of mental health services utilization; for Asian Americans, cultural variables may include level of acculturation (i.e., the degree to which individuals adhere to the cultural norms of the dominant society). Asian American individuals vary with regard to the extent of their acculturation to dominant European American cultural norms of the United States, such as individuality and independence (Wolfe, Yang, Wong, & Atkinson, 2001). Researchers have examined Asian and Asian American acculturation and utilization of psychological services. Frey and Roysircar (2006) found that in a study on Asian international students, the more acculturated South Asian students reported greater utilization of help resources.\n\nIn addition to acculturation, writers have pointed out that enculturation (i.e., the degree to which persons retain the norms of their culture of origin) may influence client factors that play out in counseling, such as emotional expressiveness, attitude toward seeking psychological help, and beliefs regarding relationships (e.g., Sue & Sue, 2003; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). These authors have posited that one’s adherence to traditional Asian cultural values, which include hierarchical relationships, collectivism, and achievement orientation, could have an important role in the counseling process with Asian American clients.\n\nIt is interesting, however, that studies examining clients’ enculturation and the effect on counseling process have had mixed results. On the one hand, some investigations found that less enculturated Asian Americans compared with more enculturated Asian Americans rated their counselors as more empathic (Kim & Atkinson, 2002). On the other hand, some studies found that more enculturated Asian American clients compared with less enculturated clients gave higher counselor ratings (Kim, Li, & Liang, 2002; Kim, Ng, & Ahn, 2005). Furthermore, other studies found no relationship between client’s degree of enculturation and session outcome (Kim et al., 2003; Li & Kim, 2004). Although there are many possible reasons for these inconsistent findings, one possibility is that the various dimensions within Asian cultural values (e.g., emotional self-control vs. humility) may have different effects on mental health service delivery, depending on which values were salient during the counseling process. For example, the value of emotional self-control has been identified as a potential negative predictor of successful counseling process. Asian Americans with high adherence to emotional self-control may feel less comfortable discussing personal issues than do their counterparts who do not firmly endorse emotional self-control; subsequently, this values conflict would negatively affect clients’ perception of the therapist’s empathy and of agreed-on counseling goals and tasks.\n\nDespite the literature on Asian American acculturation and enculturation and mental health services, there are gaps that need to be filled. First, measurement of acculturation and enculturation can be problematic. For example, using proxy variables (e.g., assessing English versus Asian language as the client’s language of choice; Akutsu et al., 2004) is not ideal, nor is conceptualizing acculturation and enculturation as being mostly based on behaviors instead of values (e.g. Zhang & Dixon, 2001). Furthermore, acculturation and enculturation are often conceptualized as two ends of the same bidirectional construct (e.g. Ting & Hwang, 2009) rather than being seen as independent, as the concept of biculturalism would suggest (Berry, 1980). Also, because many of these studies on Asian cultural values simply examined client attitudes toward seeking counseling services, we aimed to study cultural values in the context of a therapeutic interaction. Furthermore, we were interested in operationalizing and examining multicultural competence as manifested in therapist interventions. Investigations along these lines could clarify the role of culture and cultural competence in Asian American clients’ immediate experiences of therapy, and, in doing so, perhaps help explain Asian American utilization rates of psychological services.\n\nThus, we created an analogue design study to focus centrally on therapist multicultural counseling skills and participant cultural values. According to the principles of research design, the artificiality of an analogue experimental design is suitable for an area of research with little previous empirical knowledge (Heppner, Kivlighan, & Wampold, 2008). The experimental variable in our study was session type: either supportive counseling with multicultural competencies or supportive counseling alone. The other independent variables were participant adherence to the Asian cultural value dimension of emotional self-control and adherence to European American cultural values.\n\nIn terms of the dependent variables, we chose perceived counselor empathy and client–counselor working alliance to garner participant perceptions of counseling process. These variables were chosen because they are considered good indicators of effective counseling process and outcome (Heppner et al., 2008). For example, a meta-analysis found that 54% (72% when measured by client perceptions) of studies showed a positive relationship between empathy and outcome (Orlinsky, Grawe, & Parks, 1994). Similarly, we measured working alliance, one of the common factors of psychotherapy that is necessary for change (e.g. Wampold, 2001). It can be reasoned that working alliance plays an important role in increasing the rates of Asian Americans who remain in counseling and therapy services.\n\nIn the present study, we hypothesized that the supportive counseling condition containing the seven multicultural counseling skills competencies will be rated higher on session outcome (i.e., working alliance and counselor empathy) than the supportive counseling condition that does not contain the competencies (Hypothesis 1). Regarding the possible relations between participant enculturation and acculturation on counseling process, we hypothesized that there would be an inverse relation between adherence to emotional self-control and session outcome (Hypothesis 2) and a positive relation between adherence to European American values and session outcome (Hypothesis 3). In addition, we examined the potential moderating roles of participant adherence to emotional self-control and adherence to European American values on the relation between type of counseling (presence or absence of the skills competencies) and session outcome. Given the dearth of empirical research on this issue, we could not generate hypotheses in any particular direction regarding these interaction effects.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present study used a video analogue design to test the potential effects of multicultural counseling competency and client values on Asian Americans’ evaluation of counseling process. The t test results yielded support for considering multiculturally competent interventions as a useful strategy in counseling process. This finding reinforces previous findings that multiculturally skilled therapy interventions positively influence ratings of general competence. For example, Zhang and Dixon (2001) found that Asian international student clients rated culturally responsive counselors higher than culturally neutral counselors in expertness, attractiveness, and trustworthiness; cultural responsiveness was operationalized as including diverse Asian crafts and pictures as décor, greeting the clients in their native language, and inquiring about behavioral differences between the United States and countries of origin. Also, the current results extend the findings of Fuertes et al. (2006), who surveyed cross-cultural therapy dyads at university counseling centers and discovered positive relationships between perception of therapist multicultural competence and perceptions of therapist empathy, working alliance, and satisfaction with counseling. Although Zhang and Dixon did not examine multicultural counseling competencies per se and Fuertes et al. did not manipulate their competency variable, the existing literature, combined with our findings, offers helpful information on the importance of incorporating multicultural competencies when working with Asian American clients.\n\nThe results also showed that the participant adherence to emotional self-control was inversely related to the counseling process. However, this result should be considered tentative, because although the total shared variance was significant according to the correlational analysis, the unique shared variance when considered alone was not significant as shown by the regression analysis. Notwithstanding this important limitation, the observed inverse association supports the importance of studying specific Asian value orientations in therapy process and outcome research as suggested by Kim, Li, and Ng (2005). Our study puts forth the importance of considering client cultural values in establishing a strong therapeutic relationship. In other words, when working with Asian American clients who value emotional self-control, it would be important for practitioners to be sensitive to clients’ potential discomfort or inexperience with sharing personal problems with a professional counselor and to perhaps discuss clients’ views about attending therapy early on in the therapeutic process. It might also be helpful for practitioners to recognize the challenge of discussing sensitive cultural issues such as racism and discrimination and, subsequently, activating distressful feelings in both the client and the counselor, thereby further contributing to a negative appraisal of therapy.\n\nIn terms of the observed positive relation between acculturation to European American values and counseling process, this result also should be considered tentative because, like the result regarding participant adherence to emotional self-control, the significant relation was only observed with total shared variance and not with unique shared variance alone. Notwithstanding this important limitation, this finding is consistent with previous research (e.g., Tata & Leong, 1994). The current results echo the findings of Kim, Ng, and Ahn (2005), who found that Asian American participants’ adherence to European American values was positively associated with ratings of working alliance and session depth. Moreover, these associations can be explained by the findings of Mallinckrodt, Shigeoka, and Suzuki (2005), who found a positive correlation between client acculturation and counselor etiology beliefs, suggesting that acculturation may cultivate positive counseling process because of greater degree of match between client and counselor mental health worldviews and an agreed-on explanation of presenting problems.\n\nAs in all research, there are important limitations to the present study. First, given that the results were not robust in that the multiple regression analysis failed to replicate the findings from the t test and correlational analyses, the present study may have lacked adequate statistical power. Consistent with this idea, the observed effect sizes for the t test and correlations were small according to Cohen’s definitions. Therefore, we recommend that future studies ensure that there is adequate power. One avenue to ensuring adequate power is to enlarge the effect size by increasing the length of the therapy segment and to include more statements of multicultural competence. In addition, modifying how the session type variable is operationalized would be important because some of the theorized interventions of multicultural competence also may be perceived as a part of supportive counseling (e.g., appropriate eye contact, psychoeducation regarding therapy process). As for the cultural values variables, it would be important to include participants that similarly reflect the entire range of enculturation and acculturation variables (note that the majority of our sample comprised second-generation individuals). Furthermore, the use of larger sample sizes also would increase the statistical power for both the session type and the cultural values variables.\n\nAs for other limitations, the client depicted in the counseling vignette was visibly East Asian, although the Asian population, including the sample used for the present study, is quite heterogeneous. We also acknowledge that completing the manipulation check from a third-party perspective may have lessened the potency of the ratings and was discrepant with completing the other instruments as if the respondent was the client of the video. Also, the relatively low internal reliability for the EAVS–AA–R score may pose a threat to statistical conclusion validity. Finally, the use of a nonclient, West Coast college student sample limits the study’s generalizability; more research needs to be done to assess the applicability of these findings to real therapy clients and to a more diverse population in terms of age and geographic location.\n\nThe present results also raise a question regarding the essence of multicultural competencies. The significant relationship between multicultural competence and client-perceived working alliance and empathy suggests the possibility that a component of multicultural competence may be deeper alliance and empathy. Thus, in future studies, researchers could study multicultural competencies compared with alliance- and empathy-focused interventions or therapist alliance and empathy as mediating variables of multicultural therapeutic alliance and therapist characteristics. Future research could also use Asian Americans participants in a control group study, or Asian Americans could be surveyed on their experiences and evaluation of therapy.\n\nIn terms of practice implications, the present findings provide tentative support for incorporating multicultural skills in therapy, such as having sensitivity to issues of oppression, and providing psychoeducation regarding the psychotherapy process. Also, our results reinforce the importance of considering client characteristics in building and maintaining an effective counseling process. With Asian American clients in particular, it would be helpful for therapists to be aware of the potential effects of clients valuing emotional self-control and of clients acculturating to European American values salient to so many Asian Americans. In terms of training, these findings promote the teaching of multiculturally competent skills in introductory counseling skills. Finally, our conclusions underscore the importance of learning how to build the working alliance and empathy quickly. Furthermore, they remind counselors that within the same racial or ethnic group affiliation, clients bring their unique and multidimensional cultural identities to the process of mental health services engagement."
