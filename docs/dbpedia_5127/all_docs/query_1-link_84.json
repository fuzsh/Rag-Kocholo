        "text": "Originally published in May 2019.\n\nI'm Korean. Well, Korean-Canadian to be more specific.\n\nI was born in Korea and immigrated here when I was five years old. I can speak the language fluently (albeit clumsily), I can make a mean kimchi stew, and noraebang (Korean karaoke) is my religion.\n\nBut last summer, I stumbled upon an article that made me question how Korean I really am.\n\nWritten by Euny Hong for the now-defunct publication Lenny Letter, the article, called Kimchi Temper, mentioned a Korean word I'd never heard of before: han (한 / 恨).\n\nKorean rage\n\nIt said han is a potent form of Korean rage — a type of anger so severe and all-consuming that some believe you can die from it.\n\nWhen I dug a little deeper, I was surprised to discover that han is not just a word, but an inherent part of being Korean. Some say it runs in our blood and is embedded in our DNA.\n\n[Han] is often described as an internalized feeling of deep sorrow, resentment, grief, regret and anger.\n\nIn fact, it's so Korean that there's no equivalent for it in the English language.\n\nAlthough han is considered indefinable, it is often described as an internalized feeling of deep sorrow, resentment, grief, regret and anger. Scholars say it's a uniquely Korean characteristic borne out of the country's long history of invasion, oppression and suffering.\n\nThe more I read about han, the more confused and, frankly, embarrassed I felt. I couldn't believe it had taken me so long to learn about this concept that supposedly affects all Koreans.\n\nAccording to Michael Shin, a professor of Korean history at the University of Cambridge, han is pervasive in pop culture and everyday life. It's frequently explored in Korean literature, art and film, and is casually brought up in conversation.\n\n\"People will mention it… in seemingly sort of mundane ways — a parent talking to a child saying, 'If you don't get into a good college, I will have han,'\" he explained.\n\nTo Shin, han is a symbol of division in Korea, a painful reminder of the border between the North and South that has separated families for over six decades.\n\n\"I tend to define it as a situation where you have this overwhelming traumatic experience that causes you to lose your collective identity,\" he said.\n\nWhen I asked Shin if han is intergenerational, he said as long as the peninsula remains divided, Koreans will be able to feel it because they \"don't feel quite whole in this divided country.\"\n\nIf han can be passed down through generations and is felt by every Korean, I wondered if my family had it.\n\nCould I have it?\n\nThe Korean-Canadian dream\n\nMy family immigrated to Canada in 2000. My father, a long-time broadcast journalist, had a lofty vision of starting a radio station for the Korean-Canadian community with a single goal in mind: to remind immigrants of home.\n\nOnly two years after our arrival, he and a team of young producers opened RadioSeoul — the first Korean-language radio station in Canada.\n\nI remember my parents working themselves to the bone to keep their dream alive.\n\nBut after five years of dealing with declining ad revenue, the radio station was no longer sustainable. They had no choice but to fold it and move on.\n\nMy father pursued new opportunities abroad, first in the U.S., and eventually Korea. My mother stayed with me and my brother in Toronto as long as she could. But after my father had several health scares in Korea, she had to make the difficult decision to go back to care for him. She left my 20-year-old brother and me, aged 14, behind in Canada.\n\n\"I felt like I had failed as a mother,\" she told me.\n\nI had thought han was a kind of over-the-top fiery rage. But to my mother, han is the regret she feels, tinged with sadness, from having to live apart from her children.\n\nA solitary adolescence\n\nAfter my mother returned to Korea in 2009, I kept myself busy with school, sports, clubs and part-time jobs to keep the loneliness at bay.\n\nBut I dreaded the holidays, especially my birthday. I became accustomed to spending them with friends and their families, who welcomed me with open arms and without asking too many questions.\n\nConversations with my father about our separation — or feelings in general — are few and far between, even though our family has lived on two different continents for over a decade now.\n\nBut when I finally asked my father if he thought I had han, his answer caught me off-guard.\n\nHe told me we should've spent more time together and made more memories as a family. He said as the years go by, the sadness and regret I feel from our time apart will eventually turn into my own version of han.\n\nThe perfect word\n\nWhen I spoke to Michael Shin, he said han is a term that expresses the pain and trauma of Korean families divided across the border.\n\nIt's liberating to be able to put a name to the emotions I've felt for so long.\n\nMaybe now I finally have a word to describe my own parallel experience — of being separated from my family across continents.\n\nIt's liberating to be able to put a name to the emotions I've felt for so long.\n\nA better way of defining han\n\nMy father explained that han is an emotion that words can't capture. You can't feel it by reading someone else's article or essay, but rather by watching films and listening to songs, like Arirang — Korea's unofficial national anthem.\n\nHe said it's the perfect symbol of what han means to Koreans. If you listen closely to the lyrics, you can hear a mix of Korean emotions: sorrow, joy, yearning.\n\nArirang was the first Korean song I ever learned and the only one I still know by heart. As a child, I never really understood what it was about.\n\nBut now, maybe I do.\n\nHan in Korean popular culture"
