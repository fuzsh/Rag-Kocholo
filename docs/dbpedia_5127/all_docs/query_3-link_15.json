        "text": "Since South Korean cinema has been reinvigorated in the 21st century, this national cinema deconstructed classical Western morality in a brutal, honest way…\n\nAlfred Hitchcock allegedly once said that ‘Revenge is sweet and not fattening.’ and cinema often abides by this notion. Whether it’s detective Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (1971, Don Siegel) or, more recently, a bunch of Jews getting even with Hitler in Inglourious Basterds (2009, Quentin Tarantino), Hollywood likes to think of revenge as a just action, restoring balance in the universe and returning justice in a world where the law seems too soft on criminals.\n\nNot so much in South Korean cinema, where in recent years one revenge film after the other shocked Western viewers. The most obvious example is of course the revenge trilogy by director Park Chan-wook, as every vengeful protagonist in his films discover that revenge tastes rather bittersweet. On the internet, the interest in South Korean cinema reached it’s all time high when the theme of revenge became more and more associated with this national cinema. With this peculiar observation in mind, I began writing my thesis on the subject, unravelling the mystery of South Korea’s seemingly obsession with getting even.\n\nBefore I could grasp the function and meaning of revenge in this nation’s film industry, I needed to dive into the Korean psyche. Since cinema as an art form is thoroughly connected with society, there must be something in those revenge films that resonates with it’s Korean audience. As it seems, there’s one element that interconnects the Korean revenge flicks, the nation’s history and the experience of it’s people: a feeling of suppressed suffering which is known as the feeling of han. Han is a clinically recognised and exclusively Korean disease that characterizes a typical national mentality and way of living. As long as Koreans remember, they have been suppressed by some foreign power (China, Japan and more implicitly the United States) or lived under some form of dictatorship until late in the 20th century. The misery doesn’t end there. Just when democracy kicks in, they went through a major financial crisis in 1997 which led to massive layoffs, pessimism about the nation’s future, an anti-western nationalistic sentiment and the biggest loan the IMF (International Monetary Fund) ever gave to a country. History hasn’t been kind to the Korean people. Because of this, Koreans created a unique way of dealing with this constant suffering that we call the feeling of han: accepting one’s fate as “the way it has to be” and internalising the raw emotions of sadness, hate and revenge that comes along with this kind of sense of injustice. In a world full of misery, Koreans learned to accept their suffering as an integral part of life.\n\nIn psychology, the notion of revenge fantasies is a well documented reaction to this kind of trauma. Rape victims, for example, find some comforting and escape in these sort of fantasies of bloody revenge. The imagination that the offender is severely punished for his or her wrongdoing relieves the emotional tension and pain. What better way to articulate those fantasies in the visual art form of cinema? In short, after researching the meaning of revenge in Korean cinema for almost a year, I argue that we could explain the meaning of revenge in South Korean cinema in the following way: (1) as a means of catharsis to let loose of the vengeful emotions hidden in the everyday experience of han, (2) a more direct identification with this experience of han, as revenge in Korean cinema often seems impossible or unsatisfying and (3) a deconstruction of classical Western morality where there’s a clear distinction between good and evil.\n\nDuring this research, I focused on three revenge flicks: A Bittersweet Life (2005, Kim Jee-woon), The Chaser (2008, Hong-jin Na) and Bedevilled (2010, Chul-soo Jang). Each of those films were read as an allegory for some national trauma connected with this particular feeling of han. In this way, cinema – even unconsciously for the filmmaker – expresses the need to get even, taking vengeance upon all those dreadful forces who tortured the Korean people. In A Bittersweet Life, Sun-woo’s betrayal towards his boss Kang represents the hypocrisy and trauma of the unique concept of Korean capitalism, where every company – like some sort of Mafia – demands full devotion and is seen as a (pseudo-)familial enterprise while employers fired a massive amount of employees in order to downsize and save expenses. The Korean tradition gets mixed up with a Western capitalist ideology where money means everything, resulting in a sort of “compressed modernity”: the West stands for the future and South-Korea’s hope in building a successful nation, but there’s not a country in the world where you could impose a way of living and thinking if the culture isn’t compatible with the aspiring ideology. It’s what in the domain of political theory they call “path dependency”: just like characters in most film noirs, nobody – even countries – can escape from their past. This is also true for most of the protagonists in these revenge films. Sun-woo, in his betrayal towards his superior represents such mixture of Western values (liberal Western notions such as a right to live, for he refuses to kill Kang’s mistress) and tradition (in the end, Sun-woo takes vengeance because he’s heartbroken that the traditional contract with Kang is broken). In a similar fashion, Na’s The Chaser depicts the downfall of social cohesion in the modern (westernised) cityscape and the vicious nature of Western Christianity symbolised by the killer Young-min. In Bedevilled, the transformation of our vengeful protagonist Bok-nam represents the transformation from a pre- to a modern South Korean nation. She’ll soon find out that this transformation is ultimately destructive for everyone except for the state’s wealth and ideological power.\n\nBut let’s not waste any more time (and space) on this ‘reading into’ these specific national traumas. They are, obviously, of vital importance to understand the reason why revenge seems to be such a popular topic in this nation’s cinema, but there’s something going on of major importance in these flicks that – perhaps – explain their popularity all over the world: the courage to deconstruct classical Western morality and conservative notions of good and evil. Scientific research hints at the possibility that revenge in fiction may cultivate us to believe in a ‘just world’: the understanding of the universe as a place where we can rest assure that good triumphs over evil. After all, this same research proves that people feel relieved and are pleased even more when a movie depicts an out of control and unproportional payback when compared with a more modest or non-existent retribution. Hollywood knows how to please it’s audience: most characters in American revenge films do horrible things, sometimes to seemingly innocent people, to get what they want. The spectator cheers upon the revenge taker and goes along with it as long as the movie is clear that the ‘bad guys’ are ‘pure evil’ and need to be destroyed. A Bittersweet Life and Bedevilled on the other hand do not, in contrast with most Hollywood revenge flicks, promote violence and revenge as a just cause. All the characters receive after their quest for justice is…death. Even in The Chaser, a less ambitious film in terms of this deconstruction, the main character is unable to act upon his vengeful desires. In the last shot of the film, he sits down with a deep sigh, accepting his fate that Young-min is in the hands of the inefficient justice department and he won’t receive what is coming to him. This experience is, of course, true to the Korean notion of han, where the incapability of restoring the balance of justice is impossible, hence the need to internalize and accept these feelings as part of the human condition.\n\nEspecially A Bittersweet Life makes a strong case to pinpoint the internal conflict that typifies revenge. In short, only hurt people hurt other people and trauma causes trauma. Revenge is a vicious circle and it has been for thousands of years. In traditional tribes, there are often blood feuds that originated centuries ago over something ridiculous as a stolen pig. Dozens of people get killed because of this minor offence and things quickly get out of hand in taking revenge. That’s also true for Sun-woo and Bok-nam, who’s killings get less and less justified as the film comes to a devastating climax. A typical Hollywood revenge flick would portray the death of the revenger as a tragic climax, for he or she is the one who could triumph over evil. However, as the famous German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche made clear, revenge is a diversion that hides our own shortcomings. The South Korean psyche and – as a consequence – their cinema seems to be more aware of that. Our distinction between an all evil force that needs to be conquered by all that is good has it’s origins, says Nietzsche, in a ‘slave morality’: those who were suppressed and enslaved thought of themselves as the chosen ones by the almighty God, while the rich and oppressors were depicted as an evil force that should be destroyed. This slave morality has perpetrated our everyday ideology and it’s this moralistic notion of good versus evil that Hollywood films are eager to exploit. However, as Nietzsche said:\n\n“He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.”\n\nWhat do we become when we avenge ourselves? As it seems, we identify even more than ever with the subject that we despise. This sounds strange, but think about it for a second: If a person feels humiliated because of a (serious) offence by another human being, we feel powerless. Indeed, revenge is all about power. Instead of claiming to ‘restore justice’ when taking revenge, it is more honest and correct to speak of ‘restoring power’. Remember that, as I’ve mentioned, the notion of good that triumphs evil has it’s origins in a struggle for power: it is okay if we are as cruel as our oppressors (and thus regain power), because they are essentially evil and we are good. It’s wrong when our enemy does it, but it’s morally justified when we do just the same. Strange, isn’t it?\n\nIn this struggle to power – or as Nietzsche would say “Wille zur Macht (Will To Power)” – we feel envy towards our oppressor and we’ll try to become like them. In another revenge film, I Saw The Devil (2010, Kim Jee-woon), the protagonist becomes the devil at the end (hence the title): after he killed the murderer of his beloved wife, he bursts into laughter while he can’t control his tears. Vengeance is not a simple and straightforward task, it will take away your sanity and will let you escape into madness or self-destruction. Sun-woo in A Bittersweet Life realizes this in a crucial scene where he stumbles upon his own reflection in the mirror. Just before he shoots his own boss and father figure, he is shocked to discover this strange figure that is himself in the mirror. He realizes, with the blood stains of innocent people covering his face, that he has become a monster to fight a monster. Bok-nam in Bedevilled will in her act of vengeance try to become a pseudo-male figure: she loses her friendly female posture and caring character for a monotone male-like and monstrous voice while she violently decapitates all the members of her local community. Taking revenge on the patriarchal oriented society demands that she’ll become what she fears: a man. In the end, Hae-won, representing the contemporary female that believes in the modern South Korean nation state and it’s ideology, will destroy Bok-nam.\n\nThe only successful vengeful figure in South Korean cinema is the state itself. The South Korean state, partly (and mainly) because of a Western suppression and partly as a reaction to North Korea’s aggressive and – that’s the fear or the South Korean leaders – ultimately attractive rhetoric, constructed an idea of a ‘hyper-masculine’ nation. Just like Sun-woo and Bok-nam, the South Korean state became an oppressor as a way of revenge towards their (ideological) enemies. This happened in a brutal way during the local dictatorships that plagued South Korean society until the end of the 20th century, but nowadays there’s still a more implicit suppression on an ideological basis that demands the sacrifice of the male and female body to the nation state. For females, their roll as caregiver is implicitly still being reinforced in South Korea despite the fact that more and more females join the workforce. Males on the other hand are socialized into an hyper-masculine notion of manhood during their military service. It is the vengeful South Korean society who conquers all in reality.\n\nIn all three films, and in – for example – Oldboy (2003, Park Chan-wook) and Sympathy for Mr.Vengeance (2002, Park Chan-wook), the ideology as it is carried out by the state seems to conquer all in their quest to take vengeance upon foreign influences. In A Bittersweet Life, Sun-woo will come to his end when a Russian immigrant discovers Sun-woo killed his brother. In the end, he will conquer and kill Sun-woo. It is he, the person who respects the traditional Confucian tradition of devotion to the family, who will survive. This pessimistic world vision that characterizes this nation’s cinema expresses, by portraying protagonists who will not succeed in their personal quest for vengeance, a true disappointment in the project of a modern nation state. Each film lends itself to a reading where a personal motivation for revenge ends up in favour of tradition and suppression by some higher power. All the tragic heroes could do is, like Koreans do for as long as they can remember, accept the fact that they can’t act vengeful upon all those who inflicted harm upon them. In the end, Korean cinema in general honours this tradition of han, for all those who try to fight monsters will eventually become monsters."
