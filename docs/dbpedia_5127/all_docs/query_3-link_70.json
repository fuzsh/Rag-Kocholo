The main objective of the course is to discover the meanings that these literature offer, not just for the original audience or for the respective cultures, but for us. As such, it is not a survey or a lecture-based course. Rather than being taught what meanings are to be derived from the texts, we explore meanings together, informed by in-depth reading and thorough ongoing discussion\n\nSpring 2024: AHUM UN1400\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHUM 1400 001/13685 Th 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n411 Kent Hall David Lurie 4.00 16/22 AHUM 1400 002/13686 M 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n301m Fayerweather Seong-Uk Kim 4.00 26/25 AHUM 1400 003/13687 T 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n425 Pupin Laboratories Michael Como 4.00 25/22 AHUM 1400 004/13688 M 12:10pm - 2:00pm\n\n569 Alfred Lerner Hall Allison Bernard, Samuel Hellmann 4.00 19/25 AHUM 1400 005/00278 Th 10:10am - 12:15pm\n\n501 Diana Center David Moerman 4.00 19/23\n\nFall 2024: AHUM UN1400\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHUM 1400 001/14203 T 12:10pm - 2:00pm\n\n507 Philosophy Hall John Phan 4.00 21/24 AHUM 1400 002/14204 M 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n507 Philosophy Hall Seong-Uk Kim 4.00 24/24 AHUM 1400 003/00588 T 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n614 Milstein Center Lili Xia 4.00 20/20 AHUM 1400 004/15441 T 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n707 Hamilton Hall Michael Como 4.00 24/24 AHUM 1400 005/17664 W 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n401 Hamilton Hall Allison Bernard 4.00 20/20\n\nRELI UN2308 BUDDHISM: EAST ASIAN. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nLecture and discussion. An introductory survey that studies East Asian Buddhism as an integral , living religious tradition. Emphasis on the reading of original treatises and historiographies in translation, while historical events are discussed in terms of their relevance to contemporary problems confronted by Buddhism.

Using a rubric provided by the Bhagavad Gita, explores philosophical/theological (jnana), ritual (karma), and devotional (bhakti) aspects of Hindu life and thought\n\nEAAS UN2342 Mythology of East Asia. 4 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nThrough close readings of major myths of China, Japan, and Korea, this course provides a survey of significant themes of East Asian culture. Inclusion of selected comparative readings also leads students to reconsider the nature of ‘world mythology,’ a field often constituted by juxtaposing Greek and Latin classics with oral texts collected during anthropological fieldwork. The core materials for this class are from ancient written traditions, but they speak with force and clarity to modern readers, as is underlined by our attention to latter-day reception and reconceptualization of these narratives. This is an introductory, discussion-based class intended for undergraduates. No prior knowledge of East Asian history or culture is required, and all course readings are in English. Satisfies the Global Core requirement.\n\nRELI UN2405 CHINESE RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nThis course provides a chronological and thematic introduction to Chinese religions from their beginnings until modern times. It examines distinctive concepts, practices and institutions in the religions of China. Emphasis will be placed on the diversity and unity of religious expressions in China, with readings drawn from a wide-range of texts: religious scriptures, philosophical texts, popular literature and modern historical and ethnographic studies. Special attention will be given to those forms of religion common to both “elite” and “folk” culture: cosmology, family and communal rituals, afterlife, morality and mythology. The course also raises more general questions concerning gender, class, political patronage, and differing concepts of religion\n\nFall 2024: RELI UN2405\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment RELI 2405 001/10198 M W 1:10pm - 2:25pm\n\n307 Uris Hall Ruifeng Chen 4.00 31/35\n\nHIST UN2580 US - EAST ASIA RELATIONS. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nThis lecture course examines the history of the relationship between the United States and the countries of East Asia in the 19th and 20th centuries. The first half of the course will examine the factors drove the United States to acquire territorial possessions in Asia, to vie for a seat at the imperial table at China’s expense, and to eventual confrontation with Japan over mastery in the Pacific from the turn of the century leading to the Second World War. The second half of the course will explore the impact of U.S. policy toward East Asia during the Cold War when Washington’s policy of containment, which included nation-building, development schemes, and waging war, came up against East Asia’s struggles for decolonization, revolution, and modernization. Not only will this course focus on state-to-state relations, it will also address a multitude of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese perspectives on the United States and American culture through translated text, oral history, fiction, and memoir. Participation in weekly discussion sections, which will begin no later than the third week of classes, is mandatory\n\nEAAS UN3322 EAST ASIAN CINEMA. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nThis course introduces students to major works, genres and waves of East Asian cinema from the Silent era to the present, including films from Japan, Korea, Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. How has cinema participated in East Asian societies’ distinct and shared experiences of industrial modernity, imperialism and (post)colonialism? How has cinema engaged with questions of class, gender, ethnic and language politics? In what ways has cinema facilitated transnational circulations and mobilizations of peoples and ideas, and how has it interacted with other art forms, such as theatre, painting, photography and music? In this class, we answer these questions by studying cinemas across the region sideby- side, understanding cinema as deeply embedded in the region’s intertwining political, social and cultural histories and circulations of people and ideas. We cover a variety of genres such as melodrama, comedy, historical epic, sci-fi, martial arts and action, and prominent film auteurs such as Yasujir? Ozu, Akira Kurosawa, Yu Hy?nmok, Chen Kaige, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and Ann Hui. As cinema is, among other things, a creative practice, in this course, students will be given opportunities to respond to films analytically and creatively, through writing as well as creative visual projects. As a global core course, this class does not assume prior knowledge of East Asian culture or of film studies\n\nHSEA UN3355 Antiquarianism and the Politics of the Past in East Asian History. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course introduces students to the history of antiquarianism in East Asia and explores how people in the past negotiated their own pasts through the medium of material culture. We will examine how historical societies engaged with antiquities—through collecting and displaying, copying and faking, preserving and erasing—and how antiquarian traditions shaped social memory and collective identity in China, Japan, and Korea from the first millennium BCE to the early twentieth century. We will pay particular attention to the life and afterlife of ancient Chinese ritual bronzes through the centuries as a case study to consider how the politics of the past translated across both time and geographic space in East Asia\n\nANTH UN3465 WOMEN, GENDER POL-MUSLIM WORLD. 3.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nPractices like veiling, gendered forms of segregation, and the honor code that are central to Western images of Muslim women are also contested issues throughout the Muslim world. This course examines debates about gender, sexuality, and morality and explores the interplay of political, social, and economic factors in shaping the lives of men and women across the Muslim world, from the Middle East to Europe. The perspective will be primarily anthropological, although special attention will be paid to historical processes associated with colonialism and nation-building that are crucial to understanding present gender politics. We will focus on the sexual politics of everyday life in specific locales and explore the extent to which these are shaped by these histories and the power of representations mobilized in a global world in the present and international political interventions. In addition to reading ethnographic works about particular communities, we read memoirs and critical analyses of the local and transnational activist movements that have emerged to address various aspects of gender politics and rights\n\nSpring 2024: ANTH UN3465\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ANTH 3465 001/10594 M W 1:10pm - 2:25pm\n\n413 Kent Hall Maria Malmstrom 3.00 46/60\n\nRELI UN3500 BUDDHIST ETHICS. 3.00 points.\n\nSpring 2024: RELI UN3500\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment RELI 3500 001/11537 T Th 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\n201 80 Claremont Thomas Yarnall 3.00 14/25\n\nEAAS UN3844 CULTURE, MENTAL HEALTH, AND HEALING IN EAST ASIA. 4.00 points.\n\nWhy do certain mental illnesses only appear in specific regions of the world? What processes of translation, adaption, and “indigenization” take place when Western psychiatric diagnostic categories, pharmaceutical regimens, and psychodynamic treatments travel to China, South Korea and Japan? How do East Asian therapeutic modalities such as Traditional Chinese Medicine and the practice of qigong destabilize biomedical assumptions about the etiology and treatment of mental illness? This course engages these and other questions through anthropological analysis of the experiences of people struggling with mental illness, the mental health practitioners who treat them, and the broader economic, social and political contexts that shape these interactions\n\nHIST UN3866 WARS OF INDOCHINA. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course will analyze the wars for Vietnam in the Cold War era from a multitude of perspectives, vantage points, and mediums. Using the award-winning documentary, The Vietnam War, as the basis of the seminar, students will explore this violent period in Indochinese history that witnessed decolonization movements, revolutionary struggles, state and nation-building, superpower interventions, and devastating warfare. At the same time, the battles that unfolded in mainland Southeast Asia posed geostrategic challenges to former imperial powers and the superpowers of the Cold War era. The class will not only familiarize students with Vietnam's tumultuous history, it introduces the latest debates, newest research, and most recent documentary films on this oft-studied topic\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3866\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3866 001/11498 W 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n301m Fayerweather Lien-Hang Nguyen 4.00 11/15\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN3866\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3866 001/15426 W 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n301m Fayerweather Lien-Hang Nguyen 4.00 12/13\n\nHSEA UN3898 THE MONGOLS IN HISTORY. 3.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nStudy of the role of the Mongols in Eurasian history, focusing on the era of the Great Mongol Empire. The roles of Chinggis and Khubilai Khan and the modern fate of the Mongols to be considered\n\nSpring 2024: HSEA UN3898\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HSEA 3898 001/13693 T 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n411 Kent Hall Morris Rossabi 3.00 19/25\n\nEAAS UN3990 APPROACHES TO E ASIAN STUDIES. 4.00 points.\n\nEnrollment is limited to EALAC and AMEC majors and concentrators only.\n\nThis course is intended to provide a focal point for undergraduate majors in East Asian Studies. It introduces students to the analysis of particular objects of East Asian historical, literary, and cultural studies from various disciplinary perspectives. The syllabus is composed of a series of modules, each centered around an object, accompanied by readings that introduce different ways of understanding its meaning\n\nFall 2024: EAAS UN3990\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EAAS 3990 001/14213 T 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n405 Kent Hall Feng Li 4.00 14/15 EAAS 3990 002/14214 T 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n401 Hamilton Hall Robert Hymes 4.00 14/15\n\nEAAS UN3901 SENIOR THESIS. 3.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: Senior majors only.\n\nPrerequisites: Senior majors only.

Our aim will be to consider these rules and traditions within the context of their creation as well as their subsequent use. We will also look to the words and examples of women Buddhist practitioners directly, including in modern Western Buddhism\n\nHSEA GU4110 HISTORY SCIENCE AND TECH IN EAST ASIA. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course explores the life of scientific and technological artifacts in East Asia. We will examine everyday objects alongside core literature from Science and Technology and Society (STS) studies to raise new historical questions and methodological approaches. From clocks to paper, from pregnancy to immortality, we will take on a close reading of objects and ideas by directly engaging with the circumstances under which they were made.\n\nEARL GU4120 CHAN/ZEN BUDDHISM. 4.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: Some background in East Asian Buddhism, or instructor permission required.\n\nPrerequisites: Some background in East Asian Buddhism, or instructor permission required. Zen has become a household term, but the reality behind this term is not well known. Originating in China around the 6th century C.E. the Chan/Zen tradition became one of the major Buddhist schools and rapidly spread to Korea, Japan, Vietnam (and, to a certain extent, Tibet). This course examines some aspects of this tradition, emphasizing its historical development, its mythological elements, and its multifaceted practice, which has for too long been reduced in the Western mind to meditation\n\nHSEA GU4220 ISLAM IN CHINA AND INNER ASIA. 4.00 points.\n\nThis seminar surveys the history of Islam, both in the Chinese interior and neighboring Inner Asia (primarily Xinjiang), from its arrival to the present day. Beginning with the first legendary accounts of migration from the Middle East to China, we trace the growth of an identifiable Muslimcommunity in the age of the Mongol empire, then look at Ming China’s interactions with the Islamic world, the Qing expansion into Inner Asia, and conclude by discussing modernist and nationalist trends of the twentieth-century\n\nRELI GU4307 BUDDHISM ＆ DAOISM IN CHINA. 4.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: one course on Buddhism or Chinese religious traditions is recommended, but not required, as background.\n\nIn recent decades, the study of the so-called “Buddho-Daoism” has become a burgeoning field that breaks down the traditional boundary lines drawn between the two Chinese religious traditions. In this course we will read secondary scholarship in English that probes the complex relationships between Buddhism and Daoism in the past two millennia. Students are required not only to be aware of the tensions and complementarity between them, but to be alert to the nature of claims to either religious purity or mixing and the ways those claims were put forward under specific religio-historical circumstances. The course is organized thematically rather than chronologically. We will address topics on terminology, doctrine, cosmology, eschatology, soteriology, exorcism, scriptural productions, ritual performance, miracle tales and visual representations that arose in the interactions of the two religions, with particular attention paid to critiquing terms such as “influence,” “encounter,” “dialogue,” “hybridity,” “syncretism,” and “repertoire.” The course is designed for both advanced undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of East Asian religion, literature, history, art history, sociology and anthropology. One course on Buddhism or Chinese religious traditions is recommended, but not required, as background\n\nSpring 2024: RELI GU4307\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment RELI 4307 001/11577 Th 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n201 80 Claremont Zhaohua Yang 4.00 15/20\n\nEAAS GU4445 Proletarian Asia - working-class culture from 1930s to present. 4.00 points.\n\nFrom Bong Joon-ho’s runaway success Parasite, to manga adaptations of Kobayashi Takiji’s novel The Crab Cannery Ship, to the proliferation of Chinese migrant worker poetry, recent developments in the cultural landscape of East Asia have seen a renewed concern with the plight of workers and other sections of the oppressed under conditions of late capitalism. This course offers students the opportunity to situate these developments within an extended historical trajectory as the basis on which to think about the relation of radical histories to our present and possible future. It does so by integrating contemporary cultural texts with earlier cultural experiments that arose amidst the political turbulence of the 1930s across a range of locations in East Asia\n\nPOLS GU4473 Political Transitions in Southeast Asia. 4 points.\n\nWhat political direction is Southeast Asia taking? Over the past two decades, Indonesia has been transformed from a military-dominated semi-authoritarian state to the region’s most vigorous and open political order. Meanwhile Thailand has experienced two military coups since 2006, and early patterns of political liberalization seem to be unraveling. And Burma has gone from international pariah to prospective new democracy.\n\nIs it possible to see any overall regional trends? Are teleological assumptions of the inexorable rise of democracy being vindicated – or does much of the evident point in just the opposite direction? The module will examine the nature of transitions (and attempted transitions) to more open political systems in Southeast Asia, with a primary focus on Burma, Indonesia, and Thailand. After a brief review of the three cases, the course will adopt a thematic approach, first reviewing the character of the state, including national mythologies, the military and the relations between capital city and provinces. It will then explore aspects of transition, including the changing political economy, the rise of electoral politics, the role of religion and media, and the phenomenon of rally politics. Challenges to national elites from the regions will also be closely scrutinised. These themes and issues have a broader relevance to wider debates in comparative politics, which students will be encouraged to explore in their papers.\n\nRELI GU4513 BUDDHISM AND NEUROSCIENCE. 4.00 points.\n\nWith the Dalai Lamas marked interest in recent advances in neuroscience, the question of the compatibility between Buddhist psychology and neuroscience has been raised in a number of conferences and studies. This course will examine the state of the question, look at claims made on both sides, and discuss whether or not there is a convergence between Buddhist discourse about the mind and scientific discourse about the brain\n\nRELI GU4516 The Politics of Freud in the Postcolony. 4 points.\n\nThis seminar examines the legacies of psychoanalysis through a critical exploration of how its concepts, practices and institutes have operated in colonial and postcolonial contexts. Weekly discussions will look at how practicing therapists, activists, anthropologists and others have extended, subverted and displaced psychoanalytic thought within non-European histories and imaginaries. Topics include challenges to the universality of the Oedipus emerging from early 20th century anthropologist’s studies of kinship in Papua New Guinea, legacies of a self-made South Asian psychoanalyst’s challenges to Freudian orthodoxies, and the study of a psychoanalysis of racism forged out of a Martinican psychiatrist’s encounters with colonial neuroses in Algeria. We will also explore how psychoanalytic concepts have been deployed in debates about repression and sexuality in daily life during the Cultural Revolution and the psychic legacies of Maoism in contemporary China. In addition to reading the work of Freud and his critics, we will encounter primary materials—religious texts, movies, novels—that have been subjected to psychoanalytically-inflected interpretations. While attending to the cultural, racial and political assumptions suffusing psychoanalysis, our seminar will also show how variously situated authors have given this tradition new applications and meanings.\n\nRELI GU4535 BUDDHIST CONTEMPLATIVE SCIENCES. 4.00 points.\n\nBuddhist arts and sciences traditionally are divided into the interconnected disciplines of ethics (śīla), wisdom/philosophy (prajñā), and “meditation” or experiential cultivation (samādhi/bhāvanā). This seminar course introduces the latter discipline, thus complementing and completing Prof. Yarnall’s Columbia seminars on Buddhist Ethics (RELI UN3500) and Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Philosophy (RELI GU4630), either of which—in addition to his introductory lecture course on Indo-Tibetan Buddhism (RELI UN2205)—are encouraged as prerequisites. This course will provide a detailed presentation of key Buddhist contemplative sciences, including: stabilizing meditation (śamatha); analytic insight meditation (vipaśyanā); cultivation of the four immeasurables, and form and formless trances; mind cultivation (lo jong); mindfulness meditation; Zen meditation; great perfection (dzogchen); and the subtle body-mind states activated and transformed through advanced tantric yoga techniques. These arts and sciences will be explored both within their traditional interdisciplinary frameworks, as well as in dialog with related contemporary disciplines, including: cognitive sciences, neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, philosophy, epistemology, and so forth. To be conducted in a mixed lecture/seminar format (active, prepared participation required)\n\nRELI GU4611 The Lotus Sutra in East Asian Buddhism. 4 points.\n\nPrerequisites: open to students who have taken one previous course in either Buddhism, Chinese religions, or a history course on China or East Asian.\n\nThe course examines some central Mahayana Buddhist beliefs and practices through an in-depth study of the Lotus sutra. Schools (Tiantai/Tendai, Nichiren) and cultic practices such as sutra-chanting, meditation, confessional rites, and Guanyin worship based on the scripture. East Asian art and literature inspired by it.\n\nMDES GU4627 Significant Others. 4.00 points.\n\nWhat is the relationship between homoeroticism and homosociality? How does this relationship form conceptions of gender and sexuality in ways that might be historically unfamiliar and culturally or regionally specific? We pursue these questions through the lens of friendship and its relationship to ideas and expressions of desire, love, and loyalty in pre-modern times. We begin by considering the intellectual basis of the modern idea of friendship as a private, personal relationship, and trace it back to earlier times when it was often a public relationship of social and political significance. Some of these relationships were between social equals, while many were unequal forms (like patronage) that could bridge social, political or parochial differences. Thinking through the relationships and possible distinctions between erotic love, romantic love and amity (love between friends), we will draw on scholarly works from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, particularly philosophy, sociology, political theory, literature, history, and art history. We will attend to friendship’s work in constituting, maintaining and challenging various social and political orders in a variety of Asian contexts (West, Central, South and East Asian), with comparative reference to scholarship on European and East Asian contexts. Primary source materials will include philosophy, religious manuals, autobiographies, popular love stories, heroic epics, mystical poetry, mirror for princes, paintings, material objects of exchange, and architectural monuments, largely from Islamic and Asian contexts\n\nASRL GU4831 Post/socialist Cosmologies in Asia. 4.00 points.\n\nWhy have spiritual worlds returned or persisted in post/socialist Asia where people once thought they would disappear? What does religiosity look like in socialist and postsocialist contexts today? According to secularization theorists, religion was destined to fade with the passage of modern progressive time. In Asia and elsewhere, socialist states were known for embracing atheism and curtailing or banishing institutions and practices they deemed religious or superstitious. Yet, engagements with spirited worlds—including those with ghosts and ancestors, spirit mediumship and possession, Buddhism, Daoism, and Abrahamic religions—did not vanish. In this class, we will read social and political theories of communism/socialism, postsocialism, religion, and secularism, alongside contemporary ethnographies of China, Vietnam, Mongolia, and elsewhere, to consider how global communities live out spirited worlds amid post-Cold War geographies\n\nASCE UN1359 INTRO TO EAST ASIAN CIV: CHINA. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nPrerequisites: NOTE:Students must register for a discussion section, ASCE UN1360\n\nPrerequisites: NOTE:Students must register for a discussion section, ASCE UN1360 The evolution of Chinese civilization from ancient times to the 20th century, with emphasis on characteristic institutions and traditions\n\nSpring 2024: ASCE UN1359\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ASCE 1359 001/13689 T Th 1:10pm - 2:25pm\n\n310 Fayerweather Zachary Berge-Becker 4.00 39/35\n\nFall 2024: ASCE UN1359\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ASCE 1359 001/14205 T Th 1:10pm - 2:25pm\n\nRen Kraft Center Riga Shakya 4.00 90/90\n\nRELI UN2307 CHINESE RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS. 3.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nHistorical survey highlighting major developments in Chinese religion: includes selections from the Warring States classics, developments in popular Daoism, and an overview of the golden age of Chinese Buddhism.

Ethnicity is central to any discussion of society and culture in the West, and this course will seek to place it at the forefront of our understanding of modern China as well. China is officially a country comprised of 56 distinct peoples or “nationalities” (including the Han Chinese majority). In the literature presented here, translated both from Chinese and minority languages, students will have the opportunity to hear the rich and varied voices of China’s minority writers first hand, and through them gain an understanding of the key issues surrounding ethnicity in modern China. We will cover fiction, poetry, essays, and film by a broad range of different peoples: Tibetans, Mongols, Manchus, the Islamic Uyghur nationality of Xinjiang province, the Yi of southwestern Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, the indigenous writers of Taiwan, and others. We will pay close attention to how minority writers explore and assert their identities in a Han-dominated society, how their work can broaden our understanding of the cultural diversity at play in modern China, and how it can challenge our conventional definitions of what constitutes modern Chinese literature and culture. The course begins by considering the role of ethnicity and nation in the birth and development of Chinese literature in the 20th century, before moving on to examine works by specific ethnicities. Finally, we will address certain issues faced by minorities in China that cut across ethnic lines. Throughout, we will address some of the most pressing concerns of minority ethnicities, concerns that are deeply significant not only to our understanding of modern China, but to the modern world at large. Familiarity with Chinese or related cultural context beneficial, but not required.\n\nEAAS UN3230 Labor, Love, and Leisure in Contemporary China. 3 points.\n\nThis course offers an introduction to life in Reform era China. We will employ anthropological analysis to examine how Maoist legacies and recent state liberalization efforts shape everyday experiences of labor, romance, and consumption. Scholarly texts will be supplemented with primary materials including political speeches, testimonies, and documentaries.\n\nSpring 2024: EAAS UN3230\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EAAS 3230 001/00281 W 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\nLl001 Milstein Center Nicholas Bartlett 3 17/18\n\nEAAS UN3313 INTRODUCTION TO CHINESE CINEMAS. 3.00 points.\n\nWhat is “cinema” in the Chinese-speaking world, and how have the aesthetics, politics and practice of cinema evolved over time? In what ways has cinema interacted with its sister arts, such as painting, photography, theatre, architecture, and music? And in what capacities has cinema represented and intervened into the social and political worlds of its production and reception? This course is an introductory course on Chinese cinemas from Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, featuring landmark films from the 1930s to the present, with emphasis on contemporary films produced in the past three decades. We cover major genres such as melodrama, historical epic, comedy, musical, martial arts and documentary films, and study works by film auteurs such as Hou Hsiao-hsien, Chen Kaige, Ann Hui and Jia Zhangke. Besides the questions mentioned above, topics also include cinema’s approaches to history and memory, and its engagement with questions of gender, ethnicity, class and language politics\n\nEAAS UN3322 EAST ASIAN CINEMA. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nThis course introduces students to major works, genres and waves of East Asian cinema from the Silent era to the present, including films from Japan, Korea, Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. How has cinema participated in East Asian societies’ distinct and shared experiences of industrial modernity, imperialism and (post)colonialism? How has cinema engaged with questions of class, gender, ethnic and language politics? In what ways has cinema facilitated transnational circulations and mobilizations of peoples and ideas, and how has it interacted with other art forms, such as theatre, painting, photography and music? In this class, we answer these questions by studying cinemas across the region sideby- side, understanding cinema as deeply embedded in the region’s intertwining political, social and cultural histories and circulations of people and ideas. We cover a variety of genres such as melodrama, comedy, historical epic, sci-fi, martial arts and action, and prominent film auteurs such as Yasujir? Ozu, Akira Kurosawa, Yu Hy?nmok, Chen Kaige, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and Ann Hui. As cinema is, among other things, a creative practice, in this course, students will be given opportunities to respond to films analytically and creatively, through writing as well as creative visual projects. As a global core course, this class does not assume prior knowledge of East Asian culture or of film studies\n\nEAAS UN3435 Chinese Revolution, Asian Revolution, World Revolution: Revolution and Radicalism in the Long Twentieth Century. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course examines the Chinese Revolution as a global event, one that provided new possibilities for understanding the future not only of China, but Asia and the world. In doing so, it refuses any notion of the Chinese Revolution as a merely \"Chinese\" event and instead marks the ways in which diverse sets of activists and revolutionaries from across Asia not only contributed towards the formation of Chinese revolutionary politics but also responded on their own terms. The Chinese Revolution thereby emerges as a truly global event and one that transformed political imagination. The course focuses largely on the responses and trajectories of Asian revolutionaries, especially from Vietnam and Japan, whose intellectual and political paths intersected with those of Chinese activists. Students can expect to work through the diverse intellectual interventions of pan-Asian diasporic communities in Japan at the beginning of the twentieth century, read interwar proletarian fiction from Chinese and Japanese authors, compare Chinese and Vietnamese conceptualizations of \"people's war\" as an anti-colonial military strategy. They will emerge with a new understanding of the porousness and complexity of basic categories such as China, Asia and revolution\n\nHIST UN3866 WARS OF INDOCHINA. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course will analyze the wars for Vietnam in the Cold War era from a multitude of perspectives, vantage points, and mediums. Using the award-winning documentary, The Vietnam War, as the basis of the seminar, students will explore this violent period in Indochinese history that witnessed decolonization movements, revolutionary struggles, state and nation-building, superpower interventions, and devastating warfare. At the same time, the battles that unfolded in mainland Southeast Asia posed geostrategic challenges to former imperial powers and the superpowers of the Cold War era. The class will not only familiarize students with Vietnam's tumultuous history, it introduces the latest debates, newest research, and most recent documentary films on this oft-studied topic\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3866\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3866 001/11498 W 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n301m Fayerweather Lien-Hang Nguyen 4.00 11/15\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN3866\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3866 001/15426 W 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n301m Fayerweather Lien-Hang Nguyen 4.00 12/13\n\nEAAS UN3575 Approaching Cities and Life in Chinese Cultural History. 4.00 points.\n\nItalo Calvino's imagined Marco Polo cautions against commemorating the lived experience of a city, \"Memory's images, once they are fixed in words, are erased.\" How shall we modern students of the past retrieve the ways in which foreign men and women dwelled in everyday practice? This seminar will take you on a tour of some key topoi — as both physical and literary constructs — throughout Chinese history, availing of a selection of textual, visual, and cinematic materials that shape and are shaped by the palimpsests of changing Chinese urban life\n\nHSEA UN3642 Peripheries of the Sinitic World through History. 3.00 points.\n\nThis course surveys the southern and western peripheries of the political entities we today call China from the turn of the 1st millennium CE to the early 20th century. It does so primarily through translations of primary sources - travelogues and geographies- up to the 16th century, at which point it turns its attention to recently published monographs of varying breadth that can cover more ground, given the sheer number of available primary sources from that time on. No prerequisites but Introduction to East Asian Civilizations: Tibet, China, or Vietnam is recommended\n\nHSEA UN3851 GODS, GHOSTS, AND ANCESTORS: RELIGION IN CHINESE CULTURE AND SOCIETY. 3.00 points.\n\nExamines the social and cultural place of Chinese religions through time, focusing on Chinese ideas of the relation between humans and spirits, and the expression of those ideas in practice. Problems will include the long-term displacement of ancestors by gods in Chinese history; the varying and changing social functions of rituals, and the different views of the same ritual taken by different participants; the growth of religious commerce from early modern times on. Topics will be organized roughly chronologically but the emphasis is on broad change rather than historical coverage\n\nHIST BC3864 Feast/Famine: Food Environment China. 4.00 points.\n\nFood has always been a central concern in Chinese politics, religion, medicine, and culture. This course takes an ecological approach to the provision, preparation, and consumption of food in Chinese history, from the Neolithic times to the post-socialist era today. In examining Chinese approaches to soil fertility, healthy diet, and culinary pleasures, we explore alternative food systems for a more sustainable future\n\nEAAS UN3927 CHINA IN THE MODERN WORLD. 3.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nThe rise of China has impacted world politics and economy in significant ways. How did it happen? This course introduces some unique angles of self-understanding as suggested by Chinese writers, intellectuals, and artists who have participated in the making of modern China and provided illuminating and critical analyses of their own culture, history, and the world. Readings cover a wide selection of modern Chinese fiction and poetry, autobiographical writing, photography, documentary film, artworks, and music with emphasis on the interplays of art/literature, history, and politics. Close attention is paid to the role of storytelling, the mediating powers of technology, new forms of visuality and sense experience, and the emergence of critical consciousness in response to global modernity. In the course of the semester, a number of contemporary Chinese artists, filmmakers, and writers are invited to answer students’ questions. This course draws on cross-disciplinary methods from art history, film studies, anthropology, and history in approaching texts and other works. The goal is to develop critical reading skills and gain in-depth understanding of modern China and its engagement with the modern world beyond the cold war rhetoric. Our topics of discussion include historical rupture, loss and melancholy, exile, freedom, migration, social bonding and identity, capitalism, nationalism, and the world revolution. All works are read in English translation.\n\nFall 2024: EAAS UN3927\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EAAS 3927 001/14212 T 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n522c Kent Hall Lydia Liu 3.00 21/21\n\nEAAS UN3935 THE FANTASTIC IN PRE-MOD CHINA. 4.00 points.\n\nEAAS UN3971 Technology and Power in Modern China. 4 points.\n\nPrerequisites: Any introductory level course on China or East Asia.\n\nUndergraduate seminar addressing the intersection of technology and politics in the history of modern China, from the 19th century to the present.

Neither is the world built with any universal understanding of disability. This course examines what it means to be disabled in both theory and practice, especially in East Asian contexts. We begin by closely examining the concept of “disability” and its various connotations, then look at permutations of disability in Japan, China, and the Koreas before ending with recent, more radical ways of thinking about disability. This interdisciplinary course is framed by feminist approaches to definitions and applications of disability theory, drawing further on literary and technological approaches to representation of minority subjects. Multimedia engagement with issues ranging from guide dogs to nanotechnology will aid in understanding overlaps between, and barriers of, disability on an international scale, while also building a critical toolkit for understanding “able-bodied” assumptions in ourselves.\n\nHSEA GU4027 ISSUES IN EARLY CHINESE CIV. 4.00 points.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce students to the basic issues and problems in the study of early Chinese civilization, some theoretical and others methodological. Through the review of a long series of debates the course offers a quick entrance both to this early period of history and to these studies. Organized around problems, the course encourages critical thinking and contesting arguments and helps the students weigh different positions addressing the problems. By doing so, the course guides the students to search for frontline questions and to probe possible ways to solve the problems. The course deals with both the written records (inscriptional and textual) and the material evidence, and the student can well expect this course to serve as also updates of the most fascinating archaeological discoveries in China made in the past decades. The course is designed as an upper-level undergraduate and MA course; therefore, it is recommended that undergraduate students should take \"ASCE V2359: Introduction to East Asian Civilizations: China\" before participating in this course.\n\nEAAS GU4031 INTRO-HIST OF CHINESE LIT(ENG). 3.00 points.\n\nFall 2024: EAAS GU4031\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EAAS 4031 001/17665 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n405 Kent Hall Allison Bernard 3.00 4/15\n\nEAAS GU4111 Modern Chinese Poetry in a Global Context. 4.00 points.\n\nIn this course, we will take modern Chinese poetry as a crucible in which we can observe the interacting forces of literary history and social change. From diplomats who saw poetry as a medium for cultural translation between China and the world, to revolutionaries who enlisted poetry in the project of social transformation, we will examine the lives and works of some of China’s most prominent poets and ask, what can we learn about modern China from reading their poetry? In addition to poems, the course will include fiction, essays, photographs, and films by both Chinese and non-Chinese artists that place our poets in a broader context; topics of discussion include national identity, revolution, translation, gender, the body, ethnicity, and technology\n\nEAAS GU4202 The Dead in Ancient China. 4 points.\n\nWhat did the dead become? Ancestors, spirits, or ghosts? Are these postmortem categories and roles ontologically distinct and mutually exclusive? How did the dead become ancestors, spirits, or ghosts? Where did the dead go and what kind of \"lives after\" did they have? With these questions in mind, this course explores the realm of the dead in ancient China (ca. 5000 B.C.E.-600 C.E.) instantiated by the living in rituals, objects, and writings. Focusing on contemporaneous materials obtained through archaeology, facilitated with transmitted history and literature when available, students will read about and learn to analyze a variety of conceptions of the dead and corresponding afterlife options recorded in diverse kinds of sources including material culture, architecture, artifacts, pictorial representations, and texts from ancient China.\n\nEAAS GU4217 CHINA ON STAGE. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course explores how Chinese identity and society have been staged in theatre productions over the past century. Course content includes play scripts in English translation, videos, photographs, archival materials, and English-language books and articles about Chinese theater\n\nHSEA GU4220 ISLAM IN CHINA AND INNER ASIA. 4.00 points.\n\nThis seminar surveys the history of Islam, both in the Chinese interior and neighboring Inner Asia (primarily Xinjiang), from its arrival to the present day. Beginning with the first legendary accounts of migration from the Middle East to China, we trace the growth of an identifiable Muslimcommunity in the age of the Mongol empire, then look at Ming China’s interactions with the Islamic world, the Qing expansion into Inner Asia, and conclude by discussing modernist and nationalist trends of the twentieth-century\n\nHSEA GU4221 Many Belts, Many Roads: China and the Islamic World, c.600AD-Present. 4 points.\n\nThis seminar explores historical interactions between China and the Islamic world across the greater Indian Ocean region, sometimes called the \"maritime Silk Road.\" It gives special attention to the millions of Muslims in China itself, who have played an important role bridging these diverse spaces and cultures. Complicating conventional definitions of China, Islam, and the nation-state, this course illuminates many under-studied aspects of Asian and global history, Chinese state and society, and international relations.\n\nHSEA GU4222 China's Global Histories: People, Space, and Power. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nThis seminar asks what Chinese history tells us about global history and vice versa. Taking a long-term and multiregional approach, it invites you to develop your own answers to this question from perspectives such as trade and economy, migration and immigration, empire and imperialism, war, religion, science, gender, ideology, and modern state- and nation-building, and contemporary international relations. We will not only challenge Eurocentric and Sinocentric methodologies, but push toward new conceptual vocabularies that aspire to the genuinely global\n\nEAAS GU4226 GENDER,CLASS,REAL ESTATE-CHINA. 4.00 points.\n\nThis is a seminar for advanced undergraduates and master’s degree students, which explores the socioeconomic consequences of China’s development of a boom, urban residential real-estate market since the privatization of housing at the end of the 1990s. We will use the intersecting lenses of gender/sexuality, class and race/ethnicity to analyze the dramatic new inequalities created in arguably the largest and fastest accumulation of residential-real estate wealth in history. We will examine topics such as how skyrocketing home prices and state-led urbanization have created winners and losers based on gender, sexuality, class, race/ethnicity and location (hukou), as China strives to transform from a predominantly rural population to one that is 60 percent urban by 2020. We explore the vastly divergent effects of urban real-estate development on Chinese citizens, from the most marginaliz4d communities in remote regions of Tibet and Xinjiang to hyper-wealthy investors in Manhattan. Although this course has no formal prerequisites, it assumes some basic knowledge of Chinese history. If you have never taken a course on China before, please ask me for guidance on whether or not this class is suitable for you. The syllabus is preliminary and subject to change based on breaking news events and the needs of the class\n\nFall 2024: EAAS GU4226\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EAAS 4226 001/14519 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n301m Fayerweather Leta Hong Fincher 4.00 25/25\n\nEAAS GU4232 Trauma and Testimonial Narrative in Post-Mao Chinese Literature. 3 points.\n\nIs the Cultural Revolution the Holocaust of China? Such analogy is often evoked to imply more than a mere rhetoric of accusation. This seminar explores the rise of testimonial literature—known as “Scar Literature”—that began to appear in print immediately after the Cultural Revolution in Mainland China. We will examine how this literature repudiates the repressions, violence and chaos of the Maoist era and speaks to the collective experience of Chinese intellectuals. We will analyze how this body of testimonial literature and related film productions bear witness to the suffering of intellectuals and render it commensurate or not commensurate with the genre of Holocaust literature. Our goal is to achieve a deeper understanding of the tragedy of the Cultural Revolution and its historical roots beyond analogical thinking. Topics of discussion include individual and collective memories, trauma, storytelling, social protest and moral accountability. All readings are in English.\n\nEAAS GU4244 Chinese Internet Culture. 4 points.\n\nThis course introduces Chinese internet culture by examining interactive literary communities, multimedia platforms, cyber-nationalism, web-based activism, and the possibility of the internet commons in mainland China. We will pay close attention to the figure of netizen, online piracy, cyberbullying, censorship, and growing addiction to virtual reality among the Chinese youth. Topics of discussion include, for example, the tension between connectivity and control, between imitation and innovation, and between the real and the virtual. We will explore these new developments in media technology primarily from social, political, and international perspectives. The goal is to understand how the rapid proliferation of digital technologies has helped create a new landscape of popular culture across mass media and transformed contemporary Chinese society.\n\nRELI GU4307 BUDDHISM ＆ DAOISM IN CHINA. 4.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: one course on Buddhism or Chinese religious traditions is recommended, but not required, as background.\n\nIn recent decades, the study of the so-called “Buddho-Daoism” has become a burgeoning field that breaks down the traditional boundary lines drawn between the two Chinese religious traditions. In this course we will read secondary scholarship in English that probes the complex relationships between Buddhism and Daoism in the past two millennia. Students are required not only to be aware of the tensions and complementarity between them, but to be alert to the nature of claims to either religious purity or mixing and the ways those claims were put forward under specific religio-historical circumstances. The course is organized thematically rather than chronologically. We will address topics on terminology, doctrine, cosmology, eschatology, soteriology, exorcism, scriptural productions, ritual performance, miracle tales and visual representations that arose in the interactions of the two religions, with particular attention paid to critiquing terms such as “influence,” “encounter,” “dialogue,” “hybridity,” “syncretism,” and “repertoire.” The course is designed for both advanced undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of East Asian religion, literature, history, art history, sociology and anthropology. One course on Buddhism or Chinese religious traditions is recommended, but not required, as background\n\nSpring 2024: RELI GU4307\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment RELI 4307 001/11577 Th 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n201 80 Claremont Zhaohua Yang 4.00 15/20\n\nEAAS GU4352 The Fantastic World of Knights-Errant in Chinese Literature. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course approaches the Chinese knight-errant, often seen in the Kungfu films (most recently Mulan 2020), both as a historical fact and a literary imagination. It provides students with a broad overview of Chinese literature until the twentieth century, to familiarize students with the most prominent literary genres of each time period, from official history to classical poetry, from classical tale to vernacular fiction, from drama to film. Through reading/viewing the knight-errant literature, we will discuss issues including translation and comparative studies, \"history\" writing and forming, literary genre and media, gender boundary and transgression, national and trans-national\n\nPOLS GU4406 Politics in Contemporary China. 4 points.\n\nThis course will be taught in Chinese.\n\nThis course focuses on the evolution of Chinese politics since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took power in 1949. It introduces and discusses the relationship between the two “three decades” (the three decades under Mao and the three decades of “reform and opening up”). More specifically, the course aims to (1) clarify some important historical facts, (2) analyze the ideological consideration of the “official” history sanctioned by the CCP and its epistemological impact, (3) make a comparison between official view and that of independent scholars about the history; (4) try to respond to some urgent problems faced by contemporary China, and (5) provide suggestions and principles for the reconstruction of the historiography of contemporary China. Students will learn how to understand the recent development Chinese politics, how to analyze the complex contemporary history and reality of China, and how to approach issues about China from a systematic perspective.\n\nRELI GU4526 Food and Sex in Premodern Chinese Buddhism. 4 points.\n\nThis course is an upper-level seminar on appetite and its management, designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. Our focus will be on the appetites of food hunger and sexual desire, and how Chinese Buddhist teachings propose to manage these. Food and sex are separate domains of experience, but as the primary objects of bodily appetites, they are analogous. Eating and sex both involve a direct and substantive interaction with the material world that is driven by powerful desires. In Buddhist teachings, these desires are said to bind us to the cycle of rebirth (saṃsāra) and to shape the actions (karma), both mental and corporeal, that constitute our moral engagement with the phenomenal world. Hence it is important to know how a Buddhist on the path out of suffering is to manage these activities. What do monastic codes stipulate? What disciplines did lay Buddhists undertake? How are transgressions identified and handled? How do ancient Chinese and Daoist ideas inform the development of Chinese Buddhist attitudes toward sex and diet? How did Chinese Buddhist monastics come to adopt a meatless diet? How do religions use food and sex as tools for determining one's ritual purity (i.e., moral worth)? We will explore these and related topics. Despite the common perception of Buddhism as a world-denying religion focused on transcending bodily needs, Chinese Buddhists (and their Indian or Central Asian counterparts) engaged in numerous body practices with worldly benefit, while at the same time mitigating the dangers of desire through various doctrinal and practical means. This course is an exploration of those means.\n\nEAAS GU4572 CHINESE DOCUMENTARY CINEMA. 4.00 points.\n\nWhat defines a “documentary” film? How do documentaries inform, provoke and move us? What formal devices and aesthetic strategies do documentaries use to construct visions of reality and proclaim them as authentic, credible and authoritative? What can documentary cinema teach us about the changing Chinese society, and about cinema as a medium for social engagement? This seminar introduces students to the aesthetics, epistemology and politics of documentary cinema in China from the 1940s to the present, with an emphasis on contemporary films produced in the past two decades. We examine how documentaries contended history, registered subaltern experiences, engaged with issues of gender, ethnicity and class, and built new communities of testimony and activism to foster social change. Besides documentaries made by Chinese filmmakers, we also include a small number of films made on China by western filmmakers, including those by Joris Ivens, Michelangelo Antonioni, Frank Capra and Carma Hinton. Topics include documentary poetics and aesthetics, evidence, performance and authenticity, the porous boundaries between documentary and fiction, and documentary ethics. As cinema is, among other things, a creative practice, in this course, students will be given opportunities to respond to films analytically and creatively, through writing as well as creative visual projects\n\nRELI GU4617 Image Theories in Chinese Religions. 4 points.\n\nWhat does “image” mean in Chinese intellectual traditions? How did proponents of different religious persuasions construe the relationship between images and their referents differently and how did such construal change over time? Why did the practice of fashioning images often give rise to controversies in Chinese history? What makes images the object of adoration as well as destruction? Throughout the course, we will tackle these questions from diverse perspectives. The first half of the course examines a variety of accounts from Chinese indigenous classics and treatises. The second half looks at how discourses of the image further diversified after the arrival of Buddhism in China.\n\nEAAS GU4625 Socialist China in the Western Gaze (1949-1978). 4.00 points.\n\nThis seminar attempts to historicize China’s contemporary cultural diplomacy initiatives by examining the nation’s place in the world from the 1950s to the 1970s. Topics include China’s role in the socialist world of the 1950s and 1960s, global Maoist political movements, socialist China in the imagination of Western intellectuals, Western fascination with Maoist “people’s” science, and controversies over the depiction of China in 1970s European documentary cinema\n\nEAAS GU4730 Science and Technology in Chinese Media Cultures. 4.00 points.\n\nCovering a period from the late 19th century to the present, this class explores how ideas and practices in science and technology have historically entered popular imagination, social organization and political contestation, as they become mediated by various media forms and technologies such as photography, cinema, novels, television, video, internet platforms and data algorithms. In particular, we focus on how science and technology have shaped our understandings of the human body, and impacted on the various bodily experiences, from perception, cognition, to emotion and connection with others in the environment. This class helps students read media artefacts in a historically grounded and conceptually generative way, understanding media artefacts as historically conditioned, yet offering us resources for envisioning the future\n\nEAAS GU4840 CHINA AND POLITICS OF DESIRE. 4.00 points.\n\nA recent American newspaper headline announced that China has become “the most materialistic country the world.” Globally circulating narratives often interpret Chinese consumers’ demand for commodities as an attempt to fill a void left by the absence of the Maoist state, traditional religious life, and Western-style democracy. But things aren’t as simple as they appear. This course explores the intertwined questions of “Chinese” desire and the desire for China. Avoiding reductionist understandings of desire as either a universal natural human attribute or a particular Chinese cultural trait, we will track the production and management of desire within a complex global field. Drawing on ethnographies, films, short stories, and psychoanalytic and postcolonial theory, this course will explore the shifting figure of desire across the Maoist and post-Maoist eras by examining how academics, government officials, intellectuals, and artists have represented Chinese needs, wants and fantasies. From state leaders’ attempts to improve the “quality” of the country’s population to citizens’ dreams of home ownership, from sexualized desire to hunger for food, drugs and other commodities, we will attend to the continuities and disjunctures of recent Chinese history by tracking how desire in China has been conceptualized and refracted through local and global encounters\n\nFall 2024: EAAS GU4840\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EAAS 4840 001/00589 W 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n214 Milbank Hall Nicholas Bartlett 4.00 22/20\n\nPOLS GU4871 China's Foreign Relations. 4 points.\n\nThis course will review and analyze the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China from 1949 to the present. It will examine Beijing's relations with the Soviet Union, the United States, Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Third World during the Cold War, and will discuss Chinese foreign policy in light of the end of the Cold War, changes in the Chinese economy in the reform era, the post-Tiananmen legitimacy crisis in Beijing, and the continuing rise of Chinese power and influence in Asia and beyond.\n\nThis lecture course will analyze the causes and consequences of Beijing's foreign policies from 1949 to the present.\n\nHSEA GU4880 HISTORY OF MODERN CHINA I. 3.00 points.\n\nChina’s transformation under its last imperial rulers, with special emphasis on economic, legal, political, and cultural change\n\nFall 2024: HSEA GU4880\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HSEA 4880 001/15086 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm\n\n603 Hamilton Hall Sau-yi Fong 3.00 25/50\n\nHSEA GU4882 HISTORY OF MODERN CHINA II. 3.00 points.\n\nChina's search for a new order in the long twentieth century with a focus on political, social and cultural change\n\nSpring 2024: HSEA GU4882\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HSEA 4882 001/13868 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n140 Uris Hall Sau-yi Fong 3.00 20/35\n\nHSEA GU4891 LAW IN CHINESE HISTORY. 4.00 points.\n\nAn introduction to major issues of concern to legal historians as viewed through the lens of Chinese legal history.

This course seeks to place this phenomenon within a longer historical, as well as a broader cross-cultural, context. Through an examination of texts and images spanning over thirteen centuries of Japanese history, along with comparable productions from other cultures, students will gain an understanding not only of different conceptions and representations of monsters, ghosts, and other supernatural creatures in Japan, but also of the role of the monstrous in the cultural imagination more generally. The course draws on various media and genres of representation, ranging from written works, both literary and scholarly, to the visual arts, material culture, drama, and cinema. Readings average 100-150 pages per week. Several film and video screenings are scheduled in addition to the regular class meetings. Seating is limited, with final admission based on a written essay and other information to be submitted to the instructor before the beginning of the semester\n\nEAAS UN3343 JAPANESE CONTEMPORARY CINEMA ＆ MEDIA CULTURE. 4.00 points.\n\nThe course will closely examine 1) the various traits of postmodern Japanese cinemas in the 1980s and the 1990s after the phase of global cinematic modernism, 2) contemporary media phenomena such as media convergence and the media ecologies of anime, 3) media activism after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, and beyond. We will proceed through careful analysis of films, anime, and digital media, while also addressing larger questions of historiography in general\n\nEAAS UN3575 Approaching Cities and Life in Chinese Cultural History. 4.00 points.\n\nItalo Calvino's imagined Marco Polo cautions against commemorating the lived experience of a city, \"Memory's images, once they are fixed in words, are erased.\" How shall we modern students of the past retrieve the ways in which foreign men and women dwelled in everyday practice? This seminar will take you on a tour of some key topoi — as both physical and literary constructs — throughout Chinese history, availing of a selection of textual, visual, and cinematic materials that shape and are shaped by the palimpsests of changing Chinese urban life\n\nAHIS BC3868 Tokyo. 4.00 points.\n\nThis seminar will take an interdisciplinary approach to the history of the complex and dynamic city of Tokyo from the mid-19th century to the present. The class will discuss the impact that industrialization and sustained migration have had on the city’s housing and infrastructure and will examine the often equivocal and incomplete urban planning projects that have attempted to address these changes from the Ginza Brick Town of the 1870s, to the reconstruction efforts after the Great Kanto Earthquake. We will examine the impact of and response to natural disasters and war. We will discuss the emergence of so-called “new town” suburban developments since the 1960s and the ways in which these new urban forms reshaped daily life. We will discuss the bucolic prints of the 1910s through the 1930s that obscured the crowding, pollution and political violence and compare them with the more politically engaged prints and journalistic photographs of the era. We will also consider the apocalyptic imagery that is so pervasive in the treatment of Tokyo in post-war film and anime. There are no prerequisites, but coursework in modern art history, urban studies, and modern Japanese history are highly recommended\n\nSpring 2024: AHIS BC3868\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 3868 001/00159 M 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n501 Diana Center Jonathan Reynolds 4.00 15/15\n\nHSEA UN3871 MODERN JAPAN: IMAGES ＆ WORDS. 3.00 points.\n\nThis course relies primarily on visual materials to familiarize students with the history of Japan from the beginning of the nineteenth century through the present. It follows a chronological order, introducing students to various realms of Japanese visual culture—from woodblock prints to film, anime, and manga—along with the historical contexts that they were shaped by, and in turn helped shape. Special attention will paid to the visual technologies of nation-building, war, and empire; to historical interactions between Japanese and Euro-American visual culture; to the operations of still versus moving images; and to the mass production of visual commodities for the global marketplace. Students who take the course will emerge not only with a better understanding of Japan’s modern historical experience, but also with a more discerning eye for the ways that images convey meaning and offer access to the past\n\nEAAS UN3935 THE FANTASTIC IN PRE-MOD CHINA. 4.00 points.\n\nANTH UN3939 ANIME EFFECT: JAPANESE MEDIA. 4.00 points.\n\nCulture, technology, and media in contemporary Japan.

Indian Buddhist scriptures, and their translations and elaborations across Asia, celebrate an infernal cosmology that makes Dante’s opus seem like a Hallmark card by comparison. This seminar focuses particularly on hells in the East Asian imaginary with the occasional detour to Southeast Asia, India, or Tibet for purposes of comparison. Our analysis of the practices, discourses, and representations of hells in East Asia is designed to coincide with a major exhibition on Asian Hells at Asia Society NY (Sept-Dec 2020). In this seminar we will view the exhibition together and each student will discuss an object on view, which they will have selected and prepared for in advance. Each student will work on a seminar project (usually, but not necessarily, an academic research paper) throughout the second half of the seminar. Proposal, bibliography, preliminary draft(s), and presentation will be due in stages during the process and students will receive feedback at each stage before the final draft is due at the beginning of final exam period. This course is designed for graduate students and advanced undergraduates who are expected to have completed coursework in relevant areas of East Asian Studies, Religion, or Art History\n\nSpring 2024: EARL GU4017\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EARL 4017 001/00285 Th 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n502 Diana Center David Moerman 4.00 16/20\n\nEAAS GU4022 JAPANESE BUDDHIST VISUAL CULTR. 3.00 points.\n\nThis course explors the principal modes, media, and contexts of visual culture in Japanese Buddhist history.

Neither is the world built with any universal understanding of disability. This course examines what it means to be disabled in both theory and practice, especially in East Asian contexts. We begin by closely examining the concept of “disability” and its various connotations, then look at permutations of disability in Japan, China, and the Koreas before ending with recent, more radical ways of thinking about disability. This interdisciplinary course is framed by feminist approaches to definitions and applications of disability theory, drawing further on literary and technological approaches to representation of minority subjects. Multimedia engagement with issues ranging from guide dogs to nanotechnology will aid in understanding overlaps between, and barriers of, disability on an international scale, while also building a critical toolkit for understanding “able-bodied” assumptions in ourselves.\n\nEAAS GU4031 INTRO-HIST OF CHINESE LIT(ENG). 3.00 points.\n\nFall 2024: EAAS GU4031\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EAAS 4031 001/17665 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n405 Kent Hall Allison Bernard 3.00 4/15\n\nAHIS GU4110 MODERN JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE. 3.00 points.\n\nThis course will examine Japanese architecture and urban planning from the mid-19th century to the present. We will address topics such as the establishment of an architectural profession along western lines in the late 19th century, the emergence of a modernist movement in the 1920's, the use of biological metaphors and the romanticization of technology in the theories and designs of the Metabolist Group, and the shifting significance of pre-modern Japanese architectural practices for modern architects. There will be an emphasis on the complex relationship between architectural practice and broader political and social change in Japan\n\nEAAS GU4122 Japanese New Wave and Cinematic Modernism. 4 points.\n\nThis course will delve into an analytical reconsideration of postwar Japanese cinema specifically from the perspective of the Japanese New Wave. While we will aim to capture the exhilaration of the Japanese New Wave by closely analyzing existing studies on some of its key makers and their works, special attention will be given to what is left out of the category as it is conventionally understood, drawing on marginalized works and genres, such as educational and industrial films as well as pink films.\n\nFall 2024: EAAS GU4122\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EAAS 4122 001/14215 M 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n401 Hamilton Hall Takuya Tsunoda 4 14/15\n\nEAAS GU4123 Japanese Documentary Films. 4 points.\n\nThis course investigates the theories and practices of documentary film in Japan. Spanning from the 1920s to the present, we will engage in rigorous examination of the transformations of cinematic forms and contents, and of the social, cultural, and political elements bound up with those transformations. We will also juxtapose aspects of Japanese documentary film with global movements, and wider theories of documentary and non-fiction.\n\nSpring 2024: EAAS GU4123\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EAAS 4123 001/13855 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n405 Kent Hall Takuya Tsunoda 4 21/20\n\nEAAS GU4226 GENDER,CLASS,REAL ESTATE-CHINA. 4.00 points.\n\nThis is a seminar for advanced undergraduates and master’s degree students, which explores the socioeconomic consequences of China’s development of a boom, urban residential real-estate market since the privatization of housing at the end of the 1990s. We will use the intersecting lenses of gender/sexuality, class and race/ethnicity to analyze the dramatic new inequalities created in arguably the largest and fastest accumulation of residential-real estate wealth in history. We will examine topics such as how skyrocketing home prices and state-led urbanization have created winners and losers based on gender, sexuality, class, race/ethnicity and location (hukou), as China strives to transform from a predominantly rural population to one that is 60 percent urban by 2020. We explore the vastly divergent effects of urban real-estate development on Chinese citizens, from the most marginaliz4d communities in remote regions of Tibet and Xinjiang to hyper-wealthy investors in Manhattan. Although this course has no formal prerequisites, it assumes some basic knowledge of Chinese history. If you have never taken a course on China before, please ask me for guidance on whether or not this class is suitable for you.

Students are introduced to various strands of popular religion, including Buddhist cosmologies and native beliefs about nature and human life, with special attention to the relationship between the living and the dead, and explore the role of human intermediaries. The course looks at these texts and media in relationship to the local community, gender, social and occupational status, environment (both natural and urban), and historical period, exploring issues of social identity and power\n\nSpring 2024: EAAS GU4334\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EAAS 4334 001/13856 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n212a Lewisohn Hall Haruo Shirane 4.00 18/20\n\nEAAS GU4425 Women, Body, and Borders in Japanese Literature and Culture. 4.00 points.\n\nThe aim of this course is to examine the interrelated concepts of body, borders, gender construction, and sexuality as expressed in Japanese literature, religion, and culture from the premodern period to the present.

During the first half of the course, students will read the entire English translation of the tale, as well as a number of other primary texts from roughly the same time period in order to gain an understanding of the sociohistorical and literary context in which the tale came about, while the second half of the course is devoted to the reception and adaptations of the tale across various media, genres, and time periods, ranging from commentaries, noh plays, traditional paintings and even “fan fiction” to modern novels and manga. The aim of the course is to provide the students with an understanding of The Tale of Genji’s place within the Japanese literary tradition, and the impact it has had and continues to exert on all facets of Japanese culture\n\nEAAS GU4810 WOMEN AND LITERARY CULTURE IN JAPAN. 4.00 points.\n\nJapan has a long tradition of highly sophisticated vernacular literature (poetry, prose fiction, essays and poetic memoirs) by aristocratic court women, particularly from the tenth- and eleventh-century, including The Tale of Genji, often considered the world’s first psychological novel. Writings by women in the early period had a deep impact on subsequent cultural production, and these vernacular writings (as well as the figure of these early women writers) acquired a new, contested significance from the end of the nineteenth century as part of the process of modern nation-building. Gender became a major organizing category in constructing discourse on literature, literary language, and literary modernity, particularly with regard to the novel. This seminar engages in close readings and discussion of selected works from the eleventh-century to twentieth-century Japan with particular attention to the genealogy of women’s writings and changing representations of women, gender, and social relations. Issues include: genre, media, intertextuality, and literary communities; body and sexuality; and in the modern period, the “woman question” and global feminisms as well as authorship and authority. All readings are in English. Original texts will be provided for those who can read in the original\n\nHSEA GU4847 MODERN JAPAN. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\n\nThis course explores the history of Japan between 1800 and the present, with a particular focus on the 20th century. The course draws upon a combination of primary source materials (political documents, memoirs, oral histories, journalism, fiction, film) and scholarly writings in order to gain insight into the complex and tumultuous process by which Japan became an industrialized society, a modern nation-state, and a world power.\n\nHSEA GU4880 HISTORY OF MODERN CHINA I. 3.00 points.\n\nChina’s transformation under its last imperial rulers, with special emphasis on economic, legal, political, and cultural change\n\nFall 2024: HSEA GU4880\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HSEA 4880 001/15086 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm\n\n603 Hamilton Hall Sau-yi Fong 3.00 25/50\n\nANTH UN2007 Indian and Nigerian Film Cultures. 3 points.\n\nThis class places into comparative focus one of the oldest and one of the newest forms of global cinema outside of the U.S. It introduces and examines these film industries - their platforms, histories, aesthetics, and place in postcolonial life. We will explore how nonwestern contexts of film production and exhibition offer alternative histories of film. Topics include: aesthetics and genre; space and urbanization; colonialism and postcolonialism, shifting platforms of media exhibition, globalization, the notion of the popular and its relation to art.\n\nMDES UN2042 South Asia at the Crossroads of Empires. 3.00 points.\n\nIn this course we will study the late colonial and early post-colonial periods of South Asian history together. Some of the events we will cover include: the climax of anti-colonial movements in South Asia, WWII as it developed in South and Southeast Asia, the partition of British India, the two Indo-Pakistan wars, and the 1971 Bangladesh War. While we will read selected secondary literature, we will focus on a range of primary sources, including original radio broadcasts and oral history interviews. We will also study artistic interpretations of historical developments, including short stories and films. In this course, we will strive to remain attentive to the important changes engendered by colonialism, while simultaneously recognizing the agency of South Asians in formulating their own modernities during this critical period. We will also seek to develop a narrative of modern South Asian history, which is attentive to parallel and/or connected events in other regions\n\nFall 2024: MDES UN2042\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment MDES 2042 001/12322 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n303 Uris Hall Isabel Huacuja Alonso 3.00 30/30\n\nRELI UN2205 BUDDHISM: INDO-TIBETAN. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nThe course introduces the history of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism throughout India, South and Southeast Asia, Tibet, and Central Asia, its essential primary textual source materials translated from Pali, Sanskrit, and Tibetan, and the philosophical insights of some of the traditions’ outstanding individuals\n\nRELI UN2309 HINDUISM. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nConsiders efforts since 1900 to synthesize a coherent understanding of what Hinduism entails, sometimes under the heading of sanatana dharma.

It explores the plural beginnings of popular film; the many competing cinemas produced across India; the diverse protagonists (from vamps to vigilantes) that populate the imagined entity named ‘national cinema’; and the varied audiences addressed by these cinemas. Over the course of the semester, we will watch 15 of the most iconic narrative films produced in India, including Diamond Queen (1940), Awara (1951), Deewar (1975), Roja (1992), Mahanagar (1963), and Bandit Queen (1994). As we voyage with the dynamic, shifting codes and priorities of India’s fiction filmmaking, we also shadow the emergence of the Indian nation and contestations of its coherence\n\nSpring 2024: MDES UN2641\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment MDES 2641 001/13883 M W 11:40am - 12:55pm\n\n141 Uris Hall Debashree Mukherjee 3.00 53/60\n\nMDES UN2650 GANDHI ＆ HIS INTERLOCUTORS. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nGandhi is in two senses an extraordinary figure: he was the most important leader of anti-imperialist movements in the twentieth century; yet, his ideas about modernity, the state, the industrial economy, technology, humanity’s place in nature, the presence of God - were all highly idiosyncratic, sometimes at odds with the main trends of modern civilization. How did a man with such views come to have such an immense effect on history? In some ways, Gandhi is an excellent entry into the complex history of modern India - its contradictions, achievements, failures, possibilities. This course will be primarily a course on social theory, focusing on texts and discursive exchanges between various perceptions of modernity in India. It will have two parts: the first part will be based on reading Gandhi’s own writings; the second, on the writings of his main interlocutors. It is hoped that through these exchanges students will get a vivid picture of the intellectual ferment in modern India, and the main lines of social and political thought that define its intellectual culture. The study in this course can be followed up by taking related courses in Indian political thought, or Indian politics or modern history. This course may not be taken as Pass/D/Fail\n\nSpring 2024: MDES UN2650\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment MDES 2650 001/12365 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm\n\n141 Uris Hall Shaunna Rodrigues 4.00 60/60\n\nHSME UN2811 South Asia: Empire and Its Aftermath. 4 points.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\n(No prerequisite.) We begin with the rise and fall of the Mughal Empire, and examine why and how the East India Company came to rule India in the eighteenth century. As the term progresses, we will investigate the objectives of British colonial rule in India and we will explore the nature of colonial modernity. The course then turns to a discussion of anti-colonial sentiment, both in the form of outright revolt, and critiques by early nationalists. This is followed by a discussion of Gandhi, his thought and his leadership of the nationalist movement. Finally, the course explores the partition of British India in 1947, examining the long-term consequences of the process of partition for the states of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. We will focus in particular on the flowing themes: non-Western state formation; debates about whether British rule impoverished India; the structure and ideology of anti-colonial thought; identity formation and its connection to political, economic and cultural structures. The class relies extensively on primary texts, and aims to expose students to multiple historiographical perspectives for understanding South Asia's past.\n\nSpring 2024: HSME UN2811\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HSME 2811 001/11589 M W 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n301 Uris Hall Anupama Rao 4 47/70\n\nMDES UN3046 The Intersectional Politics of Religion. 3 points.\n\nThe Islamic veil controversy in France, the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar, the Kashmir lockdown, the lynching of Dalits in India – all seem to be connected through the ideas of ‘religion’, and certain religious identities as the basis for violence. What is the understanding of the religious that seems to be the operative factor in these events? Is it a singular concept of religion or are there different connotations of this category? For instance, how do we understand religion when it bifurcates the women’s movement between Western ‘secular’ women and non-Western ‘Muslim’ women? Is it the same concept when we identify ‘religion’ as the basis for the harmonious coexistence of Hindus and Muslims among certain non-elite communities in India? In this course, we ask if it even possible to understand, ‘religious’ events in the modern political world, without asking what other categories implicitly inform our notion of the religious – such as, gender, caste, culture, race and historiography. We move beyond the strict dichotomy, of religion and secularism, as something given and unproblematic. Drawing from examples and events in modern South Asia as well as other postcolonial contexts, we attempt to respond to the concepts, contradictions, and dilemmas that accompany the question of when and how the religious becomes the political in the modern world.\n\nOur weekly sessions will be devoted to reading texts from various disciplines and analyzing how the main argument is formulated and how that relates to a critique of the concept of religion in modern South Asia. Some weeks the scholarly texts will be supplemented by primary texts/case studies that will serve as direct demonstration of the problems that will be explored in the course. The engagement with sources from various disciplines will expose us to interdisciplinary content as well as diverse methods of critical analysis and argumentation. It will also help acquire the practice of identifying the central argument of the text, understand how the broad argument is actually formulated through smaller steps, and achieve the analytic skill to critically locate that single argument within a larger body of scholarship.\n\nPOLS UN3112 GANDHI, KING ＆ POLS OF NONVIOLENCE. 4.00 points.\n\nSince Gandhi’s experiments in mass satyagraha over a century ago, nonviolence has become a staple of protest politics across the globe. From the Occupy movements to the Arab Spring to Movement for Black Lives, it might even be entering a new phase of revitalization. At the same time, what exactly nonviolence is and what it can accomplish in politics is very much under debate. This course aims to understand the politics of nonviolence by examining the political ideas and political careers of its most well-known twentieth-century advocates, M.K. Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Though still venerated as founding figures of nonviolent protest, Gandhi and King have come to be remembered in ways that can misconstrue how they understood and practiced nonviolent politics. To many, Gandhi is a saintly idealist, who wanted to imbue politics with the spirit of ahimsa, truth, and conscience. Likewise, King is taken to be a spokesman for interracial brotherhood and Christian love. While partly true, these images also downplay the political side of their nonviolence – the techniques of organizing and strategies of protest that made their movements successful. We will examine the evolution of Gandhi’s and King’s political thinking in relation to the movements they led – the Indian independence movement and the civil rights movement in the US.

How do we justify God? How do we reconcile disaster, pain, and suffering with an all-good, all-knowing, all-compassionate God? This question arises in all religious traditions, but here we will study only four: the Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Hindu traditions, each of which proposes its own array of answers. Our emphasis will be on primary texts from each tradition, with introductory and interpretive secondary sources brought in as supplementary. These primary sources will be discussed in class, but especially in required section meetings. A sub-theme of the course is the “pastoral” dimension of answers to the Problem of Evil: to what extent are the answers we study comforting? This course has been created with the many crises presently afflicting our world – COVID-19, climate change, and the injustice of racism, to name a few – in mind\n\nHIST UN3272 Modern Southeast Asian History. 4.00 points.\n\nThis seminar explores the modern history of Southeast Asia, a diverse region of nearly a dozen nations that includes an extraordinary ethnic mix, all of the world’s major religions, and a broad spectrum of political systems.

Different types of people - nobles, merchants, soldiers, statesmen, sailors, scholars, slaves - experienced mobility in different ways. How did different groups of people represent such mobilities? What kinds of political, economic, and social cooperation, accommodation or conflict did different Indian Ocean encounters engender?
