        "text": "Since 1953, when Japanese television went on air fo r the first time, television dramas have played a central role in affecting and reflecting o n Japanese society, its identity, and its relationship with others. 1 Japanese television drama traditionally concentrat ed on the everyday life of “everyday” (urban) middle class fa milies, Japanese minorities and foreigners remaining very much outside its focus. This lack o f focus on the diversity inherent within Japanese society can, in turn, be seen to have cont ributed to a variety of other reflections on the nature of Japanese society as a homogeneous cul t ral zone. Indeed, it could be suggested that Japanese television dramas have helped to unde rpi and reinforce a ‘myth of homogeneity’ of the Japanese people—a myth also pro pagated by the nihonjinron (theories on the uniqueness of the Japanese) writing of the 7 0s and 80s."
