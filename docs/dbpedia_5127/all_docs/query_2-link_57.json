        "text": "Park Chanwook does not look like a violent man. When he isn't wearing glasses, his soft, round face resembles that of a gentle Tang dynasty Buddha. He speaks quietly and smiles a lot, more like a hip college professor than the director of an ultraviolent revenge trilogy. Pinned on the walls of his office in Seoul, among the movie posters and postcards, are photographs of his wife and 12-year-old daughter. His wife, whom he met at a university film club in the 1980's, reads all his scripts and is his most trusted adviser. Their daughter has seen most of his films. A nice, quiet, reflective family man, then, this 42-year-old director who also happens to be a master of imagery at times so brutal that it is almost unbearable to watch.\n\nSitting in his office not long ago, we talked about violence, or more specifically about Park's terror of violence. \"In my films, I focus on pain and fear,\" he said. \"The fear just before an act of violence and the pain after. This applies to the perpetrators as well as the victims.\" To illustrate his point, Park described a scene from his last film, \"Lady Vengeance,\" in which the father of a kidnapped and murdered child finally has the kidnapper at his mercy, tied to a chair in an abandoned schoolhouse. The father is there with his family and relatives of the child murderer's other young victims. They all patiently wait their turns to wreak a terrible revenge on the defenseless killer.\n\n\"The father,\" Park continued, \"has picked up his ax. His daughter tries to restrain him. The audience expects her to say something like, 'No, don't do it!' Instead, she asks him to leave the victim alive, so the rest of the family can also have a go at him. The audience laughs. The next shot shows the father with his ax dripping blood, terrified of what he has just done. The audience can't be cynical anymore and regrets having laughed at the preparation for such a brutal act.\"\n\nPark didn't smile while he told me this. Violence, for him, is a serious business. He may have a disturbing way of manipulating the viewers' emotions, but as he explained to me, the focus of his work is not \"the beauty or humor of violence.\" As far as his films are concerned, he thinks of himself \"as an ethical man.\" To Park, the psychology of the perpetrator is as important as that of the victim. His main characters are often a bit of both.\n\nTheir suffering might easily be written off as a black farce were the gory details not piled up with such relentless, and in the end often numbing, force. The second film of his trilogy, \"Oldboy\" (2003), follows a man who is suddenly released after 15 years of solitary confinement. We see him stuffing a live octopus down his throat, battling a gang of armed thugs in a narrow corridor, cutting off his own tongue with a pair of scissors and slithering across a bloody floor in a final deadly encounter with the man who had him locked up. Ah, yes, and along the way, he commits incest with his daughter.\n\nPark's daughter was allowed to see \"Lady Vengeance\" but not \"Oldboy,\" because of the incest. A faint, slightly embarrassed smile illuminated Park's face. \"If it had been a mother and son,\" he said, \"I might have felt better about it, but since it is about a father and daughter, I would have felt awkward.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
