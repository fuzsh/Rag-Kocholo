        "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--FlexIt, the leader in virtual fitness solutions, is naming Jason ‘The Jet’ Terry as its first Head of Athletic Performance. The nineteen-year NBA veteran’s playing career included time with the Atlanta Hawks, Dallas Mavericks, Boston Celtics, Brooklyn Nets, Houston Rockets, and the Milwaukee Bucks. The 2011 NBA Champion currently serves as Head Coach of the Denver Nuggets G League affiliate team, the Grand Rapids Gold.\n\nTerry will draw inspiration from his extensive competitive and professional experience as a coach and player to provide insight on FlexIt's offerings for athletic conditioning. Terry will create outreach programs to engage with professional sports teams, youth sports organizations and local community causes.\n\nThe FlexIt team continues to grow with the addition of the Denver Nuggets G League affiliate team Grand Rapids Gold's ownership as an investor in the company, as well as other NBA front office executives and administrators. FlexIt has been involved in numerous activations and partnerships with NBA players including Brook Lopez, Juwan Morgan, Mitchell Robinson, Georges Niang, and others. FlexIt’s current investors include an owner of the Milwaukee Bucks among other NBA affiliated investors.\n\nFlexIt’s mission is to “make fitness more accessible.” FlexIt has lowered the barrier to entry for high-level fitness experiences, removing the obstacles of distance and cost with its cutting-edge technology.

FlexIt will support The Jason Terry Foundation, Lady Drive Nation, and additional initiatives to improve the welfare of young athletes.\n\n\"I know from personal experience how important fitness is,\" said Jason Terry. \"Not just in terms of getting your reps in, but in terms of surrounding yourself with the right people, the right resources, the right plan. FlexIt is creating a new platform for everyone, not just professional athletes, to access those resources. As a player and as a coach, I know how much that can mean, and I'm proud to be a part of FlexIt's mission.\"\n\n\"We're so excited to welcome Jason to our team,\" said Austin Cohen, CEO and Founder of FlexIt. \"Not just because we're such big fans, but because his passion for fitness rivals our own. He understands our mission here, and together we're going to change the game.\"\n\nThe role with FlexIt marks Jason Terry’s continued interest in technology companies and furthering Jason’s interest in expanding his portfolio of similar business opportunities. Justin Turetsky, FlexIt’s COO, notes, “We have always seen Jason Terry being the next big name in the NBA to do big things post his playing career - excited to help the Jet expand deeper into fitness tech and wellness to align with the causes he is already passionate about.”\n\nFlexIt and Terry look forward to a long-term partnership that will include other broad scale programs and initiatives to reinforce this shared mission.\n\nAbout FlexIt\n\nFlexIt, the #1 Virtual Personal Training platform, facilitates live, on-demand, 1-on-1 personal training sessions with elite certified fitness and wellness professionals, Wherever, Whenever®.
