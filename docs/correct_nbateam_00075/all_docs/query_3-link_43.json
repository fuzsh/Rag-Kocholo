        "text": "Terry acknowledged Saturday that he has retired from professional basketball unless he receives a contract offer from the Lakers, Warriors or Mavericks, Tim MacMahon of ESPN.com reports.\n\nTerry presumably favors the former two landing spots for the opportunity to contend for another NBA title, while a reunion with the Mavericks would come more for nostalgic reasons. In any case, it doesn't seem likely that Terry will draw serious interest from any of the three clubs, given that he didn't take part in training camp anywhere and turned 41 years old in September. If this is indeed the end for the veteran guard, he'll wrap up his career with averages of 13.4 points, 3.8 assists and 2.3 rebounds in 29.8 minutes per game across stops in Atlanta, Dallas, Boston, Brooklyn, Houston and Milwaukee over 19 seasons. Terry captured his lone NBA title with the Mavericks during the 2010-11 season.\n\nTerry indicated that he intends to play another season in the NBA and would like it to be with Milwaukee, Matt Velazquez of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports.\n\nTerry has seen his role diminish as a player, playing just 51 games this past season, averaging 3.3 points across 16.0 minutes on 34.8 percent shooting from deep. But, he wants to \"see things through\" with the Bucks, seemingly as a veteran leader.\n\nTerry did not record a point (0-2 FG, 0-1 3Pt), but added two assists, two rebounds and one steal in 14 minutes during Thursday's 119-111 loss to the visiting Nets.\n\nThis was Terry's third game during his last four in which he has failed to score a point, even though he is seeing an average of 20.7 minutes in each of those games. Currently, the former Arizona star is averaging 3.2 points and 1.2 assists over 16.1 minutes per game during his 14th season in the league.\n\nTerry tallied just eight points (3-4 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 1-1 FT), three assists, three steals and two rebounds in 21 minutes during Thursday's 116-107 victory over the Warriors.\n\nTerry moved back to the bench Thursday and saw a dip in his playing time. He didn't offer a lot in terms of fantasy value but was able to contribute three steals. That makes nine steals over his past three games, something that is likely going to dissipate at any time. He could move back into the starting lineup at some stage but remains a deeper league option only.\n\nTerry will come off the bench Thursday against the Warriors, with Tony Snell re-joining the starting lineup.\n\nTerry will return to his regular role off the bench after the veteran started in the past two contests. Off the pine, Terry has averaged 3.0 points, 1.1 assists and 0.9 rebounds per contest in just over 14 minutes per game this season.\n\nTerry supplied 10 points (4-7 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 0-1 FT), three rebounds, two assists and five steals across 32 minutes in Tuesday's 105-98 loss to the Clippers.\n\nThe veteran continues to draw starts at shooting guard in place of the unproductive Tony Snell, with Tuesday's effort representing a nice bounce-back from a three-point clunker against the Spurs on Sunday. Terry has shot well in two of his last three games, with Tuesday's 57.1 percent success rate preceded by a 75.0 percent tally against the Bulls two games ago. While he won't provide much in non-scoring categories, his five steals against the Clippers served to round out his final line quite nicely and represented a season high.\n\nTerry will start at shooting guard for Sunday's game against the Spurs, Matt Velazquez of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports.\n\nThe Bucks have alternated their starting shooting guard over the last few games, trying out both Terry and Sterling Brown instead of Tony Snell. After going with Brown Friday, Terry will now get switched into the top unit and should be in line for extended playing time once again. Terry has logged 30 and 29 minutes, respectively, over his last few games, though he's still nothing more than a three-point specialist at best.\n\nTerry will come off the bench for Friday's tilt against the Bulls while Sterling Brown draws the start, K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune reports.\n\nThe Bucks have been struggling and Brown went to high school just outside of Chicago, so coach Joe Prunty may be trying to light a spark by inserting him into the starting five. As a result, Terry will head to the pine -- a role where he averages 2.8 points and 1.1 assists across 13.7 minutes per game.\n\nTerry had only six points (2-6 FG, 2-6 3Pt), two assists and one rebound in 29 minutes during Wednesday's 127-120 loss to th Clippers.\n\nTerry moved into the starting lineup to replace Tony Snell, but recorded just six points with very little else. It is unclear whether this move will stick, but nonetheless, he will be related to the bench once both Malcolm Brogdon (quad) and Matthew Dellavedova (ankle) make their returns. Terry belongs on the waivers in basically all formats.\n\nTerry will draw the start Wednesday against the Clippers, Matt Velazquez of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports.\n\nTerry's move to the starting five bumps Tony Snell to the bench. The Bucks' starters have struggled since the All-Star break, so it looks as though they are trying to shake things up with the starting lineup. It's uncertain if Terry will remain in the starting five long term, but this move should lead to an uptick in his minutes.\n\nTerry scored six points (2-8 FG, 2-6 3Pt) while adding three blocks, a rebound and a steal in 36 minutes during Friday's 103-96 loss to the Pacers.\n\nThe last time the 40-year-old blocked three shots in a game was over seven years ago. Terry was pressed into duty in the starting five due to all the Bucks' injuries, and while at this stage of his career he doesn't have much of a fantasy ceiling, he could be worth using as a bargain DFS flyer until younger legs start returning to the backcourt rotation."
