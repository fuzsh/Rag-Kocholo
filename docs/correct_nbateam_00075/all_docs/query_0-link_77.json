        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks rolled out their newest acquisitions at a Tuesday press conference, and Klay Thompson was, of course, the center of it all.\n\nThe Mavericks got him in a sign-and-trade deal with Golden State (and Charlotte) two weeks ago and brought him out to meet the media, along with forward Naji Marshall and shooting guard Quentin Grimes.\n\nWhat is Klay Thompson's number?\n\nHe'll wear 31 for Dallas. His No. 11, which Golden State has indicated it will retire, is taken in Dallas by Kyrie Irving.\n\nMavericks Jason Terry — who played a role in the team's 2011 NBA title — and Nick Van Exel have worn the No. 31 jersey.\n\nHow do you get a Klay Thompson jersey?\n\nThe Mavericks don't have one up yet on their team store, but presumably that won't take long. They'll be available here and $130 is a good guess as to the price.\n\nWhat does Thompson have to say?\n\n\"Coming here is just such a fresh start,\" Thompson said at his press conference. \"Feeling just wanted again, like I bring great value, it just gets me excited to go out there and even work out after this press conference and get shots up. Yeah, there was times last year where it was tough, where it wasn't as joyful as it was in the past.\n\n\"It's nice to kind of shed that and have a whole new fresh start, whole new group of guys to get to know, co-workers, whole new city. It's really cool, and I'm going to embrace the heck out of this opportunity.\"\n\nWhat is Klay Thompson's contract?\n\nThompson was signed to a three-year, $50 million contract.\n\nBret Bloomquist can be reached at bbloomquist@elpasotimes.com; @Bretbloomquist on Twitter."
