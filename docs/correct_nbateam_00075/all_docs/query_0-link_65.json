        "text": "After making it known earlier this year that he would pursue coaching, Jason Terry’s post-playing career has taken a new turn. Terry has been hired as the assistant general manager of the Texas Legends, the Dallas Mavericks’ G League affiliate.\n\n“I’m just excited to continue my career in basketball,” Terry said. “This is a great opportunity for me to develop my skills as far as a management perspective.”\n\nThe job title indicates a traditional front-office role, but the reality is a little different. Terry will be active in coaching young prospects, and that’s going to be mutually beneficial for both Terry as well as the Legends. The team’s new head coach, George Galanopoulos, is only 30 years old. The experience and cachet that Terry will bring to the equation will be an asset.\n\n“To be honest with you, I think it’s going to be a bit of a dual role,” Legends vice president of basketball operations Al Whitley said. “We’re still trying to figure it out. He wants to learn the front-office aspect of the business, but I also think he’s a huge asset for us on the court and being around the guys and talking to them and teaching them.”\n\nThe passion for coaching was planted within Terry dating back to his college days. He just also happened to be very good at playing the game, so coaching had to wait as he helped Arizona to an NCAA Championship and then put forth a decorated 19-year NBA career, highlighted by his eight years in Dallas and the 2011 NBA title.\n\nHe last played for the Milwaukee Bucks in 2018 and spent last year out of the game. It was finally time for him to move on to the next chapter, and he took advantage of one of the most important relationships he had fostered through his NBA days: His connection with Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. Terry had been in communication, on and off, for the last few years about what he wanted to do when he was done playing.\n\n“He said, ‘I’m here to assist. You tell me what your dreams and aspirations are, and I’ll provide that platform,’” Terry said. “Mark Cuban has a huge hand in this, and I’m only grateful and thankful that I maintained that relationship as I continued my career.”\n\nCuban said the opportunity to get Terry in the dual role is “super exciting.”\n\n“JET has great insights into the game, and I think he will be a great addition to the Legends,” Cuban said. “His skill at identifying and developing talent will be huge.”\n\nEven though the bulk of talent evaluation falls on the front office, conveying what works for a particular system is important. Coaching is still absolutely Terry’s goal, but he believes this role allows him to develop more holistically.\n\n“I knew from a basketball perspective that if you learn the management side of things, it’s just going to help you when it comes to certain opportunities that may come up, whether it’s coaching or management down the line,” Terry said. “I’m just trying to learn and grow in the business side of things, so I can have a better overall perspective when it comes to the coaching field.\n\n“My end-all, ultimate goal is to be in coaching, but I just see this as a step for growth in my after-basketball playing career.”\n\nTerry got his first taste of the job over the weekend when the Legends hosted an open tryouts session (one this intrepid reporter took part in). He was on-site to see the talent and offer his input in the evaluation process with his front-office cap on. On Monday, he was back on the court with a few Mavs prospects, this time as a coach.\n\n“As a player, I was a student of the game,” Terry said. “I would watch the other teams to see what kind of system they were running, what kind of personnel and see how I can get a leg up and gain an advantage on my competition. That was embedded in me from my high school years and I carry that on as I start my next journey.”\n\nTerry had options to choose from, including a few Division I offers as an assistant coach. Ultimately, he decided that this position, including the chance to be at arm’s length with one of the coaches he admires in Rick Carlisle, gave him the best chance at long-term success.\n\n(Photo by Glenn James/NBAE via Getty Images)"
