        "text": "Jason Terry, born on September 15, 1977, is an American former professional basketball player who transitioned into coaching. Known as \"the Jet,\" Terry played 19 seasons in the NBA as a combo guard. He achieved significant success during his career, winning the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2009 and capturing an NBA championship with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011.\n\nThroughout his career, Terry was known for his sharpshooting ability, particularly from beyond the arc. As of January 2023, he ranked eighth in NBA history for the most three-point field goals made. After retiring as a player, Terry embarked on a coaching career and currently serves as an assistant coach for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nJason Terry's basketball journey began at Franklin High School in Seattle, Washington, where he enjoyed significant success, winning consecutive state championships in 1994 and 1995. His outstanding high school career was honored when his jersey number, No. 31, was retired by Franklin High School on February 2, 2007.\n\nFollowing his high school achievements, Terry went on to play college basketball for the University of Arizona from 1995 to 1999. During his time at Arizona, Terry played a crucial role as a sophomore on the Wildcats' NCAA Championship team. He made 18 starts and finished as the team's fourth-leading scorer, averaging 10.6 points per game along with 4.4 assists and 2.5 steals. His contributions earned him recognition as the Pac-10 Player of the Year and an All-Conference First Team selection during his senior year.\n\nTerry concluded his collegiate career at Arizona with impressive statistics, ranking 12th in points (1,461), 5th in assists (493), and 2nd in three-point field goals (192) in the school's history. Notably, he remains the only player in Arizona history to achieve both 1,000 career points and 200 career steals, highlighting his versatility and impact on the court.\n\nDuring his tenure with the Atlanta Hawks, Jason Terry showcased his scoring and playmaking abilities, establishing himself as a key contributor to the team's efforts. In his rookie season, Terry displayed flashes of his potential, notably recording 22 points and 5 assists off the bench in a memorable performance against the Charlotte Hornets on November 16, 1999.\n\nAs his career progressed, Terry continued to elevate his game, achieving notable milestones along the way. On March 6, 2000, he recorded a career-high 6 steals to accompany 12 points and 11 assists in a game against the Milwaukee Bucks. Just a few months later, on December 12, 2000, Terry exploded for a then career-high 38 points in a victory over the Sacramento Kings.\n\nTerry's versatility was further highlighted on December 15, 2000, when he contributed 17 points, 13 assists, and 8 rebounds in a win against the Chicago Bulls. His impressive performances continued, with Terry averaging a team and career-high 19.7 points during the 2000–01 season, along with 3.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 1.3 steals per game.\n\nThroughout his time with the Hawks, Terry's impact extended beyond scoring, as he demonstrated his ability to facilitate plays and contribute in multiple facets of the game. Notably, on February 28, 2003, Terry achieved his first career triple-double with 23 points, 10 rebounds, and 13 assists against the Chicago Bulls.\n\nDespite Terry's individual accomplishments, the Hawks struggled to secure a playoff berth during his tenure in Atlanta. Despite their efforts in the 2002–03 season, including winning their final eight games, the Hawks fell short of reaching the playoffs, finishing as the 11th seed in the Eastern Conference with a 35–47 record.\n\nJason Terry's transition to the Dallas Mavericks marked a significant turning point in his career, as he quickly endeared himself to fans and established himself as a vital contributor to the team's success.\n\nArriving in Dallas as the replacement for the departing Steve Nash, Terry embraced his role and embraced the nickname \"JET,\" symbolizing his explosive speed and scoring prowess. Despite the pressure of filling Nash's shoes, Terry thrived, becoming a key figure in the Mavericks' lineup.\n\nIn his first season with the Mavericks, Terry's impact was immediate, as he appeared in a team-high 80 games and provided valuable scoring, playmaking, and defensive contributions. His ability to shoot efficiently from the floor, beyond the arc, and from the free-throw line solidified his importance to the team's offensive schemes.\n\nDuring the 2005–06 season, Terry elevated his game further, averaging 17.1 points per game while continuing to excel in distributing the ball and generating steals. His performances were instrumental in helping the Mavericks advance to the 2006 NBA Finals, where he showcased his scoring prowess with notable performances, including a 32-point outing in Game 1 and a 35-point display in Game 5.\n\nDespite falling short in the NBA Finals against the Miami Heat, Terry's contributions did not go unnoticed, and he was rewarded with a six-year contract extension with the Mavericks in July 2006, underscoring his importance to the team's future success.\n\nReferences"
