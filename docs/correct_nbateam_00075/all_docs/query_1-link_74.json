        "text": "Former Dallas Mavericks guard Jason Terry may have found his next coaching job.\n\nThe 2011 NBA champion is finalizing a deal to join Utah Jazz head coach Will Hardy’s staff as an assistant, The Athletic’s Shams Charania reported on Saturday.\n\nTerry, who had been an assistant general manager of the Texas Legends, accepted a role as an assistant coach at the University of Arizona in 2020 before taking the head coaching job for Denver Nuggets’ G League affiliate Grand Rapids this past season. Terry reportedly interviewed for the Jazz’s vacant head coaching spot before the organization hired Hardy.\n\nHe played eight of his 19 NBA seasons with the Mavericks, and earned the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2009. Terry also ranks seventh in NBA history in 3-pointers made (2,282).\n\nHardy is taking over a Jazz team that is undergoing much change since its first-round exit at the hands of the Mavs last season. The team has already traded its star center Rudy Gobert.\n\nFormer Jazz head coach Quin Snyder resigned earlier this offseason, ending an eight-year run of regular season success but with the team never getting past the second round of the playoffs in his tenure.\n\nSnyder guided the Utah Jazz to six consecutive playoff appearances, was an NBA coach of the year finalist just last season and won nearly 60% of his games with the franchise. He went 372-264 with the Jazz, his winning percentage of .585 ranking as 18th-best among NBA coaches who have worked for at least that long. He’s one of only two coaches to have a winning record with the Jazz, Jerry Sloan being the other.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this post.\n\nRelated:Quiet, basketball-loving ‘robot’ Jaden Hardy is eager to erase NBA doubts as Mavs rookie"
