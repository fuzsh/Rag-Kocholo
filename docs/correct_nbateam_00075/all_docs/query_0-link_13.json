        "text": "Jason Terry is back. The Mavericks legend is the new assistant general manager of the Texas Legends, the team announced on Tuesday.\n\nOne of the greatest players in franchise history, Terry now has a front office role with the Mavericks G-League affiliate. Terry last played in the 2017-2018 season with the Milwaukee Bucks before retiring. Now he’s back with the team he made his mark on the league, winning a title and endearing himself to a community.\n\nTerry told Saad Yousuf of The Athletic that he hopes his role won’t strictly be with the front office — Terry also has aspirations of being a coach.\n\n“I knew from a basketball perspective that if you learn the management side of things, it’s just going to help you when it comes to certain opportunities that may come up, whether it’s coaching or management down the line,” Terry told The Athletic. “I’m just trying to learn and grow in the business side of things, so I can have a better overall perspective when it comes to the coaching field.\n\n“My end-all, ultimate goal is to be in coaching, but I just see this as a step for growth in my after-basketball playing career.”\n\nIn a fun twist, Terry will be working alongside former Mavericks equipment manager and now current Legends vice president of basketball operations Al Whitley. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban kept in contact with Terry and extended him the opportunity. Retired players working with their former teams is far from uncommon and Cuban has made it a habit over the years — Rolando Blackman was part of the coaching staff and a TV analyst during the 2000s, Michael Finley is currently an assistant vice president, Brad Davis is a player development coach and radio analyst and Derek Harper is the current TV color commentator. Terry now deservedly joins that group."
