        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks have been one of the most competitive teams in the modern era. Since Mark Cuban purchased the team in 2000, they have reached the playoffs 18 times in 24 years, including 12 straight appearances since his first full season as owner. They’ve also been one of the more aggressive spenders willing to sign or acquire players on big contracts.\n\nHere is a list of the 12 highest-paid Mavericks players in franchise history.\n\nDirk Nowitzki: $255,371,800\n\nUnsurprisingly, all-time Mavs great Dirk Nowitzki is the highest earner in the franchise’s history. He spent all 21 seasons of his career in Dallas earning an average of $12.2 million per season. He left some money on the table toward the later part of his career to give the team cap flexibility, which could’ve made the difference for him reaching $300 million in total earnings. He will be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame this weekend.\n\nMoney per game: $167,787\n\nHighest Mavericks salary: $25,000,000 in 2016-17 (No. 8 in the NBA that season)\n\nMavericks stats: 20.7 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 2.4 apg, 47.1 FG% in 21 seasons\n\nMore on Dirk Nowitzki’s earnings\n\nMichael Finley: $124,043,779\n\nTim Hardaway Jr: $86,670,192\n\nThe first big surprise of these rankings is Tim Hardaway Jr. being this high. He’s already the third-highest earner in Mavericks history despite spending just four and a half seasons with the team. He’s halfway through the four-year, $71 million contract he signed, which means he could remain high in these rankings if the Mavericks cannot find a trade for him soon.\n\nMoney per game: $317,473\n\nHighest Mavericks salary: $21,306,816 in 2021-22 (No. 50 in the NBA that season)\n\nMavericks stats: 15.4 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 1.9 apg, 42.1 FG% in five seasons\n\nMore on Tim Hardaway Jr.’s earnings\n\nKristaps Porzingis: $78,367,843\n\nKristaps Porzingis sits at No. 4 after earning $78.4 million in three and a half seasons in Dallas. He was a beneficiary of the rising cap environment of the mid-to-late 2010s, allowing him to re-sign with the Mavericks on the richest deal in the franchises’ history at the time. He immediately had the team’s largest salary in a single season ever before it got beaten by Luka Doncic recently.\n\nMoney per game: $384,835\n\nHighest Mavericks salary: $31,650,000 in 2021-22 (No. 23 in the NBA that season)\n\nMavericks stats: 20.0 ppg, 8.8 rpg, 1.8 apg, 44.8 FG% in four seasons\n\nMore on Kristaps Porzingis’ earnings\n\nJason Terry: $72,031,167\n\nJason Terry spent the majority of his career with the Dallas Mavericks and earned the most money there, averaging $9 million per year in his eight seasons with them. After being a starting guard in his first three and half years in Dallas, he transitioned to a reserve role once they acquired Jason Kidd. The move gave him the opportunity to win Sixth Man of the Year while also giving the team a better chance of eventually winning a championship.\n\nMoney per game: $116,367\n\nHighest Mavericks salary: $11,158,000 in 2011-12 (No. 51 in the NBA that season)\n\nMavericks stats: 16.1 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 4.1 apg, 46.2 FG% in eight seasons\n\nMore on Jason Terry’s earnings\n\nDwight Powell: $71,719,219\n\nDwight Powell has spent all but several months of his nine-year career with the Mavericks. While his role has fluctuated over the years, he’s been ready whenever the team has needed him. They’ve kept him steadily paid at an average of $10 million per year since re-signing him in 2016. He should remain high in these rankings as long as he remains a Mav after re-signing for four years, $12 million.\n\nMoney per game: $123,229\n\nHighest Mavericks salary: $11,080,125 in 2020-21 (No. 112 in the NBA that season)\n\nMavericks stats: 7.6 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.0 apg, 59.9 FG% in nine seasons\n\nMore on Dwight Powell’s earnings\n\nLuka Doncic: $69,572,651\n\nLuka Doncic is set to be No. 3 on this list after the upcoming season and No. 2 after the 2024-25 season. If he extends or re-signs with the Mavericks on a new contract, he will be set to surpass Dirk Nowitzki as soon as the 2026-27 season. His next contract will likely be north of $300 million, putting him in a position to cement his spot at No. 1 for a long time.\n\nMoney per game: $210,826\n\nHighest Mavericks salary: $37,096,500 in 2022-23 (No. 19 in the NBA that season)\n\nMavericks stats: 27.6 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 8.0 apg, 46.6 FG% in five seasons\n\nMore on Luka Doncic’s earnings\n\nWesley Matthews: $63,019,807\n\nJason Kidd: $62,488,837\n\nJason Kidd only ranking ninth on this list seems too low considering he spent 10 seasons in two different stints in Dallas. That’s because he had most of his lowest annual salaries with the Maverick having spent the early and later parts of his career with them. His highest salary with the Mavericks was in 2008-09 when he earned $21 million.\n\nMoney per game: $124,978\n\nHighest Mavericks salary: $21,372,000 in 2008-09 (No. 2 in the NBA that season)\n\nMavericks stats: 10.5 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 8.4 apg, 39.1 FG% in eight seasons\n\nMore on Jason Kidd’s earnings\n\nHarrison Barnes: $60,810,274\n\nErick Dampier: $60,249,500\n\nShawn Bradley: $50,791,952"
