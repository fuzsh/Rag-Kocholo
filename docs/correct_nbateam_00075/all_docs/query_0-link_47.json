He played combo guard and is nicknamed \"the Jet\". With the Dallas Mavericks, Terry won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2009 and an NBA championship in 2011. As of March 2020, Terry has made the seventh-most three-point field goals in NBA history. He currently serves as assistant general manager of the Texas Legends of the NBA G League. In 80 games during the 2005–06 season, Terry averaged 17.1 points, 2.0 rebounds, team-high 3.8 assists and 1.3 steals in 35.0 minutes per game. He helped the Mavericks reach the 2006 NBA Finals. He had 32 points in 37 minutes in Game 1 against the Miami Heat to become the fifth player to score at least 30 points in his first NBA Finals game, joining Michael Jordan, Shawn Kemp, Tim Duncan and Allen Iverson. In Game 5 of the series, Terry had 35 points. Despite going up 2–0 in the series, the Mavericks lost to Miami in six games. The Mavericks went on to advance to the NBA Finals for just the second time in franchise history. In the 2011 NBA Finals, against the Miami Heat, Terry averaged 18.0 points, 2.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 1.3 steals and 32.5 minutes over the six games. He recorded 21 points, 4 rebounds and 6 assists in 30 minutes in Game 5 to become the first sub to record at least 20 points and 5 assists in a Finals game since Michael Cooper in 1987.
