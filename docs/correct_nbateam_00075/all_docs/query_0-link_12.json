        "text": "The Texas Legends have a new addition to their front office and it’s someone that Dallas Mavericks fans know well. Jason Terry is joining the Mavericks’ G League affiliate as the team’s Assistant General Manager.\n\n“It’s great to begin my front office career here,” said Terry in a statement. “The Dallas area has been home to me and my family for many years and the Mavericks franchise has always been family. To get to work with this organization in this capacity is exciting. I look forward to getting started.”\n\nTerry wasn’t shy about his desire to get into coaching once his playing days were over. Thanks to some help from Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, Terry found his way to Frisco, Texas, where the Legends play. Yet a role in the front office is not necessarily a traditional way to get into coaching. That’s why his role won’t be very traditional. As well as performing his duties as Assistant GM, he will also be coaching the team’s young players.\n\n“I think it’s going to be a bit of a dual role,” Legends Vice President of Basketball Operations Al Whitley told the Athletic. “We’re still trying to figure it out. He wants to learn the front-office aspect of the business, but I also think he’s a huge asset for us on the court and being around the guys and talking to them and teaching them.”\n\nThe daily in and out of the front office, where he’ll be evaluating talent, and that of working with the players is different. Even though Terry still readily states that his end-goal is to become a fulltime coach, the opportunity the Legends extended to him hasn’t deterred that dream. Instead, he sees it as a chance to grow and learn.\n\n“I knew from a basketball perspective that if you learn the management side of things, it’s just going to help you when it comes to certain opportunities that may come up, whether it’s coaching or management down the line,” Terry said. “I’m just trying to learn and grow in the business side of things, so I can have a better overall perspective when it comes to the coaching field.”\n\nTerry spent 19 seasons in the NBA before deciding to end his playing career. During his almost two decades in the league, Terry played for the Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics, Brooklyn Nets, Houston Rockets and Milwaukee Bucks. It’s time with the Mavericks, though, that he will be remembered for most.\n\nIn Dallas, Terry, alongside running mate Dirk Nowitzki, helped the Mavericks get to the playoffs during his eight-season run with the franchise. He became a pivotal figure on the roster, accepting the role of sixth man earlier on in his tenure. The league recognized him for that role when it honored him with the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Award for the 2008-09 season.\n\nThe pinnacle of his career came in 2011. Terry helped lead the Mavericks to their first ever championship, getting revenge on the Miami Heat, who had defeated Terry and the Mavs in 2006. In the Finals in 2011, Terry averaged 18 points, two rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.3 steals in the six-game series.\n\n“We are thrilled to have Jason come on board,” Legends President and General Manager Malcolm Farmer said. “His resume speaks for itself. He had a tenured NBA career for a reason, and to have him bring that skillset and work ethic to the table is invaluable for our team and staff.”"
