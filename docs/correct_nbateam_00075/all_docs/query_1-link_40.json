Drafted no. 10 by the Atlanta Hawks in the 1999 NBA draft, Jason became one of the league’s most well-regarded sharpshooters throughout his nearly two-decade-long career. Jason spent his first five years in Atlanta then landed with the Dallas Mavericks in 2004. The trade set him on a path to become a key player in helping the franchise win its first NBA championship title in 2011.\n\nJason retired from his playing career in 2018, however he continued to feed his love for basketball as an assistant coach. Before accepting his current position at the Utah Jazz, Jason was the head coach for the Denver Nuggets’ NBA G League affiliate, Grand Rapids Gold. Along with helping the Utah Jazz perfect their stride, Jet is a big part of KUDO joining the rest of the Legends family."
