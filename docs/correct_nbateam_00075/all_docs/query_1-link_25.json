        "text": "Jason Terry celebrated his 40th birthday Friday by re-upping for another season in the NBA.\n\nThe former Arizona Wildcat agreed to a one-year deal with the Milwaukee Bucks, according to Shams Charania of Yahoo! Sports.\n\nThe contract is worth $2.3 million and is completely guaranteed, Charania reports.\n\nTerry, entering his 19th season in the NBA, averaged 4.1 points per game while shooting nearly a career-best 42.7 percent from 3 with the Bucks last year, his first season with the team.\n\nThe Bucks finished 42-40, good enough for the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nTerry appeared in 74 games and has not played fewer than 72 games in the past three seasons, showing his durability, despite his age.\n\nTerry is the third-oldest active player in the NBA, behind Spurs guard Manu Ginobili and Kings guard Vince Carter, who are also 40 years old.\n\nTerry has played for six different NBA teams and won a title with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. For his career, heâ€™s averaging 13.8 points per game, with a solid .444/.380/.845 shooting line.\n\nAccording to Basketball Reference, Terry has made an estimated $106 million throughout his NBA career, not including his new agreement with the Bucks."
