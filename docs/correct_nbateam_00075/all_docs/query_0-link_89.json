        "text": "Bill Simmons has a recurring joke he digs out in mailbags: the \"All Irrational Confidence Team.\" For the longest time, Vernon Maxwell was the captain, and a well-deserved one at that. In the story he wrote after Game 6 of the 2011 NBA Finals, however, that captaincy got passed along. The captain’s C was given to the guy who tattooed the Larry O’Brien trophy on his arm before the season at DeShawn Stevenson’s house party. The guy who, after two less-than-stellar Finals games, told the best player in basketball that he’d be shutting him down for the rest of the series — and actually did. The only showoff who’s ever said \"Nobody likes a showoff,\" on national television. The guy who had Top Gun intros at the AAC and an infectious nickname and a never-fail, grin-sparking signature move. The guy who raffled off a championship ring for charity and coached his daughters’ basketball team and ran his mouth constantly."
