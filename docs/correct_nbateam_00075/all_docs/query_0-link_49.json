        "text": "On Monday evening, longtime Maverick Jason Terry kind-of tweeted news of his his retirement as a player while hinting of his life's next phase.\n\nTuesday afternoon, the Texas Legends announced that Terry has been hired as the Frisco-based G-League franchise's assistant general manager.\n\nTerry's responsibilities, however, won't be limited to front-office duties. The Legends says Terry will \"assist with all aspects of the basketball operation,\" including coaching and player development.\n\n\"We are thrilled to have Jason come on board,\" Legends president and general manager Malcolm Farmer said. \"His resume speaks for itself. He had a tenured NBA career for a reason, and to have him bring that skillset and work ethic to the table is invaluable for our team and staff.\"\n\nTerry, who turned 42 on Sunday, played eight of his 19 NBA seasons with the Mavericks, helping to lead Dallas to its only NBA title in 2011, when he memorably scored a team-high 27 points in the championship-clinching Game 6 victory in Miami.\n\nSince playing his final NBA season, 2017-18, in Milwaukee, Terry has done some NBA TV studio work and most recently completed a season in the Big3 League.\n\n\"It's great to begin my front office career here,\" Terry said in a news release. \"The Dallas area has been home to me and my family for many years and the Mavericks franchise has always been family. To get to work with this organization in this capacity is exciting. I look forward to getting started.\"\n\nTerry earned the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year Award as a Maverick in 2009, and he ranks fifth in NBA history in 3-pointers made (2,282).\n\n\"To have someone with that kind of NBA experience, who wants to be involved and wants to help build and lead this team will be great for both our players and coaches,\" said Al Whitley, the Legends' vice president of basketball operations."
