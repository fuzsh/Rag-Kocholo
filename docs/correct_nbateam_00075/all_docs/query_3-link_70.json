        "text": "The Boston Celtics need to add shooting to their team to make it as lethal on offense as the team is currently on defense. While they don’t have a lot of tools at their disposal to do so this season with the 2022 NBA trade deadline having come and gone with the annual moratorium for adding unsigned players with playoff eligibility just a few days away.\n\nBut with Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, and Sam Hauser having been effective shooters at lower levels of competition and having also shown ability in the NBA, internal development is a path the team can pursue to bolster its efficiency from deep.\n\nRecently appearing on the CLNS Media “Celtics Lab” podcast, Boston alumnus and famed shooter Jason Terry shared his thoughts on what these developing Celtics need to improve their own 3-point marksmanship: “Repetition, repetition, repetition.”"
