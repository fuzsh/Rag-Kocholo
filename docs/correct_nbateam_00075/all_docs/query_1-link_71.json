        "text": "Veteran guard Jason Terry signed a one-year contract with the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday, giving the team some needed help from the perimeter.\n\nThe 38-year-old Terry, who played the past two seasons with the Houston Rockets, tweeted, “There’s plenty of fuel left in the jet.”\n\nTerry, nicknamed \"The Jet,\" ranks third all-time among NBA players in three-pointers made and has averaged 14.3 points, 4.1 assists and 2.4 rebounds in 1,285 league games over 17 seasons. He is a career 37.9% shooter from three-point range.\n\n“Jason will bring veteran leadership and shooting,” Bucks coach Jason Kidd said of his former teammate in Dallas. “He’s a true pro on and off the court.\n\n\"Off the bench for sure he will help us with his knowledge. And I think he has some gas left.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-2 Terry started his pro career with the Atlanta Hawks, who selected him with the 10th overall pick in the 1999 draft. He played five seasons in Atlanta before spending the next eight seasons with the Mavericks.\n\nTerry was a teammate with Kidd on the 2011 Dallas team that won the NBA championship. The shooting guard also played one season each with Boston and Brooklyn, joining the Nets for the 2013-’14 season in Kidd’s first season as an NBA coach.\n\nTerry’s signing brings the Bucks roster to 14 players under contract. It is expected they will sign free agent Steve Novak for the 15th and final roster spot. Novak, the former Marquette star, ended last season with the Bucks but appeared in just three games with Milwaukee before suffering a season-ending knee injury."
