        "text": "Jason Terry\n\nDrafted by:\n\nAtlanta, Round 1, pick 10.\n\nEXPERT ANALYSIS\n\n\"No player's stock rose more from last year to this year than Jason Terry's. Terry has great speed in the open court, going on a straight line from point A to point B as quick as anyone in the draft. Terry can run all day without getting tired, and plays hard at both ends. He has good range on his shot, and can hit the 3 when given some time to shoot it. Terry also can get to the basket, but he does not really get his own shot.\n\nTerry is good defensively, with good hands and a solid work ethic. He is a gambler on the defensive end, looking for steals and was perhaps the quickest defender in the Pac-10. He is slight of build and will need to add strength, but he has shown the ability to run the point, lead and pressure the ball. Terry will add a nice dimension to any team with his speed and energy on the defensive end.\"\n\n-- ESPN's Jay Bilas\n\nCollege: Arizona Height: 6-2\n\nWeight: 172 pounds\n\nPosition: Guard\n\nAge: 21 (September 15, 1977)\n\nBirthplace: Seattle, Wash.\n\nCareer highlights\n\nNamed First Team All-America by The Associated Press as a senior\n\nAlso received First Team honors by The Sporting News\n\nHonored as National Player of the Year by Sports Illustrated, CBS/Chevrolet and Rawlings/Basketball Times\n\nAlso a finalist for the John R.
