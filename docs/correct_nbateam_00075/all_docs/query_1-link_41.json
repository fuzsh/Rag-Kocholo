        "text": "Jason Terry and A.J. Bramlett were the lone members of Lute Olson’s 1995 recruiting class at Arizona. They first met at the Reebok All-American Game in Albuquerque, N.M., as high school seniors. When Bramlett arrived in Tucson as a freshman, he was strolling through the mall with his family. Terry happened to be there as well. The two decided to meet up, and they hit it off immediately. They’ve been “attached at the hip” ever since.\n\nTerry and Bramlett were roommates for four years. Olson gave them the responsibility of hosting potential recruits who came to campus on visits. During their time at Arizona, Terry and Bramlett were integral figures in securing commitments from Mike Bibby, Richard Jefferson and Michael Wright, among others. Bramlett didn’t reveal all of their recruiting tactics, but he did say they were highly successful for a reason. Recruits were attracted to Terry’s personality and drive. Now the newest assistant on Sean Miller’s staff at Arizona, Bramlett envisions Terry having just as much success on the recruiting trail, if not more.\n\n“He really relates to players and he cares about their development on and off the court,” Bramlett says. “People are going to see it’s genuine. He talked about (getting the job) for a long time. He and I have discussed it for many years. For it to come true now, I think the timing is perfect for it. He’s the right guy to instill his values into the program, and he’s one of those guys they’re going to listen to because of his résumé and what he’s done in his career.”\n\nAfter weeks of speculation and a school-wide hiring freeze because of the pandemic, Arizona announced Terry’s hire on May 28. He replaces Justin Gainey, who left the program for Marquette in early April.\n\nTerry, 42, spent the past year serving as assistant general manager for the Texas Legends, the Dallas Mavericks’ G-League affiliate. He maintained a strong relationship with Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and general manager Donnie Nelson after leaving the organization in 2012. They always told him when he finished playing, they’d have a position for him. Terry wanted to continue to learn more about the business side of basketball while still having his hands on player development. During his time with the Legends, he was able to do just that.\n\n“I love Jet,” Cuban says. “We were lucky to trade for him from Atlanta. I got to watch him mature as a person, a father and player. There are not enough superlatives to describe how much I care about him.”\n\nIt seems as if returning to coach at Arizona has always been Terry’s goal. He had lunch with Miller last September to express his interest in joining the program. There weren’t any open positions at the time, but the conversation went well enough to when a job did open, Terry was first on Miller’s mind.\n\nTerry’s hire was peculiar to some, considering his strong words toward Miller on social media in 2018. After ESPN broke the news of the FBI’s telephone wiretap that allegedly captured Miller discussing a $100,000 bribe to ensure star recruit Deandre Ayton signed with his team, Terry tweeted that it’s time to “clean house.” However, Terry backpedaled on that statement in April 2019 during an interview with a Phoenix radio station, showing his support for Miller and reassuring the Wildcats fan base that the program was in good hands.\n\nDuring his first virtual news conference with Tucson media last Friday, Terry said he went out of his way to apologize to Miller, realizing the impact his 2018 statement had on the program. Today, he says their relationship is in a much better place.\n\n“It was an emotional tweet and I told him it was nothing personal towards him at all,” Terry said. “So we repaired that situation and Coach and I are definitely on the same page. I’m a huge, huge Sean Miller supporter. What he’s done for our program has cemented his legacy in Arizona Wildcat history, and he will continue to build and I’m just happy to be a part of that building process.”\n\nAdded Miller: “We repaired that, talked about it and had a good conversation about it. And I appreciated at that moment, just the thought that he had of reaching out and getting back on the same page and he didn’t need to explain the emotion behind what he said. I understood it, and it’s one of the things that you appreciate about our program, is that there’s people that our program matters to them.”\n\nTerry brings a wealth of experience to the coaching staff. He’s an NCAA champion. He won Pac-10 Player of the Year. His jersey hangs in the rafters of McKale Center. Terry played 19 seasons in the NBA, earned the league’s Sixth Man of the Year award in 2009 and won a championship with the Mavericks in 2011. Terry has the kind of résumé that demands respect. He’s the type of presence Arizona needs in its locker room — someone who can view the game from every angle because he has played, and experienced great success, at the highest level. His knowledge, unique perspective and charisma will only make the program stronger.\n\n“They have a guy that’s done it all,” Bramlett says. “And the way he’s done it is by being an unselfish player. He could really just fit any role in every team he played on. He was always willing to fill that role, and he filled it well. That’s a good guy to have on your staff because guys are going to listen to him when he talks about having to sacrifice for the betterment of the team. He’s been successful doing exactly that. He’s not afraid to speak up. His voice is powerful and even more so now. His energy is going to be infectious for everybody, and it’s an exciting time.”\n\nOne of the strongest examples of Terry’s unselfish nature came during Arizona’s national championship run in 1996, Terry’s sophomore year. Star guard Miles Simon was academically ineligible during the fall semester, leaving Terry in the starting backcourt with Bibby and Michael Dickerson. When Simon became eligible, someone had to be removed from the starting lineup. But instead of letting Olson handle the situation, Terry took it upon himself to come off the bench. At that point, Terry had been a regular starter since high school. But he was willing to sacrifice playing time for the betterment of the team. “That was the time when the sixth man was born,” he said.\n\nGeorgia Tech coach Josh Paster, who was Terry’s teammate during Arizona’s lone championship season, remembers that moment well.\n\n“It was a selfless act by him to do that,” Pastner says. “He understood it was in the best interest of the team for him to come off the bench so there were no issues with the other three guys. He didn’t force Coach Olson to have to make a decision. His foresight on that was incredible.”\n\nTerry returns to Tucson with no coaching experience at the college level, but had been coaching AAU girls basketball for the past 12 years during the offseason. Bramlett, who has attended some of Terry’s AAU games, describes his coaching style as “energetic.” He adds that Terry ran a tough, disciplined program, much like Olson did.\n\n“He was encouraging,” Bramlett says. “It was a positive program too. He demands excellence but will also build confidence.”\n\nWhile Pastner never played professionally, he does have experience when it comes to transitioning from college player to college coach. He began his coaching career as an assistant at Arizona from 2002 to ’08. He then served as an assistant under John Calipari at Memphis in 2008-09 before taking over as coach from 2009 to ’16, and will be entering his fifth season at Georgia Tech this fall. Pastner says there will be an adjustment period for Terry, but he’ll have “some of the best coaches in the game” in Miller, Jack Murphy and Danny Peters to support and guide him.\n\nThe fact that Terry is a local legend will make that transition a little easier too.\n\n“It was a home-run hire, without question,” Pastner says. “Jason’s beloved by the Tucson community and Arizona Wildcats fans both as a player and a personality.”\n\nTerry made an estimated $108 million in the NBA, so why would he even consider coaching in college? Why would he return to the game he just retired from? For him, it’s not about the money. It’s about impacting the lives of young student-athletes, giving them guidance, giving them somebody who has been there and done that. He already has experienced the things they inevitably will, and wants to put them in position to be successful, not only on the court but in life.\n\nTerry wants to see these young men become better sons, college graduates, husbands, fathers. He wants to continue Olson’s legacy at Arizona by sharing his lessons. Ultimately, he wants to be a part of the culture that helps Arizona raise its second national championship banner in McKale Center.\n\n“He brings all of the stuff Coach Olson taught us during those four years — stuff we’ve used since the day we left,” Bramlett says. “And he’s done it at a greater level and for a longer time. It’s good to have someone coming into the program that was there during that time and can speak to it.\n\n“I think all of his stops engulfed him into the coaching profession. And now him being able to take everything he’s learned, everything he brings to the table to Arizona is something everyone’s excited about.”\n\n(Photo of Jason Terry: Andrew D.
