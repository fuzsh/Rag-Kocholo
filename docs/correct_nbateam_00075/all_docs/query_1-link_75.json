        "text": "Hey, Jason Terry...\n\nhow is it you can be so average against the other 28 NBA teams, and then seem like the second coming of Reggie f'n Miller every time you play the Rockets??\n\nNo Yao for us, and no Smoky McPot for Dallas last night... which only allows Terry to start 7-7 and finish 13-21 for 31 killer points. Rockets look bad and end up losing even worse. So, yeah, I hate you Jason Terry. (And not in the same way I hate Limp Bizkit, or the English Patient, or the Utah Jazz... this is more of a respectful hate.)\n\nAnd it's not even just last night... this dates back to when you were with Atlanta. It also more specifically dates back to the Rockets/Mavs Round 1 series in 2005 when the Rockets were up 2-1 in the series and held an 87-82 lead in Game 4. When you took over. Finishing with 32 points and making 6-8 from deep. (Not to ruin the suspense, but the T-Mac/Yao Rockets ended up losing that series. Didn't take M. Night Shyamalan to write that twist ending.)\n\nLooking over at basketball-reference.com these aren't isolated incidents. I think it is safe to say that no player (other than Crazy Pills) has owned the Rockets more than Jason Terry has over the last 4-5 years.\n\nSo, yeah, I hate you Jason Terry. Quit being so good."
