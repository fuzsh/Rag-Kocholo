        "text": "When the Celtics made a three-year, $15 million offer and the Dallas Mavericks, the team Terry played for eight seasons and won a championship with in 2011, didn’t match, the shooting guard affectionately known as “The Jet” said he was ready to take off for Boston. “Boston was the first to call me and Doc Rivers got on the phone and said, ‘We need you, you’re our No. 1 priority,'” he told RF Sports Report, which followed Terry and his daughter’s AAU basketball team at a recent tournament in Orlando, Fla. “Had I got that same phone call from Dallas, I’d still be a Dallas Maverick. “But I didn’t, so I’m on to bigger and better things and hopefully with that team, with the way they are structured right now we have another chance to win the championship.”\n\nTerry, who will turn 35 in September, said he didn’t receive the level of interest he apparently believed he would. The 13-year veteran said three teams, one believed to be the Memphis Grizzlies, showed interest. “Not many offers out there; I don’t know why,” Terry said. “We had about three teams that were looking at me. Dallas didn’t come to the table.”\n\nOne of the all-time fan favorites in Mavs history and a constant presence in the community, Terry said he was surprised that Dallas never made a play for him after all he and the franchise had been through. “Yeah, very surprised, very surprised,” Terry said. “What I was able to do for the organization and in the community, I thought they would bring me back and they didn’t. So it’s life — something I’ll teach to my girls, too.”\n\n“I was in Dallas eight years, played with some great teammates and had a great coach and a great owner,” said Terry, who averaged 15.1 points last season and shot 37.8 percent from beyond the arc. “But what the city meant to me is priceless. Without them, I’m nothing. The Jet was born in Dallas, right there in Dallas. So, I always have a home in Dallas and hopefully when I’m done I can go back and end my career there.”\n\nAinge said the team has been in contact with the representatives of Mickael Pietrus, who had been somewhat of an afterthought. “We have been in contact with the whole list of guys you would look at,” Ainge said. “I don’t want to mention names, but we have been in contact with them. We’ll continue to find the best player we can. “We’ve added a couple of great professionals in Jeff Green and Jason Terry, and we drafted three guys that I think are very professional and add to the locker room. Talent is a hard thing to find but we put a great deal of value into what goes on in the locker room also.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Mavs had yet to make a roster move and reports were surfacing that sixth man Jason Terry was nearing a three-year agreement to join the Boston Celtics. “Honestly, it came down to the roster,” Kidd said. “Brooklyn made moves that improved the roster dramatically and he saw things were going that way. That would be my opinion from looking on the outside. He felt that if Dirk goes down he’s sitting with himself.” It also didn’t hurt the Nets’ cause that they could offer a five-year deal for $98 million while the new collective bargaining agreement limited the Mavs’ offer to four years and about $75 million. “From my point of view, I would say it’s not about the money,” Kidd said. “He wants to win. He’s been losing. He’s been getting his teeth kicked in the last couple of years.”"
