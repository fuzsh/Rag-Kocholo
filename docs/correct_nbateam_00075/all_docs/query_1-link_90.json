        "text": "Free agent guard Jason Terry has signed a one-year, $1.5 million deal to stay with the Houston Rockets, according to Real GM's Shams Charania. The Rockets held off the Pelicans and Jazz, who both pursued Terry.\n\nTerry played a surprisingly active role in Houston last season, especially after an injury ended Patrick Beverley's season as the Rockets were preparing for the playoffs. After being traded to but never appearing for the Kings, Terry signed in Houston and averaged 21 minutes in 77 games last season, hitting threes at a 39-percent rate just like he has his whole career.\n\nTerry played most of his 15-year career with the Hawks and Mavericks, starting with the former and winning a championship with the latter. He's the third-leading three-point shooter in NBA history with 2,076 makes and knocked down 126 for Houston last year, proving to be one of their more reliable bench players.\n\nAfter surprisingly steady production, Houston opting to bring back the 37-year-old isn't a huge surprise. He shouldn't play as much as last year because of the addition of Ty Lawson, but the Rockets could certainly do worse for a shooter coming off the bench."
