Can convert at high percentages despite taking a lot of perimeter shots. A ball-hawk on defense and a passionate, feisty, high-energy player who's intense and team-first. A shooting guard with a point guard's size. Lacks a distributor's mentality and can be streaky at times in terms of production. Will get posted up by bigger opponents. Has lost some lane-driving ability with age."
