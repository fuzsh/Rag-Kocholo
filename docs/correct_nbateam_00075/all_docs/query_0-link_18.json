        "text": "19 in ’19 highlights the 19 most impactful Cowboys, Rangers, Mavericks and Stars throughout the history of each franchise. Our staff voted on the top 19 from all four combined lists to create these overall rankings. You can find all of our team lists and profiles here.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks’ 2004 offseason was busy before August 4. Less than one month prior, they watched as one of their franchise cornerstones walked away in free agency to join the Phoenix Suns. Steve Nash’s departure left a void on the American Airlines Center court — he would go to win multiple league MVP awards — but his rapport with Dirk Nowitzki would be missed as well. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban had committed to building around Nowitzki and finding an adequate running mate was going to be vital. Replacing Nash was a tall task.\n\nSo, on that Wednesday in August, Cuban struck a deal with the Atlanta Hawks to bring Jason Terry to Dallas along with Alan Henderson and a future first-round pick in exchange for Antoine Walker and Tony Delk. Some deals are made with assurance and confidence that the trajectory of the franchise has been changed forever.\n\nThis trade was anything but that.\n\n“Honestly, we didn’t know,” Cuban told The Athletic. “But we were kind of desperate. We needed a guard and were more than happy to roll the dice. Obviously, (it) turned into one of the best deals we have ever done.”\n\nOn the other end, Terry came to Dallas with booming confidence. He looked at Nowitzki, Cuban’s passion and the pieces already in place and saw an instant contender that he felt he could elevate to new heights. Terry had no intention of bouncing around the NBA in his prime; he was ready to make Dallas his home. He came with the mindset that he was going to do whatever it took to make this work, and the results were instantaneous. During his first season in a Mavericks jersey, he started 57 of the 80 games he played and shot over 50 percent from the field, 42 percent from beyond the arc and 84 percent from the charity stripe.\n\nThe only other player to display that level of efficiency that season? Nash.\n\nTerry’s career has been about consistency, more in reference to his mindset than any statistical category. That’s why his legacy with the Mavericks stems from the two attributes he brought to Dallas and displayed throughout his eight-year run: Impeccable confidence and the humility to do whatever it takes to win.\n\nTo this day, Terry remains the standard around the organization of doing things the right way. In his last four seasons with the Hawks, he started 314 of the 322 games he played. Under the coaching of Avery Johnson in his first four season in Dallas, Terry was mostly used as a starter, starting 251 of his 323 games.\n\nThen Rick Carlisle arrived in the summer of 2008.\n\nCarlisle viewed Terry as a bench player, something most athletes perceive as a slight. It’s not that Carlisle didn’t see Terry’s talent or value to the team; actually, it was quite the opposite. He felt that was where Terry could best help the team win a championship. Once Terry heard that from Carlisle, nothing else had to be said.\n\n“Sacrifice was easy for me because I understood,” Terry told The Athletic. “Throughout that process, somebody is going to have to sacrifice, and I always thought it was easier for me to do that. Some may have egos, but I have no ego. At the end of the day, whatever sport I play, whatever opportunity I come across, I’m in it to win it. So if it means me sacrificing and coming off the bench, I’ll do whatever’s necessary.”\n\nTerry won Sixth Man of the Year in his first year as a bench player in Carlisle’s system. He had the mindset of embracing whatever was thrown his way, whether the team needed him to score more on a particular night or perhaps get his teammates involved more on another. In his last four years in Dallas, Terry started just 34 games out of the 296 he played in, but the team flourished with him running the second unit.\n\nThe greatest encapsulation of Terry’s impact as a bench player came in his greatest achievement as a professional: The 2011 NBA Finals. Terry didn’t start a single game in that series and he played the fifth-most minutes of any Maverick, yet he was the second-leading scorer behind Nowitzki’s MVP effort.\n\n“I kind of carved out my niche,” Terry said. “I was willing to sacrifice my role [as a starter] and then star in my role as being a sixth man. I’ve always been selfless, I’ve always been a team guy, it was always about team first.”\n\nThose same NBA Finals, or the lead up to them, also highlight his second legendary attribute: Confidence. Before the start of the 2010-11 season, Terry and his teammates were at DeShawn Stevenson’s house for a bonding dinner. Not late into the night, there was a knock on the door. A tattoo artist was there, offering the group any tattoo they wanted.\n\nThe theme of that night was the team being a family and doing what needed to be done to win a championship. Dallas had added Jason Kidd a couple seasons earlier but the Mavericks brought on Stevenson, Caron Butler and Tyson Chandler within a calendar year. They were still gelling, but the potential was there. Terry saw that roster and felt that he and Nowitzki had never enjoyed such a talented supporting cast. He liked the chances of the Mavericks winning the championship, so he got a tattoo of the Larry O’Brien trophy on his right bicep.\n\nWhile the situation seems very impromptu and spontaneous, it was also calculated on Terry’s part. Aside from Nowitzki, he was the veteran who had been around for the longest and gone through the grueling loss in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki was never one to make a flashy statement, so Terry wanted to set the tone and make it loud and clear.\n\n“If I believe, I know y’all can believe, and this is what I’m going to do to symbolize it,” Terry said of his decision.\n\nThe prophecy was fulfilled a few months later when the Mavericks beat LeBron James and the Miami Heat.\n\nTerry’s time in Dallas accomplished more than his numbers may indicate. It paved the way for the players that followed him to look at his example. J.J. Barea has long mentioned Terry’s example as a sixth man as a blueprint he followed to carve out his own NBA career. Jalen Brunson, who looks to be the next high-impact primary bench player the Mavericks churn out, has also alluded to Terry as an inspiration.\n\nTerry’s impact is special because it is defined by the fusion of two traits that are separated by a very thin line. Confidence is one thing, but combining that with humility is not always an easy task. Terry was supremely talented and perhaps at times felt he could play a larger on-court role somewhere else in the NBA. Instead, he found a way to be the sixth man on the team and play the perfect Robin to Nowitzki’s Batman.\n\nNowitzki’s career hasn’t featured a lot of consistency in star teammates, but there are undoubtedly two who hold significant weight. Nash helped Nowitzki get off the ground, and Terry took over to help him fly higher. Terry is comfortable with what he did in Dallas and has no problem with being the second player mentioned in Mavericks conversations.\n\n“Not often are you blessed with an opportunity to play with a great player such as Dirk, so I’m very grateful for that opportunity,” Terry said. “Being next to Dirk, it puts me in legendary status. I’m forever indebted to Dirk for his greatness and what he showed me, on and off the court. His leadership, his work ethic and how he impacted the team and how his impact in the community was felt.”\n\nWhen Nowitzki’s career ended three months ago, he asked that any retrospective be done to the tune of Green Day’s hit song “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).” The chorus sings, “It’s something unpredictable but in the end it’s right. I hope you had the time of your life.”\n\nTrading for Terry created an unpredictable future for Cuban in 2004. But in the end, it gave Terry, Cuban, Nowitzki and Mavericks fans the time of their lives.\n\n(Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nPrevious entries:\n\n#19: Tony Dorsett, the Cowboys’ first special running back\n\n#18: Jere Lehtinen, a Star everywhere on the ice\n\n#17: Sergei Zubov, a tall tale on the ice"
