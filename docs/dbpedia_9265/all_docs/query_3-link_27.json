        "text": "About Organic Labeling\n\nThis page provides an overview of key requirements and the various labeling categories allowed under the USDA organic regulations. Organic product labels must be reviewed and approved by a USDA-accredited certifying agent before being used in the marketplace.\n\nWhat requirements do organic products have to meet?\n\nCan a product be labeled “organic” without being certified?\n\nWhat do the organic product labeling rules cover?\n\nWhat do the four different organic labels mean?\n\nWhat about labeling for alcohol?\n\nIs labeling for textiles different as well?\n\nAre there separate rules for honey, mushrooms, or pet food?\n\nAre there any exemptions or exclusions?\n\nWhere can I get more information?\n\nWhat does a trademark do for the NOP?\n\nIs a registration symbol ® required for use with the USDA organic seal?\n\nWhat requirements do organic products have to meet?\n\nOrganic products must be produced using agricultural production practices that foster resource cycling, promote ecological balance, maintain and improve soil and water quality, minimize the use of synthetic materials, and conserve biodiversity. Products must be:\n\nOverseen by a USDA NOP-authorized certifying agent, following all USDA organic regulations\n\nProduced without excluded or prohibited methods, (e.g., genetic engineering, ionizing radiation, or sewage sludge)\n\nProduced using allowed substances\n\nCan a product be labeled “organic” without being certified?\n\nIf you make a product and want to claim that it or its ingredients are organic, your final product probably needs to be certified.\n\nIf you are not certified, you must not make any organic claim on the principal display panel or use the USDA organic seal anywhere on the package. (see exemption below)\n\nYou may only, on the information panel, identify the certified organic ingredients as organic and the percentage of organic ingredients.\n\nWhat do the organic product labeling rules cover?\n\nCovers wording allowed on both the front panel and the information panel of a packaged product:\n\nPrincipal display panel (PDP): portion of the package most likely to be seen by customers at the time of purchase\n\nInformation panel (IP): includes ingredient statement (list of ingredients contained in a product, from highest to lowest percentage of final product) and other product information\n\nView complete rules in the “Product Composition” section of the USDA organic regulations\n\nWhat do the four different organic labels mean?\n\n“100 Percent Organic”\n\nUsed to label any product that contains 100 percent organic ingredients (excluding salt and water, which are considered natural)\n\nMost raw, unprocessed or minimally processed farm crops can be labeled “100 percent organic”\n\nPDP: May include USDA organic seal and/or 100 percent organic claim\n\nIP: Identify organic ingredients (e.g., organic dill) or via asterisk or other mark\n\n“Organic”\n\nAny product that contains a minimum of 95 percent organic ingredients (excluding salt and water)\n\nUp to 5 percent of ingredients may be nonorganic agricultural products and/or nonagricultural products on the National List (nonorganic agricultural products and several nonagricultural products on the National List may only be used if they are not commercially available as organic)\n\nPDP: May include USDA organic seal and/or organic claim\n\nIP: Identify organic ingredients (e.g., organic dill) or via asterisk or other mark\n\n“Made with Organic ______”\n\nProduct contains at least 70 percent organically produced ingredients (excluding salt and water), with a number of detailed constraints regarding ingredients that comprise the nonorganic portion\n\nPDP: May state “made with organic (insert up to three ingredients or ingredient categories)”; must not include USDA organic seal anywhere, represent finished product as organic, or state “made with organic ingredients”\n\nIP: Identify organic ingredients (e.g., organic dill) or via asterisk or other mark\n\nSpecific Organic Ingredient Listings\n\nSpecific organic ingredients may be listed in the ingredient statement of products containing less than 70 percent organic contents—for example, “Ingredients: water, barley, beans, organic tomatoes, salt.”\n\nPDP: Must not include USDA organic seal anywhere or the word “organic”\n\nIP: May only list certified organic ingredients as organic in the ingredient list and the percentage of organic ingredients; remaining ingredients not required to follow the USDA organic regulations\n\nWhat about labeling for alcoholic beverages?\n\nMust meet both USDA organic requirements and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regulations, including sulfite labeling requirements\n\nAny use of added sulfites makes the wine only eligible for the “made with” labeling category; may not use the USDA organic seal\n\nSulfites may only be added to wine “made with” organic grapes; wine labeled as “made with” other organic fruit (e.g., apples) may not contain added sulfites\n\nAll organic alcohol labels must be reviewed by an organic certifying agent and the TTB\n\nMore:\n\nWine with organic references (pdf)\n\nMalt beverages with organic references (pdf)\n\nDistilled spirits with organic references (pdf)\n\nIs labeling for textiles different as well?\n\nFinished product is certified organic and produced in full compliance with the USDA organic regulations: entire product may be labeled organic and display the USDA organic seal\n\nAll instances of specific fibers in finished product are certified organic: label may claim the specific fibers are organic and identify the percentage of organic fibers\n\nGlobal Organic Textile Standard (GOTS): textiles that meet this standard may be sold as organic in the United States. Textiles: Unless the finished product is certified to the USDA organic regulations, product labels may not state or imply that the finished product is USDA organic or use the USDA organic seal.\n\nOrganic Textile Policy (pdf)\n\nAre there separate rules for honey, mushrooms, or pet food?\n\nThe USDA organic regulations do not currently include separate standards for these products.\n\nHoney, mushrooms, and pet food may be certified to current production and handling standards and must comply with labeling requirements for organic products certified under these standards. Talk to your certifier for details.\n\nAre there any exemptions?\n\nProducers who market less than $5,000 worth of organic products annually are not required to apply for organic certification, with the following caveats:\n\nMust comply with the organic production and handling requirements of the regulations, including recordkeeping (for at least 3 years).\n\nProducts from such noncertified operations cannot be used as organic ingredients in processed products produced by another operation nor may they display the USDA certified organic seal.\n\nWhere can I get more information?\n\nUsing the Organic Seal\n\nOrganic Labels and the Organic Seal Explained\n\nUSDA Organic Labeling Regulations\n\nOrganic Cosmetics Factsheet (pdf)\n\nContact Us\n\nTraining: Take the Learning Center training course “Organic Regulations and Retail Labeling” (account required)\n\nNo Learning Center account? Sign up now\n\nNeed help? View detailed instructions (pdf)\n\nWhat does a trademark do for organic farms and businesses?\n\nThe registered trademark protects the “USDA organic” name and logo from misuse by giving the USDA intellectual property rights to restrict the use of the registered mark, or a confusingly similar one, in agricultural production and handling. The new authority, which protects all certified farms and businesses, applies to products displaying the USDA organic seal within the U.S. and at its borders.\n\nIs a registration symbol ® required for use with the USDA organic seal?\n\nCertified organic operations are not required to change their labels to include the registration mark ® of the seal, and certified organic products currently in the marketplace still meet the requirements of certification. Operations may choose either version of the seal and existing labels do not need to be revised or discarded.\n\nIf operations choose the updated version of the organic seal with the registration mark ®, it is available for download in multiple file formats on the AMS website. As always, certified operations are to seek approval from their certifier before making any product label changes..\n\nAbout NOP\n\nAbout NOP\n\nContact NOP"
