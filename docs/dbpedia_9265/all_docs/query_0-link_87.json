        "text": "Product Specific Information\n\nDescription: The FJK-16s antibody reacts with mouse, rat, dog, porcine, bovine and cat Foxp3 also known as FORKHEAD BOX P3, SCURFIN, and JM2; cross reactivity of this antibody to other proteins has not been determined. Foxp3, a 49-55 kDa protein, is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcriptional regulators, and was identified as the gene defective in 'scurfy' (sf) mice. Constitutive high expression of foxP3 mRNA has been shown in CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells), and ectopic expression of foxp3 in CD4+CD25- cells imparts a Treg phenotype in these cells.\n\nImmunoblotting with FJK-16s antibody has mapped the epitope to amino acids 75-125 of the mouse Foxp3 protein. In the human, this region has been shown to be alternatively spliced at the mRNA level. Both the alternatively-spliced and non-spliced isoforms are present in the CD4+CD25+ subset of lymphocytes. Preliminary RT-PCR experiments have not revealed this alternatively-spliced isoform in mouse splenocytes, suggesting different gene regulation in the mouse and human.\n\nApplications Reported: This FJK-16s antibody has been reported for use in western blotting, immunohistochemical staining of frozen tissue sections, immunohistochemical staining, and immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. For additional information, please see Foxp3 FAQs.\n\nApplications Tested: This FJK-16s antibody has been tested by immunoblotting (WB) (1-5 µ/mL) of mouse splenocytes. The FJK-16s antibody has been tested by immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded mouse tissue using low or high pH antigen retrieval and can be used at less than or equal to 5 µg/mL. It is recommended that the antibody be carefully titrated for optimal performance in the assay of interest.\n\nPurity: Greater than 90%, as determined by SDS-PAGE.\n\nAggregation: Less than 10%, as determined by HPLC.\n\nFiltration: 0.2 µm post-manufacturing filtered.\n\nTarget Information\n\nFOXP3 (Forkhead box protein 3) is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcriptional regulators, highly conserved across mammals, and essential for normal immune homeostasis. FOXP3 is 381 amino acids long, stably and constitutively expressed at a high level in CD25 + CD4 positive regulatory T cells, a low level in CD4-positive/CD25-negative cells, and is absent in CD4-negative/CD8-positive T cells. FOXP3 may be a master regulatory gene, and a more specific marker of regulatory T cells. Defects in the gene encoding FOXP3 protein cause the scurfy phenotype in mice. In humans FOXP3 defects play a role in IPEX syndrome (immune dysfunction, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome), also known as X-linked autoimmunity-allergic dysregulation (XLAAD) syndrome. Transcript variants of FOXP3 encoding different isoforms have been identified. In human breast and colon cancer cells, expression of FOXP3 is regulated by p53 in response to the DNA damage."
