        "text": "A data dictionary is critical to making your research more reproducible because it allows others to understand your data. The purpose of a data dictionary is to explain what all the variable names and values in your spreadsheet really mean.\n\nVariable names\n\nReadable variable name\n\nMeasurement units\n\nAllowed values\n\nDefinition of the variable\n\nSynonyms for the variable name (optional)\n\nDescription of the variable (optional)\n\nOther resources\n\nVariable names\n\nThe first column should contain your variable names exactly as they appear in your spreadsheet.\n\nReadable variable name\n\nThis column should contain short but human-readable variable names\n\nFor instance, if â€˜VAR1â€™ is a variable name referring to weight, then an appropriate readable variable name for VAR1 is â€˜weightâ€™.\n\nYou can use spaces, characters, and capital letters.\n\nThis is the name that you would use to label graphs and other figures.\n\nMeasurement units\n\nThis column should contain the measurement units for the variable.\n\nFor instance, if a column contains measurements of time, it should be clear whether they are measured in hours, minutes, or seconds.\n\nAllowed values\n\nA column should contain the range of values or accepted values for the variable.\n\nThis helps identify data entry errors.\n\nMinimum and maximum values should be included.\n\nChosen values (e.g., â€œmaleâ€, â€œfemaleâ€) should be included and detailed, if needed, in the description column (see below).\n\nDefinition of the variable\n\nThis column should contain a definition of the variable.\n\nThe variable definition reflects the way you use the term and intend the term to be used by others who wish to understand your work.\n\nWhile there are many kinds of definition, where possible, please provide a definition with the following genus-differentia form:\n\nâ€œA is a B that Cs.â€\n\nFor instance, â€œAn a) attitude is a b) disposition c) to think or feel that is about something or someone, typically one that is reflected in a person's behavior.â€\n\nAvoid circular definitions (e.g. â€œA baseball is a ball used in baseball.â€)\n\nSynonyms for the variable name (optional)\n\nThis column should contain, if relevant, one or more words that could be substituted for the variable name.\n\nThese synonyms should reflect the meaning of the variable name as you use it, and not merely as the variable name might be used in a different context.\n\nAgain, the purpose is to convey the meaning of the variable term you use in your data.\n\nDescription of the variable (optional)\n\nThe final column should contain, where needed, a longer explanation of the variable.\n\nThis is a human readable description with enough information for others to understand what the variable refers to.\n\nIt should also explain terms in the variableâ€™s definition in more depth if needed. For instance, a description of the variable might clarify what is intended by â€˜dispositionâ€™ in the above definition.\n\nIt could provide sources for definitions if those definitions are not the researcherâ€™s own.\n\nOther resources\n\nThe Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) is an international standard for describing the data produced by surveys and other observational methods in the social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences.
