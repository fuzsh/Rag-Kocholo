Go to Solution.\n\nSome confusion exists here.\n\nThe Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) function on network routers is being confused with the WPS-PIN requirement for the HP printers. If you can already 'see' your HP-PRINTER in your computer's 'discovered' or \"Add Printers\" device list, you are already connected to your desired network, and so is your new HP-PRINTER.\n\nThe WPS-PIN required/requested during the HP Printer-setup (blue-box-pop-up) is a part of the security functions which controls who can print to this printer.\n\nHere is the solution.\n\nI found this solution on another page:\n\n( https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printers-Archive-Read-Only/Find-WPS-Pin-NUMBER/td-p/5600936 ).\n\nThis solution was posted by \"IM64 Tutor\".\n\nI am posting it here to shorten the distance for others:\n\nRe: Find WPS Pin NUMBER\n\nOptions\n\n‎05-17-2016 09:46 PM\n\nI found my WPS Pin Number accidently.\n\n1. Be close enough to printer to see the display\n\n2. On your computer, select Add Printer from the Control Panel\n\n3. When you find your printer displayed select it\n\n4. When it asked for your WPS Pin take a look at the printer display. This number is shown at this time, but doesn't stay up long\n\n5. Type the number into the space provided on your computer screen\n\n6. Wait while it begins loading the printer.\n\nThis worked for me. Hopefully it will help someone else. It would be nice if HP would tell you that the number is found on the printer display, because I didn't find it in any of the documentation.\n\nView solution in original post\n\nSome confusion exists here.\n\nThe Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) function on network routers is being confused with the WPS-PIN requirement for the HP printers.
