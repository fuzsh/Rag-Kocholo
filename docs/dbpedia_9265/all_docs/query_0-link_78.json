        "text": "Cow's Milk Allergy\n\nCow's milk allergy is the most common food allergy in early childhood and affects about 2.5% of infants during their first years of life5-7 with symptoms ranging from relatively mild to severe and life-threatening.8 Egg allergy can cause severe allergic reactions in sensitized children, and egg avoidance can cause significant dietary limitations. Although most infants outgrow cow’s milk allergy by age three, it can become persistent in a minority of children. Cow’s milk allergy is associated with an increased risk of development of other allergic disorders, such as allergic asthma, atopic eczema, rhinoconjunctivitis, or egg allergy.9\n\nApproximately 75% of children with cow’s milk allergy react to fresh milk and tolerate extensively heated cow’s milk.10\n\nCow's Milk Components\n\nBos d 8, Casein\n\n• 80% of the milk protein content is casein (Bos d 8).11\n\n• Bos d 8 is relatively stable to heat and retains its allergenicity after extensive heating.10,11\n\n• The levels of Bos d 8 IgE antibodies reflect the severity of the milk allergy.12-15\n\n• High levels of Bos d 8 IgE antibodies indicate allergy to both fresh and baked milk.16\n\n• Low or undetectable levels of Bos d 8 IgE antibodies indicate tolerance to baked milk products, eg, cakes and cookies.16\n\n• Patients sensitized to Bos d 8 are also at risk of severe reactions upon intake of nondairy products in which casein may be used as an additive (eg, in sausages, chocolate, and potato chips).17,18\n\n• Children often outgrow their milk allergy—early signs of tolerance development can be detected by tracking the reduction in cow’s milk IgE (extract)19,20 and/or the component Bos d 8 IgE levels over time.15,21-23\n\n• Quantifying IgE levels to Bos d 8 can help determine if a challenge test should be performed.24-26\n\nBos d 4, α-lactalbumin\n\nBos d 5, β-lactoglobulin\n\n• Whey proteins make up twenty percent of the protein in milk.11 Whey proteins include α–lactalbumin (Bos d 4) and β–lactoglobulin (Bos d 5)11\n\n• Whey proteins Bos d 4 and Bos d 5 are rather heat labile and, therefore, destroyed by cooking.11\n\n• Patients sensitized to Bos d 4 and Bos d 5 but with low levels of IgE to Bos d 8 may tolerate baked milk products.12,15,27,28\n\n• As tolerance develops, decreasing levels of IgE to Bos d 4 and Bos d 5 are also often observed.21"
