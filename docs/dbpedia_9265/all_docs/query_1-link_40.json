A, Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells were infected with control shRNA, OGT shRNA2 alone, or with wild‐type eIF4E lentivirus. The cell lysates were harvested for western blotting analysis using indicated antibodies. beta ‐actin expression was served as a loading control. B, Cell proliferation of Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells infected with lentiviruses as in panel (A) were measured with CCK8 assay. (C‐H) Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells infected with lentiviruses as in panel (A) were seeded into 96‐well plates. After 12 d, tumorsphere were counted and quantified. Representative images of sphere (scale bars, 100 μm) were shown (C, F). The diameter of sphere (D, G) and number of sphere (E, H) were count. Data represent mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments. The two‐tailed Student's t tests were used. **P < 0.01. I, Huh7 cells expressing either OGT shRNA2 alone or with wild‐type eIF4E lentivirus were incubated with PE‐labelled anti‐AC133 antibody. The percentages of CD133+ cells in graphs were analysed by flow cytometry. Black line, control IgG staining; red line, CD133 staining. J, Cell lysates were examined by western blotting with indicated antibodies. The right panel showcases relative protein amounts of different groups. Error bars represent ±SD of triplicate experiments. **P < 0.01; n.s, no significance. K, Huh7 cells were collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody against eIF4E or normal mouse IgG. Total RNAs were purified from immunocomplexes and subjected to RT‐PCR to measure Sox2, OCT4, and KLF4 mRNAs associated with eIF4E Image collected and cropped by CiteAb from the following publication (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30677218), licensed under a CC-BY license.
