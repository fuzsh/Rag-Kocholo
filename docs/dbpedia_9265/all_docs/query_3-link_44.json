        "text": "(Printer-friendly PDF version | 311 KB)\n\n(Large Print PDF version | 319 KB)\n\n(Spanish version)\n\nWords are powerful.\n\nThe words you use and the way you portray individuals with disabilities matters. This factsheet provides guidelines for portraying individuals with disabilities in a respectful and balanced way by using language that is accurate, neutral and objective.\n\n1. Ask to find out if an individual is willing to disclose their disability.\n\nDo not assume that people with disabilities are willing to disclose their disability. While some people prefer to be public about their disability, such as including information about their disability in a media article, others choose to not be publically identified as a person with a disability.\n\n2. Emphasize abilities, not limitations.\n\nChoosing language that emphasizes what people can do instead of what they can’t do is empowering.\n\n3. In general, refer to the person first and the disability second.\n\nPeople with disabilities are, first and foremost, people. Labeling a person equates the person with a condition and can be disrespectful and dehumanizing. A person isn’t a disability, condition or diagnosis; a person has a disability, condition or diagnosis. This is called Person-First Language.\n\n4. However, always ask to find out an individual’s language preferences.\n\nPeople with disabilities have different preferences when referring to their disability. Some people see their disability as an essential part of who they are and prefer to be identified with their disability first – this is called Identity-First Language. Others prefer Person-First Language. Examples of Identity-First Language include identifying someone as a deaf person instead of a person who is deaf, or an autistic person instead of a person with autism.\n\n5. Use neutral language.\n\nDo not use language that portrays the person as passive or suggests a lack of something: victim, invalid, defective.\n\n6. Use language that emphasizes the need for accessibility rather than the presence of a disability.\n\nUse\n\nDon’t Use\n\nAccessible parking\n\nHandicapped parking\n\nAccessible restroom\n\nDisabled restroom\n\nNote that ‘handicapped’ is an outdated and unacceptable term to use when referring to individuals or accessible environments.\n\n7. Do not use condescending euphemisms.\n\nTerms like differently-abled, challenged, handi-capable or special are often considered condescending.\n\n8. Do not use offensive language.\n\nExamples of offensive language include freak, retard, lame, imbecile, vegetable, cripple, crazy, or psycho.\n\n9. Describing people without disabilities.\n\nIn discussions that include people both with and without disabilities, do not use words that imply negative stereotypes of those with disabilities.\n\n10. Remember that disability is not an illness and people with disabilities are not patients.\n\nPeople with disabilities can be healthy, although they may have a chronic condition such as arthritis or diabetes. Only refer to someone as a patient when his or her relationship with a health care provider is under discussion.\n\n11. Do not use language that perpetuates negative stereotypes about psychiatric disabilities.\n\nMuch work needs to be done to break down stigma around psychiatric disabilities. The American Psychiatric Association has new guidelines for communicating responsibly about mental health.\n\n12. Portray successful people with disabilities in a balanced way, not as heroic or superhuman.\n\nDo not make assumptions by saying a person with a disability is heroic or inspiring because they are simply living their lives. Stereotypes may raise false expectations that everyone with a disability is or should be an inspiration. People may be inspired by them just as they may be inspired by anyone else. Everyone faces challenges in life.\n\n13. Do not mention someone’s disability unless it is essential to the story.\n\nThe fact that someone is blind or uses a wheelchair may or may not be relevant to the article you are writing. Only identify a person as having a disability if this information is essential to the story. For example, say “Board president Chris Jones called the meeting to order.” Do not say, “Board president Chris Jones, who is blind, called the meeting to order.” It’s ok to identify someone’s disability if it is essential to the story. For example, “Amy Jones, who uses a wheelchair, spoke about her experience with using accessible transportation.”\n\n14. Create balanced human-interest stories instead of tear-jerking stories.\n\nTearjerkers about incurable diseases, congenital disabilities or severe injury that are intended to elicit pity perpetuate negative stereotypes.\n\nResources\n\nPeople First Language and More, Disability is Natural!\n\nGuidelines: How to Write and Report About People with Disabilities, and “Your Words, Our Image” (poster), Research & Training Center on Independent Living, University of Kansas, 8th Edition, 2013."
