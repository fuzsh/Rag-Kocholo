        "text": "I didn't dig in much into this but because you used fill=cond in ggplot(),\n\n+ labs(color='NEW LEGEND TITLE')\n\nmight not have worked. However it you replace color by fill, it works!\n\n+ labs(fill='NEW LEGEND TITLE')\n\nThis worked for me in ggplot2_2.1.0\n\nSince you have two densitys I imagine you may be wanting to set your own colours with scale_fill_manual.\n\nIf so you can do:\n\ndf <- data.frame(x=1:10,group=c(rep(\"a\",5),rep(\"b\",5))) legend_title <- \"OMG My Title\" ggplot(df, aes(x=x, fill=group)) + geom_density(alpha=.3) + scale_fill_manual(legend_title,values=c(\"orange\",\"red\"))\n\nNone of the above code worked for me.\n\nHere's what I found and it worked.\n\nlabs(color = \"sale year\")\n\nYou can also give a space between the title and the display by adding \\n at the end.\n\nlabs(color = 'sale year\\n\")\n\nSince in your code you used ggplot(data, fill= cond) to create the histogram you need to add the legend title by also using \"fill\" in the label section i.e. +labs(fill=\"Title name\"). If you were using a different type of plot where the code was ggplot(data, colour= cond), then you could use +labs(colour= \"Title Name\"). In summary, the lab argument has to match the aes argument.\n\nI have used + guides(fill=guide_legend(\"my awesome title\")) to change the legend title on geom_bar plots but it did not seem to work for geom_point.\n\nThere's another very simple answer which can work for some simple graphs.\n\nJust add a call to guide_legend() into your graph.\n\nggplot(...) + ... + guide_legend(title=\"my awesome title\")\n\nAs shown in the very nice ggplot docs.\n\nIf that doesn't work, you can more precisely set your guide parameters with a call to guides:\n\nggplot(...) + ... + guides(fill=guide_legend(\"my awesome title\"))\n\nYou can also vary the shape/color/size by specifying these parameters for your call to guides as well.\n\nThe way i am going to tell you, will allow you to change the labels of legend, axis, title etc with a single formula and you don't need to use memorise multiple formulas. This will not affect the font style or the design of the labels/ text of titles and axis.\n\nI am giving the complete answer of the question below.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2) rating <- c(rnorm(200), rnorm(200, mean=.8)) cond <-factor(rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 200)) df <- data.frame(cond,rating ) k<- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=rating, fill=cond))+ geom_density(alpha = .3) + xlab(\"NEW RATING TITLE\") + ylab(\"NEW DENSITY TITLE\") # to change the cond to a different label k$labels$fill=\"New Legend Title\" # to change the axis titles k$labels$y=\"Y Axis\" k$labels$x=\"X Axis\" k\n\nI have stored the ggplot output in a variable \"k\". You can name it anything you like. Later I have used\n\nk$labels$fill =\"New Legend Title\"\n\nto change the legend. \"fill\" is used for those labels which shows different colours. If you have labels that shows sizes like 1 point represent 100, other point 200 etc then you can use this code like this-\n\nk$labels$size =\"Size of points\"\n\nand it will change that label title.\n\nMany people spend a lot of time changing labels, legend labels, titles and the names of the axis because they don't know it is possible to load tables in R that contains spaces \" \". You can however do this to save time or reduce the size of your code, by specifying the separators when you load a table that is for example delimited with tabs (or any other separator than default or a single space):\n\nread.table(sep = '\\t')\n\nor by using the default loading parameters of the csv format:\n\nread.csv()\n\nThis means you can directly keep the name \"NEW LEGEND TITLE\" as a column name (header) in your original data file to avoid specifying a new legend title in every plot."
