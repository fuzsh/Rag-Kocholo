        "meta_description": "The flotillins/reggie proteins are associated with noncaveolar membrane microdomains and have been implicated in the regulation of a clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytosis pathway. Endocytosis is required for the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and thus to initiate the release of the neurotoxic β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), the major component of extracellular plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Here, we report that small interference RNA-mediated downregulation of flotillin-2 impairs the endocytosis of APP, in both neuroblastoma cells and primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, and reduces the production of Aβ. Similar to tetanus neurotoxin endocytosis, but unlike the internalization of transferrin, clathrin-dependent endocytosis of APP requires cholesterol and adaptor protein-2 but is independent of epsin1 function. Moreover, on a nanoscale resolution using stimulated emission depletion microscopy and by Förster resonance energy transfer with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, we provide evidence that flotillin-2 promotes the clustering of APP at the cell surface. We show that the interaction of flotillin-2 with APP is dependent on cholesterol and that clustering of APP enhances its endocytosis rate. Together, our data suggest that cholesterol/flotillin-dependent clustering of APP may stimulate the internalization into a specialized clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway to promote amyloidogenic processing.",

        "text": "Flotillin modulates the endocytosis of APP\n\nPrevious studies have shown that APP endocytosis is required for β-cleavage to occur. Although a significant fraction of the Swedish mutant of APP is already processed by β-secretase during transport through the biosynthetic pathway (Haass et al., 1995), inhibition of endocytosis in N2a cells markedly reduces β-cleavage of swAPP in N2a cells (Perez et al., 1996; Ehehalt et al., 2003; Rajendran et al., 2006). Given a recently proposed flotillin-dependent endocytosis pathway (Glebov et al., 2006) and the reduction of amyloidogenic APP processing after flotillin knockdown detected here, we investigated whether flotillin regulated the endocytosis of APP. We created stable N2a cell lines expressing shRNA directed against flotillin-2 and control cells expressing the backbone vector without the flotillin-2 shRNA. The successful depletion of flotillin mRNA (∼90%) and protein levels (∼70%) was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting (data not shown). To analyze whether the reduction of flotillin-2 affected the endocytosis of APP, we transfected a CFP–swAPP fusion protein (Ehehalt et al., 2003) into the stably expressing flotillin-2 shRNA and control cells and performed a quantitative immunofluorescence-based APP endocytosis assay. In this assay, cell surface APP was labeled by incubating cells on ice with an antibody against the N-terminal CFP. After washing, cells were incubated at 37°C for different time spans (5, 20, and 45 min) to allow internalization of antibody-bound APP. Cells were subsequently incubated on ice with a Cy5-conjugated secondary antibody to visualize cell-surface retained APP. After fixing and permeabilization, internalized APP was visualized using a secondary Cy3-conjugated antibody directed against the rabbit anti-CFP primary antibody. During the time course of internalization, APP gradually disappeared from the cell surface and accumulated within the cell (Fig. 2A). No antibody uptake was observed when untransfected cells were subjected to this endocytosis assay. In flotillin-2 knockdown cells, a significant reduction of swAPP internalization was observed in this assay compared with control cells (44% reduction) (Fig. 2B), whereas overexpression of flotillin-2 stimulated the endocytosis of APP (Fig. 2D). Importantly and consistent with a previous report, flotillin-2 knockdown did not interfere with the uptake of rhodamine–transferrin, ruling out unspecific off-target effects on clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Fig. 2B) (Glebov et al., 2006). We also observed a reduction of the endocytosis of wild-type APP after depleting flotillin-2 with siRNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the effect observed for flotillin-2 knockdown on APP internalization, APP endocytosis was not impaired by knockdown of flotillin-1 (supplemental Fig. 2A, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), which is consistent with our finding, that only flotillin-2 affects the processing of APP.\n\nSimilar results were obtained in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, which, like N2a cells, do not express detectable levels of caveolin but produce large amounts of flotillin (Cameron et al., 1997). Flotillin-2-specific siRNA was delivered into hippocampal neurons by nucleofection, which resulted in an ∼70% reduction of both flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 protein levels (supplemental Fig. 1B,C, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Neurons were infected with recombinant adenovirus to express CFP–swAPP 4–5 d after nucleofection. Antibody-uptake experiments revealed that flotillin-2 knockdown reduces the internalization of APP by ∼68% compared with control siRNA nucleofected neurons (n = 154 cells, p < 0.0005, t test) (Fig. 2C). Together, our results show that flotillin-2 modulates β-secretase-mediated processing of APP by regulating its endocytosis.\n\nOur results are surprising because flotillin-1 has been implicated previously in the regulation of a clathrin- and caveolin-independent pathway (Glebov et al., 2006), although it is well established that APP is internalized in a clathrin-dependent manner (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Koo et al., 1996; Perez et al., 1999). Because the endocytosis of APP has mainly been studied in cells of non-neuronal origin, we speculated that APP may use an alternative pathway in neuronal cells. To test whether APP endocytosis is clathrin dependent in N2a cells, we performed internalization assays in cells, which were either depleted of AP-2 by siRNA or expressed dominant-negative mutants of AP180 or dynamin to interfere with the clathrin-dependent endocytosis machinery (Fig. 3). RNA interference with AP-2 resulted in an ∼60% downregulation of the protein (supplemental Fig. 1D, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), which reduced the endocytosis of both APP and rhodamine–transferrin (Fig. 3). A similar inhibition of APP endocytosis and rhodamine–transferrin uptake was achieved by expression of dominant-negative mutants of AP180 and dynamin, indicating that APP requires clathrin function for its endocytosis in N2a cells (AP-2 RNAi: 99% reduction of APP endocytosis, 71% reduction of transferrin endocytosis; AP180 C terminus: 69% reduction of APP endocytosis, 79% reduction of transferrin uptake; dynaminK44a: 75% reduction of APP endocytosis, 62% reduction of transferrin uptake) (Fig. 3). However, when we expressed a dominant-negative form of the clathrin accessory protein epsin1, which is unable to bind to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (Ford et al., 2002), we observed an interesting difference between APP and transferrin endocytosis. Although mutant epsin1 efficiently inhibited rhodamine–transferrin uptake as reported previously (Ford et al., 2002; Deinhardt et al., 2006), it did not show any effect on the endocytosis of APP (dominant-negative epsin1: 9% increase in APP endocytosis, 55% reduction of transferrin uptake) (Fig. 3). These results suggest that APP may be internalized by a specialized clathrin-dependent mechanism using a specific subset of accessory proteins. Our findings closely resemble an endocytosis pathway that has been described for the internalization of tetanus toxin into motor neurons (Deinhardt et al., 2006). The neurospecific tetanus toxin binds to polysialogangliosides within cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains before internalization by a clathrin-dependent pathway that requires AP-2 but is independent of epsin1 (Herreros et al., 2001; Deinhardt et al., 2006). APP can bind to gangliosides via its Aβ region (Yanagisawa et al., 1995). This and the fact that cholesterol depletion interferes with β-secretase processing of APP (Simons et al., 1998) led us to speculate whether cholesterol might play a role also in the endocytosis of APP. The conditions for cholesterol depletion were established so that endocytosis of transferrin was not affected. When N2a cells were pretreated for 2 h with 1 mm mβCD to extract plasma membrane cholesterol, we did not observe a reduction of rhodamine–transferrin or DiI–LDL uptake (supplemental Fig. 2A,B, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). However, the internalization of APP was significantly impaired (57% reduction, n = 1030 cells, p < 0.0005, t test), which was accompanied by reduced β-cleavage of APP (52% reduction, n = 228 cells, p < 0.0005, t test). Similar results were obtained in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons (90% reduction of APP endocytosis, 35% reduction of intracellular sAPPβ).\n\nWhen we compared the APP endocytosis rates of cholesterol-depleted or untreated cells using a biotinylation assay, we found a 62% reduction in APP endocytosis, confirming the results of the immunofluorescence-based assay (supplemental Fig. 3A, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). RNAi-mediated flotillin-2 knockdown led to a 87% reduction of APP in the biotin endocytosis assay compared with control siRNA-treated cells (supplemental Fig. 3B, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).\n\nTogether, these results suggest that APP internalization occurs via a specialized clathrin-dependent pathway that is modulated by cholesterol and flotillin-2.\n\nFlotillin modulates clustering of APP\n\nConsistent with previous studies (Stuermer et al., 2001; Neumann-Giesen et al., 2007), we found flotillin in the endosomal system and at the plasma membrane of N2a cells and hippocampal neurons (data not shown), in which it colocalized partially with clusters of surface labeled APP (Fig. 4A). This observation together with the putative function of flotillin as a domain-organizing scaffold that entraps specific lipids and proteins in membrane microdomains prompted us to investigate whether flotillin could organize APP in larger clusters and whether such clustering could play a role in APP endocytosis.\n\nTo visualize the clustering behavior of APP, we used STED microscopy (Donnert et al., 2006) that provides a nanoscale resolution (∼40 nm laterally, corresponding to the applied STED power in this study) (Fitzner et al., 2006; Willig et al., 2006). Using STED microscopy, we compared the size of APP clusters in the plasma membrane of control cells and cells that were depleted of flotillin-2 by RNAi (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, we found that the flotillin-2 knockdown resulted in a significant reduction of mean APP cluster sizes (77% reduction, 900 clusters counted, p < 0.0001, t test). The size distribution of APP clusters was shifted toward lower cluster sizes in flotillin-2-depleted cells (Fig. 4C), suggesting that flotillin-2 may be involved in the clustering of APP at the plasma membrane. In contrast, knockdown of flotillin-1 did not affect cluster size and size distribution of surface APP (data not shown).\n\nThe effect of flotillin-2 knockdown on APP clustering was also investigated by the technique of FRET, which is particularly suitable for observing phenomena occurring at a scale of <10 nm (Bunt and Wouters, 2004). Donor and acceptor dyes were exclusively coupled to surface swAPP molecules by incubation of swAPP-transfected N2a cells with antibody-coupled dyes at 4°C. Despite the low signal attributable to the low concentration of surface APP, it was possible to measure resonance energy transfer between donor and acceptor dye molecules.\n\nIn flotillin-2-depleted cells, the absolute intensity of the bound dyes was higher, apparently attributable to lower endocytosis rates; mean FRET efficiency was 3.2%. In control cells only, an additional subpopulation of swAPP underwent energy transfer with a higher FRET efficiency centered around 12%. This redistribution to a new subpopulation, with a loss at lower and gain at higher FRET efficiencies, induced by flotillin-2 is visible in the difference of the distributions (Fig. 4D) and introduces a significant difference (p < 0.01) between the mean FRET efficiencies of control and flotillin-2-depleted cells. APP is therefore more likely to homotypically interact in the presence of flotillin-2. This result is compatible with the reduction of APP cluster size during flotillin-2 knockdown as seen by STED microscopy. The low mean values of the average FRET efficiencies probably reflect the large distance between the dye molecules coupled to secondary f(ab) fragments on separate primary antibody molecules bound to separate swAPP molecules.\n\nA previous study has provided evidence that flotillin interacts with APP via residues 189–282 of its proposed oligomerization domain (Chen et al., 2006), suggesting that direct protein–protein interaction between APP and flotillin oligomers might be the driving force in the formation of APP clusters. Indeed, by coimmunoprecipitation, we found an interaction of APP and flotillin-2 not only in N2a cell culture but also in brain lysates from heterozygous swAPP/PS1dE9 transgenic mice (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Because flotillin partitions into lipid rafts, we speculated that the interaction between APP and flotillin would be sensitive to cholesterol depletion. Indeed, the amount of flotillin-2 that was coimmunoprecipitated with APP was significantly reduced by cholesterol depletion (51% reduction) (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), raising the possibility that, in addition to the direct protein interaction, protein–lipid interactions may contribute to the complex formation.\n\nWe hypothesized that the flotillin-driven clustering of APP might be a mechanism to influence its endocytosis. If this were to be the case, then artificial clustering of APP by antibody cross-linking should overcome the inhibitory effect of flotillin-2 knockdown on the endocytosis of APP. To test this possibility, we transfected swAPP–YFP into N2a cells and labeled APP at the cell surface with primary antibody at 4°C, followed by the subsequent incubation with monovalent f(ab) fragment or with bivalent IgG secondary antibody to induce clustering of APP. Cells were then shifted to 37°C to allow endocytosis to occur. Cross-linking with bivalent secondary antibody dramatically stimulated the endocytosis of APP (64% increase, n = 170 cells, p < 0.0005, t test) but not of two other transmembrane proteins [VSVG and PLP (supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material)]. In line with the stimulation of endocytosis, we observed an increase in intracellular β-cleaved APP ectodomain during antibody induced clustering (52% increase, n = 406 cells, p < 0.005, t test) as reported previously (Ehehalt et al., 2003). Having shown that antibody-induced clustering promotes endocytosis of APP, we tested the possible role of flotillin in this process. APP was labeled at the cell surface with primary antibody and cross-linked with bivalent IgG secondary antibody or not in both control and flotillin-2-depleted cells. The rate of endocytosis was determined over a time course of 15 and 30 min. Consistent with our results above, we found that depletion of flotillin-2 reduced the internalization of APP in the absence of IgG secondary antibody (Fig. 5A). However, when endocytosis was promoted by incubating cells with bivalent secondary antibody, we observed that the inhibition by flotillin-2 knockdown was completely overcome (Fig. 5A). Antibody-induced clustering of APP might, thus, mimic the function of flotillin in modulating APP endocytosis.\n\nSimilar results were obtained in cells depleted of cholesterol, in which the inhibitory effect of cholesterol depletion could be reversed by secondary IgG antibody-mediated clustering of APP (Fig. 5B)."
