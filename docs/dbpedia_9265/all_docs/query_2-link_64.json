        "text": "Swab or biopsy samples for bioburden testing of allograft musculoskeletal tissue?\n\nPubMed\n\nVarettas, Kerry\n\n2014-12-01\n\nSwab and biopsy samples of allograft musculoskeletal tissue are most commonly collected by tissue banks for bacterial and fungal bioburden testing. An in vitro study was performed using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards standard 'Quality control of microbiological transport systems' (2003) to validate and evaluate the recovery of six challenge organisms from swab and biopsy samples of allograft musculoskeletal tissue. On average, 8.4 to >100 and 7.2 to >100Â % of the inoculum was recovered from swab and biopsy samples respectively. A retrospective review of donor episodes was also performed, consisting of paired swab and biopsy samples received in this laboratory during the period 2001-2012. Samples of allograft femoral heads were collected from living donors during hip operations. From the 3,859 donor episodes received, 21 paired swab and biopsy samples each recovered an isolate, 247 swab samples only and 79 biopsy samples only were culture positive. Low numbers of challenge organisms were recovered from inoculated swab and biopsy samples in the in vitro study and validated their use for bioburden testing of allograft musculoskeletal tissue. Skin commensals were the most common group of organisms isolated during a 12-year retrospective review of paired swab and biopsy samples from living donor allograft femoral heads. Paired swab and biopsy samples are a suitable representative sample of allograft musculoskeletal tissue for bioburden testing.\n\nMantle biopsy: a technique for nondestructive tissue-sampling of freshwater mussels\n\nTreesearch\n\nDavid J. Berg; Wendell R. Haag; Sheldon I. Guttman; James B. Sickel\n\n1995-01-01\n\nMantle biopsy is a means of obtaining tissue samples for genetic, physiological, and contaminant studies of bivalves; but the effects of this biopsy on survival have not been determined. We describe a simple technique for obtaining such samples from unionacean bivalves and how we compared survival among biopsied and control organisms in field experiments. Survival was...\n\nComparison of different biopsy forceps models for tissue sampling in eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBussmann, Christian; Schoepfer, Alain M; Safroneeva, Ekaterina; Haas, Nadine; Godat, SÃ©bastien; Sempoux, Christine; Simon, Hans-Uwe; Straumann, Alex\n\n2016-12-01\n\nBackground and aims: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a mixed inflammatory and fibrostenotic disease. Unlike superficial inflammatory changes, subepithelial fibrosis is not routinely sampled in esophageal biopsies. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of deep esophageal sampling with four different types of biopsy forceps. Patients and methods: In this cross-sectional study, esophageal biopsies were taken in 30 adult patients by one expert endoscopist. Biopsies sampled from distal esophagus using a static jaw forceps (Olympus, FB-11K-1) were compared with proximal biopsies sampled with static jaw (Olympus, FB-45Q-1), alligator jaw (Olympus, FB-210K), and large-capacity forceps (Boston Scientific, Radial Jaw 4). One pathologist calculated the surface area of epithelial and subepithelial layers in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsies. Results: Subepithelial tissue was acquired in 97â% (static jaw FB-11K-1), 93â% (static jaw FB-45Q-1), 80â% (alligator jaw), and 55â% (large-capacity) of samples. Median (interquartile [IQR]) ratios of surface area of epithelial to subepithelial tissue were: static jaw FB-45Q-1, 1.07 (0.65â-â4.465); static jaw FB-11K-1, 1.184 (0.608â-â2.545); alligator jaw, 2.353 (1.312â-â4.465); and large-capacity, 2.71 (1.611â-â4.858). The static jaw models obtained a larger surface area of subepithelial tissue compared with the alligator jaw ( P â<â0.001 and P â=â0.037, for FB-11K-1 and FB-45Q-1, respectively) and the large-capacity forceps ( P â<â0.001, for both static jaw models). No esophageal perforations occurred. Conclusions: The static jaw forceps models allowed sampling of subepithelial tissue in >â90â% of biopsies and appear to be superior to alligator or large-capacity forceps in sampling larger amounts of subepithelial tissue.

However, before its widespread application, information on the variability of biochemical components within and among tissues needs to be evaluated. We measured glycogen concentrations in foot and mantle tissue in Amblema plicata plicata (Say, 1817) to determine if glycogen was evenly distributed within and between tissues and to determine which tissue might be more responsive to the stress associated with relocating mussels. Glycogen was measured in two groups of mussels: those sampled from their native environment (undisturbed mussels) and quickly frozen for analysis and those relocated into an artificial pond (relocated mussels) for 24 months before analysis. In both undisturbed and relocated mussels, glycogen concentrations were evenly distributed within foot, but not within mantle tissue. In mantle tissue, concentrations of glycogen varied about 2-fold among sections. In addition, glycogen varied significantly between tissues in undisturbed mussels, but not in relocated mussels. Twenty-four months after relocation, glycogen concentrations had declined by 80% in mantle tissue and by 56% in foot tissue relative to the undisturbed mussels. These data indicate that representative biopsy samples can be obtained from foot tissue, but not mantle tissue. We hypothesize that mantle tissue could be more responsive to the stress of relocation due to its high metabolic activity associated with shell formation.\n\nHigh-resolution, 2- and 3-dimensional imaging of uncut, unembedded tissue biopsy samples.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorres, Richard; Vesuna, Sam; Levene, Michael J\n\n2014-03-01\n\nDespite continuing advances in tissue processing automation, traditional embedding, cutting, and staining methods limit our ability for rapid, comprehensive visual examination. These limitations are particularly relevant to biopsies for which immediate therapeutic decisions are most necessary, faster feedback to the patient is desired, and preservation of tissue for ancillary studies is most important. The recent development of improved tissue clearing techniques has made it possible to consider use of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) tools in clinical settings, which could address difficulties of established methods. To demonstrate the potential of MPM of cleared tissue for the evaluation of unembedded and uncut pathology samples. Human prostate, liver, breast, and kidney specimens were fixed and dehydrated by using traditional histologic techniques, with or without incorporation of nucleic acid fluorescent stains into dehydration steps. A benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate clearing protocol was substituted for xylene. Multiphoton microscopy was performed on a home-built system. Excellent morphologic detail was achievable with MPM at depths greater than 500 Î¼m. Pseudocoloring produced images analogous to hematoxylin-eosin-stained images. Concurrent second-harmonic generation detection allowed mapping of collagen. Subsequent traditional section staining with hematoxylin-eosin did not reveal any detrimental morphologic effects. Sample immunostains on renal tissue showed preservation of normal reactivity. Complete reconstructions of 1-mm cubic samples elucidated 3-dimensional architectural organization. Multiphoton microscopy on cleared, unembedded, uncut biopsy specimens shows potential as a practical clinical tool with significant advantages over traditional histology while maintaining compatibility with gold standard techniques. Further investigation to address remaining implementation barriers is warranted.\n\nA New Method for Endoscopic Sampling of Submucosal Tissue in the Gastrointestinal Tract: A Comparison of the Biopsy Forceps and a New Drill Instrument.\n\nPubMed\n\nWalther, Charles; Jeremiasen, Martin; Rissler, Pehr; Johansson, Jan L M; Larsson, Marie S; Walther, Bruno S C S\n\n2016-12-01\n\nBackground Sampling of submucosal lesions in the gastrointestinal tract through a flexible endoscope is a well-recognized clinical problem. One technique often used is endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, but it does not provide solid tissue biopsies with preserved architecture for histopathological evaluation. To obtain solid tissue biopsies from submucosal lesions, we have constructed a new endoscopic biopsy tool and compared it in a crossover study with the standard double cupped forceps. Methods Ten patients with endoscopically verified submucosal lesions were sampled. The endoscopist selected the position for the biopsies and used the instrument selected by randomization. After a biopsy was harvested, the endoscopist chose the next site for a biopsy and again used the instrument picked by randomization. A total of 6 biopsies, 3 with the forceps and 3 with the drill instrument, were collected in every patient. Results The drill instrument resulted in larger total size biopsies (mm 2 ; Mann-Whitney U test, P = .048) and larger submucosal part (%) of the biopsies (Mann-Whitney U test, P = .003) than the forceps. Two patients were observed because of chest pain and suspicion of bleeding in 24 hours. No therapeutic measures were necessary to be taken. Conclusion The new drill instrument for flexible endoscopy can safely deliver submucosal tissue samples from submucosal lesions in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

A 57-year-old Hispanic male patient initially diagnosed with an EGFR 19 deletion positive lung adenocarcinoma and clinically responded to initial erlotinib treatment. The patient subsequently progressed on erlotinib 150Â mg/day and repeat biopsies both tissue and liquid were sent for next-generation sequencing (NGS). A T790Â M EGFR mutation was detected in the blood sample using a liquid biopsy technique, but the tissue biopsy failed to show a T790Â M mutation in a newly biopsied tissue sample. He was then successfully treated with osimertinib 80Â mg/day, has clinically and radiologically responded, and remains on osimertinib treatment after 10Â months. Second-line osimertinib treatment, when administered at 80Â mg/day, is both well tolerated and efficacious in a patient with previously erlotinib treated lung adenocarcinoma and a T790Â M mutation detected by liquid biopsy.\n\nNose biopsy: a comparison between two sampling techniques.\n\nPubMed\n\nSegal, Nili; Osyntsov, Lidia; Olchowski, Judith; Kordeluk, Sofia; Plakht, Ygal\n\n2016-06-01\n\nPre operative biopsy is important in obtaining preliminary information that may help in tailoring the optimal treatment. The aim of this study was to compare two sampling techniques of obtaining nasal biopsy-nasal forceps and nasal scissors in terms of pathological results. Biopsies of nasal lesions were taken from patients undergoing nasal surgery by two techniques- with nasal forceps and with nasal scissors. Each sample was examined by a senior pathologist that was blinded to the sampling method. A grading system was used to rate the crush artifact in every sample (none, mild, moderate, severe). A comparison was made between the severity of the crush artifact and the pathological results of the two techniques. One hundred and forty-four samples were taken from 46 patients. Thirty-one were males and the mean age was 49.6Â years. Samples taken by forceps had significantly higher grades of crush artifacts compared to those taken by scissors. The degree of crush artifacts had a significant influence on the accuracy of the pre operative biopsy. Forceps cause significant amount of crush artifacts compared to scissors. The degree of crush artifact in the tissue sample influences the accuracy of the biopsy.\n\nOptimizing EUS-guided liver biopsy sampling: comprehensive assessment of needle types and tissue acquisition techniques.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchulman, Allison R; Thompson, Christopher C; Odze, Robert; Chan, Walter W; Ryou, Marvin\n\n2017-02-01\n\nEUS-guided liver biopsy sampling using FNA and, more recently, fine-needle biopsy (FNB) needles has been reported with discrepant diagnostic accuracy, in part due to differences in methodology. We aimed to compare liver histologic yields of 4 EUS-based needles and 2 percutaneous needles to identify optimal number of needle passes and suction. Six needle types were tested on human cadaveric tissue: one 19G FNA needle, one existing 19G FNB needle, one novel 19G FNB needle, one 22G FNB needle, and two 18G percutaneous needles (18G1 and 18G2). Two needle excursion patterns (1 vs 3 fanning passes) were performed on all EUS needles. Primary outcome was number of portal tracts. Secondary outcomes were degree of fragmentation and specimen adequacy. Pairwise comparisons were performed using t tests, with a 2-sided PÂ < .05 considered to be significant. Multivariable regression analysis was performed. In total, 288 liver biopsy samplings (48 per needle type) were performed. The novel 19G FNB needle had significantly increased mean portal tracts compared with all needle types. The 22G FNB needle had significantly increased portal tracts compared with the 18G1 needle (3.8 vs 2.5, PÂ < .001) and was not statistically different from the 18G2 needle (3.8 vs 3.5, PÂ = .68). FNB needles (PÂ < .001) and 3 fanning passes (PÂ â¤ .001) were independent predictors of the number of portal tracts. A novel 19G EUS-guided liver biopsy needle provides superior histologic yield compared with 18G percutaneous needles and existing 19G FNA and core needles. Moreover, the 22G FNB needle may be adequate for liver biopsy sampling. Investigations are underway to determine whether these results can be replicated in a clinical setting.

On non-ophthalmic tissues the preferred illumination wavelength is 1300 nm. Previous studies on skin have shown that useful image data can also be obtained at shorter wavelengths, with systems at 1060 nm and 820 nm offering reduced depth penetration but higher contrast. Here we apply a similar comparison to tissue engineered models of oral cancer and also to human biopsy samples, generally finding a similar trend. 1300 nm multi-beam OCT (Michelson Diagnostics EX1301) visualises stromal structures and surface keratin more clearly, providing useful image contrast down to around 1 mm. This system was compared with an ultra-high resolution home-built system operating at 890 nm (2.5 micron resolution vs 7.5 micron axial resolution for the EX1301). The UHR system reveals epithelial features more clearly, especially in the DOK pre-invasive cell line model and the biopsy samples. The relative effects of center wavelength vs axial resolution in generating the differential, wavelength-dependent contrast are assessed and the OCT biopsy images are compared with contemporary histology.\n\nHyperspectral imaging with wavelet transform for classification of colon tissue biopsy samples\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMasood, Khalid\n\n2008-08-01\n\nAutomatic classification of medical images is a part of our computerised medical imaging programme to support the pathologists in their diagnosis. Hyperspectral data has found its applications in medical imagery. Its usage is increasing significantly in biopsy analysis of medical images. In this paper, we present a histopathological analysis for the classification of colon biopsy samples into benign and malignant classes. The proposed study is based on comparison between 3D spectral/spatial analysis and 2D spatial analysis. Wavelet textural features in the wavelet domain are used in both these approaches for classification of colon biopsy samples. Experimental results indicate that the incorporation of wavelet textural features using a support vector machine, in 2D spatial analysis, achieve best classification accuracy.\n\nIdentification of proteomic biomarkers predicting prostate cancer aggressiveness and lethality despite biopsy-sampling error.\n\nPubMed\n\nShipitsin, M; Small, C; Choudhury, S; Giladi, E; Friedlander, S; Nardone, J; Hussain, S; Hurley, A D; Ernst, C; Huang, Y E; Chang, H; Nifong, T P; Rimm, D L; Dunyak, J; Loda, M; Berman, D M; Blume-Jensen, P\n\n2014-09-09\n\nKey challenges of biopsy-based determination of prostate cancer aggressiveness include tumour heterogeneity, biopsy-sampling error, and variations in biopsy interpretation. The resulting uncertainty in risk assessment leads to significant overtreatment, with associated costs and morbidity. We developed a performance-based strategy to identify protein biomarkers predictive of prostate cancer aggressiveness and lethality regardless of biopsy-sampling variation. Prostatectomy samples from a large patient cohort with long follow-up were blindly assessed by expert pathologists who identified the tissue regions with the highest and lowest Gleason grade from each patient. To simulate biopsy-sampling error, a core from a high- and a low-Gleason area from each patient sample was used to generate a 'high' and a 'low' tumour microarray, respectively. Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we identified from 160 candidates 12 biomarkers that predicted prostate cancer aggressiveness (surgical Gleason and TNM stage) and lethal outcome robustly in both high- and low-Gleason areas. Conversely, a previously reported lethal outcome-predictive marker signature for prostatectomy tissue was unable to perform under circumstances of maximal sampling error. Our results have important implications for cancer biomarker discovery in general and development of a sampling error-resistant clinical biopsy test for prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness.\n\nUse of a new jumbo forceps improves tissue acquisition of Barrett's esophagus surveillance biopsies.\n\nPubMed\n\nKomanduri, Sri; Swanson, Garth; Keefer, Laurie; Jakate, Shriram\n\n2009-12-01\n\nThe major risk factors for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma remain long-standing GERD and resultant Barrett's esophagus (BE). Finding the exact method of adequate tissue sampling for surveillance of dysplasia in BE remains a dilemma. We prospectively compared standard large-capacity biopsy forceps with a new jumbo biopsy forceps for dysplasia detection in BE. Prospective, single-center investigation. We prospectively enrolled 32 patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy for BE. Biopsy samples were obtained in paired fashion alternating between the experimental (jumbo) and control (large-capacity) forceps. Each sample was assessed for histopathology, specimen size, and adequacy. A total of 712 specimens were available for analysis for this investigation. Six patients were found to have dysplasia, and in 5 of those patients, the dysplasia was only detected with the jumbo forceps. The mean width was significantly greater in the Radial Jaw 4 jumbo group (3.3 mm vs 1.9 mm [P < .005]) as was the mean depth (2.0 mm vs 1.1 mm [P < .005]). Sixteen percent of samples obtained with the standard forceps provided an adequate sample, whereas the jumbo forceps provided an adequate sample 79% of the time (P < .05). A lack of a validated index for assessment of tissue adequacy in BE. The Radial Jaw 4 jumbo biopsy forceps significantly improves dysplasia detection and adequate tissue sampling in patients undergoing endoscopy for BE.\n\nTechnical note: The development of a methodology for ruminal and colon tissue biopsying of young Holstein dairy calves.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Niekerk, J K; Middeldorp, M; Steele, M A\n\n2018-05-09\n\nThe objectives of this study were to develop a methodology for biopsying the rumen and colon of young dairy calves and to collect suitable quality tissue samples for microscopic and gene expression analysis. Six Holstein dairy bull calves (45.0 Â± 1.5 kg birth weight) were ruminally cannulated during the second week of life and weaned at the end of wk 6. Ruminal and colon tissue samples were collected at the end of wk 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12. Calves were not sedated but were restrained in a chute for sampling. The endoscope (100 cm length, 9.8 mm diameter) was introduced through the rumen cannula to harvest ruminal tissue. Endoscopic biopsies of the rumen with endoscopic biopsy forceps were unsuccessful 85% of the time because they were unable to shear the ruminal tissue. Thereafter, an Allis clamp was used to retrieve the blind sac through the rumen cannula to perform direct tissue biopsying with surgical scissors. To biopsy the colon, the lubricated distal tip of an endoscope was slowly inserted into the calf's anus. A total of 6 colon tissue samples (12.6 Â± 0.74 mg) were collected per calf per time point from the distal colon 30 to 40 cm from the calf's anus using endoscopic biopsy forceps, which were inserted through the instrument channel. A new forcep was used between sites and calves. Between calves, the outside of the endoscope was washed with 4% chlorohexidine and rinsed with water and the instrument channel was washed with distilled water and 70% ethanol. Colon and ruminal samples were processed for histological measurements, and RNA was isolated and sequenced. High-quality RNA (RNA integrity number 8.8 Â± 0.08) was collected from samples, and light and electron microscopy was performed on samples. In conclusion, endoscopic biopsying can be used for tissue harvest in the colon of young calves. However, it was found that collecting ruminal tissue by retracting the rumen from the cannula and taking samples with surgical scissors was more successful than an\n\nForceps biopsy and suction catheter for sampling in pulmonary nodules and infiltrates.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeschke, Antje; Wiedemann, BÃ¤rbel; HÃ¶ffken, Gert; Koschel, Dirk\n\n2012-06-01\n\nTransbronchial lung biopsy with forceps is a standard procedure in bronchoscopic tissue sampling. Suction catheter aspiration is another technique, but it is not widely known and almost no data exist regarding its diagnostic efficiency. 272 patients were included in a prospective and randomised study between February 2007 and October 2009. All were referred for bronchoscopic evaluation of pulmonary nodules/masses or infiltrates. We compared the diagnostic yield of forceps biopsy and suction catheter aspiration for a definite diagnosis and looked at whether such a diagnosis depends on the underlying pulmonary change. All patients underwent bronchoscopy with forceps biopsy and catheter aspiration. A definitive diagnosis was reached in a total of 183 (67.3%) patients, with catheter aspiration in 140 (51.5%) patients and with forceps biopsy in 136 (50.0%) patients. In 90 (33.1%) patients, a definite diagnosis could only be reached with the combination of both techniques. The diagnostic yield of forceps biopsy was better than catheter aspiration in infiltrates (p = 0.027), but was no different in nodules or masses (p = 0.09). Suction catheter aspiration is a useful technique of bronchoscopic tissue sampling. The combination of catheter aspiration and forceps biopsy results in a higher diagnostic yield than either method used alone.\n\n[Measurement of the status of trace elements in cattle using liver biopsy samples].\n\nPubMed\n\nOuweltjes, W; de Zeeuw, A C; Moen, A; Counotte, G H M\n\n2007-02-01\n\nSerum, plasma, or urine samples are usually used for the measurement of the trace elements copper; zinc, iron, selenium, because these samples are easy to obtain; however; these samples are not always appropriate. For example, it is not possible to measure molybdenum, the major antagonist of copper; in blood or urine. Therefore measurement of trace elements in liver tissue is considered the gold standard. For the assessment of selenium the method of choice remains determination of glutathion peroxidase in erythrocytes and for the assessment of magnesium determination of magnesium in urine. We determined the accuracy and repeatability of measuring trace elements in liver biopsies and whole liver homogenates. The levels of trace elements measured were similar in both preparations (92% agreement). Liver biopsy in live animals is a relatively simple procedure but not common in The Netherlands. Reference levels of trace elements, classified as too low, low, adequate, high, and too high, were established on the basis of our research and information in the literature. In a second study we investigated the practical aspects of obtaining liver tissue samples and their use. Samples were collected from cattle on a commercial dairy farm. Liver biopsy provided additional information to that obtained from serum and urine samples. We prepared a biopsy protocol and a test package, which we tested on 14 farms where an imbalance of trace minerals was suspected. Biopsy samples taken from 4 to 6 animals revealed extreme levels of trace elements.\n\nIntegrated sensor biopsy device for real time tissue metabolism analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDelgado Alonso, Jesus; Lieberman, Robert A.; DiCarmine, Paul M.; Berry, David; Guzman, Narciso; Marpu, Sreekar B.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nCurrent methods for guiding cancer biopsies rely almost exclusively on images derived from X-ray, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance, which essentially characterize suspected lesions based only on tissue density. This paper presents a sensor integrated biopsy device for in situ tissue analysis that will enable biopsy teams to measure local tissue chemistry in real time during biopsy procedures, adding a valuable new set of parameters to augment and extend conventional image guidance. A first demonstrator integrating three chemical and biochemical sensors was tested in a mice strain that is a spontaneous breast cancer model. In all cases, the multisensory probe was able to discriminate between healthy tissue, the edge of the tumor, and total insertion inside the cancer tissue, recording real-time information about tissue metabolism.\n\nSmall incision iris tumour biopsy using a cavernous sampling forceps.\n\nPubMed\n\nChronopoulos, Argyrios; Kilic, Ergin; Joussen, Antonia M; Lipski, Andreas\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe aim of this retrospective report is to describe our experience with the Essen-23G biopsy forceps (AkgÃ¼l forceps) for biopsies of pigmented iris tumours. In this retrospective study of cases between October 2012 and September 2013, patients with iris tumours and clinical signs for malignancy underwent biopsy to secure the diagnosis. The Essen-23G-forceps was used to grasp and extract tissue through a clear corneal incision. Eventual entry and bimanual manipulation with a 23G mini-scissors was achieved through a second incision. Tissue samples were fixed in a sterile tube for further histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation. Seven eyes of seven patients underwent biopsy using the forceps. The average thickness of the iris tumours was 1.07Â±0.79â mm. A second corneal incision for scissoring in a bimanual technique was necessary in 5 cases (71%). In 6 cases (85%), a precise histological and immunohistochemical diagnosis was achieved. Complications were limited to minute bleeding at the biopsy site and one case of relative pupil enlargement (anisocoria) without further refractive issues. Iris tumour biopsies can be successfully approached using a cavernous 23G intraocular forceps with a low risk for procedure-related complications. The conical interior design allows for removal of whole tissue pieces with minimal manipulative artefacts. An optional bimanual access through a second corneal incision and use of a 23G scissors provides better efficacy. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Neil\n\n2001-07-01\n\nWe have applied Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging, coupling a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) focal plane array detector (FPA) and a Michelson step scan interferometer, to the investigation of various states of malignant human prostate tissue. The MCT FPA used consists of 64x64 pixels, each 61 micrometers 2, and has a spectral range of 2-10.5 microns. Each imaging data set was collected at 16-1 resolution, resulting in 512 image planes and a total of 4096 interferograms. In this article we describe a method for separating different tissue types contained within FTIR spectroscopic imaging data sets of human prostate tissue biopsies. We present images, generated by the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm, which demonstrate the successful partitioning of distinct tissue type domains. Additionally, analysis of differences in the centroid spectra corresponding to different tissue types provides an insight into their biochemical composition. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability to partition tissue type regions in a different data set using centroid spectra calculated from the original data set. This has implications for the use of the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm as an automated technique for the separation and examination of tissue domains in biopsy samples.\n\nGastric Cancer-Specific Protein Profile Identified Using Endoscopic Biopsy Samples via MALDI Mass Spectrometry\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Hark Kyun; Reyzer, Michelle L.; Choi, Il Ju; Kim, Chan Gyoo; Kim, Hee Sung; Oshima, Akira; Chertov, Oleg; Colantonio, Simona; Fisher, Robert J.; Allen, Jamie L.; Caprioli, Richard M.; Green, Jeffrey E.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo date, proteomic analyses on gastrointestinal cancer tissue samples have been performed using surgical specimens only, which are obtained after a diagnosis is made. To determine if a proteomic signature obtained from endoscopic biopsy samples could be found to assist with diagnosis, frozen endoscopic biopsy samples collected from 63 gastric cancer patients and 43 healthy volunteers were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. A statistical classification model was developed to distinguish tumor from normal tissues using half the samples and validated with the other half. A protein profile was discovered consisting of 73 signals that could classify 32 cancer and 22 normal samples in the validation set with high predictive values (positive and negative predictive values for cancer, 96.8% and 91.3%; sensitivity, 93.8%; specificity, 95.5%). Signals overexpressed in tumors were identified as Î±-defensin-1, Î±-defensin-2, calgranulin A, and calgranulin B. A protein profile was also found to distinguish pathologic stage Ia (pT1N0M0) samples (n = 10) from more advanced stage (Ib or higher) tumors (n = 48). Thus, protein profiles obtained from endoscopic biopsy samples may be useful in assisting with the diagnosis of gastric cancer and, possibly, in identifying early stage disease.

The organism elicits no, or minimal, inflammatory changes in duodenal biopsy samples, so it can be easily overlooked. We performed this study to determine whether Giardia could be isolated from the formalin fixative of biopsy samples, and to evaluate the value of fluid analysis in the assessment for potential infection. We prospectively evaluated duodenal biopsy samples from 92 patients with a clinical suspicion of giardiasis or symptoms compatible with that diagnosis (ie, diarrhea, bloating, or abdominal pain) Biopsy samples were routinely processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histologic diagnoses included giardiasis (5 cases, 4%), normal findings (64 cases, 70%), peptic injury/active duodenitis (12 cases, 13%), and intraepithelial lymphocytosis with villous blunting (10 cases, 12%). Fifteen cases (13%) showed detached degenerated epithelial cells or mucus droplets in the intervillous space that resembled Giardia. Cytology slides were prepared from formalin in the biopsy container using the standard Cytospin protocol and reviewed by a cytopathologist blinded to the biopsy findings. Cytologic evaluation revealed Giardia spp. in all 5 biopsy-proven cases, and identified an additional case that was not detected by biopsy analysis. Organisms were significantly more numerous (mean: 400 trophozoites; range, 120 to 810) and showed better morphologic features in cytology preparations compared with tissue sections (mean: 129 trophozoites; range, 37 to 253 organisms; P=0.05). Our findings suggest that cytology preparations from formalin fixative can resolve diagnostically challenging cases and even enhance Giardia detection in some cases.\n\nEpidermal growth factor receptor T790M testing in progressed lung cancer: A review of sensitive methods for analysis of tissue and liquid biopsy samples.\n\nPubMed\n\nChougule, A; Basak, S\n\n2017-12-01\n\nLung cancer is one of the major causes of mortality worldwide and is on the rise in India. The identification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has paved the way for personalized therapy in lung cancer with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Despite the proven efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in patients harboring EGFR mutations, their clinical utility is limited by the development of acquired resistance mechanisms by the tumor cells. T790M mutation accounts for 60% of all resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs and is responsible for treatment failure with first- and second-generation TKIs. With the development of novel therapeutic agents such as osimertinib to overcome this resistance mechanism, it is essential to detect patients harboring T790M mutation. There are several limitations with the use of tissue biopsy specimens for molecular testing such as poor quality and quantity of sample, tumor heterogeneity, occurrence of complications, and issues with repeat biopsy. Liquid biopsy offers a noninvasive approach that can be used for diagnostic purposes as well as for monitoring treatment response and evaluation of resistance mechanisms. This review focuses on the methods for molecular testing of tissue and liquid biopsy specimens for EGFR mutations, particularly EGFR T790M mutation.\n\n5-ALA-induced fluorescence as a marker for diagnostic tissue in stereotactic biopsies of intracranial lymphomas: experience in 41 patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nKiesel, Barbara; Millesi, Matthias; Woehrer, Adelheid; Furtner, Julia; Bavand, Anahita; Roetzer, Thomas; Mischkulnig, Mario; Wolfsberger, Stefan; Preusser, Matthias; Knosp, Engelbert; Widhalm, Georg\n\n2018-06-01\n\nOBJECTIVE Stereotactic needle biopsies are usually performed for histopathological confirmation of intracranial lymphomas to guide adequate treatment. During biopsy, intraoperative histopathology is an effective tool to avoid acquisition of nondiagnostic samples. In the last years, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced fluorescence has been increasingly used for visualization of diagnostic brain tumor tissue during stereotactic biopsies. Recently, visible fluorescence was reported in the first cases of intracranial lymphomas as well. The aim of this study is thus to investigate the technical and clinical utility of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence in a large series of stereotactic biopsies for intracranial lymphoma. METHODS This prospective study recruited adult patients who underwent frameless stereotactic needle biopsy for a radiologically suspected intracranial lymphoma after oral 5-ALA administration. During biopsy, samples from the tumor region were collected for histopathological analysis, and presence of fluorescence (strong, vague, or no fluorescence) was assessed with a modified neurosurgical microscope. In tumors with available biopsy samples from at least 2 different regions the intratumoral fluorescence homogeneity was additionally investigated. Furthermore, the influence of potential preoperative corticosteroid treatment or immunosuppression on fluorescence was analyzed. Histopathological tumor diagnosis was established and all collected biopsy samples were screened for diagnostic lymphoma tissue. RESULTS The final study cohort included 41 patients with intracranial lymphoma. Stereotactic biopsies with assistance of 5-ALA were technically feasible in all cases. Strong fluorescence was found as maximum level in 30 patients (75%), vague fluorescence in 2 patients (4%), and no visible fluorescence in 9 patients (21%). In 28 cases, samples were obtained from at least 2 different tumor regions; homogenous intratumoral fluorescence was found in 16 of those cases\n\nNeedle endomicroscope with a plastic, achromatic objective to perform optical biopsies of breast tissue\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKyrish, Matthew; Dobbs, Jessica; Richards-Kortum, Rebecca; Tkaczyk, Tomasz\n\n2013-03-01\n\nIn order to diagnose cancer in breast tissue, a sample must be removed, prepared, and examined under a microscope. To provide an alternative to conventional biopsies, an endomicroscope intended to perform optical biopsies is demonstrated. The system provides high resolution, high contrast images in real-time which could allow a diagnosis to be made during surgery without the need for tissue removal. Optical sectioning is achieved via structured illumination to reject out of focus light. An image is relayed between the sample plane and the imaging system by a coherent fiber bundle with an achromatized objective lens at the distal tip of the fiber bundle which is the diameter of a biopsy needle. The custom, plastic objective provides correction for both the excitation and emission wavelengths of proflavine (452 nm and 515 nm, respectively). It also magnifies the object onto the distal tip of the fiber bundle to increase lateral resolution. The lenses are composed of the optical plastics Zeonex E48R, PMMA, and polystyrene. The lenses are fabricated via single point diamond turning and assembled using a zero alignment technique. The lateral resolution and chromatic focal shift were measured and in vitro images of breast carcinoma cells stained with proflavine were captured. The optical biopsy system is able to achieve optical sectioning and to resolve smaller features than the current high resolution microendoscope.\n\nSatellite tagging and biopsy sampling of killer whales at subantarctic Marion Island: effectiveness, immediate reactions and long-term responses.\n\nPubMed\n\nReisinger, Ryan R; Oosthuizen, W Chris; PÃ©ron, Guillaume; Cory Toussaint, Dawn; Andrews, Russel D; de Bruyn, P J Nico\n\n2014-01-01\n\nRemote tissue biopsy sampling and satellite tagging are becoming widely used in large marine vertebrate studies because they allow the collection of a diverse suite of otherwise difficult-to-obtain data which are critical in understanding the ecology of these species and to their conservation and management. Researchers must carefully consider their methods not only from an animal welfare perspective, but also to ensure the scientific rigour and validity of their results. We report methods for shore-based, remote biopsy sampling and satellite tagging of killer whales Orcinus orca at Subantarctic Marion Island. The performance of these methods is critically assessed using 1) the attachment duration of low-impact minimally percutaneous satellite tags; 2) the immediate behavioural reactions of animals to biopsy sampling and satellite tagging; 3) the effect of researcher experience on biopsy sampling and satellite tagging; and 4) the mid- (1 month) and long- (24 month) term behavioural consequences. To study mid- and long-term behavioural changes we used multievent capture-recapture models that accommodate imperfect detection and individual heterogeneity. We made 72 biopsy sampling attempts (resulting in 32 tissue samples) and 37 satellite tagging attempts (deploying 19 tags). Biopsy sampling success rates were low (43%), but tagging rates were high with improved tag designs (86%). The improved tags remained attached for 26Â±14 days (mean Â± SD). Individuals most often showed no reaction when attempts missed (66%) and a slight reaction-defined as a slight flinch, slight shake, short acceleration, or immediate dive-when hit (54%). Severe immediate reactions were never observed. Hit or miss and age-sex class were important predictors of the reaction, but the method (tag or biopsy) was unimportant. Multievent trap-dependence modelling revealed considerable variation in individual sighting patterns; however, there were no significant mid- or long-term changes following\n\nSatellite Tagging and Biopsy Sampling of Killer Whales at Subantarctic Marion Island: Effectiveness, Immediate Reactions and Long-Term Responses\n\nPubMed Central\n\nReisinger, Ryan R.; Oosthuizen, W.

We worked with two manufacturers to develop a combination biopsy and marking dart for use on polar bears. We had an 80% success rate of collecting a tissue sample with a single biopsy dart and collected tissue samples from 143 polar bears on land, in water, and on sea ice. Dye marks ensured that 96% of the bears were not resampled during the same sampling period, and we recovered 96% of the darts fired. Biopsy heads with 5 mm diameters collected an average of 0.12 g of fur, tissue, and subcutaneous adipose tissue, while biopsy heads with 7 mm diameters collected an average of 0.32 g. Tissue samples were 99.3% successful (142 of 143 samples) in providing a genetic and sex identification of individuals. We had a 64% success rate collecting adipose tissue and we successfully examined fatty acid signatures in all adipose samples. Adipose lipid content values were lower compared to values from immobilized or harvested polar bears, indicating that our method was not suitable for quantifying adipose lipid content.\n\nPrimary esophageal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma diagnosed by using stacked forceps biopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, D S; Ahn, Y C; Eom, D W; Lee, S J\n\n2016-10-01\n\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma involving the esophagus is very rare. Only a few cases have been reported in the English literature to date, and it accounts for less than 1% of all cases of gastrointestinal lymphoma. As this malignancy manifests as a submucosal tumor, pathological diagnosis by using a simple endoscopic biopsy alone is difficult. Therefore, surgical biopsy, endoscopic mucosal resection, and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration have been used in most cases. Herein, we report a case of esophageal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma in a 49-year-old man, which involved the use of a stacked forceps biopsy to obtain adequate samples for pathological analysis; the use of the stacked forceps biopsy method is unlike those used in previous cases. The patient received cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone chemotherapy; he achieved a complete response. In addition, we review the literature relevant to this case.

Previous HR-MAS MR results have been obtained from post-surgery samples, which limits their direct clinical applicability. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we performed HR-MAS MR spectroscopic studies on 31 breast tissue samples (13 cancer and 18 non-cancer) obtained by percutaneous core needle biopsy. We showed that cancer and non-cancer samples can be discriminated very well with Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structure-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) multivariate model on the MR spectra. A subsequent blind test showed 69% sensitivity and 94% specificity in the prediction of the cancer status. A spectral analysis showed that in cancer cells, taurine- and choline-containing compounds are elevated. Our approach, additionally, could predict the progesterone receptor statuses of the cancer patients. Conclusions/Significance HR-MAS MR metabolomics on intact breast tissues obtained by core needle biopsy may have a potential to be used as a complement to the current diagnostic and prognostic measures for breast cancers.

To develop interdisciplinary recommendations on performing, the laboratory work up and reporting of the results of skin biopsies in patients with suspected cutaneous GvHD. A working group consisting of dermatopathologists, dermatologists, transplant-physicians and transplant-pathologists prepared recommendations for performing skin biopsies, laboratory workup and evaluation of tissue samples, and reporting of the results in patients with cutaneous GvHD. After achieving a consensus within the working group, a survey that comprised the core issues of the recommendations was electronically sent out to 72 alloHSCT centres within Germany, Austria, and Switzerland and their Departments of Pathology. The answers were discussed in a Consensus Conference and final recommendations were established. Twenty-five centres responded to the clinical and 17 centres to the histopathological survey. Questions addressed to the clinicians comprised the indication for skin biopsy in chronic GvHD (cGvHD) and acute GvHD (aGvHD) and the appropriate point of time for skin biopsy. Eighty-eight per cent agreed that the skin biopsy is generally indicated in patients with suspected cGvHD lacking diagnostic features. In contrast, with suspected aGvHD, only 62% of respondents felt that skin biopsy was necessary even if GvHD had not been confirmed in another organ. Although restricted due to the fact that immunosuppression is often applied in an emergency setting most centres supported skin biopsies before initiation of topical or systemic immunosuppression. The majority of pathologists agreed that in non-sclerotic GvHD a punch biopsy is adequate, whereas in sclerotic GvHD a scalpel biopsy is preferred. While a consensus on the need for biopsies in cGvHD was reached the value of skin biopsies in aGvHD and\n\nClinical application of Lin's biopsy grasper for intrauterine targeted biopsy and polypectomy during office hysteroscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nCheng, Hsin-Yi; Lin, Bao-Liang; Tseng, Jen-Yu; Ueno, Kazunori; Nakada, Sakura\n\n2018-06-01\n\nHysteroscopy has widely been used for diagnosis of the uterine cavity; however, target biopsy has often been difficult in part to the inherent limitations of ancillary instruments. Lin's biopsy grasper was specifically designed to work in conjunction with a flexible hysteroscope to obtain intrauterine biopsy under transabdominal sonography. Herein, we share our clinical experience in the management of endometrial abnormalities with the use of Lin's biopsy grasper during office-based hysteroscopy. From February 2006 to November 2016, the use of Lin's biopsy grasper for tissue biopsy was attempted on 126 cases. We retrospectively recorded and analyzed the patients' preoperative characteristics and biopsy outcomes to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of Lin's biopsy grasper. Out of the one hundred and twenty-six enrolled patients, satisfactory targeted biopsies were achieved; including high diagnostic rate (92.1%, with 116 cases confirmed histologically) and adequate tissue retrieval (77.8%, with 98 cases obtaining optimal specimen volume). All patients tolerated the procedure without analgesics or anesthesia. Diagnostic flexible hysteroscopy combined with the use of Lin's biopsy grasper has proven to be an effective tool for intrauterine evaluation and obtaining tissue sample. Copyright Â© 2018.

However, RNA extraction from gastric biopsy samples is a complex procedure because the samples contain low quantities of RNA and are contaminated with mucous protein and bacterial flora. The objectives of these studies were to compare the performance of RNA extraction methods and to investigate the sensitivity of commercial qPCR master mixes for gene expression analysis of gastric biopsy samples. Three commercial RNA extraction methods (TRIzol â¢ , GENEzol â¢ and MiniPrep â¢ ) and four qPCR master mixes with SYBR Â® green (qPCRBIO, KAPA, QuantiNova, and PerfeCTa) were compared. RNA qualification and quantitation were compared. Real-time PCR was used to compare qPCR master mixes. The results revealed that TRIzol and GENEzol obtained significantly higher yield of RNA (P<0.01) but that TRIzol had the highest contamination of protein and DNA (P<0.05). Conversely, MiniPrep resulting in a significantly higher purification of RNA (P<0.05) but provided the lowest yield of RNA (P<0.01). For PCR master mixes, KAPA was significantly (P<0.05) more sensitive than other qPCR kits for all amounts of DNA template, particularly at the lowest amount of cDNA. In conclusion, GENEzol is the best method to obtain a high RNA yield and purification and it is more cost-effective than the others as well. Regarding the qPCR master mixes, KAPA SYBR qPCR Master Mix (2x) Universal is superior to the other tested master mixes for studying gene expression in equine gastric biopsies.\n\nCeliac Disease Diagnosis: Endoscopic Biopsy\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... tissue samples are also vital to an accurate diagnosisâceliac disease can cause patchy lesions in the duodenum which ... to perform an intestinal biopsy to establish the diagnosis of celiac disease in a patient with DH; the skin biopsy ...\n\nPre-operative intra-articular deep tissue sampling with novel retrograde forceps improves the diagnostics in periprosthetic joint infection.\n\nPubMed\n\nWimmer, Matthias D; Ploeger, Milena M; Friedrich, Max J; HÃ¼gle, Thomas; Gravius, Sascha; Randau, Thomas M\n\n2017-07-01\n\nHistopathological tissue analysis is a key parameter within the diagnostic algorithm for suspected periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs), conventionally acquired in open surgery. In 2014, HÃ¼gle and co-workers introduced novel retrograde forceps for retrograde synovial biopsy with simultaneous fluid aspiration of the knee joint. We hypothesised that tissue samples acquired by retrograde synovial biopsy are equal to intra-operatively acquired deep representative tissue samples regarding bacterial detection and differentiation of periprosthetic infectious membranes. Thirty patients (male nÂ =Â 15, 50%; female nÂ =Â 15, 50%) with 30 suspected PJIs in painful total hip arthroplasties (THAs) were included in this prospective, controlled, non-blinded trial. The results were compared with intra-operatively obtained representative deep tissue samples. In summary, 27 out of 30 patients were diagnosed correctly as infected (17/17) or non-infected (10/13). The sensitivity to predict a PJI using the RetroforceÂ® sampling forceps in addition to standard diagnostics was 85%, the specificity 100%. Retrograde synovial biopsy is a new and rapid diagnostic procedure under local anaesthesia in patients with painful THAs with similar histological results compared to deep tissue sampling.\n\nOral biopsy: oral pathologist's perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nKumaraswamy, K L; Vidhya, M; Rao, Prasanna Kumar; Mukunda, Archana\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMany oral lesions may need to be diagnosed by removing a sample of tissue from the oral cavity. Biopsy is widely used in the medical field, but the practice is not quite widespread in dental practice. As oral pathologists, we have found many artifacts in the tissue specimen because of poor biopsy technique or handling, which has led to diagnostic pitfalls and misery to both the patient and the clinician. This article aims at alerting the clinicians about the clinical faults arising preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively while dealing with oral biopsy that may affect the histological assessment of the tissue and, therefore, the diagnosis. It also reviews the different techniques, precautions and special considerations necessary for specific lesions.\n\nInvestigation of tissue cellularity at the tip of the core biopsy needle with optical coherence tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nIftimia, Nicusor; Park, Jesung; Maguluri, Gopi; Krishnamurthy, Savitri; McWatters, Amanda; Sabir, Sharjeel H\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe report the development and the pre-clinical testing of a new technology based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) for investigating tissue composition at the tip of the core biopsy needle. While ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are routinely used to guide needle placement within a tumor, they still do not provide the resolution needed to investigate tissue cellularity (ratio between viable tumor and benign stroma) at the needle tip prior to taking a biopsy core. High resolution OCT imaging, however, can be used to investigate tissue morphology at the micron scale, and thus to determine if the biopsy core would likely have the expected composition. Therefore, we implemented this capability within a custom-made biopsy gun and evaluated its capability for a correct estimation of tumor tissue cellularity. A pilot study on a rabbit model of soft tissue cancer has shown the capability of this technique to provide correct evaluation of tumor tissue cellularity in over 85% of the cases. These initial results indicate the potential benefit of the OCT-based approach for improving the success of the core biopsy procedures.\n\nExpression of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in tissue samples of human prostate obtained by needle biopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiliÄeviÄ, Nevenka; MrÄela, Milanka; GaliÄ, Josip; MarjanoviÄ, Ksenija\n\n2015-11-01\n\nInterleukin-6 (IL-6) has been associated with the development of prostate cancer. The aim of the study was to clarify whether IL-6 expression in prostate tissue could be a useful marker in differentiation of prostate diseases in small foci by pathologist visual scoring. Archival paraffin-embedded specimens of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), prostatitis and prostate adenocarcinoma were studied by immunohistochemistry with a mouse monoclonal antibody IL-6 using the streptavidin-biotin method. Significantly, lower IL-6 immunoreactivity was observed in normal epithelial cells (p=0.000) and basal cells (p=0.000) in the samples of prostate adenocarcinoma in comparison to the samples with BPH, PIN and prostatitis. There was no significant difference in IL-6 expression in malignant and premalignant cells (p=0.814) as well as in stromal cells among the four diagnoses (p=0.22). IL-6 was expressed in normal epithelial cells, premalignant epithelial cells and malignant epithelial cells as well as in stromal cells. However, in our research IL-6 was of limited utility as a single marker for differential diagnosis of the prostate diseases in small foci needle biopsy by pathologist visual scoring. The standardization of immunohistochemical (IHC) staining protocol for IL-6 is required to determine IL-6 expression in order to avoid possible misinterpretation of the IHC results.

However, this procedure is sometimes difficult and can be dangerous for elderly patients whose abdominal fat layer is thin because of malnutrition. In such cases, alternative diagnostic methods are required. We report three elderly patients with heart failure complicated by malnutrition. In all cases, electrocardiogram showed low voltage in the limb leads and a pseudoinfarct pattern in the chest leads, and echocardiography showed left ventricular wall thickening with granular sparkling appearance. These patients were suspected of having amyloid cardiomyopathy but could not undergo myocardial biopsies because of their poor conditions. After failed attempts at biopsy of the abdominal fat pad or the other organs, subcutaneous fat tissue biopsy over the hip led to the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. The resultant diagnosis guided us to choose the appropriate treatment for the patients. This article illustrates that subcutaneous fat tissue biopsy of the hip could be a useful procedure for diagnosing systemic amyloidosis in elderly patients, particularly when a fat tissue biopsy of the abdomen is associated with a high risk of complications because of malnutrition.\n\nCancer Liquid Biopsy: Is It Ready for Clinic?\n\nPubMed\n\nPan, Ying; Ji, John S; Jin, Jason Gang; Kuo, Winston Patrick; Kang, Hongjun\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe management of cancer relies on a combination of imaging and tissue biopsy for diagnosis, monitoring, and molecular classification-based patient stratification to ensure appropriate treatment. Conventional tissue biopsy harvests tumor samples with invasive procedures, which are often difficult for patients with advanced disease. Given the well-recognized intratumor genetic heterogeneity [1], the biopsy of small tumor fragments does not necessarily represent all the genetic aberrations in the tumor, but sampling the entire tumor in each patient is not realistic. Moreover, tumors evolve all the time from local to advanced disease and by adapting to selective pressure from treatment.\n\nRefer prior to biopsy of suspected appendicular soft tissue sarcoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nElliott, Robert S J; Flint, Michael; French, Gary\n\n2012-11-23\n\nAppendicular soft tissue tumours are rare and inappropriate investigation can result in unnecessary loss of limb or life. We reviewed the investigation and referrals of patients to our institution. This is a review of prospectively collected data stored in a tumour registry database. We included all patients (126) referred to the service for investigation and management with a primary soft tissue tumour in 2006 and 2007. There was a highly significant association (RR=6.2) between pre referral procedures (PRPs) and suffering a complication (P<0.0001) in comparison to non-biopsied referrals (NBRs). Those referred by general surgeons were more likely (RR=2.6) to have undergone PRP (p<0.0017). The median interval between referral and senior author review was 8 days for the PRP group and 10 days for the NBR group (P=0.2574). Biopsy of suspected appendicular soft tissue sarcoma should be performed by a tumour specialist or in prior consultation with, to minimise adverse outcomes. There was minimal delay till review by an orthopaedic tumour specialist at Middlemore Hospital and achieving a tissue diagnosis does not expedite this.\n\nValidation of an LC-MS/MS method to measure tacrolimus in rat kidney and liver tissue and its application to human kidney biopsies.\n\nPubMed\n\nNoll, Benjamin D; Coller, Janet K; Somogyi, Andrew A; Morris, Raymond G; Russ, Graeme R; Hesselink, Dennis A; Van Gelder, Teun; Sallustio, Benedetta C\n\n2013-10-01\n\nTacrolimus (TAC) has a narrow therapeutic index and high interindividual and intraindividual pharmacokinetic variability, necessitating therapeutic drug monitoring to individualize dosage. Recent evidence suggests that intragraft TAC concentrations may better predict transplant outcomes. This study aimed to develop a method for the quantification of TAC in small biopsy-sized samples of rat kidney and liver tissue, which could be applied to clinical biopsy samples from kidney transplant recipients. Kidneys and livers were harvested from Mrp2-deficient TR- Wistar rats administered TAC (4 mgÂ·kgÂ·d for 14 days, n = 8) or vehicle (n = 10). Tissue samples (0.20-1.00 mg of dry weight) were solubilized enzymatically and underwent liquid-liquid extraction before analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. TAC-free tissue was used in the calibrator and quality control samples. Analyte detection was accomplished using positive electrospray ionization (TAC: m/z 821.5 â 768.6; internal standard ascomycin m/z 809.3 â 756.4). Calibration curves (0.04-2.6 Î¼g/L) were linear (R > 0.99, n = 10), with interday and intraday calibrator coefficients of variation and bias <17% at the lower limit of quantification and <15% at all other concentrations (n = 6-10). Extraction efficiencies for TAC and ascomycin were approximately 70%, and matrix effects were minimal. Rat kidney TAC concentrations were higher (range 109-190 pg/mg tissue) than those in the liver (range 22-53 pg/mg of tissue), with median tissue/blood concentrations ratios of 72.0 and 17.6, respectively. In 2 transplant patients, kidney TAC concentrations ranged from 119 to 285 pg/mg of tissue and were approximately 20 times higher than whole blood trough TAC concentrations. The method displayed precision and accuracy suitable for application to TAC measurement in human kidney biopsy tissue.\n\nCore needle biopsy of soft tissue tumors, CEUS vs US guided: a pilot study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCoran, Alessandro; Di Maggio, Antonio; Rastrelli, Marco; Alberioli, Enrico; Attar, Shady; Ortolan, Paolo; Bortolanza, Carlo; Tosi, Annalisa; Montesco, Maria Cristina; Bezzon, Elisabetta; Rossi, Carlo Riccardo; Stramare, Roberto\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in the bioptic sampling of soft tissue tumors (STT) compared with unenhanced ultrasonography alone. This is a prospective longitudinal study of 40 patients subjected to ultrasonography (US)-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) to characterize a suspected STT. Three series of bioptic samplings were carried out on each patient, respectively using unenhanced US alone and CEUS in both the areas of the tumor enhanced or not by the contrast medium. All bioptic samples underwent a histological evaluation and the results were analyzed by comparing the histology of the biopsy with the definitive diagnosis in 15 surgically excised samples. 27 (67.5Â %) of the 40 patients completed the entire study procedure; in 19 cases (70.3Â %) the three bioptic samplings gave unanimous results, also when compared to the surgical specimen; in seven cases (25.9Â %) use of CEUS allowed to obtain additional or more accurate information about the mass in question, compared to simple US guidance without contrast; in one patient (3.7Â %) sampling obtained using unenhanced ultrasonography guidance and in the areas enhanced by the contrast agent had precisely the same results of the surgical specimen. CEUS, due to its ability to evaluate microvascular areas, has proven to be a promising method in guiding bioptic sampling of soft tissue tumor, directing the needle to the most significant areas of the tumor. Given the small number of patients evaluated in our study, to achieve statistically significant results, it would be appropriate to obtain a larger sample size, since the very first results seem to be encouraging and to justify the increase of the population.\n\nMelanoma metastases in regional lymph nodes are accurately detected by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of fine-needle aspirate biopsy samples.\n\nPubMed\n\nStretch, Jonathan R; Somorjai, Ray; Bourne, Roger; Hsiao, Edward; Scolyer, Richard A; Dolenko, Brion; Thompson, John F; Mountford, Carolyn E; Lean, Cynthia L\n\n2005-11-01\n\nNonsurgical assessment of sentinel nodes (SNs) would offer advantages over surgical SN excision by reducing morbidity and costs. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of fine-needle aspirate biopsy (FNAB) specimens identifies melanoma lymph node metastases. This study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of the MRS method and thereby establish a basis for the future development of a nonsurgical technique for assessing SNs. FNAB samples were obtained from 118 biopsy specimens from 77 patients during SN biopsy and regional lymphadenectomy. The specimens were histologically evaluated and correlated with MRS data. Histopathologic analysis established that 56 specimens contained metastatic melanoma and that 62 specimens were benign. A linear discriminant analysis-based classifier was developed for benign tissues and metastases. The presence of metastatic melanoma in lymph nodes was predicted with a sensitivity of 92.9%, a specificity of 90.3%, and an accuracy of 91.5% in a primary data set. In a second data set that used FNAB samples separate from the original tissue samples, melanoma metastases were predicted with a sensitivity of 87.5%, a specificity of 90.3%, and an accuracy of 89.1%, thus supporting the reproducibility of the method. Proton MRS of FNAB samples may provide a robust and accurate diagnosis of metastatic disease in the regional lymph nodes of melanoma patients. These data indicate the potential for SN staging of melanoma without surgical biopsy and histopathological evaluation.\n\nSonographically guided percutaneous muscle biopsy in diagnosis of neuromuscular disease: a useful alternative to open surgical biopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Sullivan, Paul J; Gorman, Grainne M; Hardiman, Orla M; Farrell, Michael J; Logan, P Mark\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of sonographically guided percutaneous muscle biopsy in the investigation of neuromuscular disorders. Sonographically guided percutaneous needle biopsy of skeletal muscle was performed with a 14-gauge core biopsy system in 40 patients over a 24-month period. Patients were referred from the Department of Neurology under investigation for neuromuscular disorders. Sonography was used to find suitable tissue and to avoid major vascular structures. A local anesthetic was applied below skin only. A 3- to 4-mm incision was made. Three 14-gauge samples were obtained from each patient. All samples were placed on saline-dampened gauze and sent for neuropathologic analysis. As a control, we retrospectively assessed results of the 40 most recent muscle samples acquired via open surgical biopsy. With the use of sonography, 32 (80%) of 40 patients had a histologic diagnosis made via percutaneous needle biopsy. This included 26 (93%) of 28 patients with acute muscular disease and 6 (50%) of 12 patients with chronic disease. In the surgical group (all acute disease), 38 (95%) of 40 patients had diagnostic tissue attained. Sonographically guided percutaneous 14-gauge core skeletal muscle biopsy is a useful procedure, facilitating diagnosis in acute muscular disease. It provides results comparable with those of open surgical biopsy in acute muscular disease. It may also be used in chronic muscular disease but repeated or open biopsy may be needed.\n\nCervical cancer biopsy reporting: a review.\n\nPubMed\n\nReyes, Maria Carolina; Cooper, Kumarasen\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe terminology for reporting human papillomavirus-associated squamous lesions in the cervix, both in tissue samples and cytology specimens, has suffered from many changes throughout the last years creating confusion in interpreting cervical biopsy and cytology reports by clinicians. This review presents a summary and discussion of the current terminology for reporting results of cervical biopsies and cytology with emphasis in the lower anogenital squamous terminology consensus recommendations for tissue specimens and the 2001 Bethesda Workshop for reporting cytology results. Microscopic features of cervical lesions in tissue samples and cytology specimens are presented. Biomarkers, including p16 and Ki-67, are discussed and how they can help the pathologist when dealing with difficult cases.\n\nOptimising the quantification of cytokines present at low concentrations in small human mucosal tissue samples using Luminex assaysâ\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStaples, Emily; Ingram, Richard James Michael; Atherton, John Christopher; Robinson, Karen\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSensitive measurement of multiple cytokine profiles from small mucosal tissue biopsies, for example human gastric biopsies obtained through an endoscope, is technically challenging. Multiplex methods such as Luminex assays offer an attractive solution but standard protocols are not available for tissue samples. We assessed the utility of three commercial Luminex kits (VersaMAP, Bio-Plex and MILLIPLEX) to measure interleukin-17A (IL-17) and interferon-gamma (IFNÎ³) concentrations in human gastric biopsies and we optimised preparation of mucosal samples for this application. First, we assessed the technical performance, limits of sensitivity and linear dynamic ranges for each kit. Next we spiked human gastric biopsies with recombinant IL-17 and IFNÎ³ at a range of concentrations (1.5 to 1000Â pg/mL) and assessed kit accuracy for spiked cytokine recovery and intra-assay precision. We also evaluated the impact of different tissue processing methods and extraction buffers on our results. Finally we assessed recovery of endogenous cytokines in unspiked samples. In terms of sensitivity, all of the kits performed well within the manufacturers' recommended standard curve ranges but the MILLIPLEX kit provided most consistent sensitivity for low cytokine concentrations. In the spiking experiments, the MILLIPLEX kit performed most consistently over the widest range of concentrations. For tissue processing, manual disruption provided significantly improved cytokine recovery over automated methods. Our selected kit and optimised protocol were further validated by measurement of relative cytokine levels in inflamed and uninflamed gastric mucosa using Luminex and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In summary, with proper optimisation Luminex kits (and for IL-17 and IFNÎ³ the MILLIPLEX kit in particular) can be used for the sensitive detection of cytokines in mucosal biopsies. Our results should help other researchers seeking to quantify multiple low concentration cytokines in\n\nThe Diagnostic Accuracy of Incisional Biopsy in the Oral Cavity.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Sara; Forman, Michael; Sadow, Peter M; August, Meredith\n\n2016-05-01\n\nTo determine the accuracy of incisional biopsy examination to diagnose oral lesions. This retrospective cohort study was performed to determine the concordance rate between incisional biopsy examination and definitive resection diagnosis for different oral lesions. The study sample was derived from the population of patients who presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) from January 2005 through December 2012. Inclusion criteria were the diagnosis of an oral lesion from an incisional biopsy examination, subsequent diagnosis from the definitive resection of the same lesion, and complete clinical and pathologic patient records. The predictor variables were the origin and size of the lesion. The primary outcome variable was concordance between the provisional incisional biopsy diagnosis and definitive pathologic resection diagnosis. The secondary outcome variable was type of biopsy error for the discordant cases. Incisional biopsy errors were assessed and grouped into 5 categories: 1) sampling error; 2) insufficient tissue for diagnosis; 3) presence of inflammation making diagnosis difficult; 4) artifact; and 5) pathologist discordance. A total of 272 patients met the inclusion criteria. The study sample had a mean age of 47.4Â years and 55.7% were women. Of these cases, 242 (88.9%) were concordant when comparing the biopsy and final resection pathology reports. At histologic evaluation, 60.0% of discordant findings were attributed to sampling error, 23.3% to pathologist discrepancy, 13.3% to insufficient tissue provided in the biopsy specimen, and 3.4% to inflammation obscuring diagnosis. Overall, concordant cases had a larger average biopsy volume (1.53Â cm(3)) than discordant cases (0.42Â cm(3)). The data collected indicate an 88.9% diagnostic concordance with final pathologic results for incisional oral biopsy diagnoses. Sixty percent of discordance was attributed to sampling error when sampled\n\nAssessment of molecular markers demonstrates concordance between samples acquired via stereotactic biopsy and open craniotomy in both anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas.\n\nPubMed\n\nGessler, Florian; Baumgarten, Peter; Bernstock, Joshua D; Harter, Patrick; Lescher, Stephanie; Senft, Christian; Seifert, Volker; Marquardt, Gerhard; Weise, Lutz\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe classification, treatment and prognosis of high-grade gliomas has been shown to correlate with the expression of molecular markers (e.g. MGMT promotor methylation and IDH1 mutations). Acquisition of tumor samples may be obtained via stereotactic biopsy or open craniotomy. Between the years 2009 and 2013, 22 patients initially diagnosed with HGGs via stereotactic biopsy, that ultimately underwent open craniotomy for resection of their tumor were prospectively included in an institutional glioma database. MGMT promotor analysis was performed using methylation-specific (MS)-PCR and IDH1R132H mutation analysis was performed using immunohistochemistry. Three patients (13.7%) exhibited IDH1R132H mutations in samples obtained via stereotactic biopsy. Tissue derived from stereotaxic biopsy was demonstrated to have MGMT promotor methylation in ten patients (45.5%), while a non-methylated MGMT promotor was demonstrated in ten patients (45.5%); inconclusive results were obtained for the remaining two patients (9%) within our cohort. The initial histologic grading, IDH1R132H mutation and MGMT promotor methylation results were confirmed using samples obtained during open craniotomy in all but one patient; here inconclusive MGMT promotor analysis was obtained in contrast to that which was obtained via stereotactic biopsy. Tumor samples acquired via stereotactic biopsy provide accurate information with regard to clinically relevant molecular markers that have been shown to impact patient care decisions. The profile of markers analyzed in our cohort was nearly concordant between those samples obtained via stereotactic biopsy or open craniotomy thereby suggesting that clinical decisions may be based on the molecular profile of the tumor samples obtained via stereotactic biopsy.\n\nDevelopment of a microRNA-based molecular assay for the detection of papillary thyroid carcinoma in aspiration biopsy samples.\n\nPubMed\n\nMazeh, Haggi; Mizrahi, Ido; Halle, David; Ilyayev, Nadia; Stojadinovic, Alexander; Trink, Barry; Mitrani-Rosenbaum, Stella; Roistacher, Marina; Ariel, Ilana; Eid, Ahmed; Freund, Herbert R; Nissan, Aviram\n\n2011-02-01\n\nAlthough thyroid nodules are common and diagnosed in over 5% of the adult population, only 5% harbor malignancy. Patients with clinically suspicious thyroid nodules need to undergo fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). The main limitation of FNAB remains indeterminate cytopathology. Only 20%-30% of the indeterminate nodules harbor malignancy, and therefore up to 80% of patients undergo unnecessary thyroidectomy. The aim of this study was to identify and validate a panel of microRNAs (miRNAs) that could serve as a platform for an FNAB-based diagnostic for thyroid neoplasms. The study population included 27 consecutive patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for FNAB-based papillary thyroid cancer (nâ=â20) and benign disorders (nâ=â7). Aspiration biopsy was performed from the index lesion and from the opposite lobe normal tissue in all study patients at the time of operation. RNA was extracted from all aspiration biopsy samples. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction on a panel of previously selected miRNAs was performed. Polymerase chain reaction results were compared with final histopathology. miRNA from tumor tissues was amplified using the highest value of each miRNA expression in normal tissue as a threshold for malignancy detection. Diagnostic characteristics were most favorable for mir-221 in differentiating benign from malignant thyroid pathology. mir-221 was overexpressed in 19 patients (pâ<â0.0001) with a sensitive yield of 95%. Specificity, negative and positive predictive value, and accuracy of the miRNA panel were 100%, 96%, 100%, and 98%, respectively. miRNA quantification for differential diagnosis of thyroid neoplasms within aspiration biopsy samples is feasible and may improve the accuracy of FNAB cytology.\n\nThe liquid biopsy in lung cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnsari, Junaid; Yun, Jungmi W; Kompelli, Anvesh R; Moufarrej, Youmna E; Alexander, Jonathan S; Herrera, Guillermo A; Shackelford, Rodney E\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe incidence of lung cancer has significantly increased over the last century, largely due to smoking, and remains the most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. This is often due to lung cancer first presenting at late stages and a lack of curative therapeutic options at these later stages. Delayed diagnoses, inadequate tumor sampling, and lung cancer misdiagnoses are also not uncommon due to the limitations of the tissue biopsy. Our better understanding of the tumor microenvironment and the systemic actions of tumors, combined with the recent advent of the liquid biopsy, may allow molecular diagnostics to be done on circulating tumor markers, particularly circulating tumor DNA. Multiple liquid biopsy molecular methods are presently being examined to determine their efficacy as surrogates to the tumor tissue biopsy. This review will focus on new liquid biopsy technologies and how they may assist in lung cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\nA randomized controlled trial of electrocoagulation-enabled biopsy versus conventional biopsy in the diagnosis of endobronchial lesions.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhan, Ajmal; Aggarwal, Ashutosh N; Agarwal, Ritesh; Bal, Amanjit; Gupta, Dheeraj\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAlthough electrocoagulation at time of endobronchial biopsy can potentially reduce procedure-related bleeding during fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB), it can also impair quality of tissue specimen; credible data for either are lacking. To evaluate the impact of hot biopsy on the quality of tissue samples and to quantify the amount of procedure-related bleeding during endobronchial biopsy. In this single-center, prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled study we included adult patients referred for FOB and having endobronchial lesions. Patients were randomized to bronchial biopsy using an electrocoagulation-enabled biopsy forceps, with (EC+ group) or without (EC- group) application of electrocoagulation current (40 W for 10 s in a monopolar mode). Procedure-related bleeding was semi-quantified by observer description, as well as through a visual analogue scale. Overall quality of biopsy specimen and tissue damage were assessed and graded by a pulmonary pathologist blinded to FOB details. 160 patients were randomized to endobronchial biopsy with (n = 81) or without (n = 79) the application of electrocoagulation. There were no severe bleeding episodes in either group, and severity of bleeding in the EC+ and EC- groups was similar (median visual analogue scale scores of 14 and 16, respectively). Histopathological diagnosis was similar in the EC+ and EC- groups (77.8% and 82.3%, respectively). There was no significant difference in tissue quality between the two groups. Use of electrocoagulation-enabled endobronchial biopsy does not alter specimen quality and does not result in any significant reduction in procedure-related bleeding. Copyright Â© 2010 S.

Twenty-one CT-guided transgluteal prostate biopsy procedures were performed in 16 men (mean age, 68 years; age range, 60-78 years) who were under conscious sedation. The mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was 11.4 ng/mL (range, 2.3-39.4 ng/mL). Six had seven prior unsuccessful transperineal or transurethral biopsies. Biopsy results, complications, sedation time, and radiation dose were recorded. The mean PSA values and number of core specimens were compared between patients with malignant results and patients with nonmalignant results using the Student t test. The average procedural sedation time was 50.6 minutes (range, 15-90 minutes) (n = 20), and the mean effective radiation dose was 8.2 mSv (median, 6.6 mSv; range 3.6-19.3 mSv) (n = 13). Twenty of the 21 (95%) procedures were technically successful. The only complication was a single episode of gross hematuria and penile pain in one patient, which resolved spontaneously. Of 20 successful biopsies, 8 (40%) yielded adenocarcinoma (Gleason score: mean, 8; range, 7-9). Twelve biopsies yielded nonmalignant results (60%): high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (n = 3) or benign prostatic tissue with or without inflammation (n = 9). Three patients had carcinoma diagnosed on subsequent biopsies (second biopsy, n = 2 patients; third biopsy, n = 1 patient). A malignant biopsy result was not significantly associated with the number of core specimens (p = 0.3) or the mean PSA value (p = 0.1). CT-guided transgluteal prostate biopsy is a safe and reliable technique for the systematic random sampling of the prostate in patients without a rectal access. In patients with initial negative biopsy results, repeat biopsy should be considered if there is a persistent rise in the PSA value.\n\nA case of Churg-Strauss syndrome: tissue diagnosis established by sigmoidoscopic rectal biopsy.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeen, E J; Rees, P J; Sanderson, J D; Wilkinson, M L; Filipe, M I\n\n1996-01-01\n\nA case is presented of Churg-Strauss syndrome in a young man in whom the definitive diagnostic procedure was a full thickness sigmoidoscopic rectal biopsy, with submucosal sampling. Gastrointestinal changes in Churg-Strauss syndrome, a rare systemic illness characterised by asthma, blood and tissue eosinophilia, vasculitis, and granulomatous inflammation are common but poorly reported. The endoscopic and histopathological features of a case are described and emphasise the potential value of a limited sigmoidoscopy in establishing the diagnosis, when lower gastrointestinal symptoms are present.

All CT-guided sacroiliac joint sampling procedures for suspected infection were reviewed for sampling type (aspiration, lavage aspiration, biopsy), microbiology results, and clinical and imaging follow-up. The primary gold standard was anatomic pathology. If pathology was not available, then positive blood culture with the same organism as SIJ sampling, imaging and clinical follow-up, or clinical follow-up only were used. Anterior and posterior joint distention was evaluated by MRI within 7Â days of the procedure. A total of 34 patients (age 39Â Â±Â 20 (range, 6-75) years; 21Â F, 13Â M) were included. Aspiration samples only were obtained in 13/34 (38%) cases, biopsy samples only in 9/34 (26%) cases, and both samples in 12/34 (35%) cases. There was an overall 54% sensitivity and 86% specificity. For the aspiration samples, sensitivity and specificity were 60 and 81%, respectively, compared to 45 and 90% for the biopsy samples. In cases with both samples, biopsy did not add additional microbial information. Seventeen (17/34, 50%) patients had an MRI. The anterior joint was more distended than the posterior joint in 15/17 (88%) of patients, and this difference was significant (PÂ =Â 0.0003). All of these 17 patients had an attempted aspiration by a posterior approach; 6/17 (35%) resulted in a successful aspiration. Aspiration of the sacroiliac joint has a higher sensitivity than biopsy and should always be attempted first. MRI may be helpful for procedure planning.\n\nUse of hydrogel breast biopsy tissue markers reduces the need for wire localization.\n\nPubMed\n\nBlumencranz, Peter W; Ellis, Debra; Barlowe, Kylee\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether breast biopsy tissue markers composed of an ultrasound-visible hydrogel reduced the need for preoperative wire localization (WL) in patients undergoing a partial mastectomy. A single-surgeon, single-institution, retrospective chart review was performed on 691 consecutive female patients, with mean age 67 years (range 36-98 years), from 2009 to 2012 undergoing partial mastectomies after percutaneous biopsies by stereotactic or ultrasound guidance. Overall, the use of WL was more frequent in patients who had standard (other) markers placed during biopsy as opposed to those with hydrogel markers (HydroMARK). For stereotactic biopsy, 75.8 % of patients with a standard marker required WL versus 17.1 % with HydroMARK and for ultrasound biopsy, 22.6 % standard versus 4.3 % HydroMARK (p < .0001, p < .0001). In some cases where hydrogel markers were used, WL was used for \"bracketing\" because of the presence of microcalcifications. In cases where standard markers were used, WL was not used because of either IOUS visibility of residual lesion or marker visibility. Specimen volume and re-excision rate were comparable between patients with hydrogel and standard markers, showing no significant differences (p = .1673, p = .1813 respectively). Hydrogel biopsy tissue markers optimize the surgeon's ability to perform a partial mastectomy without the use of WL. HydroMARK was as effective as a standard marker in terms of partial mastectomy specimen volume and re-excision rate. This yields potential for cost savings, increased efficacy in operating room and radiology scheduling, and patient comfort and convenience.\n\nPathologists and liquid biopsies: to be or not to be?\n\nPubMed\n\nHofman, Paul; Popper, Helmut H\n\n2016-12-01\n\nRecently, the advent of therapies targeting genomic alterations has improved the care of patients with certain types of cancer. While molecular targets were initially detected in nucleic acid samples extracted from tumor tissue, detection of nucleic acids in circulating blood has allowed the development of what has become known as liquid biopsies, which provide a complementary and alternative sample source allowing identification of genomic alterations that might be addressed by targeted therapy. Consequently, liquid biopsies might rapidly revolutionize oncology practice in allowing administration of more effective treatments. Liquid biopsies also provide an approach towards short-term monitoring of metastatic cancer patients to evaluate efficacy of treatment and/or early detection of secondary mutations responsible for resistance to treatment. In this context, pathologists, who have already been required in recent years to take interest in the domain of molecular pathology of cancer, now face new challenges. The attitude of pathologists to and level of involvement in the practice of liquid biopsies, including mastering the methods employed in molecular analysis of blood samples, need close attention. Regardless of the level of involvement of pathologists in this new field, it is mandatory that oncologists, biologists, geneticists, and pathologists work together to coordinate the pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical phases of molecular assessment of tissue and liquid samples of individual cancer patients. The challenges include (1) implementation of effective and efficient procedures for reception and analysis of liquid and tissue samples for histopathological and molecular evaluation and (2) assuring short turn-around times to facilitate rapid optimization of individual patient treatment. In this paper, we will review the following: (1) recent data concerning the concept of liquid biopsies in oncology and its development for patient care, (2) advantages\n\nBasics of kidney biopsy: A nephrologist's perspective\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAgarwal, S. K.; Sethi, S.; Dinda, A. K.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe introduction of the kidney biopsy is one of the major events in the history of nephrology. Primary indications of kidney biopsy are glomerular hematuria/proteinuria with or without renal dysfunction and unexplained renal failure. Kidney biopsy is usually performed in prone position but in certain situations, supine and lateral positions may be required. Biopsy needles have changed with times from VimâSilverman needle to Tru-cut needle to spring-loaded automatic gun. The procedure has also changed from blind bedside kidney biopsy to ultrasound marking to real-time ultrasound guidance to rarely computerized tomography guidance and laparoscopic and open biopsy. In very specific situations, transjugular kidney biopsy may be required. Most of the centers do kidney biopsy on short 1-day admission, whereas some take it as an outdoor procedure. For critical interpretation of kidney biopsy, adequate sample and clinical information are mandatory. Tissue needs to be stained with multiple stains for delineation of various components of kidney tissue. Many consider that electron microscopy (EM) is a must for all kidney biopsies, but facilities for EM are limited even in big centers. Sophisticated tests such as immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization are useful adjuncts for definitive diagnosis in certain situations.

Despite endourologists researching urinary stone disease using endoscopes to collect tissue, this tissue collection method is limited. Endoscopically removed tissues are small in size, restricting the types of genome-based examination possible. We investigated a new method of renal papilla biopsy and RNA extraction to establish a genomic research methodology for kidney stone disease. We conducted a prospective multi-institutional study and collected renal papilla specimens from consecutive percutaneous nephrolithotomy and ureteroscopy (URS) cases performed for removal of upper urinary tract stones. Renal papilla tissue was extracted using ureteroscopic biopsy forceps after stone removal. RNA was extracted using two different extraction kits, and their quantity and quality were examined. Additionally, the impact of biopsy on surgical complications was compared between cases performed with and without biopsy by matched case-control analysis adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, bilaterality, and stone burden. A total of 90 biopsies from 49 patients were performed, and the median duration between specimen collection and RNA extraction was 61 days. Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed BIGopsy Â® forceps usage significantly increased the total yield (pâ=â0.004) and quality (pâ=â0.001 for A260/280, pâ=â0.004 for A260/A230) of extracted RNA. Extraction using the RNeasy Micro Kit Â® also improved A260/A230, whereas reduced RNA integrity number of extracted RNA by univariate and multivariate analyses (pâ=â0.002 and pâ<â0.001, respectively). Moreover, matched case-control study demonstrated that endoscopic renal papilla biopsy caused no significant surgical complications, including bleeding, decreased stone clearance and hematocrit, and renal dysfunction. Biopsies during URS imparted an average of 20 minutes of procedure time over nonbiopsy\n\n[Transabdominal chorionic villus sampling using biopsy forceps or needle: pregnancy outcomes by technique used].\n\nPubMed\n\nSpallina, J; Anselem, O; Haddad, B; Touboul, C; Tsatsaris, V; Le Ray, C\n\n2014-11-01\n\nTo compare pregnancy outcomes after transabdominal chorionic villus sampling using biopsy forceps or needle. Retrospective bicentric study including all women who had a transabdominal chorionic villus sampling between 2005 and 2009 (172 using biopsy forceps and 160 using needle). The primary endpoint was the rate of fetal loss, after excluding medical abortion due to the result of the biopsy. The secondary endpoint was the rate of premature rupture of the membrane. All cases were reviewed to try to determine the responsibility of the biopsy. The pregnancy outcomes were not different between the two groups: 4 (4.4%) fetal losses in the biopsy forceps group and 6 (7.4%) in the needle group (P=0.52). Only one case (1.2%) of fetal loss can be attributed to the biopsy, using a needle, and none (0%) following a forceps biospy (P=0.29). The rate of premature rupture of the membrane was comparable in the two groups. The pregnancy outcomes following chorionic villus sampling using a biopsy forceps or a needle seem comparable.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the viability of testicular sampling from live birds by assessing the impact on the birds' health, testicular integrity, and sperm quality. Testicular biopsy samples were obtained by endoscopy 4 times during 12 months from 9 cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) and 7 rose-ringed parakeets (Psittacula krameri). Only 2 of 16 birds showed testicular cicatrization or divided testicular tissue after a single endoscopy. Further complications, such as damage to the air sacs or bleeding, predominantly occurred in subsequent endoscopies. In both species, endoscopy and testicular biopsy caused only minor or transient effects on sperm production and sperm quality. These results support that a single testicular biopsy is a viable method for evaluating the reproductive status of male psittacine birds.\n\nA definitive dia"
