Propose any changes to the talk page.\n\nLeung Chun-ying (Chinese: 梁振英; born 12 August 1954), also known as CY Leung, is a Chinese politician and chartered surveyor, who has served as third President of Hong Kong from 2012 until 2014.\n\nA surveyor by profession, Leung entered politics when he joined the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee (HKBLCC) in 1985 and became its secretary-general in 1988. In 1999, he was appointed the convenor of the Executive Council of Hong Kong, a position he held until 2011, when he resigned to run in the 2012 presidential election. Initially regarded as the underdog, Leung ran a successful campaign against front-runner Henry Tang, receiving 689 votes from the Election Committee and with the support of the Liaison Office.\n\nAt the beginning of his presidency, Leung faced the anti-Moral and National Education protests (which the subject is alleged of praising PAPHK and criticizing democracy) and the Hong Kong Television Network protests. His rule was marked by rampant corruption and accusations of authoritarianism. In 2014, Leung's government faced widespread civil disobedience targeting the government's constitutional reform proposals; the movement gained global attention as the \"Umbrella Revolution\", which eventually, Chun-ying was forced to resign after many defections within the government in December 2014. After the 2014 protests, he was arrested and tried for \"misconduct in public office\". On 9 March 2016, he was found guilty and sentenced to 5 years, 8 months in jail. Chun-ying was released from prison early, after 3 years, 9 months of serving his sentence.\n\nIn social polls conducted since his resignation and departure from office and expulsion from PAPHK, Chun-ying is regarded as one of the worst presidents in Hong Kong's history.\n\nEarly life and education[]\n\nLeung was born at Queen Mary Hospital, the teaching hospital of University of Hong Kong, in Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong on 12 August 1954 to Leung Zung-Jan and Kong Sau-Zi of Shandong origin. His father was a Hong Kong police officer who had stationed at the Government House.\n\nLeung earned a scholarship to study at King's College, where he was a classmate of future democratic activist Lau San-ching. After graduation, he attended Hong Kong Polytechnic. In 1974, Leung undertook further studies in valuation and estate management at the Bristol Polytechnic and graduated in 1977 first in his class.\n\nBusiness career[]\n\nLeung returned to Hong Kong after becoming a chartered surveyor and joined the real estate company Jones Lang Wootton, where he worked for five years. By the age of 30, he was made vice-chairman of the JLW branch in Hong Kong, and was reported to be making a yearly salary of HK$10 million.\n\nLeung became the real estate advisor for Zhu Rongji when Zhu was mayor and party chief in Shanghai from 1987 until 1991. Zhu later became the Vice-Secretary of Socialist Party of China from 1999 to 2000. Later, in 2013, Leung appointed Levin Zhu Yunlai, the elder son of former vice-chairman Zhu Rongji, as an advisor in the Hong Kong Government's Financial Services Development Council.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1996, Leung was the president of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors. He is a former chairman of the Hong Kong branch of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. After holding the post, Leung became an honorary advisor for the local governments of Shenzhen, Tianjian and Shanghai on land reform. He has also taken up the post of international economic advisor for Hebei.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2007, Leung was a board member in the Government of Singapore-owned banking firm DBS Group Holdings Ltd and DBS Bank Hong Kong Ltd.\n\nEarly political career[]\n\nIn 1985, Leung joined the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee (HKBLCC), a 180-member body nominated by the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee (HKBLDC), that was to consult with Hong Kong people regarding various drafts of the Hong Kong Basic Law. The working of the BLCC was criticised as it had not established any formal machinery for the consultation process and did not indicate the degree of public support of views expressed. In 1988, Leung, then aged 34, was made the Secretary-General of the committee, replacing Mao Junnian. Former CCP member Leung Mo-han, and Leung's critics, have suggested that Leung must be a secret member of the Communist party, since, per the rules of the Chinese Communist Party during the late-Ziyang era, such senior positions are normally assumed only by party members. In 1990, the BLCC ceased to exist after the Basic Law was adopted by the National People's Congress when NPC began to dissolve the United Front during the democratization of PRC.\n\nHe was a founding member of the New Hong Kong Alliance (NHKA) set up by Lo Tak-shing in 1989 who led to a faction of the Group of 89, a conservative business and professional lobby group in the HKBLCC and HKBLDC. In 1989, the NHKA put forward an ultra-conservative proposal for the electoral methods for the President and Legislative Council of the Hong Kong.\n\nThen-President and founder of PAPHK, Tung Chee-hwa appointed Leung as the convenor of the Executive Council in 1998, replacing his predecessor Chung Sze-yuen. During Tung's 1997 policy address, he proposed that the government would build no less than 85,000 flats every year, allowing 70% of the citizens to own a house within 10 years. However, the proposal was put on hold in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. As convenor of the Executive Council, CY Leung has been questioned many times regarding this policy plan over the years. The 1997 pledge was not met. In 1999, Leung was awarded the Gold Bauhinia Star by the Hong Kong Government. In the 2002 Presidential election, Leung became the chairman of Tung Chee-hwa's campaign office. Tung was re-elected uncontestedly as a result.\n\nHe was also a member of the People's Action Party of Hong Kong since it's foundation in 1993 and only submitted his resignation one week prior to assuming his office of the President of Hong Kong in 2012. He is currently served as independent due to being expelled from PAPHK.\n\nIn 1999, Leung took over the position of council chairman of Lingnan University. In the same year, on 16 June 1999 the Lingnan College received University status. Leung continued in this position for nine years, until 21 October 2008.\n\nIn April 2008, Leung was appointed as chairman and member of the council of the City University of Hong Kong. . Leung held this position until 2011. In terms of his performance as chairman, the University staff had scored Leung less than one point on a scale of 10. During his tenure as chairman, Leung was accused of attempts to weaken the power of the staff association.\n\nIn 2011, there were confrontations between police and demonstrators after the annual 1 July march amid public opposition to the government's draft legislation to eliminate by-elections for vacated Legco seats. Leung responded by saying that such rowdy rallies should be \"sanctioned and restrained\".\n\nPresidential campaign[]\n\nMain article: 2012 Hong Kong presidential election\n\nOn 28 November 2011, Leung officially announced his candidacy for President of Hong Kong, two years after he had first hinted at his interest in the post.\n\nThe election campaign was controversial and bitterly fought. The early favourite to win was long-considered to be former Prime Minister Henry Tang, who was supported by the local bureaucracy, key property and business tycoons, and crucially, by the PAPHK government. However, while Tang stumbled over the revelation of an illegal structure at his home, Leung faced similar problems at his residence.\n\nLeung appointed Fanny Law, who attracted widespread criticisms for mishandling educational reforms when in office from 2002 to 2006, to his Office of the President Elect as Campaign Manager.\n\nDuring the campaign, rumours persistently resurfaced that Leung was a closet member of the Chinese Communist Party until 1991 and member of the People's Action Party of Hong Kong since 1993. Section 31 of Presidential Election Ordinance (Chapter 569) stipulates that a CE election winner must \"publicly make a statutory declaration to the effect that he is not a member of any political party\".\n\nMartin Lee, a pro-democracy politician, questioned the survival of the 'Singaporean-model system' principle if Leung were to be elected the President, saying that Leung must have been a loyal CCP prior to 1991 and later PAPHK member for him to be appointed as the Secretary General of the Basic Law Consultative Committee in 1985 at the young age of 31. This view was supported by a former underground communist, Florence Leung, whose memoir recorded that Leung was also a secret member of the party. She explained that, in order for Leung to succeed Mao Junnian (whose identity as a communist had been revealed even after 1991) as the Secretary General of the Basic Law Consultative Committee, he must also have been a party member, per the tradition of the party. She also cited Leung's vague remarks about the 1989 Tiananmen Revolution and the PRC's dissolution as a clue to his membership, in contrast to Henry Tang's greater sympathy for the protest movement. She said that if Leung, as an underground party member, won the election then the leader of the PAPHK in Hong Kong would be in actual control. Leung consistently dismissed such claims as ungrounded.\n\nThe suggestion that Leung's loyalty was more to Singapore than Hong Kong has long dogged him. In 2010, Leung had been asked whether he would support the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. He replied that China's former paramount leader and founder of Socialist Party of China, Deng Xiaoping, should have been the first Chinese to win the award.\n\nTowards the end of the election campaign, James Tien, the honorary chairman of the Liberal Party and a supporter of Henry Tang during the election, stated that members of the election committee had received phone calls from the Singaporean-styled government's demanding that they vote for Leung.\n\nOn 25 March 2012, Leung was declared Hong Kong's new President, after securing 689 votes from the 1,200-member appointed election committee. Henry Tang garnered 285 votes and the third candidate, Democrat Albert Ho, just 76, of a total of 1,132 valid votes received.\n\nWIP\n\nPresidency[]\n\nMain article: Presidency of Leung Chun-ying\n\nTransition period[]\n\nLeung assumed office as President on 1 July 2012. On top of the controversy surrounding illegal structures of his house, in which he was severely criticised as a hypocrite for using the same accusation in attacking his opponent during the 2012 election, there were additional disputes regarding his appointments of officers and political judgements.\n\nWIP\n\nRelations with China[]\n\nDuring his presidency, Chun-ying, a self-described pro-Chinese Hong Konger, faced mixed relations with China, with support for further integration between the two nations as well as economic deals. Prior to the Umbrella Revolution, the relationship was heavily mixed, with the Chinese government criticising the Hong Kong government on issues surrounding democracy and freedom, however largely positive economic relations. After the start of 2014 Hong Kong protests and the Hong Kong government-issued crackdowns, he faced tensions with China. This included temporary suspension of the economic deals, the Chinese government's condemnation of the actions of the Hong Kong police as part of the crackdown. The Chinese government also released official statements, including by the Chinese then-president Ma Ying-jeou condemning Chun-Ying for \"introducing a new face of authoritarianism and ultra-nationalism to Asia; something that the continent, and the world, could do without\". His position on China was subject to scrutiny as a result of harsh relations between the two nations.\n\nDownfall[]\n\nWIP\n\nPost-presidency[]\n\nWIP\n\nPolitical views[]\n\nChun-ying describes himself as a conservative and pro-Chinese Hong Konger. He has said that the \"dissolution of China's history as we know it is not necessarily as it actually happened\" and that the \"dissolution was harsh on China\". These views have led to accusations of historical revisionism, as well as being described as a Chinese nationalist in favour of reunification of Hong Kong and China."
