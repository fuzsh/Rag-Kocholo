In this agreement, China has promised that, under its \"one country, two systems\" formula, China's socialist economic system will not be imposed on Hong Kong and that Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense affairs for the next 50 years.\n\nExecutive branch:\n\nchief of state: President of China HU Jintao (since 15 March 2003)\n\nhead of government: Chief Executive TUNG Chee-hwa (since 1 July 1997)\n\ncabinet: Executive Council consists of seven non-official members and 14 official members; including Chief Secretary Donald TSANG Yam-kuen (since 1 May 2001), Financial Secretary Henry TANG (since 2 August 2003), and Secretary of Justice Elsie LEUNG (since 1 July 1997)\n\nelections: TUNG Chee-hwa was elected to a second term in March 2002 by an 800-member election committee dominated by pro-Beijing forces; the next election is scheduled to be held in 2007"
