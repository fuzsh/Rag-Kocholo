        "text": "Study area and Methods\n\nStudy area.—Field work was based at Bigal River Biological Reserve Research Station (Fig. 1). The Bigal River Biological Reserve (BRBR) is a private conservation area protecting c.1,000 ha of forested terrain in the east Andean foothills of Ecuador at 750–1,000 m (Fig. 1; see also Freile et al. 2015). The reserve lies near the western border of Orellana province on the lower, eastern slope of Volcán Sumaco (00°32′32″S, 77°25′40″W; Fig. 1) and lies southeast of, and adjacent to, the far larger Parque Nacional Sumaco-Napo-Galeras (PNSNG), a national protected area (IUCN category II) established in 1994 that covers 2,061 km2 (IUCN 2023) of mostly forested terrain at 600–3,732 m.\n\nThe region receives prevailing winds from the east and the climate is extremely wet, with low seasonal variability, a relative max. rainfall in July, and the highest regional rainfall (>4 m per annum) expected at elevations of c.900–1,000 m (Laraque et al. 2007). While rainfall may be heavy, ground-level cloud cover (mist) is infrequent. A poorly defined period of less frequent precipitation lasts from January to February, corresponding to the Northern Hemisphere dry season, and dry periods may also occur in August, during the Southern Hemisphere dry season.\n\nThis hilly region is drained by the río Suno to the south and the río Bigal to the north (Fig. 1). The dominant vegetation type is tall, humid broadleaf evergreen (terra firme) forest (‘Western Amazon Sub-Andean Forest’ sensu Báez et al. 2010) with some canopy emergents >40 m tall. This forest is rich in tree species but dominated by Iriartea deltoidea and other palms (Brokaw & Ward 2023). Numerous small streams, swamps and damp ravines are features. Stands (some >5 ha) of Guadua angustifolia bamboo occur in some areas. Higher terrain on exposed ridges with poor soil or subject to desiccating winds hosts relatively drier forest with fewer epiphytes and more open understorey. Whereas most of the study area is clothed in tall (>30 m), closed-canopy, primary forest, some successional vegetation occurs in abandoned clearings and along a disused road. We also surveyed and include observations from nearby degraded areas, including cattle pastures, crop fields, second growth and forest fragments south of the BRBR Research Station (Fig. 1).\n\nThe area is the source of historical bird specimens collected during the early 20th century by the Olalla family (Olalla & Hijos; Fig. 2) at San José de Sumaco and synonymous or nearby localities including ‘San José Abajo’, ‘San José Nuevo’ and ‘San José Viejo’ during 1923–35, with labels bearing the names ‘Olalla Y Hijos’, ‘Olalla Y Hermanos’ and ‘Carlos Olalla’ (Chapman 1926, Paynter 1993, LeCroy & Sloss 2000, Wiley 2010; see below).\n\nMethods.—We visited the San José de Sumaco area, usually for 11-day periods, during each August and January in the years 2015–23 for a total of 198 observer days. Birds were recorded via field observation, photography and sound-recording of vocalisations. To establish a baseline for future monitoring, formal survey methods were adopted in 2017 and followed during 18–29 August 2017, 3–14 January 2018, 13–24 August 2018, 5–16 August 2019, 6–17 January 2020 and 1–14 December 2020. FE conducted point counts along six (1.25 km) transects, all located within 2 km of the RBBR Research Station at elevations of 900–1,000 m (Fig. 1). Five transects followed pre-established footpaths in primary forest, and the other an unpaved road extending to the south and traversing disturbed habitats. On six mornings during each 11-day sampling period, FE conducted six counts on one of six transects at fixed points separated by 200–250 m. Point counts were conducted between sunrise (05.55–06.00 h) and two hours later. During a ten-minute period stationed at each point, FE recorded all species heard or seen. The daily order of point sampling was changed in successive visits so that each point was visited at least once closest to dawn. Not all species were equally well sampled by this method. Canopy species and species that vocalise infrequently may have been overlooked, while conspicuous or persistently vocalising species may be over-represented. To help overcome reporting bias, each point count was recorded using a Zoom 5 digital recorder equipped with omni-directional microphone and FE's written notes were later compared with the recordings, and any omissions and errors corrected. FE also compiled 280 20-species ‘MacKinnon lists’ (Bibby et al. 2000, MacLeod et al. 2011) and we collected additional observational data while making non-systematic visual and auditory observations along trails and roads. Relative abundance for species detected using standardised methods was determined based on encounter frequency (Appendix 1). Daily checklists including photographs and sound-recordings are available on eBird ( https://ebird.org/home).\n\nWe reviewed 10,312 photographs of birds captured by an array of 13 motion-activated passive infrared detection cameras (camera-traps) used to monitor terrestrial mammals. Camera-traps were deployed in all months during 2013–20 and sited mainly along trails and streamsides inside tall broadleaf forest. One was positioned at a ‘mineral-lick’ visited by both mammals and birds. We sorted the photographs into 1,169 independent events (separated by >1 hour) and calculated frequencies for each species represented (Table 1). We also sought documented observations from other observers (see Acknowledgements) and reviewed records in the citizen science database eBird (2022).\n\nFinally, we searched the regional literature and queried natural history collection databases for records of bird specimens collected at ‘San José de Sumaco’ and synonymous localities including ‘San José Nuevo’ and ‘San José Viejo’ (Chapman 1926, Paynter 1993, LeCroy & Sloss 2000, Wiley 2010; see below).\n\nSpecies accounts\n\nGREY TINAMOU Tinamus tao\n\nRare across its circum-Amazonian distribution and considered Vulnerable at both global (IUCN 2023) and national levels (Freile et al. 2019). In Ecuador, known only from mid-elevations at 400–1,600 m (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018). Chapman (1926) cited Salvadori & Festa (1900) who listed a specimen from ‘San José’ and Paynter (1993) incorrectly stated ‘this probably San José Nuevo’, but the itinerary for Enrico Festa in Chapman (1926) indicates that the specimen is correctly traced to Morona-Santiago province in south Ecuador. We regard the species as rare at San José de Sumaco, with presence documented by sound-recordings and camera-trap photographs.\n\nNOCTURNAL CURASSOW Nothocrax urumutum\n\nThought to range mainly below 400 m, but recently documented at 1,481 m (Medrano-Vizcaíno & Rueda 2018). Considered rare and poorly known but recent camera-trap studies have contributed to our understanding of this enigmatic species (Solano-Ugalde & Real-Jibaja 2010, van der Hoek et al. 2018, Link et al. 2022). N. urumutum was among the most frequently recorded bird species in camera-trap photographs at c.950 m (Table 1), always during daylight hours (06.00–17.00 h). The images also document regular visits to a mineral lick, often in groups of up to four (Fig. 3), behaviour first reported recently for the species (Griffiths et al. 2020). We twice encountered family groups with dependent young (during daylight hours) and detected N. urumutum regularly by voice at night as birds called from midstorey perches.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nThirty-five bird species recorded at 13 camera trap stations in 10,312 photographs (n = 1,669) events at San José de Sumaco. Independent events are defined as photo series separated by >1 hour.\n\nSALVIN'S CURASSOW Mitu salvini\n\nConsidered Near Threatened (Freile et al. 2019) in Ecuador, where found mainly below 400 m (Freile & Restall 2018) although Ridgely & Greenfield (2001) noted historical records from 700–900 m and there are recent reports at 800 and 900 m in southern Ecuador (Ordóñez-Delgado et al. 2017, Pozo-Zamora et al. 2022). We encountered M. salvini regularly in the vicinity of the RBBR at c.950 m, and the species was among the most frequently recorded by camera-traps (Table 1).\n\nRUFOUS-VENTED GROUND CUCKOO Neomorphus geoffroyi\n\nForest-dependent and rare across its vast range. Considered Vulnerable by IUCN (2023) and Near Threatened in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019). Chapman (1926) listed three males in AMNH. These are AMNH 179093–094 taken at ‘San José de Sumarco’ [sic] on 20 and 21 March 1923, and AMNH 179095 taken ‘below San José de Sumarco’ [sic]’ on 31 March 1923. One was heard calling at the RBBR Research Station at c.950 m on 8–10 December 2020. Another was reportedly seen nearby on 21 July 2022 (R. McKay in litt. 2022).\n\nOILBIRD Steatornis caripensis\n\nLocally distributed in the Ecuadorian Andes and adjacent eastern lowlands (Freile & Restall 2018). Undertakes local or seasonal movements away from nesting areas (Cárdenas et al. 2020) with a colony recently reported from lowlands on the río Pusuno in southern Napo province (Cisneros-Heredia et al. 2012). We have reports from December–April and the species is documented by a sound-recording made on 9 April 2022 at the RBBR Research Station at c.950 m.\n\nLONG-TAILED POTOO Nyctibius aethereus\n\nRare and local in east Ecuador, where reported mainly in terra firme forest below 700 m (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018). A female at AMNH (178975) was taken on 31 March 1923 ‘below San José’ (Chapman 1926). We did not encounter the species during our survey.\n\nSPOT-FRONTED SWIFT Cypseloides cherriei\n\nRare in Ecuador (Marín 1993, Ridgely & Greenfield 2001) and considered Data Deficient at both global (IUCN 2023) and national levels (Freile et al. 2019). We observed the species regularly in small numbers and obtained photographs, typically late in the day, as swifts made regular movements from the south-east to north-west, perhaps returning from the lowlands to nesting or roosting sites at higher elevations on Volcán Sumaco. C. cherriei was typically seen with other swifts including the more numerous White-collared Streptoprocne zonaris and Chestnut-collared Swifts S. rutilus.\n\nWHITE-CHINNED SWIFT Cypseloides cryptus\n\nRare and poorly known in Ecuador (Marín 1993, Ridgely & Greenfield 2001). Review of several thousand photographs suggests that C. cryptus is the commonest of the three Cypseloides at San José de Sumaco. As with the previous species, C. cryptus was typically seen in mixed groups of swifts that included larger numbers of White-collared Streptoprocne zonaris and Chestnut-collared Swifts S. rutilus. Cypseloides were sometimes present overhead throughout the day but were most often seen in early evening while feeding or transiting over the RBBR Research Station clearing (Fig. 4).\n\nWHITE-CHESTED SWIFT Cypseloides lemosi\n\nRare and long known only from south-west Colombia but recently reported from east Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Howell 2002, Roesler et al. 2009). C. lemosi was the least common Cypseloides at San José de Sumaco (Fig. 4) and was typically seen with larger numbers of White-collared Swift Streptoprocne zonaris.\n\nECUADORIAN PIEDTAIL Phlogophilus hemileucurus\n\nRestricted to east Andean foothills. Formerly considered Vulnerable by IUCN (2016) and treated as Near Threatened in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019). Specimens (presumably AMNH 179053, 185059, 185062–063) from ‘below San José’ were mentioned by Chapman (1926). Among the most frequently encountered hummingbirds of interior forest understorey at San José de Sumaco. We found P. hemileucurus at ten (32%) of 31 forest interior-transect points and regard it as fairly common.\n\nLONG-TAILED SYLPH Aglaiocercus kingii\n\nA mid-montane species (sensu Stotz et al. 1996) considered to range above 1,600 m in Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018). Chapman (1926) listed two females from ‘below San José’, presumably AMNH 179059–060 taken on 12–13 March 1923. These specimens might document a low-elevation occurrence but, because the precise elevation where they were taken is uncertain, we do not regard the record as documenting an elevational range extension. We did not encounter the species during our field work.\n\nRUFOUS-VENTED WHITETIP Urosticte ruficrissa\n\nA mid-montane species (sensu Stotz et al. 1996) thought to range above 900 m in Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018) where considered Near Threatened (Freile et al. 2019). Chapman (1926) listed five males and two females from ‘below San José’. We located five of these in AMNH (179050–179052, 185064, 185066). We have several recent sight reports from c.950 m at RBBR.\n\nPINK-THROATED BRILLIANT Heliodoxa gularis\n\nEndemic to east Andean foothills. Considered Vulnerable in Ecuador and formerly globally by IUCN (2016). Rare, local, and poorly known in Ecuador with records from Sucumbíos, Orellana, Napo and Zamora-Chinchipe provinces (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Pitman et al. 2002, Freile et al. 2013). Described by Gould (1860) from ‘Río Napo’. Zimmer (1951) suggested the type locality be restricted to ‘San José, Ecuador’ but his basis is unclear, and there is no indication that the holotype is from the locality San José de Sumaco worked by Olalla & Hijos. Specimens (one male, and five females) from ‘below San José’ are mentioned in Chapman (1926). We located four of these in AMNH (179040–041, 185112–113). We found H. gularis to be fairly common and among the most frequently encountered hummingbirds in the forest interior (see also Freile et al. 2015). H. gularis was detected at 13 (42%) of 31 forest transect points. An adult was photographed on a nest on 8 January 2020 (Fig. 4) and a nest with young was found on 8 November 2017 (G. M. Kirwan et al. pers. obs.).\n\nLITTLE WOODSTAR Chaetocercus bombus\n\nRare and poorly known. Considered Near Threatened by IUCN (2023) and Vulnerable in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019). Most Ecuadorian records are from the Pacific slope, but it is known also from the east slope foothills of Morona-Santiago and Zamora-Chinchipe provinces in southern Ecuador (Chapman 1926, Collar et al. 1992, Janni 2004). Chapman (1926) mentioned two female specimens in AMNH from ‘below San José’, documenting occurrence on the east slope north to the Volcán Sumaco region (see Zimmer 1953, Ridgely & Greenfield 2001) but there have been no reports from the area since. We located just one female at AMNH (179065). The label reads ‘below San José de Sumarco [sic]. E. Ecuador. Tropical Zone’ Date: Mch. 16, 1923. On the reverse is ‘Olalla & Sons’. The original collectors tag reads ‘16 Marzo 1923 H.P. [= hembra pequeño indicating a female with small ovaries] S. José abajo. Olalla y Hijos Ecuador’. Although this specimen shows a few rufous feathers on the rump, it agrees with other female specimens of C. bombus at AMNH (n = 11) and differs from those of Gorgeted Woodstar C. heliodor cleavsi (n = 6) in its narrower-based bill, straighter (less decurved) culmen, and more extensive black on the rectrices (Fig. 4).\n\nNAPO SABREWING Campylopterus villaviscensio\n\nConfined to east Andean foothills and considered Near Threatened (IUCN 2023, Freile et al. 2019). Five specimens from ‘below San José’ (AMNH 179015–016, 185132–133, 185135) were mentioned by Chapman (1926). We encountered the species regularly and obtained photographs (Fig. 4). C. villaviscensio was detected at three (10 %) of 31 forest-interior transect points and we consider it uncommon.\n\nGREY-WINGED TRUMPETER Psophia crepitans\n\nConsidered Near Threatened in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019) where known mainly from below 700 m (Freile & Restall 2018) but P. crepitans was the most frequently recorded species in camera-trap photographs (c.950 m), accounting for 1,085 (65%) of 1,669 independent events and typically was recorded in large groups. Together, a set of large-bodied terrestrial species comprising Great Tinamou Tinamus major, P. crepitans, Salvin's Curassow Mitu salvini and Nocturnal Curassow Nothocrax urumutum, accounted for 1,376 (82%) of the total 1,669 events (Table 1).\n\nRED-WINGED WOOD RAIL Aramides calopterus\n\nRare, poorly known and considered Near Threatened in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019), but with a concentration of historical specimens (Chapman 1926, Norton 1965) and recent records in the Volcán Sumaco region of Napo and Orellana provinces (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Vaca et al. 2006). Four specimens in AMNH 178884–885, 185353, 185255) are labelled ‘San José Abajo’ and ‘San José de Sumarco’ [sic]. We encountered the species sporadically at c.950 m and obtained sound-recordings, camera-trap photographs (Fig. 3) and video.\n\nGREY-COWLED WOOD RAIL Aramides cajaneus\n\nWidespread in South America's lowlands. In Ecuador, known mainly from below 400 m (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018). FE observed one at close range on 12 January 2016 at c.950 m in tall forest near the BRBR Research Station. The all-grey neck and rufous breast were clearly visible. Another was reportedly heard in the same area on 28 November 2021 (H. Jacob).\n\nCRESTED EAGLE Morphnus gujanensis\n\nRare. Considered Near Threatened by IUCN (2023) and Vulnerable in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019). In eastern Ecuador, generally confined to lowlands below 300 m (Freile & Restall 2018). A female at AMNH (178949) was taken on 23 March 1923 by Olalla & Hijos and was listed by Chapman (1926) with locality ‘below San José’ (hence, the precise elevation is uncertain).\n\nHARPY EAGLE Harpia harpyja\n\nRare, considered Vulnerable (IUCN 2023), and generally confined to elevations below 400 m. An adult was videotaped at c.950 m near the BRBR on 25 August 2019 (L. Navarrete in litt. 2022).\n\nSEMICOLLARED HAWK Microspizias collaris\n\nRare and poorly known (Bierregaard et al. 2022). Considered Near Threatened in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019) where reported at 1,500–2,200 m (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001) but has been recorded as low as 600 m in Colombia (Hilty & Brown 1986). Included here based on a sight record: ACV studied a single bird through a telescope as it perched motionless in the open crown of an emergent tree at the BRBR Research Station on 12 January 2019 at c.950 m. Coarse barring on the underparts, dark ear-coverts, and a pale collar were clearly visible.\n\nSOLITARY EAGLE Buteogallus solitarius\n\nRare and local throughout its vast range and considered Near Threatened (IUCN 2023). Reported from several sites in the east Andean foothills of adjacent Napo province (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001) but regarded as Critically Endangered in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019). We photographed and obtained sound-recordings of an adult on 20 August 2018 on a steep ridge above the río Bigal c.5 km north of the BRBR Research Station (Fig. 3). One was heard calling at the same site on 9 January 2020.\n\nRUFESCENT SCREECH OWL Megascops ingens\n\nWidespread in the subtropical Andes, but poorly known (Freile & Castro 2013). In Ecuador thought to range from 1,200 to 2,400 m (Freile & Restall 2018). One was documented by a sound-recording near the BRBR at c.950 m on 18 September 2021 (P. Baruah; XC676460).\n\nSUBTROPICAL PYGMY OWL Glaucidium parkeri\n\nEndemic to the East Andes. Relatively recently described (Robbins & Howell 1995) and poorly known (Freile & Castro 2013, Acevedo-Charry et al. 2015). Most Ecuadorian records are from above 1,100 m (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018). One was sound-recorded near the BRBR Research Station at c.950 m on 28 July 2021 (C. Fischer).\n\nORANGE-BREASTED FALCON Falco deiroleucus\n\nRare and local. Considered Near Threatened by IUCN (2023) and Endangered in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019). There have been occasional reports from San José de Sumaco. One was photographed on 21 January 2023 (Fig. 3).\n\nRED-AND-GREEN MACAW Ara chloropterus\n\nRare and local in east Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001) where known mainly from the lowlands below 500 m (Freile & Restall 2018) and considered Vulnerable (Freile et al. 2019). A female specimen was mentioned by Chapman (1926), presumably AMNH 178951 taken on 31 March 1923 ‘below San José’, but we could not locate the specimen. We photographed and obtained sound-recordings from a pair at c.950 m on 11 August 2019.\n\nFIERY-THROATED FRUITEATER Pipreola chlorolepidota\n\nEndemic to east Andean foothills where rare (Kirwan & Green 2011). Considered Vulnerable in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019) and formerly considered Near Threatened by IUCN (2016). Five specimens from ‘below San José’ were mentioned by Chapman (1926). We located just one, a male (183718) at AMNH. In our field work, we encountered the species regularly in small numbers, often with mixed-species flocks that included various canopy-inhabiting tanagers. We consider it uncommon.\n\nGREY-TAILED PIHA Snowornis subalaris\n\nEndemic to east Andean foothills and outlying ridges (Kirwan & Greene 2011). Considered Near Threatened in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019) and formerly globally by IUCN (2016). Chapman (1926) mentioned five specimens (AMNH 179616–617, 183735–736, 183835) from ‘below San José’. Common and readily detected by its loud vocalisations. We found S. subalaris at 21 (68%) of 31 forest-interior transect points.\n\nSHRIKE-LIKE COTINGA Laniisoma elegans\n\nRare and local in the east Andean foothills of Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Kirwan & Green 2011). Considered Near Threatened by IUCN (2023) and Vulnerable in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019). A female specimen in the Moore Laboratory of Zoology, Los Angeles (MLZ 33855) was taken ‘below San José’ by Carlos Olalla on 13 April 1927 (Fig. 5). We did not encounter the species and there seem to be no reports from San José de Sumaco.\n\nRÍO SUNO ANTWREN Myrmotherula sunensis\n\nDescribed by Chapman (1925) from nearby ‘Río Suno below Avila’ (LeCroy & Sloss 2000); considered rare in Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001). The holotype is a female (AMNH 184582). A second female in AMNH (184583) taken ‘below San José’ was also mentioned by Chapman (1926). The widespread Slaty Antwren M. schisticolor has been considered an elevational replacement of this species (Whitney 1994) but the two are apparently syntopic at San José de Sumaco.\n\nSTRIATED ANTBIRD Drymophila devillei\n\nWidespread and common in south-west Amazonia (Ridgely & Tudor 2009) but rare and local in Colombia, and in Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018), where considered Endangered (Freile et al. 2019). D. devillei is documented in Ecuador by a small number of specimens including five taken by Olalla & Hijos in present-day western Orellana province. Two of these are from ‘Río Suno, above Avila’ (AMNH 179319–320; Chapman 1926) with three from ‘San José Abajo’ (AMNH 184460–462) taken on 30–31 March and 1 April 1924. There are also recent reports from Avila (Fig. 1) and near Archidona in neighbouring Napo province (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001; eBird). An obligate bamboo specialist (Kratter 1997, Parker et al. 1997), we found small numbers of D. devillei in a large stand of Guadua angustifolia bamboo at c.950 m and obtained sound-recordings and photographs (Fig. 5). In Ecuador, previously known at 300–750 m (Freile & Restall 2018). Our records confirm the presence of the species at the site of the earliest Ecuadorian records (Chapman 1926) and extend the local elevational range to 950 m.\n\nBLACKISH ANTBIRD Cercomacroides nigrescens\n\nChapman (1926) treated foothill populations of C. nigrescens as C. n. approximans and did not list San José de Sumaco (or any of its variant) for the species although he mentioned two males and two females taken by Olalla & Hijos at ‘Lower Sumaco’. Shortly after, Zimmer (1931) described C. n. aequatorialis, designating a female from that series taken on 9 January 1926 as the holotype (AMNH 184517). The allied lowland form C. fuscicauda described by Zimmer (1931), now treated as a separate species, Riparian Antbird, following Mayer et al. (2014), is not known from San José de Sumaco. Identification difficulties and a paucity of comparative material in museums has impeded understanding of the distributions of these forms. Two female specimens in MLZ (7639, 7688) were registered as Dusky Antbird C. tyrannina, later identified as C. fuscicauda (R. Terrill in litt. 2022), but from photographs they appear to be Black Antbird C. serva. A male (USNM 323078) taken by Olalla & Hijos on 20 April 1924, at ‘Abajo, San José’, was received by USNM in exchange from AMNH in 1930 and catalogued as ‘Cercomacra serva’. The USNM label bears the notation ‘Cercomacra nigricans A.W.’ (= Alexander Wetmore) but this determination is puzzling in view of the bird’s uniform dark tail and is perhaps best explained as a lapsus for Cercomacra (now Cercomacroides) nigrescens. We found C. nigrescens infrequently and regard it as rare at San José de Sumaco where it is presumably represented by Zimmer’s aequatorialis.\n\nSLENDER-BILLED XENOPS Xenops tenuirostris\n\nRare and poorly known in eastern Ecuador, where reported mainly below 600 m (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018) but ranges at least locally to c.1,000 m (Freile et al. 2022). One was photographed at c.950 m as it foraged with a mixed-species flock on 28 July 2021 at RBBR. The similar Streaked Xenops X. rutilans is expected at this elevation, and has been reported from the area but without voucher.\n\nRUFOUS-TAILED FOLIAGE-GLEANER Anabacerthia ruficaudata\n\nConsidered rare and local in Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018). Chapman (1926) mentioned five specimens from ‘below San José’, of which we located three in New York (AMNH 184267, 184269, 184270). We encountered the species regularly in small numbers at c.950 m and obtained photographs and sound-recordings. A. ruficaudata was typically found with canopy mixed-species flocks including various tanagers. We consider it an uncommon resident.\n\nBROWN-RUMPED FOLIAGE-GLEANER Automolus melanopezus\n\nRare in east Ecuador, mainly in Napo and Sucumbíos provinces at elevations below 600 m (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001). Considered a bamboo specialist in Peru (Parker 1982). A specimen in the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh (CM 142784) was taken by Carlos Olalla on 10 April 1927 at ‘San José Nuevo’. Chapman (1926) mentioned four males and a female from ‘below San José’. We found three specimens in AMNH (184287–288, 184290). There are occasional sight reports and one was photographed on 11 February 2023 at c.950 m at San José de Sumaco.\n\nECUADORIAN TYRANNULET Phylloscartes gualaquizae\n\nEndemic to the east Andean foothills and considered Near Threatened (Freile et al. 2019, IUCN 2023). Not listed for the site by Chapman (1926), but there is a specimen in AMNH (184000) annotated ‘Pogonotriccus orbitalis’, taken on 19 April 1924 by Olalla & Hijos at ‘San José abajo’. We encountered the species regularly with mixed-species flocks and consider it fairly common at San José de Sumaco.\n\nCINNAMON MANAKIN-TYRANT Neopipo cinnamomea\n\nRare in western Amazonia (Ridgely & Tudor 2009). In Ecuador, known mainly from below 400 m, but recently reported at c.1,000 m in Morona-Santiago province (Pozo-Zamora et al. 2022). We encountered solitary individuals in forest understorey at c.950 m and regard the species as rare at San José de Sumaco. One was photographed by FE on 25 August 2017.\n\nACADIAN FLYCATCHER Empidonax virescens\n\nA boreal migrant (Ridgely & Tudor 2009). In Ecuador, known mainly from the Pacific slope (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018). We found one in a large stand of Guadua bamboo on 13 January 2020 and obtained a sound-recording and photographs (Fig. 6).\n\nRUFOUS-NAPED GREENLET Pachysylvia semibrunnea\n\nEndemic to the north Andean foothills. In Ecuador, known mainly from the Volcán Sumaco region (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001) and considered Near Threatened (Freile et al. 2019). Now considered monotypic, but the type locality of P. s. leucogastra is ‘below San José de Sumaco’ (Chapman 1924). P. semibrunnea was detected at ten (32%) of 31 forest-interior transect points and we encountered the species regularly with mixed-species canopy flocks. We consider it fairly common.\n\nRED-CRESTED FINCH Coryphospingus cucullatus\n\nFormerly known in Ecuador only from Zamora-Chinchipe and Morona-Santiago provinces (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile et al. 2013, Freile & Restall 2018) and generally associated with arid scrub. Rapidly expanding north with deforestation, and recently reported in adjacent southern Colombia for the first time (Delgado & Rodríguez 2018). A male was photographed on 17 January 2020 in a cattle pasture at c.800 m (Fig. 5) and another was photographed there on 6 February 2023. We regard it as very rare.\n\nSLATE-COLOURED SEEDEATER Sporophila schistacea\n\nA bamboo specialist that is perhaps nomadic (Willis & Eisenmann 1979). Rare in east Ecuador (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001). We obtained photographs and sound-recordings of several singing birds in the canopy of an extensive stand of Guadua angustifolia at c.950 m on 8, 11 and 15 January 2020, and on 8 December 2020, including yellow-billed, greyplumaged, adult males (Fig. 5).\n\nCERULEAN WARBLER Setophaga cerulea\n\nA scarce boreal migrant. Considered Near Threatened by IUCN (2023) and Vulnerable in Ecuador (Freile et al. 2019). Chapman (1926) mentioned specimens from ‘below San José’ (AMNH 183542, 183544). We know of only a small number of sight records, all in December–January, and we suspect that our survey area at c.950 m is slightly below the main wintering elevational range (Colorado et al. 2012). We regard the species as a rare winter resident at San José de Sumaco.\n\nCASQUED CACIQUE Cacicus oseryi\n\nEndemic to western Amazonia (Ridgely & Tudor 2009). Rare in Ecuador, where known mainly from below 300 m (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001). A male (CM 102665) was taken on 30 March 1923 by Olalla & Hijos at ‘San José abajo’. While this is from the period when these collectors were working for Chapman, and the specimen bears an AMNH label, Chapman (1926) did not list San José (or variants) in his monograph, but he listed five males taken in adjacent lowlands at ‘Río Suno’. A second skin (MLZ 3802) was taken 2 April 1927 at ‘San José Nuevo abajo’ by Carlos Olalla. We did not encounter the species.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHistorical collections and the locality San José de Sumaco.—In 1923–24, the firm Olalla & Hijos (Fig. 2), professional collectors then under contract to Frank M. Chapman at AMNH, worked at a series of collecting stations along an elevational transect on the east slope of Volcán Sumaco. Their foothill station, San José de Sumaco, was worked principally during 2–31 March 1923 and 12 March–29 April 1924 (Chapman 1926, Paynter 1993, LeCroy & Sloss 2000, Wiley 2010). The resulting collections include at least 213 specimens taken in 1923 and 746 specimens in 1924. Much of this material is referenced, albeit without collection registration numbers, in Chapman (1926), and most is at AMNH. This material includes the holotypes of at least six taxa including Leucopternis princeps zimmeri Friedmann, 1935, Megascops guatemalae napensis (Chapman, 1928), Dysithamnus mentalis napensis Chapman 1925, Myrmothera campanisona signata J. T. Zimmer, 1934, Pachysylvia semibrunnea leucogastra Chapman, 1924, and Microbates cinereiventris hormotus Olson, 1980.\n\nIn the following years (1927–35), while Alfonso & Ramón Olalla worked in Peru and Brazil, Carlos Olalla remained in Ecuador (Wiley 2010) and returned to collect on the lower slopes of Volcán Sumaco during 1–18 April 1927, 1–27 January 1929, 13–25 August 1929, 9 July–28 August 1932, 18–25 September 1932, 10–20 March 1933 and 11–12 August 1935. This later material (1927–35), numbering >400 specimens, is held mainly at MLZ and appears never to have been published. Unlike the 1923–24 material, museum database registrations for specimens taken during 1927–35 appear to be incomplete and additional specimens taken in the area by Carlos Olalla are likely to be held elsewhere.\n\nChapman (1926) did not have coordinates or an elevation for San José de Sumaco and admitted some ambiguity by noting ‘the site of the town is shifted in response to the need for fresh ground for crops, the present San José being apparently lower than the preceding one (San José Viejo)' but added that ‘it should be understood that all American Museum specimens recorded from ‘San José' or ‘below San José’ are from or near San José de Sumaco’. Because Chapman did not explicitly address the locality name ‘San José Nuevo’ vs. ‘San José de Sumaco’, the precise geographic origin of specimens bearing that locality is somewhat less certain. Some with the locality ‘San José Nuevo’ may have been taken at elevations below those areas that we surveyed most intensively. Paynter’s (1993) coordinates locate San José Nuevo in the lowlands c.10 km north-east of San José Viejo (Fig. 1), whereas a hand-drawn map, prepared by W. T. Atyeo in the archives of the Dept. of Ornithology at AMNH, locates San José Nuevo in the foothills west of that position. See Fig. 1 for the present-day names of these communities and their geographic positions according to Paynter (1993). The collector’s translated itinerary in the archives of the Dept. of Ornithology at AMNH (LeCroy & Sloss 2000) records the field parties, in both 1923 and 1924, collecting at Avila (Fig. 1) then moving north, paralleling the río Suno, following the east (left) bank to reach San José de Sumaco (= San José Viejo in Paynter 1993), before turning west to ascend the volcano. Review of the itinerary followed by Carlos Olalla using collection database records suggests he followed a similar route in later years, approaching the area from either Avila or Concepción in the south. We conclude that the Olalla & Hijos collecting station ‘San José’ (and variants) is best understood as the interfluvial of the ríos Suno and Bigal, from elevations of c.1,000 m (where the two rivers approach most closely) extending several km north-east and south across a fan-shaped area of c.200 km2 on the eastern flank of Volcán Sumaco to at least 500 m, but possibly as low as 400 m (Fig. 1). The upper elevation portion of this area includes the present-day RBBR Research Station and our survey transects (Fig. 1).\n\nThe common place name ‘San José’ has invited some confusion in the literature and in museum database registrations involving Olalla collecting stations on Volcán Sumaco, certain localities on the upper Pacific slope in Pichincha province (e.g., ‘Cerro San José’), and on the east slope in Morona-Santiago province (‘San José’ and ‘Río San José’). Paynter (1993), for example, listed the locality ‘San José, Ecuador’ worked by Enrico Festa in 1896 (Salvadori & Festa 1899, 1900) as ‘unlocated’, and considered it to be ‘presumably in the vicinity of Río Suno’, and ‘probably San José Nuevo’, but the itinerary for Festa given by Chapman (1926) makes clear that it is correctly traced to Morona-Santiago province in southern Ecuador.\n\nNoteworthy elevational records.—We report high-elevation records for 80 species, and low-elevation records for nine species (Appendix 1). We define noteworthy elevational records as recent observations at c.950 m at RBBR that are outside the elevational ranges given in standard references for Ecuadorian birds (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018) although, in several cases, comparable records have recently been reported from foothill sites on outlying Andean ridges in southern Ecuador (e.g., Solano-Ugalde & Real-Jibaja 2010, Freile et al. 2014, 2022, Pozo-Zamora et al. 2022). We do not include 19 species documented only by specimens because the precise elevation at which they were taken is uncertain and some may have been taken as low as 500 m (e.g., Brown Nunlet Nonnula brunnea, Chestnut-belted Gnateater Conopophaga aurita, Banded Antbird Dichrozona cincta). In a few cases, we found temperate zone species (e.g., Blue-and-back Tanager Tangara vassorii, Black-capped Tanager Stilpnia heinei) at c.950 m during periods of cold, wet weather. Other cases of presumed elevational movement in species that are generally distributed at higher elevations include a Spectacled Whitestart Myioborus melanocephalus photographed near c.950 m (Fig. 5), sight records of White-tailed Hillstar Urochroa bougueri, and specimens of Long-tailed Sylph Aglaiocercus kingii and White-booted Racket-tail Ocreatus underwoodii (Appendix 1). These low-elevation records all refer to canopy or edge-inhabiting, frugivores or nectivores that may undertake facultative elevational movements in response to weather conditions (Levey & Stiles 1992, Boyle et al. 2010). Thirty-four records concern lowland species found 400 m or more above their published elevational ranges for Ecuador in standard references (Ridgely & Greenfield 2001, Freile & Restall 2018). In contrast to the low-elevation records (involving relatively vagile species) many of these high-elevation records (n = 80) involve sedentary, forest-interior species (e.g., Striated Antthrush Chamaeza nobilis, Black-tailed Leaftosser Sclerurus caudacutus, Cinereous Mourner Laniocera hypopyrra) that we detected regularly and that we assume are breeding residents. Of these 80 high-elevation records, all pertain to species not represented in the Olalla collections from a century ago and are consistent with a pattern of upward elevational range shifts in montane forest birds also reported at other re-surveyed sites in the East Andes and attributed to climate change (Freeman et al. 2018, Neate-Clegg et al. 2021).\n\nBamboo specialists.—Bamboo specialisation in Amazonian birds was first described and is best known from south-west Amazonia, especially southern Peru (Kratter 1997, Parker et al. 1997), but is also a feature of bird communities in north-west Amazonia, where stands of Guadua bamboo are less common and tend to be smaller. We regularly detected three obligate or near-obligate bamboo specialists (sensu Kratter 1997; Large-headed Flatbill Ramphotrigon megacephalum, Black-and-white Tody-Flycatcher Poecilotriccus capitalis and Striated Antbird Drymophila devillei). The first two species were present in most stands of bamboo, including smaller areas and those near or adjacent to forest edge, whilst Drymophila devillei was found only in the largest stand covering >20 ha. Most bamboo specialists recorded are insectivores, but two granivores, Slate-coloured Seedeater Sporophila schistacea and Slaty Finch Haplospiza rustica, were also documented. The occurrence of the former appeared to be unrelated to the availability of a Guadua angustifolia seed crop, and we did not witness seeding (‘masting’) bamboo, nor did we see evidence of mass die-off during our survey. A single specimen of Slaty Finch from San José de Sumaco (AMNH 179715) may represent an unusually low occurrence but the precise elevation where the specimen was taken is uncertain. In addition to these specialists, some globally widespread species such as Scale-crested Pygmy Tyrant Lophotriccus pileatus and Ornate Antwren Epinecrophylla ornata are locally associated with, or perhaps confined to, Guadua angustifolia bamboo stands at San José de Sumaco.\n\nHistorical change.—We describe a forest avifauna generally similar to that documented by the Olallas a century ago (Appendix 1) although we note that large-bodied species (e.g., Mitu salvini, Nothocrax urumutum), now recorded frequently by camera traps, are not represented in the Olalla collections. Non-forest bird communities have undergone more profound changes with the recent creation of large clearings planted with nonnative grasses (pasture). In some cases, noteworthy elevational records (Appendix 1) involve non-forest species that are probably expanding upslope with deforestation (e.g., Ruddy Ground Dove Columbina talpacoti, Yellow-headed Caracara Milvago chimachima). Whilst the Olalla collections include some species typical of forest edge, small clearings and successional habitats (e.g., Great Antshrike Taraba major, Bluish-grey Saltator Saltator coerulescens, Orange-backed Troupial Icterus croconotus, Yellow-rumped Cacique Cacicus cela), none of the grassland species now common in non-forest areas at San José de Sumaco are represented (e.g., Yellow-browed Sparrow Ammodramus aurifrons, Blue-black Grassquit Volatinia jacarina and various Sporophila). Scant information is available to characterise ecological conditions during the time of the Olallas field work at San José de Sumaco, but a contemporaneous account by the adventurer G. M. Dyott (1929) suggests the area was then at least thinly populated. We assume that the area then consisted of a matrix of tall humid forest, secondary forest and some shifting cultivation as Chapman's remarks suggest (1926; see above). Twenty-two species represented in the Olalla collections were not confirmed during our field work, and we are not aware of any documented records from the area (Appendix 1). These species may no longer occur, may be locally rare, or may have been taken at (and are perhaps locally confined to) elevations below the areas we surveyed most intensively at c.950 m.\n\nSpecies richness.—Freile et al. (2015) reported 460 species from BRBR but did not include a full list. White & Patiño (2018) reported 340 species at San José de Payamino in the nearby lowlands (Fig. 1). This study increases the number of species documented from San José de Sumaco by 202 over the total of 275 listed by Chapman (1926). The resulting total of 477 species includes 425 ‘core’ tall-forest species (Appendix 1). Whilst variation in methods, spatial extent and period of study preclude rigorous comparison (Remsen 1994, Lees et al. 2014, Robinson et al. 2018) the apparent richness of the San José de Sumaco avifauna remains notable because the site is relatively restricted in area, is dominated by a single major natural vegetation type (upland terra firme forest) and lacks the major aquatic habitats and riparian forest types (e.g., várzea) that have ‘inflated’ estimates of diversity at Amazonian lowland sites (Stotz et al. 1996, Lees et al. 2013).\n\nLocal and global rarity.—Rarity presents a methodological impediment to survey effort but is also a general feature of tropical forest avian communities (Wallace 1878, Thiollay 1994, Jankowski & Rabenold 2007). A sample of 280 twenty-species ‘MacKinnon lists’ (Fig. 8; see Methods) captured just 73% (n = 347 species) of the total known species richness (n = 477 species, Appendix 1) and we consider more than half of the 477 documented species to be locally rare or very rare, with 110 species (22%) known from three or fewer reports. A generally positive relationship between abundance and geographic area suggests rare species are especially vulnerable to extirpation (Kattan 1992, Gaston & Blackburn 2000). Against this general pattern we note that several species recognised by Stattersfield et al. (1998) as East Andes of Ecuador endemics, and at least formerly considered Vulnerable or Near Threatened based on their restricted ranges (IUCN 2016, 2023), are among the more commonly detected species of forest interior at San José de Sumaco (e.g., Ecuadorian Piedtail Phlogophilus hemileucurus, Pink-throated Brilliant Heliodoxa gularis and Phylloscartes gualaquizae).\n\nEndemism and biogeography.—Patterns of endemism are of interest to both conservationists and biogeographers and several general features of the San José de Sumaco assemblage are noteworthy in this respect. First, analyses of the distribution of restricted-range species reveal a global concentration at the Andean / Amazonian interface (Orme et al. 2005, Herzog & Kattan 2011, Fjeldså 2012), a pattern that invites explanation as the outcome of historical processes and identifies the region as a logical priority for conservation or a ‘hotspot’.\n\nSecond, the site lies near the western margin of the North Amazon (Napo) area (Haffer 1974, Cracraft 1985), and among the range-restricted taxa present are both Napo endemic forms with sister species confined to the adjacent lowland Inambari area (e.g., Fulvous Antshrike Frederickena fulva, Dusky Spinetail Synallaxis moesta, Golden-winged Tody-Flycatcher Poecilotriccus calopterus), and East Andean endemic taxa with sister lineages in foothill and highland areas outside Amazonia including the Pacific slope (e.g., Heliodoxa gularis, Orange-eared Tanager Chlorochrysa calliparaea, Pipreola chlorolepidota; Stattersfield et al. 1998, Hazzi et al. 2018). Sympatry in taxa representative of distantly related Andean and Amazonian centres of endemism indicates a compound history (Haffer 1974, Cracraft 1985, Stattersfield et al. 1998, Hazzi et al. 2018) and this is consistent with studies elsewhere in the East Andean foothills that have reported low phylogenetic similarity between assemblages at 900 and 1,200 m (Dehling et al. 2014), a pattern marking the interface between older Amazonian and younger Andean biota (Weir 2006, Fjeldså & Irestedt 2009).\n\nThird, whilst the San José de Sumaco avifauna is dominated by widespread Lower tropical species, it also includes a set of range-restricted Hill tropical or Upper tropical species (sensu Stotz et al. 1996; Fig. 7) that are confined to a narrow elevational band below the distribution of subtropical (‘cloud’) forests (e.g., Heliodoxa gularis, Pipreola chlorolepidota, Phyllomyias gualaquizae) and at least formerly considered Vulnerable or Near Threatened (IUCN 2016, 2023). The congruent foothill distributions of these taxa, each arisen from a widespread Andean clade, form a nested area within the greater East Andes area of endemism and suggest that while relationship patterns among the broad, disjunct Amazonian areas are relatively well studied, both discovery and relationships among areas in the tropical Andes remain poorly resolved and additional subcentres (nested areas) are likely to be recognised as more distributional data, taxonomic revisions and fine-scale regionalisation become available.\n\nFinally, the San José de Sumaco avifauna includes taxa thought to have relatively extensive distributions in foothills, but considered rare (e.g., Cypseloides lemosi, Snowornis subalaris and Plain-backed Antpitta Grallaria haplonota), with some exhibiting circum-Amazonian distributions (e.g., Tinamus tao, Laniisoma elegans and Synallaxis moesta), as well as forest-dependent lowland species, in some cases with distributions reaching trans-Andean regions, but always at low densities (e.g., Buteogallus solitarius, Neomorphus geoffroyi, Nyctibius aethereus). While considered widespread, such taxa deserve attention from biogeographers and conservationists alike.\n\nConservation.—Long-term studies of tropical forest bird communities have demonstrated losses of functional and taxonomic diversity in both disturbed (Palacio et al. 2019, Gómez et al. 2021, Luther et al. 2022) and undisturbed landscapes (Blake & Loiselle 2015), but the forest avifauna we describe appears largely intact, suggesting the area still presents a valuable opportunity for conservation. For example, large-bodied, terrestrial species sensitive to local extirpation from hunting pressure (Peres 2001) including Psophia crepitans, Mitu salvini and Nothocrax urumutum are regularly recorded by camera-traps (Table 1). Neotropical forest understorey species often decline following disturbance (Laurance et al. 2011, Palacio et al. 2019), including ground insectivores and obligate ant-following species, but are regularly observed at San José de Sumaco. Large raptors typically confined to extensive undisturbed areas including Buteogallus solitarius, Ornate Hawk-Eagle Spizaetus ornatus, Morphnus gujanensis and Harpia harpyja are present, and the regular occurrence of 16 species of boreal migrants, notably including the Near Threatened Contopus cooperi and Setophaga cerulea (IUCN 2023) further underscore the area's value for conservation. Twenty-two species known only from historical specimens (Appendix 1) have diverse ecologies and do not appear likely to have declined locally because of anthropogenic change. Under current IUCN treatments (2023), the San José de Sumaco avifauna includes 15 species classified as Near Threatened and seven as Vulnerable (2023; Appendix 1). We regard five of the combined 22 Near Threatened and Vulnerable species as common, fairly common or uncommon at San José de Sumaco. At the national level, the Ecuadorian Red List (Freile et al. 2019) treats one species as Critical (Buteogallus solitarius), three as Endangered (Falco deiroleucus, Military Macaw Ara militaris, Drymophila devillei), 26 as Near Threatened and 11 as Vulnerable.\n\nFollowing the construction of the Archidona to Loreto road the larger Sumaco region has undergone intensive deforestation and agricultural expansion (Sierra 2000). Pastures and other degraded anthropogenic landscapes now extend along a network of new roads stretching north from the paved highway connecting the cities of Loreto and Coca (Fig. 1). Whilst subtropical forests at higher elevations on Volcán Sumaco are protected in PNSNG and are thought to remain largely pristine, the lower eastern slopes have been approached from the south by an expanding agricultural frontier, and deforestation now threatens to sever the corridor that currently connects the subtropical forests of PNSNG and the lowland forests of San José de Payamino. Ecotonal areas (i.e., gradients of temperature or moisture) may be especially sensitive to synergistic effects of climate change and deforestation (Linck et al. 2021), but also offer valuable opportunities for conservation as even small additions to protected areas in regions with high beta diversity (i.e., mountain slopes) can be expected to incorporate many new species including range-restricted taxa and narrowly adapted local populations (Bush 2002, Jankowski et al. 2009). Irrespective of this, efforts to protect the remaining forests of San José de Sumaco from human disturbance and secure a biological corridor are already warranted because local extinctions and biodiversity erosion driven by the cascading effects of fragmentation are now well documented in Neotropical forests (Lees & Peres 2006, Laurance et al. 2011). While the East Andes and Amazonia have been found to rank below critically threatened regions of the Pacific slope in national-scale prioritisation schemes (Sierra et al. 2002, Cuesta et al. 2017), the Sumaco region still emerges as a priority for biodiversity conservation when feasibility is included as a criterion (Lessmann et al. 2014)."
