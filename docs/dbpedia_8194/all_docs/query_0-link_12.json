        "text": "Creation Justice Ministries (CJM) is a nonprofit organization that represents the creation care and environmental justice policies of major Christian denominations and communities across the country. Avery Davis Lamb, Master of Theological Studies and Master of Environmental Management (Nicholas School of the Environment) ‚Äô22, is the co-executive director of CJM, an organization that works in cooperation with 38 national faith bodies to protect and restore God's creation. This vast reach encompasses multiple ecosystems, which means people are affected by the climate crisis in different ways, says Lamb. ‚ÄúWhether floods, fires, droughts, or anything else from the litany of climate impacts, churches and communities are seeing the effects of a warmer world. In turn, many communities are rethinking their mission in the light of these impacts.‚Äù Creation Justice Ministries seeks to help churches consider how they can be hubs of resilience in their communities during the physical, social, and spiritual storms of the climate crisis. Says Lamb, ‚ÄúIn many communities, churches can be key sites of resilience, but it requires the church to look closely at how climate change is impacting and will impact their surroundings, and consider how they can use their physical, social, and spiritual assets to address those impacts.‚Äù Read more about Lamb and other Duke Divinity alumni working at the intersection of faith and creation care ‚û°Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/gf3KxXCb #DukeDivinity #DukeDivinityAlumni #DukeDivinitySchool #CreationCare #DukeClimateCommittment\n\nLast night I was watching video of Australia's sheep shearer and rural worker union. There was an interesting clip on introduction of differing technologies (a wider buzz comb). It provided me a lot to think about, and I will bet the underlying concept is a major one throughout history. For a long time in California unfair business laws kept our society in-check quite well, the advent of technology, akin to the comb problem, produced different outcomes as well. I also don't doubt our societies can find the coalescences between Au's Santos and US' Monsanto. Some concepts to consider, though: Australian sheep shearing looks fair cruelty. It's not, though. (Both sheep shearing and sporting kangaroo were youtube videos I Was able to view, but are no longer available. I am presuming the idealistic vegan- friendly bandwagon hopped on kicking that out of global observance). Usually, the shearer sustains more cruelty and permanent injury than the sheep (Broken bones and blunt force trauma including head trauma vs strained ligaments and knicks) ...I have said before that head trauma begets head trauma. Between scar tissue&muscular pressure, capillary burst, and blood vessel constriction or expansion, and more, elevated biological distress from prior injury often can lead to expounding emotional expression. Anyway, relief is difficult to seek. I was referred to Alpha GPC, an acetylcholine, a food supplement, as viable intervention to the physical, biologic repercussions. I was also told turmeric, but received opposite relief. It is plausible, even if not likely, that producing one's own research could yield the individual specific results, but that might be another undiscovered wide tooth comb. ... wry\n\nThere is still time ‚è≥ to celebrate üéâ #HispanicHeritageMonth by reading a great book üìñ about the Hispanic American experience. Check out üëÄ this week's Fable recommendation ‚è¨ On September 9, 1921, a tropical depression stalled just north of San Antonio and within hours overwhelmed its winding network of creeks and rivers. Floodwaters ripped through the city‚Äôs Latino West Side neighborhoods, killing more than eighty people. Meanwhile a wall of water crashed into the central business district on the city‚Äôs North Side, wreaking considerable damage. The city‚Äôs response to this disaster shaped its environmental policies for the next fifty years, carving new channels of power. Decisions about which communities would be rehabilitated and how thoroughly were made in the political arena, where the Anglo elite largely ignored the interlocking problems on the impoverished West Side that flowed from poor drainage, bad housing, and inadequate sanitation. Instead the elite pushed for the $1.6 million construction of the Olmos Dam, whose creation depended on a skewed distribution of public benefits in one of America‚Äôs poorest big cities. The discriminatory consequences, channeled along ethnic and class lines, continually resurfaced until the mid-1970s, when Communities Organized for Public Services, a West Side grassroots organization, launched a successful protest that brought much-needed flood control to often inundated neighborhoods. This upheaval, along with COPS‚Äôs emergence as a power broker, disrupted Anglo domination of the political landscape to more accurately reflect the city‚Äôs diverse population. \"West Side Rising\" is the first book focused squarely on San Antonio‚Äôs enduring relationship to floods, which have had severe consequences for its communities of color in particular. Examining environmental, social, and political histories, Char Miller demonstrates that disasters can expose systems of racism, injustice, and erasure and, over time, can impel activists to dismantle these inequities. He draws clear lines between the environmental injustices embedded in San Antonio‚Äôs long history and the emergence of grassroots organizations that combated the devastating impact floods could have on the West Side.
