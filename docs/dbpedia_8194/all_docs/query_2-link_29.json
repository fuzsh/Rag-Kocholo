        "text": "As we close #latinxheritagemonth check out this beautiful feature on the Red Sox Foundation's IG. English version: Tell us about yourself. My name is Lina Maria Cañon, I am from Bogotá, Colombia. I am currently the Associate Director at Chica Project and the Chief Operating Officer of The Nur Collective. Though I came from #Colombia to Massachusetts when I was 10 years old, I didn't really get to #Boston until I started my undergraduate journey at Suffolk University in 2009. What does your Hispanic Heritage mean to you? My hispanic heritage means being able to bring my full self, my playlist (from #BadBunny to #Ibeyi), my food (from #sancocho to #empanadas), my culture, my emotions, my chistes - everywhere I go, unapologetically so that authenticity rather than assimilation is the #goal. What does it mean to you to do your work in Boston? I've always told folks I'm an assimilated #Bostonian, a person who has found a place to call home (as any immigrant knows, everywhere and nowhere can be home). I have lived through the tragedies and triumphs that bind this city together, from breaking #thecurse, to #thebigthree, to the #BostonMarathon Bombings. Having Boston's identity inextricably linked with my own makes my work that much more important. Creating access to resource-restricted neighborhoods, amplifying the voices of the immigrant communities, bringing light to first-generation entrepreneurs, and being a representation of mujeres that have no limit to what they can do means everything to me. What does it mean to be Colombian in Boston? What don't I do in Boston?! This is a great question, aside from consistently advocating and amplifying the voices of mi gente, I sit at the intersection of #nonprofit and #business, trying to move forward sustainable practices for #socialimpact work through a multisector lense. I recently got my MBA at Questrom School of Business, Boston University and am a fellow at The Philanthropy Connection and Mendoza Ventures. I also sit on various boards from Suffolk's CAS Alumni Board to amazing organizations like Union Capital Boston, The Mauricio Gastón Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy and Fueling Justice Coalition. In my free time I volunteer with DotBikeKitchen fixing bikes at the Dorchester Art Project. (additional text not featured) Being Colombian in Boston and serving the youth/immigrant/WOC/first generation community is complex, joyful, and critical. From finding comfort in Eastie, where a sea of yellow takes over Maverick square cuando gana la seleccion to that same sea of yellow, blue and red taking over City Hall when advocacy needs to happen on an international level is fulfilling. Being able to meet folks from DR, Jamaica, China, Vietnam, Haiti and so many other places, and feel in community with them is wholesome. Being Colombian in Boston, while Boston recognizes the richness of its diversity, is finding true cross-cultural solidarity."
