        "text": "The Cambridge History of Latina/o American Literature emphasizes the importance of understanding Latina/o literature not simply as a U.S. ethnic phenomenon but more broadly as a trans-American tradition extending from the sixteenth century to the present. Engaging with the dynamics of transculturation, linguistic and cultural difference, and the uneven distribution of power across the Americas that characterize Latina/o literature, the essays in this History provide a critical overview of key texts, authors, themes, and contexts as discussed by leading scholars in the field. This book demonstrates the relevance of Latina/o literature for a world defined by legacies of coloniality, the imposition of militarized borders, and the transnational migration of people, commodities, and cultural practices.\n\nThis article presents certain Latin American traits from the works of four prestigious and contemporary Latin American writers: Gioconda Belli, Gonzalo Rojas, Augusto Monterroso y Juan Jos√© Arreola. The traits discussed include politics, the religious cult, the messianic vision, family, couples and the father figure. We argue that it is very important for people to understand their own culture and identity, to explore and not abandon the conversations about their countries' literary works, as they reflect, report and critique them."
