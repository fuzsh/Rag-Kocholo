        "meta_description": "Abstract. On a global scale, African dust is known to be one of the major\nsources of mineral dust particles, as these particles can be efficiently transported to\ndifferent parts of the planet. Several studies have suggested that the\nYucatÃ¡n Peninsula could be influenced by such particles, especially in July,\nassociated with the strengthening of the Caribbean low-level jet. Although\nthese particles have the potential to significantly impact the local air quality, as shown elsewhere (especially with respect to particulate matter, PM), the\narrival and impact of African dust in Mexican territory has not been\nquantitatively reported to date. Two short-term field campaigns were conducted to confirm the arrival of\nAfrican dust on the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula in July 2017 and July 2018 at the\nMÃ©rida atmospheric observatory (20.98ââN, 89.64ââW). Aerosol particles\nwere monitored at ground level using different online and off-line\nsensors. Several PM2.5 and PM10 peaks were observed during both\nsampling periods, with a relative increase in the PM levels ranging between\n200â% and 500â% with respect to the normal background conditions. Given that these\npeaks were found to be highly correlated with supermicron particles and\nchemical elements typically found in mineral dust particles, such as Al, Fe,\nSi, and K, they are linked with African dust. This conclusion is supported\nby combining back trajectories with vertical profiles from radiosondes,\nreanalysis, and satellite images to show that the origin of the air masses\narriving at MÃ©rida was the Saharan Air Layer (SAL). The good agreement found\nbetween the measured PM10 concentrations and the estimated dust mixing\nratio content from MERRA-2 (Version 2 of the Modern-Era Retrospective\nanalysis for Research and Applications) corroborates the conclusion that the\ndegradation of the local (and likely regional) air quality in MÃ©rida is a\nresult of the arrival of African dust.",

        "text": "The second largest natural contribution of atmospheric particles, worldwide, after sea spray, is mineral dust (Pey et al., 2013). Although volcanoes and soil dust from agricultural activities are significant sources of mineral dust (Walker, 1981; Tegen et al., 2004), the largest sources are the deserts that are distributed around the world (Goudie and Middleton, 2006). Africa is considered one of the most important of these sources as it emits ca.Â 800âTgâyrâ1, corresponding to ca.Â 70â% of the global dust (Prospero et al., 2014; Ryder et al., 2019). Therefore, African dust particles play a significant role in the climate system, as they can affect the planetary radiative balance and the hydrological cycle. Their optical properties, i.e.,Â scattering and absorption, modulate radiative forcing, and these particles also impact cloud formation and evolution as they can act as cloud condensation nuclei and/or ice-nucleating particles (Zhang et al., 2007; Hoose and MÃ¶hler, 2012; DeMott et al., 2015; Kanji et al. 2017). Additionally, several studies have shown that the presence of mineral dust can influence tropical cyclone formation (Dunion and Velden, 2004; Evan et al., 2006) and human health, as these particles degrade air quality (Carlson and Prospero, 1972; Prospero, 1999; Prospero et al., 2014; Venero-FernÃ¡ndez, 2016).\n\nAfrican dust particles are efficiently transported far from their emission source (Perry et al., 1997; Chiapello et al., 1997). According to Middleton and Goudie (2001), there are different trajectories that African dust experiences around the world. Among the most important, African dust particles can be transported to the western Mediterranean and Europe (Karanasiou et al., 2012; Perez et al., 2008; Prodi and Fea, 1979; Salvador et al., 2014), to the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East (Ganor and Mamane, 1982; Ganor et al., 2010; Athanasopoulou et al., 2016), and towards the southern African continent (d'Almeida, 1986; Resch et al., 2008). Additionally, African dust is transported across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean region, and South America (Prospero et al. 1981; Bravo et al., 1982; Perry et al., 1997; Chiapello et al., 1997; Prospero and Lamb, 2003; Venero-FernÃ¡ndez, 2016; Barkley et al., 2019; Kramer et al., 2020). The long-range transport of African dust over the Atlantic represents 25â% of the total emissions from the Saharan Desert (Shao et al., 2011). This transport is favored in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer (i.e., from June to September) within a dry and hot elevated layer called the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) (Carlson and Prospero, 1972; Prospero and Carlson, 1972; Karyampudi and Carlson, 1988; Tsamalis et al., 2013; Weinzierl et al., 2016).\n\nDuring the summer, the SAL ascends to altitudes between 5 and 7âkm through interactions with cool marine air masses (Adams et al., 2012; Chouza et al., 2016; Korte et al., 2018). Dunion and Velden (2004), Dunion and Marron (2008), and Dunion (2011) studied the characteristics of the air masses that reach the North Atlantic and the Caribbean region during the boreal summer months. They found that there are three distinct air masses: a moist tropical air mass (MT), the SAL, and midlatitude dry air intrusions (MLDAIs). Each type of air mass is associated with unique thermodynamic and kinematic characteristics, and they have a wide range of possible origins. However, the SAL and MLDAI air masses have distinct flow patterns across the North Atlantic, which allows one to differentiate between these masses by tracking their origin. In contrast, their distinctly unique moisture characteristics allow for the differentiation of the MT from SAL air masses (Dunion, 2011).\n\nThere are different methods for the detection of the long-range transport of African dust and its presence in different regions around the world. For several decades, the tracking of dust events has been studied using remote sensing (Chiapello et al., 1999; Dunion and Velden, 2004; Foltz and McPhaden, 2008; Prospero et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2008; Voss and Evan, 2020). Ground- and space-based tools such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and satellite sensors (e.g., the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, VIIRS) provide the aerosol spatial distribution with altitude in terms of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), mass concentration, and particle size distribution (Zhang and Reid, 2006; Jackson et al., 2013).\n\nAnother useful tool is the reanalysis from global climate models that assimilates, in a statistically optimal way, satellite and ground observations. The reanalysis produces continuous, four-dimensional fields of different atmospheric variables of interest, contrasting with the observations that may be spatially and temporally sparse (Cohn, 1997; Kalnay, 2003; Rienecker et al., 2011; Schutgens et al., 2010). The use of reanalysis, considering its inherent uncertainties, has become an essential tool in the atmospheric research community (Gelaro et al., 2017). For example, the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model has been successfully used to track the transport of African dust particles (e.g., Ashrafi et al., 2014; Prospero et al., 2005). HYSPLIT uses meteorological data from different modeling sources, including the NCEPâNCAR (National Centers for Environmental PredictionâNational Center for Atmospheric Research) reanalysis model (Stein et al., 2015).\n\nThe transport of African dust can also be evaluated with the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) MERRA-2 reanalysis (Prospero et al., 2020). MERRA-2 (Version 2 of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) is the first multidecadal reanalysis that assimilates both meteorological and aerosol data from various ground- and space-based remote sensing sources (Gelaro et al., 2017; Randles et al., 2017). Despite some deficiencies, previous studies have demonstrated that the MERRA-2 aerosol assimilation system does indeed show considerable skill in simulating numerous observable aerosol properties (e.g., Buchard et al., 2015, 2016, 2017; Randles et al., 2017). MERRA-2 has been previously used to study the effects of aerosol particles in the Earth system in several studies focused on dust-related phenomena. For example, Buchard et al.Â (2017) showed the benefit of the MERRA-2 assimilation for the retrieval of the seasonality, vertical distribution, and magnitude of the dust surface concentrations during an episode of dust transport from Africa to the Caribbean. Later on, Veselovskii et al.Â (2018) showed the consistency of the MERRA-2 aerosol products with MieâRaman lidar observations performed in West Africa during a smoke and dust mixing event. Similarly, Grogan and Thorncrof (2019) studied the characteristics of African easterly waves and their relationship with synoptic-scale plumes of Saharan mineral dust. More recently, Bibi et al.Â (2020) studied atmospheric dust load and deposition fluxes along the North African coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and Aldhaif et al.Â (2020) studied dust events impacting the East Coast of the United States.\n\nThe inÂ situ monitoring of aerosol properties, such as aerosol size and mass distribution, is very useful to determine their influence on local air quality and human health (Querol et al., 2019). Hence, different studies have been carried out in the Caribbean islands and Florida to quantify the impact of African dust on the local air quality (Prospero, 1999; Prospero and Mayol-Bracero, 2013; Prospero et al., 2014). In Barbados, the monitoring of the atmospheric aerosol mass began in 1965, whereas in Miami, Florida, it began in 1974 and continues to the present (Prospero and Mayol-Bracero, 2013). In Barbados, it is estimated that 50â% of the PM2.5 (i.e., particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter Dâ<â2.5âÂµm) and ca.Â 90â% of the PM10 (i.e., Dâ<â10âÂµm) consist of African dust (Li-Jones and Prospero, 1998; Prospero et al., 2001; Reid et al., 2003a). In Miami, the mean daily mass concentration of mineral dust during the summer typically ranges between 10 and 100âÂµgâmâ3, with a large interannual variability (Prospero et al., 2001). During the Puerto Rico Dust Experiment (PRIDE) campaign, the mineral dust concentration at the ground level was found to exceed 70âÂµgâmâ3 (Reid et al., 2003b). In the aforementioned studies, the African dust particles transported over the Atlantic affected the local air quality, exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for PM2.5 and PM10. According to WHO, air pollution and its effects are considered a global health priority (WHO, 2002). Several studies have linked high concentrations of mineral dust (in terms of PM2.5 and PM10) to brain, skin, lung, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases (Alessandrini et al., 2013; Goudie, 2014; Wilker et al., 2015; Brook et al., 2010; Dominici et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2016). Additionally, African dust particles have been found to serve as carriers for biological material. Griffin et al.Â (2001) reported the presence of viable bacteria and fungi associated with the arrival of African dust over the Virgin Islands (United States). Similarly, Rodriguez-Gomez et al.Â (2020) found a higher concentration of viable bacteria and fungal propagules during summer than during winter on the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, with summer being the season when African dust intrusions are more frequent.\n\nThe chemical and mineralogical composition of particles also plays an important role in the identification of African dust in the receptor regions (Nenes et al., 2014). The most abundant minerals present in these particles are silicates (quartz), clay minerals (kaolinite, illite, chlorite, palygorskite), feldspars (albite, anorthite), and carbonates (calcite) (Goudie and Middleton, 2006; Querol et al., 2019; Broadley et al., 2012). The major oxides in Saharan dust are SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, and K2O, as well as (to a lesser extent) P2O5 and TiO2 (Goudie and Middleton, 2006; Linke et al., 2006). Several studies in the Caribbean have identified high levels of Fe and Al in dust events (Prospero et al., 2001; Rosinski et al., 1988). Additionally, Rosinski et al.Â (1988) reported high percentages of Si and Mg in particles collected in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) during July.\n\nAlthough the arrival of African dust in Mexico has been suggested for decades (e.g., Bravo et al., 1982; Prospero, 1999; Lenes et al., 2012), to our knowledge, there has not been a comprehensive study, published in the open, peer-reviewed literature, that documents this atmospheric phenomenon. For the first time, in this study we document the arrival of African dust on the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula for two consecutive years (i.e., 2017 and 2018) using inÂ situ and remote sensing measurements, reanalysis, back trajectory analysis, and complementary meteorological observations.\n\n3.1âLocal evidence\n\nSeveral studies have shown that air quality (PM2.5 and PM10) significantly deteriorates upon the arrival of African dust plumes (Prospero and Lamb, 2003; Prospero et al., 2001, 2014; Prospero and Mayol-Bracero, 2013). FigureÂ 2 shows the time series of the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations for the JulyâAugust periods of 2017 and 2018. Some high-concentration PM peaks are clearly identified, with PM2.5 and PM10 values as high as 54 and 135âÂµgâmâ3, respectively. Henceforth these peaks will be referred to in our study as African dust peaks (ADPs). Note that the background concentration (defined as the lowest values within the sampling period where the chemical composition was available) of PM2.5 is â¼â4âÂµgâmâ3, and the background concentration of PM10 is â¼â10âÂµgâmâ3. The ADPs found in 2017 (i.e., 22â24Â July, 27â28Â July, and 4, 6â7Â August) resulted in an increase of 300â% in PM2.5â and 500â% in PM10 with respect to background conditions. In 2018, the ADPs (i.e., 10â11Â July, 13â15Â July, 16â17Â July, 23â26Â July, and 9â10Â August) exceeded 200â% and 300â% of the background levels of PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The aforementioned ADPs not only exceeded the PM2.5 and PM10 thresholds suggested by WHO (i.e., PM2.5â=â25âÂµgâmâ3 and PM10â=â50âÂµgâmâ3, 24âh mean) but more than double them, as was the case for the 9â12Â AugustÂ 2018 event. Similar behavior has been previously observed in Puerto Rico, Miami, and Barbados upon the arrival of African dust particles (Reid et al., 2003b; Prospero et al., 2005, 2014). The mass concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were found to be 49â% and 54â% higher in 2018 than in 2017, respectively, suggesting a higher frequency or intensity of African dust plumes arriving over MÃ©rida in 2018.\n\nFigureÂ 2 also shows the elemental composition obtained from the XRF analysis (16 elements) for five ADPs observed during the 2017 and 2018 field campaigns. In addition, 1âd from each field campaign was selected to determine the elemental background composition. The selected days are 10â11Â July in 2017 and 6Â July in 2018. These days were chosen because the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were within the mean background values and did not include any atypical peak nor apparent external influence.\n\nHigh levels of sodium (Na, pink), chlorine (Cl, turquoise blue), sulfur (S, dark orange), and calcium (Ca, light green) were found in the background samples, corresponding to >â70â% of the total mass (Fig.Â 2). The presence of Na and Cl are expected in airborne particles at this site given the city's proximity to the GoM (i.e., 23âkm away). CerÃ³n et al.Â (2002) reported large concentrations of Na, Cl, and Mg that originated from sea salt, when analyzing the composition of rainwater from the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula. The high levels of S can be associated with local anthropogenic activities such as vehicular, ship, and industrial emissions (e.g., Corbett and Fischbeck, 1997; CerÃ³n-BretÃ³n et al., 2018). Additionally, given the short distance between MÃ©rida and the GoM, it is possible that dimethylsulfide (DMS) production from plankton in the GoM could be a natural source of S, as has been shown in other studies (e.g., Rosinski et al., 1988; Kloster et al., 2006; Vallina and SimÃ³, 2007). Finally, the presence of Ca could be related to the limestone soil prevalent on the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula and the resuspension of road dust (Plasencia, 1998; Querol et al., 2019).\n\nInterestingly, the elemental composition of the airborne particles collected during the ADPs showed higher concentrations of silica (Si, dark yellow), aluminum (Al, light purple), and iron (Fe, dark purple) than those in the background particles (Fig.Â 2). While the Si concentrations are approximately 3 times larger than the baseline, Al and Fe increased by 8 and 12 times, respectively. To corroborate the relationship between the increase in PM and the African dust, each of the 16 elements analyzed by XRF were correlated with the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. Of the 16 elements Al, Si, K, and Fe were the only ones with correlation coefficients r>0.6 (p<0.05) for both years, as shown in Fig.Â S1. The present results are in agreement with previous studies that showed high correlation coefficients between the aforementioned elements (e.g., Caquineau et al., 1998; Guieu et al., 2002; Trapp et al., 2010). Also, the concentration of aerosol particles with diameters between 0.5 and 25âÂµm, as measured by the Lasair, were found to be highly correlated with the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, r=0.79 and r=0.87, respectively (Fig.Â S2). Finally, the typical background particle size distribution showed significant changes during the arrival of ADPs for particles ranging between 0.5 and 5.0âÂµm (Fig.Â S3). It is widely known that the typical size of African dust particles transported over long distances ranges from 0.1 to 20âÂµm (e.g., BÃ©gue et al., 2012; Denjean et al. 2016). Overall, the high concentration of coarse particles and the increase in Al, Si, and Fe during the ADPs, together with the good correlations found between the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations with Al, Si, K, Fe, and particles larger than 0.5âÂµm strongly suggests that the ADPs are mineral particles associated with dust transported from Africa to Mexico.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that Al, Si, K, and Fe are common oxides found in African dust composed of minerals and clays such as quartz (SiO2), kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), illite (K,H3O)(Al,Mg,Fe)2(Si,Al)4O10[(OH)2,(H2O)], chlorite (((MgFe)5Al)(AlSi3)O10(OH)8), palygorskite (Mg,Al)2Si4O10(OH)ââ â4(H2O), and feldspars such as albite (NaAlSi3O8), anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8), and orthoclase (KAlSi3O8), among others (Goudie and Middleton, 2006; Linke et al., 2006; Broadley et al., 2012; Querol et al., 2019). Rosinski et al.Â (1988) reported that up to 90â% of the collected airborne particles in the presence of dust events in the GoM contained Al, Fe, and Si. In Puerto Rico, Reid et al.Â (2003b) found that the concentrations of Si and Al on aerosol particles (>0.74âÂµm) were above 10 and 5âÂµgâmâ3, respectively, during dust events that reached the island. Similarly, Prospero et al.Â (2001) reported concentrations of Alâ>â1.0âÂµgâmâ3 and Feâ>â0.5âÂµgâmâ3 on PM2.5 on days when high concentrations of African dust particles were reported in Miami.\n\nTo confirm that no aerosol sources other than the African dust were the origin of the high PM peaks observed in MÃ©rida in July 2017 and 2018, the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were correlated with other measured variables. As shown in Figs.Â S2 and S4, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations are poorly correlated (r<0.09) with local pollution emissions such as particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pPAHs), black carbon (inferred from the absorption coefficient), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Note that those gases and particles can be considered as proxies of anthropogenic pollutants generated by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass burning, as previously demonstrated for MÃ©rida (MuÃ±oz-Salazar et al., 2020; Alvarez-Ospina et al., 2020). Also, correlation coefficients below 0.29 were found between O3 and solar radiation with the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations indicating that it is very unlikely that secondary organic particles could be the source of the ADPs observed in MÃ©rida, as was the case in high particle concentration events shown by MuÃ±oz-Salazar et al.Â (2020).\n\nFinally, although none of the different meteorological variables monitored at the surface level were found to correlate with the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, as shown by the wind roses in Fig.Â S5, easterly winds were prevalent when ADPs were observed. This is relevant as African dust can only be transported by easterly winds.\n\n3.2âLarger-scale observations\n\nTo evaluate the source of the ADPs observed in MÃ©rida from a large-scale perspective, we focus on the classification of tropical air masses in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean region during the boreal summer months proposed by Dunion (2011). We used HYSPLIT to estimate the trajectories of different air masses that reached MÃ©rida during the JulyâAugust periods of 2017 and 2018. HYSPLIT trajectories for the 2017 and 2018 ADPs point to an African origin and, therefore, suggest that these air masses are either MT or SAL (See Fig.Â S6). To differentiate the MT from SAL, we focused on their distinctly unique moisture characteristics. Dunion (2011) proposes that a threshold of 45âmm of total precipitable water vapor (PWV), which corresponds to the total amount of water vapor contained in the atmospheric column from the surface to the top of the troposphere (AMS, 2000), can be used to differentiate dry from moist air masses. This value is consistent with other studies that use PWV to identify dry-air days (e.g., Hankes and Marinaro, 2016), and as deep tropical convection begins to increase above a critical PWV value of 50âmm (Holloway and Neelin, 2009). Note that PWV is given by the vertical integral of the mixing ratio x(p) at the pressure level p in the layer bounded by pressures p1 and p2 and can be calculated using Eq.Â (1) (AMS, 2000):\n\n(1) PWV = 1 Ï g â« p 1 p 2 x d p ,\n\nwhere Ï represents the density of water, and g is the acceleration of gravity.\n\nFigureÂ 3 shows the time series of PWV for the JulyâAugust 2017 and 2018 periods at each WMO radiosonde site. The black solid line shows PWV from MERRA-2, available from the Vertically Integrated Diagnostics (GMAO, 2015a), together with PWV estimated using Eq.Â (1) from the available radiosonde profiles shown as the dashed blue lines. One caveat is that there is a striking lack of radiosonde data in the periods of interest. Nevertheless, we can see good agreement between the available observed PWV and that of PWV from MERRA-2. Therefore, the latter can be used as a good approximation for PWV in the region to differentiate moist from dry air masses. In Fig.Â 3, the periods where PWV is less than 45âmm are highlighted in red. These periods show dry air masses that coincide with air mass trajectories with an African origin (i.e., 22â24Â July, 27â28Â July, and 4 and 6â7Â August in 2017, and 10â12Â July, 13â15Â July, 16â17Â July, 23â26Â July, and 9â12Â August in 2018), allowing us to conclude that these dry air masses have mainly SAL characteristics.\n\nThe arrival of African dust in MÃ©rida was also explored from the MERRA-2 dataset. FigureÂ 4 shows the time series of the estimated vertical profiles of the 3âh time series of the dust mixing ratio from MERRA-2 at MÃ©rida for 2017 and 2018. It shows that the events corresponding to the arrival of dry air masses from Africa displayed in Fig.Â 3 nicely correlate with high dust mixing ratios, strongly supporting the hypothesis of SAL air reaching the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula. FigureÂ 4 also shows that the JulyâAugust period of 2018 was particularly active with frequent arrivals of dust in the region, which is in agreement with the higher PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations measured in 2018, as depicted in Fig.Â 2. FigureÂ S7 focuses on the vertical profiles of the dust mixing ratio for the periods of 21â25Â JulyÂ 2017 and 12â16Â JulyÂ 2018. These periods show the increase in dust in the atmospheric column in the studied region, supporting the hypothesis that the source of the ADPs shown in Fig.Â 2 is likely African dust.\n\nFinally, the arrival of African dust plumes over the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula was confirmed by investigating the AOD detected by the MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites for July 2017 and 2018, as shown in Figs.Â S8 and S9. Although this information cannot be used to perform quantitative analysis, the AOD images allow us to confirm the arrival of African dust plumes on the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula. Additionally, as in Figs.Â 2, 3, and 4, the AOD images also show that the African dust plumes activity was higher in 2018 than in 2017. Previous studies have also used the AOD from MODIS to identify the arrival of African dust. For example, Koren et al.Â (2006) tracked the long-range transport of dust from the BodÃ©lÃ© Depression (north central Africa) to the Amazon Basin. Similarly, Kalashnikova and Kahn (2008) demonstrated that it is possible to observe the evolution of African dust plumes over the Atlantic Ocean with MODIS. Additionally, Kaufman et al.Â (2005) identified and quantified the transport and deposition of mineral dust over the Atlantic Ocean using MODIS data.\n\n3.3âComparison of inÂ situ observations and reanalysis\n\nThe daily mean PM10 from MERRA-2 was estimated using the method proposed by ProvenÃ§al et al.Â (2017). The black line in Fig.Â 5 shows the estimated PM10, which is compared to the PM10 measured by the RUOA station in MÃ©rida (blue line). The estimated surface dust mixing ratio from MERRA-2 is also shown in red. FigureÂ 5 shows that MERRA-2 overestimates PM10 compared with ground-based measurements. Nevertheless, it should be clarified that the reanalysis information corresponds to a 0.5âÃ0.625â region, implying that MERRA-2 is estimating the regional average, whereas the station corresponds to a local measurement.\n\nDespite these differences, Fig.Â 5 shows that the observations at the RUOA station have variations similar to those of MERRA-2. FigureÂ 6 shows the dispersion diagram of the daily mean surface dust mixing ratio from MERRA-2 vs.Â PM10 measured from RUOA station for the periods indicated in Fig.Â 5. It shows a good correlation between the estimated dust and the measured PM10 â in particular for the 2018 period, which was especially active with constant arrivals of African dust to the region, as shown in Fig.Â 4. A similar analysis was performed for the 3âh estimated and measured PM10, as shown in Figs.Â S10 and S11, with identical conclusions to those for 24âh averages.\n\nAdams, A. A., Prospero, J.
