        "meta_description": "Abstract. There are limited measurements of the chemical\ncomposition, abundance and sources of atmospheric particles in the High\nArctic To address this, we report 93âd of soot particle aerosol mass\nspectrometer (SP-AMS) data collected from 20Â February to 23Â May\n2015 at Villum Research Station (VRS) in northern Greenland\n(81â36â²âN). During this period, we observed the Arctic haze\nphenomenon with elevated PM1 concentrations ranging from an average of\n2.3, 2.3 and 3.3âÂµgâmâ3 in February, March and April, respectively, to 1.2âÂµgâmâ3 in May. Particulate sulfate (SO42-) accounted\nfor 66â% of the non-refractory PM1 with the highest concentration until\nthe end of April and decreasing in May. The second most abundant species was\norganic aerosol (OA) (24â%). Both OA and PM1, estimated from the sum\nof all collected species, showed a marked decrease throughout May in\naccordance with the polar front moving north, together with changes in\naerosol removal processes. The highest refractory black carbon (rBC)\nconcentrations were found in the first month of the campaign, averaging 0.2âÂµgâmâ3. In March and April, rBC averaged 0.1âÂµgâmâ3 while decreasing to 0.02âÂµgâmâ3 in May. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) of the OA mass spectra yielded three\nfactors: (1)Â a hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) factor, which was\ndominated by primary aerosols and accounted for 12â% of OA mass, (2)Â an\nArctic haze organic aerosol (AOA) factor and (3)Â a more oxygenated marine\norganic aerosol (MOA) factor. AOA dominated until mid-April (64â%â81â%\nof OA), while being nearly absent from the end of May and correlated\nsignificantly with SO42-, suggesting the main part of that factor\nis secondary OA. The MOA emerged late at the end of March, where it\nincreased with solar radiation and reduced sea ice extent and dominated OA\nfor the rest of the campaign until the end of May (24â%â74â% of OA), while\nAOA was nearly absent. The highest OâC ratio (0.95) and SâC ratio (0.011)\nwas found for MOA. Our data support the current understanding that Arctic\naerosols are highly influenced by secondary aerosol formation and receives an\nimportant contribution from marine emissions during Arctic spring in remote\nHigh Arctic areas. In view of a changing Arctic climate with changing\nsea-ice extent, biogenic processes and corresponding source strengths,\nhighly time-resolved data are needed in order to elucidate the components\ndominating aerosol concentrations and enhance the understanding of the\nprocesses taking place.",

This article demonstrates the comparison of measured and modeled aerosol mass concentrations for black carbon and sulfate particles at a high Arctic site. Based on the findings aging processes during transport seem to prolong the lifetimes of the two species and favor the possibility for their transport to the high Arctic.\n\nCurrent model capabilities for simulating black carbon and sulfate concentrations in the Arctic atmosphere: a multi-model evaluation using a comprehensive measurement data set\n\nS.

Models have long been struggling to capture this seasonality. In this study, we evaluate sulfate and BC concentrations from different updated models and emissions against a comprehensive pan-Arctic measurement data set. We find that the models improved but still struggle to get the maximum concentrations.\n\nWind-driven Emission of Marine Ice Nucleating Particles in the Scripps Ocean-Atmosphere Research Simulator (SOARS)\n\nKathryn A.

The experiment tested how wind speed over the ocean surface influences production of sea spray particles, which are important for radiative forcing and cloud formation in the atmosphere. We found that particle concentration and chemical composition varied with winds speed, and the changes were driven by changes in wind and wave-breaking rather seawater biology or chemistry.\n\nOn the dynamics of ozone depletion events at Villum Research Station in the High Arctic\n\nJakob Boyd Pernov, Jens Liengaard Hjorth, Lise Lotte SÃ¸rensen, and Henrik Skov\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1676,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1676, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nArctic ozone depletion events (ODEs) occurs every spring and have vast implications for the oxidizing capacity, radiative balance, and mercury oxidation. In this study, we analyze ozone, ODEs, and their connection to meteorological and air mass history variables through statistical analyses, back-trajectories, and machine learning (ML) at Villum Research Station. ODEs are favorable under sunny, calm conditions with air masses arriving from northerly wind directions with sea ice contact.\n\nSimultaneous organic aerosol source apportionment at two Antarctic sites reveals large-scale and ecoregion-specific components\n\nMarco Paglione, David C. S. Beddows, Anna Jones, Thomas Lachlan-Cope, Matteo Rinaldi, Stefano Decesari, Francesco Manarini, Mara Russo, Karam Mansour, Roy M. Harrison, Andrea Mazzanti, Emilio Tagliavini, and Manuel Dall'Osto\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 6305–6322, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6305-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6305-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nApplying factor analysis techniques to H-NMR spectra, we present the organic aerosol (OA) source apportionment of PM1 samples collected in parallel at two Antarctic stations, namely Signy and Halley, allowing investigation of aerosol–climate interactions in an unperturbed atmosphere. Our results show remarkable differences between pelagic (open-ocean) and sympagic (sea-ice-influenced) air masses and indicate that various sources and processes are controlling Antarctic aerosols.\n\nOn the potential of Cluster Ion Counter (CIC) to observe local new particle formation, condensation sink and growth rate of newly formed particles\n\nMarkku Kulmala, Santeri Tuovinen, Sander Mirme, Paap Koemets, Lauri Ahonen, Yongchun Liu, Heikki Junninen, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, and Veli-Matti Kerminen\n\nAerosol Research Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2024-14,https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2024-14, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for AR\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith the recently developed instrument CIC (cluster ion counter) we can observe dynamics of small air ions and intermediate air ions. Furthermore we can observe condensation sink and formation and growth rates for intermediated ions.\n\nMultiple eco-regions contribute to the seasonal cycle of Antarctic aerosol size distributions\n\nJames Brean, David C.

Chem. Phys., 24, 4675–4691, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4675-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4675-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy relying solely on publicly available media reports, we were able to infer the temporal evolution and the injection height for the Nord Stream gas leaks in September 2022. The inventory specifies locations, vertical distributions, and temporal evolution of the methane sources. The inventory can be used to simulate the event with atmospheric transport models. The inventory is supplemented with a set of observational data tailored to evaluate the results of the simulated atmospheric dispersion.\n\nMultiphysical description of atmospheric pressure interface chemical ionisation in MION2 and Eisele type inlets\n\nHenning Finkenzeller, Jyri MikkilÃ¤, Cecilia Righi, Paxton Juuti, Mikko SipilÃ¤, Matti Rissanen, Douglas Worsnop, Aleksei Shcherbinin, Nina Sarnela, and Juha Kangasluoma\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2024-48,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2024-48, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for AMT\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChemical ionization mass spectrometry is used in atmospheric sciences to measure trace gas concentrations. Neutral gases require charging in inlets before the mass-to-charge ratio of the resulting ions can be analyzed. This study uses multi-physics modelling to investigate how the MION2 and Eisele type inlets work, shows the effect of tuning parameters, and their current limitations. The findings are helpful for the inlet users and are expected to aid in developing improved inlets.\n\nChemical properties and single-particle mixing state of soot aerosol in Houston during the TRACER campaign\n\nRyan N. Farley, James E. Lee, Laura-HÃ©lÃ¨na Rivellini, Alex K. Y. Lee, Rachael Dal Porto, Christopher D. Cappa, Kyle Gorkowski, Abu Sayeed Md Shawon, Katherine B. Benedict, Allison C. Aiken, Manvendra K. Dubey, and Qi Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 3953–3971, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3953-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3953-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe black carbon aerosol composition and mixing state were characterized using a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer. Single-particle measurements revealed the major role of atmospheric processing in modulating the black carbon mixing state. A significant fraction of soot particles were internally mixed with oxidized organic aerosol and sulfate, with implications for activation as cloud nuclei.\n\nOpinion: A paradigm shift in investigating the general characteristics of atmospheric new particle formation using field observations\n\nMarkku Kulmala, Diego Aliaga, Santeri Tuovinen, Runlong Cai, Heikki Junninen, Chao Yan, Federico Bianchi, Yafang Cheng, Aijun Ding, Douglas R. Worsnop, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Pauli Paasonen, and Veli-Matti Kerminen\n\nAerosol Research, 2, 49–58, https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2-49-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2-49-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric new particle formation (NPF), together with secondary production of particulate matter in the atmosphere, dominates aerosol particle number concentrations and submicron particle mass loads in many environments globally. In this opinion paper, we describe the paradigm shift to understand NPF in a continuous way instead of using traditional binary event–non-event analysis.\n\nElucidating the mechanisms of atmospheric new particle formation in the highly polluted Po Valley, Italy\n\nJing Cai, Juha Sulo, Yifang Gu, Sebastian Holm, Runlong Cai, Steven Thomas, Almuth Neuberger, Fredrik Mattsson, Marco Paglione, Stefano Decesari, Matteo Rinaldi, Rujing Yin, Diego Aliaga, Wei Huang, Yuanyuan Li, Yvette Gramlich, Giancarlo Ciarelli, Lauriane QuÃ©lÃ©ver, Nina Sarnela, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Nora Zannoni, Cheng Wu, Wei Nie, Juha Kangasluoma, Claudia Mohr, Markku Kulmala, Qiaozhi Zha, Dominik Stolzenburg, and Federico Bianchi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2423–2441, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2423-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2423-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy combining field measurements, simulations and recent chamber experiments, we investigate new particle formation (NPF) and growth in the Po Valley, where both haze and frequent NPF occur. Our results show that sulfuric acid, ammonia and amines are the dominant NPF precursors there. A high NPF rate and a lower condensation sink lead to a greater survival probability for newly formed particles, highlighting the importance of gas-to-particle conversion for aerosol concentrations.\n\nThe annual cycle and sources of relevant aerosol precursor vapors in the central Arctic\n\nMatthew Boyer, Diego Aliaga, Lauriane L. J. QuÃ©lÃ©ver, Silvia Bucci, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Angot, Lubna Dada, Benjamin Heutte, Lisa Beck, Marina Duetsch, Andreas Stohl, Ivo Beck, Tiia Laurila, Nina Sarnela, Roseline C. Thakur, Branka Miljevic, Markku Kulmala, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Mikko SipilÃ¤, Julia Schmale, and Tuija Jokinen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2953,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2953, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyze the seasonal cycle and sources of gases that are relevant for the formation of aerosol particles in the central Arctic. Since theses gases can form new particles, they can influence Arctic climate. We show that the sources of these gases are associated with changes in the Arctic environment during the year, especially with respect to sea ice. Therefore, the concentration of these gases will likely change in the future as the Arctic continues to warm.\n\nSource apportionment of soot particles and aqueous-phase processing of black carbon coatings in an urban environment\n\nRyan N. Farley, Sonya Collier, Christopher D. Cappa, Leah R. Williams, Timothy B. Onasch, Lynn M. Russell, Hwajin Kim, and Qi Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15039–15056, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15039-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15039-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoot particles, also known as black carbon (BC), have important implications for global climate and regional air quality. After the particles are emitted, BC can be coated with other material, impacting the aerosol properties. We selectively measured the composition of particles containing BC to explore their sources and chemical transformations in the atmosphere. We focus on a persistent, multiday fog event in order to study the effects of chemical reactions occurring within liquid droplets.\n\nImpact of 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns on particulate air pollution across Europe\n\nJean-Philippe Putaud, Enrico Pisoni, Alexander Mangold, Christoph Hueglin, Jean Sciare, Michael Pikridas, Chrysanthos Savvides, Jakub Ondracek, Saliou Mbengue, Alfred Wiedensohler, Kay Weinhold, Maik Merkel, Laurent Poulain, Dominik van Pinxteren, Hartmut Herrmann, Andreas Massling, Claus Nordstroem, AndrÃ©s Alastuey, Cristina Reche, NoemÃ­ PÃ©rez, Sonia Castillo, Mar Sorribas, Jose Antonio Adame, Tuukka Petaja, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Jarkko Niemi, VÃ©ronique Riffault, Joel F. de Brito, Augustin Colette, Olivier Favez, Jean-Eudes Petit, ValÃ©rie Gros, Maria I. Gini, Stergios Vratolis, Konstantinos Eleftheriadis, Evangelia Diapouli, Hugo Denier van der Gon, Karl Espen Yttri, and Wenche Aas\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 10145–10161, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10145-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10145-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany European people are still exposed to levels of air pollution that can affect their health. COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 were used to assess the impact of the reduction in human mobility on air pollution across Europe by comparing measurement data with values that would be expected if no lockdown had occurred. We show that lockdown measures did not lead to consistent decreases in the concentrations of fine particulate matter suspended in the air, and we investigate why.\n\nEvolution of organic carbon in the laboratory oxidation of biomass-burning emissions\n\nKevin J. Nihill, Matthew M. Coggon, Christopher Y. Lim, Abigail R. Koss, Bin Yuan, Jordan E. Krechmer, Kanako Sekimoto, Jose L. Jimenez, Joost de Gouw, Christopher D. Cappa, Colette L. Heald, Carsten Warneke, and Jesse H. Kroll\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7887–7899, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7887-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7887-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we collect emissions from controlled burns of biomass fuels that can be found in the western United States into an environmental chamber in order to simulate their oxidation as they pass through the atmosphere. These findings provide a detailed characterization of the composition of the atmosphere downwind of wildfires. In turn, this will help to explore the effects of these changing emissions on downwind populations and will also directly inform atmospheric and climate models.\n\nSMEARcore â modular data infrastructure for atmospheric measurement stations\n\nAnton Rusanen, Kristo HÃµrrak, Lauri R. Ahonen, Tuomo Nieminen, Pasi P. Aalto, Pasi Kolari, Markku Kulmala, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, and Heikki Junninen\n\nAtmos. Meas.

This framework, called SMEARcore, consists of modular open-source software components that can be chosen to suit various station configurations. The benefits of using this framework are automation of routine operations and real-time monitoring of measurement results.\n\nModelling wintertime sea-spray aerosols under Arctic haze conditions\n\nEleftherios Ioannidis, Kathy S. Law, Jean-Christophe Raut, Louis Marelle, Tatsuo Onishi, Rachel M. Kirpes, Lucia M. Upchurch, Thomas Tuch, Alfred Wiedensohler, Andreas Massling, Henrik Skov, Patricia K. Quinn, and Kerri A. Pratt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5641–5678, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5641-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5641-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRemote and local anthropogenic emissions contribute to wintertime Arctic haze, with enhanced aerosol concentrations, but natural sources, which also contribute, are less well studied. Here, modelled wintertime sea-spray aerosols are improved in WRF-Chem over the wider Arctic by including updated wind speed and temperature-dependent treatments. As a result, anthropogenic nitrate aerosols are also improved. Open leads are confirmed to be the main source of sea-spray aerosols over northern Alaska.\n\nRevealing the sources and sinks of negative cluster ions in an urban environment through quantitative analysis\n\nRujing Yin, Xiaoxiao Li, Chao Yan, Runlong Cai, Ying Zhou, Juha Kangasluoma, Nina Sarnela, Janne Lampilahti, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Veli-Matti Kerminen, Federico Bianchi, Markku Kulmala, and Jingkun Jiang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5279–5296, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5279-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5279-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric cluster ions are important constituents in the atmosphere. However, the quantitative research on their compositions is still limited, especially in urban environments. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of an in situ quantification method of cluster ions measured by a high-resolution mass spectrometer and reveal their governing factors, sources, and sinks in urban Beijing through quantitative analysis of cluster ions, reagent ions, neutral molecules, and condensation sink.\n\nMeasurement report: High Arctic aerosol hygroscopicity at sub- and supersaturated conditions during spring and summer\n\nAndreas Massling, Robert Lange, Jakob Boyd Pernov, Ulrich Gosewinkel, Lise-Lotte SÃ¸rensen, and Henrik Skov\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4931–4953, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4931-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4931-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effect of anthropogenic activities on cloud formation introduces the highest uncertainties with respect to climate change. Data on Arctic aerosols and their corresponding cloud-forming properties are very scarce and most important as the Arctic is warming about 2 times as fast as the rest of the globe. Our studies investigate aerosols in the remote Arctic and suggest relatively high cloud-forming potential, although differences are observed between the Arctic spring and summer.\n\nIce-nucleating particles in northern Greenland: annual cycles, biological contribution and parameterizations\n\nKevin C. H. Sze, Heike Wex, Markus Hartmann, Henrik Skov, Andreas Massling, Diego Villanueva, and Frank Stratmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4741–4761, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4741-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4741-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce-nucleating particles (INPs) play an important role in cloud formation and thus in our climate. But little is known about the abundance and properties of INPs, especially in the Arctic, where the temperature increases almost 4 times as fast as that of the rest of the globe. We observe higher INP concentrations and more biological INPs in summer than in winter, likely from local sources. We also provide three equations for estimating INP concentrations in models at different times of the year.\n\nMeasurement report: Black carbon properties and concentrations in southern Sweden urban and rural air â the importance of long-range transport\n\nErik Ahlberg, Stina Ausmeel, Lovisa Nilsson, MÃ¥rten Spanne, Julija Pauraite, Jacob KlenÃ¸ NÃ¸jgaard, Michele BertÃ², Henrik Skov, Pontus Roldin, Adam Kristensson, Erik Swietlicki, and Axel Eriksson\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 3051–3064, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3051-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3051-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo investigate the properties and origin of black carbon particles in southern Sweden during late summer, we performed measurements both at a rural site and the nearby city of MalmÃ¶. We found that local traffic emissions of black carbon led to concentrations around twice as high as those at the rural site. Modeling show that these emissions are not clearly distinguishable at the rural site, unless meteorology was favourable, which shows the importance of long-range transport and processing.\n\nCollective geographical ecoregions and precursor sources driving Arctic new particle formation\n\nJames Brean, David C. S. Beddows, Roy M. Harrison, Congbo Song, Peter Tunved, Johan StrÃ¶m, Radovan Krejci, Eyal Freud, Andreas Massling, Henrik Skov, Eija Asmi, Angelo Lupi, and Manuel Dall'Osto\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We provide a harmonised analysis of new particle formation across the Arctic.\n\nArctic tropospheric ozone: assessment of current knowledge and model performance\n\nCynthia H. Whaley, Kathy S.

We find that the seasonal cycles of near-surface atmospheric ozone are variable depending on whether they are near the coast, inland, or at high altitude. Several global model simulations were evaluated, and we found that because models lack some of the ozone chemistry that is important for the coastal Arctic locations, they do not accurately simulate ozone there.\n\nA full year of aerosol size distribution data from the central Arctic under an extreme positive Arctic Oscillation: insights from the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition\n\nMatthew Boyer, Diego Aliaga, Jakob Boyd Pernov, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Angot, Lauriane L.

We evaluate measurements of aerosol particles, which can influence climate, over the central Arctic Ocean for a full year and compare the data to land-based measurement stations across the Arctic. Our measurements show that the central Arctic has similarities to but also distinct differences from the stations further south. We note that this may change as the Arctic warms and sea ice continues to decline.\n\nHygroscopicity and CCN potential of DMS-derived aerosol particles\n\nBernadette Rosati, Sini IsokÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤, Sigurd Christiansen, Mads MÃ¸rk Jensen, Shamjad P. Moosakutty, Robin Wollesen de Jonge, Andreas Massling, Marianne Glasius, Jonas Elm, Annele Virtanen, and Merete Bilde\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Due to the reduction in sulfur-based fossil fuels, natural sulfur emissions play an increasingly important role. Studies investigating the climate relevance of natural sulfur aerosols are scarce. We study the water uptake of such particles in the laboratory, demonstrating a high potential to take up water and form cloud droplets. During atmospheric transit, chemical processing affects the particlesâ composition and thus their water uptake.\n\nOn the relation between apparent ion and total particle growth rates in the boreal forest and related chamber experiments\n\nLoÃ¯c Gonzalez Carracedo, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Lauri R. Ahonen, Nina Sarnela, Sebastian Holm, Juha Kangasluoma, Markku Kulmala, Paul M. Winkler, and Dominik Stolzenburg\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 13153–13166, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13153-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13153-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFast nanoparticle growth is essential for the survival of new aerosol particles in the atmosphere and hence their contribution to the climate. We show that using naturally charged ions for growth calculations can cause a significant error. During the diurnal cycle, the importance of ion-induced and neutral nucleation varies, causing the ion population to have a slower measurable apparent growth. Results suggest that data from ion spectrometers need to be considered with great care below 3 nm.\n\nComparison of particle number size distribution trends in ground measurements and climate models\n\nVille Leinonen, Harri Kokkola, Taina Yli-Juuti, Tero Mielonen, Thomas KÃ¼hn, Tuomo Nieminen, Simo Heikkinen, Tuuli Miinalainen, Tommi Bergman, Ken Carslaw, Stefano Decesari, Markus Fiebig, Tareq Hussein, Niku KivekÃ¤s, Radovan Krejci, Markku Kulmala, Ari Leskinen, Andreas Massling, Nikos Mihalopoulos, Jane P.

We investigated aerosol modes (nucleation, Aitken, and accumulation) separately and were able to show the differences between measured and modeled trends and especially their seasonal patterns. The differences in model results are likely due to complex effects of several processes instead of certain specific model features.\n\nDiurnal evolution of negative atmospheric ions above the boreal forest: from ground level to the free troposphere\n\nLisa J.

The number of significant trends in summer is smaller than in winter, and overall the pattern is ambiguous with some significant positive and negative trends. This reflects the mixed influence of natural and anthropogenic emissions.\n\nMeasurement report: Long-term measurements of aerosol precursor concentrations in the Finnish subarctic boreal forest\n\nTuija Jokinen, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Roseline Cutting Thakur, Ilona Ylivinkka, Kimmo Neitola, Nina Sarnela, Totti Laitinen, Markku Kulmala, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, and Mikko SipilÃ¤\n\nAtmos.

Here, we report 7 months of CI-APi-TOF measurements of sulfuric acid, iodic acid, methane sulfonic acid and the sum of highly oxygenated organic molecules from the SMEAR I station in the Finnish subarctic. The results help us to understand atmospheric chemical processes and aerosol formation in this rapidly changing area.\n\nParticle emissions from a modern heavy-duty diesel engine as ice nuclei in immersion freezing mode: a laboratory study on fossil and renewable fuels\n\nKimmo Korhonen, Thomas Bjerring Kristensen, John Falk, Vilhelm B.

Three different fuels were studied without blending, including fossil diesel and two renewable fuels, testing different emission aftertreatment systems and photochemical aging. We found that the diesel emissions were inefficient ice nuclei, and aging had no or little effect on their ice-nucleating abilities.\n\nMarine gas-phase sulfur emissions during an induced phytoplankton bloom\n\nDelaney B.

Dimethyl sulfide (DMS), methanethiol (MeSH), and benzothiazole accounted for on average over 90 % of total gas-phase sulfur emissions. This work focuses on factors controlling the production and emission of DMS and MeSH and the role of non-DMS molecules (such as MeSH and benzothiazole) in secondary sulfate formation in coastal marine environments.\n\nWintertime subarctic new particle formation from Kola Peninsula sulfur emissions\n\nMikko SipilÃ¤, Nina Sarnela, Kimmo Neitola, Totti Laitinen, Deniz Kemppainen, Lisa Beck, Ella-Maria Duplissy, Salla Kuittinen, Tuuli LehmusjÃ¤rvi, Janne Lampilahti, Veli-Matti Kerminen, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Pasi P.

Sulfur dioxide emissions from the ore smelters are transported across large areas. We investigated sulfur dioxide and its transformation to sulfuric acid aerosol particles during winter months in Finnish Lapland, close to Kola industrial areas. We observed intense formation of new aerosol particles despite the low solar radiation intensity, often required for new particle formation elsewhere.\n\nDynamics of gaseous oxidized mercury at Villum Research Station during the High Arctic summer\n\nJakob Boyd Pernov, Bjarne Jensen, Andreas Massling, Daniel Charles Thomas, and Henrik Skov\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 13287–13309, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13287-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13287-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric mercury species (GEM, GOM, PHg) are important constituents in the High Arctic due to their detrimental effects on human and ecosystem health. However, understanding their behavior in the High Arctic summer remains lacking. This research investigates the dynamics of mercury oxidation in the High Arctic summer. The cold, dry, sunlit free troposphere was associated with events of high GOM in the High Arctic summer, while individual events yielded unique origins.\n\nA phenomenology of new particle formation (NPF) at 13 European sites\n\nDimitrios Bousiotis, Francis D.

New particle formation events arising from nucleation of gaseous precursors have been analysed in extensive datasets from 13 sites in five European countries in terms of frequency, nucleation rate, and particle growth rate, with several common features and many differences identified. Although nucleation frequencies are lower at roadside sites, nucleation rates and particle growth rates are typically higher.\n\nThe importance of sesquiterpene oxidation products for secondary organic aerosol formation in a springtime hemiboreal forest\n\nLuis M.

Sesquiterpene mixing ratios and particle-phase concentrations of corresponding oxidation products were rapidly increasing on some early mornings. The particle volatility suggested that condensable sesquiterpene oxidation products are rapidly formed in the atmosphere. The results revealed the importance of sesquiterpenes for secondary organic aerosol particulate mass.\n\nDifferentiation of coarse-mode anthropogenic, marine and dust particles in the High Arctic islands of Svalbard\n\nCongbo Song, Manuel Dall'Osto, Angelo Lupi, Mauro Mazzola, Rita Traversi, Silvia Becagli, Stefania Gilardoni, Stergios Vratolis, Karl Espen Yttri, David C.

The study found that anthropogenic and natural aerosols comprised 27 % and 73 % of the occurrence of the coarse-mode aerosols, respectively. Our study shows that about two-thirds of the coarse-mode aerosols are related to two sea-spray-related aerosol clusters, indicating that sea spray aerosol may more complex in the Arctic environment.\n\nPresent and future aerosol impacts on Arctic climate change in the GISS-E2.1 Earth system model\n\nUlas Im, Kostas Tsigaridis, Gregory Faluvegi, Peter L. Langen, Joshua P. French, Rashed Mahmood, Manu A. Thomas, Knut von Salzen, Daniel C. Thomas, Cynthia H. Whaley, Zbigniew Klimont, Henrik Skov, and JÃ¸rgen Brandt\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Molecular composition and volatility of gaseous organic compounds with different oxidation extents (from volatile organic compounds to highly oxygenated organic molecules) were investigated and discussed. We provide a more comprehensive understanding of atmospheric organic compounds in this boreal forest and new insights into interpreting ambient measurements or testing and improving parameterizations in models.\n\nProperties and emission factors of cloud condensation nuclei from biomass cookstoves â observations of a strong dependency on potassium content in the fuel\n\nThomas Bjerring Kristensen, John Falk, Robert Lindgren, Christina Andersen, Vilhelm B. Malmborg, Axel C. Eriksson, Kimmo Korhonen, Ricardo Luis Carvalho, Christoffer Boman, Joakim Pagels, and Birgitta Svenningsson\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Nevertheless, little is known about those aerosol particles' ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and thus influence cloud properties and climate. Our study shows a strong link between the potassium content in the fuel and emissions of CCN for different stove technologies. Previous studies may have underestimated the anthropogenic climate impact of these emissions.\n\nThe effect of meteorological conditions and atmospheric composition in the occurrence and development of new particle formation (NPF) events in Europe\n\nDimitrios Bousiotis, James Brean, Francis D.

Some variables, like solar radiation intensity and temperature, have a positive effect on the occurrence of these events, while others have a negative effect, affecting different aspects such as the rate at which particles are formed or grow. This effect varies depending on the site type and magnitude of these variables.\n\nAtmospheric VOC measurements at a High Arctic site: characteristics and source apportionment\n\nJakob B. Pernov, Rossana Bossi, Thibaut Lebourgeois, Jacob K. NÃ¸jgaard, Rupert Holzinger, Jens L. Hjorth, and Henrik Skov\n\nAtmos. Chem.

However, an understanding of their sources is lacking. This research presents a multiseason high-time-resolution dataset of VOCs in the Arctic and details their temporal characteristics and source apportionment. Four sources were identified: biomass burning, marine cryosphere, background, and Arctic haze.\n\nLong-term measurement of sub-3 nm particles and their precursor gases in the boreal forest\n\nJuha Sulo, Nina Sarnela, Jenni Kontkanen, Lauri Ahonen, Pauli Paasonen, Tiia Laurila, Tuija Jokinen, Juha Kangasluoma, Heikki Junninen, Mikko SipilÃ¤, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Markku Kulmala, and Katrianne Lehtipalo\n\nAtmos.

We also observed seasonal differences in both particle and precursor vapor concentrations and the formation pathways of these particles. Our results confirm the importance of organic vapors in atmospheric aerosol formation and highlight key seasonal differences that require further study.\n\nPan-Arctic surface ozone: modelling vs. measurements\n\nXin Yang, Anne-M. Blechschmidt, Kristof Bognar, Audra McClure-Begley, Sara Morris, Irina Petropavlovskikh, Andreas Richter, Henrik Skov, Kimberly Strong, David W. Tarasick, Taneil Uttal, Mika Vestenius, and Xiaoyi Zhao\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Model experiments show that model runs with blowing-snow-sourced sea salt aerosols implemented as a source of reactive bromine can reproduce well large-scale ozone depletion events observed in the Arctic. This study supplies modelling evidence of the proposed mechanism of reactive-bromine release from blowing snow on sea ice (Yang et al., 2008).\n\nVariability in gaseous elemental mercury at Villum Research Station, Station Nord, in North Greenland from 1999 to 2017\n\nHenrik Skov, Jens Hjorth, Claus NordstrÃ¸m, Bjarne Jensen, Christel Christoffersen, Maria Bech Poulsen, Jesper Baldtzer Liisberg, David Beddows, Manuel Dall'Osto, and Jesper Heile Christensen\n\nAtmos.

It bioaccumulates in food webs, is ubiquitous in the atmosphere, and atmospheric transport is an important source for this element in the Arctic. Measurements of gaseous elemental mercury have been carried out at the Villum Research Station at Station Nord in northern Greenland since 1999. The measurements are compared with model results from the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model.

We have measured properties of the airborne particles in several plumes from ships that are sailing within an Emission Control Area. Individual ships showed large variability in contribution to total particle mass and nitrogen dioxide. Organics and sulfate dominated the particle mass, and most plumes contained very little or no soot. We also present recommendations for future stationary ship plume measurements.\n\nOverview: Integrative and Comprehensive Understanding on Polar Environments (iCUPE) â concept and initial results\n\nTuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Ella-Maria Duplissy, Ksenia Tabakova, Julia Schmale, Barbara AltstÃ¤dter, Gerard Ancellet, Mikhail Arshinov, Yurii Balin, Urs Baltensperger, Jens Bange, Alison Beamish, Boris Belan, Antoine Berchet, Rossana Bossi, Warren R.

Upon aging, the particle chemical composition and ability to absorb sunlight changed owing to reactions in both the gas and particulate phases. We developed a model to explain the observations and used this to derive insights into the aging of smoke in the atmosphere.\n\nInsights into atmospheric oxidation processes by performing factor analyses on subranges of mass spectra\n\nYanjun Zhang, Otso PerÃ¤kylÃ¤, Chao Yan, Liine Heikkinen, Mikko ÃijÃ¤lÃ¤, Kaspar R.

A number of new particle formation (NPF) events and growth were frequently observed in both Arctic terrestrial and Arctic marine air masses. This suggests that terrestrial ecosystems – including river outflows and tundra – strongly affect aerosol emissions in the Arctic coastal areas, affecting radiative forcing.\n\nIce-nucleating ability of particulate emissions from solid-biomass-fired cookstoves: an experimental study\n\nKimmo Korhonen, Thomas Bjerring Kristensen, John Falk, Robert Lindgren, Christina Andersen, Ricardo Luis Carvalho, Vilhelm Malmborg, Axel Eriksson, Christoffer Boman, Joakim Pagels, Birgitta Svenningsson, Mika Komppula, Kari E.

We found that even small changes in combustion conditions may affect the ice-nucleating ability of the emissions significantly. Also six different physico-chemical properties of the emissions were studied, but no clear correlation to their ice-nucleating ability was found.\n\nThe trend of the oxidants in boreal forest over 2007–2018: comprehensive modelling study with long-term measurements at SMEAR II, Finland\n\nDean Chen, Putian Zhou, Tuomo Nieminen, Pontus Roldin, Ximeng Qi, Petri Clusius, Carlton Xavier, Lukas Pichelstorfer, Markku Kulmala, Pekka Rantala, Juho Aalto, Nina Sarnela, Pasi Kolari, Petri Keronen, Matti P.

We studied how the trends of these atmospheric oxidants and H2SO4 changed in southern Finland during the past 12 years and discussed how these trends related to decreasing emissions of air pollutants in Europe. Our results showed that OH increased by 1.56 % yr−1 at daytime and NO3 decreased by 3.92 % yr−1 at nighttime.\n\nOn the annual variability of Antarctic aerosol size distributions at Halley Research Station\n\nThomas Lachlan-Cope, David C.

We demonstrate the utility of clustering for analysis and interpretation of the composition and volatility of secondary organic aerosol. We show that the thermal desorption profiles are represented by only 9–13 distinct clusters, with the number of clusters obtained dependent on the precursor and formation conditions.\n\nBiomass-burning-derived particles from a wide variety of fuels â Part 1: Properties of primary particles\n\nCrystal D. McClure, Christopher Y. Lim, David H. Hagan, Jesse H. Kroll, and Christopher D. Cappa\n\nAtmos. Chem.

In this study, we describe laboratory experiments where we simulate the atmospheric chemistry of smoke emitted from a range of biomass fuels. We show that certain understudied compounds, such as furans and phenolic compounds, are significant contributors to pollutants formed as a result of typical atmospheric oxidation.\n\nSecondary organic aerosol formation from the laboratory oxidation of biomass burning emissions\n\nChristopher Y. Lim, David H. Hagan, Matthew M. Coggon, Abigail R. Koss, Kanako Sekimoto, Joost de Gouw, Carsten Warneke, Christopher D. Cappa, and Jesse H. Kroll\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The amount and composition of particles from wildfires can change with time in the atmosphere; however, the impact of aging is not well understood. In a series of controlled laboratory experiments, we show that the particles are oxidized and a significant fraction of the gas-phase carbon (24 %–56 %) is converted to particle mass over the course of several days in the atmosphere.\n\nChamber-based insights into the factors controlling epoxydiol (IEPOX) secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yield, composition, and volatility\n\nEmma L.

A major product of its oxidation is an epoxydiol, IEPOX, which can be efficiently taken up by acidic aerosol to generate substantial amounts of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). We present chamber experiments exploring the properties of IEPOX SOA and reconcile discrepancies between field, laboratory, and model studies of this process.\n\nThe importance of the representation of air pollution emissions for the modeled distribution and radiative effects of black carbon in the Arctic\n\nJacob Schacht, Bernd Heinold, Johannes Quaas, John Backman, Ribu Cherian, Andre Ehrlich, Andreas Herber, Wan Ting Katty Huang, Yutaka Kondo, Andreas Massling, P.

Phys., 19, 11159–11183, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11159-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11159-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Arctic is warming faster than the rest of Earth. Black carbon (BC) aerosol contributes to this Arctic amplification by direct and indirect aerosol radiative effects while distributed in air or deposited on snow and ice. The aerosol-climate model ECHAM-HAM is used to estimate direct aerosol radiative effect (DRE). Airborne and near-surface BC measurements are used to evaluate the model and give an uncertainty range for the burden and DRE of Arctic BC caused by different emission inventories.\n\nMethods for identifying aged ship plumes and estimating contribution to aerosol exposure downwind of shipping lanes\n\nStina Ausmeel, Axel Eriksson, Erik Ahlberg, and Adam Kristensson\n\nAtmos.

We also quantify the contribution of these plumes to local particle levels, which has relevance for health effects. Ships emit a lot of nanometre-sized particles, which proved to be a good indicator of plumes at a distance of about 10 km downwind of a shipping lane in the Baltic Sea.\n\nOrganic coating on sulfate and soot particles during late summer in the Svalbard Archipelago\n\nHua Yu, Weijun Li, Yangmei Zhang, Peter Tunved, Manuel Dall'Osto, Xiaojing Shen, Junying Sun, Xiaoye Zhang, Jianchao Zhang, and Zongbo Shi\n\nAtmos.

The mixing state of different aerosols is a key parameter influencing such interactions. However, little is known of this parameter, preventing an accurate representation of this information in global models. Multi-microscopic techniques were used to find one general core–shell structure in which secondary sulfate particles were covered by organic coating in the Arctic atmosphere.\n\nA novel approach for simple statistical analysis of high-resolution mass spectra\n\nYanjun Zhang, Otso PerÃ¤kylÃ¤, Chao Yan, Liine Heikkinen, Mikko ÃijÃ¤lÃ¤, Kaspar R.

Confined for longer time periods by consolidated pack sea ice regions, the Greenland site shows lower ultrafine-mode aerosol concentrations during summer relative to the Svalbard sites. Our study supports international environmental cooperation concerning the Arctic region.\n\nAnalysis of new particle formation (NPF) events at nearby rural, urban background and urban roadside sites\n\nDimitrios Bousiotis, Manuel Dall'Osto, David C. S. Beddows, Francis D. Pope, and Roy M. Harrison\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The conditions favouring new particle formation events are identified and compared between the sites. Although a higher degree of pollution presents a greater condensation sink, it appears to be largely compensated for by faster particle growth rates.\n\nAnnual variability of ice-nucleating particle concentrations at different Arctic locations\n\nHeike Wex, Lin Huang, Wendy Zhang, Hayley Hung, Rita Traversi, Silvia Becagli, Rebecca J.

These particles are important for Arctic clouds, as they can change the lifetime of clouds. We suggest that higher concentrations of these particles in summertime originate from the Arctic biosphere (both marine and terrestrial). With a warming Arctic, these concentrations may increase further, influencing aerosol–cloud interactions and therewith the observed strong warming of the Arctic.\n\nSimulating secondary organic aerosol in a regional air quality model using the statistical oxidation model â Part 3: Assessing the influence of semi-volatile and intermediate-volatility organic compounds and NOx\n\nAli Akherati, Christopher D.

Here, we perform a data-driven analysis of multiple aerosol mass spectrometric data sets, to show that the traditional separation of organics and inorganics is not necessary. The resulting 7-component aerosol speciation explains 83 % to 96 % of observed variability at our boreal forest experiment site.\n\nEffect of salt seed particle surface area, composition and phase on secondary organic aerosol mass yields in oxidation flow reactors\n\nErik Ahlberg, Axel Eriksson, William H. Brune, Pontus Roldin, and Birgitta Svenningsson\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The experiments confirmed that increasing the condensation sink significantly increases the particle mass yields in oxidation flow reactors. Further, wet seed particles increased the particle mass yield by 60 % more than dry particles.\n\nMain drivers of transparent exopolymer particle distribution across the surface Atlantic Ocean\n\nMarina Zamanillo, Eva Ortega-Retuerta, Sdena Nunes, Pablo RodrÃ­guez-Ros, Manuel Dall'Osto, Marta Estrada, Maria Montserrat Sala, and Rafel SimÃ³\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 733–749, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-733-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-733-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany marine microorganisms produce polysaccharide-rich transparent exopolymer particles (TEPs) for rather unknown reasons but with important consequences for the ocean carbon cycle, sea–air gas exchange and formation of organic aerosols. Here we compare surfaceâocean distributions of TEPs and physical, chemical and biological variables along a N–S transect in the Atlantic Ocean. Our data suggest that phytoplankton and not bacteria are the main TEP producers, and solar radiation acts as a sink.\n\nRefined classification and characterization of atmospheric new-particle formation events using air ions\n\nLubna Dada, Robert Chellapermal, Stephany Buenrostro Mazon, Pauli Paasonen, Janne Lampilahti, Hanna E. Manninen, Heikki Junninen, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Veli-Matti Kerminen, and Markku Kulmala\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 17883–17893, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17883-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17883-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur paper provides an automatic method to classify new particle formation events into four classes based on the accompanying air ion concentrations. The method is applied to 10 years of data measured within the SMEAR II station and was capable of eliminating the undefined class as well as defining the start, peak and end times of a regional event by monitoring the initial steps of cluster formation. Our method can be modified and applied to different locations where particle formation occurs.\n\nVertical characterization of highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) below and above a boreal forest canopy\n\nQiaozhi Zha, Chao Yan, Heikki Junninen, Matthieu Riva, Nina Sarnela, Juho Aalto, Lauriane QuÃ©lÃ©ver, Simon Schallhart, Lubna Dada, Liine Heikkinen, Otso PerÃ¤kylÃ¤, Jun Zou, ClÃ©mence Rose, Yonghong Wang, Ivan Mammarella, Gabriel Katul, Timo Vesala, Douglas R. Worsnop, Markku Kulmala, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Federico Bianchi, and Mikael Ehn\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 17437–17450, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17437-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17437-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVertical measurements of highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) below and above the forest canopy were performed for the first time in a boreal forest during September 2016. Our results highlight that near-ground HOM measurements may only be representative of a small fraction of the entire nocturnal boundary layer, which may sequentially influence the growth of newly formed particles and SOA formation close to ground surface, where the majority of measurements are conducted.\n\nInfluence of relative humidity on the heterogeneous oxidation of secondary organic aerosol\n\nZiyue Li, Katherine A. Smith, and Christopher D. Cappa\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 14585–14608, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-14585-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-14585-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the influence of relative humidity (RH) on the heterogeneous oxidation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles by OH radicals. We observed significantly faster volume loss and compositional change of SOA at high RH, showing that viscosity differences determine compositional changes, but variability in either the uptake coefficient or the fragmentation probability are required to explain the difference in volume loss between low and high RH.\n\nModeling the formation and composition of secondary organic aerosol from diesel exhaust using parameterized and semi-explicit chemistry and thermodynamic models\n\nSailaja Eluri, Christopher D. Cappa, Beth Friedman, Delphine K. Farmer, and Shantanu H. Jathar\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 13813–13838, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-13813-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-13813-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs oxidation flow reactors (OFRs) are increasingly used to study aerosol formation and evolution in laboratory and field environments, there is a need to develop models that can be used to interpret OFR data. In this work, we evaluate two coupled chemistry and thermodynamic models to simulate secondary organic aerosol formation (SOA) from diluted diesel exhaust and explore the sources, pathways, and processes important to SOA formation.\n\nThe role of H2SO4-NH3 anion clusters in ion-induced aerosol nucleation mechanisms in the boreal forest\n\nChao Yan, Lubna Dada, ClÃ©mence Rose, Tuija Jokinen, Wei Nie, Siegfried Schobesberger, Heikki Junninen, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Nina Sarnela, Ulla Makkonen, Olga Garmash, Yonghong Wang, Qiaozhi Zha, Pauli Paasonen, Federico Bianchi, Mikko SipilÃ¤, Mikael Ehn, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Veli-Matti Kerminen, Douglas R. Worsnop, and Markku Kulmala\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 13231–13243, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-13231-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-13231-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIons can play an important role in atmospheric new particle formation by stabilizing the embryonic clusters. Such a process is called ion-induced nucleation (IIN). We found two distinct IIN mechanisms – driven by H2SO4-NH3 clusters and by organic vapors, respectively. The concentration ratio of organic vapors to H2SO4 regulates via which pathway the IIN occur. As the organic vapor concentration is influenced by temperature, a seasonal variation in the main IIN mechanism can be expected.\n\nExploring non-linear associations between atmospheric new-particle formation and ambient variables: a mutual information approach\n\nMartha A. Zaidan, Ville Haapasilta, Rishi Relan, Pauli Paasonen, Veli-Matti Kerminen, Heikki Junninen, Markku Kulmala, and Adam S. Foster\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 12699–12714, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-12699-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-12699-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article promotes the use of the mutual information method for finding any non-linear associations among atmospheric variables. We demonstrate that the same results from previous studies are obtained by this method, which operates without supervision and without the need of understanding the physics deeply. This suggests that the method is suitable to be implemented widely in the atmospheric field to discover other interesting phenomena and their relevant variables.\n\nComprehensive analysis of particle growth rates from nucleation mode to cloud condensation nuclei in boreal forest\n\nPauli Paasonen, Maija Peltola, Jenni Kontkanen, Heikki Junninen, Veli-Matti Kerminen, and Markku Kulmala\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 12085–12103, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-12085-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-12085-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe determine aerosol growth rates in diameter ranges from below 10 to over 300 nm from long-term data with a novel automatic method. We show that aerosol growth rate in boreal forest increases with increasing particle diameter from 10 nm to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) sizes and that the growth rate of sub-CCN particles is not suppressed by increasing condensation sink. Our findings suggest that aerosol growth to CCN sizes is a faster and less self-regulated process than previously estimated.\n\nMeasurement and modeling of the multiwavelength optical properties of uncoated flame-generated soot\n\nSara D. Forestieri, Taylor M. Helgestad, Andrew T. Lambe, Lindsay Renbaum-Wolff, Daniel A. Lack, Paola Massoli, Eben S. Cross, Manvendra K. Dubey, Claudio Mazzoleni, Jason S. Olfert, Arthur J. Sedlacek III, Andrew Freedman, Paul Davidovits, Timothy B. Onasch, and Christopher D. Cappa\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 12141–12159, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-12141-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-12141-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe characterized optical properties of flame-derived black carbon particles and interpret our observations through the use of Mie theory and Rayleigh–Debye–Gans theory. We determined that the mass absorption coefficient is independent of particle collapse and use this to derive theory- and wavelength-specific refractive indices for black carbon (BC). We demonstrate the inadequacy of Mie theory and suggest an alternative approach for atmospheric models to better represent light absorption by BC.\n\nModelling studies of HOMs and their contributions to new particle formation and growth: comparison of boreal forest in Finland and a polluted environment in China\n\nXimeng Qi, Aijun Ding, Pontus Roldin, Zhengning Xu, Putian Zhou, Nina Sarnela, Wei Nie, Xin Huang, Anton Rusanen, Mikael Ehn, Matti P. Rissanen, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Markku Kulmala, and Michael Boy\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 11779–11791, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-11779-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-11779-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we simulate the HOM concentrations and discuss their roles in NPF at a remote boreal forest site in Finland and a suburban site in eastern China. We found that sulfuric acid and HOM organonitrate concentrations in the gas phase are significantly higher but other HOM monomers and dimers from monoterpene oxidation are lower in eastern China. This study highlights the need for molecular-scale measurements in improving the understanding of NPF mechanisms in polluted areas.\n\nEstablishing the impact of model surfactants on cloud condensation nuclei activity of sea spray aerosol mimics\n\nSara D. Forestieri, Sean M. Staudt, Thomas M. Kuborn, Katharine Faber, Christopher R. Ruehl, Timothy H. Bertram, and Christopher D. Cappa\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 10985–11005, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-10985-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-10985-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur work establishes how surface tension reduction influences droplet growth and activation of simple sea spray mimics (NaCl coated with fatty acids). Fatty acids can substantially reduce droplet surface tension near activation but have limited impact on activation. Coating of NaCl by palmitic acid (a wax) impedes water uptake, but this impedance is removed if oleic acid (a liquid) is mixed in. The properties that surface-active compounds need to impact activation are theoretically examined.\n\nMorphological transformation of soot: investigation of microphysical processes during the condensation of sulfuric acid and limonene ozonolysis product vapors\n\nXiangyu Pei, Mattias Hallquist, Axel C. Eriksson, Joakim Pagels, Neil M. Donahue, Thomas Mentel, Birgitta Svenningsson, William Brune, and Ravi Kant Pathak\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 9845–9860, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-9845-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-9845-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe findings in this study show that morphological transformation of soot occurs via two key complementary and sequential processes, i.e., void filling in the particle and its diameter growth. To quantify the state of morphological transformation, i.e., the utilization of material for filling and growth during the condensation processes, a framework was developed which can further be utilized to quantify the effect of condensed material on the optical and hygroscopic properties of soot.\n\nFluxes of gaseous elemental mercuryÂ (GEM) in the High Arctic during atmospheric mercury depletion eventsÂ (AMDEs)\n\nJesper Kamp, Henrik Skov, Bjarne Jensen, and Lise Lotte SÃ¸rensen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 6923–6938, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-6923-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-6923-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeasurements of mercury fluxes over snow surfaces are carried out at the High Arctic site at Villum Research Station in North Greenland. The measurements were carried out from 23 April to 12 May during spring 2016, where atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) took place. The measurements showed a net emission of 8.9 ng m−2 min−1, with only a few depositional fluxes. GEM fluxes and atmospheric temperature measurements suggest that GEM emission partly could be affected by surface heating.\n\nUsing spectral methods to obtain particle size information from optical data: applications to measurements from CARES 2010\n\nDean B. Atkinson, Mikhail Pekour, Duli Chand, James G. Radney, Katheryn R. Kolesar, Qi Zhang, Ari Setyan, Norman T. O'Neill, and Christopher D. Cappa\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 5499–5514, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-5499-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-5499-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use in situ measurements of particle light extinction to assess the performance of a typical aerosol remote retrieval method. The retrieved fine-mode fraction of extinction, a property commonly used to characterize the anthropogenic influence on the aerosol optical depth, compares well with the in situ measurements as does the retrieved effective fine-mode radius, which characterizes the average size of the particles that contribute most to scattering.\n\nMeasurementâmodel comparison of stabilized Criegee intermediateÂ and highly oxygenated molecule productionÂ inÂ theÂ CLOUDÂ chamber\n\nNina Sarnela, Tuija Jokinen, Jonathan Duplissy, Chao Yan, Tuomo Nieminen, Mikael Ehn, Siegfried Schobesberger, Martin Heinritzi, Sebastian Ehrhart, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Jasmin TrÃ¶stl, Mario Simon, Andreas KÃ¼rten, Markus Leiminger, Michael J.

This process is called new particle formation. In this paper we studied the formation of sulfuric acid and highly oxygenated molecules, the key compounds in atmospheric new particle formation, in chamber experiments and introduced a way to simulate these ozonolysis products of Î±-pinene in a simple manner.\n\nInfluence of temperature on the molecular composition of ions and charged clusters during pure biogenic nucleation\n\nCarla Frege, Ismael K.

Here we compare the molecular composition of positive and negative HOM clusters at 25, 5 and −25 °C. At lower temperatures the HOM average oxygen-to-carbon ratio decreases indicating a reduction in the rate of autoxidation due to rather high activation energy. The experimental findings are supported by quantum chemical calculations.\n\nThe role of ions in new particle formation in the CLOUD chamber\n\nRobert Wagner, Chao Yan, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Jonathan Duplissy, Tuomo Nieminen, Juha Kangasluoma, Lauri R.

Y. Lee, Chia-Li Chen, Jun Liu, Derek J. Price, Raghu Betha, Lynn M. Russell, Xiaolu Zhang, and Christopher D. Cappa\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 15055–15067, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-15055-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-15055-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding the mixing state of ambient black carbon (BC) and the chemical characteristics of its associated coatings is important to evaluate BC fate and environmental impacts. This study reports fresh secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation near traffic emissions during daytime. Our observations suggest that BC was unlikely the major condensation sink of SOA, and a portion of SOA condensed on BC surface was chemically different from other SOA particles that were externally mixed with BC.\n\nObservational assessment of the role of nocturnal residual-layer chemistry in determining daytime surface particulate nitrateÂ concentrations\n\nGouri Prabhakar, Caroline L.

We provide an observational demonstration of how nocturnal production and advection in aloft layers combines with daytime production and loss from entrainment and deposition to give rise to a distinct diurnal profile in surface nitrate concentrations.\n\nThe role of highly oxygenated moleculesÂ (HOMs) in determining the composition of ambient ions in the boreal forest\n\nFederico Bianchi, Olga Garmash, Xucheng He, Chao Yan, Siddharth Iyer, Ida Rosendahl, Zhengning Xu, Matti P.

Two different classes of compounds, clustered with the nitrate and bisulfate ions, were identified: HOMs containing only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen-containing HOMs or organonitrates (ONs). They exhibit strong diurnal variations where HOMs peak during night and ONs during day. Finally, large clusters containing up to 40 carbon atoms (four oxidized α-pinene units) were observed.\n\nPan-Arctic aerosol number size distributions: seasonality and transport patterns\n\nEyal Freud, Radovan Krejci, Peter Tunved, Richard Leaitch, Quynh T. Nguyen, Andreas Massling, Henrik Skov, and Leonard Barrie\n\nAtmos. Chem.

These particles affect climate and air quality. The main factors that control the distinct annual cycle in the concentration of these particles are long-range transport and precipitation. The former brings pollution from the Asian sector – mostly during winter/spring – while the latter clears the air in summer/autumn. However, there are consistent differences between the sites due to regional factors.\n\nLong-term particulate matter modeling for health effect studies in California â Part 2: Concentrations and sources of ultrafine organic aerosols\n\nJianlin Hu, Shantanu Jathar, Hongliang Zhang, Qi Ying, Shu-Hua Chen, Christopher D.
