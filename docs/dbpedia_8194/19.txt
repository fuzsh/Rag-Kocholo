Gaston Orellana, (born 18 July 1933) is a Spanish painter. Orellana was born in Valparaiso, Chile in 1933, son of Spanish parents Armando de Orellana, an engineer and Spanish diplomat, and Ernestina del Transito née Morgadon. Although born abroad, Orellana was born into the ancient aristocratic house of Orellana la Vieja, from Extremadura, Spain. He has since lived in Spain, Italy, the United States the UK and France. Orellana was born in the city of Valparaiso during his father's tenure as Spanish special diplomatic representative to Chile, his siblings having been born during similar diplomatic residencies abroad in Brazil and Argentina. Orellana first studied Fine Art at the experimental Escuela Experimental de Educación Artistica Santiago, Chile. He then continued his studies at the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Viña del Mar and perfectioned his skill with the violin at the Conservatorio de Música within the same school. In 1954, Orellana meets Pablo Neruda, establishing an intense relationship that was to last until the death of the poet. This friendship was to greatly affect Orellana, to whom the poet dedicated the poem "Recibimiento" in 1966, praising "what lies in the work/ of Orellana/ is as alive/ as a life, as secure as/ an object, as mysterious/ as a stone."[1] Orellana briefly studied at the Universidad de Chile reading Archaeology and Anthropology, studies that were followed by a journey of archaeological studies through Northern Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, led by Father Le Perc and the famous archaeologist Antonio Diez de Medina. Following this intense period of studies in archaeology, which were to greatly affect his work to this day, Orellana moved to Spain, first in a brief spell in Majorca and then to settle in Madrid, where he became a founding member of the Grupo Hondo in 1959.[1] In his earliest works, Orellana shows some of the signs that were to become the Neo-figuration, with expressive and yet undefined figures.
