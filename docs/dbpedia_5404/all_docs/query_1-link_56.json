SPO - A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization6 Introduction Why a Book about SPO? Strengthening Participatory Organization (SPO) is one of the leading NGOs in Pakistan, a major voice in the development sector. Many people are familiar with SPO. Many have worked with it, many have benefited from its support. But for many others, SPO is an unknown entity. They do not know what it is: if they have heard it, they have only a vague idea of what it does. Or they are familiar with one aspect of its work, but unaware of the full scope of its interests and activities. What is Strengthening Participatory Organization (SPO)? What does it do? Where does it work? How is it different from other NGOs in Pakistan? How did SPO start? How has it evolved over the past decade? These are the questions that this book, produced to mark the first decade of SPO, seeks to answer. It tells the story of Strengthening Participatory Organization. It traces its development from a tiny NGO in 1994, to its current position as leading player in the development sector just ten years later. The history related in this book is one of achievements and progress, but also of weaknesses and challenges faced over the past decade. It is not a rose-tinted view, but a factual balanced account of an organization that has always welcomed constructive comments. This book will, of course, interest all those who know and have worked with SPO. It will be of interest to donors, NGOs, civil society groups, government bodies, and everyone else in the development sector. But hopefully, it will also interest the general reader, the ordinary Pakistani citizen. For this book tells a story that has lessons and resonance far beyond SPO stakeholders, and far beyond Pakistan. The story of one organization’s contribution to development in Pakistan is of interest to Pakistanis. The story of one organization’s effort to promote sustainable development in a developing country is of universal interest. The book has been written with the general reader in mind. Complete avoidance of the jargon of development would have been impossible, but every effort has been made to keep this to the minimum. While rich in\n\n9. SPO - A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 7 information, this is not a comprehensive encyclopedia of SPO from 1994 to the present day. The focus of this book is rather on telling a story: what SPO has done and how it has done it. This book tells the story of SPO. It is a remarkable story: we hope you enjoy reading it. A Decade of Work Strengthening Participatory Organization began life way back in the 1990s as the Small Projects Office of a CIDA programme in Pakistan. In 1994, the Small Projects Office was transformed into an indigenous NGO: its mission to promote sustainable development in Pakistan through capacity building of community-based organizations. The decade since that inception has seen many more transformations and developments. From its humble beginnings as a small and very new NGO in 1994, Strengthening Participatory Organization has grown to become one of the leading NGOs in Pakistan – in terms of its size and resources, the scope of its activities, its reach across the country, and the impact of its work. The past decade has seen SPO refine its mission, and correspondingly its programme activities. SPO’s core expertise – capacity building of community based organizations – has remained so, but has been improved with features like Participatory Development Coalitions, an expanded workshop curriculum, regional focal persons, and so on. Gender sensitization and female empowerment have also become core SPO areas, promoted through capacity building, female education and SPO’s own implementation of gender equality. Devolution reform at the turn of the century paved the way for SPO to engage with and build capacities of local government institutions. This is just one example of how SPO’s programme work has evolved and expanded to meet needs: of the people of Pakistan, of donors, and so on. Its support for rehabilitation of flood-hit areas and for education reform are two other examples. Over the course of ten years, SPO has become a major voice in the non- governmental sector in Pakistan. The organization has promoted and used that voice effectively. Always seeing itself as one of many development stakeholders with common goals and a vision that can best be achieved\n\n10. SPO - A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization8 through collaboration, SPO has actively sought to foster links with other NGOs, government and donors. Its ten-year history shows remarkable progress in this endeavour. SPO’s growing strength as a contributor to sustainable development in Pakistan stems – in considerable measure – from its growing strength as an organization. Reading through the ten years of SPO’s history, one of the features that most stands out is its constant stress on improvement: on introspection and evaluation, on internal capacity building, on developing systems and processes to improve its functioning, on willingness to take – indeed, to actively seek – advice from others. This remarkable drive to do better – to never be complacent and rest on its laurels – is perhaps the key to explaining how SPO has got to where it is today. Implicit and inherent in the striving for improvement, is the stress on quality. This is what stands out in SPO’s programme activities: an obsession with doing things properly. Not aiming for immediate, short-term results, but doing the spadework: building capacities, fostering networks, raising awareness – for long-term, sustainable impacts. SPO’s stress on quality is seen throughout the past decade, both in its programme work, and in its own operations and processes. Overview of SPO This book traces the development of SPO and gives full information about the organization, but it would still be useful for readers to have an overview at the outset. When considering any organization, especially in the development sector, three core questions come to mind: What is it trying to do? [What are its goals and objectives?] How is it set up to achieve those objectives? [What approach has it taken?] What is it doing? [What are its results, impact?] What is SPO trying to do? The organization’s mission statement answers this question: ‘To strengthen and support community organizations and public interest institutions of Pakistan for the benefits of poor and disadvantaged sections of society for sustainable development through a participatory approach.’\n\n11. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 9 How is SPO set up to do this? SPO is a national civil society organization. Its main centre is in Islamabad, but it has regional offices in Multan, Hyderabad, Peshawar and Quetta, and liaison offices in Karachi and Lahore. The major programme offices are in Turbat and D.I.Khan besides temporary project offices in smaller towns. The National Centre’s role is to co -ordinate activities of all its regional centres and in addition to its corporate functions provides technical support and guidance on issues such as programme policies, strategies, funding and networking. The Regional Centres are directly responsible for implementing SPO's strategy in the field. SPO is run by a number of different forums, with defined roles and responsibilities, working together. Between them these forums define the overall mission and direction of the organization, agree its approach and business plan, run SPO and implement its programs. These diverse forums are the General Body, Board of Directors, the SPO Senior Management Committee and the Advisory Council. In addition to these there are of course the SPO staff – currently numbering 120 full-time and 140 temporary project staff. “The voluntary dimension: a notable feature of SPO” SPO’s governance lies in the hands of a 14-member Board of Directors (BoD), 13 elected members and the Chief Executive. Members of the Board – as well as the General Body - are carefully selected to include a wide range of citizens with relevant social development experience and to equally represent all provinces while maintaining a gender balance. The commitment of the members of the General Body of SPO to the cause of development goes beyond a ceremonial form to become a practical and purposeful contribution in actual work situations. For example, in addition to participation in annual or in special meetings of the General Body, members actively participate in local and regional conferences as well as in meetings of the regional project approval committees. The Board of Directors of SPO meets once every 3 to 4 months and conducts a comprehensive review of SPO’s work and its plans, often posing conceptual and critical questions without at the same time becoming intrusive or obstructive. All such support is provided on a voluntary basis to combine with the full- time professional attributes of SPO staff to make for a truly special and highly effective combination.\n\n12. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization10 The SPO Management Committee (SMC), comprising senior managers in the organization, oversees general management issues and develops SPO’s detailed policies and procedures. These include the hiring and termination policy, gender policy, procurement policy, etc. Board and senior management have a clear understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities. SPO is also guided by an Advisory Council that includes representatives of the BoD, contributing donors and government agencies. The Council provides a forum for the government and donors to voice their views on SPO’s policies and direction. It serves to link SPO with the Government of Pakistan as well as with donors on matters of policy development and plans for social sector development. Another SPO ‘forum’ are the Programme Management Review Meetings, held twice a year to decide on programme related issues and make recommendations for operational and policy level issues. All members of SPO’s management as well as programme staff attend these meetings. These are the official SPO forums, but the organization recognizes all its stakeholders as partners. The key stakeholders of SPO are partner communities, local development institutions including community-based organizations, women’s groups, local government institutions, civil society networks, academia, donors and other support organizations. SPO engages all key stakeholders in the review of strategic direction. Who pays for SPO? SPO began life as a wholly donor-funded organization (CIDA). In the ten years since then it has attracted more donor funding, from a wider range of contributors. These include Action Aid, the European Union, the Royal Netherlands Embassy, Save the Children, DfID, the Asia Foundation, UNDP and USAID. But it has also been successful in generating its own resources. SPO is increasingly looking to increase its financial strength and reduce its dependence on donor funds. SPO’s financial strength is already considerable – its annual budget in FY 2004-5 is Rs. 162 millions. SPO is actively pursuing expansion in its indigenous resource base. Recently, it obtained tax exemption for its local donors. Donors of time, skills and resources are members of the General body and the Board of Directors of SPO. If the value of their time were to be estimated in\n\n13. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 11 consonance with the high level of professional excellence and respect that each member enjoys in his or her respective field, the value would be very substantive. The high value of a non-cash contribution to SPO contrasts well with the fact that the cost of organizing meetings of the General Body and the Board of Directors does not exceed one per cent of the total cost of operating SPO as an organization. What is SPO doing? The main activities conducted by SPO are: • Capacity Building of Development Institutions for Good Governance (CBOs, Women Organizations, Local Bodies); • Social Sector Project Funding (CBOs, WDOs); • Civil Society Networks Strengthening; • Partnering others in social sector projects. These activities are determined by SPO’s mission statement, but also – more specifically – by the political, economic and social context in which SPO works. Capacity building of community organizations is the key to sustainable development and poverty alleviation. But SPO has responded to devolution reform and the introduction of the local government system by building capacities of local governments. The economic context that SPO has to address is one of poverty – urban and rural. Tied up with these issues are ‘cultural issues’ like discrimination against women. SPO actively works to address these ‘cultural’ problems. The Development Planning and Management Program (DPM) could be described as the ‘flagship’ SPO capacity-building activity. Started in SPO’s first year, the DPM program has been refined and expanded to meet the growing needs of community-based organizations. Hundreds of CBOs have benefited from the DPM training, and from its spin-offs like Participatory Development Coalitions, the grassroot civil society networks. SPO started life as the Small Projects Office, dispensing funds from the Social Sector Fund. That role has continued over the past decade, both through dispersal from the Social Sector Fund and through SPO’s own choti funding. The DPM training prepares CBOs to manage their own funds and projects. SPO has always placed great importance on network strengthening. This applies to the CBOs that it trains, and to other NGOs, donors and the\n\n14. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization12 government. SPO – as its name indicates – is strongly committed to including all stakeholders, and working with all partners and players in promoting sustainable development. The organization’s efforts to date include promoting clusters of CBOs, interacting with other NGOs and government on the NGO Bill and devolution of power process, and holding provincial and national dialogues with other NGOs and government on ‘Local Initiatives in Development’. SPO’s national reach, its experience with community-based organizations, its extensive skills in capacity development are some of the factors that make the organization an attractive partner for other donors working in the development sector. SPO has worked on numerous collaborative projects with donors and partners. The projects cover a range of social sector issues, including women’s development, basic education and emergency relief. SPO is very cognizant of the need to become a self-sufficient organization, not dependent on donor funding for its work. It sees its skills and experience as a marketable commodity that can be used to mobilize resources at the same time as promoting its core objective of sustainable development. SPO’s Place in the Development Sector How is SPO different from other NGOs in Pakistan? What marks it out? Why is SPO considered a leading voice in the development sector? In 2004, a survey of donors was carried out to identify the strengths and weaknesses of SPO. The answers given by staff in the Japan Embassy, Save the Children UK, Canada Fund, Khushhali Bank and Asia Foundation give a good insight into its strengths: “SPO’s outreach is its major strength. SPO’s regional representation makes it a true voice of Pakistani civil society. It has brought a lot of marginalized communities into the development arena and the people mobilized by SPO are real people” “… acknowledged is SPO’s co ntribution in formation and mobilization of women groups. SPO’s district and sub-district groups are considered a major strength by other actors in civil society”\n\n15. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 13 “…SPO has a clear advantage over other organizations as it has a niche. When you go to the field, people talk about SPO. It has reached out to the places where other NGOs and donors have not reached. SPO has the ability to make real partnerships due to its rootedness, when you look at some other NGOs, the relationship is more on client-patron pattern.’ Working with people and communities right at the grassroots level, working with women, promoting networks, building capacities – promoting development where it is most needed: these are the strengths of SPO. When viewed holistically – in terms of the scope of its work and reach, its approach, its impact, its institutional strength – it really is hard to think of a comparable NGO in Pakistan. SPO has made a niche in the development sector that truly belongs to SPO. Outline of the Book This book tells a chronological story: each chapter details one year in the life of SPO. The first chapter describes the origins of SPO and how it came about. The next ten chapters describe each of the ten years that SPO has been working. There are two core themes running through the book: SPO’s development on the programme side, and its own institutional and organizational development. The former focuses on SPO’s contribution to development in Pakistan: the kinds of areas in which SPO has worked, the activities it has undertaken, how these have changed over time, the impact of these, and so on. The latter - SPO’s own development - follows its expansion and strengthening as an organization. It traces the role played by SPO’s forums, notably the Board of Directors, the SPO Management Committee and the Advisory Council. It shows how SPO has adapted to meet the challenges it faced, and to match and address the needs of its programme activities. Each chapter ends with a list of ‘SPO Achievements’ – both on the programme side, and in terms of SPO’s own development. These are also detailed in two summary chapters: one giving SPO’s achievements after five years, the second its achievements after ten years. These chapters serve to place the work done by SPO in each year within a ‘big picture’ context.\n\n16.

SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 15 Tables and boxes have been used throughout the book to give detailed information for those who would like it, whilst not detracting from the core story that will interest the general reader. Each chapter also features case studies that highlight the ‘on ground’ ‘personal’ impact of SPO’s work: stories like the Participatory Development Coalition that helped secure justice for innocent villagers, and the housewife who gained a voice and respect through the financial empowerment she secured from choti funding. Chronological history, information tables, explanatory boxes, personal case studies, achievements – all these together make up the story of SPO.\n\n18. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization16 1985–1994 The Journey Begins PO did not start off as ‘Strengthening Participatory Organization’. Its original role was limited and temporary: to function as the Small Projects Technical Support Office (SPTSO)—later known as the ‘Small Projects Office’—for the Social Sector Funds (SSF) Project of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). But in the eight years that followed, the Small Projects Office acquired a life and niche of its own. By the end of this period, it had transformed into an independent organization working for a different and deeper mandate than the one with which it had begun. This chapter recounts SPO’s eight-year growth to maturity and transformation from a small, project support office to a prominent contributor to participatory development in Pakistan. The Social Sector Funds Project The Social Sector Funds Project was initiated in Pakistan through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Governments of Pakistan and Canada in December 1985. The MoU provided for the establishment of a ‘Small Projects Technical Support Office’ (SPTSO) to administer funds to NGOs and community self-help groups and to provide them with technical support services. This Office was to be financed for the first three years out of $4.5m CIDA contribution. For the next two years, it was to be supported by a contribution from $15m fund dedicated to Annual Development Plan (government) projects. The initial experience of CIDA determined that it was not enough to simply extend the duration of the Project, which had faced take-off delays as well. SPO had to be regenerated with a vision of what it might become. S\n\n19. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 17 Enter Cowater International On May 1, 1991, CIDA contracted Cowater International as the Canadian Executing Agency (CEA). Cowater’s specialization in institutional development and community infrastructure projects and its established presence in Pakistan particularly recommended it for this position. In addition, the organization was generally familiar with the SSF Project, having provided technical assistance to SPO in establishing its financial system. Cowater’s entry as CEA coincided with a change in SPO’s leadership. For the three months during which SPO’s new Director, Mr. Ralph McKim, was selected and oriented, Dr. Michael McGarry, a Cowater Principal, discharged the responsibilities of this position. Strategic Shifts Cowater International presented a status report and initial work plan for 1991–93, which was approved by CIDA. This document also looked at issues and possibilities related to the long-term future of SPO. Importantly, the work plan was based on a revised Logical Framework Analysis (LFA). The associated Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) cut out two major activities of SPO’s previous WBS i.e. the development of SSF infrastructure and support of SSF use for government’s Annual Development Plan (ADP) projects. In their place, Cowater added two other activity areas: strengthening of NGOs’ development capacity and long-term sustainability of SPO. The first of these new activities marked a strategic shift in SPO’s intervention approach. The organization co nfronted the fact that most of its partner organizations lacked the capacity to systematically plan and effectively implement development initiatives, and, as such, were unable to make effective use of the financial resources provided to them. If the desired impacts of the SSF Project were to be achieved, the route to them would have to change. SPO decided to make capacity building its core intervention area. Thenceforth, it would fund its partners only after preparing them to manage their projects for optimal benefits.\n\n20. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization18 The second new activity in the WBS, which concerned the long-term design of SPO, was also a dramatic shift in institutional direction. From project- specific funds dispensation and technical support, SPO was now positioning itself for a permanent and autonomous role in the country. Programme after 1991 As SPO shifted its strategy towards capacity building, its programme and structure underwent major modifications. Key changes after 1991 included: Reduced emphasis on small project funding Increased emphasis on the organizational capacity building of CBOs Reduction in the expectations of larger, intermediary NGOs Direct contact with CBOs and use of a cluster approach to increase their local networking A modified approach to serving as resource and information base for NGOs Establishment of an information system that would facilitate process monitoring at all levels, provide insights in the CBO capacity building process and results, and enable accountability Decentralization of SPO so that the Regional Centres are strengthened and program and administrative responsibility are incrementally shifted from the National Centre The introduction of specialized capacity building programmes (such as the Village Education Program) to promote local initiatives in female basic education. The Development Planning and Management (DPM) Programme The most important initiative introduced by SPO, at this stage was Development Planning and Management (DPM) programme, intended to build the capacity of CBOs to plan, implement, manage, and monitor projects that responded to the development needs of their communities, and that were carried out in a manner that involved the equitable participation of all stakeholders.

It was to be conducted in ‘clusters’: each cluster comprising of six to eight geographically close rural organizations. Two or three members from each organization in the cluster would attend all three DPM workshops. After the approval of DPM modules and procedures, 12 SPO staff members and 8 Regional Resource Persons from local NGOs were trained, in order to develop a mechanism for ongoing support. [See Table 1 for workshop details]\n\n22.

Principally, the SMC comprised senior managers in the organization, chaired by the SPO Director.\n\n23. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 21 Establishment of a Decentralized Structure SPO set up four Regional Centres, one for each province, at Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta and Hyderabad. These were in addition to a National Centre in Islamabad and a sub-centre for female education in Turbat, Makran. The foundations of decentralized operations were laid from the start. In each region, Regional Directors and two Programme Coordinators led the SPO Programme. The aim was that the National Centre would gradually change its role to strategic planning, coordination, management, and administrative functions. Public Information System SPO initiated efforts to develop a public information system dedicated to spreading awareness about development issues to the general public. It established a Development Resource Centre (DRC) at the National Centre, containing books, manuals, and other reference materials. SPO added databases on CDS/ISIS to the DRC. The database contained information about more than 8,733 Pakistani NGOs. The Human Resource Database offered information on 104 resource persons. The Support Organizations Database had information about 50 support agencies; and the Resource Material Database contained 721 resource materials on Education, Communication, Agriculture, Health, Women, Children, etc. A bid for continuation Alongside the programme and organization strengthening activities, Cowater expedited efforts to finalize SPO’s long-term design. Input from CIDA led to, in effect, a joint proposal that was approved by CIDA for circulation to the Government of Pakistan on 22 June 1993. The proposal outlined SPO’s mission, strategies, niche, accountability, sustainability, governance and transition plan. Specifically it sought the government’s approval for the following decisions: • “That SPO continues beyond 1993 and that it become a registered non- governmental organization fully managed by Pakistani personnel by June 1993.” • “That the present governing structure of a Joint Committee, consisting of Economic Affairs Division (EAD) and CIDA be replaced by an independent Board of Directors (BoDs); EAD’s and CIDA’s views would continue to be channelled through a new Advisory Committee.” • Setting up an Advisory Committee “…to assist the SPO BoDs obtain information and analysis of GoP and donor policies and plans for social\n\n24. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization22 sector development. The Advisory Committee will help the Board of Directors assess the appropriateness of its policies and the effectiveness of their implementation.” Initially, the Advisory Committee would have the same members as the current Joint Committee, with a provision to include representatives of other active donors of SPO as they came on Board of Directors. In November 2002, EAD approved the long-term design proposal and extended the SSF Project until January 1994, giving SPO the impetus it needed to continue and complete its development into an indigenous organization. Countdown to Rebirth In January 1993, SPO initiated four activities critical to realizing its long-term design: the formation of a group of individuals to conceptualise and implement the transition from, and transformation of, the Small Projects Office to Strengthening Participatory Organisation as an authentically representative body in context with the grassroots. This was also initiated to interview a large number of candidates for the post of Associate Director; selection of a Board of Directors; and registration. Associate Director’s Recruitment SPO’s Associate Director was to become its Executive Director after the organization obtained registration. To find the best candidate for this pivotal position, Dr. McGarry, invited a number of prominent people to join him on the interview panel: Ms. Ferida Sher – Development Consultant and mid-term evaluator of SPO; Mr. Javed Jabbar – Former Senator, Communication Entrepreneur, and founder of a rural NGO (Baanhn Beli); Dr. Hafiz Pasha – Economist, Academic, Consultant to CIDA and Advisor to the Prime Minister. The panel unanimously recommended Dr. Suleman Shaikh, who joined SPO in the first week of April 1993.\n\n25. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 23 SPO’s first BoD Though selection of SPO’s Board of Directors (BoD) was the prerogative of SPO’s Joint Committee, SPO programme and senior administrative staff were also invited to contribute their suggestions. Nominations were short-listed with the aim of selecting a balanced Board of Directors in terms of regional, gender, and sectoral representation. In early April 1993, the SPO Director wrote to the final 12 candidates, inviting them to consider Board of Directors membership. All the candidates accepted the offer to help lead the organization, and readily cooperated in its registration activities. The 12 nominees became the founding Board of Directors of Directors of SPO. Registration Efforts for registration commenced on 3 January 1993, and included preparation of SPO’s draft Memorandum and Articles of Association (using its original Memorandum of Understanding); the 1989 Plan of Operation; 1992–93 Work Plan and Budget; long-term design proposal; and promotional brochure. After negotiating a range of legal and administrative requirements, SPO obtained its registration certificate in January 1994. The Dawn of SPO SPO formally came into being as a national capacity building organization on January 15, 1994. The Corporate Law Authority, Islamabad under the Companies Act of 1984, registered it under guarantee as a non-profit company. Its mission was “To strengthen rural CBOs to assist poorer and disadvantaged sections of the communities to achieve their own goals by using a participatory approach to sustainable development.” First Board of Director’s Meeting SPO’s Board of Directors met for the first time on 26 January 1994. Its 12 members included; Mr. Tariq Banuri (Chairperson), Mrs. Rashida Akhlaque, (Vice Chairperson), Ms. Shahla Zia (Islamabad), Ms. Ferida Sher (Lahore), Dr. Waseem Azhar (Lahore), Mr. Vincent David (Lahore), Ms. Zarnigar A. Tayyab (Peshawar), Ms. Farhat Khan (Peshawar), Ms. Quratul Ain Bakhtiari (Quetta), Mr. Haji Saifullah Paracha (Quetta), Mr. Javed Jabbar (Karachi) and Mr. Haji Jalal Khan (Turbat).\n\n26. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization24 According to the terms of reference for the Board of Directors, it was decided that the responsibility to provide direction and financial control of SPO activities lies with SPO Board of Directors of Directors and the Chief Executive, by virtue of the authority vested in him, by the Board of Directors of Directors. It was also agreed that the Board of Directors, in consultation with SPO staff, including the Chief Executive, the Operations Manager, the Financial Manager, the Deputy Director and the Programme Support Director would establish policy as it relates to all aspects of SPO administration and project delivery. The Chief Executive would provide work plans and budgets for approval by the Board of Directors of Directors. The Board of Directors of Directors approves personnel decisions, in principle. In practice, the Board of Directors was expected to delegate to the Chief Executive the responsibility for developing personnel policies, recruitment and staff appointment. It was the responsibility of the Board of Directors to undertake long term planning in consultation with the Advisory Committee, the Chief Executive, and his associates. Strategic and long-term planning was considered a critical and integral feature of the SPO programme, relying heavily on the on going gathering and processing of the Learning Information System, which provides feedback on the effectiveness of the SPO Programme. The Board of Directors would approve Project Proposals submitted by partner organizations and finalized by the regional management. As well as being briefed about their Terms of Reference, a number of fundamental decisions were taken at this historic meeting: • Dr. Suleman Shaikh was formally appointed as Chief Executive of SPO and Mr. M. Ghani Khan Marwat as the Company Secretary. • M/S Azam Choudhary Law Associates were appointed as SPOs legal advisors while M/S Taseer Hadi Khalid and Company were appointed as auditors. • In place of the previous Joint Committee, a four-member Project Approval Committee (PAC) was constituted to award Social Sector Fund (SSF) grants for small projects.\n\n27. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 25 • An Advisory Committee was constituted comprising representatives of donors and the Government of Pakistan, and the SPO Board of Directors Chairperson. • A Planning Committee was constituted to assist SPO in seeking financial assistance from donors Initial members Ms. Shahla Zia, Dr. Tariq Banuri and Ms. Ferida Sher could co -opt other members whenever necessary. Rules of Business for SPO membership were discussed in the meeting where it was decided that the fee for SPO membership should be PKR 100 and that membership should be by invitation by a member of the BoD. Achievements by 1994 By January 1994, SPO made significant progress on a number of fronts. Key accomplishments included: Capacity Building Capacity building had become established as SPO’s core intervention. The Development Planning and Management (DPM) Programme had been developed and trained field staff had conducted DPM workshops for 139 representatives of 58 CBOs. Social Sector Fund The organization implemented and managed 99 community-based development projects in different sectors. Institutional Strengthening SPO’s greatest achievement was its transition from the ‘Small Projects Office’ to ‘Strengthening Participatory Organization’. But also important was the establishment of a decentralized structure comprising four Regional Centres (one in each province), a National Centre in Islamabad and a sub-centre for female education in Turbat. Public Information System SPO initiated efforts to develop a public information system dedicated to spreading awareness about development issues to the general public. Key among these was the establishment of a Development Resource Centre (DRC) at the National Centre.\n\n28. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization26 1994-1995 New Partnerships n its first year as an indigenous organization, SPO found a number of partners to support its mission. As it built its linkages with other NGOs in the country, the organization quickly found itself becoming a platform and coordinator for their collaborations. As the DPM programme unfolded, its relevance and impact became clearer, fuelling the organization’s commitment to capacity building. At the same time, its close interaction with communities compelled SPO to find ways to address development issues that did not fall within the ambit of the DPM programme, but which, owing to their urgency and importance, could not be ignored by a responsible institution working for the betterment of a primarily rural society. Thus, SPO became involved in two projects focusing on female literacy in Makran and Nowshera, and another project for the reclamation of agricultural land in Sindh. Alongside its programme activities, SPO worked consistently to build its own institutional capacity, improving its monitoring arrangements, training its team, and refining its governance and management. Defining Moments: An Agreement with CIDA On 1 April 1994, SPO signed a formal contribution agreement with CIDA. The agreement was significant because it clarified the objectives of SPO, the purposes of the SPO programme, and the organization’s three ‘outputs’ against which its performance was to be monitored. SPO’s objectives were defined as follows: “The Organization has recently evolved into an institution whose principal mandate is to increase capacity of existing village organizations to become effective local development agencies in poverty alleviation. The organization’s particular emphasis is to help these organizations transform from a welfare orientation, which reinforces dependency, into a participatory process, which promotes self-help and sustainable development.” I\n\n29. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 27 The three main purposes of the SPO Programme were: • Raising the participation of the rural poor in community development processes; • Motivating and strengthening CBOs and other support agents to engage their community members in addressing their development needs; • Building SPO into a self-sustaining organization. The three output areas against which the CIDA-funded component of the SPO Programme was to be monitored, evaluated , and reported were: 1. CBOs Strengthened - defined as capacity building carried out for clusters of partner organizations (CBOs) by means of consultation, training, project preparation, funding and monitoring in each of Pakistan’s four provinces. By the end of the fifth year of SPO’s operations, there were to be 242 organizations that had received CIDA-funded inputs through SPO’s capacity building cycle. [See Box 5.] 2. Learning Information System (LIS) - SPO’s information system for monitoring, evaluation and learning, this was to enable SPO to assess its performance accurately and learn from its experiences. LIS included institutionalization of a process of monitoring and applying lessons; adaptation and experimentation; and applied research and data dissemination. 3. SPO’s organizational strengthening – this output envisaged the growth of SPO as a viable Pakistani NGO through development of effective systems for managing, administering and sustaining the organization at the national and regional levels. Tangible targets were set for each of these output areas. New Partners and Future of Funding • From the outset, SPO initiated efforts with a number of donors (especially the European Union) to diversify its funding base, an aim that was also envisaged in its agreement with its principle donor, CIDA. • Based on its own considerations and SPO’s initial discussions with donors, CIDA developed a ‘timeline’ for its support for SPO: In the first fiscal year (FY-1), CIDA agreed to support all Regional Centres, as well as a special SPO initiative, the Village Education Project in Balochistan. By the end of FY-1, EU funding for the Sindh and NWFP Regional Centres would be online.\n\n30. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization28 By FY-3, other donors would provide funding for the Balochistan Regional Centre and the VEP programme. From FY1 to FY-5, CIDA would fund the Punjab Regional Centre. From FY-1 to FY-3, CIDA would provide full funding for SPO’s National Centre’s programme support, overall management, and institutional strengthening efforts. In FY-4, donors other than CIDA would provide 25 percent of funding for the National Centre. In FY-5, donors other than CIDA would provide 50 percent of proposed funding for the National Centre. The following table summarizes the funding anticipated by SPO during its first five years, based on the CIDA funding timeline and its own cost projections.

SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 29 Progress Under the DPM Programme By 1994 SPO had tested its keynote Development Planning and Management Programme with 13 initial clusters in all four provinces. In 1994–95, SPO formed seven new clusters of DPM participants, details of which are presented in the following table. New DPM Clusters Formed in 1994–95 Region Cluster (No. of CBOs in Cluster) NWFP Abbottabad (14), Swabi (24) Balochistan Kalat (6), Muslim Bagh (7) Punjab Wazirabad (9) Sindh Ghotki (8), Shikarpur (10) By June 1995, SPO had trained 414 representatives of about 150 CBOs situated in all four provinces of Pakistan. 1994–95 also marked the year when the first group of DPM graduates emerged, comprising the 13 clusters formed during the testing phase. The following table provides the locations of these clusters, and the numbers of the participating CBOs and individuals.

SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization30 Learning Information System Foundations Laid SPO initiated work on its Learning Information System (LIS) right away. LIS was envisaged as a computerized system for monitoring, information processing and analysis, and information generation, to be used in developing and improving the DPM Programme. To begin system’s development, SPO appointed a Programme Specialist-LIS, who started designing the basic data collection formats. By the end of SPO’s first year, majority of the formats had been developed, while the rest were under way. In addition, the following tasks were prioritised in order to achieve a fully operational LIS: a. Information Collection: The data sent in from field offices to SPO Regional and National Centres would be entered into the computer in the relevant fields. b. Information Processing: The first set of data fed into the system about each CBO or initiative would constitute the baseline. There would be a tool to enable comparison of subsequent entries with this baseline to assess actual accomplishments, as well as needs and expectations. c. Information Analysis and Output Generation: Retrieval of the stored information would be possible in a number of output formats designed to help monitor progress and make strategic decisions. Special Programmes During 1994, SPO initiated three special projects to respond to community needs that did not lie within the purview of its mainstream programme, but which demanded the organization’s attention owing to their gravity and urgency. Two of these projects, the Village Education Programme (VEP) in Makran (Balochistan) and the Integrated Basic Education Project (IBEP) in Nowshera (NWFP), aimed at removing gender inequities in education. The third project was the Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP), which were broadly related to SPO’s aims in that it addressed critical infrastructure concerns in rural Sindh.\n\n33. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 31 Village Education Programme (VEP) The Village Education Programme was initiated by SPO in Makran in 1994, in response to the deplorable state of female literacy in the area. Its objective was to motivate and mobilize women in Turbat to promote female literacy. The first stage in the programme was the organization of Women Education Committees to lead female local literacy efforts. This entailed the capacity building of women with workshops. At some of these, in areas where female literacy was only 1 percent, creative communication methods had to be used, such as the use of symbols. Women learned about CBO management, the status of women, and establishing and running non-formal literacy centers. Subsequently, the partner organizations established literacy centres that eventually offered functional literacy courses as well as accelerated non-formal primary education. VEP also helped local communities form village groups called Anjuman Zanana Taleem (AZTs) to provide a village level platform to oversee female education. Non-formal literacy programmes were used as the entry point for AZTs to become involved in their communities’ overall development. During 1994–95, One hundred women completed a basic education course in VEP. Basic Education Process was started in Baleecha cluster through Anjuman Zanana Taleem’s (AZTs) of Baleecha, Raeesabad, Mirabad, Asiabad and Nazarabad. Five teachers’ training centres were established and a workshop on teacher training was held. The Embassy of Japan agreed to support the construction of Female Education Centre in Turbat. The process and the construction of the building were initiated . In this programme, SPO’s Coordinators helped the AZTs to; Assess the need, opportunities and difficulties of upgrading female education through a non-formal process; Look at alternatives, i.e., different approaches to female development through education which have been successful elsewhere; Identify/provide resources, including technical as well as financial resources; Plan and manage a community-based non-formal education programme; Draw on resources available from the community, government and/or other agencies to ensure sustainability; and Transform themselves into mainstream, broad-based female development organizations.\n\n34. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization32 Integrated Basic Education Programme To promote non-formal female education in the rural areas, the United Nations Children’s Education Fund (UNICEF) launched this programme in November 1994. It was aimed to promote female education in the rural areas by increasing village awareness about the need to increase female education for sustainable development. The programme intended to mobilize the local community to actively promote basic female education, and to form groups that could be trained and structured into Village Education Committees (VECs), responsible for monitoring female education provision in the village. The latter measure would help bring about the attitude changes required to sustain female education initiatives after the programme ended. The programme also aimed to identify non-functional schools in its target areas and assist in making them functional again. In 1994 SPO began implementing the IBEP programme in Nowshera, NWFP, working in close cooperation with UNICEF and local representatives of the NWFP Education Department. A field team was provided training in Participatory Rural Appraisal, to help it mobilize community participation on the sensitive issue of female education in Nowshera. In addition, a one-day training on health and hygiene issues was conducted for women of Balakot. Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP) Under the aegis of SCARP, the World Bank extended funds to the Government of Sindh for the installation and maintenance of 30 tube wells in the district of Moro-Sakrand, Sindh. The tube wells were intended to reduce the problem of waterlogging and salinity, which had gravely impacted the area’s agricultural productivity. SPO was engaged to encourage community involvement in this project by forming and training Farmers’ Associations responsible for the installation and maintenance of the tube wells. In 1994, SPO conducted a training workshop for SCARP project staff and identified CBOs in Sakrand District, Nawabshah, for training. Settling into Civil Society In its first year as an indigenous organization, SPO reached out to a host of NGOs to forge institutional linkages within civil society. Far from being at the\n\n35. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 33 periphery of NGO collaborations as a relatively new organization, SPO soon found itself playing a galvanizing role at the hub of joint actions. In facilitating civil society collaborations, the organization was probably helped by its own pervasive culture of participatory processes; its energy and enthusiasm as a new organization; and its combination of direct contact with communities and a national reach and perspective. During 1994–95, SPO led an NGO coalition to increase awareness about the controversial NGO Bill, and chalked out ways to safeguard the interests of NGOs in Pakistan. SPO office served as secretariat for the campaign against the Bill, and was responsible for gathering information about the Bill and distributing it to NGOs everywhere. Representatives from organizations all over the country came to regular meetings at the National Centre, where a sound rapport developed among them and useful amendments to the draft Bill were agreed upon. The NGO Bill and the campaign against it had highlighted the need for platforms for the protection of NGO rights. Thus, in the wake of the campaign, a number of regional NGO networks were formed. SPO played a major role in the formation and subsequent operation of these groups, which included Balochistan NGOs Federation (BNGOF), Sarhad NGO Ittehad (SNI), Punjab NGOs Coordination Council (PNCC) and Sindh NGOs Federation (SNGOF). To introduce itself to others, SPO also published its first profile—a brochure entitled “An Approach to Participatory Development”, which focused on SPO’s programme, documenting its earlier achievements as a project, the process of its transformation into a local NGO, and its new philosophy. Governance and Management 1994–95 was a busy year for various administrative and management bodies that had been set up at SPO to look after the organization’s institutional development. In addition, SPO devoted itself to developing the skills and knowledge of its own team. Board of Directors SPO’s Board of Directors met six times during 1994–95. Two key decisions were made to increase the number of Directors from 12 to 14, in order to provide equal representation to Balochistan on the Board. And the\n\n36. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization34 constitution of Regional Projects Approval Committees (RPACs) to expedite the process of project approval for support from the Social Sector Fund were constituted. Each RPAC included the Board members of the region, and the director of the regional SPO office. During the year, the founding Board of Directors invited 22 new members on to the General Body (GB), thereby increasing it's strength from 12 to 34. The first elections for a new BOD were held on December 17, 1994. Those elected for a term of three years became SPO's second BOD. The names of the members of the first elected Board of Directors for the period December 1994 to December 1997 included: Mr. Javed Jabbar (Chairperson) Ms Farhat Khan (Vice Chairperson) Ms. Ferida Sher Mr. Omar Asghar Khan Prof. Dr. Karamat Ali Dr. Tufail Mohammad Ms. Baela Jamil Syed Abid Rizvi Ms. Sadiqa Salahuddin Dr. Qurat-ul-Ain Bakhtiari Mr. Noor Ahmed Nizamani Mr. Mohammad Amin Dr. Tasleem Akhtar In keeping with the SPO Articles of Association, the new Board met immediately after the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Mr Javed Jabbar was elected as Chairperson while Ms. Farhat Khan and Dr. Suleman Shaikh were reappointed as Vice Chairperson and Chief Executive respectively. SPO Management Committee Five meetings of the SPO Management Committee (SMC) were held. Apart from routine quarterly progress reviews and donors’ updates, the SMC approved the SPO organogram and decided that an SPO newsletter would be published every six months to keep CBOs and other NGOs informed about the activities of the organization. Programme Review Meeting (PRM) In 1993, SPO’s Project Review Committee was dissolved as the project transformed into an organization. In the Committee’s last meeting, it was decided that it would be replaced with a biannual “Programme Review Meeting” (PRM), where programme coordinators and other programme staff outside the ambit of the SMC could join the senior management to discuss and resolve issues affecting SPO. During the year, two PRMs were held, which discussed:\n\n37. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 35 • Staff issues, e.g. job descriptions, interpersonal relations, • SPO Programme strategies, emphasizing the point that capacity building had become the cornerstone of these. • SPO’s evolving internal monitoring system and concept of Learning Information System The forum also clarified the roles and responsibilities of the National Centre, as against the Regional Centres. It was proposed that the National Centre should look after issues relating to financial Control and accountability, standardized monitoring system, programme coordination, development of system/bylaws/updating, cCoordination of Board of Directors, Information dissemination, Staff development and overall management/Direction Advisory Council On 6 February 1995, first meeting of the Advisory Council was held at the National Centre. It was co-chaired by Mr. Farhat Hussain (Joint Secretary, Economic Affairs Division (EAD) and Ms. Margaret Paterson (Counsellor – Development of the Canadian High Commission). Developing the Team Key staff development activities during the year included a four-day orientation workshop on gender development conducted by Ms. Ferida Sher, an SPO Director, and a one-day workshop on conflict resolution, conducted by Dr. Tariq Banuri, who was the Chairperson of the Board in June 1994. Both events were conducted for all programme staff. Finance During the year, SPO was transformed from a bilateral project into a national- level NGO. The organization carried out its first audit as NGO this year. Its balance sheet footing was PKR 43 million, whereas owned assets had a net worth of PKR 7.8 million (at cost) with operating expenses of PKR. 25.67 million. In this year, the government of Pakistan transferred PKR 20.7 million from assignment account to SPO account as per agreement with the government of Canada. To finance construction of a women training center in Turbat, SPO negotiated with the government of Japan this year. Furthermore, SPO began partnerships with Swiss NGO Programme Office (SNPO), Kalam Integrated Development project in NWFP and Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP) in Sindh.\n\n38. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization36 Administrative Decisions Ever since its birth, foundations of decentralized operations at SPO were laid down with four regional centres, one in each province, at Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta and Hyderabad. In addition, a National Center in Islamabad was also established to gradually change its role to strategic planning, coordination, management, and administrative functions. Later, a sub-center for female education in Turbat, Mekran was set up. Dr. Muhammad Suleman Shaikh was the first Chief Executive of SPO. Regional Directors (RDs), with support from two Programme Coordinators, led the regional programmes. Two major organizational shifts that took place at the National Centre this year were; firstly, due to the departure of the Programme Support Director in October 1994 and the post and the unit was reorganized and; two new positions of Programme Specialists Technical Support and Programme Specialist LIS were introduced. The second shift was due to the departure of the Operations Director. This post was left vacant until COWATER Management Audit was completed and results shared with the Chief Executive and the Board of Directors (BOD). The role of the Operations Director as Company Secretary was reassigned to the Deputy Chief Executive during the BOD meeting. SPO continued to give emphasis to staff development, during the reporting period. A training policy was drafted and individual needs of the staff identified through assessment. In-house staff development initiatives included two workshops, training and an orientation programme while external initiatives included six trainings, six workshops, five conferences and three seminars. The staff had numerous opportunities for trainings directly by SPO or through nominations to courses arranged by other agencies. During the reporting period, SPO’s new organogram and three policy documents were finalized. Policies developed and approved by the SMC include: i) Crèche facility at SPO ii) Hiring of consultants iii) Financial policy and procedures In addition to this, existing policies were reviewed and updated according to operational needs of the organization.\n\n39. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 37 Achievements • Defining SPO’s objectives and purpose, as well as clear outputs to be achieved • Widening of the funding base • Expansion of the DPM Program, and the first DPM graduates • Introduction of a Learning Information System • Village Education Programme for female literacy in Balochistan • Integrated Basic Education Programme for female education in NWFP • Support to the Salinity Control and Reclamation Project • Extensive collaboration with Civil Society Organizations • SPO’s institutional strengthening and capacity building of staff\n\n40. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization38 1995-1996 Learning from Experience ith a year of programming behind it, SPO was in a position to take stock of its preliminary operations and their impact. The year from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 was a time of introspection and learning for the organization. Programme and management audits were conducted, corporate values defined, and further strategic planning carried out. Fine-tuning the Capacity Building Programme With its capacity building operations in full swing and preliminary impacts emerging, SPO could start assessing its performance in this area. Since the Learning Information System was in development and could not yet yield a full picture of SPO’s performance, a separate audit was carried out by the Deputy Chief Executive and Projects Support Coordinator. The major objective of this exercise was to gauge how well SPO was doing. It was intended to examine SPO’s capacity building process in detail, identify strengths and weaknesses in the process, and identify and explain any deviations or changes that had taken place in the programme. The audit report made a number of recommendations, mostly relating to SPO operational functioning. The audit suggested that SPO should; • Plan strategically and develop consensus guidelines for how the Programme Coordinators (PCs) should plan their workload and whether geographical demarcation in their activities was to be discarded. [This had already happened in Sindh, where PCs no longer worked separately in the northern and southern parts of the province, but were both working in the north, in some cases in the same districts.] W\n\n41. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 39 • After selecting a district, if SPO was unable to undertake surveys that provided a full picture of the status of the districts, then it should do away with them and concentrate on inputs and impacts of SPO’s interaction. • PCs should effectively document key information, rationales, observations, and decisions pertaining to their work – with supportive supervision provided by the Regional Directors (RDs). Documentation should be as brief as possible but clearly convey the observations that led to the decisions taken. • PCs and RDs should define and accept their relative roles and responsibilities and work within that framework to ensure maximum effectiveness (e.g. for a proposal, communication or training to a CBO). • If SPO’s primary responsibility was to CBOs, greater efforts should be made to keep promises made to them, especially in terms of planned visits. Conflicting priorities of SPO, which impinged on commitments made to CBOs, should be carefully examined for justification. • Partnership Plans with CBOs should be tuned, scheduled, costed and made measurable, with a clear demarcation of responsibilities between CBOs and SPO. Such plans required detailed information about the capacity needs they had to address. • Each DPM workshop should be followed up by at least one information collection visit to each CBO. Collective reviews were valuable and should continue to be conducted as well. • New and separate procedures should be developed for women groups. • SPO should decide, either internally or in consultation with DPM- Graduate CBOs, which elements of DPM had to be shared with all, and which skills and tools were best provided only to workshop participants - with CBOs and other members simply being briefed about them. A New Focus on Women By 1995–96, it had become clear that the benefits of SPO’s DPM programme were accruing mostly for men in rural communities. Since most CBOs did not include any female membership, women remained marginalized from the development planning and management in their communities. SPO had tried to address gender inequities through two special programmes for female\n\n42. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization40 education promotion—the Village Education Programme and the Integrated Basic Education Programme - but these initiatives need scaling up in terms of geographical and programme scope to have a pervasive impact. In order to help rural women address their own concerns and play a role in their communities’ development, SPO had to mainstream them into its DPM programme – something that would not only build their capacity to take charge, but also serve as the gateway for subsequent financial support from SPO and other donors. The first step was to mobilize and form women organizations. For this, SPO’s approach varied in the four provinces in response to the local cultural circumstances and sensitivities. For instance, in NWFP, a programme was implemented in collaboration with The Asia Foundation (TAF). Initial surveys were conducted and 13 potential women groups identified in Takht Bhai and Swabi. A detailed programme to build the capacity of these groups was planned jointly by SPO and TAF. In Balochistan, SPO field staff to mobilize women for group formation carried out Door-to-door visits. This led to two groups, each comprising of 30 local women, being formed in Muslim Bagh. The groups were oriented on the role of women in development and their transformation into CBOs was initiated. In Punjab, four women groups were formed in Kotla Gamu, Kot Addu, Daja and Muzaffargarh. These groups had been included in SPO clusters in the areas. Eight women groups were mobilized and sensitised in Ghotki District of Sindh province. This cluster later became the first formal women’s cluster to complete DPM training. By the end of the year, 27 women groups had been mobilized. Decentralization of Social Sector Fund Formation of Regional Project Approval Committees (RPACs) brought project approval and management of the implementation process even closer to CBOs. During the year, these RPACs conducted sessions in Quetta, Lahore and Hyderabad and approved eight projects for support from the Social Sector Fund. ‘Partners in Development’ SPO undertook a special short-term assignment for the British High Commission in which it coordinated and produced a regular publication of the Commission, ‘Partners in Development’.\n\n43. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 41 Building SPO SPO maintained a steady focus on building itself into a viable and professional institution. During its second year, the organization’s corporate values were identified through a workshop; a strategic plan was developed, internal and external communications were improved, and the various SPO decision- making forums performed actively. Corporate Values identified Through a workshop, SPO staff determined the following corporate values of the organization. • Participation in programme development within SPO and between it and its partner organizations • Sovereignty and equality of partner organizations • Mutual trust, honesty, professionalism and transparency in the organization • Accountability, ethnic impartiality and effective participation in the process • Creativity and innovation in efforts; and • Accessibility to one’s basic rights and discharge of obligations. A Strategic Plan Equipped with experience, an initial audit of SPO’s capacity building plan and the funding plan that was developed previous year, a strategic planning exercise was initiated to make key decisions regarding programme and funding options for the future. Facilitated by Cowater International, the exercise involved all key SPO stakeholders. It led to a Strategic Plan, which was approved by the Board in June 1996, with the following key points: • SPO’s goals and purpose should be maintained. Capacity building of CBOs should remain the principal focus and mainstay of SPO’s endeavours. But increased effort and resources should be channelled into technical assistance, networking, linkages, and advocacy. • With a substantial number of CBOs having DPM training, project funding should be increased – accompanied by careful project selection, implementation, monitoring, and technical support. • Female group formation should be prioritised in all regions.\n\n44. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization42 • Special programmes such as VEP and IBEP should be continued and others added, but only when funds had been identified for them, and ensuring that they were not in conflict with SPO’s objectives and programmes. • Micro funding (choti funding) should be introduced on a pilot basis and initially only in one region. It should be an integral part of DPM training to strengthen CBOs in project and resource management, and as a first step towards project funding. • To maximize efficient use of resources, SPO should concentrate geographically in carefully selected districts, clusters and CBOs. SPO should withdraw support from “graduate” CBOs but include them in long-term monitoring and networking. • Decentralization should continue and be extended beyond regional offices to field operations • In view of the decline in international funding and the need to establish financial sustainability, SPO’s marketing should be allotted increased priority and resources. A small marketing unit should be created for this at the National Centre and work should start on cultivating Pakistan’s private sector as a corporate funding base for SPO. Cost Efficiency Around this time SPO also arranged an external audit of its management arrangements. A two-member team commissioned by Cowater International undertook the audit in August 1995. A major recommendation of the team was to abolish five positions, four of which pertained to administration. By implementing this recommendation, SPO reduced the National Centre’s salary budget by 30%. General Governance and Management Following committees and forums of SPO were active throughout the year. Board of Directors: In 1995-96, the Board decided to constitute Regional Project Approval Committees (RPAC) in all four regions. Comprising 3 BoD members as well\n\n45. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 43 as SPO’s Chief Executive, each Committee was to meet as soon as a minimum of two proposals were ready for approval. SPO Management Committee In order to improve management efficiency, a workshop on developing Annual Work Plans on the basis of Results-based Management (RBM) was conducted for the SPO Management Committee Programme Review Meetings Two were held during the year. The forum decided to observe 1996 as the Year for the Eradication of Poverty. Advisory Council A meeting held at the National Centre on 23 June 1996 focused on the funding bottleneck that SPO was facing at the time: • According to SPO’s agreement with CIDA, funding for 1996–97 was only available for the National Centre and SPO Punjab. • The Sindh and NWFP funding was expected from the EU that year, but was still not in the offing. • Funding for the Balochistan and VEP programmes was being negotiated with the Royal Netherlands Embassy and might be available by January 1997. • Meanwhile, the Operational Budget was to include the funds committed by CIDA, as well as the money saved from staff reductions and other cuts on the COLA and allowances of staff. It was decided that CIDA would follow up with its headquarters to make an internal adjustment to cover the Sindh and NWFP Programmes. Meanwhile, EAD would inquire about the funding status at the EU Mission in Islamabad. Amendments to the Articles of Association were proposed to ensure broader powers of the Advisory Council. New members were to be inducted after approval of the amendment by the CLA and subsequently by SPO’s Annual General Meeting. Improved Internal Communications From the start, the National Centre had been kept fully equipped with communication hardware and software. A local area network (LAN) allowed all users to share data and devices. In order to facilitate the decentralization of the SPO programme to the regions, the SPONet section first extended email access to each user at the National Centre, and then to the regional centres.\n\n46. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization44 Between October and December 1995, all regions were successfully equipped and trained in using e-mail. Reaching Out Throughout the year, SPO remained a regular and active participant in national and international events for dialogue and advocacy for an enabling environment for NGOs in the country. As part of this effort SPO made a major contribution to the NGO Bill dialogue. SPO was unable to publish its annual report due to production delays. However, in December 1995, the organization’s very first newsletter was produced in-house and disseminated to partner organizations. It was to serve as a valuable communication channel in subsequent years. Finance During this year, SPO entered into a partnership with UNICEF regarding non-formal education programme in Noshera, NWFP during the year. To protect equipments and machinery, this year an internal insurance reserve fund was developed for PKR 1.2 million. In addition, an endowment fund was created with PKR 20 million. SPO’s balance sheet footing was PKR 42.8 million whereas company’s owned assets were PKR 8.36 million (at cost) with an operating expense of PKR 32.06 million. Administrative Decisions The management at SPO decided to introduce the post of Associate Programme Coordinator in order to provide career path for the Programme Coordinator (PC) position. The staff appointed at the assistant program coordinator’s post had to complete one-year of service before they become eligible to be considered for the PC post. During the reporting period, the in-house staff development initiatives included 8 workshops, 1 field visit, in-country initiatives included 33 training workshops and 1 experience sharing visit for staff while initiatives abroad include 4 trainings workshops. During the reporting period following new formats or proformas were introduced: • New time sheet proforma was introduced to provide a better description of staff time utilization.\n\n47. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 45 • The performance evaluation proforma was changed to make it more objective. MSI (Meritorious Services Increments) was replaced with MSC (Meritorious Services Certificate). • Contents of employment contract for project staff were finalized. The senior management committee (SMC) members after making certain amendments approved the Training Policy proposed by the Programme Specialist-TS. Accommodation rates for the Senior Management were reduced by 15% for their in-country travels and perdiem allowances reduced by 20%. Career path for the Programme Coordinators (PCs) was developed. It was decided that the PC should be inducted as Associate Programme Coordinator (APC). After completion of one year he/she shall get full fledge position. Achievements • Audit of the Capacity Building Programme, leading to recommendations for improvement; • Greater focus on women in capacity building, leading to the mobilization of 27 women’s groups across the country; • Identification of corporate values, including participation, equality and accountability; • Development of a Strategic Plan, which continued to prioritize support for CBOs, but with greater stress on women. On the operational side, this promoted further decentralization; • Active participation by SPO forums such as the Board of Directors, and the Programme Review Meeting; • Improved internal communication, and continued outreach to NGO partners and government.\n\n48. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization46 1996-1997 A Broader Horizon wo years of direct contact with communities in all provinces of Pakistan gave SPO deepening insights into the obstacles facing them in development. Constantly judging itself and looking for more effective ways to achieve the impact it sought, SPO expanded its programme in fiscal year 1996–97. A three-pronged strategy was adopted to address the key development hurdles that had been observed: • Continuing dependency on SPO of CBOs trained in Development Planning and Management; • Sidelining of women from SPO’s interventions and benefits; • Lack of coordination between partner organizations and external development stakeholders, such as government bodies. Five-Year Business Plan SPO arranged a two-day workshop for all its staff and management on 7–8 January 1997 to develop a Business Plan for the five-year period from then until 2001–02. Three programme approaches that had been identified by the senior management and their respective future scenarios were explored in the workshop. An attempt was made to determine the funding requirement and the output associated with each. The outlook for special programmes and SPO’s experience with obtaining funds from donors was also discussed: I. Cost-effective Outreach Scenario • Aimed at doubling SPO’s program capacity without adding any regular staff to the regional offices. • Over the next five years, each Programme Coordinator (PCs) would be able to handle three clusters, each comprising of 5–8 CBOs, and in time, the PC’s capacity and output would double. • However, the associated costs would only increase by less than 25 percent over the next five years. T\n\n49. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 47 • This would be achieved by increasing reliance on Local Resource Persons (LRPs) instead of hiring more PCs. LRPs are the focal points of the SPO program in a cluster who have, over time, attained a sound familiarity with the SPO philosophy and program. They are trained on-the-job by the PCs to help different CBOs in a cluster as the natural extension workers of the SPO. Under this scenario, PCs would be supported by LRPs at the cluster level. The LRPs would be given some incentives, including training, and would act as local field staff. Over time, trained LRPs could become a valuable human resource when SPO wished to expand into other locations. II. Regional Expansion Scenario • Aimed at expanding the SPO program in each region to other districts to cater to the growing capacity building demands of CBOs – an aim reinforced by donors’ interest in certain underdeveloped areas of the provinces. • Given additional staffing and logistics, SPO could easily sustain a 15 percent annual growth in the number of partner CBOs without compromising on quality and efficiency. • Under this scenario, SPO would double its outreach capacity while the output, in terms of partner CBOs, would increase by 70 percent. As against this, the incremental cost would be about 40 percent over the next five years. III. Extension to a New Region Scenario SPO’s uniqueness as being the foremost and most widely outreached organization sometimes posed challenging for it. Demands were constantly made on SPO to extend to other areas of the country. The respond to these challenges, SPO planned expansion to a New Region Scenario aimed to initiate CBOs’ capacity building by SPO in such areas, especially those where other NGOs had not been able to start their programs either. Azad Jammu and Kashmir was envisaged as the next region for SPO to expand into. It was decided that the expansion would be implemented with special dedicated funding and would therefore not pose a risk of financial over-extension. There would be a start-up phase with special budgets; but thereafter, budgeting would be performed in the same manner as for other SPO regions.\n\n50. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization48 Outlook for Special Programs Special Programs (SPs) went beyond normal programming to concentrate on a new geographic area or specific development sector. Examples were VEP and IBEP, of which the former had graduated to becoming a Regional Programme. Donors interested in the respective new geographic area or sector specifically funded SPs. They were not undertaken unless funded and, therefore, in themselves, posed no risk of financial over-extension for SPO. SPO envisaged several SPs for which potential donors had been identified. These include Micro Credit, Malakand, South Punjab, and Faisalabad Rural Development and NGO Umbrella. Each special program initiated would have its own staff and resources, depending on the size and complexity of the program. Marketing SPO to Donors Many donors were increasingly expressing interest in SPO as a nationwide capacity building NGO. This had resulted in the funding of special programs by UNICEF and the Asia Foundation. SPO had also made a concerted effort to acquire broad-based support from several donors as fiscal year 1997–98 approached. There were three distinct types of funding: funding for overall SPO development; funding for specific regions; and funding for special programs. Many donors were expressing interest and some appeared close to making commitments. But SPO was facing considerable difficulty in gaining final donor commitments. For example, discussions and proposal development for EU and Dutch funding had been in progress for several years. Protracted negotiations also resulted in constantly changing plans and targets as well as uncertain futures for staff. There were also difficulties in trying to match the programmes of five regions and a National Centre with a large number of donors, each with unique interests, requirements and funding patterns. On the bright side, these difficulties were not specific to SPO but common to nearly all NGOs in Pakistan, and, although protracted negotiations created difficulties, the interest of a large number of donors was welcome as multiple options provided a degree of independence to SPO in identifying support.\n\n51. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 49 Marketing was an essential and time-consuming responsibility for the senior management. With some 12 donors near commitment or expressing interest, and six more making initial contact, marketing required administrative support. SPO was developing an informal database on donors and utilizing its second tier of management to develop an aggressive marketing strategy and program. Conclusions Having considered the various options, future scenarios and challenges facing SPO, it was agreed that SPO would develop its programme at a level between the Cost-Effective Outreach and Regional Expansion scenarios in all regions for at least the first two years of the five year plan, and in NWFP at a considerably higher level. Funding commitments would be needed to ensure smooth operation over the next two years, without which major readjustments would be required. Transforming the interest being expressed by many donors into early commitment would require strengthening of the marketing effort. Programme Enhancement to Enable Development By 1996 SPO was increasingly concerned about three hurdles in its development work: 1. The dependence of partner organizations (CBOs) on SPO for institutional counsel even after they had completed DPM training; 2. The fact that impacts of the DPM Programme did not directly reach women; 3. Field experiences, which clearly showed that SPO’s partner organizations could not realize their full potential for effecting community development because they lacked working ties with external stakeholders, such as government bodies and donor organizations. 4. To address these three problems, SPO made a strategic decision to extend its programme with Strengthening of a ‘self-sustenance’ mechanism for partner organizations that had completed DPM training; A Women’s Emancipation Programme; and Strengthening of development stakeholders’ dialogue and collaboration. It was hoped that these additional measures would help create the enabling environment needed for SPO’s partner organizations to function in an effective and sustainable manner.\n\n52. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization50 Self-Sustenance for Partner Organizations SPO’s original plan had been to withdraw its involvement with communities after they had been imparted DPM training so that it could extend its services to other communities. In practice, this was not possible because partner organizations continued to rely on SPO. A solution had to be found where SPO could be released to support new communities without denying partner organizations the continued institutional support they needed. After much debate, SPO finalized its strategy. Once partner organizations had graduated, they would be organized into “Coordination Councils”, which would act as the umbrella platforms to assist their members. The specific role of these councils would be to replicate DPM training with CBOs that had not been trained by SPO, Disseminate information among their members, Update member organizations on current development issues, and Strategize joint interventions for environmental protection, gender equity, human rights, and the legal rights of the marginalized poor. Where necessary, the Councils could approach SPO for technical support. In this manner, the independence and eventual empowerment of capacitated partner organizations would be assured. In order to strengthen these platforms, SPO decided to provide the Councils training in networking, information sharing, advocacy, micro-credit management for poverty alleviation, and collaboration with the Government in its Social Action Programme. Training was also provided to Local Resource Persons.\n\n53.

SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization52 Women’s Emancipation Programme (WEP) During the previous year, SPO had already begun mobilizing women’s groups across the country. In 1996–97, the organization consolidated these efforts, defined a strategy for mobilizing and mainstreaming women in its capacity building cycle, and began implementing it as the ‘Women’s Emancipation Programme’ (WEP). WEP Entailed Seven Steps Step 1 Meeting (Male) CBOs for Consent Informal/Formal meetings held with existing (male-oriented) CBOs to obtain their consent and support for mobilizing and training women. Concept of WEP explained to the CBO members. Continued consultations with CBOs creates positive and receptive attitude: timetable for gathering and meeting women mutually set. Step 2 Orientation Meeting Orientation meeting of women held to: - Introduce SPO and WEP; - Assess need for a female organization; - Identify ‘sparks’ in community. Step 3 Motivational Meetings Series of motivational meetings held. Also used to carry out social mapping of the village and collect baseline data. Step 4 Mobilization Mobilization for an organization. Step 5 Female Group Formation Formal membership in the organization sought from women. Formal structure of the organization is laid down, including a general body and an executive committee. Office bearers elected and regular meetings held. Group trained and encouraged to write meeting minutes, start savings and maintain saving pass-books. Record keeping explained. Protocols for registration of group as a voluntary organization completed. Step 6 Cluster formation Female organizations in adjacent areas, able to meet regularly without much difficulty, grouped into cluster. Step 7 Mainstreaming: Capacity building cycle for cluster implemented in same manner as for mainstream (i.e. male) CBOs.\n\n55. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 53 Promoting Stakeholder Synergy Local Initiatives in Development SPO’s experience of working closely with donor agencies and CBOs, as well as its involvement in the NGO Bill and subsequent dealings with government, made it aware of the lack of interaction between these three key development stakeholders. Crucially, it made SPO aware of the problems arising because of that lack of interaction: Development initiatives of CBOs need support from the start. hey might occasionally receive the resources they needed for development (such as funds), and some ad hoc outputs could accrue (e.g. basic infrastructure and facilities). But without a free flow of information between CBOs, government departments, and donors, and without recognition of their respective roles in development, a collective and planned drive and an enabling environment to play their roles, a sustainable development process could not be expected. , donors, and support agencies. SPO’s very first step in catalysing stakeholder interaction was the planning and implementation of a series of public dialogues on the theme of “Local Initiatives in Development”. The concept of the dialogue was developed in 1996. Its main objectives were to: • Provide a forum of the three partners in the development process (CBOs, the Government, and donors) to initiate dialogue for the creation of a sustainable development process; • Share information on initiatives already undertaken by CBOs and their community members to address their development needs; and • Facilitate networking between CBOs, Government departments The first national dialogue was held on 10 November 1996 in Islamabad. Mr. Omar Asghar Khan, a founder member of SPO, outlined the main points of discussion. SPO’s Chairperson, Mr. Javed Jabbar, played a key role in ensuring that these events were meaningful, effective, and made optimal use of participation of governors, chief ministers and other federal ministers. The LID Conference for Punjab was hosted in Lahore on 12–13 May 1997. Punjab Governor Shahid Hamid inaugurated the event, while the concluding session was presided over by Sardar Zulfiqar Ali Khosa, Senior Minister of the\n\n56. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization54 Government of Punjab. Other dialogues arranged under this important initiative took place the following year [See Chapter Five]. The Learning Information System 1996–97 saw the commissioning of the Learning Information System (LIS) as a vital tool for monitoring and evaluation of SPO’s activities. Development of the LIS software, perhaps the most important challenge in realizing LIS, was completed with technical support from Cowater International. The resulting system managed information in two phases: Phase I - managed information from monthly activity reports submitted by regional offices. The system was comprehensive enough to cover all SPO’s activities, yet flexible enough to be modified in line with future shifts in the organization’s programme. It was highly user-friendly, being menu-driven and including shortcut keys for advanced users. Phase II – processed data: the reporting formats and procedures required for updating and data processing were finalizedand included a special questionnaire of 102 questions, intended to measure the impact of the DPM programme at the CBO and community level against 11 Capacity Building Indicators (CBIs). The 11 CBIs were: Leadership, Community Participation, CBO Membership, Environmental Awareness, Monitoring, Evaluation, Outreach, Women’s Empowerment, Management Skills, Vision, and Accountability. Upon the request of CIDA’s monitoring agency, support was also given to the monitoring and information system sections of the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) and the Social Action Programme (SAP). Special Programmes School Sudhar Programme New special initiatives by SPO included the School Sudhar Programme in Ghotki, Sindh, and a field survey to support an evaluation of the Government’s Social Action Programme.\n\n57. SPO-A Brief History Strengthening Participatory Organization 55 The School Sudhar Programme, funded by British Gas International, was the third special SPO programme geared to promote education. In this venture, SPO Sindh conducted a detailed survey of the needs of girls’ schools in Ubauro, district Ghotki, and coordinated the repairs and the provision of furniture and other equipment at 22 girls’ schools (I high, 2 middle and 19 primary). Evaluation of Social Action Programme (SAP) SPO was commissioned by SPDC to conduct a survey of social sectors in 244 communities across Pakistan in March and April 1997, as part of an evaluation of the Government’s Social Action Programme. The main conclusion of SPO’s report was that the conditions observed were generally worse than expected although some advances had been made during the last three years of SAP. However, these advances were not commensurate with the disbursements made in the SAP sectors and had not resulted in major improvements in the quality of service provision. SPO’s findings were used in SPDC’s research report on “Review of the Social Action Programme – August 1997”. SPO Strengthening Through 1996-97, SPO continued to make the governance and management decisions needed to strengthen itself as an institution and to implement its programme more efficiently. In addition to the routine operations of the various governance and management groups, a financial monitoring mission was hosted and a formal system for staff performance appraisal initiated. Financial Monitoring Mission In March 1997, Cowater International conducted a Financial Monitoring Mission. The mission had two purposes: To review SPO’s financial system, including financial policies and procedures, internal controls, ability to meet multi-donor requirements, and reporting; and To provide advice on the overall structure of the accounting system, the computerized accounting system, and the computerized accounting software to increase its effectiveness for SPO staff. The Mission’s review was undertaken at the national and Lahore regional office, and included a Financial Management Workshop. The Mission acknowledged that SPO did strive for transparency in its financial systems and controls - demonstrated by the open and candid manner in which financial information was shared by SPO staff. SPO’s financial systems, policies, and"
