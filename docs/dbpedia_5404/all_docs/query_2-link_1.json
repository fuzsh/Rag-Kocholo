Natural and geographical conditions of villages, long distance from the center, and the lack of economic diversification have caused harsh living conditions for border villages of the province. The study area is rural areas in Khawmirabad region in the western part of Marivan city which is one of the 10 cities of Kurdistan province onborder with Iraq. This neighboring with Iraq, geographical situation, cultural and social likeness with Iraqi people in the other side of the border and an enormous capacity of Iraq for cross-border trade, has created a favorable situation for establishing border market. Considering these facts, the border market was established in 2009, primarily to improve the economic situation in the villages around the region of Marivan. Field work observations, interviews with local people as well as research findings of Dastvar and Veysi (2016), and Manoochehri and Tayyebniya (2016) related to the favorable impact of socio-economic performance of the border market showed that this market has not had optimum performance and effectiveness, and that the local people are not satisfiedwith it. Reflecting this situation led the management of the border market which is administered by border office of Mariwan city to do some reformations to improve the performance and socio-economic impact of border market. Thus, the main objective of this study is to analyze the socio-economic impact and efficiency of border market due to management reforms which has been done for effective managing and running this market.\r\n2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\r\nborder market is an enclosed area located at the zero border and adjacent to the customs authorities authorized to discharge the goods or places determined in accordance with memorandums concluded between the Islamic Republic of Iran and neighboring countries. Border markets are centers formakingmobility in rural areas for more serious presence in national and regional development and also a strategy for exiting from economic and geographical isolation through national and international cooperation. Achieving developmental positive impacts in relation with border markets is possible when the managers are efficient. Management role in the success of an organization and institution is ofgreat importance when we consider the progress and success as the result of a fusion of some elements like capital, labor, natural resources, market, etc. The task of management is planning and coordinating these elements.\r\n3. METHODOLOGY\r\nThis study is practical in objectives and is descriptive-analytical in method. Data in theoretical part were collected through using library resources and in the field part through interviews and questionnaires. The population of this research was the head of households in Khawmirabad region that are allowed to operate in the market place. Based on the census in 2010, this region has a population of 11408 people and 2736 households among which 260 households were selectedas the sample using Cochran formula. Then for analyzing the obtained data, inferential statistical tests like t-single sample, andpath analysis and AHP technique were used in addition to descriptive statistics.\r\n4. DISCUSSION\r\nDoing reforms in the administration of border market management has directly led to employment for many households. Although rural women have not directly been employed, theiremployment in agriculture and animal husbandryhas indirectly increased. This increase in villagers’ income and reduction of rural poverty have caused great willingness forvillagers to stay in villages and even has led to the formation of reverse migration to villages.\r\n5. CONCLUSION\r\nIncreasing the efficiency and performance of border markets through doing reforms and improving its management, has enhanced the level of socio-economic development of the villagers. Among the executive strategies in the management of border market, the increase in exchange level and villagers’ income are strategies with the greatest effect in socio-economic development of the villagers.",
