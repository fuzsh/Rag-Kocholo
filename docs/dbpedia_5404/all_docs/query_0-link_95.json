This 3-star hotel offers a 24-hour front desk and room service. The hotel has family rooms.\n\n“The reason I chose this hotel was the location and the price. I was quite surprised at how clean and well decorated the place was considering the price is much cheaper than the other options I had. It's at the center, so my family and I were able to walk to most of the places we wanted to see. The main reason we visited Tashkent was Sevara Nazarkhan's concert at Humo Arena, which was also at a walking distance. The breakfast was really good, I usually don't eat breakfast at the hotels I stay at, but this hotel had a good variety of dishes and coffee included in the price. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. Every room and hallway was carpeted, and the rooms were warm and cozy. Clean bathroom with a shower. The staff is super friendly and welcoming, we felt like at home. They also helped us order a taxi a few times. I will for sure stay at this property on my next visit to Tashkent.”\n\nJahongir B&B Tashkent\n\nPurata skor reviu: 8.5\n\nJahongir B&B Tashkent is located in Tashkent, 550 metres from Tinchlik Metro Station. Free WiFi access is available. Each room here will provide you with air conditioning.\n\n“Jahongir B&B was my stay in Tashkent during my last leg of winter travels in Uzbekistan as the guesthouse I wanna stay was fully booked. I have stayed there for two nights. It was a bit out of the city center but luckily there is a metro station within 5mins walk, so there is not much a problem. There is a mini mart around the corner and a large supermarket Marko opposite. If you wanna walk to Chorsu also possible in 30 minutes. The room is big and hot shower is always available. They have a air con which also serves as a heat generator which keeps you warm throughout the day. A electric kettle is also provided in the room which is a bonus. The room has a window which you provide a neighbourhood view. They served breakfasts in a room next door down the basement which is a bit inconvenient if it is raining or freezing cold in the morning, as you have to put on your shoes and walked outdoors to get in there. Their breakfasts is big portions and they give you pot of hot water to make your choice of instant coffee or tea. As they know most foreigners are always craving for coffee. Unfortunately they do not cater dinner requests which I have always asking for during my homestays as I have a bit of difficulty is locating vegetarian food. It would be nice of they could cater that too. But luckily I could find some cafes eventually which serves vegetarian dishes. The lady at the front desk is nice to give me information I have been asking for. English generally not much a problem there compared to other areas. During the last night departure, I could leave my bag at the check in counter and relax a bit in their basement before my night flight back. You could simply use Yandex Taxi app to arrange your taxi ride to airport or other places within Tashkent. Overall it is a nice guesthouse but lacks a feel of family hospitality features. It is good enough for a short stay in Tashkent.”\n\nApartment Sayram\n\nPurata skor reviu: 8\n\nApartment Sayram is situated in Tashkent. This property offers access to a patio, free private parking and free WiFi.\n\n“The owner of the apartment, Mr. Azamat is a very good and kind person. He came to the apartment before I arrive and waited for me, he even bought me lunch after handing over the key. The apartment is situated a bit off the city center but it has its own Bazar, restaurants, cafes, bakeries, groceries and anything that you feel you wanna shop. It is also near the Buyuk Ipak Yoli Metro line which can lead you to Amir Timur Sq, Independence Sq or the Broadway. The apartment is well heated and facilities are sufficient. It is a safe area. When I arrived, the Apartment was well kept and cleaned. Mr Azamat called for my taxi to the Airport and even paid for the taxi. My overall stay at the apartment was a very good one.”\n\nApartment Tsentr 5\n\nPurata skor reviu: 9.4\n\nApartment Tsentr 5 is located in Tashkent. The property was built in 1975, and has air-conditioned accommodation with free WiFi.\n\n“Everything! No words can describe the host; Azamat’s hospitality and commitment to ensuring that every detail was looked after, and he literally was amazing. He waited for me at the airport, and although he had a leg-injury, was un-deterred by it, and wanted to make sure I got to the apartment all right. We went to the apartment together; had a great chat along the way, and he showed me all around the neighbourhood, and went through all the important details. He even suggested showing me around, I was so touched; here’s a poor bloke, with a cast on his leg, and he wanted to make sure, I got to see Tashkent? We took a cab to a cafe/restaurant to have Plov, which was awesome, and had a great chat all throughout, drank tea, and toured the market, took pics, and it was awesome. This guy was so nice, and he really wanted me to have a proper introduction to Tashkent. He even refused to let me pay for the meal, etc. He helped me with going to the train station, to get my ticket to Samarkand, and we went to church on Christmas Eve to soak in the Christmas spirit. This guy wasn’t just a guide, he was a mate. My trip wouldn’t have been the same without his help. The apartment was great - in Soviet style, which was what I wanted - it was warm, had all the essentials, comfy sofa, kitchen, and 2 beds. Azamat left a huge bottled water for me, and I enjoyed exploring the neighbourhood. :) I will be back for sure, and am ONLY gonna stay here!!”\n\nArt Apartment\n\nPurata skor reviu: 9.7\n\nSet in Tashkent, Art Apartment offers air-conditioned accommodation with a balcony and free WiFi. The property features garden and city views.\n\n“The apartment is beautiful, spacious, clean and with everything you might need. It’s located in a quiet area but close enough to restaurants, coffee shops and supermarket. We love walking, so we walk from here to the center and back with no problem. Our flight was delayed arriving to Tashkent so we didn’t get to the apartment until 2am-3am but Musti was waiting there for us. The airline we flew lost one of our bags and he was very helpful and called the airline for us to find out the time our bag was arriving in Tashkent. I would recommend this place.”\n\nEffo Hostel\n\nPurata skor reviu: 8.8\n\nSet in Tashkent, Effo Hostel provides free WiFi. The accommodation offers a shared kitchen and a shared lounge for guests. At the hostel, all rooms include a wardrobe, a TV and a private bathroom.\n\n“I was very well received in Effo Hostel despite my late arrival at 23.00. The hostel is close to the train station, which makes it a convenient place to stay. The staff was very friendly and most helpful. They helped me plan the rest of my journey, booked a taxi for me and made sure I was traveling safe. Lots to be ashamed from if we compare it with how Occidentals receive their visitors. I had a very nice time in Effo Hostel and can without any doubt recommend this place. Огромное спасибо за ваш гостеприимности!”\n\nGrand Mumtoz Hotel\n\nPurata skor reviu: 7.2\n\nGrand Mumtoz Hotel features a shared lounge, garden and terrace in Tashkent. The accommodation provides a 24-hour front desk, airport transfers, a shared kitchen and free WiFi throughout the property....\n\n“The staff were all very nice, and made an effort to look after us, and were helpful and friendly. It's a straightforward hotel, but it's nice, well presented and clean. Most of the staff who worked at reception spoke some English. Breakfast was nice enough, and there was plenty of it. The hotel provides breakfast, but there is a large restaurant just over the road which does dinner, and there are a couple of shops next to it. There are also some smaller eating places and shops within 2 or 3 minutes along the road if you turn left out of the hotel door. A meal out costs about £1.50.”\n\nHumo Apartment\n\nPurata skor reviu: 9.3\n\nSet in Tashkent, Humo Apartment offers accommodation with a bar, free WiFi, a 24-hour front desk, and a shared kitchen. This apartment provides air-conditioned accommodation with a balcony.\n\n“Great apartment with a great host! He speaks perfectly well english and you can call or text him, if you need anything. We asked him to organize a day trip to a lake ressort and he did that within 10 minutes for a reasonable price. From the apartment you cane walk to the center (~ 20 mins) or take a taxi for around 20 000 so'm. It's also easy to get back to the apartment either with the taxi (just tell them, you want to go to Humo Arena, the big stadium next to the apartment) or go to the metro station closeby.”\n\nApartment Downtown\n\nPurata skor reviu: 8.9\n\nSituated in Tashkent, Apartment Downtown offers shared lounge, free WiFi, a 24-hour front desk, and a shared kitchen. This apartment features air-conditioned accommodation with a balcony.\n\n“The location is excellent. 200m to the metro system, a must see when in Tashkent. Similarly, the Central train station is just across the road via an underground subway. The apartment is very good, with everything you need for your stay and it was exceptional clean. The hosts, Nafisa and her husband could not have been more helpful and communication was excellent. I asked to stay another day and she made no fuss about it at all. There are plenty of places to eat within a few minutes walking and there is an excellent food market just next door. There are two street vendors at the corner of the building, both worth a try. I had the Daner in one and Samosa in the other. A short walk away is the restaurant Cafe Karolona, well worth a visit. Food is a mix of asian and local. English menu and friendly staff. A 10 minute walk in a very safe area. One last point to illustrate how helpful Nafisa can be. She realise, (because I hadn't) that I did not have enough cash for the taxi fare to the airport. Instead of saying nothing and leaving me to figure it out later, she offered to run me over in her car. I think that sums up not only my time in the apartment but also Uzbekistan.”\n\nChimkent ko'chasi\n\nPurata skor reviu: 9.7\n\nLocated in Tashkent, Chimkent ko'chasi provides air-conditioned accommodation with a balcony and free WiFi.\n\n“It was great to book that place. I was enjoying. Owner the apartment is a great and honest person. If you need some help you should ask them and they will do their best to help you. Location is the best for that money. You can reach easy the city centre. The apartment was clean and comfortable. They have everything that you need ( towels, blankets etc) I liked it. If you bring with you a big suitcase for you will be some problem to carry it upstairs because it's a building only for 4 floors and doesn't have a lift. If I go back again I will choose it again. :)”\n\nСтудия в центре Ташкента\n\nPurata skor reviu: 9.9\n\nLocated in Tashkent, Студия в центре Ташкента provides air-conditioned accommodation with a balcony and free WiFi. The property has garden views.\n\n“It's a beautiful little apartment. The open plan makes it feel spacious. We're a five persons family and felt very comfortable. The facilities are the best we've had across the whole Central Asia (coffee machine, toaster, mobile phone to use around Tashkent). The area is great, too. There is a park on the doorstep with a playground, a number of little, well stocked shops, some cafes and restaurants. The metro station is just across the park and it is only four stops away from the old Tashkent. The host was very helpful and always on time. It is one of the best places we ever stayed at.”"
