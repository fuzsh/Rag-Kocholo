No further edits should be made to this discussion.\n\nAtheism\n\nDispute overview\n\nCan you give us a quick explanation of what is going on? What is the issue you are bringing here?\n\nThere is a disagreement on how to best capture and present the weight of RS specifically in the context of a definition in plain English. In my opinion our article is currently not reflecting the weight of the sources, and is employing language which seems open to a wider range of interpretation than seems justified by available sources. My position is that we need to move closer to:\n\nCritique and denial of metaphysical beliefs in God or divine beings. Unlike agnosticism, which leaves open the question of whether there is a God, atheism is a positive denial. It is rooted in an array of philosophical systems.\n\n— \"Atheism\". Encyclopædia Britannica Concise. Merriam Webster .\n\nUsers involved\n\nWho is involved in the dispute?\n\nHave you informed all the editors mentioned above that you have posted this dispute? (If not, once you have informed them come back and replace the text \"Not yet\" with \"Yes\".)\n\nYes.\n\nN.B. To inform the other users you may place the text {{subst:DRN-notice|thread=Atheism}} --~~~~ in a new section on each user's talk page.\n\nResolving the dispute\n\nHave you tried to resolve this dispute already? If so, what steps have you taken?\n\nLots of discussion on the talk-page spanning multiple sections:\n\nTalk:Atheism#Source_Review_-_Definitions.\n\nTalk:Atheism#juxtaposition_with_agnosticism_as_the_consensus_position\n\nHow do you think we can help?\n\nWe need a mediator who is familiar with philosophy who can help us keep on track and help resolve potential confusion regarding terms of art.\n\nun☯mi\n\nAtheism discussion\n\nDiscussion about the issues listed above take place here. Remember to keep discussions calm, brief, and focused on the issues at hand.\n\nI am not sure if sources from Talk:Atheism#Sources_re_agnosticism_delineation should be copied here wholesale or whether we should consider them one at a time? un☯mi\n\nI'm replying here because I have been listed as an involved party, and I have been a long-time editor of the page, but I actually have not been involved at all in the discussion that this request is about. As a long-time editor of the page, I'm very well familiar with the reasons for the brightly lit notice at the top of Talk:Atheism. The talk page perennially gets walls of text about, well, how many atheists can dance on the head of a pin. Editors chronically agree that the definitions of atheism, and of how atheism resembles and differs from related topics such as agnosticism, just don't quite capture the perfect précis that individual editors desire, but editors seem never to arrive at consensus for anything better than what the page says now. Largely at Unomi's impetus, we have recently made some helpful brief additions to the article about the relationship with agnosticism. I think those additions have been good. I'm aware of, but have pretty much stayed away from, the wall of talk page text about whether or not to include something or other from EB. I don't much care, and I have come to find such conversations to be lengthy and unproductive time sinks. From a distance, it looks to me like Unomi is taking one position about the EB material, and several other editors say that they are not convinced by Unomi's arguments, and that's how we got here. I think one good solution might be for a few more brave souls to wade into the source material and provide some third+ opinions. Another might be for Unomi to accept that their arguments have not gained consensus, and move on. Whichever way that goes, I wish those involved good luck and happy editing. --Tryptofish (talk)\n\nI don't think it is made sufficiently clear what the dispute is about. I think the first para of the article is unclear. Why are there broad, narrow and inclusive definitions? What is the difference between \"broad\" and \"inclusive\"? Please don't answer these questions - I am just pointing out that they are likely to go through the mind of the poor, confused reader.\n\nThe problem with appealing to definitions in tertiary sources is that, although they might be authoritative (not necessarily definitive, but authoritative) as to current usage, they may not capture subtle shifts in meaning that have occurred over time. The EB definition above, for example, seems to me to be correct now, but it might not be adequate in describing things as they were a century ago. --FormerIP (talk)\n\nJust so you know, that thing about broad, narrow, etc., has been very much at the center of all that perennial talk. I understand how the poor, confused reader may feel, and I hope editors new to the issue will understand how the poor, confused editors feel. Gazillions of digital pixels have been spilled trying to find a better lead paragraph, to no avail. You'd be amazed to see how many even-worse versions can be generated. --Tryptofish (talk)\n\nTo be fair, the article could be said to be confusing because the myriad contradictory ways atheism is idiosyncratically constructed in the literature are also confusing. Wikipedia cannot resolve what is a problem in scholarship as well. I put that forward only partly in jest; there's a serious point there too. --Dannyno (talk)\n\nI agree completely. We cannot do better than what the source material permits us to do. --Tryptofish (talk)\n\nI've watched that page for years and have entered into the discussion on rewriting the lead in some of the seemingly monthly debates about it. The lead is in disagreement with all the other non-theist articles like agnostic and ignostic and the sources they use to define the terms contrasted with atheism. The one source that I consider the root cause of the lead's problem is the religioustolerance.org's essay on atheism. Their lead contradicts the lower section of the essay where agnostic is clearly defined. They openly admit that they capitalize Atheism because they consider it a religion.\n\nCapitalization: The terms \"Atheism\" and \"Atheist\" are normally not capitalized -- except when they begin a sentence -- because they are not proper nouns. On this web site, they are capitalized. This is not ignorance or carelessness on our part. We have intentionally decided to deviate from the usual practice.\n\nThere are countless definitions of the term \"religion.\" The one that we use is unusually inclusive:\n\n\"Religion is any specific system of belief about deity, often involving rituals, a code of ethics, a philosophy of life, and a worldview.\"\n\n(A worldview is a set of basic, foundational beliefs concerning deity, humanity and the rest of the universe.) We include Agnosticism, Atheism, Humanism, Ethical Culture etc. as belief systems similar to religions, because:\n\nThey all contain a \"belief about deity.\" Their belief is that they do not know whether a deity exists, or they have no knowledge of a deity, or they sincerely believe that no deity exist.\n\nThe authors of the essay are not noted scholars on religion and some of the sources they use are not WP:RS and they have an agenda to change the meaning of the word. For these three reasons I will, as I have before, suggest it be excluded as a reliable source and the lead written from better sources. Alatari (talk)\n\nComment I agree with Tryptofish that this debate is endless and I have little hope of seeing this settled. --Alatari (talk)\n\nI also have watched the article for a long time but have seldom participated due to the absurd debates over definitions, and resolution would be appreciated. I agree that religioustolerance.org is not a suitable source for any kind of definition because that site has an agenda (possibly a very noble agenda, but nevertheless they are promoting something and are not claiming any scholarly expertise in the field). If reliable secondary sources cover the points made at religioustolerance, keep the points with new references; otherwise, remove them. A word like \"atheism\" is always going to attract controversy (where some regard it as a deadly insult, and others as a badge of honor), but it should be fairly easy to define the term providing only scholarly sources are used (and it may be necessary to note differences of opinion about the term's meaning, but only if covered in scholarly sources). Johnuniq (talk)\n\nComment I opened a discussion on religioustolerance.org at RSN here.\n\nI included editors that I felt were long-time contributors to the article because I wanted to ensure that any outcome of this discussion could be held to have had wider input.\n\nMuch of the discussion seems to have been prolonged unnecessarily due to interpretation issues with \"reject\", \"positive denial\", \"extralinguistic referents\" and other terms of art which I hope can be refereed more successfully here. I don't think that 3o would have helped build lasting agreement. un☯mi\n\nComment: I have always (since starting out as a contributor in 2005 I think)held that it is important to reflect the diversity of meanings \"atheism\" has. I would support a more in-depth, RS-supported, NPOV discussion of why this diversity exists. Comments above such as \"it should be fairly easy to define the term\" rather overlook the ink spilled in the literature by individual scholars arguing for their own understanding. Fact is, it isn't an easy term to define. Also, the discussion on the talk page is very fragmented. It can be hard to follow a line of argument. I would welcome Unomi giving a clear, concise, explanation of exactly what it is they are trying to do, and why. This is rather lacking at the moment, in my opinion, and I suspect it may be possible to agree on at least some of the problems even if we cannot agree how they could be fixed. --Dannyno (talk)\n\nComment I am happy to see that we have more editors involved now.\n\nAs I stated when I initially opened this request, I would like to see a better usage of plain English in especially our opening definition.\n\nFrom my reading of sources, a contemporary 'plain english' definition could be:\n\n\"Atheism is the position that the god of the Judeo-Christian tradition does not exist, it can also refer to a general position that no gods exist.\"\n\nFrom there we can go into more detail regarding arguments and the position of the innocents ( newborns etc. )\n\nQuality tertiary sources such as Encyclopedia Britannica support this plain English reading, imo. There seems to be widespread confusion regarding the definition due to statements made by popular writers such as Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins - but they seem to be giving a novel reading to the word which has not seen much in the way of support in scholarly works. un☯mi\n\n\"Disbelief...\", \"Critique and denial of metaphysical beliefs...\" and \"rejection of belief...\" are similar constructs that can be more broadly interpreted than \"the position that the god... does not exist\". Some authors (and editors) such as Eller dispute that there is a difference between \"not believe\" (to be without belief) and \"believe not\" and argue for a strict conception such as the unambiguous position that deities do not exist. But, anyone can verify that there are in fact broader dictionary definitions for rejection, disbelief, denial and atheism; and the term \"rejection\" or any of these terms are by no means terms of art and each can be broadly or narrowly construed in accordance with their usage. Thus, to interpret the Britannica in such a narrow way only, is not only unverifiable, it would be the equivalent of stating \"Atheism is the denial of gods or God\" when a particular source says \"Atheism is the disbelief in or denial of gods or God\", thus leaving out the disbelief part. Dictionaries often give more than one definition too, precisely because they are not the same, and of course, the difference between \"not believe\" and \"believe not\" is essential to a nontheistic agnostic (or agnostic nontheist). Thus, its the rare argument that there is really no difference between these assertions, although it seems somewhat uncommon for agnostics to assert they \"are without belief\", but all self-identifying atheists certainly will. In addition, the most inclusive definition, which essentially identifies every nontheist as being an atheist, encompassed by the terms \"absence\" or \"lack\" is included in Martin's Encarta Encyclopedia piece[5],\"Atheism, the denial of or lack of belief in the existence of a god or gods.\"; the BBC website[6] (as merely an example of its prominence at the very least) \"Atheism is the absence of belief in any Gods or spiritual beings.\"; and the Princeton University's WordNet database as can be seen on Onelook[7] \"a lack of belief in the existence of God or gods.\" Sure, the broadest definition is not a primary meaning as Martin is quick to point out, yet it is a minority position per wp:NPOV included in our article that should not be removed from the first paragraph, which defines the article scope, as proposed, nor does the Britannica text directly support the proposed text. --Modocc (talk)\n\nComment - To my eyes, there seems to be a rather fundamental question regarding how to differentiate the content of Atheism and New Atheism, the latter article specifically relating to the opinions of Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, et al. There are some sources, like Lee Strobel's The Case for Christ, which seem to rather clearly indicate that the latter are a group with shared beliefs regarding unknowable questions, or however one wants to define it - basically, an atheistic religion. However, the atheism of the New Atheists is not identical to atheism as a whole, which according to some sources even includes major religions like Buddhism, which do not believe in any sort of personal creator god per se. So I guess, maybe, the question is perhaps how the content should be divided between the two articles I first mentioned? John Carter (talk)\n\nI find the first two sentences of the lead (Atheism is, in a broad sense, the rejection of belief in the existence of deities.[1] In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.) a little user-unfriendly – it is not immediately apparent to the reader (or this reader, at any rate) how one is narrow and the other is broad. But on the whole, the lead does not do a bad job. The contrast to agnosticism is important and is prominently mentioned, as it should be. --JN466\n\nI'm a clerk at this noticeboard, and I haven't been involved with this article at all before. I'm in two minds about this dispute. On the one hand, the definition in the article seems to me, as someone unfamiliar with the literature on the subject, to be covering all the angles. Also, the note at the top of the talk page was put there for exactly the reason that this particular thing has been debated many times before. On the other hand, it could be that we really can improve the definition in some way, and that it would reflect the literature better if we did. I think this depends on what the other editors of the article think. If people do think this is worth pursuing, it seems like the kind of issue that could benefit from a more structured discussion, either mediation or a structured series of drafts on the talk page. However, if a good percentage of editors think it isn't worth pursuing, then mediation isn't likely to help the situation. I've had a brief look at MedCab and MedCom but I didn't turn anything up - does anyone know if this dispute has been through mediation before?

What is the issue you are bringing here?\n\nUser:Plot Spoiler moved these six articles from \"Killing of\" to \"Honor killing of\". User:Kevin McE moved them back and User:Plot Spoiler reverted his move. He then requested article be listed as a DYK. User:Kevin McE evidently saw this and thought it improper, reverted it and did a move request after Plot Spoiler reverted it. I saw his move request regarding moving Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh back to Killing of Sadia Sheikh appeared at Wikipedia:WikiProject Feminism/Article alerts‎. I went to the talk page and expressed my ambivalence about doing this for the one article at the page. I was concerned because other women/feminism articles had been used as defacto Muslim bashing articles and I had gotten death threats from a sock puppet on one of them for disputing this behavior. Another editor discusses this at my talk page. Given this history, it seemed natural for me to leave a message at Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam. User:Plotspoiler complained I was canvassing and administrator User:Jayjg reverted my announcement calling it \"blatant\" and later mocked my explanations for its relevance here and here; in the latter case he mocked my saying we might have to bring the dispute to this noticeboard. Later I discovered that six articles had been changed from killing to honor killing by User:Plotspoiler and that four of them explicitly mentioned this involved Muslims. I proposed here that given the controversy of these six moves, proper Move Request policy be followed and said again that I though posting to Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam would be proper. Both User:PlotSpoiler and User:Jayjg ignored my proposal to follow proper procedure. And User:Jayjg replied here: \"Hard to believe these retroactive and absurdly weak excuses still continue. Carol, you got off easy; please accept your good fortune and move on.\" I believe he was inferring I was lucky he didn't sanction me for canvassing!\n\nUsers involved\n\nWho is involved in the dispute?\n\nKevin McE (talk · contribs)\n\nPlot Spoiler (talk · contribs)\n\nJayjg (talk · contribs)\n\nHave you informed all the editors mentioned above that you have posted this dispute? (If not, once you have informed them come back and replace the text \"Not yet\" with \"Yes\".)\n\nYes.\n\nN.B. To inform the other users you may place the text {{subst:DRN-notice|thread=Improper renaming of six articles}} --~~~~ in a new section on each user's talk page.\n\nResolving the dispute\n\nHave you tried to resolve this dispute already? If so, what steps have you taken?\n\nper the above, much discussion at Talk:Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh (only discussion on the page)\n\nHow do you think we can help?\n\nFirst, given these are controversial moves, should User:PlotSpoiler revert his changes and go to Wikipedia:Requested_moves and do a multiple listing of all six articles so the wider community can comment on each article's talk page? (Note: some are more notable than others in general; some have more refs than others labeling them \"honor killings.\") Second, since I believe bias colors both editors labeling of \"canvassing\" - especially after it was discovered this involved six articles, four explicitly about Muslims - I'd like a neutral opinion on whether mentioning this Move Request at Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam is canvassing. WP:Canvass explicitly says appropriate notification can be made on: The talk page of one or more WikiProjects (or other Wikipedia collaborations) directly related to the topic under discussion. I think this is just as relevant to this wikiproject as to Wikiproject Feminism where I first saw the notice and did finally put a posting.\n\nCarolMooreDC\n\nHonor killing naming discussion\n\nDiscussion about the issues listed above take place here. Remember to keep discussions calm, brief, and focused on the issues at hand.\n\nFirst of all, many of the points addressed have little or nothing to do with the topic at hand. Her accusations of \"Muslim bashing\" are unfounded and a severe lack of WP:AGF. Secondly, the article, Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh, has not one mention of Islam so it was clearly inappropriate for her to canvas for comment at WP:Islam, regardless of the content of the other honor killing articles (which she only checked retroactively).\n\nAt the time when I originally renamed these articles, over a week ago, there was no dispute and these articles had been mostly dormant. I renamed the articles as such, with the honor killing title, because that it was what makes all of these articles notable. The individuals aren't themselves notable but as recognized honor killings they are. In some articles \"Murder of...\" is used and in others \"Killing of...\" At the same time though, sometimes more specific terminology is used if that's what makes the event notable, such the Lynching of Jesse Washington. In this case, the determination that it was an honor killing is what makes this event notable, rather than it simply being a murder or killing. Honor killing has become the accepted term for the homicide of a member of a family or social group by other members due to the belief of the perpetrators that the victim has brought dishonor upon the family or community. It need not be viewed as a euphemism -- in fact, the term is not even mentioned once in the honor killing article.\n\nUltimately, I am prepared for a fair discussion of how these articles should be titled but carolmoore shouldn't be slandering me as being part of some Muslim-bashing campaign. A lot of this just seems like WP:IDONTLIKEIT, especially given that Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh passed all DYK criteria. Plot Spoiler (talk)\n\nIf all the articles are about Muslims, and the editor makes multiple possibly controversial changes without community discussion, and the editor edits regularly in aspects related to the topic, one can't help but wonder. Additionally your claiming the six articles were not notable until you make them so by adding \"honor\" to killing sounds like a strangely WP:POV/WP:OR argument. Perhaps some of these articles should in fact be AfD'd. Also, I don't think that whoever did the DYK review knew you'd changed the names of all six articles. And it was the speedy DYK after the name change that brought that one change to the attention of other editors in the first place, followed by the other five. In any case, all I'm asking for is a proper Request Move review of all six articles which would no long make the name changes open to suspicions of a quiet POV campaign. And the right of members of Wikiproject Islam to know that the Request for Move discussion is happening. CarolMooreDC\n\nOnce again, not all the articles are necessarily about Muslims and the Sadia Sheikh article does not once speak of Muslims or Islam so it has nothing to do with WP:Islam unless youare saying that only Muslims are responsible for honor killings, which isn't the case (Sikhs, Hindus, etc.). Therefore, it is not the right of WP:Islam members to be canvassed for participation in the article by you. And the DYK had nothing to do with those other articles -- just Sadia Sheikh. Stop obfuscating the issue and watch your borderline personal attacks by insinuating this is some secret anti-Muslim campaign. The only question at hand is whether \"honor killing\" should be retained in the title or not. Drop all your other nonsense. Plot Spoiler (talk)\n\nI have little or no interest in the issue of whether the RM was mentioned at WP:Islam or not (I would not see neutral mention of a matter of interest as canvassing, but anyway), but am disappointed that Plot Spoiler repeats his/her POV that the description \"need not be viewed as a euphemism\" when clear evidence that many RSs consider it to be such has been presented and not replied to. Which dispute do people actually have an interest in resolving here? Kevin McE (talk)\n\nHopefully a neutral editor can opine on whether articles that don't mention Muslims (though WP:RS might) can not be mentioned at Wikiproject Islam.\n\nRe Kevin's discussion of the actual addition of \"honor,\" I don't have a problem with issues about appropriateness of word being brought in. Just believe it needs to be done on six different unique articles with different WP:RS and different levels of notability. User:Plot Spoiler wrote he wants whatever is decided at Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh to rule the other articles. If he has changed his mind and is willing to revert back to the original names and then do a proper multiple name change request, then people can get into a variety of such issues on the talk page of each article. Then we would be done here. CarolMooreDC\n\n(Outside editor opinion) CarolMooreDC admits that she went to WikiProject Islam to solicit opinions to stop a move (Sadia Sheikh) that she thought could be \"used as defacto Muslim bashing\". She presented no reliable sources at the time connecting the portrayals of that death to \"Muslim bashing\" that would justify contacting WikiProject Islam as part of normal move procedure. Therefore, this was a case of malicious canvassing. If the Sadia Sheikh move was formally a multiple move request that involved honor killings of/by Muslims, then it might have been appropriate to contact WikiProject Islam. Shrigley (talk)\n\nI completely disagree. CarolMooreDC was correct in taking the issue to WikiProject Islam. The honor killing of Sadia Sheikh has Islamic ramifications even if those ramifications are not now in the article. The multiple article naming issue is something the WikiProject Islam people would want to know about. Carol is not guilty of malicious canvassing. Binksternet (talk)\n\nIt strikes me that the dispute is over a cultural issue and subjective judgement over whether these killings were 'proper' or not. Naming articles in such a fashion are, IMHO, in breach of WP:NPOV and WP:EDITORIAL. By prefacing the article title with \"Honor\", we are acceding to a bias to the \"orthodoxy\" of the killings in the eyes of the muslim code and against the general moralistc code, such as \"Murder of\". Wording in favour of one or other would be wrong. Instead of \"Honor killing of\" or \"Killing of\", we could adopt a more standard and neutral wording used in numerous WP articles. I would propose that we simply and objectively use \"Death of\" – no value judgement is thereby stated or implied. --Ohconfucius ¡digame!\n\nIf the only reason that the killing is notable is because it is an \"honor killing\", and if the WP:RS use that terminology - as they seem to do on the articles concerned - then it might be more editorial for Wikipedia to use some other word for it. However, the dispute is really about the propriety of contacting WikiProject Islam to influence a move discussion on an article that doesn't involve Islam or Muslims (as Sadia Sheikh doesn't), as part of some grand noble scheme to improve Muslim public relations. Wikipedia:Canvassing makes it clear that such messages are an abuse of Wikipedia. Shrigley (talk)\n\n\"if the WP:RS use that terminology - as they seem to do on the articles concerned\" but they only use the term in inverted commas, that is, in a manner whereby they are effectively saying \"this is claimed to be a matter of honour but there seems nothing inherently honourable about it\". We cannot show such nuances in an article title, so we should use what is unequivocably true: they were killings. Kevin McE (talk)\n\nOK, so would you say that the canvassing is a primary issue or secondary one? I thought all assembled wanted a resolution on what title would be most appropriate? --Ohconfucius ¡digame!\n\nThat's just Carol's ex post facto excuse for canvassing the WP:ISLAM board. She had no idea that the articles had been renamed when she first canvassed the board, and insisted she wanted dispute resolution for the canvassing issue. Later she discovered the article renamings, and then pretended that was what it had been about all along. As you can see, though, her story doesn't quite hang together, which is why you were confused as to what it's really about. Jayjg (talk)\n\nThe initiator of this discussion (Carol) asks two things: One, \"Should User:PlotSpoiler revert his changes and go to Wikipedia:Requested_moves and do a multiple listing of all six articles\"? and two, for \"a neutral opinion on whether mentioning this Move Request at Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam is canvassing.\" As Jayjg says, #1 seems to be less an actual request for dispute resolution than a rhetorical flourish connecting disparate Muslim and non-Muslim killings in order to retroactively justify her improper canvassing of Muslims. The actual discussion about the title is still happening at Talk:Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh#Requested move. Shrigley (talk)\n\nI've cross-posted this case to WP:NPOVN and WT:AT asking for more comments. --Ohconfucius ¡digame!\n\n(edit conflict) I see two related disputes here: the content dispute about the naming of the articles, and the conduct dispute about Carol's alleged canvassing. I think we should keep the content dispute to the requested move discussion - as it says at the top of this page, this noticeboard is not a place to take disputes already being discussed at another venue, and I don't think much will be gained by discussing the actual article naming here. I echo Kevin McE's sentiment that there has been evidence brought up there that hasn't been replied to, and I encourage editors to comment on the content issue there without getting distracted by the allegations of canvassing - we can deal with those here instead.\n\nSo, let me see if I can tease apart the different issues related to these allegations. In the original article, currently titled Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh, there is no mention of Islam, and honour killings themselves are not inherently connected to religion, per our article Honor killing. So there is no direct connection of the article to Islam. However, honour killings are often discussed in connection with Islam - note the mentions of the Qu'ran in the previous link - and as Sadia Sheikh's family were from Pakistan, it seems reasonable to deduce that they were Muslim. (Although, per the honor killing article, Sadia Sheikh's case may have had more to do with Pakistani culture and little or nothing to do with Islam.) So, I think it is fair to say that the article is indirectly related to Islam.\n\nNow, in WP:CANVASS it says notifying WikiProjects that are directly relevant is acceptable, but it doesn't say anything about WikiProjects that are indirectly relevant. It says that vote-stacking is definitely unacceptable, but what exactly constitutes vote-stacking is open to interpretation. My view is that the notifying of WikiProject Islam fell in a grey area, and that different editors will see it in different lights. Because of this, it was probably a mistake on Carol's part to post the initial notification without asking other participants in the requested move first. However, I see the action as having been made in good faith, and I don't agree with Shrigley's view above that it was \"malicious canvassing\", or with Jayjg saying that Carol was \"caught\", etc. although I think Jayjg was probably right to remove the notification. However, now that the focus of the discussion has broadened to other articles that use \"honor killing of\" in the title, and because honor killings are often discussed in relation to Islam, I think that now the discussion is relevant to WikiProject Islam, so I would support another notification being made there on these grounds. I can see that this dispute has been quite bitter for all involved, but I don't think that any further action is really appropriate here, so I encourage everyone to leave this incident behind and to get on with improving the encylopaedia. Best regards — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nThe multiple name changes withoutpassing it by the community is the bigger and more important issue to me. That is what this should focus on and has not as of yet What the actual name should be is the third issue and I'm sorry I didn't list it. However, it still can be discussed and possibly settled here Talk:Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh.\n\nMr. Stradivarius did a good summary of the canvassing issue. I did not notice whether the article explicitly mentioned Muslims. If I had had a more polite response from a more neutral editor, I might have seen the error of my ways. (Or else I might have looked at existing sources for the article to see if several made a big deal of the fact they were Muslims in a way that might be relevant to the article.) Once I noticed the multiple article name changes, and that all of individuals evidently were Muslim, it became clear it was a relevant place to post a notice. CarolMooreDC\n\nLooking at the page moves, Plot Spoiler's move at Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh wasn't a problem, as he was simply reverting Kevin McE's move. However, at the other 5 articles he reverted Kevin McE's revert, when the proper course of action would have been to simply list those articles at the requested move discussion at Talk:Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh. I also think this was done in good faith, though, and I see what they were getting at with their rationale of \"Moving back to previous title until parallel discussion at Talk:Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh is resolved\". I think next time it would be better for Plot Spoiler to list the discussion at requested moves rather than reverting someone's page move revert, but again, I don't think there's anything that requires further action here. Let's see if the current requested discussion reaches a consensus and take things from there. — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nActually, Kevin McE did not revert any of the titles here. They started at title A; Plot Spoiler moved them to title B; Kevin McE moved them to title C. (See the histories, as [10].) --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nAh, you're right. My apologies to everyone - I totally misread this, and I really should have checked more thoroughly before making my post. So actually there was no problem at all. I was confused because I was looking at Honor killing of Arash Ghorbani-Zarin, which moved from \"Murder of\" to \"Honor killing of\" to \"Killing of\" to \"Honor killing of\" - but looking at it again, that's not a problem either. — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nWe should only have \"Killing of\" or \"Death of\" in our article titles. Honor killing should not be given an air of acceptance in Wikipedia's voice. Reliable sources often put the honor of honor killing in scare quotes to signify its unacceptable quality in Western culture. Binksternet (talk)\n\nThat is definitely the other side of the coin which only occurred to me earlier today. That's why we need community input! CarolMooreDC\n\nSo is it \"safe\" for me to post the updated/clarified notice below to Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Islam or will I get \"in trouble\" with an Admin??\n\nRequested move on Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh: This is the only topic on Talk:Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh. Proposal is to change the title back to to Killing of Sadia Sheikh. Note the following articles also were changed recently to \"honor\" killing: Honor killing of Arash Ghorbani-Zarin, Honor killing of Hatun Sürücü, Honor killing of Fadime Sahindal, Honor killing of Samaira Nazir, Honor killing of Ghazala Khan. (signed)\n\nI have gotten support for doing so from several editors, here and elsewhere. CarolMooreDC\n\nSo is it \"safe\" for me to post...Whilst it is not ordinarily problematic to notify on relevant noticeboards, I'm not sure in this particular case. It seems obvious that certain cultures subscribe strongly to the concept of \"honour killing\", but it is not a concept generally accepted in the Western world, posting any such notification there could be construed as vote-stacking in that message is posted \"to users selected based on their known opinions\". I would suggest perhaps posting to WP:VP or {{cent}} as a better option. --Ohconfucius ¡digame!\n\nHmm... while I would support it, I can't speak for other editors, so it is probably safer not to. Instead I suggest notifying the WikiProjects who have tagged the articles, as no-one can reasonably contest the fact that they are directly relevant. It should already show up on their article alerts, but you may get a better response by leaving a message on the projects' talk pages. Ultimately, it's up to you how safe you want to play it. Best — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nThanks for advice. Though as discussed on the article talk page, Wikiproject Islam might have BOTH strong supporters and opposers of the proposal. So actually some excellent insights might be generated. FYI, after 5 years it hadn't occurred to me that the listing of Wikiprojects on an article talk page was an indication of best place to post a notice. So much to learn, so little time. Anyway... Put it on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Crime and Criminal Biography. If no response at all, perhaps will try Wikiproject Pakistan which is currently also listed in the article. CarolMooreDC\n\nBack to the WP:Consensus violation issue\n\nOk, now that I've admitted to my stupidity on canvassing, can we get back to my other main issue? The abuse of WP:Consensus by User:Plot Spoiler reverting without discussion User:Kevin McE's reverts of name changes to six articles? There is now an even split among various users brought in from the community about moving names BACK to the original. But that debate should be about changing it to a NEW title - and there's clearly no consensus to do that. So it is more important than ever that we deal with this original violation. Discussion at: Talk:Honor_killing_of_Sadia_Sheikh#Consensus_policy_and_BRD_demand_reverts_to_originals. CarolMooreDC\n\nJust for clarity, Kevin McE didn't revert. As I've pointed out at that discussion, he actually imposed new names on them. Five of the articles were originally at entirely different titles; User:Plot Spoiler reverted to his own, but not to the original. User:Plot Spoiler's reversion of the 6th restored the original title. The dispute overview above is mistaken as to what's happened. --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nYou are correct on this one article. I got confused because User:Plot Spoiler wanted to apply the decision made at Sadia Sheikh to Honor killing of Arash Ghorbani-Zarin, Honor killing of Hatun Sürücü, Honor killing of Fadime Sahindal, Honor killing of Samaira Nazir, Honor killing of Ghazala Khan. I guess I should just raise the issue of moving them back each of those talk pages. Sigh... CarolMooreDC\n\nI am correct in all of the articles. Kevin McE did not \"revert\" Plot Spoiler. He moved every article to an entirely new title. I don't particularly care which title these articles wind up at, but I am concerned that you are mischaracterizing Plot Spoiler's actions here -- he did not revert a revert. --Moonriddengirl (talk)\n\nActually, after checking the edit histories again, I can see that Moonriddengirl is right about all the articles. My original comment on them above was based on a sloppy misreading. — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nThe principle remains the same. User:Plot Spoiler still should have reverted to the original name - whatever it was - since User:Kevin McE had a problem with his change to \"honor killing.\" This is a good example of why when people start changing titles, it should revert to the original while discussions are going on. Especially when they do five or six at a time, which makes things very confusing. The onus remains on User:Plot Spoiler to do the right thing. CarolMooreDC\n\nActually, always reverting to some alleged prior consensus version isn't good for Wikipedia or supported by any of the policies. The best practice here is to remember that WP:There is no deadline, not even for identifying the best article title. It doesn't cost us (or the database) anything to have a page sits at a new title for a couple of days during discussions. Going back to the original title is the last resort and should happen only if the discussions fail to produce any sort of consensus. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nSo in that case I guess there should be a Requested move to \"Killing of\" for the other five articles and then each page would explain the reasons (which may differ) why that name not appropriate for that article? And then people can decide on a case by case basis and hopefully there would be a good community airing of the issue. CarolMooreDC\n\nI prefer the RfC suggestion given by Mike Cline in his closing comment - it seems like a good next step, whereas another requested move seems like it would just be more of the same. I'm not sure what the proper venue would be for such an RfC, though, so how about having it on Talk:Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh seeing as that's where all the prior discussion is? — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nSorry, forgot about RfCs. Probably because one would have to research the articles themselves first because a) it's not clear if all have sufficient WP:RS even supporting using the phrase on those killings and b) not sure of true notability of all of them (except that claimed by User:Plot Spoiler because he changed the name to \"Honor killing\"!). Anyway, if that mostly checked out, the best place probably would be Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Crime and Criminal Biography. I know Kevin McE expressed elsewhere his continuing unhappiness with the use of \"honor\" in the title for reasons I believe he gives above. CarolMooreDC\n\nCarol, why do you still continue to insist that \"User:Plot Spoiler still should have reverted to the original name\" or \"he changed the name to \"Honor killing\"\"? The original name of the article was Honor killing of Sadia Sheikh - Plot Spoiler created the article, and that's the name he first used. Jayjg (talk)\n\nI'm not doing that in Sadia Sheikh case, since I did realize later that it was a new article that User:Plat Spoiler had created with that name. I can see that my \"the principle remains the same\" message above does not make that explicit. Sorry. I was more explicit elsewhere this has been discussed. CarolMooreDC\n\nThe discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the dispute resolution noticeboard's talk page.

What is the issue you are bringing here?\n\nA (reputable) user user who does not share my opinions about what constitutes reliable sources in the article in question has completely and absolutely refused to discuss any particulars of her concerns, not only quoting no policy clauses nor any mention of the context of the subject matter, but refusing to even discuss the matter on the discussion page in any form. I have spent tedious hours examining the many policies she's referred me to, revising my work, and addressing her points with increasing civility and clarity. This has been met with all but name-calling insult on top of nothing productive. She responds to structural patterns that absolutely raise questions, but have no base in light of excessive addressing of those potential issues. She shows all but no sign she has, nor has any intention of, becoming familiar with the subject matter.\n\nUsers involved\n\nWho is involved in the dispute?\n\nSquish7 (talk · contribs)\n\nCindamuse (talk · contribs)\n\nShe acts habitually with actions that I'm sure benefit the encyclopedia more often than not; e.g. she aids me in becoming a better editor by directing me to policy files that do/may apply. Her skill and attention to detail are meticulous, but she has shown no ability to process particular exceptions to intrinsic structural patterns that flag, but do not confirm, problem areas.\n\nHave you informed all the editors mentioned above that you have posted this dispute? (If not, once you have informed them come back and replace the text \"Not yet\" with \"Yes\".)\n\nYes.\n\nN.B. To inform the other users you may place the text {{subst:DRN-notice|thread=Ryan Doyle}} --~~~~ in a new section on each user's talk page.\n\nResolving the dispute\n\nHave you tried to resolve this dispute already? If so, what steps have you taken?\n\nI've spent exhaustive time studying her concerns and addressing her points with precise attention to policy clauses, responding from an elite understanding and weighing of the context of the article and the sources she questions. She's addressed none of these particulars on the discussion page, and on her talk page, has collapsed to stating broad, insulting, surreal claims such as that I haven't even examined her references. She increasingly attacks my honesty and integrity, with less and less reference to anything relevant to the issue. I realize the totality of my claim here seems astoundingly unlikely, especially in light of her experience, but if you take into account all the information over the past month, it speaks for itself.\n\nHow do you think we can help?\n\nI would appreciate your suggestion on the most direct and efficient path to resolution. It may be difficult for me to go through a long series of intermediate steps, as I've done absolutely everything to resolve the issue peacefully. I can't imagine how anything but a ruling would solve the situation, but I am open to suggestions.\n\nSquish7 (talk)\n\nRyan Doyle discussion\n\nDiscussion about the issues listed above take place here. Remember to keep discussions calm, brief, and focused on the issues at hand.\n\nNote: the linkrot issue has been addressed. All refs now use {{cite}} templates. Cheers, benzband (talk)\n\nUnfortunately, the link rot remains. For further information, see Wikipedia:Link rot. We work to address linkrot by providing the exact title, author, publisher, and date of the source. If the link goes bad, this added information can help a future Wikipedian, either editor or reader, locate a new source for the original text, either online or a print copy. Feel free to contact me if you have questions. Best regards, Cind.amuse (Cindy)\n\nI took the time to learn proper citing via your example when I first wrote the article. There are good reasons I wasn't thorough with my latest revision. 1. The way I'm utilizing sources is tricky, and I wanted the issue of whether or not they should even exist be solved before I went polishing. 2. I'm fatigued. I've spent hours, and hours, and hours adhering to your wishes, tediously reading files, revising, rewording, to no avail. I'm just plain tired. I didn't think it was an issue that needed immediate attention. Squish7 (talk)\n\nHum, i'd better post up here. (or you'll get lost ;) I have fixed the capitalization issue. On the linkrot issue, I have provided the author, title and dates on all citations that :\n\nHadn't been already done by Squish7\n\nProvided such information on the linked page.\n\nThank you for correcting my note; i was only trying to help. The tag-bombing to which the article was subjected, whether justified or not, is enough to discourage any editor. This seemed to particularly spark Squish as he had been writing lengthly comments on the talk page about referencing and so on; which appeared to go unnoticed. Cheers, and hoping some solution can be found soon, benzband (talk)\n\nWould it help if I reinforced my new paragraphs with references to all the more objective sources? I could have done that, but I thought it completely redundant, as Cindy has pruned down my references when I put too much initially. I thought his notability was enough where I didn't have to put 2 or 3 references at the end of every single sentence. I was following her example, and figured she'd help me tweak it. I chose his own videos for the new sections because it's more useful to explore his full tutorials than go to a newspaper than says \"Ryan Doyle has expert tutorials\". The latter is implied by the slew of support in the main summaries, and verifiable if the collective set of sources is examined. I was specifically told there was no need for speedy deletion, and figured extensions which a spectrum of the sources support, would not need infinite backing. Squish7 (talk)\n\nHi again Squish - from your comment here it looks like you might be confusing notability and verifiability. An article doesn't have to have any references for its subject to be notable. To illustrate this, take a look at this page, the very first draft of the Wikipedia article on Michael Jackson back in 2001. This draft contains a grand total of one reference to ananova.com, which probably wasn't a reliable source (hard to tell now because the link is dead). So the article doesn't show that Michael Jackson is notable at all, as there are no reliable sources to back up its claims. However, I don't think anyone was about to doubt that Michael Jackson was notable. He was notable because many newspaper articles, books, documentaries, etc. existed covering him. So sources don't need to be in a Wikipedia article for someone to be notable - they do, however, have to exist somewhere. Verifiability, on the other hand, means proving that everything we say in an article is accurate. We do this by citing every claim that could be contested to a reliable source. So even though notability and verifiability both involve sources, they are not really the same thing. Hope this makes sense. — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nI understand the difference. I stress notability so much as a side effect of Cindy's stressing of the converse (that reliability is irrelevant if the subject matter isn't \"encyclopedic\"). Particularly, she said that \"personal philosophies\" aren't notable in any scenario. This didn't make sense to me, i.e. because it was so vague. She wouldn't follow up with clarification, no matter how civil or exhaustive I was able to address her points. I wrote a blurb addressing his teaching style, therefore, avoiding what she'd cautioned against. She tore that down with neither particular explanation nor any suggestion for revision. My latest revision had to take more wild guesses at what she and the encyclopedia thought was appropriate, trying to learn from the bare removal and not make the same mistake. I improved my adherence to policy, making my blurb less vlogesque and other sins, but she simply tagged the article with four tags. Not a word of suggestion on what to do, what she wanted, what was appropriate. My main \"dispute\" has been with her hypocrisy of completely refusing to communicate no matter how much I attempt to adhere to induced policy, doing the exact opposite of giving the praise I would expect of being so diligent and attentive. That is, calling me effectively stubborn, disrespectful, and dishonest. It doesn't matter that she says she doesn't intend so, it is the direct implication of her actions and statements. I don't have a dispute with policy, I have a dispute with her actions regarding it. Squish7 (talk)\n\nHi everyone, I'm a clerk at this noticeboard, and I haven't been involved with this dispute before. First off, I found the way this request was worded a little vague, so allow me to ask a question. Am I right in saying that this dispute has occurred because the article uses mostly primary sources, whereas Cindamuse would like to see it written with mostly secondary sources? — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nI've utilized a wide, even spectrum of sources, everything down to Doyle's official webpage to completely independent news sources. Many of the sources re-inforce huge portions of the article, so much that I would have to have a dozen references at the end of each sentence to display how thoroughly Doyle's notability is. I gave tedious attention to laying down an exhaustive foundation, because I knew these issues (reliability of sources) would be raised. Doyle studied Media at Hope University, and professionally utilizes video publication as his main output to the world. Because he utilizes YouTube for the main bulk of his videos (a technicality, as they are linked to and embedded on a variety of other publishers), this flags the possibility I'm just throwing some random Joe's vlog videos up on Wikipedia. It's so absurd a possibility that I've probably spent a full-time work week into proving the reliability of his videos factually. Also note that many of these videos are produced by other parties. He just seems to accumulate a lot of them. He shot a 30-second Red Bull commercial, for instance, that is only on YouTube through his personal page. (Please note that identical videos on YouTube aren't permitted; if a video applies or involves multiple parties, only one copy can be featured.)\n\nCindy has accepted the infinitely minimal foundation (about ten sentences covering basic facts), yet objects as I move outward with treating Doyle's videos as strict self-publications. I've spent half of last month digesting the files she's referred me to, and can now back up my opinions with particulars. She refuses to address any specific clauses, or provide any references to the sources I've used. I am open to that the article may need revising, but no one has even attempted to attack the red tape I've laid out.\n\nPlease see \"DISPUTE: Start Here\" for more reference on the Doyle discussion page. Squish7 (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) You can find more information on the article's talk page, as well as my own and that of Squish7. Essentially, I came across the article as initially created, cleaned it up, and offered the creator a barnstar for encouragement, along with some guidance. User:Chzz and User:Peridon additionally offered assistance. Squish7 essentially disregarded the information, asserting notability through primary sources. There have been basic issues with cleanup and compliance with the MOS. We don't require that all sources are secondary, however, notability cannot be established through primary sources. Squish7 disagrees, asserting that the subject is an authority and as such, self-published sources, including personal videos, blogs, and his own website are sufficient as citations. I have encouraged him to make an inquiry at the reliable sources noticeboard, to no avail. Squish7 simply lacks a thorough understanding of the reliable sources guidelines, rationalizing that qualifiers used in various guidelines, such as \"generally\" essentially allow for loopholes (my term), while additionally claiming allowances to ignore all rules. WP:SPS states that, \"Anyone can create a personal web page or pay to have a book published, then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published media, such as books, patents, newsletters, personal websites, open wikis, personal or group blogs, Internet forum postings, and tweets, are largely not acceptable as sources.\" The inclusion of the term \"largely\" offers another qualifier to which Squish7 uses to disregard the guideline altogether. In WP:SELFPUB, Squish7, interprets the content to allow self-published sources. The guidelines state, \"Self-published and questionable sources may be used as sources of information about themselves, usually in articles about themselves or their activities, without the requirement in the case of self-published sources that they be published experts in the field...\" Squish7 interprets this to allow for the use of self-published sources, believing that the passage does not refer to the sources being allowed about the sources themselves, but rather the subject of the article, whatever or whoever that subject may be. Essentially, Squish7 has been misinterpreting policy or relying on technicalities to justify inappropriate actions. He continued reverting cleanup and making threats of reports and whatnot. I've continually suggested that he simply contact the WP:RSN for further assistance, but he has failed to do so. I have continued to explain the various guidelines, while providing direct links for further information. He has insisted in proof and justification in legal terms that he is wrong. I can only point him to the policies and guidelines. Essentially, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. In my opinion, there is a clear competence issue. I have no dispute with this user. Squish7 has a dispute with the guidelines and has transferred his frustration onto me. I have suggested that he may benefit from seeking out a mentor through the adopt-a-user program. Hopefully, he'll consider it. Best regards, Cind.amuse (Cindy)\n\nDoyle is a definitive \"reliable source\" per the condition that an expert constitutes one. The expertise I have given exhaustive proof of. Major statements from strongly objective sources (e.g. \"Ryan Doyle is a world-renowed parkour athlete\") give Doyle credibility for stating things that an expert would state, via more subjective publications (his website, etc.) If an established expert publishes a work, that work has serious weight as reliable, verifiable material. When I refer to passages governing questionable use, I'm usually attempting to reinforce what's already established. It's a secondary backing (i.e. that a lot of my use would strongly be covered under this rule; his philosophy largely constitutes information about himself, supporting the obvious that an expert in a subject should be able to speak of their own ideas of their area of expertise.)\n\nMy opinion of the source of Cindy's objection is her experience as a professional writer. She can't parse the idea of \"publishing\" via video networking. It's a completely new, non-textual medium, superior in many ways to thousands of years of text-only publications. Youths most utilize this medium, so it's rarely used for professional works. Doyle's college-level study of media give him even more weight to being able to utilize video networking professionally. Even further, Doyle deals with a discipline that is almost entirely youth-based (i.e. teens, 20s, etc.) He has infinite motive to utilize video networking the way he does. This is unorthodox to Cindy, so she alludes to passages that govern the issue, considering words like \"largely\" to blacklist the entire planetary medium of video networking from being utilized in any way in the largest online encyclopedia in the world. I believe this particular case to be the way she would argue for any reputable expert utilizing video networking as a professional means of output. Squish7 (talk) (revised)\n\nSquish7, I appreciate what you're saying, but you need to understand that on Wikipedia we really like articles to be sourced to secondary sources, as they are generally better than primary sources in terms of neutrality and in proving that things are notable. You are welcome to use primary sources for citing simple facts, but an entire article constructed from primary sources is a problem. Looking through Google News and Google Books, I can't see many references that mention Doyle more than in passing. It may be that there is simply not enough secondary source material out there to create more than a very short article. I'm thinking that maybe the best solution here would be to create a new List of parkour athletes and redirect the article to Doyle's entry in it. Let me know what you both think of this suggestion. Best — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nFirstly, this is the first time anybody has even graced explaining policy in context with the topic. That Ryan Doyle doesn't appear in Google News & Books, and other articles do, gives me a direct, useful measuring tool. I requested a particular review of the article the moment I created it, inquiring how well I did balancing sources. I've been redirected infinitely to the very guideilnes I carefully observed while writing it, inducing how I did from what has and hasn't been removed.\n\nOff the bat, I was given negativity about the sources I've used (i.e. \"we don't trust organizers like Red Bull\"), and yet the stub article heavily referencing Red Bull remained completely intact. Combined with Cindy's praise, my only conclusion is that the context, the whole picture, is a very special and important factor that I utilized correctly. From there, she gave me more vague negatives, failing to address context, removing my work, referring to guidelines I digested so thoroughly I gave exhaustive explanations of my reasoning. All went unanswered. There answer isn't in all those specific clauses, because they don't solidly address the balance and whole picture, and they certainly don't comment on Ryan Doyle particularly.\n\nI still disagree that I have too few secondary sources to warrant the length article that exists, or at least, I'm open to input. Still, nobody has addressed the balance of my sources. I reference five objective sources: American Parkour, parkour.com, Marvel comics, UWIRE / San Diego State University interview, and the Cayman Compass (a printed newspaper). Semi-objective sources (big organizations which have featured him or in which he's involved) include MTV, Red Bull, and the WFPF.\n\nThese eight sources lap over eachother significantly, such that his notability is referenced almost as much as more in-depth things, like his opinions/philosophies about parkour. If eight sources are enough to establish his basic ability, then 5 or 6 sources plus his personal sites which may especially be used for information about himself, such as his ideas, should be enough, I feel, to warrant the length of the article that's currently up. Please note Cindy has pruned down my references. I originally used 26 particulars for a mere 10 sentences. I understand the need for brevity, but the point is, I established an extra thorough foundation by heavily supporting those 10 sentences. I think that's enough to put forth that the videos I reference would be supported by those sources if they were to analyze them. His self-publication videos will not appear as \"books\" (in Google Books) because they are video-based. The freely open internet is such a good publication means, that his self-published works should have the same weight as, for instance, a published short story more easily referenced. You might even consider that parkour/freerunning internet sites are very similar to magazines that would officially publish his works. Squish7 (talk)\n\nI've given your suggestion thought and came up with a comparison. The list of parkour athletes you suggest sounds of akin length to the list of Harry Potter characters in Dumbledore's Army, the school in the Harry Potter series. (Correct me if I'm wrong.) It seems to me that the real-life athletic discplines of parkour, freerunning, and tricking should constitute much more notability than this fictional academy. If minor Harry Potter characters have 2-4 paragraphs of description, then I think a major real-life parkour/freeruning/tricking athlete should warrant a very full article.\n\nI chose this instance because these descriptions are based on one general primary source, the Harry Potter saga. They're notable because the saga is notable. In this manner, I think thoroughly establishing Doyle's notability should allow latitude for several paragraphs of description on that foundation, without needing every third sentence to be linked to a fully secondary source. (This type of discussion that could have happened weeks ago. I'm your sure your response will be productive, as long as it addresses the relationship between these two examples.) Thank you in advance for any response. Squish7 (talk)\n\nSorry, I didn't read this last reply until after writing my post below. Hopefully my post will still be of use though. — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nBefore we talk about balance, let me dissect the sources you have used. First the ones you listed as being objective: I see Cayman Compass as being a reliable source that we can use, but I think that it is of limited use in determining notability because it is a local paper. (I've been in my local paper, and I wouldn't say I deserve a Wikipedia article.) Marvel Comics doesn't look like a reliable source, I'm afraid - they are obviously trying to promote their products, i.e. Daredevil, and I can't imagine that they have much independent fact-checking going on. I would maybe say we could use it to cite simple facts, but there are probably better sources for the few simple facts it contains anyway.\n\nI would say that parkour.com and American Parkour are reliable sources, but beware of using them when drawing comparisons between parkour and other sports, as they will obviously treat parkour in a favourable light. The UWIRE interview is obviously a primary source, as it is Doyle himself providing most of the content - it does, however, show that someone considered him notable enough to interview him. I presume UWIRE is a student newspaper or something like that, though, which means they can only count towards notability so much. The argument for that is similar to the one for the Cayman Compass above. However, we must be careful to check who actually published it - in this case I see that the UWIRE interview was uploaded to YouTube by a user named RyanDoylePKTV, which makes me doubt that it has actually been published by someone independent of Doyle.\n\nThe sources you classified as \"semi-objective\" I would class as primary sources - they are obviously involved with Doyle and we shouldn't expect them to be impartial in their views on him. I think we should treat them the same as we would his personal sites. So at my count of secondary sources, we have three: two specialist parkour sources and one local newspaper. This is not the best evidence of notability, but I think that this, plus the other mentions in Google News, plus the fact that he won at least one major parkour competition would be enough to see the article kept were it nominated for deletion. Still, it doesn't look like enough to write a good-length article to me, so as I see it the article will have to be made shorter. You don't have to take my word for all of this though - that is what we have the reliable sources noticeboard for. Let me know what your thoughts are after reading this. Best — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nI appreciate the input and participation in this discussion. Much of what has been said is a repeat of my previous advice to Squish7. I understand the rationale behind creating a list of parkour athletes and would support creating the list article, believing it would be beneficial to the project overall. I also think it would be great if Squish7 would consider creating the list. That said, at the same time, I support retaining the Ryan Doyle article. An entry could be made in the list for Doyle, with a link to his article. I don't see the viability of a lengthy article, due to a lack of secondary sources, but believe the competitions won indicate notability to forgo deletion. As a side note, there have been comments about my professional background. While I do work as a professional writer, I have also worked in film. As far as videos themselves, I began working on a web series (available on YouTube), from which a documentary has been produced by a British film crew and is now circulating US film festivals, including Miami, Los Angeles, and last week in San Diego. The doc has been honored as Best Documentary Feature and Best Documentary Concept at the Los Angeles International Underground Film Festival. Just an FYI. Best regards, Cind.amuse (Cindy)\n\nI apologize for making definitive assumptions. I retain, though, that any significant background in professional writing will likely affect one's evaluation of my idea that the nullification of need for publication should drastically reduce otherwise more-strict sourcing requirements. You have made many more grotesque inductions about me, however. You're repeated phrase that I have \"dispute with policy\" is nominated by my actions, but not actually true, especially in light of me telling you I do not. You say that I'm not lying, but that my actions speak more loudly. This translates to \"your actions have dispute with policy, though you don't consciously realize it\". This would be cause for communication, then, not silence.\n\nFurther off the chart is/was my claim that I was already well familiar with the policies you've referred me to well before I created a discussion page. Putting faith in that claim in an innocent-before-guilty manner would have saved both of us all this frustration. Your very first words to me were, \"Honestly, it's doesn't sound like...\". Please spit me the precise percentage of situations, in toneless text on the internet sans a world of context like who I am and how I think, that turn out not to be the way the \"sound\". You can't even graze the idea that you could have behaved differently. Half my frustration is that I've taken extra personal time to explain how to avoid such situations in the future to help improve your skills, while you say I've just tried your patience (vs. \"thanks\" or \"maybe I made a mistake here\").\n\nBottom line, Mr. Stradivarius's four paragraphs have been the only feedback so far directly attentive to the only main thing I ever asked, stated clear as crystal at the start of my first post: for a close particular review of the article/sourcing; how well I applied policy. To direct me to policy continuously never even addressed the main question I had. If you can't see that not addressing the main question I had would cause frustration/confusion/etc, there has to be something major you can improve about your online communication skills. Squish7 (talk)\n\nI appreciate the apology. Understand that all editors work within established parameters. While you may have ideas and suggestions to revise reliable sources guidelines to support a specific genre, there is not one set of \"rules\" for one individual or group and another for the rest of society. And while some days I wish I were... I am not the person with whom to share your suggestions and concerns. Establishing guideline exemptions for one group would involve a community-wide proposal, discussion, and successful consensus, which would more than likely fail with a trout. Over a week ago, after you presented your unique perspective of what constitutes a reliable source, I recommended that you present your concerns and suggestions to the reliable sources noticeboard for discussion. You chose not to do that, while continually telling me that \"you read that link\". If you read it, why did you not decide to make an entry there? I think it's great that you have eventually chosen to interact with others there. Please be patient and keep in mind that we are all volunteers. I would recommend that you be a bit more detailed in your questions there, so that others may know and understand to what type of sources you are referring. The entry was rather vague, which may lead to a lack of response from others unwilling or unable to discern your intent, motive, or desire. Forgo the abstract and be as specific (and brief) as possible. Another note regarding disputes. You have stated on the article talk page that you \"have a dispute with [an] editor challenging Doyle's reliability as an author for information about himself and of parkour technique.\" I have merely provided information and links for further reading. I'm not sure how this turned into a dispute with me. Essentially, you disagree with (or misinterpret) the guidelines and policies and have a desire to change them, believing that they should not apply to parkour or its participants. Rather than offer personal opinions and convictions, I have engaged with you in an effort to offer assistance. And yet, I have continually been met with arguments and threats. The information and guidance that I have provided has been based on established policies and guidelines. If you have difficulty understanding or comprehending the guidelines, your dispute is not with me, but with the policies and guidelines. In my opinion, you have transferred your frustration on to me. I sincerely apologize that I have not been better able to help you come to a greater understanding of the community's expectations. I hope that Mr. Stradivarius and others at the RSN will be able to share things to a mutually successful conclusion. Through this, you have stated that I have failed to respond to you, which has left me puzzled. It has now become apparent that your walls of text on the article talk page were targeted toward me. Honestly, unless an editor lets me know that they are attempting to communicate directly with me on an article talk page, I have no idea they are looking specifically for \"my\" response. Communication on an article talk page is intended for any editor interested in the article. I'm a volunteer in the community, just like everybody else. Growing tired of our earlier attempts at communication, I chose to forgo reading your comments, leaving an opportunity for others to engage and respond. Sometimes, when others fail to \"get it\", it's best to figuratively walk away, hoping others can fill in the gaps where I have failed. And clearly, I am not infallible. I sincerely apologize for this entire mess. I still think it would be awesome if you would consider creating a list article of various notable parkour participants. This could be created using individuals within the parkour and traceur categories. If you have further desire to communicate with me, please use this forum or my talk page, rather than attempting to communicate in various other locations. Thanks. Best regards, Cind.amuse (Cindy)\n\nI appreciate your thoroughness, and it's unfortunate this took up so much of your time. I will address just one major point, though. It was never my intention to change or revise policy. You came up with that. The point, spirit, heart, and soul of WP:YT is stated directly and definitively, not inferred: i.e. that \"anybody can throw up videos and claim to be an expert, hence...\" That Doyle is an expert nullifies the premise, the \"if\" of the \"if..then\", explicitly voiding the general ban. It's not a loophole, exception, bending, manipulation, or suggestion. If such-and-such can only be used in X case, and X case is fulfilled, such-and-such can be used, by clear, plain default of that clause, and in addition, all the general policies that apply to what types of information should and shouldn't be in Wikipedia. Aside, the general taboo is also apparent to someone who's surfed here an hour, and excruciatingly obvious to someone who's edited for years. Whatever precise wording the guidelines use is 99% irrelevant sans a clause governing budding media-educated video-networking professional traceurs. Lacking that, the only thing left is the definitive general policies, part of which dictate that all factors including content be carefully weighed and addressed.\n\nI \"targeted\" a very precise core base: basic notability. Having that core (only) slightly altered in a way I already knew might be a touchy point, showed excellent sense of what should and should not be included. Hence, I either read the relevant files, or induced them from long-term experience. Even if that base could not be expanded by the sources I had, then obsessively reinforcing it necessarily, mathematically invites justification for extension. Like I said, if a minor Harry Potter character has 2-4 paragraphs with no references at all outside the pre-establishing of the notability of the series, then it's extremely reasonable to suppose that an ubersolid establishment of a real-life international pro athlete and educator, would allow paragraphs of extra information with minimal or no sourcing. Hence, I figured his personal videos could be at the absolute least, allowed frosting. Once more, I can reinforce those paragraphs with secondary information, but you pruned down my sources when did that so heavily to the root sentences, I thought it redundant. I'd still like to know if that would fulfill your/the requirements. I still barely have a sense of what precisely and particularly may be allowed or not.\n\nExamples like these are things that as a collective set, cast tacit policy on what Wikipedia allows and does not allow. You are more versed with the greater set of precedents (all the articles you've ever read or edited), granting you expertise to apply to the issue. I'm the one who could factor in the content analysis, however, as that's an integral factor for how to achieve special, unique precision to this case. Posting 1-2 paragraphs specifically avoiding the philosophy issue I didn't understand your point on (in my first addition anyway), I thought, would just meet light revision. This is the very first and founding thing I sought: a close critique. Elite attentiveness to that question and the information at hand would have revealed all this. I'll try to let this be the last time I lodge the suggestion for improving in this area. I've made my point about as crystal as it's going to get. Squish7 (talk)\n\nClearly this discussion is going nowhere. Your \"content analysis\" does not correlate to the Wikipedia community. There has simply been a misinterpretation and misapplication of the policies and guidelines. Your point is crystal, but conflicts with that of the project. I wish you well, but due to a lack of fruit in the discussion, I'll remain hopeful that Mr. Stradivarius and others at the RSN will be able to share things to a mutually successful conclusion. Best regards, Cind.amuse (Cindy)\n\nI wouldn't have started a dispute thread if I thought more discussion with you would be fruitful, per se. We've simply refined wording, respect, and civility. You simply have an inability to sift out experience factors and respect that someone may disagree with your interpretation of policy. A thinking person should be able to teach what they know, respect opinion, defend views, and yield to superior experience base, at the same time. That is the mark of an elite teacher.\n\nIt's the sheer vehemency of which you demonstrate bias and inability to uphold NPOV to which I object. You've taken actions so intrinsically ridiculous that they reveal bias taints your decisions in regards to Ryan Doyle. Saying my disclaimer that I have exhaustively analyzed policy essentially admits wrongdoing, shows an inability to weigh all sorts of other options. Perhaps I: A) didn't understand policy; B) had an opinion based on information I could prove if given latitude; C) miscommunicated with you; D) concluded things from my superior source-analysis that you would agree with... All these call for explanation, suggestion, analysis, conversing, etc. We live in an innocent-before-guilty and a polite-before-mean world. You've taken the most hostile, cruel, and easy options available to you, for this allows you to retain final say about the content. Telling Ben just yesterday that I removed your tags when I removed only one out of four, leaving out that I explicitly told I would respect and study the other three, to bend that I'm a completely unreasonable person, is just one of many other examples. That's not a light bend, it's a completely cruel twisting of facts to support things that are entirely not there. I have put incredible work into learning from you, studying what you want me to study, revising my writing, tediously doing all the things that with a more objective person would have resulted by now in an article much more balanced, productive and at harmony with all relevant sides.\n\nAnother thing that proves you biased intrinsically is that you really can't even have an opinion not prone to fault given that I've done work you haven't. If I claim vastly superior weighing of X or Y policy factor, you can be of the opinion \"you probably didn't do it right\", but it's not an argument for a total stance, nor a reason for not speaking your opinion in a way that addresses that content, even if the only purpose is to help me learn. Even if you are 100% in the right and do indeed speak for everybody, just removing my work without giving any suggestion how to improve it is just plain destructive, if not explicitly forbidden, and I feel you'll continue to do that at this point. That my new paragraphs contain 100% trash given all my study of the policy and topic matter is absurd. You could suggest \"try condensing to X length\" or \"this would be fine if you could back all this heavily with the more objective sources\". You just shouldn't be monitoring an article while considering yourself immune to explanation, suggestion, discussion, and respect. Telling me to explore and inquire ad nauseum until I agree with you or give up just won't cut it. Squish7 (talk)\n\nSquish, this post of yours contains multiple personal attacks on Cindamuse, which is really not acceptable. If you read our policy on making no personal attacks it says that you should \"comment on the content, not on the contributor\". I can understand that you are upset about the content of the article, but this doesn't excuse your making negative accusations about other editors. As for the article itself, I have been thinking about the best way to proceed here, and I have come to the conclusion that showing you how the rules apply will be more effective than telling you. So I think it's about time I gave the article a Copy Edit. Note the capital letters. This may be some tough medicine, but I hope that we will still be on speaking terms afterwards. Best — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nArticle aside, I'm not sure how I can go on editing here without knowing the difference between my personal \"attacks\" here, and Cindy's general behavior over the past month. Part of my dispute is that I've strived to improve my civility, professionalism, and knowledge base (no particular order), while being relentlessly met with accusations and cruel etiquette. How could I lodge this complaint without \"commenting on the contributer\"? She just posted blatant public misinformation and baseless defamation about me, how do I respond to that? I'm open to anything grazing a balanced response (e.g. \"She shouldn't post lies about you, but...\"), but I put no stock in a reprimand that lends tacit support to her defamation. Squish7 (talk)\n\nHi again Squish - as it looks like this thread has progressed into a conduct dispute only, I'll close the thread here. If you want to pursue your grievances with Cindamuse further, then the correct place to do that is at Wikiquette assistance. That will also have the advantage of getting a fresh pair of eyes looking at the dispute, which would be good, as I have become thoroughly involved with the Ryan Doyle article since my Copy Edit. If you do have any more questions about the content, then you can ask them back at the article's talk page, and I'll be happy to respond to them there. All the best — Mr. Stradivarius ♫\n\nThe discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the dispute resolution noticeboard's talk page. No further edits should be made to this discussion."
