        "text": "During our Fall Break trip to the UAE, we spent two nights in the Dubai exclave of Hatta, a small town of 12,000 people high up in the Hajar (Rocky in English) Mountains. It is an ‚Äúexclave‚Äù because it belongs to the Emirate of Dubai, but it is enclosed by two other Emirates on two sides and on the other two sides by the country of Oman. Hatta was once part of Oman but the ownership was transferred to Dubai in 1850 because the Sultan of Oman at the time, could not defend the region against a rival group in Oman.\n\nToday it is a vacation destination for expatriates and Emiratis because of the elevation it is less humid and cooler than Dubai. We drove our rental car the 83 miles (134 kilometers) from Dubia to the Ja Hatta Fort Resort. The resort is located just outside of town and was quite nice. We enjoyed the pools and played tennis as well as having some good meals in the restaurant. It was quite relaxing and we could have stayed a few extra days. It reminded me of what I think Palm Springs would be like, a nice town in a desert setting. If I lived in Dubai, I would go out there often.\n\nOn the second night, Oliver and I drove through the town and checked out the Hatta Dam, one of the major attractions of the area. They were well set up for kayaking/pedal boating, and as you can see in the video above, I went for a paddle around the reservoir the next morning before we headed back to the airport.\n\nThe Dubai government is investing in the town and there were some good roads and parks. The is also a network of hiking trails along creeks and in the canyons but we didn‚Äôt have enough time to explore them. Oliver and I did take in the views from a historic fort. Driving through the town, there was not much going on with groups of men sitting in front of storefronts or women sweeping the front sidewalks.\n\nWe were finally able to host a big Thanksgiving Dinner on Thursday after a couple of years of COVID concerns. In my role as the director of the school, I like to invite non-Americans in our community to experience the quintessential American holiday. We are fortunate to have affordable domestic support and a large house to be able to accommodate a lot of people. This year I think we finished with 34 guests and people from Australia, Mexico, Israel, India, Ireland, England, and the USA. Nadia prepared my favorite stuffing/dressing and Bolivian corn salad. As you can see from the photos, we ate and drank is 100% satiation. Due to the large American population at the school, TIS gives the community a half-day off on Thursday, but we don‚Äôt get Black Friday off.\n\nThis year‚Äôs Thanksgiving dinner was different because the World Cup is taking place in November. Of course, we had South Korea ‚Äì Uruguay game and it added to the festivities. The kids loved our dartboard and table tennis which kept them occupied between courses. Mercifully due to time differences, the Detroit Lions, my favorite professional American football team, game kicked-0ff after midnight. The National Football League traditionally schedules the Lions to play on Thanksgiving and they usually lose and it puts a damper on the festivities in my house. They actually played well on Thursday against one of the best teams in the league this year, the Buffalo Bills, losing on a last-second field goal. Despite being 4-7 this season, I am really entertained by the team. They were featured on HBO Hard Knocks during the preseason which brought the team publicity and they have one of the highest-scoring offenses in the NFL. They have some young, exciting players and with the Los Angeles Ram‚Äôs first-round draft pick this June, they will be able to get two more good players if they draft well. They need better players on defense.\n\nI have much to be thankful for and the holiday reminds us to reflect on what is good in our lives. As I get older, I appreciate more relationships and how fleeting special occasions are in life. I am lucky to have a loving family and be able to interact with so many smart, interesting and good people in the expatriate school community and Uzbek friends.\n\nOcean and Oliver finished their cross-country running season today with the final meet of the season. The video above is Ocean running in the Under Age 15 4-kilometer Race. She finished in 4th place, just out of the medals behind three girls from the Mirabad Soccer Club. I didn‚Äôt get much video due to the pouring rain and I was helping with the timing. She has not been running as much earlier in the season. She peaked for the CAFA Championship in Bishkek. Ocean ran a 19:30 and gave a good effort. She was in third place for much of the and couldn‚Äôt hold on on the final long loop around the gardens.\n\nOliver couldn‚Äôt run today as his foot is still injured from last weekend‚Äôs soccer tournament. He was kicked in the foot and it is still a bit tender. We may have to take him to a doctor this week for an x-ray.\n\nWe have had a lot of rain this month which is a little unusual. Most precipitation occurs December through April but I would guess we‚Äôve had much more than the 2 centimeters average. We‚Äôve had several days of full-day rain.\n\nI ran in the 3-kilometer coaches/parents run. I didn‚Äôt feel great but pushed through to finish in 10th place. I love running and was just happy to be out there and we had a lot of fun. The students get a big kick of cheering us on and watching us suffer. üôÇ Long distance running has brought me so much pleasure over the years and I am glad that I am still able to share my passion with my children and wife. I have been so busy at work over the past month or so and it is disappointing how fast older people can get out of shape. I need to make more time for physical fitness and hopefully this run will spur me on! Nadia was a great support person as always!\n\nOne bummer was losing my best pair of glasses. They fell out of my pocket while I was running around filming and timing‚Ä¶ I hope someone turns them in.\n\nI had such a joyful day at the Samarkand Marathon last weekend. My daughter Ocean, her friend, and I ran the 10-kilometer race and it was special for me to be able to coach the girls to complete the run. At age 55, I am grateful I can still run long distances considering I started on my high school cross-country running team at her age back in 1981. The girls overcame discomfort and some pain to complete the run in about an hour.\n\nThis is the biggest public race in Uzbekistan. Race organizers have made it to be an international-standard massive road race. There were people from 40 different countries running with 1,080 runners in the 2km and 1,210 runners in the 10km. They also organized a music concert and other events over the weekend.\n\nSamarkand is a beautiful city with ancient mosques and madrassas preserved from the 14th century. The city was the capital of Amir Temur (Tamerlane in the west) empire. He was one of the great warrior-conquerers that came after Ghengis Khan. He probably killed more people than Hitler and Stalin combined. 900 years later though, he is considered a hero here in Uzbekistan. Anyway, he had an eye for design and captured artisans and architects and lots of slaves, helping Temur build an impressive city in the middle of the desert.\n\nForeigners are rare in Samarkand than in Tashkent and people were fascinated with our dog Obi. We only saw one other dog during the weekend. The people were very friendly and we had a nice stay at the Bibikhanum Hotel, next to the mosque of the same name. I recommend The Platan Restaurant for lunch and dinner. Gourmet salads and lamb from the grill as well as other choices, are all high quality.\n\nWe drove from Tashkent because all of the trains were full. It was not a pleasant 4hour+ drive with below-average roads, lots of traffic, and the ubiquitous tailgating of drivers in a hurry. Take the train or fly if you are going there.\n\nThe weather was absolutely perfect with sunny skies and a comfortable temperature. Samarkand feels more like a desert than Tashkent. The forecast predicted rain, but blue skies were all around. The course was hilly but went by many of the ancient archeological sites and the start and finish were close to the famous Registan.\n\nI am catching up on the blog this week. For our Fall Break after spending a day in Almaty, Kazakhstan, we flew Air Astana to Dubai, one of the United Arab Emirates. We spent 4 nights and 5 days in the UAE and really enjoyed the desert sunshine and the remarkable transformation of a pearl diving village on the Persian Gulf to an ever-expanding metropolis.\n\nDubai is a fascinating place and one of the world‚Äôs global cities. It reminded me of Singapore or Hong Kong. Author Justin Marozzi sums up the city well in his excellent book, ‚ÄúIslamic Empires: 15 Cities that Define a Civilization‚Äù when he quotes a professor from a university in Dubai, ‚ÄúFind me a Syrian, Iraqi, Lebanese, Tunisian, Algerian, Moroccan, Sudanese or an Egyptian who doesn‚Äôt want to live in Dubai,‚Ä¶They all do.‚Äù\n\nI have mixed emotions about the city. I love the openness and tolerance demonstrated by the Emiratis. It is a model for the Islamic world. The city welcomes foreigners, and over 200 nationalities reside in the city. It has lifted the standard of living for many. Cities in the Middle East can learn lessons from Dubai Inc. The downside of Dubai is how large it has become. We fought traffic to drive across the city to the Dubai Mall and the scale can be overwhelming. The sheer scale of capitalism ‚Äì hotels, apartments, restaurants, stores, etc. is dehumanizing. I was much more relaxed when we left the city for the Hajar Mountains in the Dubai exclave of Hatta.\n\nAnother negative aspect is the vast infrastructure of Dubai is built by low-wage expatriates from Asia (India / Pakistan/ Nepal/ Bangladesh/ Philippines) working in tough conditions. The Emiratis only make up about 25% of the population of the country. Yes, these immigrants are there because it is better than where they are from and I would think remittances help their families back home, but watching the workers on these huge construction sites, showed they have a tough job in the hot. desert sun. Most of our interactions with ‚Äúlocals‚Äù were Indians and Nepalese.\n\nThe Maktoum Dynasty founded Dubai and Sheikh Rashid of the Maktoum Dynasty is the real force behind Dubai Inc. The emirate has had a smart strategy of making it easy to set up businesses in Dubai. They outcompeted other regional cities to dominate the Gulf Region. They did it by taking risks as well to build the infrastructure way ahead of the demand. This included taking out huge loans for dredging Dubai Creek, building two massive ports, an airport, an airline, etc. Time and again, Sheikh Rashid took bold risks that paid off. The growth is phenomenal and it is now a transportation hub for this part of the world.\n\nIt is amazing to think that he took a place with high humidity, extremely hot sun, and a barren desert full of sand and turned it into a place that 15.8 million tourists visited in 2018. When we were thinking of where to travel for the Fall Break, Dubai was one of the easiest choices. There is no visa required, lots of flights and places to stay, and it was the most hassle-free vacation choice to make.\n\nWe paid the requisite visit to the largest shopping mall in the region, the Dubai Mall. It is an absolutely massive palace to consumerism. After a long night of clothes shopping, we watched the famous Dubai Fountain Show, along with hundreds of others. The show itself was uninspiring, but looking at all of the tourists and the buildings, including the world‚Äôs highest building, the Burj Khalif, was interesting. We rented an Air B&B apartment near the JBR Beach. The views were cool from the 21st floor although the apartment was cheaply made, but comfortable. Hotels are very expensive in Dubai so the apartment was a reasonable $200 per night for a family of four.\n\nEach morning we walked to the beach and went swimming. I miss the ocean sometimes, living in a double landlocked country. The water was a perfect temperature and it was delightful to spend time with the kids and Nadia. The cityscape background reminded me of Miami or Chicago (summertime!). We met a Russian woman who works in Dubai. There were a lot of Russian tourists and it was funny to keep hearing Russian on our holiday.\n\nOn our last night in the city, we drove over to the Dubai Marina Mall. The marina is another of the massive development projects and I appreciated the 7kilometer+ running trail. They built a mosque between the towering apartment buildings and the juxtaposition looked different. We ate at Pier 7, a building attached to the Dubai Marina Mall with 7 floors of restaurants, each with different cuisine. We chose Lebanese on floor 4. The lighted backdrop was spectacular and the food good, so a nice way to end our time in the city."
