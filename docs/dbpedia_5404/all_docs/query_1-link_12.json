Babur Park in Tashkent is home to the Seattle Peace Park, a collection of small tiles designed by Tashkent and its sister city – Seattle. Seattle Peace Park is a heartwarming reminder of the Cold War from children’s perspectives. Along the main alley of Babur Park, ceramic tiles along the way display hopes of peace and a better future. These tiles were made in the 1980s by schoolchildren from Seattle, hence the unusual unofficial name of the park. The 10,000 tiles of the park are incredibly moving because of their simple, yet timeless message to favor peace and friendship over war and distrust. Babur Culture and Recreation Park in Tashkent is also home The Peace Bell is rung every year on International Day of Peace on September 21 as a call for non-violence and cease-fire as well as a commitment to the ideals of friendship and concord. As the park is located near the Tashkent University of Pedagogy, you will see lots of students in the park throughout the year. There is also good collection of amusement rides in the park to excite children. Seattle and Tashkent have – rather astonishingly – been twin cities since 1973, long before the relations of the superpowers began to thaw. The partnership between both cities began only five years after the Soviet intervention during the Prague Spring in 1968. It was the first city partnership between a US and a Soviet city and it has continued until today.

Samarkand is also known as the “crossroad of cultures”. The ancient city of Afrosiab, an important settlement in the 1st Millennium was one of the jewels of the Silk Road; surrounded by Sogdians in 700B.C under the Achaemenid Dynasty of Persia before Alexander the Great conquered it in 329B.C. The Greeks referred to Samarkand as Marakanda to the Greeks. The architecture and townscape of Samarkand, situated at the crossroads of ancient cultures, are masterpieces of Islamic cultural creativity. This historic town illustrates its art, architecture and the most important stages of Central Asia and its cultural and political history. Samarkand is at least 2750 years old as traced in the holy Zoroastiaon book ‘Avesta’. Aside from its architectural history, Samarkand is the place of birth for the first paper mill in the world by two Chinese prisoners from the battle of Tallas in 751. Soon after, it spread to the west. Samarkand was the capital of Uzbekistan for 6 years from 1925 before returning the title back to Tashkent in 1930. 92\n\nHISTORICAL SITES SAMARKANDRegistanRegistan or “Sandy place” in Persian, was once the heart of the ancient city of Samarkandduring the Temurid dynasty. Registan was a public square where people gathered to hearroyal proclamations, heralded by blasts on enormous copper pipes called dzharchis and alsoa place of public executions.It framed by 3 madrassahs, namely, Ulugbek Madrassah, built during the TemuridEmpire, Sher-Dor Madrassah(pg49), built during Yalangtush Bakhodur ruling and 10years later, the Tilya-Kori Madrassah(pg49) which was not only a residential college forstudents, but also played the role of Friday mosque.

However, only Ulugbek Madrassah (largest Madrassah in Samarkand) survived after so many centuries. This madrassah faced the Registan Square directly. The madrassah operated until the late 17th century, before it was transformed into grain storage for more than a century. Teaching functions were then resumed in the early 20th century. 93\n\n1.

Only the sons of wealthy families studied here, and they came from all over Central Asia. Training could last from ten to twenty years. The only subject students were required to take was the Koran, all the other subjects were optional and could be selected by the students according to their interests. The Madrassah was considered as radical in its uses of animal figures (the two figures in the corners are lions) which are usually prohibited in Islamic law. Tilya-Kori Madrassah Tilya-Kori (Gilded) Madrassah was built 10 years after Sher-Dor Madrassah. It was not only a place for training students but it also played the role of a grand mosque. The two-storied façade decorated with beautiful patterns, the dormitory building surrounding the vast courtyard and the abundantly gilded ornaments in the mosque’s main hall are among the stunning highlights of the madrassah which also were fundamental in naming the mosque, Til-Kori. 96\n\nHISTORICAL SITESShah-i-Zinda EnsembleThe Shah-i-Zinda, meaning“The Living King” is a world famous necropolis which includes mausoleumsand other ritual buildings of the 9th, 14th and 19th centuries.

According to legends, it was here, on the banks of the river Siab, thatTuranian king and hero Afrosiab, a character of the folk epic ‘Shahnama’, founded the town thatthen became the capital of Sogdiana. The Afrosiab site appeared as gloomy yellowish hills. Its panoramic view can be viewed from the citadel’s top.

Only in 1908, archaeologistVyatkin found the very first document where the observatory’s location was mentioned.Unfortunately, only underground parts of the sextant and basis of the building were saved.The Observatory of Ulugbek has been so famous because of the publishing of the “UlugbekZidj”, a book that consists of a theoretical description and drawings of about 1,000 celestialbodies. With amazing accuracy, the length of a star year by Ulugbek’s calculation is equal to365 days 6 hours 10 minutes 8 seconds whereas the actual length by modern data is 365days 6 hours 9 minutes 9.6 seconds. The deviation is only less than a minute despite nothaving any advanced optical instruments.Location: Tashkent Road, SamarkandContact: (+98866) 235 0345Coordinates:39° 40’ 30.02” N 67° 0’ 20.41” E 97\n\nSAMARKAND HISTORICAL SITES Ruhabad Mausoleum Sheikh Burkhan ad-Din Sagardji who was highly respected by contemporaries of Temur, his wife Bibi-Halifa and their ten children, was buried here. Burkhan ad-Din Sagardji had a righteous mode of life and was respected for his high moral qualities. He was married to a Chinese Princess and died in China. The body of the saint was brought to Samarkand and buried here with his children. It was Sagardji who personally asked to be buried in Samarkand which he called “the city of God”. Legend says that under the dome there is a box containing seven hairs of the Prophet Mohammed. The laconic domed Ruhabad Mausoleum (The Abode of Spirit) is located near the Gur Emir Mausoleum. Location: Registan Street, Samarkand Coordinates: 39° 39’ 3.14” N 66° 58’ 5.69” E Bibi Khanum Mosque After his Indian campaign in 1399, Temur decided to undertake the construction of a gigantic mosque in his new capital, Samarkand. The Bibi Khanum mosque, dedicated to his wife Bibi, was built using precious stones captured during Amir Temur’s conquest in India. This immense edifice was once the largest structure ever built using unfired, un-reinforced mud brick. Bibi was buried in a tomb located in a madrassah complex just across the main road which leads from the old city of Afrosiab to the center of the Temurid city at the Registan. (The tomb is currently being restored) As Blair and Bloom suggest, “Temur’s mosque was designed not only to continue the Iranian imperial tradition, but also to symbolize his conquest of the world.” Fees: 1,200 som Location: Tashkent Street, Samarkand 98 Coordinates: 39° 39’ 38.84” N 66° 58’ 44.85” E"
