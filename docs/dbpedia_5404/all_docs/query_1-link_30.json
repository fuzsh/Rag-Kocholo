        "text": "The author of this subject index, Ernst A. Swietly, co-author with Fritz Langauer of the reference book \"Der handgeknüpfte Teppich,\" is grateful for improvements and suggestions, at swietly.press@aon.at.\n\nThis directory lists about 2. 000 common carpet-related terms, important places of production and trade, carpet patterns and materials, and current industry terminology, and explains their origins and meanings. It aims to intensify the relationship between carpet enthusiasts and collectors to their textile companions.\n\nIt is difficult, however, to translate technical words from Farsi, Turkish, Armenian, Chinese or Turkmen perfectly. In many cases, these foreign languages have different sounds, spellings, and pronunciations than German or English.\n\nFor understanding some striking examples: In Turkish, \"A\" and \"I\" have different speech variants: for example, a closed and an open \"A\" and \"I\". \"C\" and \"C'\" are letters pronounced as \"dj\" or \"tsch\". A diphthong such as\n\n\"gh\", for example, in Persian \"Ghom\" does not exist in German. In Farsi, \"gh\" is a guttural sound. In addition, in this language the \"E\" is often spoken, but not written. Therefore, in textbooks one finds different spellings for one and the same sound; the same is true for the transcription of Chinese, Indian or Tibetan names, places and terms. Furthermore, the spelling of many names and technical terms from the world of carpets is influenced by the phonetic language of English; because Englishmen were the former colonial masters and most important traders in most countries of origin of carpets, who helped to shape the tapitological technical language. Thus, for example, keywords beginning with \"Sh\" may be classified under \"Sch\" in the index or vice versa. In German, many English carpet terms have been adopted without hesitation in the past and are still used in English spelling by experts. To prevent the resulting confusion and misunderstanding, this directory adheres to the most common spelling or cites alternative, but meaning congruent spellings side by side.\n\n.\n\nIn case of any errors, the author hopes for the understanding of the readers; he will try to eliminate them in the next improved edition of this directory. He is, therefore, truly interested in error hints from readers. Keywords missing from this directory, as well as vivid illustrations of rug motifs, patterns, and geographic terms, can at best be found in the encyclopedia \"Oriental Rugs\" by Peter F. Stone, ISBN 978-0-8048- 4373-7, which the author recommends to readers and friends of rug science.\n\nAba= fine plaid woolen cloth used for making overalls for men.\n\nAbadeh= small southern Iranian town in the northern Afshari region on the road from Isfahan to Shiraz at 2000 meters above sea level in a desert mountainous area.

It originated in Kurdistan; it is seen there in old Sawjabalaq and Bijar rugs. It is also found in old carpets from Tabriz, Heris, Hamadan and Chehar Mahal.

He was a member of one of those carpet dynasties that produced Safavid-style knotted works with new floral designs and utmost delicacy, including for palaces of the Persian ruling dynasty of Pahlevi between the two world wars. Amoo-Oghli products are similar to the famous Ardebil carpets, although smaller in size than the latter, they have more borders and twice their knotting density. Amoo-Oghli's manufactures reached the peak in the twenties and thirties of the 20th century. Mohammed Amoo-Oghli died in 1938; his manufactories were taken over by his brother Ali Khan Amoo-\n\n.\n\nOghli continued; his son Ali gave up the business in the 1950s; see\n\n\"Maschad\"!\n\nAnhalt carpet= A very early Persian medallion carpet made in the Safavid period (1501-1722), probably towards the end of the first quarter of the 16th century.

These include Ersari, Tekke, Yomud, and Saryk.\n\nAs a result of the wars of recent decades, millions of Afghans have fled to Iran and especially Pakistan.

This pattern is used especially in Isfahan, Kashan, Kerman and Tabriz. There are ten different variants of this pattern.\n\n.\n\nAfsharsorAfshar= South Persian (nomadic) tribes of Turkic origin.

An Indian carpet manufactory existed here from the mid-16th to the early 18th century, attempting to transplant the Persian art of knotting to India. Today, different carpet qualities are produced in Agra. No original carpets have survived from the Mughal period. Experts believe that the typical pieces from the Mughal period showed a combination of Persian, Safavid and Timurid elements with a mixture of Near and Far Eastern models of motifs and patterns. Under British administration, carpet production in Agra was revived by foreign manufactures who exported only to the UK and USA. From Agra also come prison carpets; see these!\n\n.\n\nEgypt= is not a classic country of oriental knotted works.

Century the oriental knotting art as a profitable handicraft developed. In the west of the country, sheep's wool was abundant, and there were also strong cultural and artistic contacts with Muslims and nomads. Patterns and colors of old Chinese carpets were based on Caucasian models. The western world discovered Chinese carpets as a trade good on the occasion of the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, when troops of European powers plundered the royal palace in Beijing and brought back carpets to Europe as booty. Chinese carpets are a phenomenon because they are immediately recognizable as such even to laymen; nevertheless, they show a variety of different faces. In China, six carpet regions can be distinguished. One of them, Beijing carpets, are mostly finely knotted, have favorable formats, with midnight blue dominating within light-colored borders. China carpets are counted in\n\n.\n\nstrictly speaking, they do not belong to oriental carpets.

There is evidence of weaving in China since about 4000 years before Christ; fragments of a coarsely woven textile piece had been found in central China in Shaanxi province. It was not until the Ottomans conquered East Turkestan in the 12th century that carpet weaving became widely practiced in China. For Europe and America, Chinese carpets became respectable only at the beginning of the 20th century. While Persian carpets are knotted according to an ancient hidden mathematical calculation, Chinese carpet design tended to free arrangement of patterns and motifs. There is in China the division of the carpet area into fund and border, but both parts often merge into each other, and there is also a lack of symmetry.\n\n.\n\nChinese carpets often play with the contrast between blue and yellow; meanwhile, China also skillfully imitates Turkish and Persian knotted carpets as well as French aubussons and savonneries.

It was initiated in 1981 by the German Harald Böhmer, who taught the peasant population the then already forgotten dyeing with natural dyes.\n\n.\n\nBöhmer was the initiator of the revival of vegetable dyes. The carpet industry is indebted to him, because Böhmer was the initiator of the reuse of natural dyes; before him, they had been eliminated and forgotten in the carpet production of almost the entire Orient.

They are considered more of a craftsmanship feat than an attractive product. Old examples of this type were used as a kind of door or \"pardeh\" in mosques, mostly in Meshed.\n\n.\n\nVillage Carpets= Typical for them is that they often have smaller formats than manufactory carpets, are usually knotted without a pattern, the corners are rarely harmoniously resolved in terms of pattern, but rather improvised and multiple irregularities in the pattern structure or in the representation of individual ornaments can be seen. They are made by a sedentary rural population. Both vertical and horizontal knotting looms are used for their production. Vertical knotting implies more uniform knotting and larger sizes as a result than is the case with the horizontal knotting looms of nomads. Once they become sedentary, they gradually transition to vertical knotting looms. Village carpets therefore no longer show the originality of the products of nomads, but in most cases have retained their original folk art. In village carpets, the intuition of the weaver is valued above all; they are usually not knotted according to patterns. The patterns\n\nare passed down from generation to generation. Irregularities in pattern and measurement are not a disadvantage, although Europeans trimmed for precision often see it differently.\n\nSloping rugs are not inherently a disadvantage. Often it testifies to the simple way of life and the natural intention of the weavers. It is only important that a carpet lies flat and does not wrinkle. Usually this can be remedied by professional tensioning.\n\nDoroksh= Northeast Iranian carpet from the area around Khorasan, which is in fierce competition with the knotted works from Senneh; it is characterized by a very fine knotting, with the region-typical orange predominating as well as floral motifs at about 750. 000 knots per m2; often there are vase motifs and bulky botehs.\n\n.\n\nDoruschorDorosh= Carpet name of an area in the East Persian Qainat in the Birdshend region in the province of Korasan.

This motif is considered a symbol of good luck.\n\n.\n\nDragon Cloud icon= S-shaped bands between the motifs of a carpet symbolize dragons, which are considered to be an auspicious miraculous and symbolic animal in the Orient.\n\nDragon Carpets= Particularly in Caucasian knotted works, animals and animal combat representations are brought in after the Persian model, which become so unrecognizable through stylization and distortion that they are called dragons. Of the early Caucasian dragon carpets, about 100 have survived to the present day. Dragon carpets are divided into four chronologically distinct groups, beginning in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Century to about 1850. Dragon carpets include Chinese Ningxia palace carpets made of silk with gold metal brocading, such as those made in the Qing Dynasty in the\n\n19th century.

It was there that Fatollah Habibian created the new type of Nain carpet in the early thirties of the twentieth century, which was a success from the very beginning. It is easily recognizable by its mostly pale purple color scheme. From it the today's Nain- carpets developed, see these!\n\n.\n\nDumbaschaf= Fat-tailed sheep (Ovis platura), a breed of domestic sheep that is about 6000 years old and bred throughout the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\npatterned=means that the entire surface of a rug is filled with motifs, leaving no empty spaces; these are richly patterned pieces.\n\nEchmiadzin= ancient city in southwestern Armenia, seat of the Armenian Catholicos, a religious complex with houses of worship and a museum with religious art treasures, carpets and paraments.
