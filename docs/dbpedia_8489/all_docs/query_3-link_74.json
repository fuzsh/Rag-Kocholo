        "text": "I’m beginning to know myself, I don’t exist.” The bookk of disquiet\n\nThis is a takeaway from the YouTube video : These 70 writers are actually all the same person — by Ilan Stavans\n\nFernando Pessoa was an enigmatic writer who used “heteronyms” to write the works of other people he had invented, thus experimenting with different literary voices. He created dozens of fictional authors with distinct lives and unique writing styles. His best-known work is “The Book of Intranquillity”, which is presented as the autobiography of someone who never existed.\n\nBorn in Lisbon in 1888, Pessoa began writing in the guise of different people from the age of around six; he wrote letters in the guise of an imaginary Frechman, the Chevalier de Pas\n\nThe many writers whose works were in the same trunk actually belonged to Pessoa himself.\n\n- Pessoa’s heteronyms sometimes interacted with each other and even criticised each other’s work.\n\n-he described himself as a “nomad wandering through (his own) consciousness”, “a kind of medium”, “deviated” among his heteronyms.\n\nBut he wrote “ I’m less real than the others, less substantial, less personal, and easily influenced by them all . “\n\nHe gained a reputation for his formal dress, his affinity for the occult and his warmth and charm, all the while keeping people at a distance.\n\nHe used several heteronyms to write poems and stories, each with its own personality and writing style.\n\nLove letters, detective stories and astrological chart analysis.\n\n- The three heteronyms most used by Pessoa were Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis and Álvaro de Campos.\n\n- These heteronyms represented different aspects of Pessoa’s personality and allowed him to express emotions that he could not express as himself.\n\nFrom a among almost 30.000 pages of unpublishing work stashed in his trunk, critics eventually assembled “ The book of Disquiet” in 1982 which pessoa spent two decades developing\n\n“The autobiography of someone who never existed Literature helps him escape the confines of reality “My soul is a hidden orchestra,” reads the first entry “I don’t know what instruments, what violins and harps, what drums and tambours sound and clash inside me. I only know myself as a symphony.\n\nTakeaways from N.Soumaya"
