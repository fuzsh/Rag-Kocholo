        "text": "In the old quarter of Lisbon, at 120 Rua Garrett, outside one of the oldest cafes, Café A Brasileira, sits aloft the statue of Fernando Pessoa at his usual table, a flâneur, poet, writer, literary critic, translator, publisher, and the exponent of the eternal disquietude plaguing an artist’s life.\n\nIf one desires to read or study his life and works, one has to dig through 70 odd pseudonyms or heteronyms that he credited to his thousands of unfinished and unpublished manuscripts. Alberto Caerio, one of his most popular alter egos, makes poetry out of the absence of sentiment. Imagine sitting at the Ribeira das Naus Avenue looking at the Tagus River and not feeling a sense of vastness reflected from the rigorous water, but rather being struck by the pristine sunshine falling on the surface of the still stream. For Caerio, things simply exist and we have no right to credit them with more than that. A poet who does not wonder, or question, avoids doubts and uncertainties, and is essentially anti-Romantic, anti-Metaphysical. He stands in direct contrast to his creator, Fernando Pessoa, which certainly represents his artistic endeavor of pursuing or creating a work of art incongruous to his own philosophy.\n\nHaving a poetic vision that weaves all different ideas, theories, archetypes, voices, and beliefs and conceptualizing it through imaginary characters was Pessoa’s primary purpose apart from devouring English literature through extensive reading and working as a freelance correspondence translator in almost twenty-one firms in a span of 28 years.\n\nTo be great, be whole: nothing that’s you\n\nShould you exaggerate or exclude.\n\nIn each thing, be all. Give all you are\n\nIn the least you ever do.\n\nThe whole moon, because it rides so high,\n\nIs reflected in each pool.\n\nOne of the odes, penned under the name, Ricardo Reis is Pessoa’s most austere poet heavily influenced by Horace and has a detached, intellectual approach toward the objective world. Borrowing from the Epicurean philosophy, Reis has a firm belief in fate and disregards freedom or longing which causes discontentment, and only seeks tranquility and calm above all else. Here, we see a striking change in the form, rhythm, and language of the poems credited to the rational poet whose sole aim is to avoid pain and suffering and appreciate the fleetingness of life. “As long as I feel the fresh breeze in my hair, and see the sun shining strong on the leaves, I will not ask for more.”\n\nIn almost all of the poems of Pessoa, irrespective of their pen names, there is a poignant urgency to capture the instincts of the soul and a resolute melancholy towards the nature of life. He insists on making identity and the ideas of our existence as flexible as possible, which can be easily broken down or molded, or developed in every phase of life. What makes Pessoa stand out from other modernists or rather what is the mystery behind his dynamic personality? Individualism can be regarded as the most important feature of Modernistic life; putting the beliefs, needs, well-being, and accomplishments of a single person over those of other individuals and of society. The spirit of the individual which lays emphasis on self-creation, experimentation, and self-preservation, is evoked from most of modern texts. However, for Pessoa, a distinctive individual identity was absolutely unnecessary, “I’m the gap between what I’d like to be and what others have made of me… That’s me”, he writes in one of his poems. His strong fascination with loneliness and his fatalistic disposition situate him in the nineteenth-century era of Idealism, aestheticism, perspectivism, and nihilism. Using nullity as a muse, Pessoa drew from the past centuries’ literature and wrote a collection of poems fused with patriotic explorations and Portuguese history, Message, which appeared in 1934, the only book of verse published in his own language in his lifetime.\n\nHis magnum opus, The Book of Disquiet, a haphazard collection of journal entries, musings, aphorisms, and confessions, is a masterpiece by successive scholars, and editors who attempted to put all the entries in chronological order and got translated into English by Margaret Jull Costa in 2013. The enigmatic influence of this book made me read everything about Pessoa’s life, works, and Portuguese literature altogether and one of his life’s most intriguing aspects is his love of emptiness, which might sound morbid to a particular audience but through this void, he imagines a stage where his characters interplay and explore each other’s ideologies to create art in its truest form.\n\nThe most lyrical and sensual of his heteronyms is Alvaro de Campos who manifests as an exaggerated version of Pessoa himself. Inspired by Walt Whitman, a futurist basking in energy and fuelling his love of the universe through verse, his poems are marked with pure vigor, innocent excitement, and also the same hints of melancholia concluding his line of thought – “I, who could only be satisfied by trampling the universe underfoot, trampling, trampling, trampling until feeling nothing… I feel that all of what I wanted eluded what I imagined, that although I wanted everything, everything lacked.” Unlike Caeiro, who asks nothing of life, he asks too much, indefinitely to be disappointed yet shining a glimmer of optimism in a psyche that only cherishes unhappiness.\n\nA sudden divergence occurred from his artistic endeavor towards occult studies and astrology while embracing the philosophy of transcendentalism and adhering to his pantheistic beliefs. Pessoa, while living with his aunt from 1912-14, took part in “semi-spiritualist sessions”, and later on translated theosophist books, evoking his curiosity and further immersing himself into mediumship and automatic writing. In a way, these mystical experiences had a profound influence on his writings and made possible the idea of heteronyms and various personas inhabiting a bizarre mind.\n\nThis voluntary solipsistic life jostled by painful disappointments, existential nausea, and the paranoia of utter meaninglessness in action aids his stubborn resignation to the realm of dreams. The deliberate abandoning of real life and mastering the fictional life was his chief solace. Pessoa belongs to the transitional era, where the surge of decadence enveloped itself to merge in the ocean of modernistic ideals. The impact of decadent writers like Wilde, Baudelaire is so visible or rather imprinted on his principles that he refused to “try hard” and live in earnestness and throughout his lifetime focussed on the philosophical pursuit of nothingness, embracing ordinariness and simplicity. One can argue that greatness does not necessarily mean recognition as long as happiness does not equate with the fulfillment of experiences. For Pessoa, a life not lived at all provided the best source to understand and acknowledge the human condition. Being undeceived in the face of both tragedies and fortune, not considering political and social standards of his day, loveless and single in an atmosphere of blissful beauty, all these fabricating a distinguishing identity “remaining humanly unknown” and everything around him “evaporating” so long he can enjoy the observant life.\n\n“To know nothing about yourself is to live. To know yourself badly is to think.” Much of Pessoa’s life was spent in both reading and writing vociferously, devoted to his own self and never seeking outside validation. It is precisely these lives that are somewhat misconstrued or on rare occasions romanticized, however, Pessoa is able to stir the deep inner layers of our hearts and store in the recesses of our minds, his symphony, and his unyielding poetic spirit.\n\n“I consider life an inn where I have to stop over until the coach from the abyss arrives. I don’t know where it will take me because I don’t know anything. I could consider this inn a prison because I’m force to stay inside it; I could consider it a place for socializing because I meet others here…I slowly sing, only to myself, songs that I compose as I wait.”"
