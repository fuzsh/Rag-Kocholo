He is considered one of the most important figures of 20th-century Portuguese literature and is known for his poetry, short stories, and novels.\n\nTorga grew up in a poor family and had to work as a shepherd during his childhood. He later attended high school in Braga and went on to study medicine at the University of Coimbra, where he became involved in literary circles and began to publish his first works.\n\nTorga’s writing is known for its raw, intense, and often starkly realistic portrayal of rural life in Portugal. Many of his stories are set in the region of Trás-os-Montes, where he grew up, and focus on the struggles of ordinary people trying to make a living in a harsh and unforgiving environment.\n\nSome of Torga’s most famous works include the collections of short stories “Bichos” (1940) and “Contos da Montanha” (1941), as well as the novel “Os Irmãos” (1938).

Queirós is known for his realist style of writing and his satirical social commentary, which often criticized the upper classes of Portuguese society.\n\nQueirós studied law at the University of Coimbra before embarking on a career in civil service. However, he soon abandoned this career to become a journalist and writer. His first novel, “The Crime of Father Amaro,” was published in 1875 and caused a scandal due to its frank portrayal of the Catholic Church and its clergy.\n\nQueirós went on to write a number of other novels, many of which are set in the rural regions of Portugal. His most famous work, “The Maias,” is considered a classic of Portuguese literature and is set in the city of Lisbon. The novel explores themes of decadence, corruption, and moral decay in the upper classes of Portuguese society.\n\nQueirós was a keen observer of Portuguese society and culture, and his writing often reflected his views on politics, religion, and the changing social landscape of his time. His works are known for their vivid descriptions of people and places, and for their use of irony and satire to comment on the issues of the day.\n\nToday, Queirós is widely regarded as one of the most important writers in Portuguese literature, and his works continue to be studied and celebrated in Portugal and beyond. His former home in Porto, the Palácio de Cristal, has been converted into a museum dedicated to his life and work.\n\nMore about Almeida Garrett…\n\nJoão Baptista da Silva Leitão de Almeida Garrett, better known as Almeida Garrett, was a Portuguese writer and politician born on February 4, 1799, in Porto, Portugal, and died on December 9, 1854, in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nGarrett’s works are considered essential to the Romantic Movement in Portugal, as he was one of the leading figures of the literary revolution that occurred in the country in the early 19th century. He was also a key figure in the Portuguese Liberal Revolution of 1820, which sought to overthrow the absolutist monarchy and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal.\n\nGarrett’s literary career began with the publication of his poem “Camões,” which celebrated the work of the great Portuguese poet Luís de Camões. He went on to write a number of other poems, including “Morceaux de poésie,” “Adozinda,” and “João José, ou o dom de adivinhar.”\n\nIn addition to his poetry, Garrett wrote several plays, including “Frei Luís de Sousa,” which is considered one of the greatest works of Portuguese literature. The play tells the story of a nobleman who is wrongly accused of treason and sentenced to death, but who is eventually exonerated through the intervention of his wife.\n\nGarrett was also a novelist, and his most famous novel is “Viagens na minha terra,” which is a combination of travelogue and fictional narrative. The book describes a journey through Portugal by the narrator, who encounters various characters and experiences various adventures along the way.\n\nGarrett was also involved in politics, and he served as the Minister of the Interior in the Portuguese government in the 1830s.
