        "text": "In the process of attaining international recognition, Portuguese and Brazilian literatures continue to rely on the critical interest that writers such as Luís Vaz de Camões, Machado de Assis, Mario de Andrade and Fernando Pessoa elicit from both an international and academic readership. As a consequence of António de Oliveira Salazar’s dictatorship in Portugal between 1932 and 1968 and the military regime in Brazil between 1964 and 1985, the two countries experienced not only a period of political, economic and social oppression, but also a period of intellectual control that confined the Lusophone culture to its national borders. In contrast to the great Portuguese expansion of the sixteenth century represented by its daring ships, Lusophone literature of the twentieth century did not sail international seas. Despite the aggressive restrictions of the regimes, many artists, writers and intellectuals remained undiscouraged and produced relevant artistic works. With the collapse of the Portuguese dictatorship in 1974 and the Brazilian military’s relinquishment of power to civilian president Tancredo Neves in 1985, the cultural exchange between Portugal, Brazil and the former African colonies enriched the Lusophone cultural environment, giving birth to a veritable cultural renaissance. Authors such as Jorge Amado and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature José Saramago awakened a new interest in Lusophone literature. Nevertheless, numerous respected contemporary Portuguese and Brazilian literary figures remain relatively unknown to the international public and scholars of non-Lusophone academic specialties. In addition to new critical considerations of the fascinating works of Fernando Pessoa and Lygia Fagundes Telles, this section of Hispanófila contributes to the expansion of international appreciation for two extraordinary contemporary Portuguese writers, Miguel Torga and Helena Marques, who have received little attention from critics beyond Portugal. [End Page 77]\n\nIn the first article, “La odisea espiritual de Álvaro de Campos: Cábala y alquimia en Oda Marítima,” Marta del Pozo Ortea stresses the profound influence of esotericism, specifically alchemy and the Kabbalah on Fernando Pessoa’s poetry. Celebrated as one of the most significant Portuguese poets, Pessoa was a prolific writer and occupies a unique place in the poetic canon of the twentieth century. A fascinating and eccentric intellectual, he had a major role in the development of Modernism along with writers such as Joyce, Pirandello and Kafka. Pessoa gave birth to fully-developed writing personalities apart from his own. He called these pen-names “heteronyms,” because they were not mere pseudonyms but had their own biographies, personal philosophies, interests and poetical styles. One of Pessoa’s heteronyms is Álvaro de Campos. In numerous letters sent to his friend, the poet Mario de Sà-Carneiro, Pessoa attributed his impetuous act of creative writing to external powers that revealed themselves to him during séances. Pessoa’s writings were strongly influenced by clairvoyance, but his interest in esoteric practices was not limited to occultism, and included theosophy, astrology, hermeticism, alchemy and the Kabbalah.\n\nContinuing the exploration of the influence of the occult on Pessoa’s poetic production initiated by intellectuals such as Yvette K. Centeno, Marta del Pozo Ortea refers to the Jewish esoteric discipline in her analysis of Álvaro de Campos’ most innovative work, Ode Marítima (1915). Beyond the traditional reading of this turbulent poetic creation as an imaginary maritime journey through a plurality of sensations, del Pozo Ortea examines the epic work of this heteronym, – the writing personality who, perhaps, best reflected the psychic energies of Pessoa –, in the light of the ten Sephiroth representing the Jewish Kabbalah’s “Path of the Arrow.” According to the characteristics of each Sephirah, the scholar divides the poem in three parts: the first refers to the initial 211 verses, which are characterized by a contemplative tone and can be connected to the first Sephirah of the “Tree of Life,” named Kether; the second part, from verse 211 to 764, corresponds to the second through the ninth Sephiroth, evoking the category of dream and reflecting the continuous search for a balance between two opposing forces; finally, the third part of the poem, from verse 765 to the end, is related to the Sephirah known as..."
