        "text": "Leave it to the Portuguese to hold claim to the only poet famed for his multiple personalities. Fernando Pessoa, Portugal's late national poet, was the Fernando with many faces. In his day (he died in 1935) he was not only a well known poet, but after his death and in going through his papers, the world of literature found out that at least seven other poets and critics from Portuguese-speaking countries were actually him.\n\nWhen Pessoa died, he left behind a steamer trunk in his attic full of 27,543 manuscripts, written by 86 “different” poets, male, female, young, old. The volumes of his notebooks were poetry, critiques, and even written-out psychological profiles of each of what he called his \"heteronyms.\"\n\nHis earliest heteronym (created at the age of 6) was Chevalier de Pas. Later childhood heteronyms were Dr. Pancrácio and David Merrick, followed by Charles Robert Anon and Alexander Search. In his adulthood, he further created the notable poets Alberto Caeiro, Álvaro de Campos and Ricardo Reis (whom Portuguese Nobel Laureate in literature Jose Saramago has used as main characters in his novels, such as The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis), not to mention Bernardo Soares. He also published under his own name, where his infamous poem, gave his multiple-personality secret away a bit:\n\nA little more insight into his heteronyms is seen in his quote, \"Every man that exists is Me. I have all society inside me. I am my best friends and my truest .... Thus we live to the full. And living to the full is to be happy.\"\n\nPessoa has been translated into English over the years by Harold Bloom and Richard Zenith, not to mention Elizabeth Bishop (who befriended and published many Brazilian poets in English in her day). But in reading him, one sees between the lines a man conflicted more than happy. Each of his created poets had different writing styles: Reis more pastoral, Alberto de Campos more of a Portuguese free-verse beatnik decades before the Beat Generation in America came into being. His personalities wrote and published critiques of each other’s work, oftentimes brutally tearing apart each other.\n\nThe love of Pessoa's life was a woman named Ophelia (go figure). She actually hated de Campos and encouraged Pessoa to break off all ties with him. Pessoa asked Ophelia why she disliked de Campos so, adding, \"I hear he's very fond of you.\"\n\nFurther complicating Pessoa's life was his Jewish lineage, on his mother's side, that he never admitted to and often denied, for the sake of not being discriminated against. In the days of city-states, prior to nation-states, Portugal and Spain was known as Iberia (as together they form the Iberian peninsula) and primarily occupied by Jews and Gypsies. The Holy Roman Empire invaded and forced Catholicism on everyone at the point of the sword, so many Jews in Portugal (and Portuguese who migrated elsewhere to avoid persecution) converted, becoming known as Conversos, or Christos Neuvos (Portuguese for “New Christians”). As time passed a King changed his mind, had the Pope declare Jews were jewish by blood not conversion, then killed them all to marry the Princess of Spain in hopes of unifying the Iberian crown. The King of Spain only agreed to allow his daughter to marry the King of Portugal if the Jews were first all killed, so they were. The crown never got unified, as the young Portuguese King died before the old Spanish King, his father-in-law. Poetic justice.\n\nSo Jews have a long history of oppression and slaughter. Pessoa wasn't about to put himself into a line of prejudicial fire. So he invented poets, writing under their names and his. His first book in English was published just after World War I, in 1918. Under his own name we get the real Pessoa, not a mask, but his truest feelings.\n\nAlberto de Campos comes close to the real Pessoa, as de Campos insisted on feeling fully and deeply as possible about pretty much everything. His personae was a free-verse gay poet addicted to drugs, unlike Ricardo Reis or Pessoa himself writing in verse. Alberto de Campos was sort of the Allen Ginsberg of his day in Lisbon, even before Ginsberg was born. Ginsberg has even written a poem to Pessoa, titled Salutations to Pessoa. Themes by the various heteronyms aren't even close, but this poet found a way to express himself through others, claiming he was not a poet but that \"several poets live inside of me.\" Indeed. Here's a de Campos poem:\n\nI've never been right unless sprawled out in the universe.\n\nOne can see the different tone between Pessoa and de Campos. Again, Saramago the Portuguese Nobel novelist (whose prose is poetry driven), has spoken of his love for the poetry of Ricardo Reis as a young boy as his early inspiration to write. So the argument can be made that multiple personalities spawn multiple influences, even prompt one to become a Nobel prize winner. So in that sense his heteronyms were very real people indeed. Here's a sampling of Reis poetry:\n\nThat on the day they are born,\n\nThat very day, must also die.\n\nAnd die before Apollo's course\n\nAcross the visible sky is run.\n\nTo know of nights before or after\n\nThe little while that we may last.\n\nShould you exaggerate or exclude.\n\nIn the least you ever do.\n\nIs reflected in each pool.\n\nOf course, one could spend a lifetime researching and writing about Fernando Pessoa and all his make-believe (?) friends. But this column is allotted only so much space. Many have encouraged me, as a Portuguese-American (first generation) to pursue Pessoa, as no one Portuguese has become a scholar on him. Sure, Bloom and Zenith have done great in translating and studying his work, but they are not Portuguese. So this month's Meter Man column is a mere tasting of the work this poet is up to these days."
