        "text": "“I’ve divided all my humaness among the various authors whom I’ve served as literary executor…I subsist as a kind of medium of myself, but I’m less real than the others. Less substantial, less personal, and easily influenced by them all.”\n\nI was introduced to Fernando Pessoa in the excellent novel The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis by Jose Saramago. Possibly the greatest Portuguese poet of the 20th Century, there is so much to be said about Pessoa, whose name means “Person” in Portuguese, and this seems to have affected the poet throughout his life.\n\n“Fernando Pessoa, strictly speaking, doesn’t exist” Alvaro de Campos\n\nAlvaro de Campos was one of the “heteronyms” (alter egos with startingly different styles, points of view, and biographies) that Pessoa created and wrote under. These included, other than Campos:\n\nAlberto Caeiro\n\nRicardo Reis\n\nAlexander Search – who wrote in English\n\nCharles Robert Anon – who wrote in English\n\nJean Seul – who wrote in French\n\nPessoa wrote poems, articles, essays under all these names, including references to the other heternoyms, such as the quote from Alvaro de Campos above.\n\nRichard Zenith puts together a rich introduction to Pessoa, his life and his poetry. So you are itching to get to the poems themselves, and when they arrive, they do not disappoint. Split between his main Heteronyms and their works, the whole volume is an odyssey whose reward is the sheer delight in reading the pure, simple and evocative poems that Pessoa wrote. I wanted to include some parts of some of the poems, but as I would quite happily reproduce the whole book (and I’m pretty sure there are laws against that) I have simply highlighted my favourites, although a great number of them don’t have names.\n\nAlberto Caiero, The Master, as he is referred to, is by far my favourite of the heteronyms. His poems come straight from nature, and paint the picture of a serene uncomplicated existence. The following excerpts are from The Keeper of Sheep\n\nIV\n\n…As if I’d lived my wh0le life\n\nPeacefully, like the garden wall\n\nHaving ideas and feeling, the same way\n\nA flower has scent and colour\n\nXLVIII\n\n…Almost happy like a man tired of being sad.\n\nXLIX is a simply beautiful poem.\n\nIn his collection the Shepherd in Love, the poems become more scattered, like a storm of thoughts has interrupted his serene contemplation of nature. The 2nd and 3rd poems of his uncollected works also deserve a special mention.\n\nRicardo Reis is the classicist, the lover of the Greeks whose poetry is slightly more formal, but no less enjoyable than the natural Caiero.\n\n“…Let us also make our lives one day,\n\nConsciously forgetting there’s night, Lydia,\n\nBefore and after\n\nThe little we endure”\n\n“…Sunflowers forever\n\nBeholding the Sun,\n\nWe will serenely\n\nDepart from life,\n\nWithout even the regret\n\nof having lived.”\n\n“…Learn what your body\n\nYour boundary, teachers you”\n\nAlvaro de Campos was originally going to compose five futuristic odes, and although three are in the book they have been partially cobbled together from the many verses de Campos wrote. The Maritime ode particularly is a rambling, powerful ode, utterly compelling from start to finish, dedicated to the sea and it’s hold on those who travel on her.\n\n“…Brushing against the ropes, descending the cramped stairways,\n\nSmelling this greasy metallic and maritime mixture of all this-\n\nShips seen from up close are something else and are the same,\n\nStirring the same nostalgia and the same yearning in another way”\n\nHis section also contains excerpts from two odes, the first one of which is some three pages of smooth prose dedicated to the night and the moon.\n\nPessoa himself is no less gifted than his creations, and everything from girls singing to shutting himself up in his house at night, everyday activities are described simply, purely and the whole volume is an absolute pleasure to read from start to finish. A poem dated the 5th of April 1931 seems to particularly describe Pessoa\n\n“…If people get tired\n\nOf being in the same place,\n\nWhy shouldn’t they tire\n\nOf having the same self?”\n\nI bought this to read while in Portugal for two weeks, along with The Elephants Journey by Jose Saramago (review to follow) and I ended up visiting the house where Pessoa spent 15 years of his life, now dedicated to him. I’ll finish with some lines from Ricardo Reis, that I wrote on the first page of my notebook:\n\n“Happy those who, placing their delight\n\nIn slight things, are never deprived\n\nof each day’s natural fortune!”"
