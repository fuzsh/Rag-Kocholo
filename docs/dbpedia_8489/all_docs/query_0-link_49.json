        "text": "This pioneering volume explores the extraordinary Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa (1888–1935) and his relationship to philosophy. On the one hand, this book reveals Pessoa’s serious knowledge of philosophy and playful philosophical explorations and how he has the gift of synthesizing, appropriating, and subverting complex ideas into his art; and, on the other hand, the chapters shed new light on central aspects and problems of philosophy through the prism of Pessoa’s diverse writings. The volume includes sixteen new essays from an international group of scholars, analyzing Pessoa’s multifaceted poetic work alongside philosophical themes and movements, from conceptions of time, ancient and modern aesthetics, philosophy of language, transcendentalism, immanence, and nihilism; to Islamic philosophy, Indian philosophy, Daoism, neo-paganism, and the philosophy of the self. The breadth of his work provides a springboard for new thinking on the aesthetic and the spiritual, the logic of value and capitalist modernity, and ecological thought and postmodernism. The volume also includes the most complete English translation of Pessoa's text (written by his heteronym Álvaro de Campos) called \"Notes for the Memory of my Master Caeiro.\"\n\nLacerda, Inês Forjaz de, \"“By links of being past imagining”: Fernando Pessoa’s The Mad Fiddler and Sensationism\" (2023).

This article examines the aesthetic reach of Pessoa’s threefold process to understand how the poet’s early work in English conceptualizes the abstract feelings and expressions that would eventually allow his heteronyms “to feel everything in all possible ways.” Analyzing the collection through each of these parameters reveals the breadth of Pessoa’s aspirations for sensationism as a literary movement. Grounded in new traditions within French symbolism and conceptualized in the English language, both The Mad Fiddler and Sensationism depart from the perceived insularity of Portuguese expression to affirm a more expansive artistic philosophy. RESUMO Fernando Pessoa escreve The Mad Fiddler de acordo com os três princípios do sensacionismo que ele mesmo delineia numa carta a um desconhecido editor britânico: Sensação, Sugestão e Construção. Este artigo examina o alcance estético deste pouco conhecido projeto de Fernando Pessoa com o objetivo de compreender como os primeiros trabalhos do poeta, escritos em inglês, contribuem para o desenvolvimento das sensações e expressões que eventualmente permitem aos seus heterónimos “sentir tudo de todas as formas”. Tratar-se-á, portanto, de se analisar a coleção através de cada um dos três princípios do sensacionismo, revelando a amplitude das aspirações do poeta para com o sensacionismo como movimento literário. Com base nas novas tradições do simbolismo francês e conceitualizado inteiramente através da língua inglesa, tanto The Mad Fiddler como o sensacionismo partem para além da expressão portuguesa, afirmando uma filosofia artística mais ampla.

Y.: Liveright Publishing.\n\nFernando Pessoa has several fictional characters who are claimed to be the authors of various collections of poetry gathered under his name. In the criticism, these are often seen as figures substituted for himself, while the poems which are not attributed to any of these fictional characters are treated as his own direct speech actions without subterfuge. This is in line with the conventions that have been dominant in discussions of literature, either to start from the author or from what Edward Said calls the ‘social and economic outside facts’. With attention turned elsewhere, the literary work itself tends to figure as an instrument in the hands of the author for use in pursuing some purpose. In this paper, we are going to bring back the works into focus. Discourse analysis is helpful in doing this. It is also applied in this paper to help sharpen focus on the characters of discourse, their identities as discourse agents and the objects which exercise them, in order to achieve interpretation of the poems as discourse events.\n\nPessoa Plural - A Journal of Fernando Pessoa studies Issue 14, Fall 2018 [Doi: 10.26300/4pac-gd45] [https://doi.org/10.7301/Z0HH6HMF] In 2016, the Centre for Theatre Studies (CET) of the Faculty of Letters at the University of Lisbon, in partnership with the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at the Universidad de los Andes and the Casa Fernando Pessoa, launched an online editorial project of Pessoa’s Fausto, funded by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and available at www.faustodigital.com. A colloquium organized by CET on June 21st, 2018—The Theatre of Fernando Pessoa: prose, verse, and hypertext—sparked a new discussion about the relationship between Fernando Pessoa and theatre. The special dossier included in this issue of Pessoa Plural is comprised of the papers presented at the colloquium that analyze the dialogue between Pessoa’s drama and different literary universes, such as French Symbolism and Russian Modernism, acknowledging other authors who influenced Pessoa’s creative process, such as Goethe, Marlowe, and Shakespeare.

Pessoa acknowledged the occultist influence in the literature of his time, and in his own, and made an effort to explain his particular path, which followed, as he insisted, the mystic and not the symbolist tradition – poetry of thought and not poetry of imagination. Palavras-­‐‑ chave Misticismo, esoterismo, modernismo, poesia, Fernando Pessoa. Resumo Existem vários documentos, no legado de Fernando Pessoa, que podem ajudar a compreender o lugar que os conteúdos de índole mística e esotérica ocupam na poesia pessoana. Pessoa recebeu a influência ocultista na literatura do seu tempo, e na sua própria obra, e esforçou-­‐‑ se por explicar o seu caminho particular direccionado para a tradição mística, mas não para a simbolista, como o próprio autor reiterou – poesia do pensamento em vez de poesia da imaginação.\n\nRevista do CESP, Belo Horizonte, v. 40, n. 64, p. 15-35, 2020 Revista do Centro de Estudos Portugueses ISSN 1676-515X (impressa) / ISSN 2359-0076 (eletrônica) The Stars Are as Variable as the Lines: Fernando Pessoa’s Works Considered from the Perspective of Editorial Agency As estrelas são tão variáveis quanto as linhas: As Obras de Fernando Pessoa consideradas da perspectiva da mediação editorial Jerónimo Pizarro Universidade de los Andes, Bogotá / Colômbia j.pizarro188@uniandes.edu.co http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9688-9830 Here we discuss editorial agency and its impact in the work of Fernando Pessoa, focusing on perception, mobility and interpretation. A posthumous publication is a privileged object to investigate the complexity of the process of editorial agency and its effects because, in the posthumous extension of a corpus, what is at stake is precisely its construction. We also examine the role of the editor and his intervention, rather than the one of publishers, bearing into account the impact the decisions and reorganizations can have when speaking of posthumous works. We conclude that a \"work\" is the product, or the result, of the joint work left by an author and that of its editors, and that a work or a set of works is not something determined and established forever, but a reassembled product, or the result of a construction or reconstruction. Resumo: Discutimos aqui a mediação editorial e o seu impacto na obra de Fernando Pessoa, com enfoque na perceção, na mobilidade e na interpretação. Uma publicação póstuma é um objeto privilegiado para investigar a complexidade do processo de mediação editorial e os seus efeitos porque, na extensão póstuma de um corpus, o que está em jogo é precisamente a sua construção. Analisamos também o papel do editor (editor) e da sua intervenção, em vez do papel da editora (publisher), tendo em consideração o impacto que as decisões e as reorganizações podem ter quando falamos de obras póstumas. Concluímos que uma “obra” é o produto, ou o resultado, do trabalho, em conjunto, do autor e da obra que deixou, e dos editores; e que uma obra ou um conjunto de obras não é algo determinado ou estabelecido para sempre, mas um produto reorganizado, ou o resultado de uma construção ou reconstrução. http://www.periodicos.letras.ufmg.br/index.php/cesp/article/view/17359\n\nThis exhibition seeks to advance towards a space of continuity. The authors presented are emblematic, are historical, and they contemplate some of the dimensions of plasticity inscribed into the perspective of Looks and Writings. They do not, however, represent an exhaustive survey of all the important names that stand out in the historiography of Portuguese art, which is why there is a pressing need for future events to complement this first showing. The history of Portuguese art in the 20th century may also be constructed by focusing upon the inter-relationship between the image and writing, a persistent and relevant trend that has involved authors of unquestionable talent, and has accompanied the general development of poetry and literature and the performing arts. At the beginning of that century, the most representative and high-profile case in Portugal (though achieving recognition only belatedly) was Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso, who made use of fragments of writing in his compositions, giving them a privileged place in keeping with the languages of synthetic cubism, futurism and Dadaism, which were at that time emerging (definitively). As was the case with other unquenchable artists, the very act of integrating external elements into his painting led to an expansion into new combinations, revealing an overlapping relatedness peopled by words from his private hoard, chosen for their creative and provocative seductiveness."
