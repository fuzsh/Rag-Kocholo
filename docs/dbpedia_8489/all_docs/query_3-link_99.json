        "text": "Álvaro de Campos is one of the most influential heteronyms created by Portugal’s great modernist writer Fernando Pessoa. According to Pessoa, Campos was born in Tavira (Algarve) in 1890 and studied mechanical engineering in Glasgow, although he never managed to complete his degree. In his own day, Campos was celebrated―and slandered―for his vociferous poetry imbued with a Whitman-inspired free verse, his praise of the rise of technology, and his polemical views that appeared in manifestos, interviews, and essays. Here in Margaret Jull Costa and Patricio Ferrari’s translations are the complete poems of Campos. This edition is based on the Portuguese Tinta-da-china edition and includes an illuminating introduction about Campos by the Portuguese editors Jerónimo Pizarro and Antonio Cardiello, facsimiles of original manuscripts, and a generous selection of Campos’s prose texts. A companion volume to Fernando Pessoa’s The Book of Disquiet and The Complete Works of Alberto Caeiro.\n\n“Arguably, the four greatest poets in the Portuguese language were all Pessoa using different names.”― NPR\n\n“Pessoa’s amazing personality is as beguiling and mysterious as his unique poetic output.”― William Boyd\n\n“As searing as Rilke or Mandelstam.” ― The New York Times\n\nAbout the Author\n\nFernando Pessoa (1888–1935), the Portuguese poet, literary critic, and essayist, is one of the most significant literary figures of the twentieth century. He wrote not only under his own name but under over a hundred others (including Alexander Search, Alberto Caeiro, Álvaro de Campos, Ricardo Reis, and Bernardo Soares).\n\nAbout the Editors\n\nAntónio Cardiello is a researcher in Philosophy and Comparative Literature at NOVA University Lisbon’s Institute of Philosophy. Jerónimo Pizarro is a professor at the Universidad de los Andes and editor-in-chief of Pessoa Plural―A Journal of Fernando Pessoa Studies.\n\nAbout the Translators\n\nMargaret Jull Costa has won the Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize four times as well as the Premio Valle-Inclán, the International Dublin Literary Award, and the 2008 PEN Prize for best translation from any language for The Maias, by Eça de Queirós (New Directions, 2007). Patricio Ferrari, a poet, translator, and editor, has translated the works of Fernando Pessoa and Alejandra Pizarnik, among others.\n\nBook Details\n\nTitle: The Complete Works of Álvaro de Campos\n\nAutor: Fernando Pessoa\n\nEditor: António Cardiello & Jerónimo Pizarro\n\nTranslators: Margaret Jull Costa & Patricio Ferrari\n\nPublisher‏: ‎New Directions\n\nPublication Date: July 4, 2023\n\nLanguage‏: ‎English\n\nPaperback‏: ‎480pp"
