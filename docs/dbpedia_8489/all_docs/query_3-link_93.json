        "text": "Figures and Thoughts\n\nHaving considered searching for books with a little different taste — softer, imaginary, and critical too — than I usually read as a serious reader, I decided to pick Pessoa out from a bookstore. In the rush of dealing with academic literature, it was obvious that I expected to be more relaxed. There might be an inspiration too, who knows.\n\nIt didn’t take much time for me to jump into the river. My attention increased after devouring verse after verse of Pessoa’s poems in A Little Larger Than the Entire Universe: Selected Poems at the first reading. The poems are straightforward and understandable. Those bring a transcendent atmosphere with just simple words. The reason it can reach a high level of substance is the use of logical patterns and it has several degrees of intellectual touches. Indeed, Pessoa himself is regarded as both a poet and an intellectual.\n\nThe typical points of his writings from the two books I have read so far are, logical and paradoxical. Since he has a concern in philosophy, many parts of his writings are colored by revealing, methods, theories, and questions, even in his poems which it is reasonable to consider his work as distinctive from the other works of its kind. He quite produced serious work with a different taste.\n\nA short note of Pessoa, he had ever enrolled in university but soon dropped out, preferring to study on his own at the National Library, where he systematically read major works of philosophy, history, sociology, and literature (especially Portuguese) in order to complement and extend the traditional English education he had received in South Africa.\n\nHis production of poetry and prose in English during this period was intense, and by 1910 he was also writing extensively in Portuguese. He published his first essay in literary criticism in 1912, his first piece of creative prose (a passage of The Book of Disquiet) in 1913, and his first poems in 1914.\n\nHe made a modest living translating the foreign correspondence of various commercial firms, and wrote obsessively — in English, Portuguese and French. He self-published several chapbooks of his English poems in 1918 and 1922, and regularly contributed his Portuguese poems to literary journals such as Orpheu and Portugal Futurista, Mensagem, a collection of poems on patriotic themes, won a consolation prize in a national competition in 1934.\n\nPessoa wrote much of his greatest poetry under three main ‘’heteronyms’, Alberto Caerio, Alvaro de Campos and Ricardo Reis, whose fully fleshed biographies he invented, giving them different writing styles and points of view. He created dozens of other writerly personas, including the assistant bookkeeper Bernardo Soares, the fictional author of The Book of Disquiet. Although Pessoa was acknowledged as an intellectual and a poet, his literary genius went largely unrecognized until after his death in 1935.\n\nFrom all of his creative ideas, I found something different and prominent concept he conveyed in the two books mentioned above namely Pessoa’s point of view of love, a thing hardly needs an explanation much less be theorized. This is the case, a creation from a poet and intellectual too; sweet but slightly complicated.\n\nSo how is it?\n\nPessoa views the problem of love as different from the general understanding, namely the relationship between two individuals reciprocally, but solely an individual activity independent of anyone: a struggle with oneself and never really involving others.\n\nLove is just a matter between human beings and their own concepts. When we love someone, for instance, we never really address our love for them. If at first glance it seems that the person we are referring to, it is because he or she fits the concepts of someone we have. In The Book of Disquiet, Pessoa said,\n\n“We never love anyone. What we love is the idea we have of someone. It’s our own concept — our own selves — that we love.”\n\nIt’s all about our selfish projection; the building of our thoughts and imagination. We love someone what we want or need. In a state of loving, we can’t see who the person actually is so we don’t know beyond what we see in our inner projection. We conceptualize someone and fall in love with this conception.\n\nSince each person has their own concept, two people who are regarded in love never know each other as they are. The process of recognizing, in this context, is hindered by preexisting concepts.\n\n“The relation between one soul and another, expressed through such uncertain and variable things as shared words and proffered gestures, are deceptively compelx. The very act of meeting each other is a non-meeting. Two people say ‘I love you’ or mutually think it and feel it and each has in mind a different idea, a different life, perhaps even a different colour or fragrance, in the abstract sum of impressions that constitute the soul’s activity.”\n\nWhat about the fact we see? Of course, two people can live together, but since there is a gap between concept and reality, between one’s desires and one’s actual state, things can become undesirable as the gap widens. Therefore, Pessoa considers romantic love a path of disillusion, and by my side is paradoxical too.\n\nSimply, this point can be understood, as he analogized, by comparing a suit made by the soul or imagination and given to those we think fit when they happen to come. But every suit, since it isn’t eternal, lasts as long as it lasts; and soon, under the suit of the ideal we have formed, the real body of the person we dressed will be revealed.\n\n“Romantic love is thus a path to disillusion, unless this disillusion, accepted from the start, decides to vary the ideal constantly, constantly sewing new suits in the soul’s workshops so as to constantly renew the appearance of the person they clothe.”\n\nBy considering the idea, love tends or is even inequivalent to possessing. One who is falling in love doesn’t have to be together with the aim subject, there will be no such consequence. To love is to be alone since we are only dealing with ourselves, our mind to be more precise.\n\nIt might be odd. However, ideas often work that way. The most appealing part of an idea I think its ability to dismantle the current establishment and show hidden particular truths. There were many notions seemingly paradoxical but also plausible at the same time. You can back to Platonic Love which negated the attachment, it is a logical absurdity.\n\nIf we move to Descartes and come to his answer to one of the fundamental questions “Who am I?” that we are nothing other than our own minds, the center of our consciousness, we exist only when we think (doubting) about something. All understanding of the external world and how we react to it is influenced by our thoughts. It’s like a bridge towards other subjects; in this case, you stop and play above it.\n\nThis Pessoa’s view indeed, is just one of many steps to consciousness about love, especially from the unconsciousness of possession idea we have built since we were born in this world and from the togetherness idea we have built since we hear the word love at the first time.\n\nBeyond this idea, Pessoa gave a tool to encounter the negative effects of the issue; sorrows, disappointment and regret. As with mistakes, heartbreak is also simply the result of ignorance. Knowing that love is such it is, makes us understand that there are imperfections even in what we consider to be human’s highest inner experience.\n\n“No one loves anyone else, he loves what he finds of himself in the other. Don’t freet if others don’t love you. They feel who you are, and you’re a stranger. Be who you are, even if never loved. Secure in yourself, you will suffer few sorrows.” — A Little Larger Than the Entire Universe: Selected Poems\n\nIn the end, we realize that we cannot be perfect, as perfect as the best concepts one can imagine. About love itself, however, it is a complicated thing. Not all definitions that have been given can describe it entirely. It is clear in assumptions but dense in methods. Even in Pessoa’s own work so far, I have not found a definitive description of love. Pessoa tends to explain how we love but not the question of what love is."
