        "text": "As you discover Portugal, the houses of writers can give you a different outlook on the places you visit.\n\nWe like to think that writers are special people, inspired by the places where they live. The houses give us more information on how they lived, where they wrote and how they worked, and many times we are surprised at the simplicity of those houses, located in idyllic settings, as if the landscape were enough to feed the creative genius. Visit these houses and learn a little more about the Portuguese soul.\n\nVale do Douro ©José Manuel\n\nCasa Miguel Torga - Coimbra\n\nMiguel Torga, a seminal poet in Portuguese literature of the twentieth Century, studied and lived in Coimbra where his house can now be visited. Miguel Torga is the pen name that Adolfo Correia da Rocha chose, partly because of his admiration for Miguel Cervantes and also for his love the plant [torga also means ‘heather’] that grew in his native land. A physician by profession, he devoted himself to writing poetry from an early age and became known as a great upholder of freedom and truth during the period of the dictatorship in which he lived. The house, where he wrote much of his work, still retains the atmosphere of the time.\n\nMiguel Torga House – Vale do Douro\n\nMiguel Torga was born in São Martinho de Anta, in Sabrosa, a municipality in the Vale do Douro. In addition to the house where he spent his childhood, you can visit the Espaço Miguel Torga, a modern building by the renowned architect Eduardo Souto de Moura. Its main purpose is to promote the work of the great writer from Trás-os-Montes.\n\nIn the region of Porto and the North there are common references to Miguel Torga, who described the man-built landscape of the Douro Valley as a “geological poem”.\n\nEça de Queiroz Foundation/Tormes House Museum – Vale do Douro\n\nThe legacy of Eça de Queiroz and his works are on display at the Tormes House Museum, located in the municipality of Baião, in the Douro Valley. This writer is one of the great figures of Portuguese literature, being known for his critical view of 19th-century society and for his detailed descriptions of Portuguese habits and customs, presenting a caricature of that very unique period. For a genuine travel through time, go to the train station, which recreates the atmosphere of the writer’s last novel, A Cidade e as Serras (The City and the Mountains)."
