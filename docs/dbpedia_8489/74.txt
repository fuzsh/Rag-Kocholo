Fernando Pessoa was a Portuguese poet, writer, literary critic, translator, publisher, and philosopher, considered one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets in the Portuguese language. Born on June 13, 1888, in Lisbon, Portugal, and passing away on November 30, 1935, Pessoa's influence remains strong in the literary world.

Pessoa is best known for his heteronyms, alter egos with distinct biographies, personalities, writing styles, and worldviews. These heteronyms include Alberto Caeiro, Álvaro de Campos, Ricardo Reis, and Bernardo Soares, among others. Through these characters, Pessoa expressed a vast array of philosophical concepts, existential questions, and literary theories, making his work complex and multidimensional.

His most famous work, "The Book of Disquiet," written by the heteronym Bernardo Soares, is a fragmentary lifetime project, a "factless autobiography" composed of reflections, philosophical insights, and lyrical passages. It wasn't published during Pessoa's lifetime and only came to light in fragments starting from the 1980s, offering a deep introspection into the human soul and modern life's discontents.

Aside from his literary creations, Pessoa was also involved in the cultural and artistic life of Lisbon, contributing to magazines and literary movements, engaging in correspondences with other intellectuals, and dabbling in occultism and mysticism. His work spans poetry, philosophical essays, literary criticism, and prose, including translations of English literature into Portuguese.

Despite his prolific output, Pessoa remained largely unknown outside Portugal during his lifetime, and his recognition as a central figure in world literature has largely occurred posthumously. Today, his work has been translated into many languages, and he is celebrated for his intellectual depth, innovative use of language, and the profound impact he has had on literature and thought.
