"Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa claimed that he did not evolve, but rather travelled. This book provides a state of the art panorama of Pessoa's literary travels, particularly the English-speaking world. Its eighteen short, jargon-free essays ... explore the influence on Pessoa's thinking of such writers as Whitman and Shakespeare, as well as his creative dialogues with figures ranging from decadent poets to the dark magician Aleister Crowley, and, finally, some of the ways in which he in turn has influenced others. They examine many different aspects of Pessoa's work, ranging from the poetry of the heteronyms to the haunting prose of The Book of Disquiet, from esoteric writings to personal letters, from reading notes to unpublished texts"--P.
