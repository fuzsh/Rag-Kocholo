Biography

German physicist and recipient of the 1905 Nobel Prize for Physics for his research on cathode rays and the discovery of many of their properties. His results had important implications for the development of electronics and nuclear physics.

After working as a lecturer and as an assistant to Heinrich Hertz at the University of Bonn in 1893, Lenard became a professor of physics successively at the universities of Breslau (1894), Aachen (1895), Heidelberg (1896), and Kiel (1898). In 1907 he returned to teach at the University of Heidelberg, where he stayed until his retirement in 1931.

He discovered the phenomenon later became known as the photoelectric effect.

Lenard’s extensive research also included studies of ultraviolet light, the electrical conductivity of flames, and phosphorescence.
