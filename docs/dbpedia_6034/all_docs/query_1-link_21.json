My name is Philipp Lenard. „ ~ Philipp Lenard\n\n“ Mama... I ... I’m coming home. „ ~ Phillip’s last words before being shot by Einstein after the latter gained his abilities.\n\nPhilipp Eduard Anton Von Lenard, also known as The Mysterious Stranger and formerly known as Lil' Philipp is the main antagonist of the YouTube animated series, Super Science Friends. He is a little boy, who, after having his life ruined by the Super Science Friends, would eventually grow up to become their worst archenemy by becoming a Nazi, who swore revenge on them for everything they ever did to him.\n\nin the sixth episode, he was voiced by Laurel Dalgleish as a child, in the final episode, he is voiced by Tom Park.\n\nBiography[]\n\nIn \"The Phantom Premise\", Lil' Philipp was holding a little red balloon and walking with his mother, just being his innocent little self. At this time, Sigmund Freud decided to have a little fun and use his sex-based mind-control powers to make Philipp and his mother start making out just for a quick laugh. Philipp, under the influence of Freud's powers, started making out with his mom and in the process, let go of his balloon.\n\nIn \"Electric Boogaloo\", Nikola Tesla needed something to help him recharge his electric powers. Albert Einstein spotted Lil' Philipp holding a balloon and snatched it from him, knocking him over in the process. As Philip lied on the ground, his mom came up to him and scolded him for losing another balloon.\n\nIn \"Nobel of the Ball\", Lil' Philipp was one of the nominees to win the Nobel prize in chemistry at the 11th Annual Nobel Prize Awards for his baking soda volcano. Lil' Philipp sat in the audience with his family, happily awaiting the chance to win his award. Sadly, he lost to Marie Curie. His parents were extremely upset about their son losing the award and started screaming and arguing with each other, while Philipp angrily slammed his volcano on the floor and sulked.\n\nIn \"Freudian Sleep\", Einstein accidentally spilled some of Darwin's tea on the hand of Lil' Philipp, while he was sleeping, causing him to wet the bed. Philip's dad walked by and saw what Philip had done and started lashing out at him for it, verbally abusing him and blaming him for his mother leaving. On Philip's wall, he had a poster of the Super Science Friends, with the faces of Freud, Einstein, and Marie Curie all scratched out, as these three members of the team had pissed him off in the past three episodes. Also, implied by a newspaper in the following episode, Philipp's bedwetting incident led his father to kick him out of the house.\n\nIn \"Are You There, God? It's Me, Darwin\", Philip's picture was seen in the newspaper, where he was holding a picture of his lost mother, in search of her. The news article outlined what Philip said about the Super Science Friends and detailed all of his encounters with them, which led to his life getting ruined.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Philipp appeared again, going to the Catholic Church in search of his mother. The priest at the church saw Philipp and lured him into the church, saying that his mother was in there, (when in reality it was clear he was trying to molest him). Philipp still believed that he was going to find his mom but before he could get into the church, the timeline shifted (due to the Super Science Friends going back in time and stopping Christianity from existing), which caused the church to transform into \"The First Church of Teslaology\". Philip was upset as this meant that he lost his chance to find his mother.\n\nIn \"Fullmetal Scientist\", Philipp went around a big bustling city, asking all the people who went by if they had seen his mother but none of them had. Just then, Philipp miraculously spotted his mother, buying a balloon from the balloon stand. Philipp called out to her and got her attention. Philipp's mother happily ran to him and the two got ready to hug. However, before he could get to his mom, The Super Science Friends drove by in their time traveling Sciencemobile and crushed Philipp's mother to death right in front of him. At this time, the Super Science Friends also opened a time portal, while Philipp fell into.\n\nIn \"The Magnificent Episode 7\", Philipp fell out of the time portal and landed in the old west of 1858, where immediately upon landing, he started getting chased by coyotes.\n\nYears later, in the year 1920, Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels, Josef Mengele, and Obergruppenführer were sitting at Schnitzel's restaurant, where they were first establishing \"The Nazis\". All their team was missing now was a leader. Just then, a full-grown Philipp Lenard entered, in badass cowboy attire, saying that he would be perfect for the job, thus making him, in a way, the new timeline's version of Hitler.\n\nFast forward to 1941, where Lil' Philipp invaded The Super Science Friend's Laboratory and Einstein was captured by Lil' Philipp, accompanied by a team of Nazis, who threw Einstein into a prison cell, with the rest of the Super Science Friends, who had all also been kidnapped by Lil' Phillip and the Nazis. Einstein tried to use his powers to escape but as with all of the other Science Friends, his powers didn't work. Philipp entered, explaining that the reason they were powerless, was because he built their prison cell out of metal from the dead zone (The South), which was the one place where science held no power. Philipp Lenard got ready to leave and kidnap Z-3 but before he left, he told The Super Science Friends that they'd be trapped in their prison for the rest of their lives, that he'd make them all suffer for what they did, and finally, told them his name, revealing to the audience who he was the future version of.\n\nIn the prison cell, Tapputi said that she needed to poop and Marie Curie gave her a cup to poop in but Tapputi said that she couldn't go with everyone watching. Tapputi started crying over the fact that she was a \"nervous pooer\" and slammed herself against the cell door, which opened perfectly, as apparently someone forgot to lock it, allowing for The Super Science Friends to escape. Philipp smugly witnesses their escape, from the roof of the prison, apparently having planned on them escaping so that they could \"run tho their doom\".\n\nAs The Super Science Friends ran to their escape, they came to a bridge across a canyon. Philipp showed up in a giant Nazi hot air balloon overhead and asked Einstein if he recognized his balloon. Einstein didn't recognize it so Philipp explained that it was reminiscent of the many red balloons throughout his childhood that he had lost, thanks to The Super Science Friends, which were associated with all the moments when his life got ruined. It eventually clicked with Einstein that this \"Philipp Lenard\" was the kid whose balloon he stole to charge up Tesla. Philipp Lenard threw some Molotov cocktails at them and destroyed the bridge, making them all fall into the river.\n\nEinstein, Churchill, Tesla, Freud, and Marie Murie all made it out of the river, but Darwin and Tapputi had gotten lost, where they were greeted by a little girl who led them to her house, with the family. The father of this family offered to let them lay low in his house, so they could hide from Philipp only for the Science Friends to find out that this family was actually a family of pawns, led by Philipp, who had caught them directly in his trap. Philip explained that when he first joined the Nazis, he knew they had some crazy ideas of trapping Jews in gas chambers and killing them. He said that he didn't like that idea because it lacked \"sport\", and that as a sporty man, he wanted to kill them in a more satisfying manner, by giving them a five-minute head start so that he could hunt them down and kill them later. The Super Science Friends got on top of a train and after five minutes, Philipp got into his hot air balloon and very quickly found them. He got ready to shoot Einstein dead but at this time, Taputti, Darwin, and their new Indian friend, Cheeks That Are Sweet used a shotgun to shoot down the balloon, sending Philipp crashing down into the train. Philipp was infuriated that his balloon was destroyed and so he shot Tapputi and Darwin off their standing rock, landing them on the train as well. Philipp pulled out his gun and got ready to shoot Einstein in a fast draw. However, just at this time, the train crossed over from the South to the North, allowing for Einstein to use his powers again. Frightened that he was about to face off against an empowered Science Friend, Philipp took out his gun and fired it but it was too late, as they already crossed over to the North and even after he fired the bullet, Einstein was able to use his super-speed to dodge it and empty the entire clip into Philipp, slowly killing him.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nPhilipp Lenard is obviously meant to parody the real-world Philipp Lenard, who, like his animated version, was a scientist, chemist, and Nazi-enthusiast, who hated Albert Einstein.\n\nIn \"Nobel of the Ball\", when Philipp's parents were arguing, and his father, (Philipp von Lenardis) told his mother (Antonie Baumann) that Philipp was her son, in a way that implied that Philipp isn't his own son, meaning that it's possible the man who serves as Philipp's father isn't his biological dad.\n\nPhilipp was also shown to have an unnamed little brother in this episode. In real life, there are no historical records showing that Lenard had any siblings.\n\nIn \"The Amazing Episode Seven\", Philipp Lenard cursed Sigmund Freud for making him tongue-kiss his mother, as \"he won't never find a woman like that.\" [sic] This implies that Philipp Lenard was given an Oedipus complex for his mother that he never truly got over.\n\nAdditionally, the news article on Philipp in \"Are You There God? It's Me, Darwin\", mentions that at the time he was making out with his mom, he was also given the urge to kill his father but didn't have any reason to act on it, as his father wasn't with him at the time.\n\nAs an adult, Philipp Lenard's newfound \"evil cowboy\" persona is loosely based on Bartholomew Bogue from The Magnificent Seven.\n\nGallery[]\n\nScreenshots[]"
