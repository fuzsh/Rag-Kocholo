        "text": "Philip Lenard was a gifted boy. The son of a wine merchant from Tyrol was born in the early summer of 1862 in what was then Pressburg, today's Bratislava, in the Habsburg Monarchy. Only a month after his birth on the other side of the vast empire, his countryman, Nikola Tesla, turns six.\n\nAlthough he is of German origin, Filip attends the Royal Hungarian High School, studies Hungarian. He declares himself in his early days as a Hungarian nationalist. He refuses to pronounce the German names of places in the province where he lives, he speaks only Hungarian. He signs himself as Fülöp Lenardi. In 1880, he enrolled at the university in Budapest. It may have been there, in 1881, that he met a bony young man from Smiljan, Nikola Tesla, who, after Graz and Prague, tried his luck as a student in the Hungarian capital. But we will never know. They did not leave a mark on each other's lives then.\n\nLenard moved to Vienna, but he too, like Tesla, a restless and fickle spirit, stopped studying natural sciences and devoted himself to selling wine in his native Pressburg. The wine epic lasts a short time, and Lenard goes to Heidelberg, Germany, to continue his studies. He is fascinated by phosphorus. He is getting his doctorate, doing research. Cathode rays, a new model of the atom. Ionized air intoxicates him. Lightning. Another point of contact with Tesla. In 1905, he received the Nobel Prize for Physics. At the age of forty-three, he is on the scientific Olympus. His former countryman Tesla had a more thorny road.\n\nThe Great War breaks out. In October 1914, Philip Lenard signs the \"Appeal of the Ninety-Three\". Among the signatories are not pacifists like Albert Einstein and Hermann Hesse. In that appeal, prominent German and Austro-Hungarian scientists, artists, and public figures address the \"cultural world\" with an appeal that begins as follows: \"We, as representatives of German science and culture, raise our voice in front of the entire cultural world against the lies and slander with which our enemies want to defame Germany pure thing in the existential struggle\".\n\nThe whole paper is in that tone. Denying German responsibility for crimes in Belgium, denying German responsibility for the war. A pattern that will later be repeated in many wars by nationalist elites around the world. It is particularly interesting where these German intellectuals challenge their opponents in France and England for the right to present themselves as defenders of civilization since they aligned themselves \"with the Russians and Serbs\". Or because \"they offer the world a shameful show in which they incite Mongols and Negroes against the white race.\" They also believed in sentences like this: \"Without German militarism, German culture would have been razed to the ground a long time ago.\"\n\nFilip Lenard was not the only international signing. There are Max Planck, who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1919, Gerhard Hauptmann, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1912, Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen, after whom X-rays are still called today - he was honored with the first Nobel Prize for Physics in 1901 history. There is also Max Liebermann, the most famous German impressionist to this day. The list is long. All major dailies in Germany published this appeal.\n\nDuring the First World War, Filip Lenard was involved in compiling standard physics manuals. He was a convinced monarchist. The outcome of the war caused him a deep nationalist trauma. This led him directly into the arms of the Nazis. He denounced Einstein's theory of relativity in the newspapers as a \"Jewish hoax\". He dreamed of \"Aryan physics\". He experienced the collapse of the Third Reich, but he remained completely alone as a physicist, because the world recognized the genius of a cosmopolitan of Jewish origin - Albert Einstein, but, admittedly a little later, also the genius of a lightning tamer of Serbian origin, Nikola Tesla. And neither of them were people of hatred. The peoples and cultures that Philip Leonard blindly hated produced minds that were closer to the laws of the universe and the dazzling play of natural elements than he, Philip Leonard, could bear.\n\nThe Americans exempted him from the denazification program due to his advanced age. He died on May 20, 1947.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the posterity slowly began to look at him with different eyes. One by one, the streets named after him were renamed. In Munich in 1966. In Klagenfurt in 2008. In Dortmund in 2014. One street in the Canadian\n\nQuebec was called Rue Philipp Lenard until 2015. And then it became Rue Marie Curie.\n\nOnly Lenardova Street still exists in his native Bratislava. Maybe because collaborationist Slovakia between 1939 and 1945 more or less consistently implemented Great German ideas to which the excellent physicist Philip Lenard sold his soul back in 1914.\n\nThe author is an editor Deutsche Welle - programs in Serbian\n\nNews"
