        "text": "It was in 1887 when Heinrich Hertz was conducting experiments to prove Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory of light that he noticed a strange phenomenon. Hertz used a spark gap (two sharp electrodes placed at a small distance so that electric sparks can be generated) to detect the presence of electromagnetic waves. He placed it in a dark box to get a closer look and found that the spark length was reduced. When he used a glass box, the spark length increased, and when he replaced it with a quartz box, the spark length increased further. This was the first observation of the photoelectric effect.\n\nA year later, Wilhelm Hallwachs confirmed these results and showed that UV light on a Zinc plate connected to a battery generated a current (because of electron emission). In 1898, J.J. Thompson found that the current amount varied with the radiation intensity and frequency.\n\nIn 1902, Lenard observed that the kinetic energy of electrons emitted increased with the frequency of radiation used. This could not be explained as Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory (which Hertz proved correct) predicted that the kinetic energy should depend only on light intensity (not frequency).\n\nThe resolution would only come a few years later by Einstein when he would provide an explanation of the photoelectric effect."
