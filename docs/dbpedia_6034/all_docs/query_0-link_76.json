        "text": "Transcript\n\nWhen materials such as metal absorb radiant energy in the form of light or other electromagnetic radiation, electrons are expelled. This phenomenon is called the photoelectric effect. Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, discovered the photoelectric effect in 1887. He observed that shining an ultraviolet light on electrodes caused a change in the voltage between them. Other work during the 19th century built on Hertzâ€™s observations. Philipp Lenard in 1902 demonstrated that illuminating a metal surface liberated electrically charged particles that were identical to electrons. These findings and others showed an interaction between light and matter that could not be explained by classical physics, which describes light as an electromagnetic wave. Consideration of these and other findings led Albert Einstein in 1905 to formulate a new theory of light, which proposed that light is transmitted as discrete particles of energy, now called photons."
