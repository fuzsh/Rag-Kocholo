But this is inevitably based upon a fallacy. In reality, as with everything that man creates, science is determined by race or by blood. It can seem to be international when universally valid scientific results are wrongly traced to a common origin[3]or when it is not acknowledged that science supplied by peoples of different countries is identical or similar to German science, and that their science could only have been produced because and to the extent that other peoples are or were likewise of a predominantly Nordic racial mix. Nations of different racial mixes practice science differently."
