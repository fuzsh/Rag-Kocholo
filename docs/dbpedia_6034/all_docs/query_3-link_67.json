I investigated.\n\nWilhelm Konrad Röntgen, 1896 (1)⇓\n\nGerman physics? one asks. I might rather have said Aryan physics or the physics of the Nordic species of man… But, I shall be answered, “Science is and remains international.” It is false. Science, like every other human product, is racial and conditioned by blood.\n\nPhillip Lenard, “German Physics,” 1936 (2)⇓\n\nPeople who could not spell the word “vote” or say it in English put a committed socialist ideologue in the White House. His name is Barack Hussein Obama. The revolution has come. It was led by the cult of multiculturalism aided by leftist liberals all over who don’t have the same ideas about America as we do.\n\nCongressman Tom Tancredo, 2010 (3)⇓\n\nNationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind."
