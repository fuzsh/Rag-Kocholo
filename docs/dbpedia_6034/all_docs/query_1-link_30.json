        "text": "Philipp Lenard was the founder of the so-called ‘Deutsche Physik,’ a notorious Nazi campaign to rid German science of ‘foreign influences’ such as quantum theory and relativity. In the 1920s, Lenard led a vocal antisemitic campaign against Einstein, causing him to have to cancel talks and rebut criticism of relativity. He attacked Einstein every chance he could, and had his students distribute defamatory leaflets at Einstein's public lectures. He joined the party as one its few early members with a scientific background (let alone a Nobel prize). Later, some scientists (such as Pascual Jordan) joined the party for expedience; Lenard clearly did it for ideology.\n\nYet, surprisingly, when the English language version of Lenard’s 1933 book ‘Great Men of Science,’ a biographical account of the history of science, appeared, the New York Times gave it a very favorable review on September 17 of that year.\n\nThe author of the review, Maynard Shipley, somehow was misinformed about Lenard’s background. How else could he write ‘Dr. Lenard’s eminent position in physics guarantees the authenticity of this book… It is good that before Germany reverted--temporarily, let us hope--to the Dark Ages, there came from one of its truly great men this testimonial to the cosmic spirit of all real scientific thought?’\n\nShipley notes that Lenard doesn’t mention relativity or quantum physics anywhere in his book, nor Einstein, but offers the excuse that ‘no one was included who was alive after 1918.’ That conveniently explains the inclusion of Austrian physicist Friedrich Hasenhoehrl, who calculated the mass-energy relationship the year before Einstein, but wrongly, and then was killed in World War I.\n\nThe favorable review certainly shows that it is important to delve into a scientist’s background before reviewing his biographical accounts of other scientists."
