        "text": "AKA Philipp Eduard Anton Lenard\n\nBorn: 7-Jun-1862\n\nBirthplace: Pozsony, Slovak Republic\n\nDied: 20-May-1947\n\nLocation of death: Messelhausen, Germany\n\nCause of death: unspecified\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Christian\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Physicist\n\nNationality: Germany\n\nExecutive summary: Investigations of cathode rays\n\nGerman physicist Philipp Lenard studied under Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Hermann von Helmholtz, and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1905 for his investigations of cathode rays (electron beams). His work showed that electrons could be induced to radiate beyond the evacuated tube where they were produced, and that this radiation could travel short distances and penetrate sheets of metallic foil. From this he extrapolated a new but incorrect model of the atom, which was debated briefly until the acceptance of Ernest Rutherford's view of atomic design.\n\nHe is almost as well-known for his study of the photoelectric effect, a phenomenon which occurs when light strikes metallic surfaces. He also studied the size and shape of raindrops, describing what is sometimes called the Lenard effect, the separation of electric charges as water drops break up. His other work concerned phosphorescence, luminescence, and electrical conductivity of flames.\n\nLenard broke with the mainstream of science in the 1920s, disputing Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, and wrote the four-volume physics text Deutsche Physik (German Physics), which almost completely ignored \"Jewish science\" (i.e., Einstein). He was a strong believer in eugenics and an enthusiastic supporter of the Nazi Party as it took power in Germany, and in return the Third Reich honored him by expanding his University of Heidelberg laboratory into the Philipp Lenard Institute. He complained that he had been denied his proper credit for Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen's discovery of x-rays, and accused Einstein of misleading people with \"pseudoscience\" that had little experimental support.\n\nFather: (wine merchant)\n\nWife: Katharina Schlehner\n\nHigh School: Modern College at Pressburg, Pozsony, Slovak Republic\n\nUniversity: University of Budapest (attended)\n\nUniversity: University of Vienna (attended)\n\nUniversity: University of Berlin (attended)\n\nUniversity: PhD, University of Heidelberg (1886)\n\nScholar: University of Heidelberg (1886-89)\n\nTeacher: University of Bonn (1893-94)\n\nTeacher: University of Breslau (1894-95)\n\nTeacher: University of Aachen (1895-96)\n\nTeacher: University of Heidelberg (1896-98)\n\nProfessor: Experimental Physics, University of Kiel (1898-1907)\n\nProfessor: Physics, University of Heidelberg (1907-31)\n\nAdministrator: Philipp Lenard Institute, University of Heidelberg (1907-31)\n\nRumford Medal 1896 (with Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen)\n\nMatteucci Medal 1896 (with Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen)\n\nBenjamin Franklin Medal 1905 (by the Franklin Institute)\n\nNobel Prize for Physics 1905\n\nNational Socialist German Workers Party\n\nRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences 1905\n\nHungarian Academy of Sciences 1907\n\nGerman Ancestry\n\nHungarian Ancestry\n\nSlovak Ancestry\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nÜber Kathodenstrahlen (On Cathode Rays) (1906, physics)\n\nUeber Aether und Materie(About Ether and Matter) (1911, physics)\n\nProbleme komplexer Moleküle (Problems of Complex Molecules) (1914, physics)\n\nÜber das Relativitätsprinzip (On the Principle of Relativity) (1918, physics)\n\nGrosse Naturforscher (Greater Science) (1929, memoir)\n\nGreat Men of Science: A History of Scientific Progress (1933, non-fiction)\n\nDeutsche Physik (German Physics) (1936-37, physics, 4 vols.)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Philipp Lenard\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
