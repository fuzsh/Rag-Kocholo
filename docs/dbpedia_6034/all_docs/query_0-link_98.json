Although it is labeled on Jennifer Blue's new Lunar Orbiter-based IAU nomenclature map of LAC zone 1, its form is much clearer in the Clementine mosaic. It is slightly beyond the mean limb, but should be visible with a favorable libration (whenever the far rim of Hermite is visible). - Jim Mosher\n\nWikipedia\n\nAdditional Information\n\nIAU page: Lenard\n\nNomenclature\n\nNamed for Philipp Lenard (June 7, 1862 – May 20, 1947), a Hungarian-German physicist and the winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1905 for his research on cathode rays and the discovery of many of their properties.\n\nLPOD Articles\n\nBibliography\n\nTwo New Crater Names Approved for Earth's Moon"
