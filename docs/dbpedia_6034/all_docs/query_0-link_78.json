        "text": "By the end of World War I, Albert Einstein had become the face of the new science of theoretical physics and had made some powerful enemies. One of those enemies, Nobel Prize winner Philipp Lenard, spent a career trying to discredit him. Their story of conflict, pitting Germany’s most widely celebrated Jew against the Nazi scientist who was to become Hitler’s chief advisor on physics, had an impact far exceeding what the scientific community felt at the time. Indeed, their mutual antagonism affected the direction of science long after 1933, when Einstein took flight to America and changed the history of two nations. The Man Who Stalked Einstein details the tense relationship between Einstein and Lenard, their ideas and actions, during the eventful period between World War I and World War II.\n\nThis book title, The Man Who Stalked Einstein (How Nazi Scientist Philipp Lenard Changed the Course of History), ISBN: 9781493010011, by Bruce J. Hillman, Birgit Ertl-Wagner, Bernd C. Wagner, published by Lyons Press (April 14, 2015) is available in hardcover. Our minimum order quantity is 25 copies.
