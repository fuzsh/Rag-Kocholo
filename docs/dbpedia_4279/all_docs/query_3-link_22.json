        "text": "By the year 1850 Germans and their children already constituted some 10% of the population of South Australia. Today I should like to look at two particular aspects of German immigration into Adelaide: the rights of Germans as citizens and secondly, to try and illustrate how the German community was in every sense, disunited. Unlike it was perceived by many British-Australians, it was anything but monolithic.\n\nThe 1850s were politically important years for the German settlers. Two German newspapers had been launched, Die Deutsche Post (The German Post) and Deutsche Zeitung für Südaustralien, (German Newspaper for South Australia) and a German Hospital had been opened. The Liedertafel started as did the famous Brunswick Brass Band. Der Deutsche Club (German Club) began in 1854 and was to flourish as a centre of German culture and learning until 1907. German miners from the Harz Mountains were active in the colony’s copper fields while German smelters brought their skills of how to smelt with timber to the Glen Osmond and the Burra mines. In the 1850s numerous German silver and goldsmiths arrived in the colony to settle in Adelaide, as did cabinet and piano makers.\n\nA handful of middle class Germans who had participated in the abortive European revolutions of 1848 had elected to go to South Australia rather than like most of their contemporaries, the United States. Because of their background and education, these Germans gave a new sense of focus and leadership to the German community, particularly in Adelaide.\n\nHowever it was difficult for the Germans to feel fully accepted in South Australia. Although naturalised they did not have all the rights of British born South Australians. For example their naturalisation was not even accepted in the neighbouring colony of Victoria and although they could vote, a naturalised German could not be a member of the Legislative Council. The right of the Germans to sit on the legislating body was seen by them as essential if naturalisation was to be meaningful. German rights, as the leading Adelaide newspaper, The Register wrote on 3 September 1855, were a major constitutional issue of the day and a hot political potato. The liberal Register editorialised, ‘Let us make from the native of all countries a new political confederation of South Australians. The necessity of abolishing in this colony all political distinctions resulting from class or race, and uniting under the common privileges of one and the same constitution every bone fide settler on this soil’. [1]\n\nBut not all South Australians agreed. Many Englishmen felt the Germans should be grateful that they were even allowed to come to South Australia and should refrain from demanding equal political rights with Englishmen A gentleman signing himself a sexagenarian Briton, wrote in the same month to another Adelaide newspaper, The Advertiser, advising that ‘our Teutonic friends have very good reason to be thankful for the refuge South Australia has afforded them … and they ought to gratefully acknowledge and quietly enjoy their freedom. I would naturalise no more Germans until they made the English language a professed object in their education … To have the rights of Anglo-Saxons they must cease to be Germans’. [2]\n\nOn the 27 August 1855 to protest at the exclusion of Germans from the Legislature a petition was drawn up by some members of the community and a report of this petition appearing in The Adelaide Observer on 27 September 1855, under the heading, ‘German Rights’. The deputation numbered among its members several British born South Australians who were of the opinion that British justice was not being done to the Germans by excluding them from becoming politicians. The Governor said that recently he had had the pleasure of ‘traversing several districts of the colony cultivated principally by Germans, and he had with pleasure remarked on the rapid conversion, effected by their energy, of a recent wilderness to a civilised country, studded with thriving homesteads and apparently paying a rich return to those who had spent their time and labour in its cultivation.’ [3]\n\nFurther, the Governor promised that when South Australia achieved responsible Government ‘those aliens who sought the privilege of sharing the honours of legislation should… and that these conditions would therefore form portions of the proposed bill’. [4]\n\nTherefore when South Australia elected its first responsible Government in 1857 it numbered among its members, F. E. W. H. Krichauff, who had been born in Schleswig, Germany, in 1824. He had stood for parliament with the express purpose of seeing the Real Property Act passed. Mention must be made here of Dr Ulrich Hübbe who advised the government on the land laws of the Hansa towns of Germany. This advice was to be incorporated in this Act of 1857. However also in 1857 came the first recorded statement of Germans defending themselves against claims that they were going to set up a state within a state (imperium in imperio) to use the language of the day, ‘And here I would forestall any possible imputation of seeking to foster a spirit of isolated nationality amongst any of my fellow countrymen.’ [5]\n\nAlthough defended by the Adelaide Times, ‘We have no fear that our nationality will depart from us or that John Bull will bid adieu to South Australia because a few of his German cousins may arrive on a permanent visit. The colony is, and ever will be, essentially a British land.’ [6]\n\nTheir cause was not helped by the fact that Germans in 1854 started to form their own cultural groups, in this case the influential German Club, ‘while they rejoiced at living in a free country it was devilishly boring. Theatre, plays, concerts and the like were of such a standard that one begrudged even the shilling that one had to pay. From this conversation sprang the idea to form a German Club and to amuse and entertain themselves in a traditional German manner.’ [7]\n\nOther Germans clearly never wanted to see their homeland again, ‘We like it here and I’m not returning to your stupid Germany, not for 10,000 Thaler. That cursed land. Now I have really learnt the difference between a really free land and Germany. What I earn here belongs to me. There is no title here, not a penny, not even direct taxation. All our special taxes are unknown here… here one can do as one likes and no one cares. Despite that everything is orderly and lawlessness is not tolerated, rather strictly punished… here one doesn’t give one’s children to the military to be killed, because an army does not exist here. Never the less we live here in a situation of safety.’ [8]\n\nFor the women in particular however, life could be lonely in a strange land, ‘Most of the time I am with you all in the homeland. Despite the fact that this land is so beautiful, one still doesn’t feel at home, at least I don’t. I have been here for over ten years and I feel just as strange and foreign as if I had just arrived. After my sister left a great gap appeared in my life. With her I could talk about you, my dear ones at home, and I could endure the crippling loneliness. In my mind now I often wander with you around the house and see you doing your different tasks. When I tell you that my thoughts wander about the old home, I don’t mean just the house but the whole village. In my mind I wonder through the church, the school and over the mountains and the paths. I see everything just as I knew it, just as left it.’ [9]\n\nFor the Germans perhaps their greatest virtue was seen to be their self reliance. They did not look to the state for favours, but rather tried to solve their problems from their own resources. In a colony where “self-help” was regarded as the supreme virtue by the Baptists and Congregationalists who were then the leaders of the society, the self reliance of the Germans was seen as a shining example for others to follow.\n\nBut there is another side to the story of the Germans in South Australia at this time. In 1853 Heising, one of the earliest collectors of information on Australia, had reported that the lot of some of the Germans in Adelaide was far from a happy one and he attributed this at least in part to the fact that, ‘many of those who have recently arrived from Germany have the type of work that was to be found in large cities but not in a city such as Adelaide which was simply too new and had only just started to acquire the social life and facilities of the older European cities.’ [10]\n\nHe continued, ‘Painters, sculptors, lithographers were forced to take manual labour while Prussian officers, even the sons of Generals, were forced to become salesmen. [11] In a colony whose economic life centred around the plough and the mine only the beginnings of an analogy with the social life of the old world could be made.’ [12]\n\nHeising claimed that a ‘not inconsiderable number of Germans in the city of Adelaide had reached the depths of moral depravity and could not even face returning to Germany. This moral debasement was easy enough in a colony where “Profit” seemed to be the solution to everything and how such a profit was arrived at rested only with the imagination of the person or persons concerned. In this atmosphere the Germans in particular showed a total lack of trust towards others.’ [13]\n\nIn the German ‘poor quarter’ near Angas street the Germans had given to their houses such names as, Much Distress, Little Distress, German Distress, Rose Distress and High Misery. [14] Heising wrote that ‘the immigrant town dwellers had given the Germans in Adelaide a bad name, off set only by the excellent name of those Germans living on the land’. [15]\n\nHe suggested that one of the more particular reasons for the bad reputation of the Adelaide Germans was their political-radical-democratic passion. The desire by some Adelaide Germans, wrote Heising, to be independent of England was looked upon as little less than blasphemy and calculated to arouse deep disgust [16] as well as antagonising those Germans contented with their situation on the land.\n\nHeising complained that in general at this time the German newspapers in the colony had failed to give any moral leadership and indeed had failed to really reflect the interests of the South Australian German population although this may have been difficult given the diverse interests of the community\n\nHeising quoted a newspaper article which suggested that despite their numbers the Germans were still not exercising the full potential of their political power and to the writer the reasons were clear, ‘as due to their numerous divisions the Germans, rarely if ever, were able to command a united front’. [17] The article stated that the Germans’ most serious and holy duty was to cease being divided and torn apart. For the moment, wrote Heising, all one had seen from the Germans was hate, animosity and hostility towards each other. Unless there was a united German element in South Australia, then German influence would remain a chimera. [18]\n\nWhile such internecine strife weakened the Germans as a political force in retrospect it is entirely understandable. For Germans who came to Australia before the unification of Germany in 1871 their first loyalty was either to their religion and/or the town, village or region from which they came. Their German tradition was cultural, not national-political, and they behaved in the manner they had learnt from their parents or had experienced as youths. Parochial loyalties for many were paramount.\n\nThe memories of C. S. D. Schondorf would be representative of how nearly all German autobiographies of the period began. ‘I was born 6 September at Schwerin, Mecklenburg.’ There is no mention of either Prussia or Germany or indeed his date of birth which would have been early nineteenth century. [19]\n\nHowever even if religion was the prime loyalty, and for most Germans in the country who arrived prior to 1879 this was the case, then which synod of the Lutheran Church one belonged to was of even greater importance. Adelaide reflected the divisions within the Lutheran Church although perhaps not with quite the vitriol shown in the country districts. In Adelaide too there was another dimension of diversity. The large middle class affluent group of Germans in Adelaide generally had decidedly liberal views and therefore felt estranged from the more didactic views of the two main synods. This group formed their own congregation, St Stephen’s which effectively separated them from the more working and artisan class congregations who attended the churches of the two main Lutheran synods. Another group from the German middle class further alienated themselves by not attending church at all or by attending a non-Lutheran Church, or by centering their efforts on the German Club. It was the old German split between Club Germans and Church Germans. As the German Club was decidedly upper middle class this further exacerbated the difference between the classes. These often deep antagonisms – and we have not in this paper touched on city-country differences – were to serve the Germans badly when the First World War broke out in 1914.\n\nOne other factor stands out also in the reports of the activities of the various societies and clubs at this period. Women are hardly mentioned. In the 50 year celebrations of the Club women are congratulated for running stalls to raise money [20] but they seem publicly to have no other function.\n\nMartin Basedow, German newspaper proprietor, prominent member of the German Club and former Minister of Education in the South Australian Government, expressed his views in the debate on votes for women,\n\nI am entirely opposed to women’s suffrage… There are sufficiently disturbing elements in the Parliamentary machinery now without introducing any more… It would be necessary for women, if they were given the suffrage, to read the newspapers carefully and watch keenly what was going on in the political world. How could they do all those things and attend to the house properly… If women took a lively interest in politics her (sic) sublime destiny – to marry, to study the happiness of her husband, to become a mother and the centre of a happy family would to a great extent be frustrated. [21]\n\nAnother member of the German Club, R. Homburg echoed, these sentiments and stated ‘that German women trusted their husbands to govern properly and did not wish to meddle in politics’. [22]\n\nGerman confidence grew throughout the 1860s and having gained the vote and with increasing affluence and in 1871 Germans were boosted by the unification of their country, its previous dismemberment always a source of embarrassment.\n\nAn economic depression was to follow this unification which led to the repression of the unions which in turn led many city Germans to flee their homeland. This group tended to settle in larger towns, including Adelaide. Many were socialists, others nationalists. This caused enormous tensions not only between the older conservative Germans but also between all those Germans who had arrived before 1871 and who had no emotional attachment to the new Germany at all, despite their intellectual admiration for the new country.\n\nBy the end of the 1870s with political divisions, class divisions and religious divisions the stage was set for the tragedy that was to befall the German community in the First World War. Unable to present a united front their weakness were exploited by those who had resented a non-English speaking group in the society threatening, as they saw it, the British way of life of the colony.

Krichauff in the Australische Zeitung (Australian Newspaper) in 1896. Like most Germans – the term Germans is used in the most general sense to include all those of German birth or ethnic affiliation – he considered that a clear distinction could be made between a cultural German and a political South Australian. Three years later the Boer War suggested that this assumption was untrue. World War I confirmed it. This paper attempts to trace the history of the relationship in South Australia between German-Australians and British-Australians.\n\nUnder the leadership of Pastor August Kavel, German-Lutherans had initially settled near Adelaide at a place they named Klemzig (after a village situated in the then Prussian province of Brandenburg). A great deal is made of the fact that the German-Lutherans under Pastor Kavel were refugees from religious persecution. However, under a Prussian Cabinet Order of 1834, the possible gaoling and confiscation of the goods of dissident pastors who insisted on using the ‘Old Liturgy’ had ceased, after only four years in force. [2] Nonetheless, the ban on the use of the ‘Old Liturgy’ still existed and as such it could not be used in churches because Lutheranism was a state religion whose pastors were in effect civil servants. As a result the ‘Old Lutherans’ who wanted to use the ‘Old Liturgy’ or ‘Old Agenda’ were forced to meet in private. A place to worship in peace was sought. Inquiries were made through Hamburg concerning the possibilities of emigration to Russia to join the Germans on the Volga, or the United States of America. Finally the choice fell on the new province of South Australia. The choice was no doubt expedited by the fact that a loan at an appropriate rate of interest was forthcoming for this purpose from the dissident English philanthropist George Fife Angas.\n\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia died in 1840 and an end came to the compulsory use of the new Agenda that he had insisted upon. But the migration of Germans to South Australia was not to stop even though at this stage only some 300 had made South Australia their home. For several years after the cessation of the ban on their chosen liturgy, ‘Old Lutherans’ continued to emigrate, fearing a return of the ban and possible persecution. This led to a subsequent blurring of the distinction between those who had migrated to South Australia because of the persecution and those emigrants who had [at some stage] been in Germany at the time of the persecution. However, after the initial religious migration, reasons other than the fear of religious persecution emerged to account for the continuing emigration to South Australia. The newly arrived migrants, like migrants anywhere, sent the ‘letter home’, in this case telling of the good life in the new land. This was to produce a chain migration from the eastern provinces of Germany that is Brandenburg, Mecklenburg and Silesia, to South Australia. This migration was to continue in fits and starts – primarily according to the economic conditions in both countries – until the out break of the First World War.\n\nAs a result, almost by accident – the right man being available with money at the right time, a substantial group of non-British people was introduced into a province that was planned as a replica of eighteenth century England. A place where the upper middle classes of the British Isles, unable to afford or socially aspire to the great estates and titles of England, could buy large tracts of land in a colony free from the taint of convicts. What better labourers could the new colonial gentry ask for than landless peasants imported from Germany who were grateful for the chance of work and, under the Wakefield Scheme of land settlement operating in South Australia at that time, be given the opportunity of eventually owning their own piece of land?\n\nThe worth of workers and their value to the colony in the nineteenth century was based not on the language spoken but on the fact that they worked hard and knew their place in society. Workers did not try and usurp their place in the God-given order of things by getting above their station in life and demanding better housing, wages or conditions. There was no universal franchise and the colonial gentry’s upper middle class pseudo-aristocratic values had no more in common with a German peasant than they did with British working class values. The German peasants were commented favourably upon by their social superiors for they – that is, the social superiors – were recognised as such by the German peasant farmers. ‘The male peasant raises his hat as he passes you … our labouring fellow countrymen … may well learn one or two valuable lessons’, [3] commented the Southern Australian newspaper when writing of Germans in 1839.\n\nThe available evidence suggests that the early Germans-Lutheran peasant farmers and artisans were not assailed by thoughts of nationality. Their sense of identity was related to their Lutheranism, and any other loyalties they might have had were of a parochial-geographical nature. Political loyalties were of no real interest to them. The peasant nature of the German community in South Australia continued until the late 1840s when, as a result of the revolutions and uncertain times in Germany, a very small group of middle class migrants left for Australia. While these ‘forty-eighters’ did not have the impact in Australia they had in the United States, there were enough of them in Adelaide to lament the lack of cultural life in the colonial society. They commented that ‘while they rejoiced at living in a free country, it was devilishly boring. Theatre, plays, concerts and the like were of such a standard that one begrudged even the shilling that one had to pay’. [4] This perceived lack of culture was to result in the foundation of the German Club in 1854.\n\nA further new dimension was brought by this influx of middle class migrants to the German presence in South Australia. These middle class emigrants with middle class values and aspirations, who settled predominantly in Adelaide, had a higher profile in the community than the German peasant farmers that impacted directly on the British ruling class. The aspirations of middle class Germans caused some anxiety amongst the British that was reflected in the pages of the leading newspaper of the day, the Register. In reply to German demands that they be allowed to participate in the planned 1857 responsible government to Sexagenarian Briton wrote, ‘Our German friends … (ought) to be grateful and enjoy the liberty they possess quietly’ [5] To which C. von Bertouch replied that having left their homeland for political reasons, they could hardly be expected not to fight for their rights in their new home. [6] The Register wrote, ‘We aspire to be a nation. But we cannot invite the world to join us and remain a nation of ‘Britons’ … Let us make from the natives of all countries a new political confederation of South Australians. (There is) … the necessity of abolishing in this colony all political distinctions resulting from class or race’. [7]\n\nThe German middle class echoed such sentiments. Again in the same year, 1855, at Lobethal, it was said, ‘There should be no Englishmen, Irishmen, nor Germans, but all South Australians’. [8] This in turn repeated a sentiment expressed as early as 1839 by Johannes Menge, the geologist of the South Australian Company, who had said, ‘we shall all become Australians’. [9]\n\nWhile the notion that all would become South Australians was especially appealing to the Germans, it was somewhat utopian as it flew in the face of the colonial gentry’s concept of transplanted Englishmen living in a ‘New Britannia’.\n\nIn the year responsible government was introduced into South Australia we find the first recorded evidence of a fear that was to plague middle class British-South Australians until the start of the First World War. In 1857 Rudolph Reimer, a German newspaper editor, wrote at length in the Adelaide Observer to convince the British readers of the paper that the Germans had no intention of setting up a state within a state, an ‘imperium in imperio’, to use the parlance of the day. He said, ‘and here I would forestall any possible imputation of seeking to foster a spirit of isolated nationality amongst my fellow countrymen’. [10]\n\nA little later in the same year, the Adelaide Times considered it necessary to reassure its readers. ‘We have no fear that our nationality will depart from us or that John Bull will bid adieu to South Australia because a few of his German cousins may have arrived on a permanent visit … The colony is and ever will be essentially a British land’. [11]\n\nAt that time British-Australians saw the Germans as being absorbed into British-Australian life. There were no thoughts of cultural pluralism, let alone multi-culturalism. In 1857, the Adelaide Times saw, ‘the immutable laws of nature are working to achieve this amalgamation and time … will see … (two nations) blend as one people’. [12]\n\nBut however immutable the laws of nature might be, it was considered wise to remind the readers of the Adelaide English-language newspapers that the Germans were good settlers for reasons other than their obvious hard work and pious industry. In 1858, the Adelaide Observer wrote, ‘the great argument used in favour of the Germans is that they are South Australians: they do not seek to establish an ‘imperium in imperio’ but to conform to the institutions and usages of the colony in which they live’. [13]\n\nThree years later the Germans supported these arguments in their own newspaper. The Siid Australische Zeitung of 1861 wrote, ‘There was absolutely no basis for the frequently voiced fear that the introduction … of Germans … could be damaging to English settlers or even introduce political changes which could be dangerous to the colony’. [14]\n\nOne assumes that ‘damaging to the English settlers’ meant to their economic or commercial success. From the very first days of the colony there had been criticism of the Germans because they had worked their own small plots of land and had not been content to be just day-labourers for the English landlords, the specific reason for which they had been invited to South Australia. Perhaps more importantly, the latter half of the statement suggesting the possibility of political changes points to the fear that the cultural impact of the middle class Germans could change the British way of life. We also see in the above statement the dilemma of the Germans. While not accused of setting up an ‘imperium in imperio’ they were accused, by amalgamating with the British, of introducing changes to the British way of life, a serious charge in nineteenth century British eyes. The Germans were thus caught in an impossible dilemma; damned if they did, damned if they didn’t.\n\nThe irony of this fear that the British way of life would be changed for the worse by the middle class Germans is that even while it was being expressed by some factions in society, other factions were positively embracing German ideas. In 1857 Ulrich Hübbe had been the motivating intellectual force behind the South Australian Torrens Title (Real Property) Act that was based on a similar system in force in the Hansa cities of Europe. It was later copied by the other Australian colonies. German input into the colony through parliament was to continue for the next 60 years. One has only to mention Friedrich Krichauff’s first forestry department in the Australian colonies, Carl Linger’s ‘Song of Australia’, Richard Schomburgk in the Adelaide Botanic Gardens, or Martin Basedow as the prime mover in the foundation of Roseworthy Agricultural College, as more obvious examples that the fears that society would be changed for the worse by non-British migrants were seriously misplaced.\n\nIt should be emphasised that the changes that were taking place in people’s perceptions of the world for the most part did not impinge on the German-Lutherans in the country. Modem nationalism that started to develop in a recognisable form in the second half of the nineteenth century passed them by. They had no previous experience of it in their homeland and their isolation from the British community in South Australia (both intellectually and physically) ensured that they were untouched by the changing ideas in society. As an illustration of this, it is worth noting that prior to 1914, only 14.7% of Lutherans in South Australia married outside their faith. [15] In comparison, in 1900 some 20% of Lutherans in the very German state of Wisconsin in the United States had married outside their faith. [16] In the eyes of middle class British-Australians in Adelaide, the virtue that the German-Lutherans in the country areas possessed was that of patriotism. Carl Krichauff said in the latter half of the nineteenth century, ‘True Germans … are always highly patriotic South Australians’, a statement which would appear to be highly contradictory until it is realised that a part of the Christian doctrine taught to the working classes of the day stated that ‘ complacency is specifically praised. The best Christian is the best patriot and patriotism appears to mean supporting and preserving the status quo. [17]\n\nIn this preservation of the status quo the German-Lutherans in the country areas had no difficulty. They were clearly and specifically taught by their pastors to accept their lot in life. They were grateful for their blessings and asked for nothing except God’s grace.\n\nHowever the Lutheran farmers and artisans in the country had little in common with the middle class Germans in Adelaide except for the language. This factionalism was to increase further in the 1880s with the arrival of working class urban Germans with ideas of socialism.\n\nRelations between working and middle class Germans in Adelaide reached boiling point towards the end of the 1880s when a German Association was set up in 1886 in opposition to the long-standing middle class German Club. The German Association was formed by working men from the cities of Germany, many of whom had been forced to leave that country when trade unions were banned for several years during the eighties. The feeling between the two clubs was vitriolic. The older more-established members of the German Club saw the socialist leanings of the German Association destroying the good name of the Germans that they had built up in Adelaide. They considered the German Association as a den of communism. [18]\n\nIn South Australia prior to the 1914—1918 war social class was the ultimate determining factor for acceptability and respectability, whether one was of German or British extraction was for most South Australians of little or no consequence in such an assessment. Indeed, as Smolicz has pointed out a tolerant open society leads to social and cultural monism; that is, to a conformity with the dominant group. [19] Smolicz considers that the effect of such tolerance ‘would be to encourage the cultural engulfing the members of the minority group’. [20]\n\nThis is certainly the case of the middle class Adelaide Germans whose ethnic identity and need for structural support was so diminished by 1907 that the German Club had ceased to exist. Many of its members had become so anglicised that they had joined the elitist Adelaide Club while others had disappeared into the general mainstream of British-Australian life. While some of the ex-German Club members may have possessed an ‘internal cultural pluralism’ for a time, this was certainly lost to their children who became Anglo-conformist without difficulty or guilt.\n\nHowever, two groups in the German community clung as best they could to their German traditions and, as a result to were caught up in the events of 1900—1914. The first group consisted of the working class men of Adelaide belonging to the German Association. They tended to sing folk songs, dance and keep social traditions that were non-threatening to the British. The second and more significant group from the point of ethnic relations were those of the educated, articulate, middle class who, although having done well financially in the Anglo-Australian community, still tried to keep German language, literature and intellectual customs alive. It was these people who were the leaders of the German community and the German proprietor of the Australische Zeitung, was the most important of this group. None were members of the working class German Association. All saw themselves as politically loyal South Australians.\n\nThe Boer War raised questions of citizenship that had previously lain dormant. The Australische Zeitung was particularly vehement that Australians of British descent could criticise the war with impunity while if German born Australians did the same thing, they were accused of being traitors. Basedow, the editor owner, lamented in the columns of his newspaper ‘because we, although citizens, with equal rights, are Germans (helots?) and therefore must ‘down boy’ (as to a dog)’. [21]\n\nThe paper proclaimed that German-Australians were not foreigners but were born in South Australia or were naturalised and fully identified with their new home. The bitterness felt by the Germans at this time was to be a precursor of what was to happen in the First World War. For German-Australians had an unmatched and unparalleled faith in British justice and were sure that this would triumph. [22] Their disillusionment was to be deep and lasting. However, the Boer War and the increasing antagonism between England and Germany did give rise to many articles in the Australische Zeitung with such tides as ‘On Being a German-Australian’. [23] The Germans complained that they were not accepted as equals by their British counterparts. Often, as in the United States, this feeling of rejection led to an intense feeling of identity with the old homeland, and in the case of the new, powerful and rich Germany, this identification gave a boost to the immigrants’ self esteem. Added to that was the universal belief at the time, ‘that being British subjects does not hinder us in anyway to remain bound to our German fatherland in our hearts and feelings’. [24] Consul Muecke summarised this in 1909 when he said, ‘To remain strong genuine Germans, that means to treasure the richness of the German language, the language of poets and thinkers, as well as German customs and good habits, but at the same time to remain faithful to the English king’. [25] In other words, to be culturally German but politically British.\n\nIn the increasing antagonism between Germany and England, the articulate middle class Germans in South Australia tried desperately to sit on the fence. They were convinced that the personal relations between the two monarchs would save the day. As we know, it did not, although the Australische Zeitung was perceptive enough in 1909 to point out that if there was a war, it would have nothing to do with the growing German fleet but with the growing German percentage of world trade. [26]\n\nIt would take too long here to detail the injustices suffered by the German community during World War I, but a comment by McKernan in his book The Australian People in the Great War is appropriate. ‘The German-Australians became the scapegoats from Australia’s fanatical, innocent embrace of the war’. [27]\n\nIt would be tedious to talk about imprisonment without trial or the lack of the right of appeal, of arrest by unsubstantiated statement and loss of franchise, but a few observations are in order. The Germans added to their own troubles during the war in two ways. The first was their lack of unity. They were never able to present a united front. Both the German workers and the middle classes found the War Precautions Act a convenient means of settling old scores while a mere world war did nothing to convince the two Lutheran Churches to settle their doctrinal differences. More seriously, the city Germans in particular clung to their belief in English justice and fair play in spite of their experiences during the Boer War. Just before 1914, Consul Muecke said ‘Every German who comes to Australia enjoys the same freedom and rights as an English citizen’. [28]\n\nImmediately after the outbreak of the First World War, the Chairman of the District Council of Tanunda, Adolph Schulz, proudly stated, ‘Although England was at war with Germany, they still had a perfect right to speak the German language. Those were some of the freedoms granted to them under the great and glorious British flag which stood for freedom and liberty which all so highly appreciated’. [29] In conclusion, he asked them to remain calm as under the British flag they would be protected. To transpose the words of the will known American writer, Kathleen Conzen, about the Germans in the United States to South Australia, ‘The Germans were an essential part of South Australia and they knew it’. [30] They knew how much they had contributed both economically and socially to the colony and state since their arrival. The Lutheran Church expressed the view of most Germans in stating that ‘above all, the maintenance of the German language and culture … had nothing to do with the political goals of Imperial Germany’. [31]\n\nThis calculation, the separation of culture and polities, was to prove the German Achilles heel because it was exactly this cultural inheritance of which the Germans were so proud, that was said to be the cause of the so-called German, atrocities which were so carefully manufactured and marketed by the British Ministry of War. The very thing that was supposed to protect the Germans, namely their emphasis on German culture rather than politics, proved to be their worst enemy. Protest was useless. The British world was convinced the only good German was a dead German.\n\nIn the interim, a determined effort was made to remove German culture from South Australia. Sixty-nine German place names were changed and hundreds of people, some voluntarily, some involuntarily if they were in the public service, changed their names to one sounding more British. In some cases the German side of the family was never spoken of again, which has caused some difficulties for genealogists trying to trace family trees as well as personal traumas.\n\nThe fear of the Germans in South Australia was probably as great as anywhere in the Commonwealth owing to the large percentage of Germans in the state, some 10% as opposed to 3—4% in other states. This fear, that German-Australians might prove loyal to Germany, is ironic in the face of two reports sent to Germany from South Australia by the consul general in Sydney, Richard Kiliani, in 1913, the year before the outbreak of the war. After his fact-finding tour of South Australia he wrote that the German working man was under great pressure from the Australian community to drop his German customs and language. [32] However, the amount of pressure necessary for the German language and customs to be dropped is arguable. Prior to the out-break of the Boer War in 1899, The Australische Zeitung had lamented the fact that Germans felt ‘that it was their mission in life to get rid of everything German’ [33] an accusation that had been raised as early as 1854. A similar attitude was to be found in the United States. [34] The newspaper lamented the fact that Germans felt it necessary to forget their German in order to learn English It was even said that the German consul in South Australia, H. C. E. Muecke, only spoke English at home. [35]\n\nKiliani also maintained that middle class Germans had usually lost most traces of their Germanness by the second generation, a situation again mirrored in the United States, [36] and that in the country areas the Lutheran Church was practically in a state of collapse as there were strong pressures everywhere to use the English language. These statements suggest that the British perception of German-Australians clinging strongly to everything German was quite different from how the Germans perceived the situation.\n\nThe rise of Hitler in Germany did not alienate those of British descent in the South Australian community from those of German descent, just the opposite. Even a cursory examination of the Adelaide Advertiser prior to World War II leaves no doubt as to the newspaper’s strong sympathy for the regime in Germany. For example, in 1933 just after Hitler had come to power, the Adelaide Advertiser considered Hitler good for law and order and the violence just part of a revolutionary fervour rather than an instrument of government. [37] Two years later, the paper saw Hitler as democratic and the violence due to inexperience. [38] In 1938, the Advertiser still saw the Hitler regime’s treatment of the Jews as an ‘administrative oversight’. [39] Less we be too hard on the Advertiser, let us not forget that in 1938, Robert Gordon Menzies a later long serving Australian Prime minister, praised young Germans for their unselfish service to their state. [40]\n\nThe out-break of World War II did not produce the same hatred as World War I. Those of German descent were another generation removed from the land of their forefathers and there had been practically no new German blood introduced to Australia between the wars. Equally important there was a definite distinction made between German and Nazis. Injustices were again perpetrated by a paranoid bureaucracy but not on the same scale as during the previous war. Australian-Germans were patently not interested in Hitler. German records indicate that in 1935 there were only 77 members of the Nazi Party in Australia and only 24 of those were from South Australia. [41]\n\nThe period after World War II produced another great influx of Germans and it cannot be said that they had an easy time of it particularly their children in the schools. No sooner had these new immigrants become established than the various television series about the war began with their interminable re-runs, Germans always appeared as idiots or barbarians.\n\nA different attitude began to appear with the publication of the Galbally Report in 1978, although it would be wrong to think that there had been no acceptance of German-Australians prior to this. The Schützenfest for example, which had enjoyed a great popularity in many South Australian towns prior to 1914, had been re-established in Hahndorf in 1964. But Galbally did give an intellectual, social and moral justification to the possibility, indeed advisability, of having an admixture of cultures in our society. In this, the Germans were able to play a leading part. As an ethnic group, they had been here the longest, their clubs and ethnic schools were the oldest in the state, and in terms of descendants they were the most numerous. One could also add they had suffered the most and survived as loyal, if somewhat disillusioned, Australians. From the German perspective, the road to acceptance has not always been easy, but with German the most popular foreign language in South Australian schools, the German areas of the state being prime tourist attractions and the restoration of many German place names that had been altered in 1918, it can perhaps be said that Germans and their descendants have finally regained the respectability and place they once had in the wider South Australian community.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Australische Zeitung, 24 June 1896.\n\n[2] Krummweide, H.

In the census of 1891 Lutherans numbered over 7% of the South Australian population and it is estimated that German born and their descendants constituted approximately 10% of the total population of the State.\n\nGermans were well respected in the State Parliament, holding seats with large German-Australian populations, a great many of whom were farmers. Martin Basedow, Robert Homburg, Friedrich Krichauff and Theo Scherk were all members of Parliament at some stage during the 1890s and all had a reputation for integrity and hard work. Robert Homburg was the most important member of the German community, owning a law firm and being Attorney General in two ministries from 1890—1892 and 1892—1893.\n\nThe election of 1893 raised no great issues for the German community, the vast majority of whom were connected with the land and fairly conservative in their views. The election based on the themes of ‘rest and quiet’ and ‘peace progress and prosperity’, promised little change.\n\nThe German Club, which was the centre for German literature and culture, had been founded in 1854. In the late 1880s the Club had built an imposing new building, the facade of which still stands at 89 Pirie Street, Adelaide. The more informal German Association, founded in 1886, was also flourishing. New German settlers continued to arrive in the colony throughout the 1890s, strengthening the German community.\n\nThere were Germans in all the major professions and shops with German names did excellent trade in all types of business along Rundle Street. German food shops and tobacconists were prominent. One still eats Ditter’s nuts, berliners and fritz and various types of German bread.\n\nThe German farmers who had struggled in the 1850s and 1860s to keep alive had established themselves with the good harvests of the 1870s and early 1880s, and because they had never relied on one crop but had always grown a diversity of products – following the subsistence agriculture of their European background – they were better able to survive the bad seasons of the late 1880s and 1890s.\n\nThe Germans were a respected and often admired group in the community. Their religious demeanour and frugal habits were thought to set a good example for all South Australians. The Lutheran Church ran a school system in all Lutheran areas of the State and children were taught to be both fluent in English and German. In most Lutheran schools the literary subjects tended to be taught in German while maths and science were in English. For most people of German descent who lived in the country areas of South Australia the church was the centre of both their spiritual and social lives. The shadow of the Boer War, when the Germans tended to side with the Boers, was not to intrude on this harmonious relationship between South Australians of British and German descent until the very end of the 1890s.\n\nThe Germans took a very active interest in the affairs of the colony, and the Australische Zeitung, ‘Australian Newspaper’, brought the day-to-day affairs of the colony as well as overseas news to all those who could read only German. The German community did not wish to make South Australia another Germany but they were determined that the best ideas from Germany should be introduced into the colony for the benefit of all. Among the ideas put forward in Parliament during the 1890s by ‘German’ parliamentarians was Homburg’s suggestion for the adoption of a more humane philosophy for the poor which lay behind the German poor law, while Basedow considered compulsory military training as in Prussia, took larrikins off the streets and made boys into men. Basedow also considered that the concepts behind the labour colonies of Germany could be incorporated into the village settlement schemes and German ideas of workmen’s compensation usefully studied. All the German members in the Parliament in 1890 supported payment of members because that was the practice in the German Reichstag (Parliament).\n\nThe peasant origins of the German farmers strongly influenced their representatives in Parliament. Unlike many of the wealthy pastoralists, the German farmers had come to South Australia with nothing and had made good by their own efforts. They considered people who wanted the State to help with welfare handouts were not pulling their weight. The German parliamentarians, who represented country districts with large numbers of Australian-German farmers, were against the Labor Party, which they considered would not only raise taxes, – perhaps by a dreaded land tax, – but also take away the moral fibre of the community. They believed success was due to hard work. The only German parliamentarian who was an exception to this was Theo Scherk, who represented the electorate of East Adelaide, an area where the working class Germans in Adelaide tended to live. He believed not all poor people were poor because of their own fault. On the other hand even the most conservative Germans wanted humanitarian legislation for the old and sick on compassionate grounds, and because it would keep the working class happy and contented.\n\nAgriculture was important to the South Australian economy in the 1890s and the German elected members of Parliament took good care that the interests of the man on the land – including many German farmers – were properly represented. The question of land ownership was often an area of conflict between the German representatives and many other members of Parliament. The Germans in the country areas were bona fide or genuine farmers, not speculators or absentee landlords. They worked the land they owned. Many British parliamentarians speculated in land or were city businessmen with no real interest in the land except to make money. In 1898 Homburg initiated an Agricultural Holdings Bill to try and break up some of the big land companies, but it was defeated by the absentee land-lords in parliament and others who considered it interfered with ‘free enterprise’.\n\nThe Germans consistently tried to obtain advantages for the genuine farmer as opposed to the ‘capitalist land owner’. Their attitude to the soil was that it was a gift from God, something to be nurtured and kept and passed on to one’s sons. It was not to be exploited. The Germans tried to conserve the soil, not wrest as much as they could from the land and then move on to new areas. They wanted to tax absentee land-owners heavily so these people and the land companies would be forced to sell their land to genuine farmers who worked their own land. Germans had been intimately concerned with the setting up of Roseworthy Agricultural College and the Agricultural Bureau. In 1896 Theo Scherk advocated the teaching of agricultural science at the School of Mines (the present University of South Australia) a truly revolutionary suggestion because most people at that time believed that the only way to learn to be a farmer was to be a farmer. One of the over-riding interests of all Germans was education. As we have seen the Lutheran Church ran its own system of schools in order to preserve the Lutheran religion and German language. The latter was considered most important as Luther had written in German and it was considered that a true understanding of Lutheranism and Christianity could be reached only through an understanding of that language.\n\nHowever, education was also considered important in a non-religious sense for Germans and their descendants for they were above all South Australians. They had left their homeland and given up their nationality to become South Australians and they strongly supported Federation as a means of gaining both security through the strength and greatness for Australia. They were not transplanted Englishmen who viewed this land as second best. It was to be their home, for their children and their children’s children, and they wanted the best for it, and one of the ways they saw of doing this was through a good educational system. Prussia had had a national system of education since the latter half of the nineteenth century and one of the reasons for the strength of the new Germany was seen in the 1890s to lie in her education system. So when the Germans in the South Australian Parliament spoke about this system they were listened to with great interest.\n\nThe Germans were delighted in 1891 when free education was introduced because they considered education not only the right of every citizen but necessary for the well-being of the State. In one of the issues of the 1893 election the Germans were against the return of religious instruction into school hours because they considered this would bring out denominational differences. Moral instruction had been included since 1891 and this they considered was enough to keep a sense of decency in the community, not the pushing of denominational differences.\n\nSouth Australia’s Germans saw the future of South Australia in its educational system and by 1893 the Germans were well pleased with what they saw, and resisted any change. The Germans were also unanimous on another great issue of the 1890s – the position of women. At that time most German husbands took a very patriarchal view of their families. Their attitude to women having the vote can best be summed up in their own words. On 7 September 1893, Theo Scherk told Parliament in a debate on the Adult Suffrage Bill, that he was in favour of women having the vote because ‘women would only seek to exercise their franchise and never seek a seat in Parliament’.\n\nHowever, his attitude was quite radical compared with that of some of his fellow countrymen.\n\nOn 13 June 1894, in the Legislative Council, Martin Basedow, who had been Minister of Education in 1881, said ‘I am entirely opposed to women’s suffrage’. And further:\n\nThere were sufficiently disturbing elements in Parliament now without introducing any more … It would be necessary for women, if they were given the suffrage, to read the newspapers carefully and watch keenly what was going on in the political world. How could they do all those things and attend to the house properly.\n\nOne month later he proclaimed ‘If women took an interest in politics her sublime destiny-to marry, to study the happiness of her husband, to become a mother and the centre of a happy family-would to a great extent be frustrated’.\n\nIn 1898 Basedow was worried that women were teaching boys in schools and repeated his belief that the place of women was in the home.\n\nThe Germans also feared ‘do-gooders’ and moralists who wanted to make them ‘better people’, particularly those who wanted to take away the pleasure of their ‘continental Sunday’ with its drinking and gaiety. Basedow told Parliament in 1896:\n\nThey could not make people sober and good by acts of Parliament. By over-legislation they only caused more offences and contributed to the demoralisation of society. How long would it be before they had an act to tell people what time they should get up in the morning, what time they should have breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea or at what time they should go to bed.\n\nYet despite their conservative views about women, in the election year of 1893, the German star shone brightly in South Australia. Important economically, culturally and politically, many of their ideas were widely accepted and their influence can still be seen today.\n\nSuggestions\n\nMany families of German descent have within the last ten years celebrated the centenary of their arrival in Australia. Some families have over 2,000 descendants. Are any members of the class related to or do they know about a family? Most families have published centenary books. If possible study one of these looking for reasons for migration and the type of work undertaken by the early settlers. German migrants were accepted into the very highest positions of government in the nineteenth century. Are non-British settlers accepted as readily today? Think of some other foods that a delicatessen – German for specialty foods – sells that are German in origin. What would you consider some of the most important contributions of the nineteenth century German settlers to South Australia?\n\nReprinted from South Australia in the 1890s, Constitutional Museum, Adelaide 1983.\n\nA Dark Chapter in South Australia’s History\n\nAtrocities during wartime are always committed by the ‘other side’, or so we are led to believe. But in World War I, Torrens Island, in the Port River, was the site of a concentration camp which earned a notorious reputation for brutality. The story of that camp has been suppressed by the authorities for many years. Now the chance discovery by Adelaide historian Dr Ian Harmstorf of documents in the Barr-Smith Library has revealed the shocking truth about Torrens Island. Much of the detail for this article comes from papers left to the library by the former principal of Adelaide Teachers College, Dr. A. B. Schulz, who died in the 1950s.\n\nShow/hide full article\n\nTorrens Island is an inhospitable place at the best of times. In autumn and winter cold winds whip in off the sea and fogs drift across its bleak, flat landscape. That this lonely mangrove island is a landmark is due only to the chimneys of the massive power station which pumps life-giving electricity into Adelaide’s veins. There is nothing there now to tell us or succeeding generations of the notorious concentration camp which once stood on Torrens Island. Within its barbed wire fences was written one of the most shameful chapters in Australian history.\n\nThe camp on Torrens Island flourished for about 10 months – between October 1914 and August 1915 – when about 300 Germans were interned following the outbreak of World War I. Most of the imprisoned men were civilians, not prisoners of war taken in battle, and they included many who were born on Australian soil in traditional areas of German settlement such as the Barossa Valley. They were arrested, often at gunpoint in their homes or at work, and imprisoned without trial and without knowing what offence they were supposed to have committed under regulation 56A of the War Precautions Regulations.\n\nUnder a headline ‘Torrid Tales of Torrens Island’, a newspaper report of 1919 described it as ‘the camp which has the worst reputation in this country among those who are qualified to know’.\n\nThe report, from the Adelaide weekly newspaper Truth of 31 May, listed atrocities committed against internees, including flogging, shooting and bayoneting by guards. Truth long ago received fairly substantial reports about what had taken place at Torrens Island, but we were not allowed to publish them at the time, owing to the censorship’, says the article.\n\n‘Things became so bad in the internment camp at Torrens Island that, in the end, the prisoners had to be moved to New South Wales on 17 August, 1915.’\n\nTruth described an incident in which two internees were flogged with the cat-of-nine-tails for half an hour for attempting to escape. The flogging was ordered by Capt. Hawkes, an officer who became notorious for his brutality against the prisoners and whom, Truth reported, was subsequently reduced to the ranks.\n\nThe two men – a German and a Swede – were stripped and tied to a tree outside the compound for the flogging.\n\n‘Their piteous cries could be heard from the camp’, Truth reported. ‘They were brought back bleeding profusely. One man was beaten so badly he could not walk for four days.’\n\nPhotographs were taken of the men’s injuries and copies were smuggled out of the camp, with details of the atrocities. The information reached Germany and led to the German Government threatening reprisals against Australian prisoners of war unless conditions on Torrens Island were improved. The prisoners made their own protest at the inhuman treatment in an open letter to the camp commandant, a Major Logan. The letter was printed in a primitive newspaper, Der Kamerad, which the internees somehow managed to publish weekly in the camp. It read:\n\n‘Two prisoners were publicly and thoroughly whipped naked. We maintain this punishment is illegal and undignified. We appeal to the Major’s sense of justice, and request an inquiry.\n\nThat edition of Der Kamerad, dated 26 June 1915, was the third and last newspaper the internees published. The guards confiscated and destroyed all copies they could find. However, an internee, Mr. O. Burth, saved copies, and after the war presented them to the State Archives, along with photographs taken in the camp.\n\nAccording to Truth, the internees at Torrens Island were treated well until Major Hawkes came there at the beginning of 1915. The guards used their bayonets freely on the internees, and a favourite punishment for offenders was to force-march them around the camp perimeter. Those who did not move fast enough for the guard were prodded with a bayonet.\n\nTruth reported that more than 25 of the prisoners had bayonet wounds, including one man who had seven wounds and another who had a bayonet thrust right through his leg by an over-zealous guard. In one incident a group of prisoners who had annoyed their captors by making a noise were driven at bayonet point over barbed wire by the guards. Many suffered badly lacerated legs and a number received bayonet wounds.\n\nEven worse was the punishment for 36 prisoners who had been caught taking firewood without permission. They were herded into a small barbed wire compound for two weeks. There was no shelter from the cold, windy weather and not enough room for them all to lie down to sleep at once. They were given one hot meal every three days.\n\nThe Truth report of 1919 also cites Captain Hawkes as having drawn his revolver and fired at random into the compound after an internee had called out to him for a cigarette. The bullet hit a prisoner in the leg and the man spent three weeks in hospital recovering from his injury. The internees had to endure a further two months of ill-treatment after the brutal flogging incident until the Defence Department closed Torrens Island and moved prisoners by train to camps at Liverpool and Berrima, in New South Wales.\n\nAlthough conditions in the N.S.W. camps were considered generally better than the tent hell of Torrens Island, the ordeal of South Australia’s interned Germans was to continue for another four years.\n\nLetters and descriptions written by S.A. and Queensland internees of German descent make heart-breaking reading. The internees at Liverpool camp formed the Association of Interned Australian-born Subjects and in November 1916, a petition was sent by them to the Defence Minister, protesting at the injustice of their internment without trial and denying that they had committed acts or spoken words of disloyalty. The petition demanded that definite charges be laid against them, as was their right as British subjects. It is significant that they claimed their internment was the result of personal animus or business jealousy.\n\nExamples of this personal animosity and business jealousy can be read in the Tanunda Police Station correspondence book for 1916/1917. It is full of letters alleging disloyal conduct by German-speaking members of the community, written by local busy-bodies whose gossip in peacetime would normally have been ignored.\n\nA typical case is that of a German school teacher named Witt, who was named by an informant for sabotaging the war effort by failing to distribute a sufficient number of tickets for a Red Cross concert. Witt distributed three dozen tickets for the concert, but another nine dozen were found in his home. His explanation was that he had been too busy to distribute them. The official conclusion drawn was that he was a saboteur.\n\nThe Tummel family of Greenock suffered greatly from local amateur ‘spies’. Although two of their relatives were serving in the British Army, one as a lieutenant, information laid against them led to three male members of the family being interned in Australia.\n\nA letter from the interned at Liverpool to the Defence Minister, reveals the personal agony and frustration of the men put behind wire because of gossip and war hysteria: ‘We, who are mostly from the States of South Australia and Queensland, are denied the privilege of seeing our families owing to distance and expenditure, and our allowance for correspondence is so scanty that an unscaleable wall of separation divides us from those who are dear to us…’\n\nIn his reply, the Acting Secretary at the Defence Department, Mr T. Trumble, described their letter as ‘purporting to be written by Australian-born subjects’, and curtly informed them that ‘your internment is in accordance with the law.’ On 31 October 1917, Trumble said the Cabinet had reviewed the question of Australian-born internees and had decided that they should remain interned. It is not expedient in the public interest to reveal the evidence against you, he told them.\n\nA ‘flutter of hope’ came to the internees from Prime Minister Billy Hughes in October 1917, when he said in a speech at Maldon, Victoria:\n\n‘There is only one hope for the community-that there should be justice to all men, irrespective of their situation. But it was not until January 1918 that the Australian-born internees were acknowledged as being Australian citizens by the Secretary of Home and Territories, Mr Atlee Hunt.\n\nThe dependants of those internees whose businesses were closed were forced to throw themselves on the authorities – for support. Wives like Ottilie Goers of Tanunda, who wrote to the General Staff officer at Keswick Barracks:\n\n‘Will you please give me a weekly allowance of ten shillings for my daughter and me, since by husband was sent to Liverpool in 22 May 1916. We have tried to continue in our home, as my husband’s wages were stopped once he was taken away from us. I am nearly 50 years of age and cannot earn anything.’\n\n‘Please, sir, give me back my dear husband and my daughter’s father. He will work for himself and for us and we need no help.’\n\nAmong the papers of the late Dr Schulz is this testimony from an anonymous internee at Liverpool who wrote of the imprisoned Germans:\n\n‘With complete disregard for their personal, family or business interests, they have been literally torn from their homes and families, escorted by guards with fixed bayonets through public streets, imprisoned in police cells and in military clinks intermingled with drunken soldiers, exposed to the jeers and taunts of unthinking crowds.’\n\n‘Some of their fathers and grandfathers were expressly invited by the agents of the different Australian Governments to make their homes in Australia and they did so in full confidence, never dreaming that their children would be treated in such a fashion.’\n\nBy August 1918, internees of the Naturalised British Subjects Association at Holsworthy Camp, N.S.W., were in a state of utter despair, as the following letter to the Minister of Defence illustrated:\n\n‘The mental torture and resulting frailty of physical health is so pronounced in the case of those who are unfortunate enough to have been interned for any lengthy period, that the time has arrived when an urgent appeal on the grounds of humanity must be made for the consideration of our cases with some sense of fair play and justice. All we ask is a civil trial.’\n\nOf all the letters, documents, cuttings and papers in the late Dr Schulz’s possession, the following statement by an internee contains the saddest and most devastating comment on Torrens Island and the N.S.W. camps…\n\n‘That such occurrences are possible in the twentieth century in such an advanced democracy as that of Australia seems hardly credible. But it is so, and there is being registered in Australian history a chapter which all real Australians will some day heartily wish could be expunged.’\n\nThe tragic irony about this statement is that until the discovery of these papers in the Barr-Smith Library officialdom had almost managed to expunge this shameful chapter from our history. At the end of the war, all material relating to Torrens Island was called in by the military authorities to Melbourne. In 1992 more information was discovered in the Mitchell Library in Sydney which verified the reports which appeared in the article above. The information in the above article was based primarily on data found in the Barr-Smith Library of the University of Adelaide.\n\nThe Mitchell Library papers consist of a series of photos of both the Liverpool N.S.W. camp and the Torrens Island camp in South Australia. As well as numerous letters from inmates of both camps complaining about the conditions perhaps the most interesting discovery was of a diary kept by prisoner, Bungardy. Bungardy describes how on Torrens Island prisoners who collected wood for fires were shot at like rabbits for the amusement of the guards. The shooting was not meant to kill, just be very close and frighten the prisoners or drive them in a particularly direction. The shootings would be a complete surprise. The whippings are also described again in detail. It is interesting to note that one of those whipped was Swedish, although how he came to be in Torrens Island is not explained.\n\nThe contrast between the unforgiving attitude of the military-civil authorities and the more tolerant attitude of ordinary Australians is also brought out in Bungardy’s diary. Having escaped from the Liverpool camp he made his way to Sydney where he met with a soldier who was absent without leave, A. W. L. He may even have deserted. Bungardy took the soldier’s uniform and the soldier Bungardy’s clothes. Dressed as an Australian soldier Bungardy then enjoyed several months of freedom until by sheer chance he was recognised by a policeman in a post office while he was posting a letter to his mother in another part of Australia. The policeman had known him in Broken Hill before the war and reluctantly had to arrest Bungardy.\n\nReprinted from the Sunday Mail, 2 July 1979 (with Additions).\n\nThe experience of South Australia’s Germans during World War II, although un­pleasant, was in most cases not as traumatic as during the Great War of 1914—1918. The reason for this was twofold. First, those of German descent, and these constitute the vast majority in the catch-all phrase ‘South Australia’s Germans’, were another generation removed from the land of their forefathers. This together with the disruption suffered to South Australian German cultural and linguistic traditions during the First World War had severely weakened ties to the old homeland. Perhaps the immediate threat to the British-Australians also appeared less. German-born in South Australia had dropped from 2% of the population in 1911 to 0.4% in 1933. Numerically from almost 5,000 to just over 2,000 and one can safely assume, given the lack of German migration between the wars, considerably aged. The number of Lutherans had remained virtually constant at 26,000—27,000, but as a percentage of the total South Australian population had dropped from 6.8% in 1911 to 4.5% in 1933, although it is improbable that the actual number of German descendants, as opposed to Lutherans, would have shown such a dramatic decline as the Lutheran figures suggest.\n\nSecond, the press in particular had long made it a practice of distinguishing between the Nazi administration of Germany and the German people. As a result slogans popular in the First World War such as ‘the only good German is a dead German’, or images of the ‘dreaded Hun’, dripping the blood of innocent children from his salivating heavy jowls, were not in vogue.\n\nPresent day historical writings suggest that by the end of World War I in 1918 the vitriolic hatred of all things German in Australia had burnt itself out in most quarters. [1] The rehabilitation of the Germans in South Australia had advanced by 1935 – in preparation for the state centenary in 1936 – to the stage where the names of Ambleside, Gaza and Tweedvale were returned to their old names of Hahndorf, Klemzig and Lobethal, although the name changes had been mooted as early as 1928. [2] But even these few name changes, 3 out of the 69 changed in 1918, were not achieved without some opposition, as the correspondence columns of contemporary newspapers clearly show. [3]\n\nIn a 1971 Flinders University thesis M. S. Regan looked at ‘Australian Perceptions of Nazism 1933—1939’ examining the attitudes towards Nazism by various Australian newspapers, including the Advertiser. The point is made very clearly that Australians, including South Australians, had a most distorted view of Nazism. Nazism was examined by observers who were philosophically liberal and saw everything from that perspective. The Advertiser in 1933 considered Hitler as good for law and order [4] and the violence of the regime was seen as being part of a revolutionary fervour rather than an instrument of government. [5] Two years later, in 1935, the Advertiser saw Hitler as operating within a democratic framework, although the violence was then attributed to inexperience. [6] Yet in apparent contradiction to the above the Advertiser as early as 1933 differentiated between the German Government and the German people. [7] Although the Advertiser viewed the annexation of Austria as immoral, [8] the newspaper failed to understand that war was an instrument of Nazi policy. It was firmly believed that if the German people knew all the facts then Hitler would be forced to change his policies. [9] In the same year, 1938, the Advertiser was still excusing the German Government’s treatment of the Jews as an ‘administrative oversight’. [10]\n\nSimilarly, at government level there was much praise of Germany. One need only mention the well-known statement by Robert Gordon Menzies in the Australian Parliament when in a laudatory address on Germany, he commented\n\n‘There is a good deal of really spiritual quality in the willingness of young Germans to devote themselves to the service and well-being of the state.’ [11]\n\nThus the years of Fascism in Germany had no adverse ramifications for the Germans in South Australia. Until virtually the eve of the war Hitler was perceived as a reasonable personality who aired just grievances on behalf of his nation. [12] The Advertiser even explained away his more obvious excesses with the argument that at times he was manipulated by others. [13] South Australians of German descent were able to bask in the knowledge as well as reflected glory that in the new Germany under Hitler, law and order had been restored and communist insurgents crushed. Germany had once again become ‘respectable’, at least in the eyes of conservative western governments.\n\nThe declaration of war against Germany produced in the Adelaide papers neither tirades against Germany nor warnings about rhe dangers of Germans in our, that is South Australia’s, midst. On 4 September 1939 the Advertiser stated in its editorial that ‘each democratic nation must decide for itself how it will meet the Nazi challenge’. [14] On 13 September 1939 the Advertiser editorial stated ‘the enemies of the threatened world plague of Hitlerism must press on to victory’. [15] Two days later the newspaper wrote about the evils that were being perpetrated in the name of the German people by the Hitler administration. [16] Clearly a difference was made between the German people and the Nazi administration. Generally in South Australia in World War II, unlike World War I, to have a German name did not immediately make one’ s patriotism suspect or brand one as a potential traitor.\n\nPerhaps the best illustration of this is the number of South Australians with German names who anglicised their names. In World War I, according to a survey undertaken by Andrew Peake and published in the South Australia Genealogist, [17] 179 people changed their name by deed pole from German to Anglo-Celtic. Included are forbears of the present (1987) State Governor who changed their name from Kollosche to Dunstan. [18] Added to these were others whose names do not appear in any lists, particularly those who just dropped one letter of the alphabet, n, from the double n in mann. Two instances must suffice, Wallman and Homan, but many more can be found on a perusal of the Adelaide telephone directory. A search of the South Australian Government Gazette reveals that only three people changed their German surnames in South Australia in World War II: one in 1941, another in 1943 and the last in 1945, although another dropped an ‘n’ from the name Hartmann. [19]\n\nIn contrast to the years of World War I those of German descent in South Australia rate barely a mention in the Stat Parliament. Early in I940 Herbert Michael, the Member for Light, in the Address in Reply debate had depreciated statements in the press which reflected on the loyalty of the descendants of Germans who had come to South Australia in the last century. He particularly defended the Lutheran Church against what he considered the unfair charges that had been made against it. [20] Again in the Address in Reply the member for Gawler, Duncan, praised the contribution of those of German descent:\n\n‘In the Boer War we had examples of pro-German attitudes, in the Great War we had sporadic outbursts of national pride in the Fatherland, but today I see a vast difference and a complete change… The outlook is precisely that of over a century ago. Lovers of Luther cannot and will not subscribe to a shattering of those truths such has been embarked upon by Hitler and his satellites.’ [21]\n\nThere were no further statements about South Australians of German descent for over a year until 8 October 1941, when the member for Prospect, Mr Whittle, introduced the second reading of the Nomenclature Bill into the House to change the name of Klemzig back to Gaza. [22] It was a private member’s Bill and Whittle intimated during his speech that as such and without government support it was almost certainly doomed to failure. However he considered it his duty to introduce the Bill on behalf of 40 petitioners in his electorate. His plea to members to consider changing the name Klemzig to Gaza was less than convincing in that he spent much of his time praising the pioneering efforts of the early German settlers.\n\n‘There is no suggestion in my remarks or any desire on the part of the people of Klemzig to do other than honour to the German people who have played such a remarkable part in the development of South Australia. I have already commended them as an inspiration to many another settlers.’ [23]\n\nWhittle had prefaced these remarks earlier by giving a short history of Klemzig in which he said of the early settlers:\n\n‘Their industry and perseverance were an inspiration to others. Within a very short period they were supplying Adelaide with much needed and appreciated vegetables, milk and butter.’ [24]\n\nA remarkable testimonial from a man who ostensibly wanted the name, Klemzig, a name commemorating the early German settlers, removed from the map. There were no other speakers. The Bill lapsed. The difference in tone and attitude when contrasted with the vitriolic debate during the Nomenclature Bill of 1917 is therefore dramatic. Another difference was that no Lutheran churches were burnt down in South Australia and Lutheran Schools were not closed as in World War I.\n\nBut if the State Government of South Australia had learned to live with those of German descent as part of the community in a time of war then the Federal Government had not. On 9 September 1939 the National Security Bill became law. This Act was substantially the same as the War Precautions Act of World War I which gave the Government of the day practically unlimited executive powers. As John Curtin pointed out in the debate on the Bill it ‘asks Parliament to transfer to the Executive the whole of the law making authority over its activities while the war is on’. [25]\n\nThe dangers inherent in the Act were clearly understood. [26] Menzies spoke of its dangers when administered by the ‘rigid official mind’ [27] and Rosevear warned of the excesses which had happened under the War Precautions Act of 1914—1918. [28] However Menzies assured the nation that there would be ‘as little interference with individual rights as is consistent with national safety.’ [29]\n\nDespite these fine words the miscarriages of justice, although perhaps not as many as in the previous war, were just as hurtful and damaging to the individuals concerned, and again demonstrates, as in World War I, the lack of civil rights and concepts of common justice which seem to operate in Australia in times of perceived crisis.\n\nPeople who were thought to have offended under one of the multiple regulations that had been promulgated under the National Security Act had no redress through normal legal channels. Until 1941 there was not even the right of appeal. The accused were taken before a tribunal and interrogated. The nature of these interrogations is well illustrated by a verbatim report of one such interrogation that appeared in the Commonwealth Parliamentary debates in 1946 and was explained by Dr H. V. Evatt. The accused asked,\n\n‘I should like to know what the case is against me’, to which me Chairman replied, ‘I am not allowed to say what it is’.\n\nEvatt concluded ‘Reading the documents one has a feeling of utter despair at the lack of not only humanity but also common sense’. [30]\n\nAt their best the tribunals had an Alice in Wonderland quality about them; at their worst they could have come straight from Kafka. As Archie Cameron pointed out in the Commonwealth Parliament in the same year, Australian born citizens had been held for four to five years without any charge being brought against them. [31]\n\nThere is no disputing the fact that genuine Nazi sympathisers were interned during the war, [32] and that there were such people is not surprising given the generally favourable political climate towards Nazism prior to the war. But the way in which the Act was enforced, was, as in the First World War, most arbitrary. Generally there was no proper investigation and frequently ‘suspects’ were brought to the notice of the military or police by anonymous letters. As in the previous war this proved an ideal method in which to settle old scores. Most accusations brought against an accused were therefore on hearsay and the burden of proving his or her innocence lay on the shoulders of the accused, again quite contrary to normal notions of British justice, doubly so when in most cases the nature of the accusation was unknown.\n\nA few examples must suffice. Because of their prominent position and relative wealth in the South Australian society, as well as their leading position in the South Australian German community, the Homburg family was a target of much jealousy. Seemingly because of his connections Fritz Homburg at least was allowed to know the nature of the charges brought against him. [33] He was also accused of making disloyal statements in a Tanunda hotel on a certain date. He was able to show that he was in Adelaide on that date. He was accused of inviting the German adventurer Count Felix von Luckner to Tanunda and wining and dining him at the council’s expense. Incredibly he was able to argue that he had been asked to invite von Luckner by one of the members of the tribunal sitting in front of him and that he, Homburg, had refused the latter’s request that the Tanunda Council bear the expenses. [34] He was acquitted, but we do gain some indication of the almost unbelievable lack of preparation and the questionable quality of the tribunals.\n\nFritz’s relative, Hermann Homburg was not so lucky. Speaking to him in 1959 I had the strong impression that even then he did not know who had brought the accusations of disloyalty against him. Information that has become available since indicates that the accusations were levelled by a distant female relative with a grudge who had reported on conversations held at family gatherings. [35] The nature of his crime was that he had made statements such as ‘Not everything is bad in Germany’. The real nature of his crime however was that he was arguably the leading South Australian of German descent. Homburg assured me that the interrogating military officer was most polite and that they virtually had played word games with each other until the officer finally had said, ‘Well, Mr Homburg with a man in your position we have to do something about you’. [36]\n\nAfter being put under house arrest in Victoria for some 18 months-at his own expense-he was allowed to return to South Australia. [37]\n\nThe case of South Australian born J. F. W. Schulz also bears examining. His case has been examined in some detail in a thesis called fittingly ‘Guilty till Proven Innocent’ by Elizabeth Schulz at the Salisbury campus of the South Australian College of Advanced Education. She indicates that Schulz was guilty by association. He knew Dr Johannes Becker socially and Becker was one of the leading Nazis in Australia. Schulz also was involved in the arrangements with von Luckner, whom Australian security considered was sent here as a subversive element. Specific charges were never brought against Schulz. Nor could he clear his name after the war. [38]\n\nAlso of interest is the case of Pastor Riedel. A fervent anti-mason, he had written books against masonry in the 1930s. Again no charges were brought against him and he found himself in Loveday Internment Camp without really knowing why. [39] The consensus of opinion both then and now is that he had in the provincial Adelaide of the time offended too many people with his anti-masonic crusade and the war gave the injured parties a chance to settle old scores, especially when among those who considered themselves insulted and attacked was a high ranking army officer. [40]\n\nMany other South Australians of German descent had their houses searched by the military looking for incriminating evidence. [41] The pattern was invariably similar. The army would arrive unexpectedly having been given a ‘tip-off’ and the house was searched from top to bottom with little care paid to the contents. The late Dr Max Lohe, one-time President of the Lutheran Church of Australia, told me that he did not know whether to laugh or cry when the military arrived at his family home. His father’s library was examined but only by looking at the wording on the spines of the books. Such was the ignorance of the army officers conducting the search that translations of books by Goethe were confiscated as being seditious literature, while books not unfavourable to Germany in the 1930s were ignored because of their innocuous titles. [42]\n\nHowever it cannot be concluded that all those in the transit camps at Keswick, and Wayville or interned in Tatura, Victoria, or Loveday near Barmera in South Australia, were innocent. Of the just under 100 South Australians interned in Tatura in 1940—1941 several were known Nazis including names well known to the South Australian public today in media, political and medical circles. [43] It is perhaps best to leave this chapter closed as the sins of the fathers should not be visited upon the sons. Kaukas indicates that most Australians of German descent were interned in either Loveday or Tatura. He writes that at the height of the war in November 1942 there were 4,814 people interned at Loveday of which 678 were German and of these 196 were what he terms local Germans-born in Australia. At Tatura there were at the same date 3,246 internees of which 1,916 were Germans, 839 being local. [44]\n\nThe extent of the Nazi influence in South Australia prior to Price writing in German Settlers in South Australia just after the war suggest that the efforts to subvert South Australian Germans to the Nazism were extensive and that over one thousand fell prey to the Nazi cause. [45] However he recognises that his numbers are but estimates based on Lutheran figures. In the light of our present day knowledge of multi-culturalism we are able to make a clearer distinction, which he could not, between cultural and political loyalties, which in tum suggests that Price’s figures might be inflated.\n\nBut the Nazi policy of Kulturpolitik – cultural politics – did try to blur the distinctions between culture and politics. By 1936—1937 the leadership of the South Australian German Association had been taken over by Nazis, although this cannot be taken to mean that every member of the Association was a Nazi. Nevertheless the political views held by the Association were so obvious that many members failed to renew their membership. [46] Total membership of the Association was about 400. [47] The S.A. German Historical Society (which set about but never succeeded in writing a book on the contribution made by those of German descent in South Australia) and the German Australian Centenary Committee (which was responsible for the Carl Linger memorial in the West Terrace Cemetery and the memorial at the Klemzig Cemetery), also had active Nazis among their members, but neither could be classified as either Nazi or a Nazi front organisations. [48]\n\nGerman Foreign Office records show that in 1934 there was in Tanunda a Hitlerbund, a Hitler Club, which had as its goal ‘togetherness’ with Germany. [49] The Bund des Deutschtums in Australien (The Group for German language and customs in Australia), in 1935 had as its aim the furthering among German descendants of German customs, manners, language and culture. [50] The South Australian German Association was associated with this group, which could best be described as a front organisation. [51] There was also a society for further study which had 35 members in South Australia. [52] In 1935 the last year for which figures from German Foreign Office files are available there were 77 members of the Nazi Party in the whole of Australia, [53] 0 of which 12 were in Tanunda which was designated as a Stützpunkt – support point – and a further 12 in Adelaide. [54] The well known Dr Johannes Becker was the leader at this time for the whole of Australia as well as for Adelaide. By 1938 the leadership of the groups had been taken over by the consuls. [55] If official members of the Nazi Party are taken as a guide then the threat to South Australia from within does not appear to have been significant.\n\nIn conclusion it is possible to say that although those arrested were not subjected to brutality or mistreatment, the negation of common justice possible under the regulations of the National Security Act ensured that miscarriages of justice occurred that should not have occurred in a democratic society. Despite the fact that there was no sweeping condemnation of Germans or their descendants the long held fear in South Australia of an ‘imperium in imperio’, a state within a state, [56] helped foster a denial of natural justice. In World War II South Australians of German descent again perceived themselves to be betrayed by the very concepts of British justice which in the nineteenth century had been a reason for their migration and with which they had been so proud to be associated at that time.

He said, speaking of minority groups in South Australia, that South Australia’s largest minority group, the Germans, had been here for so long that few of them spoke German. The question arises when do you cease to be a German and when do you become an Australian? The people of this large minority group had, in 1975, been here for 137 years, so it is one of the dilemmas of the South Australian German that if you are a Lutheran, or more particularly, have an obvious German name, you may still be looked on as not really Australian. Hence, because of a certain characteristic, for example your name, some individuals are persuaded by the attitude of society to look upon themselves as German, even though they may not see themselves as such, and of course this can cause an identity crisis.\n\nThe Germans who arrived here in 1838 came because they were being persecuted for their religion in their home-land in East Germany. This homeland was so far east that it is now in Poland, and it became very stylish during World War II to call yourself a Pole if you had a name for example like Leditschke, as many east German names can sound some-what Polish. In Germany in 1838, but dating from an earlier period, there was a liturgy – that is a form of church service – designated by the King to be used in Churches throughout the country for he wanted a united church within his realm. It was considered at that time that one nation should have one church. The ‘Old Lutherans’ objected to the form of service prescribed by the King. They had three possibilities to escape the King’s ruling. They could go to the USA, they could go to Russia, or they could go to South Australia, a possibility that popped up very late in the piece as the third alternative.\n\nWe all know about the millions of Germans who went to the United States and some of the so called ‘Old Lutherans’ went there also. However, through connections in Hamburg, George Fife Angus, one of the founding fathers of South Australia, and himself a Baptist and dissenter, came to know of these dissenters in Germany and money was found for some ‘Old Lutherans’ to migrate to South Australia. That began a chain migration to South Australia. But one of the little known aspects of the German migration to this state is that of the 18,000 Germans who came to South Australia until 1900, only 517 left Germany during the time of persecution and a"
