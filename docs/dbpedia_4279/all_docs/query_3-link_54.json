Dede of Altona.\n\nThe Zebra departed Altona on Sunday Aug 12th 1838 and arrived Holdfast Bay, SA on Friday Dec 28th, 1838 under the command of Dirk Meinerts Hahn. She departed 12 Feb 1839 for Batavia.\n\nContents * Brief Description * Passenger List * Newspaper Reports * References * Links * Ship Index Passenger List\n\nThe Zebra's voyage is described in David Schubert's Kavels Prople [1] (pp 160-169). The captains own account of the voyage has also been published as Emigrants to Hahndorf - A Remarkable Voyage [2].\n\nNo official passenger list for the Zebra exists. The following list is based on that which appears in Kavels People [1] with a few additions. It is stated that 198 passengers embarked and that there were 11 deaths on the voyage meaning that 187 arrived in South Australia [1]. There are 201 steerage passengers in the following list including thirteen considered as doubtful by Schubert (marked with *).\n\nMany of the emigrants from the Zebra settled in Hahndorf, which was named after the captain of the Zebra.\n\nSLSA: B7477\n\nCaptain Dirk Meinerts Hahn ca 1836\n\nPhoto courtesy of the State Library of South Australia\n\nCaptain\n\nHAHN Dirk Meinerts\n\nCrew (16)\n\nShip's Surgeon\n\nMATHEISON Dr, from Schleswig\n\nCabin Passenger\n\nKOOK Hermann Friedrich , agriculturalist/surveyor, from Lï¿½beck\n\nSteerage passengers (198 - 11 deaths on voyage)\n\nBARTEL[6]\n\nChristian from Mï¿½stchen, Brandenburg Anna Rosina nee LIEBELT\n\nBARTEL[1,6] Christian, thresher-gardener (44, son of Christian) from Mï¿½stchen, Brandenburg Maria Elisabeth (nee KIRSCHKE) (41) .....Johanne Luise (21) .....Anna Maria (16) .....Dorothea Elisabeth (12) .....Johanne Karoline (6) BARTEL[1,6] Gottlob, cottager (41, son of Christian) from Mï¿½stchen, Brandenburg\n\nElisabeth nee BINDER (40) .....Johann Wilhelm (19) .....Maria Elisabeth (14) .....Johann Gottfried (8) .....Johann Gottlob (4) .....Johann Christoph (9 months).

DECEMBER 29. 1838.\n\nTHE Prince George and Glenalvon from London - the Zebra from Altona - the Parland from Sydney - and the Socrates from Launceston, arrived yesterday, and the Black Joke, from Port Phillip, on the 27th. There are now about twenty vessels in the roads and harbour. The latest advices from London are up to the 4th September. There is no intelligence of importance ; but the late hour at which we received our papers prevents a summary till our next. The demand for land, we rejoice to say, continues to increase. Nearly 9000 acres have been lately sold; and a party of noblemen and gentlemen are said to have formed an association for the purpose of purchasing land in South Australia. The Dukes of Sutherland and Richmond are at the head of this undertaking. The New Judge.-ï¿½Henry Cooper, Esq., Barrister, has been appointed Chief Justice of the Province of South Australia. His Honor is expected to arrive early in February.\n\nSaturday, 5 January, 1839\n\nDecember 28 The ZEBRA, 344 tons, Haber, master, from Albona, with 189 German emigrants:ï¿½100 barrels pork, 100 barrels flour, 2 boxes boots and shoes, 18 water casks, 40,924 bricks.\n\nSaturday, 19 January, 1839\n\nSETTLEMENT AT MOUNT BARKER.\n\nWHEN we had the pleasure to announce in our last that Mr. Hampden Dutton, Mr. Macfarlane, Mr. Moore, and some other gentlemen from Sydney, had been so struck with the surpassing fertility of the Mount Barker district when compared to the richest tracts of New South Wales, that although they had arrived in the province without the slightest, intention of buying land or becoming settlers, had at once demanded a special survey of 15,000 acres, and intimated their resolution to send numerous herds and flocks and to become themselves denizens of South Australia, we did not then expect so soon afterwards to have another pleasing illustration of what men of capital, enterprise, and, we may add, sound judgment, are capable of effecting in a short space of time. Mr. Dutton and his friends have not been contented with merely purchasing the landï¿½they have determined to people it; and the favorable opportunity afforded by the recent arrival of numerous German emigrants has not been overlooked. The whole body of Germans, in number one hundred and ninety, brought by the Zebra, from Hamburg, are to proceed directly from the ship to Mount Barker, and a township is forthwith to be established there under the name, we believe, of \" Kanatsdorf.\" The men are chiefly mechanics, shepherds, bricklayers, masons, &c, and form, in fact, the whole materiel for a community. With a liberality which we cannot sufficiently applaud and admire, these poor people are to be put in possession of certain allotments of ground, rent free for the first twelve months; to be supplied gratis with rations and seeds till their crops are gathered in; each family is to have the free use of at least one dairy cow, and the men are to be paid the ordinary rate of wages when employed. A church and school-house are to built, and an endowment made for a clergyman. Mr. Dutton has given ï¿½20 and Mr. Macfarlane ï¿½10 towards the building of the church; and several other gentlemen have already contributed very liberally. Here, then, without professions or the talk of a couple of years, are results as creditable to the gentlemen immediately interested as they are important to the province. We sincerely trust the parties will meet the reward which their judicious and prompt benevolence so fully merits.\n\nThe South Australian (Adelaide, SA)\n\nSaturday, 29 December, 1838\n\nADELAIDE SHIPPING REPORT.\n\nARRIVALS\n\nDEC. 28 .- Zebra, from Hambro', with Emigrants.\n\nWednesday, 23rd January, 1839\n\nTHE ZEBRA\n\nIt affords us the most sincere pleasure to be enabled to publish the following gratifying testimony of the care and attention of Capt. Hahn, of the ship Zebra, recently from Hambro' to this colony. So much of the comfort and happiness of passengers depends upon the manner in which the captains of emigrant ships discharge their important duties, that no opportunity should be lost in testifying the approbation of the colonists wherever so fitting an occasion shall arise. To the Captain of the Prince George and Capt. Hahn of the Zebra, (both with emigrants from Germany) great praise is due for their uniform kindness and attention to those committed to their care, and we would suggest the propriety of the Commissioners granting a premium to those Captains who bring out emigrants and passengers with safety, and whose conduct has been so worthy of commendation.\n\nCity of Adelaide, South Australia\n\n19th January, 1839.\n\nDEAR SIR.-Taking a lively interest in the subject of Emigration to the South Australian Colonies, and having in our different capacities had considerable experience in this matter, we cannot refrain from expressing our extreme, satisfaction on visiting you shortly after your coming to anchor in Holdfast Bay,at witnessing the great cleanliness, health, and cheerfulness which prevailed amongst the 180 emigrants brought out by you in the \"Zebra\".\n\nThe success with which you have conducted this interesting cargo to these shores, reflects great credit upon you, and we trust it may have the effect of inducing many others to follow.\n\nWe also hope when the great anxiety you have manifested, and the trouble you have taken in the promotion of the welfare of your passengers, after all claims on your attention have ceased by their leaving your ship shall be made known in Germany, that you will be again selected as the most fit person to be entrusted with a similar duty- one to which so much responsibility attaches, and on the humane execution of which so much of the happiness and comfort of many of our fellow creatures depend.\n\nBe assured of our sincere wishes for your welfare and believe us to be.
