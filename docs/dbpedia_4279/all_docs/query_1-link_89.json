        "text": "Unfinished business? After 10 years of concerts?\n\nYes, and plenty of it. The Schubertiade at the 92d Street Y, an annual series of concerts that ended last year, put forth many triumphs: not least, its own survival against worsening odds. Yet it was largely a story of unfinished business, from the cosmic level to the personal.\n\nThe cosmic angle is gone, and there is nothing to be done. But some personal disappointment should be partly redeemed this evening, when the German baritone and Schubert specialist Hermann Prey sings a program of Schubert's last songs at the Y, with James Levine at the piano. The program includes the posthumously collected song cycle ''Schwanengesang,'' which Mr. Prey and Mr. Levine were to have performed last year before Mr. Prey had to cancel.\n\nIn conception, the Schubertiade could hardly have been more cosmic: an attempt to present all of Schubert's music in chronological order, ending in the bicentennial year of the composer's birth, 1997. In practice, it did not even come close.\n\nWholesale changes in the Y's administration eroded commitment to the project over the years, and after three seasons it was interrupted and scaled down to series featuring bodies of Schubert's work related by genre or theme. Still, it persisted, limping gamely or striding proudly ahead, with Mr. Prey, the originator of the idea, providing moral as well as musical support.\n\nThen came the finale last April, with Mr. Prey, in all his autumnal glory, scheduled to sing the three Schubert song cycles and to see the project to its end, just as, in 1988, he had promised he would. But none of it happened. Mr. Prey canceled his entire participation in the event because of exhaustion.\n\n''It was so terrible for me,'' Mr. Prey, now 68, said the other day in an apartment near Lincoln Center borrowed from the tenor Placido Domingo. ''That should have been the climax, to do the three cycles here.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
