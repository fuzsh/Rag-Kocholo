        "text": "14 Chapter 14: Baroque and Classical Music\n\nIntroduction to Baroque Music\n\nThis section contains materials that will give you a general overview of the period. You’ll also find an introduction to some of the musical terms that you’ll encounter in almost any piece of Baroque music.\n\nThis section includes the following pages:\n\nSlideshow: Introduction to Baroque Music\n\nThe Baroque Period\n\nMore on the Baroque Period\n\nBasso Continuo\n\nDoctrine of the affections\n\nMusic of the Baroque Period\n\nThe Baroque period in European music lasted from about 1600 to about 1750. It was preceded by the Renaissance and followed by the Classical period. It was during the Baroque that the major/minor tonal system that still dominates Western music was established. This period is best known for the complex counterpoint of the mature Baroque, as typified by the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThis was the European period that is often called the Age of Reason. Brilliant minds such as Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, and Francis Bacon were laying the foundations for modern science and mathematics. Impressed with the insights that were gained in those fields, other influential thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke sought to apply similar strict rules of observation and reasoning to philosophy and political science. Many historians believe that this was a critical period that set Europe on its course away from the static or backward looking viewpoints of the Middle Ages and Renaissance and toward the forward momentum stance that led inexorably to our modern world.\n\nThere are discipline and order underlying much of Baroque music, perhaps reflecting the ideals of the age of reason. In particular, the orderly progression of the harmony and the discipline of complex counterpoint are hallmarks of this era. Yet Baroque composers also displayed a very strong interest in expressing emotions or affections through music. The fantasies and toccatas exhibit a freedom of expression that has very little to do with reason, and there is no mistaking the joy, pathos, or passion expressed in much of the era’s most popular works. Even the more staid religious works often seek to express an affective element of mysticism or massive grandeur.\n\nThis new exploration of emotion in music may have had its origins in another important historical influence on the music of this period. Previously, most composers were employed by the church, which usually, and often severely, limited their freedom to experiment. During the Baroque period, although churches were still important employers for many composers, the nobility became much more active patrons of music, and their courts became important venues for performances. This era thus saw a flowering of secular (nonchurch) musical forms, compositions for specific instruments (previously a rarity), and experimentation with harmony, rhythm, and form as well as affect that greatly and permanently altered the musical landscape.\n\nMusical Background, Development, and Influence\n\nThe Renaissance Springboard\n\nThe Baroque is the earliest period in European music whose music is still widely heard. This is probably because music before this period has an exotic, unfamiliar sound to most modern Western listeners. The music of the Middle Ages was modal rather than tonal; in other words, it was not based on chords and harmonies in major and minor keys. Most people strongly prefer the musical tradition that they grew up hearing; it makes sense to them in a way that unfamiliar traditions do not. In a fundamental way, the Baroque marked the beginning of our familiar tradition.\n\nOne of the most obvious differences that you can hear even if you don’t realize it or can’t explain it in medieval music is the lack of thirds, the interval that modern (triadic) chords are built from. Medieval music was based instead on the intervals of the perfect fifth and perfect fourth. This gives early music an open, hollow texture and harmonies that are unfamiliar to the modern ear.\n\nIt was during the Renaissance that thirds began to be used more often, particularly in the parallel thirds and parallel sixths style of fauxbourdon. (Sixths are closely related to thirds in the same way that fourths are closely related to fifths.)\n\nListen to a phrase accompanied by parallel fifths (medieval style harmony) and parallel thirds (Baroque to modern style harmony).\n\nThe Baroque Sound\n\nThe basic sound of the Renaissance was not the parallel harmonies of fauxbourdon but a complex polyphony of equal, independent (i.e., not moving in parallel) voices. The sound most closely associated with the Baroque kept the independent, contrapuntal voices, but with some important differences.\n\nThe most important change, as mentioned above, was the development during this era of tonal harmony. The composers of the mature Baroque were not only using major and minor chords but using them in the kinds of chord progressions and with the kinds of cadences that have continued to be used throughout the following centuries to our own times. This is not to say that there were no later changes to the system of harmony developed during the Baroque; the Romantic and early modern eras in particular saw a great deal of experimentation with harmony. The experimentation of the Romantic period expanded the harmonic possibilities inherent within the tonal system; its sound has also strongly influenced subsequent developments, including in popular music. Many modern composers rejected the tonal system altogether, seeking to replace it with other possibilities. Their efforts have been much less influential in other genres, probably since their nontonal offerings are simply too far outside the range of the familiar for most listeners.\n\nAnother development of the Baroque period that is still strongly with us was the rise of the bass line. The voices, or lines, of Renaissance music, and of some Baroque counterpoint, were typically equal in importance. But in much of Baroque music, the various parts were rapidly losing their equality. Instead, the highest line (what we hear as the melody) and the lowest line (the bass) became the most important parts, with the middle lines simply filling in the harmony. In fact, harpsichord players were often expected to improvise an accompaniment given only the bass line with some extra notations. This melody and bass dominated texture, with the bass outlining or strongly implying the harmony, still predominates in most Western music genres and styles.\n\nAs mentioned above, there were a great variety of musical forms popular with Baroque composers. Some of these, such as the highly contrapuntal fugues and inventions, are closely associated with this period. Others, including fantasies, variations, suites, sonatas, sinfonias, and concertos, proved more influential, with many major composers using, developing, and experimenting with these forms throughout later eras.\n\nClassical Rejections and Continuity\n\nThe composers of the Classical period were strongly influenced by the ideals of the Enlightenment, which strongly preferred the natural over the formal and egalitarianism over elitism. Concluding that the complex counterpoint of the Baroque was too formal and elitist, they consciously set out to develop a new style, with simpler, slower moving harmonies and dominating melodies, that was easier for the public to follow and understand. Although counterpoint certainly did not disappear from music, the true equal voices style counterpoint that had been so common in the Renaissance and Baroque became much rarer. (When independent voices were added to music of the Classical and later periods, they were often clearly subjugated to the main melody.) The simpler texture and harmony of the Classical period produced such a markedly different sound that even the casual listener can easily distinguish the typical Baroque piece from the typical Classical.\n\nAnd yet most other elements of Baroque music were not rejected. The most important element that remained was, of course, tonal harmony. The tendency to emphasize the melody and bass lines was, if anything, intensified in the simpler textures of the Classical period. Also, many of the forms and ensembles developed during the Baroque were adopted and developed and expanded in the Classical and later periods.\n\nHere is another overview and summary of the Baroque period; however, this reading contains more information on the early years of the Baroque. Pay special attention to the references to the Florentine Camerata, a group of scholar musicians in Florence, Italy. Their discussions were particularly influential in the development of a new style of music that marks the beginning of the Baroque.\n\nThe composer timeline near the end of this page is a handy resource. I want you to get a sense of the number of significant composers that we just don’t have time to study. It’s also a handy index to the composers we do reference in our reading materials. If you’re interested in specific composers, feel free to do an internet search to find more information about them.\n\nThere is also a list of instruments common in this period. You don’t need to study the instruments individually; however, as you come across references to different instruments in later readings (instrumental music becomes much more important in the Baroque than it was in the Renaissance), you’ll have this as a glossary that you can refer to.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBaroque music is a style of Western art music composed from approximately 1600 to 1750. This era followed the Renaissance and was followed in turn by the Classical era. The word baroque comes from the Portuguese word barroco, meaning misshapen pearl, a negative description of the ornate and heavily ornamented music of this period. Later, the name came to apply also to the architecture of the same period.\n\nBaroque music forms a major portion of the “classical music” canon, being widely studied, performed, and listened to. Composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Alessandro Scarlatti, Domenico Scarlatti, Antonio Vivaldi, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, François Couperin, Denis Gaultier, Claudio Monteverdi, Heinrich Schütz, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Jan Dismas Zelenka, and Johann Pachelbel.\n\nThe Baroque period saw the creation of tonality. During the period, composers and performers used more elaborate musical ornamentation, made changes in musical notation, and developed new instrumental playing techniques. Baroque music expanded the size, range, and complexity of instrumental performance and also established opera, cantata, oratorio, concerto, and sonata as musical genres. Many musical terms and concepts from this era are still in use today.\n\nEtymology\n\nHistory of European Art Music\n\nThe term “Baroque” is generally used by music historians to describe a broad range of styles from a wide geographic region, mostly in Europe, composed over a period of approximately 150 years.\n\nAlthough it was long thought that the word as a critical term was first applied to architecture, in fact it appears earlier in reference to music in an anonymous, satirical review of the premiere in October 1733 of Rameau’s Hippolyte et Aricie printed in the Mercure de France in May 1734. The critic implied that the novelty in this opera was “du baroque,” complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.\n\nThe systematic application by historians of the term “baroque” to music of this period is a relatively recent development. In 1919, Curt Sachs became the first to apply the five characteristics of Heinrich Wafflin’s theory of the Baroque systematically to music. Critics were quick to question the attempt to transpose Wafflin’s categories to music, however, and in the second quarter of the 20th century, independent attempts were made by Manfred Bukofzer (in Germany and, after his immigration, in America) and by Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune (in Belgium) to use autonomous, technical analysis rather than comparative abstractions in order to avoid the adaptation of theories based on the plastic arts and literature to music. All of these efforts resulted in appreciable disagreement about time boundaries of the period, especially concerning when it began. In English, the term acquired currency only in the 1940s, in the writings of Bukofzer and Paul Henry Lang.\n\nAs late as 1960, there was still considerable dispute in academic circles, particularly in France and Britain, whether it was meaningful to lump together music as diverse as that of Jacopo Peri, Domenico Scarlatti, and J. S. Bach under a single rubric. Nevertheless, the term has become widely used and accepted for this broad range of music. It may be helpful to distinguish the Baroque from both the preceding (Renaissance) and following (Classical) periods of musical history.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Baroque period is divided into three major phases: early, middle, and late. Although they overlap in time, they are conventionally dated from 1580 to 1630, from 1630 to 1680, and from 1680 to 1730.\n\nEarly Baroque Music (1580–1630)\n\nThe Florentine Camerata was a group of humanists, musicians, poets, and intellectuals in late Renaissance Florence who gathered under the patronage of Count Giovanni de’ Bardi to discuss and guide trends in the arts, especially music and drama. In reference to music, they based their ideals on a perception of Classical (especially ancient Greek) musical drama that valued discourse and oration. As such, they rejected their contemporaries’ use of polyphony and instrumental music and discussed such ancient Greek music devices as monody, which consisted of a solo singing accompanied by a kithara. The early realizations of these ideas, including Jacopo Peri’s Dafne and L’Euridice, marked the beginning of opera, which in turn was somewhat of a catalyst for Baroque music.\n\nConcerning music theory, the more widespread use of figured bass (also known as thorough bass) represents the developing importance of harmony as the linear underpinnings of polyphony. Harmony is the end result of counterpoint, and figured bass is a visual representation of those harmonies commonly employed in musical performance. Composers began concerning themselves with harmonic progressions and also employed the tritone, perceived as an unstable interval, to create dissonance. Investment in harmony had also existed among certain composers in the Renaissance, notably Carlo Gesualdo; however, the use of harmony directed toward tonality, rather than modality, marks the shift from the Renaissance into the Baroque period. This led to the idea that chords, rather than notes, could provide a sense of closure and one of the fundamental ideas that became known as tonality.\n\nBy incorporating these new aspects of composition, Claudio Monteverdi furthered the transition from the Renaissance style of music to that of the Baroque period. He developed two individual styles of composition—the heritage of Renaissance polyphony (prima pratica) and the new basso continuo technique of the Baroque (seconda pratica). With the writing of the operas L’Orfeo and L’incoronazione di Poppea, among others, Monteverdi brought considerable attention to the new genre of opera.\n\nMiddle Baroque Music (1630–1680)\n\nThe rise of the centralized court is one of the economic and political features of what is often labeled the Age of Absolutism, personified by Louis XIV of France. The style of the palace and the court system of manners and arts he fostered became the model for the rest of Europe. The realities of rising church and state patronage created the demand for organized public music as the increasing availability of instruments created the demand for chamber music.\n\nThe middle Baroque period in Italy is defined by the emergence of the cantata, oratorio, and opera during the 1630s and a new concept of melody and harmony that elevated the status of the music to one of equality with the words, which formerly had been regarded as preeminent. The florid, coloratura monody of the early Baroque gave way to a simpler, more polished melodic style. These melodies were built from short, cadentially delimited ideas often based on stylized dance patterns drawn from the sarabande or the courante. The harmonies, too, might be simpler than in the early Baroque monody, and the accompanying bass lines were more integrated with the melody, producing a contrapuntal equivalence of the parts that later led to the device of an initial bass anticipation of the aria melody.\n\nThis harmonic simplification also led to a new formal device of the differentiation of recitative and aria. The most important innovators of this style were the Romans Luigi Rossi and Giacomo Carissimi, who were primarily composers of cantatas and oratorios, respectively, and the Venetian Francesco Cavalli, who was principally an opera composer. Later important practitioners of this style include Antonio Cesti, Giovanni Legrenzi, and Alessandro Stradella.\n\nThe middle Baroque had absolutely no bearing at all on the theoretical work of Johann Fux, who systematized the strict counterpoint characteristic of earlier ages in his Gradus ad Paranassum (1725).\n\nOne preeminent example of a court style composer is Jean-Baptiste Lully. He purchased patents from the monarchy to be the sole composer of operas for the king and to prevent others from having operas staged. He completed 15 lyric tragedies and left unfinished Achille et Polyxne.\n\nMusically, he did not establish the string dominated norm for orchestras, which was inherited from the Italian opera, and the characteristically French five part disposition (violins, violas in hautes-contre, tailles and quintes sizes and bass violins) had been used in the ballet from the time of Louis XIII. He did, however, introduce this ensemble to the lyric theater, with the upper parts often doubled by recorders, flutes, and oboes and the bass by bassoons. Trumpets and kettledrums were frequently added for heroic scenes.\n\nArcangelo Corelli is remembered as influential for his achievements on the other side of musical technique as a violinist who organized violin technique and pedagogy and in purely instrumental music, particularly his advocacy and development of the concerto grosso. Whereas Lully was ensconced at court, Corelli was one of the first composers to publish widely and have his music performed all over Europe. As with Lully’s stylization and organization of the opera, the concerto grosso is built on strong contrasts; sections alternate between those played by the full orchestra and those played by a smaller group. Dynamics were “terraced”—that is, with a sharp transition from loud to soft and back again. Fast sections and slow sections were juxtaposed against each other. Numbered among his students is Antonio Vivaldi, who later composed hundreds of works based on the principles in Corelli’s trio sonatas and concerti.\n\nIn contrast to these composers, Dieterich Buxtehude was not a creature of court but instead was a church musician, holding the posts of organist and Werkmeister at the Marienkirche at Lübeck. His duties as Werkmeister involved acting as the secretary, treasurer, and business manager of the church, while his position as organist included playing for all the main services, sometimes in collaboration with other instrumentalists or vocalists, who were also paid by the church. Entirely outside of his official church duties, he organized and directed a concert series known as the Abendmusiken, which included performances of sacred dramatic works regarded by his contemporaries as the equivalent of operas.\n\nLate Baroque Music (1680–1730)\n\nThrough the work of Johann Fux, the Renaissance style of polyphony was made the basis for the study of composition.\n\nA continuous worker, Handel borrowed from others and often recycled his own material. He was also known for reworking pieces such as the famous Messiah, which premiered in 1742, for available singers and musicians.\n\nTimeline of Baroque Composers\n\nBaroque Instruments\n\nStrings\n\nViolino piccolo\n\nViolin\n\nViol\n\nViola\n\nViola d’amore\n\nViola pomposa\n\nTenor violin\n\nCello\n\nContrabass\n\nLute\n\nTheorbo\n\nArchlute\n\nAngelique\n\nMandolin\n\nGuitar\n\nHarp\n\nHurdy-gurdy\n\nWoodwinds\n\nBaroque flute\n\nChalumeau\n\nCortol (also known as Cortholt, Curtall, Oboe family)\n\nDulcian\n\nMusette de cour\n\nBaroque oboe\n\nRackett\n\nRecorder\n\nBassoon\n\nBrasses\n\nCornett\n\nNatural horn\n\nBaroque trumpet\n\nTromba da tirarsi (also called tromba spezzata)\n\nFlatt trumpet\n\nSerpent\n\nSackbut (16th and early 17th century English name for FR: saquebute, saqueboute; ES: sacabuche; IT: trombone; MHG: busaun, busne, busune / DE [since the early 17th century] Posaune)\n\nTrombone (English name for the same instrument, from the early 18th century)\n\nKeyboard\n\nClavichord\n\nTangent piano\n\nFortepiano—early version of piano\n\nHarpsichord\n\nOrgan\n\nPercussion\n\nBaroque timpani\n\nWood snare drum\n\nTenor drum\n\nTambourine\n\nCastanets\n\nStyles and Forms\n\nBasso continuo is a kind of continuous accompaniment notated with a new music notation system, figured bass, usually for a sustaining bass instrument and a keyboard instrument\n\nThe concerto and concerto grosso\n\nMonody is an outgrowth of song\n\nHomophony is music with one melodic voice and rhythmically similar accompaniment (this and monody are contrasted with the typical Renaissance texture, polyphony)\n\nDramatic musical forms like opera, dramma per musica\n\nCombined instrumental vocal forms, such as the oratorio and cantata\n\nNew instrumental techniques, like tremolo and pizzicato\n\nThe da capo aria “enjoyed sureness”\n\nThe ritornello aria is repeated short instrumental interruptions of vocal passages\n\nThe concertato style is a contrast in sound between groups of instruments\n\nExtensive ornamentation\n\nGenres\n\nVocal\n\nOpera\n\nZarzuela\n\nOpera seria\n\nOpera comique\n\nOpera-ballet\n\nMasque\n\nOratorio\n\nPassion (music)\n\nCantata\n\nMass (music)\n\nAnthem\n\nMonody\n\nChorale\n\nInstrumental\n\nChorale composition\n\nConcerto grosso\n\nFugue\n\nSuite\n\nAllemande\n\nCourante\n\nSarabande\n\nGigue\n\nGavotte\n\nMinuet\n\nSonata\n\nSonata da camera\n\nSonata da chiesa\n\nTrio sonata\n\nPartita\n\nCanzona\n\nSinfonia\n\nFantasia\n\nRicercar\n\nToccata\n\nPrelude\n\nChaconne\n\nPassacaglia\n\nChorale prelude\n\nStylus fantasticus\n\nThis page discusses a musical practice found in almost every Baroque piece: the use of basso continuo. With the end of the Baroque period, continuo fell out of fashion and was rarely heard in the music of the Classical era and beyond. The exception to this was in secco recitative in Classical opera, which continued to make use of sparse, improvised harmony on the harpsichord, though not of the harpsichord-cello pairing of Baroque continuo. This means that the presence of a basso continuo line in a piece of music is a strong indication that the piece is from the Baroque period.\n\nThe text in this reading is from a larger article about figured bass. Figured bass is a system of numbers and symbols written beneath the continuo line that indicated the harmonies that were to be improvised by the instrument playing the chords, usually the harpsichord. While figured bass is an important part of the practice of basso continuo, and you should be familiar with that definition, it’s not necessary in this class to dig any deeper into the music theory behind figured bass. Your main concern should be to understand the role of continuo in Baroque music and the instruments that most often performed it, so the information on this page will suffice, unless you wish to study the topic in greater depth for your own information.\n\nBasso Continuo\n\nBasso continuo parts, almost universal in the Baroque era (1600–1750), provided the harmonic structure of the music. The phrase is often shortened to continuo, and the instrumentalists playing the continuo part, if more than one, are called the continuo group. The titles of many Baroque works make mention of the continuo section, such as J. S. Bach’s Concerto for Two Violins, Strings, and Continuo in D Minor.\n\nThe makeup of the continuo group is often left to the discretion of the performers, and practice varied enormously within the Baroque period. At least one instrument capable of playing chords must be included, such as a harpsichord, organ, lute, oboe, guitar, regal, or harp. In addition, any number of instruments that play in the bass register may be included, such as cello, double bass, bass viol, or bassoon. The most common combination, at least in modern performances, is harpsichord and cello for instrumental works and secular vocal works, such as operas, and organ for sacred music. Typically performers match the instrument families used in the full ensemble: including bassoon when the work includes oboes or other winds but restricting it to cello and/or double bass if only strings are involved. Harps, lutes, and other handheld instruments are more typical of early 17th century music. Sometimes instruments are specified by the composer: in L’Orfeo (1607), Monteverdi calls for an exceptionally varied instrumentation, with multiple harpsichords and lutes, with a bass violin in the pastoral scenes, followed by lamenting to the accompaniment of organo di legno and chitarrone, while Charon stands watch to the sound of a regal.\n\nThe keyboard (or other chording instrument) player realizes a continuo part by playing, in addition to the indicated bass notes, upper notes to complete chords, either determined ahead of time or improvised in performance. The figured bass notation, described below, is a guide, but performers are also expected to use their musical judgment and the other instruments or voices as a guide, and experienced players often incorporate motives found in the other instrumental parts. Modern editions of such music usually supply a realized keyboard part, fully written out for a player, in place of improvisation. With the rise in historically informed performance, however, the number of performers who improvise their parts, as Baroque players would have done, has increased.\n\nBasso continuo, though an essential structural and identifying element of the Baroque period, continued to be used in many works, especially sacred choral works, of the Classical period (up to around 1800). An example is C. P. E. Bach’s Concerto in D minor for flute, strings, and basso continuo. Examples of its use in the 19th century are rarer, but they do exist: masses by Anton Bruckner, Beethoven, and Franz Schubert, for example, have a basso continuo part for an organist to play.\n\nHere you’ll find a brief explanation of the doctrine of the affections. Like the use of basso continuo, the practice of composing music that expressed a single emotion (affect) is unique to the Baroque era. Later composers wanted the freedom to express contrasting emotions in a single piece of music. One of the most noticeable results of Baroque composers’ adherence to the Doctrine of Affections was the practice of breaking a longer text up into shorter phrases and setting each as a separate movement with music designed to express a single emotion or affect.\n\nFor example, the Utrecht Te Deum by George Frideric Handel (a late Baroque composer) consists of ten separate movements, while the Te Deum No. 2 in C by Franz Joseph Haydn (a composer of the late Classical era) is a single piece of music with no separate movements. Note that those two texts are not exactly the same. Handel’s Te Deum is in English, while Haydn’s is in the original Latin. But they serve to illustrate the impact of the Doctrine of Affections on music composition in the Baroque.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe doctrine of the affections, also known as the doctrine of affects, doctrine of the passions, theory of the affects, or by the German term Affektenlehre (after the German Affekt; plural Affekte) was a theory in the aesthetics of painting, music, and theater widely used in the Baroque era (1600–1750) (Harnoncourt 1983; Harnoncourt 1988). Literary theorists of that age, by contrast, rarely discussed the details of what was called “pathetic composition,” taking it for granted that a poet should be required to “wake the soul by tender strokes of art” (Rogerson 1953, p. 68). The doctrine was derived from ancient theories of rhetoric and oratory (Buelow 2001). Some pieces or movements of music express one Affekt throughout; however, a skillful composer like Johann Sebastian Bach could express different affects within a movement (Boetticher 2010).\n\nHistory and Definition\n\nThe doctrine of the affections was an elaborate theory based on the idea that the passions could be represented by their outward visible or audible signs. It drew largely on elements with a long previous history, but first came to general prominence in the mid 17th century among the French scholar critics associated with the Court of Versailles, helping to place it at the center of artistic activity for all of Europe (Rogerson 1953, p. 70). The term itself, however, was only first devised in the 20th century by German musicologists Hermann Kretzschmar, Harry Goldschmidt, and Arnold Schering, to describe this aesthetic theory (Buelow 2001; Nagley and Buji, 2002).\n\nRené Descartes held that there were six basic affects, which can be combined together into numerous intermediate forms (Descartes 1649, p. 94):\n\nAdmiration (admiration)\n\nAmour (love)\n\nHaine (hatred)\n\nDésir (desire)\n\nJoie (joy)\n\nTristesse (sorrow)\n\nAnother authority also mentions sadness, anger, and jealousy (Buelow 2001).\n\nLorenzo Giacomini (1552–1598) in his Orationi e discorsi defined an affection as “a spiritual movement or operation of the mind in which it is attracted or repelled by an object it has come to know as a result of an imbalance in the animal spirits and vapours that flow continually throughout the body” (Giacomini Tebalducci Malespini 1597).\n\n“Affections are not the same as emotions; however, they are a spiritual movement of the mind” (Palisca 1991, p. 3).\n\nIntroduction to Vocal Music in the Baroque Period\n\nA prominent Baroque proponent of the doctrine of the affections was Johann Mattheson (Poultney 1996). This section contains materials that will focus on the major genres of vocal music you’ll encounter in your study of the Baroque period—namely, opera, cantata, and oratorio—and some of the composers who developed those genres. Because Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel are generally viewed as the towering masters of the late Baroque, readings focusing on their lives and works of vocal music will be in a separate section.\n\nThis section includes the following pages:\n\nSlideshow: Vocal Music in the Baroque\n\nOpera\n\nMonody\n\nMonteverdi’s L’Orfeo\n\nHenry Purcell\n\nDido and Aeneas\n\nCantata\n\nOratorio\n\nPerhaps the single greatest musical development of the Baroque period is the creation of a new genre of vocal music: opera. As with most genres in this era, opera undergoes significant stylistic evolution from its origins in the early 1600s to the opera seria of Handel in the 1730s. Please pay special attention to the following terms (if you would like to learn more about them, follow the links): libretto, recitative (both forms: secco and accompagnato), and aria.\n\nOpera\n\nOpera (English plural: operas; Italian plural: opere) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (called a libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theater, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble.\n\nOpera is part of the Western Classical music tradition. It started in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri’s lost Dafne, produced in Florence in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Schatz in Germany, Lully in France, and Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as Handel. Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his “reform” operas in the 1760s. Today the most renowned figure of late 18th century opera is Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially The Marriage of Figaro (Le Nozze Di Figaro), Don Giovanni, and Così fan tutte, as well as The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflute), a landmark in the German tradition.\n\nOperatic Terminology\n\nThe words of an opera are known as the libretto (literally “little book”). Some composers, notably Richard Wagner, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists—e.g., Mozart with Lorenzo Da Ponte. Traditional opera, often referred to as “number opera,” consists of two modes of singing: recitative, the plot driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech, and aria (an “air” or formal song), in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Duets, trios, and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action. In some forms of opera, such as Singspiel, opera comique, operetta, and semi opera, the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue. Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative are also referred to as arioso. During the Baroque and Classical periods, recitative could appear in two basic forms: secco (dry) recitative, sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accent of the words, accompanied only by continuo, which was usually a harpsichord and a cello; or accompagnato (also known as instrumentato), in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. By the 19th century, accompanto had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and Richard Wagner revolutionized opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what he termed “endless melody.” Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner’s example, though some, such as Stravinsky in his The Rake’s Progress, have bucked the trend. The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in detail below.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Italian word opera means “work,” in the sense of both the labor done and the result produced. The Italian word derives from the Latin opera, a singular noun meaning “work” and also the plural of the noun opus. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Italian word was first used in the sense of a “composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined” in 1639; the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648.\n\nDafne by Jacopo Peri was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate Florentine humanists who gathered as the “Camerata de’ Bardi.” Significantly, Dafne was an attempt to revive the classical Greek drama, part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the Renaissance. The members of the Camerata considered that the “chorus” parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of “restoring” this situation. Dafne is unfortunately lost. A later work by Peri, Euridice, dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. The honor of being the first opera still to be regularly performed, however, goes to Claudio Monteverdi’s L’Orfeo, composed for the court of Mantua in 1607. The Mantua court of the Gonzagas, employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the concerto delle donne (till 1598) but also one of the first actual “opera singers”: Madama Europa.\n\nThe Baroque Era\n\nOpera did not remain confined to court audiences for long. In 1637, the idea of a “season” (Carnival) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in Venice. Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, Il ritorno d’Ulisse in patria and L’incoronazione di Poppea, for the Venetian theater in the 1640s. His most important follower, Francesco Cavalli, helped spread opera throughout Italy.\n\nIn these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera’s many reform movements, sponsored by the Arcadian Academy, which came to be associated with the poet Metastasio, whose libretti helped crystallize the genre of opera seria, which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque era opera was reserved for what came to be called opera buffa. Before such elements were forced out of opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as sort of an “opera-within-an-opera.” One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public opera houses. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the commedia dell’arte, a long flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy.\n\nJust as intermedi had once been performed in between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of “intermezzi,” which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and 1720s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.\n\nOpera seria was elevated in tone and highly stylized in form, usually consisting of secco recitative interspersed with long da capo arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing, and during the golden age of opera seria the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the castrato voice; castrati such as Farinelli and Senesino, as well as female sopranos such as Faustina Bordoni, became in great demand throughout Europe as opera seria ruled the stage in every country except France. Indeed, Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like Handel found himself composing the likes of Rinaldo and Giulio Cesare for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the Classical period as well—for example, in the operas of Mozart, who wrote in Vienna near the century’s close. Leading Italian born composers of opera seria include Alessandro Scarlatti, Vivaldi, and Porpora.\n\nMonody\n\nOne of the aims of the scholars in the Florentine Camerata was to make the music serve the text. They objected to the obscuring of the text and its meaning that was common in late Renaissance polyphony, and they sought to create a new musical style that would be more expressive and reflective of the text. To do this, they looked back to the traditions of ancient Greek drama or at least to their limited understanding of those traditions. The result of their efforts was the singing style we refer to as monody. Though monody in its strictest form did not remain in use very long, it had enormous influence on the emerging vocal genres of opera, cantata, and oratorio.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn music, the term monody refers to a solo vocal style distinguished by having a single melodic line and instrumental accompaniment. More specifically, it applies to Italian song of the early 17th century, particularly the period from about 1600 to 1640. The term itself is a recent invention of scholars: no composer of the 17th century ever called a piece a monody. In the Baroque, compositions in monodic style were labeled madrigals, motets, or even concertos (in the earlier sense of “concertato,” meaning “with instruments”).\n\nIn monody, which developed out of an attempt by the Florentine Camerata in the 1580s to restore ancient Greek ideas of melody and declamation (probably with little historical accuracy), a solo voice sings a rhythmically free melodic line in a declamatory style. Early Baroque composers’ primary goal in monodic composition was to have the music conform to the natural rhythm and meaning of the text. This was a reaction to the complex polyphony of late Renaissance choral music in which the text was often obscured by the independence of the various lines. This vocal melody was sparsely accompanied by the bass line and improvised chords of the basso continuo instrument pair. The development of monody was one of the defining characteristics of early Baroque practice, as opposed to late Renaissance style, in which groups of voices sang independently and with a greater balance between parts.\n\nExisting musical genres that adopted the style of monody were the madrigal and the motet, both of which developed into solo forms after 1600.\n\nContrasting passages in monodies could be more melodic or more declamatory: these two styles of presentation eventually developed into the aria and the recitative, and the overall form merged with the cantata by about 1635.\n\nAn important early treatise on monody is contained in Giulio Caccini’s song collection Le nuove musiche (Caccini, 1601).\n\nYou have already been introduced to Claudio Monteverdi, whose music straddles the late Renaissance and early Baroque. Now let’s explore one of his most significant compositions, L’Orfeo, the first opera considered to be a masterwork.\n\nIntroduction\n\nL’Orfeo (SV 318), sometimes called La favola d’Orfeo, is an early Baroque favola in musica, or opera (sometimes considered late Renaissance), by Claudio Monteverdi, with a libretto by Alessandro Striggio. It is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus and tells the story of his descent to Hades and his fruitless attempt to bring his dead bride Eurydice back to the living world. It was written in 1607 for a court performance during the annual Carnival at Mantua. While the honor of the first ever opera goes to Jacopo Peri’s Dafne, and the earliest surviving opera is Euridice (also by Peri), L’Orfeo has the honor of being the earliest surviving opera that is still regularly performed today.\n\nDuring the early 17th century, the traditional intermedio, a musical sequence between the acts of a straight play, was evolving into the form of a complete musical drama or “opera.” Monteverdi’s L’Orfeo moved this process out of its experimental era and provided the first fully developed example of the new genre. After its initial performance, the work was staged again in Mantua, and possibly in other Italian centers in the next few years. Its score was published by Monteverdi in 1609 and again in 1615. After the composer’s death in 1643, the opera went unperformed for many years and was largely forgotten until a revival of interest in the late 19th century led to a spate of modern editions and performances. At first these tended to be unstaged versions within institutes and music societies, but following the first modern dramatized performance in Paris, in 1911, the work began to be seen increasingly often in theaters. After the Second World War, most new editions sought authenticity through the use of period instruments. Many recordings were issued, and the opera was increasingly staged in opera houses. In 2007, the quatercentenary of the premiere was celebrated by performances throughout the world.\n\nIn his published score, Monteverdi lists around 41 instruments to be deployed, with distinct groups of instruments used to depict particular scenes and characters. Thus strings, harpsichords, and recorders represent the pastoral fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds, while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens. Composed at the point of transition from the Renaissance era to the Baroque, L’Orfeo employs all the resources then known within the art of music, with particularly daring use of polyphony. The work is not orchestrated as such; in the Renaissance tradition, instrumentalists followed the composer’s general instructions but were given considerable freedom to improvise. This separates Monteverdi’s work from the later opera canon and makes each performance of L’Orfeo a uniquely individual occasion.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nClaudio Monteverdi, born in Cremona in 1567, was a musical prodigy who studied under Marc’Antonio Ingegneri, the maestro di cappella (head of music) at Cremona Cathedral. After training in singing, strings playing, and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga’s court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work, Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga’s maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.\n\nVincenzo Gonzaga’s particular passion for musical theater and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Toward the end of the 16th century, innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio, a long established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas, into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognized as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de’ Cavalieri, Peri’s Euridice, and Giulio Caccini’s identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid’s Metamorphoses and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi’s L’Orfeo.\n\nThe Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo’s time, the court had staged Angelo Poliziano’s lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598, Monteverdi had helped the court’s musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini’s play Il pastor fido, described by theater historian Mark Ringer as a “watershed theatrical work” that inspired the Italian craze for pastoral drama. On 6 October 1600, while visiting Florence for the wedding of Maria de’ Medici to King Henry IV of France, Duke Vincenzo attended a production of Peri’s Euridice. It is likely that his principal musicians, including Monteverdi, were also present at this performance. The duke quickly recognized the novelty of this new form of dramatic entertainment and its potential for bringing prestige to those prepared to sponsor it.\n\nComposition\n\nWhen Monteverdi wrote the music for L’Orfeo, he had a thorough grounding in theatrical music. He had been employed at the Gonzaga court for 16 years, much of it as a performer or arranger of stage music, and in 1604, he had written the ballo Gli amori di Diane ed Endimone for the 1604-5 Mantua Carnival. The elements from which Monteverdi constructed his first opera score—the aria, the strophic song, recitative, choruses, dances, dramatic musical interlude—were, as conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt has pointed out, not created by him, but “he blended the entire stock of newest and older possibilities into a unity that was indeed new.” Musicologist Robert Donington writes similarly: “[The score] contains no element which was not based on precedent, but it reaches complete maturity in that recently developed form.…Here are words as directly expressed in music as [the pioneers of opera] wanted them expressed; here is music expressing them…with the full inspiration of genius.”\n\nMonteverdi states the orchestral requirements at the beginning of his published score, but in accordance with the practice of the day, he does not specify their exact usage. At that time, it was usual to allow each interpreter of the work freedom to make local decisions based on the orchestral forces at their disposal. These could differ sharply from place to place. Furthermore, as Harnoncourt points out, the instrumentalists would all have been composers and would have expected to collaborate creatively at each performance rather than playing a set text. Another practice of the time was to allow singers to embellish their arias. Monteverdi wrote plain and embellished versions of some arias, such as Orfeo’s “Possente spirito,” but according to Harnoncourt, “it is obvious that where he did not write any embellishments he did not want any sung.”\n\nEach act of the opera deals with a single element of the story, and each ends with a chorus. Despite the five act structure, with two sets of scene changes, it is likely that L’Orfeo conformed to the standard practice for court entertainments of that time and was played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key, and style.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe action takes place in two contrasting locations: the fields of Thrace (Acts 1, 2, and 5) and the Underworld (Acts 3 and 4). An instrumental toccata (English: tucket, meaning a flourish on trumpets) precedes the entrance of La musica, representing the “spirit of music,” who sings a prologue of five stanzas of verse. After a gracious welcome to the audience, she announces that she can, through sweet sounds, “calm every troubled heart.” She sings a further paean to the power of music before introducing the drama’s main protagonist, Orfeo, who “held the wild beasts spellbound with his song.”\n\nAct 1\n\nAfter La musica’s final request for silence, the curtain rises on Act 1 to reveal a pastoral scene. Orfeo and Euridice enter together with a chorus of nymphs and shepherds, who act in the manner of a Greek chorus, commenting on the action both as a group and as individuals. A shepherd announces that this is the couple’s wedding day; the chorus responds, first in a stately invocation (“Come, Hymen, O come”) and then in a joyful dance (“Leave the mountains, leave the fountains”). Orfeo and Euridice sing of their love for each other before leaving with most of the group for the wedding ceremony in the temple. Those left on stage sing a brief chorus, commenting on how Orfeo used to be one “for whom sighs were food and weeping was drink” before love brought him to a state of sublime happiness.\n\nAct 2\n\nOrfeo returns with the main chorus, and sings with them of the beauties of nature. Orfeo then muses on his former unhappiness but proclaims, “After grief one is more content, after pain one is happier.” The mood of contentment is abruptly ended when La messaggera enters, bringing the news that, while gathering flowers, Euridice has received a fatal snakebite. The chorus expresses its anguish: “Ah, bitter happening, ah, impious and cruel fate!” while the Messaggera castigates herself as the bearing of bad tidings (“For ever I will flee, and in a lonely cavern lead a life in keeping with my sorrow”). Orfeo, after venting his grief and incredulity (“Thou art dead, my life, and I am breathing?”), declares his intention to descend into the Underworld and persuade its ruler to allow Euridice to return to life. Otherwise, he says, “I shall remain with thee in the company of death.” He departs, and the chorus resumes its lament.\n\nAct 3\n\nOrfeo is guided by Speranza to the gates of Hades. Having pointed out the words inscribed on the gate (“Abandon hope, all ye who enter here”), Speranza leaves. Orfeo is now confronted with the ferryman Caronte, who addresses Orfeo harshly and refuses to take him across the river Styx. Orfeo attempts to persuade Caronte by singing a flattering song to him (“Mighty spirit and powerful divinity”), but the ferryman is unmoved. However, when Orfeo takes up his lyre and plays, Caronte is soothed into sleep. Seizing his chance, Orfeo steals the ferryman’s boat and crosses the river, entering the Underworld, while a chorus of spirits reflects that nature cannot defend herself against man: “He has tamed the sea with fragile wood, and disdained the rage of the winds.”\n\nAct 4\n\nIn the Underworld, Proserpina, Queen of Hades, who has been deeply affected by Orfeo’s singing, petitions King Plutone, her husband, for Euridice’s release. Moved by her pleas, Plutone agrees on the condition that, as he leads Euridice toward the world, Orfeo must not look back. If he does, “a single glance will condemn him to eternal loss.” Orfeo enters, leading Euridice and singing confidently that on that day he will rest on his wife’s white bosom. But as he sings, a note of doubt creeps in: “Who will assure me that she is following?” Perhaps Plutone, driven by envy, has imposed the condition through spite? Suddenly distracted by an offstage commotion, Orfeo looks around; immediately, the image of Euridice begins to fade. She sings, despairingly, “Losest thou me through too much love?” and disappears. Orfeo attempts to follow her but is drawn away by an unseen force. The chorus of spirits sings that Orfeo, having overcome Hades, was in turn overcome by his passions.\n\nAct 5\n\nBack in the fields of Thrace, Orfeo has a long soliloquy in which he laments his loss, praises Euridice’s beauty, and resolves that his heart will never again be pierced by Cupid’s arrow. An offstage echo repeats his final phrases. Suddenly, in a cloud, Apollo descends from the heavens and chastises him: “Why dost thou give thyself up as prey to rage and grief?” He invites Orfeo to leave the world and join him in the heavens, where he will recognize Euridice’s likeness in the stars. Orfeo replies that it would be unworthy not to follow the counsel of such a wise father, and together they ascend. A shepherds’ chorus concludes that “he who sows in suffering shall reap the fruit of every grace,” before the opera ends with a vigorous moresca.\n\nOriginal Libretto Ending\n\nIn Striggio’s 1607 libretto, Orfeo’s Act 5 soliloquy is interrupted not by Apollo’s appearance but by a chorus of maenads or Bacchantes wild, drunken women who sing of the “divine fury” of their master, the god Bacchus. The cause of their wrath is Orfeo and his renunciation of women; he will not escape their heavenly anger, and the longer he evades them, the more severe his fate will be. Orfeo leaves the scene, and his destiny is left uncertain, for the Bacchantes devote themselves for the rest of the opera to wild singing and dancing in praise of Bacchus. Early music authority Claude Palisca believes that the two endings are not incompatible; Orfeo evades the fury of the Bacchantes and is then rescued by Apollo.\n\nhttps://library.achievingthedream.org/alamomusicappreciation/chapter/henry-purcell/ Tue, 24 Mar 2020 04:51:59 +0000\n\nHere is a link to a Naxos article on Henry Purcell, a famous, though tragically short lived, English composer. His operatic compositions were few but represent the development of a mid Baroque English operatic tradition that was later supplanted when Italian opera was imported to the English stage, most notably by Handel.\n\nDido and Aeneas\n\nThe final aria from Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas, often referred to as “Dido’s Lament,” is one of your listening pieces for the Baroque. While scholars and fans of opera would know exactly what piece is indicated by the popular label “Dido’s Lament,” recitatives and arias are technically titled according to their first line—in this case, “When I am laid in earth.”\n\nThis aria is unquestionably among the most beautiful arias in the operatic literature. It features an ostinato in the continuo part, known as a “ground bass,” and is an example of how an aria does not advance the plot but focuses on the expression of emotion. Your listening example begins with the short recitative “Thy hand Belinda” and then proceeds with the aria.\n\nBackground and Context\n\nBefore Dido and Aeneas, Purcell composed music for several stage works, including nine pieces for Nathaniel Lee’s Theodosius, or The Force of Love (1680) and eight songs for Thomas d’ Urfey’s A Fool’s Preferment (1688). He also composed songs for two plays by Nahum Tate (later the librettist of Dido and Aeneas), The Sicilian Usurper (1680) and Cuckold-Haven (1685). Dido and Aeneas was Purcell’s first (and only) all sung opera and derives from the English masque tradition.\n\nLibretto\n\nOriginally based on Nahum Tate’s play Brutus of Alba, or The Enchanted Lovers (1678), the opera is likely, at least to some extent, to be allegorical. The prologue refers to the joy of a marriage between two monarchs, which could refer to the marriage between William and Mary. In a poem of about 1686, Tate alluded to James II as Aeneas, who is misled by the evil machinations of the Sorceress and her witches (representing Roman Catholicism, a common metaphor at the time) into abandoning Dido, who symbolizes the British people. The same symbolism may apply to the opera. This explains the addition of the characters of the Sorceress and the witches, which do not appear in the original Aeneid. It would be noble, or at least acceptable, for Aeneas to follow the decree of the Gods but not so acceptable for him to be tricked by ill meaning spirits.\n\nAlthough the opera is a tragedy, there are numerous seemingly lighter scenes, such as the First Sailor’s song: “Take a boozy short leave of your nymphs on the shore, and silence their mourning with vows of returning, though never intending to visit them more.” Harris considers the callousness and cynicism of the song to underline the “moral” of the story, that young women should not succumb to the advances and promises of ardent young men.\n\nScore\n\nNo score in Purcell’s hand is extant, and the only 17th century source is a libretto, possibly from the original performance. The earliest extant score, held in the Bodleian Library, was copied no earlier than 1750, well over 60 years after the opera was composed. No later sources follow the act divisions of the libretto, and the music to the prologue is lost. The prologue, the end of the act 2 “Grove” scene, and several dances were almost certainly lost when the opera was divided into parts to be performed as interludes between the acts of spoken plays in the first decade of the 18th century.\n\nThe first of the arias to be published separately was “Ah, Belinda” in Orpheus Britannicus. The most famous aria of the work is “When I am laid in earth,” popularly known as “Dido’s Lament.” Both arias are formed on a lamento ground bass. “Dido’s Lament” has been performed or recorded by artists far from the typical operatic school, such as Klaus Nomi (as “Death”), Ane Brun, and Jeff Buckley. It has also been transcribed or used in many scores, including the soundtrack to the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers (renamed “Nixon’s Walk”). It is played annually by a military band at the Cenotaph remembrance ceremony, which takes place on the Sunday nearest to 11 November (Armistice Day) in London’s Whitehall.\n\nThe music is thought by some to be too simple for Purcell in 1689, but this may simply reflect that the intended performers were schoolchildren. The work is scored for four part strings and continuo. The fact that the libretto from the Chelsea School performance indicates two dances for guitar, the “Dance Gittars Chacony” in act 1 and the “Gittar Ground a Dance” in the Grove scene of act 2, has led one scholar to suggest that Purcell envisioned a guitar as a primary member of the continuo group for the opera. Music for neither of these dances is extant, and it seems likely that Purcell did not compose them but rather left them to be improvised by the guitarist. Several editions of the opera have been made and have been provided with a continuo realization; a notable, if rather idiosyncratic, edition being that made by Imogen Holst and Benjamin Britten. There are a number of editions with realizations, and the opera’s accessibility to amateur performers is a feature that has greatly abetted the growth of its popularity in the latter half of the 20th century. While the Prologue’s music has been lost and has not been reconstructed, several realizations of the opera include a solution to the missing ritornello at the end of the second act. Known to have been part of the score, it is now performed as a dance taken from other, similar works by Purcell, or invented outright in the same vein, to keep the integrity and continuity of the performance.\n\nSynopsis\n\nAct 1\n\nDido’s court\n\nThe opera opens with Dido in her court with her attendants. Belinda is trying to cheer up Dido, but Dido is full of sorrow, saying, “Peace and I are strangers grown.” Belinda believes the source of this grief to be the Trojan Aeneas and suggests that Carthage’s troubles could be resolved by a marriage between the two. Dido and Belinda talk for a time. Dido fears that her love will make her a weak monarch, but Belinda and the Second Woman reassure her, “The hero loves as well.” Aeneas enters the court and is at first received coldly by Dido, but she eventually accepts his proposal of marriage.\n\nAct 2\n\nScene 1: The cave of the Sorceress\n\nThe Sorceress/Sorcerer is plotting the destruction of Carthage and its queen and summons companions to help with evil plans. The plan is to send her “trusted elf” disguised as Mercury, someone to whom Aeneas will surely listen, to tempt him to leave Dido and sail to Italy. This would leave Dido heartbroken, and she would surely die. The chorus join in with terrible laughter, and the Enchantresses decide to conjure up a storm to make Dido and her train leave the grove and return to the palace. When the spell is prepared, the witches vanish in a thunderclap.\n\nScene 2: A grove during the middle of a hunt\n\nAct 3\n\nDido and Aeneas are accompanied by their train. They stop at the grove to take in its beauty. A lot of action is going on, with attendants carrying goods from the hunt and a picnic possibly taking place, and Dido and Aeneas are together within the activity. This is all stopped when Dido hears distant thunder, prompting Belinda to tell the servants to prepare for a return to shelter as soon as possible. As every other character leaves the stage, Aeneas is stopped by the Sorceress’s elf, who is disguised as Mercury. This pretend Mercury brings the command of Jove that Aeneas is to wait no longer in beginning his task of creating a new Troy on Latin soil. Aeneas consents to the wishes of what he believes are the gods but is heartbroken that he will have to leave Dido. He then goes offstage to prepare for his departure from Carthage.\n\nThe Harbor at Carthage\n\nPreparations are being made for the departure of the Trojan fleet. The sailors sing a song, which is followed shortly by the Sorceress and her companions’ sudden appearance. The group is pleased at how well their plan has worked, and the Sorceress sings a solo describing her further plans for the destruction of Aeneas “on the ocean.” All the characters begin to clear the stage after a dance in three sections and then disperse.\n\nThe palace\n\nDido and Belinda enter, shocked at Aeneas’s disappearance. Dido is distraught and Belinda comforts her. Suddenly Aeneas returns, but Dido is full of fear before Aeneas speaks, and his words only serve to confirm her suspicions. She derides his reasons for leaving, and even when Aeneas says he will defy the gods and not leave Carthage, Dido rejects him for having once thought of leaving her. After Dido forces Aeneas to leave, she states that “Death must come when he is gone.” The opera and Dido’s life both slowly come to a conclusion as the Queen of Carthage sings her last aria, “When I am laid in Earth,” also known as “Dido’s Lament.” The chorus and orchestra then conclude the opera once Dido is dead by ordering the “cupids to scatter roses on her tomb, soft and gentle as her heart. Keep here your watch, and never never never part.”\n\nCantata\n\nOther vocal genres, along with opera, such as the cantata and oratorio, were developing in the early years of the Baroque. This page discusses the cantata. There are two terms that are used in the beginning of this page that I would like you to pay particular attention to: cantata da camera (chamber cantata) and cantata da chiesa (church cantata). These terms are applied to cantatas written as chamber music (music for performance in smaller settings and before smaller audiences) in the middle of the Baroque and distinguish whether the piece was secular or sacred.\n\nBy the late Baroque, the genre of cantata had become more substantial. The cantatas of J. S. Bach and his contemporaries were longer, involved more instruments and singers, and were usually performed for larger audiences. We don’t use the terms camera and chiesa when talking about these later Baroque cantatas. Cantatas of that time frame were simply understood to be sacred or secular depending on the occasion for which they were composed.\n\nIntroduction\n\nA cantata (literally “sung,” past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb cantare, “to sing”) is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir.\n\nThe meaning of the term changed over time from the simple single voice madrigal of the early 17th century, to the multivoice “cantata da camera” and the “cantata da chiesa” of the later part of that century, and from the more substantial dramatic forms of the 18th century, to the usually sacred texted 19th century cantata, which was effectively a type of short oratorio. Cantatas for use in the liturgy of church services are called church cantata or sometimes sacred cantata, others sometimes secular cantata. Johann Sebastian Bach composed around 200 cantatas. Several cantatas were, and still are, written for special occasions, such as Christmas cantatas.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThe term originated in the early 17th century simultaneously with opera and oratorio. Prior to that, all “cultured” music was vocal. With the rise of instrumental music, the term appeared, while the instrumental art became sufficiently developed to be embodied in sonatas. From the beginning of the 17th century until late in the 18th, the cantata for one or two solo voices with accompaniment of basso continuo (and perhaps a few solo instruments) was a principal form of Italian vocal chamber music.\n\nA cantata consisted first of a declamatory narrative or scene in recitative, held together by a primitive aria repeated at intervals. Fine examples may be found in the church music of Giacomo Carissimi, and the English vocal solos of Henry Purcell (such as Mad Tom and Mad Bess) show the utmost that can be made of this archaic form. With the rise of the da capo aria, the cantata became a group of two or three arias joined by recitative. George Frideric Handel’s numerous Italian duets and trios are examples on a rather large scale. His Latin motet Silete Venti, for soprano solo, shows the use of this form in church music.\n\nDifferences from Other Musical Forms\n\nThe Italian solo cantata tended, when on a large scale, to become indistinguishable from a scene in an opera in the same way the church cantata, solo or choral, is indistinguishable from a small oratorio or portion of an oratorio. This is equally evident whether we examine the unparalleled church cantatas of Bach, of which nearly 200 are extant (see List of Bach cantatas), or the Chandos Anthems of Handel. In Johann Sebastian Bach’s case, many of the larger cantatas are actually called oratorios, and the Christmas Oratorio is a collection of six church cantatas actually intended for performance on six different days, though together forming as complete an artistic whole as any classical oratorio.\n\nBaroque\n\nCantatas were in great demand for the services of the Lutheran church. Sacred cantatas for the liturgy or other occasions were not only composed by Bach but also by Dieterich Buxtehude, Christoph Graupner, Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel, and Georg Philipp Telemann, to name a few. Many secular cantatas were composed for events in the nobility. They were so similar in form to the sacred ones that many of them were parodied (in parts or completely) to sacred cantatas—for example, in Bach’s Christmas Oratorio.\n\nOratorio\n\nAn oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theater, while oratorio is strictly a concert piece, though oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio, there is generally little or no interaction between the characters and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church’s prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences.\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word oratorio, from the Italian for “pulpit” or “oratory,” was “named from the kind of musical services held in the church of the Oratory of St Philip Neri in Rome (Congregazione dell’Oratorio) in the latter half of the 16th century.”\n\n1600, Origins of the Oratorio\n\nAlthough medieval plays such as the Ludus Danielis and Renaissance dialogue motets such as those of the Oltremontani had characteristics of an oratorio, the first oratorio is usually seen as Emilio de Cavalieri’s Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo. Monteverdi composed Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda, which can be considered as the first secular oratorio.\n\nThe origins of the oratorio can be found in sacred dialogues in Italy. These were settings of biblical, Latin texts and musically were quite similar to motets. There was a strong narrative and dramatic emphasis, and there were conversational exchanges between characters in the work. Giovanni Francesco Anerio’s Teatro harmonico spirituale (1619) is a set of 14 dialogues, the longest of which is 20 minutes long and covers the conversion of St. Paul and is for four soloists: Historicus (narrator), tenor; St. Paul, tenor; Voice from Heaven, bass; and ananias, tenor. There is also a four part chorus to represent any crowds in the drama. The music is often contrapuntal and madrigal like. Philip Neri’s Congregazione dell’Oratorio featured the singing of spiritual laude. These became more and more popular and were eventually performed in specially built oratories (prayer halls) by professional musicians. Again, these were chiefly based on dramatic and narrative elements. Sacred opera provided another impetus for dialogues, and they greatly expanded in length (although never really beyond 60 minutes long). Cavalieri’s Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo is an example of one of these works, but technically it is not an oratorio because it features acting and dancing. It does, however, contain music in the monodic style. The first oratorio to be called by that name is Pietro della Valle’s Oratorio della Purificazione, but due to its brevity (only 12 minutes long) and the fact that its other name was “dialogue,” we can see that there was much ambiguity in these names.\n\n1650–1700\n\nDuring the second half of the 17th century, there were trends toward the secularization of the religious oratorio. Evidence of this lies in its regular performance outside church halls in courts and public theaters. Whether religious or secular, the theme of an oratorio is meant to be weighty. It could include such topics as Creation, the life of Jesus, or the career of a classical hero or biblical prophet. Other changes eventually took place as well, possibly because most composers of oratorios were also popular composers of operas. They began to publish the librettos of their oratorios as they did for their operas. Strong emphasis was soon placed on arias, while the use of the choir diminished. Female singers became regularly employed and replaced the male narrator with the use of recitatives.\n\nBy the mid 17th century, two types had developed:\n\noratorio volgare (in Italian)—representative examples include:\n\nGiacomo Carissimi’s Daniele\n\nMarco Marazzoli’s S Tomaso\n\nsimilar works written by Francesco Foggia and Luigi Rossi\n\nLasting about 30–60 minutes, oratorio volgares were performed in two sections separated by a sermon; their music resembles that of contemporary operas and chamber cantatas.\n\noratorio latino (in Latin)—first developed at the Oratorio del Santissimo Crocifisso, related to the church of San Marcello al Corso in Rome.\n\nThe most significant composer of oratorio latino was Giacomo Carissimi, whose Jephte is regarded as the first masterpiece of the genre. Like most other Latin oratorios of the period, it is in one section only.\n\nThe Late Baroque Oratorio\n\nIn the late Baroque, oratorios increasingly became “sacred opera.” In Rome and Naples, Alessandro Scarlatti was the most noted composer. In Vienna, the court poet Metastasio produced annually a series of oratorios for the court that were set by Caldara, Hasse, and others. Metastasio’s best known oratorio libretto, La passione di Gesa Cristo, was set by at least 35 composers from 1730 to 1790. In Germany, the middle Baroque oratorios moved from the early Baroque Historia-style Christmas and Resurrection settings of Heinrich Schatz, to the Passions of J. S. Bach, and oratorio passions such as Der Tod Jesu set by Telemann and Carl Heinrich Graun. After Telemann came the galante oratorio style of C. P. E. Bach.\n\nhttps://library.achievingthedream.org/alamomusicappreciation/chapter/introduction-to-instrumental-music-in-the-baroque/ Tue, 24 Mar 2020 04:51:59 +0000\n\nThis section contains materials on the major instrumental genres of the Baroque period, including sonata, suite, and concerto. You’ll also find information on the composers who worked in those genres. As with our study of vocal music, we’re going to hold off on studying the work of the best known composers of the late Baroque until you get to the next section. Bach and Handel each composed masterworks in almost all the genres of the period. As mentioned previously, their music represents the culmination of Baroque style, so we’ll put the reading material on Bach and Handel in a separate section.\n\nThis section includes the following pages:\n\nSlideshow: Instrumental Music in the Baroque\n\nSonata\n\nArcangelo Corelli\n\nSonata in B flat Major, Opus 5 No. 2: II Allegro\n\nConcerto\n\nAntonio Vivaldi\n\nThe Four Seasons\n\nSuite\n\nThe Baroque period saw a flowering of instrumental music. While the church continued to be an important patron of the arts, many Baroque composers found employment in the service of a nobleman or noblewoman who wished his or her court to be a center of culture and music. Such courtly settings demanded much more instrumental music for entertainment and concerts. These performances generally did not take place in enormous concert halls, but in more modest sized rooms or chambers in the palace. Music for these smaller settings is accordingly called chamber music. The sonata is one of the primary genres of chamber music in the Baroque.\n\nThe name sonata comes from the Latin and Italian verb sonare, which can be literally translated as “to sound” and refers to the fact that the music is sounded or played on instruments rather than sung by voices. The Latin and Italian word meaning “to sing” is cantare, which is where the name for one of the vocal genres you’ve already studied comes from—namely, cantata.\n\nAlthough the sonata is an important genre, it is important to note that this was a period of great innovation and experimentation in instrumental music. The term sonata is applied to a wide variety of instrumental combinations and forms. The majority of Baroque sonatas featured three or four instruments, but many sonatas were for a solo instrument, most often with continuo, though sometimes without. The most popular type of sonata in the Baroque was the trio sonata, so called because it was written with three lines: two melodic instruments (usually two violins) and a continuo. As the continuo line was performed by two instruments (usually cello and harpsichord), a trio sonata was generally performed by four instruments, though it is important to remember that in the Baroque, it was very common to substitute one instrument for another or even leave out an instrumental part if it wasn’t available. That flexibility in instrumentation is far less common in later historical periods.\n\nAs with the cantata, in the mid-Baroque, there was a tendency to divide trio sonatas into two categories: sonata da camera and sonata da chiesa. Although those names indicate music for court vs. music for church, the reality is that both types were often used as concert pieces. We won’t concern ourselves with this distinction, as it had largely disappeared by the late Baroque. However, it is important to note, as you’ll see those terms in the list of sample pieces presented below.\n\nTrio Sonata\n\nThe trio sonatas by Arcangelo Corelli (opus 1, 1681; opus 3, 1689) were of unparalleled influence during his lifetime and for a long time after, inspiring slavish imitation by composers whose numbers were legion (Talbot 2001).\n\nThe melody instruments used are often both violins. A well known exception is the trio sonata in Johann Sebastian Bach’s The Musical Offering, which is for violin and flute.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach’s trio sonatas for organ (BWV 525–530) combine all three parts on one instrument. Typically the right hand, left hand and pedals will each take a different part, thus creating the same texture as in a trio. A further innovation by Bach was the trio sonatas involving a concertante (obbligato) right hand harpsichord part in addition to the bass line, plus one melodic instrument, thus for two players. Examples are the six sonatas for harpsichord and solo violin (BWV 1014–1019), three sonatas for harpsichord and viola da gamba (BWV 1027–1029), and three sonatas for harpsichord and flute (BWV 1030–1032).\n\nExample Repertoire\n\nTomaso Albinoni, 12 sonatas da chiesa op. 1 and 12 sonatas da camera op. 8.\n\nArcangelo Corelli, 24 sonatas da chiesa opp. 1 and 3; 24 sonatas da camera opp. 2 and 4.\n\nHenry Purcell, 12 sonatas of three parts, 1683; 10 sonatas in four parts, 1697 (both sets for two violins and BC).\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach, trio sonatas BWV 1036–1039. Some of these are of doubtful attribution, but all are typical of baroque chamber music. They are written for basso continuo and two violins, except 1039, which is written for two flutes and basso continuo (which concurs with BWV 1027).\n\nDieterich Buxtehude, op. 1, six trio sonatas, and op. 2, seven trio sonatas. Scored for violin, viola da gamba, and basso continuo. These were the only works by Buxtehude that were published during his lifetime.\n\nGeorge Frideric Handel, trio sonatas opp. 2 and 5.\n\nGeorg Philipp Telemann, around 150 trio sonatas, most in the Corelli style.\n\nJohann Pachelbel, Musikalische Ergazung (“Musical Delight”), containing 6 trio sonatas for two violins and basso continuo. Original score in scordatura.\n\nAntonio Vivaldi, 12 trio sonatas da camera op. 1; 2 trio sonatas mixed with solo sonatas in op. 5; and about 10 unpublished trios.\n\nJan Dismas Zelenka, Six trio (or quartet) sonatas, ZWV 181. Scored for two oboes, bassoon, and basso continuo. These are technically difficult pieces, containing some extremely demanding bassoon and oboe parts. The fourth sonata from the set (G minor) can be heard at the Brightcecilia Classical Music Forums.\n\nArcangelo Corelli\n\nThis web page provides a concise biography of Arcangelo Corelli, a middle Baroque composer of considerable influence, especially on violin music, despite writing a relatively small amount of music. The first three paragraphs detail his life and significance in the history of the period, while the later paragraphs provide an overview of the genres in which he did most of his work.\n\nThe Corelli Violin Sonatas Op. 5 review is not a description of the characteristics of the listening example itself but rather a review of the performance. This course is not particularly focused on having you read reviews, but this review discusses an important element of Baroque music—namely, improvisation.\n\nThe performers in this recording don’t just play the notes that Corelli wrote down. They improvise (make up on the spot) additional notes to enliven the performance. There is no question that Baroque musicians were expected to be able to improvise music in much the same way jazz musicians do today. J. S. Bach was known to be a particularly skilled improviser who once, when presented with a complex melodic theme by Frederick II of Prussia, spontaneously performed a three voice fugue on the theme at the king’s request. Improvisation is not prioritized today in classical training, but it is thought to have been so commonly expected in the Baroque era that many composers did not feel it necessary to write out everything on the page, on the assumption that a skilled performer would understand what needed to be filled in. The performers in the recording reviewed are known for their improvisatory interpretations of Baroque works, and they have applied that approach to all the sonatas that make up Corelli’s Opus No. 5.\n\nSpeaking of this particular opus by Corelli, let’s look at all the numbers in the title of this piece. Opus 5 is a collection of twelve violin sonatas. The first eleven sonatas are four or five movements each, while the 12th is a set of variations set in a single movement. Our listening example comes from the second sonata in the collection, hence the designation Opus 5 No. 2. Furthermore, our listening example is the second movement from that sonata and features a fast tempo. The Italian term for fast is “allegro.” This is why the title ends with the Roman numeral followed by the Italian term (II. Allegro). One last thing: this piece is not a trio sonata. The trio sonata was the most popular form of sonata in the Baroque, and Corelli elevated the genre with his own trio sonata compositions, so it is important you understand that genre. But our listening example is simply a sonata for solo violin with continuo. Furthermore, in the spirit of Baroque flexibility (Baroque musicians thought nothing of substituting one instrument for another or leaving one out if a player wasn’t available), the continuo part on our recording is played by harpsichord alone—no cello.\n\nConcerto\n\nThere are two kinds of concerto that were composed in the Baroque period: concerto grosso and solo concerto. This link will take you to a very interesting summary of the two types of concerto. Even though this site is quite concise in its written descriptions of the two genres, the listening examples embedded in the that page really help clarify a point that can be confusing to students the first time they encounter the concerto grosso—namely, the roles of the concertino and the ripieno (also known as tutti). The examples will make it easier for you to hear the difference between the smaller and larger groups that provide the contrast in a concerto grosso.\n\nHere is one clarification to something stated near the end of the linked article: it mentions that Antonio Vivaldi, who you’ll read about soon, “wrote many solo concertos and in particular for oboe, flute, and bassoon.” This might give you the impression that the bulk of his works were for those instruments. That is not the case. He wrote over 500 concertos (solo and grosso), 350 of which were for solo instruments. The majority of those solo concertos (230) were for solo violin, which is not surprising, given that Vivaldi was a virtuoso violinist. I think they mentioned those additional instruments because there are relatively few concertos written for wind instruments, so his works for those and other instruments stand out in the literature.\n\nConcerto Grosso\n\nNow, let’s take a more in depth look at concerto grosso. Notice the important role that Corelli plays in developing this genre into something that many other composers would want to work with, and in Corelli’s overall style no less. As with previous genres, there was, for a time, a division into chiesa and camera forms.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe concerto grosso (Italian for big concert[o], plural concerti grossi) is a form of baroque music in which the musical material is passed between a small group of soloists (the concertino) and full orchestra (the ripieno or concerto grosso).\n\nThe form developed in the late 17th century, although the name was not used at first. Alessandro Stradella seems to have written the first music in which two groups of different sizes are combined in the characteristic way. The name was first used by Giovanni Lorenzo Gregori in a set of 10 compositions published in Lucca in 1698.\n\nThe first major composer to use the term concerto grosso was Arcangelo Corelli. After Corelli’s death, a collection of 12 of his concerti grossi was published; not long after, composers such as Francesco Geminiani, Pietro Locatelli, and Giuseppe Torelli wrote concertos in the style of Corelli. He also had a strong influence on Antonio Vivaldi.\n\nTwo distinct forms of the concerto grosso exist: the concerto da chiesa (church concert) and the concerto da camera (chamber concert). The concerto da chiesa alternated slow and fast movements; the concerto da camera had the character of a suite, being introduced by a prelude and incorporating popular dance forms. These distinctions blurred over time.\n\nCorelli’s concertino group was invariably two violins and a cello, with a string section as a ripieno group. Both were accompanied by a basso continuo with some combination of harpsichord, organ, lute, or theorbo. Handel wrote several collections of concerti grossi, and several of the Brandenburg Concertos by Bach also loosely follow the concerto grosso form.\n\nThe concerto grosso form was superseded by the solo concerto and the sinfonia concertante in the late 18th century, and new examples of the form did not appear for more than a century. In the 20th century, the concerto grosso has been used by composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Ernest Bloch, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Bohuslav Martinů, Malcolm Williamson, Henry Cowell, Alfred Schnittke, William Bolcom, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Andrei Eshpai, Eino Tamberg, Krzysztof Penderecki, Jean Françaix, and Philip Glass. While Edward Elgar may not be considered a modern composer, his romantic Introduction and Allegro strongly resembled the instrumentation setup of a concerto grosso.\n\nConcertino\n\nA concertino, literally “little ensemble,” is the smaller group of instruments in a concerto grosso. This is opposed to the ripieno and tutti, which is the larger group contrasting with the concertino.\n\nThough the concertino is the smaller of the two groups, its material is generally more virtuosic than that of the ripieno. Further, the concertino does not share thematic material with the ripieno but presents unique ideas. This contrast of small group to large group and one thematic group against another is very characteristic of Baroque ideology—similar to terraced dynamics, where the idea is significant contrast.\n\nSolo Concerto\n\nAs we’ve looked at concerto grosso, here’s a bit more detailed information on the solo concerto. Notice that the solo concerto has a bit more standard structure (three movements in a fast-slow-fast pattern) than the concerto grosso, though we must always remember that Baroque composers were not nearly as concerned about standardization of form as later Classical era composers were.\n\nIntroduction\n\nA solo concerto is a concerto in which a single soloist is accompanied by an orchestra. It is the most frequent type of concerto. It originated in the Baroque Period (ca. 1600–1750) as an alternative to the traditional concertino (solo group of instruments) in a concerto grosso.\n\nA typical concerto has three movements: traditionally fast, slow and lyrical, and fast. There are many examples of concertos that do not conform to this plan.\n\nBaroque\n\nThe earliest known solo concertos are nos. 6 and 12 of Giuseppe Torelli’s Op. 6 of 1698. These works employ both a three movement cycle and clear (if diminutive) ritornello form, like that of the ripieno concerto, except that sections for the soloist and continuo separate the orchestral ritornellos. Active in Bologna, Torelli would have known of the operatic arias and the numerous sonatas and sinfonias for trumpet and strings produced in Bologna since the 1660s. He himself composed more than a dozen such works for trumpet, two dated in the early 1690s. Other early violin concertos are the four in Tomaso Albinoni’s Op. 2 (1700) and the six in Torelli’s important Op. 8 (1709; the other six works in this set are double concertos for two violins).\n\nThe most influential and prolific composer of concertos during the Baroque period was the Venetian Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741). In addition to his nearly 60 extant ripieno concertos, Vivaldi composed approximately 425 concertos for one or more soloists, including about 350 solo concertos (two thirds for solo violin) and 45 double concertos (over half for two violins). Vivaldi’s concertos firmly establish the three-movement form as the norm. The virtuosity of the solo sections increases markedly, especially in the later works, and concurrently the texture becomes more homophonic.\n\nConcertos for instruments other than violin began to appear early in the 18th century, including the oboe concertos of George Frideric Handel and the numerous concertos for flute, oboe, bassoon, cello, and other instruments by Vivaldi. The earliest organ concertos can probably be credited to Handel (16 concertos, ca. 1735–51) and the earliest harpsichord concertos to Johann Sebastian Bach (14 concertos for one to four harpsichords, ca. 1735–40). In the latter case, all but probably one of the concertos are arrangements of existing works, though Bach had already approached the idea of a harpsichord concerto before 1721 in the Brandenburg Concerto No. 5.\n\nAntonio Vivaldi\n\nAntonio Vivaldi was certainly a major composer of the late Baroque, but his enduring legacy is generally concentrated in a single genre: the concerto. Vivaldi was a prolific composer and producer of opera and was very successful in his day, but his operatic compositions are not nearly as widely performed today as his concertos.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAntonio Lucio Vivaldi (4 March 1678–28 July 1741) was an Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher, and cleric. Born in Venice, he is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. He is known mainly for composing many instrumental concertos for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty operas. His best known work is a series of violin concertos known as The Four Seasons.\n\nMany of his compositions were written for the female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Pieta, a home for abandoned children where Vivaldi (who had been ordained as a Catholic priest) was employed from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua, and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for preferment. However, the emperor died soon after Vivaldi’s arrival, and Vivaldi himself died less than a year later in poverty.\n\nLife\n\nAt the Conservatorio dell’Ospedale della Pietà\n\nIn September 1703, Vivaldi became maestro di violino (master of violin) at an orphanage called the Pio Ospedale della Pietà (Devout Hospital of Mercy) in Venice. While Vivaldi is most famous as a composer, he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well. The German architect Johann Friedrich Armand von Uffenbach referred to Vivaldi as “the famous composer and violinist” and said that “Vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently, and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy [an improvised cadenza] which absolutely astounded me, for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played, or ever will play, in such a fashion.”\n\nVivaldi was only 25 when he started working at the Ospedale della Pietà. Over the next 30 years, he composed most of his major works while working there. There were four similar institutions in Venice; their purpose was to give shelter and education to children who were abandoned or orphaned or whose families could not support them. They were financed by funds provided by the Republic. The boys learned a trade and had to leave when they reached 15. The girls received a musical education, and the most talented stayed and became members of the Ospedale’s renowned orchestra and choir.\n\nShortly after Vivaldi’s appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad too. Vivaldi wrote concertos, cantatas, and sacred vocal music for them. These sacred works, which number over 60, are varied: they included solo motets and large scale choral works for soloists, double chorus, and orchestra. In 1704, the position of teacher of viola all’inglese was added to his duties as violin instructor. The position of maestro di coro, which was at one time filled by Vivaldi, required a lot of time and work. He had to compose an oratorio or concerto at every feast and teach the orphans both music theory and how to play certain instruments.\n\nHis relationship with the board of directors of the Ospedale was often strained. The board had to take a vote every year on whether to keep a teacher. The vote on Vivaldi was seldom unanimous and went 7 to 6 against him in 1709. After a year as a freelance musician, he was recalled by the Ospedale with a unanimous vote in 1711; clearly during his year’s absence, the board realized the importance of his role. He became responsible for all of the musical activity of the institution when he was promoted to maestro de’ concerti (music director) in 1716.\n\nIn 1705, the first collection (Connor Cassara) of his works was published by Giuseppe Sala: his Opus 1 is a collection of 12 sonatas for two violins and basso continuo in a conventional style. In 1709, a second collection of 12 sonatas for violin and basso continuo appeared, his Opus 2. A real breakthrough as a composer came with his first collection of 12 concerti for one, two, and four violins with strings, L’estro armonico Opus 3, which was published in Amsterdam in 1711 by Estienne Roger, dedicated to Grand Prince Ferdinand of Tuscany. The prince sponsored many musicians, including Alessandro Scarlatti and George Frideric Handel. He was a musician himself, and Vivaldi probably met him in Venice. L’estro armonico was a resounding success all over Europe. It was followed in 1714 by La stravaganza Opus 4, a collection of concerti for solo violin and strings dedicated to an old violin student of Vivaldi’s, the Venetian noble Vettor Dolfin.\n\nIn February 1711, Vivaldi and his father traveled to Brescia, where his setting of the Stabat Mater (RV 621) was played as part of a religious festival. The work seems to have been written in haste: the string parts are simple, the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three, and not all the text is set. Nevertheless, perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music, the work is one of his early masterpieces.\n\nDespite his frequent travels from 1718, the Pieta paid him 2 sequins to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in Venice. The Pietà’s records show that he was paid for 140 concerti between 1723 and 1733.\n\nOpera Impresario\n\nIn early 18th century Venice, opera was the most popular musical entertainment. It proved most profitable for Vivaldi. There were several theaters competing for the public’s attention. Vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline: his first opera, Ottone in villa (RV 729), was performed not in Venice but at the Garzerie Theater in Vicenza in 1713. The following year, Vivaldi became the impresario of the Teatro San Angelo in Venice, where his opera Orlando finto pazzo (RV 727) was performed. The work was not to the public’s taste, and it closed after a couple of weeks, being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year.\n\nIn 1715, he presented Nerone fatto Cesare (RV 724, now lost), with music by seven different composers, of which he was the leader. The opera contained 11 arias and was a success. In the late season, Vivaldi planned to put on an opera composed entirely by him, Arsilda, regina di Ponto (RV 700), but the state censor blocked the performance. The main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man. Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success.\n\nAt this period, the Pietà commissioned several liturgical works. The most important were two oratorios. Moyses Deus Pharaonis (RV 643) is lost. The second, Juditha triumphans (RV 644), celebrates the victory of the Republic of Venice against the Turks and the recapture of the island of Corfu. Composed in 1716, it is one of his sacred masterpieces. All 11 singing parts were performed by girls of the Pieta, both the female and male roles. Many of the arias include parts for solo instruments such as recorders, oboes, violas d’amore, and mandolin that showcased the range of talents of the girls.\n\nAlso in 1716, Vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas, L’incoronazione di Dario (RV 719) and La costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi (RV 706). The latter was so popular that it performed two years later, reedited and retitled Artabano re dei Parti (RV 701, now lost). It was also performed in Prague in 1732. In the following years, Vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over Italy.\n\nHis progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians, like Benedetto Marcello, a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a pamphlet denouncing him and his operas. The pamphlet, Il teatro alla moda, attacks Vivaldi without mentioning him directly. The cover drawing shows a boat (the Sant’ Angelo), on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest’s hat and playing the violin. The Marcello family claimed ownership of the Teatro Sant’ Angelo, and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution, without success. The obscure writing under the picture mentions nonexistent places and names: ALDIVIVA is an anagram of A. Vivaldi.\n\nIn a letter written by Vivaldi to his patron Marchese Bentivoglio in 1737, he makes reference to his “94 operas."
