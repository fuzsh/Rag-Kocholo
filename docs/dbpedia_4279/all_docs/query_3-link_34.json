        "text": "CHAPTER II\n\nA PERIOD OF CONFLICT—CHANCELLOR VS. ANNEXATIONISTS (JUNE 1915–AUGUST 1916)\n\nSINCE WE ARE dealing with a subject which does not show any clear subdivisions, organization may easily seem arbitrary. There are no natural highlights in the history of German war aims during the first part of the war as there are during the second with the Peace Note of December 1916, or the Peace Resolution of July 1917. The end of May 1915, was simply chosen as a convenient break since at this time we find the first clear and public statement on the part of the German government (i. e., Bethmann Hollweg) in favor of an expansionist peace. There was no change in developments after this date. The main trends continued: growing support of large war aims in the public statements of the government, paralleled, strangely enough, by an increasing cleavage between the German Chancellor and the more violent annexationists. The explanation for this paradox is that, as Bethmann’s statements on war aims grew stronger, his private views on the subject yielded to his increasing pessimism and became more and more moderate. His fatal vacillation, keynote of the early period, thus lasted into the second year of the war.\n\nCertain new elements, however, were injected into the controversy over war aims during this period. The hardships resulting from heavy fighting on several fronts, and the growing scarcity of vital necessities of life due to the blockade, aroused in the majority of Germans a longing for the speedy termination of war. Whether this was to be achieved through a peace of understanding on the basis of the status quo ante (involving the renunciation of all territorial gains), or through a peace of victory, dealing a deadly blow to Germany’s most dangerous adversary, Great Britain (by means of the newly developed submarine weapon) were questions which helped to intensify the already existing strife inside Germany and to widen the split which the controversy over war aims had reopened among the German people. Another factor, first prominent in this period, was the development of a German administration in the conquered regions of the west. Beginning shortly after the outbreak of war, Germany’s policy, especially in Belgium, began to show certain marked trends which, better than mere governmental declarations, indicated her true aims in those regions. And finally, it is in this period that the first traces appeared of that rivalry between the civil authority vested in the Chancellor, and the military authority which, though theoretically vested in the Emperor, came increasingly under the influence of the Chief of the General Staff. This dualism did not become acute until after the change in the army’s Supreme Command at the end of August 1916, when General von Falkenhayn was replaced by Field Marshal von Hindenburg and his close associate, General Ludendorff. Yet the first indications of a difference of opinion between the civil and military departments of the government about the future of Western Europe already appear in the second year of the war. With the change of command in August 1916, the division of opinion, which ran through the whole German people, definitely invaded the government of the German Reich.\n\nDualism of Bethmann Hollweg’s Policy\n\nThe vacillation which the German Chancellor had shown in his statements on war aims during the first year continued during the second. There was moderation, such as his promise to Hungary’s Foreign Minister Count Tisza, that Germany would not endanger the chances for an early peace through exaggerated territorial demands;1 or again his statement to Conrad Haussmann that he “wanted only as much Belgian territory as was absolutely necessary for political and strategic reasons.”2 Yet in his public statements the Chancellor reiterated and even enlarged, the vague promises of his early speeches. On August 1, 1915, first anniversary of the outbreak of war, an Imperial proclamation, approved by Bethmann, promised the German people “a peace which offers the necessary military, political, and economic securities for our future, and which fulfills the conditions for the unhindered development of our creative forces at home and on the free seas.”3 The “real guarantees and securities” of May 28, are here more closely defined as “military, political, and economic,” and the concept “freedom of the seas” has been added. Before this proclamation appeared, the annexationists were quite worried, because it was rumored that it would again state that the war was not one of conquest and that Germany did not intend to expand her continental frontiers.4 But only the first part of the rumor turned out to be true, and then the reference was in the past tense: “It was not lust for conquest that brought us into the war,” the proclamation read. To such a statement the annexationists had no objection.\n\nShortly afterwards, on August 14-16, the Social Democrats framed their own declaration in which they demanded “the restitution of Belgium.”5 One of Bethmann’s aides, Under-Secretary Wahnschaffe, managed to suppress this section of the manifesto, even though he knew that the Chancellor was in absolute agreement with it. What he was afraid of was that “the military authorities might raise objections.”6 Here we have a first indication that the government’s war aims policy was opposed not only by the annexationists but by its own military men as well.\n\nIn the meantime, Bethmann Hollweg’s vacillation continued. On August 19 he told the Reichstag: “Germany must so cement and strengthen her position, that the other powers will lose their taste for a renewal of their encirclement policy. We must gain the freedom of the seas for our own protection and that of all peoples.”7 These words found the undivided approval of the annexationist press.8 Yet when he was discussing the future of Belgium privately with Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, the Chancellor reverted to his moderate views.9\n\nA further example of the Chancellor’s straddling on war aims came on the occasion of a Socialist interpellation in the Reichstag on December 9, 1915, which asked the government to enter into peace negotiations as soon as possible.10 Bethmann made two speeches, one before and one in answer to the interpellation. The first speech ended on the usual vague note: “We continue with determination the struggle which our enemies have wished upon us, so as to attain what Germany’s future demands from us.”11 Later, after the Socialist Scheidemann’s speech, the Chancellor became more specific:\n\nOne thing our enemies must realize: the longer and more ardently they wage this war against us, the more the guarantees, necessary for ourselves, will increase. Neither in the East nor in the West shall our present enemies have at their disposal gates of invasion, through which to threaten us anew and more seriously than in the past.… We must defend ourselves politically and militarily and must secure the possibility of our economic development.… This war can only end with a peace which, as far as is humanly possible, will give us securities against our adversaries.12\n\nThe jingo press acclaimed the speech and gave it the usual annexationist slant.13 Yet in the very same speech, Bethmann also said: “We do not carry on this struggle, which has been forced upon us, to subject foreign peoples, but to protect our life and our liberty! For the German government, this war has remained what it was from the beginning and what it has remained in all our proclamations: the defensive war of the German people.”14 It was this latter statement which caused Scheidemann to say: “With this speech the Chancellor once again had moved away from the German annexationists, whose hatred, consequently, pursued him to an ever growing extent.”15\n\nThe favorable reactions of both annexationists and anti-annexationists to Bethmann’s speech are an excellent illustration of the dual interpretation to which the Chancellor’s views on war aims lent themselves. However, in this case, the reactions were not entirely accidental or unforeseen. The speech of Bethmann had been conceived from the start as a compromise.16 A week before it was delivered, the Chancellor granted an interview to delegates from the annexationist parties, to agree on the procedure to be followed during the session of December 9. On this occasion, Bethmann gave an outline of his contemplated speech, to which Bassermann and Westarp objected because it did not sufficiently stress Germany’s territorial ambitions. The Chancellor, in turn, opposed the more radical demands of the annexationists, not on general principle, but because too heavy demands might spoil the chances for a negotiated peace. Finally a compromise, suggested by the Progessive leader von Payer, was accepted by all present. To make sure that this compromise would also meet the approval of the anti-annexationist Socialists, Bethmann discussed his speech of December 9 with Scheidemann as well. The latter, in return, gave Bethmann the contents of his interpellation and the Chancellor expressed his approval.17 On December 9 both men delivered their pre-arranged speeches.18\n\nDespite this continuous ambiguity in Bethmann Hollweg’s statements on war aims, however, there can be little doubt that the Chancellor’s views were closer to those of the Socialists than to those of the annexationists. In a memorandum to the Prussian Minister of the Interior, dated December 9, 1915, Bethmann warmly defended the Socialists against von Loebell’s accusation, that it was they who had started the controversy over war aims and that the Kriegszielbewegung of the Right was merely a countermove against this Socialist agitation. Bethmann Hollweg, on the contrary, held that the moderate position of the Socialists gave the parties of the Right a welcome excuse to reopen their traditional fight against the Left, temporarily interrupted by the Burgfriede.19\n\nNevertheless the Chancellor’s vacillating policy continued. Shortly after his Reichstag speech he suggested to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the German Bundesrat “the creation of a customs union and a mutually protective alliance between Germany and Belgium.”20 Towards the end of January 1916, in a conversation with Colonel House (who was then on his second European mission), “the Chancellor intimated that Germany would be willing to evacuate both France and Belgium, if an indemnity were paid.”21 In March, speaking to the representatives of the press, Bethmann advised moderation in the discussion of war aims. “He did not consider it wise to bluff with far-reaching annexationist demands and then become more and more modest.”22 Still the Chancellor failed to take his own advice; because in his address on April 5, 1916, he made his most specific reference to the future of Western Europe in general and of Belgium in particular:\n\nCan anyone believe that we shall give up areas which we have occupied in the west, on which the blood of our people has been spilled, without gaining complete security for our future? We shall secure real guarantees for ourselves, so that Belgium will not become an Anglo-French vassal state, and be made a military and economic outpost against Germany. Here, too, will be no status quo ante. Here, too, fate will not retrace its steps. Germany cannot again abandon to Verwelschung [Latinization] the tribe of the Flemings, which has been kept down so long.23\n\nAgain the annexationist press hailed the Chancellor’s stand, in which some papers saw an endorsement of the famous demands of the Six Economic Organizations.24 The reference to the Flemings gains added significance in the light of simultaneous governmental policy in Belgium, which we shall discuss at greater length below.\n\nIn view of the constant discrepancy between Bethmann Hollweg’s public and private views, it should not surprise us to find him making one of his most pessimistic statements only a little more than a week after he had given the above speech. On April 13, 1916, he wrote on the margin of a petition demanding the free discussion of war aims:\n\nWe should not think of something very wonderful in connection with this famous discussion of war aims. Our situation at the end of the war will not be such that we can choose freely among a series of entirely different possibilities. We shall rather try to make of the situation whatever we can. As far as there will be a choice, it will be limited by the fact that Belgium, colonies, and a large indemnity cannot all be had. The value of colonies and an indemnity will have to be balanced against the value of Belgian guarantees.25\n\nSuch were the German Chancellor’s public and private declarations on war aims up to the spring of 1916. As the year progressed, they became more and more pessimistic, a fact easily explained by military reverses—the failure of the German army to win a decisive victory at Verdun, and the entry of Rumania into the war in August. But how are we to explain his previous vacillating policy in the second half of 1915 and early 1916?\n\nHere also military factors played an important part. After Germany’s advance in the west had been halted in late 1914, and the Russian threat in the east had been overcome, the war had become one of position, in which existing military strength was pretty evenly distributed between the Central and Allied Powers. As far as intrinsic military power and potential were concerned, however, the Allies definitely held the upper hand. It was merely a question of time before their superiority of matériel and manpower would crush the resistance of Germany and her allies, whose only salvation lay in a concentrated use of all forces on land and sea. Consequently on February 4, the German Admiralty stepped up its U-boat activity in the waters adjacent to the British Isles, thus embarking on a course which had the gravest consequences. Simultaneously, the Army Supreme Command decided to direct its main land offensive against the eastern front. Between May and September 1915, the concerted efforts of German and Austro-Hungarian armies pushed the Russian forces out of Poland and Galicia and advanced the front far into the plains of Eastern Europe. They failed, however, to achieve the decisive annihilation of the Russian army, partly due to differences of opinion between the Chief of the General Staff, von Falkenhayn, and the commanders of the eastern front, Hindenburg and Ludendorff. At the same time, a concentrated Anglo-French offensive in the west near Arras and on the Champagne sector made exclusive operations on the eastern front impossible. Italy’s entrance into the war and the Allied expedition against the Dardanelles, further limited the freedom of action of the Central Powers.\n\nYet the military results of 1915, though not decisive, were sufficiently impressive outwardly to keep alive the optimism of a large section of the German people. It is this very fact which further helps to explain the Chancellor’s dual attitude towards war aims. The military situation was never bad enough to make possible a public renunciation of all annexationist aims (such as the Socialists demanded). At the same time, extremely annexationist statements were equally unwarranted. None of the military successes had dealt a decisive blow to one of Germany’s adversaries, and it became increasingly clear that perhaps the only way to break a link of the chain which the Allies had forged around Central Europe was through a negotiated peace with one of the encircling powers. Such a peace, however, would have necessitated the abandonment of at least some of Germany’s war aims and would have called for a certain moderation in the government’s public statements. Instead, these statements became ever more extreme.\n\nBefore we analyze further the policy of Bethmann Hollweg a few words about the attempts at a negotiated peace. We have already seen how negotiations with Russia were started in early 1915. These efforts, favored by certain groups within the army and navy, and pursued through the remainder of 1915 and into 1916, had no success.26 The vast areas Germany held after the summer offensive in Eastern Europe, plus the hardships which East Prussia had suffered at the hands of the Russians in the early days of the war, made an extension of Germany’s frontier in the east equally, if not more desirable than expansion to the west. To curtail the power of Russian despotism was looked upon with favor by the Social Democrats, to whom Russia was the chief enemy. It was in the east, finally, that German agrarian interests hoped to reap tangible rewards for their support of industrial aims in Western Europe.\n\nAs to the chances for a separate peace with the western powers, the numerous attempts at a settlement with Russia naturally limited Germany’s efforts in that direction. France’s aim to recover the lost provinces, moreover, made peace with her difficult, if not impossible, since the majority of Germans, including most Socialists, were against the return of Alsace-Lorraine.27 “Whoever raises the knife to cut pieces from the body of the German people,” the Socialist Landsberg had said in the Reichstag, “no matter where he applies it, will meet the German people, united in defense, and ready to knock the knife from his hand.”28\n\nThe popular hatred of England and the simultaneous interest in Belgium made a settlement with the second great western power equally difficult. The British blockade and the German submarine retaliation all added fuel to the flames. The time was not ripe as yet for an agreement with England.29 In February 1916, the Allies guaranteed the restitution of Belgium, and in May made a similar declaration on the integrity of the Belgian Congo.30 The Drang nach Westen, like the Drang nach Osten was incompatible with a separate peace. Yet even so, innumerable minor efforts, direct and through neutral channels, were made to bring about the end of war. They did not assume serious proportions until late in 1916, when Germany’s attempt to exhaust her western opponents through the Verdun offensive had proved equally costly to both sides.31 When in the second half of 1916 the initiative suddenly shifted from the Central Powers to the Allies, when the Russian offensive in the Bukovina, the Italian attacks on the Isonzo front, and the Anglo-French offensive on the Somme were followed up by Rumania’s declaration of war in August, a quest for peace began in Germany which culminated in the official peace offer of the German government on December 12, 1916.\n\nIf the military situation was sufficiently favorable until early 1916 to justify the hope for German territorial gains, it was by no means favorable enough to justify the hopes for the far-reaching expansion which the Chancellor’s official statements aroused. Why, then—we must qualify our earlier question—did Bethmann Hollweg not present the moderate aims which he uttered privately, to the German people? One explanation we have already found in his sincere desire to maintain domestic peace and internal unity through a middle-of-the-road policy. To this we must add as influential factors pressures of two kinds: On the one hand pressure from governmental agencies and individuals, public opinion and annexationists, and on the other hand, pressure of circumstances growing out of Germany’s policy in the occupied areas of Western Europe.\n\nThe War Aims of Other Public Figures\n\nAs far as pressure from other governmental agencies is concerned, it may seem strange that in our discussion of Germany’s war aims policy thus far we have concentrated on the Reich’s Chancellor and have almost completely ignored the Kaiser. The reason is that William II, weighed down by many responsibilities, withdrew almost entirely as the war progressed, accepting the policy of his Chancellor and his Chief of Staff instead of suggesting his own. As a result, Bethmann Hollweg gained a political position such as no other Chancellor had ever held under William II. In the field of war aims, the Emperor, except for occasional oratorical outbursts, followed closely in the footsteps of his Chancellor, at least during the first years of the war. Since the Battle of the Marne, so Bethmann Hollweg tells us,\n\nthe Kaiser always agreed with me, that if we only held our own, we had already won the war. Once in a while, when his generals announced great victories, his impetuous temperament carried him away into making different statements.… But never did the unequalled military feats of his army seriously give him the faintest idea of satisfying with German blood a desire for world domination, which was alien to him.32\n\nThe heir to the German throne, Crown Prince Wilhelm, under the influence of Conservative expansionists, at first tended to be less moderate than his father. His political adviser, Baron von Maltzahn, helped temporarily to make him the rallying point of Conservative opposition against the moderate policy of the government.33 Yet as early as December 1915, young William showed signs of moderation in a memorandum which advised the conclusion of a separate peace, preferably with Great Britain.34\n\nWhile the Kaiser was in accord with his Chancellor’s moderation, the heads of some of the other federal states were more radical. We have already mentioned the demand to annex Belgium, which the Grand Duke of Oldenburg tried to bring before the Kaiser via the King of Bavaria.35 In March 1915, he added to this demand a large section of northern France.36 Duke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenburg, as president of the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, hoped for a powerful African Empire as well as a series of naval and commercial stations.37 By far the most numerous annexationist pronouncements were made by King Ludwig III of Bavaria. As early as August 1914, he had visited Imperial Headquarters trying to urge upon William II the annexation of Belgium and northern France and their incorporation into Prussia. Bavaria, in that case, should be given compensations in the south, perhaps Alsace-Lorraine. Bethmann at the time managed to prevent the King from bringing the matter before the Kaiser.38 In October and December 1914, Ludwig began dropping vague hints to the effect that after a German victory all would not be as before the war.39 His most important statement came on June 7, 1915, at a dinner given by the Bayrischer Kanalverein in Fürth. “Russia’s declaration of war,” he said, “was followed by that of France; and when in addition the English fell upon us, I said: I am happy about it, I am happy, because now we can settle accounts with our enemies, because now—and that particularly concerns the Kanalverein—we gain a direct outlet from the Rhine into the Sea.”40 This reference to the mouth of the Rhine did little to soothe the already existing fears of the Dutch about their future in case Germany should annex Belgium. To cover up this blunder, it was said that old Ludwig did not realize the mouth of the Rhine was in the hands of the Dutch.41 But still, the fact that the King of Bavaria “who surely must be most reliably informed on our military situation,” made such optimistic statements, left little doubt in the minds of less well-informed people “that we shall be able, at the conclusion of peace, to put our hand on Belgium.”42 Ludwig III continued throughout 1915 and 1916 to adhere to his earlier aims.43 The hope for western annexations and for a corresponding Bavarian hold over Alsace also increased the always prominent particularism of Bavaria during the war.44 In contrast to his father, the Bavarian Crown Prince Rupprecht soon gave up his initial hopes for an annexationist peace. From the beginning of 1915 he maintained that Germany should not only give up and completely restore Belgium, but that she should renounce all conquests and seek a peace of understanding.45 Rupprecht ultimately became one of the leading forces of moderation in German war aims policy.\n\nExcept for such influence as they had on the formation of public opinion, the views of these various rulers had no bearing on the policy of the Empire. What influence there was of the federal states was exerted through the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Bundesrat, which likewise did not amount to much. The committee held some thirteen meetings during the war, of which the first did not take place until November 3, 1915. The procedure at each meeting was for the Chancellor or his Foreign Secretary to report on the foreign affairs of the Empire, after which questions might be asked. Opposition to or criticism of the government’s policy was never expressed.46\n\nAnother element of influence upon Bethmann Hollweg’s policy came from his various colleagues in the government, military and civilian. The Foreign Office followed closely the policy laid down by the Chancellor. The few private statements we find during this early period from Secretary of State von Jagow and Under-Secretary Zimmermann show the moderation we have already found in the Chancellor’s unofficial utterances. What official statements were made during the first part of the war were mainly the work of Bethmann Hollweg. In August 1915, and again in May 1916, von Jagow complained to Conrad Haussmann about the exaggeration shown in annexationist claims.47 On June 7, 1916, however, he wrote to the German ambassador in Washington, Count Bernstorff, expressing his skepticism of Wilson’s attempts at mediation, adding that “if the progress of the war were to continue favorable for us, a peace founded on the absolute status quo ante would be unacceptable.”48 Zimmermann’s views in various conversations with the Austrian journalist Kanner were similar.49 Colonial Secretary Solf continued his agitation for the return and extension of Germany’s colonial possessions.50 There was a general increase of colonial propaganda around the middle of 1916.51 In May, Solf hoped that Germany might “fill the gaps in her existing colonial empire.”52 A month later he added a new idea for which he was much maligned by various annexationists. To the latter German colonial expansion was only possible in conjunction with a strong anti-British naval policy. On the other hand, Solf, in an article published in the Weserzeitung, held that the control of the seas was not necessary to Germany’s colonial policy. “It is not Germany alone which possesses overseas colonies. Other nations do so too, and are not troubled about England’s dominion over the seas.… We ought to be able to make some day as strong a coalition against England as she has now made against us.”53 The press of the Right objected to such a solution.54 “Colonial and overseas policy,” Otto Hoetzsch wrote in the Kreuzzeitung, “are impossible without a fleet and a coast and unthinkable without the opposition against England.”55\n\nThe only real opposition within the government to the Chancellor’s moderation did not come from civilian, but from naval and military circles.56 For the navy, the annexation of the Belgian coast was of vital significance, since it considerably extended Germany’s coastline and in Antwerp presented her with one of the world’s outstanding ports. Admiral Tirpitz continued his agitation for the Flanders coast up to the time of his resignation over the submarine controversy in March of 1916.57 This controversy, though not directly related to the problem of war aims, helped to intensify the existing split between annexationists and moderates. The unlimited use of the submarine weapon was increasingly considered the only means of achieving a victorious end of the war, without which, so the annexationists felt, the whole German system would collapse. It was over the question of submarine warfare that the civil and military heads of the German government ran into one of their first serious disagreements.58 Up to 1916, Moltke, and after him Falkenhayn, had been too much preoccupied with military matters to interfere with problems beyond the sphere of their own department. They had made no official statement of their war aims, though in private conversation in February 1916, Falkenhayn stated: “If we give up Belgium, we are lost.”59 In a subsequent letter to Bethmann Hollweg, he became still more specific:\n\nAs far as the future of Belgium is concerned, there can be no doubt that the country must remain at our disposal as an area for the initial assembly of our troops, for the protection of the most important German industrial region, and as a hinterland for our position on the Flanders coast, which is indispensable for our maritime importance. From this demand automatically arises the necessity of unconditional military domination of Belgium by Germany.… Without this … Germany would lose the war in the West.60\n\nThese strategic arguments for keeping a firm hold over Belgium after the war had considerable military justification and it was understandable that the Chief of the General Staff should be eager to improve the unfavorable strategic position of his country.61 Nor were these aims of Falkenhayn in any way different from those stated by Bethmann Hollweg.\n\nThe policy of non-interference by the military in the governmental affairs of Germany came to an end after August 1916, when Hindenburg and Ludendorff took over the Supreme Command. In the light of subsequent developments, it is interesting to examine the relations between Bethmann and these two men, especially Ludendorff, during the early part of the war. Since their military skill (and that of General Hoffmann) had first halted and then pushed back the Russian forces during 1914-15, Hindenburg had become the most popular figure in Germany, and both he and his associate had become important political factors. “There was hardly a day,” a contemporary relates, “when ministers of state or other high officials, parliamentarians, industrialists, agriculturists, journalists, etc., did not come to Kowno, the headquarters of Ober-Ost.”62\n\nAt first relations between the two eastern commanders and Bethmann were friendly.63 General Ludendorff, the dominating figure of the team, in a series of enlightening letters to Alexander Wyneken, editor of the Königsberger Allgemeine Zeitung, repeatedly expressed his agreement with Bethmann Hollweg. On December 7, 1915, two days before Bethmann’s Reichstag address, Ludendorff had a long conversation with the Chancellor. “I found him in a thoroughly determined mood,” the General wrote to Wyneken, “and presented to him the views known to you.” Ludendorff’s aims apparently were more far-reaching than those of Bethmann in his speech of December 9. But he realized that “it is easy to speak and make demands for a man who does not have full responsibility. It is necessary to put oneself in the position of the responsible leader. To expect, at this stage, binding decisions from him would, in my opinion, be premature.”64 Yet even if the Chancellor was slow in making up his mind, Ludendorff was certain that\n\nhe will do so in the end and in a strong fashion. Whatever we can do from here, shall be done. I certainly hope that the Field-Marshal [i. e., Hindenburg] will not lend his word to a rotten peace. To my greatest satisfaction complete agreement in this matter exists between the Field-Marshal and myself. I know how much the Chancellor listens to the Marshal. I am, therefore, completely reassured in this direction.\n\nHere we have a first hint of possible later conflict between Bethmann and the Supreme Command. It is doubtful if Ludendorff would have written as he did had he known of the influence which the Social Democrats had upon Bethmann’s speech of December 9. As it was, the General deplored the strong agitation against Bethmann, for “of new men, none would be better, and in many ways perhaps worse.”\n\nLudendorff’s next letter, in January 1916, is not quite so favorable as his earlier one, though it still supports the Chancellor.\n\nGod knows, I don’t agree with everything the Chancellor does, and I wish he showed more impulsive strength. But he is not responsible for everything.… Criticism is easier than doing a thing oneself, as I often have experienced. We here stick to the Chancellor, for we lack a man who could replace him. The only candidate known thus far, we decidedly oppose.65\n\nThe last statement refers to General von Falkenhayn, whose strained relations with Hindenburg and Ludendorff we have already mentioned. In the same letter Ludendorff insisted again on “a strong peace and an increase of power.”\n\nIn February, the General reproached the Conservatives for opposing Bethmann, whom he considered excellent, and for supporting Falkenhayn as his successor.66 Again in March he “thought it well that Bethmann remained.”67 The government’s vacillation in the submarine question, however, brought a first note of disapproval, not so much against the Chancellor, as against the government in general. “As an honest man,” Ludendorff wrote to Wyneken in the summer of 1916, “I must confess my views, so that it cannot be said later that I have been faithless towards men whom I have supported until now.” Here we have a definitely ominous note. As to the future of Belgium, he wrote a little later: “Belgium’s dependence must be economic, military, and political. Only this triad will create something complete. Economic dependence alone is not enough. No one apparently any longer considers annexation. I leave the question open whether we shall have to take Liège for military reasons.”68\n\nThe Ludendorff-Wyneken correspondence is interesting not only because it shows a more moderate and human Ludendorff than the virtual dictator we shall encounter later on, but also because it shows the beginnings of a slow change from agreement to opposition in the relationship between Bethmann and Ludendorff. As yet, in the middle of 1916, agreement was almost complete, though one cannot help noticing between the lines of Ludendorff’s letters the admission that a different Chancellor might be desirable, if the right one could be found. The right one, we shall see, was never found, and Ludendorff’s repeated statements during this early period, when he was still open-minded on the subject, that Bethmann was the best man available, were borne out by later events. It was the lack of a suitable counterpart in the civilian field which was largely responsible for the power which Ludendorff was to assume over civil as well as military affairs during the second half of the war. The initial step, on August 29, 1916, which made Hindenburg Chief of Staff and gave Ludendorff the newly-created position of First Quartermaster General, was taken, paradoxically enough, with Bethmann’s blessing and active support.69 The added pressure of public opinion, which blamed Falkenhayn for the failures of German military policy in 1916, especially at Verdun, sufficed to bring about the change of command. It came at a time when military setbacks necessitated either extreme moderation in dealing with the Allies, or else powerful exertion in the military field. We have seen throughout Bethmann’s real preference for the former, while Hindenburg and Ludendorff advocated a policy of “impulsive strength.” The unifying factor of common opposition to Falkenhayn had disappeared. Conflict between the civilian and military, thus far hidden, was imminent, though it did not actually arise until the first part of 1917.\n\nAdministration of the Conquered Areas\n\nBefore we discuss the extra-governmental forces which helped to shape Germany’s policy of war aims during the second year of war, we must briefly examine what happened to the areas in Western Europe under German domination during the first half of the war. Perhaps we can learn from Germany’s administrative measures in occupied France and Belgium, to what extent she intended to translate her theoretical discussion of westward expansion into reality. Germany’s administrative policy in these areas, of course, began very shortly after the outbreak of war. Yet it developed slowly, in a trial and error method, and did not show its characteristic traits until almost two years later. Most of our discussion here will be concerned with the administration of Belgium, where both immediate and future problems were more complex than in the occupied regions of northeastern France. In the latter, things were relatively simple. Real interest, except on the part of the most extreme annexationists, existed only for the acquisition of Briey and Longwy, and here both official and unofficial views agreed that outright annexation would be most desirable. On October 31, 1914, the region in question was put under German Civil Administration. For the mines and the numerous iron works, a special “protective administration” was set up, consisting of three mining specialists. They were aided by a permanent “advisory council” made up of industrialists who had special interests in France’s iron deposits, among them Emil Kirdorf, Louis Röchling, General von Schubert (head of the Lorraine Stumm works), Kloeckner, Springorum (of Hoesch) and Krupp’s representative Frielinghau.70\n\nAs to the economic measures taken by Germany in occupied France, they clearly revealed her leading interest in the Briey-Longwy region: the mining of iron ore. Most of the mines were soon reopened and were kept in operation throughout the war, though, as we have already pointed out, their immediate significance has been somewhat overrated. The remaining works of this highly industrialized region were forced to remain idle, unless they produced vital military supplies.71 Soon a policy of exploitation set in, which did not assume really destructive proportions, however, until the later period of the war. How far this exploitation was dictated by immediate necessity, and how far it was due to the desire of Germany’s industrialists to destroy the harmful rivalry of their French competitors is difficult to decide. It is perhaps safe to say that in the first period of the war, with certain exceptions, the former motive prevailed. It was after the change of August 1916 in the German Supreme Command, that a more thorough policy of exploitation was entered upon, about which more will be said below.\n\nThe situation in Belgium turned out to be considerably more complex. The rapid advance of the German armies in August 1914 had suddenly brought this whole nation under German domination. To meet the urgent need for some kind of administration, the retired Marshal von der Goltz was appointed Governor of the Generalgouvernement of Belgium on August 25 and was given almost unlimited powers, responsible only to the Emperor.72 In his administrative work, the Marshal was at first aided by those members of the Belgian civil service who had remained behind when the Belgian government went into exile. But as a quick ending of the war became increasingly unlikely, a more permanent governmental organization was found necessary, using German personnel, though many of the lower positions remained in Belgian hands. On October 13, 1914, the Governor General officially assumed the powers of the Belgian King, and while he continued to handle the military functions of his position, the civil administration was organized into a separate department under the direction of Dr. von Sandt as Verwaltungschef. This Civil Administration was considered part of the German civil service, and as such it was responsible to the Chancellor and his Secretary of the Interior. A dual arrangement of this kind naturally contained the seed of much future friction.73 The administrative subdivision of the country into nine provinces was maintained, but on December 3, 1914, the Belgian provincial governors were replaced by German military governors. Among them was the head of the Army League, General Keim, who became governor of the province of Limburg, while the National Liberal leader Bassermann, another noted annexationist, was made aide-de-camp to the governor of Antwerp.74 As time went on and need arose, certain additional governmental agencies were created to deal with specific problems, such as the Political Section under Baron von der Lancken. But on the whole the administrative framework remained as set up during the first months of the war.\n\nThe psychological effect which this creation of an independently organized Belgian state had upon the German people was considerable. The reward which so many Germans hoped to reap from the war had here assumed its tangible form. The more thoroughly organized the administration of Belgium became, the more firmly did many people, in Germany and elsewhere, believe that Germany had come into Belgium to stay. The administration of old Marshal von der Goltz did not last very long. His heart was not really in his work, but on the battlefield with the German army. In his dealings with the Belgian people, moreover, he failed to show the firmness which his military superiors expected. As result of a specific disagreement over the collection of contributions from the Belgians, he was relieved of his position as Governor General on November 7, 1914. The issue—whether to collect 200 million francs, as the Supreme Command wanted, or merely 50 million, as von der Goltz thought feasible—was symptomatic of a basic problem which was not to be decided until much later: was Belgium to be administered for her own good and only secondarily for that of Germany, or was she to be exploited for the benefit of her conquerors? It took two years to find an answer to this question, and when it finally came, it was in favor of the second alternative.75\n\nThe successor of von der Goltz, Baron von Bissing, was very different from his retiring and unpretentious predecessor. Holding court at Château Trois Fontaines near Brussels, Bissing liked to think of the Belgian problem as pretty much his private concern and of himself as subject to no authority except that of the Emperor.76 “Wild Moritz,” as he was called, was undoubtedly the most influential and, strangely enough, the most constructive of the German administrators of Belgium. His views on the future of that country played a significant role in the controversy over western war aims. On the day of his appointment, von Bissing had a talk with Walter Rathenau at the Berlin Automobilklub, in which he asked the industrialist’s advice, how he might best fulfill his mission as Governor of Belgium. “If you plan to administer Belgium,” Rathenau told him, “you must know whether you are to administer the country on behalf of Germany or of Belgium.” Bissing agreed, and Rathenau added: “You must administer Belgium for Belgium,” to which the General replied: “Those are also approximately my views.”77 Here, then, were the two alternatives, and Bissing’s subsequent statements and his policy show that he was much aware of the dual role which he had to fulfill as governor of Belgium and representative of Germany.\n\nI have two tasks [he said in a speech on June 19, 1915] which are equally important. As administrator of this country I have to care for its welfare and prosperity. I am of the opinion that a squeezed lemon has no value and that a dead cow will give no milk. It is, therefore, necessary and important, that a country which has such importance for Germany economically and otherwise, is kept alive, and that the wounds of war are healed as much as possible. But I am obligated, at the same time, to consider carefully the advantages and disadvantages of this policy for Germany. We want to avoid any injury to Germany’s industry through a revival of Belgian industry, and we hope that it will be possible to find some compromise which will be useful to both countries right at this time. Such an understanding will also be useful to Belgium’s future, no matter what we think it may be.78\n\nWhat exactly did Bissing think the future of Belgium should be? For a while he hoped for some governmental directives, and in February 1915 he complained to the Prussian Minister of War, General von Wrisberg, that the government left him completely in the dark as to its intentions on the future of Belgium.79 In an interview with the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, von Bissing held that it was not his business to engage in politics, but that “everything we do here [in Belgium], all conditions, under which we live, would be made much easier if the Belgians knew what finally would become of them.”80 In the absence of any guidance from Berlin, Bissing finally had to decide on his own what he thought the future of Belgium should be. In his public statements he made it perfectly clear that in his opinion Germany should in some form keep the lands she had conquered. “What has been entrusted to us,” he said on the Kaiser’s birthday, January 28, 1916, “we want to hold on to.”81 Statements like this, which he made repeatedly, created the impression, correct for the early days of the war, that the Governor General desired the annexation of Belgium.82 In late 1915, Bissing wrote another memorandum on the future of Belgium, mostly for his own use. He sent a copy of it to General Keim, who kept it until after the Governor’s death in 1917. It was then published as Bissing’s “Political Testament,” with the statement, not entirely true, that “to the day of his death, von Bissing remained faithful to the opinions set forth in his memorandum.” The memorandum still expressed General Keim’s views on the subject of Belgium as late as 1925; but von Bissing’s ideas on the form, if not the substance, of Germany’s Belgian policy changed under the influence of later events.83 The memorandum, though it never specifically says so, leaves no doubt in the reader’s mind that the Governor’s true aim was Germany’s complete domination of Belgium. He stresses the military, naval, and economic advantages which Germany stood to gain from Belgium, and belittles the objections usually raised against incorporating a large foreign group into the German Empire. Still a policy of trying to conciliate the Belgian people, Bissing holds, will not work, pointing to the example of Germany’s failure to assimilate her Polish and French minorities before the war. “For years to come we must maintain the existing state of dictatorship,” he says. “Belgium must be seized and held, as it now is, and as it must be in the future.”\n\nThese were the views of the Governor General of Belgium. He wanted to administer the country which had been put under his care in such a way that as little lasting harm be done to it as possible. In this he was motivated not by sympathy for the fate of a defeated nation so much as by the hope that Belgium would ultimately fall under permanent German domination as a result of the war.84 From the German point of view, this was an eminently far-sighted and constructive policy, though based on the unjustified assumption that Germany would win the war. We must now briefly examine to what extent this policy was successful during the first years of the war.\n\nIt is impossible here to go into the details of Germany’s Belgian policy.85 All we can hope to do is discuss those measures which pointed towards the perpetuation of Germany’s domination. In spite of von Bissing’s hopes, it was in the economic field that such measures were least apparent.86 Belgian industry had suffered remarkably little destruction from the invasion of the German armies, and efforts to resume production were made soon after the establishment of the Generalgouvernement.87 Yet except for the mining of coal, these efforts turned out to be a failure.88 The confiscation of raw materials under the direction of Walther Rathenau and his Kriegsrohstoffabteilung (who thus ignored the advice he himself had given to Bissing) for use in essential German war industries, and the refusal of Belgian industrialists and workers to co-operate in producing goods for the enemy, were the chief reasons for this failure. To this we must add the dependence of Belgian industry on foreign sources of raw materials and markets, both of which were closed as a result of the war. Even if the German Supreme Command (which was responsible for the confiscation of materials) and the Belgian people had been willing, a return to normalcy would have been very difficult. Another factor, though not very easy to substantiate, was the opposition of Germany’s industrial interests to the revival of their Belgian competitors. General von Bissing had already briefly alluded to this in his speech on June 19, 1915.89 Germany’s economic exploitation of Belgium did not reach its full measure until after the first two years of war. Needless to say, it was carried on against the spirited opposition of General von Bissing. Yet even during the early period of the war, need for both manpower and matériel on the one hand, and the unwillingness or inability of Belgian industry to co-operate with Germany’s war effort on the other, necessitated ever more stringent measures. Large numbers of machines were moved to Germany, to help in the manufacture of munitions. The confiscation of vital raw materials reached down into the individual homes of the Belgian people. Against the passive resistance of the working population, a number of edicts were passed in August 1915 and again in May 1916, making willful evasion of employment a punishable offense. At the same time an Industriebüro was set up to hire Belgian workers for employment in Germany.90 The exploitation à outrance, however, the limitless exploitation of Belgium which in many cases bordered on outright destruction, and which included the deportation of Belgian workers to work in German factories, did not begin until late in 1916. Here, too, the change in personnel of the Supreme Command was to show its effects.91\n\nIf the keynote of Germany’s economic policy in Belgium was exploitation rather than construction, such a policy was dictated by military necessity and did not necessarily indicate a lack of interest in maintaining a German hold over Belgium. Whenever German interests permitted, reforms were introduced into Belgium, a fact which indicates that the administration had the future of the country very much at heart. An example is the introduction of German social legislation, included in some of the early governmental pronouncements on war aims. The chief provisions for sickness, old age and accident insurance were not introduced until 1918; though the first suggestions in this respect were made in early September 1914.92 In a letter of September 10, the Chief of the Civil Administration, Dr. von Sandt, comments on this suggestion and points out the advantages of such a policy:\n\nAside from giving us hope that we may win over to our side the Belgian working population, the introduction at present of social legislation would serve as preparation for the permanent annexation of parts of Belgium by the German Reich. In case such annexation should not take place, it [i. e., social legislation] will impose burdens upon Belgian industry which, because of the workers, cannot be abolished after the conclusion of peace, and will consequently weaken Belgium’s ability to compete with Germany.93\n\nOn January 1, 1915, the first law for the protection of woman and child labor went into effect.94\n\nThe most far-reaching measures concerning the future of Belgium, however, were not taken in the economic or social, but in the political field. In this connection the Flemish question, mentioned in many of the annexationist programs, became of greatest importance. To understand it fully, we have to go briefly into its background.95\n\nThe Flemish Question\n\nThe origins of the Flemish Movement go back to the decades following the Belgian Revolution of 1830. Its primary cause was the division of Belgium’s population into two very different groups: the Walloons, French by language and cultural heritage, and the Flemings, who spoke a Germanic dialect and who, though economically and socially “inferior,” were conscious and proud of their historical and cultural tradition. Common opposition to Dutch oppression had unified these Latin and Germanic sections during the revolution. But when the newly created state showed a preponderance of Walloon influence, especially in its official use of the French language, opposition from the Flemings—who were numerically superior—arose very quickly. At first this opposition was a mere cultural and literary movement under the leadership of artists and writers. This preparatory period lasted until about 1873 and was superseded by a period of conflict which went up and into the World War. Some laws were passed during this period, granting on paper the equality of French and Flemish. But still, the only effective way for the Flemings to voice their grievances was in extra-governmental propaganda organizations, since the limited franchise barred the lower classes, i. e., most of the Flemings, from parliamentary representation. The electoral reforms of 1893 changed this, introducing for the first time twenty-six Socialist members into the Belgian Chamber. From now on Flemish influence was felt in the political affairs of the nation. By the time war broke out, however, little had as yet been done to ameliorate the cultural subjection from which the majority of the Belgian people suffered.96\n\nGermany’s relations with the Flemish movement, though intimate at times, had never been significant. They were quite close during the 1840’s and up to 1870, though entirely of a cultural nature. During the Franco-Prussian War, Flemish sentiment was largely on the German side. Towards the end of the century, and particularly with the rise of Pan-Germanism during the 1890’s, Flemish relations with Germany became noticeably cooler. The Flemings did not trust the Pan-Germans, who promised to deliver their “Low German” brethren from the yoke of their “Walloon oppressors.” Even the small German minority in Belgium refused to have any dealings with the Pan-German League. As a result, the Flemish movement remained almost entirely clear from Pan-German influence.97\n\nDespite the almost century-old opposition of the Flemings to their government, the whole population of Belgium rallied to the defense of the country when the Germans began their invasion.98 Some of the fiercest fighting, as a matter of fact, was done by Flemings, and their heavy losses testified to their loyalty. The complete defeat of their country, however, and the renewed attacks upon Flemish aspirations by leaders of the Walloons, soon helped to resurrect the Flemish movement. By early 1915, three different groups of Flemings could be distinguished. They all demanded a certain amount of administrative independence for Flanders, the northern and coastal region of Belgium, in which most of the Flemings were concentrated. Where they differed was in the method which each of them suggested to achieve this independence. The largest group, called “Passivists,” with headquarters in Amsterdam, hoped for an independent Flanders in a free Belgium, and proposed to reach this aim by legal means, continuing the agitation for pro-Flemish legislation after the war where it had left off in 1914. At the other extreme were the “Young Flemings,” also called “Activists,” concentrated at Ghent, who questioned the continued existence of Belgium and instead wanted the creation of a completely independent Flemish state. Since they could count on violent opposition rather than assistance from the Belgian government, they hoped to realize their aims during the war and with German help. A third group, which developed a little later at Antwerp, had similar views about the desirability of Flemish independence during the war; but it also desired the maintenance of the Belgian state and in that respect was close to the “Passivists.”99 There had been few demands for such administrative division of Belgium before the war, but the failure of the Belgian government to live up to most of its promises for cultural independence made a certain amount of administrative independence seem desirable to almost all Flemings.100\n\nThe German government, though little aware of the Flemish movement before the war, realized that any strengthening of Flemish influence and the resulting weakening of the pro-French, Walloon section, would be to its advantage. We thus find Bethmann Hollweg writing to von Sandt as early as September 2, 1914, advising him to pay special attention to the Flemish elements in Belgium, “perhaps with regard to a future understanding with Holland.”101 Again on December 16, 1914, the Chancellor, in a letter to General von Bissing, stressed the importance of German contacts with the Flemish movement and proposed the creation of a governmental agency to deal with this question. He also suggested the founding of a Flemish university at Ghent and some sort of Flemish press, to be introduced via Holland. A week later, Captain Dirr, a member of von Bissing’s administration, who had made a study of the Flemish movement, suggested that his chief establish contact with the leaders of the Flemings and carry out the existing and proposed Belgian legislation concerning the use of the Flemish language, especially the instruction in Flemish and the transformation of the University of Ghent into a Flemish university.102\n\nIt is interesting to note that the initial suggestions for a pro-Flemish policy were made by the Chancellor, and that his specific proposals were all realized without much delay. What probably appealed to him was the possibility of thus weakening Belgium without necessitating the annexation of the country. Other factors, such as genuine sympathy for the aspirations of a “Germanic” minority and the desire to establish friendly relations with at least part of the Belgian population, likewise played their part.103\n\nThe first step to realize Bethmann’s proposal was the establishment, on January 10, 1915, of an administrative agency under Dr. Schaible, to conduct German-Flemish relations. On February 13, this Commission for Flemish Affairs was incorporated into the newly created Political Section of the Generalgouvernement under the direction of Baron von der Lancken.104 In a report describing the program of his Section, von der Lancken made the following revealing statement: “There is no reason, from the German point of view, to prevent political hostilities between the Belgians themselves, as long as they do not endanger military security and internal peace.”105 Prior to this he had proposed the administrative division of Belgium into two states, Flemish and Walloon, and their economic assimilation into Germany.106\n\nClose relations with the Flemish “Activists” (under the leadership of a radical clergyman, Domela Nieuwenhuys Nijegaard) was one of the chief duties of the Commission for Flemish Affairs. As far back as August 25, 1914, the Germans had shown their sympathy for the Flemish movement by publishing their decrees in Flemish as well as French, giving precedence to the former.107 On January 1, 1915, the handling of the Belgian press was entrusted to a separate Press Section, and by the end of the month the Chancellor’s plan for a Belgian paper materialized. From January 20 on, the “Belgian Courier,” in which German influence was concealed behind a Dutch front, appeared six times a week.108 In February 1915, the first “Activist” paper, the Vlaamsche Post, made its appearance in Ghent.109 The same month, German military authorities supplemented these propaganda activities by a campaign among Flemish prisoners of war in Germany.110 In the summer of 1915, the first contacts were established between Germans and “Young Flemings” at Brussels. Pastor Nieuwenhuys Nijegaard wrote a pamphlet entitled “Flanders freed from the Southern Yoke,” which contained a manifesto of the “Young Flemings,” demanding an independent Flemish state under German protection and in close economic and military collaboration with Germany. The similarity between this and the programs current in Germany is striking. Yet Nijegaard warned against German annexation of Belgium or Flanders, stressing the latter’s love of independence and pointing out the obvious fact that the Flemings were not Germans.111\n\nAlthough the more far-reaching measures, such as the administrative division of Belgium into a Flemish and a Walloon section, were not taken until later, the suggestions made by Bethmann Hollweg and others of following the trends of pre-war developments, were carried out during the first half of the war. In addition to using the Flemish language in their administrative decrees, the Germans now began the rigorous enforcement of earlier Belgian language laws which made sure that Flemish was used in the correspondence between the government and the Flemish provinces and that children received elementary instruction in their mother tongue.112\n\nMore important still than these linguistic decrees were the German measures to transform the University of Ghent into a Flemish institution. The demand for a university of their own had been among the outstanding pre-war grievances of the Flemings. To supply a sufficient number of teachers capable of conducting classes in Flemish and thus to utilize the various linguistic reforms, advanced instruction in Flemish was considered a primary necessity. A Flemish university, most Flemings felt, would also ultimately raise the cultural and thus the economic level of the Flanders region.113 The struggle for such a university had flared up with particular violence during the years just prior to 1914. The argument used against it by both Walloons and the Catholic clergy, that Flemish was not a “cultural” language, aroused deep-felt resentment among the Flemings. Here was opportunity for the German government, urged on by the radical elements of the Flemish population, to ingratiate itself with a substantial part of the Belgian people. We found Bethmann Hollweg calling von Bissing’s attention to this question in December 1914. But it took a whole year before the project could be approached in earnest, and almost another year before it was at least partly realized. Attempts to introduce the teaching of Flemish gradually into the University of Ghent failed, when its faculty refused to resume instruction. On December 31, 1915, therefore, the university was transformed by decree into a purely Flemish institution. For a while the transformation remained on paper only, since most professors, under the leadership of Henri Pirenne and Paul Fredericq, refused to conduct courses in Flemish. Only after the leaders of the opposition had been jailed and additional instructors had been found, could the University of Ghent be formally opened on October 21, 1916. The necessary students were secured by liberal scholarship grants, but their sentiments were pro-Flemish or pro-Dutch rather than pro-German. On the whole, the venture was only partly successful, since many Flemings refused to receive their much-wanted university from the hands of the enemy.114\n\nThe examples we have given of Germany’s administrative measures in Belgium during the first two years of war show a general tendency to create conditions which could not be undone without considerable effort after the war, and which would be to Germany’s advantage in case she maintained her hold over Belgium. Von Bissing as well as von Sandt frankly admitted these underlying tendencies in their private correspondence.115 Any opinion to the contrary was frowned upon. A member of the administration, Karl Bittmann, for instance, had added a prefatory note to a memorandum he had written on the future of Belgium, in which he had said: “I fear, yes, I foresee that we shall not emerge victorious from this struggle. And if we are beaten, our enemy will prepare our fate for us, rather than our preparing his.” Such pessimism was most undesirable for a member of the German Imperial Administration, and von Sandt tore up the note when it reached him.116\n\nIt is difficult to get much evidence on the views of any but the leaders of Germany’s Belgian administration. But the few comments we find of lower officials, such as the note by Bittmann, are by no means as radical and hopeful as those made by men higher up. Bittmann himself was opposed to von Bissing’s Flemish policy, as were his colleagues von Santen and von Lutz; and both Baron von der Lancken and his assistant Count Harrach did not always share the illusions of von Bissing and of ardent annexationists like General Keim or Admiral Schröder, commander of Bruges.117 Outsiders, who visited Belgium after she had been under German occupation for more than a year, expressed highest admiration for the efficiency of its administration; but at the same time they could not help feeling that much of it was artificially imposed upon an unwilling people and that the hope of ever winning the Belgians over to their new masters or of making a lasting impression upon their way of life was futile.118\n\nHowever great the hopes of some people, especially von Bissing, may have been, they did not assume real significance as long as they were not backed by the supreme political authority of the Reich. It is in connection with the administrative developments in Belgium, and particularly with the Flemish question, that the Reichstag speech of the Chancellor on April 5, 1916, reveals its real meaning as the most important and specific of his public utterances on the future of Western Europe. “Here [i. e., in Belgium] too,” he said, “will be no status quo ante. Here, too, fate will not retrace its steps. Germany cannot again abandon to Latinization the tribe of the Flemings which has been kept down so long.”119 What is this but an endorsement of the policy of the Generalgouvernement, and an implied promise to maintain a development which would eventually result in the break-up of the Belgian state and the domination of its remnants by Germany? Among the different factors influencing the Chancellor’s stand on war aims, the administrative developments in Belgium are of the utmost importance. They, more than any other force, presented an effective obstacle to any non-annexationist peace settlement. The pressure of a small annexationist minority, of public opinion, and of political parties, even his own commitments in favor of a strong peace, might be ignored by the Chancellor, if a real chance to end the war through a moderate peace offered itself. But the faits accomplis which von Bissing—with the Chancellor’s acquiescence and, at times, active co-operation—was eagerly creating in his western domain, proved to the German people, and to the world at large, that Germany had come into Belgium to stay.\n\nThe Political Parties During the Second Year of War\n\nIf Bethmann Hollweg, during the second year of war, looked hopefully to the parties of the Reichstag for signs of moderation, he was sure to be disappointed. The tendency towards annexationism, which we found during the first months of the war, became, if anything, stronger as time went on. The most vociferous demands in favor of far-reaching annexations in east and west continued to come from the parties of the Right, notably the National Liberals. On June 2, 1915, and again two months later, they voiced the usual demands for political, military, and economic “attachment” of areas in western Europe.120 These same views, found at the beginning of the second year of war, when Germany’s successes in the east justified a certain optimism, were still held in late May 1916, in the face of heavy losses suffered during the Verdun offensive. On May 21, 1916, the National Liberals repeated their earlier conviction that only an “extension of the land and sea frontiers of the Empire in the east and the west” could give the German people the necessary guarantees for military, political, and economic security. England they still considered Germany’s Hauptfeind, to be defeated by unlimited submarine warfare.121.\n\nAmong National Liberal leaders, the head of the party, Ernst Bassermann, was one of the most ardent advocates of German expansion. We have already mentioned his activities as member of the German administration in Brussels and his affiliation with industrial interests through his membership on numerous boards of directors.122 A sympathizer of Heinrich Class and his radical aims—“I endorse every word of it,” he said of Class’ famous memorandum—Bassermann shared the Pan-German leader’s deep aversion to Bethmann Hollweg. “How can we get rid of the scoundrel?” he asked Class in early 1915. “Everybody at the front realizes that the war will be lost if we keep him.”123 Only as long as Bethmann seemed to be in favor of a strong peace did Bassermann refrain from open attacks.124\n\nBassermann’s own annexationist statements are numerous but of the usual vagueness, so they need not concern us in detail.125 Typical is an article he wrote for the Magdeburgische Zeitung on January 1, 1916, advocating a peace “which will bring us the territorial acquisitions in the east and west which are necessary for our security.”126 Other prominent National Liberals joined their leader. Gustav Stresemann—Reichstag deputy, member of the Navy League, leader of his party in Saxony, where he was closely allied with industrial interests, and chief influence behind the Bund der Industriellen—delivered an address on German foreign policy before the Reichstag, which not only contained the usual references to “Germany’s strengthening in the east and west,” but which also stressed eloquently those forces in Germany which drove her into westward expansion, the anti-British Drang nach Westen:\n\nWhen “Michael the Dreamer”127 became “Michael the Seafarer,” when the political unification and the development of our economic strength came, when Hamburg and Bremen became what they are, when the Rhineland-Westphalia region developed the great foundation of its economic strength, when we created the seaports for the German world trade that insured Germany’s economic position in the world, then began the economic struggle, even before the clash of arms came. England’s whole history shows this struggle against us.128\n\nWhat, in Stresemann’s opinion, would be Germany’s chances in this struggle after the war? Turning against those of his countrymen who saw Germany’s field of expansion primarily in the east and in Central Europe, Stresemann held:\n\nOur future does not lie in the east, and the struggle for world markets we will not give up; for if we give up, England’s purpose will be achieved. With the first ship that leaves Cuxhaven and Bremerhaven, this struggle for world markets begins anew and will be carried on with all the German businessman’s intensity and joy of producing. The world was our field and will be so in the future.\n\nTo maintain Germany’s world-wide economic sway, “access to the sea” and “naval bases in the wide world” were necessary.129\n\nStresemann’s friend and biographer, von Rheinbaben, has gone out of his way to cover up this annexationist agitation of the hero of Locarno and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. We may allow for a change of heart on the part of Stresemann during the postwar years; but to say, as Rheinbaben does, that “he opposed emphatically the annexationists,” is incorrect.130\n\nIn the Prussian House of Representatives, the National Liberal deputies Fuhrmann, Friedberg, and Bacmeister represented the annexationist program of their party.131 Even the moderate Schiffer was not opposed to “tangible securities” and an extension of Germany’s frontiers if military necessity made such measures seem desirable.132 Finally, the official publication of the party, Nationalliberale Blätter, and the party-dominated press carried frequent articles in favor of westward expansion.133\n\nThe two Conservative parties likewise continued along their earlier course. The Free Conservatives passed a resolution in December which demanded “a Germany more powerful and enlarged beyond her present frontiers by the retention, as far as possible, of the territories now occupied, and further damages for the outlay of money.”134 Its leader, Baron von Zedlitz und Neukirch, reiterated these aims in speeches before the Prussian House of Representatives and in a number of newspaper articles.135\n\nThe larger and more important Conservative Party presented its stand in September 1915, proclaiming as the most important aim of the war “the defeat of England, who has brought about the war and who will never cease to threaten and injure our position in the world and our future development.” It hoped for a “permanent, honorable peace, which secures the foundation of the German future,” and supported “all annexations necessary for this purpose.”136 The leader of the party, von Heydebrand, was rather sparing with his remarks. At the end of the first year of war he hoped for “a stronger and greater Germany.”137 A year later, on August 14, 1916, he asked for an extension of Germany’s western frontier into France. About Belgium he said: “I do not say annex, I am not speaking of that—no, but to bring into our hands, in the military and political and economic sense, what we must have in order to hold at the heart of England the pistol she has hitherto held at ours.”138 The Conservative press, especially the Deutsche Tageszeitung and the agrarian Kreuzzeitung followed the party-line.139 There continued to be some disagreement among the Conservatives as to whether Germany’s chief field of territorial expansion lay in the east or west. Professor Schiemann, for instance, who wrote a weekly column on foreign affairs for the Kreuzzeitung, hinted at the possibility of an understanding with England shortly after the outbreak of war, and was violently attacked by Ernst Reventlow in the Deutsche Tageszeitung. To maintain peace in their own ranks, the Conservatives refused to print Schiemann’s answer, whereupon he resigned his position with the Kreuzzeitung. He was succeeded by Professor Otto Hoetzsch, who always worked in close collaboration with Count Westarp. The group within the Conservative Party which, quite naturally, was most concerned over too one-sided a policy of western expansion, was the Agrarian League. Its leader, Dr. Roesicke, repeatedly tried to moderate Reventlow’s anti-British stand. To stress Germany’s enmity for England, he held, would easily lead to neglecting her agricultural expansion and colonization of the east.140\n\nThe Center Party’s first lengthy declaration on war aims came in October 1915. It was kept in the usual vague terms: “The terrible sacrifices which the war imposed upon our people, call for an increased protection of our country in the east and west through acquisitions of territory which (regardless of what constitutional forms they shall take) will keep the enemy from suddenly attacking us again.”141 Specific statements concerning the future of Western Europe in general and of Belgium in particular were not made at this early stage of the war. But the majority of the party agreed that the status quo ante should not be re-established. Interpreting the Chancellor’s speech of the same day, Spahn said on April 5, 1916: “Belgium must not remain a bulwark of England. As a necessary consequence she will fall into our hands politically, militarily, and economically.”142\n\nIt was Mathias Erzberger, who in a letter to Bethmann Hollweg on June 28, 1915, discussed the settlement of the Belgian question in more specific terms. He proposed the following “as a practical solution which also will make possible peace with England”:\n\nCustoms union with introduction of German economic legislation, and complete abolition of the Belgian army, leaving only a police force. Lease of the ports of Ostende and Zeebrugge for 99 years, with the reservation that Germany can break the lease if she reaches a final understanding with England. Community of railways, leaving local employees in charge, and the creation of a central administration in Brussels. Appointment of a German Governor General with far-reaching veto powers. Perhaps abdication of the King in favor of his son, who will be educated in Germany. Payment of indemnities and surrender of Belgian governmental coal mines and of Belgium’s foreign concessions. Acquisition of Belgium’s Congo Colonies, etc.143\n\nSuch was Erzberger’s minimum program at the end of almost a year of war. To understand it we must remember that he had just joined Thyssen’s board of directors. This fact particularly explains his war aims in France, described in the same letter: “From France the ore-basin of Briey and Longwy, a better frontier along the Vosges, the acquisition of Belfort or at least the dismantling of this fortress. The payment of a high indemnity.” There is no evidence to show that Erzberger changed these views during the second year of the war.\n\nThe policy of the Center Party was thus not quite uniform but varied between moderate and more extreme annexationism.144 This difference was also reflected in the two leading Centrist papers, the annexationist Kölnische Volkszeitung and the moderate Berlin Germania.145 Yet even the latter was not opposed to “a tangible prize of victory,” better access to the sea and the elimination of the “gates of invasion” which so badly affected the strategic position of Germany.146 On the whole the Center Party agreed that Belgium should be kept as a kind of pawn until peace came, and that she should not again fall under the influence of France and England.147\n\nThe program of the Progressives was in many ways similar to that of the Center, though perhaps a little more moderate. On August 18, 1915, the Progressive Reichstag delegation passed the following resolution:\n\nEqually removed from the systematic repudiation of all territorial aggrandizement and from limitless projections of annexations, the delegation considers that it is indispensable to assure the future of the Empire by military and economic measures as also by necessary extensions of the frontier, and to organize, for the free competition of peoples, conditions, which in the national domain as on a free sea, will guarantee the free expansion of the German people’s energies.148\n\nTo make any more definite statement was considered premature. On December 4-5, the Central Committee of the party stated its opposition to the status quo ante and its hope for lasting protection against attacks.149 During the Reichstag debate on April 6, 1916, the Progressive leader von Payer again held that the status quo ante would be impossible after the war, and added more specifically: “A Belgium will remain, to be sure; but this Belgium will be different, inside and out, from the Belgium of August 1914.”150 These were moderate statements, but they were not opposed to annexations. Some members, Müller-Meiningen for instance, went further in their demands, hoping for the outright annexation of Belgium;151 while others were much more moderate than their party’s declarations.152\n\nTwo figures among the Progressives merit special treatment: the “moderate” Friedrich Naumann and the radical Gottfried Traub. Friedrich Naumann has quite wrongly been included among the most moderate of Progressives. As early as October 10, 1914, he had suggested to Under-Secretary Wahnschaffe that Belgium be divided among France, Holland, Luxemburg, and Germany, thus wiping her completely off the map.153 As the war progressed, Naumann became more moderate, though he still maintained his earlier view that Belgium had to disappear in order to deliver Germany from a constant threat. In June 1915 he again proposed its division between France and Holland.154 If this seems a rather harsh proposal, it should perhaps be pointed out that Naumann was not moved by chauvinism or economic greed, but by a sincere desire to prevent the recurrence of a similarly destructive war. “The main thing,” he wrote to the pacifist Quidde on August 10, 1915, “is to draw the future frontiers of Europe so that they will not be a hindrance to peaceful development.”155 If Germany’s security demanded certain corrections along the eastern and western frontiers, he wrote, such corrections were justified.156\n\nIt is in this constructive spirit that we should view Naumann’s plan for a Central European Confederation, embodied in his well-known book Mitteleuropa. First published in October 1915, it was soon widely discussed both in Germany and abroad. What Naumann suggested, briefly, was a slowly growing, voluntary Central European federation, built around the already existing Dual Alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary, and including most of the small states and nationalities of Central Europe. It was to be economic rather than political in character, although Naumann hoped that ultimately it would go beyond the mere artificial and utilitarian stage. It is incorrect, therefore, to see in his Mitteleuropa plans merely another embodiment of Germany’s wartime expansionism. What distinguishes them from the ordinary set of war aims is their genuinely constructive character as a “positive contribution to the future well-being of the mid-European peoples.”157\n\nGottfried Traub, a defrocked Protestant pastor, represents the more extreme side of Progressive annexationism. One of the leading propagandists, he saw in Germany’s eastern and western expansion the only guarantee for the maintenance of Europe’s peace.158 To spread his ideas more effectively, he published a series of leaflets, Eiserne Blätter.159 Later on, Traub became a member of the Independent Committee for a German Peace and of the Fatherland Party, two ultra-annexationist organizations.160 It should be noted that Traub was not the only annexationist among Protestant clergymen. There is definitely more evidence of strong war aims among the Protestant than among the Catholic clergy, due, most likely, to the close relationship between the Protestant Church and the Prussian state.161\n\nIf, as this survey has shown, the bourgeois parties of the Center and Right maintained and even increased their annexationist sentiment during the second year of war, the Social Democrats, with equal determination, tried to uphold their anti-annexationist stand. On June 9, 1915, for instance, several hundred of its leading members demanded that the party take a decisive stand against the growing clamour for annexations. Unless some action was taken, they threatened, the Socialist Party might break up.162 It was partly as a result of this internal pressure that Ebert and Scheidemann addressed a letter to Bethmann Hollweg in which they protested against the Petition of the Six Economic Organizations and stressed the Socialists’ desire for an early peace. “The annexation of Belgium,” it read, “would isolate Germany as well as increase and enlarge the coalition against us. Peace must not bring us more enemies but more sympathies.” A brief resumé of the letter, ending in the sentence “the people do not want annexation, the people want peace,” was published in the Vorwärts, which was promptly seized by the censor.163\n\nOn August 14-16, 1915, the Socialist Reichstag delegation and the Party Committee held a joint meeting to consider the question of war aims. Reports were submitted by David and Bernstein, and since David’s expressed the views of the majority, it was subsequently published as the Socialist Party’s peace program. Three of its five points will interest us here. In its first point the memorandum was against the territorial aims of Germany’s enemies, especially against France’s demand for Alsace-Lorraine. To secure Germany’s economic development after the war, the second point asked for the “open door,” the most favored nation clause, and the “freedom of the seas.” Most interesting, however, is the fourth point. As published in the Vorwärts on August 24, it read:\n\nRemembering that the annexation of territories with foreign populations is against the right of self-determination and that, besides, the internal unity and strength of the German national state are only thus weakened and its political relations to the foreign countries greatly prejudiced, we oppose the shortsighted politicians’ plans of conquest which have this aim.164\n\nYet the original manifesto had contained an additional last sentence: “We therefore consider the restitution of Belgium necessary for the sake of Germany’s interests no less than for the sake of justice.” This sentence, as we have already seen, had been omitted because of governmental interference, since it was feared that the military authorities would object to it.165\n\nThe minority report of Eduard Bernstein at the August 14-16 meeting was never published in Germany. It went still further than David’s report, demanding not only the restitution of Belgium, but the payment of indemnities to make up for the damages that nation had suffered as a result of the war. For regions whose nationality was contested, moreover, the report suggested plebiscites, a practice easily applicable to Alsace-Lorraine.166 Such differences of opinion within the Socialist Party had existed from the beginning of the war, and they were not limited to a few individuals. We have already mentioned the two existing opposition groups. The more radical one around Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg was of minor importance. Liebknecht’s repeated Reichstag interpellations in favor of a non-annexationist peace were usually left unanswered.167 He was finally drafted, and when he staged a one-man public protest on May 1, 1916, shouting “Down with the war! Down with the government!” he was imprisoned and not released until October 1918.168 The larger opposition group under Hugo Haase and Ledebour was much more effective. Scheidemann tells of the growing friction between this group and the rest of the party. It came to the surface in a speech of Hugo Haase before the Reichstag on March 24, 1916, which led to a fight with his party and the secession of himself and seventeen of his followers. Forming at first the Sozialdemokratische Arbeitsgemeinschaft, it was not until April 8, 1917, that Haase organized the Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands.169 In general, this group distinguished itself from the majority of the party not so much in its war aims as in the more violent methods it used to fight annexationism. At the same time, the Haase minority was willing to make certain sacrifices, if necessary, to gain peace. It was ready, for instance, to submit the question of Alsace-Lorraine to a plebiscite, which the rest of the party definitely refused to do.170 In April 1916, Haase demanded “the political restoration of Belgium, and not only that, but also its political and economic independence.”171\n\nThe Majority Socialists, as the Social Democratic Party was now called, clarified their stand on war aims once again in a petition in August, which asked that the war be ended as soon as possible. It was signed by ca. 900,000 persons. Simultaneously a resolution was published which held that “like the chauvinistic annexationists in the countries of the Entente, influential German circles set forth war aims and propagate plans of conquest which will incite the people of those countries to the strongest resistance.” In contrast to these annexationists, the resolution requested “a peace which will make friendship of neighboring peoples possible and which will secure the territorial integrity, independence, and freedom of economic development of our country.”172\n\nIt is impossible to treat in detail the many speeches and writings by prominent socialists stressing this opposition against annexations and expressing a real longing for peace.173 Taken as a whole, they are an indication of the change which many Germans, especially of the lower classes, underwent during the second winter of the war. Far from giving the majority of people the political reforms they so ardently desired, war had imposed additional restrictions upon the freedom of press and assembly. It had also brought severe shortages of food and other essentials, and had inflicted heavy losses in human lives. All these factors help to explain why the enthusiasm of the early days of war now evaporated and a sincere desire for peace arose in its place. In July 1916, the Büro für Sozialpolitik made a survey of public opinion: “The temper of the masses is at present so bad in many places, that every mention of a war aim beyond the status quo which the majority [referring to the Social Democrats] might venture to disseminate, would result in numerous voters going over to the minority.”174 Many German letters intercepted by the Allies, as well as other contemporary accounts reveal a widespread hope for peace, particularly among the urban population and the soldiers at the front.175\n\nIn contrast to the lower classes, the upper bourgeoisie and nobility not only continued to enjoy their political and social privileges, they also suffered less from the deprivations of war. In some cases, even, they seemed to be growing rich on lucrative war contracts. No wonder, then, that the gulf between the two extremes of German society soon became ever wider.176 Added to the already existing differences, and soon overshadowing them in importance, was the growing suspicion that the war was continued merely to satisfy the egotism and annexationist greed of the “classes.” Wahnschaffe described this feeling as early as June 28, 1915, in a letter to Valentini, head of the Kaiser’s Geheimes Zivilkabinett:\n\nThe longing for peace among the workers is very great, and is only kept from breaking out openly through the efforts of their leaders. The violent agitation of the Right feeds the suspicion, that the government might continue the war—out of desire for conquests—longer than the protection of the Fatherland requires. Also, that the Chancellor, who is trusted not to have any fantastic plans and to be guided only by his sense of duty, might be overthrown. The agitation of the Right does not remain secret. I have often warned that this annexationist propaganda will only benefit the radical wing of Social Democracy.177\n\nThe controversy over annexations had become the battle-ground on which Socialists and Germany’s ruling classes continued their pre-war conflicts.\n\nNot all Socialists, however, were opposed to annexations. The rise of a right wing within the party, on the beginnings of which we have commented earlier, continued in 1915 and 1916. The Socialist deputy Suedekum, for instance, wrote in July 1915: “No objections can be raised to necessary steps taken to ensure the safety of our frontiers, and to open up far-reaching economic relations with European states.”178 On December 21, 1915, the right wing held a separate meeting at which its leader, David, is reported to have said: “We do not want to close our eyes to the necessity of conquering certain territories. It is entirely out of the question, for instance, that we again hand back the conquered Russian areas to Russian absolutism.” The secret report of the Berlin president of police, von Jagow, from which this excerpt of David’s speech was taken, then goes on to describe the meeting: “Peus [another Socialist] agreed with David. He had received hundreds of letters from party-members who all wanted to keep the soil which had been conquered with so much blood.… Lensch and Suedekum represented a similar point of view. Landsberg, too, was mentioned as a member of this group.”179 The deputies Geck, Quarck, and Marum, as well as some Socialist papers and journals, likewise followed a moderately annexationist policy.180 Yet interesting as these right-wing pronouncements of German socialism may be, they had little influence upon the party’s general policy.\n\nAs during the first year of the war, the split over the question of war aims between bourgeois parties and Social Democrats led to a number of interesting debates in the Reichstag. The longing for peace among the lower classes did not affect the parties of the middle—Center and Progressives—until late in 1916 and early 1917, so it did not yet assert itself in the Reichstag session of December 9, 1915. The cause for the debate on that day was a petition, presented by Scheidemann, that the government state its conditions of peace and reiterating the usual opposition to annexations.181 Bethmann Hollweg’s reply, already discussed, was followed by an interesting speech of Landsberg, who belonged to the right wing Socialists. He regretted the fact that Bethmann did not give his aims in detail,\n\nespecially since the Chancellor’s words indicated that his conditions of peace might well be worth hearing.… The Chancellor demanded securities against frivolous attacks. Well, if there are such securities, we all want them. The Chancellor declared his readiness to conclude an honorable peace, and I did not gather from his speech that he imposed any unreasonable conditions on our adversary. That for me is decisive. What is understood in detail by securities, will have to be discussed once the negotiations have begun.\n\nLandsberg concluded, as Scheidemann had done before him, opposing the “reconquest” of Alsace-Lorraine by France.182 This was by no means unconditional opposition against annexation, instead it indicated that the Social Democrats might be willing to wink at certain post-war adjustments. The radical wing under Haase and Ledebour was aware of this fact and voiced its protest in a subsequent meeting of the Socialist Reichstag delegation.183\n\nThe bourgeois parties, including the smaller ones (Poles, Danes, German-Hanoverians, Bavarian Farmers’ League, etc.) presented their views in a separate petition, read after Scheidemann’s speech, which asked for a peace which would secure “the military, economic, financial, and political interests of Germany in their totality and by all means, including the necessary acquisitions of territory.” The Kriegszielmehrheit had made its third united stand; and as Westarp points out, for the first time it had specifically referred to the necessity for territorial acquisitions.184\n\nThis majority, made up of the two Conservative parties, National Liberals, Center, and Progressives, also took a united stand on the submarine controversy, which became prominent in the winter and spring of 1915-16.185 Certain difficulties in connection with this question, however, temporarily disturbed concerted action in regard to war aims, and the parties again made separate statements on the subject in the Reichstag debate of April 5-6, 1916. Their fundamental agreement on the war aims problem, however, was nevertheless maintained.\n\nThe general tenor of the speeches delivered during these two days, some of which we have quoted already, expressed little that was new. Westarp demanded that Germany keep Belgium closely in hand. Stresemann opposed the status quo ante for that country and desired Germany’s “military, political, and economic supremacy the Centrist Spahn and the Progressive von Payer spoke in a similar vein.186 The only opposition came from the Socialists; and even here, remarkably enough, it was neither unanimous nor unequivocal. While Haase, for the Independents, demanded the complete restoration and independence of Belgium, and Friedrich Ebert, for the majority, opposed the annexationist plans of the other parties, the speech of Philipp Scheidemann did not completely shut the door to annexations. “One has to be a political simpleton,” he said, “to think that a whole continent has gone up in flames, that millions have been destroyed and killed, and that not a single boundary-stone, which some diplomat, long since dead, set up at one time, will be moved.”187 Scheidemann later denied that he intended this remark to be in favor of annexations. The bourgeois press, however, acclaimed it as such.\n\nWhat Scheidemann said about annexations [the Kölnische Volkszeitung wrote on April 7, 1916] can be endorsed by any bourgeois politician.… Once we begin moving boundary stones and abandon the principle not to annex, it will be simply a question of power and military necessity, whether the boundary-stone will be moved to the Vistula and the Meuse, or still farther.… The Social Democrat Scheidemann is even closer to the “Annexationists” than the Progressive von Payer.188\n\nIn view of these annexationist speeches, including Scheidemann’s statement, and the far-reaching speech of Bethmann during the same session, the debate of April 5-6, 1916 may be considered the high-water-mark of annexationism in the German Reichstag during the first two years of war.\n\nThe Annexationists Continue Their Agitation\n\nNobody could be more delighted than the annexationists with these manifestations of expansionist hopes, which they themselves had helped to create. The Kriegszielbewegung, and its component parts, Pan-Germanism and the industrialists, had done their most important work in the early, formative stage, the evolution of war aims. The second year saw mostly a continuation of their earlier agitation, and the perfection of their organization in the “Independent Committee for a German Peace.” It is also during this period that the Kriegszielbewegung definitely gained additional and effective allies from the ranks of Germany’s professors. The so-called “Petition of the Intellectuals” was the first fruit of this alliance.\n\nBecause of the Pan-German practice of avoiding the limelight whenever possible, there are few direct statements on war aims by the League itself and its leaders during the second year of the war. In October 1915, a series of articles by outstanding Pan-Germans appeared in the ultra-annexationist journal Der Panther (edited by Axel Ripke, an eastern annexationist),189 in which Class demanded the annexation of Belgium and the coast of Northern France, supplemented by annexations in the east and overseas.190 In the same number, General von Gebsattel, second in command of the League, advocated Germany’s westward expansion into Belgium and Northern France to the mouth of the Somme. To keep these regions under firm domination he suggested the mass-migration of the natives to make room for German settlers.191 The third member of the triumvirate of Pan-German leaders, the chief secretary of the League, Baron von Vietinghoff-Scheel, defined his aims in a memorandum entitled “The Guarantees of Germany’s Future.”192 He stressed Germany’s need for expansion to the east and for military security in the west. To gain the latter, he wrote, “it is sufficient to shape our frontier on one flank in such a fashion that we can dominate militarily all possible opponents from this flank.” Any land acquired for this purpose, of course, must be secured free from its original inhabitants.193\n\nThe various publications directly or indirectly under Pan-German influence followed the same line.194 In August 1916, a new magazine, Deutschlands Erneuerung, was planned, which first appeared in 1917. The list of its founders and editors indicates its highly annexationist character. Besides Class, they included Wolfgang Kapp, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Baron von Liebig, and Professors Max von Gruber, von Below, Schäfer, and Seeberg.195 Some of the League’s auxiliary organizations likewise continued their annexationist agitation. The Army League addressed a petition to Bethmann in which it asked for the annexation of Belgium as a basis of future operations against England and France.196 The Navy League brought its aims before the Chancellor in June 1916, desiring, as might be expected, the Flanders coast and Germany’s political and military influence over the rest of Belgium.197\n\nThe German Colonial Society likewise presented a definite program of war aims during this period. Though its president, Duke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenburg, was a Pan-German, the Society did not always favor co-operation with "
