        "text": "Hermann CÃ¤sar Hannibal Schubert (born 22 May 1848 in Potsdam, Germany; died 20 July 1911 in Hamburg, Germany) [1] was a German mathematician.\n\nSchubert was one of the leading developers of enumerative geometry, which considers those parts of algebraic geometry that involve a finite number of solutions. In 1874, Schubert won a prize for solving a question posed by Zeuthen. Schubert calculus was named after him.\n\nSchubert tutored Adolf Hurwitz at the Realgymnasium Andreanum in Hildesheim, Hanover, and arranged for Hurwitz to study under Felix Klein at University.\n\nReferences\n\n1. ^ O'Connor, John J. & Robertson, Edmund F., \"Hermann Schubert\", MacTutor History of Mathematics archive\n\nBibliography\n\n* Werner Burau and Bodo Renschuch, \"ErgÃ¤nzungen zur Biographie von Hermann Schubert,\" (Complements to the biography of Hermann Schubert,) Mitt.
