        "text": "The Old Lutheran Emigration at the Middle of the 19th Century - Full Text Search, Pages 241 - 296\n\nFrom page 241\n\nXX. List of the Names of the Emigrants\n\n(The sources for the names are provided by individual year of emigration.)\n\nWe are in the fortunate position of being able to give the names of most of the emigrants and are especially grateful for the depositions, which were published in conjunction with our Lutheran emigration and its rigorous maintenance. Despite this we could not give a complete index due to the fact that certain documents were not attainable, especially those of Posen and others from the province of Saxony. The total number of emigrants is sufficiently known. The difference between this total and the number of names will be rendered as these small discepancies occur. Maybe this index will supply a motive for rectifying these discrepancies. Such a register of persons may indeed be exhausting when taken together with the preceding historic chronicle, however as an appendix it might be less taxing. We think there may be families on both sides of the ocean who might discover with delight their own names within and take the opportunity to renew old, forgotten or broken family ties. May this index serve to reawaken and strengthen the sense of folk and family and work to bridge the gap between peoples and countries.\n\nWe will give the individual indexes chronologically, as they correspond to the previously given history.\n\n1835\n\nI. Emigrating to the region of Astracham in the Russian Empire from the Liegnitz District in Silesia, in particular from\n\nGross-Tinz: widowed resident Johanna Elisabeth Hoffmann, 57 years old, her son Johann Gottlieb (20), her daughter Maria Rosina (24);\n\nWangten: pasture cottager Johann Gottlieb Binner (35), wife Johanna Eleonore, neé Keil (31), and the following children: Johann Christian (8), Maria Rosina (4), Anna Rosina (1 ½); and also from\n\nWangten: widow Maria Rosina Binner (38) and her children Maria Rosina (18), Johann Christian (17), Karl Gottlieb (14), Johanna Eleonore (11), Karl Wilhelm (7), Anna Rosina (1 ½), total of 15.\n\nII. From Breslau and the neighboring area to Buffalo, New York in the United States of America:\n\nJ. G. Züngler (also spelled Zangler) with unknown family members; F. Langner; the cabinet maker Ernst Krieg; the cutlery maker J. Ch. Sieffert; the lumber merchant Wilhelm Haschmann. With these names are mentioned children and other family members but no names. We must estimate the number to be at least 15 people.\n\n1836\n\nMoving from Breslau to North America the shoemaker Wilhelm August Pietsch (35) with wife Rosina, neé Schönfeld (20) and children Bertha (6), Hermann (5);\n\nfrom\n\nFrom page 242\n\nRothkirch, Liegnitz District, to North America: journeyman bookbinder and noncommissioned officer Friedrich Eduard Scheppe (27);\n\nNeusalz, Freistadt District to Southern Australia: the agriculturalist Luis Kittlaus (22).\n\n1837\n\nA. Emigrating to America from the province of Pomerania, specifically from the district of Kammin according to the lists of the district magistrate von Voeltz.\n\nFrom Kammin itself: bookbinder Kroening (26) with wife Sophia, neé Bolling and two children, aged two years and eight months;\n\nservant and farmer's son Burow;\n\ncabinetmaker Zühlsdorg (36) and wife Anna Katharina, neé Scheer;\n\nshoemaker Gottlieb Adam (40) and wife Charlotte, neé Zingler and four children from 12 to 3 years old;\n\nshoemaker Sarnow and wife;\n\nproperty owner Rappräger (44) and wife Maria, neé Langen and four children from 16 to 7 years of age;\n\nunmarried serving girl Luise Gandt (25);\n\nshoemaker Schwarz and wife;\n\ndaily wage earner Fährmann (49) and wife Luise, neé Fährmann;\n\njourneyman saddle maker August Hanuth;\n\nKnurrbusch: daily wage earner Will (30);\n\nScheffin: unmarried Dorothea Kassner (also spelled Kasten) (47).\n\nA list from Schwarz, who returned from America, contained these names as well as those listed above:\n\nPlatchow: servant Gust with wife and two children;\n\nSchwantus, Wollin District: shepherd's assistant Schreiber with four children; from the vicinity of\n\nGreifenberg: blacksmith Lüdke along with wife and two children. Coming from\n\nHakenwalde, Naugard District: Bagans with wife and one child. Furthermore, out of Silesia, specifically from\n\nKönigshain, Görlitz District: journeyman cabinetmaker Johann Gottlieb Hartmann (25).\n\nB. Emigrating to South Australia, perhaps all the people, who were not on the list belonging to the co-migrant Schwarz, but on the list of the district magistrate von Voeltz. Of these the first named most certainly emigrated to Australia, because Lodewyckx established his presence in Australia. From the Kammin District, specifically from\n\nRaddack farmer Friedrich Kleeman (38) with wife Maria, neé Helm and five children from eight to ¼ years;\n\nservant David Piepkorn (31) and his bride, the unmarried Dorothea Westphal (22);\n\nPolchow: former village mayor Grünhagen with wife Auguste, neé Triglaff and three sons of eight, six and five years of age;\n\nSchnatow: journeyman tailor Gottlieb Christian (28), unmarried serving girl Wilhelmine Friderike Christian, sister of Gottlieb (23), Karolina Christian, bride of Gottlieb (21);\n\nshepherd Wallschläger (25) with wife Maria, neé Fährmann (34) and three children of seven, five and three years;\n\nKammin: a separated man named Schaeffer with an underage child;\n\nKucklow: servant Gottfried Rohde.\n\nFrom Silesia, specifically from\n\nGlogau: shoemaker Franz Hasemann with wife Christiane, neé Backstaedt (49) and daughter Mathilde (26).\n\nIn the year 1837 46 people went to America and 28 to Australia, whom we could name.\n\n1838\n\nOf travelers going to American we can give for this year only the two Silesian scouts, specifically from\n\nBreslau: artistic gardener Johann Gottlieb Faude (45) with wife Rosina, neé Schulz (36) and\n\nPastor Leberecht Friedrich Ehregott Krause (34); besides these, from\n\nDenkwitz, Glogau District: journeyman wheelwright Dartsch (39);\n\nFrom page 243\n\nKummernick, Liegnitz District: resident Joh. Gottlieb Riese with wife Elisabeth, neé Bartsch and six children - Joh. Elisabeth (17), Joh. Christiane (16), Johann Karl (13), Joh. Eleonore (11), Joh. Karl August (8), Anna Rosina (2);\n\nJuliusburg, Öls District: weaver Christian Bierosche (45) with wife Maria Elisabeth, neé Pfeiffer (37) and two children: Ernestine Luise (7), Karl Gottlieb (5 months);\n\nKunitz, Liegnitz District: Farmer Benjamin Karl Hegwer and wife Maria Rosina Anna, neé Jigner and seven children: Christiane Charlotte Henrietta, Ernestine Luise, Anna Rosina Christiane, Maria Rosina Karoline, Karl Traugott Bleibtreu, Maria Dorothea, Gottlieb August Benjamin.\n\nIt is possible that all these travelers to America, with the exception of Krause and Faude, in 1838 only went as far as Hamburg and in 1839 commenced their emigration to America.\n\nB. All other emigrating parties from 1838 went to Australia. We order them according to province.

In giving the Posen name roster we need to clarify that this list is questionable\n\nFrom page 247\n\nbecause the Posen emigration acts concerning the reporting of emigration permits were not upheld. We include this list despite its inaccuracies because in most instances the inaccuracies are not all that great.\n\nOur outline comes from two lists of persons wishing to emigrate, compiled in 1836 by the commissions of governmental advisor Süvern and the General Superintendent von Freymark. Both lists are in agreement. The lists indicate a total of 267 people. Of that total 41 people stayed behind, either because they were refused hearings or their petitions for emigration permits were denied. Thus in 1836 in Posen 226 people remained, who were eligible to emigrate. We know from two sources, the letter of a passenger and a later Australian report, that the \"Katharina\" took 130 people from Posen to Australia. This leaves 96 people unaccounted for. Next, we can take into account and reduce that number through a passenger manifest of the \"Prinz Georg\" saved by Lodewydkx listing a Posener name Kaleske with eight family members. Some other Posen natives left in 1838 on another ship going to Australia, the \"Zebra,\" however no list has survived. Other Poseners postponed their trip until the second great migration to Australia in 1841. Many deaths were recorded during the trip. The trip of 1841 snatched away 55 persons. Taking all this into account, it appears that of the 96 people not many would have remained behind in the homeland. Regrettably we have little in the way of roster for this year. Of the 226 names listed here there might be some, who did not emigrate. However we believed it was better to list them as uncertain entries rather than dispense with the entire Posen list. Perhaps later discovered Posen documents might bring clarification. A few Poseners, whom we could verify from reports as having emigrated to Australia, we will mark with an asterisk in the following list.\n\nPossible emigrants going from Posen to Australia in 1838:\n\nFrom the area of:\n\nMeseritz: widower and small farm tenant Joh.
