This is to ensure the database shows persons as deceased.\n\nWhere a record only provides only an age, we have entered the persons birth year (giving us a +/- 1 year margin) as:\n\n(e.g. Age 50 and event occurred 15th March: added as event year less 51 years) as the event occurred before 1st July, or\n\n(e.g. Age 50 and event occurred 15th September: added as event year less 50 years) as the event occurred after 30th June.\n\nWhere there are discrepancies of Family/Surname spellings we have used\n\nthe spelling from the persons Signature (where available) or,\n\nthe 'most common German or Polish name spelling' and/or,\n\nin some instances, the most common spelling from a group of documented records.\n\nFor some Religious Baptism, Confirmation or First Communion records, we have assumed that it took place at the Parish seat.\n\nFamily/Surnames that have non-English characters have NOT been changed (Examples: Riebschläger, Krüger, Mittelstädt, Öhlke, etc.). These are all in the original spellings.\n\nFeminine forms of surname spellings have been converted to masculine. Examples: Kopinska is now Kopinski, Wegnerin is now Wegner.\n\nAll places for events have been entered as the current day place name and the original name and other details are shown in the footnotes. Place names that have non-English characters (especially Polish characters) have been changed to English characters for ease of searching.\n\nJulian Calendar dates have been converted to Gregorian.\n\nSpecial Note regarding documents from 1920 onwards: Some modernisations of the law took place in 1920 after the adoption of the Weimar Reich Constitution. Religion was no longer entered in the documents, as well as the usual additional information about the parents of the person, or the person concerned such as occupation, etc."
