My revised classification provides a novel framework for taxonomic inventories and ecological studies of these groups.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nStaphylinidae, whose members are commonly called rove beetles, is the largest family of the animal kingdom, with an incredible diversity of 65,561 living and 450 extinct species as of 4 March 2021 (A.F. Newton, pers. comm.). Among one extinct and 32 extant subfamilies [1], Tachyporinae is a medium-sized group at the subfamily level and currently comprises 1638 species (28 extinct) of 52 genera (12 extinct) in five tribes as of 9 April 2021 (A.F. Newton, pers. comm.; Appendix A). The family Staphylinidae is so diverse and species-rich, it has been further subdivided into four or five groups of subfamilies [2,3]. The tachyporines have been placed in the Tachyporine Group of subfamilies [4,5]. However, none of these groupings are supported as monophyletic (e.g., [6,7]), and they are all in need of further investigation and proper grouping.\n\nTachyporinae are distributed throughout all zoogeographical regions except for Antarctica (Table A1 and Table A2). At the genus level, many have relatively wide distributional ranges, as listed in Table A1 and Table A2. Interestingly, Leucotachinus Coiffait & Sáiz is distributed disjunctly in South America and Australia, showing a Gondwanan relictual distribution similar to that of the Glypholoma rove beetles [8], Lampriminae stag beetles [9], and moss bugs (Hemiptera: Coleorrhyncha) [10]. In contrast, the members of the current tachyporine tribe Mycetoporini indicate more or less Palearctic or Holarctic distributions, although there are a few cosmopolitan genera (Table A2). Similarly, several genera are limited to one biogeographic region as seen in Vatesus Sharp and Olophrinus Fauvel (Table A1). Many genera are rarely collected, sometimes represented only by a handful of occurrences from the original descriptions (e.g., [11,12]). There are still many undescribed species globally, especially within the genera Sepedophilus Gistel, Tachinus Gravenhorst, or Coproporus Kraatz. Therefore, more new species will continuously be described in the future.\n\nTachyporines are abundant and frequently encountered in forest-associated environments. A characteristic morphological feature is their tapered abdomen as compared to other rove beetles, so they are rather easily recognized to subfamily in insect inventories, faunal investigations, and ecological surveys. Nevertheless, little has been known regarding their biology and ecological habits, though some are thought to be mycophagous or active predators on other arthropods [3]. Most tachyporine species are small to medium in size, commonly found in micro-environments, such as leaf litter, fungi, bark, or dead wood (Figure 1). The genus Vatesus (Figure 1A,B) is famous for its myrmecophilous lifestyle with army ants in Neotropical rain forests [13,14]. Such remarkable ecology resulted in modifications of the overall body structures, including an exaggerated limuloid morphology with a hugely expanded pronotum that has protective functions against worker ants [15]. A few members, e.g., Derops Sharp or Nitidotachinus Campbell, are found in very wet conditions, often along rivers and streams [16]. Sepedophilus has been targeted by evolutionary studies as its feeding habit switches between predatory and mycophagy within the genus for both larvae and adults [17,18]. A recent study suggests that some members of Sepedophilus may be effective pollinators of two Japanese plant species of Arisaema (Araceae) because of their extremely high visitation frequency [19].\n\nFive tribes are currently included in Tachyporinae [20]: Deropini Smetana, Megarthropsini Cameron, Mycetoporini Thomson, Tachyporini MacLeay, and Vatesini Seevers. Although Herman [21] recognized two more tribes, i.e., Symmixini Bernhauer and Cordobanini Bernhauer, within Tachyporinae, the former is now synonymized under Tachyporini [22], and the latter has been transferred to the subfamily Aleocharinae [20]. Three tribes, namely Deropini, Megarthropsini, and Vatesini, are each monogeneric or containing a small group of distinctive tachyporines, resulting focused taxonomic investigations [13,23,24,25]. A number of systematic studies on the remaining tribes of Tachyporinae have been published, but they are mostly restricted geographically and/or taxonomically. One of these tribes, Tachyporini, is by far the largest tribe with more than 1000 species, comprising the vast majority of Tachyporinae in terms of the number of species.\n\nIn spite of their high species richness, Tachyporinae are known as one of the most problematic subfamilies in Staphylinidae, because they are likely a non-monophyletic, and probably polyphyletic, lineage ([3]: Figure 14.30). In fact, several phylogenetic analyses have refuted the monophyly of Tachyporini, Tachyporinae, and even the Tachyporine Group. Non-monophyly of Tachyporinae has been suggested since mid-1970s [26], but Ashe & Newton [27] first indicated the polyphyly of Tachyporinae and Tachyporini on the basis of 27 larval characters with limited taxon sampling. Later, Herman [25] used a phylogenetic approach to examine the internal relationships of the genera of Megarthropsini and assessed the tribe’s systematic position among the other tachyporine tribes. In his tree, the monophyly of Tachyporini was unsupported based on 19 adult characters with very limited taxon sampling [25]. Notably, the Tachyporini genus Coproporus formed a sister group with the Vatesini genus Vatesus in both Ashe & Newton [27] and Herman [25]. Recent molecular studies with extensive taxon sampling of Staphylinoidea have significantly contributed in clarifying internal phylogenies within Staphylinidae and also Tachyporinae. McKenna et al. [6] proposed one of the largest phylogenetic trees of Staphylinidae including three tachyporine tribes, i.e., Deropini, Tachyporini, and Mycetoporini. As a result, Deropini and Tachyporini were recovered together, sister unexpectedly to the carrion beetle family Silphidae, but quite distant from the monophyletic Mycetoporini [6]. Similar results were also obtained in the largest phylogenies of Staphylinoidea [7], in which Vatesus (Vatesini) was clustered with Deropini and Tachyporini. In spite of the dense taxon sampling in these two studies, no representative of Megarthropsini was included [6,7].\n\nOne of the major reasons for a lack of comprehensive tachyporine phylogeny is the difficulty of taxon sampling. Members of Tachyporini are frequently encountered, but belong mostly to the four larger genera, i.e., Sepedophilus, Tachinus, Coproporus, or Tachyporus Gravenhorst. Many other genera are rarely collected, some with only handful of records including the original descriptions. This led to insufficient taxon sampling in phylogenetic studies of the subfamily. Additionally, many of the tachyporine genera have not been adequately explored morphologically, resulting in a significant lack of information useful to constructing phylogenetic trees or generic identification aids. Since there is no previous study targeted at inferring the phylogeny of the entire Tachyporinae subfamily, a large-scale phylogeny of this subfamily including all five tribes is not available at the present, but it is strongly desired in order to determine whether Mycetoporini is a true member of Tachyporinae. To address these issues, I tried to test the monophyly, assess sister group relationships with and within Tachyporinae, and provide a new framework for the subfamily. Herein, the first comprehensive phylogeny and a fully updated higher classification of Tachyporinae are provided based on results of phylogenetic analyses of adult morphological characters and direct examination of specimens encompassing two extinct and all forty extant genera. Finally, several fossil genera with uncertain systematic placements are incorporated into proper taxonomic categories. By reducing phylogenetic uncertainty, my study will contribute to the basic foundation for taxonomic, ecological, and evolutionary studies in the mega-diverse Staphylinidae tree of life.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. General Outline of Study\n\nThe main focus of the present study was to provide a backbone phylogeny of Tachyporinae and to assess sister group relationships of or within the subfamily. Despite the importance of genomic data, I decided to use only adult morphological characters here. One of the reasons is the difficulty of collecting samples from various tachyporine genera. Because the tachyporines include so many rare taxa, it would be quite challenging to obtain molecular samples or even conventional dried, pinned specimens for these taxa. Larval characters generally contain vital information for morphology-based phylogeny in rove beetles (e.g., [2,28,29]). However, the larvae of Tachyporinae are far from adequately understood, resulting in a significant lack of larval information for most genera of Tachyporinae. Even within large genera such as Sepedophilus, Coproporus, or Tachinus, accurate identifications of species considering the larva-adult associations are generally difficult, with a high degree of uncertainty in identification. Taking these conditions into account, my morphological dataset is derived from four different sources: (i) pinned specimens, (ii) wet specimens preserved in 70–80% EtOH (ethyl alcohol) solution, (iii) permanent slide specimens, and (iv) literature (Supplementary Files S1 and S2). Therefore, it was possible to include as many extant tachyporine genera as possible in this study. As Tachyporinae may be a polyphyletic lineage, this approach is currently the best strategy to infer the higher-level phylogeny by reducing the number of potentially phylogenetic “distinct” taxa, i.e., each could represent as own higher-taxonomic category (e.g., tribe). The morphological definition for each tribe has not been well established, thus a morphology-based approach is also desired to solve this issue, rather than relying on a smaller taxon sampling based on molecular data, but such a DNA-oriented study is desired in future.\n\n2.2. Taxon Sampling and Deposition of Material\n\nAll forty extant genera in five tribes of Tachyporinae were used in this study. Although two very rare genera, Tachinoporus Cameron and Tachinoproporus Cameron, were not included in the formal phylogenetic analyses, the type specimens of these taxa were examined and are redescribed below. This is because I could only observe a subset of the characters from dorsal and lateral views, with limited dissected body parts. The dissected parts were generally covered with glue or distorted, and it may have caused erroneous scoring of characters. Therefore, I decided to remove these two taxa from the analyses, but the outline of Tachyporinae still can be drawn without the inclusion of these two taxa. For most terminal taxa in phylogenetic analyses, morphological data were obtained at least partially from direct observation, with the exception of Urolitus Silvestri (from literature only). In addition, two fossil tachyporine genera, namely †Mesotachyporus Gusarov and †Procileoporus Yamamoto, were directly examined based on the holotypes of each type species, whereas the remaining eight fossil genera were studied from references to evaluate their systematic assignments.\n\nA total of 70 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were scored for the cladistic analyses, comprised of 57 species in 38 genera of Tachyporinae and 13 representatives of ten other selected subfamilies of Staphylinidae, together with one Silphidae (subfamily Silphinae), as outgroups (Supplementary Files S1 and S2). At least one representative for each subfamily of the Tachyporine Group was included: Aleocharinae, Habrocerinae, Olisthaerinae, Phloeocharinae, and Trichophyinae. More outgroups were carefully chosen based on the results of McKenna et al. [6] and Lü et al. [7], namely Neophoninae, Omaliinae, Osoriinae, Pseudopsinae, Staphylininae, and Silphidae.\n\nMaterial from the following collections was examined: American Museum of Natural History, New York, USA (AMNH: D. Grimaldi); Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IL, USA (FMNH: C. Maier, J. Snyder, or A. F. Newton for wet and slide collections); Kyushu University Museum, Fukuoka, Japan (KUM: M. Maruyama); Muséum d’histoire naturelle de Genève, Geneva, Switzerland (MHNG: G. Cuccodoro); National Museum of Nature and Science, Tsukuba, Japan (NSMT: S. Nomura, private collection); Natural History Museum, London, London, UK (BMNH: M. Geiser); Natural History Museum Vienna, Vienna, Austria (NHMW: H. Schillhammer).\n\nThe original higher classification follows Bouchard et al. [20]. A complete list of the taxa used with their collecting data is shown in Supplementary Files S1 and S2. To enhance the understanding the morphological details of Tachyporinae, a series of photographs is shown in the paper.\n\n2.3. Microscopy, Imaging, Measurements, and Terminology\n\nObservations of dry and wet specimens and some permanent slides were made under a Leica MZ16 stereomicroscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Amber fossils were examined using either a Leica MZ16 or a Nikon SMZ1500 stereomicroscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) in air, without immersion in oil or similar liquid. Photographs of dry specimens were taken using an EOS 80D digital camera (Canon, Tokyo, Japan) mounted on an extreme macro lens (Canon MP-E 65 mm, F2.8, 1–5×; Canon) with a flash (Canon Macro Twin Lite MT-24EX Flash; Canon) as light source. The dissected body parts of Tachinoproporus were photographed with the Dun Ink BK PLUS Lab System (Dun, Palmyra, VA, USA) attached to a 6D digital camera (Canon) and a 10× lens. A single amber fossil of †Mesotachyporus was photographed by David Grimaldi (AMNH) using a Nikon Digital Sight DS-R1i camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) as an attachment of a Nikon SMZ1500 stereomicroscope. Slide specimens were imaged using an EOS 80D camera and an AmScope CA-CAN-SLR Canon SLR/DSLR Camera Adapter for Microscopes (AmScope Microsystem, USA), mounted on an Olympus BX50 stereomicroscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Montage images were later produced using Helicon Focus 7.5.4 (Helicon Soft, Kharkiv, Ukraine), but †Mesotachyporus images were optimized with NIS-Elements D (Nikon). All images were edited and assembled in plates in Photoshop Elements 15 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). The measurements are given in millimetres. The total body length was measured from the apex of the clypeus to the posterior end of the abdomen. The maximum lengths were measured in the head, pronotum, and each elytron (elytral lengths were measured from each elytron with the maximum lengths and widths). The ratios of elytral length and width were calculated basically based on dissected specimens. Some diagnostic characters are indicated with arrows and/or character numbers on the figures. For descriptions and character list, I generally followed the morphological terminology of Blackwelder [30], Herman [25], and Ashe [28]. The age of Baltic amber is controversial from middle to late Eocene, but I followed the mid-Eocene (Lutetian: 44.1 ± 1.1 Ma) age in this study based on the most recent estimations obtained by the absolute dating analyses of glauconites from the “Blaue Erde” (blue earth) layer in Sambia Peninsula [31]. The higher-resolution figure plates used in this study have been deposited in the figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14179529; accessed on 9 April 2021) and Zenodo repositories (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4660863; accessed on 9 April 2021). This published work has been registered in ZooBank, with the following LSIDs (Life Science Identifiers): urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:8F45A3EA-4193-49D3-BF57-A65332D3262C.\n\n2.4. Selection of Characters\n\nOne of the most challenging points in constructing the tachyporine phylogeny based on morphology is the selection of characters. Since there is no study specifically focused on the entire Tachyporinae with dense sampling of taxa and characters, I needed to extract some characters from the literature treating mainly non-Tachyporinae such as Ashe [28] or Grebennikov & Newton [2]. Consequently, most characters used here are new and original for Tachyporinae. Some characters used in generic identification were not adopted in this study such as the conditions of spines at the apices of the meso- and metatibiae, pronotal chaetotaxy, or the basomedial carina of the scutellum in Mycetoporini (e.g., [32,33]) because of the significant variations found in a broad set of the outgroups and difficulty to accurately assess these characters in Tachyporinae s. str. Accordingly, this study intended to reveal the relationship between Mycetoporini and the rest of Tachyporinae, and the internal tribal relationship in Tachyporinae s. str., rather than the generic relationships within Mycetoporini.\n\nAs a result of my extensive morphological investigations on Tachyporinae and the other staphylinoid outgroups, the final character list is comprised of a total of 156 binary and multi-state characters, taken from various parts of the adult body: 18 from head, 4 from antennae, 26 from mouthparts, 56 from thorax and legs, 36 from abdomen, and 16 from genitalia (10 from male, 6 from female). To evaluate generic level characters, possible autapomorphies for some genera were also included. In the present paper, I also aim to provide morphological resources for diagnostic key characters in Tachyporinae. Thus, habitus photographs representing all extant genera are shown here, together with diverse characters across all body parts of the selected taxa and their associated type-specimen labels for some taxa. The complete list of characters with explanations and post-evaluations is given in the Appendix B.\n\n2.5. Phylogenetic Analyses\n\nThe character matrix was created in Mesquite version 3.61 [34], with missing character states coded as ‘?’. My final data matrix included 156 characters scored for 70 terminal taxa (57 ingroup Tachyporinae, 13 non-tachyporine outgroups). The nexus formatted file containing the character matrix with the resulting phylogenetic trees is provided in Supplementary File S3, with the addition of TNT format matrix as Supplementary File S4. In all analyses, Lispinus quadripunctulus Fauvel, 1864 [35] (Osoriinae: Thoracophorini) was chosen to root the trees, considering the results of McKenna et al. [6]. This decision seems to be reasonable after testing different outgroups to root the trees as L. quadripunctulus resulted in smallest number of trees. The software TNT version 1.5 [36] was used for maximum parsimony (MP) analysis using the ‘New Technology search’ option to find the most parsimonious trees (MPTs) with all characters treated as unordered and equally weighted. In order to estimate branch support on a cladogram, I calculated Bootstrap support values generated via TNT version 1.5 under the following parameters: memory set to hold 99,999 trees; slack for sectors set to 80 by entering a command line, “sect:slack 80”; ‘absolute frequencies’ under ‘new technology search’ option with 2000 replications, collapsing groups below 1. Character distributions were mapped using WinClada version 1.00.08 [37]. Nodes with bootstrap values were considered with the following criteria: bootstrap values (BV) > 90 were judged to be strongly supported; with BV = 90–70 moderately supported; with BV = 70–50 weakly supported, and; with BV < 50 unsupported.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Phylogenetic Analyses\n\n3.1.1. Maximum Parsimony Analysis\n\nMaximum parsimony analysis yielded only three most parsimonious trees, each with the following characteristics: tree length (TL) = 977, consistency index (CI) = 0.38, and retention index (RI) = 0.78. The resulting trees were largely congruent with previous studies, although many nodes were weakly supported or not supported. A strict consensus tree is shown here as the representative of the result (TL = 981, CI = 0.37, RI = 0.77; Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4).\n\nAs in earlier studies [6,7], Tachyporinae were found to be polyphyletic and divided into two distant clades: one consisting of Mycetoporini (Figures 2–4, clade B in Figures 3 and 4) and the other containing the rest of the remaining tachyporines (Figures 2–4, clade D in Figures 3 and 4). Mycetoporini formed a sister group to Olisthaerus Dejean (Olisthaerinae; Figures 2–4, clade A in Figures 3 and 4) with moderate support, and these two combined was found to be sister to Quedius Stephens (Staphylininae). The Mycetoporini clade was strongly supported as a monophyletic group (Figure 3). Within Mycetoporini, two genera combined, i.e., Parabolitobius L.-Z. Li, M.-J. Zhao & Sakai + Bolitobius Leach, were revealed as sister to the rest of the mycetoporines. However, this relationship was not statistically supported (Figure 3). Lordithon Thomson was found to be polyphyletic (Figure 2), whereas Bryoporus Kraatz formed a monophyletic group (Figures 2–4).\n\nTachyporinae, in the narrow sense, was also resolved as a monophylum with moderate support value (Figures 2–4, clade D in Figures 3 and 4), forming a sister group to Silpha Linnaeus (Silphidae) with weak support (Figures 2–4, clade C in Figures 3 and 4). The genera with more than two species included in the analysis were recovered as monophyletic, except that the enigmatic Urolitus nigeriensis and Tachyporus nitidulus (Fabricius) came out within Sepedophilus and outside Tachyporus, respectively, as in Figure 2. The tribe Tachyporini was shown here to be paraphyletic, divided into a total of nine clades (Figure 2). Two tribes, Vatesini and Megarthropsini, were each found to be monophyletic, but were resolved within parts of the paraphyletic Tachyporini (Figure 2). Tachyporini sensu str. (Figures 2–4, clade E in Figures 3 and 4), which contains the type genus Tachyporus, formed a sister group to the other Tachyporinae lineage comprised of Vatesini, Deropini, and Megarthropsini, and the rest of Tachyporini. Tachyporini sensu str. was moderately supported and divided into two clades, i.e., the unsupported Tachyporus-related genera (Figures 2–4, clade G in Figures 3 and 4) and the strongly supported Sepedophilus-related genera (Figures 2–4, clade F in Figures 3 and 4). This clade (clade E in Figures 3 and 4) is the moderately supported sister group of the weakly supported clade H (Figure 3), which includes Deropini and Megarthropsini in addition to the some Tachyporini genera related to Coproporus (Figures 2–4, clade I in Figures 3 and 4). Vatesus, the sole member of Vatesini, was strongly supported as monophyletic, belonging in the weakly supported clade I. In clade I, Cileoporus Campbell first diverged within this clade, followed by Cilea Jacquelin du Val, and Vatesus (Figures 2–4). The monophyletic Coporoporus formed a sister group relationship with Termitoplus (Figures 2–4). Subsequently, clade I was recovered as a sister group to clade K (Figures 3 and 4), wherein Deropini (clade L in Figures 3 and 4), Megarthropsini (clade P in Figures 3 and 4), and the remaining Tachyporini with the Tachinus-related genera were nested within it (Figures 2–4). Within clade M (Figures 3 and 4), Nitidotachinus Campbell was a sister taxon to all other members of this clade, and the strongly supported Megarthropsini (clade P in Figures 3 and 4) was resolved within it. Clade M (Figures 3 and 4) was further divided into two subclades: typical members of Tachinus and its allies (clade N in Figures 3 and 4) and atypical ones (clade O in Figures 3 and 4). Deropini was strongly supported as monophyletic, but the clade K (Figures 3 and 4) resulting from the combination of Deropini and clade M (Figures 3 and 4) has moderate support, and clade M alone was unsupported as were all but two of its included suprageneric subclades (Figures 2–4). Contrary to Herman [25], I found that Deropini is distantly related to Megarthropsini, rather than forming sister groups (Figure 2), although a direct comparison between the studies is difficult because of the different study design and taxonomic sampling. Based on observation of morphological characters and their phylogenetic analysis, a new classification is proposed, as shown in Figure 5.\n\n3.1.2. Character Optimization\n\nThe unambiguously optimized characters were mapped in Figure 4. Clade A (Figures 3 and 4), the sister group relationship between Olisthaerus (Olisthaerinae) and Mycetoporini was supported by two unique synapomorphies (71-2, elytra with three rows of setigerous punctures; 132-3, sternite VIII in posterior half covered with short to long setae in V-shaped punctures) and seven homoplasious synapomorphies. The distant tachyporine tribe Mycetoporini (clade B) was supported by two exclusive synapomorphies (98-2, metacoxae markedly large in each lateral half; 149-2, parameres each with a row of parameral setae at least partially aligned) and nine non-exclusive synapomorphies. Clade C (Figures 3 and 4), Silpha (Silphidae), and its inferred sister taxon to the remaining tachyporine genera was supported by one exclusive synapomorphy (67-2, mesospiracular peritremes (sensu Blackwelder [30]: Figure 3A,E) fully sclerotized, conspicuous and six non-exclusive synapomorphies. The true tachyporines, i.e., clade D (Figures 3 and 4), were supported by five unique synapomorphies (11-1, midcranial suture present; 117-3, female tergite VIII with lobes; 143-2, parameres with apical inner margins only narrowly separated longitudinally from each other; 154-0, gonocoxite II small in comparison with gonostylus; 155-1, gonocoxite II covered with curved setae) and nine homoplasious synapomorphies. Within clade (D) Tachyporini sensu str. (clade E in Figures 3 and 4) showed a sister group relationship to the remaining tachyporine members except Mycetoporini, and was supported by ten non-exclusive synapomorphies, such as strikingly densely setose maxillary palpomere 3 (32-1), pubescent ground microsetae on elytra (74-2), and tergites IV–V with macrosetae on posterolateral edges (109-1). Two subclades of clade E were the Sepedophilus-related genera (clade F in Figures 3 and 4) and Tachyporus and its relatives (clade G in Figures 3 and 4): the clade F was supported by three unique synapomorphies (e.g., 97-1, protibia with longitudinal row of closely spaced spines along outer margin; 124-2, abdominal segments V–VI without paratergites) and seven homoplasious synapomorphies (clade F), whereas the clade G (Figures 3 and 4) was supported by six homoplasious synapomorphies only (e.g., 57-1, pronotum with arranged stout setae; 75-1, elytron with macrosetae on median area; 125-0, sternite III without longitudinal median basal carina). Clade H was a relatively large monophylum which includes the members of Vatesini, Deropini, Megarthropsini, and the rest of Tachyporini, and it was supported by four unique synapomorphies (114-1, tergite VIII with only a few to several distinct macrosetae; 123-2, male tergite IX with only single to several prominent macrosetae, restricted to apex; 133-1, sternite VIII with only a few to several distinct macrosetae; 137-3, female sternite VIII with lobes, including small internal lobes) and one homoplasious synapomorphy. Clade I was comprised of Vatesini and the Coproporus-related genera of Tachyporini, supported by nine non-exclusive synapomorphies, including only weakly developed postcoxal process with rounded apex behind procoxae (61-1), thin, blade-like lateral and posterior margins of elytra (82-1), and distinctly large procoxae (96-3). Clade K (Figures 3 and 4), a sister group relationship between Deropini (clade L) and clade M, was supported by two exclusive synapomorphies (130-2, male sternite VII with moderately to strongly concave posteromedial margin; 131-2, male sternite VII with more than several to dozens of peg-like setae along posteromedial margin) and seven non-exclusive synapomorphies. Within clade K, Deropini was well supported by six unique synapomorphies (12-4, middle of postocular area distinctly narrowed, all around; 32-3, maxillary palpomere 3 completely glabrous; 49-1, pronotum moderately constricted in posterior half; 51-2, pronotum with uniform punctation dense, but shallow in apical half; 128-1, sternite VII along basomedial margin with a broad, semicircular protrusion; 135-3, male sternite VIII with posterior margin deeply incised or strongly emarginate medially) and additionally by 16 homoplasious synapomorphies. Compared to Deropini, its sister clade M (Figures 3 and 4), comprised of Megarthropsini and the Tachinus-related genera of Tachyporini, was weakly supported by only three non-exclusive synapomorphies, namely: 58-1, pronotum with transverse cluster of blackish to blackish brown, conspicuous small pores near posterior margin (Figure 54G); 138-4, female sternite VIII having both prominent lobes and inner lobes with rows of more than three, minute sensory setae in fan-like arrangement, located in apical area of each inner lobe; 151-1, spermatheca well sclerotized, comparatively complex or distinctively complicated structure, usually associated with coils. Megarthropsini (clade P in Figures 3 and 4) formed a sister clade to the genus Austrotachinus Steel. Clade P was supported by two unique synapomorphies (3-3, head with large punctation uniformly on vertex; 5-2, head with moderately rough or tuberculate surface) and eight homoplasious synapomorphies.\n\n3.2.

See Table A1 for overview and distributions. See also Appendix A.\n\nTribe Tachyporini MacLeay, 1825 [40] sensu nov.\n\n-\n\nSubtribe Tachyporina MacLeay, 1825 [40] stat. nov., sensu nov.\n\n-\n\nSubtribe Euconosomatina Cameron, 1918 [44] stat. rev., sensu nov.\n\nTribe Vatesini Seevers, 1958 [13] sensu nov.\n\nTribe Deropini Smetana, 1983 [23]\n\nTribe Tachinusini Fleming, 1821 [45] stat. rev., sensu nov.\n\nFossils: Fossil records of Tachyporinae sensu nov. from both the Cenozoic and Mesozoic are relatively prevalent and even abundant, found mainly from the various Holarctic deposits ([46,47]; see details in each of the taxonomic category below). †Leehermania prorova Chatzimanolis et al., 2012, the Upper Triassic fossil species from the Cow Branch Formation of southern Virginia, USA, was described as the oldest Staphylinidae and the earliest representative of Polyphaga [48]. In the original description, it was suggested that there is a possible affinity with Tachyporinae, or its close relatives [48]. Contrary to doubts of the systematic position of the fossil outside of Staphylinidae [2], Chatzimanolis [47] again recognized †Leehermania as the oldest described staphylinoid beetle. Nevertheless, †Leehermania was recently moved to an extinct lineage within the small beetle suborder Myxophaga, closest to the modern family Hydroscaphidae, based on re-examination of the type material and rigorous phylogenetic analyses [49]. As there are no staphylinid fossils found from the Triassic deposits, the most reliable oldest fossil records of Tachyporinae sensu nov. date back to the Middle to Upper Jurassic based on compression fossils found in China, Kazakhstan, and Australia [49,50,51,52]. Most described tachyporine fossils are compressions, whereas only a handful of amber inclusions have been described so far (Table A1 and Table A2).\n\nNotes on family-group names: The present study on Tachyporinae (in the current sense) resurrects a little-used family-group name based on Tachinus. The taxonomic treatment (Opinion 1743) is made by The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) [53]. This opinion established the family-group name priority for names based on Tachyporus over those based on Tachinus and emended the stem of the family-group names based on Tachinus to Tachinus- instead of Tachin- because of the (senior) homonymy of the latter with the extremely widely used family name Tachinidae in Diptera (based on Tachina Meigen) [53]. It also added names to the Official Lists of names in zoology and designated type species that are relevant in some cases [53].\n\nRemarks: A series of significant changes are made for the new definition of Tachyporinae sensu nov. and its tribal divisions (Figure 5). After my phylogenetic analyses and observations, the revised classification contains the four tribes as listed there. This means that the originally included tribe Mycetoporini is now excluded from Tachyporinae, and is raised to subfamily rank (see below and Discussion). Therefore, the former classification comprised of five tribes is rejected here. Although I could not examine most of the tachyporine fossils, they are putatively assigned to the newly defined tribes based on available information. Two extant tachyporine genera, namely Tachinoporus and Tachinoproporus, were unambiguously placed in Tachyporinae sensu nov. on the basis of my direct examination of the type material.\n\nThe revised classification also sheds light on their ecology and microhabitats. Although there is significant lack of ecological information for the tachyporine taxa used here, I speculate a possible ecological trend for Tachyporinae sensu nov. First, semi-aquatic taxa are found only in Deropini and Tachinusini stat. rev., sensu nov. (clade E in Figures 3 and 4), and at least some members seem to be adapted such environments. Second, social parasitism is only found in Tachyporini sensu nov. (myrmecophilous only: Lamprinodes Luze and Lamprinus Heer) and Vatesini sensu nov. (myrmecophilous: Vatesus; termitophilous: Termitoplus Silvestri). A possible termitophile, Sepedophilus nigeriensis (Silvestri, 1947), comb. nov. (= ‘Urolitus’ nigeriensis Silvestri, 1947 [54] (see Euconosomatina stat. rev., sensu nov. section below)), was probably incidentally collected from a termite nest, lacking any adaptive morphological features on the body based on the original description [54]. All other tachyporine genera have putatively free-living lifestyles.\n\n3.2.2.

See Table A1 for overview and distributions.\n\nSubtribe Tachyporina MacLeay, 1825 [40] stat. nov., sensu nov.\n\nSubtribe Euconosomatina Cameron, 1918 [44] stat. rev., sensu nov.\n\nRemarks: The newly defined tribe Tachyporini sensu nov. contains only the core-members of the tribe, namely the Tachyporus-related and Sepedophilus-related genera, with a newly established subtribal division as above. This led to the exclusion of many genera previously treated as ‘Tachyporini’, such as Coproporus and Tachinus. Based on the results of the phylogenetic analyses, Tachyporini sensu nov. forms a sister group to the rest of Tachyporinae sensu nov.\n\n3.2.3. Subtribe Tachyporina MacLeay, 1825 stat. nov., sensu nov.\n\nTachyporina MacLeay, 1825: 49 [40] (Figures 2–13; Table A1)\n\nType genus: Tachyporus Gravenhorst, 1802 [41]: 124 (= †Mesotachyporus Gusarov, 2000 [56]: 256 syn. nov.).\n\nDifferential diagnosis: Tachyporina stat. nov., sensu nov. differs from members of Euconosomatina stat. rev., sensu nov. based on the following combination of characters: head and pronotum glabrous (sparsely and inconspicuous, if present), pronotum with arranged macrosetae, protibia without longitudinal row of close-spaced spines along outer margin, metatarsus clearly shorter than whole length of metatibia, and abdomen with single pair of paratergites.\n\nEmended diagnosis: Body rather less convex above in cross section (e.g., Figure 6A,D,F), with usually moderate-width pronotal hypomera (Figure 11A: 60-1); surface somewhat glossy, typically glabrous on head and pronotum (e.g., Figure 7A,C,D: 4-0, 53-0); color usually bright, at least on elytra for many taxa (e.g., Figure 6A,B,D,F); gular sutures not distinctly divergent in basal-most areas (Figure 10E: 16-0); maxillary lacinia with unarticulated large, long spine at apex (e.g., Figure 10C: 37-1); mentum with anterior margin more or less linear; pronotum with characteristically arranged macrosetae (e.g., Figures 7A and 11A: 57-1); prosternum with sternacoxal ridge (tsr) moderately distant from anterior margin of prosternum, without prominent modification of furcasternum (Figure 11A: 63-0); protibia without longitudinal row of close-spaced spines along outer margin (e.g., Figure 12A: 97-0); procoxal cavities always open behind (Figure 11A: 66-0); elytron usually with very narrow epipleural gutter along outer margin (Figure 7D: 79-1) (but absent in Palporus; Figure 7: 79-0), bearing arranged macrosetae on surface in most taxa (e.g., Figures 7B,D, 8A and 11E: 75-1, 76-1, 77-1); mesoventrite without longitudinal median carina (Figure 11D: 85-0); metatarsus long, more than half length of metatibia, but shorter than whole length of metatibia (e.g., Figure 7E: 103-0); abdomen with a single pair of paratergites on segments III–VII (e.g., Figure 7E: 124-0); sternite III without longitudinal median carina (e.g., Figure 12C: 125-0); female sternite VIII frequently with a pair of feebly developed projections along posterior margin (Figure 12D: 137-2); sclerotized spermatheca absent.\n\nComposition: Five genera, with 144 species (4 extinct). See Table A1 for overview and distributions.\n\nLamprinodes Luze, 1901 [57]: 181.\n\nType species: Tachyporus saginatus Gravenhorst, 1806 [58]: 6.\n\nLamprinus Heer, 1839 [59]: 286.\n\nType species: Lamprinus lasserrei Heer, 1839 [59]: 286 (= Oxyporus erythropterus Panzer, 1796 [60]: pl. 21).\n\nPalporus Campbell, 1979 [61]: 11 stat. nov.\n\nType species: Staphylinus nitidulus Fabricius, 1781 [62]: 337.\n\nSymmixus Bernhauer, 1915 [63]: 56.\n\nType species: Symmixus sikkimensis Bernhauer, 1915 [63]: 57.\n\nTachyporus Gravenhorst, 1802 [41] sensu nov. (= †Mesotachyporus Gusarov, 2000 [56]: 256 syn. nov.).\n\nType species: Staphylinus chrysomelinus Linnaeus, 1758 [38]: 423.\n\nFossils: Similar to the abovementioned situation of Sepedophilus, the fossils of Tachyporus sensu nov. are also diverse and abundant in mid-Eocene Baltic amber ([64,65]; Yamamoto, pers. obs.), but with only a single described species, Tachyporus bicoloratus Paśnik, 2005 [66]. The only extinct genus †Mesotachyporus has been known from the Mesozoic [56], but it is here synonymized under Tachyporus (see discussion below). From the Cenozoic, †Tachyporus annosus Herman, 2001 [67] (= †T. nigripennis Scudder, 1900) [68] is known from the Eocene Florissant deposit in Colorado, USA [21]. Additionally, there is a Tachyporus fossil found from early Middle Miocene Dominican amber [69], but it has not yet been described.\n\nRemarks. This newly defined subtribe contains the type genus of Tachyporinae sensu. nov., namely Tachyporus sensu nov. Compared to the subtribe Euconosomatina stat. rev., sensu nov., the members of Tachyporina stat. nov., sensu nov. share the conserved body plan including the presence of paratergites, and all species lack the comb-like spines on the protibiae.\n\nThe tachyporine monobasic tribe Symmixini Bernhauer, 1915 [61] had been recognized until rather recently [21], but this tribe was synonymized under Tachyporini by Schülke [22]. In this study, I have examined the type genus Symmixus, specifically the holotype of the type species (Figures 6D,E and 8), and found that it is indeed very close to Tachyporus sensu nov. in many aspects, although Symmixus has the characteristically modified metatarsomere 3 [22]. In light of this conclusion and the phylogenetic results, the synonymy of Symmixini is maintained here and I have placed it in this subtribe.\n\n3.2.4. Genus Tachyporus Gravenhorst, 1802 sensu nov.\n\nTachyporus Gravenhorst, 1802: 124 [41] (Figures 2–4, 6F, 7A,E, 9A,B,D, 10A,E, 11B, 13 and Figure S1B,D; Table A1)\n\n= †Mesotachyporus Gusarov, 2000 [56]: 256 syn. nov.\n\nType species: Staphylinus chrysomelinus Linnaeus, 1758 [38]: 423.\n\nDiagnosis: See Campbell [61], as subgenus Tachyporus.\n\nRemarks: Previously, the genus Tachyporus included two subgenera, Tachyporus sensu str. and Palporus Campbell [21,61,70]. In this study, I have recognized only Tachyporus sensu str. as members of the newly defined genus Tachyporus sensu. nov. Palporus is raised to a distinct genus based on observation of morphological characters and their phylogenetic analyses (see below).\n\nThe extinct monotypic genus †Mesotachyporus from Upper Cretaceous (Turonian) New Jersey amber can undoubtedly be assigned to this subtribe on the basis of general morphological similarity with Tachyporus in the traditional sense, namely the overall body shape, short and slender maxillary palpomere 4, antennal pubescence, general shape of the pronotum, and chaetotaxy of the elytra (Figure 13A,B,D,E; [56]; see also a habitus photograph in Grimaldi et al. [71]: Figure 8A). During the course of my study, I re-examined the holotype of †Mesotachyporus puer Gusarov, 2000 [56] to unveil the generic identity and to extract more characters for the genus and species. As a result, the only notable difference between †Mesotachyporus and Tachyporus is the presence of markedly shortened first tarsomeres in †Mesotachyporus, compared to recent Tachyporus species, as already mentioned in the original description [56]. However, this character alone is not enough to justify the generic validity. Similarly, a fossil species of megalopsidiine rove beetle in mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber (the Albian–Cenomanian boundary or older) from northern Myanmar, which also has similarly reduced first tarsomeres compared with the modern congeners, was placed in the extant genus Megalopinus Eichelbaum, rather than creating a new genus [72]. Here, †Mesotachyporus syn. nov. is not maintained at generic rank, but is synonymized under Tachyporus sensu nov. The new combination, †Tachyporus puer (Gusarov, 2000) [56] comb. nov., is established here. This fossil species may represent another example of bradytely, showing long-term morphological stasis of an organismal lineage over deep evolutionary time [73]. This phenomenon has frequently been found in beetles, particularly Staphylinoidea, in Kachin amber (e.g., [74,75,76,77]), and Clarke & Chatzimanolis [74] suggested that the continuous presence of mesic habitats over geological time had contributed to such morphological stability. As Chatzimanolis [47] noted, studies assessing the background of this phenomenon based on statistical evidence will be desired. On the other hand, there are some staphylinid taxa known from Kachin amber with unusual morphological features compared to Recent relatives [78,79,80,81]. Further discovery may reveal morphological diversity and evolution in the Mesozoic.\n\n3.2.5. Genus Palporus Campbell, 1979 stat nov.\n\nPalporus Campbell, 1979: 11 [61] (Figures 3, 4, 6C, 7B, 10B, 11A,C,E, 12F and Supplementary Figure S1A,C; Table A1)\n\nType species: Staphylinus nitidulus Fabricius, 1781 [62]: 337.\n\nDiagnosis: See Campbell [61].\n\nComposition: Two species, as listed below.\n\nnitidulus (Fabricius, 1781 [62]: 337), comb. nov. (Staphylinus). Distribution: Palaearctic, Oriental, and Afrotropical Regions; intro. Nearctic and Australian Regions.\n\n* See Herman [21] and Schülke & Smetana [70] for synonymic information.\n\nneomexicanus (Campbell, 1979 [61]: 14), comb. nov. (Tachyporus). Distribution: USA (New Mexico, Colorado).\n\nRemarks: The subgenus Palporus Campbell was established for the two Tachyporus species in a study of the North American Tachyporus [61]. Since the original description, no additional species have been included in Palporus. This subgenus was characterized by the following combination of characters [61]: body small (less than 1.4 mm), slender; elytra narrower, parallel-sided, and; maxillary palpus with palpomere 4 short and thick, etc.\n\nAs a result of the phylogenetic analyses (Figures 3 and 4), Palporus, i.e., Palporus nitidulus comb. nov. (= Tachyporus nitidulus; Figures 6C, 7B, 10B, 11A,E,C 12F, and Supplementary Figure S1A,C), was separated from the Tachyporus clade, which is comprised of three species of Tachyporus sensu str., including the type species of Tachyporus, namely Tachyporus chrysomelinus (Figures 6F and 12B). The internal generic relationship within Tachyporina stat. nov., sensu nov. was not statistically supported by the lower bootstrap values (Figure 3), resulting in weak evidence for the generic status of Palporus. However, several morphological evidences probably justify this new generic validity.\n\nAs mentioned above, Palporus can be separated from Tachyporus sensu str. by the general body form in having smaller and more slender body [61], with more or less parallel-sided elytra which widest in middle (Figure 7B: 69-1). In Tachyporina stat. nov., sensu nov., the typical members have basally widened pronotum, with the maximum width situated at, or near, the base in most taxa (except Symmixus). In contrast, Palporus species have distinct pronotum in comparison with three genera (Tachyporus, Lamprinus, and Lamprinodes), with the maximum width located between the basal 1/4 and middle of the pronotum (Figure 7B: 50-3). These three genera have posteriorly broadened pronotum widest at or near base (Figure 7D: 50-1), whereas the widest point of the pronotum in Symmixus is located between basal 1/5 and basal 1/4 (Figure 8A: 50-2). Moreover, Symmixus can be discriminated from Palporus by having more elongate elytron (ratio of length/width: >1.8×; Figures 6D and 8D: 70-0), and Palporus has shorter and less elongate elytron (length/width: 1.3–1.8×; Figures 6C and 7B: 70-1). Another distinct feature is the structures of the maxillary palpi (Figures 10B and Supplementary Figure S1A). The maxillary palpomere 3 of Palporus is very thick and strongly expanded, but the remaining other Tachyporina stat. nov., sensu nov. genera do not have such structure. In Lamprinus and Lamprinodes, the maxillary palpomere 3 is gradually widened apically and widest at (or near) the apex (Figures 10C, D: 30-0). On the other hand, Tachyporus and Symmixus has weakly expanded maxillary palpomere 3, with the widest point located around middle of the palpomere (Figures 10A and Supplementary Figure S1B: 30-1). The density of ground setation on maxillary palpomere 3 is also clearly different. In Palporus, it is much more densely covered with setae than in the other genera. The maxillary palpomere 4 is also distinctive in Palporus; it is very short and thick, clearly broader than that of the rest of Tachyporina stat. nov., sensu nov. (Figure 10B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Furthermore, this palpomere is unusual in Palporus as it is abruptly narrower in apical third (Supplementary Figure S1B, arrow), and it is prominently densely pubescent ([61]: Figure 84) (see also Figure S1A). I found another characteristic feature in the female genitalia of Palporus. The gonostylus in Palporus is much longer than gonocoxite II (Supplementary Figure S1C), but it is only slightly to moderately longer, or even shorter, than gonocoxite II in the other members of Tachyporina stat. nov., sensu nov. (Figure 12G and Supplementary Figure S1D). Finally, Palporus is the unique taxon which completely lacks epipleural gutter along the outer margin of elytron in Tachyporina stat. nov., sensu nov. (Figure 7B: 79-0).\n\nIn light of morphological characters and their phylogenetic analyses, these subgenera should be considered as separate genera, i.e., Tachyporus sensu nov. and Palporus stat. nov.\n\n3.2.6. Subtribe Euconosomatina Cameron, 1918 stat. rev., sensu nov.\n\nEuconosomatina Cameron, 1918: 216 [44] (Figures 1C, 2–5 and 14–20; Table A1)\n\nType genus: Euconosoma Cameron, 1918 [44]: 215.\n\nDifferential diagnosis: Euconosomatina stat. rev., sensu nov. differs from members of Tachyporina stat. nov., sensu nov. based on the following combination of characters: head and pronotum densely pubescent with silky fine setae, pronotum without arranged macrosetae, protibia with longitudinal row of close-spaced spines along outer margin, metatarsus very long, much longer than whole length of metatibia, and abdomen without paratergites.\n\nEmended diagnosis: Body rather strongly convex above in cross section (e.g., Figures 14D,F and 15B), with wide pronotal hypomera (Figure 18B: 60-2); surface less glossy, uniformly densely pubescent including head and pronotum with silky fine setae (e.g., Figure 15B–D: 4-2, 53-2, 74-2); color usually black to dark reddish brown (Figure 14), sometimes with colorful spots or maculations (Figures 14A,E and 15C); gular sutures strongly divergent sides, nearly transverse, in basal 1/4 (Figure 16B: 16-1); maxillary lacinia without unarticulated large, long spine at apex (e.g., Figure 16E: 37-0); labium with ligula sometimes with medial premental lobes and large, peg-like setae (Figure 16F: 44-3); mentum with anterior margin broadly rounded (Figure 16B: 47-2); pronotum widest at base, densely pubescent, lacking arranged stout setae (e.g., Figure 15B,C: 50-0, 53-2, 57-0); prosternum with sternacoxal ridge (tsr) very close to anterior margin of prosternum (Figure 18C: 63-1), with frequently modified furcasternum (Figure 18A: 65-1); protibia with longitudinal row of close-spaced spines along outer margin (Figure 17B,C: 97-1), except †Palaeosepedophilus [82]; protarsi with basal three tarsomeres expanded (Figures 15A and 17C); meso- and metatibial apices bordered by ctenidium of evenly arranged dense equal length spines with much larger apical spur (Figures 15D, 17D); procoxal cavities occasionally closed behind (e.g., Figure 18A: 66-1); elytron without epipleural gutter along outer margin (Figure 15C: 79-0), lacking arranged stout setae in most taxa as in Figure 15C, D (except the Sepedophilus scriptus species group; Figure 18F: 76-1, 77-1); mesoventrite with longitudinal median carina (Figure 19A: 85-1), except Euconosoma; metatarsus very long, much longer than whole length of metatibia (e.g., Figure 15D: 103-1); abdomen without paratergites, with only sutures (Figure 15D: 124-2); sternite III with longitudinal median carina (Figure 19B: 125-1); female sternite VIII with posterior margin unmodified, lacking a pair of feebly developed projections (Figure 19D: 137-0); spermatheca sclerotized, simple.\n\nComposition: Three genera (1 extinct), with 366 species (2 extinct). See Table A1 for overview and distributions.\n\nEuconosoma Cameron, 1918 [44]: 215.\n\nType species: Euconosoma elegans Cameron, 1918 [44]: 216 (= Conosoma pictum Bernhauer, 1903 [83]: 25).\n\nSepedophilus Gistel, 1856 [84]: 386 (= Urolitus Silvestri, 1947 [54]: 147 syn. nov.).\n\nType species: Staphylinus pubescens Paykull, 1790 [85]: 138 (= Staphylinus littoreus Linnaeus, 1758 [38]: 422).\n\n†Palaeosepedophilus Paśnik & Kubisz, 2002 [82]: 357.\n\nType species: †Palaeosepedophilus succinicus Paśnik & Kubisz, 2002 [82]: 357.\n\nFossils: It is noteworthy that the fossils of Sepedophilus in mid-Eocene Baltic amber are very diverse and abundant (Yamamoto, pers. obs.), although only one species, Sepedophilus balticus, has been formally described from this deposit [82]. Additionally, I have seen a single Sepedophilus fossil in early Middle Miocene Dominican amber deposited in the FMNH. As a newly defined subtribe Euconosomatina stat. rev., sensu nov. includes one extinct genus, †Palaeosepedophilus from Baltic amber [82], which can be placed in Euconosomatina stat. rev., sensu nov. by the general characters including the absence of the paratergites [82]. However, †Palaeosepedophilus is morphologically very distinct in lacking the rows of spines along the outer margin of protibiae and has ventro-dorsally compressed, axe-shaped terminal maxillary palpomeres [82].\n\nNotes on family-group name: The name Euconosomini had been considered incorrect original stem formation, therefore I herein adopt the tribe-level name Euconosomatini Cameron, 1918 [44] established on the genus Euconosoma Cameron, 1918 [44] (stem: Euconosomat-) [20]. The family-group name Euconosomatini (= Euconosomini) originally contained a single genus Euconosoma only [44], but I also included Sepedophilus and †Palaeosepedophilus in Euconosomatina stat. rev., sensu nov. based on general similarities including the lack of abdominal paratergites, presence of a row of comb-like protibial spines (not in †Palaeosepedophilus [82]), and densely pubescent body. The name Sepedophilini Ádám, 2001 [86] is a subjective junior synonym of this name that never came into common use (Sepedophilini was synonymized under Tachyporini by Bouchard et al. [20]).\n\nRemarks: In the present study, three genera of Tachyporini sensu nov. were grouped together to form a newly resurrected and defined subtribe Euconosomatina stat. rev., sensu nov. It can be easily recognized by the above-mentioned characters, especially the presence of the longitudinal row of close-spaced spines along the outer margin of the protibia (Figure 17B,C). Another remarkable feature in this subtribe is the absence of the abdominal paratergites (Figures 14D and 15D). Differing from most Osoriinae (except Eleusinini), the Staphylininae genus Coomania Cameron [87], or the Paederinae subtribe Procirrina (Pinophilini) have the same kind of fusion, the abdominal tergites and sternites are not fused together, i.e., ring-like, but are separated by a narrow suture along each lateral side.\n\nThe enigmatic monotypic genus Urolitus shares the same basic body plan with Sepedophilus, including the spines along outer margins of the protibiae and the absence of paratergites [54]. Other characters such as mouthparts and sternite VIII are nearly fully congruent with this genus. Therefore, Urolitus syn. nov. should be a junior synonym of Sepedophilus based on morphological similarity and the results of my phylogenetic analyses. Following this treatment, a new combination of the type species is provided: Sepedophilus nigeriensis (Silvestri, 1947) [54] comb. nov. Based on the presence of a row of macrosetae along the outer margin of the elytron [54], it may be close to the scriptus or similar undescribed species group (sensu Campbell [88]).\n\nCampbell [88] divided Sepedophilus into 12 species groups based primarily on the North American species. Known larvae of these species groups have been the focus of interesting evolutionary research on feeding habits and strategies, as the larval types are generally associated with species groups and are also relevant to predaceous and mycophagous feeding habits [17,18]. Since the presence of so many undescribed Sepedophilus species and species groups have been suggested (e.g., [89,90,91]), more new species will undoubtedly be discovered in the future.\n\n3.2.7.

This extinct species was described on the basis of a rather poorly preserved male adult, but I now have several well-preserved adult fossils of the same species for future comparative study (Yamamoto, in prep.). As discussed in Yamamoto [46], †Procileoporus generally resembles the four vatesine genera, i.e., Cilea, Cileoporus, Coproporus, and Coprotachinus. Among them, †Procileoporus is particularly similar to Cileoporus in having a slender body and elongate elytron, together with similar configurations of the abdominal tergite IX in the male [46]. For these reasons, this fossil genus is herein unambiguously assigned to Vatesini sensu nov.\n\nSo far, only a single fossil has been definitively assigned to the extant genus Coproporus, namely C. electron Yamamoto, 2016, from early Middle Miocene Dominican amber [102].\n\nRemarks: Until now, the tribe Vatesini has been comprised of only the single myrmecophilous genus Vatesus, associated with army ants, from the Neotropical region. However, my phylogenetic analyses did not show at all that it was a tribe-level group. Certainly, Vatesus was fully resolved among the genera of the Coproporus-related group of Tachyporini. Consequently, the present study greatly expands the concept of the tribe, encompassing the ten genera listed above. A close relationship between Coproporus and Vatesus has independently been suggested by larval and adult morphologies, respectively [25,27]. In light of the previous studies and current results, a newly defined Vatesini sensu nov., including the Coproporus-related taxa, is one of the key solutions to resolve the polyphyly of Tachyporini in the old sense (see further in Discussion).\n\nIt is noteworthy to mention here that there are two enigmatic monobasic tachyporine genera, i.e., Tachinoporus and Tachinoproporus, described from Malaysian Borneo. No additional specimen of either genera has been known since the original descriptions [11]. In this study, I was fortunately to be able to examine these type materials deposited in the BMNH, which had been under a long-term loan, resulting in limited available information for a long time. Consequently, there have been no photograph, line drawing, or redescription published for these taxa despite their importance in tachyporine systematics. Here, I provide informative photographs and detailed descriptions below, along with discussions of their phylogenetic affinities. However, I refrained from including the genera in my phylogenetic analyses because these specimens seem very fragile, and I was allowed only to observe them from dorsal and lateral views. Furthermore, it was either impossible to score some important morphological characters or difficult to score characters accurately. In this study, I did not detach the glued specimens from the paper cards, to avoid further damage to the specimens (e.g., erect setae, setose surface of the abdomen, repaired hindleg, and well-organized antennae). This also prevents degradation of DNA information of specimens through resolution with water. Unfortunately, some body parts, such as male genitalia, are missing or embedded in glue, preventing accurate scoring of morphological characters. Although the overall conditions of Tachinoporus and Tachinoproporus are rather poor, these specimens allow for the elucidation of tribal affinities, in addition to other information. In conclusion, they should belong to Vatesini sensu nov. based on the results of my morphological investigations (see below).\n\n3.2.8. Genus Tachinoporus Cameron, 1928\n\nTachinoporus Cameron, 1928: 447 [11] (Figures 35–39; Table A1)\n\nType species: Tachinoporus basalis Cameron, 1928 [11]: 448.\n\nDifferential diagnosis: This enigmatic genus can be distinguished from all remaining genera of Vatesini sensu nov. by the following combination of characters: Body large, slender, antennae longer than head and pronotum combined, devoid of dense and fine recumbent setae in basal three antennomeres, pronotum widest in middle, with longitudinal sulcus along midline, bearing stout setae along margins, elytron somewhat strongly elongate, with stout setae, legs long and slender, abdomen with two pairs of paratergites, and abdominal terminalia with very long macrosetae in both sexes.\n\nEmended diagnosis based on dorsal and lateral views: Body large (more than 5.5 mm long), slender, rather streamlined, moderately depressed dorsoventrally (Figures 35A,C,D and 36A,C–E); surface strongly glossy, dorsum lacking microsetae, punctation, or micro-reticulation on forebody; head with arcuate sides, lacking narrowing of neck region, dorsum with markedly developed midcranial suture, extending posteriad beyond middle of vertex (Figure 37B); antenna filiform, not flattened nor modified, moderately longer than head and pronotum combined, basal three antennomeres devoid of dense and fine recumbent setae (Figure 37A); maxillary palpomeres 3 and 4 glabrous with several setae on surface near each apex (Figure 37C); pronotum as long as wide, widest in middle, surface with inconspicuous longitudinal sulcus along midline (lsp), sides strongly arcuate, all pronotal margins furnished with row of macrosetae (Figure 37B); elytron rather strongly elongate (length/width = ca. 2.0×), dorsoventrally flattened, with several macrosetae along lateral margin (Figure 38A–C); elytral epipleuron rather deeply folded inward, visible from lateral view (Figure 38D); legs long and slender (e.g., Figures 35A,C and 36A,C); abdomen slender, with two pairs of paratergites on segment III–VII (Figure 39F, pts), furnished with distinctly long macrosetae on both dorsal and ventral sides of abdomen; tergite VIII and sternite VIII somewhat strongly elongate, each furnished with several long macrosetae, some of which extremely long: male tergite VIII (Figure 39A) with weakly developed lobes, female tergite VIII (Figure 39D) with moderately to strongly developed lobes, male sternite VIII (Figure 39B) with posterior margin deeply and narrowly emarginate, female sternite VIII (Figure 39E) with weakly to moderately developed lobes, flanking distinct median emargination; male tergite IX (Figure 39C) with each side forming pointed lobe, with several macrosetae on its apical surface; female tergite IX (Figure 39H) subtriangular, weakly transverse, uniformly well sclerotized, with several spines at each apex.\n\nRedescription based on dorsal and lateral views: Body (Figures 35A,C,D and 36A,C–E) large, narrowly elongate, moderately flattened dorsoventrally, Cileoporus-like, widest in pronotum. Dorsum strongly glossy; head and pronotum without ground setae, punctation, or grooves.\n\nHead (Figure 37B,D) hexagonal, slightly transverse, moderately produced anteriorly, widest across eyes, with gently arcuate postocular sides; frontoclypeal suture (Figure 37B) complete, well-developed, shallowly grooved, weakly V-shaped; midcranial suture (Figure 37B, mcs) distinctly developed, extending posteriad beyond middle of vertex; neck constriction or narrowing completely absent in postocular areas (Figure 37B); dorsal surface lacking microsetae, punctation, or ocular seta (Figure 37B); ventral surface without infraorbital ridge extending ventrally from posterior margin of eye. Clypeus (Figure 37B) normal, not reflexed upward, narrowly produced anteriorly. Eyes (e.g., Figure 37A,B,D) moderate in size, somewhat inconspicuous, nearly even with surface of head capsule. Antennal insertions (Figure 37A,D) partially concealed under frontal shelf-like projections, located near anterior margins of eyes. Antenna (e.g., Figure 37A) comprised of 11 antennomeres, filiform, very slender, long, clearly longer than head and pronotum combined; antennomeres 4–11 (a4–a11) slightly flattened; basal three antennomeres glossy, devoid of dense and fine recumbent setae, remaining antennomeres densely covered with whitish microsetae. Maxillary palpus (Figure 37C) four-segmented, elongate, moderate in size and length, lacking recumbent microsetae on surface; palpomere 1 (mp1) very short; mp2 long, narrowly elongate, moderately curved, gradually strongly dilated apically, with several short setae on surface near apex; mp3 very short, as long as wide, much shorter than mp2, weakly dilated apically, with several setae on surface near apex; mp4 markedly long, approximately three times as long as mp3, moderately longer than mp2, moderately narrower than mp3, sides gradually and evenly tapering from middle to pointed apex. Labial palpus (Figure 37E) three-segmented, elongate, inconspicuous, lacking ground microsetae on surface; palpomere 1 (lp1) very short, only partially visible; lp2 slightly longer; lp3 slender, much longer and clearly narrower than lp2, as long as lp1, gradually narrowing toward apex, rather pointed, with more than ten pores on surface. Mentum (Figure 37E) moderately transverse, trapezoidal, with truncate anterior margin. Labium with ligula large, developed, extending laterally.\n\nPronotum (e.g., Figure 37B,D) oval, feebly transverse, widest in middle, much larger than head; sides strongly arcuate, evenly convex; each margin with a few macrosetae, but lacking ground microsetae; anterior margin weakly concave; anterolateral angles rounded; disc with shallow and very narrow longitudinal sulcus along midline (see, arrow of lsp), but reaching neither anterior nor posterior margins of pronotum. Scutellum (Figure 38A,B) visible dorsally, sub-triangular, as long as wide, with rounded apex. Elytron (e.g., Figure 38A–C) rather strongly elongate (length/width = ca. 2.0×, male, n = 1), subparallel sided, dorsoventrally flattened, only slightly longer than pronotum, with rounded posterior margin; lateral margins not arcuate, with a row of several long macrosetae; surface even and smooth, rather densely covered with vestigial ground microsetae. Elytral epipleuron (Figure 38D) relatively deeply folded inward, but visible from lateral view. Wings (Figure 38A,B) visible, probably fully developed. Mesoventrite (Figure 38D) with surface even and smooth, without carina or keel along midline.\n\nLegs (e.g., Figures 35C, 36C, and 38E–G) long, distinctly slender, with irregularly distributed, somewhat inconspicuous spines on tibiae. Procoxae (e.g., Figure 38E) large, expanded; protibiae (e.g., Figure 38E) rod-like, with markedly long apical tibial spurs, longest spur much longer than protarsomere 1 (pt1); protarsi (e.g., Figure 38E) 5-segmented, narrow in both sexes, moderately shorter than protibiae, basal four tarsomeres each small and short, together moderately longer than pt5. Mesotibiae (e.g., Figure 38D,F) with developed spurs at each apex, but much shorter than mesotarsomere 1 (mst1); mesotarsi (e.g., Figures 36C–E and 38F,G) 5-segmented, very long, as long as mesotibiae, mst1 (Figure 38F) much longer than mst2, as long as mst5. Metacoxae transverse, moderate in size; metacoxal ventral lamella projecting posteriorly in mesial inner areas (Figure 38D); metatibiae with only weakly developed, very short spurs at apex; metatarsi (e.g., Figures 36C,E and 38F) 5-segmented, markedly long, slightly longer than metatibiae, basal metatarsomere much shorter than following three segments combined (see Campbell [103]). Claws (e.g., Figure 38E) simple, lacking conspicuous basal teeth. Empodial setae very short, inconspicuous, not extending distally beyond level of basal fourth of tarsal claw"
