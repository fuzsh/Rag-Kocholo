Sept. 29 (or 27), 1846 Notes left by Evaline Tagatz say that Johann Ludwig Schubert was born Sept. 29, 1846 in Grabova, Province of Posen, West Preusen, Germany. Adaline Tagatz wrote that his date of birth was Sept. 27, 1846. Another note left by Evaline Tagatz said that Johann's son Otto's Bible said he was born in Gramsdorf, Posen. Another source said he was born at or near Kolmar, Posen Province, Prussia [SOURCE: Jammie Dennin].

The 1920 Federal Census said that Alvina B.'s parents' [which would be Ludwig and his wife] were born in Schnida, Germany (see census information under Alwina Bertha Schubert's entry below).

Parents:

Father: Adolph Martin Schubert; mother unknown Family notes say that his father was Martin Schubert and his mother was unknown. His mother did not come to America with the family. Another source said that his mother died when he was five years old. [SOURCE: Jammie Dennin]

Genealogy notes left by Adaline Tagatz (Johann's granddaughter) say: "Johann Ludwig Schubert always told that his mother died after the birth of two or three girls and Johann... Johann Ludwig said his mother died of cholera in Germany."

Family notes say that John Ludwig's stepmother was Anna Rosine Otto.

Marriage:

Married to Maria Julianna Wichner on Feb. 22 or 23, 1870 Maria Julianna Schubert's obituary said that she was married to Mr. John Ludwig Schubert by Rev. Alwart on Feb. 23, 1870. A transcription online of the Marquette County Pre-1907 Marriages on rootsweb.com said that Johann Ludwig Schubert married Julia Wichner on Feb. 22, 1870 (Vol. 1, Pg. 120, Certificate #770). The two sources are one day apart.

The 1870 Census said that Lewis married his wife Julia in Feb. 1870 (see census entry below).

Adaline Tagatz wrote: "Johann Ludwig Schubert made his home at the home of Jakob Martin Wichner and Mary (Mittelstaedt) Wichner, the parents of his future wife, and worked at different places until he had the indebtedness paid off of the funds advanced for his emigration to U.S.A."

d. May 28, 1943 Julius Heinrich Schubert was born July 29, 1872 at 4 a.m. on a Monday in Dakota township (Waushara Co., WI). He died of heart failure on May 28, 1943 in Waushara Co., WI. [SOURCES: His birth information was on a Bible leaflet referenced by Russell Williams; other information from family notes.]

Notes left by Evaline Tagatz said: "Julius Henry (Heinrich) Schubert, born July 29, 1872, died 1943 (not married). (His gravestone says 1873 which is incorrect. [This is Evaline's note.]).. [He] worked on farms and invented useful articles and machinery. He could play a violin (fiddle). After he heard a tune he could play it. He had very little schooling. They lived so far from the schoolhouse - in fall and spring he had to stay home and help his father on the farm, and in the winter it was difficult to walk so far in the cold over the snow banks."

Henry appears as age 7 on the 1880 Federal Census as living with his parents (see census details).

The 1930 Federal Census in Richford, Waushara Co., WI, said Henry J. Schubert (age 47, single) was a hired man living with Emil R. Denna [or Dennu] (age 45, farmer) and Emil's wife Martha E. (age 46) and son Ervin E. (age 7).

He moved back to Pipe, purchased and operated a grocery store until his retirement in 1947.

Otto was survived by his son Harold Schubert of Pipe, daughter Mrs. Wilmer Reichmann of Milwaukee, daughter Mrs. Waldo Nelson of Chicago, sister Mrs. Emma Tagatz of Stevens Point and eight grand-children. The obit said his wife died in 1949, and five brothers and a sister died before he did. Services were held at Fond du Lac. Otto was buried in Rienzi Cemetery. [SOURCE: Obituary published in the Fond du Lac Commonwealth Reporter in Fond du Lac, WI on Aug. 28, 1968]

A second obit (source unknown - handwritten date Aug. 28, 1968) said that Otto August Schubert (age 84 of Pipe) died at St. Agnes Hospital "today." He was born Sept. 3, 1884 in Richmond, WI. His parents were Mr. and Mrs. Ludwig Schubert. He married Laura Wegenke on Aug. 23, 1914. This obit repeats the job history listed above. It lists the same survivors. Funeral services were held at Uecker-Witt Funeral Home with Pastor Karl Gurgel officiating.

Russell Williams wrote that Otto S. Schubert was baptized at the Westfield Lutheran Church on Oct. 2, 1883. Sponsors were G. Schubert, Julius Rux and Emilie Mittelstedt.

Otto was shown in the 1900 and 1905 census records with his parents (see census details).

Otto was living with his sister Alvina and her husband in Packwaukee, Marquette Co., WI, in 1910 (see census details under Alvina's entry below).

Family notes say that Otto married Laura Amanda Wegenke on Aug. 23, 1914 (Laura was born Apr. 6, 1886 and died in 1949). They had at least three children.

Alwine Berrta Schubert

aka Alvina Bertha or Alvena

b. Feb. 20, 1885;

d. Mar. 12, 1935 Family notes say she was born Feb. 20, 1885 in Richford, Waushara Co., WI, on Freitag, halb 8 Morgen (Friday morning). Russell Williams wrote that Alvina/Alvine Bertha Schubert was baptized at the Westfield Lutheran Church on Mar. 27, 1885. Sponsors were Maria Kroll, Julius Rux and Friedrich Brizke.

Alvena was shown in the 1900 and 1905 census with her parents (see census entry).

Alwine Bertha Schubert married Emil Hermann Strohschein (or Stroeschein) on Aug. 21, 1906 in Westfield, Marquette Co., WI [Vol. 3, pg. 231]. Emil was born Mar. 15, 1882, and died Mar. 12, 1935 in the Town of Coloma, WI. Family notes say she had no children. Russell Williams wrote that her husband was the son of Johan and Justine (Roehlke) Strohashein [as is common in many records, surname spellings are inconsistent].

Fran Sprain wrote about the Stroschein family in her book Places and Faces in Marquette County, Wis. - Vol. II. It said that Emil was age 3 when he came to America with his 5-year-old sister Augusta, their mother Justina and Justina's mother (surname Pehlke). Emil's father, John, checked out America first in 1882. John was a carpenter and cobbler. They settled east of Fenner Lake in Marquette County. Justina was a seamstress. John and Justina had more children in Wisconsin - Robert and William. Emil was a streetcar conductor in Milwaukee, a farmer in Coloma and a storekeeper in Packwaukee. Fran's book includes more details about how the Stroschein family lived.

The 1910 Federal Census in Packwaukee, Marquette Co., WI, showed Alvina (age 25, married 3 years, no children, born in Wis., parents born in Germany) living with:

husband Emmil H. Strohschein (hard to read age but could be 28, retail grocery merchant, immigrated in 1885, born in Germany)

brother Otto A. Shubert [as spelled] (age 26, single, brother-in-law, barber, born in Wis., parents born in Germany).

The 1920 Federal Census in Coloma, Waushara Co., WI, showed Alvina B. (age 34, born in Wis., parents born in Schnida, Germany) living with:

husband Emil H. Stroschein (age 37, born in West Prussia, farmer, immigration date is given but is difficult to read)

The 1930 Federal Census in Coloma, Waushara Co., WI, showed Alvina (age 45, born in Wis., parents born in Germany, married at age 21) living with:

husband Emil Stroeschein (age 48, married at age 24, born in Germany, farmer).

Immigration:

Aug. 5, 1864 with his parents, although it appears he may have first arrived in 1863 Ludwig Schubert arrived in New York on Aug. 5, 1864 on the ship Europa, which left from Bremen. He was listed as age 17 on the ship manifest. Other family members immigrating with Ludwig were:

his father, Martin Schubert (age 56, a farrier [a farrier is someone who is a blacksmith or veterinarian specializing in horses])

Anna-Rosine Schubert (age 38)

Gustave Schubert (age 9)

Adolphe Schubert (age 5)

Wilhelm Schubert (age 2).

[SOURCE: Germans to America, Vol. 15] This may not be his first trip to America. A letter from Adaline Tagatz to her sister Evaline Tagatz said: "I looked through the books on Otto's shelf and also found some information in Otto's Bible... In another book was the following: 'Ludvig Schubert aus Wischin Holland Deutschland nach America in 1863.' I gather this is the year Ludvig Schubert emigrated to America on the S.S. via Holland-Germany."

Could Ludwig have came to America in 1863 to check things out and then returned for his family the next year? The 1900 & 1930 Census said he immigrated in 1863 and the 1920 Census said 1864 (see census entries below). The last sentence in the following note suggests this may be the case:

Evaline Tagatz wrote: "Chas. Dahlke's wife was Grandpa Schubert's aunt. [For misc. Dahlke records, go to the Dahlke web page. My Great-Aunt Adaline Tagatz wrote: "Grandfather Schubert and Gust Dahlke were first cousins, which makes Walter mother's second cousin...."]

The 1905 Wisconsin Census in Markesan, Green Lake County, WI, shows an August Dahlke. Could this be the Chas. Dahlke mentioned above?:

August Dahlke (head of household, age 60, born in Posen, parents born in Posen, farmer)

Emma Dahlke (wife, age 44, born in Posen, parents born in Posen)

Willie Dahlke (son, age 20, born in Wis., single, laborer)

Emil Dahlke (son, age 18, single, born in Wis., laborer)

Frederick Dahlke (son, age 15, born in Wis., laborer)

Albert Dahlke (son, age 12, born in Wis.)

Laura Dahlke (daughter, age 9, born in Wis.)

My grandmother also wrote that Chris Mueller's mother was Grandpa's aunt. Ludwig Schubert lived with Mrs. Koats (Krueger); Ludwig Kruger was Grandpa Schubert's cousin. His father, Grandpa's cousin brought Grandpa to America. Grandpa's parents came to America later."

She also wrote that he was thought to be age 16 when he immigrated. She wrote: "Grandpa John Ludwig Schubert and Gustav Schubert came to America on money which their uncle, Mr. Krueger, sent them. Grandpa paid back the money for his trip to Mr. Krueger. Kruger had children: Mrs. Koats, Minnie Kruger and Ernest who married Emma Fierke." Gustav Schubert was Ludwig's half brother.

A note found in my Great-aunt Adaline Tagatz's records also say that Johann and his half brother Gustave Schubert had their trip to America financed by an uncle. In the margin it says "Uncle Rudolph Krueger."

Ludwig Schubert applied for naturalization in May 1970, but this record is lost. [SOURCE: June 5, 2003, letter to Jammie Denin from an archivist in the Polk Library, University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh] Kruger Family:

It is interesting to note that Ludwig Schubert and his family were listed next to a Kruger family on the same ship manifest. This may (or may not) be the Kruger family that helped the Schuberts come to America. A note left by my Great-aunt Adaline Tagatz suggests that Rudolph Krueger was the uncle who financed Johann's trip to America. The Kruger family on the same ship as Ludwig Schubert may be related in some way to Rudolph. These individuals were:

Ludwig Kruger (age 41, farmer)

Wilhelmine-Ernestine Kruger (age 23)

Wilhelmine-Ernestine Kruger (age 17) [yes, the same name was listed twice next to each other with two different ages]

Friedrich-Auguste Kruger (age 14)

Ernest Krueger (age 10)

Emilie Kruger (age 9)

August Krueger (age 3)

Bertha Kruger (age .09 infant).

The 1870 Federal Census in Neshkoro, Marquette Co., WI, has Ludwig Kreger (age 54, farmer, born in Prussia, real estate value $800, personal property value given but hard to read) living with:

Minnie (age 29, born in Prussia)

Augusta (age 8, born in Prussia)

Bertha (age 7, born in Prussia)

Lewis (age 3, born in Wis.)

Minnie (age 23, born in Prussia)

August (age 20, farm laborer, born in Prussia)

Ernest (age 18, farm laborer, born in Prussia)

Amel (age given but hard to read, could be 15; farm laborer, born in Prussia).

This could be the same Kruger family that traveled with the Schuberts to America, especially given the two females named Minnie.
