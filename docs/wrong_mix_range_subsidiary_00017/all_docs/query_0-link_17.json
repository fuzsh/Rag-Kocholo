        "text": "Time period Key developments at Microsoft 1975–1985 Microsoft is founded and starts out creating its first software products, such as the MS-DOS operating system. 1985–1994 Microsoft moves to Redmond, IPOs, launches Microsoft Office and its first GUI. This would lead it to dominate much of the software market and put it in conflict with Apple Inc. Until 1995, Microsoft had failed to take advantage of the rising popularity of the Internet. 1995–2000 Microsoft releases Windows 95 and Windows 98, both which become extremely popular. It expands its presence on the Internet, and it develops an overwhelming share of the desktop operating system and Internet browser market. It also goes through an antitrust lawsuit. 2000–2006 Microsoft releases Windows ME (considered to be a botched release), which is then patched up by the popular Windows XP, which retains an overwhelming share of the OS market for a long time. Microsoft also releases the Xbox, which would eventually compete with the Playstation as one of the most popular gaming devices. 2007–2011 Microsoft releases Windows Vista (which is considered to be a botched release), and then Windows 7 to fix up the botch-up. While it still retains a significant share in the desktop operating system market, it does not anticipate the smartphone revolution. Microsoft also starts losing its share of the browser market to Firefox and Google Chrome, and MSN starts losing share of the search engine market to Google. Apple, Microsoft's old nemesis, would also introduce the iPhone, which would gradually eat into the overall Microsoft share of computing devices. Bill Gates continues to have diminishing involvement over the company. 2011–2014 The desktop operating system market is collapsing, as is the market share of Windows-based programming languages among developers.[1] Some question Microsoft's future under Steve Balmer. Windows 8 is released, but it is considered to be a botched release. 2014–present Microsoft appoints Satya Nadella as CEO, and its stock starts recovering again. Microsoft releases Windows 10, whose features help it compete with Google and Facebook to establish the strongest hold over people's digital lives.\n\nYear Month and date Event type Details 1975 April 4 Company Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft.[2] 1978 November 1 International The company's first international office was founded on November 1, 1978, in Japan, entitled \"ASCII Microsoft\" (now called \"Microsoft Japan\"). 1980 August Product Microsoft signs a contract with IBM to develop an operating system for IBM's first personal computer.

Microsoft Corp., an Antitrust trial, begins against Microsoft, with the US Department of Justice suing Microsoft for illegally thwarting competition in order to protect and extend its software (for reasons including bundling Internet Explorer with Microsoft Windows and requiring personal computer manufacturers to agree to adopt a uniform \"boot-up\" or \"first screen\" sequence specified by Microsoft).[20] 1999 July 22 Products Microsoft releases MSN Messenger, an IM client.[21] 2000 January 13 Team Bill Gates hands over his CEO position to Steve Ballmer.[22] 2000 September 14 Product Microsoft releases Windows ME.[13] It has improved support for digital media. 2001 May Acquisitions Microsoft acquires Ensemble Studios.[23] 2001 October 25 Products Microsoft releases Windows XP.[13] 2001 November 15 Products Microsoft launches the first Xbox.[13] 2002 February 13 Products Microsoft launches the .NET initiative, which creates an entirely new API for Windows programming, and includes a new programming language C#.[13] 2002 November 1 Legal The Department of Justice reaches an agreement with Microsoft to settle the United States v.
