The FloraCap® 2.0 was redesigned to give you a more consistent flow rate, even distribution, a slightly increased air flow and improved stabilization. Place the FloraCap® on top of your 4, 6 or 8 in rockwool cubes, maximizing your space in the vegetative cycle. Fill the cap with water and nutrients by hand or automate with FloraClips. The 4 in cap features 13 flower designed louvers and the 6 and 8 in cap feature 26 flower designed louvers that delivers water, nutrients and air to the medium while blocking light. The FloraCap® strategically covers the top of the media, allowing the root zones to dry at a more consistent rate and delivering the necessary oxygen your plants need to thrive. Algae disappears, healthy roots fill the medium and blossoms multiply.\n\nMother Earth® Coco substrate contains the highest-quality mix of coco pith and coco fiber. RHP certified for quality, Mother Earth® Coco is pre-buffered and pH adjusted to neutral at 6.3–6.8. Mother Earth® Coco will promote strong root growth, populate microbial activity, discourage disease and insect outbreak and release nutrients evenly. For an optimal hydroponic media, combine Mother Earth® Coco with Mother Earth® Hydroton® or Perlite for increased production. This is uncharged inert media.\n\nSunshine® Mix #4 with Mycorrhizae\n\nSunshine Mix #4 with Mycorrhizae is an ideal choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening. Formulated with Canadian sphagnum peat moss for increased moisture retention, optimum air exchange and high cation exchange capacity (CEC), plus coarse perlite for amplified root zone aeration. The lime, gypsum and proprietary wetting agent combine to make Sunshine Mix #4 with Mycorrhizae the professional quality mix that meets the needs of serious-minded growers.\n\nSuper Sprouter® Perfect Plug® growing media replacement plugs are great for seed starting and cuttings. Perfect Plug® growing media plugs use a custom peat moss blend, with Mother Earth® BioChar added, exclusively developed for Super Sprouter® to allow a great mixture of moisture and aeration. Perfect Plug® media plugs have a pre-drilled dibble to foster the optimum environment for stem to media contact. If limiting your plastic waste is important to you, use these refill plugs to reload your Perfect Plug Tray® starter tray. Easy to use, just insert cutting or seeds into your plugs and watch them grow.\n\nHDI Root Riot™ Tray\n\nThe HDI Root Riot™ Tray contains plant starter cubes for cuttings and seeds for soil or hydroponics.

New plants transfer easily into soil or any other media.\n\nPremier Tech Pro-Mix® BX Mycorrhizae™\n\nPro-Mix® BX Mycorrhizae™ is a general purpose peat-based growing medium containing a beneficial mycorrhizal inoculum (glomus intraradices). These microscopic fungi attach to and colonize the root systems working in symbiosis with plants. Contains: Canadian sphagnum peat moss (75–85%/volume), horticultural-grade perlite, horticultural-grade vermiculite, dolomitic and calcitic limestone (pH adjuster), wetting agent and mycorrhizae – endomycorrhizal fungi (glomus intraradices).\n\nGrodan® Stonewool Grow-Chunks™\n\nLight, airy and versatile. Grow-Chunks™ are about 3/4 in square each and can be used in pots, around blocks or alone. They are easily combined with other media, such as layering with coco fiber or clay pellets. They can also be combined with soil for added aeration and increased moisture-holding properties. Great for hydro systems or container gardening.\n\nGro-Blocks are similar to a plant container. Need a 3 in pot? Then choose a 3 in Gro-Block. Small plants can be fully grown in our larger Gro-Blocks. Holes are perfect size for any 1.5 in starter plug. Come in packs labeled with instructions. Big Mama is Grodan’s largest block ever produced! Big enough to grow a large plant for its entire life.
