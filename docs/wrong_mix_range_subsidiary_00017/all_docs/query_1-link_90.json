This will email our warehouse that the package is returning, so they may ship a replacement order without needing to issue an RMA.\n\nFreight/LTL\n\nAll claims must be made with the carrier. At the time of delivery, make sure there is no damage or any shortages. If there are, it must be noted in the Bill of Lading at the time of delivery. If the Bill of Lading is signed as complete / undamaged and at a later point damage or shortages are found, you will be unable to receive compensation.\n\nIF THE ORDER ARRIVES AND IS NOT INTACT OR DAMAGED, PLEASE FOLLOW THE BELOW STEPS:Take a photo of the pallets for documentation as well as claim supporting documentation. Without photos, a carrier claim will not be honored. While the driver is still present do not sign the shipping BOL until you have thoroughly inspected the contents of the pallet for missing or damaged items. Any damage or missing items MUST BE NOTED on the Shipping BOL or delivery receipt. Without this documentation, a claim will not be approved. In addition to signing the shipping BOL, please also PRINT LEGIBLY the last name of the person receiving the order.ALSO NOTE – carriers will not approve claims that have the following verbiage “subject to inspection” or similar.\n\nUSPS\n\nShould your shipment be lost or items were damaged in shipment and the shipment was sent insured, in order to file an insurance claim a signed and dated letter is required stating the following:\n\nDate the package was mailed.\n\nInvoice or order number.\n\nDescription of product.\n\nIf loss (after 21 days domestic or 45 days international or 60 days to Italy), state parcel never received; if damage, state description of damage and if repairable (most likely not).\n\nSignature and date.\n\nMissing/Wrong Items\n\nWe require notice about any missing/wrong item(s) within 24 hours after a package has been received.\n\nProduct Availability / Back Orders\n\nAll non-special order items are assumed to be in stock unless otherwise indicated.\n\nSometimes an order comes in before another, which wipes out the remaining inventory. So while an item may be in stock when you place your order, by the time shipping gets to filling your order the warehouse may run out.\n\nShould an ordered item become unavailable you will be notified and it will be back ordered to ship upon arrival or you may be refunded or get an in store credit for orders order than 30 days.\n\nAs soon as we become aware of the unavailability of an item we will update the item/customer.\n\nOrder shipment will not be delayed due to a back order or discontinued item. All items in stock will ship and the customer will be notified about any back ordered or discontinued item(s). We will not delay/hold shipment of an order due to a back order or discontinued item. We usually will not know of a back order until the rest of the order ships.\n\nReturns\n\nShipping errors/damage will be replaced free of charge if we are contacted within 24 hours of shipment receipt.\n\nReturnable item returns accepted within 30 days from the date of receipt.\n\nAll returns to stock must be received in new, unopened, saleable condition.\n\nShipping paid on orders that shipped is not refundable under any circumstance.\n\nThere is a 20% manufacturer imposed restock charge for returnable items.\n\nYou will be credited on receipt, inspection and acceptance of the return.\n\nSpecial order items, items on special, international orders, used trimmers/tumblers, live items, seeds and discontinued items are not returnable/refundable.\n\nPlease email us at store (at) horticulturesource (dot) com for a Returned Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number and the return address. We handle all returns via email to document it fully. Please write the return authorization number on the return label and include our order number inside.\n\nRestocking\n\nThere is a manufacturer imposed 20% restocking fee for all non warranty related returns. Such as if the item ordered is undamaged and the customer returns for refund. This includes products returned for credit, returned refused or unclaimed or returned due to insufficient address. Return shipping is the customers responsibility.\n\n– Vendor HGC only considers like kind exchange returns for credit.\n\n– Vendor HRG accepts unopened items within 7 days of purchase.\n\n– Vendor BFG does not accept returns unless mis-shipped, damaged or defective.\n\nCancellations, Refused Shipments & Delivery Failures\n\nIf you cancel your in-stock or available on backorder items order BEFORE it has been shipped or order items labeled as unavailable in your area, you will be assessed a 5% cancellation fee before credit is issued. This covers non-refundable card processing fees and administrative costs.\n\nAn order may not be canceled if it is being prepared for shipment (Preparing status) or has been shipped without incurring restocking fees and/or shipping charges. Our vendors charge restocking to put pulled products back on shelves. We cannot cancel shipped orders.\n\nVendor HGC has a 5 business day picking time.

We will complete your Returned Merchandise Authorization form for any and all defective products (except for special and international orders). Usually return shipments will be covered if the following are met:\n\nReturns without authorization will not be refunded.\n\nProduct returned without RMA approval or not sold by us will be refused and shipping charges and administrative fees applied.\n\nIf product is returned for Warranty Repair and is out of Warranty or is in Warranty but found to be working, shipping charges will be applied. Repairs are $65 / hour labor, plus parts when not in warranty.\n\nProduct should be returned in original packaging or equivalent. Damage due to poor packaging may void the warranty and will be the customers’ responsibility.\n\nWarranty will be void if factory serial # has been tampered with or removed.\n\nShipped products should never be returned without prior approval.\n\nReturn products for credit are subject to a minimum 20% restocking fee. If the item is not in like new condition the restocking fee is 40% (or may not be restockable). Restocking is manufacturer imposed.\n\nAlways write your RMA number on the Shipping call tag and retain the receipt. Do not mark directly on the box.\n\nAll warranties are void outside of the U.S.A. and Canada.\n\nReturns may not be accepted later than 30 days from the RMA issue date.\n\nLamp Returns\n\nThe code from the side of the lamp will be required to prove it was the one we sent and has a valid warranty. Eye Lighting has specified that glass shards inside of Hortilux lamps are not a defect and lamps will not be considered defective. They indicate the inside glass has no effect on the function of the lamp.\n\nMeters and Probe Returns\n\nThe probe(s) sent back with or without the meter must match what we sent and not be expired or it will be returned at the customer’s expense. We keep careful track of the date codes on all probes.\n\nThe following Manufacturers require all returns go directly through them:\n\nHorticultureSource.com cannot process returns for the above manufacturers (unless it is a mis-shipment or new return to stock — less restocking).\n\nMost manufacturers on this list will require the dated invoice which was emailed upon your order checkout confirmation.\n\nWe advise our customers to contact these manufacturers directly. The vendors are equipped to help troubleshoot their products. We do not take returns for products from the manufacturers listed above.\n\nTitan Controls and Ideal-Air Support Process\n\nEnd user calls support line directly:\n\nTITAN CONTROLS: 888-808-4826, 5:00 am to 4:30 pm PST\n\nIDEAL-AIR: 877-9-IDEAL-1 (877-943-3251), 7:00 am to 5:00 pm PST\n\nEnd user receives a case number and directions from support personnel.\n\nOnly if directed to do so by support personnel, the end user will bring the case number to the store where the item was originally purchased.\n\nRMA Process Flow Examples\n\nWhen the process is followed:\n\nThe RMA is inspected by the receiving department.\n\nThe RMA authorization / pack slip is present and filled out accurately & completely.\n\nAll items shipped match the packing slip in quantity and description.\n\nThe RMA goes directly to the repair department and is in the first in / first out of queue.\n\nThis process ensures that RMAs that have been submitted correctly will be handled in the most expeditious manner. A properly prepared RMA will no longer be delayed by an RMA that has been improperly prepared.\n\nWhen the process is not followed:\n\nThe RMA is inspected by the Receiving Department.\n\nEither the RMA authorization / pack slip is missing or it does not match the items shipped, and/or is not filled out accurately or completely.\n\nThe RMA shipment is placed in the quarantine area. The discrepancies are noted on the receiving checklist and given to the Customer Service Department.\n\nCustomer Service emails the customer and resolves the discrepancy.\n\nEither the paperwork is created, corrected or a new RMA is made.\n\nReceiving matches the corrected paperwork to the return and forwards it to the Repair Department.\n\nWhen this situation is encountered it can delay the processing of the return. This delay could be anywhere from several hours to several days, or even weeks depending on the discrepancy (e.g. could not contact the customer, or there was no identification on the package, etc.)\n\nReturn Merchandise Authorization Program Terms & Conditions\n\nIf you have a product that needs to be returned to us, contact us for an RMA# (Return Merchandise Authorization number). Every product that is returned needs an RMA# in advance of return. Shortly after you contact us you will receive a written RMA confirmation via e-mail. This confirmation is provided for your records and a copy may be used as a packing slip. Credit will not be given if a product is returned without prior RMA authorization. Each item returned needs to be included in the RMA issued to you. Please do not send back ANY items not included on your original RMA. You will need to email us for a new RMA if you have additional items that you want to send back. When contacting us for an RMA be prepared to tell us the original invoice number that a product was purchased on (except warranty defective ballasts & lamps). Additionally, please advise us the reason for the return. Please clearly write the RMA # on the shipping label, not directly on the box.\n\nShipments back to our vendors — We have prepaid freight labels that have the address on them. Terms of use: These labels are only to be used if you have a defective product that you purchased from us, and it is currently under warranty. In addition, it must be a product that qualifies for return to us. In all other situations, you are responsible for the freight and shipment of a product back to us. Many products that we distribute need to be sent directly back to the manufacturer. See the included list of “The following Manufacturers require all RMAs go directly through them” above.\n\nWhenever possible ship products back to us in protective over wrap boxes. If you send something to us, please do not affix the freight sticker directly on the original product box. If an over wrap box is not available, please put a couple short strips of clear tape on the box and attach the shipping label to the tape. In this way the original product box will not be destroyed when we try to remove the shipping label. All products that are damaged in transit because of deficient packaging may not be eligible for warranty credit or repair.\n\nIf you have a product that needs repair or replacement, we will turn the product around promptly. Please test all items and verify they are still in warranty before you return them. If we receive a unit and after thorough testing it is found to be fully functional, we will have to pass on a charge to you of $65.00 to cover the inbound and outbound freight. If you return a light system that is found to be out of warranty, Sunlight Supply will gladly fix it, but we will have to charge you inbound & outbound freight, parts and labor ($65.00 per hour).\n\nIf you are returning a product for credit (i.e. miss-ordered item), you will be responsible for paying the freight back to us. In addition, we will need to pass on a 20% manufacturer imposed restocking fee. The credit will be reduced by 20%. This restocking fee will be used to cover the original outbound freight (if applicable), administrative costs, labor, replacement packing, etc. The appropriate credit will be applied to your card (if valid), PayPal account, or we will send a check and in any case you will be emailed a receipt.\n\nWe are not able to offer credits or replacements on items that are outside of the manufacturers’ warranty. If you return one of the products that we sell (non-lighting products) and it is found to be out of warranty, we will contact you for resolution. When you return distributed items that are found to be defective and under warranty we will credit you.\n\nPlease allow up to 30 days of us receiving your returned goods and refund request for any credit to be issued.\n\nWarranty Information: Warranty on all items will be the manufacturer’s standard warranty. Please consult the manufacturer’s packaging or literature for specifics. Most manufacturers’ will require a receipt and many will also need the original packaging.\n\nIf you are having difficulties with one of our other sold products, (i.e. missing parts, defective product, etc.) you can contact the manufacturer directly or email us. If you contact us, we will work with the manufacturer on your behalf when possible to get the problem resolved. In most cases, it will not make sense to bring the product all the way back to us. We will have the manufacturer send you a missing part, replacement product, return authorization, etc.\n\nRefunds\n\n– When issuing a refund we will credit your original form of payment when possible. When not possible and orders older than 30 days will receive an in store credit. If you prefer a refund instead you will be refunded via PayPal less 5% for card fees and administrative costs.\n\n– Items ordered labeled as unavailable for the shipping address will be assessed a 5% fee before credit is issued, e.g. OR only items ordered outside of OR or Western States Only items ordered to the east or vise-versa.\n\n– In stock items or items available on backorder which are requested canceled before they ship will be assessed a 5% cancellation fee. Restocking applies to any already pulled or packaged shipments.\n\n– Refunds which come back unclaimed or are returned will be considered void and forfeit. In store credit will be assessed inactivity fees in 12 months.\n\n– Special orders, Shipping, Route Protection, Payment Processing Fee and Subscriptions are non-refundable.\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nConditions of Use\n\nWelcome to HorticultureSource.com (also HorticulturalSource.com).
