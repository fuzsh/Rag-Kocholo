Accredited, post-secondary educational institutions meeting the provisions described in IRS regulation 26 CFR 1.501(c)(3)-1 may apply to develop a partnership with (a) foreign institution(s) of higher education in specified fields and themes within the humanities, arts, and social sciences. Proposed projects must be eligible in terms of country(ies)/regions and themes as described in the section entitled ``Guidelines'' below. Participating institutions exchange faculty and administrators for a combination of teaching, lecturing, faculty and curriculum development, collaborative research, and outreach, for periods ranging from one week (for planning visits) to an academic year. The FY 97 program will also support the establishment and maintenance of internet communication facilities at foreign partner institutions. The program awards up to $120,000 for a three-year period to defray the cost of travel and per diem with an allowance for educational materials and some aspects of project administration. At this writing, prospects for Congressional appropriations in support of USIA's exchange programs are very uncertain and may result in reduced funding. Subject to the availability of funding, awards will be made under each of the following thematic categories: Democracy and Human [[Page 51747]] Rights, International Trade Policy and Economic Security, and the Environment and Sustainable Development. Overall grant making authority for this program is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, Public Law 87- 256, as amended, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act. The purpose of the Act is ``to enable the Government of the United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries * * *; to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other nations * * * and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic and peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of the world.'' The funding authority for the program cited above is provided through the Fulbright-Hays Act. Projects must conform with Agency requirements and guidelines outlined in the Solicitation Package. USIA projects and programs are subject to the availability of funds. Announcement Title and Number: All communications with USIA concerning this announcement should refer to the College and University Affiliations Program and reference number E/ASU-97-01. Deadline for Proposals: All copies must be received at the U.S. Information Agency by 5 p.m. Washington, DC time on Friday, January 17, 1997. Faxed documents will not be accepted, nor will documents postmarked on January 17, 1997, but received on a later date. It is the responsibility of each applicant to ensure compliance with the deadline. Approximate program dates: Grants should begin on or about September 1, 1997.

Please specify ``College and University Affiliations Program Officer'' on all inquires and correspondence. Prospective applicants should read the complete Federal Register announcement before addressing inquiries to the College and University Affiliations Program staff or submitting their proposals. Once the RFP deadline has passed, the staff may not discuss this competition in any way with applicants until the Bureau proposal review process has been completed. Submissions: Applicants must follow all instructions given in the Solicitation Package. The original and 10 copies of the complete application should be sent to: U.S. Information Agency, Ref.: E/ASU-97- 01, Office of Grants Management, E/XE, Room 336, 301 4th St., SW., Washington, DC 20547. Applicants must also submit the ``Executive Summary,'' ``Proposal Narrative,'' and budget sections of the proposal on a 3.5'' diskette, formatted for DOS. This material must be provided in ASCII text (DOS) format with a maximum line length of 65 characters. USIA will transmit these files electronically to U.S. Information Service (USIS) posts overseas for their review, with the goal of reducing the time it takes to get posts' comments for the Agency's grants review process. Diversity Guidelines Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, projects must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity'' should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including, but not limited to ethnicity, race, gender, religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principal both in program administration and in program content. Please refer to the review criteria under the `Support for Diversity' section for specific suggestions on incorporating diversity into the total proposal. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Overview Objectives The CUAP's short-term goal is to provide partial funding of linkages between U.S. and foreign institutions of higher education featuring exchanges of faculty and administrators for the purpose of teaching, lecturing, faculty and curriculum development, collaborative research, administrative reform and modernization, and outreach. The program's long-term goals are to: (1) Advance mutual understanding between the U.S. and other countries or regions by supporting linkages which provide true reciprocity and significant mutual benefit. (2) Diversify and expand international educational exchanges by: Supporting linkages involving academic institutions in various locations throughout the U.S. and abroad; Targeting academic disciplines and countries/regions which are not otherwise significantly represented in privately funded exchanges; Increasing the participation of two-year/community colleges, small four-year schools, and schools with significant (over 25%) minority student enrollment; and Complementing the individual lectureships, research and graduate study fellowships, and training programs available under Fulbright and other Agency auspices. (3) Foster post-secondary institutional academic development by supporting linkages which promise to develop appropriate expertise and advance scholarship and teaching. (4) Further U.S. foreign policy objectives by supporting linkages which correspond to the Agency's geographic and thematic programming priorities. (5) Encourage long-term impact on all partner institutions by supporting linkages which promise sustainability beyond the three-year grant term. (6) Expand U.S. government/private sector cooperation by leveraging significant cost sharing from both the U.S. and foreign partner(s). Guidelines The ideal and most competitive proposal is reciprocal, with mutual goals and benefits for all partner institutions. While the goals and benefits should be mutual, they do not need to be identical for each partner institution or precisely balanced among partner institutions. One-way, technical assistance projects are not acceptable. [[Page 51748]] The ideal and most competitive proposal includes a series of year- round, faculty and administrator exchange visits involving a well- reasoned combination of teaching, lecturing, faculty and curriculum development, collaborative research, and outreach. Projects involving administrative reform or modernization, such as distance learning, are also invited. These activities must address and support stated project goals, develop expertise, advance scholarship and teaching, and promote reliable, long-term communication between partner campuses. They may vary in emphasis within the project. For example, collaborative research may play a lesser role than curriculum development. Library support and development should be included if deemed critical to the success and sustainability of the project. The proposal should demonstrate that an internet communication link between partners has been planned or already established; grant funds may be requested to initiate or enhance that link. Exchange visits should be for a minimum of one month with the exception of planning visits, which may be for a shorter period. The non-planning visits in a competitive proposal range from one month to an academic year in length, preferably including one, quarter or semester-long visit each year from each of the U.S. and the foreign partner(s). Proposals featuring multiple visits of one quarter or semester in length will be more competitive. Visits by the U.S. and foreign project coordinators as well as other key exchanges should be identified and justified in the proposal narrative. An ideal project builds upon previous contacts and interaction between the proposed partners, such as individual faculty or student exchanges, and has the support and the knowledge and encouragement of the relevant USIS post and/or Fulbright commission, to help ensure a solid foundation for the linkage. Acceptable proposals must either establish new institutional affiliations or innovate existing partnerships and must not merely extend projects previously funded by the College and University Affiliations Program (formerly the ``University Affiliations Program''), other USIA or U.S. government linkage programs. Proposals of feasibility studies to plan affiliations will not be considered. The ideal and most competitive proposal provides significant institutional support and cost sharing from both the U.S. and foreign institution(s) and promises sustainability beyond the grant term. The U.S. institution(s) should collaborate with the foreign partner(s) in planning and preparation. When planning the project, U.S. and foreign institutions are strongly encouraged to consult with the Cultural Affairs Officer (CAO) or Public Affairs Officer (PAO) at the appropriate U.S. Information Service (USIS) office at the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate and with the Fulbright Commission, if one exists, in the relevant country. U.S. Partner and Participant Eligibility In the U.S., participation in the program is open to accredited two- and four-year colleges and universities, including graduate schools. Applications from consortia of U.S. colleges and universities are eligible. Secondary U.S. partners may include relevant non- governmental organizations, non-profit service or professional organizations. The lead U.S. institution in the consortium is responsible for submitting the application and each application from a consortium must document the lead school's stated authority to represent the consortium. Participants representing the U.S. institution who are traveling under USIA grant funds must be faculty or staff from the participating institution(s) and must be U.S. citizens. Foreign Partner and Participant Eligibility Overseas, participation is open to recognized, degree-granting institutions of post-secondary education, which may include internationally recognized and established independent research institutes. Secondary foreign partners may include relevant governmental and non-governmental organizations, non-profit service or professional organizations. Participants representing the foreign institutions must be citizens, nationals, or permanent residents of the country of the foreign partner and be qualified to hold a valid passport and U.S. J-1 visa. Ineligibility A proposal will be deemed technically ineligible if: (1) It does not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the Solicitation Package; (2) It is not received by the deadline; (3) The length of the proposed project is less than three years; (4) It is not submitted by the U.S. partner; (5) One of the partner institutions is ineligible; (6) The foreign geographic location is ineligible; (7) The project involves a partnership with more than one country with the exception of trilateral APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) projects under Theme II: International Trade Policy & Economic Security; (8) The theme or academic discipline is ineligible; (9) The amount requested of USIA exceeds $120,000 for the three- year project. Eligible Themes, Academic Disciplines, and Countries The FY 97 competition is limited to the following three themes which reflect USIA's foreign policy priorities: (I) Democracy and Human Rights, (II) International Trade Policy and Economic Security, (III) The Environment and Sustainable Development. Eligible academic disciplines and countries are listed under each theme. Inclusion of U.S./Area, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies U.S./Area, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies are included as eligible academic disciplines in order to allow for the development of a broader cultural understanding and context in which to pursue a linkage project within one of the stated themes. U.S./Area, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies may be incorporated into a given project but only in conjunction with one or more of the eligible academic disciplines listed under a given theme. U.S./Area, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies includes U.S. and partner country history, literature, and social sciences. Bilateral Projects Except for APEC and Canada/Mexico Environment and Sustainable Development Projects The program invites proposals for bilateral projects only, involving the U.S. and one foreign country, with the exception of proposals submitted for trilateral projects under Theme II: International Trade Policy and Economic Security regarding APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) member economies and under Theme III: The Environment and Sustainable Development with regard to Mexico and Canada. Theme I: Democracy and Human Rights Projects are solicited which promote democracy building and human rights and reinforce U.S. interests overseas. U.S. interests are most secure in a world where accountable governments and rule of law strengthen stability and project both political rights and free market economies. Within this context, Affiliation projects under Theme I should help [[Page 51749]] build democratic institutions, promote civic education, and increase expertise in the rule of law and the administration of justice through faculty and curriculum development, teaching and lecturing, and outreach. It is anticipated that college and university faculty, administrators, and students involved in cross-cultural democracy- building partnerships will generate ideas and projects which will contribute to modernization and reform in the university community, public policy arena, NGO's, and the private sector. Sub Theme: Civics Education USIA has a particular interest in reviewing proposals whose goal is to nurture the culture of democracy by focusing on the role of civics education in a democratic society. A linkage project incorporating a focus on civics education might include topics and issues such as the philosophy of democratic institutions; the philosophy and goals of public and private education; the role of citizen behavior and social responsibility in a democracy; the role of volunteerism, public interest groups, and major players such as public and private schools, government, religious institutions, public libraries, private organizations, and parents. A civics education linkage might also address political practices such as the balance of individual rights and group rights; reconciliation and compromise within the democratic process; and the philosophy of majority rule and minority rights. Projects in civic education may combine one or more of the academic disciplines listed below in order to pursue an affiliation whose objectives are those of the overall College and University Affiliations Program, namely teaching, lecturing, faculty development, curriculum development (e.g. for teacher training), collaborative research, and outreach (e.g. community outreach). Eligible Academic Disciplines Law (including Conflict Resolution, Intellectual Property Rights) Political Science/Government/Public Policy/Public Administration Journalism/Communications Higher Education/Higher Education Administration U.S./Area, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies (in combination with one or more of the academic disciplines above) Eligible Countries Africa: Botswana, Cote D'Ivoire, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda; American Republics: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela; East Asia and Pacific: Cambodia, China (due to limited funding, China projects are limited to Law and U.S./Area Ethnic, and Cultural Studies in combination with Law), Vietnam, Mongolia; East Europe, Central Europe, and the New Independent States: Belarus (partnerships are encouraged with private, independent universities there), Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia (outside Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nizhniy Novgorod), Slovakia, Ukraine; North Africa, Near East, and South Asia: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Gaza/West Bank; Western Europe: Turkey. Theme II: International Trade Policy and Economic Security Projects are solicited which promote economic reform and the development of market economies, trade, and investment overseas in support of U.S. interests in a global economy through faculty and curriculum development, teaching and lecturing, and outreach. Affiliation projects under Theme II are anticipated to establish or expand mutually beneficial academic programs in business and economics and promote international investment by strengthening institutional links to the private sector. Similarly, campuses should engage in international business affiliations which make their training, personnel, and research available to government and contribute to the formulation of more open and responsible trade policy. Eligible Academic Disciplines Economics Business/Business Administration/Business Management Commercial Law (including Intellectual Property Rights) U. S. Studies/Area, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies (in combination with one or more of the academic fields above) Eligible Countries Africa: Botswana, Cote D'Ivoire, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda; American Republics: Venezuela, Uruguay; (Note: Chile and Mexico are eligible under the East Asia and Pacific trilateral APEC category (below)) East Asia and Pacific: The following Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member economies are eligible within a trilateral affiliation between the U.S. and two APEC member economies: Australia, Canada, China, Chile, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam; Western Europe: (Note: Canada is eligible under the East Asia and Pacific Trilateral APEC category above) Theme III: The Environment and Sustainable Development Projects are solicited which address environmental issues having an impact on U.S. and global interests. Academic exchanges which support responsible management of the Earth's natural resources is a key USIA priority. Given this priority, the vision for Affiliation projects under Theme III is to establish or expand environmental studies programs through faculty and curriculum development, teaching and lecturing, and outreach. Faculty, administrators, and students involved in international environmental studies ventures should make their training and personnel resources, as well as results of their collaborative research, available to government, NGOs, and business. These kinds of environmental linkage activities contribute to sound policy-making and long-term, global environmental sustainability. Eligible Academic Disciplines Environmental Sciences/Natural Resource Sciences Environmental Policy and Resource Management Sustainable Development U.S. Studies/Area, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies (in combination with one or more of the academic fields above) Eligible Countries Africa: South Africa, Uganda; American Republics: Chile, Mexico (only as a trilateral with Canada); Western Europe: Canada (only as a trilateral with Mexico). Visa Requirements Programs must comply with J-1 exchange visitor visa regulations. Please refer to program specific guidelines in the Solicitation Package (POGI) for further details. Travel The assistance award recipient must arrange all travel through their own travel agent. Proposed Budget No funding award will exceed a total of $120,000 for the three-year grant term. Support for direct administrative costs associated with grant activities will not exceed 15% of the total grant [[Page 51750]] amount. All indirect costs are unallowable. Grants awarded to eligible organizations with less than four years of experience in conducting international exchange programs will be limited to $60,000. Applicants must submit a comprehensive, line-item budget for the entire project. There must be a summary budget as well as a breakdown, by year, reflecting both the administrative budget and the program budget. Please refer to the Solicitation Package (POGI) for complete budget format instructions. Review Process USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines stated herein and in the Solicitation Package. Eligible proposals will be forwarded to outside academicians and Agency officers for advisory review. Proposals will also be reviewed by the appropriate regional office, i.e., the USIA Office of African Affairs (AF), Office of American Republics Affairs (AR), Office of East Asian and Pacific Affairs (EA), Office of East European and NIS Affairs (EEN), Office of West European and Canadian Affairs (WEU) and the Office of North African, Near Eastern, and South Asian Affairs (NEA) and relevant USIA posts overseas, where appropriate. Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of the General Counsel or by other Agency elements. Funding decisions are at the discretion of the USIA Associate Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for assistance awards (grants or cooperative agreements) resides with the USIA contracts officer. Review Criteria Technically eligible applications will be competitively reviewed according to the criteria stated below. These criteria are not rank- ordered and all carry equal weight in proposal evaluation: Academic Review Criteria Proposals are reviewed by independent academic peer panels, with geographic and disciplinary expertise, which make comments and recommendations to the Agency based on the following criteria: (1) Reasonable and feasible project objectives which are clearly related to the project plan and activities. (2) Appropriate and feasible project plans and a detailed schedule which must include a well-reasoned combination of useful and appropriate teaching, lecturing, faculty development, curriculum development, collaborative research, and outreach. The various activities should be clearly related to project objectives, but not need be equally emphasized within the proposal. (3) Inclusion of exchange visits of a length which will further the project goals and activities. Except for planning visits, stays of one month or more should be balanced with visits of an academic quarter, semester, or year. (4) Promise of the development of expertise and the advancement of scholarship and teaching in the eligible academic disciplines or themes. (5) Quality of exchange participants' academic credentials, skills, and experience relative to the goals and activities of the project plan (e.g., language skills). (6) Institutional resources adequate and appropriate to achieve the project's goals. Relevant factors are: The match between partners; the financial and political stability of the institutions; and availability of a critical mass of faculty willing and able to participate. (7) Evidence of strong institutional commitment by all participating institutions, including demonstration of relevant and successful prior interactions between institutions and an indication of collaborative proposal planning. (8) Evidence of a strong commitment to internationalization by participating institutions (i.e., developing other international projects and/or building upon past international activities). (9) An effective evaluation plan which defines and articulates a list of anticipated outcomes clearly related to the project goals and activities and procedures for on-going monitoring and mid-term corrective action. Agency Review Criteria (1) Clear indication that the proposal seeks to establish a truly reciprocal and mutually beneficial institutional affiliation overseas or to innovate an existing affiliation. The benefits do not have to be the same for each partner or precisely balanced, but must be essentially mutual. (2) Positive assessment of program need, feasibility, and potential impact by the relevant USIA post overseas. (3) Academic quality, reflected in the academic review panel's comments and recommendations. (4) Institutional and geographic diversity of the U.S. and overseas institutions (i.e., racial, ethnic, and gender composition of student enrollments; small underrepresented institutions, two-year/community colleges, and institutions in underrepresented geographic locations). (5) The promise of sustainability and long-term impact which should be reflected in a plan for continued, non-U.S. government support and follow-on activities. (6) Cost-effectiveness (i.e., competitive cost sharing, sufficient number of participant exchanges relative to the project goals and plan). (7) Institutional track record and ability. The Agency will consider the past performance of prior recipients and the demonstrated potential of new applicants.
