The problem for information systems depart¬ ments and others is how to isolate the perfor¬ mance of a particular team member. Both stellar and lackluster work may be hidden in team set¬ tings, according to a study by The Hay Group, a management consulting firm in Philadelphia. As a result, workers are increasingly dis¬ satisfied, and team- based productivity is on the wane. This is es¬ pecially true at compa¬ nies where teams have been in place for two years or longer.

IN DEPTH, page 121 News Apple chief fuels OS confusion Letter to Mom Dear Mom, Remember how we were talking a few weeks ago, and I suggested you get a PC with an America Online connec¬ tion so you could cruise the horticulture forums? Bad idea. Mom. Let me tell you a story. A few days after we talked, Lori called me at work. (She sends her love, by the way) . Seems she couldn’t save any of her Word documents. So I find she’s got something called the Concept macro virus. It’s like when 1 used to get the flu. So I get this little program off the Internet and spend about two hours getting rid of the virus. Thought 1 was in the clear. Then the next day, the PC can’t see the CD-ROM drive. (They call it read-only memory, but it’s really a disk. Don’t ask me why). So I try to send an E-mail to the support line, and the modem isn’t working. (A modem turns digits into sounds and then back to digits. Don’t ask) . Finally I figure out I’ve got another 'nvns. So I go to CompUSA and buy an anti¬ virus program (it costs $60 and makes your PC do what it’s supposed to do al¬ ready) and go home and install it. Turns out. I’ve got a lot of vi¬ ruses, Mom. We’re talking digital petri dish here. Since some of them are boot-sector viruses — you don’t start a computer. Mom, you boot it — the software can’t fix them all. So I have to reinstall Windows 95. Then I have to rebuild my desktop. That kitchen remodeling is simple by comparison. Then my screen is showing only 16 colors because it turns out I’ve got two display drivers installed. That is what they call plug- and-play. That took me a few days to unravel. The funny thing is. Mom, a lot of people in the computer indus¬ try are disappointed that only 35% of American homes have PCs. They want to get that to 60%. E you ask me, they should be happy they’ve gotten this far. Forget about the PC, Mom. I wouldn’t want to inflict the pain on you. Not to mention Dad. Paul Gillin, Editor Internet: paul_gillin@cw. com The 5th Wave by Rich Tennant \" We puliecL tvom sevaal ouL^. ae services to buM our c/5 aixM&hire-Utroec^t, Andersen Consult-ingf, tne 1111 peacekeeping, fiorces...\" By Lisa Picarille Apple Computer, Inc. was put on the defensive last week when in¬ formal comments by CEO Gilbert F. Amelio were interpreted to mean that Apple will abandon the Mac OS in 1998 in favor of a com¬ pletely new operating system. Apple officials claimed that Amelio’s comments were taken out of context and that the CEO was simply talking generally about the future of operating sys¬ tems. “He was simply making general statements about what an operat¬ ing system in 1998 should have,” said Russell Brady, a spokesman for the Cupertino, CalE.-based computer maker. “We are not abandoning the Mac OS and re¬ main committed to the PowerPC platform.” Brady said Apple plans to un¬ veil its operating systems strategy early next year. In the meantime, faithful Mac¬ intosh users seeking any good news to cling to in the wake of de¬ clining market share have been left to draw their own conclusions. “You hear a lot of things about Apple, [such as] they are going to buy the BEOS to replace the Mac OS. Then you hear that’s not true. Then there are ru¬ mors that, going for¬ ward, a new Mac OS will not be back¬ ward-compatible. Then someone else says that’s not true,” said an IS manager at a West Coast aerospace company, who requested anonymity. “It’s hard to figure out what is true, and Apple isn’t saying much about future strategy. So you just cling to what you hear and pray that it will all work out,” the IS manager said. Copland troubles Industry watchers said Apple’s trouble getting its message out is more than a lack of communica¬ tion. After three years of develop¬ ment and delays, Apple finally pulled the plug on the multipro¬ cessing, multithreading, micro¬ kernel architecture of Copland, which was pegged as the next-generation Macintosh operat¬ ing system. Instead, the com¬ pany announced at Macworld Expo in August that Copland — Mac OS 8 — wouldn’t be released as planned and in¬ stead Copland fea¬ tures would be delivered in incre¬ mental releases every six months. “Apple’s problem is that it hasn’t been able to deliver on its promises,” said Tom Rhinelander, an analyst at Forrester Research, Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. “They keep promising the world and missing. Apple has set its sights on creating a more ro¬ bust operating system, but that is now more than a year away. In the meantime, market share contin¬ ues to slip, and unit shipments for the last quarter are down. Users are not going to wait forever, and right now [Apple] can’t afford to alienate users,” he said. Taking a bite Third-quarterfigures from Dataquestin San Jose, Calif., show Apple’s share of the overall PC market is 5.4%, down 27.5% from the 8.7% market share Apple had in the same period last year. Oracle, Netscape in deal Oracle Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp. have signed a deal to bundle Net¬ scape’s Navigator browser with Pentium-based network comput¬ ers that Oracle plans to ship in the first half of next year. Oracle said its own PowerBrowser software will be embedded in the compa¬ ny’s Interoffice groupware suite. AOL adopts flat pricing America Online, Inc, last week announced a flat rate of $19.95 per month for unlimited access to its service. The Dulles, Va., company has had high customer turnover partly because its basic rate of $9.95 per month for five hours of access prompted complaints from heavy users. AT&T wins contract United HealthCare Corp. has entered a long-term outsourcing contract with AT&T Corp. that analysts said could be worth as much as $800 million. AT&T will deploy advanced call-center tech¬ nologies and build and operate the Minnetonka, Minn.-based health care provider’s communi¬ cations platform, including voice mail, voice response and more than 100 private branch exchange systems. Boost for BackOffice Microsoft Corp. has bought its way in to the online analytical pro¬ cessing market by acquiring multidimensional database tech¬ nology from Panorama Soft¬ ware Systems in Israel. Micro¬ soft plans to add the Panorama technology to its BackOffice suite of server software. Lotus broadcasts point Lotus Development Corp. and PointCast, Inc. have teamed up to offer intranet broadcasting services to corporate users. Called Lotus Domino.Broadcast for PointCast, the product com¬ bines Lotus’ Domino server, Domino.Action Web site creation software and PointCast’s I-Server. The offering is due early next year. Pricing wasn’t announced. Tandem does Web Tandem Computers, Inc. last week unveiled a new line of Win¬ dows NT-based servers and a new direction toward Internet transac¬ tion processing.

A little-known program allows information systems workers to earn college credit for technical classes that cost much less than col¬ lege courses. The program can save millions of dollars in college tuition reimburse¬ ment costs and gives workers new skills in a short time. The catch is that the training must be certified under the American Council on Education’s (ACE) Program on Non-Collegiate Sponsored Instruc¬ tion to earn college credits. The Washington-based ACE last week added 22 computer training classes from Productivity Point In¬ ternational in Hinsdale, Ill., to its growing list of qualified courses. Other computer training compa¬ nies that offer ACE-certified cours¬ es are ExecuTrain Corp., Learning Tree International and Command- Train, Inc. “In the past two years, we’ve seen a flurry of activity in the computer area,” said Jo Ann Robinson, deputy director of the ACE program. In addition, several dozen compa¬ nies from all industries have won ACE certification for in-house courses that cover topics such as communication skills and strategic planning. The certification “saves the stu¬ dent a bundle of time and us a bun¬ dle of money,” said Bob Elkins, manager of training performance improvement at Union Pacific Corp. in Omaha. “We’re looking at be¬ tween $3,000 and $3,600 per person in savings per semester that we would have spent on tuition reim¬ bursement.” Meanwhile, employees earn an average of two college credits for a short course in LANs or Unix that would take a semester to com¬ plete in a university classroom. “The IS folks [working toward a technical degree] see this as a godsend because it enables them to skip past electives and focus on the programming stuff,” Elkins said. IS workers who complete non-IS training in, say, financial planning, also earn college credits. At Dana University, the training arm of $7 billion Dana Corp., an automotive parts manufacturer in Toledo, Ohio, an IS employee can earn three college credits for com¬ pleting a 3y2-day finance course. As the company migrates to Mi¬ crosoft Corp.’s Windows 95 and Of¬ fice software, end users also will earn one college credit for every two days of software training, which Dana has outsourced to Pro¬ ductivity Point.

News Wal-Mart (www.wal-mart.com) doesn’t use Merchant Server Wal-Mart asks for a return Conspicuously absent from Microsoft’s Mer¬ chant Server announce¬ ment last week was Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Earlier this year, Microsoft and Wal-Mart executives held a flashy press conference to announce they would work to¬ gether to develop technology for online commerce. Since then, the two firms have gone their separate ways. Why? Because Microsoft wasn’t moving fast enough, said Phil Martz, director of Wal-Mart Online. Wal-Mart wanted to put up its World Wide Web site faster than Microsoft could get its Mer¬ chant Server ready. The Wal- Mart site went live this sum¬ mer. Martz said Wal-Mart will evaluate Merchant Server for future purchase. But there is a major obstacle: Merchant Server lacks tools to import data and applications from a pre-existing site, and Wal-Mart doesn’t want to lose the work it has already done. Wal-Mart’s goal was to en¬ sure that user-interface stan¬ dards were developed so visi¬ tors in different stores would have similar means of brows¬ ing and arranging payment. Martz said the vendors and users writing online sales soft¬ ware seem to be moving in that direction. — Mitch Wagner Microsoft WOOS webmasters with online mall software By Mitch Wagner SAN JOSE, CALIF. Just in time for holiday shopping, Microsoft Corp. last week an¬ nounced the immediate availabil¬ ity of its Merchant Server soft¬ ware package for setting up Internet storefronts. The product lets companies build online stores with displays of merchandise, including photos and multimedia clips. It automates payment process¬ ing and shipping arrangements, and provides links to back-office databases and systems. “The product area that Mer¬ chant Server is involved in today is very small, but we believe it will see explosive growth,” said Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates. Microsoft expects the number of consumers on the In¬ ternet to grow from 15 million to¬ day to 48 million by 2000. Small-company support Merchant Server has won early support fi'om users; there are about 40 companies hosting sites with the software. Most of the companies are small, but some of the larger participating retailers include Tower Records and the boutique chain Crabtree & Evelyn Canada. Virgin Entertainment Group in Los Angeles is evaluating the product as a possible foundation for an online Virgin Superstore, which is expected to sell CD- ROMs, videos and other media next year. Virgin webmaster Brian Regan called Merchant Server “a phe¬ nomenal piece of software. . . . It’s far superior to anything out there.” Regan praised the data¬ base connectivity, the user inter¬ face for designing sites and the components for automatically computing sales tax. He also expressed enthusiasm for components that let web¬ masters set up special promotions — for instance, buy-one-get-one- free offers — and tailor them to certain visitors, based on profiles filled out at registration. But Microsoft faces stiff compe¬ tition. Netscape Communications Corp. has its own Merchant Sys¬ tem. IBM earlier this fall an¬ nounced a line of merchant serv¬ ers and an online mall. World Avenue, which is due to open this year. Oracle Corp. last month an¬ nounced Apollo, its merchant server. Apollo is due next year. Plenty of smaller companies also offer merchant systems. They include Open Market, Inc., ICat Corp., BroadVision, Inc. and Evergreen Internet, Inc. And many companies are custom¬ building their online stores in- house or with consultants. Price points At its press conference, Microsoft touted the low price of Merchant Server as a virtue. But David Strom, an indepen¬ dent analyst in Port Washington, N.Y., questioned that claim. He said the $18,000 cost of the software license isn’t cheap and doesn’t include a Windows NT software license or server hard¬ ware. “It’s going to run you $20 grand. That’s a lot of money. This is hardly Filene’s Basement,” Strom said. The ICat server fi'om Seattle- based ICat offers similar function¬ ality but costs about $1,500. ©Netscape, Microsoft shift at¬ tention to back-end Web software. See page 67. Vendors announce more competition for Visual Basic By Sharon Gaudin IBM and Oracle Corp. are taking aim at the lucrative and growing Visual Basic market with Basic By Mitch Wagner and Kim S. Nash SAN J OSE, CALIF. Microsoft Corp. last week an¬ nounced a set of tools designed to allow IS managers and business managers to work together on building sophisticated commerce sites on the World Wide Web. The company unveiled Internet Studio, a graphical tool that devel¬ opers can use to integrate text for¬ matted in Hypertext Markup limguage (HTML), database con¬ nections and programs written in Microsoft’s Visual Basic, Perl and other common programming lan¬ guages. programming tools of their own. In separate announcements last week, IBM added the Basic lan¬ guage to its Visual Age family, and Oracle enhanced its Oracle Power Microsoft also unveiled Front- Page 97, a tool that will allow busi¬ ness managers and consumers to graphically integrate HTML- formatted text, graphics and third-party programming ele¬ ments. Terra Cotta The firm also displayed a proto¬ type of a more sophisticated end- user tool. Terra Cotta, which was designed to allow nonprogram¬ mers to build Web sites with so¬ phisticated application back ends. JTie software would let users drag and drop a set of tiles togeth¬ er. Each tile represents a separate application that Terra Cotta would Objects development tool. But Microsoft Corp. isn’t stand¬ ing around waiting for someone to take away its market share. The company has made several an¬ then integrate to work together. For instance, one tile might repre¬ sent a database query tool. The tiles would function as wizards, with step-by-step, fill-in-the-blank dialog boxes that would let end users create parameters and vari¬ ables for the underlying pro¬ grams. The Microsoft development tools were designed to be tightly integrated with users’ existing business tools. Frontpage 97 is part of Micro¬ soft’s Office 97 suite and has a common user interface to other Office applications. Internet Stu¬ dio shares a similar look and feel to Visual Basic. nouncements that position its up¬ coming Visual Basic 5.0 toward the Internet. “Oh, people definitely want a piece of that market,” said David Kelly, an analyst at Hurwitz Group, Inc. in New¬ ton, Mass. “IBM and Oracle see that Mi¬ crosoft is fulfilling an important need in corporations, and they’re trying to capture some of that market,” Kelly said. IBM is trying to lure Visual Ba¬ sic developers by giving them the ability to write Basic applications for the server, as well as for multi¬ ple platforms. Visual Basic is limited to the Windows platform. I>ate to the party? But the efforts of IBM and Oracle may be too little, too late, said Bill Fisher, president of Summit Soft¬ ware Co., a Syracuse, N.Y.-based development company that uses Visual Basic. “Microsoft has already built the industry-standard Basic tool. The technology in Visual 5.0 is just heads and shoulders above what IBM can create by itself or what Oracle can create by licensing a third party,” Fisher said. Fisher said Visual Basic 5.0 also will let developers write server applications. And Fisher said he doesn’t care about platforms other than Windows. Jean-Pierre Cabanie, computer support manager at Philips Mi¬ crowave Limeil, a division of the French Research Laboratory in France, disagreed. “On server platforms. Visual Age for Basic gives us an option to move our database server to a more powerful platform,” said Cabanie, who uses IBM’s new software to access information on his database server. Visual Age for Basic supports OS/2, Windows NT and IBM AK 6000 servers. It supports OS/2, Windows 95 and Windows NT on the client side.

News Teleport taekles WAN bottleneck Lower costs spur move to more telecommuting By Bob Wallace Local carrier Teleport Communi¬ cations Group last week launched a service that will let information systems managers in 55 cities link dispersed campus Fast Ethernet LANs. Teleport’s lOOM bit/sec. Fast Ethernet LAN Inter¬ connection Service can help exasperated users break the bottle¬ neck they encounter when they try to link high-speed campus LANs by using slower wide-area network links. While IS managers often run campus LANs at lOOM bit/sec. or faster, telephone companies typi¬ cally offer T1 WAN links that run at 1.54M bit/sec. or T3 links that run at 45M bit/sec. That creates the bottleneck. Robert Amiral is one of many users to encounter this fast-grow¬ ing problem. “We’re looking to connect two locations that are only two and a half miles away, but they’re in By Kim Girard Tom Rowan’s smile grows wider as the frame-relay price war esca¬ lates. Rowan, network operations manager at Blood Systems, Inc., one of the nation’s largest blood banks, is looking to save big as he gears up to ink a two-year voice and data contract. “We know the prices have gone one way, and that’s down,” Rowan said. “I’m shopping. No question about it.” Rowan is considering rehiring LDDS World¬ Com, Inc., the carrier he now pays $195 per month per port. That price includes a volume discount for 56K bit/ sec. frame-relay service at 43 sites. But he is also check¬ ing out AT&T Corp. and Sprint Corp. Both com¬ panies in the past week reduced their prices for frame relay, a wide-area packet-switching tech¬ nology used predomi¬ nantly for data traffic. MCI Communications Corp. also recently cut usage-based prices. AT&T lowered prices downtown San Francisco, and the city wouldn’t let us dig and install our own fiber,” said Amiral, net¬ work operations manager at law firm Morrison & Foerster. “That put us in a big jam.” Amiral said he is excited about Teleport’s Fast Ethernet LAN In¬ terconnection Service because the carrier already has the fiber in place. Tele¬ port also provides the routers needed to con¬ nect the sites and around-the- clock monitoring of the entire package. “ [Teleport] essentially be¬ comes an extension of the end users’ corporate MIS staff, re¬ sponsible for maintenance and management of the WAN,” said Liza Henderson, a broadband net¬ working consultant at Tele- Choice, Inc. in Verona, N.J. With Teleport’s new service, users won’t have to pay for a full¬ time private line. It is priced based on usage, which means users save on WAN charges. “Users may only need 35M to on its InterSpan Frame Relay ser¬ vice by an aggressive 7% while hiking its private-line rates slight¬ ly. Sprint’s price cuts range from 5% to 20%, depending upon a cus¬ tomer’s network configuration. Analysts have predicted prices would come down as frame relay’s popularity grows and larger carri¬ ers spar for data customers. “I do think the price will contin¬ ue to go down,” said Scott Mey¬ ers, network operations manager 40M bits on the lOOM-bit line and shouldn’t have to pay for the full bandwidth,” said Dev Ittycheria, a data services product manager at Teleport. The company will price the service on a customer-by- customer basis. Cost variables include the num¬ ber of ports used on the router and the number of connections between sites. Teleport can link sites using point-to-point links or in a mesh configuration. Teleport said it expects to offer the service over its metropolitan fiber networks but may need to use twisted-pair wire to reach sites in outlying areas. The Fast Ethernet LAN Inter¬ connection Service takes an aver¬ age of 22 business days to set up, but Teleport can shorten that in¬ terval to meet users’ needs, Itty¬ cheria said. The service is available in ma¬ jor cities, including San Francis¬ co, Dallas, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Pitts¬ burgh, St. Louis, San Diego and Indianapolis. at Cargill, Inc. in Minneapolis. “[Frame-relay] use has exploded in the industry [as] the reliability has improved.” The differences in pricing among vendors have narrowed since last October, when the Fed¬ eral Communications Commis¬ sion began requiring carriers to list their rates. Nonetheless, it remains a difficult task to deter¬ mine which carrier’s rates are the lowest, said Tom Jenkins, broad¬ band consultant at Tele- Choice, Inc., a consul¬ tancy in Verona, N.J. “Ifs next to impossi¬ ble to tell who’s lowest” because some carriers charge widely differing rates for variables such as ports, permanent vir¬ tual circuits (PVC) and usage, he said. AT&T s price cuts will apply to most users who aren’t locked in to a vol¬ ume discount or term contract but are commit¬ ted to a contract that re¬ flects tariff changes. Sprint’s new rates affect its Burst Express Zero committed information rate (CIR) service and Burst Express Plus CIR service. By Mindy Blodgett PHOENIX Reducing real estate costs is a pri¬ mary driver behind the growing number of telecommuting proj¬ ects around the country. But less tangible benefits, such as employee retention, also figure in the movement to send workers home. “We are in a severe growth mode right now, and we are really feeling the pressure on our facili¬ ties,” said Barbara Reeves, man¬ ager of engineering and scientific programs at Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. in Seattle, who at¬ tended last week’s Telecommut¬ ing ’96 conference here. Space and beyond ‘Trying to cut down on space costs is one of the main reasons we are interested in telecommut¬ ing,” Reeves said. But tracking the true costs vs. the benefits can be difficult, in¬ dustry observers told attendees. “You just can’t put a dollar value on a lot of the benefits of tele¬ commuting,” said Gil Gordon, an analyst and president of Gil Gor¬ don Associates, Inc. in Monmouth Junction, N.J. “Employees are starting to see telecommuting policies as a benefit, and com¬ panies offering it will be more competitive.” Bob Moore, manager of office services at Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston, told attendees that the costs of a telecommuting rollout at his company came to about $13,000 per user during the first year, which included new computers and training. But in the second year — after eliminating third-party outsourc¬ ing of help desk support and one¬ time start-up costs — per-user spending was cut to about $4,000. Reeves said it was space cost savings that persuaded managers to sanction a telecommuting proj¬ ect with about 60 workers. But keeping employees is another prime driver. ‘We have high attrition and training costs because we are in a competitive field,” Reeves said. “If we can retain more employees, that is a benefit both for the com¬ pany and the workers.” Tips for telecommuting ■ Form a telecommuting team that includes technical experts, upper managers and human resources staff, and assign a telework coordinator ■ Contact other companies to learn from their experiences ■ Train participants and supervisors ■ Monitor the program through surveys before and after a pilot Measuring productivity gains, another claim by telecommuting advocates, is difficult, according to users and industry observers. Aegon Insurance Group’s Ad¬ vanced Financial Services Divi¬ sion in Largo, Fla., is pleased with the success of a 2-year-old tele¬ commuting project, said Kim McGonegle, a telecommuting co¬ ordinator. But “one of our goals is to quantify productivity,” she said.

News Bringing order to ordering process By Thomas Hoffman This week, NECX Direct joins a growing number of Internet-based computer prod¬ ucts distributors with a World Wide Web- based service designed to put information technology purchasing decisions back in the hands of information systems manag¬ ers. NECX Direct, a division of Peabody, Mass.-based NECX, is introducing the En¬ terprise Purchasing Network (EPN) through its Web site (www.necx.com). The service — slated to go live early next month — allows IT purchasing managers with user IDs and passwords to set up a credit line, set spend¬ ing limits and decide who in their organiza¬ tions can place orders for Mi¬ crosoft Corp. software or oth¬ er goods. The service and others like it are a boon for IS managers, who have been be¬ deviled by runaway distributed computing costs and had difficulty in forcing users to adhere to company hardware and software standards. But it isn’t clear whether services such as EPN will stop wildcat technology pur¬ chases by rogue users. Staten Island University Hospital in New York, for example, plans to use a Notes-based electronic IT ordering service fi'om Compucom Systems in Dallas for those very rea¬ sons, said Pat¬ rick Carney, vice president and chief informa¬ tion officer at the hospital. “One of the cons is that it puts IS in the order-placement business, so we will probably let our purchasing department han¬ dle that,” Carney said. He plans to start us¬ ing the Compucom system in the first quar¬ ter of next year. The upside is that the service will streamline order processing and allow the hospital to keep electronic records of its orders, Carney said. Money talks Brian Marley, general manager of direct channels at NECX, points to a Fortune 10 customer who, prior to using his company’s service, spent $36 million last year to order products — money added to the cost of the items received. Marley said volume dis¬ counts will initially be negotiated off-line with an NECX Direct account manager. The idea of cost savings has sparked the interest of J. Benjamin Moore, manager of corporate information at North Carolina Electric Membership Corp., a Raleigh, N.C., electricity wholesaler. Moore said he is considering a Web-based service fi'om Stream International to save money and control what sometimes is an influx of de¬ livered products. Users “are always complaining about what hardware we let them order,” Moore said. “It would be nice to be able to stage or¬ ders, because I have a problem storing 100 desktops at one time.\" Companies find hurdles to ’net-related ^ customer service.

Regional Bell operating com¬ panies (RBOC) have recently re¬ leased a spate of studies and statements that contend that es¬ calating Internet use is bringing the telephone network close to gridlock. That means more busy signals or dead lines for callers. “I don't buy it,” said Eric Mills, network operator at Fox Sports Direct in Irving, Texas, a compa¬ ny that encrypts satellite signals for sports networks. “I think [the RBOCs] are looking for govern¬ ment subsidies so they can upgrade their own [telephone] systems.” On the flip side The other side of the argument is that RBOCs deserve that extra cash, said Matthew Cutler, presi¬ dent of the Webmasters Guild. “People don’t pay for what they use,” he said. “[Internet providers] fund those who stay online forever. I think we will see some price changes within 12 to 24 months.” Mills said news of Internet problems hasn’t stopped his plan to provide dedicated access to half of the 100 employees in his office. He said he is confident that online rates will remain low, de¬ spite talk that Internet service providers, if charged more by the RBOCs, will pass increases along to business customers. The RBOCs have asked the Federal Communications Com¬ mission to make Internet provid¬ ers pay more than the average $30-per-month rate for a tele¬ phone line, arguing that Internet users tax the network by staying online five times longer than telephone users. “Everyone is entitled to fair and reasonable profit,” said Paul Maszczak, corporate director of information technology at CR Bard, Inc., a medical equipment maker in Murray Hill, N.J. If In¬ ternet providers raise prices, “it will be just be a temporary fix anyway,” Maszczak said. “As the capacity catches up, the prices will go back down.” Mitchell Porche, MIS manag¬ er at Jack White & Co. in San Diego, said he has heard little about the problem. He said he is more concerned about keeping Swamped A Pacific Telesis Group study of some of ils switches found: • The average Internet connection is 20.8 minutes long, compared with a 3.8- minute average telephone call • 10% of Internet calls are six hours or longer • The peak hour for phone systems is 10 p.m., due to increased Internet use the network secure when 30 of the company’s 300 employees are on the World Wide Web. “The question is, are the phone companies crying wolf?” Porche said. “It’s a tough call.” But he said the telephone com¬ panies are at fault for taking on more traffic than their network can handle without investing in new switches. Although IS is affected by In¬ ternet problems, the problems are beyond their control, said Bob Metcalfe, vice president of technology at International Data Group, the parent company of Computerworld. “If s a big problem, like social¬ ized medicine,” he said. But In¬ ternet providers are “in a dream world when it comes to econom¬ ics and should no longer be sub¬ sidized,” he said, meaning there shouldn’t be $19.95-per-month unlimited access rates for users.

Data access shortcut Caught in the middleware To simplify Web access to legacy transaction systems, three vendors have developed pieces of a new tool kit: Vendor I 1 Pieces IBM CICS and MQSeries clients, CICS and MQSeries servers, CICS Gateway for java Sun java development software PlanetWorks Interspace software simplifies the development of Web-enabled middleware applications Kit links applets to middleware apps By Tim Ouellette An agreement made last week may give users who run World Wide Web browsers access to transaction data found in IBM’s middleware applications. As a result, application develop¬ ers can avoid the complex process and security hurdles required to give users access to widespread legacy business systems through CICS, MQSeries and Encina transaction middleware. IBM, Sun Microsystems, Inc. and integrator Planetworks, a sub¬ sidiary of Tangent International in New York, announced plans for a tool kit that lets Java developers use Java applets to pull data from existing transaction systems. 'ITie tool kit, called Interspace, will cost $4,995 for a two-user li¬ cense and will ship by year’s end. Interspace will run on AIX, Win¬ dows NT and Sun’s Solaris plat¬ forms. It uses technology from Planet Works to link Java applets to IBM’s middleware (see chart). CICS, MQSeries and hincina are middleware packages that make it easier to move complex data across different computer platforms and applications. Mid¬ dleware removes much of the complexity in the secure passing of data in the proper format among different systems. “We are hoping to see a brows¬ er be able to create a Java applet that talks with MQSeries and ac¬ cesses whatever data you want on the back end,” said Jim Cantin, a systems architect at Eastman Ko¬ dak Co. in Amherst, N.Y. Secure data By using MQSeries or CICS as a delivery mechanism, legacy data is securely available for Internet access rather than residing on less-secure PC servers or Web servers, analysts said. But users shouldn’t rush to give everyone access to legacy transaction applications. “CICS applications are usually designed for only internal users,” said Ed Acly, an analyst at Inter¬ national Data Corp. in Framing¬ ham, Mass. “So users may have to totally redesign the applica¬ tions anyway for a general Inter¬ net audience.” And Internet users are more of¬ ten interested in data access rath¬ er than production/transaction CICS applications, Acly said. But Sue Eustice, an analyst at Wintergreen Research, Inc. in Lexington, Mass., said getting middleware to the Internet is im¬ portant to improving business over the Web. And a recent report by D. H. Andrews Group, Inc. in Cheshire, Conn., said, “There is an opportu¬ nity for IBM’s middleware to be¬ come a de facto standard for com¬ mercial transactions on the Internet.” Java is like a sports car — ^ bound for a cliff. See page 59. RSA offers kit for secure credit-card transactions By Gary H. Anthes RSA Data Security, Inc. will an¬ nounce today a tool kit for devel¬ oping secure applications that support credit-card transactions on the Internet. The tool kit, called S/Pay, sup¬ ports developers’ use of the Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) pro¬ tocol developed by Visa International, Inc. and MasterCard International, Inc. SET uses RSA encryption to en¬ sure confidentiality and data in¬ tegrity during transactions. Ob¬ servers said it is emerging as the de facto standard for Internet- based credit-card applications. SET solution SET can be used for any kind of credit-card transaction sent over a public network, such as consum¬ ers shopping on the World Wide Web, or for business-to-business transactions on the Internet. “SET will be the solution of choice for credit-card payments,” said James Galvin, program man¬ ager for security and payments at CommerceNet, Inc., a nonprofit group of vendors and user compa¬ nies in Menlo Park, Calif. “By the end of the year, there will be many announcements of SIT-enabled products.” Some CommerceNet members will offer credit-card services built around SET, Galvin said. SET tool kits such as S/Pay are essential for the broad deploy¬ ment of electronic commerce us¬ ing credit cards, Galvin added. S/Pay comes in three versions, one each for applica¬ tions used by cardhold¬ ers, merchants and banks. Any application software that handles credit-card data needs to be made SET-compliant via S/Pay or some other mechanism. Other SET tool kits already ex¬ ist. For example, IBM offers one for application developers. The RSA kit was designed to trim the time it takes to develop SET-compliant applications. It al¬ so will reduce the chance that er¬ rors in implementing the SET standard will leave security holes in users’ applications, said Gary Kinghorn, product marketing di¬ rector at RSA (www.rsa.com). That isn’t an unlikely possibility when software vendors imple¬ ment their own cryptography, said John Pescatore, a senior con¬ sultant at Trusted Information Systems, Inc. in Rockville, Md. ©The federal government sets up a computer emergency response team.

News Summit to focus on management tools By Patrick Dryden Nearly 2,000 administrators of networks, systems and applica¬ tions this week will seek help with an ongoing problem: how to make individual management tools work — and someday work to¬ gether — to control complex envi¬ ronments. That’s the basic need that will draw information systems troops out of the trenches to Santa Clara, Calif., for the Enterprise Management Sum¬ mit ’96 conference, show organiz¬ ers said. The management group is based in San Francisco. Besides catching up on the lat¬ est advances from key vendors, users can collect tips and tools for their integration efforts. Users can learn more aboutthe En¬ terprise Management Summit at www.summit.microuse.com “We’re starting with a clean sheet to build our own structure that can integrate management tools,” said Darrell Epps, commu¬ nications engineer at Chevron In¬ formation Technology Co. in San Ramon, Calif. Vendors won’t compete in the traditional shoot-out, a much- watched event during which ven¬ dors apply their products to solve hoary problems that managers face daily. Reality has struck: The vendors now complain that those scenarios required too much time, money and expertise. To avoid embarrassment, ven¬ dors in noncompetitive demon¬ strations will address 15 prede¬ fined problems such as perfor¬ mance management and software distribution. In that showcase, Platinum Technolof^, Inc. plans to dem¬ onstrate the integration of its vari¬ ous point products. ITie Oak- brook Terrace, III, vendor will tackle the real-world scenarios us¬ ing its newly coordinated tools. BMC Software, Inc. in Hous¬ ton will introduce Version 3.1 of its Patrol management suite. Pa¬ trol’s new console interface and reports can help administrators watch the logical relations among applications and the physical con¬ nections, for example, among da¬ tabase servers. And to help moni¬ tor service quality, InfoVista, Inc, in Paris will demonstrate a tool that can help track performance of networked applica¬ tions to the depart¬ ment level in large organizations. New and expanded alliances will turn up this week, showing once again that no vendor can provide all management pieces. Digital Equipment Corp. will continue its string of reseller agreements by announcing a part¬ nership to sell Patrol manage¬ ment tools from BMC Software. Same side Even competing products will gain common support to help har¬ ried managers responsible for heterogeneous networks. Look for a demonstration of network performance modeling by Cisco Systems, Inc. that in¬ cludes routers from rival Bay Networks, Inc. Cisco next week plans to deliver a tool that tracks end-to-end traffic through both router brands, using technology from its recent acquisition of Net- Sys Technologies, Inc. Seagate Software will launch a version of its event-correlation software for Windows NT servers and network devices. Like its Unix-based predecessor, Nerve- Center NT filters multiple alerts and events throughout a network, identifies the problem and takes corrective action, such as paging an operator or invoking a Win¬ dows NT command. It will ship next month, starting at $1,650. Hewlett-Packard Co. will in¬ troduce a version of its Unbc- based OmniBack backup and re¬ store software for NT servers. But all attendees’ dreams won’t come true, of course. HP, for ex¬ ample, remains behind schedule for delivering a version of its OpenView Network Node Manag¬ er that runs on Windows NT. HP demonstrated the Unbc al¬ ternative to the OpenView Forum user group in June and promised delivery by now. But HP officials said they don’t expect to beta-test that version until year’s end.

Shipped NetView on Windows NT. Introduced Global Enterprise Manager, a TME 10 application interface. Flosted 200 tools vendors at a developer’s conference to define integration standards. By Patrick Dryden AUSTIN , TEXAS Efforts by Tivoli Systems, Inc. to build multivendor support for its enterprise management platform may give the IBM subsidiary an edge over rival Computer Asso¬ ciates International, Inc., accord¬ ing to some users and industry observers. At last week’s Tivoli develop¬ er’s conference here, program¬ mers and marketers from 200 management software vendors started to make their tools work together to control complex net¬ works, systems and application processes. Analysts deemed the turnout significant. And they said the for¬ mation of 10 working groups — which will define how any tool can fit Tivoli’s management frame¬ work — is unique for a fragment¬ ed industry. Less work for users If Tivoli and its partners succeed in delivering on this interoper¬ ability promise next year, users will be spared the chore of inte¬ grating favorite tools themselves. That would allow compatible man¬ agement applications to share alerts, status information and pro¬ cesses directly via the TME 10 platform. Tivoli’s Management Working Groups could make a big differ¬ ence in integrating and automat¬ ing tools more quickly, said Peter Martin, vice president of enter¬ prise automation at Wells Fargo & Co. in San Francisco. Both CA and Tivoli allow users a choice in selecting the compo¬ nents of their overall enterprise management platform. But Tivoli seems more proactive, while CA remains reactive, said Chip Glied- man, an analyst at Giga Informa¬ tion Group in Cambridge, Mass. ‘Tivoli is taking the lead to make its TME 10 platform an open standard, while CA leaves it up to vendors to tie in to Unicen¬ ter,” Gliedman said. “Vendors will have to support both platforms, but Tivoli’s approach may be the swing factor for deals over the next year.” Tivoli’s approach of “letting us select best-of-breed products” was very important in choosing TME 10 over CA’s Unicenter, said David Bowman, director of mid¬ range systems engineering at Ameritech, Inc. in Chicago. The pro-Tivoli comments were just a product of attendee excite¬ ment, CA officials said. They claimed that users and analysts deem Unicenter equally open — or more so. Vendors wisely back both platforms, CA officials said, noting that more than 100 use CA’s kit to integrate their tools with Unicenter. CA’s moves CA is shifting from a suite accessi¬ ble through a software develop¬ er’s kit to a more open platform, said Paul Mason, an analyst at In¬ ternational Data Corp. in Fra¬ mingham, Mass. But Tivoli leads in easing tool integration, he said. “Unicenter is like a picture book. You can change some pages if you line up the illustrations and insert them carefully,” Mason said. ‘TME 10 is more like a bind¬ er equipped with some needed pages. You can insert any page that lines up its punch holes.” Users pleased so far with ^ Tivoli underlBM. Seepage6i. Stamped with approval ots must happen before users can rely on Tivoli’s TME 10 to integrate their favorite vendors’ management tools. Tivoli and its partners must complete the definition of 10 interfaces for TME 10 and implement that support in their products. In the meantime, oth¬ er help is on the way. I^st week, Tivoli certified 19 products as ready to run with TME 10. All will ship before the end of the year. Four database management tools from vendors such as Informix Corp. and Sybase, Inc. run on the TME 10 platform. Tivoli provides modules that link existing tools to TME 10 so that operators can exchange alerts and launch various con¬ soles. Those include tools such as a workload manager from Platinum Technology, Inc., an output manager from Dazel Corp., storage managers from IBM and Legato Systems, Inc., four security managers, a IAN manager from Compaq Com¬ puter Corp. and five help desk systems. New TME 10 providers in¬ clude the systems integration arm of Sun Microsystems, Inc. Digital Equipment Corp. an¬ nounced plans to adopt TME 10 NetView network management software, and an official said the agreement could extend to the entire TME 10 line. — Patrick Dryden COMPUTERWORLD NOVEMBER 4, 1996 (www.computerworld.coni) News liJBCfctL' PafaBOT Coat Factory Warehouse Corp. in Burling¬ ton, N.J. “But as long as the ubiquitous computing platform is Windows, Oracle can’t go head- to-head with Microsoft, no matter how good its applets are.” ©Informix unveils distributed manage¬ ment, replication tools.

But Oracle has some convincing to do — even among its loyal customer base. In theory, Microsoft’s brand-name ad¬ vantage should be diluted in network com¬ puting environments that hide ever5d:hing under the covers of the World Wide Web, said Robert Rubin, chief information officer at Elf Atochem North America, Inc., a _ chemicals man- point, it’s more of a novelty item for me right now,” he said. “It’s not even on the radar scope for us to look at. ” That’s because of the immaturity of tech¬ nologies such as Java and concerns about Network computing network bandwidth, Hawkins said. “There could be a tremendous infrastructure im- _ pact here if you’re talking about everything coming over the net¬ work.” Products such as HatTrick and Developer/2000 for the Web “look pretty damn good,” said Michael Prince, MIS director at Burlington Elf Atochem CIO Robert Rubin says Microsoft’s brand-name advantage is expected to be diluted in network computing environments ufacturer in Philadelphia. “When I talk to somebody on the Internet, I don’t even know what they’re us¬ ing on the other end,” he said. But the rub for Oracle is that the useful¬ ness of network computers “is not totally estab¬ lished,” Rubin said. ‘There cer¬ tainly will be a place for them. But the question is, ‘Will it be a dominant place?’ ” Several other users also were doubtful that the Windows-centric world view would change any time soon. Paul Hoedeman, CIO at AlliedSignal Aerospace in Torrance, Calif., said a recent decision that requires AlliedSignal end users to get information systems approval before installing PC software “was very un¬ popular.” Getting his users to accept net¬ work computers would take “some very heavy selling,” he said. Even if network computers do catch on in a big way, Oracle “wouldn’t leap out in my mind as the obvious candidate to capi¬ talize on this,” Hoedeman said. “I just don’t think of them as being that nimble.” The arsenal Oracle this week will detail the following battering rams for its anti-Microsoft cru¬ sade: • A line of Intel Corp. Pentium-based net¬ work computers that should appear in the first half of next year. Oracle will announce a software environment and a reference hardware design for the boxes. • A set of Java-based desktop applets, code- named HatTrick, that sources said are ex¬ pected to be thin-client alternatives to Mi¬ crosoft Office. • Development tools for moving applica¬ tions from Windows desktops to intranet- based servers. • More specific plans for products that sup¬ port Oracle’s object-based Network Com¬ puting Architecture.

Tliat is the message Decision- One Corp. hopes to send at Com¬ dex/Fall ’96 later this month when it introduces an asset simu¬ lation tool designed to measure total cost of ownership and end- user technology utilization, Com- puterworld has learned. The system, which consists of a relational database and a Micro¬ soft Corp. Visual Basic application front end, would enable informa¬ tion systems managers to deter¬ mine how much it might cost to migrate a 200-seat accounts pay¬ able department from Novell, Inc. NetWare 4.1 to Microsoft’s Win¬ dows NT 3.5.1. That type of analysis would also enable chief information offi¬ cers such as Brooklyn Union’s Ti¬ na G. Barber to figure out “wheth¬ er we’re wasting money having everyone installed on a particular soft¬ ware package,” she said. Other IS manag¬ ers, including Wil¬ liam Wong, manager of financial systems at Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Connecti¬ cut in North Haven, were not sure if tools such as Deci¬ sionOne Simulator would be effective for their shops. “We don’t do that much cost-justification when we’re upgrading networks or servers — we usually do that for business reasons,” he said. Wong said a total-cost-of-owner- ship tool might be able to help the health insurer rein in some of its run¬ away distributed computing costs. “If the end user puts up a big enough argu¬ ment, we usually in¬ stall the hardware or software for them,” he said. “Maybe we should start thinking about cost-justification.” The software and services required Brooklyn Union’s Tina G. Barber says asset foo/s could prevent the bank from overlicensing users for desktop software for these types of analyses will cost between $20,000 and $45,000, said Ben Tatta, director of mar¬ keting at Frazer, Pa.-based Deci¬ sionOne. The simulator uses a total-cost- of-ownership tool called C/S Solu¬ tions Advisor from Interpose, Inc. in Altamonte Springs, Fla. It determines how much it would cost to support a network environ¬ ment over several years, includ¬ ing labor costs, network growth and downtime. Interpose Presi¬ dent Tom Pisello said. Measuring use DecisionOne and Interpose also plan to incorporate by mid-De¬ cember a “sniffer” technology from U.K.-based Prometrics’ Desktop Watch tool. The technol¬ ogy ferrets its way through a net¬ work to calculate, for example, the percentage of functionality a company’s end users are utilizing with word processing software. Those calculations would be done by partly using total-cost-of- ownership data from research outfits such as Gartner Group, Inc. and interviewing end users on their usage habits, Pisello said. DecisionOne Simulator will come in two pieces — a total-cost- ,of-ownership simulator and a pro¬ cess simulator designed to mea¬ sure, for example, the cost of help desk support, Tatta said. Analysts said other total-cost-of- ownership tools, including those from Tally Systems Corp., Syman¬ tec Corp. and McAfee Associates, Inc., are becoming more sophis¬ ticated and should begin deliver¬ ing functionality similar to Deci¬ sionOne Simulator by next year. “There are a lot of [IS manag¬ ers] running wild with the reality of total cost of ownership being thrown in their faces” by senior management, said Steve Clancy, principal analyst for desktop life cycle services at Dataquest Worldwide Services Group in Westboro, Mass.

COMPUTERWORID Everything you need to knoiu Synchronization tools Vendors are responding with several new product categories that gather data off-line through intelligent agents, queue the data for transmission and then exchange the data in brief communication sessions — a process called synchronization. “It makes a difference when you have salespeople that are not technicians,’’ said Dan Barth, vice president and chief infor¬ mation officer at Pinnacle Brands, Inc. in Dallas. “One phone call takes care of all their transfer needs.’’ Pinnacle recently installed a sales force automation system that gives users remote access to Notes, an online analytical pro¬ cessing database and PCs on the compa¬ ny’s LAN. Transferring large files to and from headquarters would ordinarily take more than an hour and require many con¬ nections. Barth and his team installed XcelleNet, Inc.’s RemoteWare and its RemoteWare Replication Agent product. Together they let remote users conduct transactions with the main office in one connection. While the client and server are disconnect¬ ed, agents on both sides scan documents, databases and applications for changes made since the last connection. The changes are replicated, compressed, queued for transmission and exchanged in one phone call.

But users said they also hope for a better fit with Win¬ dows NT systems. IBM revealed the following AS/400 plans for next year: • Sixty-four-bit RISC models of the AS/400 will begin to ship with support for up to eight high-speed PowerPC processors. The models will be designed to speed up pro- > .V ‘ A.'r- .MT careeragent.COMPUTERWORLD-com Have you seen your agent today? New from; COM D November 4, 1996 (www.computerworid.com) cessing, especially for power users. • The same RISC systems will provide 20G bytes of system memory to speed access to information stored on the AS/400’s inte¬ grated DB2 database. • A Windows NT Workstation version of Client Access/400 will hit the streets, let¬ ting Windows NT Workstations access AS/400 applications without having to go through an emulation screen. • To provide World Wide Web integration and simplify client access, IBM hopes to ship native Java support in OS/400. Users are especially eager to blend the Windows NT and AS/400 environments, and they don’t like being hampered by the lags in AS/ 400 development. ‘We initially wanted to put Windows NT Workstation into our accounting depart¬ ment [to access the AS/400], but Client Access/ 400 isn’t available for that yet,” said Eliot Robinson, an information systems manager at Sterling National Bank & Trust Co. in New York. Other users said they want the AS/400 to host their NT Server applications on the AS/400’s Integrated File Server, which is essentially a built-in Intel Corp. PC board. “The reason we went to AS/400 RISC is that with the Integrated File Server, we can drop Windows NT right onto it,” said Gary Reichman, database manager at the Ameri¬ can Red Cross in Atlanta. Cautious approach Some users even said Common isn’t mov¬ ing fast enough to offer enough Windows NT or Windows 95 sessions during the con¬ ference. But for IBM, there is some danger in embracing NT too closely. Although the AS/400 scales better than other systems, competitors such as NT will be able to meet nearly 90% of the needs of most database and application requirements by 1998, said Tom Bittman, an analyst at Gartner Group, Inc. in Stamford, Conn. And once users place more Windows NT applications on the AS/400, they may de¬ cide to off-load everything to a separate Windows NT server and leave only file and print services on the AS/400, Bittman said. But IBM officials said the AS/400 has two characteristics in its favor: a 64-bit ar¬ chitecture that lets existing applications take full advantage of the newly available addressing space without additional pro¬ gramming, and a similarity between the structure of Java and OS/400 that will let the two integrate very well. IBM rolls out AS/400S and RS/6000S to compete with NT. See page 45.

COMPAa Has It Changed Your Life Yet? 28 News I j Lotus eyes groupware vistas New president talks prices, emphasizes retail market push I^tus Development Corp. has a new president, former Chief Oper¬ ating Officer Jeffrey Papows. And the Cambridge, Mass. , subsidiary of IBM has a new naming and pricing scheme for its groupware products. Papows last week spoke with Computerworld senior writer Tim Ouellette about both topics. What do you want to tell \\J VV . the Notes user base about yourself and your back¬ ground? TI3, I’ve spent 17 years in the cJ Jr . systems software side of business — meaning databases, tools and applications. I’ve been at Lotus for five years. The composi¬ tion ofthe management team at Lotus is much more enterprise- critical than people suspect. r^\\Tm Competitors continue Vy' V V . to use price as a differ¬ entiator to Notes. Do your plans to raise server pricing in January hurt Lotus’ position? TT), I don’tthinkso. It wasn’t • so much a pricingaction as a range of additional product extensionsand added new technol¬ ogy. The point of comparison is pertinent because our SMP version of Domino costs $2,995 compared with $3,995 for[Netscape Commu¬ nications Corp.’s] SuiteSpot. Whether our SMP server is two, four, six or eight processors, it is one price. Netscape goes up 40% when [it adds] a new processor. The real cost argument is about scalability, reliability and cost of ownership. Even though you are V V . committed to competing in the client arena, does the price in crease reflect th e fa ct that th e server side is the more important buy for users these days? TT), What we said is, we now t)± • have a vivid design around the high-value end ofthe Web server market — collabora¬ tion, application services, transac¬ tion and content. We want to have the same kind of dominant share in that space. Netscape and Microsoft are saying it isn’t about browsers ''The real cost argument is about scalability, reliability and cost of ownership. ” — Jeffrey Papows, President, Lotus but higher-value clients. But most ofthe function they deliver is still synonymous with what we ship now with Notes. VV . will service costs change at all? TT), There is no effect. It all fits tJJL» right into the Passport [support] program. TTTl T, Microsoft claims there V V . are more Notes users running its Office than Lotus’ SmartSuite. Will you go after these users to move them to SmartSuite, and how? TT), We have focused around cJir. retail sales and forthe first time got involved in an OEM strategy for SmartSuite. A year ago, we had 11% share in this area. We have 27% share now. It clearly is working. ©Desktop suite market heats up with product updates. See page 55. Notes changes name, shifts focns to Internet By Tim Ouellette Domino is now the name of the game for Notes users. And it could be a more expensive game. That’s because Lotus Develop¬ ment Corp. has renamed Notes 4.5, which will ship by year’s end, as Lotus Domino 4.5: Powered by Notes. And to reflect the additional functionality crammed into the groupware product since late last year, the Cambridge, Mass., sub¬ sidiary of IBM is hiking the serv¬ er price to $995 (see chart) . But observer said the changes are justified as Lotus turns Notes into an Internet and intranet serv¬ er. Notes client naming and pric¬ ing will remain the same, howev¬ er. “The repricing comes as no sur¬ prise. I imagined Lotus would ei¬ ther unbundle Domino or in¬ crease server pricing,” said Bruce Reed, manager of technical ser¬ vices at Intrinsa Corp., a Notes shop in Palo Alto, Calif. “Consid¬ ering the capabilities of the entire package, it is a bargain by any standard.” Reed said the group scheduling features alone are worth the $500 increase. Other capabilities announced last week include Domino server licenses for non-Notes clients for $35. And early next year, Lotus will introduce $29 software, called Weblicator, that gives World Wide Web browsers use of Notes repli-,^ cation features to download Web data that gets fully text indexed. Additionally, users can opt to buy clustering and server usage tracking features for an additional $1,000 per server. Called Domino Advanced Services, the features were originally planned for deliv¬ ery last summer. Currently, Pub¬ lic Notes Network providers such as the IBM Global Network use these features to offer wide-scale services and track billing data. “Lotus is continuing to push the mission-critical envelope of what intranets can provide,” said Ian Campbell, an analyst at Interna¬ tional Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. “The value is increasing at a greater rate than the price.” Take Note, it’s Domino now Domino 4.5 will cost more, but it’s packed with features Notes 4.1 ($475) • Notes Mail • SMTP MTA • cc:Mail MTA • Web browser Domino 4.5 ($995) Notes Mail SMTP MTA CGMail MTA Web browser Native HTML/HTTP support ' Integrated group scheduling Integration with Windows NT Support for POP3 clients Domino Advanced Services ($1,000) Mail-access license for non-Notes clients ($35) Fix is in for U.S. Robotics modems By Mindy Blodgett U.S. Robotics Corp. has an¬ nounced a fix for several mod¬ els of the Sportster V.34 mo¬ dems that tend to pause unex¬ pectedly during some types of data transmissions. The fix — either the replace¬ ment of the faulty chip set or an exchange of buggy modems for a newer, bug-free model — is available through the U.S. Ro¬ botics World Wide Web site (www.usr.com). The problem affects several models of the V.34 fax, voice and data modems for desktops. U.S. Robotics officials in Sko¬ kie, Ill., said that through the Web site, users can fill out a form and electronically mail it in for the fi'ee exchange pro¬ gram. Company officials said the problem only affects interactive data transmissions, such as on¬ line chatting. The fix announcement comes about six months after users complained about bugs in U.S. Robotics Sportster and Courier PC Cards for laptops. Overheating glitch At that time, U.S. Robotics offi¬ cials downplayed the problems, which some users said involved chronic overheating. Troy Kent, information tech¬ nology specialist at utility com¬ pany Entergy Services, Inc. in Gretna, La., said Entergy had serious problems with Courier PC Card modems in laptops be¬ cause of overheating. Once the laptops became warm, the mo¬ dems would shut down trans¬ missions, Kent said. This summer, the company received"
