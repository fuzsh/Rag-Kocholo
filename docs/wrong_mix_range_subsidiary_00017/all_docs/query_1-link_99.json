Page and Brin love maths jokes). But that was taken. They settled on ‘Google’. Had Gates known about them, he might have worried, briefly. But there was no way Gates could have easily known about it – except by spending lots and lots of time surfing the web. The scientific paper describing how Google chose its results wasn’t formally published until the end of December 1998; a paper describing how ‘PageRank’, the system used to determine what order the search results should be delivered in – with the ‘most relevant’ (as determined by the rest of the web) first – wasn’t deposited with Stanford University’s online publishing service until 1999.15 The duo incorporated Google as a company on 4 September 1998, while they were renting space in the garage of Susan Wojcicki.\n\nThinking Machines: The Inside Story of Artificial Intelligence and Our Race to Build the Future by Luke Dormehl\n\n\"World Economic Forum\" Davos, Ada Lovelace, agricultural Revolution, AI winter, Albert Einstein, Alexey Pajitnov wrote Tetris, algorithmic management, algorithmic trading, AlphaGo, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Apple II, artificial general intelligence, Automated Insights, autonomous vehicles, backpropagation, Bletchley Park, book scanning, borderless world, call centre, cellular automata, Charles Babbage, Claude Shannon: information theory, cloud computing, computer vision, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, correlation does not imply causation, crowdsourcing, deep learning, DeepMind, driverless car, drone strike, Elon Musk, Flash crash, Ford Model T, friendly AI, game design, Geoffrey Hinton, global village, Google X / Alphabet X, Hans Moravec, hive mind, industrial robot, information retrieval, Internet of things, iterative process, Jaron Lanier, John Markoff, John Maynard Keynes: Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren, John Maynard Keynes: technological unemployment, John von Neumann, Kickstarter, Kodak vs Instagram, Law of Accelerating Returns, life extension, Loebner Prize, machine translation, Marc Andreessen, Mark Zuckerberg, Menlo Park, Mustafa Suleyman, natural language processing, Nick Bostrom, Norbert Wiener, out of africa, PageRank, paperclip maximiser, pattern recognition, radical life extension, Ray Kurzweil, recommendation engine, remote working, RFID, scientific management, self-driving car, Silicon Valley, Skype, smart cities, Smart Cities: Big Data, Civic Hackers, and the Quest for a New Utopia, social intelligence, speech recognition, Stephen Hawking, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Steven Pinker, strong AI, superintelligent machines, tech billionaire, technological singularity, The Coming Technological Singularity, The Future of Employment, Tim Cook: Apple, Tony Fadell, too big to fail, traumatic brain injury, Turing machine, Turing test, Vernor Vinge, warehouse robotics, Watson beat the top human players on Jeopardy!\n\nIn this way, working towards achieving consciousness in a machine is a little like the way Google is perfecting their search engine. Larry Page and Sergey Brin began at Stanford with their PageRank algorithm, which remains the kernel of the Google empire. PageRank ranked pages according to the quality and number of incoming links to each page. But while PageRank remains a crucially important algorithm, Google has since enhanced it with 200 different unique signals, or what it refers to as ‘clues’, which make informed guesses about what it is that users are looking for. As Google engineers explain, ‘These signals include things like the terms on websites, the freshness of content [and] your region,’ in addition to PageRank.\n\n…\n\nTo find a specific word or phrase

P. Lovecraft than Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The team allowed the neural network to accentuate whatever eccentricities it discovered. Instructed to maximise the elements found in each image, Deep Dream created trippy flights of fancy. Given an image and asked to classify it and then add more detail, the neural network became trapped in strange, fascinating feedback loops. Clouds were associated with birds, and Deep Dream sought to make them ever more ‘birdlike’. A photograph of a clear sky would rapidly be filled with Google’s idealised avians, as though the world’s most powerful search engine had suddenly decided to become a graffiti artist.\n\nAutomate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World by Christopher Steiner\n\n23andMe, Ada Lovelace, airport security, Al Roth, algorithmic trading, Apollo 13, backtesting, Bear Stearns, big-box store, Black Monday: stock market crash in 1987, Black-Scholes formula, call centre, Charles Babbage, cloud computing, collateralized debt obligation, commoditize, Credit Default Swap, credit default swaps / collateralized debt obligations, delta neutral, Donald Trump, Douglas Hofstadter, dumpster diving, financial engineering, Flash crash, G4S, Gödel, Escher, Bach, Hacker News, High speed trading, Howard Rheingold, index fund, Isaac Newton, Jim Simons, John Markoff, John Maynard Keynes: technological unemployment, knowledge economy, late fees, machine translation, Marc Andreessen, Mark Zuckerberg, market bubble, Max Levchin, medical residency, money market fund, Myron Scholes, Narrative Science, PageRank, pattern recognition, Paul Graham, Pierre-Simon Laplace, prediction markets, proprietary trading, quantitative hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies, ride hailing / ride sharing, risk tolerance, Robert Mercer, Sergey Aleynikov, side project, Silicon Valley, Skype, speech recognition, Spread Networks laid a new fibre optics cable between New York and Chicago, transaction costs, upwardly mobile, Watson beat the top human players on Jeopardy!, Y Combinator\n\nThis model of ranking things based on small clues of influence is the same calculus that drives PageRank, Google’s algorithm, named after cofounder Larry Page, which steers Web traffic to sites the Web regards as authoritative on the subject being searched. Important Web sites are called hubs and influencers. Google gives more credence in its search results to sites that are often linked to by influential sites and hubs. If these sites commonly refer to, say, a particular flight-booking search engine as the best one while concurrently linking to it, it’s likely that this Web site will rise to the top of Google’s results. By looking at where the influential sites link, Google’s algorithm can quickly determine what to show for any query a user might type in.\n\n…\n\n., 3, 218 “Explanation of Binary Arithmetic”

importance of each link by the number of pages that in turn linked to each of the pages that originated the links, and so on, and so on. The algorithm that Page and Brin developed created a rank of every page and was called “PageRank.” Their paper describing this approach, titled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine,” was presented in April 1998 at the Seventh International World-Wide Web Conference in Brisbane, Australia. The company that the pair created to put this approach into practice—initially called BackRub, but later renamed Google—was founded in September 1998 in Silicon Valley. Google changed the world with the realization that even though the crowd’s online content was uncontrolled, it wasn’t disorganized.\n\n…\n\nGoogle changed the world with the realization that even though the crowd’s online content was uncontrolled, it wasn’t disorganized. It, in fact, had an extremely elaborate and fine-grained structure, but not one that was consciously decided on by any core group of humans. Instead, it was a structure that emerged from the content itself, once it was analyzed by the company’s PageRank algorithm and all of its relatives. This emergent structure changes and grows as the content itself does, and lets us smoothly and easily navigate all the content that the crowd comes up with. The second problem that inevitably comes with an uncontrolled crowd is that some of its members misbehave in hurtful ways. The core can evict bad actors—from the company, the library, or the payroll—but the web really can’t; it’s too easy to come in by employing another user name or IP address,‡ or to hide behind anonymity.\n\n…\n\nBertram’s Mind, The” (AI-generated prose), 121 MySpace, 170–71 Naam, Ramez, 258n Nakamoto, Satoshi, 279–85, 287, 296–97, 306, 312 Nakamoto Institute, 304 Nappez, Francis, 190 Napster, 144–45 NASA, 15 Nasdaq, 290–91 National Association of Realtors, 39 National Enquirer, 132 National Institutes of Health, 253 National Library of Australia, 274 Naturalis Historia (Pliny the Elder), 246 natural language processing, 83–84 “Nature of the Firm, The” (Coase), 309–10 Navy, US, 72 negative prices, 216 Nelson, Ted, 33 Nelson, Theodore, 229 Nesbitt, Richard, 45 Netflix, 187 Netscape Navigator, 34 network effects, 140–42 defined, 140 diffusion of platforms and, 205–6 O2O platforms and, 193 size of network and, 217 Stripe and, 174 Uber’s market value and, 219 networks, Cambrian Explosion and, 96 neural networks, 73–74, 78 neurons, 72–73 Newell, Allen, 69 Newmark, Craig, 138 New Republic, 133 news aggregators, 139–40 News Corp, 170, 171 newspapers ad revenue, 130, 132, 139 publishing articles directly on Facebook, 165 Newsweek, 133 New York City Postmates in, 185 taxi medallion prices before and after Uber, 201 UberPool in, 9 New York Times, 73, 130, 152 Ng, Andrew, 75, 96, 121, 186 Nielsen BookScan, 293, 294 99Degrees Custom, 333–34 99designs, 261 Nixon, Richard, 280n Nokia, 167–68, 203 noncredentialism, 241–42 Norman, Robert, 273–74 nugget ice, 11–14 Nuomi, 192 Nupedia, 246–48 Obama, Barack, election of 2012, 48–51 occupancy rates, 221–22 oDesk, 188 Office of Personnel Management, US, 32 oil rigs, 100 on-demand economy, future of companies in, 320 online discussion groups, 229–30 online payment services, 171–74 online reviews, 208–10 O2O (online to offline) platforms, 185–98 business-to-business, 188–90 consumer-oriented, 186–88 defined, 186 as engines of liquidity, 192–96 globalization of, 190–92 interdisciplinary insights from data compiled by, 194 for leveraging assets, 196–97 and machine learning, 194 Opal (ice maker), 13–14 Open Agriculture Initiative, 272 openness (crowd collaboration principle), 241 open platforms curation and, 165 downsides, 164 importance of, 163–65 as key to success, 169 open-source software;

Google’s best-known statistical measurement of a Web site is PageRank,45 a score based on how many other Web pages link to the one you might be seeking out. But PageRank is just one of two hundred signals that Google uses46 to approximate the human evaluators’ judgment. Of course, this is not such an easy task—two hundred signals applied to an almost infinite array of potential search queries. This is why Google places so much emphasis on experimentation and testing. The product you know as Google search, as good as it is, will very probably be a little bit different tomorrow.\n\n…\n\n., 396 O’Meara, Christopher, 36 Omori’s Law, 477 On-base percentage (OBP), 95,
