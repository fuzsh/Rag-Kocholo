        "text": "*\n\nI don’t write a lot about link building on SEO 2. Why? I did for many years.\n\nUsually I attempted to expand the concept to go beyond “building”.\n\nI questioned the premise of “manual link building” from day one. Why?\n\nThis is not how link building for SEO actually works! Really? Let me clarify.\n\nWhat Does Link Building for SEO Even Mean?\n\nIn the past link building meant “inserting links to your site on other people’s websites”. It was often sneaky.\n\nIn most cases it did not add any value. In the worst case it was about hacking websites to insert links!\n\nInstead I focused on sharing, engagement and outreach (SEO 2) or as many people refer to it: “social SEO”.\n\nEssentially I was attracting links!\n\nWhy? These things actually make you get links from real people who link to you of their own accord!\n\nYes. You can build links without manually building them or link begging. It’s just not “building” really.\n\nLink Building Does NOT Go Away\n\nYet the term link building doesn’t go away. That’s the problem!\n\nNo matter how often I and other people say that you have to\n\nget links\n\nearn links\n\nattract links\n\nPeople both from the SEO industry and clients always want you to build links or write about it.\n\nThey often even dismiss alternatives like content creation and building relationships in many cases.\n\nThus it’s important to update your view on what link building actually means for SEO and beyond.\n\nIt’s not what it used to be many years ago when the term was coined.\n\nIn essence you to create linkable assets to attract links organically.\n\nDemand and Supply\n\nThe ongoing demand is not the only reason why I return to the topic of link building! What else?\n\nOver the years some of my colleagues I value very much have linked to me in their link building resources:\n\nWayne Barker of Boom Online has added two of my link building posts to his selection of valuable link building articles.\n\nJason Acidre of Kaiser the Sage has mentioned me in his very insightful post on high-level link building techniques.\n\nDespite my reluctance to deal with link building some people who know the SEO trade consider me worthy enough to point out my expertise in this arena.\n\nThat’s another reason why I decided to disclose how link building really works these days.\n\nIt’s such an in-depth tutorial like Jason writes. It’s a resource list like the amazing collection by Wayne.\n\nI still hope it will help you to make sense of the current Internet landscape and the ways you can make other people link to your site.\n\nLink Building vs Attracting Links\n\nThere are two kinds of link building: the one that I sell to clients and the other one, the one that I practice intuitively for myself and my blog here.\n\nIt’s not that I cheat my clients or something selling them second rate link building while I do the real thing for myself. It’s just that\n\nMost clients haven’t adapted yet to the current state of SEO of today. Why?\n\nBusiness people are still approaching link building with a traditional mindset. Many\n\nclients want links right away and are ready to take short cuts\n\nthey want link building as a separate task that has not much to do with their website\n\nthey want link building without the effort needed to make it possible (e.g. content creation)\n\nIn contrast I take many things for granted that my clients do not have.\n\nThat’s why they contact me for link building services, otherwise they probably would not need me.\n\nWhat are these things most clients and their websites lack?\n\nhaving a name aka personal branding\n\nhaving friends online aka relationship building\n\nhaving linkable assets aka content creation\n\nI do have all three to some extent. I’m not a SEO celebrity but the people who matter know who I am.\n\nMany more have read my articles elsewhere but do not remember they were mine probably.\n\nNonetheless enough people recognize me. How do I measure “enough”?\n\nI can see it by how many read and share what I write.\n\nI notice how connected I am when my newly published content spreads by itself without me overtly pushing it.\n\nIn case you’re completely new to an industry people won’t even look at your content at first let alone spread it.\n\nFor a client I need to overcome the lack of a personal brand.\n\nEven in case you have a brand name people won’t share your content just because they know you.\n\nThe person who actually writes and/or shares the content is pivotal.\n\nPeople follow other people not companies unless the brands are really huge like Apple or Google.\n\nOnce you command a huge brand then no matter what you do most people will clap.\n\nAverage businesses can’t rely on such loyalty. They have to reach out instead or better make friends. That’s what I offer them.\n\nReaching out just for the link is a short cut. Especially cold mailing people out of the blue is one.\n\nIdeally they know you for a while before you actually ask them for a favor.\n\nEven getting people’s attention is a favor nowadays.\n\nOnce they know you it takes quite a while and some attention on your side before you become actual friends in the online sense.\n\nHow to Make Friends Online\n\nYou do not have to meet your online friends in person.\n\nWayne lives in the UK, Jason is based on the Philippines.\n\nMeeting them is not that simple especially as I don’t travel much unlike some famous SEO spokespeople. Still\n\nregular attention\n\nexchange of ideas\n\nmutual aid\n\nrespect\n\nmade us what I consider online friends beyond the meaning of that term on social media sites.\n\nDo they link to me because they owe me a favor or because I ask them to? Not really.\n\nThey link to me because they know me, respect me and thus read my articles in the first place.\n\nYou Need to Know People to Become Known\n\nWhen people like my content they link to them in their posts.\n\nThey link partly because they know me yet that often not enough.\n\nThey also know how I usually react: I will notice it and reciprocate by at least sharing their article or linking to it in some cases (see above!).\n\nYet it’s not like a link exchange or something.\n\nOf course my posts have to be good enough to get the links as well. It’s natural give and take.\n\nWithout my friends listening to what I say I wouldn’t get the links and shares, or much fewer of them.\n\nFor clients in most cases I have to be quick.\n\nOutreach campaigns usually are short term.\n\nBusiness people want to see results ASAP. Whatever they might be.\n\nIt’s difficult to reach out and stay connected to the bloggers and influencers I have contacted on their behalf.\n\nIn the worst case it’s the dreaded “cold outreach” to strangers who are moszt likely to ignore you!\n\nDon’t talk to strangers was a mantra our parents repeated too often!\n\nYet people do not go out of their way just because someone they have never talked to asks them for a favor out of the blue!\n\nIn a way neither I nor them have the online friends needed to get the traction needed.\n\nThis is how you attract the links you deserve though. At least I hope they deserve them.\n\nSadly in most cases clients don’t deserve to get links. Why? They don’t have the linkable assets I take for granted.\n\nThen they approach me and want them over night. Here again there is no quick substitute for a strategy. You build up the assets one by one over time.\n\nA blog is not a panacea for a site that does not have any content beyond sales copy and any assets beyond the products they sell.\n\nUntil recently potential clients like these would not get back to me after I told them about the things they need to do.\n\nThese people went to the next SEO expert who build them links by paying for them. Paid links get riskier with every Google update.\n\nThe so called Penguin update has killed off many sites that relied on paid links and other artificially built links. That clean-up was long overdue.\n\nUntil then many low quality sites ranked high without actual acknowledgement from real people. The links were literally made up or simply built.\n\nI have lots of helpful content and even my content that is merely great gets also links. Why?\n\nIt’s because people know me and some of them are my friends who tell their friends and so on.\n\nBeing recommended by a friend makes me credible even among perceived strangers.\n\nValuable content by itself is only part of the equation. Just try three 3Cs:\n\nconnections\n\ncontent\n\ncredibility\n\nmay already suffice to get enough other people to notice you.\n\nThen for them to spread the word about you. This will ultimately result in social shares and editorial links.\n\nIt Takes Time to Do it Right\n\nYou need to understand that these three prerequisites I take for granted work only in the long run.\n\nOnce they work you do not even have to spend time on link building directly.\n\nGive me half a year and I will lay the foundation for you to get those natural links.\n\nGive me another half a year and I will make the links arrive this organic way by itself.\n\nAfter a year you have a link building perpetuum mobile.\n\nGive me just a few months and a number of links I have to generate instantly and I will have to resort to\n\ncold outreach\n\none link stands\n\nself-promotion\n\nfor merely great content nobody will see without me pushing it.\n\nA modern link building strategy has to entail half a year of preparation before the links arrive naturally.\n\nAnything faster will be less organic and ultimately not future-proof.\n\nInvest time now to prepare for tomorrow or pay again next time once the current short cuts won’t work anymore.\n\nDirect blogger outreach already does not yield the results you’d expect. Why that?\n\nBloggers are not readily waiting to work for you. They are busy!\n\nMany bloggers want money even though you offer them free content.\n\nYou may end up paying for links again in the worst case.\n\nTake your time and practice link building like it really works foe SEO and beyond.\n\nTake the long road but the one that leads to the desired destination.\n\nAttract links as part of a true organic reach approach. That’s how SEO works!\n\nAdditional Link Building Resources\n\nYou still haven’t read enough about link building or attracting links?\n\nThen I recommend these additional guides below for further reading:\n\nLink Building For SEO: The Definitive Guide by Backlinko\n\nWhat is Link Building — A Beginner’s Guide by PageOnePower\n\nLink Building for SEO: How to Do It Right by SEMrush\n\n* Perpetuum mobile is a Creative Commons image by Thilo Hilberer."
