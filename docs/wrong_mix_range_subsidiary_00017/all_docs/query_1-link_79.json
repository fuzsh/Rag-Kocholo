As told to The New York Times in Tim Arango, “How the AOL–Time Warner Merger Went So Wrong,” New York Times, January 10, 2010. For other sources on the AOL–Time Warner merger, see Johnnie L. Roberts, “How It All Fell Apart,” Newsweek, December 9, 2002, and three books: Nina Munk, Fools Rush In (New York: HarperCollins, 2004); Alec Klein, Stealing TIME: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Collapse of AOL Time Warner (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2003); and Kara Swisher, There Must Be a Pony In Here Somewhere: The AOL Time Warner Debacle and the Quest for a Digital Future (New York: Crown Business, 2003). 2.\n\n…\n\nThe early 2000s might have turned into a war of accumulation among three vertically integrated great powers: Microsoft-GE (NBC’s parent), AOL Time Warner, and Comcast-Disney. Eventually everything on the Internet would have been owned by one of them. That would have made for a tidier information economy, centered mainly on two mega-industries: the media conglomerates and the telephone companies. But something went wrong. Microsoft stopped buying media. Disney rejected Comcast’s merger offers. And AOL Time Warner became the textbook example of what not to do—as Ken Auletta calls it, “the Merger from Hell.”11 WHAT HAPPENED? The books about the AOL Time Warner saga are the work of business reporters and as such tend to focus on the personalities, clashes of corporate cultures, and terse boardroom encounters.\n\n…\n\nAnd within three months of that rendezvous on the reviewing stand, on January 10, 2000, they were holding a press conference to announce their own revolution: a $350 billion merger between the world’s biggest media company and biggest Internet firm. AOL would be the engine that brought Time Warner’s old media holdings—a treasury of what was becoming known as “content”—into the new world. It was an effusive spectacle. Levin said “We’ve become a company of high-fives and hugs.” Ted Turner, the largest individual shareholder, likened it to “the first time I made love some forty-two years ago.”5 It looked as if the future had indeed arrived. To many it seemed that the Internet would eventually belong to vertically integrated giants on the model of AOL Time Warner. Here’s Steve Lohr writing in The New York Times in 2000: “The America Online–Time Warner merger [will] create a powerhouse for the next phase of Internet business: selling information and entertainment services to consumers who may tap into them using digital cell phones, handheld devices and television set-top boxes in addition to personal computers.”6 In time, it was envisioned, three or four consolidated firms—say, AOL Time Warner, Microsoft-Disney, and perhaps Comcast-NBC—would slowly divide up the juiciest Internet properties, such as Yahoo!\n\nAs the Future Catches You: How Genomics & Other Forces Are Changing Your Work, Health & Wealth by Juan Enriquez\n\nAlbert Einstein, AOL-Time Warner, Apollo 13, Berlin Wall, bioinformatics, borderless world, British Empire, Buckminster Fuller, business cycle, creative destruction, digital divide, double helix, Ford Model T, global village, Gregor Mendel, half of the world's population has never made a phone call, Helicobacter pylori, Howard Rheingold, Jeff Bezos, Joseph Schumpeter, Kevin Kelly, knowledge economy, more computing power than Apollo, Neal Stephenson, new economy, personalized medicine, purchasing power parity, Ray Kurzweil, Richard Feynman, Robert Metcalfe, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, SETI@home, Silicon Valley, spice trade, stem cell, the new new thing, yottabyte\n\n(At the end of 1997, Time Warner’s assets were about forty times those of AOL … But the Internet boom changed things … So did AoL’s 27 million subscribers.) The speed and scope of technological change is such that … AOL became twice as valuable as Time Warner … And became the lead company … In the world’s largest merger. (A new company that expects to be Microsoft’s main competitor … By January 2001 AOL Time Warner controlled 33 percent of Americans’ time on the Net … Yahoo! had 7 percent … Microsoft 6 percent.) Things change very quickly in a digital world. Even companies … That have more cash … That have more information … And that have become larger … Than most national economies … Are by no means guaranteed survival … Either they get smarter … And grow … Or someone will eat them up.6 THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY … TO BUILD … AND DESTROY … IS SUCH … THAT IT IS LIKELY … FEW OF US HAVE EVER HEARD … THE NAME OF WHAT WILL BE THE WORLD’S LARGEST COMPANY … IN 2020.\n\n…\n\nTechnology companies are getting very large … and very powerful… Microsoft’s stock value … Before a judge ruled it a monopoly … Was approaching the value … Of everything Canada produced in one year. In the first quarter of 2000, AOL Time Warner’s market value was greater than everything produced during 1998 by all those who lived in a country like … OR LOOK AT IT A DIFFERENT WAY … OF ALL THE WORLD’S 190 “OFFICIAL” COUNTRIES … LESS THAN ONE-TENTH PRODUCED ENOUGH WEALTH IN 1998 … TO BE ABLE TO BUY AOL TIME WARNER. Even products that … Are by no means essential … That can be substituted by something cheaper … Or by something made locally … Or by products that are healthier … Can dominate using … Talent, scale, and know-how … AND THE LOGIC OF GLOBAL CAPITALISM IS … THAT ONE MUST DOMINATE … THE WHOLE … WORLD … FAST.\n\n…\n\nA language we cannot speak or read directly … We have to use chips and machines to understand. (This is different from communicating in, say, English-Chinese-English. No human translator can take the raw code inside a floppy disk, cell phone, pager, or TV and simultaneously tell you what it says.) Digital code is what drives rapid growth today. It allows mergers like AOL Time Warner … It drives the Internet, TV, music, finance, IT, news coverage, research, manufacturing. A few countries and companies understood this change. That is how poor countries like Finland, Singapore, and Taiwan got so wealthy … So quickly … But a lot of folks just did not learn to read and write a new language … And even though they produced more and more goods, particularly commodities … And even though they restructured companies and governments … Cut budgets, raised taxes, built large factories and buildings … They got a lot poorer.\n\nHow I Built This: The Unexpected Paths to Success From the World's Most Inspiring Entrepreneurs by Guy Raz\n\nAirbnb, AOL-Time Warner, Apple II, barriers to entry, Bear Stearns, Ben Horowitz, Big Tech, big-box store, Black Monday: stock market crash in 1987, Blitzscaling, business logic, call centre, Clayton Christensen, commoditize, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Credit Default Swap, crowdsourcing, data science, East Village, El Camino Real, Elon Musk, fear of failure, glass ceiling, growth hacking, housing crisis, imposter syndrome, inventory management, It's morning again in America, iterative process, James Dyson, Jeff Bezos, Justin.tv, Kickstarter, low cost airline, Lyft, Marc Andreessen, Mark Zuckerberg, move fast and break things, Nate Silver, Paul Graham, Peter Thiel, pets.com, power law, rolodex, Ronald Reagan, Ruby on Rails, Salesforce, Sam Altman, Sand Hill Road, side hustle, Silicon Valley, software as a service, South of Market, San Francisco, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, subprime mortgage crisis, TED Talk, The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver, Tony Hsieh, Uber for X, uber lyft, Y Combinator, Zipcar\n\nOnly a company that has lost its way a little bit, that doesn’t know precisely what business it’s actually in, tends to fight itself like this. Andy only needed to look twenty blocks uptown from his New York office and a few years into the past, at AOL Time Warner and the titanic merger that created the company in 2000, to see what the worst possible version of this might look like. When AOL and Time Warner merged, a lot was made of the new media entity’s size and market cap. The potential created by both teams leveraging the assets they brought to the table was difficult to contemplate let alone calculate. The merger was valued at $165 billion, but that was probably just a guess.\n\n…\n\nWith a strong culture unified by a larger mission and propelled by people who were all rowing in the same direction, they could have even leveraged the obstacles they faced into opportunities. Except inside AOL Time Warner, there was no unity to be found, and within a decade the merger would be dead. Both companies would lose more than 85 percent of their premerger value. Time Warner would eventually spin off its cable business (Time Warner Cable), it’s publishing business (Time Inc.), and, of course, AOL, which would reenter a radically transformed digital media landscape as a wandering shell of its former self. The smaller Time Warner rebranded itself as WarnerMedia, which was ultimately sold to AT&T for around $85 billion in 2018.\n\n…\n\nIn the aftermath of the merger’s unwinding (which occurred at roughly the same time Andy and Brian unwound their partnership at Bonobos, coincidentally), analysts and participants alike pointed to the schism between the AOL folks down in Virginia and the Time Warner folks up in New York as one of the principal reasons for the company’s failure to find its way through the turbulent waters of the dot-com recession. There was always great talk about “building synergy” between AOL and Time Warner, but in the end that turned out to be an illusory goal. “Some of it was the fights within the company,” Steve Case, AOL’s chairman, told me. “It was a mix of different factors but at the end of the day it’s about people and it’s about teams.”\n\nHacking Capitalism by Söderberg, Johan; Söderberg, Johan;\n\nAbraham Maslow, air gap, Alvin Toffler, AOL-Time Warner, barriers to entry, Charles Babbage, collective bargaining, commoditize, computer age, corporate governance, creative destruction, Debian, deindustrialization, delayed gratification, Dennis Ritchie, deskilling, digital capitalism, digital divide, Donald Davies, Eben Moglen, Erik Brynjolfsson, Firefox, Free Software Foundation, frictionless, full employment, Garrett Hardin, Hacker Conference 1984, Hacker Ethic, Herbert Marcuse, Howard Rheingold, IBM and the Holocaust, informal economy, interchangeable parts, invention of radio, invention of the telephone, Jacquard loom, James Watt: steam engine, jimmy wales, John Markoff, John von Neumann, Joseph Schumpeter, Joseph-Marie Jacquard, Ken Thompson, knowledge economy, knowledge worker, labour market flexibility, late capitalism, Lewis Mumford, liberal capitalism, Marshall McLuhan, means of production, Mitch Kapor, mutually assured destruction, new economy, Norbert Wiener, On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures, packet switching, patent troll, peer-to-peer, peer-to-peer model, planned obsolescence, post scarcity, post-Fordism, post-industrial society, price mechanism, Productivity paradox, profit motive, RFID, Richard Florida, Richard Stallman, Ronald Coase, safety bicycle, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, SETI@home, Silicon Valley, Slavoj Žižek, software patent, Steven Levy, Stewart Brand, subscription business, tech worker, technological determinism, technoutopianism, the Cathedral and the Bazaar, The Nature of the Firm, the scientific method, The Theory of the Leisure Class by Thorstein Veblen, Thomas Davenport, Thorstein Veblen, tragedy of the anticommons, Tragedy of the Commons, transaction costs, Whole Earth Catalog, Yochai Benkler\n\nDistributing censorship and surveillance to Internet Service Providers has one drawback, from the perspective of regulators, in that counterfeiters can hire the services of another company, or set up their own shop. But the options are declining fast since ownership over the network infrastructure is concentrated into ever fewer hands. After a number of mergers, ownership over the cables is for all practical purposes divided up between AT&T and AOL Time Warner. These giants can easily strangle access to a large part of the network and pass decrees down to smaller Internet Service Providers. No less detrimental is their intent to turn the Internet into an interactive cable TV set.49 The next generation of wires would realise this scenario by discriminating the traffic going upstream from the client (user) to the server, while giving priority to traffic going downstream (downloading of data) from server to client.\n\n…\n\nIn WASTE the connections are established between a small circle of people who trust each other from the start and the communication, in most cases consisting of illegally copied files, is heavily encrypted. The law authorities have a very hard time to find out about the infringements taking place in the private network. In the short time that WASTE was made available by Nullsoft the code spread like wildfire in the FOSS community. The whereabouts of the application was put out of reach of AOL Time Warner. After that the plug was finally pulled on Nullsoft. The story about OpenNap, Gnutella and WASTE gives a flavour of what can happen when the means to write algorithms are dispersed among the proletariat. FOSS licenses works in a way similar to the architecture of Gnutella. By decentralising the running of the technology, Gnutella’s authors gave up their control over their creation.\n\n…\n\nIndex Aestethic innovation 64, 68, 177 Adorno, Theodor 65, 70, 168, 191–192

And burst they did, just before the Crash of 2008. In 2007, DaimlerChrysler broke up and Daimler sold Chrysler for a sad $500 million (taking a ‘haircut’ of $35.5 billion on the price it had paid in 1998, lost interest not included). It was a similar story with AOL-Time Warner: by 2007, its Wall Street capitalization had been revised down from $350 billion to $29 billion, and the break-up left both companies reeling. On the other side of the Atlantic, in the other Anglo-Celtic economy that the Europeans had so much admired before 2008, a similar game was unfolding in the City of London.\n\n…\n\nABN-Amro, takeover by RBS, 119–20 ACE (aeronautic–computer–electronics) complex, 83 Acheson, Dean, 68 Adenauer, Konrad, 74 Afghanistan, proposed US invasion, 106–7 Africa: colonization, 79;

This time, no kidding. The Smoking Gun To begin with, the new millennium went according to plan. In January 2000 news broke of the $166 billion merger between AOL, the iconoclastic internet company, and Time Warner, the ‘old media’ blue chip. Time Warner owned stalwarts of American society such as CNN and the HBO, Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated magazines, and the Warner Brothers studios. AOL was less than fifteen years old yet already it had 22 million subscribers. The combination excited the pundits, who thought it would create ‘a globally powerful company that combines old media power and content with new media speed’.32 The merger seemed to confirm the convergence of the new and old economies and fired up enthusiasm for internet stocks still further.\n\n…\n\nThe old economy indices, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones, had already run out of steam in 1999 and by the end of 2001 a full scale bear market had developed. Fortunes were lost and retirement plans hastily revised. In March 2002, barely two years after the market peak, losses totalled $4 trillion. Almost 30 per cent had been wiped off the value of the stock market holdings of 100 million American investors. Events at AOL-Time Warner summed up the extraordinary change in mood. Barely twelve months after the acclaimed epoch-defining merger, the company announced incredible losses of $54 billion for the first quarter of 2002, having been forced to reassess and write down the value of its over-hyped assets.34 The lifeblood of the investment banks dried up as the bear market took hold.\n\n…\n\nShareholders of the buying firms saw their wealth reduced by $240 billion, representing 12 per cent of the purchase price. The wealth destruction was concentrated amongst the biggest equity-financed deals; the bigger the deal, the worse the results.30 Often there was a sharp deterioration in acquirer performance for several years after the deal is done.31 The merger of AOL and Time Warner in 2000 is a case in point. As we saw in Chapter 1, the deal was intended to create a world-class modern media company but instead led to the largest losses in corporate history. Bankers such as the legendary dealmaker Bruce Wasserstein are dismissive of the value-destroying arguments: ‘The problem with many academic studies is that they make questionable assumptions to squeeze untidy data points into a pristine statistical model.’32 But the weight of evidence from the late-twentieth-century merger wave seems to show that the handsome profits made by the selling shareholders were usually offset by subsequent losses for the acquirers.\n\nTelevision Is the New Television: The Unexpected Triumph of Old Media in the Digital Age by Michael Wolff\n\nactivist fund / activist shareholder / activist investor, AOL-Time Warner, barriers to entry, Carl Icahn, commoditize, creative destruction, digital divide, disintermediation, Golden age of television, Great Leap Forward, hiring and firing, Joseph Schumpeter, Marc Andreessen, Mark Zuckerberg, Marshall McLuhan, Michael Milken, Sheryl Sandberg, Silicon Valley, SoftBank, Steve Jobs, Susan Wojcicki, telemarketer, the medium is the message, vertical integration, zero-sum game\n\nThis new breed, less focused on advertising and more focused on fees, and all out of the nascent cable industry, came to control the media business: Jeff Bewkes, CEO of Time Warner; Chase Carey, COO of 21st Century Fox; Sumner Redstone, who built Viacom; Tom Freston, who came out of MTV to run Viacom; Bob Pittman, MTV’s founder, who spearheaded the rise of AOL and its merger with Time Warner, and who now runs Clear Channel; Philippe Dauman, the current CEO of Viacom; and Ted Turner, in many ways the originator of the cable programming model with CNN and the Turner Broadcasting properties. The singular and necessary accomplishment, beyond getting a critical mass of cable companies to carry your station (for a period this resulted in a lot of ownership trade-offs—we’ll carry you, if you give us an ownership stake), was to get a share of the subscription fees.\n\n…\n\nIn other words, Moonves had reinvented broadcast television; a lagging business became a growth industry. Meanwhile, Time Warner, having spun off its own cable company—next to Comcast, the nation’s second largest—became itself an effective pure content play. (It had already jettisoned its music company; it would soon get rid of its troubled AOL division; and it would eventually spin off its magazines.) Time Warner’s essential business became its negotiation with cable operators for HBO, CNN, and the Turner channels. In a remarkable turnaround, Time Warner, which had, not long ago, nearly broken itself with a bet on a digital future, saw its cable fees rise so quickly that, in little more than half a decade following Icahn’s play for the company and his call to streamline it into a pure content play, its share price had doubled (a doubling even without cable, AOL, and publishing—all spun off to the shareholders).\n\n…\n\nA&E Networks, 61, 65, 117 ABC, 183 Abrahamsen, Kurt, 2 Advance Communications, 116, 117 advertising: adjacency strategy of, 59 ad-skipping devices, 49, 84, 96 and audience, 63,
