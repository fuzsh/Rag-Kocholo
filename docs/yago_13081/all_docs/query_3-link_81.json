        "text": "The cult series \"Verbotene Liebe\" (1995-2015, the first) is getting a new edition with \"Verbotene Liebe – Next Generation\" (from November 23 on TVNow). The pre-evening format has given many actors long-term roles. But what happened to the stars after the series ended in 2015?\n\nValerie Niehaus as Julia von Anstetten\n\nThe journey began with her: Valerie Niehaus (46) played Julia von Anstetten for two years from 1995, who experienced the eponymous \"Forbidden Love\" for her brother Jan. After her role in the popular series, Niehaus was able to get hold of a number of roles, including appearances in films from the \"Rosamunde Pilcher\" and \"Inga Lindström\" series and series such as \"Soko 5113\" or \"The Specialists\". Since 2020 she can be seen in the new edition of the children's series \"Pan Tau\".\n\nAndreas Brucker as Jan Brandner\n\nAndreas Brucker (54), who played Julia's brother Jan Brandner, appeared a little less after his \"Forbidden Love\" period. He took on guest appearances in series such as \"Notruf Hafenkante\", \"Alarm für Cobra 11\" or \"Morden im Norden\". Brucker is also on the theater stage and has already appeared in \"Die Feuerzangenbowle\" (2014), among others.\n\nKonrad Krauss as Arno Brandner\n\nThe Brandner family played a role in the series for a long time. Head of the family and building contractor Arno Brandner was embodied from episode one by Konrad Krauss (82), who said goodbye in 2012 after a proud 4140 episodes. After that it became quiet about the actor, who from then on spent his time on the theater stage and in the dubbing studio. In \"Verbotene Liebe\" Arno Brandner stood by his wife Elisabeth von Lahnstein, played by Martina Servatius, for a long time. The actress stayed with \"Verbotene Liebe\" until the end and died in 2016 at the age of 61.\n\nPatrik Fichte as Henning von Anstetten\n\nFor around two and a half years, Patrik Fichte (54) was part of the cast of the previous evening series (2000 to 2002) and played Henning von Anstetten, the last lord of Schloss Friedenau. Fichte then became a popular actor in the romantic TV realm.

In addition to acting, she completed a degree in psychology and graduated with a diploma. After \"Verbotene Liebe\" she had guest appearances in \"Morden im Norden\", \"Heldt\" and \"Alles was geht\". She was recently in front of the camera for \"The Teacher\". It is rumored that she will also be seen in the new edition of \"Verbotene Liebe\".

In addition, she wrote a book that she had not yet finished. When filming the new edition, she was particularly looking forward to seeing her \"nephew\" again.\n\nJo Weil as Oliver Sabel\n\nBecause Jo Weil (43) alias Oliver Sabel is also returning. \"I've been lending Olli my body and my feelings for 21 years now, with interruptions – something like that connects enormously,\" said the actor, looking forward to his comeback in an interview with spot on news.
