        "text": "I wanted to take a few moments and thank all of the people who have supported me in the past year. On April 6th, 2010 I entered my first Photoshop contest at FreakingNews.com. I was immediately hooked and began doing photo-manipulations as fast as I could turn them out. I entered 215 contests, most in less than 6 months. On May 30th, 2010 I attempted my first caricature and entered it into a contest. From that day, I knew what I wanted to do and have been working towards it ever since. I have a long way to go and an enormous amount to learn, but I’m doing what I love. Yes, it's been a good year. I am extremely fortunate to be where I am in such a short period of time. I'm not where I'm headed yet, but I'm on my way. On October 14th, 2010 I started my blog and a Facebook page about the same time. The image below is a jumbled up mess of screen captures with some pretty awesome statistics on my Blog, Facebook, Linkedin etc. and glimpses into a few places I can be found on the web. All achieved in 1 year with your support. Please click the image below to view full.\n\nHere are a few interesting facts about what, with your support, you guys have helped me achieve in 1 year.\n\nMy Blog has 77,300+ hits and 450+ total followers from 152 Nations since October. WOW! I have 1,865+ Facebook Friends in the same period of time. I also just started a Facebook Fan Page in February and it already has 200+ Likes. I have 1,200+ direct business connections at Linkedin, which I just joined on October 31st 2010. I have 400+ DeviantArt.com Followers since August 2010. The support has been incredible. I have been commissioned by Bauer Media Group UK to do 10 Photo-Manipulated Caricature Illustrations for FHM Magazine and Tennis Magazine in the past 4 months. An absolutely unbelievable break for me and so soon. The following are links to some of my online portfolios I’ve built in the past year also with your support:\n\nFacebook Personal Page\n\nFacebook Fan Page\n\nDeviantArt\n\nBehance Network\n\nNetworkedBlogs\n\nTalentHouse\n\nLinkedin\n\nFlickr Photostream\n\nWittygraphy The Caricature Community\n\nISCA\n\nYouTube Channel\n\nMyspace\n\nand about 40 other blogs / portfolios / listings which can be found on my Google Profile.\n\nI owe all of you, my friends a debt of gratitude. I have had tremendous support everywhere I've been and as you can see, accomplished a good bit in 1 year. Thanks so much to all of you who have given me the support and encouragement to push on. I thank you in advance for your continued support as I learn from the masters and grow as an artist. I have met far too many good friends to count along the way and I hope to make many more. Yes, it's been a good year and I am the luckiest man in the world, but 2011 is going to be even better so don't go anywhere.\n\nI hope you enjoyed. Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!\n\nB R A D K U N K L E ~ L I G H T & L E A F\n\n\"Art is the elimination of the unnecessary.\" ~ Pablo Picasso\n\n\"...the mission of the artist in an overtechnologized, overmasculanized society was to call the old magic back to life.\" ~ Tom Robbins, Skinny Legs and All\n\nBorn in rural Pennsylvania, Brad Kunkle spent his younger years exploring and romanticizing the beauty of the sparse countryside and the deep forests around him. From an early age he was drawn to the worlds of Maxfield Parrish and the Pre-Raphaelites --worlds, he says, \"where a subtle, supernatural beauty seems to be hiding under the breath of women --worlds where something beyond our natural perception is waiting to be found.\"\n\nHe studied painting at Kutztown University mostly under George Sorrels, who was taught by a pupil of the 19th century Academic painter, William Adolphe Bougereau. His minimal palette is inspired by the grisailles of early European masters and the haunting quality of antique photographs and daguerreotypes.\n\nAs a decorative painter in his mid twenties, he leafed entire walls in copper. Beguiled by the shifting, life-like nature of the surfaces, Brad began to incorporate gilding in his work, which provided the unreal quality he had been looking for to convey his moody, romantic ideas of human nature and ritual.\n\nBrad's work has appeared on the covers of International Artist and American Art Collector magazine as well as in Fine Art Connoisseur, American Arts Quarterly and Kunst. His world premiere solo exhibition sold out opening night in April of 2010 at Arcadia Fine Arts in New York City.\n\nLIGHT & LEAF ~ The surfaces of these oil paintings are embellished with genuine gold and silver leaf. These precious metals are used as symbolic elements as well as visual instruments to interact with the viewer’s movements and environment. The leafed areas will shift with the intensity of light in a space, or as one simply walks across the room.\n\nNOTE: Please click images for full view\n\nClick below to visit Brad's Web Site:\n\nA R C A D I A F I N E A R T S N e w Y o r k\n\nemail: arcadiafa@aol.com telephone: 212.965.1387\n\nI hope you enjoyed. Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!\n\nI got caught up in a bunch of random stuff today, so I didn't get a caricature done but I did redo my masthead. Actually, an anonymous blog follower pointed out to me that the word “manipulation” was misspelled on the old masthead. I couldn't believe I had done that and it's been almost a year without someone noticing it. Well, it was due for a change anyhow. It was kind of old and drab. There's a reason why I put a picture of what is clearly embedded at the top of my blog. When this post is shared, the top image is selected for the thumbnail that will display so don't worry, you don't have double vision.\n\nI also posted a video below of a collection of my manipulated caricatures completed over a span of the last 6 months of 2010. Can't wait for the 2011 retrospective version. It's going to be a lot better. I have also been busy every day now for the last 2 weeks working on a new video for you. This one is going to be really clean. I'm creating it at 1024 x 768 pixels for high Definition and everything is aspect ratio correct with no cropped images showing blank space on either side. I did a lot of background recreating. I hope to have it done real soon but I'm really putting the fine detail work on this one so I don't want to rush it. I'm going to be in need of some background music that is YouTube copyright proof. Anyone know of any good music, maybe in the Creative Commons category? Anyhow, relax and take a break from your busy schedule and take a look at 2010, my first ever caricatures.\n\nI hope you enjoyed. Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!\n\nTonight I have a manipulated caricature of rapper 50 Cent. The guy gas brutal features, so there were a few different ways I could have taken this one. I came very close to scrapping this one. Nothing seemed to be going right, then I zoomed back to a small thumbnail and I saw what my problem was and was able to correct it. So there's a lesson there. Don't get caught up in the details in the early stages. Take a step back and look at the whole thing. There's plenty of time for details in the end. Not to say this is a flawless caricature. It's far from it and I learned a lot from this one so I'm sure I could do a much better job the second time around. Well, it is what it is. I've posted the original source images below for comparison. I kind of blended the two. There's also a video of 50 Cent performing 21 Questions. It's the only one that wasn't X-rated. I try to keep it clean for this blog.\n\n50 Cent performing 21 Questions\n\nI hope you enjoyed. Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!"
