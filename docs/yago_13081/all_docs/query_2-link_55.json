        "text": "The last few years have seen not only a significant increase in interest in the context and ‘sitedness’ of the artwork from within the museum, the studio and academic writing, but also a number of new undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in related subjects; such as museum studies, curatorial studies, and similar. Miwon Kwon states that “our understanding of site has shifted from a fixed, physical location to somewhere or something constituted through social, economic, cultural and political processes.” Alongside this, and a renewed interest in Bourriaud’s ‘relational aesthetics’ communicated through projects such as the Arnolfini/UWE ‘Situations’ project in Bristol, and the continuing questioning of the role of the studio as the sole originating framework for the interpretation of contemporary art, it seems a pertinent time to be encouraging students to rethink the relationship between artist and audience, artwork and context. The subject of this research is the Curatorial Practices pathway on the new three year BA (Hons) in Fine Art at Plymouth College of Art, and the pedagogical strategies utilised in encouraging Fine Art students to become critically astute practitioners, aware of their practice as ‘situated’ in varying contexts, rather than originating simply from the studio. The focus of this paper is the introductory first year module and how it was delivered in the first year of the programme. Students on this module looked at a range of curatorial practices, including collecting, archiving, exhibiting, writing and emerging modes (from ‘lo-fi’ curatorial strategies to the digital presentation and representation of work/s). However, beyond simply looking at modes of presentation, students were encouraged to question the social and ethical implications of the roles of the curator (or artist/curator). This research not only examines the delivery of ‘Curatorial Practices’ at Plymouth College of Art, but also argues that the consideration of ‘situation’ should be a central aspect of fine art education in the 21st Century.\n\nThe Phd study, completed in 2010, addresses interest in the role of the curator as author and producer, arguing for the value of shifting critical focus away from curating and towards the exhibition. It proposes that, when thought of in terms of knowledge production, exhibitions are actually constituted by the combined activities of artists, curators, institutions and their publics. With reference to three case studies it examines how exhibitions can be understood as sites of collective negotiation of knowledge, and goes on to question the curatorial role in relation to this new understanding. Beginning with the question ‘How do we talk about curating?’ the study observes the development of curatorial discourse since the beginning of the 1990s. Through analysis of this critical development and the frequent announcements of a crisis in curating, it identifies several perennial points of impasse for the development of the exhibition. The study suggests that these have arisen as the result of a professional model bound to a framework of cultural traditions, which have come to define institutional practice at the beginning of the 21st century. In response to this rigid model, the study proposes an alternative in which the field of exhibition making is understood as a dynamic network of influences, where roles and codes of conduct are interchangeable and hierarchical characteristics prone to continual reconstitution. In this way production in the exhibition field is redefined as not only the making of art objects for display, or the forming of art-experiences but also the reception of these. The study looks in detail at three exhibitions that explore ideas of collective and collaborative methods of production, curated by independent curators between 2003 and 2007. It considers to what extent and at what stages curatorial decisions influenced the forming of temporary communities of practice, concluding by identifying what can be learned from exhibitions when they are observed as experiments in the collective negotiation of knowledge.\n\nIt’s all Mediating: Outlining and Incorporating the Roles of Curating and Education in the Exhibition Context brings together thinkers and practitioners in the fields of exhibition curating and gallery education from different corners of Europe. The publication explores the two core functions of museums: exhibiting of the content and educational activities directed to audiences. These areas of activity – both committed to “mediating” between art and its audience – have existed since the birth of the public museum, but, as the result of professionalisation and specialisation of the museum field, they have developed into separate professions and have become the responsibility of specialised staff. “Curator” and “educator” are both relatively new titles in museums, and, in many countries, the professional education for these occupations is young or yet to be established. The publication sets out to encourage dialogue between the sectors. It discusses how the professional field is outlined at present: How do these aspects relate to each other? What is the division of labour between curators and educators and what are the models of collaboration? What kind of interests and values guide their work? It further examines how the specialists incorporate their roles: How are professional identities built? While specialisation has brought focus and quality to the practice, have the fields drifted too far apart from each other? The book is a source of information and insights for anyone working in curating and education, including both practitioners as well as researchers of these fields. With its international span, the book serves the interests of students in the fast growing fields of curatorial studies, museum education, and museology in different parts of Europe. The issues tackled in the book have pertinence also for cultural policy study and research. It’s all Mediating is produced by the Finnish Association for Museum Education Pedaali. Kaija Kaitavuori is a gallery educator, writer and art historian working in Finland and the UK. She worked as the Head of Education at the Contemporary Art Museum Kiasma in Helsinki for ten years. She is a founding member and was the first president of the Finnish Association for Museum Education Pedaali. Laura Kokkonen is an independent art historian, currently pursuing studies in Curating, Managing and Mediating Art at the Aalto University in Helsinki and working in publishing, art criticism and curating. Nora Sternfeld is an educator, writer and curator. She is the Professor for Curating, Managing and Mediating Art at the Aalto University in Helsinki and Co-Director of ecm — educating/curating/managing — master program in Exhibition Theory and Practice at the University of Applied Arts Vienna. She is also a member of trafo.k, the office for art education and critical knowledge production based in Vienna.\n\nWhat might become if teachers were asked to view themselves as curators? And, in turn, in what ways might curatorial work draw attention to how analytic spaces are continuously created as teachers and teacher educators move through pedagogical and research processes? This paper extends an invitation for readers to engage with curatorial impulses (Hofsess, 2015, 2016, forthcoming) and co-curatorial moments (Thiel, forthcoming) as living/aesthetic analysis by remixing a series of constructs and technologies explored by a cohort of preservice teachers. Finding inspiration in Nordstrom’s (2017) antimethodology, the authors grapple with how curating might set up “conditions of possibility” (Barad, 2007) that offer a new way to engage in the theoretical work of qualitative inquiry—a way that begins to invite the student, the art material, the political, the affectual, etc., into the entanglement of theorizing from the start because they were always, already there to begin with."
