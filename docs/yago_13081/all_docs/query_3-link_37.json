        "text": "Err, yeah, I'm guessing people weren't exacting waiting with bated breath for the next woman x woman storyline on Verbotene Liebe, but still... here it is. It tentatively starts next week and will most likey be uploaded to the channel of Mittag1234. You can find the latest news on this forum.\n\nCountess Rebecca von Lahnstein (cousin to the famed Carla von Lahnstein) is a fashion designer. She's part of a large, quirky, messed up aristocratic family. She's quite opinionated, determined to get ahead in the fashion industry and looks good on a motorcylce.\n\nMarlene Wolf is a famed musical singer and the top starlet of Rebecca's music manager brother whom she's also dating. And she reminds me a lot of Caroline from Vampire Diaries back in season 1 (you know, kiddie pool Caroline). She's an adored singer, but can be quite insecure. She's also this walking conundrum where she's both really icy and guarded on one hand and totally open and warm on the other hand and especially passionate when it comes to her family. When she isn't beating up Santa Claus, she's looks great in lingerie.\n\nApril 2nd/3rd: Rebecca helps Marlene get her groove back. In turn, when Rebecca runs late on her assigments Marlene puts in a good word with Rebecca's boss. Rebecca gets hit by a flurry of creative inspiration due to Marlene.\n\nApril 12th/13th: Rebecca can't stop thinking about Marlene. When the model for the swim wear collection drops out Marlene jumps in and while horsing around the pool together Rebecca falls in love with Marlene. Rebecca confides this in her best gay pal Olli, but wants to get Marlene out of her head. When Marlene cancels a meeting with her Rebecca is determined to distract herself... with sexy policewoman Bianca.\n\nApril 26th/April 27th: Rebecca tries to avoid Marlene, but Marlene invites herself to a slumber party. The two end up having a lot of fun and fall asleep in each others arms and Rebecca has to admit to herself that she can't tear Marlene out of her heart after all. Rebecca and Marlene accidentally find out that Marlene's sister and Rebecca's brother want to get married in a private ceremony and get invited. Rebecca catched the bouquet but hands it to Marlene (me: awwwww).\n\nApril 30th/May 2nd/May 3rd: Marlene guesses that Rebecca has a secret crush and sets her up on a date with a dude. It goes about as well as expected. Marlene now knows that Rebecca is into women as well as guys and begins to suspect that she could be the secret crush when she hears Rebecca's description of said crush. Rebecca kisses a sleeping Marlene, is shocked about her actions and takes Bianca up on her offer when she wants to see Rebecca again.\n\nMay 10th/May 11th: Rebecca can't bring herself to come to the grand opening of the club Marlene is opening together with Rebecca's brother, but Marlene finds her and drags her to the party. At the end of the party Marlene drags Rebecca to the dance floor where Rebecca just lets go and wants to party. Rebecca ends up dragging everybody to her place for an after party.\n\nWhen Marlene and Rebecca kiss the world around them disappears for one single precious moment."
