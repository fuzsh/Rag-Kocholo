The dormitory.\n\nDormitory life, to say the least, is often\n\nlively. Underlying the monotony and tension,\n\ninherent in sharing close living quarters is a\n\ngenuine sense of camaraderie. And almost\n\ninvariably there is a sense of wonder. How\n\ndid we survive an entire winter of cold morn-\n\ning showers? How did I get all of those boxes\n\nin here? How did we have so much fun?\n\nWhere did all of the time go?\n\nCertainly one of the advantages of dorm\n\nResidence Hall Living 13\n\nDormacracy cont.\n\nlife other than its economy is a ready-made\n\nsocial life. New surroundings equals new\n\nfaces, new friends.\n\nAll the variables are present for develop-\n\ning good social skills, for learning to commu-\n\nnicate, for learning to work with others, for\n\nlearning the art of compromise. Summit\n\nmeeting are not the only training grounds for\n\ndiplomacy. The dormitory has always beena\n\ncenter of activity, thus, growth.\n\nDormitory (or residence hall as it is often\n\ncalled) flexibility has also grown, changing\n\nwith the times and keeping pace with society.\n\nFifty years ago at East Carolina, there was no\n\ncoed life as we know it. As a matter of fact,\n\nthere were no coeds? as we know them.\n\nAt East Carolina Teachers College in\n\n1933, the heart of the Great Depression,\n\n14 Student Life\n\nboys were considered coeds.? There were\n\napproximately one hundred men and 1000\n\nwomen enrolled. The universitys enrollment\n\nis now over 13,000, and almost 60 percent\n\nare women.\n\nRemarkably, the university is able to house\n\nalmost all who apply for housing in a time\n\nwhen other state universities such as IJNC-\n\nChapel and N.C. State are unable to handle\n\nthe overflow housing requests.\n\nA love/hate relationship exists between\n\nstudents and dormitory life; it remains a mat-\n\nter of personal preference, of style. Undeni-\n\nably, ones dormitory experience is a unique,\n\npersonal one, yet shared.\n\nToo often, perhaps, dorm life is placed in\n\ncomparison with Greek life. This comparison\n\nusually finds life in the high rise falling short\n\nof the family unity found with Greeks. There\n\nis a brotherhood for dormies,? however, if\n\n.\n\nonly a silent one, increasing its volume with\n\nevery gathering.\n\nCramped in close quarters and sharing a\n\nbathroom with 40 others does lead to fam-\n\nily? unity. Maybe not the type found with\n\nGreeks, but unity nonetheless. Nor was it the\n\nunity found at home. But it had to suffice,\n\nbecause the dorm was home, at least, until,\n\nMay when perspiring armies once again in-\n\nvade Greenville. Mf\n\nWITH THE COST of eating out rising daily, many\n\nresidents increased the amount of food they cooked in\n\nthe room. By sharing a meal with several others prices\n\nand work was cut.\n\nTHE FIRST JOB for many new students was the deco-\n\nration of their dorm room. Students bought everything\n\nfrom posters to fishnets in order to liven up their new\n\nhomes.\n\nORIGINALITY counted for a lot when planning meals\n\nin the dorm. Residents tired of eating food cooked in a\n\ntoaster oven or ona hot plate could ~cook out ona grill or\n\nhibachi.\n\nWHEN SPACE becomes a real problem many residents\n\ntake to the halls to find the necessary room. Students not\n\nwishing to sit in the halls could use the lobby areas for\n\nwork or entertainment purposes.\n\nWilliams\n\nBaines\n\nResidence Hall Living 15\n\nje)\n\nTa\n\nwid\n\n~~\n\n&\n\nje)\n\nho\n\na\n\n+\n\nYN\n\nOo\n\n=\n\nPatterson\n\nProviding everything from a social life to room and board, the various\n\ncampus ministries were to many students\n\nFamily Ties\n\nby Patrick ONeéill\n\nhe Rev.

These are just a\n\nfew examples of what life is like for students\n\nparticipating in some of the many denomina-\n\ntions of campus ministry groups at ECU. The\n\ncampus ministry groups also include the\n\nMethodist group, which is led by Rev.

Bob Clyde.\n\nEach campus ministry program has its own\n\nhistory for each was founded at different\n\ntimes. But all of them have provided the\n\nsame special kind of religious continuity for\n\nthe college student who is away from his or\n\nher own hometown for the first time.\n\nThe groups usually meet on a weekly basis\n\nfor a worship service, a program or meeting,\n\nand a shared meal. Campus ministries also\n\nmake themselves available for counseling or\n\nother advisory needs of the students. Sister\n\nShondell offers a special military counseling\n\nfor draft-age men, who, for reasons of con-\n\nscience, may have doubts about being part of\n\nthe military.\n\nResnick views campus ministry as a way\n\nfor students to continue their homelife on\n\ncampus. It gives students feelings that their\n\nroots havent been uprooted,? Resnick said.\n\nIt gives them an opportunity to maintain reli-\n\ngious traditions away from home.\n\n_\n\naa af\n\nTHE CATHOLIC NEWMAN CENTER used several\n\nmethods to deliver its message.

Hadden has also used\n\nhis experience as a Greenville City Council\n\nmember to get more students involved in the\n\naffairs of local government.\n\nThe Catholic Newman Center, The Meth-\n\nodist Student Center, and The Baptist Stu-\n\ndent Union are places where all students,\n\nregardless of their religious preference, are\n\nwelcome.\n\nAll of the centers serve as meeting places\n\nfor activities and provide for other needs such\n\nas a quiet place to study, listen to music, or\n\nwatch a soap opera.\n\nCampus ministries are a continuation of\n\nchurch life in accordance with higher educa-\n\ntion,?

Shondell claims. I feel that\n\ncampus ministry provides a place and people\n\nfor exploration of these important areas.\n\nCampus ministry also challenges young peo-\n\nple to grow beyond their own concerns to the\n\nbigger concerns of the world, the poor, and\n\nothers less fortunate than themselves,? con-\n\ntinued Shondell.\n\nAll of the campus ministries work from a\n\nfaith into action? perspective. Many of the\n\ngroups work together on service projects to\n\naid the poor and provide comfort for the less\n\nfortunate.\n\nSeveral of the ministries sponsored group\n\ntrips to Washington, D.C. and New York City\n\nwhere students were given the opportunity to\n\nexperience the work of people who provide\n\nhelp for the poor in those areas. Shondells\n\ngroup has worked each year helping organize\n\nevents designed to educate ECU students\n\nabout the problem of world hunger.

While students of\n\n1983 were more concerned\n\nwith jobs than social issues as\n\nin the 1960s and the era of\n\nMartin Luther King, the per-\n\nvasive threat of nuclear war\n\nwas a major topic of concern,\n\nand a nonviolent means of\n\nachieving lasting peace was a\n\nconstant, if distant, hope for\n\nAmericans.\n\nMrs. King, president of the\n\nAtlanta-based Martin Luther\n\nKing Jr. Center for Nonviolent\n\nSocial Change, spoke of the\n\nliving legacy? of her hus-\n\nband, and of the methods that\n\nMEMBERS OF THE East Carolina\n\nConcert Band perform in their Spring\n\nConcert.

Bar-\n\nbee confessed to skipping her art classes the\n\nday of the ball to sew up her costume.\n\nMany of the costumes reflected the new\n\nwave? image that swept the country the past\n\nyear.

Mf\n\nA CELEBRATION on the infield re-\n\nminded everyone that the St. Louis\n\nCardinals had defeated the Milwau-\n\nkee Brewers to win the World Series.\n\nWide World\n\nWimbleton Gives No Surprises\n\nby Pattrick ONeill\n\nor tennis fans it seems\n\ntheres never a break in\n\nf the action. They play\n\non grass, clay, artificial sur-\n\nfaces, indoors and out, all\n\nyear long, all over the world,\n\none tournament after an-\n\nother. But when mid-summer\n\nrolls around every tennis fan\n\nin the world knows that THE\n\ntournament is being played.\n\nWimbleton is the sight and the\n\ngames best are always there.\n\nNineteen eighty three was no\n\nexception.\n\nThirty nine year old Billie\n\nJean King swatted her way to\n\nthe semi-finals one more time,\n\nand 12th seeded South Kore-\n\nan Kevin Curren blasted a to-\n\ntal of 80 aces on his way to the\n\nsemis. Both players were part\n\nof the excitement that makes\n\nWimbleton number one, but\n\nwhen the final shots were\n\nslammed and the titles deter-\n\nmined there were no sur-\n\nprises.\n\nControversial hot head\n\nJohn McEnroe and consistent\n\nMartina Navratilova took\n\nhome the singles title. Both\n\nlater combined with Pat Flem-\n\ning and Pam Shriver respec-\n\ntively adding the doubles\n\ncrowns to the bootys.\n\nMcEnroe beat unseeded\n\nChris Lewis to easily take the\n\nmens title for the second\n\ntime, while Navratilova won\n\neven more decisively beating\n\nAndrea Jaeger 6-0, 6-3 for\n\nher fourth Wimbleton crown.\n\nLets face it, this was a\n\ngreat opportunity for me to\n\nwin easily,? said a true-to-\n\nform McEnroe after his victo-\n\nry. This guy wasnt Borg or\n\nConnors. But its not my fault\n\nhe got to the finals.?\n\nEverybody took the big\n\nguns out for me,? said Navra-\n\ntilova. But when it was all over\n\nNavratilova only needed an\n\naverage of 47 minutes per\n\nmatch in seven matches to\n\ntake the crown. She lost just\n\n25 games. #\n\n60 Student Life\n\nPROTESTING THE FIRST insea-\n\nson strike by the National Football\n\nLeague, these sport fans demonstrat-\n\ned . in hopes of starting the season.\n\nWide World\n\n| Cardinals Fly High\n\nby Pattrick ONeill\n\nWide World\n\nineteen sixty eight\n\nwas great year for\n\nbaseball. After an ex-\n\nciting season, the Tigers of\n\nDetroit and the Cardinals of\n\nSt. Louis squared off in a\n\nWorld Series that stands out\n\nas one of historys best. Going\n\ninto the fifth game, the de-\n\nfending World Champion Car-\n\ndinals held a three games to\n\none and looked like a cinch to\n\nreturn their title, but Detroits\n\nhot pitchers brought the Ti-\n\ngers three sucessive wins and\n\nthe Cardinals were de-\n\nthroned.\n\nAfter that defeat, the Car-\n\ndinals would not be heard\n\nfrom in post-season play for\n\n14 years. But they returned in\n\n1982 with an exciting seventh\n\ngame World Series victory\n\nover the Milwaukee Brewers\n\n~and return to glory.\n\nTrailing 3-1 after 5 and a\n\nhalf innings in the seventh and\n\ndeciding game, the Cardinals\n\nrallied for 5 runs while Cardi-\n\nnal ace relief man Bruce Sut-\n\nter held the Brewers hitters in\n\nthe eighth and ninth for his\n\nsecond series save.\n\nCardinal catcher Darrell\n\nPorter led St. Louis well-bal-\n\nanced offensive attack. Por-\n\nter, with his 8 hits and 5 RBIs,\n\nplayed a major role in three of\n\nthe Cardinal wins. For his ef-\n\nforts, he took the series MVP\n\nin a tightly-balloted vote over\n\nSutter.\n\nThe Brewers had nothing of\n\nwhich to be ashamed. In 1968\n\nthey were not yet an estab-\n\nlished team \" in 1982, they\n\nknocked off the strong chal-\n\nlenge from the Baltimore Ori-\n\noles to win the American\n\nLeague east on the final day\n\nof the regular season. In the\n\nplayoffs, they went to the fifth\n\ngame to beat the powerful\n\nCalifornia Angels. Team lead-\n\ner and American League\n\nMVP Robin Young led the\n\nBrewers with 12 hits and 6\n\nRBIs batting .414 for the Se-\n\nries. Because of their power-\n\nful hitters, the Brewers were\n\npicked easy winners over the\n\nCardinal team. But the Red-\n\nbirds remembered 1968 and\n\nhung on for a sweet victory.\n\nTo reach their plateau, the\n\nCardinals had to beat 1982s\n\nCinderella team, the Atlanta\n\nBraves. They took the play-\n\noffs in three straight for the\n\npennant.\n\nNewsline 61\n\nf\n\nSwansboros 200th anniversary celebration led the\n\nUnderwater Archeology Summer Field Team to the town\n\nin search of\n\nSigns From The Past\n\nby Stuart Morgan\n\nCUs Underwater Ar-\n\nchaeology Summer\n\nField team, including\n\nprospective graduate stu-\n\ndents from across the nation,\n\nhelped solve a riddle this sum-\n\nmer during Swansboros\n\n200th Anniversary Celebra-\n\ntion. For nearly 50 years, Bur-\n\nwell Jackson has been curious\n\nabout resin, ballast stones,\n\nand exposed logs littering the\n\npromontory of land in front of\n\nhis house at Deer Island along\n\nWhite Oak River. I never\n\nhad any idea what it was,?\n\nJackson admitted when refer-\n\nring to the area, but I thought\n\nit was a ramp of some type \"\n\npossibly used for pulling out\n\nlogs.?\n\nUnder the joint sponsorship\n\nof ECU and Swansboros bi-\n\ncentinnial committee, eight\n\nstudents participated in a four\n\nweek summer field school at\n\nSwansboro. A large portion of\n\ntheir time was spent investi-\n\ngating the Deer Island site, lo-\n\ncated across from Swans-\n\nboros harbor. The material on\n\nJacksons property may have\n\nbeen associated with the bu-\n\nsinesses that once existed on\n\nthe now-quiet island. In fact,\n\nsometime during the past 200\n\nyears, the following busin-\n\nesses once operated there: A\n\nboatyard, naval stores manu-\n\nfacturer, steam-powered saw-\n\nmill, and saltworks. The stu-\n\ndents were able to solve many\n\nquestions concerning the his-\n\ntoric site.\n\nAccording to Andrea Heint-\n\nzelman, who participated in\n\nthe field school, the material\n\nin front of Jacksons house pri-\n\nmarily indicated an extant\n\nwharf. The fact that some of\n\nthe exposed timbers indicated\n\nwooden trunnel fastenings\n\n(predating late 19th and 20th\n\ncentury metal fastenings) also\n\nsuggested its early construc-\n\ntion. As a graduate student in\n\nAmerican Universitys ap-\n\nplied anthropology program\n\nin Washington, D.C., Heintzel-\n\nman is studying the building\n\ntechnology of wharf construc-\n\ntion, particularly of the colo-\n\nnial period.\n\nThe reason for looking at\n\nthe wharf was to provide a\n\ngood comparative example to\n\nothers that have been exc"
