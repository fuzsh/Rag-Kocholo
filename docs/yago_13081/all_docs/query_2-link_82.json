Whitney (secretary; dog breeder). Whitney sent his 1934 book 'The Case for Sterilization' to Hitler, for which he received a congratulatory note. The book of his colleague Madison Grant had an even greater effect on Hitler.1922 Lucis Trust\n\nOriginally named Lucifer's Trust. In the 1980s Robert McNamara was repeatedly named as a member/director by Lyndon Larouche's group, which also talked to representatives of the trust. Of course, Larouche's groups tend to be rather cultic and skimpy when it comes to providing physical evidence, but they seldom - if ever - make up memberships. Lucis Trust has refused to answer this author regarding any questions about past directorships or financial support, but looking at this list of conservation-linked NGOs it would be almost strange if Robert M., Maurice S. and the Rockefeller Fdn. haven't been involved to a degree.1922 Central Selling Organization\n\nDe Beers diamond cartel. Oppenheimer family controlled.1934 Pioneer Fund\n\nFounding directors: Wickliffe Preston Draper | Harry Laughlin | Frederick Osborn. Other directors: John M. Woolsey, Jr. | Charles Codman Cabot.

Atlantic Richfield of Robert O. Anderson is known to have given $30,000 to the Sierra Club Federation in 1979-1980. The Rockefeller Family Fund, of which David Rockefeller is the honorary trustee, makes annual donations between $25,000 to $55,000 to the Sierra Club Foundation, even today. Trustees generally hold mid-level positions in larger companies or control less important corporations.\n\nImportant: executive director David Brower left in protest in 1969 after clashes about opposition to nuclear energy (Brower did not support it). That same year he founded Friends of the Earth with $200,000 of Robert Anderson money.\n\nAlso: Steven Greer has lectured the Sierra Club.1960 African Wildlife Foundation\n\nFounders: Russell Train | Kermit Roosevelt, Jr. | Arthur Windsor Arundel.

Began with a group of Canadian protestors who protested against a bomb test at Amchitka island, Alaska. One of the participants was Jim Bohlen, a Sierra Club member frustrated with the club's lack of action against nuclear bomb tests. Journalist Ben Metcalfe was another among the board members and was part of the small group that continued protests against French atmospheric nuclear tests at Mururoa. He became the Greenpeace Foundation's first chairman. Metcalf left when focused shifted from anti-nuclear protesting to anti-whaling actions.\n\nSignificant contributors since at least the mid-1990s include: Rockefeller Brothers Fund | Ted Turner Foundation | John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation | Charles Stewart Mott Foundation | David and Lucile Packard Foundation | John Merck Fund. Grants anywhere from $30,000 to $450,000 were provided for specific projects.

The founding was financed by Rockefeller Brothers Fund, heaved by Laurance Rockefeller from 1958 to 1980. Worldwatch launched the State of the World reports in 1984. In later years millions have been received from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Ted Turner Foundation and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation.1974 Population Resource Center (PRC)\n\nAt various times financed by the Ford Fdn., Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the John D. and Catherine T.

James Garrison (co-founder) | Daniel Sheehan (co-founder). Exposed the Iran-Contra drug trafficking scandal for State Department friends George Shu1tz and John C. Whitehead, as well as secretary of defense Caspar W. Weinberger. William Casey and conservative McCarthyites, as well as CIA friens as Ted Shackley, had become too influential on Reagan at the time. In addition, Garrison was close to Condi Rice.1980 Esalen Institute's Soviet-American Exchange Program\n\nJames Garrison (founder). Allowed him to meet with top Soviet leaders and brought over Yeltsin to the United States. Largely responsible for the top level connections of Garrison.1980 International Association for Near Death Studies (IANDS)\n\nCol.

Global advisory council, launched in 2013: Theodore Roosevelt IV (chair) | Jonathan Lash (president).1982 American Water Development, Inc.\n\nPrivate company looking to exploit a giant water reservoir underneath the San Luis Valley, raising worries that it would turn the valley into a desert. Major conflict of interest, especially with the 1998 World Water Commission. Maurice Strong (founder and chair) | William Ruckelshaus (director)1986 Manitou Foundation, Baca Ranch, San Luis Valley\n\nFounders: Maurice Strong and Laurance Rockefeller. Also involved: Steven Greer (Baha'i follower who organized CSETI UFO contact trainings at the Baca Ranch and surrounding areas from at least 1993 to 1998, in the same period he was cooperating with Laurance on UFO disclosure). It's a remote spiritual retreat center at the Sangro de Cristo mountains where many world religions have one or two representatives. The location is known for its past UFO activity and for being the first location where cattle mutilations were reported (1967, Snippy case). There appears to be a lot of gnostic symbolism involved and the retreat seems to have a lot in common with the globalist ideas of the Baha'i Faith, which in turn is completely, one hundred percent compatible with the United Nations ideas on world government.1988 Human Potential Foundation (HPF)\n\nC. B. Scott Jones (president; six year special assistant to Sen. Pell) | Claiborne Pell | Laurance Rockefeller (financier to the tune of $700,000) | Hans Adam II von Liechtenstein | John Mack (abduction researcher who received $200,000 from HPF).\n\nHelped finance the Center for Treatment and Research of Experienced Anomalous Trauma (TREAT) conferences on abductions and other paranormal phenomena.

John Alexander, a friend of Stubblebine and Hans Adam) | Budd Hopkins (close friend of Hans Adam; both tried to find out details of the alleged alien kidnapping of UN secretary general Javier Perez de Cuellar) | Lyn Buchanan (remote viewer).\n\nL. Rockefeller financed John Mack's 1993 Program for Extraordinary Experience Research (PEER), an alien abductee support group which laid the groundwork for Mack's 1994 best-selling book 'Abduction: Human Encounters with Aliens'. Allegedly provided Mack with $250,000 annually in the early 1990s.\n\nColin Andrews: The premier British crop circle researcher (and certainly in recent years a believer in a global warming armageddon) was financed by Laurance R. in the late 1990s. Already in 1992 Greer accompanied Andrews, doing meditation experiments.\n\n1995 HPF conference: John Mack | Zecharia Sitchin (According to Richard Hoagland on Coast to Coast AM, I believe with Sitchin critic Mike Heiser, Sitchin had an office at Rockefeller Plaza. Hoagland was discussing his/their experiences with Sitchin.)1989 Intruders Foundation\n\nBudd Hopkins (founder and executive director) | Hans Adam II von Liechtenstein (financier).

Anderson (media consultant) | Cathy Del Grosso (forensic psychologist) | Sal Amendola (comic book artist with DC Comics)\n\n1992: Intruders movie. Running time: 2 hours and 40 minutes. Budd Hopkins is played by Richard Crenna. Several reasonable well known actors appear in this very television movie.\n\nJune 13-17, 1992: MIT Abduction Study Conference: Hans Adam and Robert Bigelow (financiers) | Dr. David Pritchard (chair). Participants: John Mack | David Jacobs | Budd Hopkins | Thomas Bullard | John Carpenter | David Gotlib | Richard Hall | Pam Kasey | Joe Nyman | Mark Rodeghier | Walter Webb.

Petersen (founder and chair) | Woolsey (director) | Napier Collyns (director) | Joe Firmage (director; UFO cultist) | Catherine Austin Fitts (black budget critic; invited to a meeting she said was in part about aliens living among us) | linked to Coast to Coast AM show and Steven Greer (UFOs). Hal Puthoff (speech)1989 Fund for UFO Research Roswell conference, Washington, D.C.\n\nHeld at the Smithsonian. Heads of FUFOR: Don Berliner and Bruce Maccabee. Financiers of the conference: Hans Adam II von Liechtenstein and Robert Bigelow. Brought together numerous witnesses of the 1947 Roswell crash. Interviews with the witnesses leads to the video 'Recollections of Roswell', which appears to be good for the most part - except for the questionable San Agustin crash witnesses. Bigelow was involved in financing part of the research into that aspect of the crash, as a picture can be seen in Stanton Friedman's book 'Crash at Corona' of Bigelow and Friedman looking out over the San Agustin plains.1990 International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD)\n\nMaurice Strong (long-time distinguished fellow)1990 Turner Foundation\n\nSame group of family members as the Captain Planet Foundation.1990 Captain Planet Foundation\n\nBased on the cartoon 'Captain Planet and the Planeteers' of 1990-1996, co-developed by Ted Turner. Directors: Laura Turner Seydel (president and chair) | Rutherford Seydel (secretary) | Beau Turner (married into the Hunt family of Dallas) | Rhett Turner | Teddy Turner. The foundation had some challenging periods, but was relaunched at Earth Day Kids Fest in 2003.1991 International Foreign Policy Institute (IFPI)\n\nCo-founders: James Garrison | Eduard Shevardnadze | George Shultz1991 Rio Earth Summit\n\nMaurice Strong | Gorbachev | Ruud Lubbers | Queen Beatrix of Orange1992 World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)\n\nMaurice Strong (advisory council) | Dr. Stephan Schmidheiny | Bertrand Collomb (chair)1992 Earth Council Alliance (ECA)\n\nFounding members: Maurice Strong | Ruud Lubbers | Robert McNamara | Javier Perez de Cuellar | Desmond Tutu | Princess Basma bint Talal of Jordan | Jonathan Lash.1992 Gorbachev Foundation/USA\n\nJames Garrison (founder and president). Paul Dietrich (founding trustee).1992 Green Cross International (GCI)\n\nMembers: Gorbachev (founding president) | Shimon Peres | Ruud Lubbers | Javier Perez de Cuellar | Ted Turner | Princess Basma bint Talal of Jordan | Robert Redford.1993 Rockefeller Initiative on UFO disclosure\n\nLaurance Rockefeller (prime mover). White House: Bill Clinton (on April 14, 1993 Laurance meets Clinton at the White House over the issue) | Jack Gibbons (White House scientist briefed by Rockefeller and C. B. Scott Jones on the subject) | John Podesta (Clinton's assistant and later chief of staff; spoke out publicly in favor of disclosure) | Webster Hubbell (Clinton's associate attorney general; looked into UFOs and JFK, but got nothing).\n\nRound table discussion at the JY Ranch: representatives from Gibbons office | Richard Farley | Laurance Rockefeller | Henry Diamond | C. B. Scott Jones | John Mack | Dr. Bruce Maccabee | Leo Sprinkle | Linda Moulton Howe | Steven Greer | Keith Thompson. Bill and Hillary Clinton were also been guests of Laurance at the ranch.\n\nEventually Laurance Rockefeller and the president back off, apparently fearing repurcussions. The only thing published is 'UFO's: The Best Available Evidence', at different times funded by Laurance Rockefeller, Robert Bigelow and Joe Firmage.1993-1996 Disclosure Project\n\nDr. Steven Greer (founder and CEO) | Daniel Sheehan (long-time lawyer to the project and witness) | Laurance Rockefeller (limited financial supporter) | Mary and Evan Galbraith (cooperated with Greer for some time in the 1990s in writing 'UFO's: The Best Available Evidence' - until they had a falling out).\n\nExamples of witnesses used:\n\n- Dr. Fred Bell (listed as \"Dr. B.\". Not mentioned: new age guru, Pleiadean contactee who believes in reptilians, that Greys eat humans dissolved in acid, that no plane hit the WTC and that 2012 was going to be the end of the world)\n\n- Jim Dilettoso (identity kept hidden, but reported as being reliable. Not mentioned: murky past and known UFO cultist. George A. Hormel II, owner of the Wrigley Mansion, invested in Dilettoso's projects.)\n\n- James Angleton, Jr. (Greer has hinted that this person gave him information. Not mentioned: Reportedly no relationship to the CI chief. However, he is an AFIO leader with the nation's CIA covert operations establishment - with people who would absolute have no interest in releasing classified information)\n\n- Sergeant Robert O. Dean, backed by L. Rockefeller and Claiborne Pell in Congress in 1996, became an important Disclosure Project witness (talking about \"ACIO\" and 20-something levels about top secret), but these days talks about Annunaki and reptilians to anyone who wants to hear it. In addition, an interested and moderate NATO historian rationally debunked papers he provided as being fake.\n\n- Gordon Creighton and Lord Admiral Hill-Norton are presented as reliable. In fact, both have viewed the abduction subject as being done by demons. Already in the 1970s Creighton was warning that people \"have been carried off and ... certainly haven't come back again.\" Already back then Creighton promoted an author who in turn inspired Erich von Daniken.\n\nWithout naming their names directly, Greer has claimed that General Albert Stubblebine and Colonel John Alexander have tried to recruit him into a cell that has infiltrated the civilian UFO community. Those who watched the Hans Adam-financed movie 'Intruders' can see that the same thing happened to Budd Hopkins (by an actor who plays a general who looks like the twin brother of Gen. Stubblebine).\n\nMentioned by Greer as not having any inside knowledge:\n\n1) General Patrick Hughes, DIA director 1996-1999, who has a major special operations background but is far from an elitist.\n\n2) Adm. Thomas R. Wilson, J-2 intelligence chief for the joined chiefs and DIA head 1999-2002.\n\nMentioned by Greer as having inside knowledge on the subject (true or not, he spoke to these people or persons close to them): George Shultz | the Bechtel family | David Rockefeller | Peter Peterson | Maxwell Rabb | Claiborne Pell | the Rothschild family | Pehr Gyllenhammar (indirect, but controlled Volvo until the early 1990s) | Hans Adam | Adm. Harry Train | Adm. Bobby Ray Inman. Also: Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld (warned against their re-election in 2004 and that these individuals have direct knowledge of these topics - then again, Greer is politically hundred percent in line with men as Al Gore and Maurice Strong).\n\nInteresting observation: Greer most definitely had a dinner party in 1993 with then-sitting CIA director James Woolsey (who was never allowed to meet president Clinton one-on-one) and John Petersen and their wives on the subject. The participants in the dinner disagree, however, with Greer's account of it. Greer claimed the CIA director was almost in tears that he wasn't told anything about the subject. The other participants, claim, however, that they were just politely listening to his views, but did not necessarily believe in them. Strangely, James W. has incredibly deep ties to the defense industry, the liberal and conservative establishment, and the Navy at the highest levels. If he doesn't know anything about the subject, then pretty much no one does.1993 State of the World Forum conferences\n\nJames Garrison (founder, chair and president) | Daniel Sheehan (founder).

Since C2C is a show on UFOs and the paranormal, what's the purpose of bringing Finkbeiner on if there's no focus on these topics? And why would Finkbeiner target the conspiracy community if she wants to be taken seriously?)1995 National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS)\n\nRelatively low-profile UFO/paranormal investigation institute that often didn't share its research with the public.
