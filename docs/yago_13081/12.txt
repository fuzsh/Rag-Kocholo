Sebastian von Lahnstein is a lawyer and the second eldest son of Ludwig von Lahnstein. He was married to Lydia Brandner before marrying Tanja von Lahnstein, whom he also has a daughter with, Emma von Lahnstein. During his marriage to Lydia, Sebastian also had a one-night-stand with Lydia's mother Katja Brandner, which resulted in a child, Christina Brandner, who was then raised by Lydia's father Matthias Brandner and his new wife Nathalie Brandner. In February 2012 Christina had gotten really sick, and after being disappointed by Tanja for not trusting him, he decided to go visit her daughter in Auckland for a while.
