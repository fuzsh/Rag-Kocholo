        "text": "Lesson Info\n\nThe Future is Faster Than You Think with Peter Diamandis\n\nHello and good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening. Wherever you are in the world, in whatever you're doing right now, I want to interrupt that programming to welcome you to the Chase Drivers live. Show you on Creativelive. I'm your host, your friend, your pal Chase Jarvis. And excited to sit down with, ah, very special guest today.

Rather the X Prize Foundation, which leads world in designing and operating large scale incentive comp...\n\netitions, and the executive founder of Singularity University, something I've always long admired. We're very excited to have him today, so please give a warm creativelive welcome wherever you are in the world Clapping, tapping, high fiving Uh, welcome to the show. Thanks for thanks for coming in with us. A good morning pellets. Morning. Where we are right now. It is indeed we're on the west coast of United States. And ah, very happy to have you on the show. Obviously, we are in crazy times. Uh, the fact that you are our guest and you have done so much great thinking writing, publishing around areas of mindset, of scaling great ideas of Learning Cove in 19 Therapeutics diagnostics, longevity These were all things that are It's like your whole world is coming to us the tip of the spear right now. So I'm, you know, despite all of the pain in the world right now, my heart goes out there. But I'm having an extraordinary blast, A meaning. It's like I'm a kid in a candy store of a nine year old kid who was like, Holy, Can I say Holy shit. Yes. You could say anything you want. Amazing. It's like it was like, Oh, my God is, like, so much happening. So much potential, so much extraordinary ability to Teoh create, reinvent, solved um, it's it's extraordinary. Has never been like this. Yeah. Never, ever. And all as you said, um, all of this the unrest, Um, all of the, um, struggles and strife and challenges all of those air just there. There, opportunities presenting themselves for complete reinvention and transformation. And when I, um, you know, I've read all of your books. Stephen Cotler, longtime friend that has costed those books with you, but on the show before, Um and so your name has been on this show many times to somebody you personally not being here is you've had many stand ins. Uh, and I particularly went one thread through point for so much of your work to me, is this positivity in mindset? And in fact, if I had my act together, I would have your twitter feed it in front of because you tweeted something. Think this morning used about this opportunity to create and, you know, co create and reinvent so much right now, and mindset is at the foundation of that. So I'm hoping you can start off our discussion today with the role that mindset plays not just in your work, but in the advice that you give to others. I think mindset is everything. It's everything. It is the single most important thing that differentiates success from failure, from having a blast in life to being in the depths of despair. And let's be clear, right, unless you're manic all the time. We all have ups and downs, but it's having the right mindset. Helps you part the clouds and see that guiding star I'm You know, I spend a lot of time with my different communities, my abundance, community singularity, community X prize community, my future community. And ultimately, what I say to people is, um, if you took away everything from Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, everything but kept their mindset, uh, they would rebuild and recreate much of what they had, because it really is a matter of how do you see the world when you see challenges or opportunities, how do you react to them? And I think that's really important. And I think one thing that people ask me, said Peter, we have you always had that that positive abundance and exponential mindset, and the answer is no. You contend towards that trend towards it have have some bias is towards it. But I built this one step at a time by deciding what I want to let into my brain. Like you know who you hang out with, the posters on your wall. What you spend your time on all of that molds your brain, right? Our brains are 100 billion neurons, 100 trillion synaptic connections, and it's his massive neural net, and it's shaped by your experiences. And so if you want to, you know, you know this. People say if you want toe, if you're overweight, you want to become skinny, hang out with skinny people. If you're not in shape, hang out with people who are in good shape and those you know, you're the average of of the people you spend the most time with. So what do you let into your mind? Um, that's really important. Can you share with us some of the ways that you actively program that? I mean, you gave some Some, uh, I would call him, uh, riel, but also very simple examples. Posters on your wall who you hang out with. But let's dig one level deeper into Peter's world. Yeah, so happily, I mean, and there's nothing I would talk about. I avoid politics and sports, but otherwise I'm good. Um, eso first of all, I didn't get here in one fell swoop, right? And so nobody. If you're in the beginning of your journey, give yourself permission to get their incrementally one step at a time. Small leaves here and there. But I'm really lucky by virtue of the crowd that I've cultivated. Who? My brothers, my sisters, My dearest friends. Uh, and it's like I'm always looking to hang out with people who up my game who stretch me, who inspire me who allow me to inspire them. I think it's life is a matter of what you give, not what you get right. And if people are open to that inspiration, your work here, a case in point. Um, So, uh, the X Prize Foundation, which is organization I founded God. It's hard to believe 25 years ago now. Wow. Yeah, it's good. Wow, if you ask me, I said 10 maybe crazy 25 years ago, but look great, by the way, for your head. Listen, I'm a nine year old kid in my body and and I'm shooting for 700 year lifespan. We could talk about that later, but, uh, I'm the X Prize and the 100 incredible people who work there and the in the millions of people who support our work. It's good x prize dot org's alone. Learn more. We flip the conversation and say, How do you solve that problem? Not? Can it be solved? Every I believe that every single problem on the planet can be solved by the convergence of the right mindset, the right technology and capital. And so it's How do you solve it, right? Not not. Um And when can you get itself? Not if can you get itself. So that's that singular university. Um, uh, my blog's I put out. You know, if you had a demand is dot com I put out a block every every week, which is focused on on the abundance mindset and exponential mindsets. Um, you know one thing I was just mentioned to you in the beginning. I actually I'm so angry at the news media, Um, because the news media in my mind, you know, I call CNN the Crisis News Network with a constantly negative news network I don't have a good acronym for Fox yet. Um, but you know what? That first letter is gonna be the Oh, yeah, with you there. Um and, uh, you got my brain going. Sorry. Uh, so but if you think about it, right, there's somebody in the newsroom or an editor at the newspaper who is like, deciding what you're going to see. And our brains evolved on the savannahs of Africa hundreds of thousands millions of years ago. Back then, if you missed a piece of good news Too bad Mr Piece of Bad News. Your genes were out of the gene pool, and so we evolved in ancient piece for a temporal lobe called the Mega Lo that scans everything. Everything we see in here for negative news. And if we see a piece of negative use, it puts us on red alert. And so we pay 10 times more attention to negative musing, positive views. So if you open a newspaper or watch any news network, it's 10 to 1 negative to positive. And the question to ask yourself is at the way the world really is. Is it all just negative news? Or is that a selection bias, and I believe it's selection. Bias is amazing use out there, but new good news networks don't succeed. So three years ago, I sent out on a journey to reinvent how I get my news, how I get my information. I built a company. We just are rolling it out now. In two beta, it's called a few down. Yeah, future L O P future loop dot com and what it does is it actually scans all the news around the world. Science journals, social media, newspapers, magazines, everything and it It looks at it, and it rates everything from the quality than used to news. Biased Teoh positive. So semantic. Is it a positive, forward looking piece or is it a negative piece? And then it's looking for convergence of technologies is like Is this news piece looking at how AI and robotics and three D printing are coming together and how it focuses on industries or interest So you can put in any subject like clothing or ceramics or, you know, painting whatever you want, and we'll tell you how how that industry is being reinvented by technology in abundance and exponential mindset, and then We also created some fascinating things that create a version of avatars. Um, so you can. We are able to create avatars of Elon Musk or Ray Kurzweil or Jeff Bezos or myself, and so you can look at the news through their eyes. So it's like, we'll be rolling this out in a couple weeks. Eso it will like show you. OK, this article is selected by Virtual Ellen and up voted by Virtual Peter, and it becomes sort of a A means by which you can see the news through the lenses that you want, and it helps me see them using a much more constructive, positive sense. So I mean those you know, it's interesting. People talk about AI being biased, right? But the algorithms not bias, it's the data you feed the algorithms that's biased. If you feed an algorithm, Onley dog images and you show it a cat, it says, Oh, it's a dog and our brains of the same way. It's what you feed our brains that biases us. So they were. That's my That's my fascinating. And if we stay grounded in this concept of mindset, as you said, the foundation Teoh, everything um, you You said it was we We moved quickly through it because we got right into the actual meat. But you said it's like what? You feed your brain and it's very similar toe. I'm understanding what you're saying is you are choosing whether you choose you choose your friends whether you choose how you choose the news. Um, and in a world where, um, future loop is not everywhere and ubiquitous quite yet, I'm sure it will be in six months if your track record says it is anything but, um, we are programming ourselves and I'm wondering if you can. Are there you you cited, like on the horizon? There's the news and our friends. What about internally? What? You know, I like to say that the most important words in the world of the ones we say to ourselves and so 100% Yeah, so just give me a letter. I wake up every morning and in the shower. I have my mantra as that I have right a lot of this. One of my closest friends on planet someone I think the world of as a mentor, as a friend, as a co conspirators Tony Robbins. So 29 of a couple companies together we're writing a book together called Life Force, which will be a late 2021 book about extending the healthy life span. Um, but, you know, if anybody's ever gone to any of his programs, uh, God knows he's he's like not going to events is like slaying him because he's a matter 30 30 countries and 30 days with no 35, people in the audience with him so using staff having a different experience of life right now. But, um, I have my what I call my massively transforming a purpose. So in the morning, whether it's in the shower before it's two or three times a day, you know, and it goes like this. I see, hear, feel and know that the purpose of my life is to inspire and guide entrepreneurs to create a hopeful, compelling and abundant future for humanity. And I say that over and over and over again. So it what it comes out. It's okay for me. It's about inspiring and guiding entrepreneurs, right? That's the means by which I impact the planet, and how do I want to inspire and guide them. I want them. I want to help them support them, encourage them to create a hopeful, compelling and abundant future for humanity. Because I think ultimately we that's what we need. We need to see hope. We need to see not only hoping a compelling future for ourselves and to create an abundant future for humanity and this idea of abundance. We're going from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset on DMA I dear friend Stephen Cotler who, um, we both have a tremendous 11 respect for, you know, we wrote in a book that changed my life. I It was one of these ideas that came into my like I was like, Wow, that's big! And then I called Stephen Stephen, we have to do this book on Abundance goes I've been thinking about the same thing, and it's the notion that technology is a force. It takes whatever was scarce and makes it abundant. And this simplest way to say that is as more and more people are, are increasing in wealth and capability. Some people say, Oh my God, I have to take the pie and slice into thinner and thinner slices. Now it's like, No, that's bullshit. No, we're gonna bake more pies. It's like there's there's all the energy and water and a eyes gonna give us abundant health care and education and all of these things, and it's again comes back to mind set. It's It's fascinating the when this is a common threat amongst all of all of the greatest thinkers that I've studied in my life across all kinds of different industries. You mentioned Tony been a guest of Tony's that many of his is, um, experiences. But regardless of industry, it seems, mindset is the common thread it at the highest performers and not just people who create success for themselves. But as you know, Tony likes to connect success and fulfillment because what is success without fulfillment is hell, right? Because you've done the things and you haven't you don't derive the personal and community benefits from them. So it's fascinating to me that mindset is this thread. And yet how and why are we so on you ill equipped as a culture? Why is this not the most important, you know, guiding principle that we teach our Children from a very, very young age. What's why is that the case? Um, because we as a species and as a culture for the majority of human existence, it's been about survival. Um, and it's been around just surviving against, ah, you know, compendium mix in the past or starvation or getting shelter and so forth. It's just now that we have the luxury of being able Teoh to really take a vacation from survival. But I would also say that a lot of the a lot of the teachings of Buddhism, uh, and and some of the practices in Hinduism and so forth do talk about mindset. It Buddhism is all about mindset. You know, I grew, I grew up is a is a Greek Orthodox Christian, you know, from my from my family culture and so forth. But as I read, I'm like, Oh, I really, actually like being a Buddhist, you know? It's like it's like we can start to choose what philosophies and what mindsets work better for us. Yeah, that makes sense. The fact that on an evolutionary scale are the freedom to not to be serving the horizon for saber tooth tigers were on the front end of that And so is it your belief? And And maybe you can, you know, tie in the Singularity University is that one of the reasons that you know the Singularity University exists Is this part of your contribution to education and and why the topics that the Singularity University, um, puts ah ah, lens on is, are are so related to human potential and are so optimistic, or what's you know, how do you How do you look at the role of the Singularity University in this mindset and a new education for? Because that's why people are listening and watching right now. Honestly, they want to learn, and they want to learn from the world's best. And what is? I'm trying to beat this drum of mindset and because it's such a continuous threat across all of our guests and all of the top performers, and you touched so many industries. Let's let's talk about you know what you've done for education and why So thank you and let me define what Singularity University is. So I started my first university. It's hard. It's funny to say that when I was in grad school and on my TIA stored with two co founders, Todd Holly and Bob Richards um, something called the International Space University. And it's still going strong in Strasbourg, France, and very proud of it. Ah, and it's a multinational, multicultural, multi disciplinary university for the Graduate Study of space and space is now becoming a thing. Becoming your vote, Um, 12 years ago, I'm I'm backpacking through Patagonia and Chile and I bring one book with me and it's Ray. Kurzweil's book that had just come out called The Singularity is near, and it's this big ass book and it's like Ways of time in my backpack. It's like, OK, I'm going to read this book. And as I'm reading this book, Ray lays out all of the different exponential technologies and where they are. And 12 years ago was ancient history on the speed of change. And I'm like, I know a lot of this stuff, but the way Ray, uh, juxtaposed it all and put it together. It's fascinating, and I said, There's no place on the planet You can go to really learn about all of these areas. Computation, sensors, networks, ai robotics, three D printing, synthetic biology augmented virtuality blocking. And there should be a place that you can go. And so I come back. I just recruited Ray onto my boarded X prize. I have, ah, now famous dinner with him and I pitched him. I said, Ray, we should create a singularity university that that allows people to learn about all of these things, Not go, because right now you go down my t, you go to Harvard or Stanford to go wherever on the planet you go, you go. And you do a deep, deep dive into one of these areas. You become the world's expert, not on bacteria, not on a picked area genome. Not on a plasmid, not on a gene on a specific promoter sequence in a gene in a bacteria, you know, in the ground. It's like you're so hyper focused, and that's great. But, um, I wanted a place where a person can go and see what's materializing where where's the convergences of these technologies? And, uh, we shook hands on it and we kicked it off, and it's a place right now. And as to you, given, everything going on is going digital more and more. But if you go toe s u dot org's You can See It started a nonprofit, and then it became so successfully flipped into a for profit, just able to be more agile and, um, be able to incubate companies out of it. And abundance dot digital is my my segment of it that I mentor entrepreneurs in, uh, and ultimately I think, uh, people need to understand. These are the most powerful technologies. No matter if you're an artist, a musician, a physician or whatever a career you want A. I is going to transform your business a ar and VR and computation and quantum computing. And we're not trying toe turn people into PhDs that understand the physics. It's like you should understand, like, what's possible? And where is it going? And what are the convergence is that air going toe change things up because every industry is going to change every industry, not in 100 years, 50 years. This decade we have This community is largely about creativity and entrepreneurship. And when a lot of folks think about creativity, um, this may be a little redundant, for, you know, people are longtime fans of the show, but for context in our conversation, you know creativity is not Popsicle sticks and pipe cleaners and glitter that were taught in second grade creativity with the capital C is you know, that's our ability to solve problems and to put two new and things that used to not go together together toe to be useful. And so if you're spending a lot of time obviously focused in talking about technology and our understanding of it, But isn't there a isn't there? A. If you're sequencing these things, isn't understanding and knowing the power of creativity and you as an individual's ability to create or co create new things versus being sort of this cork and the tide like, Oh, I'm along for the ride. And so how have you, um, how do you or how would you share of people in our community, this mindset of possibility that you are not a cork in the tide, that you have to take responsibility for co creating the world? You talked about mines where we spent the 1st 15 minutes talking about mindset, and that was that's actually a creativity exercise. I'm just I'm curious to get your lens on creativity as a basically a precursor for where you go to school, What job you have What? You what you decide to pursue. Wondering where your comment there. I love that. Um, So first of all, I think the single most important thing anybody needs to do is discover their passion and their purpose. Um, I think it's when the most important things. I spend a lot of time talking to entrepreneurs about what is your massively transformative purpose? There's a great quote by Mark Twain. He says they're too important days in your life the day you were born and the day you find out why, right? So I'm really I feel blessed and lucky. Ah, when I was 89 years old, I was born early sixties. Um, the Apollo program happened at the same time that that amazing scientific documentary called Star Trek came into existence. And the different that the the interesting dissident and reinforcement of like, wow, this is what we're doing right now. We're on the moon. Holy shit, that's extraordinary. And then start taking, like this is where we're going. And that lit me up. And that became my purpose. My parents, uh, born and island lez was, um uh ended up. You know, my dad became a physician, moved here to the U S. My mom should have been a doctor. She ran his office, and it was always expected I'd become a doctor. And so that was like, Mom won't be a national nice, nice son. But you're gonna be a doctor. And so I went to medical school to make them happy. I was running two companies my fourth year medical school or launch company and that space university I mentioned, um and but because I was fueled by that passion, that purpose. So I think the most important thing that anybody needs to do is connect with that passion, that purpose, to discover it, to let it blossom in you. And then once you know, that's your canvas, and it can change over time, right? Mine early with space. I retain that. Still to some degree. But then it turned to one of the world's biggest problems. And how do we solve them? X prize and singularity were born out of that, um, and then making 100 years old, and you, 60 has been sort of my passion and purpose for the last. Um, last five years. I guess as you get older, you desired add 30 years, sort of like looms more significantly in life. Um, but I think, honestly, getting connected with your passion is like, the most important thing. How how do we do it? Cause everyone saying it right, I've been saying it. Everyone. What? You find your purpose. It's like the tractor beam. What used to feel like pushing rocks uphill now feels like running downhill. The world is happening for you rather than to you. But how? How did you discover this? So there's a few tricks that I play with people and first is you have to be willing to try things on and be clear that you can change you. Can you try something out for a week? A month? You know, you don't have to commit for the rest of your life your passion, Concetta, over time. But it's like what feels right for you. So the first thing is, what did you want to be as a kid before your parents or your or the world told you you couldn't because passion is about connecting with energy emotion. So it's like what? There's gotta be an emotion behind. It has to be love, awe, hate, anger. Whatever it is, there's a deep emotion that fuels that. Because ultimately doing anything big and bold in the world is hard. And if you don't have that emotional energy were emotional beings you will give up before you get there. The stuff that I tried just to make money, it was It was empty and meaningless. And I gave up and I it was it was, you know, the stuff that was truly, uh, the kid in me or the I've got to solve this. This is awesome. I'm so excited to be a piece of this equation, that stuff, Uh, when you hit a brick wall, you know, you wrote rub off the, uh, the hurt, and then you get up and you keep going again because the passion is still there. So what you wanna do is a kid. If I gave you a billion dollars and said, I want you to change the world, you can't spend this on yourself. What would you do with it, right? I mean, those are a few sort of directional games to play. Um, and then ultimately, where technology plays in this is technology is going to enable us to become the ultimate creators. So imagine in the future we all have a version of Jarvis from Iron Man in a I software shell that surrounds us. And I said, You know, I want to create a thing that that ice that is able to hold my coffee keeps it warm. I don't wanna handle And I can like describe mentally what I want. And the AI is able to visualize it in my augmented reality field, and I see it. No, no. Could you add this? Add that and can you make it like so the coffee doesn't cool off, so I don't know about thermal coefficients, but you do. And can you tell me how much would make be to make? Oh, it's a buck. You make it cheaper anyway, and you can describe your intentionality, and then the technology wrapped around that will then determine what the right materials are. The right tool paths for three D printers, and it's a great that's it. Can you please make it for me, right? That's ultimately all of us become creators by just connecting our mindset on our intentionality of our what we desire. It's all you have to know is what do you desire? Can you dream big and desire and then used technology to convert your desires into physical visualizations? And so far the means There's tools like Photoshopped that are part of the equation on the way there, right or word that helps you spell right. Because, no, I defined someone who can't spell a word two or three different ways is not being creative. I That that brings, um your description of that brings joy in my book creative calling. The first of the four parts is about imagination and our we've sort of lost our imagination, our ability to think big. And that was part of what was, um, inspiring and reading, you know, bold the ability to think in a big, bold way versus the constrained way that we're taught. And so right now there's someone who's listening or watching, and they're like, Yeah, but and they're listing all of the sort of practical reasons that they can't do this, citing things like mortgage and three kids and no time. And what your prescription to those folks is it sort of go back to that dreaming big. Well, I'm just so where people are stuck. Yeah, and and I respect that right. And there's a reality of life. Like I lost my job. I've got three kids Don't tell me about, you know, thinking big and so forth and, you know, respect. I get that. I remember, you know, not too. Not too long ago. There was a moment in time where I had bought something, and this is like, you know, God a dozen years ago, and I couldn't pay my bills that next month, and I had to return it. And it was a, uh, hurt. And, um and so I never want to forget that because it grounds me in that regard. But the most important thing was, when you find your passion, you will find increments of time to work on things, to do things, to imagine things. And people love hanging out with people who are happy. People love hanging out with People have got a great mindset. You want to hang out with someone who's Debbie Downer and depressed all the time. It's reality. We all go through that. But if you are, if you can eat her way up to be more excited and taught you took when you find your passion about you speak about it and excited fashion, you speak about it and people are attracted to you and all of these things add onto it. So it all comes back for me of what do you passion about? Can you find your passion? Can you have conversations with people? Can you go and read about as many people and ask people, Do you passionate about How did you find your passion? Get case studies and stories and so forth and try things on? And don't be afraid because oh, my God would forget wrong bullshit. You don't There's no right or wrong. It's like what feels good for you. It seems whimsical to people who haven't bought into it yet, but that what feels good to you is again this I've always sort of deconstructed my successes and failures, and the successes and failures of people have been on the show and at Creativelive and that, you know, the the cultivating, the energy, the passion, the, um, the the framework for doing all of this stuff is literally what lights you up. So I'm gonna say something to you. I'm gonna say phrase, and I was hoping that you would then elaborate on it. Sure. The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself. Yeah, I believe that. I believe that we are all that we manifest our future and that we are more powerful than ever before. People don't realize how powerful they are. We are our or in that, uh, first of all, if you think about today as an individual, living in the year 2020 into 2021 you have access to all the information in the world. Literally. You know, I love, you know, saying Okay. All right. Siri, what's the grocery national product of Ghana? He's got Gingrich. In 2018 the gross national income of Ghana was about $63.4 billion per year. So I mean, it's like, um, you can ask any question, get the answer. That's extraordinary. You have access to all the entertainment and knowledge on the planet for free. I mean, this used to be only resident in the hands of the wealthiest kings and queens and billionaires and even what they knew was minuscule. You have access to, you know, spin up computational power if you know how to find it. So ultimately were more powerful than ever before. We're able to reach out and connect to people. And, uh, one of the most one of the most scarce things is the is the passionate, committed mind. So it really is find your passion and being getting committed to it. Uh, and once you do that, magical things happen. Because if and then it's one of things that's important is you have to let everyone know what your passion is. Boom, You because when you when you communicate that, then the universe comes to you, your friend goes, Hey, I didn't know that. That's awesome. Did you know that Bill or Trish over here knows this and that? And since things start coming to you, you become magnet for those things. So, you know, creating the future is by intentionality by saying, you know, and it's just it's magical. It really, truly is. I don't believe in the bullshit of, like, magical thinking. I do believe in in the in being clear about this is what I want to create. This is where I want to go, and I'm gonna work towards that. I'm gonna find people gonna help me on the way I'm going to read about it and learn about it and creating that future. And by the way, you know, sometimes it takes a decade. You know, a lot of the things in my life I jokingly say we talked about this a best. It's overnight success after 11 years of hard work. No. Isn't it true that science supports this idea of manifestation? The quantity at a quantum physics level, I think for the folks right there that are like, God, I don't need another version of the movie. The secret. Thanks, Chase. Thanks, Peter. Give me something. Really? And, you know, can you speak about this? You know, from the, um, science at the brain and science of, um, um, quantum mechanics. Well, the science of the brain is one that we are constantly bombarded by, you know, thousands of times more information than we can consume in our brain. Um, and we have cognitive biases that filter what we see and how we process it. And, uh, if you become clear about the vision of where you want to go, you will pick up trace information, little intonations and conversations and a sentence that you read that will lead you in those directions or breadcrumbs that you would otherwise ignore. Right without a target, you'll miss it every time. And so just being able to your bombarded by information and people in connections and so forth, and we don't realize how much of that falls to the ground fallow. But if you're clear about what you're looking for, you will say something in a conversation that will elicit something else that will lead to something else. All of a sudden. Wow, How did that material eyes had that happened? It didn't just happen magically. It happened because you were looking for it and because you were putting that out into the universe, either by conversation or how you decide to spend your time. And that, for me, is very riel. It's very real. This notion that so much of the best things in world are a 10 or year overnight success has a lot of people worried, especially again a whole whole range of ages. Listen and watch the show, and for someone who's later in that, um, life arc. There's a panic of I don't have 10 years, and I'm unease. This is a creative Segway to longevity. You made a joke earlier. You know, um, if you're if you're you know, 19 and listen to the show like everyone would agree that you have time, although, you know, life is uncertain and obviously we're in a crazy time right now where you know that that certainty is is share showing it's often in a a lot of ways. But let's just agree for a second that wait a minute. Not only is life long, but that is, you know, that is the only way commitment to something you actually care about over time. It's the overtime part that most people with on. So as you're talking with your hands here again for those who are listening rather than watching, they missed this benefit. But I can see what I think is an ordering. Yes, yes. My venture fund number proud is one of the early investors in your ring. I wear that as well. And what you can't you can't measure. You can't improve it so well. Here we are. Um we want to pursue These things were nervous about how long it takes to create the success that we want. And sometimes it can take two year words. 11 years. I'm got 11 years, but you do. And if you don't think you dio talk to us about the future of longevity and this is you've written about this extensively, you are active in it. You made a comment earlier about adding 30 years, Teoh your life. So, uh, awesome. Ah ah. The average human life span for most of human history was like 28 or 30. You would have a baby at age 13 when you went to puberty and 100,000 years ago. But what time you were 26 27 28. Your baby is having a baby. And back when food was scarce before whole foods and McDonalds were around, Um, the last thing you wanted to do was steal food from your baby's mouth, your grandchildren's mouth because it didn't perpetuate the species. So the best thing you could do is die. And so we didn't develop a a long lifespan past our reproductive age. And but it turns out that there are species of life on Earth. Remember when I was in medical school? I watched a TV show on long lived sea life that certain species of whales could live 200 years. Like the bowhead whale the Greenland shark will do for 500 years, sea turtles will do. 500 years long is 700 years, and I'm like, Holy shit, why can they? Why can't we? And I remember thinking myself, it's either a software problem or hardware problem, and we're going to solve those things. And so we're finally at a point now where we're beginning to truly understand the software in the hardware, the human body. And so there is a multitude of companies, ah, number of which I'm invested in or have had the pleasure to co found and or advise, um, that are in phase one, Phase two, phase three clinical trials of incredible breakthroughs. Um, and and this is I mentioned earlier that I'm writing a book with 20 Robbins. It's called Life Force, and it's about all of these different What? What are the technologies out there that are going to increase vitality and health span? It is not about being in a wheelchair or 120 years old. This is about having the aesthetics, the cognition, the mobility at 100 that you had a 50 or 60 right? So that you feel good. You look good. You're moving around. You're enjoying life and such. And I think that we really are gonna add 10 20 maybe 30 healthy years over the course the next 10 to 20 years. The rate of technology is expanding that fast. And so there's a concept that that Ray Kurzweil, uh, and operate a great talk about called longevity escape velocity. And the concept is the following that for every year that you're alive, there's going to be so science is adding lifespan every year to your life by terms of breakthroughs of reducing cancer, heart disease, No, your general disease. And there's gonna be a point that at some point where science is adding more than a year to your lifespan for every year that you're alive and then it becomes divergent. And I truly believe kids today have a indefinite lifespan. Um, if they if they choose that and you know, things get very strange. Not if years from now, not 30 years from now, 20 years from now, as we are seeing a I impact everything and the speed at which AI is impacting the world. And I'm tracking this and my work through future Lupin and others. It's insane. It really is like Holy shit. This is faster than I ever imagined. It's like incredible things are coming our way. So, um, there is a multitude from stem cells. Two would have called sin allergic medicines that that killed zombie cells in the body. Senile cells to win pathway manipulations. Teoh to vaccines to augmenting your immunity, augmenting your secular repair mechanisms. There's a multitude of different companies, and it's a multi trillion dollar industry, and you still can't take it with you. So I do think that if you keep yourself in good, reasonable health, um, and there are things you can do right now, just everybody listening. The basic still apply. Can you get seven or eight hours of sleep every day? Right? So I I used to, like try and minimize my sleep and I'm yes, the or a ring comes out, and I There's a great book by Matt Walker called Why We Sleep. I commend it to everybody. And after reading that book, I don't. I prioritize, Lee. I don't short change it. If evolution could have gotten rid of sleep, it would have, uh, because we're so we're so exposed during sleep or so unproductive during sleep. It is fundamental to your help. The second thing is exercise. The third thing is diet. I try and do intermittent fasting as much as I can. Um, so I don't have breakfast. Even though I was taught growing up, it's the most important meal of the day. I try. I am and do a 15 to 20 our fast every day. Um uh and then, uh, and then mindset, right. If you think you're screwed and you're going to die, you may very well if you are excited about life and you're excited about living to see what's next, Um, that attitude is fundamentally important. So science is coming strong in the interim. Sleeping, dieting, exercising mindset, supercritical. It's crazy house. What is it? Uh, simple, but not easy, right? Thes air. It's not like you're saying you need to get this rare route from sub Saharan Africa and grind it into a powder and snorting snort it right? You're saying sleep eight hours and and yet, as a culture were slow to adopt those things. And ah, you mentioned diet. You mentioned intermittent fasting. You know, there's we've got episodes galore on that. I think a lot of folks have gone very, very deep, so I won't tread where others are experts. But anything else that you were doing with your diet, that is, um, a simple take away. Besides, I've gone. I've gone vegan. 100%. I was pesky Terrian eating fish and so forth. But my biggest risk genetically is is cardiovascular disease. And so I've just decided to pummel it. Eso have gone all vegan. I do my best to reduce sugar intake as low as possible. Um, and you say sugars? Are those artificial sugars or natural sugars as well? Um uh, artificial sugars, Aziz. Much as possible. You know, I love ice cream, but I'm like I'm luckily lack toes intolerant. So I use that, you know, but all sugars and including trying, you know, just spiking my insulin levels by eating too much fruit. Um, you know, And there is there is that point to be made. You know, I don't want to like, live long If I hate my life, you know? So it's all a matter of there's a phrase my dad taught me when I was buying method, and I just don't from ancient Greek, which means everything in moderation. And so, you know, I I'm I'm moderate about being extreme there. But I have gone vegan, Um, because I think it's just you get all the protein you need and it's healthier for you. And, um, and then I have, ah, supplements that I take. And in all the end of the day, for me, it's about giving my body the best chance to intercept the technologies that are coming. I like that. It's It's a framework for intercepting the technologies air coming. Um, for people who want to know more about that. Well, let them dive into your, um, your individual works, books and whatnot. But if they go toe, my website demand is dot com. I have all my blog's there. And if you just search on supplements, I've written blog's about what I'm taking, Um, and you know, I think there are ways to boost your immune system, especially now in the you know, age of covert 19. Maintaining a strong immune system is critically important. So you talked about Ah, longevity. Of course. We talked about change and let's, like, smash those things together now. So if ah, we're going to see a lot of change over, um, an increasingly short amount of time, that means the amount of change that we will see. Uh, of course, across the horizon of a life is extraordinary. Already painted a picture of the Jarvis ai. Um, but you also said something in that last, um, um, line of thinking around what? We're going to see change in the next 10 years. And it sounded pretty radical. You're gonna add 30 years of life in the next 10 to 20 years of our time, And people were just being born now are potentially, you know, going to live forever. Now that sounds radical to someone who's not embedded in the science and maybe doesn't surround themselves with yourself and Tony and others. So you know, you are are you know, last five minutes here, I'll just tell you some of the stuff that I think is coming. Um, and this is the latest book that Stephen Collar and I wrote called The Future is faster than you think. Uh, and in the back of it, we talk. You know, the book talks about the next 10 years, how we're gonna transform health care and education, entertainment, finance, insurance, realist eight, retail, every industry, the back of the book. We talk about some of the really interesting stop, not 100 years, but the next 30 years. 40 years. First of all, we have We're about to take the human race into this into space, right? Ellen and Bezos both are guaranteeing that, and that's been area passion for me millions of years from now. Whatever we evolve into, we're going to see we're gonna knows we're gonna go back. Historically, these next 20 years is the moment in time that the human race moved off the planet into space to write, like, take equivalent of the lungfish coming out of the oceans onto land. It's were about you, Bud Guyana, into the cosmos. The other stuff, that's really for me. The most fascinating is that we're on the verge of connecting our brains to the cloud. All right. The whole idea of brain computer interface the idea of our are 100 billion neurons. 100 trillion synaptic connections are limited in our skull because of the size of the vaginal birth canal. Our brains can't get bigger, um, but the same way that my cell phone, when they need to do a complicated problem and do it on the processing on computer, on my cell phone, it goes to the edge of the cloud on four G's tuned to be five g does the processing there and send to answer back. Well, we're on the verge of connecting our brain to the cloud where if I won't understand quantum physics or whatever, I can go to the cloud, think and Google, think and understand. And even more interestingly, if you're connected, your brain to the cloud, I'm connected and other people are connected. Then all of a sudden, there's a meta intelligence. I love Star Trek. The only thing I'm sad that Jean Robert did was create the Borg as an evil species. Um, thank you for for being a bright and positive voice in a time that's tough for so much of humanity. Right now, I know that you're doing a ton of work with therapeutics and diagnostics for Cove in 19 wouldn't have time to get into that. But, um, send us off into your picture of the possibility of the future of someone who is listening right now. Tell us a story in a minute about what you believe is possible for a watcher. A listener. Over the course of the next 5, 10 years of this one precious life that they have, I believe that we are able to connect with people who share our passions, independent of where you live. It used to be that where you were born determined everything your access to books, Teoh communications capability to whether you are black or white. You know what religion you were part of. We have become unencumbered from that we're living on a planet, and I believe that every person has the potential to rise to the abilities of their dreams. And that's what I'm working for, Ah, world in which we could meet the needs of every man, woman and child that if you're clear about what you want to do, how you want to impact what your dreams are now because they can change in the future. You can connect with other people who have that those similar dreams and passions and create magic that we can truly invent the future we want to live into. Uh, and there's nobody's permission you need to ask. It's a function of of just when you hit a roadblock, pick it up and driven by your passion by that North star that guides you every day to just keep on keeping on. And it may take a decade. Uh, but, uh, you'll get there and there is joy in that and meaning in that. And anyway, power a pleasure. Thank Thank you so much. Is there anywhere you'd like to direct people? You've been a bright light, I think, if you want to follow my work, if you go to demand is dot com I put out a blawg every week on these mindsets on the breakthrough. Some seeing future loop dot com is where I'm reinventing how you get. Then use that that you that shapes remind set abundance dot Digital is where I mentor entrepreneurs those the three things anywhere. So much for being on the show. Peter, have ah, wonderful weekend and looking forward to consuming everything you're putting out in the next, uh, next chapter. Good luck. Best everybody listening. Thank you so much."
