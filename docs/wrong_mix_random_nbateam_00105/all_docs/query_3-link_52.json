        "text": "It would be impossible to completely sum up all the emotions that have churned through me over the entirety of the NBA Finals. This was easily one of the greatest Finals that we have been witness to in the history of the league. Just about everything happened that could and therefore it was emotionally draining for those of us with vested interests in the series.\n\nThe Kobe Beef is based in Dallas, Texas. I have lived here for the vast majority of my life. The Dallas Mavericks have always been my favorite professional sports team. Always. Sure, growing up when the Cowboys were winning Super Bowls and partying like it was going out of style was great. Still love the Cowboys too, but they are not the Mavericks.\n\nI have been a fan of the Mavericks for roughly 21 years now and watched them stumble through the 1990s without giving up on them. I cannot say that I expected them to win much during that decade but watching the Three J’s always brought me joy. It never bothered me that they were competing with the Milwaukee Bucks for the worst record in the league. They are my team. Just because they were terrible, and they were, did not mean that I did not care. I am not Chris Bosh.\n\nUnfortunately, I never got to see the Mavericks play in person at Reunion Arena. I would have liked to but that is of little concern now. The first time I actually had a chance to see the Mavs play was when I was in college. They came to UNT to hold their training camp and had a scrimmage in the Super Pit in which students were encouraged to attend. It was wonderful, especially because no matter the outcome of the game the mavericks would win. I can still remember my friends asking me who the short white guy was. I told them that he is not white, he is Puerto Rican and his name is J.J. Barea.\n\nThat was a number of years ago. Since then I have seen the Mavericks be dragged through the mud by the media and their critics. They certainly did not help themselves with their various playoff disappointments but all of that is moot now.\n\nWhatever anyone thought of the Mavericks has been shattered. They have climbed to the top. For a while the treacherous seasons of the ’90s did not seem that far gone. Now, they are a distant memory banished to a far away land. The Dallas Mavericks are NBA Champions for the first time in franchise history. Writing that line gives me great joy. I like many other fans, have been through it all with the club. Every high and every low. However, we had never experienced the greatest thrill until now. No team is more deserving.\n\nThis group of veterans who cannot jump high or run fast deserve this. They played as a team and won as a team. Throughout the playoffs their celebrations have been muted. They were focused. Rick Carlisle kept their opponents guessing. They were the better team and they were without some key players.\n\nIt does not seem real yet, it has not sunk in yet. It will though and it will be perfect.\n\nNo pundit expected anything of the Mavericks as they entered the playoffs this year. The only expectations came from their fans and from themselves. In every series they were considered the underdog with the exception of the Western Conference Finals. Yet, they persevered as a team and kept finding miraculous ways to win and overcome adversity. When they lost the 23 point lead in game four against Portland, they were written off. When they had to face the Lakers in the Conference Semi’s they were brushed aside. There were even those who dismissed them against the young and inexperienced Thunder. Dallas overcame them all but the critics remained, however, they were shrinking in number and overdue praise for Dirk Nowitzki was beginning to surface.\n\nIn the Finals Dallas faced the Miami Heat. The Heat are everything that the Mavericks are not. They are flashy, boastful, young, cocky, arrogant, and childish. They were anointed, by themselves, to be the next dynasty. How many rings will this team win? I guess we will still have to wait for that question to be answered.\n\nThese teams met before in the Finals. The end result left a bad taste in my mouth for years. However, it seemed to effect Nowitzki and Jason Terry more as they are the only two hold overs from 2006. They played will determination and guts. They knew that nothing was written in stone and that you have to create your own destiny. They did and what they accomplished can never be taken away.\n\nThe emotions of the championship will never fade, they will just be stored away until they are needed once the celebration dies down. I know that I will always hold onto them. It has been a long time coming.\n\nJ.J. Berea, Rodrigue Beaubois, Corey Brewer, Caron Butler, Brian Cardinal, Tyson Chandler, Brendan Haywood, Dominique Jones, Jason Kidd, Ian Mahinmi, Shawn Marion, Dirk Nowitzki, DeShawn Stevenson, Peja Stojakovic, Jason Terry, and the Dallas Mavericks are NBA Champions. I can die happy.\n\nAs the first full month of full-fledged free agency mayhem draws to a close, we here at the Beef bring you yet another update of what has transpired since our last posting on the subject as well as trades, a few other musings, and bits of news. It is hard to believe that free agency has only been going on since July 1 with so much that has happened so far. It seems like the events that have taken place in the span of one month could fill a span of six months. Without further adieu here are the latest moves:\n\nMovement:\n\nLast time we wrote on the subject of Matt Barnes his future remained in limbo as the Toronto Raptors did not think to adjust for currency exchange rates, or for that matter even look at their cap room, when attempting to acquire him. Barnes, the Canadian faithful believed, would make the team tougher. With this belief the Raptor’s fan base revealed their subconscious belief that what Bryan Colangelo is not meeting with their full approval. (Chris Bosh may have relaxed on the team in the final months but Colangelo is the one to be blamed for not fostering a constructive and successful atmosphere.) Bringing in a player who now gets spotty minutes and frequently sits out games because of an ailing back is a rather unlikely candidate to make a team any tougher. Oh, Canada. At least Torontonians can take solace in their consolation prize, David Andersen. Andersen easily qualifies as the poor man’s Brian Cardinal but since he is Australian it would translate more like this: David Andersen, Australian for Brain Cardinal.\n\nWhere the Raptors have failed the Los Angeles Lakers have succeeded. Kobe Bryant, after being denied by Raja Bell, was still on his quest to bring veteran defense to Hollywood. Bryant certainly did not “flinch” at the opportunity in front of him and the Lakers. He found Matt Barnes in his state of limbo and set forth to woo him with the notion of a ring and the Lakers’ remaining $1.8 million of their midlevel exception. One of the NBA’s better known journeymen (he has played on eight teams in eight seasons) is coming home to L.A. Barnes signed a two year deal worth $1.77 million in the first year with a player option worth almost $2 million in his second year. This signing could be seen as another stinging blow that Bryant has dealt the Raptors in his career (*cough* 81 points *cough*) but chalk it up to bad front office management by the Raptors.\n\nThe same day that the Lakers signed Barnes, aging veteran Theo Ratliff, signed a one year deal worth $1.35 million. (Do not tell Dale Davis though, he may expect a knock on his door next.) This acquisition could not have come at a better time for the Lakers as Luke Walton appears to be on the cusp of missing the entire 2010-11 season and Andrew Bynum has just had another knee surgery. It seems like Bynum has had surgery on his knee or had it drained at least once for every year he has been alive by now. Ratliff now has the opportunity to become fast friends with Josh Powell, D.J. Mbenga, Adam Morrison at the end of the Lakers bench.\n\nWhile the Lakers have been keen at adding pieces to their bench they have also made an effort to unload many of the pieces that we so fondly belittle here at the Beef. Currently, Los Angeles is trying to trade Sasha Vujacic. If they could unload him it would free up room to help entice Shannon Brown, whose overhyped abilities do not work at all in the triangle, to stay with the team. It has been reported that Brown has received an offer from the New York Knicks worth around $4 million a year. That would be a lot of money to turn down for a player who would likely only get spot minutes behind Steve Blake next season.\n\nJust when you thought that David Kahn was done associating the Minnesota Timberwolves with any more point guards, he goes and trades for two more. To Kahn, point guards are pets, not quite domesticated, however. With Jonny Flynn missing three to four months after hip surgery maybe Kahn was actually the cunning one for the first time. Minnesota finally unloaded Ramon Sessions (it was well known that they had every intention to do so for some time) and packaged Ryan Hollins in a deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers for Delonte West and Sebastian Telfair. Yet, as is Kahn’s way (he is a madman), the trade is never to be taken at face value. It is likely that the Timberwolves will waive West because his contract is not guaranteed and then try and move Telfair. Kahn is after something, he is going after it with everything he has got as if it were a white whale or the genesis device. What the end goal actually is, only Kahn knows. For now the fans of the Timberwolves will have to remain trapped deep within Regula with only a glimmer of hope and where hours can seem like days.\n\nEddie House in an effort to remain somewhat relevant has chosen to follow the lead of many other has-been players and ride the coattails of the Miami Thrice. House joins Shavlik Randolph and Carlos Arroyo as the latest recruits to join the Miami Heat. The Heat now have a full 15 man roster and are ready to start the season. As a fantasy basketball roster, the Heat have constructed a mediocre lineup aside from four or five players. Despite this, there will likely be quite a number of W’s for this team in the coming season.\n\nIn what equates to a loss for the Dallas Mavericks will translate into a huge win for the Bay Area. Jeremy Lin, the Summer League standout who overshadowed John Wall in their matchup, has signed with the Golden State Warriors. Harvard University is known for graduating future presidents, Nobel laureates, and Supreme Court justices but Jeremy Lin is following another path after graduating from the prestigious institution. He becomes just the fourth player to play in the NBA after attending Harvard, and the first in 57 years. The others were Wyndol Gray, Saul Mariaschin, and Ed Smith. Lin grew up in Palo Alto, California which is 26 miles from Oakland so his joining the Warriors is a homecoming of sorts and has the Bay Area rather jubilant. Also joining the Warriors is Jannero Pargo who inked a two-year deal worth $2.4 million.\n\nIt is unfortunate that Don Nelson appears to be on his way out in Golden State once Joe Lacob, the Warriors future co-owner along with Larry Ellison (I have beef with Ellison dating back to high school, ask about it later), gets his mitts on the team. Lacob has publicly stated that “It’s not really whether Nellie is here this year or not. He’s not going to be here beyond this year, that is clear.” So obviously the writing is on the wall, not only that but it is bold, red, and embossed as well. It is a shame that that is the case. We here at the Beef have poked fun at Nelson’s coaching style and his losing ways but there is something do be said about the way he schemes and plays the most frenetic small ball in the league. Just think of a lineup with Monta Ellis, Stephen Curry, Jannero Pargo/Jeremy Lin, Ekpe Udoh, and David Lee on the court. That would be pure madness; it would be pure Nellie. At least on video games, the Warriors will still be fun once Nelson has been forced to pack his bags.\n\nJosh Howard seems to be adhering to the trend of former team bashing. Howard has stated that the Wizards have given him the opportunity to play his game that he was never given previously. The one time Maverick signed a one year deal with the Washington Wizards that could net him $4 million if he meets certain incentives. Howard had surgery in mid-March and is on schedule to be ready for the start of the season, according to his agent, Derek Lafayette, but there has been no official word about when he will actually return. To resign Howard, Washington was forced to release James Singleton. Also on the injury front for the Wizards, newly acquired forward, Yi Jianlian, has injured his arm while playing in a competition in China. 哦!\n\nOther signings:\n\nWill Bynum has resigned with the Detroit Pistons, Joey Graham has signed with the Cavaliers, and Von Wafer has signed with the Celtics. The signing of Wafer is likely a response to Tony Allen’s departure to Memphis. Instead of coming back to the NBA and coat-tailing like Eddie House, Stephon Marbury has spurned the Heat preferring instead to sign a three-year deal with Shanxi Zhongyu in China. (There are contradicting stories about whether the Heat actually approached Marbury about signing with the team, but I’m going to give Starbury the benefit of the doubt. Miami needed players bad for a while.) It’s all about the Chairman Mao’s, baby!\n\nRoots:\n\nThis week Amar’e Stoudemire discovered that he has some Jewish heritage on his mother’s side and has traveled to Israel to learn more. According to ESPN’s Marc Stein, Stoudemire has shown interest in Judaism for some time and recently had a Star of David tattooed on his hand. This new tattoo should go along quite nicely with the prominent “Black Jesus” that he has tattooed on his neck. With the news of Stoudemire’s newly found Jewish roots the Knicks have successfully pulled off one of the greatest marketing coups that any sport has ever seen; too bad for them that he will spend the last few years of his playing career in either Orlando or Miami. (I kid, I kid!)\n\nTeam USA:\n\nThe team trimmed its roster down from 19 to 15 players this week. On the chopping block were Tyreke Evans, O.J. Mayo, JaVale McGee, and Gerald Wallace. Team USA begins training camp August 10 in New York City.\n\nShaq:\n\nShaquille O’Neal was once a professional basketball player. Now the “Big Aristotle” is just a reality television star who occasionally sings songs with Justin Bieber.\n\nFor much of the nation, the initial reactions to “The Decision” (brought to you by the University of Phoenix, Vitamin Water, McDonalds, Sprite, and Nike with some of the proceeds benefiting the Boys and Girls Club of America) have begun to subside. However, in Cleveland and Miami feelings of anger and dejection and overwhelming elation, respectively, are still in the air. Miami itself is likely just now crashing from the all night coke binge that happened last night. LeBron James is now a member of the Miami Heat via sign-and-trade with the Cavaliers. Chris Bosh joins him, also via sign-and-trade, from the Toronto Raptors. Dwyane Wade, through all the brokered back dealing stays right at “home.” (His real home is Chicago, where his children live). Each player is receiving a six year contract, the maximum allotted, because of the sign-and-trades with their previous organizations and Wade just for staying put. Details of the sign-and-trades have not been fully disclosed as yet but it is safe to say that the Miami Heat will not have any draft picks for the better part of a decade. The Cavaliers alone got two first round and two second round picks through the year 2014.\n\nEach of these All-Stars now has what they have wanted since they played in the Beijing Olympics. They are playing on a team together in the NBA. The NBA, however, is not the national team and the city of Miami certainly does not reflect the nation as a whole. Nations have souls, and Miami is severely lacking in this category. These three players contributed to the gold medal but they did not win it. That distinction goes to a man on the west coast. He won the gold for Team USA; he silenced the crowd and put one finger to his lips. This man has played in seven NBA finals and won five. The trio, triumvirate, Super Friends, Summit Committee, whatever they will come to be called, has two members who have appeared in the finals. One was swept; the other was rewarded with terrible officiating in the most tainted finals the NBA has ever seen. Even despite that, he was the second fiddle on the team. The third member of the trio? He has not been out of the first round.\n\nThis piece is not about Wade or Bosh; it was clear that Bosh was a patsy in this whole ordeal. He made absolutely no choice of his own but was simply persuaded to join one or the other. He lucked out; he plays with both of them now. (In the future, if it is discovered that Bosh orchestrated this entire charade and eventual joining of forces everyone will have egg in their eye. That, however, is highly unlikely). No, this piece is about James and the culture that surrounds him; that which he helped create but was glorified long before he ever left St. Vincent/St. Mary’ s High School. Though the shock of his betrayal is still reverberating, it can with some hindsight be seen as inevitable and unsurprising. The choice of Miami as his target destination is also of little surprise. Though this piece may touch on many cultural dynamics that played into the decision (brought to you by McDonalds) making process it in no way will take the “blame it on society/culture” copout media approach that is rampant in today’s news outlets.\n\nCan you blame him for leaving? Absolutely! You have to. You must. You must vilify this man. (Use of the term “man” is loose here because he is almost six months to the day younger than I am). He has schemed and conspired to be everything that the fans and media thought he was not. Loyalty, thy name is not LeBron. No, it never will be. Can loyalty exist again in the NBA? There is a paradigm shift occurring before our eyes. Sure, Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, and Paul Pierce have played with the same franchise their entire careers but they are all in their thirties. They are the old guard. The new guard? They are in their second and third seasons. Kevin Durant is the godfather of the new guard. What we have seen in the past few days is the actions of the now guard. James is a card carrying member of the now guard. Win now. Boston ushered in the era of the now. Are they to blame for the egotism of the now? No. It has always been there. The now consists of the last group of players who were allowed to make the jump from high school into the NBA, basically the 2003 draft class. These high schoolers never learned loyalty. One can only be loyal to a high school for so long. The friendships forged there are a different story. They can last a lifetime. That is what one gets from high school. College is a different story all together. If you have an alma mater you have a sense of loyalty. Ipso facto: Dwyane Wade stayed in Miami.\n\nJames’s branding machine has been in overdrive since he was in high school and the NBA has allowed that brand to grow. A global empire is something that must be nurtured and cared for. It must also be allowed to develop in an environment conducive to such endeavors. Warren Buffett is the only man alive to have such a successful business operation based in the Midwest. He has cornered the market on Midwestern success. Did Cleveland ever stand a chance? Maybe; but the greatest trick James ever pulled was convincing Cleveland that he was staying home.\n\nOne of James’s Nike commercials eerily predicted the events of this summer. It was one in the series of “LeBron’s” ads that Nike released during the 2006-07 season. It was for the Zoom LeBron 4. Though the location of the commercial seems to have been shot in southern California the general setting is reminiscent of the lifestyle and culture of South Beach.\n\nInterestingly enough is that the music in the commercial is titled “Summer Madness” by Kool and the Gang. A touch of foreshadowing to say the least. With the benefit of hindsight, red flags instantly go up. This landscape and scenery is nothing reminiscent of neither Cleveland nor the Cuyahoga River and its propensity to catch fire. To disregard this music video influence would be in bad form. It has been a constant companion to the culture since the 1980s. Hell, Kanye West was off camera during “The Decision” (brought to you by the University of Phoenix). Other than music videos (his music is only tolerable in video format), the only thing Kanye has brought to the culture is the wide introduction of Ato Matsumoto footwear and odd sunglasses.\n\nThe commercial plays like a music video. Music videos are prone to glorify money and Miami. Have you ever seen one of DJ Khaled’s video? “We’re Taking Over” seems apropos in this situation. Watch it. “Who? We! We tha best!” Those are popular catch phrases of the Miami DJ. These words also ring true to the sentiment of the players, especially James, who united together in Miami. (The improper usage of grammar is also a familiar device to NBA players. Their Twitter accounts are impossibly frustrating to read. David Stern should really think about making two years of college mandatory before the jump to the pros.) Idealization of Miami is something that holds a mysterious mystique with all athletes it seems. Though, no one is rushing to play for the Marlins even though they have won two World Series. Fast cars, beautiful bikini clad women, boats, yachts, the beach, Ocean Drive: all symbols of decadence, luxury and desire. All symbols of the now. The now guard was born in the heart of the 1980s when Scarface and Miami Vice were at their height in popularity. (It can be argued that Scarface is more popular now than it was then). But the movie Wall Street epitomized the mindset of the decade.\n\nGreed, for lack of a better word, is good. Do you not think that the now guard regards this truth to be self evident? They certainly do. Each member of the trio has a six year max contract with the Heat. (Actually it has yet to be determined it they will receive max money but it is certain that they will get very close to it. The argument that they are all taking less money for a chance at winning becomes simply preposterous. Kids in their mid-twenties take less money? Never. Trust me, we want it all). Oddly enough, the man who epitomized the decadence of the 1980s as a coach is the one who swung the deal to land James in Miami. His brash bravado and his ability to seal the deal and win seem to have no end. He is Gordon Gekko. His name is Pat Riley. Reports of Riley’s meeting with James have not been fully disclosed and probably never will be in their entirety. What is known; however, is that Riley simply showed James his rings. All of them. Puppet LeBron James is always insulted by puppet Kobe trying to find his missing rings but real life James was probably chomping at the bit over Riley’s hardware. Pat Riley has never been one for subtlety. He wears Armani on the sidelines. James was easily as awestruck as Bud Fox. Easy work for Riley. Eric Spoelstra is, for now, the coach of the Heat. Since the acquisition of James and Bosh rumor and speculation has exploded as to whether Riley will return to the bench. You bet your life he will coach this team. His ego was made for it.\n\nHow will the Heat fare this season? Only time can honestly answer that question. To question the inherent skill that James and the rest of his new trio possess is not something to do seriously. They are all blessed with remarkable talent. Their salaries, however, will command the majority of the Heat’s payroll therefore making it difficult for other players of quality to join them at a fair compensation. Three All-Stars surrounded by minimum level players is not too appealing. Sure the marquee names are sexy but once you get past them you have Mike Miller and Mario Chalmers. Both are generally known to casual observers of the sport but do not draw much attention beyond that. What about after them? As of yet there is nothing. Five players do not make a team. At this rate the Heat will be forced to settle for players like Keith McLeod (who is now in the D-League) or Brian Cardinal to fill the vacancies in their starting rotation. Juwan Howard, it has been rumored, will land on the Heat. Hopefully each player knows what they have created and is willing to live with it. If not, they will not find their creation to their liking.\n\nSo who created James? The obvious answer would be his mother and father. Yet, it goes beyond that. In high school he would sell tee shirts depicting his own image before and after games. The media ate it up. He has been financially savvy since he realized what he was becoming; or rather what people were making him into. It is about business, it is about money, it is about empire. Michael Jordan is his idol. However, his idolatry of Jordan stops at his business endeavors and play. James changed his number to six. Not really to honor Jordan, though that is partially a reason, but more to brand himself, his image, his number. (Odd choice though. Yes, it is his number from the Olympics but James can never fully distance himself from Jordan. The number six is the number of championships that Jordan won).\n\nAfter “The Decision” (brought to you by Nike) the Cavaliers’ owner, Dan Gilbert, released a scathing letter to the fans of the organization and to the world in general. Every word (capitalized or not) dripped with anger and was tinged with rage. He was certainly not a happy man. His franchise player, a child native to Ohio, had left. Worst of all the Ohio prodigy had done so via the outlet that has come to dictate the lives of most every American: cable television. It would have been one thing to simply make a decision (brought to you by Sprite) and move on from there but to do it in front of an audience of millions in an overhyped extravaganza is something completely different. James sat there, dressed in purple (apparently James is fond of semiotics) with Jim Gray to reveal to the world the dagger he had lodged in Cleveland’s back. Et tu LeBron? Why would he make a decision through any other medium but television? He certainly had to show up the global 3D IMAX movie event that Kevin Durant released earlier that day to coincide with his five year extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder. (Every time I write about the Thunder I cannot help but feel sad for the city of Seattle). Go big or go h…wait, that expression really does not apply here. Gilbert is partially to blame for James’ ego. He helped coddle and mold James’ brain into thinking that he deserved everything and that everyone would bow to his wishes. Now, like Dr. Frankenstein, his monster has broken loose into an ill prepared world that is both terrified and captivated by the creature’s every movement (and every car).\n\nGilbert’s scornful words are appropriate. They are merely the emotions of a parent publicly embarrassed and disowned by their successful child. The hurt is real and the anger will probably never subside. Cleveland and the state of Ohio will feel the same for eternity: dejected. Mo Williams, in his rambling tweets may sum up the victimization that the entire region feels. Eventually, there may be some who forgive but the vast majority never will. Why should they? Many will never forgive Kobe Bryant for his actions in what was a much publicized marital issue. Others will never forgive Tiger Woods for the same thing. However, what James did went beyond what some see as the “sanctity” of marriage. (If marriage was truly sacred, half of them would not end in divorce). James hurt millions. Hopes were crushed. Hope. Hope was a word that President Obama used in his campaign for office. With a cunning sense of stagecraft, last night’s celebration in Miami channeled the President. In large bold letters read the words YES. WE. DID. In Cleveland and elsewhere the audacity of hate continues to grow. Darkness has crept over the land. How can they have hope when the one bright light in their lives decided (brought to you by Sprite) to extinguish itself, only to be re-lit elsewhere? Nonetheless they must move forward, James has.\n\nThis is America, is it not? Should we not have prepared for such a departure based on such shallow reasons? We have idealized and idolized money and affluence for generations. There is no getting around that fact. The state of Texas cannot rewrite their history books to selectively misinterpret that information. It has been a notion which we have attached ourselves to like a Remora. James is simply a product of us. A sellout. Everywhere the culture glorifies the sellout. Do you watch “reality” television? You and the people you watch are sellouts. You have bought into a product. James, himself, wants to become a product. He wants to transcend what it is to be merely human. He wants to get to heaven before he has to die. As disgusting and foul as James’ departure may seem to everyone but the soulless droves in Miami, he is simply doing what Americans have practiced for the entirety of his life. Loyalty is something that may be preached but its stock has gone the way of the sub-prime mortgage. James has captured the American dream. He came from nothing, worse than obscurity and has captured a place in history for himself. People die every day trying to get into this country for one percent of the opportunity that we, as a nation, have afforded to James. Our country is the definition of hubris yet when a person of such a standing takes the moneyed and lavish path, it is we who are first and loudest to cry foul. We are also the definition of hypocrisy. James got exactly what he wanted. Karma will decide if he gets even more."
