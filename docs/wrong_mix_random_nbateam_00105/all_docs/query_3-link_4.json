        "text": "Every year in every professional sport, someone is crowned as the champion at the end of the season. Sometimes they’re only able to win once and can’t reach that goal again, sometimes they go back-to-back, sometimes they win many championships in a short span of years. Every professional sports league has dynasties that come and go as time moves on.\n\nThe best type of dynasties are homegrown. The type of dynasties that find their core group through the draft, develop that core, find their identity, and recruit players that fit their system. These are the ones that you see stick together and dominate for a number of years off of good team chemistry. Some dynasties are very short, but are able to leave a massive imprint on the history of the game. Although basketball is a team sport, some dynasties are kept alive by a single player. The NBA is rich in its history of dynasties.\n\nBill Russell’s Pioneer Celtics\n\nBill Russell was the head horse to the first ever and most dominant NBA dynasty ever in terms of rings. In his 13-year playing career, he led the franchise to 11 NBA titles between 1956 to 1969, some of which he was acting as a player-coach.\n\nOf course, basketball is a team sport first and foremost. Russell had many great teammates alongside him in his dominant run, players such as John Havlicek, Bob Cousy, Sam Jones, Tom Sanders and Tommy Heinsohn. All of these players have their names engraved in the Hall of Fame, cementing their places in NBA history for being apart of the greatest dynasty of all-time.\n\nLakers-Celtics/Magic-Larry 1980's Rivalry\n\nThe 1980s saw a dynasty between two teams, more specifically two players, and quite literally saved the league. The NBA wasn’t getting the ratings it was supposed to be getting and was going on a downward spiral. That was until the 1979 draft came upon and two of the biggest figures in NBA hisory would carry on their rivalry from the College National Championship to the pros. The Los Angeles Lakers chose Magic Johnson with the first overall pick and the Boston Celtics chose Larry Bird with the second overall pick.\n\nIn college, Magic played for Michigan State and Larry played for Indiana State. The two most hyped college prospects would meet in the 1979 college national championship where Michigan State would take down Indiana. Going into the NBA, both players would have each other’s teams circled on their schedule. They would play each other in the Finals three times, with the Celtics taking the win in 1984 and the Lakers winning in 1985 and 1987.\n\nAlongside Magic were fellow superstars Kareem Abdul-Jabaar and James Worthy. Worthy was selected first overall by the Lakers in the 1982 NBA draft and Kareem was acquired in a trade in 1975. Magic and Kareem won a ring in 1980, before Worthy joined the team. When he did join the team, the big three would win four championships together in 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988.\n\nMeanwhile for the Celtics, Larry was accompanied by fellow superstars Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. Parish was selected eighth overall in the 1975 NBA draft and McHale was chosen third overall in the 1980 NBA draft, both picked by the Celtics. The big three would win three championships together in 1981, 1984 and 1986.\n\nMichael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls\n\nThis dynasty needs no introduction. Michael Jordan is the biggest sports figure of all-time and almost everyone in this world knows who he is and what he has accomplished. The Chicago Bulls were a dying franchise before they selected a highly praised shooting guard out of the University of North Carolina named Michael Jordan with the third overall pick in the 1984 NBA draft.\n\nA few years later, the Bulls selected Jordan’s right-hand man Scottie Pippen with the fifth overall pick in the 1987 NBA draft. After falling short to the Isiah Thomas led Detroit Pistons back-to-back years, the dynamic duo, along with coach Phil Jackson, would finally get past them and lead the Chicago Bulls to their first three-peat of NBA championships from 1991 to 1993. Before the 1993–94 season, Michael’s father would tragically pass away, which lead to Jordan retiring from the game in the peak of his prime to play Minor League Baseball in honor of his father.\n\nDuring his time away from the game, the Bulls held their ground as Scottie learned how to be the number one option on a contending team. The roster seemingly improved but were obviously lacking their primetime player in Mike. After almost two years away from the game, on March 18, 1995, Jordan would announce his infamous return to the NBA. That season they would get swept by the Shaquille O’Neal led Orlando Magic in the first-round.\n\nOn October 2, 1995, the Bulls would shock the world and trade for rebounding and defensive superstar Dennis Rodman, who was on the Detroit Pistons team that had bad blood with Jordan and the Bulls in the late 1980s. That move would seem to do more than pay off as the big three of Michael, Scottie and Dennis would lead the Chicago Bulls to the greatest season of all-time, finishing the 1995–96 regular season with a 72–10 record and ending in a championship. This would be the first championship of what was to be another three-peat from 1996 to 1998. The Michael Jordan-Chicago Bulls era is widely known to be the most memorable dynasty in sports history.\n\nTimmy-Manu-Tony Spurs Trio Under Coach Pop\n\nThe Tim Duncan-San Antonio Spurs dynasty is arguably the most successful dynasty of all-time in terms of record. Duncan was drafted first overall in 1997 in recommendation of Hall of Fame coach Gregg Popavich and showed to be one of the best players in the league the second he was drafted. In his rookie season, he would be named to the all-star team and was announced to the First Team All-NBA. In his second season, Timmy, alongside big man David Robinson, led the Spurs to their first championship in 1999.\n\nSoon after the franchise’s first championship, the Spurs would find two diamonds in the rough through the draft that would prove to play huge in the team’s future success. Manu Ginobili was drafted with the 57th pick in the second round in 1999 and Tony Parker was drafted with the 28th pick in the first round in 2001, but Manu didn’t end up playing for the Spurs until 2002. The Spurs’ big three, along with an older David Robinson, won their first title together in 2003. Robinson decided to retire after their 2003 championship victory.\n\nAfter Robinson’s retirement, the big three led the way to four more finals appearances from 2005 to 2014, winning three of those four; 2005, 2007, and 2014. If it wasn’t for Ray Allen’s infamous corner three in game 6 of the 2013 NBA finals against the Miami Heat and their big three of LeBron James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, Tim Duncan would have a finals record of 6–0.\n\nThe Tim Duncan era saw straight dominance for 19 years straight. During that stretch, the franchise didn’t have a season under 50 wins and won 71% of their regular season games, the most dominant stretch by a team in NBA history. This team didn’t have the flashiness or drama of other past dynasties so they typically are forgotten about by casual fans, but real fans know how dominant this team was.\n\nKobe-Shaq Duo/Kobe’s Lakers Career\n\nMany years after the Magic Johnson era, the Los Angeles Lakers were able to find a gem that would guide them into another decade-long dynasty; that gem is none other than Kobe Bryant. On June 26, 1996, NBA Draft saw a draft class that is now known to be the best draft class in NBA History, featuring Hall of Famers such as Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, Ray Allen and Peja Stojakovic. With the 13th pick in the 1996 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Hornets selected the 18-year old kid named Kobe Bryant out of Lower Merion High School. Shortly after being drafted, the Lakers traded for Kobe.\n\nSoon after Kobe was drafted, Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry West was able to pull off one of the biggest free agent signings in NBA history by signing megastar big man Shaquille O’Neal. During the signing, West told Shaq that he just traded for a young kid and that the two would win “multiple championships together.”\n\nIn the 1999 offseason, the Lakers signed championship coach Phil Jackson. Phil was coming fresh off of two three-peats with Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls and was looking to do the same with Kobe and Shaq. In his first season as head coach, the Lakers would win their first championship in what turned out to be the first of a three-peat from 2000 to 2002. The next two years after their three-peat, Kobe and Shaq started having tension build up between the two. It ultimately led the Lakers to have to pick one or the other, ultimately sticking with the younger Kobe and trading the older Shaq to the Miami Heat on July 14, 2004.\n\nThe Lakers struggled for a couple of years after the Shaq trade, so bad that Kobe requested a trade from the Lakers, preferably to the Chicago Bulls. The Lakers front office made a very smart decision deciding not to trade Kobe as he was too valuable to the franchise. Soon after in 2008, the team would acquire all-star big man Pau Gasol in a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nAfter making moves like bringing in All-Defensive player Ron Artest and bringing back floor general Derek Fisher, the Lakers were ready to make another title run. They would come up short to the Boston Celtics and their big three of Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen and Paul Pierce in the 2008 NBA Finals, but won the next two NBA championships in 2009 and 2010, beating the Celtics’ big three in a finals rematch.\n\nThe 2010 NBA championship victory would give Kobe his fifth ring, cementing his place as not just one of the all-time great players to ever play the game of basketball, but the greatest player to ever play in the historic purple and gold. Rest In Peace Kobe Bean Bryant. May his legacy live on forever.\n\nThe Dominant Run Of “The King” LeBron James\n\nWhen it’s all said and done, LeBron James will go down as the greatest player to ever play the game of basketball. With all of the hype that he was given in high school, with his rock bottom expectations being one of the all-time greatest players ever, he somehow managed to exceed those expectations. His journey is truly inspiring as he is the face of the modern generation sports world.\n\nDrafted by his hometown team Cleveland Cavaliers first overall in the 2003 NBA Draft, he proved to be dominant right out of the gate. He wasted no time proving was one of the top players in the league. In his fourth season, he took an average, borderline playoffs Cavs team all the way to the 2007 NBA Finals, where they would get swept by Tim Duncan’s Spurs. The closest the Cavs would get to the finals after their 2007 loss was reaching the Eastern Conference Finals in 2010, where they would come up short to the Celtics’ big three in six games.\n\nAfter getting no help for seven years with the Cavs, LeBron famously announced his decision to take his talents to South Beach and join the Miami Heat in 2010, forming a big three with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. In their first season together, they would outmatch the Celtics’ big three that gave LeBron problems for three years straight. They would lose in the NBA Finals to Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks in what would be the single most impressive finals run by one team and one player in NBA history. The Heat would soon find success as they won back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013, but lost to Tim Duncan’s Spurs in 2014.\n\nAfter the 2014 Finals loss, LeBron decided to go back home to Cleveland with a promise to his city: to bring a championship back to Cleveland. The same time LeBron went back home was the same time Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors would start to emerge. Those two teams would meet up in the 2015 NBA Finals, where the undermanned Cavs, without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, would fall short to the Warriors in six games. The very next year in 2016, there would be a Finals rematch for the Warriors and Cavs. LeBron and Kyrie put on historic performances for three straight games as the Cleveland Cavaliers were the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win the NBA Finals, giving LeBron his third ring. The Cavs would meet the Warriors again for the next two years in 2017 and 2018, but stood no chance with the Warriors’ acquisition of Kevin Durant.\n\nAfter the 2018 NBA season came to an end, LeBron decided to make a decision not only for his career, but for his family who is based in Los Angeles, and sign with the Lakers. In his first season there, the Lakers were a very young, inexperienced team. This, along with LeBron missing a significant amount of games with a groin injury, would miss the playoffs, ending LeBron’s 8-year Finals run. A huge change would be made that offseason as the Lakers traded three of their young star players for superstar big man Anthony Davis. This acquisition would be the beginning of a roster turnaround as they were now ready for a title run. In the 2019–20 NBA season, the world was shut down due to the Coronavirus pandemic, which commissioner Adam Silver designed a plan called “the NBA Bubble”to hold the 2020 playoffs. In arguably the most difficult NBA playoffs of all-time, the Lakers would beat the Miami Heat in the Finals to capture the franchise’s 17th NBA championship and LeBron’s fourth ring.\n\nSince their Bubble run, the Lakers haven’t been the same team. The realization is starting to settle in that the NBA Bubble could be the last chapter of LeBron’s superior championship run. Not just a generational basketball talent, but a generational figure of a human being, the young kid from Akron, Ohio beat all the odds and expectations to become the greatest basketball player to ever play in the National Basketball Association.\n\nThe Rise Of Steph Curry And The Game-Changing Golden State Warriors\n\nIn the 2009 NBA Draft, the Golden State Warriors chose Stephen Curry with the seventh pick, the junior guard out of Davidson College with a lot of promise. Little did they know that this would be the best decision the Warriors organization has ever made. Even if you recognized the talent and skill level he put on display in college, nobody could’ve predicted what was to come next.\n\nSteph would go through many ankle injuries his first three seasons, so much that the Warriors front office almost traded him to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut because of his inability to stay on the floor consistently. The trade never went through because the Bucks medical staff told the front office to deny the trade due to the same reason the Warriors tried trading Steph away, his ankle injuries. The Warriors ultimately traded away star guard Monta Ellis for Andrew Bogut, which meant that the organization and coach at the time Mark Jackson were giving Steph the keys to the team.\n\nIn back-to-back drafts, the Warriors selected sharpshooter Klay Thompson with the 11th pick in the 2011 NBA Draft and then they selected defensive forward Draymond Green with the 35th pick in the 2012 NBA Draft. These three young players, mixed in with some other young players and veterans, were just a mediocre team based in Oakland, California. The next two years saw the team figuring out their identity. In the 2014 NBA Playoffs, the Warriors fell short in a seven game, hard fought first-round matchup against a top five team in the Los Angeles Clippers with Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Jamal Crawford, and an array of veterans. In the words of forward Matt Barnes, who played for the Clippers in that series, “Them mother****ers are next.”\n\nThe 2015 NBA season was the Steph and the Warriors’ coming out party with the team winning 67 games in the regular season, Steph winning his first MVP, and beating LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals to secure the team’s first championship in over 40 years. The very next season, the Warriors achieved the best regular season record of all-time after they finished with a 73–9 record. Steph would shatter the 3-point season record with 402 threes and became the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. Unfortunately, the Warriors’ dream season came to a very disappointing ending as the Cavs would come back from a 3–1 deficit in the NBA Finals, taking the ultimate goal of winning a championship away from the Warriors.\n\nOn July 4, 2016, the basketball world fell to shambles as the biggest free agency signing in NBA history took place; former MVP and megastar Kevin Durant signed with the 73–9 Golden State Warriors. This move gave the league absolutely no chance as the team won back-to-back NBA championships at ease in 2017 and 2018. The very next year in the 2019 NBA Playoffs, the Warriors would reach their fifth Finals in a row, playing Kawhi Leanord and the Toronto Raptors. Kevin Durant would try to come back from a previous hamstring injury in game 5 and ended up tearing his achilles early into the game. In game 6, Klay Thompson tore his ACL and the Warriors ended up falling short to the Raptors in six games. The dynasty seemed like it was over.\n\nThis was the start of a new chapter for the Warriors. Kevin would end up signing with the Brooklyn Nets in the 2019 offseason and Klay would miss the entire 2019–20 season with the ACL tear suffered in the Finals. Five games into the 2019–20 season, Steph broke his hand and missed the rest of the season. The Warriors finished the regular season with the worst record in the league. In the 2020–21 NBA season, Steph would put the Warriors on his back as Klay would tear his achilles before the season, causing him to miss the whole season once again. He entered another level only all-time great players get into later in their careers. This would barely be enough to get them into the play-in game, where they would lose both games to LeBron’s Lakers and Ja Morant’s Memphis Grizzlies and miss the playoffs. After losing to Memphis Steph sent a message to the rest of the league: “You don’t want to see us next year.\n\nThe 2021–22 season was the Warriors’ revenge tour. Waiting for Klay to come back, the team was ready for another title run as they felt they had the pieces to do so. January 9, 2022 will forever be known as “Klay Day,” the day Klay Thompson made his long awaited debut after missing two and a half seasons with two devastating injuries. After this day, you can tell the team was ready to go all the way. The Warriors would finish the regular season as the third seed going into the playoffs. They swept 2-time MVP Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets, beat Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies in 6, and ran through Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks in five games.\n\nThe NBA Finals saw the Warriors being labeled as underdogs with a 14% chance to win the championship against the powerhouse Boston Celtics led by young superstar Jayson Tatum. Steph would prove to be one of the greatest players of all-time in the finals, carrying the team to win the series in six games and finally earning that long awaited Finals MVP trophy. In the words of Mike Breen, “The dynasty is still very much alive.”\n\nFor a team that people said couldn’t win a championship being a primarily jump shooting team, it’s safe to say that they’re doing a very good job proving all the doubters wrong. Changing the way the game is played, this team has had one of the best runs in sports history and they’re still going. This is not the end of Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors dynasty."
