Put them at a concert and these same strangers from diverse cultures, beliefs and ages clap and sing and dance together in a common bond. At that moment, in that song - whatever makes us different is forgotten, what matters is what makes us the same.\n\nComplete strangers enter a dark room in library silence, only to erupt into laughter or wipe away tears from scenes and celluloid experiences that expose our shared humanity. There is a culture above all cultures - POP culture.\n\nPainting pop culture icons and moments is like tapping into that collective. It’s a memory, a story, a personal timeline on what you felt when you heard that song, saw that movie. Who you saw it with, what lines you repeated, what memes you mimicked. Amano paints portraits of characters that are seared into his consciousness to remind us of this cherished collective we call “pop culture.”\n\nAfter 40+ years in commercial illustration - magazine covers (DRAGON BALL Z, POKÉMON, and YUGIOH, TERMINATOR 3), movie posters, comic books and graphic novels, Amano finally made the leap into fine art. Trained by his muralist mother, then in the Honolulu Academy of Art from age five, Jeff graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Northern Arizona University. He now paints and resides in Redondo Beach with his wife Claire and Maximus their English Bulldog. They have six grown kids spread between California and Texas.\n\nAMANO.FASO.COM\n\nFacebook: JEFFAMANOART\n\nInstagram Address: JEFFYAMANOART\n\nACRYLIC RESINS • MIXED MEDIA\n\nBooth A15\n\nWorkshop Instructor - Sign up Here\n\nBorn in the vibrant city of Tbilisi, the architectural pride and capital of Georgia, Janna Arutyunyan was born with a passion for art and a creative drive that coursed through her veins even at a very young age. Growing up surrounded with the beauty of nature, Janna found herself drawn to expressive outlets including art, poetry, and writing for her high school newspaper. This boundless imagination and hunger to expand her creative passion led Janna to pursue further education at a fashion academy that fueled her entrepreneurial spirit in starting a small business as a fashion designer in Georgia.\n\nIn 1990, Janna put her fashion dreams on hold in hopes of pursuing the “American Dream” and immigrated to the United States. Soon after, she continued her education and earned a degree in Management which allowed her to gain valuable knowledge of the American business landscape while maintaining an active role as a mother to her daughter and two sons, all of whom have inherited Janna’s creative genes and are talented artists in their own right.\n\nWith a passion for travel and cultural enrichment, Janna has continued to find herself inspired by the beautiful and bountiful shores of the Black Sea that raised her and the warm beaches of the Pacific Ocean and stunning landscapes of the southwest that welcomed her with open arms.\n\nOn April 28, 2018, Janna was invited by one of her dear friends and fellow artists, Liana Voskanyan, to an art showcase that featured acrylic fluid paintings. At 55 years young, Janna knew that she had found her calling and was invigorated and determined to pursue this newfound love in the technique of mixed media. She immediately began researching and educating herself in the field and, soon after, took her first steps in combining different techniques to create three-dimensional (3D) floral design paintings. Though happy with the fruits of her labor, the process itself proved to be quite time consuming and Janna often joked that she was an accidental artist who simply found the best art therapy as well as a test for her patience. Determined to continue with her creative outlet, Janna dedicated herself to mastering the ability to transfer multiple techniques to form beautiful compositions and just four months into her artistic rebirth, she was invited to curate her first solo art exhibition. With the support of her dedicated clientele, friends, and family, her passion turned into a vision that birthed what is now “Janna Passion Art.” One of the favorite art compositions sought after by her art enthusiast clientele has been Janna’s signature paintings from her “Iris Garden” series which was highlighted in her solo exhibit.\n\nAs an artist, Janna continues to challenge herself by researching new techniques such as the “blooming effect” and has pursued online studies under the tutelage of the talented Australian artist, Shelee Carruthers, while learning how to implement these techniques with a more Americanized medium that highlights her own vision and artistic distinction. As such, Janna does not believe in limiting herself and finds innovative methods to drive her artistic abilities including the utilization of household items such as craft sticks, pins, toothpicks, straws, yarn, water bottles, and paper towels to create unique works of art.\n\nWithin the past two years, Janna has entered her paintings to multiple art festivals and has been accepted by each jury including the Catalina Festival of Art, Calabasas Fine Arts Festival, and Laguna Art-A-Fair. She continues to participate in various art walks and fairs throughout the Southern California region and was recently a featured artist at the Mar Vista Music & Art Walk. Janna Passion Art has been displayed at Stay Gallery in Downey, CA and is currently on display at Catalina Art Gallery in Avalon, CA. In addition to her fervor for art, Janna also believes in giving back to the community and has donated artwork for multiple silent auctions with proceeds going to the Los Angeles County Public Housing Student Scholarship as well as the Catalina Art Association, a non-profit organization raising art scholarship funds for children.\n\nJanna continues to expand her artistic horizons and finds inspiration in cultivating her artistic passion while sharing it with others so that it can provide them with the same feeling of joy that she experiences when creating each unique piece.\n\nWelcome to the world of Janna Passion Art!\n\nwww.jannapassionart.com\n\nwww.instagram.com/jannapassionart\n\nwww.facebook.com/jannapassionart\n\nACRYLIC PAINTING\n\nBOOTH D4\n\nDebbie Avoux-Davis “the Octopus Painter”, is an acrylic artist based out of Orange County, California. She grew up in the SF Bay Area. Upon graduation from the Academy of Art College in SF she moved to SoCal and started her mural painting business. During her 34 years as a muralist she also opened up her own art studio where she taught classes to kids and adults. All of this while continuing to create custom commissioned artwork for clients across the US. She has worked with individual collectors, designers, businesses and many celebrity clients.\n\nBut she is beyond excited to finally be creating her own series of paintings titled, “The Octo Collection”, where you’ll find an array of colorful octopus designs with a touch of whimsy.\n\nShe discovered her love for octopuses several years ago after watching the Netflix documentary, “My Octopus Teacher”. From there she was hooked.\n\nWhat she found was that octopuses are very misunderstood creatures. They are loving and peaceful, playful and creative, clever and incredibly intelligent. They are masters at camouflaging themselves with the ability to change form and shape and change their colors, patterns and even the texture of their skin in an instant. According to Debbie, this is one of the things that makes them so much fun to paint. They take on so many different poses and shapes the possibilites for designs are endless.\n\n“When I paint an octopus I see a character and I try to bring that out in my designs. I see a dancer, a karate master, a peaceful meditator, a sneaky spy, a cowboy, a meistro....I could go on and on and on.”\n\nAnd for a fun little bonus when viewing Debbie’s artwork, she hides 3 hearts in every one of her designs because octopuses also have 3 hearts. Can you spot them?\n\nDebbie now resides between Orange County and San Diego with her husband Christian, kids Reed and Brielle and their crazy French Bulldog named Poet with as many visits as possible to TX and CO to visit their two grown daughters Jayley and Maddie.\n\nDebbieAvoux.com\n\nFacebook: debbieavouxstudio\n\nInstagram: debbieavouxstudio\n\nLinkedIn: Debbie Avoux-Davis\n\nRELIEF (REPUJADO)\n\nBooth B30\n\nCelebrating 27 Years at the Laguna Art-A-Fair (1998—2024)\n\nThis unique collection by Latin American Repujado artist, Miguel Borbolla, features a low-relief style sculpture that is rarely seen in the United States, and that many collectors consider a new form of art. Actually, repujado is a distinct bas-relief sculpture that has been around for many centuries and may still be found in parts of Europe and Latin America.\n\n“Repujado” means “to give depth to”, and as an artist, Miguel Borbolla brings the beauty of his art to life by crafting extraordinary figures out of various metals such as tin, copper, and aluminum. Rather than carving external shapes from a desired medium and then creating castings from heavy molds, the repujado is individually crafted by hammering, pounding, or pressing desired motifs through a process that pushes the work out from the reverse side of the metals used.\n\nThe technique of repujado is derived from the French-rooted word that describes “repoussé” and dates back to pre-Christian times. For Miguel Borbolla, “The art of repujado is much more than just creating figures on a sheet of metal. With this art, you can express your feelings in the details of a landscape or in the features of a portrait, and bring them to life in each carving.”\n\nMiguel Borbolla comes from Veracruz, Mexico where he learned the art of repujado as it has been passed down from family to family, and from generation to generation over many centuries. As a small child, Miguel’s earliest memories are of making figures such as animals, houses, and village scenes from clay found mostly in the dirt streets of Paso del Macho, a Mexican village just thirty miles west of the port of Veracruz. He often looked forward to trips throughout the countryside with his father, where the different styles of local artisans inspired him. Later, he studied repujado from his sister while drawing from the work of other Latin American artists.\n\nAccording to Miguel Borbolla, “Every single detail of raising or sinking in the sheet of metal bears an important personal message. When I do my art, I feel that those innermost feelings of mine come out and are expressed on the metal as a part of my life. Actually, I feel that the most unreachable challenges of my life can be accomplished through the world of my art.”\n\nwww.miguelborbolla.com/\n\nfacebook.com/miguelborbollaartistaderepujado\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-borbolla-9297a420/\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-borbolla-9297a420/\n\nDIGITAL\n\nBooth A4\n\nDreams are easy to have, but complicated to live.

Her personal struggle with dyslexia has been the driving force to be a creative problem solver and artist. Kt’s confusion and comprehension reflect the layers of her unique understanding of life.\n\nKt’s work this year is about her journey of communication with words. The images will lead you down paths to discover your own unique meaning and conclusions based on your own perception and comprehension of letter and word organization.\n\nKt hopes her art provides peace and she invites you to Relax, Renew, Reflect and Follow Your Dreams while rediscovering yourself through her work!\n\nKtboyceart@yahoo.com\n\n818 823-6007\n\nWATERCOLOR • ACRYLIC\n\nBooth D5\n\nKim was born in Hermosa Beach, Ca and currently resides in Dana Point, Ca, a beautiful seaside town that has inspired artists for decades. It is here that Kim continues her life long journey in the arts, brushes firmly grasped, paints shimmering in the coastal light. Kim grew up in a family of talented artists, each contributing their own vision to Kim’s expanding pallet of skills. Kim was hooked at a very early age. Drawing and painting became second nature. In high school she took every art class available and her success there prompted her to attend the most prestigious art college in the nation, Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Once she hit the open market her newly honed graphic skills landed her smack center of the computer graphics boom of the mid 1980s.\n\nKim prospered in the Interactive media environment and by 1995 she opened her own Multimedia Interactive firm, creating everything from website applications, videos, to e-Learning modules. But always present in Kim’s work was her passion for the ability of art itself to help communicate complex concepts through well thought out, well-designed visuals, be it a video, website or an instructional module.. Her art-sense shines through all her commercial work.\n\nAfter selling her company and moving to Orange County California, Kim returned to her family roots and once again picked up her brushes. With the trying, high-pressure days of commercial art behind her, she has focused on the more sublime aspects of art. With incredible deftness of hand Kim is able to capture the fleeting emotions of her subjects with the arduous demands of watercolor and acrylics, be they humans or animals.\n\nKim’s inquisitive eye seeks out and captures a wistful moment receiving First Communion, or the most gleeful glance of a jumping Dachshund.\n\nAnd international associations and galleries have taken notice. Her International Award Winning Art was featured in North Light Books’ hardbound showcase of the best of the Best in Contemporary Acrylic- AcrylicWorks 5. She has shown in The LagunaArt Gallery - Artist Studio, in Laguna Beach, Ca, Las Laguna Gallery,- Laguna Art A Fair and The Brandon Gallery. and she a member of the Dana Point Art Association.\n\nideaforu.com\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nBooth D21\n\nIn his photography, Mike’s aim is to capture and share with others the tremendously exhilarating, yet calming impact he experiences when he discovers the “right” scene. He finds “right” to be often indefinable. Sometimes it is a magical quality of light on what would otherwise be an ordinary subject. Other times it is the dynamics of the composition, a breathtaking display of nature, the beauty found in some of mankind’s creations - or some combination of these. Sometimes it is just “right”. In many cases the image is clearly evident at the moment. In many other cases, he knows he will have to wait or revisit the scene later for better lighting or more interesting weather conditions. Whatever the case, the image is there - just waiting to be appreciated and captured.\n\nHe and his wife, Pat, travel to many areas of the United States and other countries in their photographic quests. They find the combination of photography and exploration of new places make any vacation or road trip doubly enjoyable. His image catalog features many locations including California, a host of national parks, the Southwest, New England, the Northwest, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand, Iceland, Canada, China and the tiny Indian Ocean atoll of Diego Garcia. “Old stuff” continually intrigues him - vintage cars and aircraft, doors, old buildings always beckon.\n\nIn a “previous life”, Mike was a Navy pilot, test pilot and Intelligence Officer. He also spent 24 years in aerospace industry advanced projects.\n\nwww.cahillphoto.com\n\nMIXED MEDIA • WATERCOLOR\n\nBooth B3\n\nWorkshop Instructor - sign up here\n\nAgnes is a brilliant artist who began her art career in her fifties. Her preferred medium is watercolor and collage and the subject matter centers around her diverse world travels. She first became interested in the arts while serving in the Foreign Service of the US State Department in the late 1950's. Stationed in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia and to pass the time, she subscribed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's twenty-four month portfolio course in Art History. While with the Foreign Service she also had the opportunity to travel extensively throughout Europe; these travels left a lasting impression and continue to influence her work today.\n\nAfter returning to the United States, she resumed her education at Temple University, where she studied Art History, Art Appreciation and Design Esthetics. After which she continued her art exploration at Southwestern Junior College where she dabbled in ceramics. At Saddleback College she pursued printmaking and at UCI, where she took several drawing classes. She also studied with a number of famed artists like Roger Armstrong, Robert E. Wood, Frank Webb, Charles Reid and Christopher Schink. These workshops and experiences were vital to her growing art career.\n\n\"My favorite paintings are scenes of life expressed with a whimsical view. Creating my own interpretation rather than being slavishly adherent to reality is my challenge. The physical challenges of an aging body that does not want to stand up at an easel have led me to my current body of work which is paper collage on canvas with acrylic inks and acrylic paints. I love collecting the art papers and learning about them. Many of the papers are from Japan, Thailand and India. The papers are made from many different plant fibers and use many different methods of print decoration. The collage media is very dependent upon strong composition, design, texture and color. I thoroughly enjoy this process.\"\n\nOIL\n\nBooth C8\n\nArt critics say:\n\n“Step into a world where sunlight kisses fur and feathers, where eyes whisper secrets of the wild. This is the haven Laura Curtin Ross creates on canvas, a realm where realism and magic dance in perfect harmony. Each brushstroke is a love letter to nature, capturing not just the form of an animal, but its soul. Gaze into one of her paintings and you might swear you saw a flicker of movement, a bird taking flight in the blink of an eye.\n\nLaura’s journey as an artist began in the quiet communion with nature. Primarily self-taught in wildlife painting, over the past 38 years she honed her skills by observing, absorbing, and translating the whispers of the wild onto canvas. Her paintings become portals, inviting you to trek alongside mountain lions bathed in moonlight, to giggle with an elephant family welcoming a pink-hued miracle.\n\nBut Laura’s art is more than just beauty. It’s a story whispered in rustling leaves, a lullaby sung by wind through pines. Each detail, from the glint in an eagle’s eye to the delicate moss on a rock, speaks of a world teeming with life, a world worth cherishing and protecting.\n\nThis passion fuels Laura’s dedication to wildlife conservation. A portion of her proceeds finds its way to sanctuaries like Herd Elephant Orphanage and Forever Wild, nurturing creatures who have lost their way home. She actively supports Breast Cancer Awareness groups, reflecting her commitment to making a positive impact beyond the canvas.\n\nLaura’s art is not just a visual feast; it’s an invitation to step into a world where nature reigns supreme, a world where every breath is a reminder of the magic that surrounds us. So come, take a closer look, and let Laura’s brushstrokes guide you on a journey to the soul of the wild.”\n\nlcurtin.com\n\nfacebook.com/lauracurtinwildlifeart\n\ninstagram.com/lauracurtinart/\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nBooth B18\n\nEach of us sees our environment through a unique pair of eyes that filter and interpret our impressions of the world, guided by a lifetime of experience and emotion. As a software engineer for most of my career, this simple truth was sadly hidden from me. Only with the advent (and affordability) of digital photography did my deep-seated need to create and share these impressions make itself known.\n\nWhen others view the images we make, they see more than a flower, a face or a mountain top. They see how life has painted and shaped us, how it has altered our thoughts and emotions, how it has established our dreams and fears, how it has set our goals and regrets, for good or ill.\n\nWhat you see in this collection will give you a glimpse of the world through my eyes. I hope you’ll find something of value, that you’ll be inspired, uplifted, challenged or at least changed in some way and that, perhaps, you may find a work of art that deserves a place in your home or place of business.\n\nMore than anything else, I trust that you will take inspiration here, using whatever medium best suits you -- the visual arts, music, physical creations, science and technology, the written or spoken word -- to go and inspire others. Any means of expression is valid, so long as you say what you were created to say.\n\nrddphoto.com\n\nFacebook: rddphoto/photos\n\nInstagram: rddphoto/\n\nWOODWORK\n\nBooth C10\n\nI grew up in Northern California in a town called Chico. Let’s adjust the WABAC Machine..we are quickly on our way in no time at all to when I was introduced into the world of industrial arts, starting the eighth grade at Bidwell Junior High School. The classes that hooked me were wood shop, metal shop, mechanical drawing, and small gas engines.\n\nDuring the first year of wood shop, we were only allowed to use hand tools. The instructors demonstrated the use of each and every tool as we all made the same project. The following year, power tools came into play and I made several small items including a black walnut coffee table for the house. At the end of the year my project was judged as the best, and I was awarded the Golden Hammer trophy.\n\nNow on to Chico High School wood shop, and what an award-winning program it was. I’ll never forget our teacher, Mr. Holt. The man knew all the ins and outs of wood working.\n\nAlso on campus was a club called the Vocational Industrial Clubs of America (VICA), now known as SkillsUSA. I joined this club and competed in the field of Carpentry. Of the three years going all the way to the State competition, I was the California State Champion Gold Medalist each year.\n\nBy my senior year, I had arrived. I was now the top dog in the wood shop building. But Mr. Holt put me in my place. The only B grade I received throughout my senior year was early in the semester and only in wood shop. I asked Mr. Holt, “Why? No one else can do what I can do.” Then he asked me, “But are you doing what you can do?” I’ll never forget those words. From then on I never settled for good. My work will always be the best! I didn’t send one project to the fair that year, I sent two. Still in use by my family, one is a reverse bow front black walnut china hutch, and the other is a grandmother clock which I gave to my Uncle Dave and Aunt Linda.\n\nThe hutch not only came back with a First Place ribbon, but also the Grand Award Best in Show of the Industrial Arts exhibit. Two months later we sent the hutch to the California State Fair. The judges wrote that it was flawless, and it appeared in the newspaper showing off its First Place award. Wow! another Gold Medal.\n\nSo where has my work been since then? Why haven’t you seen my custom wood work at any fairs or exhibitions? Well, let’s see.. After 6 Golden Hammer awards and 4 Gold Medals, the last one being from the California State Fair and Exposition, anything else would be like trading down.\n\nBut now after many years of construction and custom stair building, I’m back! Since 2012, I have been showing my work at the Laguna Art-A-Fair, Anaheim Art Crawl Experience (ACE), and Warehouse of Contemporary Art (WOCA).\n\nI have spoken\n\nAs with all things, we come full circle through the Time Continuum..and the wood I now use is repurposed, scrap, fire, reused, it’s all “landfill-friendly.” Go Green!\n\nThis is the way!\n\nLeonard Duarte\n\nbeyondtheboxww.com\n\nfacebook.com/ljdwoodworking\n\ninstagram.com/leonard.j.duarte/\n\nCERAMICS\n\nBooth C13\n\nCarrie’s journey into the world of art is as unique as her creations. Her initial foray was through the elegant world of dance. Training to be a professional ballerina well into her late 20s, the fluid grace of ballet became her first artistic expression. As she danced, another interest kindled within her—the world of costume design. The hours between rigorous rehearsals saw her dabble in knitting and quilting, each stitch and pattern echoing her innate creativity.\n\nInspiration from Travel\n\nFor Carrie, the world is a canvas, and travel is the brush that paints her imagination. A trip to Barcelona, Spain, brought her face to face with the masterpieces of Antonio Gaudi. The vibrant colors, abstract materials, and unique designs of Gaudi’s work sparked a new passion within her—the art of mosaics and mosaic sculptures. This inspiration didn’t remain confined to a single art form. As the world grappled with the pandemic, Carrie’s artistic journey took another turn, leading her to mix media and assemblage art.\n\nA Sanctuary in Ceramics\n\nAs the constraints of COVID-19 eased, Carrie discovered her community’s ceramic studio. This became her sanctuary, a place where she could combine various art forms, materials, and styles, crafting pieces that told tales of her vast artistic journey.\n\nHer philosophy is clear: art should not confine itself to singular expressions. For Carrie, limitations are but challenges to overcome. “I have never liked to limit myself to one style or medium,” she says. “Art should never be boring.” And true to her word, her works are a vibrant dance of colors, materials, and undeniable expressions that capture the observer’s attention.\n\nA Continuous Journey\n\nCarrie’s story is one of continuous learning and evolution. Her insatiable curiosity and drive to innovate have led her to explore various mediums and styles. From the poised elegance of ballet to the tactile delight of ceramics, her journey is an inspiration for budding artists and art enthusiasts alike.\n\nFor a closer look at Carrie Eckert’s masterpieces and to delve deeper into her world, visit her website: Carrie Eckert Art.\n\ncarrieeckertart.com\n\nFacebook: Carrie Eckert Art\n\nInstagram: Carrie_eckert_art\n\nDRAWING • OIL • WATERCOLOR\n\nBooth B31\n\nWorkshop Instructor – sign up here\n\nNatalia Eremeyeva-Duarte was born in the town of Nizhniy Tagil, Russia. Her artistic life began when she was a young girl. Her home city has a rich cultural history where she graduated from the School of Fine Arts where she learned drawings, paintings, sculpture and the history of art. The time she spent in this school was an invaluable creative experience.\n\nShe always knew her life would in some way be connected with art.\n\nGraduated from the Ural Academy of Architecture and Arts, she studied not only architecture, but drawing and painting as well. The Academy gave her a broad knowledge base which helped her during her 19 years practice as an architect.\n\nWhile Natalia studied at the architectural academy, she worked as an artist’s assistant for two seasons in the artistic-decorative department at the main Opera Theater in Ekaterinburg.\n\nIt was a great experience to meet new and creative people and to know the theatrical side of art.\n\nAs a student she had a chance to work as a mural artist creating wall paintings in kinder gardens.\n\nWorking as an architect for over 19 years in Syktyvkar (Russia), she was always interested in art. During her practice as an architect she always had time for drawing, most of them were just quick sketches or watercolors. But she has learned from her experience that only by practice can one’s drawings improve through intuition and a sense of proportion.\n\nNatalia always used any chance to travel. Traveling to new places where she receives inspiration for her art work. She has been to many old cities in the east of Russia and also west of the Baltic States. Excursions through Europe where there are many old cities with architectural masterpieces. Like other artists, she takes inspiration from the world around her, either big or small.\n\nNow living in California, she has found an ever- growing passion for her artwork. Every painting is a piece of her life, her history, her passion, her soul.\n\nnatalia-duarte.pixels.com/\n\nfacebook.com/nataliaeduartefineart\n\nJEWELRY\n\nBooth B29\n\nWorkshop Instructor - sign up here\n\nI have always been interested in the arts and from a very early age made drawings for classmates and friends. In 9ths grade one of my paintings was chosen to hang in the Albright Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York.\n\nAfter moving to California I helped a friend at the Los Angeles Gift Show in the Biltmore Hotel. I purchased a beautiful strand of Copal and other African beads and made necklaces for friends and family. A short time later I was admiring some Amber at a Kiosk and instead of picking one piece I ended up buying all the Amber and began my career in jewelry making.\n\nJewelry design came naturally to me, but I quickly became dissatisfied with purchased findings and chains so I took formal classes. My classes with Lynne Merchant in San Diego and Peter Solomon at his Precious Metals studio in Santa Monica were instrumental in allowing me to make the kind of jewelry that I designed..\n\nMy one of a kind jewelry sold from coast to coast in boutiques, gift and home shows and flourished until Covid quickly brought it to a halt. My jewelry was accepted for the 2022 Art-A-Fair show in Laguna beach and I found a welcoming home for jewelry.\n\nOIL PAINTING\n\nBooth B23\n\nArt to me is about time. Having spent a lifetime contemplating how I feel about what I see, makes me realize that these images are fleeting to say the least. Each step of creating a painting is a celebration as well as an examination of the subject along the way to completion. Taking time to examine something beautiful and yet fleeting is this artist’s attempt at passing forward my appreciation of moments that provide visual as well as visceral joy. My hope is to slow down time long enough for a viewer to notice the beauty that is around us. By examining the small things that we take for granted, I hope to capture and present them long enough to hold onto so they may be revisited again and again.\n\nAs I turn around and prepare to leave the party, my paintings are celebrations of the last things I’ve observed.”\n\n_______________\n\nRoger earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from The University of the Arts in Philadelphia.

Close to the beach, but not where the cars are always gridlocked. At the center of my universe you’ll find my family, my dogs, and my lifelong love for the outdoors. I was introduced to art in my early years, experimenting with charcoal, ink, pencils, animation, and digital music production. With each learned medium, my canvas expanded exponentially and sharpened my creative process.\n\nPhotography was the final frontier and proved to be the most challenging. I failed repeatedly until I mastered the technical skills of my new tool. As I began to document the world around me, I found myself combining all of my creative tools to experience life in a new way.\n\nNow my lens is focused on the great outdoors. As a nature photographer, my goal is to transport you to a place that feels like an intersection between a dream and reality. Whether it be a national park, a coastal scene, or even a slice of heaven in the most unlikely location, I want to leave the viewer with a sense of wonder that invites them to disconnect from the everyday hustle and ignite their passion to explore the wonder of the world.\n\nToday, I connect the dreamers with the outside by bringing it into their homes. Nature soothes the soul, brings peace to the mind, and inspires big dreams.\n\neddiegj.com\n\nInstagram: eddieknights\n\nWATERCOLOR • OIL\n\nBooth A17\n\nI have enjoyed working with watercolor for many years. Just a few years ago I began adding oil paintings to my body of work. Each medium brings a freshness to my paintings. I believe that any ability I have is a wonderful gift of God. While mostly self-taught I continue to attend classes and demonstrations given by artists in Southern California. I am always looking for ways to bring more of that beauty to my paintings.\n\nThis summer will be my 31st year as an exhibitor in Art A Fair. I have been a member of the Saddleback Art League and am an award-winning participant in local art shows. My paintings of felines began when our first kitten showed up at our front door needing a hoe. My paintings reflect my love for cats and kittens. We have had many cats over time; most of which have been strays that just \"show up\". I enjoy doing pet portraits of all kinds for other pet lovers. I have been told that my landscapes are places that are peaceful and reflect the beauty of God’s wonderful creation. I like capturing the colors of nature and light filtering down in the scene. California offers so many beautiful locations to inspire artists.\n\npathaasartist.com\n\nWATERCOLOR\n\nBooth B22\n\nGrowing up across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky, Teressa Jackson spent her youth collecting rocks and painting portraits and imaginary mountain landscapes. She received a B.A. in studio art (painting emphasis) from Bellarmine University in 1998, then worked for 20 years in Louisville’s nonprofit sector. In 2017, she returned to her roots, spending a full year traveling the western U.S. and Caribbean and creating over 100 paintings during that journey. Teressa and her husband then relocated to Arizona, where they lived for four years before moving to Costa Mesa, California. She is a lover of solitude, wide open spaces, and wildness, and remains a self-proclaimed “desert rat” even if most of her art finds its inspiration in coastal California nowadays.\n\nTeressa’s work has been featured on the cover of the Tucson Weekly; in CanvasRebel, ShoutoutArizona, and Voyage Phoenix; and has been shown at the Phoenix Airport Museum at Sky Harbor International Airport, FOUND:RE Contemporary, Crystal Cove State Park, the Tubac Center of the Arts, and Huntington Beach Art Center. One of her miniature paintings received the City Hall Choice Award in the 2023 Art That’s Small at City Hall exhibition at Laguna Beach City Hall.\n\nArtist’s Statement\n\nAs a child, my imagination was captured by the concept of pointillism, gazing in awe at Seurat’s A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. As an adult, I became a collector of folk and outsider art, drawn to its authentic expression, bright colors, and bold patterns. Studying nature has shown me that pattern and repetition are very natural concepts, occurring all around us. These interests and inclinations have shaped my painting subjects, style, and use of color.\n\nWorking in richly pigmented transparent watercolor and gouache (opaque watercolor) paint, my work is primarily focused on my whimsical view of the natural world. All of my paintings are created using strictly my own original photography, life, or my imagination as reference. I have fallen into a niche of creating miniature paintings, most of which measure just 2x3”. I have always loved creating detailed work and have often had difficulty knowing when to stop adding little touches to a painting. A miniature scale provides a profound restriction in which to create a compelling scene. I believe that working in a small scale and incorporating intricate details into my paintings has the lovely effect of forcing both the artist and the viewer to slow down, just like the wild places I seek to depict in my work. To truly see the piece, you must pause and take a moment – breathe, gaze, wonder – something most of us don’t do often enough.\n\nTeressaLJackson.com\n\nfacebook.com/teressajacksonart\n\ninstagram.com/teressajacksonart/\n\nCERAMICS • GOURDS • MIXED MEDIA • JEWELRY\n\nBooth D22\n\nWorkshop Instructor – sign up here\n\nMerilou has been a practicing artist and teacher for over 40 years journeying through different materials, media, influences and forms.

Leon is an established California artist, who has been a dedicated, working artist for over 40 years. She has amassed a wealth of skills, developed original techniques, won numerous awards, created several large-scale public art installations and has several works of art in permanent museum collections. Growing up in San Francisco in the 1960’s, an early interest in physics, meta-physics and art led her to study sculpture, painting and glass with an emphasis on light at California State University at Chico, 1976-1979 and 1984-1988. A brief artist-in-residency in the physics department gave Leon the background to integrate the use of light’s pure color into her artworks. Leon has maintained her art studio in San Diego since 1991.\n\nOne of Leon’s greatest professional honors was collaborating with Judy Chicago, world famous for her feminist works of the 1970’s and one of the significant influences on Leon’s own work. In 1997 through 2003, several collaborative projects including limited editions, large sculptures and an architectural installation bring together the powerful visual statements of Judy Chicago with the compelling qualities of Leon’s glass art.\n\nIn 2012 Leon was awarded the Creative Catalyst Grant for Innovation, through the San Diego Foundation. She practiced a unique combination of hands-on skills, methods and processes including intricate sand-erosion carving, airbrush painting and scientific technology which produces a crystalline structure that has a distinctive, luminous glow. Leon’s innovative approach brings light’s pure beauty into the fine art context. She strives for the light, both physically and metaphorically.\n\nIn addition to glass and mixed media, Leon presents two lines of jewelry, Vicki Leon OriginalsTM, which is informed by the abstract and symbolic style of her years as a dedicated sculptor and Luminous Crystal CarvingsTM, which are hand-carved Swarovski crystals.\n\nwww.vickileonartist.com\n\nOIL PAINTING\n\nBooth D20\n\nSusan Lim was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. She moved to the United States for college and graduated with a Bachelor degree in Film Scoring at Berklee College of Music. Though she quickly learned that she did not have the personality for the entertainment industry. Reviving her interest in fashion, she started an online fashion retail business and it lasted for 15 years. She ended up closing the business after she got married as she couldn’t focus all of her time on it.\n\nWithout the stress of managing a business, she was pregnant and geared up for motherhood, but had a miscarriage 3 months into it. She was devastated and that Christmas, received a gift certificate for art classes from her father-in-law and began taking lessons studying classical oil painting at Kline Academy in Culver City, February of 2018. She has been obsessed with everything art ever since and thinks that art saved her from that deep dark place. She attended weekly classes on and off for a year, and thereafter attended workshops from re-known artists she admires.\n\nThe pandemic lockdown in the year 2020 helped jump start her art career when she offered to paint a portrait for a donation to Feeding America on Instagram. She painted 9 portraits of people and pets for that campaign. Since then, she has been commissioned to paint portraits for friends, family, and clients from Instagram. Her painting “Lean On Me” received honorary mention by Portrait Society of America’s members only competition in 2021.\n\nSusan’s painting style is a blend of classical, realism and impressionism. Initially, her paintings looked a lot like photographs. But eventually she realized that a painting should look more painterly throughout, but with a focal point that has more details.\n\nHer favorite subjects are people, as there are so many stories untold within our faces. She has been creating conceptual and figurative art with her own ideas to tell stories using photography and composites through Photoshop. These photos are then turned into beautiful paintings. She is in the middle of creating two series of paintings with flowers and beauty. She believes that the world needs more beautiful art as we all strive to make it a better place.\n\nWebsite: susanlimfineart.com\n\nInstagram: @art.susanlim\n\nFacebooks: art.susanlim"
