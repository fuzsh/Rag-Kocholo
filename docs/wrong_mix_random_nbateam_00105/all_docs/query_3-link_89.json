        "text": "Daddy,\n\nI’d like to think I became a good listener over the years.\n\nYears ago, when you were telling me the details of your childhood, I made sure to dial in to every word you were saying. You talked about how as kids in the Duvaliers’ Haiti, you and Lionel wore out your shoes walking from home to school, then from school to home for manje midi [lunch], from home to school again, then from school to home again, each walk lasting an hour every day. You told me how, when you got a little bit older, Grandma made the difficult decision to leave you guys behind in Haiti temporarily as she traveled to the United States to make enough money to one day put you guys on a plane to be reunited with her there. I listened with quiet concern as you described the couple — family members — who “watched over you,” stating that, while they were outwardly friendly and trustworthy enough for Grandma to entrust you to their care, they were dark and twisted behind the scenes. That they would feed you and Lionel once a day, at night, and not bother to pay the school tuition fees.\n\nBy comparison, I was born into an incredibly fortunate situation. Obviously we had been moving around a lot when I was little — from our apartment in Pomona, NY, from one house to another in Waterbury, CT, and then later to the condo in Danbury where Kojo, Kofi, and I would spend our formative years, but I was entirely too young to remember that now and to have been able to comprehend it then, much less be stressed out by it then. We were never rich, but whatever toys we wanted, we could get. Whatever video games and systems we wanted, we could get. Whatever food we wanted, we could get. You had asked me a couple of times why, rather than eat the items on my plate altogether little by little, I would eat in a sequence, saving the meat for last. You remarked how in Haiti, because meat was by far the most expensive food item, it was something you only got to eat on special occasions and holidays, and how, when those came, you and your siblings would tear into it. I’ve gotten better at it now but from time to time, unconsciously, I will still leave the meat untouched until the main item is gone. I’m a creature of habit, I guess.\n\nOne of, if not the first thing you would tell any of yours and Mommy’s friends about me as I always just kind of sheepishly listened was, “I read him a book one night when he was three years old and a few nights later he started reading the book to me.” You encouraged my two great loves as a child — dinosaurs and animals. You remarked how, when we went to a museum, the educator was impressed with how I was able to identify the various dinosaur skeletons. And of course, you knew how excited I would get for the next episode of The Most Extreme on Animal Planet every Tuesday night. I don’t remember quite what it was but in one of the days during COVID lockdown, something made me bemoan the fact that I was nowhere near as knowledgeable on animals and the like as I was when I was younger. You simply assured me that as you get older, your interests change. But you know how I can be; I can get nostalgic and long for the past. That is in large part how this tribute to our relationship came about. Lately, I find myself harking back to the little things from my, Kojo, and Kofi’s upbringing as your sons. The times Kojo and I would play Brick Breaker on your work phone, the flip phone. All of the places we used to frequent in Danbury that have long since closed — Blockbuster, RadioShack, Bertucci’s. The times we would sit down together to watch Dennis the Menace and Uncle Buck together. Especially Uncle Buck — it never gets old. All the times Aki and Paw Paw were plastered on our TV screen. Even if I’ve never liked Nollywood (or Ghallywood) movies, the actors playing those characters never ceased to make me smile from ear to ear, nor did they cease to make you laugh in that hearty laugh of yours. How could I forget the beach field trip we had when I was in preschool, seeing that horseshoe crab? I’m glad we brought Kojo along for the ride on that one for it to be etched into his memory as well. Or the time you killed that snake in the backyard with the machete? At the time, I thought that was the coolest thing ever. I remember the times we would go to WalMart in the days leading up to school reopening to buy new supplies. Saint Peter’s was never easy about their color coding. “I need a red notebook for math, and a green one for social studies. We can never find the orange one for science.” Those were simpler times.\n\nI asked you quite a few times as a kid, “Daddy, why is education so important?” And although I may have sounded like a broken record asking the same question repeatedly, you never hesitated to give a thoughtful answer, the answer being the same, but different, every time. The essence of the answer was the same, but each time you added a new twist or a new element to it to make me stop, think, and really absorb what it was you were saying. You had such a breadth of knowledge and a ton of thoughts deep down in your mind with which you were always happy to share with me. On Haiti, on Africa, on American imperialism, on African-American leaders and inventors. It was from you that I learned that the traffic signal, ice cream, and open-heart surgery, among other things, were African-American inventions/innovations (Augustus Jackson, Garrett Morgan, and Daniel Hale Williams, respectively). I will forever be grateful for that. It didn’t surprise me when Uncle Lionel told me you originally wanted to be a teacher. I don’t know what at grade level you wanted to teach, but I do remember how you told me the high school kids drove you mad in that one class you were a substitute teacher all the way back in the 80s. I can only imagine what that must have been like.\n\nThe Christmas break during my third grade year was the second time you and Mommy took Kojo, Kofi, and I to Ghana. I try not to think about that trip — it was too sullied by winter homework. I like to look back, rather, at our first time. Mommy and Kofi had flown ahead of you, Kojo, and I. The three of us flew direct with Delta, I believe it was, in a time where in-flight meals were at the very least serviceable. After Kojo and I enjoyed a buttermilk pancake breakfast, we landed at Kotoka for our first time, and from there, our lives were forever changed for the better. Our landing there in the summer two years ago felt as though we had never left from that first vacation. The palm trees, the communal values and mentality held by the people, the street vendors, the humid climate, the torrential downpours — all of it immediately recognizable from the first trip to the last. Ghana always brought out a a different side of you — a freer side of you. In the mornings, either, if not both Kojo or I would press you to take us out to buy hot oven bread. From there we would walk the streets of Accra to our designated bread spot as the rooster’s crow echoed throughout the cityscape. You’d talk a little with the woman selling and with bread in hand, we’d walk back to our place of stay. You gave us our first taste of alcohol as you poured beer over heads in celebration. And, in Ghana, you had ready access to the fruits you ate in every day in Haiti. It was home over 4,000 miles from your birthplace, but home nonetheless. As for us, while we basked in the natural elements of it, there were some things it took us time to get used to, namely the intermittent switching off of the power that then, could last several days. As a kid coming from America, it was hard not to make a fuss about this. But with each successive trip, I underwent a slow but sure death of ego and replacement of it with real humility, as I looked back to my younger years and thought, “What was I really complaining about?” If the people who live there everyday are not complaining, but rather making do with the situation the best they can, at some point it behooves me to keep your my mouth shut. What may have been an inconvenience for me is a way of life for others. I remember on the plane back to the U.S. during our 2017 trip hearing some American girls talking about how they couldn’t wait to get back to running water, and thought to myself, “What if we had went to Ghana for the first time as teenagers? What would our impressions of it would be?” Would it have been more of an acquired taste rather than love at first sight? Would we have allowed the inconveniences to completely drown out the beauty?\n\nI remember the second semester of that third grade year, when we were having a book fair in school. I had told you over the phone I was going to buy a book on Transformers, a book on animals, and a third book that’s escaped me. I ended up buying the book on Transformers, a book on rock instruments, and a third book that was far from the third book I told you about. To say you were pissed would be an understatement. You immediately took me back to the book fair to exchange the books I had bought for the ones I told you I was going to get. Unfortunately by then, they had closed. You wanted to know why I had bought books different from the ones I had stated, and while I didn’t give you a straight answer, I know you already knew the reason. I bought the books the other boys were buying. If I had asked you if you remembered that day, I know without a doubt you would have said yes. And you would have echoed the same thing you said at the time. Just be yourself.\n\nFourth grade was a little bit harder than third. I didn’t make the advanced math class. One-on-one with Mrs. McCarthy, I had called myself stupid for failing to figure out a problem. I didn’t expect that she would relay that back to you in the parent-teacher conference. You called me out for having low self esteem. To you, I was brilliant no matter what. But more importantly, I was someone worthy of love no matter what. You simply wanted me to see in myself what you saw in me from the beginning.\n\nThe times where you and Uncle Justice would watch fútbol together and fill our house or his house with anticipatory noise always made Kojo and I look at each other or at Mommy with smiles on our faces. “There it is! There it is! Ooohh!,” you would exclaim, as the attacking player made a move toward goal only to come up empty. When they did score, you would scream, “GOAL! GOLAZO!” As I was not into sports then, I had always thought to myself that there is no way the things going on in the matches could be so enchanting. But I was wrong. I don’t remember why Kojo and I sat down with you that night in 2012 to watch basketball, but we did. It was the Eastern Conference Semifinals between the Pacers and the Heat with the Big 3 — LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh. Game 4. Kojo and I knew none of the context, none of the ramifications if the Heat lost. All we knew was that you were rooting for the Heat. So we decided to give basketball a try. And like with you and fútbol, we found ourselves becoming enchanted by what we saw. LeBron 40 points. D-Wade 30 points. Breathtaking displays of athleticism, creativity, and processing of the game by both. The contributions of the players around them throughout that playoff run — ‘Rio, UD, Shane Battier, Mike Miller, Norris Cole before his flattop, and Chris Bosh, who, when he returned from injury during the next round, quickly became Kojo’s favorite player on the team. By the time the Heat reached the Finals we were filling the living room with more noise than even you. Chanting the “oh” sounds with the Heat home crowd on TV as Seven Nation Army played during player introductions. It was in Ghana in 2022 where I finally understood the exhilaration that came with fútbol, as you, Kofi, Kojo, I walked over the rough sand at Laboma Beach to get from our table to the beach’s far end where the Black Sharks were playing Egypt in the AFCON qualifiers. I’ve always known that no other sport on Earth generates as many different emotions in a person all in the same game or match as fútbol does. I saw firsthand as the crowd of Ghanaians overlooking the match clapped, sang, drummed, and danced as the players came out to the sandy pitch. They would bemoan the Egyptian goals and raucously celebrate the Ghanaian ones, this going back and forth for a while until hitting a fever pitch, with Ghana scoring the match winning goal. Ghana 6, Egypt 5. I’m so happy we got to share some of the greatest moments in American and world team sports history with you. The 2022 World Cup Final, which lived up live to its post-match billing as the single greatest match ever. Ray Allen’s shot in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals. And of course Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals. The Block by LeBron. The Shot by Kyrie. The Stop by Kevin Love. I never called you out enough for hopping on LeBron’s bandwagon when he left Miami for Cleveland and then again when he left Cleveland for L.A. But I understood. He was your guy. If the Heat don’t win the championship next year, I hope he does. At some point, my basketball acumen had surpassed even yours, and you had the utmost respect for that. Offseason after offseason, from 2019 onward, you asked me, “Kwaku, you think the Lakers should do _____?” And I always loved those conversations.\n\nYou had the ability to walk up to anybody and start a conversation that could last for hours. A friend of mine at UConn Waterbury was just like that, and, reminding me of you in the way he started a conversation and made a friend of me, he made me think to myself, “How do they make it look so easy?” It’s one thing to start a conversation, it’s another thing entirely to keep it going to where it’s a meaningful conversation. It’s never come easily for me. On the other hand, you would marvel at my ability to speak in front of a crowd, saying that doing so always made you nervous. I have the gift of gab, as you call it. I always loved and appreciated how, whenever I told you I may have to speak somewhere, you wanted to take me to wherever that might be. When I said I might speak, you wanted to be the first to listen.\n\nYou were the strongest man in my life; a man’s man. I hardly saw you cry or lose your cool. You weren’t naturally handy, but if anything needed to be put together or fixed around the house, you would always get it done. You were an elite athlete from youth through college, playing basketball and fútbol where you were a striker. A number nine. Since the 2022 World Cup, I’ve studied up a on little bit on fútbol. I learned that the uncle of an African legend you know well, Didier Drogba, told him when he was young, “People only care about the strikers, you need to play up front.” You did that, and you did it extremely well. By comparison, as a kid, I would cry over the littlest things. I could never play organized team sports on account of my condition. I’ll never forget it — the first day of school in eleventh grade, we were in AP Lang. We had been put in pairs to answer questions about ourselves that we would then present to the class, each partner presenting the other’s answers. When asked, “What sports do you play,” I told my partner I played “freelance” basketball. Freelance. How embarrassing. You never put any pressure on me to perform traditional masculinity (aside from telling me to stop crying over little things), and I myself never really cared about machismo or any of that. But when it came to anything athletic, basketball especially, I had become determined to push my physical limits to their zenith.\n\nI remember when we used to play pickup — myself and Kojo vs. you and Kofi. You would whoop our asses and then call me out afterward for being such a sore loser. Eventually I would grow up and when I did, Kojo and I never lost another game to you. Coincidence? I think not. Alright, I’ll give you this — even in the games we won you were cooking us. We simply had no answer for you, the dominating force that you were. You were an offense unto yourself. It took the very best that we had to beat you and even then, we just barely beat you.\n\nUConn Waterbury, 2019. I was playing pickup with some of the guys and girls. I had knocked down a three and hit a Euro-step floater, while locking up on defense as usual. I was feeling myself. But at what cost? When you came to see me that day, you looked like you had seen a ghost, that’s how tired and out of it I was. No justification I could give about pushing back against my limits could satisfy you or make you understand why I would take such a risk. You would always tell me, “Without your health, you cannot have anything.” I have done so well throughout my life that you were more concerned about my health than even I was. And it is only now that you’re with God that I realize that shouldn’t have been the case. For that, I am sorry. I already know what you’re saying, “You don’t have to apologize for anything.”\n\nI always focused so much on what made us different that I overlooked just how alike we really were. Whenever I look in the mirror and I smile, I see you. Nahomie even remarked over the phone that I sound just like you. Uncle Serge says the same thing. Aunt Marlene says the same thing. I’ll give them this — over the phone, my cadence is your cadence. I picked up on that while talking to Nahomie, and it’s quite uncanny. The sound though, I don’t know about that one — I think my voice is too soft.\n\nLearning about your time in college, it became apparent there were times where, yes, you felt like an outsider and where you weren’t allowed to show your true personality. You told us how you had been scared to go away for school and how, when you did, you felt like a fish out of water. The food was different a far cry from what you were used to eating. You had stuck it, but you wanted to go home. As for sports, you stressed to me that after a certain point, you had to quit fútbol because your knees wouldn’t let you do it anymore. You loved it but your body knew it was time to say goodbye. That was what you used to tell me that it was okay to not be an athlete. The same way you put fútbol down to watch it on TV, you said I should simply watch basketball and at most, shoot around.\n\nOur tastes in food were similar. I remember Mommy once remarked “You are your father’s son” based on my willingness to try a certain dish. We both shared the same ambition to try new things. A good example would be the Turkish restaurant we frequented a few times in Waterbury. The food was good in both of our books and it made for quality time together. I also get my music taste from you. It happened starting at an early age, when you and Mommy would play the DVD album in the living room featuring songs by Daddy Lumba, Ofori Amponsah, Kojo Antwi, Kofi B, and all of the other Ghanaian greats of the mid-2000s. Over the years, I cultivated a love of reggae in our one-on-one car rides between Connecticut and New York for appointments and other things. If you didn’t have WBAI on the radio for you and I to learn something, you had the best music on. I was content with either or — it was my favorite part about the drive. I had to tap deep into my memory banks, but I was able to recall a few of the songs on your CDs.\n\n🎵The first cut is the deepest, oh yeah. The first cut is the deepest, but when it comes to seeing lucky people, when it comes to needing needing people, when it comes to seeming lucky people, that’s how I know… the first cut is the deepest… just to have you by my side, just to help me dry the tears that I cry, and I am sure that I will give you a try, if you want to try to love again.🎵 (Marcia Griffiths — The First Cut is the Deepest)\n\nIt’s only now looking back at the titles and everything from those car rides how much of a massive Luciano fan you were. If I had asked you to pick one individual artist as your favorite, you probably would have told me it’s too difficult to pick just one, but I think it has to be him.\n\n🎵Oh, what a wonderful world it would be, a world of love and peace, hmm ya, when no evil can abide, only righteousness and creed, yeah ah, yeah, and we can do it if only believe, yes we can do it if we only agree, it’s your world and mine. Your world and mine, your world and mine…🎵 (Luciano — Your World and Mine)\n\n🎵 I and I must carry on Jah works, woah, Jah send I as a messenger, to teach the youths about roots and culture, an tell di masses fi remember Jah, dats all I a deal wid, iy, yiy🎵 (Luciano — Messenger)\n\n🎵When the going gets rough, the tough gets going, ’cause I never give up my pride, even though I’m broken up inside, I’ll never give up my pride, even though they try to push me aside, I’ll never give up my pride, though at times my world may seem to capsize, I’ll never give up my pride🎵 (Luciano — Never Give Up My Pride)\n\nOf the modern artists, your favorite is definitely Chronixx without a shadow of a doubt. You know the song:\n\n🎵Left, right, Jah soldiers a come, left, right… Here comes trouble, here comes the danger, sent by the savior, welcome the Rasta youths… Rasta recruiting soldiers coming from near and far I choose, executing Selassie I works and build Rastafari troops.🎵\n\nI’m humming the lyrics, smiling from ear to ear writing this.\n\nI’ll never forget 12th grade when I was in Mr. White’s AP Gov class. I was participating in a mock trial of Congressman Matthew Lyon on the charge of Sedition during John Adams’ administration. You met Mr. White at a parent-teacher conference that semester, and you came back to tell me that what he told you had you on the verge of tears: that I had given a better performance during the mock trial than some valedictorians who had come and gone through his class. You remarked how, during one of our parent-teacher conferences, you graced the New Fairfield High School library, and spoke with the then-librarian, Mrs. McKenzie, about us. She had raved to you about our politeness and the manner in which we carried and conducted ourselves, saying how her own children could stand to learn something from it. Early in our lives, you told us how important it was that you attended any and every parent-teacher conference you could, stating doing so would reflect very positively on our entire family. In a country where in spite of the stats, Black men are not considered involved fathers, many people, Black, White, Asian, whatever else, could only dream to have a father like you.\n\nDuring the SEE Fair, one of the New Fairfield assistant principals saw my posterboard rife with documents resembling those I had seen during my time shadowing at the Danbury Probate Court and upon talking to me about it asked, “Are you sure this is what you want to do?” In my head, I’m thinking, “What, you mean probate? Heck no. But law, yes.” Whether the question was well-intentioned or not, I don’t know. I personally do believe he had asked it in good faith. But I told you about it after the fair and you told me not to allow any such questions to discourage me to throw me off of my path.\n\nI had developed a bad case of anxiety from the pandemic which was causing me to withdraw from everyone. To lift my spirits, you said to everyone in the room, “Kwaku has a beautiful heart.” I had always known deep down you thought that of me but hearing it meant the world to me as someone who has always thought people look at my mind before they do my heart. I think I know the moment where “Kwaku has a beautiful heart” became the most true for you. You know how it was at Saint Peter’s, we had to carry a trove of heavy textbooks everywhere, up and down the stairs. On one such stairwell, Steve Santander had dropped his books. Without thinking, I dropped down on my knees beside him to help him pick them up. The principal, Mrs. McCormack, who we were all afraid of for her tough, no-nonsense reputation, took note and let you know of my deed. They have a debate in psychology about how much of your personality is nature versus nurture. That right there is nature. Grandma told me recently how when you were of college age, without a second thought, you volunteered for a program to teach Vietnamese refugees the English language. In Grandma’s words, [you] said “I had to do it.” Grandma never needed to teach you to be selfless, nor did you or Mommy need to teach me. Uncle Yaw told me about how you helped ease his and Auntie Jackie’s transition to the United States, as well as how you helped him get his driver’s license. Uncle Serge always tells me you [are] his best brother. He tells me how you called him every day last year to talk about life and when the World Cup and the Euros were on, to talk about those. I talk to Uncle Serge regularly now, as one of my ways of paying your legacy forward.\n\nUncle Lionel told me about how, as a teenager, you were obsessed with sports, fútbol, basketball, and baseball in particular, and how you could have three games on different screens, each game being from a different sport. He told me how you knew all the players and their statistics. I’m the same way with basketball. Kofi is the same way with fútbol. I will always miss the back-and-forth arguments you two had about which brand of fútbol was superior, European versus South American. Kofi will always say European because of the “tactics,” whatever that means. You will always say South American because you consider the players to be more skillful where the Europeans just “play in the air.” Whatever the case may be, I will defer to your side of the argument as you’ve been watching a lot longer than Kofi has.\n\nUncle Lionel also told me how, when he was teaching you how to drive, he had told you to brake one time, and nervously, you pressed harder on the accelerator which caused you to crash the car through a person’s house. It brought me back to when I was learning to drive under your tutelage. We got on each other’s nerves numerous times, but we persisted and through time, I became good. Mommy remarked that I am a smooth driver, something I have you to thank you for. I don’t believe I could have learned better from anybody else than from you, especially on how to keep my composure on the road against drivers who frankly don’t play by its rules.\n\nJust be yourself. It’s a theme which reverberates throughout our story. My first step towards doing just that was the embracing of my name. The decision to give us each Ghanaian names was yours. As you know, I took me a while to like my name. From constant mispronunciation to a substitute teacher saying aloud before the class they weren’t going to bother to try to say it, I had been at odds with it for a long time. Now I look at it as the best thing you could have done for me. When I become a lawyer, my clients (don’t like the word), people I work with, and so on and so forth will know me not by something so impersonal as Mr. Aurelien but as Kwaku. I think there is something to that. It is my intention now to embrace every part of myself you and Mommy gave me. Looking back at it, one of the worst things I did was to tell the teacher presenting us as we walked at my high school graduation to not say my middle name. Being that I was named for Grandma, Mommy’s mom, who flew from Ghana from my birth despite speaking little English, it behooved me to embrace it then. When the day comes that I walk the stage to graduate from law school, I’m going to make them say it — Kwaku Kyere Aurelien.\n\nKojo had said something a few months back that moved me. He said he looked at your life retrospectively and thought to himself how amazing it was that a poor kid from Port-au-Prince was able to eventually traverse the world, his travels leading him to the Motherland, where he met the woman who would become his wife and have three children with. Although myself, Mommy, Kojo, and Kofi wish that this ordeal had a fairy tale ending and that things were as they used to be right now, your life on Earth did play out like a fairy tale in many ways. Even looking at an album a few months ago, I saw a series of pictures from Ghana I had never seen before. I believe they were taken around the time you and Mommy were getting married. Faces familiar to me and not were represented in those pictures. Of the ones I knew: Uncle Albert, Uncle Yaw, Auntie Teena, Auntie Renee, and of course, Uncle Pancho — your brother from another mother. Everybody looked so happy and bright, and I don’t think it was by accident that each picture had you posing alongside somebody else. Without being there, I know you were the galvanizing force there, bringing everyone together. And with each of them individually one-one-one, I know you regaled them for some time and they never got bored. Additionally, I looked at some of your college-age photos, from back when you wore an afro. I remarked to Mommy how fly you looked. I look good in a suit but I don’t know that I could ever compete with that.\n\nThe condolence written in your obituary which stood out to me was written by one of your coworkers at the Norwalk Public School district. I never met him but it didn’t surprise me to read him say that you had spoken highly to him about us — about Kojo, Kofi, and I — and the accomplishments we were making. Janet, the Nigerian journalist you had told about me some months back, echoed the same thing when I told her you had ascended from this Earth. She wrote to me and I quote, “A passionate father on the lookout for the success of his son is what I remember and will always remember of your father.” I don’t know the details of your conversations, only that you must have been very fervent in sharing my writings for her to make such a strong statement. I don’t have the slightest idea of what it’s like to be a father but I always knew what you told the three of us during your fight to be true — that we [are] your life. It was for this reason why you were so adamant about sharing us with the world. We didn’t always agree with that. Kojo had always been a little guarded with his artwork, masterpieces. As for me, while I never protested you sharing my writings with others, I was beginning to question whether or not there was any value in my writing. After all, is anyone really going to sit down to read long-winded pieces about leftist politics and all that? I missed the mark. Mommy told me, it’s not who reads your work, but rather if I am proud of it myself. To her point, I recently came upon one of my undergrad papers you had printed out and saved. Looking back on it, it’s some of my best work. I don’t know how I didn’t see that before. As far as Kofi, you had sent the essay he wrote on Liverpool’s players and tactics during the 2018–19 season to Liverpool. The Reds replied it and sent Kofi a pre-signed certificate. I know that made for a very special moment for him.\n\nLast year, shortly after I had been hospitalized, you told me how you wished you could take away my pain and take it on yourself. In response, I told you I wished no one were in pain. This past Fall, in the critical days, I had FaceTimed you from my AirBnb in Hartford and told you, with tears in my eyes, “I’m gonna make you proud.” You told me, “Make yourself proud.” I’ll do you one better — I will make us all proud, as was the main theme in Kojo’s eulogy for you, where he stated “We are going to make [you] proud.”\n\nI had recently looked at two photos side-by-side. One was of you in 2019, and the other was of me in 2022. I know you were adamant about not having your photos out there, so I will refrain from doing a side-by-side comparison here. Looking at them, I said to myself, “We’re twins. We’re the same.” Mommy agrees. In every way we are a lot more similar than I originally thought, but more than anything, I would say that we are two people who just really love life.\n\nYou know how badly I wanted to go back to school after I was hospitalized last year. When it became apparent that I was not going to be accommodated remotely, I insisted on going back in-person, in spite of the number of classes I missed. In my mind, whatever I had to do to get caught up, I was going to do. The very notion of a leave of absence tortured me — at least, that was until you told me that as a someone who has been a student without pause from preschool through undergrad, a break from school would not be the worst thing in the world. Mission deferred, but not deterred. Nowadays I don’t ever have doubts. I’ve never had any impostor syndrome. Looking back at things, I have you most of all to thank for that, Daddy. You will be very happy to hear that I’m currently working on an article on some very hard hitting topics I’m going to submit to a few of the law journals at UConn — without first looking at the rules for submission to see if, as a first-year, I’m even eligible to write for them. If in fact I am not, I’ll find another law school’s publication to submit it to. Should that fall through, I know I will definitely have future uses for all of the things I learned throughout the research and writing process. I know this much — whatever the rules are, whether I’m technically allowed to submit to them at this stage or not, what I’ve written will at the very least make them think, make them think hard about publishing and more importantly, make them think hard about what was said.\n\nLove,\n\nYour son forever,\n\nKwaku"
