        "text": "\"Creations Parmis les Cinq Elements\" is a special curation by Philippe H. Guggenheim who brings the most promising set of living talent with meteoric rises including Alexander Yulish, des Monstiers among others whilst bringing them together with works by Blue-Chip artists such as Yayoi Kusama, Andy Warhol and more. This thought-out presentation is woven together in a spectacular dialogue with the viewer and is not to be missed. Both the curator and some of the artists will be present.\n\nTuesday 11th – Philippe H. Guggenheim Curates an Exclusive Collection of Artworks Event (UN Ballroom)\n\nPhilippe H. Guggenheim will be hosting the \"Creations Parmis les Cinq Elements\" Art Exhibit with the over most promising set of living talent.\n\n17:00 - 20:00hrs | Complimentary | Four Seasons UN Ballroom\n\nTuesday 11th – Private Dinner with Philippe H. Guggenheim\n\nFrom 20:00hrs | Three Course Dinner\n\nWednesday 12th – Art as an investment with Philippe H. Guggenheim Breakfast\n\nAn exclusive breakfast prepared by Head Chef, Alex Tzatzos to be enjoyed with Philippe H. Guggenheim alongside a conversation about art as an investment\n\n09:00 - 10:30hrs\n\nAs art mimics life, Philip Tsiaras has taken note. The Greek artist is known for his hand-dotted works, which he says are made up of \"particle atoms.” In his latest exhibit, titled Dot Pop Portraits and on display at the HG Contemporary, his pointillist art is front and center, taking the shape of notable figures like Steve Jobs, Jackie O, and John F. Kennedy and Princess Diana. The multi-colored portraits come to resemble a sort of modern-day Roman mosaic, each embodying the personality of the icon it represents with meticulous attention to detail.\n\nArt Basel kicks off next week and one of the most important faces on the scene is Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim of HG Contemporary. The Daily will be hosting a dinner with the renowned gallery owner at The Faena to kick off the fair, but first we thought we’d dig a little deeper with the name to know in the art world right now.\n\nRenown Brazilian streetartist Kobra painted a mural in collaboration with HG Contemporary gallery above the landmark restaurant Empire Diner on 22nd and Tenth Ave in Chelsea. Visible from the Highline, the wall depicts four iconic and revolutionary artists Andy Warhol, Frida Khalo, Keith Haring, and Jean-Michel Basquiat as a depiction of Mount Rushmore. Owner Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim comments that this mural is bringing art closer to the community and this works engages the viewer and draws an audience, as it should. Kobra painted 18 murals all around the city portraying themes of freedom, equality and peace. Below is a video of making of the Kobra mural.\n\nSusan J. Barron’s beautiful and powerful 6x6ft mixed media depictions on canvas are achieved through photographic imagery, paint and text. Unflinchingly the veterans make direct eye contact with us. Incorporated into these photographic portraits are the veteran’s own stories in their own words. In these works, they give voice to their experience, their reality, their world. The elegance of the images confronts the brutality of the stories. Barron’s ultimate mission is not one of simplistic deification, but one of truthful illumination. This body of work is intended to not only give voice to these warriors’ harrowing, shocking, and often hopeful stories, but to create a dialogue and community around the difficult issue of PTSD. The mission is to depict the invisible scars of war and to show these brave individuals they are not alone. The mission is to end their isolation and depict them as the heroes they are. There will be a private gallery reception for veterans who graciously participated in the portrait series on Veterans Day, 2018.\n\nPhilippe H. Guggenheim presents activist Dan Eldon’s Primitivist Photo-collage for a Cause at HG Contemporary (527 W 23rd Street)\n\nby Annabella von Fetan\n\nGenerational figurehead of Chelsea’s Gallery District, Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim keeps New York fresh and conscionable with a new show, “The Journey Is The Destination,” which will open the evening of September 6th, 2018 at HG Contemporary (527 W 23rd Street). The exhibition illuminates a beauty inside the struggle, which is so often lost against a hunt for the next path to pleasure.\n\nPhilippe Hoerle-Guggenheim is a name to know when you’re looking for a gallerist who’s grasp on the art world knows no bounds. He has an ability to speak about art in a down to earth way and to use art to hone in on what anyone is looking for, a human connection.\n\nPhilippe Hoerle Guggenheim, the owner of Hoerle-Guggenheim Contemporary, is known for producing shows that embrace groundbreaking aesthetics and concepts that are a little out there so it came as no surprise to me that Alejandro and Domingo come from different artistic backgrounds and disciplines. The exhibition, which was meant to be seen as a “super meeting of the minds,” and a collaboration that echoes the vibrancy and personality of artists like Picasso and Basquiat only reinforced the following: why don’t I know who Domingo Zapata is and how has this gallery attracted so many people in the middle of a heat wave during Frieze Week?\n\nPhilippe Hoerle-Guggenheim has a famous last name that is synonymous with the art world. A distant relative to the Guggenheims who founded the museum of the same name in the United States, Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim has cut out a path of his own. What this French-German living in New York City also has in common with the other Guggenheims is his passion for art. His love for the arts was developed at a young age. Inspired by his mother and grandmother, the German-born 36-year-old fell in love with art and those who create it.\n\nAfter spending time working in finance, he decided his true calling was to open the HG Contemporary Art Gallery in New York City. Hoerle-Guggenheim’s hip, cool and trendy art gallery shows off some of the best new artwork being created today by hot new artists. The Anglia Ruskin University graduate now sees his calling as a purveyor of the arts and has found his niche in the world. The HG Contemporary Art Gallery is thriving and Hoerle-Guggenheim couldn’t be more pleased with its potential as one of the upcoming art houses in New York City.\n\nThe singer has inaugurated the show 'Smile', formed by thirty paintings painted in collaboration with the artist Domingo Zapata.\n\nI had to choose between painting and music, things do not go half-way, I used to hang on a string before a canvas like a wall and I crashed against it with my paintings,\" Alejandro Sanz recently confessed to the agency. Efe . Although he finally opted for the world of music, this week he has taken up his more artistic side and has done it in style, with an exhibition nothing more and nothing less than in New York. A sample formed by thirty paintings painted in collaboration with the Mallorcan artist Domingo Zapata . Both have shown proud the result of their works, among which stands out one with a singular theme: the Royal Family.\n\nChelsea space gallery owner of HG Contemporary, Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim, takes to heart when he explains his decision to go for the Madrid singer Alejandro Sanz and the neo -impressionist Mallorcan artist Domingo Zapata , who has been in New York since 1999, with the exhibition 'Smile', which can be seen until May 15.\n\nIn the sample, highlights the pieces, made by Sanz and Zapata, with the title 'The withered flower', 'What I love About You' (What I love you) or 'The Royal Family' (The Royal Family), valued between $ 5,000 and $ 65,000 . Without a doubt, especially the last one, it is destined to attract the attention of the Spanish public, because it gives the impression that it portrays the tensions of the Spanish Royal Family .\n\nThis joint exhibition is just another addition to a wildly popular and diverse career, this time exploring the world of music with renown musician Alejandro Sanz featuring Domingo Zapata.\n\nIn 2017, Sanz received the Gold Medal of the Community of Madrid for his talent, his support of humanitarian causes and his ability to surmount obstacles. He has also received the Gold Medal for Merit in the Fine Arts granted by the Spanish Ministry of Culture, and the Vision Award bestowed by the White House through the Hispanic Heritage Foundation in recognition of his notable contributions to Latin music.\n\nA true renaissance man, Zapata has worked in everything from sculpture, painting, music, murals, and fashion. Born in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, Zapata splits his time between his studios in New York, Miami and Hollywood creating Neo-Expressionist paintings in both oil and acrylic with the incorporation of mixed media, collage and graffiti.\n\nThe Spanish artist based in Miami Domingo Zapata is the first one who manages to seize his art from a quoted advertising space on the giant screens of the iconic New York Times square , but he is sure that it will not be the last. Born in Mallorca 43 years ago, Zapata has been showing videos of 15 seconds each since last Friday and for two months on the central screens of Manhattan's One Tower , which are shown randomly in this building designed in 1904 by the architect Cyrus LW Eidlitz .\n\nDoug Menuez is the acclaimed photojournalist who – as with any great witness to history – was in the right place at the right time and with the right camera. His career began in 1981 as an intern to the Washington Post. It was only four years later that he found himself in 1985 Silicon Valley exploring and struggling alongside the young, still unknown scions of the emerging tech industry. Yes, befriending the likes of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates et alia – while wielding his camera and capturing some of the most profound and earliest images of the men who would become the pioneers and founding fathers of the tech industry of the 20th Century. Many of these images found their way into his highly acclaimed book Fearless Genius: The Digital Revolution 1985-2000 which has been published into multiple languages and is regarded as one of the most important visual documents to the early beginnings of the men and few women who, indeed, truly led a revolution.\n\nWhile Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim has always had a passion for art—he says that he began collecting as a child—it was not until later in life that he realized that art could be not only his passion but also his career. Inspired by the great artists and intellectuals of the 20th century, from Peggy Guggenheim and Pablo Picasso to Max Ernst and Jackson Pollock, who lived and breathed art in a social and communal setting, Hoerle-Guggenheim wanted to open a gallery to bring artists together and encourage people to connect and experience the feeling of living with art. Four years ago, that dream was realized with the opening of HG Contemporary.\n\nHG Contemporary presents: Fearless Genius, a monumental photo exhibit showcasing a pivotal time in American & technological history. With exclusive access to Steve Jobs, during a time described as the ‘golden era’ of Silicon Valley, Doug’s collection of masterfully crafted images documented a niche of American entrepreneurs who were on a mission to change the world. From the creators of the smartphone to the visionaries behind making the internet accessible to everyone, this era altered the course of humanity’s evolution.\n\nAmerican-Italian painter Florian Crespol had a highly successful first exhibit of his series, “Field of Thought” at the HG Contemporary Gallery, at 527 West 23rd Street in New York City. The exhibit was launched with a private opening held on the evening of Feb. 7 and is scheduled to run through Feb. 25, 2018.\n\n“We are extremely pleased and excited by the success of the exhibit's opening,” says Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim, founder and owner of HG Gallery. “Florian Crespol's work is bold, raw and exciting. The exhibit's opening drew international interest and it was such a success that we are planning to hold another one in June in Tokyo.”\n\nHG Contemporary Gallery announced its art collaboration with JADE Sixty, a new Asian Steakhouse, developed by well-known restaurateurs, Stratis Morfogen and Franco Moscato. Executive Chef Skinny Mei, former chef at Jue Lan Club and Philippe, and Chef Albert Diaz, former chef at Zuma London and Miami, are overseeing the kitchen. The menu will offer American steakhouse, such as aged prime meats paired with many well-known Asian favorites.\n\nPhilippe Hoerle-Guggenheim’s tightly curated art collection includes works from Basquiat, Ilan Adar, Maria Luis Hernandez, Maria Jang, John Lennon and Olga Tobreluts. “I cannot think of a more perfect pairing than breakthrough contemporary art from some of the world’s best artists and world-class Asian fusion in a steakhouse setting,” said Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim, Founder & Owner of HG Contemporary.\n\nMost people have a tendency to use one side of their brain more than the other. The right side of the brain excels in the arts and the left side of the brain excels in math and science. Those excelling in math and science usually have better job prospects with a better salary than those excelling in the arts. Few actually make it as a musician, actor or artist. They are called “starving artists” for a reason. But what if you could get paid well for sharing your passion and knowledge with others? If you are passionate about art, you can turn that into a business through opening and running an art gallery.\n\nAs the world became introduced to new technology, people were excited. They were told that it would save so much of their time that there would be more time for family, friends, and hobbies. Extensive research has proven that the opposite is true. We have become deceived about today’s technology. The truth is that computer and communication technology actually disconnects us from life.\n\nMarc Gumpinger is the Artist of the Moment who will transcend his craft well into the Future by connecting the emotionally charged dots of the human soul with a scientifically enhanced laser-cut alike art technique that is both hypnotizing and besotting. Current and relevant, his art is the entrancing result of mixing the oxymoronic elements of human existence by bridging two worlds: tradition and digital innovation on the brink of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. His art is thought-provoking, forcing us to surpass the limitations of our comfort zone, stimulating our imagination, inspiring us to see beyond the Unseen and tap into a territory where fantasies and dreams are perfectly aligned with the latest discoveries in technology.\n\nDuring the peak of Punk Rock in the early eighties, when questioning the status-quo and aggressive social commentaries were at the heart of artistic expression, the San Francisco based Punk/ska band The OFFS were working to build a career. The coverart for their First Record, illustrated by Jean Michel Basquiat originally intrigued their signing label and contributed to their brief success. The OFFS and Basquiat’s social commentaries were consistent -- a support for class struggle through political art.\n\nIn 2017, HG Contemporary exclusively releases framed front/back limited edition of The OFFS First Record, cover art by Jean-Michel Basquiat.\n\nTo a certain extent, the abstract style known as Color Field painting is a one-shot deal: what you see is what you get. Natvar Bhavsar, an Indian-born artist who has lived in New York since the 1960s, is trying to do something else with this fairly straightforward genre, as a stimulating retrospective of his work at the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum in New Brunswick seeks to show.\n\nPhilippe Artus Hoerle-Guggenheim. A name inarguably headed for a sophisticated future. Somehow intimidating until you have the chance to a conversation with this refined 36 years old French-German Global citizen who surprisingly unveils himself quite differently than perhaps expected. That ‘je ne sais quoi’ is perfectly in his place along with the British accent, and his immaculately tailored suits.\n\nMost people would agree with the concept that a child’s family life has the most influence on his development. The school they attend comes in second to that, and most children attend public schools. Families have always looked to the public school system to provide their children with a well-rounded education. Reading, writing, arithmetic, and science are not the only subjects needed to shape a child. A fine arts curriculum is essential to the development of children and teenagers.\n\nHow many people dread getting up early in the morning, think about their day, get their morning coffee and try not to dread going in to work? Unfortunately, most people spend the majority of their waking hours in this way. This dread drains their energy, which makes it more difficult to produce at work, which produces more dread. It is an endless and exhausting cycle. What if there was a way to end this cycle?\n\nHG Contemporary, New York is hosting an exhibition of the works of artist Conor Mccreedy, on view through July 20, 2017.\n\nRepresented by Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim in North America, the show brings forth the highly acclaimed recent work by painter Conor Mccreedy (b.1987, Johannesburg, South Africa), who is known for his abstract and conceptual work based on his own unique, one-of-a-kind pigment “Mccreedy-Blue.” Inspired from his budding years in Southern Africa which is blessed with a landscape filled with endless shades of blue of brilliant cobalt skies and the convergence of Indian and Atlantic oceans, Mccreedy creates richly textured monochromatic abstract splash and figurative paintings in an unique pigment of blue.\n\nA new exhibition opening at Chelsea’s HG Contemporary Gallery last week. The main focus of the exhibition, which was curated by the gallery’s owner Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim, will lay on the Greek artist Philip Tsiaras. Visitors will encounter a wide array of the acclaimed artist’s paintings and sculptures from the 1980s to present-day, which includes politically charged works, such as “Primtivist”. Acting as a visual commentary on gun-control, the sculpture asks an important question. Can anyone—no matter how primitive—acquire the right to use a gun?\n\nThe acrylic on canvas medium takes on a thoroughly new form here! That was my first, precise personal thought as I perused the exuberant work of Zhenya Xia at the prime Chelsea gallery – HG Contemporary (527 West 23rd Street) earlier this Spring. This is, indeed, art d’vivre – if there ever is such a definition. Such is the draw and the evoked emotion. Her grasp of color, and the subtle yet resonant depth of her layers, her shapes, her diagonals is all crisp, unorthodox and very much original. Without question, the artistic signature of this Zhejiang born Chinese artist will continue to gather the keen eye of the very smartest and most astute collectors of post-millennial contemporary art.\n\nPhilippe Hoerle-Guggenheim bought his first piece of art, a Picasso sketch, at just 12 years old. A native of Germany, he grew up in a family of collectors and artists and was always very intrigued by the art world. Still, he never thought he could make a career out of collecting.\n\nPopular culture has long revered The IT Girl. That particular intriguing, smart and beautiful gamine. The cool chick with style and substance and class and pedigree. Well, in this politically correct day and age, Simply put – the IT Boy is the masculine ideal that all men want to be, and the guy that all the women want to be with. We now seek to celebrate The IT Boy. Or in this case, this particular New York City man-about-town and the talk of Manhattan as we speak by the name of Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim.\n\nWhen HG Contemporary’s inaugural show is a solo exhibit of acclaimed street artist RETNA’s work, you know it’s a gallery with a distinct point of view. That guiding direction comes mainly from the Chelsea gallery’s director, Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim, who has been visiting museums since he was three years old, getting carted around the Louvre with his art-obsessed mother and internalizing her penchant for the arts.\n\nHoerle-Guggenheim opened HG Contemporary in 2014 with the aforementioned RETNA exhibition to incredible acclaim. Since then, he has brought together an eclectic and thoughtful group of artists for a roster of group and solo exhibitions, often with a bold, playful pop culture bent that belies his genuine love for art.\n\nIn New York’s Chelsea neighborhood, a growing crowd watches a mirror image of a common street scene. There’s a tow truck and a car, but instead of removing it from an illegal parking space, the truck is lowering it into place, on the sidewalk in front of HG Contemporary Gallery. It’s a late-model VW Beetle in black, but it’s a little hard to tell, because it’s barely recognizable under all the multicolored graffiti, the work of Nelson Saiers.\n\nCelebrity fashion designer Domenico Vacca has opened a 10-storey retail destination just off Fifth Avenue that comprises a boutique for men’s and women’s fashion, an Italian espresso bar and cafe, a barber shop, a beauty salon, a private members-only club, and 30 serviced apartments. Boasting neighbors such as Cartier, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, The Plaza and of course the Museum of Modern Art, the flagship for Vacca, who famously dresses the actor Jeremy Piven in “Entourage,” opened on May 3 — a significant upgrade from his first New York boutique, which opened up the street, next to Cipriani, 13 years ago.\n\nThe luxurious oasis of brown leather sofas even acts as an art gallery with rotating exhibitions, curated by Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim, who runs the HG Contemporary gallery in Chelsea.\n\nAlong with death and taxes, another certainty in life is math. In light of this, I hope to bring new meaning to April 15 as the birthday of Leonhard Euler. Born in 1707 to a pastor and pastor’s daughter in Basel, Switzerland, he was a devout Christian throughout his life, but chose the abacus over the cloth as a profession. This career would produce three of the top 5 most important equations ever, including arguably the most beautiful (according to a 1988 Mathematical Intelligencer poll), leading many to believe him to be the greatest mathematician ever. It is even more remarkable that he was able to accomplish this with impaired vision for most of his life. He began going blind in his 30’s, becoming completely blind in his 50’s. He actually became even more prolific after his blindness, earning comparisons to Beethoven whose deafness did not slow him.\n\nAs an artist, I draw my inspiration from many sources, from the Ethiopian Civil War to the crossing of the Rubicon, from Cezanne to Shakespeare, but given my background in mathematics, I regularly find myself exploring the lenses and tools that mathematics affords us. As one of mathematics’ greatest innovators, Euler is one of these inspirations for me.\n\nAnyone familiar with the art world knows that there exists a complex, incestuous relationship between fine art and finance. Both deal in valuing things that can be hard to objectively appraise, and both can be confoundingly volatile. Plus, finance men, with their insatiable appetites for wealth and status, are flocking to art galleries and auctions these days.\n\nNelson Saiers further unites the two: The former derivatives trader and hedge fund manager gave up his lucrative career to become an artist last year. He now paints—wait for it—financial crises.\n\nTwo weeks ago his show of 20 paintings opened at HG Contemporary in Chelsea. The exhibition, suggestively titled “Inside Wall Street,” has a three-fold mission. The works look at the inside of his algorithm (the intellectual property that built his hedge fund into a very successful one), the inside of his fund, which he wound down recently to focus exclusively on art, and inside Wall Street itself.\n\nINSIDE WALL STREET Offers a Glimpse into the 2008 Crisis through the Lens of the Math and Algorithms That Run Wall Street\n\nNEW YORK, April 15, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nelson Saiers—artist, math Ph.D., and former hedge fund manager—walked away from Wall Street roughly a year ago. His art exhibition at HG Contemporary Gallery, 527 W 23rd Street in New York City, uses parts of his actual hedge fund trading algorithm to comment on the Financial Crisis of 2008, Madoff, and other large-scale financial motivators and events.\n\nNelson Saiers made his name as a star Wall Street quant. Now his paintings and sculpture targets the chaos of financial markets\n\nArt and mathematics may seem worlds apart, but to study forms, lines, and shapes is also an education in balance, precision, and geometry.\n\nHarmony between the aesthetic and the abacus goes on display this week in New York at a show of former hedge fund manager Nelson Saiers’ art. Saiers left his perch in 2014 as a star quant to dedicate time to math-based art, and his show targets the chaos inherent in financial markets. Lessons gleaned from trading are ubiquitous themes in his paintings and sculpture. At times, he converts his money-making equations into splashes of Braille, inserting brooding commentaries straight onto canvas. In one painting, he deploys his trading algorithms to conjecture what might have happened to the CBOE Volatility Index—the so-called fear gauge—after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914.\n\nKiller Content has acquired the film and TV rights to Louise O’Neill’s novel “Only Ever Yours” with plans to develop the property as a film and TV series.\n\nO’Neill’s debut novel was a YA hit in the U.K., where it was published last year. “Only Ever Yours,” released in the U.S. in May, is a dystopian story of a finishing school for girls where technology is used to enforce extreme standards of beauty and conformity.\n\nKiller Content was formed last year through the merger of Christine Vachon and Pamela Koffler’s Killer Films with Glass Elevator Media, a content incubator launched by Adrienne Becker.\n\n“Only Ever Yours” is designed to be a bigger-budget film than Killer has fielded in the past. The indie stalwart’s latest pic, Todd Haynes’ “Carol,” has been generating awards buzz. It’s set for release Nov. 20.\n\nKiller Content is working with the newly launched nonprofit Two Brass Brads to finance “Only Ever Yours.” Two Brass Brads is described as non-profit organization that creates “socially relevant” content that will be released in tandem with activist campaigns and educational efforts.\n\nAmong the org’s supporters is Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim, whose Hoerle-Guggenheim art gallery is hosting a book party for O’Neill in New York on Wednesday.\n\nIt's the sort of outfit which would cause a scandal if Her Majesty wore it. Elizabeth Hurley - who plays a fictional Queen in E!'s spoof series The Royals - stepped out on Monday in a see-through lace top at the premiere of the second season in NYC. The 50-year-old model and actress defied her age in the black sheer top which showed off her fabulously fit figure.\n\nAs is NYC nightlife tradition, a venue signals that Something is inside via a velvet rope and careful assistants clutching the guest list in front of it. Last night, Hoerle-Guggenheim Gallery in Chelsea upped the expectations. Gallery director, Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim, opened Massimo Agostinelli’s “Anagrams” exhibit with a shiny red Aston Martin DB9 outside and a celebrity host, R&B singerMaxwell, who was playfully dressed in a red Paul Smith suit. Mr. Hoerle-Guggenheim—decked out in black with a manly modern-James-Bond presence—collaborated with his social but private friend, Maxwell, after the gifted Now musician glimpsed and loved Agostinelli’s “Now I Won” piece from his “Palindromes” exhibit in London this past May. (“Lonely Tylenol” on 15 5 15 for the Brit wits.)\n\nAt one time or another, we all played with anagrams, and had fun while rearranging the letters of a word or a phrase to produce a new one. This type of wordplay we all know and love, has inspired artist Massimo Agostinelli to create a series of works focusing on the enigmatic meaning of expressions associated with famous people and iconic objects. These works will be presented at Anagrams exhibition, that will be on view at Hoerle-Guggenheim's Gallery in New York. For the upcoming show, the artist merges changeable phrases and classical and pop culture imagery by employing a unique art technique of lenticular printing.\n\nAn exhibition of Rolling Stones-inspired artwork and memorabilia put on by the Hoerle-Guggenheim Gallery at the new Edition Hotel in New York on Tuesday night received over 1,000 RSVPs.\n\nThe party was thrown in honor of the seminal rock outfit's 50th birthday, a fact that's enough to make pretty much anyone feel ancient.\n\nLike most high-profile events that reach capacity early, the scene at the door quickly devolved into bedlam. \"A lot of them were turned away or forced to wait without ever getting in,\" an anonymous source told Page Six, which had the story. \"It was a madhouse.\"\n\nAfter serving over half a century as the best band in the world, the Rolling Stones are still the source of inspiration and entertainment for several generations. Last night that came in the form of a new art show presented by Hoerle-Guggenheim and WhitewallMagazine, in which the venerated band was again immortalized through a collection of paintings, hand-written lyrics, and even guitars that have lived more than most people.\n\nThe collection, which included pieces by Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, was spread out over the third floor of the ever-buzzing EDITION hotel, but it was still a challenge to get a good look at the work with so many guests filling up the large space. A long line formed outside the hotel, with people eager to get a peek at the show, but also to rub shoulders with the stylish guests including Mr. Brainwash, Harif Guzman, and the EDITION's very dapper Ben Pundole.\n\nOver 1,000 people RSVP’d for an exhibition celebrating 50 years of the Rolling Stones on Tuesday.\n\n“A lot of them were turned away or forced to wait without ever getting in. It was a madhouse,” said a spy of the ­Hoerle-Guggenheim Gallery show at the Edition hotel.\n\nArtist Jumping Bull created a Stones tongue installation of Coke cans. A collector bought a Ronnie Wood guitar for $10,000, and a “tech CEO” offered $80,000 for one of the band’s Grammys.\n\nAlso there were Mr. Brainwash, Harif Guzman and Scott Lipps.\n\nThis weekend, Jason Dussault is overseeing what will likely become one of the most memorable public-art projects in the city's history.\n\nThe celebrated mosaic artist and 500 volunteers from Telus were at David Lam Park creating a 12-metre by four-metre mural. It will feature a character he has named Barker the Evergreen standing in front of letters spelling out the word Vancouver.\n\n\"Most artists have to sneak out in the middle of the night to get their art on walls and streets,\" Dussault told the Straight. \"I'm very fortunate that I don't have to risk arrest by trying to get my art up on the walls. I want to thank the city and Telus for doing this because it's something they don't have to do.\"\n\nMr. Brainwash (aka Thierry Guetta) is many things: a street artist, a filmmaker, and a real estate investor. He's been rumored to be Banksy, or alternatively, an invention of the famously anonymous street artist, after starring in the 2008 film, Exit from the Gift Shop.\n\nDespite, or because of, these rumors, Mr. Brainwash continues his work as a street artist, taking on projects in cities around the world. New York seems to be a special place for the French expat, who currently lives in Los Angeles, but just bought a space under the High Line. He recently teamed up with Hoerle-Guggenheim Gallery (see artnet Asks: Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim, Gallery Director) to unleash his creativity on the interior of the newly launched New York Edition Hotel. The only problem? He has a mere three hours to get the job done, and isn't sure yet what to do, exactly. We sat down with Mr. Brainwash to discuss the project, his celebrity fascination, and of course, Banksy.\n\nLuxury real estate firm, RLTY NYC celebrated the grand opening of its SoHo office at 518 Broadway on Monday, May 11th with an unprecedented collection of artwork curated by Hoerle-Guggenheim Gallery. The company also disclosed its partnership with the gallery to provide fine art advisory services to its premier clientele.\n\n“We are honored to expand RLTY NYC’s presence into SoHo,” stated Mr. Benalloul. “We believe that the aesthetic of our new office space will foster camaraderie between our local art and real estate communities, and we look forward to the continued evolution between our two fields.”\n\nWhoever said art and algorithms are mutually exclusive? Almost a year ago, Nelson Saiers left his hedge fund, Saiers Capital, and turned his attention to a seemingly more creative venture: the full-time pursuit of art.\n\nSaiers, who received his Ph.D. in mathematics at the ripe age of 23, pursued a successful career at Deutsche Bank before becoming chief investment officer of his own financial firm. Now, the self-anointed “mathematical artist\" has harmoniously transitioned fromalgebraic topology to painting.\n\nNELSON SAIERS TO OPEN POP-UP EXHIBITION CELEBRATING π IN AND BEYOND MATHEMATICS\n\n“The Original Art Basel” by Nelson Saiers.\n\n\"I was like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\" - Sir Isaac Newton\n\nIn anticipation of a very special π (Pi) Day, artist and mathematician, Nelson Saiers, has prepared dual pop-up exhibitions focused on this ubiquitous number. The doors for both will open Saturday, March 14, 2015, or 3.14.15, at 9:26 AM (that is, 3.1415926, or the first eight digits of π) at the Hoerle-Guggenheim Gallery, 527 West 23rd Street in Chelsea to celebrate this unique occurrence in the modern calendar. This exhibition will include an exclusive preview of Saiers' latest work.\n\nSaiers uses some of the most profound Pi-related equations and theories, combined with social commentary, history, and literature, to create visually-stimulating and thought-provoking works of art. Inspired by Newton’s childlike view of himself, Saiers recalled his earliest discovery of math and created much of this collection with crayon and construction paper. The abstract forms share the beauty of mathematical simplicity, but also take the viewer on a journey to explore the famously irrational number that defines circles and is fundamental to statistics, fractals, thermodynamics, mechanics, and electromagnetism.\n\nPhilippe Hoerle-Guggenheim, the director of Chelsea gallery Hoerle-Guggenheim, has acquired an impressive array of important modern and contemporary artists for a gallery as young as his—it opened its doors on West 23rd Street for the very first time early this Fall. The gallery's most recent acquisitions include seminal works by artists RETNA. Also of note in the collection are the rich color-laden canvases of Natvar Bhavsar as well as a few choice works by Warhol, John Lennon, and Dalí."
