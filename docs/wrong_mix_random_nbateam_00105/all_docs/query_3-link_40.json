        "text": "NBA Playoff Briefing- Part 2\n\nThis NBA post-season has enjoyed the best start to any playoffs opening round in history, the highlights and story lines speak for themselves. A racist was spotted and burned, always a good thing, yet even the Sterling distraction couldn’t take us away from the action. Every series was thrilling, every team was fighting, and it got me thinking about the change of format. Maybe we should just keep this system, Atlanta proved this much. My predictions were mostly on point, but the length of each series was surprising. Portland proved that Damian Lillard is in fact “Machete”, as mentioned a couple of months ago. Dallas were admirable, Toronto fought for every inch, Chicago got to the playoffs with basically no talent, Indiana celebrated like middle school cheerleaders and dodged a hawk and Miami look like champions again.\n\nNow that the second round is set, here’s a preview:\n\nSpurs vs. Blazers: Spurs looked old in some instances against Dallas, but Manu looks as smooth as his bald spot. Rick Carlisle challenged San Antonio’s weaknesses and the Spurs reacted in legendary fashion. Portland’s rotation may not have the depth the Spurs have, but I won’t sleep on them again. The solid starting line-up for the Blazers will be a terror once again, but the Spurs will give them a valuable lesson if all goes according to plan. Spurs in 6\n\nThunder vs. Clippers: Every basketball fan is looking closely at this match-up. There are many story lines at play; the leadership of Durant has been questioned, while Chris Paul leads by wit and example. The Blake -Ibaka match-up, the long awaited Dudley vs. Lamb match-up, Ok I’ve gone too far. It should be another classic. Thunder in 7\n\nPacers vs. Wizards: The Pacers’ struggles may bode well for them going forward. The Hawks have given them a warranted wake-up call . Washington has a horde of talent, and all the unfounded hate dished out by Bill Simmons seems unfounded. Sure they missed on many draft picks, but as Sir Charles said, Beal and Wall will be the top back court for years to come. Indiana will improve, Washington will fight, but the Wizards’ idiot coach will mess this up. Pacers in 6\n\nMiami vs. Brooklyn: We saved the best for last, I know I’ll get hate mail for this, but I’m sticking to my guns, Brooklyn can take this series, here’s why: Miami’s secret weapon, apart from Wade and Lebron has been their outside shooting that spaces the floor for LBJ to operate. Brooklyn can rotate to guard those shooters and this year Miami’s shooters haven’t been good as last year. Perhaps a heroic effort by Lebron and Wade is coming up, they’re more than capable, but are the Heat at their best when it’s only the Wade and Lebron show? Mike Miller is an underrated subtraction, Miller could shoot, handle and guard anywhere from a 2 to a smaller 4-man. Regular season numbers don’t mean much, but the odd part is Brooklyn was never at full strength when they beat the Heat 4 times this year. Kidd is implementing his evil plan and the veterans are peaking at the right time. This is my long shot and my major threat to a semi-perfect bracket, here goes nothing. Brooklyn in 6\n\nDo you think I’m loco? What are your 2nd round predictions?\n\nMuch love and basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\nIndiana, let’s be Frank\n\nThe Indiana Pacers’ postseason has been dreadful. When a 1-seed is down 2-1 in the opening round, it usually isn’t startling, this one is. Larry Bird’s face last night made my stomach turn. The one question I get calls and emails about is “Why do the Pacers suck?” My answer was the same; they don’t suck, just going through a rough patch. After last night’s loss in Atlanta, I changed my mind, they blow. Unless something radical happens, the Pacers will do nothing noteworthy this season. I stuck by Woodson as he pillaged my Knicks, but Vogel’s hot seat is different. Earlier in the season, I loved his optimistic outlook and still give him recognition for making a basketball player out of an idiot in Lance Stephenson. After watching 3 quarters of last night’s loss to the Hawks, it’s clear that this is Vogel’s failure, here’s why:\n\nFast break points: When the Pacers get a turnover or stop, they insist on playing a half court game, knowing that PG and Stephenson thrive while pushing the ball and getting to the rim. These are coaching tactics, if they were told to run, they would run. I coach, I encourage pushing the ball against 3 on 3 or 2 on 2, I like my odds on offense, I believe in my players, I believe in making contact, putting the defense on their heels, shoving the ball down their throat. Every good team does that. The Pacers have it and they’re not using it. Vogel has clearly instructed them not to run. Why?\n\nEvan Turner: All Larry wanted to do was get a better basketball player and he did, Evan Turner was playing like an all-star with Philly. He’s a great shot creator and has more talent than his cock-fighting partner Stephenson. He’s not a spot up shooter! He sure as shit isn’t going to become a spot up shooter just because he hired a shooting coach, it’s not going to happen. Players can work and become good spot shooters, over years, not months.\n\nHibbert’s situation: Yes Roy is slow, but he’s the leader of this team. It’s premature to cast him out. Play him less minutes, but don’t blame him for bad match-ups, that you put him in.\n\nHesitation: No one wants to shoot. Even Lance, who can be as selfish as a politician, doesn’t want to take on any burden. Lance is only effective as a 3rd or 4th option. When the other top dogs are struggling, Lance just ball watches.\n\nPredictability: Every play is an extended post play for West or a middle-school flare screen for Paul George. Really?! This is all you’ve got? Sad, just sad.\n\nOutside Shooting: Another reason Vogel is utterly douching is the 3-point shooters he never uses. Milsap Antic, pretty much any Atlanta off-ball defender is cheating defensively. Rasul Butler and Copeland can’t get 4 minutes of playing time and hit 3s, let them break a sweat.\n\nScola: Playing Scola at the beginning of the 2nd quarter isn’t enough. He needs to play at least 30 minutes at center against the Hawks: the veteran can shoot and post.\n\nSpacing: All the big guys are in the way of the slashers. Half of coaching offense is spacing, there’s none of it.\n\nGeorge Hill: George Hill said he is a 2 guard and not a point guard. He said this now. My first reaction is go F%^@ yourself George Hill. Man up! You’re running point for the top team in the East and you’re complaining about position? You want to shoot? That’s cute. That’s the most selfish statement coming out of Indiana. What a disappointment. Think what Bird is thinking. “So we traded a future all-star in Kawhi Leonard and we got the athletic point guard we were looking for, only to find out that he just wants to be a backup shooting guard.” G Hill grow up, any kid would kill for a spot at running a top NBA team with West and PG.\n\nMorale: Frank is out of his element. Every turnover, every pass, every shot is second guessed. Body language is telling, Vogel has lost his players and Larry knows it.\n\nSome credit goes to the Atlanta Spurs… ahem Hawks. I despise blaming coaches, but this is easy. Bird has seen too much success and too many sinking ships to not know the distinction. I’d be surprised if the Pacers turn it around. If I were Larry legend, I wouldn’t wait; I’d fire Vogel now and take over. Stranger things have happened (see Riley-Miami). Sometimes you just stick it out, this is not one of those times; the Pacers are a small market team that have spent time and money to get here. Sometimes patience is just a cashew.\n\nAny other reasons Indiana is struggling? Share on Rambeeni Basketball.\n\nMuch Love and Basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\nNBA Dynasties: Past and Present\n\nWith the playoffs around the corner, it’s time to look at the history of dynasties and point out two teams that have sky-scraping stakes this season. Books have been written about NBA dynasties; let’s try to keep it simple.\n\nNBA Dynasty:\n\nAn NBA team that has won multiple championships in close succession while dominating a span of at least 3-5 years.\n\nA team that still shows up on NBA TV at least once a month.\n\nA team that has three or more of its core players on different championship teams.\n\nClear-cut Dynasties:\n\nMikan’s Minneapolis Lakers: The first dynasty. Mikan was simply taller than everyone and could see the future with his glasses.\n\nRussel’s Celtics: 11 rings? Russell is the equivalent of Gholam, obsessed with this ring business, and stands 6’11 instead of 2’11.\n\nMagic’s Lakers: The Lakers dominated from the moment Magic stepped on the floor, from 1980-1991. They earned 5 championships and an unbelievable 8 finals appearances. Magic was in the finals almost every year of his career.\n\nMJ’s Bulls: 6 championships could have easily been 7 or 8, and they’re the only team to ever three-peat, twice! The best regular season record of all-time, coupled with 6 rings, makes the Bulls arguably the greatest team of all-time.\n\nShaq and Kobe’s Lakers: Absolute dominance. Shaq was the most dominant player ever seen. In his prime, no one could stop Shaq, not Hakeem, not Ewing, not MJ, not Wilt, not Russell, not Lebron, no one, never forget that. The burbling beast, hungry for a ring, paired with a young Kobe, instilled fear in the opposition. It’s a shame egos got in the way, despite the Zen keeping the peace. Kobe wasn’t in his prime, which is the real sad part about the split. The epic game 7 against Portland is one of the greatest “Give me that!” moments ever seen. I thought this was going to be a tough call, but it isn’t. They’re the only team to 3-peat apart from MJ’s bulls. Dynasty Status: Granted. Kobe did continue to win another 2 rings, but apart from Phil and D fish, it was a different team.\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nDr J’s Sixers: The Sixers had an up and down decade when they acquired the silky smooth Julius Erving in the late 70’s. They were consistently relevant, reaching the finals 4 times from 1977-1984 and failing to win all but one of them. Despite a star-studded roster, it was a difficult era with Magic and Larry coming in and taking the league by storm. Dynasty Status: Not even close.\n\nLarry’s Celtics: The smell of sweat in the old Boston garden was enough to make you cough up the ball or a lung. They had the best home record in NBA history, with the white version of basketball Jesus as their leader. A well-balanced team, with grit and unprecedented IQ, Bird’s Celtics went to the finals 5 times in the 80’s, only winning 3 championships. As historic as that team was, they fall short, merely because they only won 3 without repeating once. Dynasty status: Close, but they were unlucky in that the competition in the 80s was fierce enough to deny them dynasty status.\n\nModern day Goliath:\n\nTim Duncan’s Spurs: Ever since Greg Popovich lucked out in the 1997 draft with the 1st overall pick, the spurs haven’t looked back. The NBA is a league of blessings in disguise; David Robinson’s season ending injury was the reason Timmy joined the Spurs. The Spurs military apparatus, with the talent of Timmy, the admiral, Sean Elliot and mastery of Pop, bred a project of excellence and consistency. Years later, the Spurs are still a model of patience and continuity. The permanence in bridging the Robinson era with the Duncan era was seamless; the addition of TP and Manu Ginobili gave them a stellar force to continue that success with unrivalled longevity. They’ve won 4 NBA Championships since 1998; all winning seasons. They have only been ousted in the first round three times and have been to the finals 5 times, winning 4 out of the five. Not to mention, the measure of regular season excellence, as they peaked this year. Pop is a player, with Tim Duncan as the centrepiece, bridge D-rob with TP and Manu and we got ourselves a long-term dynasty that may always be underrated. Dynasty Status: Yes, granted, they are a dynasty. Another finals appearance or win would put them firmly as one of the supreme franchises in history. The final chapter will be decided next week. The curtain waits.\n\nMiami Heat: Three straight finals appearances with 2 championships in the bank. Pat Riley’s Padowan genius Eric Spolstera has been instrumental, making sure egos and games mesh. The humility of Wade to take a back seat and ice his knees has been solicitous. It helps to have a mammoth freak of nature that can shoot, drive, pass, intimidate and bully everyone; Lebron is a physical and cerebral specimen never seen before. Bosh is a half decent compliment. Dynasty status: To be constructed, a minimum of 2 more rings required based on the talent involved.\n\nWhen there are many pundits whaling at the gap between the top teams and the second tier teams nowadays, we can see that Miami and San Antonio are playing for their place in history. In the bigger scheme of things, this year is pivotal. For Miami, a third straight title would cement their dynasty status, instantly. For the Spurs, it will further embolden their case for long-term consistency and supremacy. The beauty of this season is it’s up for grabs. Out west, anyone from the Spurs, Thunder, Clips, and Rockets could win it. In the East, apart from Miami, Indiana and Brooklyn look to roll in the hay by next week. It’s also the first time in the history of the NBA that the Knicks, Lakers and Celtics miss the playoffs (collective bargaining?). How will this year play out? Who are your East and West finalists?\n\nShaBlam! I just realized the Lakers are the top franchise in history; the Lakers had 3 different dynasties, with Boston a close 2nd and Chicago right behind them. Any dynasties missed?\n\nStay tuned for our playoff preview this Friday.\n\nMuch love and basketball,\n\nRambeeni"
