        "text": "Athletes have sex appeal for many reasons: the gold medals, the championships, and that incredible determination to be the best.\n\nBut let's be honest, they also have some of the sexiest bodies around.\n\nWe picked the 20 athletes from our Sexiest Athletes Alive list that have the most defined six packs, biggest bulging biceps, and sleekest chiseled legs.\n\nJessica Ennis—Great Britain Women's Heptathalon\n\nDavid Beckham—Soccer\n\nRonda Rousey—MMA Fighter\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider\n\nPlease follow Sports Page on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nLeBron James tried to hit Dwyane Wade with a backdoor pass under the basket. But when the Mavericks sniffed out the play, Wade pulled up and let the pass go through.\n\nUnfortunately for a photographer sitting courtside, the pass appeared to hit his camera, opening up a nasty cut on his face. LeBron did come over to check on the photographer who was tended to by the Mavericks training staff.\n\nBut as the announcers pointed out, if you are going to sit that close to the court, you have to have your head on a swivel at all times...\n\nPlease follow Sports Page on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story »\n\nLeBron James put up this home video of a 2008 dinner with Chris Paul, Warren Buffett, and Bill Gates in Las Vegas on his YouTube page this week, and it's pretty interesting.\n\nJames and Buffett have had a relationship for years. LeBron once said he sometimes sends his financial statements to Buffett, and Buffett has praised LeBron's business sense repeatedly throughout the years.\n\nBut this video is the first time we've seen them interact in real life.\n\n\"I like this guy because he shows up with good-looking women,\" Buffett jokes at the start of the dinner. James was with his then-girlfriend Savannah Brinson, and Paul with his wife.\n\nYou can't hear much of the conversation, but at one point Gates appears to explain a card game.\n\nThe best part of the video comes at the 1:25-mark, when James and Paul are walking through the hotel after the dinner. James was just 23 years old at the time, and in the video he walks and talks with a more youthful affect than we see out of him today.\n\n\"We just had dinner with a few friends of ours, you know,\" James brags. \"Two guys by the name of Warren Buffet and Bill Gates. A lot of people call him William. Two of the powerful people in the world, you know.\"\n\nHere's the clip:\n\nPlease follow Sports Page on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story »\n\nTaylor Tepper of NPR.comspoke with an economist who speculated that LeBron James' salary should be \"closer to $40 million per year,\" well-above his actual salary of $17.5 million. The economist cites the NBA's salary cap for depressing James' earnings.\n\nOf course, this is unrealistic since the NBA does have a salary cap the players agreed to during collective bargaining. But even within the confines of the cap, James is grossly underpaid.\n\nThe chart on the left shows the base salary for each member of the Miami Heat. The chart on the right shows how much each player would make if the same payroll ($83.4 million) was distributed based on performance. In this case, we used Win Shares from Basketball-Reference.com to measure the overall production of each player.\n\nThe results show that James is underpaid by $9.8 million. Ray Allen's $3.1 million salary is also well-below his performance on the court. At the other end, Dwyane Wade is the most overpaid player on the team, making approximately $3.4 million more than he is worth...\n\nSalary data via HoopsWorld.com\n\nPlease follow Sports Page on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story »\n\nMiami Heat fan Michael Drysch, a 50-year-old computer tech guy, hit an incredible hook shot from half court to win $75,000 at the AmericanAirlines Arena.\n\nLeBron James couldn't contain himself and tackled Drysch in sheer joy.\n\nFrom ESPN:\n\nDrysch said he had been practicing the shot the past two days and only made it once during his workouts. He received a tip from a friend in the arena tunnel as he was warming up to take the shot.\n\n\"They told me to put some spin on the ball, and get it up there as high as I could,\" Drysch said. \"I had made that shot something like 1 percent of the time in my life.\"\n\nHere's the full video below:\n\nPlease follow Sports Page on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story »\n\nBrooklyn Nets bench player Reggie Evans made headlines yesterday by ripping LeBron James and the Miami Heat's 2011 NBA championship.\n\nEvans said the title wasn't legitimate, telling the Stefan Bondy of the NY Daily News, \"It doesn't prove nothing. That was a lockout season.\"\n\nHe also said that LeBron is only as good as Andray Blatche — a Nets back-up power forward.\n\nLast night the Heat pounded the Nets in Brooklyn 105-85, and LeBron went after Evans in the press after the game.\n\nHe tried to take the high road, but couldn't help pointing to Evans' meager stat line. Here's what he told Brian Windhorst of ESPN:\n\n\"Let me look at his numbers real quick — he had no offensive rebounds, so we did our number on him.\"\n\nHe also took on Evans' specific criticisms:\n\n\"You can't just come out and say something like that versus a champion. No one knows what it takes unless you've done it. You can't sit here and judge and talk about a team winning a championship unless you've done it. (Evans) hasn't done it.\"\n\nFinally he told ESPN that he didn't say anything to Evans during the game, because Evans isn't worth his time:\n\n\"For what? I let my game do the talking. I'm not going to sit here and give Reggie Evans a lot of press, because that is what is going to happen for the next couple days.\"\n\nThe blowout win was a good enough response to Evans, but you can't fault James for getting a few digs in after the game.\n\nPlease follow Sports Page on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story »\n\nKobe Bryant is in Boston to play the Celtics tonight, and he sat down with ESPN Boston's Jackie MacMullen for an extensive interview.\n\nHe talked about Rob Gronkowski's dancing videos, Rajon Rondo's competitiveness, and his 1996 pre-Draft workout with the Celtics.\n\nBut the most interesting part came when Kobe talked about the how LeBron James subverts all attempts to get in his head with trash talk. Here's what Kobe said:\n\n\"They don't seem to want to talk any trash. I say everything to LeBron. He says nothing back. He just laughs. There's no banter back and forth. I guess it's a generational thing. When I first came into the league, the trash talk was downright cutthroat.\"\n\nHe added, \"I don't talk trash often, but when I do, I go for the jugular.\"\n\nNot all younger players are impervious to trash talk. We saw Carmelo Anthonyself-combust when Kevin Garnett got into his head in a game at MSG last month.\n\nBut LeBron is certainly different.\n\nHere's an example of what Kobe is talking about from last year's Eastern Conference Finals. After Garnett tries to get in his face, LeBron simply starts laughing:\n\nThe best way to deal with trash talk is to point out the plain absurdity of talking trash. And that's exactly what LeBron does, apparently.\n\nKobe had a few more excellent quotes in the ESPN interview.\n\nOn Rob Gronkowski's shirtless dancing videos:\n\n\"Everyone is so worked up about what he did [in Vegas]. It's funny. If there were camera phones back in the day, the biggest athletes in the world would have had a lot of explaining to do.\"\n\nOn becoming friends with Bill Belichick:\n\n\"I'm sitting there on the bench, just beside myself, burning with frustration, and I look over and Bill Belichick is walking toward me. I had never met him. Never spoken to him. He had courtside seats across from our bench, and with 20 seconds left in the game, he came over and said, 'Don't you worry about this. I know what you are going through. We just lost a tough one ourselves [to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII]. Just bounce back. Be ready next year.'\"\n\nRead the entire thing over at ESPN Boston >\n\nDON'T MISS: 12 Quotes That Tell You Why Kobe Is The Most Outspoken Player In The NBA >\n\nNow Watch: Inside NYC's Underground Muay Thai Fight League\n\nPlease follow Sports Page on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story »\n\nLeBron James is in the midst of one of the most amazing stretches of basketball efficiency in NBA history.\n\nLast night he became the first player to ever score 30 points and shoot better than 60% in six-straight games.\n\nHe has made 60 of his last 80 shots.\n\nHis averages in his last six games combined: 30.8 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 71.7% shooting, 55.6% three-point shooting.\n\nThe Heat are 6-0 in that stretch.\n\nWe are watching LeBron James at his peak — or, we are watching LeBron finally enter his prime at age 28 — and already people are rushing to compare his streak to those of the greatest players ever\n\nSo it was in that context that LeBron James dropped this tweet this morning:\n\nIt's so simple it's cryptic.\n\nIt was either a humble tweet where LeBron attempted to nip the Michael Jordan comparisons in the bud, or it was a cocky tweet where LeBron announced to the world that \"LJ\" is the new \"MJ\" when it comes to basketball supremacy.\n\nWho knows what he means.\n\nThe point right now is that LeBron is playing at a level that no one has reached since MJ.\n\nHe's shooting as efficiently as Shaq in his prime, scoring as well as Kobe, rebounding like a small forward, and passing the ball like a point guard.\n\nWe've never seen this sort of hybridization of basketball skills. So he's right when he says he's different from Jordan, but only time will tell if he's better than Jordan.\n\nHere's what LeBron's shot chart looks like over the last six games (via SportsCenter):\n\nAfter the game last night, LeBron seemed amazed by his own dominance, telling Brian Windhorst of ESPN:\n\n\"I'm at a loss for words. … Like I say over and over, I know the history of the game. I know how many unbelievable players who came through the ranks, who paved the way for me and my teammates. And for me to be in the record books by myself with such a stat -- any stat -- it's big-time.\"\n\nWindhorst also asked LeBron what he'd be doing if someone else was on this hot streak:\n\n\"I'd be tweeting like crazy.

But, I mean, we’re just human. He’s not.\"\n\nElliot Williams, Portland Trail Blazers (via The Oregonian):\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like him. That was amazing.”\n\nSasha Pavlovic, Portland Trail Blazers (via The Oregonian):\n\n“You’ve got to listen to this, he says LeBron was created in a lab. He’s crazy.”\n\nJJ Hickson, Portland Trail Blazers (via The Oregonian):\n\n“The things that he does, it’s just... You just can’t explain it.”\n\nSteve Nash, Los Angeles Lakers (via ESPN):\n\n\"It's scary. No one's quite played the game the way he's playing it, as consistently as he's played it. I think Jordan had some years of that, when he was rebounding and passing as well as scoring efficiently. But [LeBron] has taken it to a pretty rare area in the history of our game.\"\n\nKobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers (via Palm Beach Post):\n\n\"He’s just playing exceptional basketball. I think he’s figured out his game, in terms of what he wants it to be. ... I mean, it’s just sensational. At his size, I think what’s important that he’s added to his game is his ability to square up and shoot.\"\n\nMetta World Peace, Los Angeles Lakers (via LA Times):\n\n\"He's definitely strong. He reminds me of a more athletic me.\"\n\nDwyane Wade, Miami Heat (via USA Today):\n\n\"He's off the planet right now. He's not even the best basketball player on the planet. He's surpassed the planet. He's somewhere else. He's playing phenomenal.\"\n\nUnreal praise.\n\nPlease follow Sports Page on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story »\n\nThanks to Michael Jordan's 50th birthday, ESPN's obsession with MJ, and an 11-letter tweet from LeBron James, people are once again asking, \"is LeBron as good as Jordan?\" But if we take an objective moment to look at their careers side-by-side, and ignore the disparity in championship rings (I know, I know), LeBron's is on the same level as Jordan and threatening to surpass him.\n\nAfter LeBron's first two seasons in South Beach saw his production decline, this season he is on pace for 19.9 Win Shares (WS), a statistic that measures the all-around performance of a player. Jordan only had one season after the age of 27 with at least 19 WS. And while we have no idea how he would have performed in the years he was \"retired,\" one can argue his success after returning was helped by the time off as his numbers were in steady decline from age 24-29.\n\nIf LeBron can maintain a 19-20 WS performance over the next 4-5 seasons (and add a few more rings), it might be Jordan that will be \"1A\" to LeBron's \"1\"...\n\nPlease follow Sports Page on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story »\n\nThere are a lot of different ways you can breakdown the differences between Michael Jordan and LeBron James, Jordan and Kobe Bryant, and LeBron and Kobe. But for Jordan, it is all about the rings.\n\nIn an interview with Ahmad Rashad for NBA TV (via Miami Sun-Sentinel ) Jordan was asked to compare the careers of Bryant and James...\n\n\"If you had to pick between the two, that would be a tough choice...but five beats one every time I look at it\"...And not that [James] won't get five...He may get more than that, but five is bigger than one.\"\n\nOf course, Kobe is in his 17th season and LeBron is in just his 10th, so just using championships gives Bryant a bit of an unfair advantage. It will also be interesting to see if Jordan's tune will change if Kobe wins a sixth ring, matching Jordan's total.\n\nMeanwhile, somewhere Robert Horry is thinking, \"oh yeah, seven is bigger than six or five or one.\"\n\nPlease follow Sports Page on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story »"
