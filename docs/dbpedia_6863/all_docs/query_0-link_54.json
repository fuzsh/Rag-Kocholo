The mission of the school is to provide an exceptional education that respects individual student needs, fosters a passion for lifelong learning, and cultivates personal and social responsibility. The student body is highly diverse in learning styles and academic backgrounds. Students choose Pacific Crest because it offers them an environment that is relaxed and informal, where they will receive more individualized attention and where there is an emphasis on building a school community. Classes are rigorous and inspiring as the school maintains high performance standards over a broad range of curricular options. Each Pacific Crest student is responsible for designing and implementing a unique curriculum with the assistance of his or her school advisor. This responsibility requires each student to set and pursue academic goals and perform quarterly community service. His or her progress is assessed through narrative evaluations and the coursework is compiled in a portfolio. While academic pursuits are paramount, the school also places a strong emphasis on personal and social responsibility. All students are actively engaged in the school’s governance and are required to be active volunteers in the community. Teachers at Pacific Crest are inspired, multi-faceted individuals with a great deal of energy to give to this diverse group of young people. The staff works closely together in all realms of the school’s operation. The lively and productive nature of the school community is a direct effect of each teacher being a full contributor to the school’s environment.
