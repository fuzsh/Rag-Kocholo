        "text": "© ESO 2020\n\n1. Introduction\n\nSince their discovery (Smoot et al. 1992), temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have become one of the most powerful ways of studying cosmology and the physics of the early Universe. This paper reports the final results on cosmological parameters from the Planck Collaboration1. Our first results were presented in Planck Collaboration XVI (2014, hereafter PCP13). These were based on temperature (TT) power spectra and CMB lensing measurements from the first 15.5 months of Planck data combined with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) polarization likelihood at multipoles ℓ ≤ 23 (Bennett et al. 2013) to constrain the reionization optical depth τ. Planck Collaboration XIII (2016, hereafter PCP15) reported results from the full Planck mission (29 months of observations with the High Frequency Instrument, HFI), with substantial improvements in the characterization of the Planck beams and absolute calibration (resolving a difference between the absolute calibrations of WMAP and Planck). The focus of PCP15, as in PCP13, was on temperature observations, though we reported preliminary results on the high-multipole TE and EE polarization spectra. In addition, we used polarization measurements at low multipoles from the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) to constrain the value of τ.\n\nFollowing the completion of PCP15, a concerted effort by the Planck team was made to reduce systematics in the HFI polarization data at low multipoles. First results were presented in Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI (2016), which showed evidence for a lower value of the reionization optical depth than in the 2015 results. Further improvements to the HFI polarization maps prepared for the 2018 data release are described in Planck Collaboration III (2020). In this paper, we constrain τ using a new low-multipole likelihood constructed from these maps. The improvements in HFI data processing since PCP15 have very little effect on the TT, TE, and EE spectra at high multipoles. However, this paper includes characterizations of the temperature-to-polarization leakage and relative calibrations of the polarization spectra enabling us to produce a combined TT,TE,EE likelihood that is of sufficient fidelity to be used to test cosmological models (although with some limitations, which will be described in detail in the main body of this paper). The focus of this paper, therefore, is to present updated cosmological results from Planck power spectra and CMB lensing measurements using temperature and polarization.\n\nPCP13 showed that the Planck data were remarkably consistent with a spatially-flat ΛCDM cosmology with purely adiabatic, Gaussian initial fluctuations, as predicted in simple inflationary models. We refer to this model, which can be specified by six parameters, as “base” ΛCDM in this paper. Note that in the base ΛCDM cosmology we assume a single minimal-mass neutrino eigenstate. We investigated a grid of one- and two-parameter extensions to the base-ΛCDM cosmology (varying, for example, the sum of neutrino masses, effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom Neff, spatial curvature ΩK, or dark-energy equation of state w0), finding no statistically significant preference for any departure from the base model. These conclusions were reinforced using the full Planck mission data in PCP15.\n\nThe analyses reported in PCP13 and PCP15 revealed some discrepancies (often referred to as “tensions”) with non-Planck data in the context of ΛCDM models (e.g., distance-ladder measurements of the Hubble constant and determinations of the present-day amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum), including other CMB experiments (Story et al. 2013). As a result, it is important to test the fidelity of the Planck data as thoroughly as possible. First, we would like to emphasize that where it has been possible to compare data between different experiments at the map level (therefore eliminating cosmic variance), they have been found to be consistent within the levels set by instrument noise, apart from overall differences in absolute calibration; comparisons between WMAP and Planck are described by Huang et al. (2018), between the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck by Louis et al. (2014), and between the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck by Hou et al. (2018). There have also been claims of internal inconsistencies in the PlanckTT power spectrum between frequencies (Spergel et al. 2015) and between the ΛCDM parameters obtained from low and high multipoles (Addison et al. 2016). In addition, the PlanckTT spectrum preferred more lensing than expected in the base-ΛCDM model (quantified by the phenomenological AL parameter defined in Sect. 2.3) at moderate statistical significance, raising the question of whether there are unaccounted for systematic effects lurking within the Planck data. These issues were largely addressed in Planck Collaboration XI (2016), PCP15, and in an associated paper, Planck Collaboration Int. LI (2017). We revisit these issues in this paper at the cosmological parameter level, using consistency with the Planck polarization spectra as an additional check. Since 2013, we have improved the absolute calibration (fixing the amplitudes of the power spectra), added Planck polarization, full-mission Planck lensing, and produced a new low-multipole polarization likelihood from the Planck HFI. Nevertheless, the key parameters of the base-ΛCDM model reported in this paper, agree to better than 1σ20132 with those determined from the nominal mission temperature data in PCP13, with the exception of τ (which is lower in the 2018 analysis by 1.1σ2013). The cosmological parameters from Planck have remained remarkably stable since the first data release in 2013.\n\nThe results from Planck are in very good agreement with simple single-field models of inflation (Planck Collaboration XXII 2014; Planck Collaboration XX 2016). We have found no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity (Planck Collaboration XXIV 2014; Planck Collaboration XVII 2016), setting stringent upper limits. Nor have we found any evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects (see PCP15 and Planck Collaboration XX 2016). Planck, together with Bicep/Keck (BICEP2, Keck Array and Planck Collaborations 2015) polarization measurements, set tight limits on the amplitude of gravitational waves generated during inflation. These results are updated in this paper and in the companion papers, describing more comprehensive tests of inflationary models (Planck Collaboration X 2020) and primordial non-Gaussianity (Planck Collaboration IX 2020). The Planck results require adiabatic, Gaussian initial scalar fluctuations, with a red-tilted spectrum. The upper limits on gravitational waves then require flat inflationary potentials, which has stimulated new developments in inflationary model building (see e.g., Ferrara et al. 2013; Kallosh et al. 2013; Galante et al. 2015; Akrami et al. 2018, and references therein). Some authors (Ijjas et al. 2013; Ijjas & Steinhardt 2016) have come to a very different conclusion, namely that the Planck/Bicep/Keck results require special initial conditions and therefore disfavour inflation. This controversy lies firmly in the theoretical domain (see e.g., Guth et al. 2014; Linde 2018), since observations of the CMB constrain only a limited number of e-folds during inflation, not the initial conditions. Post Planck, inflation remains a viable and attractive mechanism for accounting for the structure that we see in the Universe.\n\nThe layout of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes changes to our theoretical modelling since PCP15 and summarizes the likelihoods used in this paper. More comprehensive descriptions of the power-spectrum likelihoods are given in Planck Collaboration V (2020), while the 2018 Planck CMB lensing likelihood is described in detail in Planck Collaboration VIII (2020). Section 3 discusses the parameters of the base-ΛCDM model, comparing parameters derived from the PlanckTT, TE, and EE power spectra. Our best estimates of the base-ΛCDM cosmological parameters are derived from the full Planck TT,TE,EE likelihood combined with Planck CMB lensing and an HFI-based low-multipole polarization likelihood to constrain τ. We compare the PlanckTE and EE spectra with power spectra measured from recent ground-based experiments in Sect. 4.\n\nThe Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology is compared with external data sets in Sect. 5. CMB power spectrum measurements suffer from a “geometric degeneracy” (see Efstathiou & Bond 1999) which limits their ability to constrain certain extensions to the base cosmology (for example, allowing ΩK or w0 to vary). Planck lensing measurements partially break the geometric degeneracy, but it is broken very effectively with the addition of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from galaxy surveys. As in PCP13 and PCP15 we use BAO measurements as the primary external data set to combine with Planck. We adopt this approach for two reasons. Firstly, BAO-scale determinations are relatively simple geometric measurements, with little scope for bias from systematic errors. Secondly, the primary purpose of this paper is to present and emphasize the Planck results. We therefore make minimal use of external data sets in reporting our main results, rather than combining with many different data sets. Exploration of multiple data sets can be done by others using the Monte Carlo Markov chains and Planck likelihoods released through the Planck Legacy Archive (hereafter PLA)3. Nevertheless, Sect. 5 presents a comprehensive survey of the consistency of the Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology with different types of astrophysical data, including Type 1a supernovae, redshift-space distortions, galaxy shear surveys, and galaxy cluster counts. These data sets are consistent with the Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology with, at worst, moderate tensions at about the 2.5σ level. Distance-ladder measurements of the Hubble constant, H0, are an exception, however. The latest measurement from Riess et al. (2019) is discrepant with the Planck base-ΛCDM value for H0 at about the 4.4σ level. This large discrepancy, and its possible implications for cosmology, is discussed in Sect. 5.4.\n\nSection 6 investigates the internal consistency of the Planck base-ΛCDM parameters, presenting additional tests using the TE and EE spectra, as well as a discussion of systematic uncertainties. Results from our main grid of parameter constraints on one- or two-parameter extensions to the base-ΛCDM cosmology are presented in Sect. 7. That section also includes discussions of more complex models of dark energy and modified gravity (updating the results presented in Planck Collaboration XIV 2016), primordial nucleosynthesis, reionization, recombination, and dark matter annihilation. Section 8 summarizes our main conclusions.\n\n2. Methodology and likelihoods\n\n2.1. Theoretical model\n\nThe definitions, methodology, and notation used in this paper largely follow those adopted in the earlier Planck Collaboration papers dealing with cosmological parameters (PCP13, PCP15). Our baseline assumption is the ΛCDM model with purely adiabatic scalar primordial perturbations with a power-law spectrum. We assume three neutrinos species, approximated as two massless states and a single massive neutrino of mass mν = 0.06 eV. We put flat priors on the baryon density ωb ≡ Ωbh2, cold dark matter density ωc ≡ Ωch2, an approximation to the observed angular size of the sound horizon at recombination θMC, the reionization optical depth τ, the initial super-horizon amplitude of curvature perturbations As at k = 0.05 Mpc−1, and the primordial spectral index ns. Other parameter definitions, prior limits, and notation are described explicitly in Table 1 of PCP13; the only change is that we now take the amplitude prior to be flat in log As over the range 1.61 < log(1010As) < 3.91 (which makes no difference to Planck results, but is consistent with the range used for some external data analyses).\n\nChanges in our physical modelling compared with PCP15 are as follows.\n\n– For modelling the small-scale nonlinear matter power spectrum, and calculating the effects of CMB lensing, we use the halofit technique (Smith et al. 2003) as before, but now replace the Takahashi et al. (2012) approach with HMcode, the fitting method of Mead et al. (2015, 2016), as implemented in camb (Lewis et al. 2000).\n\n– For each model in which the fraction of baryonic mass in helium YP is not varied independently of other parameters, the value is now set using an updated big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) prediction by interpolation on a grid of values calculated using version 1.1 of the PArthENoPE BBN code (Pisanti et al. 2008, version 2.0 gives identical results). We now use a fixed fiducial neutron decay-constant value of τn = 880.2 s, neglecting uncertainties. Predictions from PArthENoPE for the helium mass fraction (YP ≈ 0.2454, nucleon fraction from Planck in ΛCDM) are lower than those from the code of Pitrou et al. (2018) for the same value of τn by ΔYP ≈ 0.0005; however, other parameter results would be consistent to well within 0.1σ. See Sect. 7.6 for further discussion of BBN parameter uncertainties and code variations.\n\nBuilding upon many years of theoretical effort, the computation of CMB power spectra and the related likelihood functions has now become highly efficient and robust. Our main results are based upon the lensed CMB power spectra computed with the August 2017 version of the camb4 Boltzmann code (Lewis et al. 2000) and parameter constraints are based on the July 2018 version of CosmoMC5 (Lewis & Bridle 2002; Lewis 2013). We have checked that there is very good consistency between these results and equivalent results computed using the class Boltzmann code (Blas et al. 2011) and MontePython sampler (Audren et al. 2013; Brinckmann & Lesgourgues 2019). Marginalized densities, limits, and contour plots are generated using updated adaptive kernel density estimates (with corrections for boundary and smoothing biases) as calculated using the getdist package (Lewis 2019)6 (also part of CosmoMC), which improves average accuracy for a given number of posterior samples compared to the version used in our previous analyses.\n\nA few new derived parameters have been added to the output of the CosmoMC chains to allow comparisons and combinations with external data sets. A full description of all parameters is provided in the tables presented in the Explanatory Supplement (Planck Collaboration 2018), and parameter chains are available on the PLA.\n\n2.2. Power spectra and likelihoods\n\nSince the 2015 Planck data release, most of the effort on the low-level data processing has been directed to improving the fidelity of the polarization data at low multipoles. The first results from this effort were reported in Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI (2016) and led to a new determination of the reionization optical depth, τ. The main results presented in this paper are based on the 2018 HFI maps produced with the SRoll mapmaking algorithm described in detail in Planck Collaboration III (2020), supplemented with LFI data described in Planck Collaboration II (2020).\n\nBecause Planck-HFI measures polarization by differencing the signals measured by polarization-sensitive bolometers (PSBs), a number of instrumental effects need to be controlled to achieve high precision in the absolute calibrations of each detector. These include: effective gain variations arising from nonlinearities in the analogue-to-digital electronics and thermal fluctuations; far-field beam characterization, including long bolometer time constants; and differences in detector bandpasses. The SRoll mapmaking solution for the 100–353 GHz channels minimizes map residuals between all HFI detectors at a given frequency, using absolute calibrations based on the orbital dipole, together with a bandpass-mismatch model constructed from spatial templates of the foregrounds and a parametric model characterizing the remaining systematics. We refer the reader to Planck Collaboration III (2020) for details of the implementation of SRoll. The fidelity of the SRoll maps can be assessed using various null tests (e.g., splitting the data by half-mission, odd-even surveys, and different detector combinations) and by the consistency of the recovered Solar dipole solution. These tests are described in Planck Collaboration III (2020) and demonstrate that the Solar dipole calibration is accurate to about one part in 104 for the three lowest-frequency HFI channels. Large-scale intensity-to-polarization leakage, caused by calibration mismatch in the SRoll maps, is then reduced to levels ≲10−6μK2 at ℓ > 3.\n\nThe low-multipole polarization likelihood used in this paper is based on the SRoll polarization maps and series of end-to-end simulations that are used to characterize the noise properties and remaining biases in the SRoll maps. This low-multipole likelihood is summarized in Sect. 2.2.3 and is described in more detail in Planck Collaboration V (2020).\n\nAs in previous Planck papers, the baseline likelihood is a hybrid, patching together a low-multipole likelihood at ℓ < 30 with a Gaussian likelihood constructed from pseudo-cross-spectrum estimates at higher multipoles. Correlations between the low and high multipoles are neglected. In this paper, we have used two independent high-multipole TT,TE,EE likelihoods7. The Plik likelihood, which is adopted as the baseline in this paper, is described in Sect. 2.2.1, while the CamSpec likelihood is described in Sect. 2.2.2 and Appendix A. These two likelihoods are in very good agreement in TT, but show small differences in TE and EE, as described below and in the main body of this paper. Section 2.3 summarizes the Planck CMB lensing likelihood, which is described in greater detail in Planck Collaboration VIII (2020).\n\nBefore summarizing the high-multipole likelihoods, we make a few remarks concerning the 2018 SRoll maps. The main aim of the SRoll processing is to reduce the impact of systematics at low multipoles and hence the main differences between the 2015 and 2018 HFI maps are at low multipoles. Compared to the 2015 HFI maps, the SRoll maps eliminate the last 1000 HFI scanning rings (about 22 days of observations) because these were less thermally stable than the rest of the mission. SRoll uses higher resolution maps to determine the destriping offsets compared to the 2015 maps, leading to a reduction of about 12% in the noise levels at 143 GHz (see Fig. 10 of Planck Collaboration III 2020). A tighter requirement on the reconstruction of Q and U values at each pixel leads to more missing pixels in the 2018 maps compared to 2015. These and other changes to the 2018 Planck maps have very little impact on the temperature and polarization spectra at high multipoles (as will be demonstrated explicitly in Fig. 9 below).\n\nThere are, however, data-processing effects that need to be accounted for to create an unbiased temperature+polarization likelihood at high multipoles from the SRoll maps. In simplified form, the power absorbed by a detector at time t on the sky is\n\n(1)\n\nwhere I, Q, and U are the beam-convolved Stokes parameters seen by the detector at time t, G is the effective gain (setting the absolute calibration), ρ is the detector polarization efficiency, ψ(t) is the roll angle of the satellite, ψ0 is the detector polarization angle, and n(t) is the noise. For a perfect polarization-sensitive detector, ρ = 1, while for a perfect unpolarized detector, ρ = 0. The polarization efficiencies and polarization angles for the HFI bolometers were measured on the ground and are reported in Rosset et al. (2010). For polarization-sensitive detectors the ground-based measurements of polarization angles were measured to an accuracy of approximately 1° and the polarization efficiencies to a quoted accuracy of 0.1–0.3%. The SRoll mapmaking algorithm assumes the ground-based measurements of polarization angles and efficiencies, which cannot be separated because they are degenerate with each other. Errors in the polarization angles induce leakage from E to B modes, while errors in the polarization efficiencies lead to gain mismatch between I, Q and U. Analysis of the PlanckTB and EB spectra (which should be zero in the absence of parity-violating physics) reported in Planck Collaboration III (2020), suggest errors in the polarization angles of ≲0.5°, within the error estimates reported in Rosset et al. (2010). However, systematic errors in the polarization efficiencies are found to be several times larger than the Rosset et al. (2010) determinations (which were limited to characterizations of the feed and detector sub-assemblies and did not characterize the system in combination with the telescope) leading to effective calibration offsets in the polarization spectra. These polarization efficiency differences, which are detector- and hence frequency-dependent, need to be calibrated to construct a high-multipole likelihood. To give some representative numbers, the Rosset et al. (2010) ground-based measurements estimated polarization efficiencies for the PSBs, with typical values of 92–96% at 100 GHz, 83–93% at 143 GHz, and 94–95% at 217 GHz (the three frequencies used to construct the high-multipole polarization likelihoods). From the SRoll maps, we find evidence of systematic errors in the polarization efficiencies of order 0.5–1% at 100 and 217 GHz and up to 1.5% at 143 GHz. Differences between the main beams of the PSBs introduce temperature-to-polarization leakage at high multipoles. We use the QuickPol estimates of the temperature-polarization beam transfer function matrices, as described in Hivon et al. (2017), to correct for temperature-to-polarization leakage. Inaccuracies in the corrections for effective polarization efficiencies and temperature-to-polarization leakage are the main contributors to systematic errors in the Planck polarization spectra at high multipoles.\n\nIn principle, B-mode polarization spectra contain information about lensing and primordial tensor modes. However, for Planck, B-mode polarization spectra are strongly noise dominated on all angular scales. Given the very limited information contained in the PlanckB-mode spectra (and the increased complexity involved) we do not include B-mode power spectra in the likelihoods; however, for an estimate of the lensing B-mode power spectrum (see Planck Collaboration VIII 2020, hereafter PL2018).\n\n2.2.1. The baseline Plik likelihood\n\nThe Plik high-multipole likelihood (described in detail in Planck Collaboration V 2020, hereafter PPL18) is a Gaussian approximation to the probability distributions of the TT, EE, and TE angular power spectra, with semi-analytic covariance matrices calculated assuming a fiducial cosmology. It includes multipoles in the range 30 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2508 for TT and 30 ≤ ℓ ≤ 1996 for TE and EE, and is constructed from half-mission cross-spectra measured from the 100-, 143-, and 217 GHz HFI frequency maps.\n\nThe TT likelihood uses four half-mission cross-spectra, with different multipole cuts to avoid multipole regions where noise dominates due to the limited resolution of the beams and to ensure foreground contamination is correctly handled by our foreground model: 100 × 100 (ℓ = 30–1197); 143 × 143 (ℓ = 30–1996); 143 × 217 (ℓ = 30–2508); and 217 × 217 (ℓ = 30–2508). The TE and EE likelihoods also include the 100 × 143 and 100 × 217 cross-spectra to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and have different multipole cuts: 100 × 100 (ℓ = 30–999); 100 × 143 (ℓ = 30–999); 100 × 217 (ℓ = 505–999); 143 × 143 (ℓ = 30–1996); 143 × 217 (ℓ = 505–1996); and 217 × 217 (ℓ = 505–1996). The 100-, 143-, and 217 GHz intensity maps are masked to reduce Galactic dust, CO, extended sources, and point-source contamination (a different point-source mask is used at each frequency), as well as badly-conditioned/missing pixels, effectively retaining 66, 57, and 47% of the sky after apodization, respectively (see Eq. (10) in PCP15 for a definition of the effective sky fraction). The apodization is applied to reduce the mask-induced correlations between modes, and reduces the effective sky fraction by about 10% compared to the unapodized masks. The 100-, 143-, and 217 GHz maps in polarization are masked only for Galactic contamination and badly-conditioned or missing pixels, effectively retaining 70, 50, and 41% of the sky after apodization, respectively.\n\nThe baseline likelihood uses the different frequency power spectra without coadding them, modelling the foreground and instrumental effects with nuisance parameters that are marginalized over at the parameter estimation level, both in temperature and in polarization. To reduce the size of the covariance matrix and data vector, the baseline Plik likelihood uses binned band powers, which give an excellent approximation to the unbinned likelihood for smooth theoretical power spectra. Unbinned versions of the likelihoods are also available and provide almost identical results to the binned spectra for all of the theoretical models considered in our main parameter grid (Sect. 7.1).\n\nThe major changes with respect to the 2015 Plik likelihood are the following.\n\nBeams. In 2015, the effective beam window functions were calculated assuming the same average sky fraction at all frequencies. In this new release, we apply beam window functions calculated for the specific sky fraction retained at each frequency. The impact on the spectra is small, at the level of approximately 0.1% at ℓ = 2000.\n\nDust modelling in TT. The use of intensity-thresholded point-source masks modifies the power spectrum of the Galactic dust emission, since such masks include point-like bright Galactic dust regions. Because these point-source masks are frequency dependent, a different dust template is constructed from the 545 GHz maps for each power spectrum used in the likelihood. This differs from the approach adopted in 2015, which used a Galactic dust template with the same shape at all frequencies. As in 2015, the Galactic dust amplitudes are then left free to vary, with priors determined from cross-correlating the frequency maps used in the likelihood with the 545 GHz maps. These changes produce small correlated shifts in the dust, cosmic infrared background (CIB), and point-source amplitudes, but have negligible impact on cosmological parameters.\n\nDust modelling in TE and EE. Dust amplitudes in TE are varied with Gaussian priors as in 2015, while in EE we fix the dust amplitudes to the values obtained using the cross-correlations with 353 GHz maps, for the reasons detailed in PPL18. The choice of fixing the dust amplitudes in EE has a small impact (of the order of 0.2σ) on the base-ΛCDM results when combining into the full “TT,TE,EE,” Plik likelihood because EE has lower statistical power compared to TT or TE; however, dust modelling in EE has a greater effect when parameters are estimated from EE alone (e.g., fixing the dust amplitude in EE lowers ns by 0.8σ, compared to allowing the dust amplitude to vary.)\n\nCorrection of systematic effects in the polarization spectra. In the 2015 Planck analysis, small differences in the inter-frequency comparisons of TE and EE foreground-corrected polarization power spectra were identified and attributed to systematics such as temperature-to-polarization leakage and polarization efficiencies, which had not been characterized adequately at the time. For the 2018 analysis we have applied the following corrections to the Plik spectra.\n\n– Beam-leakage correction. The TE and EE pseudo-spectra are corrected for temperature-to-polarization leakage caused by beam mismatch, using polarized beam matrices computed with the QuickPol code described in Hivon et al. (2017). The beam-leakage correction template is calculated using fiducial theoretical spectra computed from the best-fit ΛCDM cosmology fitted to the TT data, together with QuickPol estimates of the HFI polarized beam transfer-function matrices. This template is then included in our data model. The correction for beam leakage has a larger impact on TE than on EE. For base-ΛCDM cosmology, correcting for the leakage induces shifts of ≲1σ when constraining parameters with TT,TE,EE, namely +1.1σ for ωb, −0.7σ for ωc, +0.7σ for θMC, and +0.5σ for ns, with smaller changes for other parameters.\n\n– Effective polarization efficiencies. We estimate the effective polarization efficiencies of the SRoll maps by comparing the frequency polarization power spectra to fiducial spectra computed from the best-fit base-ΛCDM model determined from the temperature data. The details and limitations of this procedure are described in PPL18 and briefly summarized further below. Applying these polarization efficiency estimates, we find relatively small shifts to the base-ΛCDM parameters determined from the TT,TE,EE likelihood, with the largest shifts in ωb (+0.4σ), ωc (+0.2σ), and ns (+0.2σ). The parameter shifts are small because the polarization efficiencies at different frequencies partially average out in the coadded TE spectra (see also Fig. 9, discussed in Sect. 3).\n\n– Correlated noise in auto-frequency cross-spectra and subpixel effects. The likelihood is built using half-mission cross-spectra to avoid noise biases from auto-spectra. However, small residual correlated noise contributions may still be present. The pixelization of the maps introduces an additional noise term because the centroid of the “hits” distribution of the detector samples in each pixel does not necessarily lie at the pixel centre. The impact of correlated noise is evaluated using the end-to-end simulations described in Planck Collaboration III (2020), while the impact of subpixel effects is estimated with analytic calculations. Both effects are included in the Plik data model, but have negligible impact on cosmological parameters.\n\nOf the systematic effects listed above, correction for the polarization efficiencies has the largest uncertainty. We model these factors as effective polarization calibration parameters , defined at the power spectrum level for a frequency spectrum ν × ν8. To correct for errors in polarization efficiencies and large-scale beam-transfer function errors, we recalibrate the TE and EE spectra against a fiducial theoretical model to minimize\n\n(2a)\n\nwith respect to the parameters contained in the diagonal calibration matrix G with elements\n\n(2b)\n\nwhere the index i = 1, N runs over the multipoles ℓ and frequencies ν × ν′ of the spectra contained in the CD data vector of dimension N; CD contains the Cℓ frequency spectra either for XY = TE or XY = EE, fit separately. In Eq. (2a), M is the covariance matrix for the appropriate spectra included in the fit, while the temperature calibration parameters are fixed. We perform the fit only using multipoles ℓ = 200 − 1000 to minimize the impact of inaccuracies in the foreground modelling or noise, and we test the stability of the results by fitting either one frequency spectrum or all the frequency spectra at the same time. The recalibration is computed with respect to a fiducial model vector CTh because the Planck polarization spectra are noisy and it is not possible to inter-calibrate the spectra to a precision of better than 1% without invoking a reference model. The fiducial theoretical spectra contained in CTh are derived from the best-fit temperature data alone, assuming the base-ΛCDM model, adding the beam-leakage model and fixing the Galactic dust amplitudes to the central values of the priors obtained from using the 353 GHz maps. This is clearly a model-dependent procedure, but given that we fit over a restricted range of multipoles, where the TT spectra are measured to cosmic variance, the resulting polarization calibrations are insensitive to small changes in the underlying cosmological model.\n\nIn principle, the polarization efficiencies found by fitting the TE spectra should be consistent with those obtained from EE. However, the polarization efficiency at 143 × 143, , derived from the EE spectrum is about 2σ lower than that derived from TE (where the σ is the uncertainty of the TE estimate, of the order of 0.02). This difference may be a statistical fluctuation or it could be a sign of residual systematics that project onto calibration parameters differently in EE and TE. We have investigated ways of correcting for effective polarization efficiencies: adopting the estimates from EE (which are about a factor of 2 more precise than TE) for both the TE and EE spectra (we call this the “map-based” approach); or applying independent estimates from TE and EE (the “spectrum-based” approach). In the baseline Plik likelihood we use the map-based approach, with the polarization efficiencies fixed to the efficiencies obtained from the fits on EE: ; ; and . The CamSpec likelihood, described in the next section, uses spectrum-based effective polarization efficiency corrections, leaving an overall temperature-to-polarization calibration free to vary within a specified prior.\n\nThe use of spectrum-based polarization efficiency estimates (which essentially differs by applying to EE the efficiencies given above, and to TE the efficiencies obtained fitting the TE spectra, , , and ), also has a small, but non-negligible impact on cosmological parameters. For example, for the ΛCDM model, fitting the Plik TT,TE,EE+lowE likelihood, using spectrum-based polarization efficiencies, we find small shifts in the base-ΛCDM parameters compared with ignoring spectrum-based polarization efficiency corrections entirely; the largest of these shifts are +0.5σ in ωb, +0.1σ in ωc, and +0.3σ in ns (to be compared to +0.4σ in ωb, +0.2σ in ωc, and +0.2σ in ns for the map-based case). Furthermore, if we introduce the phenomenological AL parameter (discussed in much greater detail in Sect. 6.2), using the baseline TT,TE,EE+lowE likelihood gives AL = 1.180 ± 0.065, differing from unity by 2.7σ (the value of AL is unchanged with respect to the case where we ignore polar efficiencies entirely, 1.180 ± 0.065). Switching to spectrum-based polarization efficiency corrections changes this estimate to AL = 1.142 ± 0.066 differing from unity by 2.1σ. Readers of this paper should therefore not over-interpret the Planck polarization results and should be aware of the sensitivity of these results to small changes in the specific choices and assumptions made in constructing the polarization likelihoods, which are not accounted for in the likelihood error model. To emphasize this point, we also give results from the CamSpec likelihood (see, e.g., Table 1), described in the next section, which has been constructed independently of Plik. We also note that if we apply the CamSpec polarization masks and spectrum-based polarization efficiencies in the Plik likelihood, then the cosmological parameters from the two likelihoods are in close agreement.\n\nThe coadded 2018 Plik temperature and polarization power spectra and residuals with respect to the base-ΛCDM model are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.\n\n2.2.2. The CamSpec likelihood\n\nThe CamSpec temperature likelihood was used as the baseline for the first analysis of cosmological parameters from Planck, reported in PCP13, and was described in PPL13. A detailed description of CamSpec and its generalization to polarization is given in Efstathiou & Gratton (2019). For PCP15, the CamSpec temperature likelihood was unaltered from that adopted in PPL13, except that we used half-mission cross-spectra instead of detector-set cross-spectra and made minor modifications to the foreground model. For this set of papers, the CamSpec temperature analysis uses identical input maps and masks as Plik and is unaltered from PCP15, except for the following details.\n\n– In previous versions we used half-ring difference maps (constructed from the first and second halves of the scanning rings within each pointing period) to estimate noise. In this release we have used differences between maps constructed from odd and even rings. The use of odd-even differences makes almost no difference to the temperature analysis, since the temperature spectra that enter the likelihood are signal dominated over most of the multipole range. However, the odd-even noise estimates give higher noise levels than half-ring difference estimates at multipoles ≲500 (in qualitative agreement with end-to-end simulations), and this improves the χ2 of the polarization spectra. This differs from the Plik likelihood, which uses the half-ring difference maps to estimate the noise levels, together with a correction to compensate for correlated noise, as described in PPL18.\n\n– In PCP15, we used power-spectrum templates for the CIB from the halo models described in Planck Collaboration XXX (2014). The overall amplitude of the CIB power spectrum at 217 GHz was allowed to vary as one of the “nuisance” parameters in the likelihood, but the relative amplitudes at 143 × 217 and 143 × 143 were fixed to the values given by the model. In the 2018 analysis, we retain the template shapes from Planck Collaboration XXX (2014), but allow free amplitudes at 217 × 217, 143 × 217, and 143 × 143. The CIB is ignored at 100 GHz. We made these changes to the 2018 CamSpec likelihood to reduce any source of systematic bias associated with the specific model of Planck Collaboration XXX (2014), since this model is uncertain at low frequencies and fails to match Herschel-SPIRE measurements (Viero et al. 2013) of the CIB anisotropies at 350 and 500 μm for ℓ ≳ 3000 (Mak et al. 2017). This change was implemented to see whether it had any impact on the value of the lensing parameter AL (see Sect. 6.2); however, it has a negligible effect on AL or on other cosmological parameters. The Plik likelihood retains the 2015 model for the CIB.\n\n– In PCP15 we used a single functional form for the Galactic dust power spectrum template, constructed by computing differences of 545 × 545 power spectra determined using different masks. The dust template was then rescaled to match the dust amplitudes at lower frequencies for the masks used to form the likelihood. In the 2018 CamSpec likelihood we use dust templates computed from the 545 × 545 spectra, using masks with exactly the same point-source holes as those used to compute the 100 × 100, 143 × 143, 143 × 217, and 217 × 217 power spectra that are used in the likelihood. The Plik likelihood adopts a similar approach and the CamSpec and Plik dust templates are in very good agreement.\n\nIn forming the temperature likelihood, we apply multipole cuts to the temperature spectra as follows: ℓmin = 30, ℓmax = 1200 for the 100 × 100 spectrum; ℓmin = 30, ℓmax = 2000 for the 143 × 143 spectrum; and ℓmin = 500, ℓmax = 2500 for 143 × 217 and 217 × 217. As discussed in previous papers, the ℓmin cuts applied to the 143 × 217 and 217 × 217 spectra are imposed to reduce any potential systematic biases arising from Galactic dust at these frequencies. A foreground model is included in computing the covariance matrices, assuming that foregrounds are isotropic and Gaussian. This model underestimates the contribution of Galactic dust to the covariances, since this component is anisotropic on the sky. However, dust always makes a very small contribution to the covariance matrices in the CamSpec likelihood. Mak et al. (2017) describe a simple model to account for the Galactic dust contributions to covariance matrices.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that these changes to the 2018 CamSpec TT likelihood are largely cosmetic and have very little impact on cosmological parameters. This can be assessed by comparing the CamSpec TT results reported in this paper with those in PCP15. The main changes in cosmological parameters from the TT likelihood come from the tighter constraints on the optical depth, τ, adopted in this paper.\n\nIn polarization, CamSpec uses a different methodology to Plik. In temperature, there are a number of frequency-dependent foregrounds at high multipoles that are described by a physically motivated parametric model containing “nuisance” parameters. These nuisance parameters are sampled, along with cosmological parameters, during Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) exploration of the likelihood. The TT likelihood is therefore a power-spectrum-based component-separation tool and it is essential to retain cross-power spectra for each distinct frequency combination. For the PlanckTE and EE spectra, however, Galactic dust is by far the dominant foreground contribution. At the multipoles and sensitivities accessible to Planck, polarized point sources make a negligible contribution to the foreground (as verified by ACTPol and SPTpol; Louis et al. 2017; Henning et al. 2018), so the only foreground that needs to be subtracted is polarized Galactic dust emission. As described in PCP15, we subtract polarized dust emission from each TE/ET and EE spectrum using the 353 GHz half-mission maps. This is done in an analogous way to the construction of 545 GHz-cleaned temperature maps described in PCP15 and Appendix A. Since the 353 GHz maps are noisy at high multipoles we use the cleaned spectra at multipoles ≤300 and extrapolate the dust model to higher multipoles by fitting power laws to the dust estimates at lower multipoles.\n\nThe polarization spectra are then corrected for temperature-to-polarization leakage and effective polarization efficiencies as described below, assuming a fiducial theoretical power spectrum. The corrected TE/ET spectra and EE spectra for all half-mission cross-spectra constructed from 100-, 143-, and 217 GHz maps are then coadded to form a single TE spectrum and a single EE spectrum for the CamSpec likelihood. The polarization part of the CamSpec likelihood therefore contains no nuisance parameters other than overall calibration factors cTE and cEE for the TE and EE spectra. Since the CamSpec likelihood uses coadded TE and EE spectra, we do not need to bin the spectra to form a TT,TE,EE likelihood. The polarization masks used in CamSpec are based on 353–143 GHz polarization maps that are degraded in resolution and thresholded on P = (Q2 + U2)1/2. The default CamSpec polarization mask used for the 2018 analysis preserves a fraction fsky = 57.7% and is apodized to give an effective sky fraction (see equation 10 of PCP15) of . We use the same polarization mask for all frequencies. The CamSpec polarization masks differ from those used in the Plik likelihood, which uses intensity-thresholded masks in polarization (and therefore a larger effective sky area in polarization, as described in the previous section).\n\nTo construct covariance matrices, temperature-to-polarization leakage corrections, and effective polarization efficiencies, we need to adopt a fiducial model. For the 2018 analysis, we adopted the best-fit CamSpec base-ΛCDM model from PCP15 to construct a likelihood from the 2018 temperature maps. We then ran a minimizer on the TT likelihood, imposing a prior of τ = 0.05 ± 0.02, and the best-fit base-ΛCDM cosmology was adopted as our fiducial model. To deal with temperature-to-polarization leakage, we used the QuickPol polarized beam matrices to compute corrections to the TE and EE spectra assuming the fiducial model. The temperature-to-polarization leakage corrections are relatively small for TE spectra (although they have some impact on cosmological parameters, consistent with the behaviour of the Plik likelihood described in the previous section), but are negligible for EE spectra.\n\nTo correct for effective polarization efficiencies (including large-scale transfer functions arising from errors in the polarized beams) we recalibrated each TE, ET, and EE spectrum against the fiducial model spectra by minimizing\n\n(3)\n\nwith respect to αP, where is the beam-corrected data spectrum (TE, ET, or EE) corrected for temperature-to-polarization leakage, M is the covariance matrix for the appropriate spectrum, and the sums extend over 200 ≤ ℓ ≤ 1000. We calibrate each TE and EE spectrum individually, rather than computing map-based polarization calibrations. Although there is a good correspondence between spectrum-based calibrations and map-based calibrations, we find evidence for some differences, particularly for the 143 × 143 EE spectrum in agreement with the Plik analysis. Unlike Plik, we adopt spectrum-based calibrations of polarization efficiencies in preference to map-based calibrations.\n\nAs in temperature, we apply multipole cuts to the polarization spectra prior to coaddition in order to reduce sensitivity to dust subtraction, beam estimation, and noise modelling. For TE/ET spectra we use: ℓmin = 30 and ℓmax = 1200 for the 100 × 100, 100 × 143 and 100 × 217 spectra; ℓmin = 30 and ℓmax = 2000 for 143 × 143 and 143 × 217; and ℓmin = 500 and ℓmax = 2500 for the 217 × 217 cross-spectrum. For EE, we use: ℓmin = 30 and ℓmax = 1000 for 100 × 100; ℓmin = 30 and ℓmax = 1200 for 100 × 143; ℓmin = 200 and ℓmax = 1200 for 100 × 217; ℓmin = 30 and ℓmax = 1500 for 143 × 143; ℓmin = 300 and ℓmax = 2000 for 143 × 217; and ℓmin = 500 and ℓmax = 2000 for 217 × 217. Since dust is subtracted from the polarization spectra, we do not include a dust model in the polarization covariance matrices. Note that at low multipoles, ℓ ≲ 300, Galactic dust dominates over the CMB signal in EE at all frequencies. We experimented with different polarization masks and different multipole cuts and found stable results from the CamSpec polarization likelihood.\n\nTo summarize, for the TT data Plik and CamSpec use very similar methodologies and a similar foreground model, and the power spectra used in the likelihoods only differ in the handling of missing pixels. As a result, there is close agreement between the two temperature likelihoods. In polarization, different polarization masks are applied and different methods are used for correcting Galactic dust, effective polarization calibrations, and temperature-to-polarization leakage. In addition, the polarization covariance matrices differ at low multipoles. As described in Appendix A, the two codes give similar results in polarization for base ΛCDM and most of the extensions of ΛCDM considered in this paper, and there would be no material change to most of the science conclusions in this paper were one to use the CamSpec likelihood in place of Plik. However, in cases where there are differences that could have an impact on the scientific interpretation (e.g., for AL, ∑mν, and ΩK) we show results from both codes. This should give the reader an impression of the sensitivity of the science results to different methodologies and choices made in constructing the polarization blocks of the high-multipole likelihoods.\n\n2.2.3. The low-ℓ likelihood\n\nThe HFI low-ℓ polarization likelihood is based on the full-mission HFI 100 GHz and 143 GHz Stokes Q and U low-resolution maps, cleaned through a template-fitting procedure using LFI 30 GHz (Planck Collaboration II 2020) and HFI 353 GHz maps9, which are used as tracers of polarized synchrotron and thermal dust, respectively (for details about the cleaning procedure see PPL18). Power spectra are calculated based on a quadratic maximum-likelihood estimation of the cross-spectrum between the 100- and 143 GHz data, and the multipole range used spans ℓ = 2 to ℓ = 29.\n\nWe only use the EE likelihood (“lowE”) for the main parameter results in this paper. The likelihood code, called SimAll, is based on the power spectra. It is constructed using an extension of the SimBaL algorithm presented in Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI (2016), using 300 end-to-end simulations characterizing the HFI noise and residual systematics (see Planck Collaboration III 2020, for details) to build an empirical probability distribution of the EE spectra (ignoring the off-diagonal correlations). The TE spectrum at low multipoles does not provide tight constraints compared to EE because of cosmic variance. However, PPL18 discusses the TE spectra at low multipoles constructed by cross-correlating the Commander component-separated map with the 100- and 143 GHz maps. The TE spectra show excess variance compared to simulations at low multipoles, most notably at ℓ = 5 and at ℓ = 18 and 19, for reasons that are not understood. No attempt has been made to fold in Commander component-separation errors in the statistical analysis. We have therefore excluded the TE spectrum at low multipoles (with the added benefit of simplifying the construction of the SimAll likelihood). Little information is lost by discarding the TE spectrum. Evidently, further work is required to understand the behaviour of TE at low multipoles; however, as discussed in PPL18, the τ constraint derived from TE to ℓmax = 10 (τ = 0.051 ± 0.015) is consistent with results derived from the SimAll EE likelihood summarized below.\n\nUsing the SimAll likelihood combined with the low-ℓ temperature Commander likelihood (see Planck Collaboration IV 2020), varying ln(1010As) and τ, but fixing other cosmological parameters to those of a fiducial base-ΛCDM model (with parameters very close to those of the baseline ΛCDM cosmology in this paper), PPL18 reports the optical depth measurement10\n\n(4)\n\nThis is significantly tighter than the LFI-based constraint used in the 2015 release (τ = 0.067 ± 0.022), and differs by about half a sigma from the result of Planck Collaboration Int. XLVI (2016) (τ = 0.055 ± 0.009). The latter change is driven mainly by the removal of the last 1000 scanning rings in the 2018 SRoll maps, higher variance in the end-to-end simulations, and differences in the 30 GHz map used as a synchrotron tracer (see Appendix A of Planck Collaboration II 2020). The impact of the tighter optical depth measurement on cosmological parameters compared to the 2015 release is discussed in Sect. 3.6. The error model in the final likelihood does not fully include all modelling uncertainties and differences between likelihood codes, but the different approaches lead to estimates of τ that are consistent within their respective 1σ errors.\n\nIn addition to the default SimAll lowE likelihood used in this paper, the LFI polarization likelihood has also been updated for the 2018 release, as described in detail in PPL18. It gives consistent results to SimAll, but with larger errors (τ = 0.063 ± 0.020); we give a more detailed comparison of the various τ constraints in Sect. 7.8.\n\nThe low-ℓ temperature likelihood is based on maps from the Commander component-separation algorithm, as discussed in detail in Planck Collaboration IV (2020), with a Gibbs-sample-based Blackwell-Rao likelihood that accurately accounts for the non-Gaussian shape of the posterior at low multipoles, as in 2015. The CMB maps that are used differ in several ways from the 2015 analysis. Firstly, since the 2018 analysis does not produce individual bolometer maps (since it is optimized to reduce large-scale polarization systematics) the number of foreground components that can be constrained is reduced compared to 2015. The 2018 Commander analysis only fits the CMB, a single general low-frequency power-law component, thermal dust, and a single CO component with spatially constant line ratios between 100, 217, and 353 GHz. Secondly, the 2018 analysis is based only on Planck data and so does not including the WMAP and Haslam 408 MHz maps. Finally, in order to be conservative with respect to CO emission, the sky fraction has been reduced to 86% coverage, compared to 93% in 2015. The net effect is a small increase in errors, and the best-fit data points are correspondingly slightly more scattered compared to 2015. The (arbitrary) normalization of the Commander likelihood was also changed, so that a theory power spectrum equal to the best-fit power spectrum points will, by definition, give .\n\n2.2.4. Likelihood notation\n\nThroughout this paper, we adopt the following labels for likelihoods: (i) Planck TT+lowE denotes the combination of the high-ℓ TT likelihood at multipoles ℓ ≥ 30, the low-ℓ temperature-only Commander likelihood, and the low-ℓ EE likelihood from SimAll; (ii) labels such as Planck TE+lowE denote the TE likelihood at ℓ ≥ 30 plus the low-ℓ EE SimAll likelihood; and (iii) Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE denotes the combination of the combined likelihood using TT, TE, and EE spectra at ℓ ≥ 30, the low-ℓ temperature Commander likelihood, and the low-ℓ SimAll EE likelihood. For brevity we sometimes drop the “Planck” qualifier where it should be clear, and unless otherwise stated high-ℓ results are based on the Plik likelihood. TE correlations at ℓ ≤ 29 are not included in any of the results presented in this paper.\n\n2.2.5. Uncertainties on cosmological parameters\n\nTo maximize the accuracy of the results, various choices can be made in the construction of the high-multipole likelihoods. Examples of these are the sky area, noise models, multipole ranges, frequencies, foreground parameterization, and priors, as detailed for this release of Planck data in PPL18. The cosmological parameters and their uncertainties depend on these options. It is therefore necessary to test the sensitivity of the results with respect to such choices. In particular, when removing or adding independent information (e.g., by lifting or adding priors, or by measuring parameters from different multipole ranges), we do expect cosmological parameters to shift. The crucial question, however, is whether these are in agreement with statistical expectations. If they are consistent with being statistical excursions, then the noise model, along with foreground and instrumental nuisance parameters (e.g., polarization efficiencies), may be a consistent representation of the data. In this case, the uncertainties quoted in this paper should accurately describe the combined noise and sample variance due to finite data. Different choices of sky area, multipole range, etc., will produce changes in the parameters, but they will be adequately described by the quoted uncertainties. On the other hand, if the shifts do not agree with statistical expectations, they might be an indication of unmodelled systematic effects.\n\nIn PPL18 we discuss a series of tests indicating the overall robustness of our results. Internal to the Plik likelihood code, we consider the CMB spectra, errors, and resulting parameters as we vary the input data, ℓ range, sky area, etc. We also consider the effect of known sources of systematic uncertainty, such as high-frequency oscillations in the raw time-ordered data and temperature-to-polarization leakage. We further test the baseline likelihood using extensive simulations; these tests demonstrate the solidity of our results. As a specific example, when lifting all priors on nuisance parameters (such as calibration and foregrounds), the posterior mean on the number of relativistic species Neff shifts upwards by about 1σ. We quantify in PPL18 that this is statistically not anomalous, since lifting priors reduces information and, as a consequence, error bars also increase.\n\nOnly in a small number of areas, do such tests show mild internal disagreements at the level of spectra and parameters. One example is the higher than expected χ2 of the Plik TE frequency-likelihood, which can be traced back to a small mismatch between the different cross-frequency spectra. When we co-add the foreground-cleaned frequency TE spectra into one CMB spectrum (which is less sensitive to such a mismatch), the related χ2 is in better agreement with expectations. A second example is the choice of polarization-efficiency corrections, which has a small impact on the final results and is further discussed below.\n\nWe have also compared the results from the Plik likelihood with those obtained with CamSpec in Sects. 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 and Appendix A, as well as in PPL18 (see also Efstathiou & Gratton 2019). Some of the likelihood choices (e.g., sky area and multipole range) will give different detailed results within the expected sample variance. Others, such as the models for noise (bias-corrected half-ring difference for Plik versus odd-even rings for CamSpec) and polarization efficiency, may give a hint of residual systematic uncertainties. If we restrict ourselves to temperature, the Plik and CamSpec likelihoods are in excellent accord, with most parameters agreeing to better than 0.5σ (0.2σ on the ΛCDM model). On the other hand, we find indications (discussed in more detail in PPL18) that the polarization efficiencies of the frequency-channel maps differ when measured in the TE or EE spectra, and the Plik and CamSpec likelihoods have explored different choices of polarization efficiency corrections. This and polarization-noise modelling may be responsible for differences in the details of the resulting polarization spectra and parameters.\n\nFor the base-ΛCDM model, the results from Plik and CamSpec for the TT,TE,EE likelihoods are in good agreement (see Table 1), again with most parameters agreeing to better than 0.5σ. We also find differences between the Plik and CamSpec TTTEEE likelihoods for some extended models, especially for the single-parameter extensions with AL (at 0.7σ) and ΩK (at 0.5σ); these differences are discussed in Sects. 6.2 and 7.3, respectively, where we show results for both likelihoods. For both AL and ΩK, the Plik TT,TE,EE likelihood pulls away from the base-ΛCDM model with a slightly higher significance than the CamSpec TT,TE,EE likelihood. The is due, at least in part, to the choice of how to model polarization efficiencies, as discussed in PPL18. For the ΩK case, for example, the Δχ2 between the ΛCDM and ΛCDM+ΩK models for TT,TE,EE+lowE is Δχ2 = 11, of which 8.3 Δχ points are due to the improvement of the Plik TT,TE,EE likelihood. Using spectrum-based polarization efficiencies, instead of map-based ones11 reduces that total difference to Δχ2 = 5.2, of which Δχ2 = 4.6 is due to the Plik likelihood. This is in agreement with the Δχ2 value obtained for these models by CamSpec, which uses spectrum-based polarization efficiencies, with Δχ2 = 4.3.\n\nOther details of choices in the likelihood functions impact the difference in parameters; however, these comprise both expected statistical fluctuations (due to differing raw data cuts and sky coverage) and possible residual systematic errors. For both extended models the Planck TTTEEE likelihoods are usually combined with other data to break parameter degeneracies. For these parameters, the addition of either Planck lensing or BAO data overwhelms any differences between the Plik and CamSpec likelihoods and so we find almost identical results.\n\nIn this paper we therefore do not explicitly model an increase in error bars due to these residual systematic errors – any such characterization would inevitably be incomplete, and it would also be impossible to give the necessary probabilistic characterization required for meaningful quantitative error bars. Instead our best-fit values, posterior means, errors and limits should (as always) be considered as conditional on the cosmological model and our best knowledge of the Planck instruments and astrophysical foregrounds, as captured by the baseline likelihoods.\n\n2.3. The CMB lensing likelihood\n\nThe CMB photons that arrive here today traverse almost the entire observable Universe. Along the way their paths are deflected by gradients in the gravitational potentials associated with inhomogeneities in the Universe (Blanchard & Schneider 1987). The dominant effects (e.g., Lewis & Challinor 2006; Hanson et al. 2010) are a smoothing of the acoustic peaks, conversion of E-mode polarization to B-mode polarization, and generation of a connected 4-point function, each of which can be measured in high angular resolution, low-noise observations, such as those from Planck.\n\nPlanck was the first experiment to measure the lensing signal to sufficient precision for it to become important for the determination of cosmological parameters, providing sensitivity to parameters that affect the late-time expansion, geometry, and clustering (Planck Collaboration XVII 2014, hereafter PL2013). In Planck Collaboration XV (2016, hereafter PL2015) the Planck lensing reconstruction was improved by including polarization information. The Planck lensing measurement is still the most significant detection of CMB lensing to date. In this final data release we report a measurement of the power spectrum of the lensing potential, , from the 4-point function, with a precision of around 2.6% on the amplitude, as discussed in detail in PL2018. We demonstrate the robustness of the reconstruction to a variety of tests over lensing multipoles 8 ≤ L ≤ 400, and conservatively restrict the likelihood to this range to reduce the impact of possible systematics. Compared to 2015, the multipole range is extended from Lmin = 40 down to Lmin = 8, with other analysis changes mostly introducing random fluctuations in the band powers, due to improvements in the noise modelling and the somewhat different mixture of frequencies being used in the foreground-cleaned SMICA maps (see Planck Collaboration IV 2020). The signal-to-noise per multipole is almost the same as in 2015, which, combined with the wider multipole range, makes the likelihood just slightly more powerful than in 2015. CMB lensing can provide complementary information to the Planck CMB power spectra, since it it probes much lower redshifts, including z ≲ 2, when dark energy becomes important. The lensing effect depends on the propagation of photons on null geodesics, and hence depends on the background geometry and Weyl potential (the combination of scalar metric perturbations that determines the Weyl spacetime curvature tensor; see e.g. Lewis & Challinor (2006)).\n\nWe approximate the lensing likelihood as Gaussian in the estimated band powers, making perturbative corrections for the small dependence of band powers on the cosmology, as described in PL2015. We neglect correlations between the 2- and 4-point functions, which are negligible at Planck sensitivity (Schmittfull et al. 2013; Peloton et al. 2017). As in PL2015, band powers at multipoles L > 400 are less robust than over 8 ≤ L ≤ 400, with some evidence for a curl-test failure, and possibly also systematic differences between individual frequencies that we were unable to resolve. Multipoles at L < 8 are very sensitive to the large mean-field correction on these scales, and hence are sensitive to the fidelity of the simulations used to estimate the mean field. As described above, our baseline cosmological results therefore conservatively use only the multipole range 8 ≤ L ≤ 400.\n\nThe Planck measurements of are plotted in Fig. 3, where they are compared to the predicted spectrum from the best-fitting base-ΛCDM model of Sect. 3, and Fig. 4 shows the corresponding broad redshift ranges that contribute to the lensing band powers in the ΛCDM model. Figure 3 shows that the lensing data are in excellent agreement with the predictions inferred from the CMB power spectra in the base-ΛCDM model ( for 9 binned conservative band-power measurements, for 14 bins over the full multipole range; we discuss agreement in extensions to the ΛCDM model in more detail below). The lensing data prefer lensing power spectra that are slightly tilted towards less power on small scales compared to the best fit to the CMB power spectra. This small tilt pulls joint constraints a small fraction of an error bar towards parameters that give a lower lensing amplitude on small scales. Parameter results from the full multipole range would be a little tighter and largely consistent with the conservative band powers, although preferring slightly lower fluctuation amplitudes (see PL2018).\n\nAs described in detail in PL2018, the lensing likelihood (in combination with some weak priors) can alone provide ΛCDM parameter constraints that are competitive with current galaxy lensing and clustering, measuring\n\n(5)\n\nCombined with BAO (see Sect. 5.1 below) and a baryon density prior to break the main degeneracy between H0, Ωm, and σ8 (described in PL2015), individual parameters H0, Ωm, and σ8 can also separately be constrained to a precision of a few percent. We use Ωbh2 = 0.0222 ± 0.0005 (motivated by the primordial deuterium abundance measurements of Cooke et al. 2018, see also Sect. 7.6), which gives\n\n(6)\n\nThe constraints of Eq. (5) and (6) in are in very good agreement with the estimates derived from the Planck power spectra and are independent of how the Planck power spectra depend on the cosmological model at high multipoles. This is a strong test of the internal consistency of the Planck data. The Planck lensing constraints in Eqs. (5) and (6), and the consistency of these results with the Planck power spectrum likelihoods, should be borne in mind when comparing Planck results with other astrophysical data (e.g., direct measurements of H0 and galaxy shear surveys, see Sect. 5).\n\nIn this paper, we focus on joint constraints with the main Planck power spectrum results, where the lensing power spectrum tightens measurements of the fluctuation amplitude and improves constraints on extended models, especially when allowing for spatial curvature.\n\nA peculiar feature of the Planck TT likelihood, reported in PCP13 and PCP15, is the favouring of high values for the lensing consistency parameter AL (at about 2.5σ). This result is discussed in detail in Sect. 6.2. It is clear from Fig. 3, however, that the Planck lensing likelihood prefers values of AL close to unity and cosmological parameters that are close to those of the best-fit base-ΛCDM parameters derived from the Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing likelihood (i.e., without allowing AL to vary).\n\n3. Constraints on base ΛCDM\n\nThe Planck measurement of seven acoustic peaks in the CMB temperature power spectrum allows cosmological parameters to be constrained extremely accurately. In previous papers, we have focussed on parameters derived from the TT power spectrum. The TE and EE polarization spectra provide a powerful consistency check on the underlying model and also help to break some partial parameter degeneracies. The goal of this section is to explore the consistency of cosmological parameters of the base-ΛCDM cosmology determined from TT, TE, and EE spectra and to present results from the combinations of these spectra, which are significantly more precise that those determined using TT alone.\n\nFigure 5 shows 2-dimensional marginalized constraints on the six MCMC sampling parameters of the base-ΛCDM model used to explore the parameter posteriors, plotted against the following derived parameters: the Hubble constant H0, late-time clustering amplitude σ8 and matter density parameter Ωm (defined including a 0.06 eV mass neutrino). Table 1 gives individual parameter constraints using our baseline parameter combination Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing. These represent the legacy results on the cosmological ΛCDM parameters from the Planck satellite, and are currently the most precise measurements coming from a single CMB experiment. We give the best-fit values, as well as the marginalized posterior mean values, along with the corresponding 68% probability intervals. Table 1 also quantifies the small changes in parameters that are found when using the Plik and CamSpec high-ℓ polarization analyses described in Sect. 2.2 and Appendix A. Table 2 gives marginalized parameter constraints from the various CMB spectra, individually and without CMB lensing, including a wider variety of derived parameters of physical interest.\n\nWe now discuss in more detail the parameters that are most directly measured by the data and how these relate to constraints on individual parameters of more general interest.\n\n3.1. Acoustic scale\n\nThe acoustic oscillations in ℓ seen in the CMB power spectra correspond to a sharply-defined acoustic angular scale on the sky, given by θ* ≡ r*/DM where r* is the comoving sound horizon at recombination quantifying the distance the photon-baryon perturbations can influence, and DM is the comoving angular diameter distance12 that maps this distance into an angle on the sky. Planck measures\n\n(7)\n\ncorresponding to a precise 0.05% measurement of the angular scale . The angular scales of the peaks in the polarization spectrum and cross-spectrum are different, since the polarization at recombination is sourced by quadrupolar flows in the photon fluid, which are out of phase with the density perturbations. The polarization spectra can, however, be used to measure the same acoustic scale parameter, giving a stringent test on the assumption of purely adiabatic perturbation driving the oscillations. From the polarization spectra we find\n\n(8a)\n\n(8b)\n\nin excellent agreement with the temperature measurement. The constraint from TE is of similar precision to that from TT: although the polarization data are much noisier, the TE and EE spectra have more distinct acoustic peaks, which helps improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the acoustic scale measurement. Using the combined likelihood we find:\n\n(9)\n\na measurement with 0.03% precision.13\n\nBecause of its simple geometrical interpretation, θ* is measured very robustly and almost independently of the cosmological model (see Table 5). It is the CMB analogue of the transverse baryon acoustic oscillation scale rdrag/DM measured from galaxy surveys, where rdrag is the comoving sound horizon at the end of the baryonic-drag epoch (see Sect. 5.1). In ΛCDM, the CMB constraint can be expressed as a tight 0.04%-precision relation between rdrag h and Ωm as\n\n(10)\n\nThe sound horizon rdrag depends primarily on the matter, baryon, and radiation densities, which for fixed observed CMB temperature today14, gives a 0.05% constraint on the combination\n\n(11)\n\nMarginalizing out the dependence on the baryon density, the remaining degeneracy between the matter density and Hubble parameters is well approximated by a constraint on the parameter combination Ωmh3 (Percival et al. 2002). We find a 0.3% constraint from Planck:\n\n(12)\n\ncorresponding to an anti-correlation between the matter density Ωmh2 and the Hubble parameter. This correlation can also be seen in Fig. 5 as an anti-correlation between the dark-matter density Ωch2 and H0, and a corresponding positive correlation between Ωch2 and Ωm.\n\n3.2. Hubble constant and dark-energy density\n\nThe degeneracy between Ωm and H0 is not exact, but the constraint on these parameters individually is substantially less precise than Eq. (12), giving\n\n(13)\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the values given in Eq. (13) assume the base-ΛCDM cosmology with minimal neutrino mass. These estimates are highly model dependent and this needs to be borne in mind when comparing with other measurements, for example the direct measurements of H0 discussed in Sect. 5.4. The values in Eq. (13) are in very good agreement with the independent constraints of Eq. (6) from Planck CMB lensing+BAO. Including CMB lensing sharpens the determination of H0 to a 0.8% constraint:\n\n(14)\n\nThis value is our “best estimate” of H0 from Planck, assuming the base-ΛCDM cosmology.\n\nSince we are considering a flat universe in this section, a constraint on Ωm translates directly into a constraint on the dark-energy density parameter, giving\n\n(15)\n\nIn terms of a physical density, this corresponds to ΩΛh2 = 0.3107 ± 0.0082, or cosmological constant in natural units (where mPl is the Planck mass).\n\n3.3. Optical depth and the fluctuation amplitude\n\nSince the CMB fluctuations are linear up to lensing corrections, and the lensing corrections are largely oscillatory, the average observed CMB power spectrum amplitude scales nearly proportionally with the primordial comoving curvature power spectrum amplitude As (which we define at the pivot scale k0 = 0.05 Mpc−1). The sub-horizon CMB anisotropies are however scattered by free electrons that are present after reionization, so the observed amplitude actually scales with Ase−2τ, where τ is the reionization optical depth (see Sect. 7.8 for further discussion of reionization constraints). This parameter combination is therefore well measured, with the 0.6% constraint\n\n(16)\n\nIn this final Planck release the optical depth is well constrained by the large-scale polarization measurements from the Planck HFI, with the joint constraint\n\n(17)\n\nAssuming simple tanh parameterization of the ionization fraction15, this implies a mid-point redshift of reionization\n\n(18)\n\nand a one-tail upper limit of zre < 9.0 (95%). This is consistent with observations of high-redshift quasars that suggest the Universe was fully reionized by z ≈ 6 (Bouwens et al. 2015). We do not include the astrophysical constraint that zre ≳ 6.5 in our default parameter results, but if required results including this prior are part of the published tables on the PLA. A more detailed discussion of reionization histories consistent with Planck and results from other Planck likelihoods is deferred to Sect. 7.8.\n\nThe measurement of the optical depth breaks the Ase−2τ degeneracy, giving a 1.5% measurement of the primordial amplitude:\n\n(19)\n\nSince the optical depth is reasonably well constrained, degeneracies with other cosmological parameters contribute to the error in Eq. (19). From the temperature spectrum alone there is a significant degeneracy between Ase−2τ and Ωmh2, since for fixed θ*, larger values of these parameters will increase and decrease the small-scale power, respectively. This behaviour is mitigated in our joint constraint with polarization because the polarization spectra have a different dependence on Ωmh2; polarization is generated by causal sub-horizon quadrupole scattering at recombination, but the temperature spectrum has multiple sources and is also sensitive to non-local redshifting effects as the photons leave the last-scattering surface (see, e.g., Galli et al. 2014, for further discussion).\n\nAssuming the ΛCDM model, the Planck CMB parameter amplitude constraint can be converted into a fluctuation amplitude at thepresent day, conventionally quantified by the σ8 parameter. The CMB lensing reconstruction power spectrum also constrains the late-time fluctuation amplitude more directly, in combination with the matter density. Figure 6 shows constraints on the matter density and amplitude parameter combination that is well measured by the CMB lensing spectrum (see PL2015 for details). There is good consistency between the temperature, polarization, and lensing constraints here, and using their combination significantly reduces the allowed parameter space. In terms of the late-time fluctuation amplitude parameter σ8 we find the combined result\n\n(20)\n\nMeasurements of galaxy clustering, galaxy lensing, and clusters can also measure σ8, and we discuss consistency of these constraints within the ΛCDM model in more detail in Sect. 5.\n\n3.4. Scalar spectral index\n\nThe scale-dependence of the CMB power spectrum constrains the slope of the primordial scalar power spectrum, conventionally parameterized by the power-law index ns, where ns = 1 corresponds to a scale-invariant spectrum. The matter and baryon densities also affect the scale-dependence of the CMB spectra, but in a way that differs from a variation in ns, leading to relatively mild degeneracies between these parameters. Assuming that the primordial power spectrum is an exact power law we find\n\n(21)\n\nwhich is 8σ away from scale-invariance (ns = 1), confirming the red tilt of the spectrum at high significance in ΛCDM. Section 7.2 and Planck Collaboration X (2020) discuss the implications of this result for models of inflation and include constraints on models with primordial tensor modes and a scale-dependent scalar spectral index.\n\n3.5. Matter densities\n\nThe matter density can be measured from the CMB spectra using the scale-dependence of the amplitude, since for fixed θ* a larger matter density reduces the small-scale CMB power. The matter density also affects the amount of lensing in the CMB spectra and the amplitude of the CMB-lensing reconstruction spectrum. The matter density is well constrained to be\n\n(22)\n\nThe matter mostly consists of cold dark matter, with density constrained at the percent level:\n\n(23)\n\nChanges in the baryon density affect the spectrum in characteristic ways, modifying the relative heights of the even and odd acoustic peaks, due to the effect of baryons on the depth of first and subsequent acoustic (de)compressions. Despite comprising less than a sixth of the total matter content, the baryon effects on the power spectra are sufficiently distinctive that the baryon-density parameter is measured at sub-percent level accuracy with Planck:\n\n(24)\n\nThere is a partial degeneracy with ns, which can also affect the relative heights of the first few peaks. This is most evident in TE, but is reduced in TT because of the larger range of scales that are measured by Planck with low noise.\n\n3.6. Changes in the base-ΛCDM parameters between the 2015 and 2018 data releases\n\nFigure 7 compares the parameters of the base-ΛCDM model measured from the final data release with those reported in PCP15. To differentiate between changes caused by the new lowE polarization likelihood, and therefore generated by the change in the measured optical depth to reionization, we also show the result of using the 2015 likelihoods in combination with the 2018 lowE polarization likelihood at low multipoles. Figure 7 includes the results for both Planck TT+lowE and Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE16\n\nThe main differences in ΛCDM parameters between the 2015 and the 2018 releases are caused by the following effects.\n\nNew polarization low-ℓ likelihood. The use of the new HFI low-ℓ polarization likelihood in place of the 2015 LFI likelihood is the largest cause of shifts between the 2015 and 2018 parameters. The lowering and tightening of the constraint on τ is responsible for a 1σ decrease of ln(1010As) through the Ase−2τ degeneracy. This in turn decreases the smoothing due to gravitational lensing at high multipoles, which is compensated by an increase of about 1σ in ωc. This decreases the amplitude of the first acoustic peak, so ns shifts to a lower value by about 0.5σ to restore power. Further adjustments are then achieved by the changes of θ* and ωb by about 0.5σ.\n\nPolarization corrections in the high-ℓ likelihood. As described in detail in Sect. 2.2, the largest changes from 2015 are caused by corrections applied to the polarization spectra. To isolate the causes of shifts introduced by changes in the high-ℓ likelihood, Fig. 8 compares 2018 results neglecting corrections to the polarization spectra with results from the 2015 high-ℓ likelihood combined with the 2018 lowE likelihood (so that both sets of results are based on similar constraints on τ). The shift towards larger values in ωb by around 1σ is mainly caused by the beam-leakage correction in the TE high-ℓ likelihood, which is also responsible for an increase of approximately 0.5σ in ns, compensating for the shift in ns as a result of the change in τ since 2015. The beam-leakage correction also changes ωc (by −0.7σ) and θMC (+0.7σ). The other corrections implemented in 2018 have a smaller impact on the ΛCDM parameters, as described in detail in Planck Collaboration V (2020).\n\nFigure 9 presents the differences between the coadded spectra from 2018 and 2015. This plot shows the stability of the TT spectra, while also demonstrating that the main differences in polarization between the 2015 and 2018 releases are caused by the 2018 corrections for polarization efficiencies and beam leakage.\n\n4. Comparison with high-resolution experiments\n\nAs discussed in PCP13 and PCP15, PlanckTT spectra are statistically much more powerful than temperature data from current high-resolution experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT, e.g., Das et al. 2014) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT, e.g., Story et al. 2013; George et al. 2015). As a result, the Planck temperature data dominate if they are combined with ACT and SPT data. In PCP15, the high-resolution temperature data were used only to constrain low-amplitude components of the foreground model, which are otherwise weakly constrained by Planck data alone (with very little impact on cosmological parameters). We adopt the same approach in this paper.\n\nSince the publication of PCP15, Hou et al. (2018) have performed a direct map-based comparison of the SPT temperature data at 150 GHz with the Planck 143 GHz maps over the same area of sky (covering 2540 deg2), finding no evidence for any systematic error in either data set after accounting for an overall difference in calibration. Temperature power spectrum comparisons between Planck and SPT are reported in a companion paper by Aylor et al. (2017). They find cosmological parameters for base ΛCDM derived from Planck and SPT over the same patch of sky and multipole range to be in excellent agreement. In particular, by comparing parameters determined over the multipole range 650–2000 from both experiments, the reduction in sample variance allows a test that is sensitive to systematic errors that could cause shifts in parameter posteriors comparable to the widths of the PCP15 posteriors. The parameters determined over the SPT sky area differ slightly, but not significantly, from the best-fit ΛCDM parameters reported in PCP15 based on a much larger area of sky. Aylor et al. (2017) also find a tendency for the base-ΛCDM parameters derived from SPT to shift as the multipole range is increased, but at low statistical significance.\n\nPolarization measurements have become a major focus for ground-based CMB experiments. High resolution TE and EE spectra have been measured by the ACT Polarimeter (ACTPol) and the polarization-sensitive receiver of SPT (SPTpol). Following two seasons of observations, ACTPol has covered 548 deg2 along the celestial equator at 149 GHz with data and analysis presented in Naess et al. (2014) and Louis et al. (2017). The ACTPol spectra span the multipole range 350 < ℓ < 9000. SPTpol polarization spectra from 100 deg2 in the southern hemisphere at 150 GHz were first reported in Crites et al. (2015) and recently extended to 500 deg2 (Henning et al. 2018). The SPTpol spectra span the multipole range 50 < ℓ < 8000. In contrast, the PlanckTE and EE power spectra lose statistical power at multipoles ≳1500. The ACTPol and SPTpol spectra are compared with the PlanckTE and EE spectra in Fig. 10. The polarization spectra measured from these three very different experiments are in excellent agreement.\n\nFor the base-ΛCDM cosmology, the cosmological parameters should have converged close to their true values by multipoles ∼2000. Since ACTPol and SPTpol cover a much smaller sky area than Planck the errors on their TE and EE spectra are larger than those of Planck at low multipoles (see Fig. 10). As a consequence, the current ACTPol and SPTpol polarization constraints on the parameters of the base-ΛCDM cosmology are much weaker than those derived from Planck. The ACTPol results (Louis et al. 2017) are consistent with the Planck base-ΛCDM parameters and showed a small improvement in constraints on extensions to the base cosmology that affect the damping tail. Similar results were found by SPTpol, though Henning et al. (2018) noted a ≳2σ tension with the base-ΛCDM model and found a trend for the parameters of the base-ΛCDM model to drift away from the Planck solution as the SPTpol likelihood is extended to higher multipoles. To assess these results we have performed some tests of the consistency of the latest Planck results and the SPTpol spectra.\n\nAs a reference model for SPTpol we adopt the base-ΛCDM parameters for the combined TE + EE fit to the SPTpol data from Table 5 of Henning et al. (2018). It is worth noting that the best-fit SPTpol cosmology is strongly excluded by the PlanckTT spectra and by the PlanckTE + EE spectra. We use the Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing base-ΛCDM best-fit cosmology (as plotted in Fig. 10) as a reference model for Planck. For each model, we ran the public version of the SPTpol likelihood code17 sampling the nuisance parameters using the same priors as in Henning et al. (2018). The best-fit values of χ2 are listed in Table 3. As in Henning et al. (2018), in assigning significance levels to these values, we take the number of degrees of freedom to be equal to the number of band powers minus eight, corresponding to five cosmological parameters (ωb, ωc, θMC, ns, Ase−2τ) and three nuisance parameters with flat priors.\n\nAs found by Henning et al. (2018), the SPTpol TE spectrum gives nearly identical values of χ2 for both the SPTpol and Planck cosmologies and so does not differentiate between them; however, the χ2 values are high, at the 2.3σ level. The SPTpol EE spectrum provides weaker constraints on cosmological parameters than the TE spectrum and is clearly better fit by the SPTpol cosmology. If the SPTpol covariance matrix is accurate, the combined TE+EE SPTpol data disfavour the PlanckΛCDM cosmology quite strongly and disfavour any 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology. For ΛCDM models, outliers distributed over a wide range of multipoles contribute to the high χ2 values, notably at ℓ = 124, 324, 1874, 2449, and 3249 in TE, and ℓ = 1974 and 6499 in EE.\n\nWe can assess consistency of the parameter differences, Δp, between the two experiments by computing,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere Cp is the covariance matrix for SPTpol parameters (we neglect the errors in the Planck parameters, which are much smaller). Values for are given in Table 3 together with probabilities to exceed (PTEs) computed from a χ2 distribution with five degrees of freedom. We find no evidence for any statistically significant inconsistency between the two sets of parameters, even for the combined TE + EE SPTpol likelihood. We also note that the parameter Ase−2τ makes quite a large contribution to for the TE + EE and EE spectra, but is sensitive to possible systematic errors in the SPTpol polarization efficiency calibration (which, as discussed, is not well understood Henning et al. 2018). Varying the maximum multipole used in the SPTpol likelihood (ℓmax), we find that the parameters of the SPTpol TE + EE cosmology converge by ℓmax = 2500; higher multipoles do not contribute significantly to the SPTpol base-ΛCDM solution.\n\nHenning et al. (2018) reported a trend for the parameters of the base-ΛCDM cosmology to change as the SPTpol likelihood is extended to higher multipoles, which they suggested may be an indication of new physics. However, this effect is not of high statistical significance and cannot be tested by the Planck spectra, which become less sensitive than the SPTpol spectra at multipoles ≳1500. The consistency of the base-ΛCDM cosmology at high multipoles in polarization should become clearer in the near future as more polarization data are accumulated by ACTPol and SPTpol.\n\n5. Comparison with other astrophysical data sets\n\n5.1. Baryon acoustic oscillations\n\nAs in PCP13 and PCP15 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from galaxy redshift surveys are used as the primary non-CMB astrophysical data set in this paper. The acoustic scale measured by BAOs, at around 147 Mpc, is much larger than the scale of virialized structures. This separation of scales makes BAO measurements insensitive to nonlinear physics, providing a robust geometrical test of cosmology. It is for this reason that BAO measurements are given high weight compared to other non-CMB data in this and in previous Planck papers. BAO features in the galaxy power spectrum were first detected by Cole et al. (2005) and Eisenstein et al. (2005). Since their discovery, BAO measurements have improved in accuracy via a number of ambitious galaxy surveys. As demonstrated in PCP13 and PCP15 BAO results from galaxy surveys have been consistently in excellent agreement with the best-fit base-ΛCDM cosmology inferred from Planck. More recently, the redshift reach of BAO measurements has been increased using quasar redshift surveys and Lyman-α absorption lines detected in quasar spectra.\n\nFigure 11 summarizes the latest BAO results, updating Fig. 14 of PCP15. This plot shows the acoustic-scale distance ratio DV(z)/rdrag measured from surveys with effective redshift z, divided by the mean acoustic-scale ratio in the base-ΛCDM cosmology using Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing. Here rdrag is the comoving sound horizon at the end of the baryon drag epoch and DV is a combination of the comoving angular diameter distance DM(z) and Hubble parameter H(z):\n\n(26)\n\nThe grey bands in the figure show the ±1σ and ±2 σ ranges allowed by Planck in the base-ΛCDM cosmology.\n\nCompared to Fig. 14 of PCP15, we have replaced the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ and CMASS results of Anderson et al. (2014) with the latest BOSS data release 12 (DR12) results summarized by Alam et al. (2017). That paper reports “consensus” results on BAOs (weighting together different BAO analyses of BOSS DR12) reported by Ross et al. (2017), Vargas-Magaña et al. (2018), and Beutler et al. (2017a) in three redshift slices with effective redshifts zeff = 0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. These new measurements, shown by the red triangles in Fig. 11, are in good agreement with the Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology.\n\nBy using quasars, it has become possible to extend BAO measurements to redshifts greater than unity. Ata et al. (2018) have measured the BAO scale DV at an effective redshift of zeff = 1.52 using a sample of quasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Survey (eBOSS). This measurement is shown by the red circle in Fig. 11 and is also in very good agreement with Planck. The results of the Ata et al. (2018) analysis also agree well with other analyses of the eBOSS quasar sample (e.g., Gil-Marín et al. 2018).\n\nAt even higher redshifts BAOs have been measured in the Lyman α spectra of quasars (Delubac et al. 2015; Font-Ribera et al. 2014; Bautista et al. 2017; du Mas des Bourboux et al. 2017; de Sainte Agathe et al. 2019; Blomqvist et al. 2019). In the first preprint version of this paper, we compared the Planck results with those from BAO features measured from the flux-transmission correlations of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR12 quasars (Bautista et al. 2017) and with the cross-correlation of the Ly α forest with SDSS quasars (du Mas des Bourboux et al. 2017). The combined result on DM/rdrag from these analyses was about 2.3σ lower than expected from the best-fit Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology. The Bautista et al. (2017) and du Mas des Bourboux et al. (2017) analyses have been superseded by equivalent studies of a larger sample of SDSS DR14 quasars reported in de Sainte Agathe et al. (2019) and Blomqvist et al. (2019). The combined result for DM/rdrag from these analyses (as quoted by Blomqvist et al. 2019) is plotted as the orange hexagon on Fig. 11 and lies within 1.7σ of the Planck best-fit model. The errors on these high-redshift BAO measurements are still quite large in comparison with the galaxy measurements and so we do not include them in our default BAO compilation18.\n\nThe more recent BAO analyses solve for the positions of the BAO feature in both the line-of-sight and transverse directions (the distortion in the transverse direction caused by the background cosmology is sometimes called the Alcock-Paczynski effect, Alcock & Paczynski 1979), leading to joint constraints on the angular diameter distance DM(zeff) and the Hubble parameter H(zeff). These constraints for the BOSS DR12 analysis are plotted in Fig. 12. Samples from the Planck TT+lowE and Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing likelihood are shown in green and red, respectively, demonstrating that BAO and Planck polarization data with lensing consistently pull parameters in the same direction (towards slightly lower Ωch2). We find the same behaviour for Planck when adding polarization and lensing to the TT likelihood separately. This demonstrates the remarkable consistency of the Planck data, including polarization and CMB lensing with the galaxy BAO measurements. Evidently, the Planck base-ΛCDM parameters are in good agreement with both the isotropized DV BAO measurements plotted in Fig. 11, and with the anisotropic constraints plotted in Fig. 12.\n\nIn this paper, we use the 6dFGS and SDSS-MGS measurements of DV/rdrag (Beutler et al. 2011; Ross et al. 2015) and the final DR12 anisotropic BAO measurements of Alam et al. (2017). Since the WiggleZ volume partially overlaps that of the BOSS-CMASS sample, and the correlations have not been quantified, we do not use the WiggleZ results in this paper. It is clear from Fig. 11 that the combined BAO likelihood for the lower redshift points is dominated by the BOSS measurements.\n\nIn the base-ΛCDM model, the Planck data constrain the Hubble constant H0 and matter density Ωm to high precision:\n\n(27)\n\nWith the addition of the BAO measurements, these constraints are strengthened to\n\n(28)\n\nThese numbers are in very good agreement with the constraints given in Eq. (6), which exclude the high-multipole Planck likelihood. Section 5.4 discusses the consistency of direct measurements of H0 with these estimates and Hubble parameter measurements from the line-of-sight component of BAOs at higher redshift.\n\nAs discussed above, we have excluded Ly α BAOs from our default BAO compilation. The full likelihood for the combined Ly α and Ly α-quasar cross-correlations reported in du Mas des Bourboux et al. (2017) is not yet available; nevertheless, we can get an indication of the impact of including these measurements by assuming uncorrelated Gaussian errors on DM/rdrag and rdragH. Adding these measurements to Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE and our default BAO compilation shifts H0 higher, and Ωmh2 and σ8 lower, by approximately 0.3σ. The joint Planck+BAO result then gives DM/rdrag and rdragH at z = 2.4 lower by 0.25 and 0.3 of Planck’s σ, leaving the overall 2.3σ tension with these results almost unchanged. As shown by Aubourg et al. (2015), it is difficult to construct well-motivated extensions to the base-ΛCDM model that can resolve the tension with the Ly α BAOs. Further work is needed to assess whether the discrepancy between Planck and the Ly α BAO results is a statistical fluctuation, is caused by small systematic errors, or is a signature of new physics.\n\n5.2. Type Ia supernovae\n\nThe use of type Ia supernovae (SNe) as standard candles has been of critical importance to cosmology, leading to the discovery of cosmic acceleration (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). For ΛCDM models, however, SNe data have little statistical power compared to Planck and BAO and in this paper they are used mainly to test models involving evolving dark energy and modified gravity. For these extensions of the base cosmology, SNe data are useful in fixing the background cosmology at low redshifts, where there is not enough volume to allow high precision constraints from BAO.\n\nIn PCP15 we used the “Joint Light-curve Analysis” (JLA) sample constructed from the SNLS and SDSS SNe plus several samples of low redshift SNe described in Betoule et al. (2013, 2014) and Mosher et al. (2014). In this paper, we use the new “Pantheon” sample of Scolnic et al. (2018), which adds 276 supernovae from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey at 0.03 < z < 0.65 and various low-redshift and HST samples to give a total of 1048 supernovae spanning the redshift range 0.01 < z < 2.3. The Pantheon compilation applies cross-calibrations of the photometric systems of all of the sub-samples used to construct the final catalogue (Scolnic et al. 2015), reducing the impact of calibration systematics on cosmology19. The Pantheon data are compared to the predictions of the Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing base-ΛCDM model best fit in Fig. 13. The agreement is excellent. The JLA and Pantheon samples are consistent with each other (with Pantheon providing tighter constraints on cosmological parameters) and there would be no significant change to our science conclusions had we chosen to use the JLA sample in this paper. To illustrate this point we give results for a selection of models using both samples in the parameter tables available in the PLA; Fig. 17, illustrating inverse-distance-ladder constraints on H0 (see Sect. 5.4), shows a specific example.\n\n5.3. Redshift-space distortions\n\nThe clustering of galaxies observed in a redshift survey exhibits anisotropies induced by peculiar motions (known as redshift-space distortions, RSDs). Measurement of RSDs can provide constraints on the growth rate of structure and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum (e.g., Percival & White 2009). Since it uses non-relativistic tracers, RSDs are sensitive to the time-time component of the metric perturbation or the Newtonian potential. A comparison of the amplitude inferred from RSDs with that inferred from lensing (sensitive to the Weyl potential, see Sect. 7.4). provides a test of General Relativity.\n\nMeasurements of RSDs are usually quoted as constraints on fσ8, where for models with scale-independent growth f = dlnD/dlna. For ΛCDM, . We follow PCP15, defining\n\n(29)\n\nwhere is the density-velocity correlation in spheres of radius 8 h−1 Mpc in linear theory.\n\nMeasuring fσ8 requires modelling nonlinearities and scale-dependent bias and is considerably more complicated than estimating the BAO scale from galaxy surveys. One key problem is deciding on the precise range of scales that can be used in an RSD analysis, since there is a need to balance potential systematic errors associated with modelling nonlinearities against reducing statistical errors by extending to smaller scales. In addition, there is a partial degeneracy between distortions caused by peculiar motions and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Nevertheless, there have been substantial improvements in modelling RSDs in the last few years, including extensive tests of systematic errors using numerical simulations. Different techniques for measuring fσ8 are now consistent to within a few percent (Alam et al. 2017).\n\nFigure 14, showing fσ8 as a function of redshift, is an update of Fig. 16 from PCP15. The most significant changes from PCP15 are the new high precision measurements from BOSS DR12, shown as the red points. These points are the “consensus” BOSS D12 results from Alam et al. (2017), which averages the results from four different ways of analysing the DR12 data (Beutler et al. 2017b; Grieb et al. 2017; Sánchez et al. 2017; Satpathy et al. 2017). These results are in excellent agreement with the Planck base ΛCDM cosmology (see also Fig. 15) and provide the tightest constraints to date on the growth rate of fluctuations. We have updated the VIPERS constraints to those of the second public data release (Pezzotta et al. 2017) and added a data point from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) redshift survey (Blake et al. 2012). Two new surveys have extended the reach of RSD measurements (albeit with large errors) to redshifts greater than unity: the deep FASTSOUND emission line redshift survey (Okumura et al. 2016); and the BOSS DR14 quasar survey (Zarrouk et al. 2018). We have also added a new low redshift estimate of fσ8 from Huterer et al. (2017) at an effective redshift of zeff = 0.023, which is based on correlating deviations from the mean magnitude-redshift relation of SNe in the Pantheon sample with estimates of the nearby peculiar velocity field determined from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (Springob et al. 2014). As can be seen from Fig. 14, these growth rate measurements are consistent with the Planck base-ΛCDM cosmology over the entire redshift range 0.023 < zeff < 1.52.\n\nSince the BOSS-DR12 estimates provide the strongest constraints on RSDs, it is worth comparing these results with Planck in greater detail. Here we use the “full-shape consensus” results20 on DV, fσ8, and FAP for each of the three redshift bins from Alam et al. (2017) and the associated 9 × 9 covariance matrix, where F"
