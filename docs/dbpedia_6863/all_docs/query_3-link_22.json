        "text": "Algorithms are sets of instructions to execute tasks. The task may seem as simple as sorting alphabetically a set of words, or complex such as the reconstruction of genomes from biochemical experiments or the encryption of sensitive data for safety purposes.\n\nThere are several algorithms to accomplish the same task, but some algorithms are more efficient than others. The efficiency of an algorithm depends to the number of operations and the memory space required for its execution. If an algorithm is not efficient, it may require so much time or memory to execute that it becomes useless. The reading of genomes is an example of this fact. Reading genomes involves biochemical experiments to collect data, and algorithms to process this data on computers. The development of efficient algorithms to read genomes helped decrease its cost from billions to just hundreds of dollars.\n\nData structures refers on how the data is represented. Data structures go hand with algorithms. Different algorithms may require different data structures\n\nThis course is in algorithms, data structures and the programming language Python. It is recommended only for students should enjoy computer science and mathematics. After completing this course, students will understand how many real-world programs work, and will also be able to write their own programs in Python.\n\nPre-approved Topic List\n\n1.

The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence’s elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous or unique.\n\n36. There are two players, A and B, in Pots of gold game, and pots of gold arranged in a line, each containing some gold coins. The players can see how many coins are there in each gold pot, and each player gets alternating turns in which the player can pick a pot from either end of the line.

The longest alternating subsequence is a problem of finding a subsequence of a given sequence in which the elements are in alternating order and in which the sequence is as long as possible. In order words, we need to find the length of the longest subsequence with alternate low and high elements.\n\n39. Given an integer array, find the length of the longest subsequence formed by the consecutive integers. The subsequence should contain all distinct values, and the character set should be consecutive, irrespective of its order.\n\n40.

Strictly ascending or descending subarrays are also accepted.\n\n43. Suppose we are given n red and n blue water jugs, all of different shapes and sizes. All red jugs hold different amounts of water, as do the blue ones. Moreover, there is a blue jug for every red jug that holds the same amount of water and vice versa.
