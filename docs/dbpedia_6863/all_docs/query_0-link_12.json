        "text": "For other uses, see Tualatin (disambiguation).\n\nCity in Oregon, United States\n\nTualatin ( too-AW-lə-tin) is a city located primarily in Washington County in the U.S. state of Oregon. A small portion of the city is also located in neighboring Clackamas County. It is a southwestern suburb in the Portland Metropolitan Area that is located south of Tigard. The population was 27,942 at the 2020 census.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name of the city is taken from the Tualatin River, which flows along most of the city's northern boundary. It is probably a Native American word meaning \"lazy\" or \"sluggish\" but possibly meaning \"treeless plain\" for the plain near the river or \"forked\" for its many tributaries.[6] According to Oregon Geographic Names, a post office with the spelling \"Tualitin\" was established November 5, 1869, and the spelling changed to \"Tualatin\" in 1915.\n\nIn the 1850s, the settlement was first called Galbreath after its founder Samuel Galbreath. In 1853, Galbreath built the first bridge over the Tualatin river, and the town became known as Bridgeport. In the 1880s, John Sweek platted a town around the new railroad depot, and named the town Tualatin. It was incorporated as the City of Tualatin in 1913.[7]\n\nIn 1962, a fossilized Mastodon (Mammut americanum) was excavated in what is now the Fred Meyer parking lot. It is now on display in the lobby of Tualatin Public Library.[8] In 1972 fossils were uncovered near Fanno Creek that were determined to be a partial skeleton of a Harlan's Ground Sloth (Paramylodon harlani).[9]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1920234—1930198−15.4%1940180−9.1%195024837.8%196035944.8%1970750108.9%19807,348879.7%199015,013104.3%200022,79151.8%201026,05414.3%202027,9427.2%2022 (est.)27,797[5]−0.5%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nTualatin racial composition as of 2020[11] Race Number Percentage White (non-Hispanic) 18,957 70.6% Black or African American (non-Hispanic) 320 1.5% Native American 85 1.3% Asian 1,171 3.5% Pacific Islander 311 2.0% Other/Mixed 1,919 13.4% Hispanic or Latino 5,179 21.0%\n\nAs of the 2020 census, there were 27,942 people and 10,909 households in the city.\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 26,054 people, 10,000 households, and 6,762 families living in the city.

Built at the site of a former quarry, Bridgeport was designed to be reminiscent of an open-air European-style shopping experience. It features an 18-screen movie theater, several national and regional chain restaurants, and many chain retail stores.\n\nTualatin is also home to Nyberg Woods, a neighborhood and lifestyle center located at the conjunction of Interstate 5 and Nyberg road. Tualatin also harbors Nyberg Rivers, which opened in the fall of 2014 and is the third major retail project to be developed by CenterCal Properties in Tualatin. Following the construction of Bridgeport Village and Nyberg Woods, Nyberg Rivers contains approximately 300,000 square feet of retail, restaurant, fitness, and entertainment space.\n\nThere are many factories on the south side of town, including a large Lam Research plant that makes electrochemical deposition tools for manufacturing semiconductors.[14]\n\nKnife manufacturers CRKT and KAI USA, which owns Kershaw and Zero Tolerance Knives, as well as Shun Cutlery[15] are located in Tualatin.[16] Al Mar Knives is headquartered in Tualatin, although manufacturing is done in Japan.\n\nOregon Scientific, a manufacturer of consumer electronics products, is headquartered in Tualatin.\n\nFrom the 1960s through the 1980s, Tualatin was the home of Sunn Musical Equipment Company, a manufacturer of musical and sound reinforcement equipment.\n\nTualatin has been used as a filming location for Hollywood movies, including Thumbsucker, which was filmed at Tualatin High School.\n\nInfrastructure and services\n\n[edit]\n\nTualatin is within the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (TriMet),[17] the Portland metropolitan area's primary transit agency. TriMet service includes WES Commuter Rail, at Tualatin Station, and bus lines 36, 37, 38, 76, 96, and 97. Wilsonville-based South Metro Area Regional Transit's route 2X has a stop in Tualatin, at TriMet's Tualatin Park & Ride lot.[18] Despite being served by TriMet, Ride Connection also operates several fixed-route services within Tualatin.\n\nFire protection and emergency medical services are provided through Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue.[19] Legacy Meridian Park Hospital is located in Tualatin.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Tualatin falls incompletely under the jurisdiction of the Tigard-Tualatin School District. This district contains 10 elementary schools, three middle schools, and two high schools. Of these, five are actually located within Tualatin city limits: Bridgeport Elementary School, Byrom Elementary School, Tualatin Elementary School, Hazelbrook Middle School, and Tualatin High School.\n\nPublic schools\n\n[edit]\n\nHigh schools\n\n[edit]\n\nTualatin High School\n\nMiddle schools\n\n[edit]\n\nHazelbrook Middle School\n\nElementary schools\n\n[edit]\n\nBridgeport Elementary\n\nByrom Elementary\n\nTualatin Elementary\n\nA small section of the city is part of the West Linn-Wilsonville School District. Those students usually go to the same elementary, middle, and high schools: Stafford Primary, Athey Creek Middle School, and Wilsonville High School, respectively.\n\nAlberta Rider Elementary School on nearby Bull Mountain feeds into Twality Middle School. Students from Twality then split into either Tualatin or Tigard High School depending on zoning. Deer Creek Elementary School, which is also located on Bull Mountain, splits students between Hazelbrook or Twality Middle School. The students of Twality also split between the two high schools in this scenario.\n\nPrivate schools\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Portland Japanese School, a weekend Japanese educational program for Japanese citizens and Japanese Americans, holds its classes at Hazelbrook Middle School at Tualatin.[20] The school began holding its classes there after the school opened in 1992.[21] The school office is in Beaverton.[20]\n\nThe city also includes Arbor School of Arts and Sciences, an independent K-8 school, and the Christian Horizon High School.\n\nAttractions\n\n[edit]\n\nBrowns Ferry Park\n\nBridgeport Village\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Times, a weekly newspaper owned and operated by Portland-based Pamplin Media Group[22]\n\nTualatin Life,[23] a monthly newspaper focused exclusively on local news, history and human interest stories\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nMike Barrett (born 1968) – sportscaster\n\nJordan Chiles (born 2001) – artistic gymnast and Olympian\n\nRichard Devlin (born 1952) – politician\n\nIan Fuller (born 1979) – professional soccer player and assistant manager\n\nBret Harrison (born 1982) – actor and musician\n\nTaylor Hart (born 1991) – National Football League (NFL) player\n\nWyatt Houston (born 1994) – NFL player\n\nRoger Levasa (born 1959) – United States Football League player\n\nPayton Pritchard (born 1998) – National Basketball Association (NBA) player\n\nLuke Staley (born 1980) – NFL player\n\nKaty Steding (born 1967) – Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) player and women's college basketball coach\n\nJarad van Schaik (born 1988) – professional soccer player\n\nCourtney Verloo (born 1991) – professional soccer player\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nOregon portal\n\nPacific Northwest portal\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
