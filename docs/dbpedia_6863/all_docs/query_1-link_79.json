        "text": "GREATNESS IS CALLING\n\nWhatever future you may choose, you’ll get the best possible start ­at Cathedral. And it begins the moment you arrive.\n\nCathedral embodies Catholic values to help you achieve your personal best through a diverse and supportive social environment, a robust curriculum of academic, athletics and arts, and opportunities for emotional and spiritual development in and out of the classroom. ​\n\nYou'll learn to support others and recognize your place as part of the larger community. And, like every Cathedral student, you'll graduate and be accepted to a four-year college or university.\n\nStudents come to Cathedral from more than 150 different schools, from all neighborhoods throughout Central Indiana, and from Catholic and non-Catholic backgrounds. Students of color make up nearly a third of our student body.\n\nWe believe every student is capable of greatness, and we’re here to help you find your calling."
