The course's targeted audience includes students intending to become management consultants, entrepreneurs, product managers, brand managers, line managers, and non-profit managers.\n\nThe course uses accounting data to implement concepts from economics, operations, finance, strategy, and marketing. The overarching course framework is based on the concept of opportunity costs. Topics covered include breakeven analysis, keep versus replace decisions, inventory accounting, overhead allocation, activity-based costing, the opportunity cost of excess capacity, and transfer pricing.\n\nFINANCIAL REPORTING AND STATEMENT ANALYSIS (FRSA)\n\nProfessor Thomas Porter\n\nA firm’s financial statements are often the only source of information available to outside stakeholders. This course teaches you how to understand and use financial statements to learn about a firm, its current operations, its value drivers, and expected future performance. We will develop the following competencies: understanding a firm’s underlying economics and its value drivers, understanding the accounting nuances used to summarize a firm’s transactions, projecting a firm’s future performance in the form of well-articulated pro-forma financial statements, and estimating firm value. This course will enhance your overall financial literacy by integrating much of the material covered at Tuck, particularly in accounting, finance, economics and strategy.\n\nFINANCIAL REPORTING FOR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS (FRCFO)\n\nProfessor Jordan M. Schoenfeld\n\nA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) typically oversees corporate financial reporting, manages an investor relations team, and influences decisions regarding corporate finance and strategy. Most students will at some point interface with, or assume the duties of, a CFO or someone in a related role such as a financial controller. It is therefore crucial to have an informed perspective on what these individuals do. This course is designed with this objective in mind and emphasizes: (1) communicating past, current, and expectations of future financial performance to investors, and (2) the CFO’s role in corporate finance and operational decisions, with particular attention paid to the financial reporting implications of these decisions. Adopting a framework from information economics, we conceptualize the CFO as someone whose role is to mitigate agency problems arising from information asymmetries between managers and investors. The course builds on the tools developed in the accounting and finance core, namely the ability to analyze financial statements and valuation models. The course does not focus on journal entries. Each class session devotes time to concepts, computation, academic research, and discussion. The course is meant for students with broad interests, and the course material draws heavily from recent real-world events and takes the perspective of a manager running a firm.\n\nMANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING (MA)\n\nProfessor Richard Sansing\n\nThis course provides a comprehensive, graduate level exploration of managerial accounting. The course focuses on the use of accounting data in the management of an organization. Naturally, what accounting data are interesting and how they might be used depend on what the manager is seeking to accomplish and what other information is available. This course uses the concepts of opportunity cost and organizational architecture as a framework for the study of managerial accounting. Opportunity cost is the conceptual foundation underlying decision-making; organizational architecture is the conceptual foundation underlying the use of accounting as part of the firm’s control system. We examine these issues using both a textbook and case discussions.\n\nTAXES AND BUSINESS STRATEGY (TBS)\n\nProfessor Leslie A. Robinson\n\nThis course has two objectives: First, you will gain exposure to key areas where taxes play a role in implementing business strategy. Business strategy broadly refers to a firm’s working plan for achieving its vision, prioritizing objectives, competing successfully, and optimizing financial performance. Taxes affect many strategic business decisions such as forming a new business and raising capital, investment strategies, financing projects, compensating employees, making shareholder distributions, expanding through acquisition, divesting lines of business, or expanding internationally. There are trade-offs in meeting organizational objectives at the lowest tax cost. Second, this course will introduce you to a framework for thinking about tax strategy. A tax code is a living set of regulations that are constantly changing and adapting in response to politics, perceived abuse, and business innovation. It is precisely this ebb and flow that creates both challenges and opportunities in the world of business. The details of tax law are quite nuanced (and will often require advice from a tax lawyer), but there is a thematic approach to effective tax planning that can guide decision-making even as specific laws and governments change.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nCommunication\n\nADVANCED MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION (AMC)\n\nProfessor Amy E. Florentino T10; Professor Julie B. Lang T'93; Professor Courtney H. Pierson T'01\n\nAs part of the Core at Tuck, Management Communication (ManComm) was designed to provide Tuck students with immediately applicable skills for professional communication. For students seeking to deepen their communication skills, Advanced Management Communication (AMC) expands beyond ManComm, shifting from a passive audience to an active one. In this minicourse, we’ll ask you to not only anticipate audience needs, but to actively manage questions from them. You’ll practice leading a dynamic discussion to reach a common set of objectives: soliciting audience input, asking for and answering questions and managing dissent. Similar to ManComm, we’ll follow the same prepare – present – reflect pedagogy and in-class time will be dedicated to presentations and feedback.\n\nOur learning environment will be in-person, although we will incorporate remote discussions into the term. Overall, best practices for giving in-person presentations hold in a remote world. The skills you practice in this class will help you navigate a variety of work situations.\n\nPost-Tuck, you’ll regularly be engaged in discussions rather than pure presentations. AMC is designed to give you more agility in working with each unique situation you face.\n\nCOMMUNICATING WITH PRESENCE (CWP)\n\nProfessor James G. Rice\n\nTheater is heightened communication. Since the beginning of human culture, theater as an art form has been a crucial element in intellectual, emotional, and spiritual cultures worldwide. Theater communicates great ideas and inspires action. The actor is the instrument through which the message of the play is communicated. Therefore, it is the actor’s communication skills—developed through arduous training in use of the voice, body and expressive language—that determine whether the message of the play actually reaches and affects the audience. The task of the actor is to be present, and with that unique ability, to capture the heart, mind, ears and eyes of the audience through galvanizing communication. The leader whose responsibility it is to persuade, inspire and motivate must possess similar abilities. The difference between the two pursuits is that actors dedicate themselves to the acquisition of those skills; leaders all too often do not have that opportunity. This minicourse will be an active examination of what it is that comprises “presence” in communication. It will utilize a practice of certain actor-skills and behaviors to facilitate an ability to walk on the “stage” of everyday academic or business life with a strong communication capacity that projects energy, confidence, clarity of thought, and physical and vocal expressiveness. Each session will build on a progression of physical and vocal techniques incorporated in weekly spoken exercises intended to establish and reinforce the qualities of the leader as an energetic, active communicator.\n\nCORPORATE COMMUNICATION (CC)\n\nProfessor Paul A. Argenti\n\nThis minicourse focuses on the changing environment for business and using corporate communication to execute strategy. Building on the first-year curriculum, it covers, in greater detail, the changing environment for business, media relations, financial communications, corporate advertising, reputation management, social media and crisis communication. Students also work on further developing their communications skills through case analyses, experiential exercises, and presentations.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nEconomics\n\nCOOPERATION AND COMPETITION IN THE 21ST CENTURY GLOBAL ECONOMY (CCCGE)\n\nProfessor Emily Blanchard\n\nThe 21st-century global economy will be defined by how government and business leaders respond to today’s complex policy challenges. This mini-course centers on a handful of critical economic policy issues, organized around the central theme of cooperation and competition. Topics include the rise of global value chains, national security, and the innovation race; rising market power and international data security; the deterioration of global governance rules and norms; and the challenges of sustainable and inclusive globalization, including the coming battles over carbon taxes. The course will leverage economic tools and data to inform and refine our understanding of market outcomes, market failures, and the scope for policy. These economic principles will be balanced with an emphasis on the interplay between firms, governments, and international institutions and agreements in practice.\n\nCOUNTRIES AND COMPANIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY (CACIE)\n\nProfessor Andrew B. Bernard\n\nThis minicourse focuses on the interaction between countries and firms in the arenas of international trade, investment, and finance by applying and extending the tools acquired in the Global Economics for Managers core course. The ultimate objective is to help you and your organization make decisions in today’s global economy. Two broad themes recur throughout the term. One emphasizes the analysis of decision-making at the country level with emphasis on the constraints implied for individual enterprises. We visit a number of countries around the world that are at various stages of economic and market development and thus that face issues of monetary union, currency crisis, trade liberalization, and economic integration. In each case we consider how these events provide opportunities and constraints for companies. The second main theme of the course concentrates on the decisions faced by companies themselves as they participate in the international economy. Across a range of countries we look at issues surrounding production location, market entry, cross-border pricing, exchange-rate risk, hedging, and integrating the supply chain.\n\nENERGY ECONOMICS (EECON)\n\nProfessor Erin T. Mansur\n\nThis course explores a managerial perspective on the economics of energy markets, including crude oil, refined products, natural gas, and electricity. The class will study drivers of supply and demand, imperfect competition, economic regulation, environmental regulation, and various other public policy issues. Students will compete in competitive strategy games by making decisions for countries in OPEC and for firms in the California electricity market.\n\nFINANCING THE CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY(FCEE)\n\nProfessor Curtis Probst\n\nThis minicourse focuses on the finance aspects of the clean energy economy. The course examines renewable energy generation—as mass electrification using cleaner generation sources is necessary to sustain our energy-dependent lives and economies—as well as energy efficiency. In each case, and throughout the course, finance will be analyzed as a barrier to, or enabler of, greater adoption of clean energy. Specific learning objectives include:\n\nDescribe the key investment flows in the clean energy economy\n\nEvaluate some of the business models and financial techniques for bringing clean energy to markets\n\nCreate basic financial models for analyzing clean energy opportunities and apply them to investment decision making\n\nIdentify some of the key opportunities and challenges faced in transitioning to clean energy\n\nUnderstand finance mechanisms that can be used to support the development and deployment of clean energy\n\nGROWTH ECONOMICS (GE)\n\nProfessor Davin Chor\n\nIn this elective course, we study the phenomenon of economic growth. In the past half-century, the world has witnessed remarkable shifts in the economic fortunes (and misfortunes) of countries. While Western Europe and North America have maintained high standards of living, their pace of growth has slowed and even stalled. On the other hand, we have witnessed the growth miracles of the East Asian tigers and the rise to prominence of the BRICS emerging economies. Even still, many developing countries remain seemingly stuck at low levels of income per capita.\n\nWe will take a deep dive in this class to explore the fundamental drivers of countries’ growth performance over the medium- to long term. A solid understanding of these drivers of growth is invaluable. For policy makers and the consultants they hire, this will inform the recommendations that they make over strategies to promote growth. For the managers of firms, a keen appreciation of these forces can be vital for identifying opportunities and navigating business decisions.\n\nThe course will adopt a two-pronged approach. On one level, we will pursue the economic theories that seek to explain differences in growth outcomes across countries, and explore the empirical evidence marshaled for or against these theories. At the same time, we will ground our discussion in the real world through selected country case studies. These will draw out the relevance of the theories and speak to their more practical implications.\n\nLEADERSHIP IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY: CONTEMPORARY ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS (LGE)\n\nDean Matthew J. Slaughter\n\nHere in 2024, the global economy continues to find its way amidst the lingering harms of the pandemic, the hopes of new technologies like generative artificial intelligence, and the uncertainties about where new leaders with new visions will come from to help turn myriad worldwide challenges into opportunities.\n\nThe pandemic arrived at a time where the fusion of digital, global, and social forces continues to create immense business and economic opportunities—and yet serious pressures and anxieties as well. Perhaps most prominent among these anxieties is the fading belief among many people in many countries in the dynamic forces of globalization and innovation. Much of this ambivalence and related anxiety stems from workers and their families not seeing sufficient growth in their income, wealth, and sense of opportunity: sufficient relative to earlier decades, relative to those at the top, and relative to their hopes and expectations. We live in a time where many nations are fractious and less trusting, with far less consensus about the proper balance among for-profit businesses, sovereign governments, and civil society.\n\nSeveral business-policy questions await the rest of 2024 and beyond. Will central banks manage to continue reducing inflation without triggering recession or financial crises? Will fiscal authorities create additional supports for workers, families, and communities? How will generative AI evolve in companies—and how will governments respond to all this? Will the U.S.-China trade war and broader disagreements over issues such as technological superiority deteriorate further or improve? What sort of fresh policies might be pursued in the emerging markets across Africa, Asia, and Latin America? What about the grinding evolution of global warming and climate change? Nearly half the world’s population will participate in national elections by the end of this year: will newly elected leaders craft new leadership stories that bring the potentially vast gains of globalization and innovation to more workers, communities, and families?\n\nLGE provides us a chance to engage with all these contemporary business and policy issues that are top of mind around the world in C-suites, boardrooms, and halls of government power—for aspiring unicorns and for generations-old companies alike.\n\nUNDERSTANDING CHINA'S ECONOMY\n\nProfessor Bingjing Li\n\nThis minicourse examines how China has grown into the second largest economy in the world, and the challenges and opportunities along the way. It delineates the complexity of contemporary China with respect to economic, technological, political, environmental, and social issues and how it influences corporations in a wide range of industries. Based on in-depth discussions of empirical studies and business cases, it aims to provide students with analytical frameworks to navigate the China business environment and address the challenges and threats.\n\nTopics include the roles of government and state-owned enterprises in the economy system and the implications for multinational corporations and entrepreneurial firms, the liberalization of the factor and output markets, the driving forces and the consequences of China’s technology advancement, the environmental degradation and unprecedented regulatory changes in recent years, the protection of intellectual property rights, culture factors embedded in business practices, and China-US economic tension.\n\nRESEARCH TO PRACTICE SEMINAR: GLOBAL STRUCTURE AND CONDUCT OF FIRMS (RTPGS)\n\nProfessor Teresa C. Fort\n\nFirms operate in a global market. The rise of multinational production, the greater ease of transmitting knowledge, and the growing importance of global value chains have all contributed to deeper economic integration across countries. Recent events, such as the US trade wars and the COVID-19 pandemic, threaten this globalization. In this RTP, we will study how firms have contributed and responded to increased globalization, and how they may adapt to current and future challenges to it. We will use an economic framework to guide managerial decisions on where to locate production, whether to outsource or integrate fragmented production, and when to adopt new technologies. We will also analyze how firm-level responses to globalization affect industry and country-level outcomes, such as employment, wages, productivity, and innovation. The focus will be on recent empirical approaches and evidence so that students can: a) evaluate an empirical analysis and its credibility, and b) develop a data-driven approach to making managerial decisions.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nDIVERSITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP COLLABORATION PRACTICUM (PRDEC)\n\nProfessor Daniella Reichstetter; Caroline Cannon\n\nThis practicum allows Tuck students to deeply understand the intersection of diversity, entrepreneurship, and company growth. This practicum partners with Tuck’s Executive Education’s 40-year-old program for diverse entrepreneurs. Students will:\n\nBe matched with a diverse entrepreneur from Exec Ed to work on a discrete business challenge or opportunity (group work).\n\nParticipate in weekly class discussions with the following objectives:\n\nTo engage in conversation around the assigned readings with the following learning goals:\n\nTo understand the complexity, complications, and hurdles specific to being a diverse entrepreneur.\n\nTo learn about the levers that can be pulled to address the aforementioned.\n\nTo understand how said levers can be applied for action-based outcomes with tangible impact.\n\nTo apply the learnings from the readings and class discussions to the matched entrepreneurs and articulate recommendations to address their business challenge/opportunity.\n\nTo build understanding and empathy for people with different backgrounds, needs, experiences, and approaches, particularly as they relate to conducting business.\n\nENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE (ENTFN)\n\nProfessor Morten Sorensen\n\nThis course is about the corporate finance of private companies, starting out with a focus on the financing issues and decisions that arise in an entrepreneurial context. We first cover the three fundamental topics in entrepreneurial finance: (1) start-up valuation, (2) deal terms and term sheets, and (3) staged investing, growth options, and potential scale of ventures. We then apply those tools to questions about how to structure an investment in a start-up and determine an appropriate valuation, how much capital to raise and from whom, the mechanics of term sheets and capitalization tables, economics of milestones, subsequent financing rounds and exits. Finally, as time permits, we may also cover more advanced topics in the corporate finance of private companies, such as exits through SPACs, regulatory issues, structure of levered buyouts, and the organization of venture capital, private equity, and private debt funds and firms. The course is taught through a combination of lectures and case studies.\n\nENTREPRENEURIAL THINKING (ETHNK)\n\nProfessor Daniella Reichstetter T'07; Professor Trip Davis D'90\n\nThis full-term mini course is an introduction to entrepreneurship and “entrepreneurial thinking.” Taught by two experienced entrepreneurs, this course exposes students to methodologies and practitioners and allows for the development of personal perspectives about starting a company now or in the future, joining an entrepreneurial venture, and/or exploring career options in fields related to entrepreneurship, such as early-stage investing. The course introduces the concepts of Hypothesis-Driven Entrepreneurship, Customer Discovery, Design Thinking, and Lean Startup Methodology. The Lean Startup Methodology will be applied to 1. existing early- and growth-stage companies (often as part of a live discussion with the founder) and 2. a new venture idea created by student teams. The course prepares students to launch their own startup, qualify for an entrepreneurial First-Year Project (eFYP), and apply to the Tuck Venture Learning Lab in their second year.\n\nEntrepreneurship Through Acquisition (ETA)\n\nProfessor Mark Anderegg\n\nEntrepreneurship Through Acquisition (“ETA”) is an increasingly popular career path to general management via small business ownership. The discipline is distinct from customary interpretations of entrepreneurship insofar as the company is not started from the ground up. Rather, in ETA the entrepreneur purchases a business as a going concern – typically at a stage in its evolution when consistent positive cash flow is already being generated – and assumes the CEO role immediately after the acquisition is consummated. The most common manifestation of ETA is a search fund, although many variants of that model are becoming similarly prominent.\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the various pathways to ETA, as well as a detailed exploration of the various phases of an entrepreneur’s journey. The first half of the course covers background about different ETA models, raising investor capital, conducting a search for a suitable company and closing a private equity buyout transaction. The second half addresses relevant topics pertinent to being a first-time CEO and considerations related to operating a microcap company. Industry participants will join the majority of sessions to bolster the content and add unique personal perspective to the discussion. Background reading will often include case studies wherein these practitioners are the case protagonists.\n\nSOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP (SESHP)\n\nProfessor Mark DesJardine\n\nDespite a growing desire to pursue prosocial goals and affect positive change in the world, many entrepreneurs have little understanding of how to develop new ventures that can simultaneously generate positive financial and social returns. Without the ability to measure, manage, and scale social impact, ventures that start out with prosocial aims will often diverge from their roots, with founders drifting away from social impact aims or pursuing goals that fail to deliver on their intended impacts.\n\nThis course takes a hands-on approach to addressing these issues. Students will work in teams to identify an opportunity and develop a plan for a new venture that can generate positive financial and social returns. Emphasis is placed on understanding the unique challenges of creating social impact business models and defining the value proposition of these models for investors and other stakeholders.\n\nStudents will leave the class with a deeper appreciation of the potential for business to be a force for good in the world. The class will be of value to students who are interested in creating socially impactful businesses, as well as to those who want to work in the business ecosystem that supports such ventures, including impact investing and consulting.\n\nSTARTUP STRATEGIZING (START)\n\nProfessor Hart Posen\n\nEntrepreneurship is economically vital and personally fulfilling — but success is elusive. Why? This course focuses on one explanation — success is not just the outcome of finding a great opportunity but also what you do with it. The startup’s strategy is the answer, as a growing research literature has documented. While developing a good business plan and pitch deck are important, as are practices such as experimentation and pivoting, they complement, not substitute, a well-founded strategy. Startup Strategizing will help you develop superior strategies for the ventures you found or join, and evaluate the strategies of startups you might invest in. Building on your work in the Strategy core course and complementing related electives (e.g., Ecosystems Design, Design Thinking, Social Enterprise, Entrepreneurial Thinking), we will develop a deep understanding of the core strategic choices facing entrepreneurs and a conceptual framework for how to address them.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nEthics and Social Responsibility\n\nBUSINESS AND CLIMATE CHANGE (BCC)\n\nProfessor Anant Sundaram\n\nClimate change and its impacts raise momentous concerns. Hundreds of companies worldwide are aggressively getting in front of it, since they are the constituency with the strongest links to climate change: companies are the major source of greenhouse gas emissions and equally, by deploying R&D, financial resources, technology, and talent, they are the ones developing the solutions to address the problem. There is an emerging, multi-trillion dollar ‘climate economy’ that will mitigate and help us adapt to climate change. The main questions we will ask and address in ‘Business and Climate Change’ are: (1) What is climate change, and why should you as an MBA, and the company you work for, care? (2) What does the climate economy mean for your career, your firm, your industry? (3) How do companies measure and manage emissions? (4) What are the tools and frameworks to understand regulatory responses (e.g., a carbon tax or cap-and-trade), and to assess how a company’s business model is exposed to climate change? (5) What do you need to know about the global policy-making process and how it will impact your firm?\n\nBUSINESS AND ETHICS AT THE BASE OF THE PYRAMID (BOP)\n\nProfessor Susan M. Hanson\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, characterized by both unprecedented affluence and far-reaching crises, markets are a dynamic intersection where social mission and profit incentives may converge. Business leaders, with aims to overcome the challenges of access to serve un-tapped markets, may find themselves sharing ground with development advocates, social entrepreneurs, and social activists who seek to harness the power of markets to spur progress.\n\nDriven by the promise of new markets and the imperatives of corporate responsibility, this mini-course explores the relationship between profit generation and poverty alleviation, with an eye to ethical challenges and social risk.\n\nAligned with the ESR (Ethics and Social Responsibility) requirement, this mini-course asks students to use ethical decision making tools, to examine the challenges that may emerge for business leaders in their efforts to overcome barriers to essential resources such as healthcare, infrastructure services, basic nutrition, and environmental sustainability.\n\nThis course is designed to provide students with opportunities to refine their analytical skills on questions of ethics and corporate responsibility, and to practice their ethical voice. We begin the course by establishing a foundational understanding of Philosophical Ethics through core background readings, which serve as an indispensable resource throughout the course to understand and navigate the value-laden stakeholder debates that frame market competition. Case readings focus on the central challenge of access, and are drawn from both emerging market as well as mature industrial country contexts.\n\nThroughout the course, we explore the possibilities and limits of using markets to achieve dual aims of greater access and higher profits. Selected cases position the pursuit of profit in the context of stark disparities between haves and have-nots, prompting inquiries into corporate accountability, ethical considerations, and associated risks. An enduring theme throughout the course is the potential disruption of conventional assumptions regarding the roles and interplay of business, society, and government.\n\nBUSINESS AND SOCIETY (BAS)\n\nProfessor Curt Welling D'71, T'77\n\nGovernments and societies around the world are increasingly focused on intractable social issues: problems of poverty, health, education, the environment and social justice. There is an accelerating demand for sustainability. In this context, expectations for business accountability are rising, and the social contract between business and government is under scrutiny and in some cases under attack in markets and countries around the world. The very nature and purpose of “capitalism” are being questioned. At the same time, new technologies and new models of collaboration between business, government and civil society are emerging. And new perspectives about investing and raising “social purpose capital” are being tested. Business “stakeholders”—communities, employees, governments and “civil society”—are increasingly demanding a role in corporate governance and accountability. And now we are in the Age of Covid 19: the immediate and longer term realities of the pandemic will challenge all of our assumptions, expectations and models about the “social contract\".\n\nThrough a series of readings, cases and speakers, this introductory minicourse is designed to give students an integrated perspective on the unique roles which government and business play in society, the sources of authority for, and limits to, those responsibilities, and the ways in which the traditional roles and organizational models are being challenged, questioned and changed.\n\nThe course will also explore the role that capital markets play in this context: sustainability is impossible without mobilizing capital. The course will examine markets from a number of perspectives: as facilitator of social policy, as allocator of capital and instrument of organizational accountability, as manifestations of social priorities and as mechanisms for reflecting moral and ethical priorities.\n\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY (CRSP)\n\nProfessor Paul A. Argenti\n\nThis minicourse starts with the premise that corporate social responsibility is good for business and focuses on how leaders can balance the needs of their organizations with responsibilities to key constituencies. Through cases focusing on the social, reputational, and environmental consequences of corporate activities, students will learn how to make difficult choices, promote responsible behavior within their organizations, and understand the role personal values play in developing effective leadership skills.\n\nImpact Investing: Capital for Social Impact (IICSI)\n\nProfessor Curt Welling D'71, T'77\n\nThe concepts of “impact investing” and “social impact capital” have exploded on the marketplace in recent years. The last decade has seen the dramatic acceleration of attempts to find new ways to harness capital and capitalism in the search for solutions to intractable social problems and concerns about corporate accountability. New organizational paradigms and new investment perspectives have emerged, and the volume of capital seeking social impact has grown exponentially.\n\nA critical component of this dynamic has been the exploration of new approaches to creating, allocating and evaluating investment capital. Whether in new approaches to philanthropy (Venture Philanthropy), corporate philanthropy (Corporate Cause Marketing), venture capital (Social Entrepreneurship), shared-value capital (double bottom line investing), private and public market values-based investing (Impact Investing and public market ESG investing)--virtually every major aggregator of investment capital—Black Rock, Vanguard, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs, etc) has allocated significant resources to developing investment products or financing approaches which respond to these trends.\n\nThrough a series of readings, lectures, and speakers this course will examine the sources, markets, costs, risk and return tradeoffs, and accountability mechanisms in the emerging markets for Social Impact Capital.\n\nLEADING DIVERSE ORGANIZATIONS (LDO)\n\nProfessor Sonya Mishra\n\nUsing insights from cutting-edge behavioral and psychological research, this course provides students with skills to identify and address issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within organizations. Students will develop an understanding of the barriers to DEI, such as systems of inequality, denial of privilege, biases that hinder support for DEI, and the many biases facing marginalized groups. Through lectures, in-class role-play exercises, and case discussions, students will also learn about how organizational characteristics (e.g., power hierarchies, social networks, work culture) impact the efficacy of DEI interventions. Finally, students will learn how to improve organizational DEI at the individual level (e.g., addressing bias, allyship, empathetic leadership, psychological safety) and at the organizational level (e.g., hiring practices and workplace policies that measurably improve DEI). By the end of this course, students will be adept at identifying and addressing sources of inequity, having difficult conversations, mitigating problems associated with stereotypes, and managing diverse, equitable, and inclusive environments. Importantly, this class teaches students how to advocate for DEI issues in organizational settings, equipping them with the necessary research, persuasion tactics, and analytical skills needed to be advocates, even in the face of resistance.\n\nMANAGING FOR SOCIAL IMPACT (MSI)\n\nProfessor Bob Searle T'96\n\nTwenty years ago, few people except social scientists evaluating the results of large-scale development programs talked about social impact. Google the term now, and millions of hits pop up—an explosion of interest that is both promising and problematic.\n\nOn the one hand, its currency attests to the growing number of organizations and individuals who recognize—and want to help remedy—the enormous social, economic, and environmental problems facing our planet. On the other hand, it’s hard to know what the term actually means other than doing something good for society.\n\nIf social impact were simply a buzzword this sort of broad generalization wouldn’t matter. But social impact is a real phenomenon. And while there are undoubtedly people who’ve seized on the term simply because it’s the new-new thing, most of those who are talking about it do so with genuinely good intentions. The problem, in the words of inventor Thomas A. Edison, is that “a good intention, with a bad approach, often leads to poor results.”\n\nMSI’s overarching goal is to help you appreciate what it takes to turn good intentions into good results for society. To this end, the class will require you to consider a number of fundamental questions, including:\n\nWhat is social impact?\n\nWho defines it?\n\nWhat role do various sectors – private, public, nonprofit – play in delivering social impact?\n\nWhat are the challenges and tradeoffs of managing for it?\n\nHow can it be measured and assessed?\n\nWhat behaviors promote impact, and which subvert it?\n\nWhat are the implications for how I/my organization operate in the world?\n\nThese questions are particularly pointed for the charitable nonprofits, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and philanthropic foundations that constitute the nonprofit (or social) sector. Why? Because these are the only organizations that exist solely for the purpose of bettering society. If they are unable to deliver on the statement of purpose (or mission) that is their reason for being, it doesn’t matter how big, or well-known, or well-intentioned they are: they have failed. So, using them as a primary lens for discussing these questions allows us to explore the challenges of managing for social impact in their most demanding form.\n\nThat said, every organization has a social impact (as does every individual), even if its decision makers choose not to acknowledge that, let alone manage for it. This is why we will also use our time together to consider where questions of social impact might appear in the context of business decisions or government policies, and what some of the key trade-offs in these contexts might involve. You will also have time and space to develop your own perspective on social impact and to reflect on how it might affect your decisions and choices going forward. Guests who have wrestled with these issues themselves will share their experiences and lessons learned, as will your professor.\n\nAs MBAs. your skills will be in high demand. MSI will be useful whether you decide to apply them professionally or privately. This course will be particularly relevant if you are currently serving on the board of a nonprofit or NGO or plan on joining one hereafter.\n\nMORAL REASONING: FROM SOPHOCLES TO MACHIAVELLI TO THE BOMB (MORE)\n\nJoshua S. Lewis\n\nHow did President Harry Truman decide to use atomic weapons in 1945? How did Katherine Graham, Publisher of the Washington Post, consider the ethical dilemmas and business risks involved in publishing the Pentagon Papers and pursuing Watergate? Is Machiavelli’s treatise The Prince a pragmatic handbook every leader should read or a rationalization of thuggery?\n\nLeaders regularly confront dilemmas with moral dimensions. They can arise urgently and unexpectedly, are generally complex, and can be career defining. This course in applied ethics is both abstract, in that it explores complex moral questions and the philosophical frameworks used to address them, and intensely practical, in that it deals with the types of moral challenges that business leaders face and introduces the tools required to lead an organization through them. Its ultimate objective is to enable students to better navigate the business world, and life as it is actually lived.\n\nCourse content includes renowned fiction, autobiography, moral philosophy, documentary film, and journalistic and historical narrative, with a diverse set of protagonists spanning centuries, cultures, and continents.\n\nProfessor Lewis notes: “Over a 30+ year career in venture capital and private equity I encountered any number of ethical dilemmas, several complex and relatively consequential. And although my training in moral philosophy was useful in equipping me with skills in abstract reasoning, I wish I’d taken a course in applied ethics like this one. Success in business requires a command of hard skills – strategy, finance, management, operations. That said, in retrospect, it was the difficult moral calls that I remember most clearly – and, regardless of how well or poorly I now believe I prosecuted those decisions, they were crucial turning points in my evolution as a professional.”\n\nRESEARCH TO PRACTICE: AI-DRIVEN ANALYTICS AND SOCIETY (RTPAS)\n\nProfessor James Siderius\n\nThe last decade has brought us tremendous advances in the power and sophistication of data- driven decision-making techniques at our disposal. Encouraged by this progress, we are witnessing a broad deployment of these techniques across the world. They now touch on and sometimes even govern just about every aspect of how businesses, and even people, operate on a day-to-day basis.\n\nHowever, as much as these techniques were deployed with the promise of bringing a decisively positive change, it has become abundantly clear that they often are a mixed blessing, at best. Indeed, it turns out that the interface of algorithmic decision-making and society is rife with subtle and non-obvious interactions, undesirable feedback loops, and unintended consequences. How should we make sense of and navigate these issues?\n\nThe goal of this seminar is to survey some of the key challenges emerging in the context of the societal impact of data-driven decision making, as well as to create a forum where the students can discuss potential approaches to addressing these challenges. We will aim to discuss questions such as: How should businesses responsibility use, interpret, and make decisions from the output of machine learning models? How can we ensure big data sets are unbiased, fairly labeled, and being used responsibly by companies? What challenges will we face as businesses shift toward using generative AI and large language models for operations such as online customer service? Why does fake news spread faster than truthful news on online platforms like social media, and how do we combat it? Will automation replace unskilled labor, or simply make workers more productive?\n\nIntense student involvement in both the presentation and the class discussion of the scientific papers is required. Like all RTP seminars, there will be a focus on using academic research to help you learn the analytical rigor to be an effective manager in an increasingly complex world.\n\nRESEARCH TO PRACTICE: EQUITY ANALYTICS IN ORGANIZATIONS (RTPEA)\n\nProfessor Julia Meilin\n\nTo have a competitive advantage in business, organizations need to leverage the full talents of an increasingly diverse population. Yet, many managers lack the analytical skills to identify whether their business practices create disparities in opportunity and/or outcomes for their workers. In this seminar, students will learn different ways to use data to identify and measure inequity in organizations that affect diversity goals, broadly defined, including but not limited to gender, race, social class, age, veteran status, parental status, and sexual orientation. Students will also learn methodological strategies for designing and testing solutions (e.g., longitudinal interventions, randomized field experiments) in real-world contexts (e.g., investment banking, high-tech, biotech, law firms). Course materials will include academic articles from management, sociology, social psychology, and economics to learn the analytical rigor required to make data-driven managerial decisions. The papers we read will leverage data to develop theory and offer empirical evidence to address questions such as:\n\nHow can managers use data to identify and measure social factors that lead to inequity in hiring, compensation, and performance evaluations?\n\nHow does work-family conflict negatively affect both men and women employees?\n\nHow can managers design and test interventions that reduce bias and drive positive organizational change for all employees?\n\nHow can employers assess if certain groups of workers are more (dis)advantaged by remote work? What types of interventions help remote workers maintain and develop “soft skills”?\n\nIn what ways might artificial intelligence be used to overcome hiring biases, rather than promote them?\n\nBy the end of this course, students will have learned analytical techniques to (a) identify inequity using data from various contexts (e.g., hiring evaluations, employee performance reviews, MBA starting salaries); (b) infer plausible causes of such inequities; and (c) design and test interventions to reduce observed inequities. Students will engage in active learning by co-leading class discussions of the papers each week and completing both a mid-term and final project that involve using real-world data to perform a detailed analysis of inequity.\n\nSOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP (SESHP)\n\nProfessor Mark R. DesJardine\n\nDespite a growing desire to pursue prosocial goals and affect positive change in the world, many entrepreneurs have little understanding of how to develop new ventures that can simultaneously generate positive financial and social returns. Without the ability to measure, manage, and scale social impact, ventures that start out with prosocial aims will often diverge from their roots, with founders drifting away from social impact aims or pursuing goals that fail to deliver on their intended impacts.\n\nThis course takes a hands-on approach to addressing these issues. Students will work in teams to identify an opportunity and develop a plan for a new venture that can generate positive financial and social returns. Emphasis is placed on understanding the unique challenges of creating social impact business models and defining the value proposition of these models for investors and other stakeholders.\n\nStudents will leave the class with a deeper appreciation of the potential for business to be a force for good in the world. The class will be of value to students who are interested in creating socially impactful businesses, as well as to those who want to work in the business ecosystem that supports such ventures, including impact investing and consulting.\n\nSUSTAINABLE MARKETING (SUSM)\n\nProfessor Liana L. Frey\n\nTo use Philip Kotler’s definition, “sustainable marketing holds that an organization should meet the needs of its present consumers without compromising the ability of future generations to fulfill their own needs.” To do this well, marketers need to expand their traditional scope and leverage new tools and frameworks. There has been a shift in consumer expectations around transparency and responsibility of a company’s environmental impact. Consumers are seeking out and buying more sustainable products. Consumer expectations are changing, and they now expect companies to not only be responsible for their environmental impact while making a product, but also in the sourcing, use, and disposal. Many companies have struggled to communicate on these topics because they are complex, which has led to marketing that is often inadvertently misleading. Marketers want to leverage this interest in sustainability, but they struggle with what, where, when to communicate during the customer journey.\n\nTo meet these challenges, we will explore several new tools and frameworks. Over the course of this class, we utilize system thinking to map out an industry and create a new product or service that makes a positive environmental impact. We identify stakeholders who are aligned to the same end goals so that a business can partner in non-traditional ways to accelerate and magnify sustainability progress. We will walk through how to create an emotional connection with a potential customer and how to conduct customer research so a company’s marketing resonates. We will update the 3C’s and 4P’s for sustainability. We’ll review circularity strategies and the evolution of circular systems. We’ll bring all these tools and concepts to life as we use several current cases- Impossible Foods, Nike, and Liquid Death- to discuss strategy in action and debrief on how these companies executed their marketing strategy around sustainability.\n\nWOMEN, GENDER AND LEADERSHIP IN THE NEW WORKPLACE (WGLNW)\n\nProfessor Stacy Blake-Beard\n\nOver the past decades, women have steadily moved into higher levels of management and leadership where they now occupy key positions in the public and private sectors and have established themselves as a force in most workplaces. However, there are still challenges that they are facing. The work place experiences of women are informed by societal expectations that are deeply ingrained in how we show up – gender norms. In this course, we will focus on how gender norms have impacted women’s careers, as well as the ways that gender norms affect work, leadership, and professional success in general. We will delve into issues that are commonly included in discussions on women, gender, and leadership (i.e. work-life balance, networking, and bias). We will expand to more recent dimensions of the new workplace (i.e. the influence of technology, the different career experiences of women across the globe). Through the course, we will have a forum to identify, at interpersonal and organizational levels, the challenges that women have faced—and the strategies they have utilized—on their career path. We will also diagnose gender and power dynamics in the workplace and evaluate alterative reactions/responses to enhance individual and group effectiveness. With each of the topics, you will be encouraged to think of your role as leaders and how you can use those competencies to create and/or contribute to workplaces that are sensitive to the importance of gender equity.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nFinance\n\nCORPORATE FINANCE AND SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM (CFSA)\n\nProfessor B. Espen Eckbo\n\nThis course, which targets corporate consultants as well as members of the financial industry, develops critical thinking about corporate financial decisions and governance. The course starts with research and practice in the areas of corporate governance, shareholder activism and executive compensation. It then continues with investment banking and the capital acquisition process, and it ends with capital structure choice and the resolution of financial distress. The readings contain a mix of academic articles and cases. Working in groups, students are responsible for several class presentations and a final term project. Moreover, in addition to debating core topics, students run their own regressions to verify some of the large-sample results discussed in class.\n\nRESEARCH TO PRACTICE SEMINAR: CORPORATE TAKEOVERS (RTPCT)\n\nProfessor B. Espen Eckbo\n\nWe discuss the results of large-scale empirical investigations into the economic effects of corporate takeovers. The literature address questions such as how firms are sold, who buys who and why, shareholder gains and their sources, bidding strategies and takeover premiums, merger arbitrage, and antitrust policy towards mergers. The course develops the basic empirical methodologies required to understand the course readings. Active student involvement in both the presentation and class discussion of the scientific papers is required.\n\nCORPORATE VALUATION (CV)\n\nProfessor Anant Sundaram\n\nThe goal of this course is to enable you to answer the question, \"what is a real asset worth\"? You will define, derive, and estimate cash flows, cost of capital, and continuing values to establish intrinsic values for projects, divisions, and firms domestically and across borders using well-known and widely-used valuation methods. In addition to discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, you will examine alternative approaches such as real options valuation and relative valuation. The course will explore valuation approaches in such career-relevant settings as mature cash flow businesses, IPOs of rapidly-growing businesses, subscription revenue-based business models, LBOs, mergers & acquisitions (M&A), and project financing. We will also explore the links between corporate valuation and corporate financial decisions regarding capital structure, corporate performance evaluation, exchange rates, and country risk. The course will use a mixture of lectures, cases, projects, and guest speakers.\n\nEARLY STAGE VENTURE CAPITAL WORKSHOP PRACTICUM (PRVCW)\n\nProfessor Jim Feuille\n\nThe goal of the Early Stage Venture Capital Workshop Practicum is to engage students in an in-depth, hands-on, team-oriented exploration of real-world early stage venture capital (VC) deal making, first by giving students an intensive grounding in the core elements of early stage venture capital—venture capital fund portfolio construction, deal sourcing, deal screening and selection, due diligence, valuation of early stage companies, convertible notes, capitalization tables, term sheets, the elements of an investment memorandum and negotiations with entrepreneurs—then by engaging students in a series of “deal workshops” whereby students will work on analyzing and conducting “due diligence” on nine “live” venture capital deals, three at a time, meeting with the founders or CEOs of companies that are then active in the marketplace raising Seed, Series A and Series B rounds of venture capital to hear their pitches and ask due diligence questions, and selecting three of those deals (one per set of three) to recommend to their “partnership”, consisting of practicing venture capitalists from around the US, by writing a full investment memorandum for each of the three deals and presenting and defending the investment thesis for the deal in a meeting with the venture capital partners. Unlike interns or associates in venture capital firms, who support the partners in their work, in this workshop, students will take on the role of the partners in a venture capital firm who are leading deals for their firms. In the final week, the deals phase of the workshop concludes with mock negotiation sessions where the teams will negotiate an investment term sheet with three of the nine entrepreneurs, one per team.\n\nENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE (ENTFN)\n\nProfessor Morten Sorensen\n\nThis course is about the corporate finance of private companies, starting out with a focus on the financing issues and decisions that arise in an entrepreneurial context. We first cover the three fundamental topics in entrepreneurial finance: (1) start-up valuation, (2) deal terms and term sheets, and (3) staged investing, growth options, and potential scale of ventures. We then apply those tools to questions about how to structure an investment in a start-up and determine an appropriate valuation, how much capital to raise and from whom, the mechanics of term sheets and capitalization tables, economics of milestones, subsequent financing rounds and exits. Finally, as time permits, we may also cover more advanced topics in the corporate finance of private companies, such as exits through SPACs, regulatory issues, structure of levered buyouts, and the organization of venture capital, private equity, and private debt funds and firms. The course is taught through a combination of lectures and case studies.\n\nESG INVESTMENT PRACTICUM (PRESG)\n\nProfessor Ramon Lecuona Torras; Professor William C. Martin\n\nThis practicum was developed to ‘formalize’ academic work around Tuck’s ESG Fund (TESGF). This is a co-curricular activity that provides students with a hands-on experience in managing and executing real world ESG-oriented investments, by exposing students to incorporating non-financial factors related to ESG into investment analysis. Student Directors of the fund are responsible for developing the Fund’s investment thesis, evaluating investment opportunities, presenting proposals to committee, executing investments, and actively managing the fund’s existing portfolio.\n\nFIELD STUDIES IN VENTURE CAPITAL (FSVC)\n\nProfessor Philip J. Ferneau D'84, T'96\n\nThis course is designed to provide a practitioner’s perspective on the challenges and opportunities of venture investing in private, entrepreneurial companies (or entrepreneurs seeking such investment). While there is no substitute for hands-on investing experience, the course is designed to introduce you to venture capital best-practice frameworks and the challenges of applying them using real world examples. The first portion of the course will focus on evaluating and structuring early-stage investments, using a combination of case discussion, classroom exercises, and “live” deals. The remainder of the course will feature guest speakers, case discussions and readings that expose students to venture capital practitioners and the practical challenges they encounter, including post-investment. Throughout the term, the course will emphasize active discussion and experiential learning. Note that the readings and situations discussed in class will focus on venture capital investing, but many of the concepts covered are also generally relevant to private equity investing in private companies.\n\nFINANCIAL REPORTING AND STATEMENT ANALYSIS (FRSA)\n\nProfessor Phil Stocken\n\nFinancial Reporting and Statement Analysis (FRSA) is designed to prepare you to analyze, interpret and use financial statements effectively, both from a general manager and investor perspective. The primary focus will be on developing your ability to engage in accounting analysis, which is the process of assessing how the financial metrics reflect the firm’s underlying economic constructs, as well as your ability to use financial data to gain insight into a firm’s business strategy, economic performance, and outlook.\n\nFINTECH\n\nProfessor Juhani Linnainmaa\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide an overview of various technological advances that have emerged in the financial services industry. We discuss technologies aimed at creating new and better ways of saving, borrowing, investing, and transacting. The specific technologies we focus relate to crypto (including blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and tokens), household lending market, real estate market, and robo-advising. We also give an overview of some machine learning techniques and principles as they relate to, e.g., the lending market and investment industry.\n\nHOUSING (HOUSE)\n\nProfessor Brian Mezler\n\nHouseholds allocate nearly one-quarter of their assets to owner-occupied housing and spend more on housing services than on any other expenditure category. Over the last decade, housing transactions have been the focus of many innovative firms that use technology to transform old ways of doing business. This course examines the housing market from occupants’, investors’, entrepreneurs’ and policymakers’ perspectives. The course is divided into four modules. The first module explores the economics of owning vs. renting, asset valuation and supply-demand dynamics. The second module focuses on the housing search process, with a particular emphasis on fintech innovations that disintermediate real estate brokerage. The third module delves into home financing decisions. The fourth and final module studies investments in rental housing, including vacation and other short-term rentals facilitated by person-to-person rental platforms.\n\nINVESTING IN EARLY STAGE SOCIAL VENTURES (PRTSV)\n\nProfessor Curt Welling D'71, T'77, Professor Ramon Lecuona\n\nThis practicum provides students with technical and applied knowledge to assess the potential of early-stage ventures with social impact. More specifically, this practicum helps students:\n\nUnderstand the complexities and tradeoffs faced by ventures that pursue a ‘double bottom-line’: economic profits and social impact.\n\nUnderstand the complexity of defining and measuring intentional social impact.\n\nUnderstand the motives of different stakeholders around social ventures, such as investors and entrepreneurs.\n\nManage complex relationships and communication demands with such stakeholders.\n\nINVESTMENTS (INV)\n\nProfessor Juhani Linnainmaa\n\nThe goal of this course is to help students develop a framework for thinking about investment problems. The course examines financial theory and empirical evidence that is useful when making both professional (e.g., mutual funds and hedge funds) and personal investment decisions. The topics covered include portfolio theory, performance evaluation, analysis of trading strategies, and the role of taxes in investment decisions.\n\nRESEARCH TO PRACTICE: Empirical Evidence in Finance: Asset Pricing and Factor Investing (RTPEF)\n\nProfessor Kenneth French\n\nFinance is fundamentally about moving resources through time. Because the future value of the resources is rarely known, uncertainty is central to most financial decisions. Fortunately, most finance problems are quantifiable and we usually have access to much relevant data, so there are many opportunities for intelligent data analysis. Unfortunately, there seem to be even more opportunities for bad data analysis.\n\nAcademics have been analyzing large collections of financial data since at least the early 1960s. The modern fields of asset pricing and corporate finance are based on the results of that work. Researchers who study the ever-expanding databases available today continue to improve our understanding of financial markets and corporate behavior. The papers they produce provide a great opportunity for us to study data analysis and statistical inference – and to learn some finance along the way.\n\nI’m passionate about doing empirical research and teaching finance. This course allows me to do both. My goal is to help you make better financial decisions by improving your empirical skills, both your ability to produce and analyze your own research and perhaps more important, your ability to analyze evidence produced by others. We will spend much of the course considering the empirical procedures and evidence in academic papers. We will typically focus on the decisions the researchers make, why they make them, and how their decisions affect the conclusions. But we will also talk about the finance – what we learn from a paper, how the information fits in a broader framework, how it is useful, and where it might be wrong. I helped write many of the papers we will read, some long ago and some more recently. In fact, one or two may not be finished yet. The papers we will consider are in the general area of asset pricing.\n\nThis is a highly interactive, discussion-based course. I expect you to prepare for every class and to participate in every discussion. I will lead the discussions in the first part of the course which will cover a variety of topics, such as the advantage of a Bayesian perspective, the central role of volatility in financial analysis, the temptation to overfit, the importance of accurately estimated standard errors, the value of a well-framed model, and techniques for interpreting other people’s research. In the second part of the course, a team of two students will present the papers and lead the class discussions each week.\n\nPreparation for some of the classes will include a challenging research problem. Homework assignments in some courses read like cookbooks, with a step-by-step recipe to follow. Few real research problems come with such recipes. In fact, one of the biggest and most important challenges in research is figuring out the best procedure. Thus, my assignments do not have recipes. After you have thought deeply about possible approaches for an assignment, I will be happy to discuss your ideas with you. We will also have detailed discussions in class about the different approaches you and your colleagues developed and the conclusions you reached. Some students will be frustrated by the open-ended nature of these assignments, but I think it is the best way for you to develop a real understanding of the research process in finance and the importance of the decisions a researcher makes.\n\nThe success of this course will depend on a high level of engagement from all students. Obviously, preparing for and leading your week of classes is a big commitment. You must also prepare for and participate in the discussions in every other class. Attendance is mandatory. If you expect to miss one or more classes, please don’t take the course. If an emergency prevents you from attending class during the quarter, please let me know immediately.\n\nYour grade in the course will be determined by your preparation for and execution in the classes you lead, your preparation for classes more generally (including the assignments), and your overall contribution to class discussions.\n\nRESEARCH TO PRACTICE SEMINAR: NLP, MACHINE LEARNING, AND AI IN FINANCE (RTPNL)\n\nProfessor Gordon Phillips\n\nWe will study finance applications of new big data textual methods including Natural Language Processing (NLP)/ Machine Learning (ML), and Textual Artificial Intelligence (AI). We will examine how this broad area has applications in finance with tools that include simple text processing to more advanced tools such as machine learning and predictive AI. Areas that we will study that are using NLP include merger prediction and performance, profitability prediction, stock return prediction, evaluation of venture capital business plans, innovation and patenting, banking and other finance topics. Our study materials will be academic articles in finance and economics, not computer science. Students will be responsible for reading and presenting the materials in these articles as well as doing a final research project that would involve analysis of textual data using some of the methods covered in this course. There will be active learning in this course as students will help lead the discussion of various topic areas and we will have some Python exercises that have been developed with accompanying videos. Knowledge of Python is not required as we will guide students through some basic exercises in textual analysis applied to financial documents including 10Ks, earnings calls, and patent text.\n\nRESEARCH TO PRACTICE SEMINAR: QUANTITATIVE INVESTING WITH PYTHON\n\nProfessor Juhani Linnainmaa\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to quantitative investing using Python. Although no prior knowledge of Python is required, some familiarity (or comfort) with coding may be useful. We will work with Jupyter notebooks that you can run and edit. Even if you have never coded in Python, you can execute the code, see what happens, and modify the code to understand what the code does. The assignments are modifications and extensions of the code used in lectures, that is, they do not require you to code up from scratch anything you do not see in the classroom notebooks.\n\nQuantitative investing in the context of this course means making systematic investment decisions informed by data. That is, there is little or no room for subjective judgments. We will introduce the basic Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and statsmodels) that we need for acquiring and analyzing data and for completing financial computations such as creating trading strategies and evaluating returns. We start from constructing academic factors (such as value and momentum) and briefly discuss the principles of machine learning and the use (and the associated caveats) of ML techniques for predicting returns. The objective of the course is to give an overview of the methods used in quantitative investing.\n\nRESEARCH TO PRACTICE SEMINAR: QUANTITATIVE PRIVATE EQUITY(RTPQP)\n\nProfessor Morten Sorensen\n\nThe seminar covers recent academic studies of private equity investments, although the material applies broadly to other alternative assets organized in similar fund structures (e.g., venture capital, growth equity, mezzanine, infrastructure, private debt and real estate funds). The material is divided into two parts: The first part covers the relationship between private equity funds and their portfolio companies. This part covers topics such as the impact of private equity on corporate governance and operations as well as the consequences for employees and other stakeholders in the portfolio companies. The second part takes the perspective of the limited partners (LPs) that provide capital to private equity funds. Topics include the organization and economics of the private equity partnership, risk and return and performance evaluation of private equity funds, and portfolio considerations when allocating capital to private equity funds.\n\nThe course is technical. The material consists primarily of recent research papers, with a focus on the empirical and statistical analysis in these papers. There will not be much discussion of private equity deal structures and specific transactions. The material is mostly presented in student led presentations, which require substantial preparation and insight into the technical aspects of the papers. A substantial part of the course is two empirical projects where the students will do a statistical analysis of actual private equity data and present their findings to the class. Some familiarity with statistical software, such as R or Stata, is recommended, although it is also possible to do the analysis in Excel.\n\nREAL ESTATE (RE)\n\nProfessor Brian Melzer\n\nThis course provides an overview of the real estate industry and the basic analytic techniques used for investing in this $20 trillion asset class. Students will take a hands-on approach, building a practical knowledge of real estate through case studies, and class discussions. The study of multi-faceted real estate projects allows students to: 1) enhance their understanding of valuation, financing and portfolio management; and 2) analyze a broader set of management problems, such as how to recognize and describe value creation opportunities, how to evaluate and manage risk, how to structure partnerships and business contracts, and how to use real estate optimally within an operating business. A highlight of the course is the opportunity to interact with industry leaders and learn about the latest techniques and trends in the industry.\n\nSMALL BUYOUTS - PRIVATE EQUITY PRACTICUM (PRPEP)\n\nProfessor Nicholas Russell\n\nSmall Buyouts Private Equity Practicum (“PEP”) is will engage Tuck students in a hands-on learning experience to apply what they have learned in other Tuck classes as well as from their pre-Tuck careers and internships developing their private markets investment fluency, pattern recognition and judgement applied in the real-world context of actual small and middle market buyout acquisitions and investment theses.\n\nThe learning objective of the class is to enhance the students’ effectiveness in the private investment industry, whether that involvement comes through becoming an investor, becoming a manager of a private institutionally owned business, or as one of the many other participants (consultants, bankers, etc.) in the industry, through relevant, actionable, “real-world” experiential learning.\n\nThe class is delivered through two curricular elements: a) Deal Review Lab: the review, preparation, presentation and group discussion/evaluation of a series of current and/or recent, real small market buyout opportunity “cases” led by students to simulate an investment committee setting and b) Investment Thesis development: individual student research into an industry sub-segment or other theme to develop and deliver a potentially actionable private equity investment targeting thesis.\n\nSTRUCTURING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS (SMA)\n\nProfessor Karin S. Thorburn\n\nThis is a minicourse on corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Students will develop the skills necessary to structure a deal or form an opinion about a proposed transaction. Topics include value creation in mergers; choice of payment method; valuation of contingent payments; deal protection devices; incentive effects of deal financing; merger arbitrage; bidding strategies; hostile takeovers; and defensive tactics. We also touch on key elements of the legal and regulatory framework for takeovers, such as filing requirements, fiduciary duties of the target board of directors, and antitrust regulation. The course relies primarily on case analysis, providing ample opportunity to perform merger analysis and practice various corporate valuation techniques.\n\nVENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY (VCPE)\n\nProfessor Gordon M. Phillips\n\nThe purpose of this class is to examine and understand the full spectrum of private equity investing including venture capital, growth equity, and buyouts as well as the limited partners that invest in the asset class (focusing on asset allocation) and the general partners who are the investment managers. Starting with asset allocation and the role of private equity as an asset class, the course will also consider general and limited partners, and the motivations and goals of investors in this asset class as well as their opportunities and choices among managers. The class will then study in detail the venture capital, buyouts and growth equity segments of the private equity industry with the goal of understanding the process of selecting investments in these spaces. This course is recommended for students interested in a career as 1) an investment profession in a venture capital/growth equity/buyout firm; 2) as a service provider to the private equity industry especially including consulting but also including banking, fundraising, executive search, and wealth management; 3) as a member of senior management of a venture-backed or PE-backed company; and 4.) as an investment professional interested in allocating money to the private equity asset class.\n\nVENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY BASICS (VCPEB)\n\nProfessor Gordon M. Phillips\n\nThe course covers the entire private equity sector (including venture capital, growth equity, and buyouts as well as institutional investors in the sector) of the economy. The course will focus on the basics of venture capital and private equity industries for students with less experience in finance and/or investing. The course will study VC/PE industry participants and explore their various perspectives, models, strategies, objectives, and challenges. Through cases and quantitative exercises, we will introduce the basic analysis and quantitative and qualitative factors involved in venture capital investing, growth equity financing, leveraged buyout (LBO) transactions. Class will incorporate quantitative exercises, cases and models but there will be fewer cases than the regular session of VCPE and we will examine them in greater depth over multiple class periods. We will also have more in class exercises. Guest speakers will be an integral part of the course when we have cases.\n\n(Back to top)\n\nHealth Care\n\nCONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN BIOTECHNOLOGY (CIB)\n\nProfessor Kirsten H. Detrick\n\nIn this course, students will explore biotechnology fundamentals, examining the strategic, operational, legal, scientific, and ethical drivers of this complex industry. We'll discuss how biotech leaders' decisions, influenced by science, market dynamics, governments, and global health challenges impact patient care and business strategy. This course emphasizes commercialization, manufacturing, marketing, and finance challenges in both start-up and corporate biotech contexts.\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP IN HEALTH CARE SERVices and technology (EHC)\n\nProfessor Adam Groff D'99; Professor Trevor Price; Professor Michael Zubkoff\n\nThis minicourse focuses on our belief that for healthcare startups, great organizations are built with substantial planning and an intentional approach to defining a unique business solution and building a founding team. Health care startups are challenged moving from seed to scale due to regulatory, scalability, and business model concerns. Our goal is to teach students in the class about building great teams that can execute against precise strategy to improve likelihood of success. We will be joined by startup founders and venture capital investors focused on health care services and technology. Students will get time with these executives and will have an opportunity to help them solve some of these critical elements related to building teams and startup strategy.\n\nHealth Care Analytics & Society (HCAS)\n\nProfessor Lindsey Leininger\n\nThis course is about health analytics in action. With epidemiology as our key tour guide, we will introduce and apply timeless scientific concepts to timely case studies. Examples include the commercialization of patient data; the unintended consequences of tying physician payments to statistical algorithms; and the promise and perils of digital disease detection. Students will be provided with a series of practical data diligence tools speaking to descriptive, predictive, and evaluative applications of health analytics. By the end of the course students will be able to recognize and apply key frameworks critical for wise, data-driven leadership across the health sector.\n\nINVESTING AND DEAL MAKING IN HEALTH CARE: THE PRACTITIONERS’ PERSPECTIVES (IDHC):\n\nProfessor Michael A. Carusi T'93 ; Professor Michael S. McIvor D'86, T'93; Professor Michael Zubkoff; Suzanne Rubin\n\nThis minicourse looks at the complexities and inner workings of the health care ecosystem, providing a practitioner's point of view on the players, how they interact, partner and transact. Students are introduced to health services, medical technology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals and health IT. The path for venture capital and private equity-backed companies from creation to exit is explored, including the goals and incentives of various stakeholders. The course covers different types of investing and deal making transactions as well as strategies, tactics, and analytical tools.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS (MHCO)\n\nProfessor Paul B. Gardent T'76\n\nThis minicourse provides students with knowledge and understanding of key leadership and strategic challenges within health services organizations. It covers important functions of health services management, including strategy, finance, and operations and introduces students to leadership issues in performance improvement, change management, organizational leadership and strategic alliances.\n\nThis course is focused on the health services sector of the health industry. It will be relevant to those interested in health services leadership and management, and will be particularly valuable to anyone who will be working in companies serving health care service organizations including consulting, banking, and medical products. Some basic knowledge of the healthcare industry will be helpful.\n\nMEDICAL CARE AND THE CORPORATION (MCC)\n\nProfessor Paul B. Gardent T'76; Professor Michael Zubkoff\n\nEmployer-sponsored healthcare plays a significant role in the US health system. It is a critical factor impacting the competitiveness of companies from the largest international corporations to new start-ups. With the rapidly changing health care ecosystem business leaders are faced with new and important decisions regarding how they approach and finance health care for their employees. The challenge is not simply managing the cost of health care but also choosing the best strategy for recruiting and retaining a productive workforce in a competitive labor market. In this fast-changing and dynamic environment this has become a major strategic issue for businesses of all sizes and in all industries.\n\nMedical Care and the Corporation (MCC) will examine the critical issues facing business leaders today related to health care. It will build an understanding of the structure, economics, and dynamics of the employer-based healthcare system from the perspective of corporate leaders. Students will learn how changes in disruptive technologies, new players, and government policy, have fundamentally changed the strategic landscape for businesses. Through this course you will understand the alternative approaches being considered by businesses including large corporations, small businesses, and start-up companies. Students will learn how consulting firms and health insurance companies are analyzing the current market and advising their corporate clients. Finally, MCC will examine new disruptive approaches being offered to businesses to help them cope with these strategic issues. The course features cases and guest speakers who will demonstrate the diversity of ideas for meeting the business challenges created by our new healthcare environment.\n\nOur course includes Tuck School MBA students, Geisel medical students, and Geisel MPH students. Previous MCC students have indicated that a unique aspect of the course is the opportunity to interact and hear the perspectives of students from other graduate programs.\n\nSTRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION AND ECONOMICS OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY (SOE)\n\nProfessor Paul B. Gardent T'76; Professor Michael Zubkoff\n\nAt almost 20% of the US GDP health care represents the largest and most dynamic industry in the US. It plays a key role in many sectors of the economy. By introducing the structure, organization, and financing of health care in relationship to business and the economy, this course provides students with a fundamental understanding of the health care industry and critical issues in health care today. It will provide an industry-wide view from the differing perspectives within the health care value chain, including providers, suppliers, payers, and consumers, and examine the market dynamics among these players. The course will be presented through cases, lectures, invited presentations, and in-session discussion.\n\nThis course is appropriate for students who are contemplating careers in companies serving the health care industry such as consulting, private equity, or banking, or who have an interest in careers in health care (pharma, medical devices, biotech, or health delivery).\n\n(Back to top)\n\nMarketing\n\nAI FOR MANAGERS (AIM)\n\nProfessor Dean Alderucci\n\nIn this minicourse, students will learn about a wide range of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques and how they can be applied to the challenges and opportunities that firms face. AI is delivering impressive results across a growing number of industries and business functions, including marketing, strategy, operations, and finance. A firm’s competitive advantages increasingly rely on its ability to make superior decisions using AI technologies. This in turn requires managers to become conversant with a growing number of AI capabilities in order to assess and oversee the opportunities that AI provides.\n\nThis course provides broad exposure to how AI is used for different business tasks: marketing, product strategy, revenue management, operations, etc. We take the viewpoint of a manager or consultant who must understand and offer advice on a wide range of AI topics relevant to a variety of business needs. The course also describes the pitfalls and challenges firms face when attempting to introduce or scale AI technologies.\n\nBasic programming experience is required. You should be able to understand simple programs and you should be comfortable writing simple programs in a language such as R or Python. If you have taken the Quantitative Digital Marketing course, you will have the comfort level needed.\n\nBRAND STRATEGY (BSTRT)\n\nAndrés Cuneo Zuñiga\n\nDeveloping and managing intangible assets has become one of the main sources of differentiation that firms use to compete. Among all intangible assets, the brand is considered one of the most important ones. Specifically, for companies, the brand represents a way to build differentiation, drive loyalty, and leverage growth. For consumers, the brand is a link with which to establish relationships and, more interestingly, to express their identity.\n\nHowever, creating, developing, and managing brands to reach their full potential is more difficult than ever. Firms are facing a complex environment where differentiation is hard to build, products and services tend to be commoditized, product lifecycles are getting shorter every day, and consumers are not only more heterogenous, mobile, and well connected, but also skeptical about brands, and even about some marketing practices.\n\nDigital technologies have opened a world of opportunities for brands, especially start-ups, but also have empowered consumers when evaluating, choosing, and recommending brands. Interestingly, consumers are being actively involved in co-creating brand meaning. Brand Managers today are not only required to design branding concepts and interact with consumers in significantly new ways, but also to deliver promises that are relevant, credible, and consistent across geographies.\n\nDuring this 5 week- mini elective we will discuss the core elements of brand strategy. We will pay special attention to the role of brands and brand managers in the new competitive and social context. Core learnings will focus on how brand strategy can be defined, crafted, developed, and managed in ways that create value for today’s consumers and firms. While the main focus of the course is strategic, we will also discuss how brand strategy speaks to execution.\n\nBUSINESS APPLICATIONS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)\n\nProfessor Dean Alderucci\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) is the field of artificial intelligence that allows computers to understand human languages such as English. NLP has made astonishing strides in the past decade, and is increasingly used by businesses to extract and understand useful information from large amounts of unstructured text, found in sources such as customer correspondence, online product reviews, Twitter feeds, social media posts, press releases, SEC filings, news feeds, contract repositories, web pages, and organization document caches. NLP techniques allow businesses to gain insights into customers, competitors, and industries.\n\nIn this minicourse, students will gain knowledge of state-of-the-art NLP techniques, including large language models and associated tools. The course also describes how to apply those techniques to a range of marketing and other business problems. Students will become able to critically read the NLP literature, converse with NLP experts, and understand what new NLP capabilities are expected in the future. Students will also develop custom NLP software tools to solve concrete business problems, and will retain these tools to use after the course ends.\n\nBasic programming experience is required. You should be able to understand simple programs and you should be comfortable writing simple programs in a language such as R or Python. If you have taken the Quantitative Digital Marketing course in the Winter term, you will have the comfort level needed. If not, resources will be made available for you to get to that comfort level.\n\nCONSUMER INSIGHTS (CI)\n\nProfessor John Gourville\n\nThis course is designed for students who plan to work in firms that market directly to consumers or who plan to work in companies that offer support to these firms. It explores the challenges faced by marketers, business managers, strategic planners, and consultants in managing existing and new products in contexts ranging from consumer packaged goods and consumer technologies to pharmaceuticals and sports.\n\nThis course will expand upon and explore more deeply some of the concepts that were looked at in the core Marketing course. But, it will do so by taking a decidedly psychological look at consumers and their behavior, contrasting what consumer should do with what they actually do.\n\nThe primary goal of this course is to provide a greater appreciation for how and why consumers purchase the goods and services that they do. In this regard, it is not enough to develop good products, it is also necessary to overcome the biases and tendencies that consumers bring to their decision making. This course should provide a better understanding of what those biases and tendencies are.\n\nTo do this, the course will rely upon in class case discussions (a mix of older and newer cases), and exercises that try to get students to apply some of the concepts explored in the course.\n\nCREATING WINNING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (CWNPS)\n\nProfessor Peter Golder\n\nThis course builds upon the inaugural offering of CWNPS in Winter 2023 by incorporating (i) an individual student project on the creative process of a person you admire, (ii) updated research findings on creativity and innovation, and (iii) student suggestions for streamlining the course content. New products and services are vital to companies’ success. In fact, creativity and innovation are the key drivers of market success and shareholder value for most of today’s leading companies. Indeed, a culture of creativity, innovation, and design is commonly recognized as the only persistent competitive advantage. To win (and hopefully dominate) markets, companies must often create entire new markets and move beyond a product’s functional capabilities to connect with customers on an emotional and relational basis. However, innovation is risky and most new products fail. This course teaches a process for identifying market opportunities, creating new product/service ideas, and turning those ideas into valuable new products and services. We focus on the tools and techniques for analyzing market opportunities, creative thinking for generating new ideas, and then designing, testing, and launching new products and services. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are covered. More specifically, this course covers the new product development process, including idea generation, concept testing, product design and development, mapping customer perceptions, product positioning, market sizing, and market entry strategies. The course emphasizes how to incorporate customers and competitors into all aspects of new product development. Students will solidify their learning by putting these tools and techniques into practice by forming teams to conceive and develop a new market offering and then present their idea to classmates and external judges. The goal of each presentation is to convince others that your idea satisfies criteria for winning in the marketplace. For your individual project, you will select a creative genius who you admire, research their creative process, and prepare a brief write-up reflecting on their process, your own creative process, and the creativity processes discussed during the course. The course is intended for students who are interested in creating and developing innovations, both in entrepreneurial firms and in established companies; and for students interested in enhancing their creativity more broadly. The course structure is flexible in terms of choosing case write-ups and selecting group and individual projects, so you can tailor the course to meet your personal goals.\n\nCUSTOMER ANALYTICS (CA)\n\nProfessor Scott A. Neslin\n\nThis course introduces students to the concepts and methods of customer analytics – leveraging customer data to increase marketing productivity. Methods covered include lifetime value of the customer (CLV), predictive modeling (using regression, logistic regression, matching, neural nets, and random forests), and experimentation/testing. Students will work on real applications and databases. Applications include customer acquisition, acquisition and retention management, cross-selling, up-selling, churn management, targeting online advertising, loyalty program evaluation, marketing attribution, and multichannel customer management. Industries examined include subscription services, software, retailing, financial services, consumer electronics, telecom, and travel. Software used includes Excel, a commercial predictive modeling package, and R. Upon completing this course, students should have a working knowledge of customer analytics, its application potential, and limitations.\n\nDigital and Social Media Marketing (DSMM)\n\nProfessor Lauren Grewal\n\nDigital platforms, particularly various forms of social media, continue to dramatically change how business is done. These changes are pervasive, and extend beyond changing how companies communicate with customers and how employees communicate with each other. For example, digital/social platforms have a role to play in how marketers generate demand for products, how product development teams create new innovations, how customer service is carried out, how risks are assessed, and how companies learn about competitors and market trends.\n\nDigital/social platforms present firms with enormous opportunities for creating and enhancing value for both themselves and customers. How these communications technologies can – and should – be used for strategic value-generating purposes, however, is not straightforward. This course grapples with this challenge, with the primary aim being to help students understand how to unlock the value in digital/social platforms across a variety of business contexts and for several markedly different purposes. Thus, students should leave the course knowing the basics of digital marketing jargon and with the underlying knowledge to become proficient in digital marketing. Within this course, students will learn how to developing appropriate digital marketing strategies, additionally understanding the tools necessary to analyze and guide strategy. An ancillary goal of this course is to gain practical experience in fielding digital marketing campaigns.\n\nMARKETING RESEARCH AND ANALYTICS FOR DATA DRIVEN GROWTH (MRA)\n\nProfessor Sharmistha Sikdar\n\nMost decisions in marketing are characterized by significant levels of uncertainty. Some of these decision-making instances are new market entry, new product or service development, product pricing etc. Marketers can control for the uncertainty around a decision making with appropriate research and data analysis. Market research and analysis enables marketers to understand and predict evolving customer trends and anticipate competitor response.\n\nThis course provides a managerial introduction to market research and analysis methods that can help managers with the following:\n\ni) Translate marketing decision problems into questions amenable to research and analysis.\n\nii) Scope out the problem and determine the research design.\n\niii) Identify sources of data and appraise these on cost and quality considerations.\n\niv) Identify and utilize the right methodology and analysis toolkit for the research question at hand.\n\nv) Interpret results from the analysis and de"
