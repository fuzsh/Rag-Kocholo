        "text": "What is a CEEB code?\n\nCEEB stands for College Entrance Examination Board, which is what College Board used to be known as. A CEEB code is a unique identifier that College Board assigns to high schools, colleges, and universities. Students use these codes at different points in the college application process to identify different institutions, including high schools, colleges, universities, and scholarship programs.\n\nWhen do you need to find your school’s CEEB code?\n\nYou’ll need the CEEB code if you’re applying to some colleges directly or using the Common Application. It allows your school to submit forms and documents—such as your transcript—on your behalf.\n\nHow do I find my CEEB code?\n\nThe CEEB code for your high school is often provided to you by your school. If you need to find your school’s CEEB code, you can also use the K–12 School Code Search.\n\nWhen looking for the CEEB Code for a K–12 school, you’ll need the name of the school and state or zip code to fill out the search form. If you want to verify that you have the correct K–12 school code, you can search using the code to ensure you have the correct school. The codes for K–12 schools are always six-digit numbers.\n\nWhat is the CEEB code if I’m homeschooled?\n\nThe high school code for all homeschoolers is 970000.\n\nWhat are Score Reporting Codes?\n\nWhen you take the SAT on a school day(or register to take the SAT on a weekend), you can send your scores for free to up to four places—these can be colleges, universities, or scholarship programs. The CEEB Codes for these institutions are four-digit codes. They can all be found in this code list. You can also send your scores online using your College Board account. The code search is built into the score sending tool.\n\nWhat are other codes I might need?"
