Chandler currently serves as a player development coach for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Chandler was drafted directly out of high school as the second overall pick of the 2001 NBA Draft by the Los Angeles Clippers, then was immediately traded to the Chicago Bulls. He has also played for the New Orleans Hornets, Charlotte Bobcats, Mavericks, New York Knicks, Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Lakers, and Houston Rockets. As starting Center for Dallas, he played an integral role in the franchise's first NBA championship in 2011. He has been named to the NBA All-Defensive Team three times. While with New York, Chandler was voted the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2012, when he was also named to the All-NBA Third Team. He is a member of the United States men's national basketball team and won gold medals with the team in the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Summer Olympics. Standing 7'1\", he played at the Center position.\n\nEarly life and high school career[]\n\nChandler was born to Frank Chandler and Vernie Threadgill, though he did not meet his father Frank until later in his life. He grew up in a family farm in Hanford, California, just south of Fresno, California. Chandler began playing basketball at the age of three years on a basket Chandler's grandfather, Cleotis, fixed on a tree. Chandler grew up doing farm work such as milking cows, slopping pigs, and cultivating crops. At the age of nine years, Chandler and his mother moved to San Bernardino, California; he was already nearly six feet tall. As a child, Chandler was teased because of his height; children on his school basketball team joked that he was older than he really was, and that he had been left back several times in school.\n\nAs a freshman, Chandler enrolled at Dominguez High School in Compton, California, a school known for its athletics, producing basketball players such as Dennis Johnson and Cedric Ceballos. In his freshman year, Chandler made the varsity team and played with future NBA player Tayshaun Prince, who was then a senior. With the Dominguez Dons, Chandler became a teenage sensation; current players such as DeMar DeRozan watched him play and claimed \"he was like Shaq\". Point Guard Brandon Jennings, who was a ball boy for Dominguez at the time, said, \"You'd see the girls around Tyson, the Escalade he drove, and you wanted to be like him\". Chandler earned accolades from Parade Magazine and USA Today and was selected to the McDonald's High School All-America Team. As a freshman, he was profiled on current affairs TV program 60 Minutes.\n\nIn his junior year, Chandler averaged 20 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 blocks. In his senior year, Chandler led Dominguez to a state championship and a 31–4 record, averaging 26 points, 15 rebounds, and 8 blocks a game. Chandler was recruited by several universities and considered UCLA, Arizona, Syracuse, Memphis, Kentucky and Michigan. Chandler then declared for the 2001 NBA Draft as a prep-to-pro.\n\nProfessional career[]\n\nChicago Bulls (2001–2006)[]\n\nTyson Chandler was selected 2nd overall by the Los Angeles Clippers, who immediately traded his rights to the Chicago Bulls for former NBA Rookie of the Year Award recipient Elton Brand. The Bulls intended to pair Chandler with fellow high school phenom Eddy Curry in the front court. However, while both players had stretches of success during their time with the Bulls, they rarely coincided. In Chandler's case, back problems were a recurring issue throughout his career, particularly during the 2003-04 season. During the early part of his career, Chandler feuded with Brendan Haywood of the Washington Wizards and Amare Stoudemire of the Phoenix Suns. Later, although the feuds became less frequent, Chandler struggled with foul trouble, which limited his playing time.\n\nChandler also played a major role in the resurgent Bulls' playoff run in the 2004-05 season. Finding a role as a fourth-quarter defensive specialist, with notable game-saving blocks against stars like Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony, he was rewarded with a long-term deal to remain with the Chicago Bulls for the next six years, reportedly worth close to $63 million. With Curry's departure after the 2004-05 season, Chandler became the last member of the Bulls left from the Jerry Krause era.\n\nDuring the 2005-06 season, Chandler's biggest impact was on defense, but he struggled with foul problems and averaged only 5.3 points per game. Due in part to his sub-par playoff performance and the Bulls' signing of four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace in the off-season after the 2005-2006 season, Bulls GM John Paxson began to consider moving Chandler. On July 5, 2006, the Bulls and the Hornets verbally agreed to a trade that would send Chandler to the Hornets in exchange for J.R. Smith and P.J. Brown.[1] The deal was finalized the following week.[2]\n\nNew Orleans Hornets (2006–2009)[]\n\nChandler had his best NBA season in 2006-2007 where he averaged 9.5 ppg and 12.4 rpg to go with 1.8 bpg\n\nChandler followed that up with an even better season where he put up 11.7 points and 11.8 rebounds a game and led the league in offensive rebounding. His defense, rebounding and the ability to connect with Chris Paul on the Crescent City Connection (Name for their alleyoop pass) allowed the Hornets to claim the 2007-08 Southwest division for the first time ever with 56 wins. Chandler played well in the playoffs and defended Tim Duncan valiantly but in the end the Hornets lost a heartbreaking game 7 where Chandler limited Duncan to 5-17 shooting.\n\nOn January 2, 2009, he was suspended one game for an altercation with Joel Przybilla.\n\nCharlotte Bobcats (2009–2010)[]\n\nOn July 28, 2009, he was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats in exchange for Emeka Okafor. Chandler joined a Bobcats team that had never made the playoffs in their young history. Chandler struggled with injuries in 2009–10, missing more than a month with a stress fracture in his left foot. Chandler still helped the Bobcats win 44 games and earn their first-ever postseason berth. The Bobcats, led by Gerald Wallace and Stephen Jackson, made it to the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, and went up against the Orlando Magic. Chandler had the task of defending Dwight Howard. He limited Howard to 9 points and 9 rebounds per game, both below his season and career averages. The Bobcats were, however, swept in their first trip to the playoffs with their Bobcats moniker.\n\nDallas Mavericks (2010–2011)[]\n\nOn July 13, 2010, Chandler was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, along with Alexis Ajinça, in exchange for Matt Carroll, Erick Dampier, and Eduardo Nájera. The Mavericks went 57–25, earning the third seed in the Western Conference. They defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in six games in the first round, swept the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the second round, and defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games in the Western Conference Finals. The Mavericks went into the NBA Finals, facing the Miami Heat. Chandler was instrumental in the series with his defense. In Game 4, Chandler recorded 13 points and 16 rebounds. The Mavericks won their maiden championship with a 4–2 series victory over the Heat despite being down 2-1.\n\nNew York Knicks (2011–2014)[]\n\nOn December 9, 2011, Chandler announced that he agreed to terms on a four year contract with the New York Knicks worth $58 million. He was officially acquired by the Knicks in a three team sign-and-trade. On Opening Day, Christmas 2011, Chandler finished with 7 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists, and 6 blocks in a 106–104 win over the Boston Celtics.\n\nChandler finished the regular season with a 67.9% field goal percentage, the third highest in NBA history, exceeded only by Wilt Chamberlain in 1967 (68.26%) and 1973 (72.7%). In May 2012, Chandler was named second team All-Defensive behind Serge Ibaka and Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic, who made first-team All-Defensive. Although Chandler was voted Defensive Player of the Year by the press, the All-Defensive Team is chosen by the league's 30 head coaches (who cannot vote for their own players).\n\nAnd while his 13 first-team votes and 36 overall points were more than the totals for first-team selections Tony Allen of the Memphis Grizzlies and Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers, Howard received 41 points with 16 first-team votes, and only one center can be named to the team.\n\nDuring the 2012-13 season, Chandler was named a reserve for the 2013 All-Star Game. It was the first All-Star selection of his career. In February, Chandler recorded 20 rebounds in three straight games, becoming the first Knick to do so since Willis Reed in December 1969. Chandler had 7 points and 8 rebounds at the All-Star Game.\n\nOn February 27, 2013, Chandler recorded a career-high 28 rebounds, including 13 in the first quarter, in a 109–105 victory over the Golden State Warriors. On November 5, 2013, he suffered a right fibula fracture during a 97-102 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nSecond stint with Dallas (2014–2015)[]\n\nOn June 25, 2014 Chandler along with Raymond Felton, was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Shane Larkin, Wayne Ellington, José Calderón, Samuel Dalembert, and two second round picks in the 2014 NBA Draft. The move reunited Chandler with teammates Dirk Nowitzki and J. J Barea as well as coach Rick Carlisle, who were all part of the Mavericks title team in the 2010–11 NBA season.\n\nPhoenix Suns (2015–2018)[]\n\nOn July 9, 2015, Chandler signed a four-year, $52 million deal with the Phoenix Suns. He made his debut for the Suns in the team's season opener on October 28 against his former team, the Dallas Mavericks, recording three points and six rebounds in a 111–95 loss. He appeared in 15 of the team's first 16 games before missing eight straight games with a hamstring injury. On December 13, he returned to action for the Suns, coming off the bench against the Minnesota Timberwolves and recording three points and four rebounds in 23 minutes.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2018–2019)[]\n\nOn November 6, 2018, Chandler signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHouston Rockets (2019–2020)[]\n\nOn July 12, 2019, Chandler signed a one-year deal with the Houston Rockets. Chandler's final NBA game was played in Game 5 of the 2020 Western Conference First Round on August 29, 2020 against the Oklahoma City Thunder. In that game, Tyson was in for less than 1 minute and only shot 2 free throws (missing both). The Rockets would win the game 114–80 and go on to win the series in seven games, but lost to Tyson's former team and the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in the next round in five games.\n\nNational team career[]\n\nChandler was named first alternate on the United States national team which competed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nChandler was a member of the United States team at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, a team that finished 9–0 in the tournament and won the gold medal, the USA's first world championship since 1994. He played in all nine World Championship games as a backup center, averaged 2.6 ppg and 2.7 rpg, shot 64.3 percent from the field, and blocked five shots.\n\nChandler was chosen to play for the United States team in the 2012 London Summer Olympics, and was named the team's starting center. The United States team finished undefeated in the tournament and won the gold medal over Spain with a 107–100 victory. Chandler played 9 minutes, and made 1 of 2 shots from the field. He ended the game with two points, which were the first points scored during the game.\n\nCoaching career[]\n\nIn the summer of 2021, Chandler became a player development coach for the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nAwards and honors[]\n\nGold medal with Team USA, FIBA Americas Championship 2007, 2010 FIBA World Championship, and 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nUntil the age of 10, Chandler grew up with his grandfather on a farm in central California.\n\nHis sister, Erica, played basketball at Pepperdine University. He has three brothers: Terrell, Tervon, and Ryan. His paternal grandmother is of German descent. Chandler is the son of Frank Chandler and the late Vernie Re Threadgill.\n\nChandler and his wife, Kimberly, welcomed daughter Sacha-Marie on May 6, 2006, weighing in at 7 pounds, 14 ounces and on November 27, 2008, their second child, a boy of 6 pounds was born. He attended the same high school with Detroit Pistons forward Tayshaun Prince.\n\nTyson and his wife have put together a charity where they are helping New Orleans families that have suffered from Hurricane Katrina. They help buying some \"small things\" (as Chandler said) for their homes: TVs, stoves, microwaves, refrigerators, pots, pans etc. The wives of Tyson's teammates are helping them.\n\nOn November 27, 2008, Tyson and his wife had a baby. He missed the game vs the Denver Nuggets, but the New Orleans Hornets managed to win 105-101.\n\nHe was the subject of a limited edition 100 copy zine titled \"Tyson Chandler\". The zine was created in fall 2011 by Camilla Venturini and the photographer Ari Marcopoulos, and was the subject of a lengthy article in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn 2016, Chandler joined UNICEF Kid Power as a UNICEF Kid Power Champion for a mission in Uganda, in an effort to fight global malnutrition and as well as raise awareness among kids, via the world's first \"wearable for good\".\n\nChandler and his wife Kimberly separated in August 2021. In September 2021, his wife Kimberly filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nNBA career statistics[]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high † Won an NBA championship * Led the league\n\nRegular season[]\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2001–02 Chicago 71 31 19.6 .497 .000 .604 4.8 .8 .4 1.3 6.1 2002–03 Chicago 75 68 24.4 .531 .000 .608 6.9 1.0 .5 1.4 9.2 2003–04 Chicago 35 8 22.3 .424 .000 .669 7.7 .7 .5 1.2 6.1 2004–05 Chicago 80 10 27.4 .494 .000 .673 9.7 .8 .9 1.8 8.0 2005–06 Chicago 79 50 26.8 .565 .000 .503 9.0 1.0 .5 1.3 5.3 2006–07 New Orleans 73 73 34.6 .624 .000 .527 12.4 .9 .5 1.8 9.5 2007–08 New Orleans 79 79 35.2 .623 .000 .593 11.7 1.0 .6 1.1 11.8 2008–09 New Orleans 45 45 32.1 .565 .000 .579 8.7 .5 .3 1.2 8.8 2009–10 Charlotte 51 27 22.8 .574 .000 .732 6.3 .3 .3 1.1 6.5 2010–11† Dallas 74 74 27.8 .654 .000 .732 9.4 .4 .5 1.1 10.1 2011–12 New York 62 62 33.2 .679* .000 .689 11.0 .9 .9 1.4 11.3 2012–13 New York 66 66 32.8 .638 .000 .694 10.7 .9 .6 1.1 10.4 2013–14 NBA season New York 55 55 30.2 .593 .000 .632 9.6 1.1 .7 1.1 8.7 2014–15 Dallas 75 75 30.5 .666 .000 .720 11.5 1.1 .6 1.2 10.3 2015–16 Phoenix 66 60 24.5 .583 .000 .620 8.7 1.0 .5 .7 7.2 2016–17 Phoenix 47 46 27.6 .671 .000 .734 11.5 .6 .7 .5 8.4 2017–18 Phoenix 46 46 25.0 .647 .000 .617 9.1 1.2 .3 .6 6.5 2018–19 Phoenix 7 0 12.7 .667 .000 .556 5.6 .9 .3 .1 3.7 2018–19 L.A.
