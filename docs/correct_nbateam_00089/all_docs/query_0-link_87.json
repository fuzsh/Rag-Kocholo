        "text": "After drafting Dereck Lively II with the 12th pick, Dallas Mavericks vice president Michael Finley compared the former Duke standout to 19-year NBA veteran Tyson Chandler.\n\nMavericks head coach Jason Kidd can see that comparison.\n\nChandler played two seasons with the Mavericks (2010-11, 2014-15) and helped the team to the title in 2011 alongside Kidd, Dirk Nowitzki and others. The 7-footer was also the Defensive Player of the Year in 2012 and a three-time All-Defensive team selection.\n\nHe established himself as a defensive threat in the paint and was often dominant on the glass, qualities Lively also possesses. The comparison between the two is easy to see, though, Kidd added one caveat to it when asked about it this week.\n\nI think there are some similarities when you look at Tyson later in his career. He came into this league as a 3 out of high school and ended his career as a center but there are some similarities. I think Dereck — unfortunately, Tyson, don’t be mad — probably shoots the ball a little bit better than Tyson. But we’re excited to have Dereck. … Dereck works extremely hard. He has fulfilled part of his dream and that is to be drafted. The next part is to be a champion and he is ready to work.\n\nLively, standing at 7 feet, 1 inch, was named to the ACC All-Defensive team after averaging 5.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.4 blocks and 1.1 assists on 65.8% shooting from the field. His 82 blocked shots were the second-most in a season by a freshman in program history.\n\nHe was an excellent rim protector and overall defender. He was eighth in the country in blocks and swatted at least one shot in 32 of his 34 games. He had six blocks in a first-round win over Oral Roberts, a program record by a freshman in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nOf course, it is far too early to tell if Lively can be as successful as Chandler but the 19-year-old is up for the challenge. He has plenty of room to develop but wants to carry those defensive attributes over into the NBA.\n\nJust being able to play within the system. Being able to spread the floor and still being able to protect the rim, (being) a threat under the basket and being the most coachable player on the floor.\n\nThe 19-year-old is eager to get to work with the Mavericks.\n\nThe team also drafted Marquette forward Olivier-Maxence Prosper at No. 24 as it looks to add more youth, athleticism and versatility to the roster. The two rookies project to help in those areas alongside Luka Doncic and, potentially, Kyrie Irving, who is a free agent.\n\nLively is excited about the chance to learn from them.\n\n“I’m not just trying to go in and play my game,” Lively said. “I’m going to go in and try to play the NBA’s game and learn as quickly as possible and develop. I’m not going to go in and be perfect. I’m just trying to go in and be 1% better each day so I can see how far I can go.”"
