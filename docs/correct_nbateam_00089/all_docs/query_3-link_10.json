        "text": "Getty Images\n\nTyson Chandler has decided to leave the Dallas Mavericks in free agency, opting to sign with the Phoenix Suns, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports. Marc Stein of ESPN reported it is a four-year deal worth $52 million.\n\nPrior to Chandler's signing with Phoenix, Ramona Shelburne of ESPN reported the Clippers could pursue a sign-and-trade for him if the team lost DeAndre Jordan, while ESPN's Chris Broussard reported the Milwaukee Bucks as a potential landing place.\n\nChandler, 32, told ESPN.com's Tim MacMahon on June 27 he understands the Mavs might want a younger option in the middle:\n\n\"I'm not a free agent guy. You know, I just like to get things over with as soon as possible,\" Chandler also said, via Dwain Price of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\n\nAfter spending three seasons with the New York Knicks, Chandler found himself traded back to the Mavericks in the summer of 2014. Throughout the following campaign, Chandler flashed the double-double potential that's made him one of the most reliable two-way centers over the past decade.\n\nTony Gutierrez/Associated Press\n\nAccording to Basketball-Reference.com, Chandler was one of just eight players to average at least 10 points, 10 rebounds and a block last season. Furthermore, Chandler and Pau Gasol (34) were the only players over 30 to join that club.\n\nComing off a season during which Chandler made $14.6 million, according to Spotrac, it's difficult to envision him getting paid like a top-five center again next year as he continues to age.\n\nThat said, Chandler still has incredible value as a screen-setter, shot-blocker and cleanup man around the rim and will be an asset to any acquiring team."
