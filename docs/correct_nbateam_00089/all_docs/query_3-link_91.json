        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks won the 2011 NBA championship with Tyson Chandler as their center and anchor. The Mavericks brought Chandler back this summer in a trade with the New York Knicks, where he spent his last three seasons.\n\nTalking with Tim MacMahon of ESPN, Chandler speaks on his desire to impact the defensive identity of this Mavericks team,\n\nI’m going to make them defend. We’re going to defend. You can score as many points as you want, but at the end of the day, defense wins championships and that’s what we’re going to do.\n\nGuys don’t have to be the best individual defenders in the league, but we are going to be a great defensive team. You have to do your assignment. We’re not going to take plays off.\n\nChandler is basically talking about doing the job he’s accustomed to, regardless of any roster he’s on. Dallas’ most significant acquisition this summer was adding Chandler Parsons in free agency, which gives Dallas another viable offensive option so supplement Dirk Nowitzki and Monta Ellis.\n\nImproving offensively was important, particularly in the loaded, score-to-survive western conference, but establishing a strong defensive presence is just as important, and Chandler knows it. Defense is a mentality and a choice. As he stated and understands, turning guys into great individual defenders overnight is impossible, however it is perfectly reasonable for Chandler to help invoke the mentality for this Dallas team to defend. The former Defensive Player of the Year has plenty of experience in that department."
