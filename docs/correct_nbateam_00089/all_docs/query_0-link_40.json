        "text": "The Mavs’ main defensive difference-maker, for one, is convinced that the added pressure won’t matter, whether Dallas has to deal with the punishing Zach Randolph/Marc Gasol tag team or the young, springy legs of Kevin Durant and Co. Chandler’s argument? The confidence and swagger gained from routing and utterly frustrating the Lakers into those classless fourth-quarter fouls by Andrew Bynum and Lamar Odom will neutralize any now-or-never weight Dallas just took on. “You can see it in guys’ eyes,” Chandler insisted. “Look around the locker room. Guys are not that excited.”\n\nSo even if they don’t get the sweep, they would appear to be in great shape. The Lakers have to win a game just to stay alive. The Mavericks need just one win to finish this thing off and they have four opportunities to get it done, theoretically speaking, of course … “We’ve been fortunate to get this 3-0 lead,” said Mavs center Tyson Chandler. “Until it’s 4-0, I’m not going to count them out. I don’t want to put any words in their mouths. I’m not sure how they’re feeling right now. I just know how we’re feeling. We feel like we’ve got to seize the moment. We’ve got a great opportunity, and we’ve got to close it.”\n\nBryant did get one chance for glory after Kidd scored Dallas’ final point on a free throw with 3.1 seconds left. Bryant came off a screen, caught an inbounds pass and fired a 3-pointer looking for the win, conjouring up all kinds of memories for the Mavericks. “I grew up in L.A. and I’ve seen this too many times,” said Chandler who went to Dominguez High School in Compton. “I’ve seen a lot of his game-winners up close in person when I was with Phoenix,” said Kidd.\n\nBut Chandler is now with a Mavericks team that desperately wants to win championships and dominate the NBA. And that dream can’t continue unless the Mavs find a way to get past the Lakers. “I think when you grow up in LA you either want to be a Laker,” Chandler said, “or be on another team and you want to kill the Lakers. “I’m on another team. So you know what I want to do.”\n\nThis series is a childhood dream come true for Southern California native Tyson Chandler. He’s always wanted a chance to knock off the Lakers. “Some players used to imagine themselves as other players,” said Chandler, who moved throughout Southern California as a child and attended high school basketball powerhouse Compton Dominguez. “I used to imagine myself killing the Lakers. Hopefully, my dreams come true.” Chandler’s first basketball memories were watching the Showtime Lakers, who won five titles during the ’80s. He was in high school when the next Lakers dynasty, featuring Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant, emerged.\n\n“Toughness doesn’t always mean throwing a punch back,” Chandler said. “It means getting up and going at ‘em even tougher. … Dirk got up. Instead of getting in some dumb altercation, he said, ‘All right, I’m going to punish you.’ ” The Lakers aren’t the Blazers. The Mavs can nearly match L.A.’s length, but not its strength and physicality. From Pau Gasol to Andrew Bynum to Ron Artest to Lamar Odom, the Lakers can rotate a series of big bodies on Nowitzki. In their last meeting of the regular season, the Lakers bullied the Mavs until they came unhinged. By the end of the game, five players had been ejected. “We can’t lose our composure like we did the last time there,” Nowitzki said."
