        "text": "NBA Comparison: Rasheed Wallace\n\nStrengths: 7 footers with his athleticism come around every 10-20 years. Has good desire, and intelligence. Good shot blocker. Has good passing ability. Can shoot the ball well, and runs the floor like a deer. Has a chance to be a special special player in a few years.\n\nWeaknesses: Strength, maturity. Will never have the strength of a Shaq or Eddy Curry. Initially, at just 225 pounds and an underdeveloped body, he will be forced to play away from the basket. Wants to be like Kevin Garnett and play on the perimeter, but has very underdeveloped ball skills. Doesnâ€™t always display maximum effort. A jump straight to the pros looks likely, his body and mind are not ready for a 40 game season much less an 82 game one.\n\nStats:"
