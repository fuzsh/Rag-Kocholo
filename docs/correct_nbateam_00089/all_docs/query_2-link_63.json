        "text": "NEW YORK -- Dallas Mavericks center Tyson Chandler feels sorry for former New York Knicks teammate Carmelo Anthony, the face of a team that fell to 5-22 with Tuesday's 107-87 loss to the Mavs.\n\n\"I do because he's a competitor,\" said Chandler, who received a warm ovation from the crowd in his return to Madison Square Garden and had eight points and 14 rebounds in the win. \"I laced them up and went to battle with him for the last three years and know what kind of competitor he is.\n\n\"I know he wants to win, and I know he's going to take a lot of this heat. And it's unfortunate because he's a hell of a player in our league. It's just unfortunate.\"\n\nAnthony, who encouraged fans not to boo Chandler, returned to New York this summer, signing a five-year, $124 million contract after a free agency tour that included visits with the Chicago Bulls, Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers and Mavs.\n\nAnthony cited a desire to win in New York, which last won an NBA championship in 1973, as the primary reason for his decision to re-sign with the Knicks.\n\nHowever, the Knicks have gotten off to a horrible start under new coach Derek Fisher despite Anthony averaging 23.4 points per game.\n\n\"He signed a contract to come back here with expectations of doing everything in his power to take this team to the next level,\" Chandler said. \"I ultimately feel like it will with the right pieces. They have to get luck with some things in free agency or get a high draft pick or whatever the case may be, but it takes a while to change the culture.\n\n\"You bring in a new coach and you bring in a new offense and a new identity. As long as players and everybody here understands that it's a process, it'll be all right. The moment it gets tough is when you're losing. Losing makes things difficult.\""
