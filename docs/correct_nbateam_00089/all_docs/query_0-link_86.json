        "text": "\"I’m not jumping ship\", the rumbling big man, Tyson Chandler, said on January 31st, following a loss to the Mavericks in Dallas. Despite Chandler’s 12-point, 13-rebound double double, the Suns put up only 78 points, failing to capitalize on a Dirk-less night for the Mavs. Archie Goodwin shot 1-11, Markieff Morris spent the game attempting to up his own trade value, and the backcourt let Deron Williams score nearly 30 points. Not great, if victory is the goal.\n\nIf giving time to the young players and developing the core is the goal, though? Not so bad. The team started Goodwin and the Hotline-Blinging, Summer League-chucking, U-20 champion of the world Devin Booker in the backcourt. Alex Len and Jordan McCrae got double digit minutes off the bench. They still resembled an NBA squad for the majority of the minutes. A main reason for this was the presence of Tyson Chandler.\n\nBrought in amidst the blazing emojis of 2015 free agency, Chandler appeared to be a nice fit on an younger team, with or without LaMarcus Aldridge in tow. Communication is an obviously valuable way to improve the team defense of young players, and that’s where Chandler has made a living in this league. Throw in some tip-back offensive rebounds and a nice pick and roll game to support the two B-level combo guards, and it was easy to understand the logic behind the deal.\n\nThe money and length weren’t (and still sort of aren’t) great, but the deals given out this summer sort of work to contextualize the money boom that the agents and front offices around the NBA saw coming last summer. However, it’s very likely that while things appeared rosy from the Suns’ point of view, Tyson Chandler saw himself heading toward a completely different situation than the one the team cascaded into around him this year.\n\nEric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight got bitten by the injury bug (again), Jeff Hornacek got fired, and many of the role players failed to stick for prolonged stretches. Markieff Morris threw himself a pity party or two, yet got the team a first for their patience. Sonny Weems saw more bench than he anticipated in coming back from a successful stint overseas. T.J. Warren had a troubling season that stunted his growth to an unknown extent. The reserve power forwards traded roles throughout an up and down season.\n\nEven despite a studly rocket ship ride to the verge of stardom (too soon?) for Devin Booker and a promising season from Alex Len, 2016 marked the second consecutive year of regression for the Suns. In nearly every language, these truths spell R-E-B-U-I-L-D. And there is no place for a veteran in a from-scratch construction project.\n\nOn June 6th, the big man quoth \"If this organization wants to lose, this is not the place for me\", on ESPN’s basketball program The Jump. Now, there is a clear difference between rebuilding and trying to lose, as has been made permanently clear by the self-endowed tribulations of the Philadelphia 76ers and other tankers throughout the league’s history.\n\nBy extending Earl Watson from interim to permanent head coach, flipping assets for the opportunity to draft two gifted bigs, and keeping both Kentucky combo artists up to this point, the Phoenix Suns have made it clear that they have no interest in scuttling toward their own version of any sort of Process. The focus is on the development of a form-fitting young core, with nice players at every spot on the roster. Somewhere in this roster, there is a playoff contender. Closer to the surface, there is the potential for several more ping-pong balls next June.\n\nWhere does Mr. Chandler fit into all of this? The answer to that question is entirely according to his own priorities.\n\nThere’s a path presenting itself to him wherein he plays the role of educateurs like Kevin Garnett or Juwan Howard before him, and the Suns organization has given him 52 million reasons to do so. Considering that he has given the all-clear for a trade demand, this path appears the most likely for at least one more season. You don’t sign with a team purely on the whim that they land a heavily-coveted superstar. Chandler saw something he liked in Phoenix last year, and the core of that something is still around.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s another path. Remember, Tyson is entering his sixteenth NBA season after coming to the league out of high school in the early aughts. He paired with Chris Paul early on to fly high and break some oop records, but that New Orleans team never broke through. He went on to win one ring with the Mavericks before being waved to at the door on his way out of Dallas, and then was the 2012 Defensive Player of the Year with a Knicks team that underachieved and fit together poorly. You wouldn’t blame Chandler for having an unquenched thirst; the Suns are probably not his Gatorade.\n\nIf the team plows on toward an all-out rebuild, trading the guards and giving all the time to the youngsters, even 52 million reasons might be too few. We’d all like to think that aging players who have at least one \"Z\" after the word \"Ring\" in their career-defining hashtag immediately look to teach more and fade into the background. Mike Miller just re-upped with Denver for two years on a small deal with that goal likely at the core of his decision.\n\nYet not all great minds think alike. The 33-year old Tyson Chandler has a sizable decision to make, and while the negative end of that decision could rear its head in quite ugly ways, it’s the price of doing business when you wheel and deal like Ryan McDonough and his staff do. In many ways, Tyson Chandler is their gift and curse, and his decision ultimately falls on them. They still have control of this team’s trajectory via the coach’s ear, the players’ wallets, and other executives’ phones.\n\nTo be staring straight into an unglamorous, unsure situation like this one merely one year after transplanting to the Valley is an unfortunate circumstance for one of the league’s most upstanding vets."
