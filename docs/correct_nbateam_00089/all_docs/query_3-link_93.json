        "text": "The Phoenix Suns have reached terms on a contract with veteran center Tyson Chandler on a four-year deal worth $52 million, according to league sources.\n\nSources told ESPN.com that Phoenix has committed all of its available salary-cap space to sign Chandler away from the Dallas Mavericks and pair him with guards Brandon Knight and Eric Bledsoe as the Suns' new cornerstones.\n\nThe Suns also reached terms Wednesday on a five-year, $70 million deal to re-sign Knight. The contracts with Chandler and Knight can't be officially signed until July 9, when a leaguewide moratorium on roster business is lifted.\n\nYahoo! Sports reported Wednesday that the Suns came to terms with Chandler quickly enough to be able to bring him into their scheduled afternoon recruiting meeting with Portland Trail Blazers free agent LaMarcus Aldridge, who is in the midst of meeting with seven different teams as he plots his expected departure from the Pacific Northwest.\n\nChandler's departure heaps the pressure on the Mavericks and the Los Angeles Clippers in their battle for the services of fellow free-agent center DeAndre Jordan. The team that misses out on Jordan will now no longer be able to turn to Chandler as a fallback, as both had been hoping."
