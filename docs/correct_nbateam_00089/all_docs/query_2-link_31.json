        "text": "LAS VEGAS — After being selected 12th overall in the 2023 NBA Draft, Dallas Mavericks rookie Dereck Lively II has been working on his game. At first, he was doing so at the Mavs' training facility in 1-on-0 workouts assisted by former NBA big man Tyson Chandler. Now, Lively is applying what he's learned in Summer League action, while Chandler is still present to assist in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I want him to be better than me, to be honest,\" Chandler said of Lively. \"I'm trying to teach him things that I learned later and during the course of my career. Trying to shorten his learning curve, but I see a lot of great things. I love his attitude. He's willing to learn. He comes in with a great spirit every day, works really hard, and is a really good teammate.\"\n\nLively has received frequent comparisons to Chandler, whether from draft experts, or from members of the Mavs organization. Chandler sees the similarities and that has motivated him to be hands on, assisting in Lively's development.\n\n\"I'm looking at myself all over again,\" Chandler said. \"It's crazy, to be honest. Like, it actually sparks energy within like seeing him and remembering where I was at that time. He has everything in front of him right now.\"\n\nChandler views Lively as not only having significant untapped potential, but even being capable of exceeding the expectations the organization holds for him. Right now, he's already making an impact using instinct and natural talent, but when he begins to expand on the nuances of the game, there's more to be achieved.\n\n\"I think he could do that and more, to be honest,\" Chandler said. \"He has so much untapped potential and he's just out there playing like off of instinct and ability. He has a lot to learn, but he has all the tools and attributes that you would need to get to that point.\"\n\nIn terms of focus areas, Chandler has worked with Lively on a lot of \"little things\" that add up throughout the course of a game. Some of the examples include the way that Lively is running the floor, closing out, and rim rolling in addition to more advanced technical elements of the game.\n\n\"Little things like the way he's running the floor, the way he's closing out, pick-and-rolls — there are a lot of little technical things. The thing that I love is he's really taking information and trying to apply it out there. Right now, it's just about trying everything and as we go along, he'll be able to tighten up all the things that he's learning right now.\"\n\nAmong Lively's attributes that impresses Chandler is how vocal the young big man is, particularly as the anchor of the defense. The Mavs have increasingly utilized Veer switching, which is very dependent on the big defender in pick-and-roll actions making a quick judgement call. Lively's communication has helped.\n\n\"Young players don't talk. It's hard to get young players to talk out there and he's doing a great job of being vocal,\" Chandler said. \"A lot of young players don't want to make a mistake. They don't want to say the wrong thing, so they just stay quiet. He's out there taking risks and, being vocal, which is a great sign to start.\"\n\nWhile a 19-year-old big man will naturally have a long list of areas to improve throughout their time in the NBA, Chandler is confident in what Lively can achieve. A significant factor is the effort Lively brings when the two are working together.\n\n\"He needs work, but the effort and intention is there,\" Chandler said. \"But, of course, the details need to be worked on. He has a good natural touch. And there's like, again, a lot of things that we're just going to need to work on. Everything, to be honest, like there's nothing that we don't need to work on.\"\n\nJared Dudley, who has been coaching the Mavs' Summer League team, appreciated the unique perspective that a former elite defensive big man can share with Lively as the team works to develop his game.\n\n\"We're more than fortunate to have someone like Tyson here,\" Dudley said.\n\nDudley shared some of the specific ways he's seen Chandler make an impact on Lively's development during the short time they've been together. The attention to detail has been high as Lively continues to hone into the details that go into being an impactful rim protector and rim roller.\n\n\"You see him stopping drills of how he chops his feet on pick-and-rolls instead of flowing into it,\" Dudley said. \"How to get out for lobs when you're in the left side, the right side, timing of when you're supposed to tag and when you're supposed to look in a certain way while he was in such a good weak side shot blocker is over a win. You tag on the left side compared to the right side.\"\n\nDudley explained: “Those are some things I can't even teach him. That's from the defensive player of the year — that's someone like Tyson. That's why we give Tyson the freedom to come and go however he wants, because he's so elite for us to have on staff.\"\n\nWith Lively being limited to just one practice before making his Summer League debut due to the draft night trade not being finalized until June 6, he named Chandler unprompted as being a \"big help\" in the process of getting acclimated.\n\n\"A big help is Tyson Chandler,\" Lively said. \"Being able to have someone in that position where I'm at. Being able to have somebody who's a big, who's seven foot, who knows the nitty gritty, who knows the details, is amazing to have. I'm picking his brain. When we're on the court, when we're off the court, when I'm on the bench, when I'm on the court, and when I'm not playing basketball.\"\n\nIn terms of some specifics, Lively has learned tips on footwork when setting screens, approach on rim rolls, and decision-making as a rim protector among others. Overall, having access to someone uniquely qualified and willing to share and work through the development process is something that Lively is appreciative of.\n\n\"Footwork on screens, timing, when to roll, when not to roll, when to blow somebody up, when to duck in,'\" Lively said. \"There are just so many things that I have been able to pick his brain about that. I'm just so grateful to have that.\"\n\nA significant factor in the Mavs' future success hinges on how Lively can leverage his natural talent and instincts into impact on the court. After ranking 25th in defensive rating and 30th in total rebounding percentage, the sooner Lively can step in and contribute, the better it'll be for Dallas.\n\nFor now, a pivotal contributor to the franchise's most iconic achievement — the 2011 NBA championship — is helping to ensure that Lively's full potential is reached.\n\nGrant Afseth is a Dallas Mavericks reporter for DallasBasketball.com and an NBA reporter for NBA Analysis Network.
