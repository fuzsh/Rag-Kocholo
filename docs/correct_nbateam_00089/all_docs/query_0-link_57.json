        "text": "Hey, remember that defunct professional basketball league we once called the “NBA?” Once upon a time, they had a playoffs and a Finals in which a champion was crowned. During the last season before the league disappeared, a team called the Dallas Mavericks beat another team called the Miami Heat to win the NBA’s last title.\n\nOn today’s BS Report, Dallas’ starting center from that long-lost championship team, Tyson Chandler, joined me to discuss his summer in exile, his career-transforming experience playing for Team USA, which Team USA player surprised him the most, whether he thought Dirk was soft before he became a Mav, when he knew they could beat the Lakers and Heat, what the turning point of the 2011 Finals was, his memories of the 24 hours after they won the title, whether NBA players will still united during the lockout, why Eddy Curry’s career never panned out and why nobody appreciates big guys in pickup games.\n\nYou can find Thursday’s podcast here:\n\nESPN.com Podcenter\n\nOn iTunes\n\nBS Report page\n\nBill Simmons is the Editor in Chief of Grantland, the host of the BS Report and the author of the recent New York Times no. 1 best-seller The Book of Basketball.
