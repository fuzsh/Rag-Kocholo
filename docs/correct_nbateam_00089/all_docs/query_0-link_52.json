        "text": "Not too many seemed particularly sad to see Tyson Chandler’s time with the Knicks end.\n\nHe was far from a bust, but further from the missing piece to a championship some viewed him as when he signed a four-year, $55 million deal in 2011.\n\nIn Dallas, he could be that piece once again.\n\nChandler is getting rave reviews since returning to the Mavericks in an offseason trade with the Knicks. He is anchoring the middle on defense, is averaging a double-double and seems healthier than he did at any point during his three years with the Knicks.\n\n“I was actually surprised how good he looked when he got here,” Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki told the Dallas Morning News.\n\n“He was fighting a little injury bug in New York. But he said he put in a lot of work over the summer, and he looks as explosive as ever. I love what he’s doing.”\n\nPrior to his return, Chandler had only spent one season with the Mavericks. That happened to be the 2010-11 title team that took down the Heat in LeBron James’ first year on South Beach.\n\n“I think it’s great that he’s back,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle told the Dallas Morning News recently. “He’s one of the most popular one-year players in the history of any franchise. A couple of speaking engagements, I just got up and first thing I said was, ‘Tyson Chandler is back with the Mavericks.’ And everybody stands up and goes crazy.”\n\nThe Mavericks had eyes on following the Heat’s path and going after a superstar, such as the Nets’ Deron Williams, to pair with Nowitzki so they agreed to a sign-and-trade that sent Chandler to the Knicks.\n\nDallas didn’t find any superstars and have two first-round playoff defeats in the three years since Chandler left. Now they have surrounded Nowitzki with a solid rotation that includes Monta Ellis and Chandler Parsons.\n\n“He’s the kind of guy you can’t help but love to watch because of his approach [and] his enthusiasm,” Carlisle said. “He’s a winner.”\n\nChandler isn’t thought of so fondly in New York. No names have been specified, but the current Knicks have made a point of mentioning the bad energy that infiltrated last season’s 37-win squad.\n\nPhil Jackson said a lack of chemistry precipitated the trade that sent Chandler and Raymond Felton to the Mavericks for Jose Calderon, Wayne Ellington, Shane Larkin and Samuel Dalembert. It was a comment that infuriated Chandler.\n\nBut Jackson’s first significant move as Knicks president was championed by most as a salary cap-saving steal.\n\nSo far, it’s Chandler and the Mavericks who are reaping the benefits.\n\n“To be back with somebody who understands me and understands how I can succeed out there and puts me in positions to succeed is great,” Chandler said before the season of Carlisle.\n\n“You have to have a winning culture, and coach Carlisle knows how to do that. That’s what I’m most excited about.”"
