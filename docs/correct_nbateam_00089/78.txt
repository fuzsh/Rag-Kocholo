For those NBA teams that miss out on signing center Nene, there might be a nice prize still waiting for teams to make a run at. Center Tyson Chandler expects that he will move on from the Dallas Mavericks and be with a new team once training camp begins, reports ESPN's Chris Broussard and Marc Stein. As Chandler remarked:

"I really think I'm going to be on a new team come training camp," Chandler told ESPN.com in a telephone interview Wednesday night. "I'm really taking a hard look at all of my options, trying to see what best suits me."

It had widely been expected that Chandler would re-sign with the Mavericks, but it appears that the Mavericks have other priorities than signing the big man to a long-term deal.

After being acquired in a 2010 trade, Chandler played just one season with the Mavericks. In 74 games, he averaged 10.1 points, 9.4 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 74 games. He finished third in the 2010-2011 NBA Defensive Player of the Year voting, behind Dwight Howard and Kevin Garnett.
