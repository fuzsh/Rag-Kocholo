The Dallas Mavericks are bringing back Tyson Chandler, the starting center from their 2011 championship team. The Mavericks are working out a deal for Chandler that would send Samuel Dalembert, Jose Calderon and Shane Larkin to the New York Knicks, according to ESPN's Marc Stein.

The Mavericks would also take point guard Raymond Felton, who has about $7.7 million left on the last two years of his contract, which includes a player option. New York gets picks No. 34 and No. 51 in Thursday's draft, according to a report. The Knicks also receive reserve guard Wayne Ellington and a second-round draft pick as part of the deal.

Chandler left the Mavericks following their 2011 NBA Finals victory over the Heat for a four-year, $55 million contract from the Knicks. The Mavericks hoped to use the cap space created by the departure of Chandler to sign Deron Williams or Dwight Howard in subsequent offseasons, but Mark Cuban was never able to reel in his proverbial big fish.

While the deal isn't official just yet, the decision to trade Chandler would be one that saves the Knicks money. New York plans to attract a major free agent or two in the summer of 2015, and getting out of Felton's player option for the 2015-16 season will open up money. Dalembert's contract for the 2014-15 season is only partially guaranteed, with the Knicks on the hook for $1.8 million of his $3.8 million salary if he's waived. Larkin represents a short but athletic young point who could give the Knicks a badly needed jolt in the backcourt.

Chandler has one year and $14.5 million left on his deal. He was limited to 55 games last season after suffering a fractured right leg in November. Chandler turns 32 in October, but can still be an effective rim protector. Dallas' interior defense struggled last season. The Mavericks were No. 22 in points allowed per 100 possessions.
