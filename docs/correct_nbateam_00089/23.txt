Tyson Chandler seems to be a rather stoic player on the court, or at least not the type of player typically involved in headlines, but the Dallas Mavericks big man took a few jabs at the Miami Heat during Thursday's championship parade.

Chandler was introduced at the parade as the "best center in Mavericks history," to which he replied humbly by saying that he's just glad to be a champion, before going in on the Heat's "Big Three" celebration when LeBron James decided to team with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.

"There were two celebrations at the same time," Chandler said. "When the Miami Heat signed their free agents and when I got traded here because I was in the gym by myself celebrating."

A little while later in the question and answer segment, Chandler brought up the point in the aforementioned celebration when James predicted the Heat wouldn't win just one championship by saying the Heat would win not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, not seven titles.

When Chandler was asked if the team might repeat, he replied appropriately.

"I hear they do things big in Dallas," Chandler said. "So if we do it big, it can't just be one ... two, three, four, five ..."

Video of the interview, along with Jason Terry has already been uploaded to Youtube.
