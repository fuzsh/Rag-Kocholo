        "text": "1. RELIGION\n\n2.  Religion in the Philippines is marked by a majority of people being of the Christian faith (~90%), which include Catholics, Iglesia ni Cristo, Aglipayans, Protestants. There are also a significant minority of Muslims (5%), as well as Buddhists, Hindus, Agnostics and Animists. It is central not as an abstract belief system, but rather as a host of experiences —rituals and adjurations that provide continuity in life, communal cohesion and moral purpose for existence.\n\n3. ANCIENT INDIGENOUS BELIEFS  During pre-colonial times, a form of animism was widely practiced in the Philippines. Today, the Philippines is mostly Catholic and Christian, and only a handful of the indigenous tribes continue to practice the old traditions. These are a collection of beliefs and cultural mores anchored more or less in the idea that the world is inhabited by spirits and supernatural entities, both good and bad, and that respect be accorded to them through nature worship. These spirits all around nature are known as \"diwatas\", showing cultural relationship with Hinduism (Devatas).\n\n4.  Some worship specific deities, such as the Tagalog supreme deity, Bathala, and his children Adlaw, Mayari, and Tala, or the Visayan deity Kan-Laon; while others practice Ancestor worship (anitos). Variations of animistic practices occur in different ethnic groups. Magic, chants and prayers are often key features. Its practitioners were highly respected (and some feared) in the community, as they were healers, midwives (hilot), shamans, witches and warlocks (mangkukulam), priests/priestesses (babaylan/katalonan), tribal historians and wizened elders that provided the spiritual and traditional life of the community. In the Visayan regions, shamanistic and animistic beliefs in witchcraft (barang) and mythical creatures like aswang (vampires), duwende (dwarves), and bakonawa (a gigantic sea serpent), may exist in some indigenous peoples alongside more mainstream Christian and Islamic faiths.\n\n5. CHRISTIANITY  Christianity arrived in the Philippines with the landing of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. In the late 16th century, the archipelago was claimed for Spain and named it after its king. Missionary activity during the country's colonial rule by Spain and the United States led the transformation of the Philippines into the first and then, along with East Timor, one of two predominantly Christian nations in East Asia, with approximately 92.5% of the population belonging to the Christian faith.[8][9]\n\n6. CATHOLICISM  Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion and the largest Christian denomination, with estimates of approximately 80% of the population belonging to this faith in the Philippines.[8] The country has a significant Spanish Catholic tradition, and Spanish style Catholicism is embedded in the culture, which was acquired from priests or friars. This is shown in traditions such as Misa de Gallo, Black Nazarene procession, Santo Niño Festivals (Santo Niño de Cebu, Ati-Atihan and others) and Aguinaldo procession, where large crowds gather, honouring their patron saint or saints. Processions and fiestas are conducted during feast days of the patron saints of various barrios or barangays.\n\n7. IGLESIA NI CRISTO  Iglesia ni Cristo (English: Church of Christ; Spanish: Iglesia de Cristo) is the largest entirely indigenous-initiated religious organisation in the Philippines.[Felix Y. Manalo officially registered the church with the Philippine Government on July 27, 1914[16] and because of this, most publications refer to him as the founder of the church. Felix Manalo claimed that he was restoring the church of Christ that was lost for 2,000 years. He died on April 12, 1963, aged 76.\n\n8.  The Iglesia ni Cristo is widely regarded as very influential due to their ability to deliver votes through block voting during elections which is unique to the church due to their doctrine on unity and a practice that cannot be found outside INC. The primary purpose of the Church is to worship the almighty God based on his teachings as taught by Jesus Christ and as recorded in the bible. The church’s major activities include worship service, missionary works, and edification.\n\n9.  According to the March 2012 issue of PASUGO Magazine (p. 24), the Demographics of the Iglesia ni Cristo then was composed of 112 countries and 7 territories comprising 120 races. The majority of INC members are Filipino ex- Catholics, while most non-Filipino members converted prior to marrying Iglesia ni Cristo people.[21] The earliest non-Filipino converts were American soldiers stationed in the Philippines.\n\n10. JESUS MIRACLE CRUSADE INTERNATIONAL MINISTRY  The Jesus Miracle Crusade International Ministry (acronym as JMCIM) is an Apostolic Pentecostal religious group from the Philippines which believes particularly in the promotion of miracles and faith in God for healing. JMCIM is founded by Evangelist Wilde E. Almeda in February 14, 1975.\n\n11.  The JMCIM Apostolic doctrine believes in three manifestations in one GOD: as God the Father in creation, as Son of God in redemption, and as Spirit of God in regeneration. They also adhere to the Pentecostal formulation of baptism, whereby believers are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, commonly referred to as Jesus-name baptism, rather than using the Trinitarian formula, and promote Pentecostal standards of Holiness in conversation, appearance, and way of thinking.[1] The church also follows the Pentecostal worship practices of spending many hours in worship and singing praises to God.\n\n12. MEMBERS CHURCH OF GOD INTERNATIONAL  Members Church of God International is a nontrinitarian religious organization colloquially known through its television program, Ang Dating Daan (English for the \"The Old Path\"). This group is an offshoot of Nicholas Perez's Iglesia ng Diyos kay Kristo Hesus Haligi at Suhay ng Katotohanan (Church of God in Christ Jesus, Pillar and Support of the Truth). The church does not claim to be part of the restorationist movement but shows characteristics of such. They accept the divinity of Christ but reject the doctrine of Trinity. They also reject various doctrines fundamental for mainstream Christianity and more notably, the Roman Catholic Church. Thousands of local chapters are scattered throughout the Philippines and abroad because of increasing number of membership through mass baptisms.[17]\n\n13.  The church is known for their \"Bible Expositions\", where guests and members are given a chance to ask any biblical question to the Presiding Minister of the church, Eliseo Soriano directly from the Bible. Since 2005, Eliseo Soriano went outside the Philippines to host Bible Expositions around the world.[18]  The Church has growing congregations in South America, particularly Brazil. Ang Dating Daan now airs in 73 countries worldwide including United States, Latin America, Papua New Guinea, Portugal (as \"O Caminho Antigo\"), Spain (as \"El Camino Antiguo\"), India, South Africa, Saipan and Canada.\n\n14. PROTESTANTISM  Protestantism arrived in the Philippines with the coming of the Americans at the turn of the 20th century. In 1898, Spain lost the Philippines to the United States. After a bitter fight for independence against its new occupiers, Filipinos surrendered and were again colonized. The arrival of Protestant American missionaries soon followed. Protestant church organizations established in the Philippines during the 20th century include the following:\n\n15.  Association of Fundamental Baptist Churches in the Philippines  Baptist Bible Fellowship in the Philippines (Baptist)  Bread of Life Ministries International (Evangelical)  Cathedral of Praise (Pentecostal)  Christ's Commission Fellowship (Evangelical)  Christ Living Epistle Ministries Inc. (Full Gospel/Pentecostal).  Christian and Missionary Alliance Churches of the Philippines  Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)  Church of the Foursquare Gospel in the Philippines (Full Gospel/Pentecostal)\n\n16.  Jesus Miracle Crusade International Ministry Full Gospel  Church of the Nazarene (Holiness movement)  Citichurch Cebu (Pentecostal)  Conservative Baptist Association of the Philippines (Baptist)  Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches (Baptist)  Day by Day Christian Ministries (Evangelical)  Episcopal Church in the Philippines (Anglican)  Every Nation Churches and Ministries (Pentecostal)  Greenhills Christian Fellowship (Conservative Baptist)  Heartland Covenant Church (formerly Jesus Cares Ministries)  Iglesia Evangelica Metodista en las Islas Filipinas  Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Cristo\n\n17.  Jesus Is Lord Church (Pentecostal)  Jesus the Anointed One Church (Pentecostal)  Lutheran Church in the Philippines (Lutheran)  Luzon Convention of Southern Baptists (Baptist)  Mindanao and Visayas Convention of Southern Baptists (Baptist)  New Life Christian Center (Pentecostal)  Pentecostal Missionary Church of Christ (4th Watch)  Philippine Evangelical Holiness Churches  Philippines General Council of the Assemblies of God  Presbyterian Church of the Philippines\n\n18.  Redeeming Grace Christian Centre  Tabernacle of Faith International Church  TEAM Ministries international  The Blessed Word International Church (Evangelical)  The United Methodist Church (Methodist)  Union Church Manila  Union Espiritista Cristiana de Filipinas  United Church of Christ in the Philippines (Congregationalist, Presbyterian, Disciples, United Brethren, Methodist).  United Evangelical Church of the Philippines\n\n19.  Victory Christian Fellowship (Evangelical)  Word for the World Christian Fellowship (Evangelical)  Word of Life World Mission Church (Pentecostal)  His Life City Church (Pentecostal)\n\n20. LATTER DAY SAINTS  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the Philippines was founded during the Spanish-American War in 1898. Two men from Utah who were members of the United States artillery battery, and who were also set apart as missionaries by the Church before they left the United States, preached while stationed in the Philippines. Missionary work picked up after World War II, and in 1961 the Church was officially registered in the Philippines.[24] In 1969, the Church had spread to eight major islands and had the highest number of baptisms of any area in the Church. A temple was built in 1984 which located in Quezon City and another in Cebu City, completed in 2010. The Manila Missionary Training Center was established in 1983. Membership in 1984 was 76,000 and 237,000 in 1990.[citation needed] Membership was 675,000 in 2013.[25]\n\n21. ISLAM  The Muslim population of the Philippines is estimated at between 5% to 9%,according to 2010 year report by International Religious Freedom Report,2010 . Islam is the oldest recorded monotheistic religion in the Philippines. Islam reached the Philippines in the 14th century with the arrival of Muslim traders from the Persian Gulf, Southern India, and their followers from several sultanate governments in Maritime Southeast Asia. Islam's predominance reached all the way to the shores of Manila Bay, home to several Muslim kingdoms. During the Spanish conquest, Islam reached a rapid decline as the predominant monotheistic faith in the Philippines as a result of the introducing of Roman Catholicism by Spanish missionaries. Only the southern Filipino tribes resisted Spanish rule and conversions to Roman Catholicism.\n\n22. JUDAISM  Even since the 1590s some Jews fleeing from The Inquisition were recorded to have come to the Philippines. As of 2005, Filipino Jews number at the very most 500 people. As of 2011, Metro Manila boasts the largest Jewish community in the Philippines, which consists of roughly 100 families.[37]  The country's only synagogue, Beth Yaacov, is located in Makati.[37] There are, of course, other Jews elsewhere in the country,[37] but these are obviously fewer and almost all transients,[38] either diplomats or business envoys, and their existence is almost totally unknown in mainstream society. There are a few Israelis in Manila recruiting caregivers for Israel, some work in call centers, businessmen and a few other executives. A number are converts to Judaism.\n\n23. HINDUISM  Today Hinduism is largely confined to the Indian Filipinos and the expatriate Indian community. Theravada and Vajrayana Buddhism, which are very close to Hinduism, are practiced by Tibetans, Sri Lankan, Burmese and Thai nationals. There are Hindu temples in Manila, as well as in the provinces. There are temples also for Sikhism, sometimes located near Hindu temples. The two Paco temples are well known, comprising a Hindu temple and a Sikh temple.\n\n24.  Hinduism and Vajrayana Buddhism has existed in the Philippines for centuries. A great deal of Philippine mythology is derived from Hindu mythology. Hinduism arrived when the Hindu religion and culture arrived from India by southern Indians to Southeast Asia from the 4th centuries to the 14th century.[39] The Srivijaya Empire and Majapahit Empire on what is now Malaysia and Indonesia, introduced Hinduism and Buddhism to the islands.[40] Statues of Hindu-Buddhist gods have been found in the Philippines.[41]"
