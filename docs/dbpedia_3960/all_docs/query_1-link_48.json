New York: New York University Press, 2022. 385 pp. $38.00 (paper), ISBN 9781479810390.$99.00 (cloth), ISBN 9781479810345.\n\nReviewed by Jethro Calacday (Cambridge University)\n\nPublished on H-Diplo (March, 2024)\n\nCommissioned by Seth Offenbach (Bronx Community College, The City University of New York)\n\nPrintable Version: https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=60063\n\nEdited by esteemed historians of American religion Tisa Wenger and Sylvester A. Johnson, Religion and US Empire: Critical New Histories makes an important and valuable intervention in an oft-studied combination. Containing essays authored by some of the most respected scholars of American religious history, the book’s premise is founded on a particular definition of “empire” as a “differential of power, not geography.” Emancipating empire from orthodox geopolitics, Wenger and Johnson push back against what they call the “saltwater fallacy,” the historiographical opinion that 1898 was the temporal demarcation when the United States became an empire, the year when it annexed the Philippines and extended control over Puerto Rico and Cuba after the Spanish-American War (p. 3). Not so, as the anthology mainly features essays on domestic imperialism, especially exercised upon indigenous peoples in the US mainland. In this sense, Wenger and Johnson critique the prevailing notion of US empire as merely overseas colonialism, with the British colonization of India as the template. The notion concurs with Paul Kramer’s definition of “empire” as an analytic, asking therefore what empire “does” rather than what empire “is.”[1] Coming close to the Heideggerian concept of gestell (enframing), empire-as-analytic enables the examination of different aspects of culture and social life that have come under imperial power.[2] Wenger and Johnson therefore bring religion into this conversation as a “category,” nay rubric, that orders and creates knowledge and hierarchies according to imperial gradations of civilization and culture. Religion is therefore an imperial yardstick that gauges racial purity, civilizational advancement, and intellectual prowess. This consideration departs radically from the historiographical tradition that has argued for the role of religion in empire as simply a means of control perused by missionaries and zealous colonial functionaries.[3] Instead, religion is productively engaged as a meaning-making apparatus deployed by both agents and subjects, advocates and critics, of imperial control. Wenger herself has tested the import of this approach in her Religious Freedom: The Contested History of an American Ideal (2017), which makes use of the Deleuzian concept of “assemblage.”\n\nHistorians of American foreign relations have much to benefit from the deftly argued and theoretically inflected essays in this anthology. Since William A. Williams and the Wisconsin school, American diplomatic history has been reincarnated in a variety of ways but always converging on the conviction that American diplomacy was imperial or, at the very least, had tragic imperial trajectories. It was Andrew Preston who first “bridged the gap” between American foreign relations history and American religion in his Sword of the Spirit, Shield of Faith: Religion in American War and Diplomacy (2012).[4] In Preston’s account, religion served as an intellectual and moral influence upon individual policymakers. American foreign relations were influenced by religion by the very structure of the American nation as ordered according to denominational or religious lines, premised on free choice, significantly persuading how policymakers and constituents responded to external threats. This was an important intervention in American foreign relations history that Wenger and Johnson seem to have overlooked. An engagement with Preston could have made the overall argument of the book richer.\n\nNevertheless, this minor oversight must compel historians of American diplomacy to productively engage the premise of Wenger and Johnson’s anthology. The first would be methodological. Kathleen Holscher’s essay, for example, is a pathbreaking attempt to make use of Catholic ecclesiology, theology, and even canon law as heuristics in explaining the creation of the diocese of Gallup as an “Indian diocese” and as a dumping ground for erring clergymen accused of sex abuse. The approach is fresh, especially in the context of American religious history, which has often lumped Catholicism as just one among other religions in the United States, comparable and equivalent. Not so, as Catholicism for Holscher must be taken on its own terms, the product being a more holistic if not damning explanation of ecclesiastical procedure that makes the priest immune to civil prosecution. To further expand the premise of the essay, Holscher could have engaged with the idea of ecclesiastical immunity (immunitas), the history of which goes all the way to the very beginnings of the church. The inclusion of Catholicism here is a signal gesture for historians of American foreign relations: we still have a great gap in the history of US-Vatican relations. Surely, Peter D’Agostino’s Rome in America: Transnational Catholic Ideology from the Risorgimento to Fascism (2004) and the Jesuit historian Gerald P. Fogarty’s The Vatican and the American Hierarchy from 1870 to 1965 (1982) make the strongest case for taking the Vatican seriously in any history of the Catholic Church in the United States, but a deeply thought-out history of US-Vatican relations must be encouraged, one that truly and productively makes use of primary source documentation in the Vatican, among other repositories. I say this because the Roman Catholic Church (technically and specifically speaking, the Holy See), unlike Protestant churches, has international diplomatic standing. Definitely, Pope Francis’s unprecedented opening of the Vatican archives to the period inclusive of Pius XII’s pontificate (1939–58) is an opportunity that American diplomatic historians should seize. Katherine Moran’s The Imperial Church: Catholic Founding Fathers and United States Empire (2020) of course is an excellent contribution, albeit from the cultural history side, but a history of Catholicism in the US in view of foreign relations, with all the trappings of “formal” diplomacy that takes Catholicism on its own terms, is still lacking.[5] It is in this light that Holscher’s methodological intervention is useful.\n\nTaking “religion” as an analytical rubric is what Wenger does in her essay when she introduces her concept of “settler secularism” for the first time. She describes settler secularism as a “regulatory force” that constructs what kinds of religion are acceptable in the context of the US mainland’s religious pluralism (pp. 42-43). Wenger has innovatively developed this idea by taking the eternal question of religious studies, “What is religion?,” as the core of her inquiry. Through this, she is able to discern the imperial mechanism that animates the conceptualization of Native and non-Christian religions, discriminating what constitutes as “good” religion from “bad” religion. Kathryn Gerbner’s excellent essay on slave rebellion as a mode of imperial warfare that reconceptualizes the very idea of religion is a perfect example that applies this method of inquisition. Religion in these essays is not simply an “influence” but an object of contention that provides and rearranges the scaffolding of empire. On the inverse, Jennifer Graber’s essay makes use of indigenous modes of meaning-making to construct a narrative that takes Native religion on its own terms. For historians of American foreign relations, such is the key to transcending the problem of religion as mere influence. We could, for example, ask how policymakers remade religion as they engaged in diplomacy and what kind of religion was acceptable in that regard? Even for the most orthodox diplomatic historian concerned primarily by the high affairs of state, the method of inquiry that this book offers should not be ignored. If these kinds of questions could be asked “from below,” what is stopping us from asking them “from above”?\n\nThe second aspect worth reflecting on is the anthology’s excavation of a common “imperial” language shared by both agents and subjects of empire that circulates within and beyond the US mainland. An apt example of this is Karine Walther’s essay appropriately titled “The Same Blood as We in America,” which discusses industrial schooling. Tracing the origins of industrial schooling in the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute for Negroes and Indians in Virginia, Walther looks at the Christian discourse of educational and moral uplift through manual labor first tested and mastered among indigenous and Black people in the US. Industrial schooling and its concomitant discourse were then exported by Protestant missionaries to the Philippines, applied to Catholicized lowlanders, as was the case of Jaro Industrial School in Iloilo and Silliman Institute in Dumaguete, and to Moro youth in Muslim Mindanao, as was the case of Bishop Charles H. Brent’s school. Christina Davidson’s contribution meanwhile focuses on Protestantism in the Dominican Republic. A predominantly Catholic nation, the Dominican Republic was initially evangelized by Black Protestant missionaries beginning in the first half of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, this did not stop White missionaries from the United States from casting the Dominican Republic as a tabula rasa for Protestant missions, motivated as they were by racial perspectives on religion. Black Protestantism, in other words, was not Protestant enough for White missionaries.\n\nThe pervasiveness of imperial language arrests even the most innocuous of things, such as the census. In her essay, Sarah Dees demonstrates how the US census made sense of Native populations by describing their “habits” (code for “religion”) and thereby classifying them accordingly in the scheme of taxation. Unable to take Native religion on its own terms, US census takers documented indigenous customs as evidence of civilizational decline. Black Protestants themselves were not immune to the language of empire, as Johnson shows in the case of Liberia, where expatriated Black Americans came into direct conflict with Natives. Of course, White Evangelicals in the contemporary period looked to theological language to describe their affinities toward warfare and weapons of mass destruction, as Jonathan Ebel informs us in his essay, aptly titled “Fire from Heaven.” Even a progressive institution such as Hull House, as Cara Lea Burnidge intriguingly avers, could not escape the ideational mechanisms of empire, even in their seemingly harmless desire to map out the diverse population of an American city. The same paradox is evident in Robert Crane’s oeuvre, as Zarena Grewal and Brennan MacDaniel illustrate, as well as in the analysis of a self-professed decolonial financier’s book, which Lucia Hulsether sharply analyzes. In other words, empire expands, like an omnipresent colossus, through this shared language unwittingly subscribed to even by the most progressive of critics.\n\nEmpire and religion thus converge where race and civility become markers of religious quality and salvation. This, however, did not disillusion Protestants to critique racial injustice, as Heather D. Curtis’s perceptive essay argues. Black Christian polemicists were able to tap into the promise of universalism offered by Christian theology to speak back to the discrimination engendered by Western Christianity. This is not a new insight, as the works of historian Albert J. Raboteau and theologian Willie James Jennings attest.[6] Curtis however stretches the possibility of this insight by showing how “Black spiritual protest” was thought of on a global scale: the lynching of Blacks in America was compared and put into conversation with English colonial violence in Australia, Africa, and India. The Ottoman Empire’s brutality upon Slavic minorities was also deployed on this account. Therefore, although Religion and US Empire argues for empire as a combination of both domestic and overseas colonialism, the above example traces religio-imperial language not simply as a homegrown, exceptional creation but also as a thing that derives inspiration from abroad and circulates globally. As exemplified by the interventions of historians Ian Tyrell, Alfred McCoy, and A. G. Hopkins and the sociologist Julian Go, US history ought not remain tragically parochial.[7]\n\nFurther explorations are signaled by this book; I have mentioned Catholicism above, but the study of Islam needs to be continually encouraged. The works of Patricio N. Abinales, Oliver Charbonneau, and Michael C. Hawkins represent the Philippine contingent.[8] But while they have approached Islam and US empire in the Philippines from political or cultural perspectives, historians of American religious history must engage Islam as religion in subsequent studies. Hulsether’s essay on American religion and capitalism from a historical perspective also needs to be followed up: after all, the poor are also seen as subjects of a capitalist empire.\n\nThis anthology is the opening salvo to how we could rethink the role of religion in American diplomatic history. The gap has been bridged between American foreign relations history and religion; we are now on the other side. Religion and US Empire charts a way forward in what is increasingly becoming an important field of American history.\n\nNotes\n\n[1].
