Other transitions also come along that will significantly impact your time, energy, and your relationship with your spouse. Bill and Pam Farrel help you learn how to handle these transitions and offer ways you can approach them to strengthen your marriage. They offer some tools to help you identify those transitions and come out stronger on the other side! (Part 1 of 2)"
