        "text": "Start early\n\nLearning begins before birth! Now more than ever, the early years are being recognized as the foundation of human development and life-long learning.\n\nAll children should have access to appropriate support right from birth. Save the Children works with relevant service providers to support female and male caregivers and ensure that young children’s needs for good health, optimal nutrition, security and safety, opportunities for early learning, and responsive caregiving are provided from age 0.\n\nSave the Children creates breakthroughs in developing mother tongue books which are developmentally appropriate and culturally sensitive. A Book Development Review Committee (BDRC) for mother tongue languages in Mindanao was established, ensuring an inclusive process comprised of tribal chieftains, community leaders, teachers, parents, and elders. These books cover topics on indigenous games, culture and traditions.\n\nChildren who need the biggest learning boost are not in school\n\nSave the Children works with local government and organizations to establish early learning spaces for young children in the most deprived and marginalized areas in the country. KapitBahay-Aralan (KBA) is an alternative neighborhood-based early learning program for children aged 3-5 years old. It focuses on the development of early literacy, numeracy, self-care, health practices, and socialization. Through KBA, we improve access to quality learning opportunities for children from very poor households in urban settlements or those in far-flung areas.\n\nSave the Children’s alternative delivery mode of education supports out-of-school children aged 6-12 years old in urban and rural contexts, paving the way for learning opportunities and social protection. By employing the whole-of-society approach, the government, community members, civil society organizations, and public and private sector are mobilized to address children’s needs in learning and wellbeing.\n\nStrengthening the families in which children are raised\n\nThrough our parenting program, parents and child carers are empowered to fulfill their roles and responsibilities as champions of children’s rights, and to create a nurturing environment towards the attainment of children’s holistic development and potential. We capacitate them to call for policies and programs, and use services that respond to the various interests and needs of children in every stage of development.\n\nUninterrupted learning\n\nEmergencies can seriously disrupt a child's education.\n\nIn emergency situations, Save the Children provides safe and protective learning environments for children to learn and play.\n\nWe support the delivery of services such as psychosocial support to ensure uninterrupted learning at all times. We also provide teaching and learning materials such as back-to-school kits, hygiene kits, books, and toys to support children even in times of crisis.\n\nEnsuring ALL children are healthy and well-nourished\n\nSave the Children works to ensure that all children have access to quality health services, safe water and sanitation, and health and nutrition education.\n\nOur health and nutrition programs for school-aged children ensures that basic health services are provided, and that they are able to practice hygiene with safe water and child-friendly sanitation and hygiene facilities. We continuously develop teaching and learning materials with age-appropriate and accurate health and nutrition information, and train teachers on utilizing them.\n\nWe work with both the public and private health sector and with caregivers to ensure that children have sustained access to health facilities and are provided with appropriate care beyond the learning environment setting."
