        "text": "High School Transcript Policy\n\nApplicants may submit a High School Self-Certification Form in lieu of a final official high school transcript in order to enroll in up to 12 credit hours at Liberty University.\n\nApplicants may submit a college transcript showing 12 or more credits from an accredited institution and a High School Self-Certification Form in lieu of high school transcripts.\n\nStudents must submit official high school transcripts, or official college transcripts showing at least 12 credit hours earned with an acceptable grade point average (GPA) from an accredited institution, in order to register for additional courses.\n\nThe official high school transcript, GED requirement, and High School Self-Certification Form can be waived if the applicant has earned an associate degree or higher.\n\nFinal transcripts must reflect all coursework and final grades received for grades 9-12, a graduation date, and an overall GPA. (Mailed transcripts must be in a sealed and unopened envelope.)\n\nUnofficial College Transcript Policy\n\nUnofficial transcripts combined with a Transcript Request Form can be used for admission. Official transcripts are required within 60 days of the admissions decision or before non-attendance drops for the first set of matriculated classes, whichever comes first, and will prevent enrollment into future terms until all official transcripts have been received.\n\nBefore sending unofficial college transcripts, please make sure they include the following:\n\nYour previous school’s name or logo printed on the document\n\nCumulative GPA\n\nA list of completed courses and earned credit broken down by semester\n\nDegree and date conferred (if applicable)\n\nOfficial College Transcript Policy\n\nAn acceptable official college transcript is one that has been issued directly from the institution and is in a sealed envelope. If you have one in your possession, it must meet the same requirements. If your previous institution offers electronic official transcript processing, they can send the document directly to luoverify@liberty.edu.\n\nIf the student uses unofficial transcripts with a Transcript Request Form to gain acceptance, all official transcripts must be received within 60 days of the admissions decision or before non-attendance drops for the first set of matriculated classes, whichever comes first. Failure to send all official transcripts within the 60-day period will prevent enrollment into future terms until all official transcripts have been received.\n\nIf you’re looking for formal training to help you get started as a counselor, an associates degree in counseling can help you gain a strong foundation in the skills you need. But if you want to make counseling your ministry, then you will want to focus your studies on a biblically-based program that can equip you to minister to patients through the love of Christ.\n\nChristian counselors use psychology and communication skills to connect with patients and help them work through complex emotional issues. But Christian counselors also have the toolset of biblical ministry to help them build a relationship with patients and help build their faith. If you want a Christ-centered approach to counseling practice, then Liberty’s associates in Christian counseling can help you get the training you need.\n\nIn most states in the U.S., the title “professional counselor” is a legally protected status requiring state-issued licensure to enter the field. While we recommend that you view licensure counseling as your end goal, an AA degree in counseling can be an efficient way to get started with the intent to continue to a licensure-track counseling program. In the meantime, you will have the skills and knowledge you can apply to the field now so you can get hands-on experience. Working as an unlicensed counselor doesn’t mean that you can’t actively counsel people and provide consultation. It does mean that you will have specific state-by-state restrictions that you must review and take into consideration.\n\nWhile an AA in counseling will not qualify you in most states to apply for professional counseling licensure, you can still have an active and rewarding career helping people heal and grow. While you continue to work toward your bachelor’s degree, you can work in many counseling-related roles such as:\n\nAssistant to human services coordinators\n\nAssistant to social workers\n\nPersonal care aid for children and families with special needs\n\nSupport roles within licensed counseling practices*\n\nIf you want to gain skills to minister to families and build toward a higher-level degree, Liberty University’s Christian counseling associate degree can help prepare you for the next step in your career.\n\n*Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor, at Occupational Outlook Handbook: Social and Human Services Assistants (viewed online August 24, 2020).
