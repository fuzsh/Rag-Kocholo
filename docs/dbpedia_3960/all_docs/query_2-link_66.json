For more than 60 years, the U.S. government, through USAID, has worked with the Philippine government and local organizations to achieve shared development goals. Since 1961, USAID has invested nearly 290 billion pesos to support Philippine development priorities.\n\nAn archipelago of more than 7,500 islands, the Philippines spans three geographical areas â€” Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The United States partners with the Philippines to drive inclusive and sustainable economic growth, foster strong democratic systems, uphold human rights, support quality health and education systems, promote responsible natural resource management, and enhance resilience for communities and the environment.\n\nFocusing on strengthening economic growth, democratic governance, health, education, and environmental resilience, USAID partners with national and local governments, the private sector, civil society organizations, academia, and communities to advance sustainable, inclusive development while advancing the vision of a free and open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific.\n\nLearn More"
