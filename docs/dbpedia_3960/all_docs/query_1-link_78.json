        "text": "When the first American missionaries prepared to leave the shores of New England in 1812, Jonathan Allen, a respected minister of the gospel, delivered an exhortation to the women of the company. Speaking to them directly, he reminded the women that they were “now engaged in the best of causes,” specifically, the delivery of women in foreign lands from oppression. Allen proclaimed the call for American women to “enlighten” the minds of their foreign sisters and to “raise their character.” The American women were to “bring them from their cloisters” so that these subjugated foreign women might “enjoy the privileges of the children of God.” Ultimately, the work of American women in missions would teach women in the non-Western world that “they are not an inferior race of creatures; but stand upon a par with men.”\n\nScholarship on nineteenth-century missionary encounters emphasizes either how native converts “indigenized” Christian doctrine and practice, or how missionaries acted as agents of Western imperial expansion. These approaches, however, overlook the ways both missionaries and converts understood Protestant Christianity as a call to transnational community. This essay examines the ways that American Protestants and East Asian Christian converts looked for ways to build a transpacific communion. Despite radically different understandings of Christian scripture, and despite the geopolitics of empire, U.S. and East Asian Protestants nevertheless strove to bring together diverse theologies and experiences into a loosely defined, transnational Protestant community.\n\nIt is certainly more than a truism to say that Protestant Reformation theology has impacted Christian faith and practice in a myriad of ways, including giving rise to a vibrant Protestant missiology. Yet, what remains relatively unexplored in the context of the Reformation and Christian mission is the impact of Reformation political theology on empire-building; specifically, the connection between Protestant mission and the extension of European political hegemony over distant lands, which began in the early modern period. This study attempts to show first that the Reformation reframing of the relationship between church and state failed to challenge the \" theology of empire \" inherent in Roman Catholicism, and second, that Protestant imperial expansion was equally buttressed by a religious ideology which assumed an equivalence between colonization and the fulfillment of the Great Commission. In the case of Christian expansion into the Americas both before and after the Reformation, the results were disastrous for indigenous peoples and their cultures. This assessment calls for a rethinking of Christianity's historical relationship to empire, its modes of propagation in the modern period, and the nature of its mission in the twenty-first century.\n\nSome Christian historians describe the 19th century as one of the greatest eras of Christian religious expansion. For many Western Christians during this period, the Middle East appeared to be a ripe field for evangelistic harvest. However, the changes initiated by the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution produced a Western imperial impulse, which affected missionary methodology in the Middle East. Protestant missionaries attempted to convert Arab and Kurdish Muslims by proxy. Investing financially and missiologically in the local orthodox communities was believed to be the most effective means for bringing Christianity to Muslim communities. Missionaries attempted to evangelize Muslims by addressing social needs such as failing educational systems and needed medical facilities. However, the “Great Experiment” of reviving Middle Eastern Christian communities ultimately failed. In this paper, I argue that five factors led to this missionary failure: Western ethnocentrism, lack of contextualization, impertinence toward Muslims, and Christian liberal theology."
