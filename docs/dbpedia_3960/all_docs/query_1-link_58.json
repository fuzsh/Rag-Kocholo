        "text": "The Anabaptist movement differed from mainstream Protestantism primarily in its belief in adult baptism and separation from the state.\n\nThe Anabaptist movement, which emerged during the 16th century Reformation, held several beliefs that set it apart from mainstream Protestantism. The most significant of these was the belief in adult baptism, or 'believer's baptism'. Anabaptists rejected the practice of infant baptism, which was common in both Catholic and Protestant churches, arguing that baptism should be a conscious choice made by adults who have come to faith. This was a radical departure from the norm and led to their name 'Anabaptists', meaning 're-baptisers'.\n\nAnother key difference was the Anabaptist view of the relationship between church and state. Unlike mainstream Protestantism, which often sought to reform existing state churches or establish new ones, Anabaptists believed in a complete separation of church and state. They saw the church as a voluntary community of believers, separate from the worldly power of the state. This led them to reject oaths of allegiance, military service, and participation in government, further isolating them from mainstream society.\n\nAnabaptists also differed in their emphasis on living a life of discipleship, following the teachings of Jesus in everyday life. They stressed the importance of communal living, mutual aid, and pacifism, often living in separate communities and refusing to bear arms. This focus on practical Christianity was in contrast to the doctrinal focus of many mainstream Protestant churches.\n\nFinally, the Anabaptist movement was more radical and diverse than mainstream Protestantism. It included a wide range of groups, from pacifist Mennonites to militant Munsterites, and was often associated with social and religious upheaval. This radicalism, combined with their rejection of infant baptism and state power, led to severe persecution of Anabaptists by both Catholic and Protestant authorities.\n\nIn summary, the Anabaptist movement differed from mainstream Protestantism in its belief in adult baptism, separation of church and state, emphasis on discipleship, and radical diversity. These differences led to significant tension and conflict with both Catholic and Protestant authorities, shaping the distinctive identity of the Anabaptist tradition."
