        "text": "Magnet schools are free public elementary and secondary “schools of choice” that operate within existing public schools in a district—unlike private and charter schools, which are completely separate institutions. Magnet schools focus on specific areas of interest, such as performing arts, world languages, and leadership, as well as science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM or STEAM for short) programs.*\n\nThey utilize a hands-on, centralized approach to providing students with a robust learning experience in areas that capitalize on their strengths and interests. Children in magnet programs still learn the basic curricula that regular school programs provide, but those basics are enhanced by the special teaching techniques and more personalized settings of magnet schools.\n\nTypically, students may apply to any magnet school within their district. The programs require special applications.\n\nHistory of Magnet Schools\n\nMagnet schools may be a new idea for some, but the concept actually dates back to the 1970s, when it emerged as a way to racially desegregate public schools and allow for more diversity in classrooms.* The idea was to bring together students from different backgrounds and neighborhoods who shared a common interest and excelled in certain areas, such as science or performing arts.\n\nThis commonality not only helped blur racial differences in the classroom—it fostered academic excellence and shared educational goals. Parents appreciated the opportunity for their children to spend more time exploring their interests and developing their knowledge, in an atmosphere that promotes excellence from students and teachers alike.\n\nTeaching in Magnet Schools†\n\nMagnet schools’ specialized programs and mission of excellence in education depend on additional funding that comes from local, state, and federal sources through grants and donations. As a result, magnet school teachers may enjoy the following benefits:\n\nMagnet schools offer numerous advantages for students and educators alike. If you’re employed but want to pursue or advance your career as a magnet school educator, consider continuing your education with an online degree program.
