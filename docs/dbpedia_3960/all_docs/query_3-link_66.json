        "text": "The Ronald F. Inglehart Best Book Award on Political Culture and Values is awarded for a book which makes a substantial and original contribution to theory and/or empirical studies in comparative cross-cultural research. This prize is awarded every second year and honors the best book published in the previous five years following the tradition established by Ronald F. Inglehart. Results of the 2023 competition have now been announced.\n\nThe Policy Institute at King’s College London, in partnership with the World Values Survey Association, UCL and the Behavioural Insights Team, are pleased to announce a one-day international conference on polarisation. Increasingly, there is real concern about cultural, political and social divides, and their potential implications for how we live well together, both within and across nations. How connected we feel to others, our faith in institutions, the health of democracy, and the personalisation of politics are just some of the issues being addressed by current research. In this conference, we aim to bring together international perspectives to explore how theories of polarisation and their applications in empirical work are evolving in a comparative perspective.\n\nOne of the most significant global events in the last forty years has been the rise of China— economically, technologically, politically, and militarily. The question on people's minds for decades has been whether China will replace the United States as a superpower in the near future. But for China, this power must be comprehensive — having strong economic and militant forces are only two pieces of the puzzle. China must also possess soft power, such as attractive ideologies, values, and culture. China as Number One? explores China's soft powers through the eyes of Chinese citizens. Utilizing data from the World Values Survey, the contributors to this collection analyze the potential soft power of a rising China by examining its residents' social values. A comprehensive study of changes and continuities in the political and social values of Chinese citizens, the book examines findings in the context of evolutionary modernization theory and cross-national comparison.\n\nIn 2022 the WVSA introduced The Ronald F. Inglehart Honorary Lecture to commemorate the memory and scientific legacy of the Founder of the World Values Survey Prof. Ronald F. Inglehart. The 2023 lecture will be read by Prof. Amaney Jamal who will talk on \"The Global Segregation of the Poor\": How economic segregation continues to increase despite the obvious potential threats to capital? Further, why is segregation growing in this historical period? And what are the underlying structural conditions that contribute to these rising levels of economic segregation? Using a variety of data, including night-light satellite-based segregation scores, census data from the US and UK, and public opinion data from the Middle East and the US, Amaney Jamal demonstrates that societies that have a racialized cleavage are more likely to be economically segregated. The lecture will take place on Friday, December 8, 2023 at 9.00 AM EST and will be conducted over Zoom. Attendance is free of charge. Video will be available after the event.\n\nThe World Values Survey Association and the European Values Study signed a cooperation agreement for the next joint survey wave in European countries. Both organizations will aim to carry out the joint EVS/WVS survey in Europe during 2026-2027. The joint EVS/WVS survey will take place as a part of the 8 th wave of the WVS scheduled to take place worldwide in 2024-2026, and the 6 th wave of the EVS scheduled to take place in Europe in 2026-2028.\n\nThe World Values Survey Association is happy to present the next, updated version of the Inglehart-Welzel Cultural Map. The map is based on the latest joint survey round of the World Values Survey and European Values Study 2017-2022. For selected countries, not surveyed recently, data from earlier waves is used to calculate the map score. Overall 111 countries / societies are represented on the map.\n\nThe World Values Survey Association (WVSA) and the European Values Study (EVS) are happy to announce the release of the final version of the joint EVS-WVS 2017-2022 data-set. Fieldwork for this survey round was conducted from early 2017 to mid-2022. The joint data-set covers 90 countries and societies on all inhabited continents around the globe, ranging from Albania, Australia and Argentina to the United States, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. In total, 153 716 respondents were interviewed for this joint EVS-WVS wave.\n\nIn 2022 the WVSA introduced The Ronald F. Inglehart Honorary Lecture to commemorate the memory and scientific legacy of the Founder of the World Values Survey Prof. Ronald F. Inglehart. The 2022 lecture was read by Prof. Russell J. Dalton. The lecture took place on Thursday, December 8, 2022 and was conducted over Zoom. Video and ppt slides are available."
