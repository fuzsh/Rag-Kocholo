        "text": "Promoting good behaviour\n\nAll pupils in a school benefit when behaviour is good. High standards of behaviour are important in helping children to feel safe and learn well, and parents and carers play a key part in this.\n\nThe government advises schools to focus on promoting positive behaviour, helping to build self-discipline and encouraging respect for others. But schools also need sanctions to deter pupils from misbehaving.\n\nSchools should review their discipline/positive behaviour policies regularly and publicise them to parents, staff and pupils. The precise content of a school’s policy is a matter for each school to decide in consultation with parents.\n\nDiscipline/positive behaviour policies should include a code of conduct for pupils. Rules on conduct can apply before and after school, as well as during the school day. They can set expectations for how pupils will behave in corridors, in bus queues and at lunch and break times as well as in the classroom.\n\nSanctions\n\nSchools have a legal right to impose reasonable sanctions if a pupil misbehaves.\n\nSanctions a school might use include:\n\na reprimand\n\na letter to parents or carers\n\nremoval from a class or group\n\nloss of privileges\n\nconfiscating something belonging to your child if it’s inappropriate for school (for example, a mobile phone or music player)\n\ndetention\n\nTeachers can’t punish pupils physically. They can physically restrain them where it’s necessary to stop a pupil injuring him or herself or someone else, damaging property or causing serious disruption.\n\nPupil behaviour and school discipline\n\nYour child and detention\n\nDetentions can take place during school hours, at lunchtime, after school or at weekends. If your child fails to be there without a reasonable excuse, the school may give them a more severe punishment.\n\nYou are entitled to 24 hours’ written notice of a detention that takes place outside normal school hours so you can make arrangements for transport or childcare. The notice should tell you why the detention was given and how long your child will have to stay at school.\n\nIf your child cannot be at the detention, you can explain your reasons to your child’s teacher or headteacher. They may rethink the detention in certain circumstances, such as:\n\nthe detention falls on an important religious day for your family\n\nyou’re concerned about the length and safety of the route between school and home\n\nyou can’t reasonably make alternative arrangements for collecting your child from school\n\nSuspensions\n\nA child who gets into serious trouble at school can be suspended for a fixed period of time. Schools can suspend a child if:\n\nthey have seriously broken school rules\n\nallowing them to stay in school would seriously harm their education or welfare, or the education or welfare of other pupils\n\nSome other points to bear in mind are that:\n\nonly the Principal can suspend a pupil\n\nan initial suspension must not exceed five days\n\nthe Principal cannot extend a period of suspension without the previous approval of the Chair of the Board of Governors\n\nyour child can only be suspended for a maximum of 45 school days in any one school year\n\nyour child’s school is responsible for providing them with suitable work to do and mark it although you may be asked to collect the work from the school and return it when your child has completed it\n\nThe school should call you on the day your child is suspended. The Principal must also provide immediate written notification to you, the Chair of the Board of Governors and the Education Authority (EA) in your region or Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS).\n\nThe letter should set out the period and reason for the suspension.\n\nExpulsions\n\nA school will usually only expel a pupil as a last resort after trying to improve the pupil’s behaviour through other means. However, there are exceptional circumstances in which a school may decide to expel a pupil for a ‘one-off’ offence.\n\nThe decision to expel your child can only be taken by the expelling authority. In the case of controlled schools, this is the EA and, in the case of all other grant-aided schools, it is the Board of Governors of the school.\n\nA decision to expel can only be made after a consultation meeting takes place between the Principal, the Chairperson of the Board of Governors, you, your child, a representative from the EA in your region, or if your child attends a Catholic Maintained School, a representative from CCMS.\n\nThere should be a written record of the meeting and your child’s future education should be part of the discussion.\n\nIf the expelling authority decides to expel your child, they must explain in writing your right to appeal to the Expulsions Appeals Tribunal.\n\nThe EA in your region is required to make arrangements for suitable education for your child until they go to another school."
