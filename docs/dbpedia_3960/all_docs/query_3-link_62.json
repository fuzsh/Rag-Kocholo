        "text": "MEASURES\n\nDependent Variables\n\nWe examine seven dichotomous dependent variables, one for each dimension of liberalization explicated above. Because we are interested in liberalization, each variable is a measure of change from what might be considered a traditional or conservative position to what might be considered a progressive or liberal position. Thus, we restrict our samples to young adults who held traditional positions as adolescents. The first dependent variable measures a change in one’s belief in a personal god. Respondents were asked at both waves whether they believed in God and, subsequently, what their view of God was. On this second question, they could choose from four response categories: “God is a personal being involved in the lives of people today,” “God created the world, but is not involved in the world now,” “God is not personal, but something like a cosmic life force,” or “None of these views.” Respondents who believed in a personal god at both waves are coded 0, and those who believed in a personal god at Wave 1 but something other than a personal god (or did not believe in a god at all) at Wave 3 are coded 1.\n\nOur second dependent variable taps the loss of belief in supernatural occurrences. Respondents were asked at both waves, “Do you believe in the possibility of divine miracles from God?” Those who responded “definitely” at both waves are coded 0; those who responded “definitely” at Wave 1 but “maybe,” “not at all,” or “don’t know” at Wave 3 are coded 1.\n\nAs a measure of uncertainty, we created a variable gauging respondents’ increased doubts in their religion between waves. At both waves, NSYR asked those who considered themselves religious, “In the last year, how much, if at all, have you had doubts about whether your religious beliefs are true? Have you had many doubts, some doubts, a few doubts, or no doubts?” We restrict the sample here to respondents with the opportunity to increase their doubt—those with no, few, or some doubts. Those who reported an equal or lesser amount of doubt between waves are coded 0; those who reported in increase in doubt (e.g., from few to many, from none to few) are coded 1. Those who disaffiliated from their religion between waves were not asked this question at wave 3, and are excluded.\n\nOur fourth dependent variable measures change in reservedness. Respondents were asked, “Is it okay for religious people to try to convert other people to their faith, or should everyone leave everyone else alone?” Those who indicated it is okay to convert others at both waves are coded 0; those who said it was okay at Wave 1 but not at Wave 3 (including those who “don’t know” at Wave 3) are coded 1.\n\nTo gauge change in religious inclusivity, we include a measure of whether the respondent no longer believes only one religion is true, but instead that many religions may be true. At Waves 1 and 3, respondents were asked, “Which of the following statements comes closest to your own views about religion? Only one religion is true, many religions may be true, or there is very little truth in any religion?” Respondents answering at both waves that only one religion is true are coded 0; respondents who at Wave 1 said only one religion was true but at Wave 3 said many could be true are coded 1.\n\nOur sixth dependent variable measures change in religious individualism. At both waves, respondents were asked, “Some people think that it is okay to pick and choose their religious beliefs without having to accept the teachings of their religious faith as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?” Those who disagreed with this at both waves are coded 0; those who disagreed at Wave 1 but agreed at Wave 3 are coded 1.\n\nLastly, our measure of (institutional) religious independence is a measure of increasing identification with the label “spiritual but not religious.” At both waves, NSYR asked, “Some people say that they are ‘spiritual but not religious.’ How true or not would you say that is of you: very true, somewhat true, or not true at all?” Similar to the uncertainty measure, we restrict this sample to those with the opportunity to increase on this measure—those who said at Wave 1 this description is either “not true at all” or “somewhat true” of them. Those who stayed the same on this measure or identified less with it were coded 0; those who increased their identification as “spiritual but not religious” are coded 1.\n\nKey Independent Variable\n\nOur key independent variable is a dichotomous measure of educational attainment. Respondents who had ever attended a four-year college are coded 1; those who had never attended a four-year college are coded 0. Respondents still enrolled in high school are excluded from the analysis.3\n\nKey Mediating Variables\n\nWe include a number of variables that measure the characteristics of respondents’ social networks and their exposure to diversity. We include measures of the respondent’s relational closeness to their mother and father at Wave 3. These variables range in value from “not close at all” (coded 1) to “extremely close” (coded 6). Those who were not in contact with their mother or father were coded 1 and a dummy variable for parent absence was included in the model. We also include a set of dummy variables tapping respondents’ living situation at Wave 3. This variable is a set of four binary variables measuring whether respondents live with their parents (reference group), another person’s home, their own place, or in group quarters. We also include two measures that tap respondents’ religious networks. The first is a measure of peer group religious homophily. NSYR asked respondents to identify up to five close friends other than their parents. They then asked, “How many, if any, of these people are similar to you in their beliefs about religion?” From this information, we created a measure of the percentage of friends who shared religious beliefs. Those who reported zero friends (n=6) are coded as 0. This variable ranges from 0–100. The second measure of religious networks is a measure of the respondents’ Wave 3 religious service attendance. This measure ranges from “never” (coded 0) to “more than once a week” (coded 5). Importantly, we also control for each of these factors at Wave 1 (with the exception of living situation, since almost all lived with parents or other family members). Thus, these mediating variables can be interpreted as changes in social network factors.4\n\nControl Variables\n\nIn addition to the controls for the Wave 1 mediating variables (maternal and paternal closeness, proportion of friends who share religious beliefs, and religious service attendance), we include a number of other sociodemographic and religious controls that may co-vary with educational attainment and religious beliefs. Specifically, we control for Wave 1 gender (female=1), region of residence (South, Northeast, Midwest, West), race, mother’s education, parents’ marital status, self-reported importance of religion, and religious affiliation (following the RELTRAD classification). We also control for Wave 3 age, marital status, and parenthood status. We also include dummy variables tapping mother and father absence at Wave 1. For descriptive statistics of key measures, see Appendix A.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe begin with basic descriptive statistics for liberalizing shifts among the sample. shows that most emerging adults do not experience significant liberalization in their religious beliefs, irrespective of whether they attend college. On most measures, only about 25% to 35% of emerging adults experience liberalizing shifts. Further, there are only slight variations between students and non-students on most measures.5 However, college students do experience increased doubts about religion at a somewhat higher rate (30% versus 22%), while non-students report decreased belief in a personal god (29% versus 23%) and increased opposition to conversion attempts (38% versus 32%) at higher rates.\n\nexamines the impact of college attendance on belief in a personal god. Model 1 reveals that, contrary to conventional wisdom, college students are less likely to stop believing in a personal god than non-students. This difference remains marginally significant even when network variables are accounted for in Model 2. Paternal closeness, living in group quarters, and peer homophily are all negatively associated with the development of unorthodox beliefs about God. In Model 3, however, religious service attendance is strongly negatively associated with the development of liberal conceptions of God, and introducing it appears to completely mediate the effect of college attendance. Religious peer groups, paternal closeness, and group living continue to have significant direct effects in this model.\n\nexamines the impact of college attendance on supernatural beliefs. Model 1 shows that college attendance appears to have no impact on whether an emerging adult stops believing in miracles. The addition of network variables in Model 2 does not change this finding, but it does indicate that paternal and maternal closeness and peer homophily correlate negatively with the development of naturalistic beliefs, while living independently correlates positively. Model 3 demonstrates that religious service attendance is strongly negatively associated with decreased belief in miracles, but that paternal relationship and peer homophily continue to exert a negative influence on belief liberalization. College attendance has no significant effect on belief in miracles in any model.\n\nTable 3\n\nModel 1Model 2Model 3Ever attended four-year college, W3.90.861.04Closeness to mother, W3.84*.87Closeness to father, W3.72***.72**Lives in another person’s home, W3.97.73Lives in own place, W31.68*1.28Lives in group quarters, W31.131.23Percentage of friends who share religious beliefs, W3.99***.99**Religious service attendance, W3.61***Female, W1.93.87.77Lived in Northeast, W11.73*1.73*1.71Lived in Midwest, W11.351.351.53†Lived in West, W11.081.121.28Age, W3.86*.86†.87†Black, W1.41*.45†.48†Hispanic, W11.121.171.53Asian, W1.63.67.59Other/Indeterminable race, W1.81.87.57Mother had college degree, W11.42†1.251.38Parents not broken up, W1.90.901.07Religious service attendance, W1.85**.85**.95Importance of religion, W1.65***.63***.71**Mainline Protestant, W11.82*1.83*1.39Black Protestant, W11.791.932.18Catholic, W11.271.381.20Jewish, W12.352.292.43Mormon, W1.61.721.10No religion, W11.311.381.39Other religion, W12.96†3.08†2.97Ever married, W3.93.811.00Has child living with them, W3.36*.32**.29**Closeness to mother, W1.921.02.99Closeness to father, W11.021.19†1.21†Proportion of friends who share religious beliefs, W11.001.001.00N130813081308\n\nexamines the impact of college attendance on religious doubt. Model 1 shows that college students are significantly more likely to experience increased doubts about religion than are non-students. Model 2 reveals that those with more religiously similar friends are less likely to develop religious doubts, as are those who have closer relationships with their father. These social ties eliminate the significance of college attendance. However, the positive effect of college attendance becomes marginally significant again in Model 3, once religious service attendance is accounted for. College students are more likely to entertain increased doubts than non-attenders, an association that appears to be explained primarily—though not entirely—by social network factors.6\n\nTable 4\n\nModel 1Model 2Model 3Ever attended four-year college, W31.55*1.381.44†Closeness to mother, W31.061.06Closeness to father, W3.78**.78**Lives in another person’s home, W3.67.63Lives in own place, W31.361.26Lives in group quarters, W31.331.32Percentage of friends who share religious beliefs, W3.99***.99***Religious service attendance, W3.89*Female, W1.77.75†.74†Lived in Northeast, W11.53†1.54†1.50Lived in Midwest, W1.93.92.93Lived in West, W11.391.401.43Age, W3.88*.89†.89†Black, W1.54.53.56Hispanic, W11.021.021.07Asian, W1.25.26.28Other/Indeterminable race, W11.031.141.12Mother had college degree, W1.85.82.84Parents not broken up, W11.041.021.05Religious service attendance, W1.98.971.00Importance of religion, W11.071.101.15Mainline Protestant, W11.161.08.98Black Protestant, W1.85.87.83Catholic, W1.89.89.85Jewish, W11.431.111.05Mormon, W1.38*.39*.41†No religion, W13.50†3.48†3.84†Other religion, W11.251.121.09Ever married, W3.86.81.86Has child living with them, W3.68.70.70Closeness to mother, W11.161.141.14Closeness to father, W1.991.151.15Proportion of friends who share religious beliefs, W11.001.001.00N134913491349\n\nexamines the impact of college attendance on religious reservedness. Model 1 indicates that college students are considerably less likely to develop the belief that conversion efforts are unacceptable. When the relationship variables are introduced in Model 2, however, the significance of this effect becomes marginal, suggesting that paternal closeness and peer homophily mediate the impact of college attendance. Model 3 indicates that religious service attendance is strongly negatively associated with development of opposition to conversion, further reduces the effect of college attendance on beliefs about conversion, and appears to mediate all of the significant effect of religious peer groups. Closer paternal relationships continue to be associated with reservedness in Model 3.\n\nTable 5\n\nModel 1Model 2Model 3Ever attended four-year college, W3.69*.70†.79Closeness to mother, W3.94.99Closeness to father, W3.83*.83*Lives in another person’s home, W31.051.00Lives in own place, W31.281.10Lives in group quarters, W3.88.94Percentage of friends who share religious beliefs, W3.99*1.00Religious service attendance, W3.74***Female, W11.79**1.75**1.74**Lived in Northeast, W11.151.201.21Lived in Midwest, W1.97.951.00Lived in West, W11.111.131.13Age, W3.91.90.91Black, W1.30**.35**.42*Hispanic, W11.281.281.38Asian, W1.44.36.29Other/Indeterminable race, W11.251..351.31Mother had college degree, W11.171.131.20Parents not broken up, W1.78.82.93Religious service attendance, W1.80***.80***.88*Importance of religion, W1.80*.80*.86Mainline Protestant, W12.37***2.35**1.98**Black Protestant, W13.09*2.90*2.62*Catholic, W12.83***2.92***2.60***Jewish, W12.172.321.58Mormon, W1.17*.17*.22*No religion, W11.01.941.00Other religion, W11.651.811.88Ever married, W31.491.552.04†Has child living with them, W3.69.69.72Closeness to mother, W11.091.111.07Closeness to father, W11.041.16†1.19†Proportion of friends who share religious beliefs, W11.001.001.00N119011901190\n\nexamines the impact of college attendance on religious inclusivity. Model 1 indicates that college attendance has no effect on inclusive views of religious truth, a finding that continues across all models. In Model 2, peer group homophily is negatively associated with the development of inclusive beliefs, but the other network variables are insignificant. When religious attendance is added in Model 3, the model shows that attendance is highly negatively associated with the belief that multiple religions may be true, and the effect of peer homophily becomes marginally significant, suggesting that participation in a religious community may explain much of the peer homophily effect.\n\nTable 6\n\nModel 1Model 2Model 3Ever attended four-year college, W3.86.891.11Closeness to mother, W31.131.25Closeness to father, W3.89.91Lives in another person’s home, W31.03.72Lives in own place, W31.33.79Lives in group quarters, W3.75.63Percentage of friends who share religious beliefs, W3.99*.99†Religious service attendance, W3.62***Female, W11.58†1.53†1.45Lived in Northeast, W1.69.66.53†Lived in Midwest, W1.82.90.84Lived in West, W1.54†.54†.48†Age, W3.86†.83†.79*Black, W1.24*.24*.16**Hispanic, W1.73.78.77Asian, W11.631.822.77Other/Indeterminable race, W1.22*.23*.17**Mother had college degree, W11.001.051.22Parents not broken up, W1.57*.60†.81Religious service attendance, W1.98.981.13Importance of religion, W1.66**.66**.78Mainline Protestant, W13.61**3.39**2.84**Black Protestant, W14.74**5.27**6.70**Catholic, W16.85***7.38***8.06***Jewish, W1–––––––––Mormon, W1.98.991.58No religion, W112.09*12.71*14.94**Other religion, W11.952.083.35Ever married, W3.47†.44†.62Has child living with them, W3.94.941.50Closeness to mother, W1.93.89.87Closeness to father, W1.931.031.02Proportion of friends who share religious beliefs, W1.99**.99*.99*N623623623\n\nexamines the impact of college attendance on religious individualism. Model 1 indicates that college students are no more likely to come to believe that it is OK to pick and choose religious beliefs, and this finding holds across all models. Model 2 shows that network factors are more predictive of this outcome. Peer homophily has a significant negative effect on the adoption of individualistic beliefs, as do living in another person’s home or in group quarters. Living alone, by contrast, has a marginally significant positive effect. Model 3 demonstrates that religious service attendance is, again, strongly negatively associated with the development of individualistic beliefs. Attendance appears to mediate the independent living effect, but not those of peer homophily or the effects of living in another person’s home or in group quarters. College continues to have no effect on propensity to approve of picking and choosing.\n\nTable 7\n\nModel 1Model 2Model 3Ever attended four-year college, W3.81.82.90Closeness to mother, W3.90.92Closeness to father, W3.90.93Lives in another person’s home, W3.51*.48*Lives in own place, W31.40†1.21Lives in group quarters, W3.62*.62*Percentage of friends who share religious beliefs, W3.99***.99**Religious service attendance, W3.79***Female, W1.92.90.90Lived in Northeast, W1.971.141.12Lived in Midwest, W11.031.041.08Lived in West, W11.00.971.01Age, W31.01.98.98Black, W1.38**.40*.46*Hispanic, W1.60†.64.70Asian, W12.102.102.28Other/Indeterminable race, W11.081.111.01Mother had college degree, W11.37†1.39†1.50*Parents not broken up, W1.85.83.87Religious service attendance, W1.99.981.05Importance of religion, W1.84*.86†.93Mainline Protestant, W11.94*1.73*1.53Black Protestant, W12.62*2.87**2.57*Catholic, W12.52***2.73***2.47***Jewish, W11.321.081.24Mormon, W1.57.62.72No religion, W12.00†2.05†1.91†Other religion, W1.79.79.76Ever married, W31.421.231.37Has child living with them, W3.90.84.92Closeness to mother, W1.961.021.04Closeness to father, W11.001.041.06Proportion of friends who share religious beliefs, W1.99†1.001.00N114011401140\n\nFinally, examines the impact of college attendance on religious independence. College attendance is not significantly correlated with becoming more likely to identify as “spiritual but not religious” in any of the models, nor are any of the network variables when added in Models 2. Heightened religious service attendance, however, is negatively associated with religious independence, a finding not particularly surprising given the common equation of religious service attendance and being religious.\n\nInteraction Effects\n\nIn , we explore variations by religious tradition. These models are parallel to those in – but include an education-religious tradition multiplicative interaction term. In the interest of space, we do not display all the odds ratios—which are similar to those in the previous tables—just the marginal effect of educational exposure for Wave 1 adherents to each religious group. Significant interaction terms among the groups are denoted with superscript letters. Educational effects for mainline Protestants appear to be distinct from some other groups—especially conservative Protestants and Catholics—when it comes to developing unorthodox, naturalistic, inclusive, reserved, and individualistic beliefs. Though the odds ratios for college attendance among mainline Protestants are not significant for discontinued belief in a personal god and only significant or marginally significant in some models for these other outcomes, the odds ratios are large and the cell sizes small, suggesting that a larger sample may reveal positive effects of college attendance for mainline Protestants on these measures. In many instances, those without any religious affiliation at Wave 1 also appear to liberalize religiously as the result of their college experience. Again, however, small cell sizes impede statistical significance among this group. Finally, attending four-year college may deter liberalization among conservative Protestants on additional outcomes. College attendance has a marginally significant negative effect on naturalistic beliefs in the first two models and a strong and consistent negative effect on reservedness and religious individualism across models, though some of the educational effect for these latter outcomes is mediated by social network factors.\n\nTable 9\n\nModel 1Model 2Model 3Panel A.

First, and most importantly, contrary to longstanding scholarly wisdom, attending college appears to have no liberalizing effect on most dimensions of religious belief. In fact, on some measures, college students appear to liberalize less than those who never attended college. College students are less likely to stop believing in a personal god and less likely to stop believing in the propriety of conversion attempts. On the other hand, they are more likely to develop doubts about their religious beliefs. In the main, however, the effect of college on students’ religious beliefs appears to be extremely weak. Although significant minorities of emerging adults become more liberal in their religious beliefs, college itself does not appear to be the culprit. College students do not liberalize any more than those who do not go to college.7\n\nIn fact, the case for the null (and perhaps protective) effects of college on traditional religious belief is even stronger than it appears from the results presented above. In supplementary analyses (not shown), college attendance also failed to predict differences on six other variables measuring religious beliefs. College students are also no more likely than non-students to stop believing in a judgment day, stop believing in an afterlife, stop believing in angels, stop believing in demons (except in the final two models, where social networks appear to suppress a positive effect of college attendance), become more uncertain about the existence of God, or abandon the belief that active congregational participation is a necessary aspect of being religious. Thus, on ten out of thirteen possible beliefs, attending college shows no net liberalizing effect before accounting for social networks; on two others, college appears to support traditional beliefs; on only one outcome—increased religious doubt—does college appear to undermine traditional religious belief. In the debate over how college influences religious beliefs, this study overwhelmingly supports those who claim that its influence is largely negligible, and perhaps even somewhat protective of traditional religious belief.\n\nSecond, to the extent that college does affect students’ beliefs, this study finds that much of that effect can be explained by the social contexts in which students are embedded. Net of parental relationships, living situation, peer groups, and religious attendance, college appears to have a significant effect only on belief in demons, and that appears to be a case of suppression rather than mediation. The positive effect of college on religious doubting is mostly explained by social networks (though it is marginally significant in the final model), and the conservative effect of college on beliefs in a personal god and the propriety of conversion appear to be entirely mediated by these social variables. This indicates that, in addition to being generally weak, college’s effect on religious belief is fragmented, partial, and largely explained by social ties.\n\nAcross most measures, the most consistent predictors of increased liberalization are not college attendance, but rather how often one attends religious services and what proportion of one’s friends are coreligionists. On nearly every measure, those whose friendship circles were less religiously diverse and those who attended services more regularly were less likely to develop more liberal beliefs. Of these, service attendance appears to be the more powerful. Service attendance was strongly negatively correlated with belief liberalization on all seven measures. Peer homophily also correlated significantly in the final models on four of the seven measures (and marginally so on a fifth), after controlling for religious attendance.\n\nParental relationships also predicted the likelihood of belief liberalization.8 A close paternal relationship appears to discourage the development of an impersonal conception of God, the abandonment of belief in miracles, increased doubts about religion, and increased religious reservedness. It may be that those with closer paternal relationships are simply more comfortable with traditional forms of authority, such as those emphasized in orthodox Christian beliefs (Lakoff 2002). On the other hand, since studies have shown that religious fathers tend to be more involved in family life and parenting than those who are less religious (Wilcox 2002), these findings may instead indicate that children with closer paternal relationships were raised by more devout parents, and thus more effectively socialized into their religious beliefs.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, college appears to have a somewhat stronger protective effect on conservative Protestant students’ beliefs. For most beliefs, college has the same effect among conservative Protestants as it has among all young adults, but conservative Protestants do liberalize less on two additional dimensions of belief: reservedness and naturalism, though the difference on the latter is only marginally significant. Mainline Protestant students, by contrast, appear more likely to liberalize on some measures. It may be that certain cultural features of the religious traditions themselves predispose mainline and conservative Protestant students to be more or less open to liberal conceptions of religion. Alternatively, it may be that opportunities for religious participation and networking on campus vary among groups, leading to divergent socializing patterns. Although mainline campus ministries have declined in recent years, evangelical ministries have expanded rapidly (Schmalzbauer 2007), and these may help evangelical students sustain traditional religious beliefs.\n\nTurning to the two mechanisms of collegiate influence, this study suggests that, on religious matters, at least, the “cultural broadening” effect of college may be less than is typically thought. While college may expose students to religious diversity, and while this exposure may lead to liberalization in some students, there are very few indications that this exposure leads to markedly different outcomes among students and non-attenders. To be sure, the relationship between religious diversity and religious belief is complicated. The effect of college on increased doubt suggests that exposure to new beliefs and ideas may indeed lead students to understand their faith in more relativistic terms than nonstudents. However, this statement must be qualified, since, generally speaking, college students are also less likely to become more religiously reserved or inclusive than their nonstudent counterparts.\n\nWhat might account for these weak effects? It may be that cultural broadening occurs earlier, in high school, thanks to increased diversity in the general population. The observed negative effect of age on liberalization on many of these outcomes lends credence to this view. Or it may be that college campuses are no longer substantially more diverse than the social worlds outside their borders. In additional analyses (not shown), we found that the friendship circles of those who attended college were actually less religiously diverse than those of nonattenders, but the differences were neither substantively nor statistically significant. This may suggest that cultural broadening occurs in roughly equivalent amounts both inside and outside the college setting.\n\nMore likely, we believe, in light of our findings on the effect of network variables, is that college students are self-segregating within the college setting. Moral worldviews have a strong independent effect on social network composition (Vaisey and Lizardo 2010). It seems likely that this effect would be quite strong in the college setting, where old social networks are typically disrupted and a wide variety of potential friendship and associational networks are available to students. Our results suggest that, for many students, the smaller social worlds into which they choose to enter may provide essential supports for the preservation of traditional beliefs, by reducing exposure to religious diversity, providing spaces in which religion can be safely ignored, or providing countervailing supports that allow students to retain their beliefs amidst diversity. The dynamics of religious belief, in other words, may have substantial parallels to the dynamics of religious practice and disaffiliation as reported in other studies (e.g., Hill 2009; Uecker et al. 2007). Self-segregation of students into “moral communities” on campus may effectively undercut any “cultural broadening” effect of college, and thus any additional propensity for religious liberalization.\n\nFinally, our study raises doubts about the proposed cognitive pathways to liberalization. Although our dataset does not contain measures that would permit us to directly assess these cognitive processes, we did find that—with the single, marginal exception of doubt—college students are no more likely than nonstudents to experience belief liberalization once social aspects are controlled, suggesting cognitive effects of college attendance are minimal. Our indirect measures may conceal differences among students associated with their choice of major or other academic experiences (e.g., Reimer 2010). Alternately, it may indicate that students can successfully compartmentalize their religious beliefs from other areas. Pancer and colleagues (1995) found that more traditional religious students tended to have similar levels of complexity in thinking about nonreligious issues as less traditional students, but much less complex thinking about religious issues. Our data cannot speak to either of these particular hypotheses, but they do raise a set of questions for further research.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nPrevious studies of the relationship between higher education and religious belief are torn between those finding a liberalizing effect, and those finding little effect. Our study, whose research design overcomes many of the methodological limitations of previous studies, provides overwhelming evidence in favor of those finding minimal impact. It also illustrates the centrality of social factors in mediating the relationship between college attendance and change in religious beliefs when differences do exist.\n\nWhile contributing to the resolution of this debate, our study also suggests several avenues for future research. First, while we find that attending college does not make emerging adults more likely to develop liberal beliefs, this finding remains in tension with studies of the broader population, which regularly find education to be associated with less orthodox religious beliefs (e.g., Petersen 1994; Sherkat 1998; Wuthnow 2007). There are at least two alternative explanations to a general education effect that merit investigation. First, the association of education and religious liberalism may be a legacy of a previous era in which higher education acted more strongly to liberalize students’ beliefs. Some scholars have indeed suggested that there may be important period or cohort effects on the college-belief relationship (Clydesdale 2007), but to our knowledge this possibility has not been systematically assessed. Second, college students may be more likely to differentially associate with those with more liberal religious beliefs after college, as the result of the higher-status social networks and economic groupings into which a college degree provides entrée (Stevens, Armstrong, and Arum 2008). Future analyses of the general population should consider these and other potential explanations, by explicitly examining how cohort and network effects may interact with educational attainment to explain religious liberalization.\n\nSecond, one of the more perplexing findings of this study is that college students appear less likely to liberalize on measures of orthodoxy and reservedness than nonstudents. This finding obviously has implications for how we understand the collegiate environment, and how it might or might not differ from other social settings. One possible explanation is that the broader culture is now substantially more like the college setting in terms of the ideas and people it exposes people to. Nonstudents may be just as likely to imbibe more liberal cultural and religious ideas, thanks to the triumph of liberal Protestantism in shaping the broader culture (Smith and Snell 2009). Alternatively, the dominant type of campus culture may have changed into one that is more protective of traditional religious beliefs than other contexts, thanks to norms of religious tolerance and/or faculty reluctance to engage with students’ religious beliefs (Cherry et al. 2001; Nash 2001; Uecker et al. 2007). Yet the extent to which either of these theories is true remains unclear. Arriving at a more satisfactory understanding of how higher education compares with noncollege settings will require at least three additional types of research: more studies of nonstudent populations, including studies of their lived experience and religious beliefs; closer examination of the religious communities that students enter into, as well as the dynamics of religion within student peer networks; and additional investigations into the dynamics of religion on college campuses, both contemporary and historical.\n\nIn sum, college students are no more likely to develop more liberal religious beliefs than those who do not attend. In some cases, college students actually appear more likely to retain their initial beliefs than nonstudents. These findings indicate that college’s effect on students’ religious beliefs is both weak and fragmented. Further, change in religious beliefs appears instead to be more strongly associated with network effects, particularly parental relationships, the proportion of friends who are coreligionists, and service attendance. The importance of these social factors suggests both the validity and the limitations of the “cultural broadening” theory of religious liberalization on college campuses. They also suggest that the multiplicity of social worlds on college campuses, where students join together into innumerable “moral communities,” may help to sustain specific religious beliefs, not only religious affiliation, salience, or practice as previous studies had indicated."
