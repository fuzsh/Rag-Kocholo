Chelsea Handler Just Revealed The Real Reason She Broke Up With Ted Harbert, And It's Definitely Not What You'd Expect

"That's when I knew it was time to break up with the guy."

Chelsea Handler once had a threesome — and it didn't exactly end how she expected.

While appearing on Andy Cohen's SiriusXM show, Chelsea revealed that after the threesome, things went awry in her relationship.

"I've slept with a woman, but I haven't dated a woman, no," Chelsea shared, adding that it was a threesome with her then-boyfriend and their masseuse.

Looking back, she says it was a "fun" experience...but she might have had a little TOO much fun.

"I was very turned on by this woman. I ended up hooking up with her several times without the guy that I was dating," Chelsea admitted.

She continued, "That's when I knew it was time to break up with the guy."

In the end, Chelsea revealed that the man she was dating at the time was former E! Entertainment exec Ted Harbert — and she never told him the real reason for their relationship's end.

"I don't think I ever revealed that, but I mean, hopefully, he's listening now. His name is Ted Harbert," Chelsea said.

At the time, Chelsea told Marie Claire that the pair broke up because he couldn't keep work separate from their relationship — which ended up not being the full truth.

While Ted may not have known about Chelsea's hookup with their masseuse, it sounds like he's doing okay because she noted that he's now living in Portugal with his wife.

And even though the threesome led to the end of her relationship, Chelsea says she would definitely do it again.

"Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean I don't want to get double teamed by a guy, but I like another girl in this situation," she said. "You know she can do all the stuff I'm too lazy to do."
