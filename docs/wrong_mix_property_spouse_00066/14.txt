She began dating hotelier Andr√© Balazs in 2012 and the couple have been on-off.

As of October 2013, Chelsea confirmed on her show that they had broken up.

Chelsea is not interested in getting married. "I don't know if I even want to get married," Handler once told The New York Times. "But if I do ever meet someone I like, they're going to know everything. They'll never be able to come back a couple years down the road and say I lied."

She's a bit of a control freak. Working with her team, Handler requires signoff on all details involving her projects.

She is a very loyal friend and would never talk bad about any of them. "I've never talked about...anyone I've become friends with. I'm not going to be friends with them if they're idiots in the first place," she told The Hollywood Reporter.

She always supports the underdog. While talking about her "Chelsea Lately" team, Handler told Hamptons: "I like people that don't belong on television...I like saying 'Screw you' to everybody that thinks there is one way to do television. I think it's hilarious to put people that are not attractive on TV. I surround myself with people that I find really funny and really kind of stupid. So if I get joy out of it, I have to assume other people are getting joy out of it."

She is very generous to both her friends and employees. According to comedian Heather McDonald, Handler's pal and co-worker, the talk show host "set up a scholarship fund for each of my kids and does the same for anyone on staff who has a baby. Yet she never went to college herself. She's a really sensitive person."

She's co-creating a non-profit organization for young women."I'm working on starting this foundation for young girls with my sisters to try to help underdogs get a light shone on them," she once told More. "I think that's really important when you're growing up, to have somebody remind you that you are special, that you have a gift."

Chelsea is growing tired of discuss gossip news on her show. "I can't keep doing the same thing; my brain is bleeding. I want to do something that's more mindful and isn't celebrity-centered. I'm not looking to totally bail on E! They've done a lot for me, and I like it here." Beat. "If you take away the Kardashians. I want to educate people and deliver news that isn't just surrounded by Charlie Sheen. I'd like to be able to do the serious stuff in conjunction with the comedy. I'd like to make an impact and have more responsibility than I do now."

She doesn't drink as much as she did before. "I don't drink as much as I should --or as much as people think I do. Mondays through Wednesdays I try to take it easy, and then on the weekends I do whatever I want," she once explained. "It's more for diet than the actual drinking thing. You can't drink like that and expect to be in at least somewhat decent shape. I mean, I love to go out and drink and have fun with my friends. But I'm not a mess."

She likes to poke fun at Ryan Seacrest but says she respects him a lot. . "Ryan and I have a very jocular relationship," she says. "I love Ryan. He's the hardest-working person I know. ... I have a lot of respect for him. But I'm not the new Ryan Seacrest. I'm funny; Ryan's not that funny. He's funny-looking."

Chelsea feels that she has finally made it in life! "When you're little and growing up and you're bullied, all you want to do is be like, 'You don't know I'm going to be something, and you're just going to be a housewife who doesn't work with twins that you hate. So shut up!' I used to get tortured all the time by the older girls and they'd tell me I was ugly and fat. This is the greatest comeuppance of all."

She is not the "marrying kind." "Now I'm just like, the person that's not getting married so I like it and I think it's a good example to not have that be part of your identity," she said in an interview with Gwyneth Paltrow. "The truth of the matter is, I don't really know how to balance a relationship and my life. I've never been able to really do that."

She know's how to speak her mind. "We're seeking out such grossness in human behavior and want such mindless entertainment. 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta' and some of these other shows are more racist. Or '16 and Pregnant.' Getting rewarded for being pregnant when you're a teenager? Are you serious? I mean, that makes me want to kill somebody." She continued: "I had an abortion when I was 16. Because that's what I should have done. Otherwise I would now have a 20-year-old kid. Anyway, those are things that people shouldn't be dishonest about it."
