        "text": "Chelsea Handler revealed that she’s changed her mind about dating and is now hoping to find a relationship.\n\nThe 44-year-old comedian has had a handful of public relationships in the past, but mostly stays single. She opts to spend most of her time on comedy, writing books and political activism, often taking hard shots at President Trump and Republicans.\n\nCHELSEA HANDLER CALLS FOR TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT FOR SAYING SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS ARE 'ENTERTAINMENT'\n\nThe former talk show host appeared on an episode of “The Talk,” where she explained that therapy helped her realize that wanting a relationship is not a weakness nor an admission that she’s not comfortable on her own.\n\n“I have changed my mind about being open to relationships because I thought I was tough for a really long time, and what I learned through therapy is that being really tough is actually being vulnerable and being able to admit that you really want to be in a relationship,” she told the panel. “I thought I would sound weak if I said that. And, listen, I have a pretty good life, so I’m happy if I don’t have a relationship. But I’d love to find somebody to love.”\n\nThe star detailed her odd dating behavior in her latest book “Life Will Be the Death of Me” in which she discussed dating younger men knowing there will be no future with them.\n\nCHELSEA HANDLER BLAMES REPUBLICANS FOR COLORADO HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTING\n\n“I’ll hook up with younger guys who are absolute and utter messes. These relationships are based solely on their looks and their bodies,\" she admits in the book. \"It’s completely reckless behavior.”\n\nShe also noted that she has a particular attraction to older men, but that becomes more difficult to satisfy as she herself ages. However, she found herself jokingly eyeing Robert Mueller in her book. However, she’s admitted that the attraction is just fantasy given that he’s married.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"
