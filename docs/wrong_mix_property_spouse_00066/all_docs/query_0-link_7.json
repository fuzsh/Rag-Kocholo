        "text": "Chelsea Handler settles into a back booth at the R+D Kitchen in Santa Monica, CA, and wastes no time in perusing the drinks menu. \"Anything with booze in it, I love,\" I think I hear her say, but I'm not sure, with the saxophone blaring in the background. \"Anything with booze?\" I ask. \"No, basil! Anything with b-a-s-i-l,\" she says with a laugh, referring to the cocktail she orders, which happens to be garnished with a sprig of it. Forgive me for jumping to conclusions, but this is Chelsea Handler, after all, the late-night talk-show host who has elevated the drunken tell-all to a highly lucrative art form via three New York Times number-one best-sellers (including Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea), sold-out comedy tours, and two hit cable-TV shows on the E! network. Who better to star on the cover of REDBOOK's first-ever \"confessions\" issue? Sipping and spilling is what Chelsea does best — and I, for one, am an unabashed fan. On her nightly show, Chelsea Lately, the comedian with a dwarf sidekick and a weakness for rappers and chubby babies outs what most of us would keep in: photos of herself and her staffers in compromising positions, her cup size (34D), and details of her sex life and private parts (which she refers to as her coslopus or Pikachu, depending on the context). And she certainly doesn't hold back when it comes to celebrities. \"Paris Hilton is going on a goodwill mission to Rwanda,\" she once said on the show, in her trademark raspy monotone. \"It's the first time an entire third-world country will have to get immunizations for a visitor.\" Chelsea's take-no-prisoners approach can be polarizing, but it has also won her 4.4 million followers on Twitter who can't get enough of her candor. If there were a Hollywood Walk of Shame, this decidedly non-golden girl would be the first one down on all fours — and most likely face-planting right into the cement.\n\nOr so I think. But — surprise, surprise — a sharp-tongued, foul-mouthed boozehound is not who I encounter when we meet. \"Cheers, girl!\" she says, as we clink glasses. \"It's nice to go out and have a drink in the middle of the week.\" Did I hear that right? Isn't she an every-night drinker? No, she explains. \"I never do this.\" When the food arrives, she instructs me to hand her my plate. As she dishes up salad, the salty blonde with the telltale dark roots seems far nicer than the acerbic persona we see on the small screen. Still dressed in what she wore on the air — a soft-pink blouse, skinny gray jeans, and platform boots — she talks about starting a foundation to nurture teenage girls, gushes over photos she's just snapped of her newest puppy, Gary, talks about scrapbooking (!), and starts to tear up as she reminisces about her mother, who died of complications from cancer in 2006. At the end of the evening, Chelsea announces she's going to pick me up the next day and that I should take down her cell number in case I need to reach her. At 9:30 the next morning, she phones to say she's running a little early. Her vibe is totally together and even... maternal.\n\nFunnily enough, Chelsea plays a mother of three in February's This Means War, a romantic comedy starring her pal Reese Witherspoon. She'll also costar in Fun Size, out this fall, playing a mom to Nickelodeon darling Victoria Justice. And then there's her new NBC sitcom, Are You There, Chelsea?, in which she wears a brunette wig to play her own older sister Sloane. Her character gives birth in the first episode — without an epidural. \"Personally, I'd have a baby just for the epidural,\" Chelsea quips to me. Okay, so maybe the sworn-to-be-single New Jersey native isn't quite ready to settle down, but over a few rounds of — you guessed it — vodka, we get Chelsea to make her biggest confession yet: She's kind of a sweetie.\n\nREDBOOK: I saw your family portrait on your desk. I couldn't believe that hunky guy with the big '70s hair is [your now-bald brother] Roy!\n\nCHELSEA HANDLER: I know. Can you imagine peaking as a teen? I think if you peak in high school, there's a problem. That's what my sister always said: \"Don't worry, you'll peak later.\"\n\nRB: Did being the youngest of six shape you?\n\nCH: Yeah. People always tell me I need to have a kid, and I say, \"No, I don't.\" Because I wouldn't have just one kid; I'd have six. I need a huge family. So I just kind of fill my house with tons of rejects and misfits so it feels like I have a bunch of children.\n\nRB: Who lives with you?\n\nCH: Well, my brother Roy lives with me, and my friend Shelly, who's a lesbian from Dallas. And right now one of my assistants is living at my house because I got a new puppy and I didn't realize it needed to be housebroken, and I'm like, \"Ahhh, I'm not waking up every two hours to take this baby out.\" So it's really fun to go home and have a house full of people.\n\nRB: That does sound like fun. Drinking has always been a big part of your shtick. Do you think there's a difference between being a lush and being an alcoholic?\n\nCH: There is. Even though I joke about drinking all the time, people have the wrong idea about me — that I drink every night. Actually I don't. I contain myself. I'm not a hot mess, you know? Very rarely do I get loopy, and if I do, it's at my house... or someone else's house. Not in public. [Laughs]\n\nRB: Well, I don't see how you could drink every night and accomplish everything you have. Then again, you became a star by breaking all the rules, from sleeping with your boss [Chelsea dated Ted Harbert, chairman of NBC Broadcasting and former president and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, which owns E!, for four years] to dishing too much. Do you ever feel like you're an anti-authority figure?\n\nCH: I definitely feel anti-authority. When I moved to California, I waited tables from the age of 19 to 25, until I got Girls Behaving Badly [an all-female prank show], and I got fired from every job because I could never listen to a manager who told me I'd be quizzed on the menu. I've always had a problem with authority. That's why I had to be my own boss. It's been amazing. I can't believe I'm able to get away with this kind of ridiculousness.\n\nRB: Did you ever doubt yourself, think you wouldn't make it?\n\nCH: At the beginning. But I never had a backup plan. I never said, \"If this doesn't work out, I'll go back to finish college.\" My sister Simone was really supportive. I remember I had been auditioning and auditioning for The Practice, and I didn't think I was going to get it, so one night I called her and said, \"I don't know what I'm going to do. What if I never make it?\"\n\nRB: How old were you at the time?\n\nCH: I was probably 24, and my family was living in New Jersey, and they were all sending me money on a regular basis. If I couldn't make rent, I would pick a brother or sister or my parents. They would take turns. And my sister said, \"I have no doubt in my mind that you're going to get there. There is nothing else you're capable of doing besides this. Don't give up on yourself. I believe in you. There's no one like you. What you are going to end up doing is creating your own thing.\" And then I got the call on the other line that I had gotten The Practice. It was like $8,000, so in my mind, I was like, \"I can retire!\" And I was cast as a rape victim, so it was a dramatic role, which made it all the more absurd. But it was one of those moments I'll never forget. But of course, my sister doesn't remember that conversation at all.\n\nRB: So your family's always been really supportive?\n\nCH: Absolutely. It's funny, one of my girls at work, Eva, puts together scrapbooks for me. The other day I started going through them, after I had said repeatedly to Eva, \"Please stop making these. I will never sit around going through scrapbooks.\" And sure enough, I sat there, and I found these notes written by my mom, and one of them was from a time when she had sent me money, and she wrote: \"Don't worry. This is what mommies are for. And don't think one day I'm not going to come back and collect on all of this.\" And I was like, Oh... [Voice cracks]\n\nRB: What was your mom like?\n\nCH: She was such a lovely, supportive, and soft person, very opposite to what I am. I'm more like my dad in that regard. She was German, but she wasn't your typical German woman, and she was married to my father, who is Jewish. Everything was food to her. I would come home from school at 3 in the afternoon, and she'd have a huge bowl of macaroni and cheese, as if that was a proper snack. I mean, it took me 10 years to reprogram my mind that I can't have macaroni and cheese at 3 in the afternoon every day as a fourth meal.\n\nRB: How funny!\n\nCH: She could always sense when people needed an extra dose of loving. One of my high school girlfriends told me when my mom passed away, \"You know, your mom was the first person who ever told me she loved me.\" We had so much love in our family. We're all tied together in a really special way.\n\nRB: You're lucky you have that. You've certainly had your share of tragedy. I know your older brother Chet died at 21 [in a hiking accident, when Chelsea was 9], and that sent your family into a dark place. Did that somehow inform your comedy?\n\nCH: In some ways. Growing up, we were all really funny, so maybe being the youngest, I was the most precocious and had the most drive. I wanted to make us laugh and keep up with my older siblings, and help pull us out of that darkness.\n\nRB: And they were there for you when you were struggling, and now you're doing a million and one things, and they're still a big part of you. I'm just trying to get a handle on what a day in your life is like, and how you make it all work.\n\nCH: Monday through Thursday, I tape four [Chelsea Lately] shows. Thursday, I tape After Lately, then Friday, I do my NBC show, and on Saturdays I'm doing reshoots with Reese [Witherspoon] for the movie. I have to be in motion. I had two days off recently, and I got on the sofa and I didn't get up for two days, and I felt as if I'd been hit by a truck. Once everything calms down for too long, it's very hard to get moving again.\n\nRB: Right. We complain, but we're lucky to have a lot of work.\n\nCH: Well, we acclimate very easily. That's the human condition. So even though it takes nine months to prepare to have a baby, you have that baby in one day. One day it's not in your house, and the next day it is. And you can't just have it for like four hours. You have it forever! Or one moment you're fine, and the next you're in prison. And there you are trading pickles for tampons. My mom used to say to me, \"Don't ever complain about where you are, because you're the person who got you here.\"\n\nRB: I've read that when you started out in stand-up, you said at first that you tried to downplay your looks to appear more relatable. Is that true?\n\nCH: I never considered myself a supermodel or anything like that. I mean, I don't think I'm ugly. I have good days and bad days, and I like when I'm fit and lean and all of those things that any woman likes, but it's not the eye of the hurricane for me. It's my sense of humor and self-deprecation that define me and invite a lot of people in. You know I'm not just making fun of all these idiots. I'm making fun of myself, first and foremost. I don't know why people think of me as mean, because I don't take it all that seriously. I'm just trying to make some people laugh.\n\nRB: But you still take on topics that other talk-show hosts never would. You've talked about having an abortion, for example.\n\nCH: I don't like lying. You don't have to disclose everything, but I think we all have to be honest and work for women everywhere. Lately, I've been thinking about what I can do for girls who were once in my situation. I'd turned to partying or smoking weed all the time, and I just wish someone had given me a creative outlet. So we've come up with this idea of a foundation for young girls called Chelsea's Chicks, and it's for the underdogs, the girls who are considered uncool, who are not fitting in, and we'll give them a place where they can explore their talents. Because you just need one person to tell you they believe in you, and it informs you for the rest of your life. It's a powerful thing, especially now with what goes on with girls in high school.\n\nRB: What was high school like for you?\n\nCH: I was tortured, and probably half of it was deserved, but I was bullied — so much so that there were days when I was like, \"I can't go to school today.\" I was too scared.\n\nRB: How were you bullied?\n\nCH: They'd call me a dog, and bark at me, and say, \"You're fat. You're ugly.\" The girl who used to torture me, the ringleader, showed up backstage at one of my concerts in Newark. I looked at her and said, \"I know you.\" And she went, [high-pitched voice] \"Ahhh, I'm so sorry for having tortured you in high school!\" and I said, \"I'm so over it. Actually, thank you, because you gave me the impetus to be successful, because I just wanted to show you I was so much more than what you ever made me out for.\"\n\nRB: That is sweet revenge! Now let's talk about your love life. You've dated...\n\nCH: The four corners of the world.\n\nRB: You have!\n\nCH: I know. I like to get around.\n\nRB: So you don't have a type?\n\nCH: No, I like to find things that pique my interest. I'm not looking to get married. I've always been like, Oh, this could be fun for a while. Sometimes you get into a relationship and you think, Oh, this could be more serious. And sometimes you're like, Ahhh, I'm going to have to break up with this person eventually. It's like having to fire someone. [Laughs]\n\nRB: Is that what happened with André Balasz [the hotelier she dated last year]?\n\nCH: Um, I won't comment on that publicly, because he specifically asked me not to. I don't have an issue with discussing it, but I would like to respect someone else's privacy, so...\n\nRB:Wow, Chelsea. This might be the first time you've respected someone else's privacy.\n\nCH: Well, it's the first time someone's asked me to. So I do keep my word. [Laughs]\n\nRB: You've also dated an animal handler [Animal Planet personality Dave Salmoni].\n\nCH: Well, I need to be handled.\n\nRB: So you went from Ted [Harbert] to...\n\nCH: Dave Salmoni to 50 Cent to...\n\nRB: Andre, and what was that like?\n\nCH: Funny! I'm mostly trying to amuse myself. I don't date two people at the same time. I'm very conservative about that kind of stuff. I don't want them dating anyone else either. And when it's over, it's over. It's not easy to break up, but it's always a big relief when you do.\n\nRB: Did you ever feel like you'd found The One?\n\nCH: Ted was probably the biggest love of my life. I was with him for such a long time. I was madly in love with him, and I tried very, very hard to make it work, but I just couldn't. The others were kind of inconsequential. It wasn't like, \"Oh, I'm going to marry 50 Cent...\" [Laughs] I mean, seriously. But I did like him.\n\nRB: What would we call you? Mrs. 50?\n\nCH: Mrs. Cent. He's very sweet and antithetical to what you'd think of him. He's got a huge smile, and all my friends fell in love with him. He was adorable and kind of irresistible, and it was like a fun little episode.\n\nRB: Hey, we all need that. But seriously, do you ever worry that you'll never meet a man who can keep up with you?\n\nCH: I don't think about it a lot. It's very hard to keep a relationship with all the things I have going on. I don't worry about meeting men. I used to, but now I'm never single for very long.\n\nRB: Going back to your work, do you ever pinch yourself and wonder, How did I go from slacker to total workaholic?\n\nCH: Yeah. I think inherently I am a lazy person. I could never have imagined myself working this hard back then. But you get used to it. People think I'm out until all hours. I'm in bed at 10 p.m. every night. I'm up at 6 a.m. I do Pilates every morning. I meet with the writers and work on this or that. I'm just happier working.\n\nRB: And you have a trainer for your staff, too.\n\nCH: I have yoga once a week for my staff with Mandy Ingber. I like to do that for them. I love to vacation with my staff or my family. I love to watch people have fun on my dime. [Laughs]\n\nRB: Are you ever cheap with yourself? Do you bargain shop?\n\nCH: No.\n\nRB: I mean, you have a Bentley. How fabulous is that?\n\nCH: I bought that when I was dating 50 Cent. He came over with a Ferrari one night, and I'm like, Watch this. So I got a Bentley. Meanwhile, he never even bought that Ferrari. He took it on loan. And here I am, Ahhh... I just bought this Bentley.\n\nRB: I read that when you re-signed with E! for $25 million, you gave everyone on your staff a $1,000 signing bonus.\n\nCH: You have to share the wealth.\n\nRB: You share the spotlight too, which is rare.\n\nCH: I read this cheesy quote once: \"Blowing out someone else's candle doesn't make yours glow brighter.\" We women have to stick together. People ask me why I'm so hard on men. It's because they've gotten a really easy ride. And it's not that I think women should take over the world. But I do think it should be 50/50. I'm very much about letting other people shine, because it makes us all shine brighter. I like having a fraternity. I like girls and boys together, misfits and underdogs — I love underdogs.\n\nRB: Why?\n\nCH: I was an underdog. I've always felt bad for the girl who was left out.\n\nRB: The persona you sometimes give off on-air is so different from the way you are.\n\nCH: People say that to me all the time: \"I can't believe you're so sweet and warm.\" I mean, I'm very much who I am [on the show], but I'm not making fun of anyone I would ever be friends with. And the people I'm friends with, I'd never talk about.\n\nRB: Are you still in touch with the people you wrote about in your books? And if so, do you keep them separate from your new Hollywood pals like Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon? Or do you blend?\n\nCH: I have them all there at the same time. I mean, Jennifer Aniston is one of the most down-to-earth, low-key people I know. She's just a regular girl. And Reese is the same way. You can't have friendships that aren't based on realness. I'm not going to treat them any differently than I would any of my other friends. I mean, Jen and Justin [Theroux] came to my house for Thanksgiving with 18 of my staff members. And so what?\n\nRB: Did you get to improvise with Reese in This Means War?\n\nCH: I only do movies if the director knows I won't memorize lines and lets me improvise. So this worked out well, because I'm super-stupid and Reese is, you know, super-focused.\n\nRB: You're not super-stupid!\n\nCH: Okay, I mean, I'm immature, very immature.\n\nRB: That's a good thing — defying age stereotypes."
