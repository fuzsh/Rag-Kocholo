His family had origins of ancient Lithuanian nobility. His first painting education was self-taught.\n\nAt about age 20, Narbut settled in Saint Petersburg from 1906 to 1917. There he studied with painters Ivan Bilibin and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky. In 1909, Narbut continued some of his studies inMunich, in the school of Simon Holl√≥sy. After his return to Saint Petersburg he joined the organization Mir iskusstva. In 1910-1912 Narbut was an illustrator of the fairy tales Hans Christian Andersen, the fables of Ivan Krylov, and folk tales.\n\nIn March 1917, Narbut moved to Kiev. In September 1917, he became professor and rector of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts.
