It is proved that the reform of 1934 radically changed the system of art education. The curricula of all art schools returned to academism, popularizing classical art view, work with model, displaying the socialistic reality by realistic methods. Approved new functions of art-pedagogical education such as: ideological, scientifical and methodical. Analysis of historical and literary sources shows that the problem of future Soviet teacher (who could not only actively absorb professional knowledge, but also to be an artist, ideologist, helmsman, and guide, in the class struggle of the proletariat) formation was brewing in the society. Based on archival materials it is proved that exactly in postgraduate studies and in the scientific-research departments it was formed practical abilities and skills of future teachers. The necessity for training of artists-teachers was urgent but complex political events of the 30's, continuous repressions, destruction of the Ukrainian intelligentsia interrupted introduced in the 20's initiatives about scientific training of art-pedagogical specialists.

It is proved that the reform of 1934 radically changed the system of art education. The curricula of all art schools returned to academism, popularizing classical art view, work with model, displaying the socialistic reality by realistic methods. Approved new functions of art-pedagogical education such as: ideological, scientifical and methodical. The analysis of historical and literary sources shows that the problem of a future Soviet teacher (who could not only actively absorb professional knowledge, but also to be an artist, ideologist, helmsman, and guide, in the class struggle of the proletariat) formation was brewing in the society.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to highlight the essence of the process of preparation of art experts initiated in the independent Ukraine. Research methods. The choice of research strategies in disclosing the purpose of the study determined the application of system and complex approaches, as well as historical-chronological and comparative methods. The scientific novelty of the obtained results consists in the formulation and development of an actual topic, which in scientific terms did not receive comprehensive and objective coverage and is first investigated. The results of comprehension of the essence of the process of preparation of expert art experts can serve as an important component in the study of contemporary issues of artistic education. Conclusions. The development of the socio-cultural space of Ukraine has revealed the objective need to expand the range of work aimed at preserving and protecting cultural heritage. The distinction in this sector of the culture of the probl...\n\nNowadays much attention is devoted to education modernization and attracting of foreign experience for solving these needs. The great Ukrainian art school is known throughout the world. Its bright representatives-classics of the last epoch are: T. Holembiievska, V. Hurin, O. Kovalchuk, V. Vyrodova-Hotie and others. These artists got their knowledge and brought their talents to light in Ukrainian art institutes in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, and Lviv. The author, investigating the creative and pedagogical path of the Ukrainian artist of easel painting Tetyana Mykolaivna Golembievska, analyzes the era of the Second World War, when all of the artists of the Soviet Union, without exception, had the opportunity to freely share their knowledge, and open new creative horizons. After all, the 1940s - early 1950s is the time when local schools were fulfilled by the traditions of other national schools. Graduates of the war age and early post-war years often stayed in educational institutions for the purpose of further teaching activities.\n\nAn important component of the world choreography are folk dance ensembles, the scientific understanding of development trends of which contributes to the formation of an idea of the current state of the choreographic sphere and comprehension of the future prospects of this art form. The study of the specifics of artistic processes in choreography becomes especially relevant today, which will exclude the possibility of levelling its special features, the uniqueness of the creation and development of the art of dancing in its individual areas. Ukrainian folk stage art of dancing, which is an integral part of the country’s artistic culture, reached its peak in the second half of the XX century. In times of historical crisis, when national identity (traditions, culture, beliefs, language, and shared historical memory) was under threat of destruction. Traditional uniqueness manifested itself in various forms of the society, including an increase in interest in one’s own spiritual treasures, such as folk choreographic art associated with folk traditions and customs. In modern conditions of social development, there is an urgent need to preserve the cultural heritage of the Ukrainian people, while the main goal of the scientific community in this direction is to recognize the uniqueness and originality of the spiritual heritage of each region and ethnic group of Ukraine. The purpose of the academic paper lies in analysing the features of the interaction of traditions and innovations in choreographic art by comparing the trends of its development in the XX century, in particular, identifying the key methods for preserving folk traditions and the main means of applying innovations for the most effective development of this art form. In the course of writing the academic paper, a set of research methods has been used, in particular as follows: general scientific (analysis, synthesis, deduction, induction, generalization), specific scientific (historical-structural), as well as a questionnaire, which has been implemented using the Survio resource. Based on the results of the research, the theoretical fundamentals have been studied and the practical aspects of the features of the traditional and innovative components of the choreography of the XX century in Ukraine have been clarified.\n\nThe article objectively highlights the relevance of the study of the sociocultural paradigm of Ukraine and Europe at the turn of the XVIII-XIX centuries in the context of ethno-national and European integration aspects. The specifics of the Enlightenment and active education of Ukrainian youth in European universities are described, which ensured the entry of contemporary Ukraine into the cultural, educational and intellectual world space. The scientific understanding of the essence of national historical and ethnopedagogical education, their content, the importance of methodological principles of systemicity, continuity and continuity and ensuring their ethno-national orientation, which now acquires the latest theoretical and methodological content. After all, ethno-national factors have moved from the problems of meaning-making, holistic understanding, which are updated, to personal knowledge. The approach to the study of the science of Ukrainian studies of the classical type from the point of view of axiological, archetypal-symbolic and conceptual is presented. Accordingly, Ukrainian historical, pedagogical and culturological thought is aimed at modeling the cultural and educational system, taking into account the synergetic principles of self-organization of interdisciplinary holistic knowledge, axiological, archetypal-symbolic, conceptual approaches. The solution of these problems will provide an opportunity to consistently clarify the historical and cultural stages of culturological concepts at the turn of the XVIII-XIX centuries, as well as prospects for the development of Ukrainian science during the XX-XXI centuries; to substantiate the methodological capabilities of modern humanities and education to solve specific problems in the scope of general areas of historical, Ukrainian and cultural sciences.\n\nThe origins of the art market in Ukraine are analyzed on the basis of the life of artists, art exhibitions, art salons and creative circles of the 17th - early 20th centuries. The author researches the socio-cultural processes of different periods of Ukrainian culture that influenced the phenomenon of the art market, in particular its educational and commercial aspects. The peculiarity of the art market in Ukraine is connected with the popularization of young Ukrainian artists, the creation of favorable conditions for the realization of their talent, the unification of artistic forces from different Ukrainian regions and on. The art market is considered as a value-semantic space, where works of art are circulated, thanks to which new ideas emerge in the Ukrainian cultural space. The author uses the cultural-historical method, which allows to analyze, describe and generalize the patterns of origin, formation and development of the art market as an important component of socio-cultura..."
