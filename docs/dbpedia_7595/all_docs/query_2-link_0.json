        "text": "Ukrainian graphic designer (1886–1920)\n\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is Ivanovych and the family name is Narbut.\n\nHeorhiy Ivanovych Narbut (Ukrainian: Георгій Іванович Нарбут; 25 February [O.S. 9 March] 1886 – 23 May 1920), also known as Georgy Narbut or George Narbut, was a Ukrainian graphic artist.[1]\n\nHe is known for designing the Ukrainian People's Republic's coat of arms, banknotes, postage stamps, charters, and for his many illustrations in books and magazines. He was a brother of the Acmeist poet Vladimir Narbut.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nHeorhiy Narbut was born in the village Narbutivka, Russian Empire (now Ukraine) not far off from Hlukhiv. His family had origins of ancient Lithuanian nobility. His first painting education was self-taught.\n\nSaint Petersburg\n\n[edit]\n\nAt about age 20, Narbut settled in Saint Petersburg from 1906 to 1917. There he studied with painters Ivan Bilibin and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky. In 1909, Narbut continued some of his studies in Munich, in the school of Simon Hollósy. After his return to Saint Petersburg he joined the organization Mir iskusstva. In 1910-1912 Narbut was an illustrator of the fairy tales Hans Christian Andersen, the fables of Ivan Krylov, and folk tales.\n\nKyiv\n\n[edit]\n\nIn March 1917, Narbut moved to Kyiv. In September 1917, he became professor and rector of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts. During this time he created his Ukrainian banknotes, postage stamps and charters for the newly created Ukrainian National Republic. Narbut also worked on the Ukrainian magazines: Nashe Mynule (Our past), Zori (Stars), and Sontse Truda (The Sun of Labor) among others. He died of typhus in 1920.\n\nThe dancer Marina Berezowsky [uk] (1914–2011) was his daughter. She became a major figure in ballet in Australia.[2]\n\nHe also had a son, Danylo Narbut [uk] (1916-1998), artist.\n\nWorks\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Armorial of Little Russia\n\nFirst definitive stamps of Ukraine (1992), after the drawing of Narbut\n\nSeries from May 16, Michel catalog, #80\n\nSame Michel catalog, #81\n\nSame Michel catalog, #79\n\nSame Michel catalog, #82\n\nSeries from June 17 Michel catalog, #75\n\nSame Michel catalog, #76\n\nSame Michel catalog, #77\n\nSame Michel catalog, #78\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
