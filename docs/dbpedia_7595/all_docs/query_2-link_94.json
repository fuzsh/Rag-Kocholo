        "text": "Thus, the postgraduate student of the fourth year of study, Natalia Rudenko, was the supervisor of a freshman student Maria Rashevska, who presented a report on \"Memes as a specific presentation of attitudes towards political processes and the activities of politicians\". The report \"Transformation of Georgiy Narbut’s image in the newspaper \"Narodna trybuna\" of 1960-1989\" was presented by the second-year student Maryna Sadymaka under the scientific supervision of Oksana Gedz. Iryna Virchenko was the scientific supervisor of the student of SSD “MBC of SSU” Stolbtsova Arina. The topic of scientific development is \"Content analysis in media research\". The interest of a freshman Artem Korol in sports journalism was the impetus for research and writing theses under the supervision of Vadym Yaremenko. The topic of the report: \"The role of the Internet media in shaping the positive image of a modern sportsman \". Maryna Sadivnycha, a Ph.D. student in journalism, helped the first-year student Olena Zavedenko to research and present the topic \"Rubric \"Society\" of the online version of the franchise magazine Marie Claire Ukraine\". It was this work during the conference that the participants liked the most and, according to the results of their vote, brought victory to the young researcher. –The preparation process was long but interesting,\" said Olena Zavedenko. – The work included the analysis of a large amount of material, writing theses, preparing a speech and presentation. At each stage, I was accompanied by advice and support from a supervisor. On the eve of the conference, we arranged a small \"rehearsal\" to assess the correctness of placing sense accents, the integrity of the text, the presentability of the infographics online, whether there will be technical difficulties. As a result, everything went well. The students’ \"First step into science\" was the first step for postgraduate students to scientific supervision – no less important and exciting. Vadym Yaremenko shared his impressions of the new experience: – Scientific supervision in such a project is difficult work, but at the same time– an unforgettable experience: pleasant and exciting moments, emotions of competitive and excitable fight, because you realize the responsibility which charges you with inspiration and energy to help the student as much as possible in creating the first scientific product. The feeling that you are in the team involved in scientific and educational work brings intellectual and aesthetic pleasure. This is an incredibly cool experience!"
