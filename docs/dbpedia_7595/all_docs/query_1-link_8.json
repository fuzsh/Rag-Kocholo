A member of both the Académie Goncourt and the Collège de ’Pataphysique, Mac Orlan was admired by everyone from Raymond Queneau and Boris Vian to André Malraux and Guy Debord. Some links for the illustrator Yann Bernard Dyl (1887–1944): —page at Ma galerie à Paris (the blog of Michel Lagarde's gallery) —French wikipedia page —Houghton Library blog also covered this book (from their own collection) \"Celle de la Rue\" / Streetwalkers? \"Les Jeux\" / Gambling \"Dancing\" \"La Neige\" / Cocaine \"Les Voluptes\" / Ether-fueled orgies \"Prostitution\" \"Vitesse\" / Speed cover of the exhibition catalog where I found the above images\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Brave Girl from Vilnius and Greenbeard the Killer\n\nIllustrations by Birutė Žilytė (Lithuania, 1970) These images come from Aldona Liobytė’s collection of tales, \"Pasaka apie narsią Vilniaus mergaitę ir galvažudį Žaliabarzdį\" (A Fairy Tale about the Brave Girl from Vilnius and Greenbeard the Killer). My copy isn't an actual book, but a portfolio of 2-page folded spreads (so it was easy to scan, and I may also frame all of them). I stitched some of them together but wanted to show most of them at the larger size. The biography of the illustrator comes from Illustrarium, a project dedicated to Lithuania's participation as a guest of honor country at the Bologna Children’s Book Fair in 2011:Born in the village of Nainiškiai in the Panevėžys district in 1930, she lives in Vilnius. She is the wife of Algirdas Steponavičius, the graphic artist and children’s book illustrator, and mother of Daina Steponavičiūtė, a graphic artist. She studied graphic art at the Lithuanian State Art Institute, graduating in 1956. She worked as an art teacher at the Vilnius M.K. Čiurlionis Art school from 1963 to 1987, and also made engravings. In 1964, together with Algirdas Steponavičius and Laimutis Ločeris, she painted murals for the Nykštukas children’s cafe in Vilnius. From 1969 to 1972, together with Steponavičius, she decorated the Pušelė children’s sanatorium in Valkininkai with murals. She made her first illustrations for children’s books in 1957; her own original style, combining elements of folk and pop art, evolved around 1964 (the illustrations to Mykolas Sluckis’ children’s book Nedėkingas ančiukas [The Ungrateful Duckling] and to the tales Užburtos birbynės [The Enchanted Pipes] by Sonė Tomarienė). Žilytė has been considered an innovator since 1967, when the children’s book by the Latvian classic Janis Rainis Aukso sietelis (The Little Golden Sieve) with her illustrations was published. In 1969, she was awarded the Golden Apple for the book at the Bratislava Children’s Book Illustrations Biennial. In 1971, she won the gold medal at the Leipzig Book Fair for her illustrations to Pasaka apie narsią Vilniaus mergaitę ir galvažudį Žaliabarzdį (A Fairy Tale about the Brave Girl from Vilnius and Greenbeard the Killer) by the Lithuanian writer Aldona Liobytė. For this book and Pabėgusi dainelė (The Little Song that Ran Away) by Liobytė, which was published in 1966, she was awarded the State Prize of Soviet Lithuania. In 1976, her illustrations to Kostas Kubilinskas’ Stovi pasakų namelis (A Little Fairy-Tale House) earned her the Hans Christian Andersen Diploma of Honour at the IBBY 25th Congress. She has illustrated (on her own and together with Steponavičius) 14 books. In 2010, she held her first personal exhibition at the Lithuanian National Gallery. [via Illustrarium] I also plan to feature images from the catalog Illustrarium: Soviet Lithuanian Children’s Book Illustration. Laura at Animalarium turned me on to this book in 2011 though I'm just now getting to it (oof). Also see this interview with the artist (in Lithuanian). Some more photographs of the original edition from 1970, taken by Mindaugas Ažušilis for Illustrarium: via Illustrarium via Illustrarium via Illustrarium via Illustrarium via Illustrarium via Illustrarium From the catalog I mention above: \"This book was ambiguously received by children: some loved it, some hated it; but nobody could remain indifferent to it. It attracted much interest from artists, and Birute Zilyte was awarded the Gold Medal at the 1971 Leipzig Book Fair for it. It is related to traditions in Lithuanian folk art, but is also heavily influenced by the colors and shapes of Pop Art. The artist still likes to tell how she herself had to oversee the printing of the book, trying to persuade the printers to preserve the extraordinarily bright colors of the illustrations.\" I don't think my scans do the colors justice. These works really have to be seen in person (sorry to rub it in). The artist's biography and text from the catalog is by Dr. G. Jankevičiūtė, curator of the exhibition Illustrarium: Soviet Lithuanian Children's Book Illustration. Thank you so much to Rūta for your help!

Dix (1911, Moscow) Years ago I came across images from these two books — volumes 1 & 2 of Toys (Игрушки) — and wondered if I'd ever get to see more. Based on only a handful of works, Narbut was one of my top choices for the \"Journey Round My Skull\" illustration book spinoff I worked on in 2009 (abandoned but maybe I'll manage it someday). I'm excited that the books lived up to the hype I had created in my own mind, and that I'm finally able to share them. Toys was published by the legendary Joseph Knebel. A biography of Narbut from wikipedia: Heorhiy Narbut (Ukrainian: Георгій Іванович Нарбут, 1886 in Narbutivka — 1920 in Kiev) was a Ukrainian painter. He is known for creating Ukrainian coats of arms, banknotes, postage stamps, charters, and his many illustrations in books and magazines. He is also known as Georgy Narbut and George Narbut. He was a brother of a noted Russian Acmeist poet Vladimir Narbut. [...] At about age 20, Narbut settled in Saint Petersburg from 1906 to 1917. There he studied with painters Ivan Bilibin and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky. In 1909, Narbut continued some of his studies in Munich, in the school of Simon Hollósy. After his return to Saint Petersburg he joined the organization Mir iskusstva. In 1910-1912 Narbut was an illustrator of the fairy tales Hans Christian Andersen, the fables of Ivan Krylov, and folk tales. In March 1917, Narbut moved to Kiev. In September 1917, he became professor and rector of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts. During this time he created his Ukrainian banknotes, postage stamps and charters for the newly created Ukrainian National Republic. Narbut also worked on the Ukrainian magazines: Nashe Mynule (Our past), Zori (Stars), and Sontse Truda (The Sun of Work) among others. He died of typhus in 1920.

Bio from wikipedia:Carlos Mérida (1891 – 1984) was a Guatemalan artist who was one of the first to fuse European modern painting to Latin American themes, especially those related to Guatemala and Mexico. He was part of the Mexican muralism movement in subject matter but less so in style, favoring a non-figurative and later geometric style rather than a figurative, narrative style. Mérida is best known for canvas and mural work, the latter including elements such as glass and ceramic mosaic on major constructions in the 1950s and 1960s.

After studying at the Hongo Yoga Kenkyujo (Hongo Research Institute for Western Art) he entered the Western-style art department of Tokyo Art School in 1919. He was an ardent admirer of illustrator Takehisa Yumeji and poet Kitahara Hakushu. After graduation from art school, he married in 1921 and to support his new family he began to produce illustrations for children for Kodomo no tomo [Child's Friend], a children's magazine published by Fujin no Tomo Sha. In 1922 he became one of the leading illustrators for Kodomo no kuni [Children's Land] from its inaugural issue. In 1923 he published Otogi no tamago [The Fairy's Egg], and in 1925 his first individual exhibition was held in Ginza in the heart of Tokyo. His Ramu-ramu O [King Ramu-ramu] came out in 1926. The following year, with Shimizu Yoshio, Okamoto Kiichi, Kawakami Shiro, and other illustrators contributing to the Kodomo no kuni, Takei formed the Nihon Doga Kyokai (Japan Association of Illustration for Children), as part of the effort to achieve artistic quality in illustrations for children. Following Okamoto's death, Takei succeeded him as critic and selector of illustrations submitted to Kodomo no kuni in 1931. In 1955, he became editorial adviser for the magazine Kinda bukku [Kinder Book]. And about the site that houses 9000 images from the almost 300 issues of Kodomo no kuni: \"This program was created as part of the Picture Book Gallery project of the International Library of Children's Literature to introduce in digital form the story of the picture book genre from its beginnings until the present. The program was designed to reproduce the works contained in the journal Kodomo no kuni [Children's Land] and convert them to digital images, which have been edited and titled and made available to the public as a virtual exhibit.\" Some of Takei's books have been reprinted and are available from amazon.co.jp.

They are both pretty incredible books with not too much overlap. From wikipedia:Leopoldo Méndez (June 30, 1902 – February 8, 1969) was one of Mexico’s most important graphics artists and one of the country’s most important artists from the 20th century. Méndez’s work mostly focused on engraving for illustrations and other print work generally connected to his political and social activism. His most influential work was connected to organizations such as the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios and the Taller de Gráfica Popular creating propaganda related to the ideals of the Mexican Revolution and against the rise of Fascism in the 1930s. Despite his importance in 20th-century artistic and political circles, Méndez was a relatively obscure figure during his life, and remains so afterwards. The reasons for this generally relate to the fact that he believed in working collaboratively and anonymously for the good of society rather than for monetary gain and because the socialist and communist themes of his work fell out of favor with later generations. Despite this, he has received some posthumous recognition with Mexican scholarship considering him to be the successor to graphics artist José Guadalupe Posada. [cont. reading] 1944, from Incidentes Melodicos del Mundo Irracional \"Much as Posada used the calavera, Méndez was able to make political statements by substituting anthropomorphic animals for human subjects in his wood engravings for Juan de la Cabada's book Incidentes Melodicos del Mundo Irracional, published in 1944 by La Estampa Mexicana. In this retelling of a traditional Mayan story Méndez rendered the deceitful leader of the Yucatan animal community as a vulture wearing the white-collar uniform of the bourgeois businessman. When the other animals rise up against the vulture, the story becomes an unmistakable allegory for a Marxist revolution in which the proletariat replaces the bourgeoisie as the ruling class.\"—James M.

The exhibition is broken into three parts corresponding to the three main stages in the history of Soviet Lithuania. The exhibits are arranged chronologically and according to four themes: the children’s book as a mouthpiece for propaganda, the children’s book as a means of sustaining the national identity, the children’s book as a “window to the West”, and the child’s world as it emerges in the illustration of children’s books. Originals of books and illustrations are on view, while the catalogue includes photographs from the period reflecting the lives of children and the atmosphere, and posters which accompanied children’s cultural life. All Lithuanians who experienced a Soviet childhood keep memories of the legendary pair of artists Birutė Žilytė and Algirdas Steponavičius. Today we can discover a new relevance in work by artists who established themselves in the 1960s and 1970s. Steponavičius is the key to understanding the artistic world of the entire generation of contemporary book illustrators. He set a standard for the most talented of his generation and younger Lithuanian graphic artists such as Lidija Glinskienė, Petras Repšys, Aspazija Surgailienė. He was indirectly a teacher for Stasys Eidrigevičius, who matured as an artist in Lithuania before continuing his career after 1980 in Poland. Žilytė, Steponavičius, their contemporaries and younger artists represented the entire epoch of Lithuanian culture which emerges in this exhibition. Thanks again to Rūta for her help!

It Was a Beautiful Day by Monica Tornow Translated by Mahendra Singh Eleven thousand burning chickens — Datari is horrified, burning plumage is devastating the land — Datari weeps. Datari burns. He calls his friend Helge. Helge has become an architect and can’t listen to him anymore. Datari is ablaze. Before his death he wrote an essay about being tired. He was tired when he had to die. When they buried him, Helge could be seen amongst the mourners in the churchyard. She threw a Leghorn into the grave. The others threw flowers. Later on there was a discussion about Datari, a discussion in which certain opinions were aired out. Opinions about this concept he had marked out as tiredness. Helge, a participant in this discussion for the sake of friendship, fell asleep clutching a Leghorn. The leader of the discussion was on the side of the realists…they sleep if or when they are tired. Another said he’d seen better times in the discussion of the meaning of the tiredness-concept — he was from the older generation. Besides, the subject was thoroughly explosive. One thought…thoughts of burning chickens (Wilhelm Busch was quoted). The younger people amongst them sensed the danger of those who play with fire — it could lead to misinterpretations whose consequences were unforeseeable. The discussion’s protocols held firm. Now and then the air around them buzzed with concepts (comparable to burning plumage), many of them quite understandable but nothing that actually led further. It seemed that any hope for rescue must come through a profound, interdisciplinary approach between the older generation and the younger generation and the chickens of thinking. “Good day.” “What would you like?” “A hat.” “How must it be for a hat?” “It was a beautiful day.” “Yes.” That’s how the slovenliness began, when Helge could not find his hat right away. He wanted to buy a new one. The chickens are burning — eleven thousand — Datari, the last witness — was no more. His essay on tiredness will never be published. (The only known publication of this piece was in Manuskripte—literary magazine, #61, 1978, Graz, Austria.) Illustration by Mahendra Singh Body Demons by Monica Tornow Translated by Malcolm Green The green horns have gone again, and even the last of the empty-heads (O) was able to find the exit. I hope this time they'll stay away longer. I have hidden the spear. I had to put on a coat. You can't imagine how cold it gets when a wind sneezes into the room. I gave him two feathers as a parting gift (it's already very late), because he was dying to wear something on his head. Now he calls himself \"Feather-wind-devil.\" They're coming: I already know them from past occasions. They normally stay for 24 hours and keep spinning round and round. They invite their friends, form a circle and flash through your body. The first one had a spear. Every time they come your hands and head turn completely white. Mirror-ears form and they are very hard to locate. Here they are again. The last of them already has an empty head. That's good. A sign that it, the head, will soon drop off. Headless demons, i.e. pure body-demons, don't have much of a chance. Even the longest spear is little help then. On the contrary, the empty heads leave their bodies and run, or rather roll, onto the spear—but that is the state of affairs some 24 hours after they've first appeared. There's no saying whether complications will arise this time. After a thousand and a half days one of them says: he'd like to say something—simply something or other. He says: \"Tudor cottage beams.\" After this his imagination fails him—nothing else comes to mind. The following Tuesday he grows restless again, and wonders whether he might say something else. He thinks, for even if he rarely speaks, he has always thought. This non-speaking cogitator is not a welcome sight among the body-demons. He thinks and says: WHEEL. But that's not enough for him. He quickly takes his word back, lets the spoken be unspoken, and thinks up a new word. A word which would be more fun for him. Because he believes that words—spoken words—have to be fun. Now he says: EXONERATE. That's got to be fun. He divides it into the two words EX and ONERATE (he's afraid of the spoken word ONERATE). He fetches the word back and now he divides it into three: EX ONE RATE—now everything's just fine. He likes EX, likes ONE, and he also likes RATE. He has startled himself. He only wanted to speak one word and now there are three. Three words in a single day. There's no end to it now. Suddenly he feels he's got to speak more and more words: mongoose, watercourse, prosperity, snowdrifts, pipestem, cockchafer. He grows very sad, after so many spoken words he has forgotten to think. He is completely beside himself and keeps speaking words. He is a body-demon.

From Gennifer Weisenfeld's essay \"Selling Shiseido: Cosmetics Advertising & Design in Early 20th-Century Japan\":The 20th-century history of the Shiseido cosmetics company provides a vivid image of the efflorescence of modernity in Japan—reflecting the changing ideals of feminine beauty, the emergence of a vibrant consumer culture, cutting-edge trends in advertising and packaging, and the persistence of cosmopolitan ideals even in the midst of the rise of militarism in the 1930s. This unit draws on Shiseido’s vast archives, focusing on the marketing of concepts of modern beauty from the 1920s through 1943, when wartime exigencies eventually curtailed the promotion of an international aesthetic of worldly chic. [...] There is no Japanese company whose advertising design better represents the aesthetic of cosmopolitan chic seen throughout the visual sphere in early 20th-century Japan than Shiseido. The Shiseido cosmetics company opened its Western-style pharmaceutical business in Tokyo in 1872 and a few decades later, under the banner of its stylish camellia logo and signature arabesque designs, emerged as one of the leading cosmetics manufacturers in Japan, a position it still holds over a century later.

For the same Artia fairy tale series, she illustrated stories by Perrault and d'Aulnoy in 1978 (cheap French reprint here; will feature it someday) and stories from Tibet in 1974. And about the author, from wikipedia: \"Olga Scheinpflugová (1902–68) was a Czech actress and writer. She was a daughter of the writer, journalist and playwright Karel Scheinpflug. In 1935, she married the writer Karel Čapek.\" (I look forward to learning more about her.) from the cover (my copy is worn and dirty) illustrated boards I just wound up with a bunch more illustrated books by Czech artists — Hoffmeister, Pacovska, Serych, Fuka, Stepan, Bednarova, etc. I promise to share some scans before they get absorbed into the hoard.
