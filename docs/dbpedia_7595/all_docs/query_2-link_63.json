        "text": "Nil Antonovych Khasevych (Ukrainian: Ніл Антонович Хасе́вич, (1905-11-25)November 25, 1905, in Dyuksyn [uk] village, Kostopil Raion, Rivne Oblast — March 4, 1952( ), in Suhivtsi (Rivne region) [uk] village, Rivne Raion, Rivne Oblast) is a Ukrainian painter, graphic artist, active public and political figure, member of the OUN and the UHVR. He was also a knight of the Silver Cross of Merit and the Medal \"For the fight in especially difficult circumstances\" [uk].\n\nHis pseudonyms are Bey, Zot, Levko, Rybalka, 333, Staryi, and Dzhmil.\n\nBiography[]\n\nChildhood and youth[]\n\nNil Khasevych was born November 25 (November 12 Old Style) 1905 in the village Dyuksyn [uk] in Volhynia, now Kostopil Raion, Rivne Oblast, Ukraine, in a family of Psalomnyk Anton Ivanovych Khasevych and his wife Theodotia Oleksiivna. The village, according to the old administrative divisions, was Rivne district [uk], Volhynian Governorate, Russian Empire. His brothers Anatoly and Fedir also become priests. Nil also studied at seminary.\n\nBesides his talent for drawing, Khasevych also had a good voice.\n\nIn 1918, returning from Rivne, at the Derazhniansky railway crossing, he and his mother fell under a train. His mother died, and he lost a leg. As Neil could cut a variety of wood crafts, he had fashioned his own prosthetic leg.\n\nEducation and creativity[]\n\nAfter treatment, he attended a workshop of Vasyl Len in Rivne. In 1925, he took an external exam and received a certificate of the Rivne Gymnasium. From 1925 to 1926, he worked as an assistant iconographer. With the money received as compensation for the accident, he used it to study at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. The young man graduated from the graphics department, he studied painting with Professors Miłosz Kotarbiński [pl] and Mieczysław Kotarbiński [pl], and graphics with Professor Władysław Skoczylas.\n\nIn Warsaw, he then worked with a small circle of Ukrainian artists and students in the Academy, who founded the Society Calm (circle) [uk], which included N. Khasevych, P. Andrusiy, V. Vaskivskyy, S. Drychyk, V. Zvarych, Petro Holodny [uk], V. Havryliuk and Petro Mehyk [uk]. From memories of the last about his countryman: Template:Text and translation\n\nIn 1930 he belonged to the student union Zaporizhzhya. Defending a diploma work on the theme Saint Volodymyr, in 1935, Nil received a diploma of higher art education with the right of teaching in secondary schools. With the beginning of World War II he returned to his village. But even in 1931 his painting Laundry was awarded with the Vatican prize, and the next year, his portrait of Hetman Ivan Mazepa won the Warsaw Academy diploma.\n\nReflecting on the specifics of art, Nil Khasevych made a record on February 24, 1933: Template:Text and translation To study this language, Neal Hasevych copied by hand with quill pen the Peresopnytsia Gospel. In the process he mastered the Cyrillic font.\n\nGradually moving from oil painting to graphics prints, he begins to engage engravings, and woodcutting (derevorizamy). In the early 1930s, Neil Hasevych exhibited his work in art salons of Lviv, Prague, Berlin, Chicago, Los Angeles. In 1937, he got a third cash prize at the International Exhibition of Engravings on a wood engraving in Warsaw. For two years, he printed an art album called Book marks of Nil Khasevych. This year, in the American city of Philadelphia, his art album, Ex libris of Nil Khasevych, was released. Nil collaborated with the Ukrainian magazine The Way and Volyn word. The artist tirelessly polished professional skills. His portraits of Prince Volodymyr the Great, bookplate of the president of UNR in exile Andriy Livytskyi, and the series of works in the anthology Woodcuts was highly appreciated by experts. He is compared to Ivan Trush, Heorhiy Narbut, and Vasyl Krychevsky.\n\nActivity in the OUN[]\n\nKhasevych was a successful artist and could easily live with the Crosses of Merit. Nil Khasevych was an active public and political figure, and a member of the Volhynia Ukrainian association [uk] (VUO) from 1935. He was a delegate to the Regional Congress of the VUO in 1935 in Lutsk. He was personally acquainted with Stepan Bandera and other Ukrainian leaders of the national movement. He was a member of the central and regional OUN leadership, and later, he joined the Ukrainian Supreme Liberation Council (UHVR). But the impending world war and the fate put him a choice. Along with the work, he is engaged in social and political activities: he took part in the Volhynia Ukrainian association, and later joined the OUN. Since April 1943, when groups of the UPA were formed in mass, he joined the underground work. He was elected to the central and regional leadership of the OUN.\n\nFrom that time, he began a nomadic life. He worked in the Kriivka [uk], and constantly changed his location because of the constant danger. He was known by the pseudonyms Bay-Zot, Levko, Rybalka, 333, Stary, and Dzhmil. Nil Antonovych was a talented propagandist who led an insurgency printing house. He also worked as an artist and editor, preparing illustrations for satirical magazines of the UPA \"Ukrainian pepper\" and \"Horseradish\", designed the pappus and leaflets for underground publication, and released an album of caricatures. He also worked on projects of flags, seals, forms for insurgents. During 1943 — 1944, he led a political-propagandist unit of the UP \"North\" group, commanded by Klym Savur (real name Dmytro Klyachkivskyy). After the death of his friend and leader, Khasevych remained on combat post for another seven years. His portfolio of the war and post-war era — 150 woodcuts, which was issued overseas in albums as \"Volhynia in the fight\" and \"Graphics in UPA bunkers\" during 1950 — 1952.\n\nIn 1941, he became a member of the Labor Union of Lviv, Ukrainian Fine Arts and worked with the Rivne Magazine \"Volhynia\" with Ulas Samchuk. In Nazi-occupied Lviv in 1942 — 1943, he held an exhibition of Ukrainian artists in which Nil Khasevych exhibited the work of patriotic themes, including \"Sleep, guys, sleep\".\n\nIn June 1948, the Ukrainian Supreme Liberation Council (UHVR) introduced awards for illegals, which earned them with a personal courage. In particular, \"Zot\" created sketches of the Cross of Merit and Cross of Combat Merit and medal \"For the fight in especially difficult circumstances.\" Subsequently, the author was awarded the Silver Cross of Merit and Medal and elected to UHVR from Ukrainian intelligentsia. Few know about who he really was, what he was doing and where he was. He was carried from hiding place to hiding place by bicycle.\n\nCircumstances of death[]\n\nIn 1951, from the capital of Soviet Union, an order was sent \"to suppress anti-Soviet activities\" (Russian: пресечь антисоветскую деятельность) of Khasevych, because the engraving was presented to the delegates of the United Nations General Assembly and foreign diplomats, and then was published in the aforementioned book \"Graphics in UPA bunkers\". To search for the artist, which was established in the inter-oblast task force, led by GB Captain Borys Steklyar. It also included, as captain, Markelov, and Kudrytskyi.

Khutir was surrounded.\n\nKryyivka was equipped at homesteading. The hidden entrance to the cave was located in a barn near the wood. The bunker itself was relatively spacious, had three quarters. Here took place last fight of Khasevych and two rebels who guarded him with gebists.
