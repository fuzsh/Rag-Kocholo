Mucha, Stuart, Narbut, Clément-Serveau and other creators of millions\n\nMoney is beautiful. We pay attention to its denominational value, forgetting that it is also a work of art. Even reputed artists — from the Father of Art Nouveau Alphonse Mucha to the creator of a distinctively American portrait style Gilbert Stuart — were not above \"making money.\" We share the striking designs of banknotes, talk about the creators of millions, and find out which of them have been honored to become a \"bargaining chip\" in the form of portraits on banknotes.\n\nHow Mucha drew money\n\nSketches of the first money, postage stamps, coat of arms and government formsheets for the state of Czechoslovakia(formed in 1918), were created by the famous Alphonse Mucha. His Art Nouveau banknote designs are distinguished by the finest lace weave(at that time, no currency in the world could boast such counterfeit protection), elegant flower patterns, children’s and women’s heads, shades of pink and deep green.\n\nIllustrations: Ivan Dubasov’s money-related works,\n\nless familiar to the public than the works\n\nfor the banknotes, issued in 1961\n\nIn 1923, Mucha, who was a member of the Masonic Lodge(which he officially joined in France in 1898), depicted secret symbols(a hammer, a sun and others) on the 50 korun note(illustration below) — 12 years before Masonic symbols(a pyramid and an eye) appeared on the United States one-dollar bill.\n\nAlphonse Mucha’s daughter Jaroslava became a model for his banknote. The artist was an excellent photographer, and this hobby helped him to create works that are still famous.\n\nUS dollars: let's talk about Washington\n\nThe one-dollar bill owes its \"face\" to Gilbert Charles Stuart(1755−1828). This \"bad egg\" didn’t even finish the portrait of George Washington, but managed to sell 130 of its copies.\n\nBorn in America, Gilbert Stuart spent all his life moving from England to the United States and back, trying to catch good luck and running away from his debt. However, luck was also chasing him. At the age of 22, he had already exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, and after the success of The Skater, his paintings were in higher demand than those by Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds. Nevertheless, this child of fortune managed to squander everything, and once even almost wind up in debtor’s prison.\n\nIn 1795, having settled in Philadelphia, the artist stroke up prestigious acquaintances. He painted several portraits of George Washington, including the famous unfinished Athenaeum.\n\nWhen Stuart died, his wife and daughter were unable to purchase a grave site, and the artist — author of the famous work that we see on one-dollar bills — was buried in an unmarked grave.\n\nGilbert Stuart is considered one of the founders of a distinctively American painting\n\nOne more interesting fact: among the paintings created by Gilbert Stuart, there is a portrait of John Trumbull(1756−1843) who painted Declaration of Independence, which is depicted on the reverse side of the two-dollar bill. A fruity story is associated with this currency note. Although all US federal notes issued since 1861 are still legal tender, there are also notes whose issue has been discontinued or is irregular. This includes the two-dollar bill, which used to be unpopular due to the \"shyness\" of Americans. That’s how much a visit to a prostitute, buying one vote in an election and a bookmaker’s stake cost. That’s why two-dollar bills in one’s wallet revealed their owner’s shady ventures.\n\nThe secrets of Goznak (State Insignia)\n\nIn the USSR, artists made money by remaining unknown and even highly classified. And it was just a while ago when the veil of secrecy was finally lifted. The main monetary artist of the Soviet Union was Ivan Dubasov(1897−1988).\n\nFor his first work, he received 1 billion rubles: the Izvestia newspaper announced a competition for the best of a stamp dedicated to the 5th anniversary of the Soviet regime, and the 25-year-old boy from Odintsovo was declared a winner. He spent prize money to buy felt boots for his mother. At the exhibition of works, the artist was approached by people in civilian clothes and… invited to work for Goznak(State Insignia).\n\nIvan Dubasov has been the creator of the designs of all Soviet money since the 1930s(before that, from 1923 — he created joint sketches with other artists), as well as the coat of arms of the USSR, state awards, postage stamps, etc. He is the author of banknotes of the GDR, Mongolia, Poland, China, Czechoslovakia and Albania.\n\nFor his merits, Ivan Dubasov was awarded the Order of Lenin, in the design of which he had his hand.\n\nWe’ll give you another story connected with Dubasov. \"At the height of the Great Patriotic War, in 1943… they took schoolchildren who completed the 6th or 7th grades… literally off the street… and organized a special trade school of Goznak. The children were fed, given clothes and shoes and for five years meticulously trained to become the unique high-class specialists… The future graphic artists were revealed secrets of designing security papers by the main artist of Goznak — Ivan Dubasov and his deputy Sergey Pomansky, as well as taught classical engraving by artists and engravers Semyon Aferov and Nikolai Mikheev. And they taught seriously, genuinely, sparing no expensive copper plates or the best American engraving tools; the kids studied the history of arts and visited museums.\"\n\nIllustrations: Ivan Dubasov’s money-related works, less familiar to the public than his works for the banknotes, issued in 1961\n\nIn 2014, at the exhibition \"Secret Soviet artists: they created money, documents, stamps, post cards,\" which was held in different Russian cities, the names of Igor Krylkov, Sergei Adrianov, Viktor Yermakov, Yurii Lukianov, Lidiia Maiorova and Tatiana Nikitina were first disclosed. Unfortunately, there was nothing about the out-of-work creations of Goznak artists there.\n\nFrancs without Freemasons\n\nThe list of artists who created sketches for French bills, includes two and a half dozen names. Let’s narrow down to two of them, whose banknotes are as beautiful as Alphonse Mucha’s money-related masterpieces.\n\nUnder the belt of the artist François Flameng(1856−1923), there was the decoration of the Sorbonne, Palais de Justice, the Opera Comique and the expensive Blue Train(Le Train Bleu) restaurant, which was visited by Coco Chanel and Salvador Dalí. The artist’s work is not only elegant genre scenes and exquisite female portraits, but also harsh, realistic canvases about the First World War — too realistic, according to critics of this master, who was the honorary president of the Society of Military Painters.\n\nPortrait by F. Flameng\n\nPortrait by V. Serov\n\nIn 1891, Flameng sketched the designs for a 1,000 franc note which would be the first in France to be printed in four colours. However, it was never put into circulation: the Bank’s management was afraid of the accusations that \"they created special money for rich people\", and the entire stock of notes was destroyed.\n\nThe only thing left were sketches, printing plates and clichés, which were used in 1918 when printing a new stock of notes that had a face value of 5,000 francs and were characterized by a more limited colour range. Exchange inflation!\n\nAnother interesting \"monetary\" artist of France is Henri Clément-Serveau(1886 − 1972). He was born 30 years later than Flameng and tried different styles — ,,, and abstract art. Clément Serveau created several murals, many frescoes and paintings for public buildings.\n\nThe artist illustrated over a hundred books, sketched designs for 42 stamps and banknotes with a face value of 5, 300 and 1,000 francs. His sketches were also used while creating banknotes of some other counties.\n\nKarbovantsi and hryvnias\n\nThe first Ukrainian banknote with a value of 100 karbovanets was issued for the Ukrainian People’s Republic in 1917 by Heorhiy Narbut(1886−1920). It is on this banknote that the trident first appeared — an adapted coat of arms of Prince Volodymyr the Great. The inscriptions on the bill were made in 4 languages(Ukrainian, Russian, Polish and Yiddish).\n\nIn fact, Narbut was a heraldry buff. Hetman Skoropadskyi approved his sketches of a coat of arms and a state seal.\n\nNarbut is also the author of works for 10-, 100- and 500-hryvnia bills of 1918.\n\nHeorhiy Narbut was also a member of the Mir Iskusstva(\"World of Art\") society, a brilliant graphic artist and illustrator. This artist is the author of the first Ukrainian stamps, the creator of the Ukrainian font and the wonderful Abetka(Ukrainian alphabet), as well as the designer of the first Ukrainian military uniform.\n\nThe designer of the two-hryvnia banknote was Vasyl Krychevsky(1872−1952), who, as they say, \"…had a universal talent — was the creator of a new Ukrainian architecture(Ukrainian modern) and an innovative graphic artist.\" V. Krychevsky was one of the founders of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts, and in 1918 developed projects for the Small and Large State Emblems of Ukraine(and was criticized by Narbut for not knowing the principles of heraldry). For many years, the artist’s name remained in the sidelines, and there were no talks of his art — which might resulted from his forced emigration. Times have changed, and in 2013, the 140th anniversary of the artist’s birth was widely celebrated in the country, and in 2017, the National Art Museum of Ukraine presented a retrospective of Fedir Krychevsky, Vasyl Krychevsky’s brother.\n\nThe House of Poltava district council, designed by V. Krychevsky\n\nThe lobby of the House of Poltava district council\n\nVasyl Krychevsky also created a font that is still used on modern Ukrainian coins, and worked as an artist in 12 motion pictures. In 1919, about 300 paintings by the master and his collection of Ukrainian art burned in a fire, and in 1943, during emigration, the suitcases with his works disappeared(some of them ended up in private collections).\n\nThe money we have lost\n\nBefore the introduction of the euro, Belgium used francs with the faces of three artists: 100 francs — impressionist James Ensor, 500 francs — surrealist René Magritte, 1000 francs — expressionist Constant Permeke.\n\nFrance: the 100 francs bill featured a portrait of Paul Cézanne, and before him(1980−1995) — Eugène Delacroix.\n\nNorway: 1000 kroner bill — Edvard Munch.\n\nSwitzerland: 10 francs — Le Corbusier, 50 francs — Sophie Taeuber-Arp, 100 francs — Alberto Giacometti.\n\nItaly: 50,000 lire — sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 100,000 lire — Caravaggio, 500,000 lire — Raphael.\n\nArtists on active banknotes\n\nMexico: on both sides of the 500-peso bill are artists. Spouses Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, along with their paintings, \"appeared\" on money in 2010 — in honor of the Bicentennial of Mexico’s independence.\n\nGeorgia introduced 1 Lari banknote with a portrait of Niko Pirosmani, Armenia — 20,000 Dram with a portrait of Martiros Saryan.\n\nAnd in 2020, the British will get a new 20-pound note. The person whose portrait will be depicted on the bill was chosen by vote. According to a preliminary survey conducted in 2015, among more than 1,000 people,Laurence Stephen Lowry(1887−1976), known for his industrial landscapes with \"matchstick men\" figures and \"sad\" portraits, received 21% of the vote. This person is really outstanding: Laurence Stephen Lowry, whose first exhibition was held when the artist was 52, rejected 5 British awards, including a knighthood and the Order of the British . Nowadays, prices for paintings by this artist consist of more than six digits.\n\nHowever, at the end of the vote, the news broke that \"one of their greatest romantic painters, watercolourists and engravers\" William Turner(1775−1851) outplayed the \"not Sir\" Lowry, and it is his self-portrait and the painting The Fighting Temeraire that will appear on the 20-pound note.\n\nOur art-trip into the \"world of cash\" gave only a slight insight into the topic of artists and money, a topic, rich in adventures, jokes and serious values."
