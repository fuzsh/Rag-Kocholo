        "text": "She was one of the first high-profile actors to reveal her battle with anxiety. Now – as she prepares to break the States – Rebecca Front tells Jane Gordon why talking about mental health is so important\n\nFor someone with such an impressive range of talents – successful writer, comedian, mental-health campaigner and actor – Rebecca Front has managed to remain curiously anonymous. Dressed in a navy cashmere jumper, tailored trousers and white Nike Air Force trainers, when she walks into the library of the Soho Hotel, no one double takes. ‘So sorry,’ she says, apologetic and instantly self-effacing as she greets me. ‘I think I was in the wrong room!’\n\nRebecca’s modesty – I was the one in the wrong room – must surely have contributed to her ability to fly below the radar in the public consciousness. But then so too must the fact that the roles she has played on TV are so diverse: you might remember her, way back in 1994, in the cast of Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge or, more recently, for her eight-year stint as the formidable Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent in Lewis. Probably her most memorable character – and her favourite – is Nicola Murray in Armando Iannucci’s The Thick of It (for which she won the 2010 Bafta TV Award for Best Female Comedy Performance), but in a career spanning three decades she has had parts in everything from War & Peace to Doctor Who, written two books and become outspoken on the mental-health problems she has suffered since she was a child.\n\nBut 55-year-old Rebecca’s anonymity is about to be blown away by her latest role in Iannucci’s ground-breaking (and hilarious) new HBO/Sky series Avenue 5. Set 40 years in the future where cruise ships orbit other planets in space rather than oceans on Earth, Rebecca has one of the central roles – as onboard irritant Karen Kelly – in a cast that includes Hugh Laurie, Josh Gad and Zach Woods.\n\n‘Karen is the polar opposite of me in real life. She is just so out-there, so commanding and in control and confident; whereas I spend my whole life apologising for things that aren’t my fault,’ Rebecca tells me. ‘It became a kind of motto for me and the rest of the cast. I’d say, “I have just got to be more Karen.” And it’s true – I want a bit more Karen in my life.’\n\nArmando Iannucci has been the common thread in Rebecca’s comedy career since she graduated from Oxford (he was a year ahead of her) and it was Iannucci who approached her directly about Avenue 5 and the character he had created especially for her.\n\n‘I got this email from him ages ago, saying he was going to do this new thing and since it was going to be made a couple of miles from my house did I fancy it? I said “yes, please” knowing nothing more about it because I always say yes to Armando. Working with him is always going to be fun, and actually this turned out to be the most fun I have ever had in a job.’\n\nThe fact that Rebecca is such a clever comic actor – and a witty writer, with two accclaimed memoir-cum-essay collections, Curious and Impossible Things Before Breakfast, to her name – is slightly at odds with the anxiety she has suffered from since she was a child, and finally made public on Twitter in 2011. ‘Hey well-known Twitterers. Fancy taking the stigma out of mental illness? I’ll start: I’m Rebecca Front and I’ve had panic attacks’ she posted, with #whatstigma (which was trending within minutes).\n\nThe incident that triggered her claustrophobia, which still stops her from going in lifts or on the Underground, happened on a family outing when she was just seven. ‘It was a hot summer’s day and we were walking up the steps of the tower of Durham Cathedral, and there were so many people that we got stuck. I remember feeling trapped and that sense of rising panic that unfortunately has stayed with me from then on,’ she says.\n\nOne of two children (her older brother Jeremy is also a writer and broadcaster), her parents, the artist Charles Front and his wife Sheila brought her up in a home that was ‘liberally’ Jewish and ‘absolutely’ secure. Apart from the fact that her mother was a ‘bit of a worrier’, she has no idea where the anxiety came from. Although, she reveals in several anecdotes from her childhood, Jeremy did tend to tease her.\n\n‘He created this character called Pixie Nutkin and every night he would tell me terrifying stories. Some nights it would be a combine harvester that got Pixie, some nights a bull would gore him to death,’ she recalls, insisting it wasn’t bullying as Jeremy is a kind, gentle person (they’re very close and have worked together on Radio 4, most recently in the spoof documentary series Incredible Women).\n\n‘Oh yes, that’s true!’ she says. ‘I could be an extrovert but I was also this anxious, introverted child. I think that often the two things go together because you learn to put up a front, don’t you? Excuse the pun. Acting almost always draws people with that mix, who see themselves as shy and anxious, but love to perform. Part of the joy of the job is playing the characters who are completely unlike you.’\n\nThe stability of her marriage to TV producer Phil Clymer – they have been together for over 30 years and married ‘for something like 22, I lose track’ – has been important in keeping her grounded. The couple live in north London with their children Oliver, 20, and Tilly, 18 (both now studying at uni), and Bailey their Cockerpoo, bought two years ago to fill their empty nest.\n\n‘Phil is just a remarkable bloke, very special, very kind, unbelievably supportive, a truly generous soul and a wonderful father,’ Rebecca says, adding that later this evening she will be meeting him for a ‘date night’.\n\nThere is a real sense that Rebecca is now very much in charge of her life and her anxieties thanks to therapy (she has a CBT ‘reboot’ about every 18 months and keeps a notebook by her bed which she uses as a diary to monitor her worries). She remains active in supporting mental-health charities such as Mind and Anxiety UK and is rather proud of the fact that she was one of the first high-profile celebrities to come out about their mental-health difficulties. ‘I genuinely don’t know anybody who is completely grounded – everybody has got some weird thing; we are all somewhere on the spectrum of obsession and anxiety,’ she says.\n\nThere is no doubt, too, that she has got a bit more Karen Kelly in her life, and has just revamped her wardrobe with Tilly as her stylist (her favourite shops are & Other Stories, Margaret Howell and Zara). In fact Rebecca, who is ‘cautiously accepting’ of the ageing process (‘What is the alternative, never getting to be old?’), is up for taking on new challenges. She goes to the gym three times a week, walks four miles a day with Bailey – and talks rather longingly about the possibility of ‘doing Strictly’.\n\n‘The only thing that puts me off is the live aspect – some years ago I did a dance thing live on Comic Relief and I remember being terrified in my trailer and texting Phil and saying “If they ever ask me to do Strictly remind me of this.” But you know, maybe one day…’\n\nAvenue 5 is on Wednesdays at 10pm on Sky One and NOW TV"
