        "text": "The Day Today (1994) is a surreal British parody of television current affairs programmes, created by Armando Iannucci and Chris Morris.\n\nMain series\n\n[edit]\n\nMain News Attack [1.1]\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Morris: The headlines tonight: Bottomley refreshed after three days on cross. Branson's clockwork dog crosses Atlantic floor. And sacked chimney-sweep pumps boss full of mayonnaise.\n\n[The main titles play for the first time]\n\nChris Morris: Welcome! On The Day Today tonight: David Owen emerges shattered from Oliver Reed...\n\nDavid Owen: I don't think I've ever seen anything quite such... so totally wanton and ghastly... mess, terrible...\n\nChris Morris: And Portillo's wife defends crack habit.\n\nAn old man: It's cheap, very cheap.\n\nChris Morris: Hello, you.\n\n[An interview with Janet Breen about the London Jam Festival]\n\nJanet Breen: To get all the celebrities to contribute their jam has really been quite a... quite an operation.\n\nChris Morris: How much of your time did you put into it?\n\nJanet Breen: Oh, I would say at least about six months.\n\nChris Morris: Six months? To raise money for a jam festival? Isn't that rather stupid?\n\nJanet Breen: [taken aback] No, I don't think so. I mean, it's all in a good cause.\n\nChris Morris: Good cause, yeah, but how much are you gonna raise?\n\nJanet Breen: Well, we hope to raise, um, at least £1500.\n\nChris Morris: £1500?! That's a pathetic amount of money. You could raise more money by auctioning dogs!\n\nJanet Breen: Well, I don't think so. I-I-I think it's all in a good cause and very worthwhile...\n\nChris Morris: You persuaded these celebrities to waste their time donating to it?\n\nJanet Breen: Yes!\n\nChris Morris: Well, who?\n\nJanet Breen: Uh, er, Glenys Kinnock we've got, and Sebastian Coe...\n\nChris Morris: I hate Sebastian Coe!\n\nJanet Breen: Well... I feel he's made a very worthwhile contribution!\n\nChris Morris: What, to the paltry sum of £1500?\n\nJanet Breen: Yes!\n\nChris Morris: Is that worth six months of your time?\n\nJanet Breen: Well I think it is quite-!\n\nChris Morris: I don't think it is at all! I think the only reason you've done it is to make yourself look important! [Janet is appalled] How dare you come on this programme and say \"Hey look at me, I'm raising £1500 for the homeless\"? You could raise more money by sitting outside a tube station with your hat on the ground, even if you were twice as ugly as you are, which is very ugly indeed!\n\n[Janet breaks down sobbing]\n\nChris Morris: Lets see if we can nail this down. In terms of this elastic band here... (twangs an elastic band) Would you like to see the law tightened up to this tightness, tightness number one... tightness number two... or tightness number three?\n\nMan: I think tightness number three.\n\nChris Morris: Tightness number three, like this?\n\nMan: I think we've really got to hammer these guys.\n\nChris Morris: So that tightness being... an average Post Office band, extended over about eight inches.\n\nMan: Yeah, I think so.\n\nAlan Partridge: I don't know what this man is playing at! There's no way... surely the judges must come down like a ton of bricks on that. Carrying bikes on the top of a car is not a sportsmanlike way to run this race.\n\nAlan Partridge: Thank goodness, actually, they're wearing gloves, because I've witnessed bare-knuckle boxing... in a barn in Somerset, about three years ago. And it was a sorry sight to see men goading them on in such a barbaric fashion. And I'm rather ashamed to say I was party to that goading. And, er, two men fighting as I saw in that barn that night, naked as the day they were born, and fighting the way God intended. Wrestling, at points, I don't know if you've seen Women In Love, that marvellous scene by the fire. It, er, kind of resembled that.\n\nSylvester Stewart: A strong and highly long-lasting day tomorrow, with hail aimed vertically downward from above, and there'll be a thirty percent chance.\n\nRosy May: Scientists in Alaska have found a gap between the horizon and the Earth. The gap, which is nine miles across, is believed to have been caused by recent storms which tore the horizon from its moorings. A team of civil engineers has now set off to lash the horizon back down with steel.\n\nChris Morris: ...and since we've recorded that report, everybody featured in it has lost their hair.\n\nVoiceover: The Day Today: slamming the wasps from the pure apple of truth.\n\n[About Attitudes Night]\n\n[\"Hanging from Studio B12\", 1953]\n\nCorin Piper: Well, here we are at the hanging. It's a very sombre atmosphere. The condemned man has just arrived with executioner, Mr. Albert Marsh, who's highly respected...\n\nChris Morris: [narrating] The evening begins with a chance to savour again Great Britain's last televised hanging.\n\nCorin Piper: ...he's using a nylon-hemp mix rope tonight for the first time ever. That what he wanted, that's what he's got. It's to guarantee extra strength.\n\n[\"Frampton Row\", 1962]\n\nStan: Arright Madge, what can I do yer for?\n\nChris Morris: [narrating] The sixties saw television breaking taboos again and again, with \"Frampton Row\" the first popular weekly serial to use swear words.\n\nMadge: ...I'm not made of money, 'specially not since Eddie Copsie and 'is bloomin' lids.\n\nStan: Oh, aye.\n\nMadge: Go on then I'll 'ave the Express. (hands over money) There y'are, yer big hairy cock.\n\nStan: Ta.\n\nMadge: Tarah, Stan. (walks off)\n\nStan: Tarah, yer shitter.\n\n[\"Scrutineer\", 1968]\n\nPresenter: These days, it's very fashionable among young people to do what I'm doing now. I'm being fellated by a young girl known as a groupie. It's an interesting feeling, and, er, certainly quite relaxing...\n\n[Fade to some time later]\n\nPresenter: Well, it's half-an-hour later. My initial reaction was one of intense joy, but that's now been replaced by a vague feeling of indequacy and gloom. It's not an experience that I can see catching on, but, er, neither is it one which I regret.\n\nChris Morris: Time now for business with Collately Sisters.\n\nCollately Sisters: Thanks, Chris.\n\nChris Morris: [off-screen] Take her off the monitor, I don't want to see her face.\n\nCollately Sisters: There was better news for Edge-Ledge-Wedge-Barge, who mustered 2.41, up 88 very slightly, but OxyMacGee flew back a ninth, despite a creeping bid from Connected Breathdumps, at four. On now the currency markets, how did the Pound fare? A quick glance at the currency cat... not too well I'm afraid. There's a disconcerting 47° slope against the Dollar, Yen and Deutschmark, and if we project in four months the Pound leg is effectively amputated, leading to a rogue leg with no hip constituency at all.\n\nIggy Pop Barker: Physical complaints like the hardened lump on this woman's foot are treated as symptoms of spiritual disorder.\n\nDoctor: I'm going to make an incision here. And make the incision all the way round here, round the other side. And then cut through and then remove this. This foot. Remove that and take it away and bury it with some gooseberries.\n\nIggy Pop Barker: Dr. Philip Johanssson is Europe's leading practitioner of bile chanting. He was one of the four doctors and ten patients killed in this morning's blaze. Firemen say the chance of finding anyone else alive is minimal.\n\nRemedy Malahide: Photo-factuality now, and Mrs. Mandy Hell captured these snaps while out walking her brother on Wandsworth Common. The unnamed woman had been pierced by a shaft of frozen urine, which had fallen from the toilet facility of an overhead plane.\n\nChris Morris: What he didn't know was that he [Farmer Chester Johnson] and Lindsey were about to make a flight neither them would ever forget, even if their brains were erased with mind rubbers.\n\nChris Morris: Just time to have a quick look at tomorrow's headlines. \"Aristocrat's Dung Saves Village from Flood\", that's in the Mail. Today: 'Drowned Italian Wins Eurovision'. The Express go with 'Lord Mayor's Pirouette in Fire Chief Wife Decapitation'. Grisly but gripping. The Sun, 'Robin Cock!' And the Daily Star - '\"Feel My Nose and Put My Specs There,\" Roars Drunken Major.'\n\nThe Big Report [1.2]\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Morris: The headlines tonight: Portillo's teeth removed to boost Pound. Exploded cardinal preaches sermon from fish tank. And where now for man raised by puffins?\n\nSylvester Stewart: Devon and Cornwall should have some fairly heavy and prolonged showers, a bit like jagged metal piercing old flesh.\n\nCollately Sisters: And it was a rather cowy night for the pound: It stood at 3.79 against the German Bordello, that's up .5 against the Portuguese Starling and down a hundred against the Bitch.\n\nCollately Sisters: Here at home, from tomorrow the new Bank of England five pound note comes into circulation. The notes, which feature the head of Iggy Pop, can only be used once. (rests her head on the desk)\n\nChris Morris: Thanks, Collately. Coming up: Bosnian old woman...\n\nAlan Partridge: Two to look out for, number one there - \"Zeinab Badawi's Twenty Hotels\", and number three, \"Two Headed Sex Beast\".\n\nAlan Partridge: Not sure what that is, hope it's, er... (chuckle) ...hope it's not a dead horse. They're not going to fit it in the back of a Volvo 340. [beat] Actually, I hope it isn't a dead horse... sorry.\n\nChris Morris: The American actor Marlon Brando has been sold today in an auction at Sotheby's. Brando, who starred in films like Apocalypse Now and Superman, was part of a sale of international works of art which attracted interest from all over the world. He was sold in the large wooden chair he has occupied for the last three years to the Vatican, at just under the expected price of two and a quarter million dollars. It's believed he will be installed in St Peter's later next month.\n\nVoiceover: The Day Today: aware that while the world looks round, it is in fact a cube. And from this we know that 'Fact' times 'Importance' equals NEWS.\n\nChris Morris: A week of foul-tempered debate in Europe ended this afternoon as finance ministers agreed new quota rates for trade with the United States. In Brussels is our economics correspondent, Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan - Peter, what is the new rate?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: It's 30 percent, Chris. Agreement was a long time coming, but in the end the decision was unanimous.\n\nChris Morris: What was the Germans' reaction, because they've been holding out for 40 percent, haven't they?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: That's right. When I spoke to finance minister Reinhardt earlier today, he said he didn't like the deal, but he had to go along with it.\n\nChris Morris: Really? You spoke to him yourself, you managed to pin him down? He's a pretty tricky man, isn't he?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: That's right.\n\nChris Morris: Where did you get hold of him?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: He was in the hotel.\n\nChris Morris: And you conducted a conversation with him about the quota rates?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: That's right - he said he didn't like it, but he had to go along with it.\n\nChris Morris: [beat] What language did you conduct this conversation in, Peter?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: [beat] German.\n\nChris Morris: [beat] You spoke to him about the technicalities of the deal in German?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Yes.\n\nChris Morris: So what's the German for 30 percent?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: [beat] Trenter percenter.\n\nChris Morris: Dreißig prozent?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Yes.\n\nChris Morris: And what about that quote you attributed to him, \"I don't like it but I'll have to go along with it\"?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: That's what he said.\n\nChris Morris: How did he say it?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: \"I don't like it, but I'll have to go along with it.\"\n\nChris Morris: In German, how did he say it?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Ich... nichten lichten...\n\nChris Morris: Presumably you mean \"Rufen Sie ein Taxi bitte sonst verpass' ich meinen Flug\"?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Yes!\n\nChris Morris: No you don't, Peter, because that means \"Get me a taxi; I'm late for my plane!\" Now I'm going to ask you a question: did you speak to the German finance minister about the new deal this afternoon?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: [defeated] No.\n\nChris Morris: And what was his reaction?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: I don't know.\n\nChris Morris: Peter, thank you.\n\n[Rok TV]\n\nHarfynn Teuport: The work of he's-a-singer Bob Dylan is to be reappraised following the discovery of a filum which shows several of his songs including the classic \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", being sung as long ago as 1947 by the singer/songwriter George Formby.\n\n[Outtake from \"Underpants\", 1947]\n\nHarfynn Teuport: Dylan, who is in hospital after eating a rotten wolf, has so far been unavailable for comment.\n\nIan Curtis: [a skeleton swinging on a rope] Hello, Ian Curtis here, I watch Rok TV every day!\n\nHarfynn Teuport: That's the news where it's gone, time now for Suki Bapswent with her special brand of things.\n\nSukie Bapswent: What-ho, I'm Sukie Bapswent!\n\nHarfynn Teuport: Mm!\n\nSukie Bapswent: Uh-oh, now go 'wow' for the latest sounds from Nirvana! They've been commissioned to do the music behind the new Panty Smile sanitary products campaign. Okay boys, hit me with those ultra-pads!\n\nKurt Cobain:\n\nOnce a month / You'll become a slave\n\nTo a tidal wave / Yeah\n\nBody's little clock / Could mess up your frock\n\nBut Panty Smile's a lovely thing\n\nIt absorbs every thing\n\nChorus\n\nYou can wear them / In the high street\n\nBody contours / Very discreet\n\nAnd the comfort / You won't be-lieve\n\n'Cause the topsheet / Is a dryweave\n\nYeah. Panty / Yeah / Smile\n\nPanty / Yeah / Smile\n\nPanty / Yeah / Smile\n\nPanty / Yeah / Smile\n\nVoiceover: Panty Smile. A Comfy Pal who says Never Mind.\n\nChris Morris: 'Arafat Ablaze in Kerosene Oyster Hell', that's in The Telegraph.\n\nMeganews [1.3]\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Morris: The heads tonight: Teenage boy roasts himself in sacrifice to Chris Kelly. [Michael] Heseltine fading fast. And headmaster suspended for using big faced child as satellite dish. This is the news!\n\nMr Hennety: What's goin' on 'ere? This is supposed to be a high-class bureau de change! Not some two-bit Punch and Judy show down on the seafront at Margate!\n\nChris Morris: We're pushed for time, can you sum it up in a word?\n\nSpartacus Mills: No.\n\nChris Morris: A sound?\n\nSpartacus Mills: Woouueerrrr.\n\nChris Morris: Spartacus, thank you. Alan, Sport.\n\nAlan Partridge: Thanks, Chris. Well, as I said, it really was -\n\nChris Morris: Shut it, Alan - I want you to stop! All programmes have now been suspended on all channels to allow the broadcast of this film, held in reserve for times of crisis...\n\nVoiceover: This is Britain, and in this glittering sea, this perfect fusion of man and mineral, we know that conflict will always perish in the brotherhood of flags.\n\nMr Hennety: Look, I never thought I'd say this, right, but... pull down the blinds! I'm closing the bureau - for an hour.\n\nReporter: In an airjam there's a 3-D gridlock in the air and no way out: The planes just slow down and stop. It's been known for years that an airjam could happen, but no emergency measures were ever made. The last-minute efforts of Transport Secretary John MacGregor this afternoon did little to help.\n\nClown: Is he always breaking things?\n\nReporter: The irony is, that while these people lie around like the dead, those in the air will actually die, and end up like the ratatouille these people ate at the canteens which are responding to strong demand at the moment here.\n\nAlan Partridge: [in a locker-room] The atmosphere here hangs heavy, like a big smell. The smell of men together. The smell of cats' musk. Bob Mariner! You missed the penalty, why?\n\nBob Mariner: Yeah, Alan, it was a bad one. It took the top of me boot, it was all over in an instant.\n\nAlan Partridge: You looked really stupid.\n\nVoiceover: A FACT: alone and tumbling through infospace. Without help, it could vanish forever... because only THIS [The Day Today] can make it a NEWS.\n\nJacques-'Jacques' Liverot: If we could see politics, what would it look like? A cube... but with all its corners on the inside.\n\nJacques-'Jacques' Liverot: If democracy is a bra, then the monarchy are breasts. And we cannot imagine a society without breasts. Hélas.\n\nNight Watchman: I'm never tempted to use the pool myself at night. Although some time ago I used to go down and take showers. And on one occasion I went down to the pool and found a woman's swimming costume. Which I put on, and paraded around singing a song... a Joan Baez protest song.\n\nNight Watchman: Well, I would say this - I've been working here for 18 years, and in 1975 no one died. In 1976, no one died. In 1977, no one died. In 1978, no one died. In 1979, no-one died. In 1980... some one died. In 1981, no one died. In 1982, there was the incident with the pigeon. In 1983, no one died. In 1984, no one died. In 1985, no one died. In 1986... I mean, I could go on.\n\nChris Morris: Just time for a quick look at tomorrow's headlines. Today: '\"You Could Blow Notes Across the Holes in His Head,\" Says Sinatra Doc.' The Herald Tribune go with '\"Boiled Dog Could do Maths,\" Claims Experimenter'. The European: 'Elastic Song Strangles Hucknall'. The Daily Telegraph and other broadsheets feature tabs here down the side for ease of turning the pages. And The Independent go with '\"Portillo's Face Felt Like Guts\" Says Girl'. That's it, just to let you know the police are still looking for the actor Burt Reynolds, after he stole a dodgem and drove it out of a fairground in Islington. The fifty-nine-year-old American eluded capture after a low speed car chase, and was last seen heading north on the M11 near Saffron Walden.\n\nStretchcast [1.4]\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Morris: The headlines tonight: NATO annuled after delegate swallows treaty. \"I'm so sorry,\" yells exploding cleaner. And bearded cleric in oily chin insertion. Those are the headlines - God, I wish they weren't.\n\nChris Morris: Spiders will never speak, insists ambassador.\n\nChris Morris: It's just been anno - yeah, thanks... it's just been announced there's to be an special inquiry into the Government's handling of the Frome shipping deal, which flew to pieces last month amid allegations of gross ministerial misconduct. Our economics correspondent Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan is with the Minister for Ships Michael Crane; he's just prised him out of an emergency meeting.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: I'm with the Minister for Ships, Michael Crane MP...\n\nChris Morris: [in voiceover drowning out Peter] That's right, Peter, everything I've just said comes spewing straight back out of your stupid slab of a face...\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: ...Mr Crane, choppy waters for the Government?\n\nMichael Crane: Not at all, Peter. This procedure was entirely proper, and I think the inquiry will prove that the Government's handling of this matter was entirely proper.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: So the Government's ship back on course?\n\nMichael Crane: Absolutely.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Back to you, Chris.\n\nChris Morris: Peter, what the hell was that? This man's made a big scale cock-up here, you let him get away with it! Now let me speak to him. Put your ear-piece next to his head and stand still. Now, Minister! There's reason to believe that you lied to the House. How do you answer that?\n\nMichael Crane: Well that is a very serious and unfounded allegation, and I will be making a statement to the House based on the preliminary inquiry next week.\n\nChris Morris: A week is a long time in politics.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Rab Butler.\n\nChris Morris: Shut up, Peter. Now Minister, did you or did you not lie to the House?\n\nMichael Crane: I will be making a full statement to the House next week.\n\nChris Morris: It's a simple question, yes or no! Did you or did you not lie?\n\nMichael Crane: ...I, erm...\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: As the Minister for Ships sprawls on the pin, it's back to you Chris!\n\nChris Morris: No it isn't, Peter! He's about to answer the question! He's about to admit to lying to the House! You've let him get away again! Where's he gone?!\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Over there...\n\nChris Morris: Well get him back!\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: He's in a cab.\n\nChris Morris: Peter, you've lost the NEWS!! What are you going to say?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Sorry.\n\nChris Morris: Look like you mean it! Look down at the ground and say sorry!\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: I'm sorry!\n\nChris Morris: Peter, next time you cross the road, don't bother looking!\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Sorry...\n\n[Alan Partridge's World Cup Countdown to '94]\n\nAlan Partridge: TWWWAT! That was liquid football!\n\nAlan Partridge: And... SHIT!! Did you see that? He must have a foot like a traction engine!\n\nAlan Partridge: Eat my goal! The goalie has got football pie all over his shirt.\n\nVoiceover:The Day Today: because fact into doubt won't go.\n\nChris Morris: (motions for the camera to come forward) And we've just heard that areas in three of Britain's biggest cities are being evacuated due to suspect dogs.\n\nEugene Fraxby: It was over in seconds. A dog and three people dead from guns. Being old, they would have died soon anyway, but the dog, which contained no explosive at all, was shot to ribbons in its prime.\n\nChris Morris: The only way police can neutralise bomb-dogs is to spray them with a resin coating which hardens instantly to contain any explosion. The inside of the bomb-dog is obviously destroyed, but the outside stays the same shape. However, if the underside is not covered, a highly directional blast launches the animal vertically to a height of over a thousand feet.\n\nEugene Fraxby: The Prime Minister put on a brave face, but for many, like Tory whip Peter Goodwright, the time for calm words is over.\n\nPeter Goodwright: ...an absolute f(BANG) disgrace. These inhuman shit-for-souls (BANG)ers have no place here; in my considered opinion, they are c(BANG)!\n\nChris Morris: Sinn Féin have so far denied they are backing the campaign. Earlier today I spoke to their deputy leader, Rory O'Connor, who, under broadcasting restrictions, must inhale helium to subtract credibility from his statements.\n\n[Interview]\n\nChris Morris: So, what's your initial statement?\n\nRory O'Connor: (inhales helium from a tank) These incidents are inevitable, given the position of the British Government.\n\nChris Morris: You support this campaign, then?\n\nRory O'Connor: The IRA have been forced into this position.\n\nChris Morris: So you do support this campaign of violence.\n\nRory O'Connor: (inhales helium) The IR - (inhales more helium) Sinn Féin is a legitimate political party.\n\nChris Morris: Which supports terrorist action!\n\nRory O'Connor: Your tone is antagonistic and you're making me very angry!\n\n[Back in the studio]\n\nChris Morris: And since we conducted that interview, all sides in the conflict have had a meeting, and have sorted everything out.\n\nRosy May: An international ban on the hunting of waves has finally been introduced. Waves have been used for centuries to pull cars in small countries, but are now facing extinction.\n\nRosy May: My milk is green, come drink me.\n\nChris Morris: The Libyan leader Colonel Gadaffi has plunged southern Europe into crisis by kidnapping Crete and towing it to a secret location off the Libyan coast.\n\nJacques-'Jacques' Liverot: An old man stands naked in front of a mirror, eating soup. He is a fool.\n\nInterviewer: So how do you explain the case of Keith Philips, who returned from his out-of-body experience as a woman?\n\nSceptic: He didn't.\n\nInterviewer: But we filmed it this afternoon, there's an awful lot of evidence to show what happened.\n\nSceptic: No, there isn't.\n\nJacques-'Jacques' Liverot: An optimist sees half a pint of milk. He says 'It is half full'. A pessimist sees half a pint of milk. He says 'It is half empty'. I see half a pint of milk, I say 'It is sour'.\n\nMagnifevent [1.5]\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Morris: The headlines tonight: Euro MPs' new headsets play the sound of screaming women. Bryan Ferry bathmat poisonous say lab. And bouncing elephantiasis woman destroys central Portsmouth. Those are the headlines - happy now?\n\nChris Morris: As City markets crashed and flew off, the government tried to stabilise the economy with an emergency currency based on the Queen's eggs, several thousand of which were removed from her ovaries in 1953 and held in reserve.\n\nChris Morris: It's been revealed that the junior treasury minister Michael Portillo carries a sawn-off shotgun to constituency meetings, corners children in parks and chews their cheeks, and has frequent sexual intercourse with stray animals, claiming \"As long as it's got a backbone, I'll do it\". That story we reported last week, and have since discovered it to be untrue.\n\nTravis Daveley: I have this little dream whereby there's this whole village of reanimated corpses, and if you like, a kind of control tower at the centre of that village with a bank of monitors, and I control all the corpses.\n\nBarbara Wintergreen: Why use corpses? Why not normal people? Why don't you just leave things the way they are?\n\nTravis Daveley: Because, because normal people... because I wouldn't have my tower. I want a tower.\n\nJacques 'Jacques' Liverot: A cat meows. A horse neighs. A lion roars. A bird sings. A snake hisses. A human barks.\n\nCollately Sisters: On now to the money markets, and a quick look at the International Finance Arse. As you can see the US and Japanese cheeks started off with a gap of 2.4 but increased trading forced the two together to form a unified arse at around lunch time, which held for the rest of the day. In summary, then: oh no. Chris.\n\nRosy May: The echo from the nuclear bomb which destroyed Hiroshima is set to devastate the city again. Half of the original blast has ricocheted off Jupiter, and will strike Japan in 2041. It's not yet known if the city will be evacuated. I'm Rosy May; tread not on the forest leaves, for you tread on my face.\n\nChris Morris: Today is the anniversary of 1944.\n\nChris Morris: Still to come: Controversy over new Treasury appointment.\n\nMan on doorstep: I'm sick to death of this, all I ever get, \"Treasury, Treasury, Treasury\"! It's all I ever hear. I'm sick of it, I've had enough. Just all of you (beep) off!\n\nJacques 'Jacques' Liverot: A man sees God in his car. He crashes.\n\nChris Morris: I'm joined now by Martin Craste, the British minister with special responsibility for the Commonwealth and Gavin Hawtrey, the Australian foreign secretary in Canberra. Gentlemen, this is pretty historic stuff. Well done. So a future of unbridled harmony then, Australia?\n\nGavin Hawtrey: Yes I think Martin Craste and I can be pretty satisfied, it's a good day.\n\nChris Morris: And if, as in the past, Australia exceed their agreement what will you do about it?\n\nMartin Craste: This is a very satisfactory treaty which I'm sure will work well, naturally if the limits were exceeded then this would be met with a very firm line but I can't see that happening.\n\nChris Morris: Mr. Hawtrey, he's knocking a firm line in your direction. What are you going to do about that?\n\nGavin Hawtrey: Well in that case we'd just reimpose sanctions as we did last year...\n\nChris Morris: Sanctions? Hang on a second they've only just swallowed their sanctions and now they're burping them back up in your face!\n\nMartin Craste: I think sanctions is rather premature talk, certainly if sanctions were imposed we should have to retaliate with appropriate measures, but I can't...\n\nChris Morris: I think 'appropriate measures' is a euphemism, Mr. Hawtrey. You know what it means. What are you going to do about that?\n\nGavin Hawtrey: Well I'll just have to go back to Cabinet.\n\nChris Morris: And ask them about what?\n\nGavin Hawtrey: Well I don't know, maybe it's a matter for the military or...\n\nChris Morris: The military?\n\nMartin Craste: I think military measures is totally inappropriate reaction and I think this is way, way over the top.\n\nChris Morris: It sounds like you're being inappropriate, are you?\n\nGavin Hawtrey: Of course I'm not being inappropriate! Martin Craste knows that full well.\n\nMartin Craste: This is the sort of misunderstanding that I thought we'd laid to rest during our negotiating.\n\nChris Morris: Misunderstanding it certainly is. It's certainly not a treaty, is it. You're both at each others' throats, you're backing yourselves up with arms, what are you going to do about it? Mr. Hawtrey, let me give you a hint: bang!\n\nGavin Hawtrey: What are you asking me to say?\n\nChris Morris: You know damn well what I'm asking you to say! You're putting yourself in a situation of armed conflict! What are you plunging yourself into?\n\nGavin Hawtrey: You'd like me to say it?\n\nChris Morris: I want you to say it, yes.\n\nGavin Hawtrey: You want the word?\n\nChris Morris: The word!\n\nGavin Hawtrey: I will not flinch...\n\nChris Morris: You will not flinch from?\n\nGavin Hawtrey: War.\n\nChris Morris: War! Gentlemen, I'll put you on hold. If fighting did break out it would probably occur in Eastmanstown in the upper cataracts on the Australio-Hong Kong border. Our reporter Dônnnald Bethl'hem is there now. Dônnnald - what's the atmosphere like?\n\nDônnnald Bethl'hem: [on screen] Tension here is very high, Chris. The stretched twig of peace is at melting point. People here are literally bursting with war. This is very much a country that's gonna blow up in its face.\n\nChris Morris: Well gentlemen, it seems that we have little option now but to declare war immediately.\n\nMartin Craste: Well, this is quite impossible. I couldn't take such a decision without referring to my superior Chris Patten, he-he's in Hong Kong.\n\nChris Morris: Good! Because he's on the line now via satellite. Mr Patten, what do you think of the idea of a war now?\n\n[Clip of Patten nodding vaguely]\n\nChris Morris: I'll take that as a yes!\n\nMartin Craste: Very well, i-it's war.\n\nGavin Hawtrey: War it is.\n\nDônnnald Bethl'hem: [an explosion behind him] That's it, Chris! It's war! War has broken out! This is a war!\n\nChris Morris: That's it! Yes, it's WAR!\n\n[The set darkens]\n\nChris Morris: From now on, The Day Today will be providing the most immediate coverage of any war ever fought. On the front line and in your face, Dônnnald Bethl'hem.\n\nJonathan: Standing by, Douglas Hurd. [Hurd is on a television next to him]\n\nChris Morris: The Day Today smart bombs have nose-mounted cameras. This is smart bomb Steven, and that is Susanna Gekkaloys.\n\nSusanna Gekkaloys: I'll be reporting from inside the fight. (runs out of studio)\n\nChris Morris: Like some crazy Trojan! And keeping an eye on everything that's going on out there, at The Day Today News Pipe, Douglas Trox!\n\nDouglas Trox: [manning a flexible plastic pipe coming out of the wall] Chris!\n\nChris Morris: ...but first the weather with Sylvester Stewart.\n\nSylvester Stewart: Let's revolve the weather collar now 70 degrees to the Midlands, where I was first bereaved. And there'll be a large cack of heavy cloud covering the area, but it should stay dry enough for you to dance outside until our lord Beelzebub calls upon us. Now, if we revolve the throat circle back to the West Country, and you can see there'll be several gits of bad weather across most of the sky. Some rain, but no more severe than soft porn.\n\nChris Morris: Back live now, progress on The Day Today smart bomb. Jonathan? [to off-screen] Get rid of Hurd! [Hurd's image is replaced with a POV of a cruise missile] Thanks!\n\nJonathan: Well Chris, as you can see there's the missile, cruising at around two thousand per second trying to locate the target soldier it's aimed at...\n\n[The TV image closes in on a screaming soldier]\n\nJonathan: There's the soldier. It goes in through the mouth. Down through the oesophagus, into the stomach and there's the explosion.\n\nChris Morris: Absolutely bang! That's The Day Today bringing you another tear on the face of the World's mother! Alan! Sport!\n\nChris Morris: The Daily Mail: 'Child Made Of Paint Wins By-election'.\n\nNewsatrolysis / Factgasm [1.6]\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Morris: The headlines tonight: Fist-headed man destroys church. Car drives past window in town. And Leicester man wins right to eat sister. Now fact me 'til I fart!\n\nChris Morris: The American car company General Motors have today announced a cut in their workforce at their plant in Detroit. Our economics correspondent, Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan, is there at the moment. Peter, what's going on?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Chris, it's a mass redundancy measure - it's the biggest lay-off in American industrial history - Thirty-five thousand jobs in one fell swoop, gone!\n\nChris Morris: Thirty-five thousand?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Yes.\n\nChris Morris: Peter, there's only twenty-five thousand people at the plant.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: That's right Chris, mass redundancy on an unprecedented scale!\n\nChris Morris: Well would you mind telling me how the plant can function on minus ten-thousand workers?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: [grinning] I don't know, Chris, you tell me!\n\nChris Morris: I'll tell you what, Peter, you mean thirty-five hundred workers have been sacked.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: [beat] No. Thirty-five thousand, it's all here. (he checks his notes)\n\nChris Morris: Let me see what you've got down there.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: It's thirty-five hundred, you're right, I've made a mistake.\n\nChris Morris: Peter, I want to s- I want to see it. I don't want to hear anything more out of your mouth, I don't believe it. Now show me your notes.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: No.\n\nChris Morris: Yes!\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: It's thirty-five hundred.\n\nChris Morris: Show me, I don't believe what you're saying, I just want to see the numbers. Now hold them up! (he holds them up briefly) Hold them up and keep them up! (he does) And rotate them a hundred and eighty degrees in my favour! [as he does] Do it... Peter, what's that? (taps the monitor)\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: I don't have the monitor, Chris, I can't see what you're doing.\n\nChris Morris: You know what I'm talking about, it's just above your right eye. (Peter points at a doodle) Yes.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: A cobweb.\n\nChris Morris: And how's a cobweb going to dig you out of your numerical mess?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: I don't know.\n\nChris Morris: Peter, you're lying in a news grave. Do you know what's written on your headstone?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: \"News?\"\n\nChris Morris: [finally] Peter, thank you.\n\nJacques-'Jacques' Liverot: What... is a 'gay'?\n\nChris Morris: Gay Desk now with Colin Poppshed.\n\nColin Poppshed: Thanks Chris. Quick roundup of today's gayness, starting with the roads: The M70, the A3, the B664 and the A48(M), they are all gay as of midnight tonight. The gay elements are potassium, zinc, hydrogen, copper, and argon. A quick look at the world's walls: The Wailing Wall is gay, Hadrian's Wall is very gay, the Great Wall Of China, that's not gay, and the Old London Wall has also stopped being gay. Gay cars next, they're the same as last night: all Volkswagens registered between 1982 and 1985, they stay gay for another fortnight. And finally, the gay seas are the Caspian and the Mediterranean... so, see you there. Chris...\n\nChris Morris: Thanks, Colin. He's not gay, by the way, we wouldn't employ a homosexual.\n\nChris Morris: Coming up: Clinton welcomed home after machine-gunning 400 buffalo.\n\nTokyo Correspondent: Thanking you live from Tokyo, where it's three-thirty in the morning. That's minus seven in new Japanese time. In just seven hours, the first of thirty full-size duplicate Japans will be switched on, and all clocks will be reset to 00000. The new Japans have been three years in construction, involving perfect replication of cities and people and children. The raft of new countries, which extends over five thousand miles into the Pacific, has been hidden until now, but was spotted yesterday from an aeroplane. Japan has so far refused to comment.\n\nItalian Correspondent: The Vatican realised the computer had been tampered with when they discovered that Jesus had died of food poisoning aged nineteen, and Lou Reed had been canonised as a saint.\n\nJacques 'Jacques' Liverot: When I drive my car, I am not driving. I am participating in a conspiracy called 'traffic'. I will walk.\n\nOld Man: [reading off a card] This... this is my complaint, right? TV is the most un-kinking, un-happening, un-sussed piece o' sheet in the hood right now.\n\nChris Morris: Look at the lens, please.\n\nOld Man: Oh, sorry. You gotta get it. Totally dis-counture. More in the area. See, I'm talking more ragga, more boogle, more death mental...\n\nChris Morris: Death metal.\n\nOld Man: ...death metal and Belgian house. You hear me? Let's get TV banging, mud-far...... mud-the-far-cuss.\n\nChris Morris: And look at the camera again and nod your head as you say that.\n\nOld Man: Mud-the-far-cuss.\n\nChris Morris: And say that last bit again once more into the camera.\n\nOld Man: Mud-the-far-cuss.\n\nChris Morris: And just time for a quick look at tomorrow's, er... The Independent: 'Bank of England Recovers from Swollen Chairman Unusualness'. The Telegraph go with 'Simon Rattle Lost in Cress'. The Daily Mail, pretty keen on 'Lassoed Bat Wins Booker', they devote four pages to that. The Mirror rather upset: 'Fleetwood Mac Buried in Dog Avalanche'. And Today ride with 'Old Woman Killed by Little Glass Planet'. That's a story there by Andrew Penman. Due to a printing error, tomorrow's Guardian is full of water.\n\nAdditional material\n\n[edit]\n\nPilot Episodes\n\n[edit]\n\nShorts\n\n[edit]\n\nDVD Extra: Live report from 9/11\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Morris: The Day Today 24 Live now stays with those terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, both towers now gone. Later, \"What is a hijacked airliner and how does it crash?\", but first our correspondent Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan is in New York at the moment. He went there to cover the World Trade Organization talks, due to start today at the World Trade Center. He's on the line now. Peter, where are you and what's going on?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: It's a clear, crisp morning in New York, Chris. A crackle of anticipation among the delegates at breakfast. A lot at stake here; these talks could be the big yes or no for the Eastern economies.\n\nChris Morris: Right, Peter. Can you tell us exactly what the situation is currently in New York?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Well, the situation I'd say is eggs over easy for the Germans, eggs over not bad for the Japanese, and eggs over pretty grim for the Russians.\n\nChris Morris: So.. the meetings are going ahead?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: That's right, Chris.\n\nChris Morris: [beat] And where are they being held?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Here, at the World Trade Center!\n\nChris Morris: [beat] You're at the World Trade Center?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: [proudly] Yes!\n\nChris Morris: [beat] Whereabouts exactly in the World Trade Center are you?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: I'm - I'm in - uh... in their restaurant, the Windows on the World restaurant, Chris, floor 107, sipping a cappuccino.\n\nChris Morris: Floor 107 no longer gives a particularly good view of New York.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Well, it does from where I'm sitting, Chris.\n\nChris Morris: It's now part of the basement!\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: [beat] I think you're - hahaha - ah, pulling my leg, Chris!\n\nChris Morris: Are you near a television?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: [beat] Yes... I don't -\n\nChris Morris: I'd like you to turn it on.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: I'm going to a television, in the restaurant. There's one of those - one in the corner.\n\nChris Morris: Yes, just get on with it, please.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Right, the television is on!\n\nChris Morris: Tell me what you can see.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Well, it's... it's quite bizarre, I'm actually looking at an image of the World Trade Center. I'd... almost be looking at myself if I waved. Uh -\n\nChris Morris: What can you see?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Well, there's a... there's a plane in one of them, yeah - actually we didn't hear that! The sound insulation in these buildings is extraordinary! There is a plane - th -\n\nChris Morris: Keep watching, Peter.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Wha - ah. Ah. Oh, my God. Uh, one of the towers has collapsed, fortunately not the one I'm in; the other one - the one I'm in is - is... one of the tow - the - the other tower - the tower I'm in is collapsing! I'm collapsing, Chris, under the sheer... I've managed - I'm out! I'm out! Eh, I'm very for - run... [finally] I'm not there.\n\nChris Morris: Where are you?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: I'm... I'm in a hotel in Midtown. The Marriott. My hotel, in my room.\n\nChris Morris: Why did you say you were at the World Trade Center?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Because... that's where I was supposed to be this morning.\n\nChris Morris: You overslept.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: I'd slept longer than I'd anticipated.\n\nChris Morris: [beat] Would you like to revise your appraisal of the situation in New York in light of which you've just gleaned?\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Yes, I can, Chris.\n\nChris Morris: Go ahead.\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: I'm a man, standing at a window of his hotel room. Very grey day... a very grey day for the world, Chris. Eh... it seems like a movie -\n\nChris Morris: Peter, you've added nothing. That's Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan from New York on a day which will go dow-\n\nPeter O'Hanraha-hanrahan: Yes -\n\nChris Morris: BE QUIET!\n\nDVD Extra: Alan and Chris chat about Diana and JFK\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Morris: Alan!\n\nAlan Partridge: Chris.\n\nChris Morris: What's happened since we last met? Times have truly changed, the world has perhaps changed.\n\nAlan Partridge: Absolutely, yep.\n\nChris Morris: We've had terrorist attacks, we've had wars and a change of government, we've had the accident that killed Princess Diana -\n\nAlan Partridge: Oooh.\n\nChris Morris: We've had Britpop, we've had a whole -\n\nAlan Partridge: W-w-if-i-woahhh-woah. I-IF. IF.\n\nChris Morris: If what?\n\nAlan Partridge: If - and it's a big if - if indeed the, uh, circumstances surrounding the late Princess Diana's... death... could indeed be called an accident.\n\nChris Morris: Well, they're generally accepted to be an accident.\n\nAlan Partridge: Ahhhh! Very telling Mr. Christopher Wallace that you regard this as an accident.\n\nChris Morris: You don't?\n\nAlan Partridge: I think there are many, many unanswered questions, which remain unanswered.\n\nChris Morris: You join a not necessarily distinguished panel in that view.\n\nAlan Partridge: There are many respected people who support the view -\n\nChris Morris: Right, let's leave Mohamed Al-Fayed off the list.\n\nAlan Partridge: Why?\n\nChris Morris: What I'm interested in is the names that add weight to his, rather loose, claims.\n\nAlan Partridge: David Dickinson, from Bargain Hunt.\n\nChris Morris: He believes that Diana was murdered?\n\nAlan Partridge: Yes.\n\nChris Morris: Does he?\n\nAlan Partridge: Yes.\n\nChris Morris: You're not just quoting him from some idle conversation in a pub in which he was humoring you?\n\nAlan Partridge: We're close.\n\nChris Morris: You're close?\n\nAlan Partridge: Yeah. He and I had a chat about it over a pub lunch in Banbury. He did, I mean, I explained the theory, and he nodded.\n\nChris Morris: Alright, Alan, we're at a pub lunch in Banbury - I'll be Dave Dickinson if you want - convince me. How did Princess Diana die, Alan?\n\nAlan Partridge: Well, he wouldn't have said it like that, but, I mean, he was eating scampi - that's not important obviously, but uh, just to provide the detail...\n\nChris Morris: Yeah, alright but let's get on to the bloody accident.\n\nAlan Partridge: Alright. I, David, uh... this may sound cheap as chips! Haha, because that's his phrase, um...\n\nChris Morris: Give me the leading piece of evidence that proves it wasn't an accident.\n\nAlan Partridge: Do you want, err, half a pint of bitter?\n\nChris Morris: I'd love one, later.\n\nAlan Partridge: This is what I actually said to David before I got onto the - I'm just trying to-\n\nChris Morris: Right, okay, so just deliver the main chunk...\n\nAlan Partridge: Right, sure, sure, no probs.\n\nChris Morris: Yep.\n\nAlan Partridge: The Mercedes 500 SL comes, as standard, with four... four to six airbags. 'Kay?\n\nChris Morris: That's it?\n\nAlan Partridge: Hang on, no, I want you to say \"alright then.\"\n\nChris Morris: Alright then, yes, I believe that to be true.\n\nAlan Partridge: Right. Definitely four, as an option you can tick the box for six, you'd lose two in the rear seats.\n\nChris Morris: Any in the boot?\n\nAlan Partridge: No, because no wants to protect luggage in an accident.\n\nChris Morris: Just wanted to be clear on that, it's fine.\n\nAlan Partridge: Although it's not a bad idea, especially in your line of work 'cos they're... antiques.\n\nChris Morris: So how does the six airbag theory prove that she was killed?\n\nAlan Partridge: I saw, in all the press photographs, no evidence of deflated airbags. Why were they gone, Chris- uh, David? Shall I suggest a theory?\n\nChris Morris: Go on.\n\nAlan Partridge: They were removed. By someone, perhaps... a butler.\n\nChris Morris: Prince Charles?\n\nAlan Partridge: I - that's not for me to say. That's for other people to say.\n\nChris Morris: So were you sad to see her go? Is that perhaps why you think it was a conspiracy?\n\nAlan Partridge: Um, no, that's the strange part of it; I was very pleased because, although I believe it was a conspiracy, uh, to get rid of her, I'm not against the idea of state assassination.\n\nChris Morris: So you're saying that basically this is a positive conspiracy. She was killed by design, and that's a good thing?\n\nAlan Partridge: And I also think that President Kennedy should have been shot, because he was very promiscuous.\n\nChris Morris: Right, he doesn't quite follow what you would see is the ideal lifestyle then?\n\nAlan Partridge: I think that it's unhelpful, when you're trying to build a new America in the early 60s, to have sex with Marilyn Monroe. It's not helpful. And therefore...\n\nChris Morris: So let's take you back to 1963, to Dallas...\n\nAlan Partridge: Okay...\n\nChris Morris: You would in fact have shot him?\n\nAlan Partridge: I wouldn't have shot him, but I would certainly have opened the door or held the jacket for the gentleman assassin who pulled the trigger from the book depository.\n\nChris Morris: Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nAlan Partridge: Or, him. Or, someone else. Or, him and someone else. Or, him and someone else and someone else. And the Mafia.\n\nChris Morris: But he was shot.\n\nAlan Partridge: Was he?\n\nChris Morris: You know that!\n\nAlan Partridge: There are those who - do you remember Georgi Markov? Who was stabbed with a brolly in London?\n\nChris Morris: Yeah, and he died. That doesn't influence the fact that Kennedy was shot.\n\nAlan Partridge: The back of his head fell off, on that we're agreed. Are we?\n\nChris Morris: Yeah.\n\nAlan Partridge: That can happen with a bullet, Chris, it can also happen...\n\nChris Morris: But it did happen with a bullet.\n\nAlan Partridge: Yeaaah, that's what they say, but-\n\nChris Morris: Well, not even \"that's what they say\". That's actually what happened, you can see it on the footage.\n\nAlan Partridge: I saw the back of a head belonging to a president fall off. I did not see a bullet. Did you see a bullet, Chris?\n\nChris Morris: Of course I didn't see a bullet.\n\nAlan Partridge: Thank you! No more questions, your honour! Kevin Costner said it loud and clear - and he was there, remember, in the film.\n\nChris Morris: That Kennedy wasn't shot?\n\nAlan Partridge: That th-the facts are the facts are the facts. The same way we say that a crime is a crime is a crime, but with a different subject matter. Just the three times thing is the same.\n\nChris Morris: I think repeating a word until it becomes an abstract noise doesn't really bulk up your case very well.\n\nAlan Partridge: No, but it's a good preface to the substance of what I'm about to say, which is this; the back of the head fell off, thank you, we know that.\n\nChris Morris: Yep.\n\nAlan Partridge: A small explosive device could easily have been implanted in his head, the same way that a brolly was used to inject a pellet of poison into Gerogi Markov on a bridge in London.\n\nChris Morris: So what was the object that penetrated President Kennedy's head in order to implant the -\n\nAlan Partridge: It could have been a brolly! A brolly!\n\nChris Morris: He had a brolly stuck in his head?\n\nAlan Partridge: Yes!\n\nChris Morris: Well, at what point in the Zapruder footage do we see a brolly being stuck in his head?\n\nAlan Partridge: It was a delayed explosive capsule.\n\nChris Morris: Oh, it happened earlier?\n\nAlan Partridge: Yes, when someone was walking past and they bumped into him with their brolly and accidentally stuck it in his head, said \"sorry about that Jack- John...\"\n\nChris Morris: It would have to go in very deep into the middle of his brain! What part of his head could possibly have been entered in order to implant a bomb in his brain?\n\nAlan Partridge: The soft bit on the top of his head, Chris...\n\nChris Morris: He's not a baby, Alan!\n\nAlan Partridge: But some people-\n\nChris Morris: The fontanelle would have close up! Has yours?!\n\nAlan Partridge: Uh, hang on... yeah, no, you're right, no, it has.\n\nChris Morris: Right. No room for an umbrella there.\n\nAlan Partridge: Okay...\n\nChris Morris: Imagine your head is Kennedy's head, tell me how you're going to put a bomb in it.\n\nAlan Partridge: Up his nose. Like they did the Egyptian pharaohs but in reverse.\n\nChris Morris: They didn't bomb their heads!\n\nAlan Partridge: But they pulled them out like a magician's handkerchief.\n\nChris Morris: And that's what happened to Kennedy?\n\nAlan Partridge: In reverse - well, no they didn't-\n\nChris Morris: Bascially, you're seeing a magic trick and something sort of made out of silk...\n\nAlan Partridge: You-y-y-you-\n\nChris Morris: A bomb, a silk bomb going off in his head?\n\nAlan Partridge: You-you say that facetiously but it was -\n\nChris Morris: No I don't! I'm just trying to pursue your point!\n\nAlan Partridge: I-in-in a way it was a kind of a magic trick, perhaps the most frightening and horrible magic trick the world has ever seen.\n\nChris Morris: And what about the second bullet?\n\nAlan Partridge: See how you twisted that?\n\nChris Morris: What made him fall forward?\n\nAlan Partridge: He just lent forward when- in surprise, because he went \"Oooh the back of my head's come off!\" And he lent forward saying \"did you see that?\" and, you know there's lost of reasons why he could have leant forward, perhaps he was trying to change a CD...\n\nChris Morris: A CD in the sixties?\n\nAlan Partridge: There is a lot of evidence-\n\nChris Morris: What the hell would the President of the United States been doing listening to a CD that hadn't even been invented as he drove on a...\n\nAlan Partridge: Wasn't it invented?\n\nChris Morris: Cavalcade through-\n\nAlan Partridge: The FBI knew about CDs for ages!\n\nChris Morris: They didn't even have 8-track cassette players!\n\nAlan Partridge: There's so much about the world you don't know Chris, I mean I know y-you're, you know, you're very y-you're pretty good at your job, but there are so many things that you have to hear, to be - you think the Prime Minister runs England? What a laugh! What a laugh! What a laugh! Does he heck!\n\nChris Morris: Who does run the world, Alan?\n\nAlan Partridge: Trade unions.\n\nChris Morris: Trade unions have been emasculated for over a decade!\n\nAlan Partridge: What about the bloke who runs the firemen? He's quite... dodgy.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Morris - Himself, Ted Maul, other roles\n\nSteve Coogan - Alan Partridge, Alvin Holler, Mr Hennety of \"The Bureau\", other roles\n\nRebecca Front - Barbara Wintergreen, Rosy May, Valerie Sinatra, Ange of \"The Bureau\", other roles\n\nDoon Mackichan - Collaterlie Sisters, Maria of \"The Bureau\", other roles\n\nPatrick Marber - Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan, Jacques-'Jacques' Liverot, Chapman Baxter, Guy of \"The Bureau\", other roles\n\nDavid Schneider - Sylvester Stewart, Brant, Alex of \"The Bureau\", other roles\n\nMichael Alexander St John - Voiceover\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
