        "text": "'He's the man ... The man with the Midas touch'\n\n(I'm Alan Partridge, series 1, ep 4)\n\nReading this on mobile? Click here to view\n\nMy favourite Alan moment is a scene in which he sings the theme to Goldfinger whilst walking along a motorway to buy a bag of windscreen washer fluid from an Esso garage. He seems so happy even though it looks bleak. That's why Alan survives, because he never sees himself as others see him. He has a protective veneer of optimism, even though that may just be a thin crust concealing a hot plasma-core of self-doubt. I think that's a quality Alan would encourage in others: if there's something that bothers you, just ignore it.\n\nArmando Iannucci, Partridge co-creator\n\n'Stop getting Bond wrong!'\n\n(I'm Alan Partridge, series 2, ep 4)\n\nReading this on mobile? Click here to view\n\nMy favourite moment is when he has his Bond breakdown and acts out the opening scenes of The Spy Who Loved Me. When I heard about the movie, as a massive fanboy I was hoping for a cameo. That didn't happen, but my new single is in the film. I think Alan's son has it on his iPod and Alan asks who it is, and his son says \"Example\". And Alan says, \"It's awful, turn it off.\"\n\nExample, rapper and featured Alpha Papa soundtrack artist\n\n'It's good to meet a Royal who has a sense of humour'\n\n(Knowing Me, Knowing You radio series, ep 4)\n\nThe radio incarnation of Knowing Me, Knowing You was all basically amazing. I'll go for the bit when he got to chat to a minor royal. After fishing for a dinner invite, Partridge was keen to know if she'd like to be Queen. She said it couldn't happen. Partridge was sure that it could, so he \"painted her a picture\" – a sequence of grizzly, tragic events that would see her get the top job. Rebecca Front is amazing as the Duchess of Stranraer. Partridge's cheerfulness and lack of tact is death-defying; his tenacity, genuinely admirable. Gold.\n\nTim Key, Sidekick Simon in Mid-Morning Matters and Alpha Papa\n\n'If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before ... No, you probably have' (Knowing Me, Knowing You, series 1, ep 3)\n\nReading this on mobile? Click here to view\n\nI think the Abba medley Steve and I did in Knowing Me, Knowing You tells you everything you need to know about the character. The naffness, the massive overconfidence that gradually ebbs away, the look of fear in his eyes when he realises he's started Thank You For The Music too high and he's never going to make that top note … It's Alan encapsulated, the essence of Alan. Around the time we were rehearsing it, Steve gave me a lift somewhere. The music on his car stereo was Abba. \"It's for research,\" he told me. But I wasn't convinced.\n\nRebecca Front, co-star on The Day Today and Knowing Me, Knowing You\n\n'I was going to tip New Year's Lad, but his horsebox was hit by a Volvo on the M3. Terrible Mess. Apparently he's dead, so bad luck there' (The Day Today, ep 2)\n\nReading this on mobile? Click here to view\n\nWhen Alan is reporting from the races, it's pouring down, he's really up against it, and the camera catches him unawares saying: \"It's his bed, let him lie in it. Let him lie in it.\" And you want to know what that off-camera conversation was about. It's this little window into Partridgeworld. Up until then we hadn't really seen what he was like off-camera: arrogant, dismissive but very human. I love that glimpse of the real Alan Partridge we'd get to see later.\n\nDavid Schneider, co-star on The Day Today, Knowing Me, Knowing You and I'm Alan Partridge\n\nReading this on mobile? Click here to view\n\nMy favourite moment is Alan's supposed apology to the Norfolk Farmers' Union. His exchange with Chris Morris builds in ever ridiculous layers as Alan keeps pushing how ill-informed and offensive he can be in order to avoid saying sorry. It's littered with killer quotable lines such as \"the plums have got beaks\" and \"your wife, who's also your brother\". I was lucky enough to see rehearsal tapes and it was jawdropping how great the stuff was they couldn't fit in to the edited show.\n\nShane Allen, BBC controller of comedy\n\n'I'd just like to fly a helicopter all round Norfolk ... scare a donkey so it falls into a river' (I'm Alan Partridge, series 2, ep 2)\n\nReading this on mobile? Click here to view\n\nThere's a scene when Alan goes to visit Michael, and they're talking about friendship and Alan is clearly really enjoying it. And then it suddenly turns very unpleasant when Michael goes off on a violent fantasy about flying an Apache helicopter. I was there when they filmed it and it was electrifying. You suddenly see on Alan's face that he realises this guy is weird and he's trying to get out of there without hurting Michael's feelings. It makes you realise how lonely both men are – Alan yearns for the friendship. It's a great moment.\n\nFelicity Montagu, Alan's long-suffering assistant, Lynn\n\n'Anne Robinson there, grazing by that tree'\n\n(Welcome To The Places Of My Life)\n\nBefore we did the film, we weren't going bigger with Alan, we were going smaller. I particularly liked Mid-Morning Matters because it was stripping him back, putting him in a tiny studio with nowhere to hide. I think of it as Alan Unplugged. There's a scene in Welcome To The Places Of My Life where he's looking over a fence at a flock of sheep, and I really like that moment because it has a certain solitude about it, a sense of introspection. When a character is as successful as Alan, people are invested, so you can hopefully go a bit deeper and more subtle.\n\nSteve Coogan, the Alpha Papa\n\n'The Norfolk Broads offer true peace and tranquility, a million miles away from the pot-smoking, whore-ridden waterways of Amsterdam'\n\n(I'm Alan Partridge, series 1, ep 3)\n\nReading this on mobile? Click here to view\n\nI've been at BBC Radio Norfolk since day one, almost 33 years. When the TV trailers showed Alan moving into local radio, my wife looked at me and said, \"My God, he's doing you now.\" We have a few similarities: I am prone to doing wacky, off-the-cuff things. My all-time favourite scene is Alan filming on a boat after angering local farmers. He's dressed up in good boating style but the farmers drop a dead cow on him from a bridge. I spend all my holidays on the Broads. I've had swans almost land on me, but never a cow.\n\nWally Webb, Radio Norfolk Early Breakfast Show host\n\n'I've got a clean licence ... yours is dirty'\n\n(I'm Alan Partridge, series 1, ep 4)\n\nReading this on mobile? Click here to view\n\nI like the dream sequence where Alan is in a club lapdancing for BBC commissioner Tony Hayers and he's wearing a bra made of traffic cones that he got from a cycling test centre. It's a look inside his mind and I think it sums him up quite well. I've always loved Alan and when my friend opened a tattoo shop last year he said he'd do me a free tattoo. A lot of people laugh and say, \"That's a really good tattoo, but why is it Alan Partridge?\" Jed Maxwell [Alan's \"mentalist\" tattooed stalker] was in the back of my mind but I never considered getting the full chest tattoo. That would be a bit much."
