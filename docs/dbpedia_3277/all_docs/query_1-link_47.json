Alan Partridge, 'King of Chat' (or alternatively the chat show host from hell), manages to rub all of his guests' backs up in all six episodes from the first series of 'Knowing Me, Knowing You'. Finest comedy moments include the 'head shlapping' bald Brummies, the famous ABBA medley, 'Cheeky Monkey' and the French clowns. Steve Coogan is Partridge, Patrick Marber, David Schneider, Rebecca Front and Doon MacKichan are the regular guest stars, while the writing staff includes Coogan, Marber and Armando Iannucci. Whilst 'Knowing Me, Knowing Yule...' sees Alan Partridge return in this one-off Christmas special, in the comfort of an exact replica of his Norwich home. The self-styled king of chat uses his incisive questioning skills on a whole host of minor celebrities (portrayed by the regular cast), whilst trying to secure a second season of his regular chat show. From Amazon.co.uk Ah-Ha! In 1995 Norwich's most famous son Alan Partridge made the transition from radio to TV with Knowing Me, Knowing You, a chat-show so wholly misunderstood that one clever-clog TV critic described it as \"moribund\". By way of rebuttal, just consider Alan's parade of fantastic guests, including a hypnotist who persuades Alan that he's an owl; a US pop diva with whom Alan shares a memorable Abba duet that happens to be in all the wrong keys for him; raunchy male dance-act Hot Pants; Cirque des Clowns, whose extreme violence upsets Alan; and, most exciting of all, Roger Moore (via mobile phone from a traffic jam on the Chiswick roundabout). Steve Coogan's creation fell on hard times later--as chronicled in the magnificent I'm Alan Partridge Series 1 and Series 2--but here he's revelling in his prime-time exposure with no thought of becoming \"clinically sad\" or gorging on Toblerone bars. Co-writers Armando Iannucci and Patrick Marber lovingly recreate everything that's fake and contrived about the whole chat-show genre: the shameless plugging, the recalcitrant celebs, the novelty acts and, most of all, the insufferably smug host oblivious to his own tediousness. Coogan's regular guests are ably played by some faces familiar from The Day Today: Rebecca Front, Doon MacKichan, David Schneider and Patrick Marber himself. Other game guest stars are John Thomson (as a naval officer also called Alan Partridge) and Minnie Driver (as a transsexual agony aunt), not forgetting Steve Brown as disconcertingly gay music director Glen Ponder. The high-water mark of Alan's career arrived with his Christmas special Knowing Me, Knowing Yule in which his own living room was lovingly recreated at Television Centre. Unfortunately, and despite the presence of Mick Hucknall, the new Chief Commissioning Editor of BBC TV, Tony Hayers, is deeply unimpressed with the show and gets punched in the face by Alan, who, it turns out, is handy with a turkey. On that bombshell, Alan's career took a downward turn. On the DVD: Knowing Me, Knowing You is a two-disc set including all six episodes and the Christmas special. There's a group commentary throughout with contributions from Armando Iannucci plus Patrick Marber, Rebecca Front, Steve Brown and Dave Schneider speaking in and out of character. Other extras include the original pilot show, Alan on Comic Relief, Alan's rural rambles, his TV trailers, plus stills and cast biographies. --Mark Walker\n\nOrder and get 15 reward points\n\nEarn points by signing up for our rewards program"
