        "text": "The Thick of It's ferocious spin doctor, Malcolm Tucker, will face a new political adversary played by Rebecca Front when the critically acclaimed satire switches from BBC4 to BBC2 for a new series later this year.\n\nFront plays a newly appointed social affairs secretary who locks horns with Peter Capaldi's Tucker, the prime minister's foul-mouthed director of communications, in the new eight-part series.\n\nThe comedy actor has worked with The Thick of It's creator, Armando Iannucci, on previous shows including On The Hour, The Day Today and Knowing Me, Knowing You ... with Alan Partridge.\n\nOther regular cast members who will be returning for the new series include Chris Addison and James Smith's hapless special advisors Ollie and Glenn; and Joanna Scanlan as the ineffectual press secretary Terri.\n\nIannucci said: \"Fresh from the international arena of In the Loop, Malcolm Tucker will be brought back to British basics in this new series, and I'm delighted to have Rebecca Front, one of our funniest actresses, play his new nemesis, Nicola Murray MP. I can't wait to start shooting.\"\n\nThe BBC2 commission follows the successful release of the movie spin-off In the Loop, described by Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw as \"the sharpest, funniest film of the year\", earlier this month.\n\nThis eight-part BBC2 run will double the number of episodes of The Thick of It that have previously been made.\n\nAlthough critically lauded, only eight episodes of The Thick of It have been made since the show debuted as a three-part series on BBC4 in May 2005. BBC4 broadcast a second three-part series later in 2005; and two specials, The Rise of the Nutters and Spinners and Losers, in 2007. All these episodes have been repeated on BBC2.\n\nJanice Hadlow, the recently installed BBC2 controller, who oversaw the show in her previous job running BBC4, said: \"The Thick of It is one the cleverest, sharpest and funniest political comedies on television and I'm delighted that it is moving to BBC2.\"\n\nThe show was devised by Iannucci and the new series will be written by him along with Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell, Sean Gray, Ian Martin, Will Smith, Roger Drew and Tony Roche.\n\nOne reason for so few episodes of The Thick of It being made in the past four years was the arrest in late 2005 of the show's original star, Chris Langham, on suspicion of downloading child pornography.\n\nLangham, who played blundering minister Hugh Abbot, immediately withdrew from all BBC projects following his arrest and the corporation went ahead with making The Thick of It specials broadcast in 2007 without him. His character was said to have been in Australia.\n\nHe was sentenced in September 2007 to 10 months in prison for downloading pictures and videos of child abuse on to his home computer.\n\nLangham won best TV comedy actor at the British Comedy Awards for his work on The Thick of It just days before news of his arrest broke in December 2005 and followed that up with a Bafta for best comedy performance the following year.\n\nTo contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
