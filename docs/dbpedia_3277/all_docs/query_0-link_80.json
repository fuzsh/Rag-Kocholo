        "text": "It would be a bit unsettling, and so somehow appropriate, to liken Armando Iannucci to a bristly spider sitting at the centre of a dark web of comic connections. It is true, well, probably true, that he senses every twitch of the network of talent ranged around him. It is also probably true that his disturbing comic vision has shaped many of the triumphs of television entertainment over the past 10 years - Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge, The Day Today and I'm Alan Partridge. The difficulty, though, in keeping up this silly spider metaphor any longer lies in having to cast Steve Coogan, Patrick Marber and Chris Morris as dead flies caught up in Iannucci's sticky fibres. Not really fair to any of them.\n\nIannucci loves a bizarre visual image, all the same, and as a comedy writer he admits he finds it hard to drop an idea before it is exhausted of all potential. He takes, he says, great pleasure in pursuing a comic premise to its outlandish death.\n\n'I do like following an argument to its illogical conclusion and then letting people think, \"How on earth did I get there? I wasn't expecting to end up here,\"' he says.\n\nA sketch in his new Channel 4 series, The Armando Iannucci Show, involves a man who, determined not to expose his DIY incompetence, conceals the fact that he has nailed his hand to the inside of the wardrobe for several hours. Time ticks by and no punchline is in view. The blood keeps dripping, but Iannucci, the writer, has no mercy. Eventually the would-be handyman is thrown into a skip, still nailed to the discarded wardrobe.\n\nAlthough Iannucci himself is softly spoken, and his comic style gentler than that of Morris ('Chris never takes the easy path'), he was instrumental in putting this confrontational comedian before the public, first on radio and then television. And there is an aggressive streak in his work too, all the more unnerving for being hidden.\n\n'I have never hit anyone,' he protests. 'But I like reminding people that they mustn't categorise things from the start. I get concerned about how quickly we make assumptions. I like to make sure that people feel slightly disoriented.'\n\nIannucci's previous television show, The Friday Night Armistice, was hailed for its comparatively large dollop of political satire. But if that show hinged on its topical content, Iannucci appears to have put this format to one side. His current obsession is modern neurosis, or the horrible business of living these days. In his quest for the horrid, he doesn't flinch from presenting viewers with surreal sketches featuring professional suicide-note writing services, fatal plane crash simulators and rodeo-style cremations.\n\nIn the past, his articulate television shows have been criticised for not being telegenic enough. This time, Iannucci takes his lurid, Technicolor revenge. He offers us a police dog's cocaine-fuelled dream holiday in Bangkok, a Busby Berkeley-style dance number for corpses, and a Bedford Water official who has developed webbed fingers.\n\nIannucci's move in front of the camera is in fact a return to performance roots. 'I started off doing my own comedy and fell into producing by accident,' he says. 'Then I found I had to put on suits and go to meetings with BBC management. Most of the shows I had to push were crap, so I lasted a month. I thought: \"I should not be doing this,\" and went freelance.'\n\nThe decision to go it alone came at the moment that independent production companies were beginning to gain power in the world of TV comedy.\n\n'We were just doing the pilot for The Day Today, the television version of On the Hour with Chris, Steve, Patrick, Doon Mackichan, Dave Schneider and Rebecca Front, and we had already had TV interest for Knowing Me, Knowing You on Radio 4. So it was good timing.'\n\nOn The Hour, a revolutionary parody of the meaningless rhythms of news broadcasting, launched the comic careers of its stars, while Marber, a bit like Ernie Wise, was also already planning to write plays - except that his - Dealer's Choice, Closer and Howard Katz - went on to wow the West End and Broadway.\n\nSurrounded by such precocious talent, Iannucci understandably 'likes to keep turning up' on screen himself when he can. 'It's quite important that I occasionally appear in things,' he says. 'Otherwise, people tend to think a producer just turns the power on or something.'\n\nIt is clear, however, that Iannucci doesn't crave stardom. 'Not fitting in' and being a wallflower are part of his comic persona. He is comfy with his relative nonentity (a status which must be due partly to frequent misspellings of his name).\n\nIannucci grew up in Glasgow, the son of a pizza factory owner from Naples. He attended a Jesuit boys' school, just like Chris Morris, and then studied English at Oxford, after which he briefly flirted with the conventional idea of joining the Treasury. 'I wanted to do something in comedy, but I was never subversive. I was a model pupil at school and I didn't really have an agenda. I never felt naughty.'\n\nBut he does have a strong sense of not belonging to the establishment. A disconcerting lunchtime spent in the dining room of a national newspaper is the inspiration for one of the new sketches about just this.\n\n'I was taken to a meal at some point after the general election in 1997, and there were all sorts of great and good there, like Nigella Lawson, Ben Pimlott and Anne Robinson. They all seemed to know the thing to say. At one point, the editor even asked Pimlott to give a talk on the distinctions between the Blair and Attlee governments. I found myself looking down to avoid their eyes. It reminded me of being in a Latin lesson or something.'\n\nPerhaps, he wondered, everyone else in the world has been given notes to help them get through these situations. 'This feeling also comes out of my realisation that everything runs on bullshit. Even the medical profession and government scientists, who are clearly rubbish. This is such a British thing, because we don't seem to like admitting we are wrong.'\n\nIs the lurking anger in his comedy surfacing at last? Iannucci says no. He just wants to entertain and doesn't have a message to get across - although he confesses to irritation with the emphasis on 'warmer' news coverage and the growing pressure to make broadcasting unthreatening.\n\n'To be honest, I don't even buy the Channel 4 line about the Chris Morris show on paedophilia. It wasn't just an attack on the media. It was meant to offend us all, because it was about the way we all are. If nobody had batted an eyelid, that would have meant society was really sick.'\n\nIannucci is not naturally depressive, he says, although he confesses to 'nosediving' for the odd 24 hours. He may well believe that the only human achievement to bring any satisfaction so far 'is the shuffle function on a CD player', but his mission, clearly laid out in his new show, is to improve life by telling strange stories. 'We all tell stories at the end and at the beginning of our lives,' he argues, 'I am just trying to make the middle of our lives more consistent.'\n\n The Armando Iannucci Show starts on Thursday 30 August on Channel 4"
