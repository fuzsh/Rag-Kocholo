        "text": "ahaaaa\n\nReally fun to hear the original series for the first time. Very funny. Alan Partridge is a character who I've come to appreciate the older I've got.\n\nGenius at work\n\nSo so so good. These extra words were forced on me because it needs 15 words, apparently\n\nBrilliant\n\nAbsolutely brilliant classic partridge which of course it was as this was the first major thing he did.\n\nclassic queen! a good insight into early Partridge\n\nquality is lacking in the audio but I laughed aloud many a time. as a Partridge enthusiast I always enjoy hearing more about his \"life\". the coogan commentary at the end is interesting too.\n\nFunny guest dies on chat show-a-ha!\n\nThe original radio chat show, precursor to the TV series, inspired lunacy, incredibly bad guest intros that hang in the air like…..something bad…..insane questioning of dubious guests…..it’s a work of genius!\n\nThe Radio Original - the best\n\nAlan Partridge started out on radio, and this release contains that ground breaking radio series.\n\nEven after all these years, this has such currency for laughing out loud.\n\nthe radio series morphed into the KMKY television series.\n\nAs with many great BBC comedies it started on the radio.\n\nEnjoy,\n\ngood all-round comedy\n\nmade me chuckle. hadn't started much in the 20 years since was made. recommend at least a bit of background knowledge to the character.\n\nThe beginnings of Alan’s TV career\n\nFabulous stuff here from the Partridge team, back when Alan had what I consider the best aura and story around the way he acted and worked. I’m not a big fan of current Alan and this was at the pinnacle of his powers. You can see how this radio show influenced the characters of the TV show version, with some characters directly worked into a different character on TV, but having the same slip ups and jokes. Enjoyable to listen to in your Rover or Lexi (plural)."
