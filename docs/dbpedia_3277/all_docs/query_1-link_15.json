        "text": "Those British actors really like to show off, don’t they? Isn’t it enough to play one character at a time really well? Apparently not. There are quite a few out there who insist upon taking on more than one role within the same series. And I’m talking completely formed personas with specific personalities, back stories and quite possibly, catch phrases. How do they do this without getting one character confused with another? Well, besides the fact that a great many of them have attended drama school, I’d have to say the inner transformations are enhanced in large part by the elaborate costumes ,wigs, and in some cases, detailed prosthetic makeup.\n\nIn the mockumentary series Human Remains, (dvd cover art pictured to the right) Rob Brydon and Julia Davis portray six unique roles in each of six episodes. They range from an aristocratic couple with disparate feelings towards one another to a pair of middle-aged married swingers who carry on while taking care of a comatose sister. The comedy is quite dark as most of Julia Davis’ work is, but you have to marvel at how each character is unique in appearance, mannerisms and dialect.\n\nThe Mighty Boosh, which can be best described as a surreal musical sitcom, features Noel Fielding and Julian Barrett as zoo employees and later shop staffers, Vince Noir and Howard Moon. In the course of a given episode however, these two actors, along with their supporting cast, may transform into any number of other guest characters including Old Gregg, the Hitcher, the Crack Fox and the Moon.\n\nAs it’s difficult to accurately describe this show, let me introduce the Board of Shaman as they head out for a stag night:\n\nAnother show with a very versatile cast is Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge. Steve Coogan stars as inept talk show presenter, Alan Partridge, but it’s the supporting actors – namely Rebecca Front, Patrick Marber, and David Schneider- who reappear week after week as wildly different guests on the program. It took me a few episodes to realize this was a recurring cast and not different actors in each role. Here’s an example if you’ve never experienced the delightfully awkward Alan Partridge:\n\nNext we move on to the real workhorses. In sketch comedy, multiple characters are the whole point. French and Saunders, A Bit of Fry and Laurie and of course Monty Python are among the elite comedy teams who alter their gender, age, size and personal history in the space of a five minute sketch. As I’ve featured Little Britain a number of times here because of their amazing attention to detail in the creation of a diverse array of characters, I won’t go on about them just now.\n\nHowever if we take this concept one step further, we arrive at the pinnacle of multi-character performance. The League of Gentleman is a loosely interweaved horror/sitcom that all takes place in the (hopefully imaginary) village of Royston Vasey. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, and Reece Shearsmith take on over two dozen characters each in the course of a three series run and probably portray at least 6 or 7 roles per episode. From a transsexual cab driver to a sadistic job centre manager to a mysterious shop-keeping couple who do not welcome non-local clientele, Royston Vasey is full of secrets and very dark behavior indeed. A concept like this leaves Saturday Night Live in the dust.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the versatility of this cast, I found a trailer for the dvd collection which features each actor in a handful of roles.\n\nOh yeah, and did I mention most of these actors write their own material as well? What a bunch of overachievers!\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nTelevision presenters are not a uniquely British concept. In America, we are more likely to call them hosts, emcees and commentators, but the job is the same. Bob Barker, Jay Leno, John Madden, Oprah; they’re all presenters.\n\nI remember virtually every Monty Python episode had a sketch involving a presenter of one type or another. Who can forget the sportscaster calling the Queen Victoria Handicap, Eric Idle as the host of a kiddie program reading inappropriate children’s stories, and of course, John Cleese’s newsreader segue, “and now for something completely different”?\n\nI have watched two series about fictional televison presenters – The Life and Times of Vivienne Vyle (BBC 2007) and Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge (BBC 1994). Vivienne hosts a daytime dysfunctional circus a la Jerry Springer while Alan presents a cheesy variety chat show with only marginally famous celebrities for guests (for more about Alan Partridge see my Best Thing I Watched this Week page). Catchphrases seem to be mandatory. Grovelling and/or scheming for a series renewal- a television industry trial many have faced. Both shows demonstrate the very real desire people have to be seen as talented, extraordinary or at least, peculiar. While this is by no means a British phenomenon, they have a great knack for parodying, not only the bizarre comedic side of these types of shows, but also bringing out the poignancy of our need to be noticed.\n\nRecently while watching an episode of The Vicar of Dibley, I decided to count the number of specifically British references. In one 30 minute program there were 22 people, places or things mentioned that Americans probably wouldn’t recognize. (Demonstrating my lack of British historical knowledge, Harold McMillian, a former Prime Minister, was one of them). After intense Googling, I found seven of the references were television presenters. Among them were Countdown hostess Carol Vorderman, Match of the Day‘s Des Lynham, and the hosting team who must be an inspiration to Ryan Seacrest, Ant(hony) and Dec(lan).\n\nMaybe it’s because I don’t know them that there appear to be so many. In a country with a fifth of the US population, I get the impression the presenter-to-audience ratio is much higher in the UK. Whether or not my observation is accurate, it’s clear the Brits love their presenters. They are familiar friends who shepherd their audiences through a television entertainment experience.\n\nRead Full Post »"
