        "text": "The Day Today was the programme that - under writer/producer Armando Iannucci - launched the talents of Patrick Marber, Doon Mackichan, Steve Coogan, Rebecca Front and, of course, Chris Morris firmly into the public eye.\n\nEach episode was presented as a very real news programme, right down to the ludicrously overblown graphics that appeared between each item (whose creators had, incidentally, just finished designing the graphics for the ITN News) and was presided over by Chris Morris in the sneeringly macho style of a youthful Jeremy Paxman.\n\nWhile Morris bellowed out news headlines about thefts of the pound and its replacement by an emergency currency based on the Queen's eggs, the rest of the show was delivered by a cast of news-programme stereotypes still instantly recognisable today.\n\nAmerican Correspondent Barbara Wintergreen (Front) was the true stars-and-stripes-too-much-make-up-and-dodgy-puns reporter instantly recognisable from genuine US news coverage.\n\nEconomics correspondent Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan (Marber), meanwhile was uselessness personified, constantly blown away by the verbal grenades chucked at him by Morris from a great height.\n\nThe Day Today was undoubtedly brilliant but it was more than capable of being a little self-satisfied at times, exemplified by the plentiful in-jokes for the mediarati (such as Morris's \"fact me until I fart\" line in one episode) which must have mystified outsiders.\n\nAgain, where Chris Morris's later stitch-ups of politicians, pop stars and pundits on Brass Eye were fair game, watching him getting ordinary members of the public to say dumb-assed things in the show's regular \"Speak Your Brains\" Vox Pops can feel a lot like watching a smart public school sixth-former mocking the oiks.\n\nDespite such criticism, The Day Today brought some major figures of stage and screen to the nation's attention as well as defining the approach to satire for the next two decades - a record only comic icons like That Was The Week That Was and Not the Nine O'Clock News can match.\n\nNot bad for a mere six episodes, eh?"
