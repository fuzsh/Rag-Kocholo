        "text": "Hi there – for new visitors who have come here and would like to follow us on twitter but can’t – we apologise. There seems to be a problem with our twitter account which we are trying to resolve as fast as we can. We’re more frustrated than you we can assure you, and trying to work out what went wrong (it may well be our fault, we’re new to this twitter lark).\n\nDo feel free to leave your twitter profile names in our comments section below and as soon as we’re up and running (fingers crossed) we’ll let you know so you can join our club. Who knows, if you leave your profile name then maybe some other people will follow you too. If you prefer to keep it private you can email us at popliferblog@gmail.com with your profile name or you can ask to be a Facebook friend (there’s a link over there on the right). We’ll follow you, obviously. Unless you’re Olly Murs. You’re banned Olly, we aren’t going through this again.\n\nIn the meantime browse and enjoy our rantings, ravings and reviews on Blur, Pussy Riot, Frank Ocean, Olympics, Pet Shop Boys, Tony Scott, Donnie Darko, other cult classics and more more more (how do you like it?).\n\nThings will go a bit quiet on blog til we have all this sorted.\n\nIt would have to happen on our bloody one month birthday, wouldn’t it…\n\nNews is coming in that Tony Scott, director of blockbuster films from Top Gun through to Man On Fire, has died aged 68. The cause of death is apparently suicide, which makes the news particularly sad, and reminds us that depression can strike anyone, no matter what their age, or their apparent material success.\n\nPop Lifer won’t claim to be an enormous fan of all of Scott’s work but he has been part of our lives since we were practically children. And for one of us, growing up in the economically depressed North East of England in the late eighties, Tony Scott and his brother Ridley were local boys made good, symbols that even we could succeed if we had talent, a work ethic and maybe a little luck. After all, in the words of another famous Geordie, Neil Tennant, “when you’re young you find inspiration in anyone/ Whose ever gone and opened up a closing door.”\n\nMost of the news stories and tributes pouring in are focusing on Scott’s breakthrough film and indisputable 80s icon, “Top Gun”. Like most 10 year olds of that era, “Top Gun” was one of the first films we owned on the new VHS technology, and we saw it so many times that even though we haven’t seen it for 25 years we would probably still know half the dialogue. And like many, we have enjoyed remembering the film’s bizarre homo-eroticism, as well as the hilarious poster where Kelly McGillis has to slouch so strangely and artfully to look a similar height to Tom Cruise that she aqppears to be doing particularly skilled and painful yoga.\n\nBut in fact the film we are fondest of is often overlooked: Scott’s gaudy, direct version of the Quentin Tarantino script “True Romance.” In some ways it’s our favourite Tarantino-related movie ever. The romance of the title really is true: in the middle of wildly noisy shoot outs, botched attempts at criminality, tour de force gangster show downs between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, and an atmosphere of snowballing and terrifying chaos, Christian Slater’s comic book clerk Clarence and Patrica Arquette’s hooker Alabama really do fall in love, naively and totally. There’s an energy and charm to that love which makes us want to watch the film again right now.\n\nThere’s also a scene amidst the more cartoonish violence which is quite breathtakingly difficult to watch, when a smoothly sinister pre-Sopranos James Gandolfini tracks down Alabama and finds her alone. She tries to charm her way out of the situation, but fails, and is soon subject to an attack which is so visceral, so real, so clearly a display of a man’s strength and brutal physicality hurled against a smaller woman that it becomes practically a feminist tract, and is certainly an antidote to the stylised, removed violence of most action films. When Alabama holds on through sheer stubborn defiance and will-to-live (see our image above), kills her attacker and enjoys her moment of bloodied triumph it’s difficult not to cheer long and jubilantly.\n\nA truly great film and a truly great scene in a mixed but interesting career. RIP Tony Scott.\n\n31 years ago today a magazine editor from Newcastle called Neil Tennant and a trained architect called Chris Lowe met by chance in a shop on the King’s Road in London. It was not a pet shop. Within 5 years they would be globally famous and getting stuck into their new job expanding the musical, intellectual and emotional boundaries of pop music, and adding countless new songs of near perfection to its canon.\n\nIf you’ve been following our blog since its infancy (three weeks ago – time moves fast online, you know) you’ll know we are Pet Shop Boys fanatics and will have either been bowled over or bored senseless by the thousands of words we’ve already spilled on the subject. Still, some of you are new, and it is a special occasion, so here’s a brief summary of what we’ve blogged on the boys…\n\nPet Shop Boys Winner – a brief and frankly underwhelmed review of the new Pet Shop Boys single which got us thinking what the real winners were\n\nPet Shop Boys Definitively – our 20 greatest PSB songs listed with bias and love\n\nPet Shop Boys Distinctively – at the request of readers a couple of blogs on lost gems from the back catalogue\n\nPet Shop Boys to the rescue – a review of the rubbish Olympic closing ceremony which reserves special praise for the dynamic duo\n\nAnd coming soon from the duo themselves: their latest studio album, Elysium. If its as good as the last one, Yes, their finest in many years, then we’ll be very happy bloggists indeed.\n\nHappy Birthday Pet Shop Boys!\n\nFor those of you who haven’t been following the news, three members of Moscow’s feminist punk band Pussy Riot – pictured above – were today jailed for 2 years for “hooliganism”, following their performance of an anti Vladimir Putin song inside a Moscow Cathedral. The BBC has a report here.\n\nPop Lifer visited Moscow earlier this year and spent some time exploring its strange and oddly charming subterranean gay scene. Many of the people we met had until recently lived in St Petersburg and had come to Moscow to escape the illiberalism and dangerous authoritarianism they felt rising in Russia’s second city, as best exemplified by the laws St Petersburg had enacted making the “promotion of homosexuality” criminal. This in effect meant the legalised oppression of St Petersburg’s already tiny, fragile gay community.\n\nAs today’s Pussy Riot verdict demonstrates, Moscow is now proving just as thuggish in its oppression of dissent and minority viewpoints. Indeed, in today’s Russia there is nowhere to hide from a state that seems to be dropping any last pretence of being a liberal democracy.

But sometimes we learn from the subsequent output of the artist that it isn’t so, that instead their moment of greatness was a fluke which they are incapable of repeating.\n\nTricky’s “Maxinquaye” is, arguably, one of these creations. Tricky occasionally wrote great songs after his startling, haunting, utterly original debut album – the seething angst of “Christiansands”, the crushed, stately beauty of “Poems”, the vicious swagger of “Tricky Kid” – but all of his subsequent albums were stunted creatures, hobbled by self-indulgence, lapses into ugly bluster and the stubborn refusal of inspiration to take part in proceedings.\n\n2001’s “Donnie Darko” is another one of those glorious accidents in pop culture, an unrepeatable one-off. Director Richard Kelly was one of the most briefly-crowned geniuses of all time, dethroned faster than Edward VIII (less than a year). No sooner had “Donnie Darker” made its strange journey from being a weirdo film that the studio had no idea how to market, to limited cinema release, to DVD, to vast, zeitgeist-surfing cult success than Kelly began to make a mess of it.\n\nFirst the director’s cuts of the film itself, which sprawled with self-indulgence and layered the film in sci-fi hokum that attempted to explain the film’s central mystery, but instead killed it dead. And then there was his follow up film, Southland Tales: if you are one of the 99.9999999999% of the cinema going public who decided to give it a miss, we urge you to reconsider. There is something hypnotic in its sheer, spectacular awfulness, the apocalyptic posturing, the brain-murdering dialogue (from the same man whose dialogue in “Donnie Darko” sings), the risible plot and the diabolical performances from figures such as Justin Timberlake and, yes, The Rock. Films should make our jaws drop open and Southland Tales does this, though in disbelief rather than wonder.\n\nBut let’s not linger on painful memories but instead remember the wonder of “Donnie Darko”, non-directors cut. PopLifer remembers seeing a cinema trailer for it and being deeply confused – was it meant to be a horror film? Eighties period drama? Sci fi? Teenage angst? – but intrigued enough to go and see it at the cinema.\n\nWe left with our tiny minds blown. The film proved to be all of the above, of course, but also so much more. From the ravishing opening scene – young Jake Gyllenhaal wakes up on the side of a mountain, dawn breaking and his bike by his side, unaware of how he got there, then cycles home to the sublime sound of Echo and the Bunnymen’s “The Killing Moon” – we were hooked. Over the next two hours we were enthralled, mystified, moved, frightened and finally heartbroken. Continue reading →\n\nThird of 3 blogs charting Britain’s on/off love affair with Blur. Part 1, the introduction, here. Part 2, covering the troubled early years, here. Now onto the imperial phase.\n\nTo coincide with Blur’s performance at Hyde Park on Sunday, ITV 4 showed No Distance Left to Run, the honest and fairly definitive documentary which captures the preparation for their triumphant 2009 return as well as their overall career arc. You know the one – the rise, the fall and the return to grace. Their final rejection of both fame and each other, and eventual reconciliation with both.\n\nIt’s an exhaustive and exhausting two hours; the emotional connection you make with a band you love played out in a series of frank and difficult interviews. It’s a complex tale with some fairly simple conclusions: seeking fame is dangerous (see also Jackson, Spears, Winehouse) and that creative and emotional honesty is crucial to a band’s health. By 1AM, Pop Lifer was slightly teary and bleary, Sing still echoing in the living room, the credits rolling, and then – just before the reach for the remote – a jaunty Welsh announcer chirped:\n\n“Well, Parklife has always been my favourite. Next on ITV 4, Motorway Patrol.”\n\nLet’s face it, Blur will never fully escape “Parklife”, the album, the single, the video, the look and the fall out (essentially “The Great Escape”). The extraordinary variety of musical styles and mood which Blur have explored and which Pop Lifer are so joyously charting this week will, we suspect, always be revered by music fanatics. For much of the broader public which exist beyond blogs, fanzines and Hyde Park, for ‘all the people, so many people’, “Parklife” is Blur. As fellow Britpop survivor Luke Haines notes acidically in his “Bad Vibes” biography, “”Parklife” sold 3 million records in Swindon alone.”\n\nContinue reading →"
