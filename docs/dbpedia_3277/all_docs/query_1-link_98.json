        "text": "What are some of your favorite British TV comedies that are less well known in the US? This is not the thread for massive international hits like AbFab, Fawlty Towers, Keeping Up Appearances etc. This for those British tv comedies that either didn't air in the US or which, if they have aired in the US, only had small, cult audiences.\n\nHere's Snuffbox, a pretty dark sketch comedy show...\n\nHuman Remains I liked. Nighty Night was too much for me, as was Snuff Box.\n\nNot a Britcom, technically, but YouTube has some \"The Comic Strip Presents\" specials from the 1980s and 1990s, many featuring Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmonson, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders and others. Here's a link to the first part of a piss-take on Enid Blyton's \"Famous Five\" juvenile novel series\n\nFor fans of Penelope Keith (\"To the Manor Born\"), there's \"No Job for a Lady,\" in which she plays a Labour MP. Also, \"Executive Stress,\" in which she plays an empty-nester who goes back to work for a publisher.\n\nFor something quirky and esoteric, there's \"Mulberry,\" in which Death's son (Karl Howman) is apprenticing for the job of collecting old souls when their time is up. His first assignment is cranky old Miss Farnaby (Geraldine McEwan), but he wants her to have some fun before she goes.\n\nOne of my favorites is \"After Henry\" with Prunella Scales. The humour is low key, but really endearing. The end of almost every episode leaves me thinking \"Ah, so sweet.\"\n\nI love this topic, but tonight I'm learning I'm slow at the wordplay of Britcom character names.\n\nFor instance, I've known for years Jennifer Saunders and Adrian Edmonson are married, but just now I figured that Edina Monsoon comes from \"Edmonson\"\n\nand the oxymoron of \"Dean Learner\" I just now got.\n\nI don't know if Butterfiles is well-known or lesser-known in the USA but it is funny, sweet and sad all at once. It tells the continuing story of a bored suburban housewife who is terribly tempted to cheat on her dull dentist husband with a rich divorced man she met by chance. Her two sons, restless young men without jobs in Thatcher's UK, added to the series' appeal.\n\n\"The Good Neighbors\" a/k/a \"The Good Life\" - Felicity Kendall, Penelope Keith, Richard Briers and Paul Eddington about a couple who decide to try to live life off the grid and their next door neighbors who are suburbanites.\n\n\"Miranda\" - Miranda Hart, tall and gawky running a novelty shop, with a funny mom and an out of her league hunky guy who really likes her - breaking the fourth wall at times - quite funny\n\nSome Mothers Do 'ave 'em\n\nMichael Crawford plays Frank Spence, a clumsy idiot. Film in the 1970s. Lots of hilarious episodes, but my favorite is when Frank and his wife go on a second honeymoon. He ends up practically destroying the hotel room.\n\nCrawford did his own stunts in the show and he was incredible. There was one episode where he rollerskates under a moving truck. It's amazing that the producers allowed him to do stunts like that.\n\nCrawford also played the original Phantom on Broadway and London - it just shows what a good actor he was because you'd never believe that Frank and The Phantom of The Opera were played by the same person.\n\nLove all the League of Gentlemen mentions. Little Britain is better known in the US, but I always preferred LOG -- which wasn't afraid to get very dark.\n\nAny Never Mind the Buzzcocks fans? The Simon Amstell years were the best.\n\nAbout half the ones mentioned on this thread are pretty popular in the US with several shown on local PBS stations...Red Dwarf, The Vicar of Dibley, The Good Life, To The Manor Born.\n\nFolks \"in the know\" have known about League of Gentlemen and The Catherine Tate Show for years. Well, smart gay ones have.\n\nI really liked \"Twenty Twelve,\" the BBC comedy that ran for two short seasons. The team in London preparing to host the Olympics faces various fuckups and petty mishaps. Ran on BBC America in the US shortly before the Olympics.\n\nHugh Bonneville is great in a role different from Downton, and in a small role DL fave Olivia Colman shines. Would love to see it again.\n\nI LOVE British comedy. Love a lot of what's been mentioned, but here's some I don't think anyone's said yet:\n\nPulling (by and with Sharon Horgan of Catastrophe) Absolute Power (Stephen Fry) The Book Group (Anne Dudek, Karen Kilgariff, Rory McCann...) Grandma's House (Simon Amstell, Rebecca Front) People Like Us (Chris Langham) That Mitchell and Webb Look (David Mitchell, Robert Webb, Olivia Colman) Damned (Alan Davies, Jo Brand) Hunderby (Julia Davis) Inside no 9 (Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith) My Life In Film (Kris Marshall, Andrew Scott, Alice Lowe) Psychoville (Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith) The Day Today (Chris Morris) Up the Women (Jessica Hynes, Rebecca Front) Witless (Kerry Howard, Zoe Boyle)\n\nAnother vote for Gavin and Stacey - who were adorable.\n\nLoved the fact that each of their best friends despised each other but fucked anyway.\n\nI almost liked their parents/family members the most of all.\n\nRob Brydon as Stacey's welsh mother hen of an uncle killed me.\n\nBUT - the icing on the cake was Gavin's dad played by Larry Lamb.\n\nR83, I was one who mentioned Gavin and Stacey upthread and I agree with everything you wrote, especially about almost loving their friends/parents more.\n\nMy favorite character was Pam, played by Alison Steadman, as Gavin's mother. Her lines, and the way she delivers them, always make me laugh.\n\nThe Job Lot starring DL fave Russell Tovey\n\nUncle (Con O'neil who starred in musical Blood Brothers plays the funniest drag queen)\n\nBenidorm - (the grandmother is one of the funniest characters on tv)\n\nKingdom - wonderful cast Stephen Fry, the ever great Hermione Norris, Celia Imrie, Emma Thompson's mother\n\nIf you enjoy Gavin & Stacey, give \"Stella\" a try (hot son!) written by Ruth Jones\n\nFresh Meat - six college students living together - LOVE the Vod character\n\nAgatha Raisin - not quite a britcom, but sort of a quirky murder mystery\n\nThat's My Boy (starring Mollie \"Mrs. Slocombe\" Sugden) - older show\n\nGoodnight Sweetheart - older show, great premise (time travel)\n\nAnother vote for W1A (although the title is awful), the sort-of follow-on to Twenty Twelve (which is available on DVD from Netflix; W1A is on Netflix streaming). I've watched Crashing three times because Jonathan Bailey is my TV Boyfriend (he's also on W1A in a smaller part).\n\nPut me down for Gavin and Stacey, too. The title characters are the least of the reasons to watch it -- everyone else is fantastic.\n\n[quote]WLIW-21 in Metro New York is running an announcement. On Friday, March 31st they'll be saying Good Bye to Britcoms.\n\nIs this just threats to get more money like they used to do with EastEnders or are they really pulling the Britcoms? Have audiences finally gotten sick of Keeping Up Appearances and As Times Goes By? And why is WLIW too cheap to buy some other Britcoms.\n\nThis probably fits more in the \"comfort viewing\" thread for me and it certainly was tacky but the 70s sitcom George & Mildred is unknown in the US even though The Ropers was the American adaptation. I really watched it for the wonderful and tragic Yootha Joyce.\n\nOh, I \"get\" the W1A title, R105, even though I'm a Yank. It's just tedious to explain what it means to other Yanks. And it's a mouthful (granted, many pleasant things are). So was Twenty Twelve, come to think of it. Do I detect a trend? Anyway, excellent series. I was glad to hear there's a second season coming.\n\n[quote]Our local PBS station just started showing The IT Crowd and I'm really enjoying it.\n\nThe woman supervisor also plays the second secretary on Doc Martin and she's really great in that. Also, she's in a show called \"In The Club\" about a group of pregnant women.\n\nStill Game - The wacky adventures of a bunch of silly old Scotsmen.\n\nFather Ted - Piss your pants funny and not even a little bit pious. In fact it would probably be considered near to blasphemy by many Catholics.\n\nAll the many incarnations of Alan Partridge.\n\nAnd another vote for Brass Eye.\n\nI just stumbled across a youtube channel with a bunch of British sitcom episodes, only a couple I was familiar with. No idea if these series were any good or not though I believe one of them was the original British version of All In the Family.\n\nI notice one stars John Inman \"Odd Man Out\".\n\nand btw, not my channel\n\nI *am* Victor Mildrew! Not really, but close . . .\n\nAs a fan of the Agatha Raisin books, the TV show is too far different for me to get into. Perhaps OT, but I did get used to No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency videos.\n\nGreen Wing, set in a hospital and one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Every single character is a winner but my favorite is the insane staff liaison officer Sue White played wonderfully deadpan by Michelle Gomez. One of my favorite bits is when Guy the anaesthetist walks in to her office, says \"do you know what I love about you?\" She looks at him blankly.... he screams \"FUCK ALL!\" and leaves.\n\nWorth watching for Michelle Gomez dancing to her phone ringtone if for nothing else.\n\nI discovered one on Netflix called Black Books. I really don't like slapsticky, silly comedies but for some reason I found some of the episodes hysterically funny. The one where one of the characters plays the piano from the inside of the piano was hilarious. It's a show filled with idiotic characters that's laugh out loud funny\n\n[quote]Drop The Dead Donkey, behind the scenes at Globelink news, still funny.\n\nYour're right; it holds up extremely well.\n\nThere's a DVD set with the complete series (Region 2 PAL format, unfortunately, which needs a multi-region player for those of us in Region 1). On the DVDs, most seasons have an introduction for each episode, specifying when it originally aired and what the news was covering at that time.\n\nFrom a long long time ago...The Likely Lads, Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads, Steptoe & Son, Hancock's Half Hour. Too black and white and English for today's audience I would think. A little more recently, Birds of a Feather. Too womanist I would think. I liked Stella Street, with \"Mick & Keef\" running a corner shop.\n\n[quote] No Honestly was quite sweet.\n\nPauline Collins was sweet, even on \"Upstairs Downstairs\". The show was never quite the same after Sarah was written out. But \"No Honestly\" itself was just a remake of the old \"Burns and Allen\" show with Pauline doing a pretty good impression of Gracie Allen.\n\n[post redacted because linking to dailymail.co.uk clearly indicates that the poster is either a troll or an idiot (probably both, honestly.) Our advice is that you just ignore this poster but whatever you do, don't click on any link to this putrid rag.]\n\nSequel series \"Are You Being Served? Again!\" aka \"Grace and Favour\" The staff of the ladies' and gentlemen's departments from Grace Bros. take over running a country inn after the store closes and they learn their pension has been invested in the house. It ran for only two seasons. A lot of people only know of the original series.\n\nPulling.\n\nBrilliantly, brilliantly funny. Seek it out. The episode where they can't afford to have the cat put down and kill it with a brick, and the fecal paintings in the cafe are dazzling.\n\nThe League Of Gentlemen Christmas episode is seriously seriously fucked up. They got the 1970s German household scarily accurate.\n\nMTV or maybe VH-1, early days, ran The Young Ones and also some anthology series of British comedy, one episode of which featured Dawn French as \"Consuela,\" ( I hope I'm right) a maid giving the new baroness Jennifer Saundes a hard time.\n\n\"Consuela, I think I'll just go down to the pond to sketch some ducks.\"\n\n\"I've taken the liberty, madam.\" Shows sketches of ducks! Horror face on Jen\n\nr23\n\nThis was funny the first two years, but it's a great example of people getting full of themselves. The star thought he was too good for the scripts and wanted to change them. In effect, he changed the essence of the whole character and the third season isn't funny at all.\n\nr126\n\nI for the life of me cannot understand why the gay community didn't embrace \"Birds of a Feather.\" It is a every single thing they could want and it's damn funny. The three leads in the show have so much chemistry and the scripts are well done.\n\nIt should be as big a hit over here as any other Brit-Com\n\nI'd forgotten about League Of Gentlemen. God it was hilarious.\n\nWhenever I see someone gathering the trollies in a supermarket car park I always think \"A fucking monkey could do it!\"\n\nand the taxi driver with gruff voice whose face we never saw, always talking to his passengers about his sex change operation.\n\nand \"We don't pass solids in this house\".\n\n[quote]I for the life of me cannot understand why the gay community didn't embrace \"Birds of a Feather.\"\n\nGod, I hated that.\n\nOne episode was so homophobic, I couldn't believe it. It was disgusting, actually.\n\nDamn, R86, the apple didn't fall far from that handsome tree.\n\nR91, the only thing that could top three steak Pam, is when she felt obliged to pretend to be a vegetarian for Stacey's lot. HILARIOUS.\n\nR96 - I hope I can scrounge up that season - Larry? Gay? AND a cop?? Trifecta!\n\nR114 - Hey, that's the chick from Episodes! Love her.\n\nNot really a Britcom, but did anyone stumble across Flowers?\n\nQuirky and clever and darkly funny; co-starring DL fave Olivia Colman. Some terrific performances all-around.\n\nAnd the actor playing her troubled husband is sexy as fuck. Hmm.\n\nI'm beginning to suspect I have a type.\n\n\"Consuela, or The First Mrs Saunders\" from Comic Strip presents. French and Saunders early and great, directed by Stephen Frears!\n\nMTV ran the series when I was in college, and it was my best taste of British comedy since the short run of Python, which I knew by heart.\n\nEdge of Heaven. It only ran for six episodes so I guess I am the only one that likes it. It's about a family that runs a B&B in a beach resort town. Supporting cast includes Adrian Scarborough as half of a gay couple and Marcia Warren (the old lady from Vicious) as his mother.\n\nBack in the day I was quite partial to You Rang M'lord? For its era it was quite groundbreaking in portraying glamorous dandyish a lesbian as one of the most sympathetic characters, sspecially for an early evening family comedy. (bonus: actual cane and monaclr!!!)\n\nKiss Me Kate --\n\nA situation comedy portraying the frenetic everyday life of Kate Salinger (Caroline Quentin), a woman counselor who not only must deal with the various problems of her clients but also the permanently depressed state of her business partner Douglas (Chris Langham), the unrequited romantic attention of her travel agent neighbor Craig (Darren Boyd) and the love-sick Italian Tony (Cliff Parisi), owner of the local wine bar.\n\nI think Peep Show is uneven. Some shows are really funny and some are just stupid. I got tired of the Jeremy character after awhile. What was funny in the early episodes just became tedious in the later seasons. And Jeremy turning gay in the final season was really stupid. It really didn't bring much comedy to the show.\n\n\"Spy\" starred Darren Boyd as a dork in the midst of a custody battle with his ex-wife over their snobby, evil-genius pre-teen son, who somehow ends up working for MI6 as an operative. Boyd is hilarious as he bumbles his way through his assignments, juggling the custody battle, his son's shenanigans and his crush on a co-worker.\n\n[quote]And Jeremy turning gay in the final season was really stupid.\n\nEnhh...wasn’t all that surprising because they kinda laid the groundwork for that early on. But I get your point...\n\nI love “Toast of London” with Matt Berry, who I think is married to the broad from the IT Crowd. I apologize if it was already posted.\n\nSome great choices here, including Roger and Val Have Just Got In, and Perfect World. One of the greatest Britcoms of all time is Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?, a darker version of its prequel The Likely Lads, but I'm not sure it would travel well or that the accents and setting of NE England in the 70s would resonate. Brilliantly acted by James Bolam and Rodney Bewes though. Much more recently, Posh Nosh with Arabella Weir and Richard E Grant was a hoot.\n\nI agree R181. And in real life too. Wilfred Brambell was a classically trained, and gay, Irish actor, who hated playing Steptoe Snr, and there was a lot of friction between him and Steptoe Jnr, Harry H Corbett. The catchphrase \"you dirty old man\" was spoofed in the Beatle's A Hard Days Night, where Brambell played grandad, when ?John called him \" a very clean old man\".\n\nMost definitely another vote for People Like Us. A kind of mockumentary about a guy filming people at work and interviewing them about their jobs. Despite being kind and well meaning he always somehow manages to fuck up the lives of his subjects, causing a crisis of faith in the vicar etc. You never see him properly but he is always 'narrating' and interjecting. Loads of good and well known Brit actors in it too.\n\nThis is underrated af. The show builds slowly but the characterisation and sense of place is brilliantly done and you fall in love with Dylan Moran and Charlotte Coleman (tragigiclly shortlived sister of Olivia). The comedy comes from Peter Serafinowitz (sp? I should know as I went to school with him) who is genuinely menacingly psychotic (and thuggishly sexy)"
