        "text": "Across the globe people struggle to understand the British sense of humour. Non-Brits can’t detect whether our sarcasm and self-deprecation is genuine, or if we’re making a funny. We are stereotypically deadpan, we show no emotion, and topics that might be taboo in other countries are fair game here in the UK. Courtesy of our heritage (namely the Victorian music halls), our comedy shows are littered with sexual innuendo and no swear word is off limits. It is something truly unique, and has led to the creation of some of the best TV programmes and films ever made. Admittedly, there isn’t much choice when it comes to British comedy on Netflix UK, and I didn’t discover anything new, but rather old favourites. I’ve whittled through small offering there is and have come up with my list of the Top 10 British Comedy TV Programmes on Netflix UK. In no particular order, here goes:\n\n1. Peep Show\n\nOK, maybe this list is in some particular order, because I’ve put my all time favourite at number one. The show is written by Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong, two of the most talented writers in the business who will feature again further down the list. In fact, Robert Downey Jr beat George Clooney and bought the rights to Armstrong’s Black Mirror script – but that’s a whole other story. But if RDJ and George think his writing’s good, you know it’s good.\n\nPeep Show follows the lives of two very different men who met at uni and up living together. Now, when I say the show ‘follows the lives’ of Mark (David Mitchell) and Jeremy (Robert Webb), I mean quite literally. The show’s unique selling point back in 2003 was that it is filmed from a point of view angle, meaning we literally see everything as the characters do. We are also often treated to their internal thoughts, dipping into the world of ‘taboo topics’ and providing us with hilarious entertainment. Mark, a dull man who works in finance, and Jeremy, a failed musician who loves experimenting with drugs, do not exactly see eye to eye on most topics and it is a constant battle between the two to put up with each other’s behaviour. Jeremy regularly drives Mark to the brink, and when his friend and bandmate Super Hans (an eccentric and spiritual crack addict played by Matt King, who features in the hilarious gif above) is around Mark is sure to end up on the verge of a mental breakdown. Mark’s lack of social skills provides endless entertainment and the writers have gifted Mark with some of the best one liners of all time, take for instance ‘Hitler promised not to invade Czechoslovakia, Jeremy. Welcome to the real world’; a line that will never fail to make me cry with laughter.The show has managed to attract very few negative reviews, and has won numerous awards, and all with very good reason. It’s an easy watch, with plenty of laughs and the episodes are only 20 minutes long. Click here to watch a snippet of one of my favourite episodes.\n\n2. The Office / Extras / Derek\n\nI’m kind of cheating here, but I couldn’t pick between Ricky Gervais’s three genius shows, so I picked them all. For me, Extras is Gervais at his best. The writing is class, the humour quick and witty and the celebrity cameos just top it all off. It is hard to pick a best episode, but I think it’s a toss up between Samuel L. Jackson’s and Kate Winslet’s. Winslet, who offers advice to Maggie (Ashley Jensen) regarding phone sex, is cuttingly funny, and I truly hope she is like that in real life. Having loved The Office I really didn’t think Gervais could get any better, but in my opinion Extras is twice as funny and far better executed.\n\nThe Office is a true classic. A revitalising lift for British TV back in 2001, the characters were simply brilliant, and David Brent’s social faux pas will never be unfunny. Amazingly, when first broadcast the show was almost cut due to dwindling audience numbers, but thankfully it has become the huge hit that it is, and led to the creation of its incredible American counterpart. When it comes to The Office, Extras and An Idiot Abroad people often pile the praise onto Gervais, forgetting that Stephen Merchant has played a huge role in the creation of these shows, but some of my favourite episodes of The Office are when Oggy (Merchant) pops up. In terms of ‘British humour’ I think The Office perfectly captures the phenomenon, as the humour is pretty black and twisted (in one of my favourite scenes David Brent uses rape as an extreme example to outdo a colleague in a role play activity). Is it better than the American Office? That’s an extremely difficult question, and I’m going to avoid it by saying they’re two completely different shows, equally as excellent.\n\nDerek is hilarious and heartwarming, the true balance for a brilliant comedy. Derek was inspired by Gervais’s family who work in care homes, and he has handled a difficult premise extremely well, with touching insights into the elderly residents’ lives. Derek suffers from an unnamed mental disability, and whilst some reviewers have criticised Gervais for mocking the mentally disabled, it seems to me that Gervais wanted to present a character who truly loved everything and treated everybody equally, regardless of race, age, gender etc. Admittedly, using the mockumentary style for a third show seemed a little brave, but I think Gervais has only improved on it and developed characters we as an audience can truly engage with.\n\n3. Him & Her\n\nNothing happens in Him & Her. I’m not joking. We very rarely leave Steve (Russell Tovey) and Becky’s (Sarah Solemani) flat. Much like the iconic Royle Family the show follows two unemployed layabouts who are happy to rot watching DVDs in their tiny flat. Now, this doesn’t sound like a great comedy show. But throw in a sociopathic sister, Laura (played by Russell Howard’s sister, Kerry), her secretly gay husband and a socially inept neighbour (the brilliant Joe Wilkinson) and you’ve got yourself a show. As with a lot of comedy shows it’s these supporting characters that make it, and Becky’s quiet friend Shelly (Camille Coduri) is my absolute favourite, especially when she can no longer take Laura’s shit and unleashes hell on her. Him & Her is observational comedy at its best. There’s no gimmicks; you probably know a couple like Becky and Steve who would rather wallow alone and avoid all human contact than leave their house. Like The Royle Family a lot of the humour is crude, but writer Stefan Golaszewski doesn’t overindulge and Steve and Becky are too loveable to frown upon anyway.\n\n4. The IT Crowd\n\nThe third of six of the shows on this list first broadcast by Channel 4! Much like David Brent of The Office and Mark Corrigan of Peep Show a lot of The IT Crowd‘s humour arises from the fact that the main characters cannot interact with other humans. Shut up in the basement of Reynholm Industries, Moss (Richard Ayoade), Roy (Chris O’Dowd) and Jen (Katherine Parkinson) rarely encounter other human beings, unless it is to say ‘have you tried turning it off and on again?’. Jen, the boss of the IT department, conveniently knows absolutely nothing about computers and managed to lie her way through the interview process. In the most hilarious episode Roy and Moss convince Jen that ‘The Internet’ is contained in a small black box in their office, which she uses as a prop for her presentation to the company’s shareholders. The acting is great, and each actor is willing to push their character to the extreme for laughs, especially O’Dowd. The show is slightly old fashioned in that it has a laughtrack, but The IT Crowd is another easy watch and induces constant laughter, mainly due to Moss, the first geek to be chic. Moss is possibly the most loveable character of any of the shows on this list, and it is hard to believe that his own mum took legal action against him when he kicked a football through a window as a child. The show also features regular appearances from the brilliant Noel Fielding and Matt Berry, both of whom only add to the hilarity.\n\n5. Gavin & Stacey\n\nI have to admit that I am potentially one of the biggest Gavin & Stacey fans out there, mainly due to the fact I spent a large amount of my childhood in Barry, the Welsh town featured in the show, and there’s always something quite nice about watching a show and seeing a place you recognise. Created and written by the stars Ruth Jones and James Corden, we follow the relationship between a bloke from Essex and girl from south Wales blossom. I don’t connect with Gavin (Mat Horne) or Stacey (Joanna Page), and find them both incredibly irritating, and I dislike James Corden (I can never forgive him for his egotistical outburst at the BAFTAs), so it seems strange to many that I would love such a show, given I dislike so many important features of it. But the writing is great, it’s perfect entertaining telly, and as per usual the supporting characters make the show. There is no-one funnier than Pam, (played by the exceptional Alison Steadman, whose Essex accent is quite simply impeccable) whose constant outbursts and fake vegetarianism provide brilliant comedy. Dawn (Julia Davis) and Pete’s (Adrian Scarborough) constant bickering is a highlight of the show and Dawn providing back up for Pam during an argument with Nessa is one of my favourite scenes, as the line ‘I’m telling her to punch you in the face, you truck driving dyke’ will stick with me forever. One of the shows favourites, Margaret John, who plays Doris, died in 2011 and I remember feeling distinctly sad, as her character brought so much joy to the show. If you’re looking for something to sit down and eat take away with your family to, this is a prime contender, and so long as you can overlook the annoyance of Gavin & Stacey, you’ll love it.\n\n6. Fresh Meat\n\nI said Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain would pop up again, and here’s the first revisit to their writing. A simple premise, it’s quite amazing that it hadn’t been done sooner. Six students, thrown together due to their late application to Manchester Medlock Uni (bar Howard, who just seems to have been there forever), have to go through the incredibly awkward process of living with people they wouldn’t necessarily pick as friends, and putting up with their odd behaviour. Sticking to the student classics, the show creates humour via the themes drugs, alcohol, sex and rowdy behaviour, and these students shared desire to be popular means they’re constantly drunk, on drugs, trying to have sex or protesting. As in reality, there’s the on-off couple, Kingsley (The Inbetweener‘s Joe Thomas) and Josie (Kimberley Nixon), whose PDAs cause disgust and outrage, the strange nerd Howard (Greg McHugh) and a couple of poshos, one trying to reinvent themselves (Charlotte Ritchie), the other desperately trying to be accepted by his fellow poshos (Jack Whitehall). The stand out performance comes from the exceptionally talented Zawe Ashton, who plays Vod (somehow short for Violet), a punk nutta who tolerates no bullshit, but deep down a lover, who will always protect her mates. Although the themes are predictable, the writing and acting make up for it, and by the end of it you really just wanna move in with them all and get pissed on cheap cider. It is slightly farfetched, but I could definitely see a lot of similarities between my own university experience and the Fresh Meat students’ lives. A particular highlight is when the students travel down to London to participate in a student protest, except JP (Whitehall) who ‘only wanted to watch the fucking rugby!’, but eventually he ends up getting into the swing of things and being kettled and assaulted. When asked if he wants an ambulance he replies ‘no, it’s fine. I’m with Bupa’, classic.\n\n7. The Thick of It\n\nAh, Malcolm Tucker, the eloquent Scottish spin doctor. Nobody swears like Malcolm Tucker. Nobody. Another addition to the list cowritten by Jesse Armstrong, TTOI comes from the mind of the superb Armando Iannucci. Although the topic, a poliitcal satire of the modern day British government, may seem niche, I challenge you not to laugh at this show. It’s never been confirmed, but it is assumed that Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s spin doctor, was the inspiration for Tucker (Peter Capaldi) and the two certainly share similarities. But it’s better not to get bogged down in the realism of the show, and appreciate the hilariously quick and witty writing and the outstanding acting. I would love to see some outtakes from this show, because there is no way an actor could’ve stood without laughing whilst an angry Scotsman shouts ‘I’ve got a to do list here that’s longer than a fucking Leonard Cohen song’. Capaldi aside, the standout performances come from the ladies of the cast. Nicola Murray MP, played by Rebecca Front, regularly challenges Malcolm, creating brilliant scenes. But the best of the bunch is Terri Coverley (Joanna Scanlan), the world’s worst PR, who previously worked for Waitrose, and is swept in a bid to market the government like a business. Terri is often at the brunt of Malcolm’s outbursts, but in one standout episode makes an attempt to challenge him, referring to him as ‘a sultana in a salad’ only infuriating him further. If you like to actually LOL whilst watching TV shows I advise you to watch TTOI as you will LOL. Very loud.\n\n8. The Inbetweeners\n\nProbably the biggest comedy show in Britain in the last 15 years, the third series of The Inbetweeners was followed by two films and is still constantly broadcast on E4. In fact, if you’re from the UK you should probably skip this entry as you will have undoubtedly already seen the show at some point and have made your own mind up.\n\nFollowing four ordinary schoolboys, who aren’t popular, but aren’t geeks either (Inbetweeners, see? Smart) we enjoy the failed escapades as the boys desperately try and be cool. The writers could have gone down an innuendo lined route (just as the writers of Horne & Corden did and desperately failed) but instead the writing is smart, with just the right amount of horrendous (and fake) sex stories from Jay (James Buckley) and inappropriate sharing from Neil (Blake Harrison). You can’t help but constantly cringe and feel sorry for these boys, but they really do bring it upon themselves, adding to the hilarity. The giant Greg Davies, who plays the disinterested head of sixth form Mr. Gilbert and the running joke – between both kids and parents – that Neil’s dad is in fact a gay man provide extra entertainment throughout the three series. Will’s relationship with the queen of the school Charlotte Hinchcliffe (Emily Atack) is actually quite sweet, and although it inevitably ends badly, you can’t help but feel he was actually too good for her. I must admit that the films were dire in comparison to the TV show, and there definitely wasn’t a need for a second film.\n\n9. I’m Alan Partridge\n\nAlan Partridge (Steve Coogan) is like a fictional Jeremy Clarkson. Always saying the wrong thing, never politically correct and attracting complaints from the general public, it’s almost as if Clarkson has based his own life on Alan. Following the success of the BBC Radio 4 programme On The Hour Armando Iannucci and Steve Coogan created the fictional chat show Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge, which launched Alan’s catchphrase ‘AHA!’. Two years later, I’m Alan Partridge came along, and I much prefer it to Knowing Me, Knowing You as the character is more developed, and the sitcom style allows for far funnier scenarios.\n\nUnlike Clarkson, the majority of people seem to like Alan, and no matter what situation he gets himself in you always find yourself rooting for him. His relationship with his trusty PA Lynn (Felicity Montagu) is hilarious, and I dread to think of all the unspeakable things she knows about Alan. Although a parody – and therefore by definition an extreme exaggeration of – middle class England and its values, the character is completely believable and you’re able to see bits of people you know in Alan (or, in my case, he is exactly the same as my father). What makes Alan so loveable is his inability to see any wrongdoing. This is just a man, doing his job, attempting to entertain you and accidentally using terms that aren’t PC anymore. Like The Inbetweeners, an Alan Partridge film was released in 2013, but unlike The Inbetweeners the film was funny, the writers hadn’t run out of ideas, and no matter how outdated the ideals Alan is based on are, Iannucci and Coogan managed to make the character as fresh and exciting as ever.\n\n10. Fawlty Towers\n\nWe end our list with a British classic. Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) will go down in comedy history, and rightly so. The BBC claim that Fawlty Towers is the sitcom ‘by which all other British sitcoms must be judged’, and although initially not well received way back in 1975, Fawlty Towers continues to be popular to this day. Far from the revolutionary Monty Python, Fawlty Towers sees Cleese in a more traditional sitcom role. The creation of Cleese and Connie Booth, Fawlty Towers is the hotel of Basil and Sybil (Prunella Scales), and the show features their chambermaid, Polly (Booth) and a Spanish waiter named Manuel with incredibly poor English (Andrew Sachs). Basil Fawlty is everything a hotel proprietor should not be. Unfriendly, arrogant and uptight, Basil has little patience for his wife, staff and guests, and his explosive temper allows for many a moment of hilarity. The brilliant thing about Fawlty Towers is that each episode there are different guests, with different problems to wind Basil up. Ultimately, Manuel will always bear the brunt of Basil’s anger, and there are no scenes funnier than when Basil becomes more and more irate as he attempts to communicate with the Spaniard. Although not as new and outrageous as Monty Python, Fawlty Towers is a sitcom done well, and will remain a pinnacle of British comedy for a very long time.\n\nOther noteworthy shows that didn’t make the Top 10 include: Friday Night Dinner, The Royle Family and The Mighty Boosh\n\nAbout a week ago I started writing a review of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, but then I remembered OITNB was soon to be released, so I got sucked into the hype and started re-watching the first two series. I finished the third season last night and have had some time to mull it over and here are my thoughts… (Please don’t read any further if you don’t want to know what happens!)\n\nPIPER ISSUES\n\nPiper’s self-delusion only worsens this season and she becomes completely unbearable. The writers’ focus is definitely off Piper, Alex and their past, and the show opens up to the other characters (more on that later…), but everything Piper said or did irritated me. She constantly reassures herself she is a nice person, only doing immoral things for the benefit of others, but this series shows her for what she really is – as Alex so eloquently puts it – ‘a manipulative c**t’. Piper has no moral compass, everything she does is for herself, and she rightfully recognises she cannot be alone, so she simply uses people to keep her company when she wants it. The reality is she thinks she is a strong, independent woman that teaches bitches when they gots to learn, but she is a needy, pathetic whiner. I never really liked the modern day Piper, but during the flashbacks to her young and naive years she was slightly more likeable, but still irritating. Just like at the end of series one Piper has relatively few friends at the end of this series, no Stella, no Alex, no Nicky to remind her she’s being a prick. But now she’s turned into an ice queen and apparently feels nothing, so it will be interesting to see how her reign of Litchfield pans out in series 4.\n\nRUBY ROSE\n\nFrom what I can gather from Twitter everyone is in love with Ruby Rose. She is very hot, and while silent in the background was alluring, but as Stella began to talk and revealed her character I just didn’t warm to her. She reminded me of a mini Piper with tattoos and short hair. Completely disregarding how her actions might affect others, she did whatever she pleased, and although aware of Alex, she had no problem indulging in some PDA with Piper. I feel like there was such potential for Stella to rock the boat and it just didn’t happen! The writers have introduced new characters like Stella and Berdie, but they just haven’t made the impact they appeared they would in trailers.\n\nTHE FLASHBACKS\n\nIt might just be me, but there were far too many flashbacks, too often. It almost felt as if the writers were scared they wouldn’t have enough time to unveil everyone’s past so went OTT with it now. Big Boo’s flashback was particularly poignant, but Nicky’s felt predictable and too obvious to be included. Bennett’s showed what kind of man he really is, but I was so certain he’d come back by the end of the series and couldn’t believe it when it ended without a trace of him. As I previously mentioned, the writers have moved their focus from Alex and Piper and have opened up the storylines of other characters, but Norma’s seemed long-winded and if I’m honest I feel the whole series could have done without it. That being said, Annie Golden’s performance was outstanding, and it is amazing how she can captivate a viewer without even speaking.\n\nTHE GUARDS AND THE CORPORATION\n\nSome of the scenes I most enjoyed were actually just the guards. Definitely not Fig and Caputo’s hate sex, but O’Neill leading a chorus of ‘Do You Hear The People Sing?’ in a pub was a highlight for me. I’ve always loved Bell and her mordant wit, and with the drama the new ownership causes she has even more time to shine, dropping in sarcastic remarks at every possible opportunity. I thought the new counsellor, Berdie, would cause more waves, but her story seemed to come to an abrupt end and she drifted off without causing much trouble, however, I hope she comes back in series 4 to piss Healy off even more. The introduction of new untrained COs seemed bizarre, as I thought surely such a thing would never happen in reality. The new CO Coates and Pennsatucky’s storyline was hard to watch, and afforded me a sense of empathy I never thought I would have for Pennsatucky, whilst terrifying me because it brought to light the fact there are women out there that believe men have a right to sex, and therefore it can’t be classed as rape. Big Boo has been the star of the series for me, and her new BFFship with Pennsatucky was heartwarming and shows if you disregard society’s labels anyone can get along, but I am glad Pennsatucky stopped the planned sadistic payback Boo wanted to carry out on Coates. I am really hoping that somehow Litchfield becomes a government prison again, because the hoards of inmates arriving ready to fill the new bunkbeds will only swamp storylines, just as our main characters were beginning to mesh better.\n\nCLIFFHANGERS\n\nJesus Christ. We have to wait another YEAR now. Will Nicky ever come back from Max? Has Alex finally met the end she was so paranoid about? Will Piper still be a dick? Where is Bennett? Will Sophia get out of the SHU? What will happen to the Diaz children? How many inmates will escape after they’ve had their fun in the lake? I appreciate that suspense is necessary to keep us watching next series, but this is too much! This series was ultimately disappointing to me, but it did have a lot to live up to. What was most disappointing was the weak ending. For me, there was nothing great to take away and talk about, just a load of questions that won’t be answered for 12 months that I’ll forget about by tomorrow.\n\nOverall, I was just disappointed. Series 2 was one of the best seasons of TV I have watched in a long, long time, and this third season just didn’t live up to expectations. I feel like too much was going on, and everything was thrown together. The acting was still incredible, and the writing itself was amazing. I still went through the emotional rollercoaster ride I did with the previous two series, but the stories themselves were weak and thrown together. If you’ve read my review of seasons 1 and 2 of OITNB you’ll know I gave it 5/5 stars, so this is a shock for both you and I…:\n\n★★★ THREE STARS"
