        "text": "If you are feeling as over-stuffed on seasonal jollity as you are on pigs in blankets then, surprisingly, this Alan Partridge documentary might be just in order. The fictional comedy character first appeared in 1991 on the Radio 4 satirical news show On the Hour. This year, the Radio Norwich presenter will return to the BBC where he first broke through as a solo star on 1994’s Knowing Me, Knowing You.\n\nFor a comedy character not just to survive but indeed thrive and grow in popularity over more than a quarter of a century is quite an achievement. Rowan Atkinson’s Mr Bean, which started in 1991, only lasted five years. Basil Fawlty’s entire reputation rests upon six hours of Fawlty Towers. David Brent lasted two series of The Office before Ricky Gervais needed to take a 10-year break, and Ali G, who lasted four years, is unlikely to be seen again. All these characters have outlasted their dramatic existence. More so, they have often loomed over their creator’s careers, leading to most of them having to be “killed off”.\n\nIt’s hard to know what Steve Coogan actually makes of the Frankenstein’s monster he, along with Armando Iannucci, Patrick Marber, Rebecca Front, David Schneider and Chris Morris conjured up to fill their sketch show. All appear on the rather serious consideration of the phenomenon Alan Partridge: Why, When, Where, How and Whom?\n\nWhile all these names have become comedy heavyweights, you feel there is some measure of revenge for Coogan, who felt like an outsider among the group of Oxbridge insiders. They were all at the vanguard of shaping a new comedy that parodied the media, pushed irony to the forefront, and created a humour of discomfort and alienation.\n\nPartridge was the desperate man stuck in an old-fashioned world of catchphrases and casual sexism. But even while it mocked the old school, it was the old-fashioned catchphrases like “A-ha” and “back of the net” that elevated Partridge to the position of alternative national treasure.\n\nThe key to Partridge’s survival, Coogan reveals, is how extensively he continues to think through his biography; how consistent he has been to this fiction; but also, and probably most critically, his ability to adapt and change the character, and the writing team behind him.\n\nPartridge in 1991 started off as caricature of a media figure; in 2017, he taps into everything from Brexit Britain to the rise of narcissism in the age of social media. You can’t imagine he’d have survived 2017 without being implicated in a few sexual harassment cases.\n\nSadly, Coogan doesn’t really open up that much, especially not about his own excesses when Partridge made him into a household name in the 1990s. It would also have been fascinating to see him discuss what it is like to not be able to escape your own comic monster with the likes of Gervais or Sacha Baron Cohen. It’s hard to know whose ego stopped that."
