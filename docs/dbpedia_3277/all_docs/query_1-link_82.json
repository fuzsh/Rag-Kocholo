        "text": "First on this tape, episode 10 of Between The Lines series one, Nothing to Declare.\n\nNicky Henson is a Chief Superintendent retiring, using his speech to complain at political correctness. Nothing changes.\n\nKeith Allen is a customs investigator who was observing what he claims to be a meeting between drugs squad officers and drug traffickers.\n\nAllen’s associate is played by Paul Higgins. I couldn’t place him, but I knew I’d seen him in something else. He was suspect copper Derek Hilton in Line of Duty.\n\nWe see part of the scam that’s being investigated – People trying to get into Britain are taken in a container, and they are forced to swallow drug packets as part of the cost. It’s all a bit horrible.\n\nAll in all, this was a rather depressing series, wasn’t it?\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 19th March 1994 – 22:15\n\nNever mind, though, here’s something to cheer you up. It’s an episode of Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge. It’s actually the first episode, and his first guest is horse rider Sue Lewis, played by the peerless Rebecca Front.\n\nAlan brings out her horse, and asks her if she’d jump a jump. She explains she can’t, as it’s a concrete floor and would damage the horse’s legs. “Please don’t break my legs” she says.\n\nThe next guest is the new host of This is Your Life Keith Hunt, played by Cornish curmudgeon Patrick Marber.\n\n“I’ve just been told that Roger Moore is at Chiswick Roundabout”.\n\nAlan brings on Hunt’s son. But because of custody arrangements he can’t come within ten feet of him. And it’s birthday, which Keith has forgotten.\n\n“Can someone clear that shit away? It’s in my picture.”\n\nDoon Mackichan provides the music as Shona McGough, which starts off like this.\n\nAnd ends up like this.\n\n“This is interesting, a lady drummer. Close your eyes it could have been a man.”\n\nThe show concludes with ‘An Audience with Roger Moore’ as they wait for the arrival of the actor.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 16th September 1994 – 22:00\n\nThe next episode opens with Alan talking about critical reaction to the show. “I looked up moribund in the dictionary.” I didn’t realise that this might have been inspired by an actual event featuring, who else, Noel Edmonds. And I saw this retweeted by someone into my twitter timeline just yesterday. Because that’s how Twitter works.\n\nHis first guest is Playboy’s agony aunt Daniella Forrest, played by Minnie Driver. I’m not sure this part really gets away with Alan’s appalling transphobia, though.\n\nAlan meets another man named Alan Partridge, Petty Officer Alan Partridge, played by John Thomson.\n\nThe magnificent David Schneider plays magician Tony le Mesmer.\n\nHollywood couple Tanya Beaumont and Gary Barker are the next guests.\n\nI like the bit where Alan brings on a photocopier, because Gary used to repair photocopiers as a job. “I don’t do that shit any more.”\n\nFinally, Alan straps himself to the wheel of death, as Tony le Mesmer throws daggers at him.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 23rd September 1994 – 22:00\n\nThat’s all the Alan Partridge on this tape, as we leap forward to Christmas. There’s a bit of Eastenders, a trailer for The Addams Family, and a long trailer new dramas The Buccaneers and Dangerfield.\n\nThen, a festive episode of 2point4 Children. Bill has gathered the family to ask about why the phone bill is so high. It’s an interesting point in time scene. First, daughter Jenny has been calling her boyfriend long distance, which is a plot point from the mists of time. But son David has been connecting his computer to ‘the internet’ and receiving Christmas greetings from all over the world. Bearing in mind this was Christmas 1994, it’s understandable that none of the family understand what he’s talking about. I love this collision of venerable and utterly new. Wikipedia suggests this might be the earliest mention of the Internet in a UK comedy.\n\nNot that the practical details of ‘the internet’ are necessarily convincing. When we see David on his computer, he’s concerned because he’s talking to someone who ‘dialled me up’. And whoever it is, it knows who Bill is.\n\nAnd whoever it is offers Bill some Christmas wishes.\n\nAnd it’s able to do whatever she asks for. Including something Rona asked for.\n\nThe lovely Liz Smith appears as a relative.\n\nWhen they family realise that the Bill the computer was looking for was President Bill Clinton, they make a quick exit to France, and the show ends with a song and dance number in what looks like the Noel’s House Party set.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 26th December 1994 – 20:40\n\nAfter this, a trailer for The Lenny Henry Christmas Show. There’s also trailers for Midnight Movie and Dick Tracy.\n\nThen, there’s a whole movie, The Addams Family which isn’t marked on my database, probably because this was just a run-on, and I already had the movie recorded elsewhere, as seen on this tape.\n\nEdited to add: I just learned that Pablo Ferro, the famed title designer, who did the titles for The Addams Family among many others, died a few days ago. I’m so very sorry.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 26th December 1994 – 21:10\n\nFollowing this, there’s a trailer for Gorillas in the Mist.\n\nThen, a news bulletin, leading with the end of a hijack of an Air France plane. It wasn’t the best rescue, since many of the passengers were injured, although all the hijackers were killed. The pictures of the assault are quite scary. A pilot climbs out of the cockpit and falls to the ground, and as the commandos try to breach the door at the front, the stairway slides back, leaving one of the commandos just hanging on to the door. It shows the actual chaos of real life, as compared with the slick operations we see in movies.\n\nThe tape ends during the sport.\n\nThe first episode here is from a much later series than the last time we caught up with Garry.\n\nIt’s Garry’s wedding, to Phoebe (Jessica Harper) and things aren’t starting well, as he’s asked almost every man he knows to be his best man during the stag night, including agent Brad (Bruno Kirby).\n\nWhen they learn that the Edgewood Manor, the venue of their wedding, has burnt down, the studio head, Mr Stravely, comes to the rescue by offering to host the wedding on television.\n\nAs a result, there’s loads of celebrity cameos, and, as we’ve come to expect from the show, some cameos that are meaningless to the UK audience.\n\nNed Beatty is the Best Man.\n\nBert Convy apparently hosts Win, Lose or Draw.\n\nThese two are ice skaters Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner. “What are you guys doing here?” “We don’t know.”\n\nAmong the guests trailed on the show, Dr Haing S Ngor, star of The Killing Fields. I love this joke.\n\nCharles Nelson Reilly is directing the show. I didn’t recognise him, and the only thing I would have seen him is is The X Files, as Jose Chung.\n\nAnd Connie Stevens does a big production number.\n\nBefore the next episode, there’s the end of an episode of Night Court, featuring an appearance from Michael Richards.\n\nIn the next episode of It’s Garry Shandling’s Show, there’s a cameo right from the start, from Martin Mull, who is at least familiar from Roseanne. A feud ensues when Phoebe gives him the bill for redecorating his house, and he thinks it’s far too high.\n\nAnother meaningless cameo, this one from Dave Coulier.\n\nJoy Behar plays Mull’s wife.\n\nThey even receive a message from God.\n\nThe next episode is out of order – it’s The Honeymoon Show. Phoebe and Garry are on Honeymoon. You must be at least this tall to watch.\n\nThe night gets a bit steamy.\n\nBut they’re interrupted by a phone call telling them that Phoebe’s Grandpa died.\n\nReturning to the honeymoon suite, they are again interrupted with more bad news. Another member of Phoebe’s family has died.\n\nThe next episode, Leonard Gets Metaphysical, only features Garry in the intro, as he’s going on tour with Guns n Roses. He leaves young Grant in charge of the show, and leaves him with a box of all his wisdom\n\nThere’s an election for Condo president, and Leonard Smith always wins, but a new resident, a Frenchman called Jacques, decides to stand, and is elected.\n\nHe’s clearly a gifted physical comedian.\n\nGrant has to open the box of wisdom to get help in solving the situation.\n\nThere’s another bit of Night Court before the next episode.\n\nGarry is still on tour with Guns n Roses\n\nMr Stravely comes round to the apartment to find out where Garry is. While he’s there, Phoebe’s brother Chester pitches a sitcom idea, ‘Bob Who?’\n\nAmazingly, Mr Stravely loves it and puts it on in place of Garry’s show. Playing the other Bob is Ryan Stiles.\n\nI totally didn’t recognise him, but Chester is played by Paul Feig, now a powerhouse movie producer and director.\n\nChester likes to play Super Mario. And Paul Feig wrote the theme tune to his show.\n\nThe next episode sees Garry, a month into marriage. Suddenly, Phoebe has turned into his mother.\n\nIt’s affecting all the men.\n\nIn the next episode, Phoebe is doing a pregnancy test.\n\nGarry can’t wait for the results, so he uses his magic clock to go forward in time 18 minutes.\n\nBut he gets it wrong, and goes forward 18 years. So he meets his son, Mario.\n\nAnd his daughter, Darcy.\n\nNeighbour Ian has been suffering a brain injury ever since a brick fell out of Garry’s roof onto his head.\n\nThe next episode has a guest appearance from Chris Isaak, who plays the theme song.\n\nGarry’s upset that his agent Brad (Bruno Kirby) is spending so much time promoting Chris Isaak so he sacks him.\n\nHis neighbour Pete gets him a gig advertising Hormone 5000 beard growing cream.\n\nChris Isaak is booked to sings the national anthem at a ballgame, but he just wants to sing Garry’s theme again.\n\nLeonard Smith showered in Hormone 5000.\n\nThat’s the last episode on this tape, The tape ends after this episode as Sky One just starts showing this title card for tomorrow’s programmes until the tape runs out.\n\nAdverts:\n\ntrail: Tomorrow on Sky\n\nTake My Breath Away\n\ntrail: Picket Fences\n\nBird’s Eye Potato Waffles\n\nCocktail of Hits\n\ntrail: Sky Sports\n\nQVC\n\ntrail: Basic Instinct\n\ntrail: Paradise Beach\n\nHalls Soothers\n\nTake My Breath Away\n\ntrail: Sky Movies\n\ntrail: Paradise Beach\n\nBisto Best\n\nFosters\n\nSky Plus\n\ntrail: The Super\n\ntrail: Basic Instinct\n\nBarclaycard\n\nFosters\n\ntrail: The Simpsons\n\ntrail: Exposure\n\nYoung at Heart\n\ntrail: Paradise Beach\n\nTake My Breath Away\n\ntrail: Basic Instinct\n\ntrail: The Simpsons\n\ntrail: E Street\n\nYoung at Heart\n\nLove-Match\n\nSky Plus\n\ntrail: Tomorrow on the Movie Channels\n\ntrail: Picket Fences\n\nFrosties\n\nFosters\n\nLove-Match\n\ntrail: Tomorrow on the Movie Channels\n\nCocktail of Hits\n\ntrail: Sky Sports\n\ntrail: Paradise Beach\n\nYoung at Heart\n\ntrail: The Movie Channel\n\ntrail: The Simpsons\n\nCocktail of Hits\n\ntrail: Golf\n\nThis tape opens with the end of Eastenders.\n\nThen, four episodes from the second series of Terry Nation’s post-plague grimfest.\n\nFirst, it’s The Witch. Charles and Greg are working on the old mill, trying to get it turning through water power.\n\nCreepy Hubert is leching after Mina. She’s not interested. So he tells the two young children that Mina puts children in the oven, making them afraid of her.\n\nHe stirs things up, and some of the villagers seem to believe that Mina is doing some kind of voodoo. It seems odd that all these seemingly middle-class people seem very quick to fall into superstitious thinking. But Mina doesn’t help things when she makes a clay head of Charles, presumably because she fancies him, and another woman sees it and thinks it’s more voodoo.\n\nIt all seems sorted out by the end, though.\n\nThe next episode is A Friend in Need, written by series star Ian McCulloch. Oh dear, there’s a heavy breather with a sniper rifle.\n\nCharles and Greg have called a meeting of the leaders of all the local communities. They’re all a bit suspicious of motives.\n\nWhen news comes of the murder of the wife of one of the men at the meeting, Greg and Charles accompany him home, and embark on a bit of CSI Herefordshire. Eight women have been murdered recently.\n\nOh dear, the two children have guns, and the little boy wants to shoot someone. This could end badly.\n\nThere’s some interesting debate about who the sniper is, and why he’s doing what he’s doing. Greg makes a remark that’s a bit chilling. “He’s killed eight defenceless girls that could have had children.”\n\nIn the end, Jenny is put out as a potential target, in order to flush the sniper out. This is quite tense stuff.\n\nGreg spots the sniper and walks in front of his sights, so he doesn’t shoot. The next day, the villagers start beating through the woods to flush the sniper out.\n\nWhile Greg and Charles are lying in wait for the sniper, Greg intending to shoot him, the little boy tells Jenny that he was playing with the shotgun “and this fell out”. I presume it’s the firing pin or some other important component.\n\nThe children run out to tell Greg and Charles what they did. It’s getting really tense now.\n\nGreg’s gun misfires, so he has to get his hands dirty. And there’s a surprising revelation at the end, as the sniper is a woman. Sadly, her motivations remain unclear.\n\nThe next episode is By Bread Alone. One of the settlement reveals he was a priest before the plague.\n\nAll of a sudden, everyone seems to want him to be their priest, say mass (awkward when it’s a catholic woman asking, and he’s CofE). And he seems extremely reluctant to actually act as a priest.\n\nAnd Greg is very unhappy that people seem to be wanting to flock towards their new priest, and ignore the important work that needs doing so the settlement can actually eat.\n\nBut Charles is shocked when two new young people who had recently joined them have decided to move on. They said that the community was turning into a totalitarian state, with a worker class and a boss class. Charles disagrees with Greg on this. He thinks people should be allowed to find their way in their own time, even if it’s not the most efficient use of their time or resources. I love way this show thinks seriously about the way people work together, and the practical things that have to be done.\n\nBefore the next episode, there’s the end of Eastenders.\n\nThen, another episode of Survivors called The Chosen. Charles and Pet are returning from collecting salt, and when they stop for the night, they meet another couple, a couple of young hippies. And when the hippies fall ill in the night, they have to take them to the nearest settlement, one run by soldiers. James Cosmo is one of the soldier types.\n\nThey have time for doing aerobics. It’s a Boomph with Becker crossover.\n\nPhilip Madoc seems to be in charge. They’re not impressed with Charles’ proto-marxist ideas. And the militaristic setup worries Pet.\n\nThey’re also a little culty, claiming they were saved by God.\n\nBut the programme ends with a bit of a palace coup, as Madoc’s second in command, Clare Kelly, arranges to discredit Madoc when Charles speaks to their community. It’s a way to somehow temper the extremes of Madoc’s command.\n\nAfter this, there’s the start of the Ronnie Barker comedy series, Seven of One. It co-stars Prunella Scales.\n\nRecording stops a little while into this, and underneath there’s an older recording of The Bill. The tape ends shortly after.\n\nAdverts:\n\ntrail: Top of the Pops\n\ntrail: Doctor Who – The Face of Evil\n\nMrs Doubtfire in cinemas\n\nCommercial Union\n\nAllied\n\nThomas Cook\n\nHorlicks\n\nPhilishave\n\nPost Office\n\nPaxo\n\nCrisp ‘n Dry\n\nBatchelors Savoury Rice\n\nRenault 19\n\nLeeds Liquid Gold\n\nPond’s\n\nPost Office\n\nVeno’s\n\nPanadol Ultra\n\nLook Again\n\nSeat Ibiza\n\nCommercial Union\n\nPhilips CD-i\n\nAriston\n\nMrs Doubtfire in cinemas\n\nHorlicks\n\nLe Crunch\n\nPost Office\n\nVeno’s\n\nJust for Men\n\nKleenex Quilted\n\nVanish Gel\n\nDay Nurse\n\nDrugs & Solvents\n\nHotpoint\n\nLeeds Liquid Gold\n\nBatchelor’s Cup a Soup\n\nCommercial Union\n\nPhilips CD-i\n\nI Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter\n\nPost Office\n\nJust for Men\n\nDHL\n\nPhilips CD-i\n\nVidal Sassoon\n\nPontin’s\n\nLook Again\n\nNescafe\n\nMrs Doubtfire in cinemas\n\nJacob’s Club\n\nFlash Liquid\n\nPost Office\n\nNescafe\n\nSpain\n\nLeaders of the Pack\n\nPost Office\n\nVicks VapoRub\n\nJust for Men\n\nDHL\n\nThomson\n\nBoots\n\nTSB\n\nJust for Men\n\nSlim-Fast\n\nCrosse & Blackwell Simply Fix\n\nSainsbury’s\n\nMaxwell House\n\nVW Passat\n\nJohnson’s Baby Skincare\n\nRimmel Silks\n\nMr Sheen\n\nAriston\n\nTSB\n\nFamily Channel\n\nFairy Liquid\n\ntrail: Doctor Who – The Keys of Marinus\n\ntrail: Hannay\n\nThis tape opens with Peter Snow in a curiously bucolic setting, discussing genetic engineering. Is this the oddest set that Newsnight have ever used?\n\nThere’s a trailer for Doing Rude Things.\n\nThen, the second episode in a week of Letterman in London. It opens with a silly skit with Pierce Brosnan.\n\nPaul Shaffer’s house band has two rather amazing guests, Chuck Berry\n\nand Little Richard. Either one would be a huge guest, but they have both of them.\n\nDave goes around London sampling food and drink, accompanied by Zsa Zsa Gabor\n\nThey send one of their writers (Steve Young) out to Trafalgar Square with a suit covered in bird seed.\n\nA town crier does the top ten\n\nPierce Brosnan is the first guest, hotfoot from the Pinewood stages where he was shooting Goldeneye.\n\nDave’s Mom is around town.\n\nJennifer Saunders is the next guest, saying how nice it is to be interviewed on her own, as she’s usually with Dawn French or Joanna Lumley.\n\nAt which point Joanna Lumley appears. She’s really good here, in character as an overbearing, more successful actress.\n\nThere’s music from Elvis Costello and the Attractions.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 23rd May 1995 – 23:15\n\nAs the next episode starts, I’m scrolling through twitter, and randomly there’s a tweet about David Letterman, not someone who’s constantly being talked about. Yet another example of the strange synchronicity this blog turns up.\n\nFirst guest is Peter O’Toole, who comes out on a camel.\n\n“My noble transport is a little thirsty”\n\nHe’s so louche.\n\nThere’s music, with an extremely eccentric performance by Van Morrisson\n\nJoined by Sinead O’Connor\n\nAnd the Chieftans.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 24th May 1995 – 23:15\n\nBefore the next episode, there’s the end of Newsnight, talking about cricket.\n\nThere’s a trailer for Children of the Video\n\nThen, the next episode of Letterman in London. Jamie Lee Curtis shows us her passport.\n\nTop Ten Reasons why John Cleese can’t be here tonight\n\nJamie Lee Curtis joins Dave as a guest. She’s currently filming Fierce Creatures with Cleese, hence the expectation he might be there.\n\nAnd she’s brought her dad.\n\nDave’s Mom visits St Paul’s Cathedral\n\nDavid Duchovny is another guest\n\nMusic from Mary Chapin Carpenter\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 25th May 1995 – 23:15\n\nThere’s a trailer for Forbidden Weekend. Then Weather from Peter Cockroft\n\nThen recording switches to another episode of Letterman in London. There’s a very funny segment where he talks to people in London about stuff, and he asks this woman what she likes about America. She answers ‘Disneyworld’.\n\nThen they cut to her – in Disneyworld.\n\nClancy (with the beard) had a porkchop for breakfast.\n\nLetterman regulars Mujibur and Sirajul turn up.\n\nClancy keeps appearing in this segment.\n\nUntil the end, when we see that he got to go to Disneyworld too.\n\nAnd they’re in the studio that evening.\n\nSalman Rushdie delivers the night’s Top Ten list.\n\nMeg Ryan is the first guest. She doesn’t seem as nervous as she’s been on other talk shows in Britain.\n\nI wonder if Annie Lennox had been to Disneyworld too.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 26th May 1995 – 23:15\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for Forbidden Weekend, then the recording stops. Underneath, there’s a quite interesting programme about maths, from the Open University.\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for Doing Rude Things.\n\nThen more weather from Peter Cockroft.\n\nThen there’s a trailer for Fine Cut featuring two programmes, one of which was about a far right nationalist candidate for the Russian presidency, Tripping with Zhirinovsky. TV was treating these people as cranky eccentrics even then.\n\nThen, the tape ends during an episode of The Record, about the week in Westminster.\n\nOver to UK Gold again, for some Tom Baker Doctor Who, The Creature from the Pit.\n\nThis is from during Douglas Adams’ tenure as script editor, so I can’t help seeing echoes of his style, even though this serial was credited to David Fisher. Fisher was the first writer on the classic City of Death before the whole script was rewritten by Adams and producer Graham Williams in a hurry, and became one of the greatest stories in the series history.\n\nThis one isn’t as well regarded, but I’m definitely enjoying the quippy dialogue.\n\nThe jungle set, shot on film, looks really good, much better than a lot of sets in this period.\n\nEileen Way is good as Karela, one of the leaders.\n\n“What’s this?” “We call it The Pit.” “You have such a way with words.”\n\nThere’s a nice cliffhanger, as the Doctor takes matters into his own hands, and jumps into the pit himself.\n\nIn the next episode, the Doctor needs to swot up. You can really see Douglas Adams’ humour in things like this.\n\nRomana is taken by Adrasta, with the Doctor presumed to be dead soon because of the Creature in the Pit. “We call it The Creature” “That’s original” That’s not quite the same joke as in the previous episode, but it’s close. “Our researchers divide into two categories. The ones that have got close enough to find out something about it, and the ones who are still alive.”\n\nK9 got a bit wrapped up by the wolf weed, mobile, predatory plantlife.\n\nDown at the bottom of the pit, the Doctor gets his first glimpse of the Creature. Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear.\n\nOn the other hand, hooray, it’s Geoffrey Bayldon. He’s playing some kind of soothsayer, very much in the Slartibartfast mould. His name is Organon.\n\nAfter this episode, recording switches to Sky One and the end of an episode of MASH.\n\nThen, an X Files episode from Season One, Genderbender. It starts off in a nightclub. I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed a scene in a movie for TV show set in a nightclub. But then, a lot of that comes from me not remotely being a nightclub person, even when I was young.\n\nA woman picks up a man at the nightclub, they have sex, then the man has a heart attack, and the woman transforms into a man. Somehow, the trail leads to an old religious sect in the woods.\n\nThere’s an appearance from Nicholas Lea as another almost-victim of the killer. They obviously liked him, as he would turn up as a regular later, as Alex Krycek.\n\nIn the end, ooooooooh, were they all aliens?\n\nAfter this, recording continues, and we get a few minutes of Crime International.\n\nThen, recording switches to UK Gold and the end of a Kenny Everett programme.\n\nThen, part three of The Creature from the Pit.\n\nThe Doctor tries to communicate with the creature. Oh dear again.\n\nIt becomes clear, as the Doctor communicates, that Adrasta knows a lot more about the Creature than she’s letting on.\n\nThis episode has a really odd cliffhanger, as two members of the rather dimwitted tribe of men bring in a device that the creature has told the Doctor it wants, and they attach it to the creature. All the threat here is on Adrasta, which makes it a strange cliffhanger.\n\nThe creature was on the planet to trade with the locals, exchanging their chorophyll with the metals that are abundant on his world. But Adrasta trapped him in the pit. So Adrasta gets her just desserts, attacked by the wolf weed.\n\nBut the episode isn’t half over, and there’s a new threat. The creature’s people learned about his imprisonment, and have sent a Neutron Star to destroy the planet. The Doctor has to use the Tardis to deflect it. Great effects!\n\nAfter this, the recording continues with the start of Woman of the Year, and the tape ends after about an hour of it.\n\nAdverts:\n\nViennetta\n\nOil of Ulay\n\nJif Microliquid\n\nDaz Ultra – Paul Ross Danny Baker\n\nLenor Ultra Plus\n\nPAL\n\nMother’s Boys in cinemas\n\n7Up\n\nGino Ginelli – Alistair McGowan\n\nHellmann’s\n\nSurf Micro\n\nSimoniz Body Perfect Superwax Polish\n\nHaynes\n\nUnder Siege on video\n\nSky News Headlines\n\ntrail: Vietnam\n\nComfort\n\nAndrex\n\nSpecial K\n\nMaynards Justfruits\n\nTeenage Mutant Hero Turtles from Ideal\n\nSafeway\n\nBritish Airways\n\ntrail: White Men Can’t Jump\n\ntrail: Sightings\n\nLiptonice\n\nHellmann’s\n\nFiat Punto\n\nSurf Micro\n\nKit Kat\n\ntrail: Superbikes\n\ntrail: Highlander\n\nCenterparcs\n\nDiscovery Channel\n\nBounty\n\nDulux Natural Hints\n\nBold\n\nSky Text\n\ntrail: Blind Spot\n\nSpecial K\n\nRenault Laguna\n\ntrail: Football\n\ntrail: Knots Landing\n\ntrail: Dynasty\n\ntrail: Movies around Midnight\n\nSwinton\n\nMother’s Boys in cinemas\n\nLynx Mirage\n\nCarex\n\nGino Ginelli – Alistair McGowan\n\nHaynes\n\nPampers\n\nKill Your Speed\n\nAndrews Antacid\n\nNat West\n\nMars Dark & Light\n\nPG Tips\n\nGino Ginelli – Alistair McGowan\n\nAll Woman 3\n\nPanadol Ultra\n\nToilet Duck\n\nHaynes\n\ntrail: Doctor Who – Stones of Blood\n\ntrail: Movies around Midnight\n\ntrail: Miss Marple – Murder at the Vicarage\n\ntrail: Bergerac/The Bill\n\ntrail: Casualty\n\nDiet Coke\n\nKit Kat\n\nSun Valley\n\nAce Ventura Pet Detective in cinemas\n\nCrest\n\nDaz Ultra – Paul Ross Danny Baker\n\nKill Your Speed\n\nSwinton\n\nFirst on this tape, The Net, a sort of Micro Live for hipsters.\n\nBen Woolley looks at video on computers.

There’s a story about whether there’s really an epidemic of porn available to children on computers.\n\nThere’s a look at the use of computers in designing art galleries. Their ray tracing looks about as fast as Blender is on my computer. I thought things had improved.\n\nJules reviews Theme Park. I always think these segments are a middle aged man’s idea of what youth TV is like.\n\nThere’s a segment on different computer interfaces, including ‘Eager’ from Apple that looks like nothing less than an Apple precursor to Clippy.\n\nThere’s a coda to the programme, looking at an actual cybercafe in Soho, which features an appearance by Rolf Harris for no reason I can fathom, since he doesn’t say anything.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 15th June 1994 – 20:00\n\nThe last episode in this series sees Benjamin Woolley using AutoCAD to create ‘a virtual world’.\n\nTony Collins reports on the outsourcing of Inland Revenue data processing to a commercial company, EDS. The report opens with a piece of music that sounds weirdly familiar, then I realised, based on the jeep he’s driving, it’s probably supposed to be the Prisoner theme music, but they obviously couldn’t license it, so they’ve used a knock-off instead.\n\nAnd Bruce Sterling talks about the possibilities of wearable technology. There’s one part where he uses a white apron to demonstrate what wearable technology might enable in the future. It’s a masterpiece of bullshit which reminded me of Not The Nine O’Clock News doing paper folding.\n\n“And of course the ultimate computer application, Virtual Reality.”\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 23rd June 1994 – 20:30\n\nAfter this, recording switches, and there’s a trailer for GLR. There’s also a trailer for Paramedics.\n\nThen, at 7pm in the evening, Film 94 sees Barry Norman in Los Angeles looking forward to a Summer of movies. He looks at the following films:\n\nMaverick\n\nThe Flintstones\n\nWolf\n\nTom Hanks talks about Forrest Gump.\n\nTom Brook looks at the premiere of The Lion King.\n\nThere’s a man who built a motel and a Drive-In so you can watch the movie from your room.\n\nThere’s an interview with some producers, including Kathleen Kennedy, now in charge of Lucasfilm at Disney.\n\nTom Brook interviews Julia Roberts about I Love Trouble\n\nBarry interviews Kevin Costner and Lawrence Kasdan about Wyatt Earp.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 12th July 1994 – 19:00\n\nAfter this, recording switches to an episode of Amazing Stories. It’s Go to the Head of the Class, which I watched on another tape, and wasn’t very impressed with. My opinion hasn’t changed. It’s directed by Robert Zemeckis, so by rights it ought to be good, but the story is by Mick Garris, which might be where the problem lies.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 20th July 1994 – 23:05\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for The Terminator.\n\nThen, the rest of the tape has most of the film Harem with Nastassja Kinski and Ben Kingsley. The announcer describes it as a romantic movie. It’s called Harem. Nastassja Kinski and Ben Kingsley. How fucking romantic does that sound?\n\nI did not watch it.\n\nThe tape ends before the film ends.\n\nI talked about the bonkers finale of Brian De Palma’s Raising Cain in some detail a while ago. Here, finally, is the whole film. So what did I miss from the start?\n\nJohn Lithgow stars as Carter Nix. Always a good thing. He’s looking after his daughter in a playground, and talking to a family friend, who’s there with her son.\n\nOn the way home, he starts asking her if she’d bring her son to a Swedish clinic for child behaviour, to monitor gifted children. She poo-poos this suggestion, almost laughing at it, which makes Lithgow get a bit defensive, as child development is his field of study, and he starts sneezing. Then he sneezes dust into her face, and she has to stop the car because she’s got something in her eye.\n\nBut things immediately get creepier, as he then knocks her out with Chloroform, and almost gets noticed by two men jogging past, but he’s helped by the sudden appearance of Cain, his twin brother, at the car window, also played by Lithgow.\n\nLater, Cain takes the kidnapped boy to a motel, where his father is staying (also played by Lithgow – amazing value). It’s the father who runs the Swedish clinic Carter was talking about.\n\nCarter’s wife, Lolita Davidovich, meets a man she once had a brief affair with, Jack.\n\nThey agree to meet next day in the park, and find a hidden place to smooch, but she thinks she sees her husband Carter through the trees, something that she remembers in a dream later. It’s quite hard to tell what’s a dream and what’s actually happening in this film, which I think is deliberate.\n\nThen we find out how she and Jack met in the first place. She’s an oncologist, and he was with his wife, who was dying of cancer, and the two of them form a bond, tragically broken when they kiss and hug in the wife’s room, not noticing that she’s turned over and is looking at them. Jack notices by the reflection in the TV, then turns, and we get a set of jump cuts closer into the wife’s staring face. It’s textbook De Palma.\n\nThere’s more nightmares, as Davidovich is driving home, swerves to avoid some cyclists, only to run the car into a statue holding a long lance, which impales her. But this is only a dream.\n\nBut having wakened from the dream, She’s talking to Carter about the possibility of him going back to work, when he suddenly starts smothering her with a pillow. We get a flashback to the time she was smooching in the park, and see it from Carter’s point of view. His brother Cain appears, and tells him he’ll take care of it. He finds Jack’s coat, with his car keys, the proceeds to kidnap another child, kill its mother, stuff her body into Jack’s trunk, then put the keys back into Jack’s coat, which is the point at which Carter’s wife saw him.\n\nAfter this flashback, we cut back to Cain, having smothered Davidovich, he puts her in the back of a car, and rolls it into a nearby lake. He’s nervous when the car stops sinking, and the sun’s coming up, then, shockingly, Davidovich wakes up and starts bashing on the rear window trying to get out. But the car sinks and she’s gone.\n\nCarter, not knowing where his wife is, goes to the police, and gives them a description of Jack. An old retired cop sees him and recognises him from an old case involving his father. His father was buying babies, and they caught him with five babies. He skipped bail and fled to Sweden, but the cop called someone who knew Carter’s father, Dr Lynn Waldheim, played by the reliable Frances Sternhagen.\n\nWaldheim tells the police about Dr Nix’s book about multiple personalities, featuring a boy which they called Cain, who had split personalities based on childhood trauma. Waldheim believed that Dr Nix had created Cain’s multiple personalities himself by subjecting the young boy to trauma.\n\nAs they are talking to her, a car is found in the lake with a woman’s body inside, so Carter has to identify the body. Another great De Palma reveal, as the coroner shows them the woman’s nails saying she was trying to claw her way out. “You should see the expression on her face.”\n\nLater, in the park, having distributed the artist’s impression of Jack around the park, they find him sitting on a bench waiting for Davidovich. They get him to open his trunk, and there’s another dramatic reveal of another dead woman.\n\nCarter is waiting at home when his father calls, telling him to come to the hotel. He flips through the channels on the TV, and alights upon the channel that’s monitoring the camera in their daughter’s room, to see Davidovich’s face staring at him.\n\nShe overpowers him and threatens him with a scalpel. Cain talks to him over her shoulder, but when she looks there’s no one there, which is the first time the film explicitly acknowledges that Cain is Carter.\n\nSo now Carter/Cain is in custody, and Waldheim, who literally wrote the book on him when she worked with Dr Nix, interviews him, to try to find out where their daughter has been taken. But he headbutts her, steals her wig (she’s being treated for Cancer) and walks out of the station. Davidovich sees hir walking out, and follows them to the motel where Dr Nix has the kidnapped children.\n\nThis is where my precis in the climax started when I looked at it last year. It is just as bonkers as when I watched it with no context, but with the added surprise that the father, Dr Nix, turns out to be actually alive, and not just another figment of Carter’s psyche. Do go back and read the previous entry, I think it’s fun.\n\nAfter this, recording switches to BBC2. After yesterday’s first episode of Man on the Moon, I was rather upset when I checked my database and found that I hadn’t listed part two on any other tape, so I’d mentally resigned myself to having missed it. But I have not.\n\nNext on this tape is part two, which I had catalogued as One Small Step, which is what the overall season of documentaries was called. So now I can enjoy the story of the moon landings.\n\nRegular readers will not be surprised to hear that my eyes are getting slightly moist just from Neil Armstrong’s introduction, and the CAP-COM voice: “Tranquility base, here, the Eagle has landed”\n\nHere’s Ray Bradbury, at the time.\n\nBuzz Aldrin is interviewed.\n\nAstronaut Charlie Duke was Cap-Com at mission control.\n\nWhen the LEM lands safely, there’s footage from all over the world. But the only English voice is this old lady saying “I think it’s disgusting. It’s a pity they haven’t got something else to do. Not excited at all. Be better if they did something for the old’uns.” She’s so Brexit.\n\nYes, dear reader, I did cry when they landed. I probably always will, when watching Humanity’s greatest technological achievement. But one thing I did miss from this is BBC coverage of the moon landing, most of which was apparently junked sometime in the 70s. Here, there was some audio of James Burke, but no pictures from the coverage. They can send a man to the moon, but the BBC can’t pay a few pennies to preserve film and tape of history.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 30th June 1994 – 21:30\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for Monty Python’s Flying Circus, and one for The Late Show on Pedro Almodovar.\n\nThen, Newsnight which leads with the by-election in Monklands East constituency, vacant after the sudden, and shocking death of Labour leader John Smith.\n\nAlso in the news, the return of Yasser Arafat to his home in Gaza.\n\nAnd there’s a story on proposals to privatise the Post Office, something even John Major’s government eventually realised was a bad idea.\n\nThere’s a couple of young, familiar faces, like Alex Salmond\n\nAnd, talking about Post Office privatisation, Alan Johnson, then a Union rep.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 30th June 1994 – 22:30\n\nAfter this, a trailer for State of the Ark.\n\nThen, an episode of The Late Show with a profile of Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar.\n\nThey visit his mother.\n\nAlmodovar regular Antonio Banderas\n\nAnother regular was Carmen Maura\n\nThe Guardian’s Suzanne Moore\n\nJohn Waters talks about his films always getting an X rating in the US.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 30th June 1994 – 23:15\n\nAfter this, a trailer for Rudolph Cartier A Television Pioneer and Nineteen Eighty Four.\n\nThere’s Weather from Bill Giles.\n\nThen, the tape ends during the coverage of the Monklands East by election.\n\nNow here is a genuinely obscure film. Mike Jittlov was an animator, and he made a short film called The Wizard of Speed and Time for Disney which was a stop motion animation featuring Jittlov himself as the eponymous wizard. It gained him a certain fame, which enabled him to make a feature film with the same title.\n\nIt’s a strange film, the plot of which sees Jittlov playing basically himself, or a vaguely magical version of himself, trying to get a movie made.\n\nOne of his shorts, Time Tripper, features the time machine from George Pal’s The Time Machine.\n\nThe movie has a very negative view towards movie unions. Mike works mostly on his own, but the studios only hire union members. There’s a sequence where he goes round all the different unions, trying to find out how to join. But then, its view of hollywood producers is equally negative, so I guess this is all viewed from Jittlov’s position.\n\nThe producers are trying to make a show about special effects. These are the films they’re hoping to include.\n\nMike has a garage sale to raise money to make a short film to be included in the special effects show. Not sure these comics are priced accurately.\n\nThere’s some odd cameos here, presumably friends of Jittlov. Here’s animator Ward Kimball as an IRS auditor.\n\nPhilip Michael Thomas, familiar from Miami Vice, plays a policeman.\n\n90s internet thing Bob makes a couple of appearances.\n\nThere’s plenty of old-school celluloid editing porn here.\n\nThis is definitely an one-off. I think the comedy is just a bit too broad. The movie producers are all greedy and stupid, all the union people are stupid, the two thugs hired to try to derail his film are both really stupid, only Jittlov and his friends are the smart people. It’s certainly wish fulfillment.\n\nThe effects work is definitely of its time. His stop motion (with pixilation – using actors in the scene) is often impressive, and the amount of work involved must have been immense. It did make me think of similar effects used in The Goodies, usually to much funnier effect.\n\nI’ll link to someone else’s upload of the movie, so apologies if it stops working in the future.\n\nAfter this, recording switches to BBC2 and the end of Rab C Nesbitt.\n\nThere’s a trailer for next Tuesday on BBC2, with an Alien inspired BBC2 logo.\n\nThere’s also a trailer for Monty Python’s Flying Circus.\n\nThen, the first in a two part documentary about the moon landings, to coincide with the 25th anniversary. Rather unusually, Man on the Moon has an introduction from Neil Armstrong, a famously private man who never did a lot of publicity after he left the space programme, so it’s quite a coup to have his introduction here.\n\nI’m not sure I’ve every recounted my Neil Armstrong anecdote on this blog. I was flying to New York, on my way to Las Vegas for a technical conference. Early in the flight, there was a very long announcement from the cabin crew, the start of which I missed, but it seemed to be talking about ‘esteemed guests of United Airlines’ on the flight, and I mentally started checking out of the announcement, assuming it was company executives or something.\n\nBut then they got to the names of the guests, and I was interested again. Among a fairly large group of NASA pilots and test pilots, on board the aircraft were three Apollo astronauts. Neil Armstrong, Jim Lovell and Gene Cernan.\n\nI was way back in economy, and I didn’t have the guts to ask if I could meet them and shake their hands, and I reckoned gentlemen of their age would probably prefer to not be disturbed too often on the flight.\n\nThe flight was pretty rough, with enough turbulence that some people in other rows were being sick. I was OK, but it was definitely a bumpy flight.\n\nThen came the landing in New York. There were crosswinds of greater than 40 mph, and the pilot tried three times to land, each time pulling up sharply before he was able to land.\n\nThere was a lot more puking, and plenty of people were looking nervous, but I was fairly calm, because I knew that there was no way that God was crashing a plane containing three Apollo astronauts.\n\nIn the end, we were rerouted to Boston, then taken on a bus back to JFK, where I would have to wait almost a whole day before I could catch another connecting flight to Vegas, but I did meet one of the people travelling with Armstrong et al, who talked to me about the tour they’d been on.\n\nSo that’s how I flew with Neil Armstrong.\n\nThis is the first part of a two part documentary, starting with Sputnik, talking a lot about the function of the Space Race as propaganda, and at the start it’s all a bit disheartening for Americans, as prototype rockets just explode on the launch pad, and scientific experts talk seriously about sending up a potato into space.\n\nDonald Chaffee, father of Roger, talks heartbreakingly of learning that his son died in a fire on the launchpad in Apollo 1, along with Gus Grissom and Ed White.\n\nThis episode goes up to Apollo 8, which was the first Apollo mission to leave Earth Orbit and travel to the moon, although it was not intended to make a landing. There’s footage of the BBC coverage, including Cliff Michelmore.\n\nJames Burke\n\nPatrick Moore.\n\nEven Sir Bernard Lovell, director of the Jodrell Bank observatory\n\nIt’s nice to see Gene Kranz, one of the central figures in Apollo 13, my favourite movie. I love Apollo 13 so much that I even cry watching the behind the scenes documentary on the DVD. In particular, there’s a scene where Gene Kranz is talking about the moment they regained the signal to the command module as it reentered the atmosphere, not knowing if the heatshield was still intact, and so whether the craft would burn up during reentry. His voice breaks a little as he talks, and he brushes away a manly tear, a moment that Ed Harris captures in his performance, and it never fails to set me off.\n\nThe episode ends with the crew of Apollo 8 reading a passage from the bible, as their footage of Earthrise over the moon’s horizon plays, an astonishing image at the time, but perhaps one we’ve grown so used to seeing that its impact is diminished.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 28th June 1994 – 21:30\n\nAfter this, recording continues with a trailer for Heretic. And for Wimbledon Tennis.\n\nThen there’s a short programme looking at finalists for the BBC Design Awards, presented by Muriel Gray.\n\nThe finalists in this programme are a Basic Thermos Flask\n\nA Flashcard Torch\n\nA chair\n\nA motorcycle\n\nand a wetsuit.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 28th June 1994 – 22:20\n\nThere’s a trailer for State of the Ark. Then an episode of Video Nation featuring Teresa Carden, a school supervisor from Liverpool.\n\nThen, a whole episode of Newsnight, featuring Hospital league tables, and a profile of John Prescott.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 28th June 1994 – 22:30\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for Room 101, and for Monty Python’s Flying Circus.\n\nThen, the tape runs out during Face to Face in which Jeremy Isaacs interviews Jeanette Winterson, then a hot writer following the success of the TV adaptation of Oranges are Not the Only Fruit. There’s about 35 minutes of this interview, which is very interesting.\n\nAdverts:\n\nCraftmatic Adjustable Bed\n\nHoover\n\nMars\n\ntrail: Chaplin"
