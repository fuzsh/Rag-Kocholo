        "text": "In 2010, Rebecca Front won a Bafta for her performance as inept government minister Nicola Murray in Armando Iannucci’s acclaimed political comedy, The Thick of It. The series depicted politics as a relentless farce presided over by a confederacy of dunces. So… would now be a good time to revive the series, perhaps? “No,” says Front. “At the moment, we wouldn’t be able to make a comedy about politics because politics is just not funny. It’s gone beyond that.”\n\nIn what ways? “Don’t get me started,” exclaims the 56-year-old. “We’re going through the most extraordinary times, but unfortunately I have lost my sense of humour about it because the stakes are so high. This is a time of absolute international emergency, and our politics just looks like a clown car.\n\n“There was a time when we thought: ‘Politics is hilarious.’ But not now, not when thousands of people are dying, and we have no understanding about what the rules are. I’ve turned into one of those people who just walks around the house furious all the time.”\n\nThe Thick of It changed everything for Front. She had always been a highly accomplished actor but, as she puts it, the series “shifted things up a gear for me”. She went on to star in Simon Amstell’s comedy Grandma’s House, as well as Poldark and the BBC’s 2016 adaptation of War & Peace. She jokes that she would like to be the next James Bond.\n\nFirst, though, Front is starring in new BBC One comedy The Other One, written by Pippa Brown and Holly Walsh (part of the writing team behind Motherland). She plays Tess, whose husband Colin drops dead at a surprise birthday party she and her daughter Catherine (Ellie White) have thrown for him. Tess then discovers that Colin had been leading a double life with another partner, Marilyn (Siobhan Finneran), and another daughter (Lauren Socha), with the same name as her own daughter.\n\n“The most notable thing about The Other One – and it shouldn’t be the most notable thing about it, but at this point, it still is – is that it is very much female-centric,” says Front. “That doesn’t make it unique because there are other [examples] around, but there aren’t as many as there should be.”\n\nFront was also drawn to Tess, who she describes as “quite a complicated woman. Two horrible things have happened to her, and I have a huge amount of sympathy for that.” A patron of the charity Anxiety UK, Front has talked openly in the past about suffering from panic attacks and claustrophobia. She believes that lockdown will have exacerbated anxiety for many people. “It’s so common in normal life for people to have anxiety disorders,” she says. “But in a situation like this, with an invisible, unknowable, deadly enemy out there, everybody feels anxious.\n\n“Many people will be experiencing it for the first time, but people like me who have been aware of their anxieties for decades are in a good position to go, ‘Don’t worry. I have felt that, too. It feels horrible now, but I know from personal experience that you’ll be fine and get through it. How can I help you?’\n\n“You have a duty to use your profile in any way you can,” continues Front. “As an example, I’ve written quite a lot about having school phobia. When I was seven, I stopped going to school. I’ve had so many comments from people saying: ‘My child is going through it, and I had no other examples I could give them. But I was able to say: ‘Do you remember that woman from the Horrid Henry film? She was phobic, too.’”\n\nFront seems to have a knack of finding projects that cut through and have an impact beyond the screen. She recalls being invited to political functions after The Thick of It. “People thought: ‘She must know about politics’ and I was forced to point out that even Nicola didn’t know about politics,” says Front, laughing. “Four or five female politicians said to me that they thought Nicola was based on them. But she was not based on anyone. If anything, she was based on me, had I gone into politics. Hopefully, I wouldn’t have been that venal, but I would have been about as effective as Nicola.”\n\nThe Thick of It is one of many lauded collaborations Front has had with Iannucci, including On the Hour, The Day Today and Knowing Me, Knowing You… with Alan Partridge. Front, who was a contemporary of Iannucci’s at Oxford, thinks their relationship has proved fruitful because “we have a very similar sense of humour, and we have a shorthand. He doesn’t have to say a huge amount for me to get what he is talking about. He likes to be surrounded by people who are easy company and not diva-ish.”\n\nFront, who is married to TV producer Phil Clymer, recently teamed up with Iannucci again on Avenue 5, a typically sharp comedy set on a space station and starring Hugh Laurie as the increasingly panicky Captain Ryan Clark. “All I heard from Armando was: ‘I am doing a new comedy. It is set in space. Do you want to come and play?’” says Front. “I just said: ‘Yes, please.’”\n\nShe plays Karen, an admirably dogged passenger with a rare talent for lodging complaints, with an impeccable American accent. However, with typical modesty, she discloses that before filming began she told her American colleagues in the cast: “Please, please promise to let me know if anything I say sounds like I come from Essex.”\n\nShe continues: “There was a rather sweet moment at the American press launch. It was a very hot day in Pasadena, and at one point Hugh and I were sitting having a chat outside the conference centre. An American journalist was nearby having a cigarette. She came over to us and said: ‘Can I just say that hearing you both speak has blown my mind because I thought you were both American?’ That was very gratifying.”\n\nNot that she’s letting any of this go to her head. “Fame is such an odd concept,” she says. “You can be famous one moment, and five minutes later, you’re not. If you’re in this business to get famous, you’re going to be bitterly disappointed.\n\n“I don’t find it helpful to think of myself as famous, as most of the time when I’m walking down the street, nobody is thinking: ‘Why is that famous person walking around with a ninja mask on?’” Front pauses at this point, slightly crestfallen. “Oh no, my secret is out,” she adds. “I was wearing a mask long before everyone else was.”"
