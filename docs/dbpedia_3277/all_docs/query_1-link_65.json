        "text": "A bit of Saturday Night entertainment from 1995 today. This tape opens with this disconcerting sight.\n\nIt’s Steve Wright on his Steve Wright’s People Show. They were cutting edge on this show, they were even on the Internet.\n\nNote that the BBC was already using @bbc.co.uk for email, but had still to launch a website on the BBC Networking Club URL. According to the wayback machine, this is the earliest homepage on http://www.bbc.co.uk. It’s from December 1996.\n\nThe show closes with music from EMF and Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer doing ‘I’m a Believer’\n\nDuring the titles they show clips from the show, which also included D:Ream. Now, I don’t want to sound like a Brian Cox Denier, but I keep seeing bits and pieces of D:Ream on various programmes, and I don’t think I’ve seen the Professor on keyboards once. Did he only play on the record, and not do public appearances? Either that or in this show he’s wearing a frizzy blond wig.\n\nAfter this, there’s a lovely advert for Simon Mayo’s morning show.\n\nThere’s a trailer for programmes on Sunday.\n\nThen, The New Adventures of Superman and an episode called Target: Jimmy Olsen. Was it common to have files in a filing cabinet arranged from side to side instead of front to back? Or was this set up this way just to get the right angle for the shot?\n\nThey’re looking for information about the Valhalla project, one subject of which was Jimmy Olsen.\n\nGod preserve us from musclebound heavies with unfeasibly long, perfectly coiffed hair. They were all over 90s TV like a rash.\n\nTalking of rashes (I swear I wrote that line before this) Jimmy has a strange rash that reappears every year. And his doctor has been murdered. They find another of his patients, a woman born on the same army base as Jimmy, at the same time. Who also has a strange rash.\n\nCharles Napier turns up in a small role.\n\nProject Valhalla was an attempt to create programmed assassins, and Jimmy is one of the subjects, as is the young psychology student they met, who is now staying with Lois and psychoanalyzing her for fun.\n\nThings take a surprisingly dark turn when the third subject of the experiment turns up with a high power rifle, shooting at the windows of the Daily Planet and at any police cars that approached him. This show is so fluffy and lightweight that this feels strangely out of place.\n\nI’m not convinced that having the subjects activated by such a common word as ‘warrior’ is a good idea. As we discover when Jimmy is almost accidentally triggered by Perry.\n\nThis episode actually has some genuine jeopardy, despite being hampered by dull villain characters. The fact that it’s Jimmy being used as an assassin adds an extra edge.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 1st July 1995 – 19:10\n\nAfter this there’s a trailer for Ruby’s Health Quest. And a trailer for Barnardo’s Children.\n\nThen there’s the start of the National Lottery Live. I never used to watch this, so I’ve missed that they used the spots on the side of the TVC wall as lottery balls. I’m a sucker for TVC appearing in TV shows.\n\nAfter a bit of this, recording switches to BBC2 later in the evening, catching the end of Rock Family Trees.\n\nThere’s a trailer for Live Aid 10th Anniversary. And for It’s Marty Resurrected: Some of the Best of Marty Feldman.\n\nThen, The Saturday Night Armistice. Hugh Grant is in the news, so David Schneider is wearing “That Jacket”.\n\nMr Tony Blair went to Eurodisney.\n\nRebecca Front plays ‘Period Drama Woman’ on her day off.\n\nRelate have a video game called Custody Warrior\n\nHunt The Old Woman starts.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 1st July 1995 – 21:50\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for the Friday Night Comedy Zone, and for the John Wayne movie Rio Lobo.\n\nThen, an episode of Seinfeld, The Pez Dispenser.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 1st July 1995 – 22:25\n\nAfter this, recording switches, to the end of Pets Win Prizes. Good Grief.\n\nThere’s a trailer for Eureka and for 2Point4 Children.\n\nThen, The New Adventures of Superman. In Individual Responsibilities Bruce Campbell plays the boss of Intergang, who has discovered some Red Kryptonite.\n\nThe Red Kryptonite makes Superman not care about saving people, so Lois sends him to a therapist, played by Barbara Bosson.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 8th July 1995 – 18:30\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for Sunday Night Programmes. And one for How Do They Do That?\n\nThen, the start of The Steve Wright People Show. It features Edwyn Collins, the second time we’ve seen him in recent tapes.\n\nAfter a few minutes of this, including Joan Rivers, recording switches to BBC2 and quite a bit of the end of Rock Family Trees about Deep Purple.\n\nThe reason there’s so much of Rock Family Trees is that programmes are running later than billed, due to Wimbledon coverage overrunning. Here’s the revised schedule.\n\nThere’s a trailer for Thursday Night programmes.\n\nThen, another Saturday Night Armistice. The Jeremy Hanley Fan Club weren’t happy with his expulsion from the cabinet.\n\nBen Moor plays a tennis umpire explaining how he umps with a set of index cards.\n\nMr Tony Blair went to Moscow\n\nPeter Baynham steals an usherette’s uniform to get into a west end show at the urging of a critic.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 8th July 1995 – 21:50\n\nAfter this there’s a trailer for the Friday Night Comedy Zone.\n\nThen, the tape ends with the start of Today At Wimbledon featuring the women’s final between Steffi Graf and Arantxa Sánchez Vicario.\n\nContinuing our trip to Moonbase Alpha, still my favourite location in TV SF, we reach the first episode of season 2.\n\nThe show was somewhat reconfigured for its second season. Gone was Barry Morse’s Victor Bergman (I don’t think this was ever explained). New was Tony Anholt as Tony Verdeschi, security chief. The costumes were reconfigured, with the fairly dull jumpsuits being mostly covered with slightly cooler looking jackets. Main Mission was changed to Command Center, with a much smaller set, presumably for cost reasons.\n\nOne thing that hasn’t changed is the show’s weird habit of having women on the crew suddenly faint when something shocking happens. Sandra Benes has done it in previous episodes, and in this episode a guest actor faints when an eagle piloted by (we presume) her partner is dragged back to the planet they were surveying by a blob of green light. Just faints.\n\nIs fainting still a thing? I mean fainting due to shock. I’ve only seen a person faint once, and that was a young man, after a group of us had just given blood. So there was, at least, a physiological reason for it.\n\nThe people in Main Mission the Command Centre are supposed to be trained professionals, and yet they’re fainting at the first shocking thing that happens. It feels so 19th Century.\n\nBefore the fainting, there’s some nice miniature volcanoes on the planet.\n\nThe planet is Psychon, and Moonbase is contacted by Mentor, another guest role for the incomparable Brian Blessed.\n\nMentor’s Daughter is new cast member Maya, played by Catherine Schell. She thinks Mentor is working to restore their planet, and wants to cooperate with the Alphans.\n\nBut when the Eagle containing Koening, Russell and Carter is taken to the planet, they find a lot of aliens working like zombies in a mine. and the other captured Eagle pilots are suffering in a machine.\n\nMento’s psychic computer, Psyche, needs the energy of living minds, and he wants everyone on Moonbase to be fuel for its work. Dr Russell gets a taste of what that’s like.\n\nKoenig persuades Maya that her father is evil, the planet goes up in a conflagration, and Maya joins the crew.\n\nNext, UFO and an episode that misses out the Century 21 ident at the start. Don’t know if that’s Bravo presentation or whether the episode was like this.\n\nStraker has an interview with a reporter, and because she’s a lady reporter he’s all charm and flirt. She has a recorder in her bag, and forgets to take it when she leaves, so goes back to collect it.\n\nThere’s a very cheeky fake-out to make us think Straker is is danger from assassins, when it’s just a movie being shot on the studio set. A bit of cheap drama.\n\nStraker realises that the reporter’s recorder picked up an intercom call for ‘Commander Straker’ on her handbag recorder. And they can’t track her down. Straker finds her, offers to cook her dinner, then finds out she was a bad’un and berates her for her life choices.\n\nIn the B-Story, Alec is in charge of Shado when there’s a rogue moon vehicle heading towards moonbase. The episode is called Seat of Responsibility.\n\nAfter this, there’s a but of the start of The Protectors, then recording switches, and we’re back with Moonbase Alpha in an episode called The Exiles. The Alphans come across a number of small missiles. They’ve got people in them, and they thaw out Peter Duncan (who’s being dubbed by someone else here).\n\nAlso Stacy Dorning\n\nNaturally, they’re evil, and want to take over their home planet, after 300 years.\n\nThe next episode is One Moment of Humanity, guest-starring Billie Whitelaw.\n\nAnd Geoffrey Bayldon\n\nWhitelaw is an android whose people want to learn about anger. Bayldon is one of the humans left on their planet. Tony and Helena have been captured in order to be monitored and put under stress.\n\nThey decide, after reading Othello, they have to make Koenig murderously angry, and to do that, the male android will have to ‘make love’ to Helena. Which appears to take the form of a very slow interpretive dance.\n\nI guess Helena isn’t just allowed to tell him to fuck off because that would be too much negative emotion. But even so this is all really stupid. Why would it be jealousy? Helena doesn’t want to do it, so it’s just assault. But that’s not how the show is playing it. They’re showing Koenig having trouble controlling his jealousy. I don’t know, maybe Helena’s under their control or something. It’s such bullshit.\n\nBut the androids are hoist by their own petard, as the man who was dirty dancing with Helena gets enough emotion that he genuinely falls in love with her, which causes Billie Whitelaw to go mad with jealousy, and short circuit the controlling computer.\n\nAfter this, there’s the start of an episode of Wild Palms. We haven’t seen any of that yet in this blog, but I think I have some of it on tape. The tape ends shortly after it starts.\n\nAdverts:\n\nFlash\n\nRennie\n\nDiscovery Channel\n\ntrail: Tough Guys\n\ntrail: Class of Nuke Em High\n\nKronenbourg 1664\n\nObsession\n\nPulsar\n\nRummikub\n\nDiet Coke\n\nBoots\n\ntrail: Troma\n\nSci Fi Channel\n\nCoca Cola\n\nBird’s Eye Panflair\n\nPanasonic\n\nBendicks\n\nSci Fi Channel\n\ntrail: Wild Palms\n\nBravo Website\n\nFamily Channel\n\ntrail: The Prisoner\n\nGossard Ultra Bra\n\nHeineken Export\n\nRummikub\n\nPanasonic\n\nSekonda\n\nBatman Forever on video\n\nUncle Ben’s\n\nPaxo\n\nSanatogen\n\nPremium Search\n\ntrail: Class of Nuke Em High\n\nSci Fi Channel\n\nBrut Aquatonic\n\nBeecham’s All In One\n\nBold\n\nHorlicks\n\nPPP Healthcare\n\nSci Fi Channel\n\ntrail: The Punisher\n\ntrail: Troma\n\nOld Spice\n\nPedigree Chum\n\nTV Licensing\n\nFlash\n\nBold\n\nFamily Channel\n\nBravo Website\n\ntrail: Mods & Rockers\n\ntrail: The Critic\n\nPaxo\n\nCornhill Direct\n\nTeletext\n\nFamily Channel\n\ntrail: Class of Nuke Em High\n\nPaxo\n\nBatman Forever on video\n\nHorlicks\n\nFairy Liquid\n\nNurofen Cold & Flu\n\nOil of Ulay\n\ntrail: Class of Nuke Em High\n\ntrail: Six Million Dollar Man\n\nDebenhams\n\nNow 32\n\nLorus\n\nRadio Rentals\n\nSomerfield\n\nDebenhams\n\ntrail: Swamp Thing\n\ntrail: The Prisoner\n\nTeletext\n\nBravo Website\n\ntrail: The Organisation\n\nHeineken Export\n\nLevis\n\nSekonda\n\nBisto Best\n\nAmerican Express\n\ntrail: Chopper Chicks in Zombietown\n\nDuracell\n\nGossard Ultra Bra\n\nPaxo\n\nBendicks\n\nCampbell’s Soup\n\nNurofen Cold & Flu\n\nIBM\n\nUncle Ben’s\n\nRemington Steam Setter\n\ntrail: The Critic\n\ntrail: The Organisation\n\nPaxo\n\nTampax\n\nRemington Triple Foil\n\nColman’s of Norwich\n\nFairy Liquid\n\nDiscovery Channel\n\ntrail: The Critic\n\nI’m going to cheat a bit for this tape. The first episode here is Star Trek Deep Space Nine and the episode Past Tense part 2. But rather than be lost as to what’s happening, in preparation I’m also watching part 1.\n\nSisko, Bashir and Dax have been transported to San Francisco in the past – 2020 – at a time of great civil unrest. Dax ends up with the rich population, Sisko and Bashir with the undocumented poor. And to make matters worse, one of the key people during the riots, a man called Gabriel Bell, who ensured the safety of hostages, and whose actions led to major societal changes and, eventually, to Starfleet, is killed. So it’s up to Sisko to assume his identity and make sure history proceeds correctly.\n\nThere’s only one wrinkle. According to history Gabriel Bell didn’t survive the riots.\n\nThe leader of the rioters looks like, in another life, he’d be whining on the internet about political correctness, free speech and how white men are the most oppressed minority.\n\nIt’s mostly the hat, I have to admit.\n\nAmong the hostages is security guard Dick Miller.\n\nSisko speaks for all of us when he tells fedora douchebag “You get on my nerves, and I don’t like your hat.”\n\nMeanwhile, O’Brien and Kira keep transporting through time to different eras.\n\nClint Howard pops up randomly, for no real reason.\n\nAs you probably guessed, Sisko manages to get out of the situation with history intact, and without dying. There’s a chin stroking moralistic coda at the end where Bashir asks Sisko how things got so bad in the first place. Sisko has no answer. I fear we might know better now.\n\nAfter this, recording continues for a bit, with the start of an episode of Renegade, the cop show that seems to be sponsored by Vidal Sassoon.\n\nAfter a bit of this, recording switches to UK Gold and the end of an episode of the Trevor Eve adultery-fest A Sense of Guilt.\n\nThen, an episode of A Very Peculiar Practice. This is episode 7: Death of a University which sounds a bit final.\n\nDoctor Daker (Peter Davison) is having rather Bergman-inflected dreams, which include the ubiquitous nuns.\n\nThe American owners of the University want to slash student numbers, raise fees and student rents. Bob Buzzard (David Troughton) seems to be splitting his time between medicine and selling arms to South American dictators. Rose Marie (Barbara Flynn) is still in love with Grete (Joanna Kanska) but she’s going out with Daker.\n\nAnd you can tell this is a final episode, because there’s a returning character – Lyn Turtle (Amanda Hillwood) – who is now a Chief Inspector of Police.\n\nI’m not quite sure about the symbolism of Rose Marie becoming a third Nun at the end.\n\nIt’s a bit of a downbeat ending, with the University descending into chaos, and Daker and Grete moving to Poland. But at least that set up the one-off sequel later.\n\nAfter this, recording switches to the end of an episode of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.\n\nThere’s a trailer for Live Aid 10th Anniversary.\n\nThen, the last episode in the series of The Net. “The Net enters the real world of virtual reality”. Isn’t that every week on The Net?\n\nIt opens with a report from the Independent’s Martin Jacques on the ramifications of the internet on the real world.\n\nProfessor Stuart Hall (no, not that one) talks about a new conception of community enabled by the internet.\n\nHere’s an example of the kind of community that existed. PaddyNet. For “Irish-themed” information. PaddyNet.\n\nNext, a look at virtual online worlds. Kevin Kelly of Wired is talking about people in virtual worlds ‘acting as gods themselves’.\n\nBen Woolley looks at virtual reality, and VRML, although he’s mostly talking about rendered, navigable 3D environments. This was a time before graphics cards allowed decent speed 3D rendering.\n\nThen, the final item is a little treat for me, with Ian McNaught-Davis from Micro Live. Not very long, but nice to see him.\n\nHere’s the full programme.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 10th July 1995 – 19:30\n\nAfter this, there’s an adjudication by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.\n\nRecording switches to the end of Top Gear, with someone doing doughnuts on a motorcycle, and Quentin Willson rhapsodizing over a Ferrari.\n\nThere’s a trailer for Shopping.\n\nThen, an episode of The Outer Limits. In The Voyage Home three astronauts are surveying Mars, find a mysterious pod hours before they’re lifting off, which opens and does some flashy lightshow, and they’re knocked unconscious for a time. Then they return to their ship and begin the voyage home.\n\nIt co-stars Michael Dorn off of Star Trek the Next Generation.\n\nSomething slimy has got on board, and of course it’s able to infect a crewmember and turn him into something with the ability to morph into a green alien.\n\nSo far, so Alien/Thing. But then, the alien (in Michael Dorn’s form) and the remaining human have to work together to get back to Earth.\n\nBut in the end the remaining human decides to abort the landing and depressurise the ship – check out the great effects.\n\nBBC Genome:BBC Two – 10th July 1995 – 21:00\n\nFollowing this there’s a trailer for Thursday Night on BBC2.\n\nThere’s also a trailer for The Travel Show.\n\nThen the start of Shopping.\n\nThen, recording switches to Carlton (boo) and after my dismay at it being the biggest film at the UK box office in 1995, by collection decides to serve up the making of Batman Forever. Lovely.\n\nIt’s presented by Chris O’Donnell. Did his career ever recover from this and Batman and Robin?\n\nThe crew interviews are all shot with that weird lighting setup where there’s a focused key light just hitting their eyes – it’s the sort of setup that they used to use to photograph the beautiful women in Star Trek, and it looks plain weird in this setting. Weirdly, Val Kilmer just has a simple, even lighting setup. Here’s John Dykstra, for example.\n\nBatman ‘creator’ Bob Kane is interviewed. It’s interesting that he’s managed to keep quite good hold of the ‘creator’ title for Batman, despite much of the creative work being done by writer Bill Finger. In this programme, he even talks about how he created the Riddler, a character that was created by Bill Finger and artist Dick Sprang.\n\nThis is such a terrible programme. Every time they introduce one of the stars, we’re given some static pages of text listing their movies. Tommy Lee Jones gets four of them It seems really odd for this kind of programme.\n\nAnyway, the tape runs out just before the programme finishes, so I don’t get to complain any more.\n\nAdverts:\n\ntrail: Sky No Turning Back\n\ntrail: The X Files\n\nTy-phoo\n\nRaid\n\nCesar\n\nUncle Ben’s\n\nAnchor Spray Cream\n\nCapri-Sun\n\ntrail: Carlito’s Way\n\ntrail: Highlander/The Untouchables\n\nHellmann’s\n\nJudge Dredd in cinemas\n\nUK Gold\n\nJif\n\ntrail: Fire\n\ntrail: The Shining\n\ntrail: Law & Order\n\nPersil\n\nSure\n\nHuggies\n\nTetley\n\nFlash\n\ntrail: Sky Sports\n\ntrail: Another Stakeout\n\nIntertext\n\nNescafe\n\nTesco\n\nPost Office\n\nImpulse\n\ntrail: Tomorrow on Sky\n\ntrail: Reilly Ace of Spies\n\ntrail: Tuesday on UK Gold\n\nSony Handycam\n\nAA\n\nBoots\n\nPost Office\n\nWash & Go\n\nFairy\n\nFiat Punto\n\nNational Lottery\n\nNeutralia\n\nAlways\n\nLenor Plus\n\nDomestos\n\nRennie\n\nArgos\n\nCorn Flakes – Katy Carmichael\n\nPeperami\n\nHeinz Tomato Ketchup\n\nPeugeot 106\n\nNational Lottery Instants\n\nLilt\n\nPost Office\n\nRight Guard\n\nVision Express\n\nMcDonalds – Batman Forever\n\nGuardian Direct\n\nAlka-Seltzer\n\ntrail: Dilly Downtown – featuring a glimpse of a young Sanjeev Bhaskar\n\nRover\n\nFuji Super G\n\nFruit & Fibre\n\nAndrex\n\nCadbury’s Caramel\n\nTetley\n\nOrbit/Extra\n\nHeinz Salad Cream\n\nOrange\n\ntrail: A Night on the Town (Adventures in Babysitting)\n\nToday we have a tape packed with comedy, and also another of the seemingly endless supply of tapes recorded around Christmas 1995. There appears to be no end to them.\n\nFirst, there’s the end of Secret Nature, and a trailer for Screen Two: Saigon Baby, a drama about illegal overseas adoption, featuring the much missed John Hurt. There’s a trailer for Easy Rider and a making-of documentary, Born to be Wild.\n\nThen, another compilation of Not The Nine O’Clock News, which opens with posh people falling off horses.\n\nThere’s ‘Constable Savage’\n\n(Rowan Atkinson predicting his future performance as Inspector Fowler in The Thin Blue Line)\n\nHere’s Doctor Who stuntman Stuart Fell about to fall out of a door.\n\nA musical interlude – “I can’t believe Ronald Reagan is president”. Simpler times.\n\n“The Devil: Is He All Bad?”\n\nAnother classic – the judge who doesn’t know about anything modern. “A digital watch? What on earth is a digital watch?”\n\nAnd the show closes with the final song in the series, “Kinda Lingers”\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 15th December 1995 – 21:00\n\nA Christmas trailer follows.\n\nThen, another Day Today Mini episode, including a classic bit of Peter O’Hanraha-hanrahan. “Ich… Nichten… Lichten”\n\nThere’s a trailer for Jools Holland’s New Year show.\n\nThen, Coogan’s Run and Natural Born Quizzers. Coogan and Patrick Marber are brothers on the run, having kidnapped their therapist. There’s a good cast, including Rebecca Front as a policewoman\n\nHer detective colleague is Jim Carter\n\nShe has a past with the two homicidal quizzers, as she and her sister competed against them on Top of the Class\n\nCompere of the show is Duncan Preston\n\nWhen the boys catch up with him, she’s changed a bit.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 15th December 1995 – 21:30\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for Faust, Animal Farm, and Gary Larson’s Tales of the Far Side.\n\nThen, Have I Got News For You featuring guests Lee Hurst\n\nAnd Mark Little\n\nI wonder which one was the last minute replacement for the billed Clare Rayner.\n\nAmusingly, they crack exactly the same joke as in Not The Nine O’Clock News – how dogs resemble their owners. Different footage, though.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 15th December 1995 – 22:00\n\nAfter this, recording switches to a little later in the month, and the Shooting Stars festive special. They’ve spent a bit of money on sets and costumes, and Ulrika gets to dance.\n\nAs does Mark Lamarr\n\nGuests are Clive Mantle\n\nAlvin Stardust\n\nAnna Friel\n\nand Neil Morrissey\n\nAmusingly, after yesterday’s tape, they do a parody of the Alien Autopsy.\n\nThere’s even a musical guest, Edwyn Collins\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 29th December 1995 – 21:00\n\nThere’s a trailer for the great Robert Altman movie The Player.\n\nThen, Knowing Me Knowing Yule with Alan Partridge. A Christmas special for Steve Coogan’s chat show host. I’ve seen it several times, but it still makes me laugh an awful lot.\n\nRebecca Front plays a bellringer who is worried about the amount of sex and violence on TV.\n\nThe Actor Kevin Eldon plays celebrity chef Fanny Thomas\n\nThe lovely David Schneider plays Alan’s new boss Tony Hayers, whom he begs for a second series of his chat show.\n\nDoon MacKichan and Patrick Marber are a golfing couple with a tragic back story.\n\nTo close the show, Mick Hucknall sings Ding Dong Merrily on High.\n\nWhilst I’ve quite enjoyed the episodes of Coogan’s Run I’ve seen, I have to say that he’s never better than when playing Alan Partridge. And the material is good enough to support the performance, some really good writing and production.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 29th December 1995 – 21:40\n\nNext, recording switches, and we’ve got a nice surprise, with a programme that’s not on my database. It’s Films of the Year with Barry Norman giving his rundown of the best films of the year. I’ll see if I can list them – it’s sometimes hard to spot which ones he’s nominating.\n\nShallow Grave\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption\n\nThe Madness of King George\n\nBullets over Broadway\n\nThe Usual Suspects\n\nBraveheart\n\nApollo 13\n\nLand and Freedom\n\nShanghai Triad\n\nBabe\n\nAs well as the films of the year, there’s a rundown of the top ten films at the UK box office. Unbelievably, the top two films were Batman Forever and Casper. This was in the year that Apollo 13 and The Shawshank Redemption were out. Shawshank didn’t even grace the top 10. Batman Forever. This was an omen for Brexit.\n\nNever mind, here’s Pierce Brosnan and Joe Don Baker to cheer you up.\n\nIn the movie news, there was the plan to turn the Leavesden studios, where Goldeneye was shot, into a Studio Tour, something that eventually happened many years later with the Harry Potter Studio Tour.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 29th December 1995 – 23:30\n\nThere’s a trailer for Rolling Stones: Voodoo Lounge.\n\nThen, the start of Little Big Man starring Dustin Hoffman. Here he is before he went into make up.\n\nThe tape ends just as the film starts.\n\nHere’s part of a themed evening from Channel 4, with special themed idents.\n\nIt starts with Secret History: The Roswell Incident. It’s the usual parade of people saying they saw something they couldn’t explain, the military saying it was a weather balloon, and cries of a cover up.\n\nThe most interesting part is the quite recent appearance of the famous Alien Autopsy ‘film’. Here’s Ray Santilli, who came into possession of the ‘film’ and would later be portrayed on film by Ant or Dec. (Declan Donnelly to be precise).\n\nThe programme talks to some experts on the likely veracity of the film. A forensic pathologist is 98% certain it’s a man-made hoax. More sure is special effects expert Bob Keen, who is certain it’s a special effect, and he thinks it could have been produced probably no earlier than the 1960s.\n\nIt’s interesting to compare this programme with the American production about the Alien Autopsy film. In that, as I recall, they talked to Stan Winston, who was far more open to the possibility it was real.\n\nSantilli has since admitted the footage was fake – but he claims it’s a ‘reconstruction’ of footage he genuinely saw, but which had deteriorated in the time between his first seeing it and him purchasing it. That’s the basic plot of Ant & Dec’s movie, too.\n\nThere’s no credit, but the narrator on this programme sounds like Geoffrey McGivern.\n\nAfter this, there’s a strange announcer – Venusian Vince – to introduce a clip that originated on the Sci Fi channel, some future news.\n\nOh look, Kellyanne Conway is still working.\n\nNext, it’s Soylent Green. A movie whose major plot twist is probably the best know twist in movie history. I guarantee you that most of the people you know what Soylent Green is, but almost none of them will have seen the film. Even I haven’t seen the film before, and I’ve watched loads of old SF movies. I’m not sure why I didn’t watch this at the time, but in my defense, I got engaged that year, so I was spending a bit less time watching TV.\n\nThe film is based on Harry Harrison’s novel Make Room! Make Room! massive overpopulation was a big theme in 50s and 60s SF, and Harrison himself wrote several stories on the subject, including one of my favourites, A Criminal Act, which would make a brilliant short film.\n\nBut onto the film at hand. It’s set in New York City in 2022, where the city’s population is 40m people.\n\n“This interview is brought to you by new Soylent Green, high energy plankton gathered from the oceans of the world.”\n\nCharlton Heston and his roommate Edward G Robinson are complaining about the food. “How can anything grow now. The greenhouse effect. Everything is burning up.” I always think of the greenhouse effect as a fairly new theory, from the 80s, but it’s been around much longer than that.\n\nSomeone’s playing what looks like a version of Asteroids – this is 1973, well before the Atari Asteroids was released in 1979.\n\nHeston is a policeman, investigating a murder of someone who was working high-up in the Soylent corporation, the maker of the dull, flavourless protein powder which is the only thing most people can afford to eat.\n\nI’m not enjoying the sour misogyny the film displays. The murdered man had a woman as his companion, but she ‘came with he apartment’ – and we see her friends in a later scene, presumably all similarly employed. I didn’t see any male companions.\n\nNaturally she falls in love with Heston, presumably partly because he doesn’t treat her like shit.\n\nSomething about the murder case is odd. Heston is being tailed, and then told that the case is closed. When he won’t drop it, someone tries to kill him during a food riot.\n\nWhit Bissell plays a local politician who’s mixed up in the whole thing.\n\nCelia Lovsky, T’Pau from Star Trek, pops up in a cameo.\n\nHeston’s friend Sol (Robinson) finds out more about the conspiracy, but then decides to be euthanised. Part of the euthanasia procedure is to watch a big screen film of beautiful countryside, meadows, deer frolicking, all scored with Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony. This was a popular image in 70s movies – The Parallax View and A Clockwork Orange all used a similar idea (and Clockwork Orange also used Beethoven).\n\nHeston talks to Robinson as he’s watching the film, and is told to find proof of what’s happening. Also, Heston has never seen what the world looked like before environmental collapse. I guess their TV doesn’t have much TV from the 70s or before. Maybe it all got wiped when the earth’s magnetic pole flipped polarity.\n\nHeston follows what happens to all the dead bodies from the euthanasia centre, and finds that they are taken to a factory, and processed into (surprise!) Soylent Green. “Soylent Green is people!” yells Heston as he’s being taken away.\n\nAfter this, there’s another strange FTL news feed (see below for a compilation).\n\nThen, a strange programme called Mothership Connection, touching on a lot of black artists and performers, with a Sci-Fi bent, including George Clinton\n\nSun Ra\n\nLee “Scratch” Perry\n\nGoldie (the musician not the Blue Peter dog)\n\nNichelle Nichols talks about her work in encouraging people of colour to work in places like NASA.\n\nNovelist Ishmael Reed\n\nSF Author Samuel Delany\n\nSF Author Octavia Butler\n\nIt’s a tad pretentious, but there are some interesting people here.\n\nThere’s another slice of FTL news, followed by the start of John Sayles’ Brother from Another Planet. The tape ends during the film.\n\nHere’s a compilation of all the links and FTL news bits.\n\nAdverts:\n\ntrail: Eleven Men Against Eleven\n\nIrn Bru\n\nLittlewoods Pools\n\nAdidas\n\nRenault 19\n\nComfort\n\ntrail: Equinox: Cybersecrecy\n\nRover\n\nShredded Wheat Fruitful\n\nAA\n\nAxa Equity and Law\n\nCastrol GTX\n\nSurf\n\nRenault 19\n\nI Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter\n\nAllied Dunbar\n\nAmerican Express\n\nPersil\n\nDomestos\n\nMitsubishi Shogun\n\nToo Good to be True\n\nOrange\n\nFlora – Valerie Singleton John Noakes\n\nDomestos\n\nOrganics\n\nCallard & Bowser Creamline Toffees\n\nVolvic\n\nEleven Men Against Eleven\n\nMcDonalds\n\nAxa Equity and Law\n\nDaily Express\n\nColgate Total\n\nThe Usual Suspects in cinemas\n\nCastrol GTX\n\nRover\n\nArm & Hammer Dental Care\n\nFruitopia\n\nWhile You Were Sleeping in cinemas\n\nClorets\n\nHovis\n\nThompson’s Roof Seal\n\nSure\n\nPersil\n\nColgate Total\n\nLevis Double Stitched\n\nRenault 5\n\nTrue Lies on video\n\nMcCain Oven Chips\n\nTexas Instruments\n\nCarling Black Label\n\nSafeway\n\ntrail: Frasier\n\nMidland Bank\n\n7Up Light\n\nHead & Shoulders\n\nRolo\n\nNissan Micra Hollywood\n\nAnadin Extra\n\nCoors\n\ntrail: Equinox: Cybersecrecy\n\nLittlewoods Pools\n\nPeperami Minis\n\nImperial Leather\n\nRoyal London\n\nDHL\n\nFruitopia\n\nCastrol GTX\n\nJohn Smith’s\n\ntrail: Pump Up the Volume\n\nNissan Micra Hollywood\n\nOrangina\n\nNike\n\nTexas Instruments\n\nSony\n\nMidland Bank\n\nMurphy’s\n\nA couple of movies now. First there’s Hostile Hostages, a comedy with Denis Leary, Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey.\n\nFirst surprise – it appears to be a Christmas film, which I’d forgotten from the first time I watched it.\n\nThe screenplay is by Richard Lagravanese and Marie Weiss. Lagravanese also wrote The Fisher King.\n\nThere’s an uncredited BD Wong playing marriage counsellor Dr Wong, in a session with Davis and Spacey.\n\nAlso appearing, JK Simmons as an officer at a military school.\n\nLeary plays a burglar whose heist goes wrong, sparking a huge manhunt by the local, rather inexperienced, volunteer police force. To escape, he kidnaps Davis and Spacey and forces them to drive him to their home.\n\nBut they’re expecting Spacey’s family, including sister Christine Baranski\n\nand mother Glynis Johns.\n\nDinner looks like it would be unbearable even without a kidnapper at the table.\n\nBut in the end, it all works out OK, and everyone learns important life lessons.\n\nAfter this, recording switches to BBC1 on Boxing Day, with the end of Children’s BBC, and a trailer for Beethoven.\n\nThen, Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines. Starting with a montage of old attempts at flight, and then some lovely animated titles designed by Ronald Searle.\n\nThere’s Willy Rushton in a small role. These films are filled with great British actors (with the odd American put in there for overseas sales).\n\nJohn Le Mesurier as a French Painter.\n\nTony Hancock\n\nEric Sykes\n\nBenny Hill\n\nGod, I love 60s-era blue screen.\n\nThis film is the kind of film that thinks it’s very funny, but isn’t really. It so far seems to only have one joke, that of an aeroplane being flown badly, or dangerously, and crashing into things. Plus all the characters are awful, with the possible exception of Sarah Miles, the daughter of the newspaper tycoon (Robert Morley) who offers the prize for the London to Paris race. She desperately wants to fly, but he won’t let her.\n\nStuart Whitman seems to spend this entire movie standing on or hanging from one part of a plane or other.\n\nWas it ever common to hyphenate ‘today’?\n\nHere’s Jeremy Lloyd, writer of Are You Being Served\n\nOne of the stars is Terry-Thomas, who spends the whole film sabotaging the other pilots’ planes. I wonder if Dick Dastardly was based on this character?\n\nFlora Robson, typecast as a nun.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 26th December 1995 – 10:45\n\nThere’s a trailer for Boxing Day programmes.\n\nThen, the news, with Justin Webb. Bad weather is the main news.\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for Ghost. Then there’s the start of Neighbours, and the recording stops.\n\nAdverts:\n\nLynx Systeme\n\nNo7\n\nHalls\n\nWoolworths\n\nMartini\n\ntrail: Mrs Doubtfire\n\nMore from Moonbase Alpha on this tape. I like Derek Wadsworth’s main title for series 2, although I know many Barry Gray fans would see that as heresy. But one thing I don’t like about it is the way it starts. It always sounds like it’s been started in the middle of the piece, and the start has been missed off. Unlike Gray’s theme for S1 which has the most magnificent opening. But I do still like Wadsworth’s theme.\n\nThis episode sees yet another buried tomb being unearthed by the Alphans. This one is actually on the moon itself, which is at least a nice mystery.\n\nThis episode is called Mark of the Archanon. The tomb contained two people, an adult and a child. Despite having been buried on the moon for millennia (we presume) his tight curls haven’t lost their bounce.\n\nOddly enough, the child is bald on top, so I guess he hasn’t inherited his father’s hirsute genes. Or perhaps it’s cosmetic baldness.\n\nThe eponymous Mark of Archanon is on the man’s forehead, and it’s clearly a significant mark, as it glows when he’s going to do something violent.\n\nSo he takes some bubble-wrap bandage to cover it up.\n\nPasc tells the Alphans that they are Archanons, Peace Bringers. “Violence was outlawed on our world” he says, as if this is something odd. This story is very judgmental about Earth. The Archanons travelled the galaxy bringing their message of peace, and their only failure was on Earth (explaining their presence on the Moon). Earth’s violence was so pervasive that it infected the Archanons, and Pasc tells them that they were the only ones not affected, so they were locked in the tomb on the Moon.\n\nBut it’s clear he’s lying, as he looks close to killing Alan Carter before Etrec deflects him.\n\nMaya and Koenig are away from Moonbase, flying through an asteroid field, allowing lots of new shots of the Eagle.\n\nPasc takes Russell prisoner, and demands that Etrec be brought to him. Carter, who has developed a bit of a big brother relationship with Etrec, is told that they need a sample of Etrec’s blood. But Etrec is also showing the mark of the killing sickness, and threatens Carter with a knife.\n\nBut he can’t do it, and instead tries to cut the mark from his forehead.\n\nArchanons can’t regenerate blood (not a good evolutionary strategy, I would say) so the only thing that can save Etrec is Pasc’s blood. Plus, Dr Russell can make a cure for the virus that causes the killing sickness.\n\nDespite typically shoddy science, and overly preachy “aren’t all humans horrible” subtext, I was genuinely moved by this episode. It just shows that if you base your stories around character rather than action, they work a whole lot better.\n\nAfter this, recording continues for a short time, into the start of an episode of The Prisoner.\n\nThen recording switches to BBC2 and the end of an episode of The Young Ones.\n\nThere’s a trailer for Nick Broomfield’s film Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam.\n\nThen, as part of Animated 2, there’s Gary Larson’s Tales from the Far Side. I love Larson’s cartoons, but this only ever elicits a wry smile or two, and no actual laughs.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 21st December 1995 – 22:00\n\nThere’s a trailer for Arena: The Burger and the King (about Elvis). Then the very start of Newsnight leading with the divorce of Charles and Diana.

Written by ‘John MacUre’ which was a pseudonym for Jed Mercurio – to this day I can’t believe that’s not the wrong way round.\n\nThe programme opens with Dr Mortimer learning that he’s HIV positive and has signs of AIDS.\n\nSomeone has leaked his diagnosis to the papers, causing problems for the hospital manager.\n\nMr DeVries is convinced he’s the father of a young boy, and tricks him into letting him draw blood so he can test it.\n\nJunior doctor Phil Kirkby has to prepare chemotherapy for a patient, but he’s not done that before, and nobody seems able to help, not even the senior, who was making noises earlier in the episode about ‘patronage’.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 31st May 1995 – 21:30\n\nBefore the next episode, there’s the end of the news, and weather from Ian McCaskill.\n\nThere’s a trailer for Inside Story.\n\nThen, episode 8 of Cardiac Arrest, The Betrayed. There’s a nice presentation glitch at the start.\n\nPhil Kirkby is being made a scapegoat for his chemo patient dying after being given incorrectly mixed drugs. The hospital manager doesn’t want him to say that long hours or incomplete training might have been responsible for his error. He’s promised that they’ll look after him.\n\nBut the inquest, when he omits to tell them that he contacted his senior doctor and was told to proceed, determines that he was responsible and it was an unlawful killing.\n\nAt the end of the programme, Claire Maitland (Helen Baxendale) who had left the hospital, and was almost considering private medicine, has a road to Damascus moment saving a man in a pub having a heart attack, and by the end of the programme, the old team are back in business.\n\nThese were 30 minute shows, a very unusual length for a drama in those days. And they definitely showed Mercurio as a name to watch, as his subsequent career has shown. Plus who doesn’t love Helen Baxendale as a doctor. Smart women always do it for me.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 7th June 1995 – 21:30\n\nAfter this, recording continues, an we basically get the rest of the evening on BBC1. There’s a trailer for Blackadder Goes Forth, and one for Men Behaving Badly.\n\nThen, French and Saunders go to the Movies is a compilation of some of their movie parodies.\n\nIn their Bergman parody, Simon Brint is a perfect Death.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 7th June 1995 – 22:00\n\nAfter this there’s a trailer for Birds of a Feather.\n\nThen, Hospitalwatch presented by Sue Lawley and a very hirsute Tony Robinson.\n\nThere’s a patient using a BBC Micro and 5 1/4″ Floppies for rehabilitation after being in a coma. This was 1995.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 7th June 1995 – 22:30\n\nAfter this there’s a trailer for Castles, then the start of a TV movie, She Knows Too Much (BBC One – 7th June 1995 – 23:00) and almost the whole film is here, bar the last five minutes. I didn’t watch it.\n\nBack to Bravo on this tape, for more from Gerry Anderson’s Live Action period, and UFO. Yay, more actual aliens.\n\nThis episode is Survival, and starts on Moonbase with the alien shooting a hole in a window leading to a ‘pressure leak’. It’s nicely signalled by a balloon with Straker’s face on it getting larger.\n\nFoster has to leave one of his men in the room as the air rushes out. Luckily, Moonbase has a 24 hour glazier service.\n\nTrying to get hold of the UFO on the moon, Foster is stranded out there, presumed dead. Straker offers command of Moonbase to the next most senior officer, Mark Bradley.\n\nTo Straker’s surprise, he refuses, because he thinks Straker doesn’t really want him, and is only asking because of seniority. Straker says “Don’t give me that… racial prejudice burned itself out five years ago.” “How would you know?” replies Bradley. Whilst it’s still quite naive, this is also quite a nuanced exchange, especially for 1970.\n\nAfter this, over to Space 1999. The Alphans are investigating a planet, which the computer has designated ‘Terra Nova’ – New Earth. It sounds perfect, but the Eagle crew on their way back is zapped by something.\n\nThis episode is called Matter of Life and Death. What on earth is going on with Rudi Gernreich’s credit font? All the others are as normal, but his has gone all blocky and sixties. It’s not usually like this.\n\nWhen the Eagle returns, it has an extra passenger – Dr Russell’s husband, who has been presumed dead for five years.\n\nHe’s warning them not to go to the planet, but they don’t listen. Everything goes wrong and everybody dies, then he comes back to talk to Helena again, everyone’s back to normal, and they cancel the exodus to the planet.\n\nGod this show is like anti-drama.\n\nAfter this, there’s a very brief glimpse of BBC1 – I presume this was a recording I recorded over. More from that later.\n\nBecause what’s now on it is more Space 1999. Black Sun sees the moon pulled into a black hole. A single escape craft can hold six people to save them from the black hole, but the rest of Alpha is drawn in. Koenig and Bergman have a philosophical discussion about God, or a mysterious cosmic force, as Bergman describes it. I’m reminded again how much I like Barry Morse in this, and how much better he is that either of the two leads.\n\nKOENIG: “Do you have any idea what’ll happen to us inside the Black Sun.\n\nBERGMAN: “Whatever it is, I just hope it’s interesting.”\n\nLovely.\n\nThen, of course, the show goes all silly again, with the crew of the rescue ship fading away, Koening and Bergman suddenly looking really old, and they decide that the ultimate answer is “Everything is everything else. Every star is a cell in the brain of the universe.”\n\nBut the moon survives the trip through the black hole, thanks to Professor Bergman’s force field, and then, miraculously, the rescue ship finds them, all the way at the other end of the universe.\n\nNonsense, really.\n\nAfter this, there’s the start of an episode of Twin Peaks, but that recording stops, and underneath, there’s an episode of Come Dancing, which I think is the end of the recording earlier that was overwritten.\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for Always and one for Smith and Jones.\n\nThen, the start of a comedy film, Born in East LA. A delve through BBC Genome tells me this was 11th September 1995, so looking back, I’m assuming that the programme that was overwritten was Omnibus – One Prom Short of a Season. Which is a shame, as I’d like to have seen that again. However, looking at my database, I have another recording of that on another tape, so that might be why this one wasn’t kept.\n\nThe tape ends during the film.\n\nAdverts:\n\nHamilton Direct Bank\n\nDestination Discovery\n\nFamily Channel\n\ntrail: Friday Fright\n\ntrail: Sapphire and Steel\n\ntrail: The Critic\n\nWrangler\n\nPeperami Wideboy\n\nSure\n\nOld Spice\n\nBodyform\n\nFairy Liquid\n\nPreferred Direct\n\ntrail: Twin Peaks\n\ntrail: Sapphire and Steel\n\nLevis Double Stitched\n\nWalkers/Quavers\n\nRolo\n\nCrunchy Nut Cornflakes\n\nOil of Ulay\n\nKwik Fit Insurance\n\ntrail: Space 1999\n\ntrail: Space 1999\n\ntrail: Friday Fright\n\nPreferred Direct\n\nHamilton Direct Bank\n\nDestination Discovery\n\nFamily Channel\n\ntrail: The Critic\n\ntrail: Graham Green Season\n\ntrail: thirtysomething\n\nDestination Discovery\n\nFamily Channel\n\ntrail: Comic Genius\n\ntrail: Sapphire and Steel\n\nBacardi\n\nWalkers/Quavers\n\nOil of Ulay\n\nKwik Fit Insurance\n\nCornhill Direct\n\ntrail: UFO\n\nAmerican Express\n\nArmy Soldier\n\nWalkers/Quavers\n\nLunn Poly\n\nWeightwatchers\n\nNurofen Plus\n\ntrail: Twin Peaks\n\nHSA Direct\n\nHamilton Direct Bank\n\nFamily Channel\n\nDiscovery Channel\n\ntrail: Sapphire and Steel\n\ntrail: Dr Jekyll & Sister Hyde\n\ntrail: UFO\n\nSharwood’s\n\nNike\n\nPeperami Wideboy\n\nFruitopia\n\nSomerfield\n\nSun Valley\n\nCornhill Direct\n\nSharwood’s\n\ntrail: Sapphire and Steel\n\ntrail: Twin Peaks\n\nMurphy’s\n\nVolvo 850\n\nModern Apprenticeships\n\nKwik Fit Insurance\n\nSomerfield\n\nSun Valley\n\ntrail: Jason King\n\ntrail: Dr Jekyll & Sister Hyde\n\nPeperami Wideboy\n\nThe Best … In The World Ever\n\nPedigree Chum\n\nDaily Star\n\nSun Valley\n\nTeletext\n\nDiscovery Channel\n\ntrail: Hoffman\n\ntrail: They’re Here\n\ntrail: Sapphire and Steel\n\nHeineken Export\n\nMidland Bank\n\nLunn Poly\n\nAnadin Extra\n\nSun Valley\n\nBupa\n\nDaily Star\n\nCoca Cola\n\ntrail: The Entity"
