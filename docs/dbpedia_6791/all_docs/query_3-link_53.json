        "text": "The watch is in free-fall rather than lying on the ground. Thus it supplies a variant upon a celebrated metaphor for creation posited by William Paley in 1802. In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there, I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had Iain there for ever... But suppose I found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place, I should hardly think of the answer which I had before given... Yet why should not this answer serve for the watch as well as for the stone?... For this reason, and for no other, viz., that, when we come to inspect the watch, we perceive (what we could not discover in the stone) that its several parts are framed and put together for a purpose... This the Argument from Design posits the necessity of God as the maker of nature’s intricate and well ordered ‘manifestation of design’ which ‘in the complexity, subtilty, and curiosity of the mechanism’far surpasses the watch. It is a Newtonian argument, but despite its popularity, philosophically unsound, as David Hume had shown a quarter of a century before Paley wrote. (William Paley, Natural Theology (1802) in John Hick, ed., The Existence of God (London: Collier-Macmillan, 1964) pp.99–103.)"
