His films produce an unshakeable feeling that one is communing with or being acted upon by an occult power. Not in any nefarious sense, but more in the feeling that he is cracking open the door to a new reality or way of being that we can access only a fraction of but know exists somewhere beyond the threshold.\n\nBilled as \"The Professor\", \"The Senator\" and \"The Ballplayer\" Michael Emil, Tony Curtis, and Gary Busey are all great, but I can't overstate just how powerful and beautiful a performance Theresa Russell gives as \"The Actress.\" The scene where she performs an explanation of the theory of relativity using toy cars, flashlights and balloons is an absolute joy. Like the rest of this movie, both whimsical and haunting in equal measure.\n\nHas one of the most stunning and apocalyptic endings of any movie I've seen in recent memory. It is also insanely horny."
