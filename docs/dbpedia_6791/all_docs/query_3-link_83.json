        "text": "In the realm of theater, there is sublime, there is thought-provoking, there is quirky and there’s really weird.\n\nDragon Productions Theatre Company’s production of “Insignificance” portends importance but frequently teeters ever so slightly toward the weird rather than merely being quirky.\n\nRunning through Feb. 18, dramatist Terry Johnson’s 1982 play has a somewhat intriguing premise — unlikely though it may be. He “imagines” that Joe McCarthy, Albert Einstein, Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio meet in a New York City hotel room in 1953. OK, that’s quirky, but not yet weird.\n\nBrushing aside the actual dates of the real events he includes, Johnson has his four famous people meeting when McCarthy, the conniving senator from Wisconsin (curiously, he’s from Louisiana in this telling), is holding committee hearings on un-American activities, and he has subpoenaed the noted physicist to testify. If he refuses, the senator says he will destroy years of the professor’s mathematical equations.\n\nSo far, interesting, but not very well-acted by the usually reliable Jim Johnson as the mustachioed professor and way over-acted by Gary Mosher as the slimy senator.\n\nThen a welcome whirlwind appears in the breathy, disheveled guise of Marilyn Monroe, wearing a near-replica of the dress she famously wore (and allowed to billow above her head) in the film, “The Seven Year Itch.” The how and why she comes to Einstein’s hotel room is sketchy, though it gets intriguing when she admits she keeps a list of the 10 men she wants to (and apparently hasn’t as yet) slept with. Einstein’s No. 3, but after talking with him, she’s moving him up to the top of the list.\n\nThis scene — long though it is — is the best one in this slight play. It requires the audience to suspend belief and accept the fact that Marilyn is a real science junkie and has brought a satchel-full of props (toy trains, a flashlight, a Charlie Chaplin doll) to demonstrate the theory of relativity — to Einstein, no less — but her approach is so assured, so artless, and so almost understandable. Now that takes a lot of chutzpa!\n\nIt’s actually quite fascinating, in a voyeuristic sort of way, to watch the timid professor undress and get under the covers, then ogle the actress as she squirms out of her dress and slip and climbs in bed next to him.\n\nJust when it seems as if the two might share another exciting scene, a fierce pounding at the door indicates that DiMaggio (the Ballplayer) has shown up to take his wife home.\n\nIt’s just a small inconsistency that the two weren’t yet married in 1953, but it could have still been an interesting dramatic dilemma were it not that the Ballplayer (Nick Mandracchia) is a bubble-gum chewing, ignorant, insensitive guy — with horrible grammar no less. No way would the Actress have married this guy!\n\nSo, improbabilities after improbabilities make a person wonder what Johnson was thinking when he created “Insignificance.” At times whole passages of dialogue sound as if they were meant to be in a different play — or at least shouldn’t have been in this one.\n\nJohnson seems to want to explore a mixed bag of events and outcomes, yet none is explored in enough depth to get a handle on it. And because the British play first came out in 1982, some of the humor isn’t very funny anymore.\n\nPerhaps director Laura Jane Bailey, a fine actress in her own right, is going for camp in this production. But there’s too much inane posturing, mugging and emphatic statements so that any real emotion gets lost. It’s also obvious she didn’t choose the actors for their physical resemblance to their characters, yet that only makes it harder to relate to them.\n\nAnd what’s with the blaring noise coming from outside an open window (or was it from a heater?) several times during the play? It’s difficult to hear the actors’ words when it’s on.\n\nEric Johnson’s set is straightforward and era appropriate, especially the soft turquoise wallpaper featuring colorful geometric shapes. Kathleen Qiu deserves huge raves for finding or making that legendary Monroe dress, and the men’s clothing befit the 1950s timeframe. The Professor’s attire is nondescript save for his “Princeton” sweatshirt.\n\nEdward Liptzin’s lighting and Jonathan Covey’s sound work flawlessly.\n\nYet the nagging question remains: Why was this “insignificant” play ever written in the first place?\n\nEmail Joanne Engelhardt at joanneengelhardt@comcast.net.\n\nTheater\n\nWhat: “Insignificance”\n\nWhere: Dragon Theatre, 2120 Broadway St., Redwood City\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Thursdays-Saturdays, 2 p.m. Sundays\n\nThrough: Feb. 18\n\nTickets: $27-35; $15 rush tickets on Thursdays and Fridays; 650-493-2006 or http://www.dragonproductions.net"
