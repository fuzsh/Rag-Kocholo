        "text": "The onslaught of brand new Criterion Collection titles has brought a few surprises our way, including the United Kingdom brain-jolter from 1985, Insignificance, a whimsical look at the hourglass of panic, paranoia and finger-pointing that occurred throughout the Cold War in America. Director Nicolas Roeg orchestrates this awe-inspiring head-scratcher, which stars the likes of Tony Curtis, Gary Busey, and Michael Emil. The DVD and Blu-ray will arrive on June 14, 2011.\n\nFour unnamed people who look and sound a lot like Albert Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and Joseph McCarthy converge in one New York City hotel room for this compelling, visually inventive adaptation of Terry Johnson's play, from director Roeg. With a combination of whimsy and dread, Roeg creates a fun-house-mirror picture of cold war America that questions the nature of celebrity and plays on a society's simmering nuclear fears.\n\nAs with all Criterion Collection releases, you can fully expect that both versions will contain bonus materials and extra features, and the DVD will be available for the MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) of $29.95, while the Blu-ray will run at the MSRP of $39.95.\n\nThe releases will feature the following bonus materials:\n\n-- Newly restored digital transfer, supervised and approved by director Nicolas Roeg and producer Jeremy Thomas (with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition)\n\n-- New video interviews with Roeg, Thomas, and editor Tony Lawson\n\n-- Making \"Insignificance,\" a short documentary shot on the set of the film\n\n-- Original theatrical trailer\n\n-- A booklet featuring an essay by film critic Chuck Stephens and a reprinted exchange between Roeg and screenwriter Terry Johnson\n\nCheck out the box art below:\n\nStay tuned to IGN DVD for more information about this and other upcoming releases!"
