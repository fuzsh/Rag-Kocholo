        "text": "In this essay I use theories of counterfactual history and cinematic affect to argue that, while we often think of narrative cinema as being purely fictional, in some senses it might not be. I argue that cinema may function as something of a 'counterfactual machine' that challenges the traditional boundary between reality and fiction, precisely because cinema can have real and physical effects on us. By looking closely at Inglourious Basterds, I also argue that Tarantino's film is in many respects aware of the power of cinema in a physical and a cultural sense, and that the film deliberately explores how cinema can and does posit its own reality.\n\n\"Quentin Tarantino’s latest violent masterpiece Inglourious Basterds has been well yet critically received. Many reviewers have pointed out that the film is morally ambivalent the least because of the aesthetics of violence and the revised version of Europe’s darkest years of the twentieth century. Others, however, perceive it as a much needed and refreshing film - despite or precisely because Tarantino makes obvious the webs of violence. This article suggests that violence is a deliberate and important means for Inglourious Basterds to work. To fully appreciate the multilayered message of the film, an alternative reading of its aesthetics of violence is necessary: one that focuses on Tarantino’s defiant and bold (yet intentional) use of various forms of violence to brilliantly orchestrate (or manipulate) the viewers’ emotions and bodily senses. He stages violence as spectacle, but the way he uses violence is always also more than a spectacle: it serves as irritation—or better interruption—of audience perception, audience experience, and audience expectations. Instead of offering a cathartic moment or happy ending, Tarantino, in fact, refuses to offer catharsis and thus opens up a space for reflection and trans- formation.\"\n\nThis article presents Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds as a 'masterpiece' of meta-cinema that satirizes its audience(s) directly. The particular focus is how Tarantino creates and leverages a network of analogical relations and/or resonances to reflect and/or fold spectators back upon themselves and make us (the viewing audience) the butt or (Private) 'Butz' of his joke. This article also argues that Tarantino attacks and manipulates the viewer's sensibilities and perceptions with a view to affording them a shock of recognition − exposing audiences to their enjoyment (and, by extension , complicity in the co-production) of on-screen violence and their willingness to be manipulated by the director into a position that parallels that of the in-film Nazi audience − and, thereby enabling spectators to see themselves and their relations to film more clearly.\n\nIn this research project, such profanities, displays of mixed violence and humor, and unbridled obscurities will be discussed, because this is precisely what Tarantino’s filmmaking prowess contains. Together with this, feminist film theory, its history and its significance on culture will also be discussed, followed by Tarantino’s impact on Western cinema and his contribution to feministic film culture. However, it will not delve into reactions of other viewers of Tarantino’s films, whether male or female, and there will be limited exploration into the feminist movements before this era’s third-wave feminism, along with how Tarantino’s female characters are perceived in the feminist film critic’s perspective. The films that will be focused on are Pulp Fiction (1994), Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2 (2003-2004), Death Proof (2007), Inglorious Basterds (2009), and Django Unchained (2012). This selection from Tarantino’s oeuvre, spanning fifteen years, best exhibits the stark contrast between the opposing sides of female attributes in his films: the empowerment of women and sexism towards them, because all of these films contain images, dialogue and situations within the storylines that contribute to the issue to be discussed that surrounds Tarantino’s films. Most importantly, it will discuss the issue of the way women are presented in his films, and will study them closer. Moreover, it aims to answer the question that is a natural response after watching his films: the question of whether his films empower women or exploit them, due to the fact that both feministic and sexist attributes are found throughout Tarantino’s oeuvre. The leading women in Quentin Tarantino’s films exhibit the conflict between women empowerment and sexism towards women, while contributing to the development of feministic film culture."
