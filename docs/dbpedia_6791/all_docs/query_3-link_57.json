        "text": "“People in showbiz are idiots. They just go with the trend, they just go with the fashion — it’s a fashion business.” - Oliver Stone\n\nDirector Oliver Stone has never been known for mincing his words and that continues to be the case in his latest comments about the state of Hollywood in a piece for Variety. It’s a sentiment that is currently echoing throughout the halls of social media as many long-running studio franchises are starting to show the chinks in their franchise armor and the rumblings of “superhero fatigue” are once again making the rounds.\n\nWhile many tend to agree that superhero fatigue is a real thing and that it’s something they are most definitely reeling from, some still disagree, including Deadpool creator Rob Liefeld. “There is no comic book super hero movie fatigue,” said Liefeld in a recent Tweet. “Audiences are more sophisticated now than they were a decade back and expect better. If the movie is clever, daring and the characters are engaging, the audience will show up and roar with approval. It’s all in the execution.”\n\nSo, what to make of the current state of not just superhero films, but franchise films in general? Is it all falling apart, or have the standards changed for audiences, who will no longer accept mediocre attempts to secure their hard-earned money with schlock that has passed its creative expiration date? It’s something I covered already in my piece about George McFly from 1955 loving Shazam: Fury of the Gods, but audiences in 2023 all but hating it.\n\nBut is there more to it than just a standard shift or is it truly a shift from loving to hating cape shit?\n\nFirst, you have to look at the monumental success of Marvel Studios, who built a cinematic empire from 2008 through 2019, culminating in Avengers: Endgame becoming the highest-grossing film of all time (before being downgraded to second place after a little Avatar re-release bullshit). That’s no small feat. It also means that it isn’t just a bunch of comic-book nerds flooding the theater to watch it (even though they most definitely went back for multiple helpings). This was a global phenomenon and it reached a precipice in 2019, wrapping up three phases of films with serialized long-form storytelling, the likes of which had never been accomplished in live-action features before.\n\nThe only question after that is: What now?\n\nUnfortunately, Marvel Studios is finding out the answer, which is a mostly lackluster showing of all their films post Avengers: Endgame, minus their joint production of Spider-Man: No Way Home with Sony, which managed to reach the same kind of hype levels as Endgame, while cracking the door on new ways to exploit their franchise with a multiverse. However, that exploitation thus far has mostly been met with a slow clap rather than a loud roar as audiences are left to wonder what they should be excited for, especially after the two biggest characters of that successful universe (Tony Stark/Iron Man and Steve Rogers/Captain America, respectively) have vacated the franchise.\n\nAnother major setback for Marvel is the advent of Disney+, which at first seemed like a promising venue to expand and explore the MCU, but has instead become a stain on its legacy, suffering from a slew of questionable creatives who seem hellbent on undoing everything cool, interesting, or exciting about the MCU, instead injecting a hefty amount of sluggish, boring, woke, and misdirected content that’s a far cry from the projects that were released in theaters. Budget, talent, and VFX all suffered and, as a result, so did audiences.\n\nWandaVision and Loki aside, two series that seemed to rise to the challenge, the MCU shows have been little more than low-budget snooze fests packed with mediocre takes on characters that deserved far better. Underwhelming is probably the aptest description for everything from The Falcon and The Winter Soldier to Hawkeye to She-Hulk to the latest bore session, Secret Invasion.\n\nAside from having no clear vision in terms of what the MCU even is after the game-changing finale of Avengers: Endgame, the films have simply struggled to capture the magic, charisma, or creative spirit that came before, leaving audiences chasing the Endgame high and wondering if they should find a new dealer.\n\nUnfortunately, the only other superhero dealer in town is DC, and their track record has been spotty at best, ever since they bet the farm on Zack Snyder to lead the charge, then had a crisis of faith when critics didn’t bow down before Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, and sent him packing. Their knee-jerk course correction resulted in an attempt to “Marvelize” the DC Universe, which blew up in their face with Joss Whedon’s bastardized version of Snyder’s Justice League but was later salvaged in a big way with James Wan’s Aquaman, to date the only DC film to crack the $1 billion mark since Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight trilogy.\n\nAquaman may have marked a high point for DC, but it was short-lived, as the powers that be continued to invest in projects that nobody wanted to see. Or, rather, in projects that people might have wanted to see if they weren’t so terrible. Wonder Woman 1984, a Covid-era release that many were genuinely excited for, turned out to be an abject failure on all fronts, followed by Birds of Prey, which continued the downward trajectory, topped off with James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad (a movie I loved), a film that managed to make just $168 million worldwide, a pretty awful haul considering the talent and IP involved, even in the theatrical turmoil that Covid caused.\n\nMatt Reeves non-DCEU related The Batman restored some faith amongst fans, but Dwayne Johnson’s long-awaited Black Adam turned out to be a complete dud, which did the opposite of what the megastar promised, which was to change the hierarchy of power in the DCEU. Well, in hindsight, I guess Black Adam DID change the hierarchy of power, just not in the way it was intended. The promise of Henry Cavill’s return as Superman was axed, as was a whole bunch of other DC projects, as the WB/Discovery merger knocked everything into disarray, leading to James Gunn and Peter Safran as the new hierarchy of power in the DCU.\n\nNow, all that’s left are the remaining scraps of the DCEU, the lackluster Shazam: Fury of the Gods sequel, the VFX nightmare that is The Flash (but, hey, I still dug it), and now two more last-ditch efforts to put a cherry on top of the era, Blue Beetle (which nobody wants to see) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, a too-little-too-late sequel that could be amazing or terrible, but it won’t even matter, as everything changes in 2025 with James Gunn’s Superman: Legacy, a hard/soft/whatever reboot of the whole DCU.\n\nOkay, great, Paul. You’ve given us a history lesson, but what the hell does any of it amount to? Are we suffering from superhero fatigue or not? Is cape shit coming to an end?\n\nYes. And no. Also, no, but yes.\n\nSuperhero fatigue is just a broad term to cover the fluctuating desire of audiences for a given genre at any point in time. It’s an arbitrary and subjective term that only holds weight if you believe it to be true. I.E. Do YOU have superhero fatigue? Then, yes, superhero fatigue is real. Do ALL audiences have superhero fatigue? Based on the box office? Yeah, a little bit, but not to the point that the ride is over. Far from it.\n\nBut, that doesn’t mean that things can stay the same, because if they do, then what you will witness is the gradual decline and eventual replacement of the genre with something else. Just as westerns, musicals, and action movies were replaced by the superhero genre, time, interest, influence, and money from audiences will determine what you’ll see in theaters for the next decade and beyond and it’s far too soon to call what that will be. That said, superhero movies are probably the safest bet in town, so fatigue or no, they aren’t going anywhere anytime soon, even if you are absolutely sick of them.\n\nAlso, let’s take into consideration that not EVERY superhero movie has to be a massive success to perpetuate more of them. You don’t-and stay with me here-have to LOVE every single superhero movie that hits theaters. I know, it’s a crazy concept, but trust me here. As a kid, my superheroes were Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Willis and as much as I loved movies like Rambo III, Terminator 2, or The Last Boy Scout, I did NOT love movies like The Specialist, Collateral Damage, or Striking Distance. For every great action movie those guys made, they also made a stinker or mediocre entry in their filmography. They weren’t all winners and that’s okay. Welcome to the world of shooting your shot. Sometimes you hit, sometimes you miss.\n\nBeyond that, it’s not like there haven’t been successes in the genre since Endgame and Aquaman. Spider-Man: No Way Home was quick to remind audiences that there’s still magic to be made and despite low enthusiasm, almost all Phase 4 films have made a minimum of $400 million globally, which may not be $1 billion, but it’s not nothing. Currently, both Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse are keeping theaters vibrant and alive. For DC, while The Batman and Black Adam didn’t break the box office, they are both a significant rebound from the three DC movies prior (although Shazam 2 and The Flash aren’t exactly reigniting things).\n\nThe bottom line is that this genre will have highs and lows. They won’t all be Avengers: Endgame, Spider-Man: No Way Home or Aquaman. And, that’s okay. To a point. Because it’s also okay to want more out of them as an audience.\n\nSo, the latest MCU or DCU film isn’t on the scale of one of the aforementioned blockbusters; that’s fine. But, it still needs to be something more than what we’ve seen a hundred times over by now. What audiences hate more than anything is being bored and that’s why movies like Shazam: Fury of the Gods, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Secret Invasion, and even the non-comic-book franchise Fast X are underperforming (or outright flopping).\n\nIt’s lost touch with reality. The audience perhaps likes the video game. But I get bored by it,. How many cars can crash? How many stunts can you do? What’s the difference between ‘Fast and Furious’ and some other film? It’s just one thing after another. Whether it’s a super-human Marvel character or just a human being like John Wick, it doesn’t make any difference. It’s not believable.” - Oliver Stone\n\nAudiences are bored of the same old tricks. If there’s one thing Hollywood loves, it’s a formula for success. Mostly, because there isn’t one, but they’ll never stop trying to find it. Even as I type this WB just signed a deal to have AI make business decisions for them. The endless quest to find out which project to invest in that will separate you from your money continues, like explorers looking for a lost city of gold that doesn’t exist. They’ll never settle for the gold bars they’ve already found; they want the whole treasure.\n\nThe crazy thing is that all of these studios already have the formula for success at their fingertips, but they’re too blinded by the easy wrong over the hard right. The formula is simple. It’s QUALITY. Not what they think is quality, not what they hope is quality, not replicating everything that worked before and hoping for a second miracle. No, it comes from genuine, earnest, smart, intuitive, and creative quality. It comes from understanding what you have (in this case, comic book IP), understanding the audience (and their needs/desires), and ultimately understanding what it will take to deliver that product.\n\nUnfortunately, quality has taken a back seat over quantity, as I’ve already outlined with Marvel’s jump from bigscreen to smallscreen, which has greatly sullied their brand. It’s also stretched the VFX houses, who are responsible for an insane amount of the quality needed to sell these films, forcing them to cut corners and deliver subpar product to overly-demanding studios who are trying to keep up with the joneses, rather than make the best film/show they can possibly make. They’ve let demand drive their product, rather than a pursuit of perfection. Keep the villagers fat and happy. Keep the gears grinding. Keep the factories running.\n\nAnd there’s a whole other article in my brain about what we’re losing to event films dominating theaters, but I’ll save that for another time. Bottom line is that the two latest films from Martin Scorsese have to be watched at home, and anything sans capes, cars, or CGI creatures is kicked to the streaming curb, no matter who is making it. Sure, some sneak by and occupy a screen for a few weeks here and there, but it mostly just pops up and fades into streaming obscurity and that’s the real thing audiences are losing. Diversity of content on the bigscreen is almost extinct, but we’re too busy complaining about not having better versions of the same old shit.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I’m more than willing to wait an extra year or two for something amazing, rather than be force fed half-baked cinematic fast food all year long. If anyone says waiting is a bad idea and that folks will forget your project and it will lose momentum, I’d ask you to speak with a Mr. James Cameron. It also opens the doors back up to let in a more diverse array of films that don’t rely purely on spectacle.\n\nPlaying devil’s advocate, if the trend were to continue on a downward spiral, two of the greatest filmmakers of our generation may well have already called what the future looks like. Both Steven Spielberg and George Lucas predicted an inevitable “event film” implosion, saying in a speech at USC in 2013 that, \"There's going to be an implosion where three or four or maybe even half a dozen of these mega-budgeted movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that's going to change the paradigm again.\"\n\nWhile I don’t think we’re quite there yet, as there are still event films doing well, there’s merit to their prediction. If all of the studio money is being poured into the big-franchise pot and those films start failing, it will certainly force the powers that be to change their ways and refocus their efforts to quality over quantity. And if that were to happen, would it really be a bad thing?\n\nI guess we’ll find out."
