        "text": "Films are created through a cinematic process that includes several stages. It can be a script, preparation for filming, shooting of the material itself, editing, sound recording and other stages. Each film is a creative collective process that requires the cooperation of many specialists from different fields. The process of creating a film can be divided into several stages: 1. Developing a script: The first step is to develop a script or idea for a film. This is an important stage at which screenwriters or directors usually work. 2. Preparation for filming: After agreeing on the script, preparation for filming begins. This includes choosing locations, casting, creating costumes and sets, etc. 3. Filming: At this stage, the film will be shot according to the developed plan. 4. Editing: After the filming is completed, the material is edited, where the footage is cut, assembled into a logical sequence, effects are added, etc. 5. Post-production: This is the final stage where final corrections, adding music and sound effects, color correction, etc. are done. This is a general overview of the filmmaking process, but each case may have its own differences and details. This message has been generated by\n\nHere's a secret: you don't have to specialize. Early in my career I was asked, \"what do you want to be?\" The insinuation was that I'd need to pick a specialty within film production. \"I want to be able to do it all,\" I responded. I was lucky enough to work at a place where that would (mostly) become possible as advances in technology began to streamline access to filmmaking tools. I could be the producer, the writer and the DP. I could more effectively leave my mark on all facets of the production process. I'm aware that this goes against popular convention. Many super-smart coaches with large followings sing the praises of specializing and, in the same vein, finding a niche. I do believe that is the smart path for many. But I don't believe it is for me. My path began at RGTV, an award-winning production company based in New York led by Roman Gackowski. I was fortunate to work with a super-talented group where everyone often pulled more than their share of the weight. I won individual Emmy awards for producing, writing and shooting. Yet, deep down I wanted more. I wanted to finish the projects I started. I wanted to be an editor. At the next stop in my career, I made that goal a reality. You could also say I flirted with specialization. In David Jasse of DMJ Studios, I met a kindred spirit. A former editor himself, he understood how the final step of the production process can make-or-break a video. It was great to be a Senior Editor for someone who so thoroughly understood the craft. Soon, another opportunity knocked. Pavan Bahl from Bellwether Culture wanted to bring me on as Head of Creative production. In this role I would need to dust off many of those hats I had left dormant in the closet: videographer, producer, writer AND editor. I couldn't resist the opportunity. The first high-profile project where I could fully live out my return to being an anti-specialist was the production of a mini-documentary for NRVLD.co, featuring co-founders Pavan Bahl and Uzo Udu and partner Dale Moss. I couldn't have created this video without the contributions of many others. John Lopez and Virtue the Artist (IG: @virtuetheartist) filmed many of the beautiful visuals. Others, including Vic Ramos helped produce and shoot interviews. It was a team effort for sure, but it was also my return to putting my imprint on all facets of the production process. I served as director/producer/editor and also added some of my own vision from behind the camera. What was created was a video that immortalized an amazing multi-day gathering. But, contrary to many \"highlight videos,\" it also weaved in substance and storytelling. I have to believe it was integral to NRVLD partnering with elite brands the very next year, most notably Art Basel and Barry's Boot Camp.

We sat down with Elana to talk about her journey in Hollywood as well as what it takes to make the transition from writing and producing to stepping into the role of a director on set. Check out our conversation below. Elana RubinAngella Choe Editor's note: The following interview is edited for length and clarity. No Film School: What inspired you to make the leap from writing and producing to directing with your film, scalped!? Elana Rubin: I’ve recently learned that my writing process is me thinking as a director. I’m always building and envisioning full worlds in visuals and sounds in my mind as I write, which—news flash—is directing. \"scalped!\" came to me so strongly and quickly when I wrote it in July 2023. I saw the characters, their universe, and felt the need to transcribe what I saw in my brain to a screen, therefore I had to direct it. Plus, my fellow producer Chip Kass was instantly game to make \"scalped!\" with me, which made me feel like I could do it. NFS: Can you describe a moment during the production of \"scalped!\" where you felt a significant boost in your confidence as a director? Rubin: After we went into overtime on the first day of principal photography, I made an action plan to ensure that that wouldn’t happen on day two. The second day, I cut unnecessary lines from the script; worked with my 2nd AD (and fellow filmmaker) Frankie MacLaughlin to allocate the exact timing for setup, scenes, and moving equipment; and was more decisive with being ready to move on from a scene. Not going into overtime the second day and getting everything we needed made me feel a whole lot more confident than I was on day one. NFS: What advice would you give to other first-time filmmakers who are struggling to find their confidence? Rubin: As someone who struggled a ton with imposter syndrome as a first-time director, I’d really just advise you to do it. Prep as much as you can, speak to other filmmakers—but you’re not going to get the experience unless you try it. If the cost of making a short film is daunting, you could start with directing live theater, which is usually cheaper. NFS: In \"scalped!\", you explore themes like exploitative greed and fan dynamics. How did you ensure these themes were effectively communicated on screen? Rubin: It all starts with the script. And writing the characters within the scalped! universe came so easily to me because I’ve been a fan my whole life. I’ve experienced darker sides of fandom such as days-long pre-sales without getting tickets, having a ticket taken away from me, and being looked down on for my “lower brow” taste. But I’ve also experienced the immense joy of loving music and artists passionately with fellow fans. I always wanted that to com...\n\nHow I transformed from a fan to a filmmaker. In high school I used to be just a fan of cinema… …obsessively following the work of different Directors, Writers, Actors. Counting the days till their newest work would come out. And then I started studying it, obsessively in film school… reading anything I could get my hands on, watching everything my cinematic heros made, analyzing the craft and the impact. My film school was small and they got an avid non linear editing system but the town is also small so no one knew how to use it. Myself and other students took it upon ourselves to figure it out and within a fee years I was actually hired to teach editing on it to new students. So meanwhile I started making films and winning awards and I really became a filmmaker. I was hired to make documentaries. Hired to write scripts for independent producers and hired to Direct and Produce hundreds of videos for national and international brands…to help them sell and increase revenue. Today I continue to do all of the above at Koier Creative—>www.robkoier.com I see video as a very effective tool to solve problems. Be it my own creative work or commercial work for hire…what is the emotional core of the story, what are the themes that resonate with the particular audience and how best can the language of cinema be used to tell this story. If this resonates then comment THEME below and let’s work together to find the best way to use the language of cinema to accomplish your goals. What’s something you once desired to learn to do and now have become? #videoproduction #cinema #digitalmarketing #filmfan #thelanguageofcinema\n\nMastering Camera Angles: Camera angles are the fundamental aspect of filmmaking. Its shows the viewers the actions on screen. Lets explore what camera angles are and why they matter in the world of cinema. Camera angles actually means the position and perspective from which camera captures a scene. By choosing different angles, filmmakers create specific visual effects and depict different emotions to the audience. For example, a low-angle shot, where the camera is positioned below the subject, can make the subject appear powerful and dominant. Whereas, high angle shot, where the camera looks down on the subject from above, can make the subject vulnerable or insignificant. Disscussing about heights, camera angles vary in terms of distance too. For instance, a close-up shot focuses on a specific detail or emotion, while a wide-range shot captures a broader view of the scene. Each camera angle, makes each scene unique for filmmakers to tell their story and convey its meaning to the audience. Carefully selecting and combining camera angles, help directors to create best of best visual compositions, that could enhance the narrative and engage viewers more deeply. Moreover, camera angles can also be used to establish relationships. Whether it could be characters or objects. It grabs the audience attention to the story and make them understand things going on-screen very keenly. In a closure, camera angles are powerful tool in the filmmakers toolkit, which allows him to craft excellent storytelling experiences. By understanding role of camera angles and mastering use of it, filmmakers can develop work and create films of different genres which could leave long lasting impact on audience. ‘ So next time, you watch a movie, pay attention to the camera angles, they might just reveal more about the story then you imagined.

The entire war of Mahabharata is replicated in Negative on the background Chroma. In Gita Panchali (Tv) series photographic processes create negative images: the chemicals involved react when exposed to light, so that during development they produce deposits of microscopic dark silver particles or colored dyes in proportion to the amount of exposure.
