        "text": "This article examines the localized nature of leisure provision and consumer taste in Britain in the first half of the twentieth century. Based on an analysis of the cinema-going habits of naval personnel and dockyard workers and their families in the naval town of Portsmouth, this article reveals how closely consumers’ tastes were predicated on their social and cultural identities. By mapping film booking patterns at one cinema, this article reveals how cinema managers chose to book films which responded directly to the tastes of their patrons. The article concludes that the film preferences of this community were shaped by their close connections with naval life.\n\n6 See Davies, A., Leisure, Gender and Poverty. Working-Class Culture in Salford and Manchester: 1900–1939 (Milton Keynes, 1992)Google Scholar; McKibbin, R., Classes and Cultures, England 1918–1951 (Oxford, 1998)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Langhamer, C., Women's Leisure in England, 1920–1960 (Manchester, 2000)Google Scholar; Beaven, B., Leisure, Citizenship and Working-Class Men in Britain, 1850–1945 (Manchester, 2005)Google Scholar; Todd, S., Young Women, Work and Family in England 1918–1930 (Oxford, 2005)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; James, R., Popular Culture and Working-Class Taste in Britain, 1930–39: A Round of Cheap Diversions? (Manchester, 2010)CrossRefGoogle Scholar. More recently, historians have begun assessing cinema-going habits in particular regions. Much of this research has concentrated on Portsmouth, due to the richness of the evidence available for the town. See, for example, Poole, J., ‘British cinema attendance in wartime: audience preference at the Majestic, Macclesfield, 1939–1946’, Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, 7 (1987), 15–34CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Harper, S., ‘A lower middle-class taste-community in the 1930s: admission figures at the Regent Cinema, Portsmouth, UK’, ibid., 24 (2004), 565–87Google Scholar; Harper, S., ‘Fragmentation and crisis: 1940s admissions figures at the Regent Cinema, Portsmouth, UK’, ibid., 26 (2006), 361–94Google Scholar; , J., ‘Cinemagoing in Portsmouth’, Cinema Journal, 46 (2006), 52–84CrossRefGoogle Scholar; James, R., ‘“A very profitable enterprise”: South Wales Miners’ Institute cinemas in the 1930s’, Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, 27 (2007), 27–61CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n8 Council minutes 1914–51, held in Local History Department, Central Library, Portsmouth. The exact date of the cinema's closure cannot be ascertained. The pages in the council minutes listing the cinemas operating in the town are missing in 1948; the cinema is not listed thereafter. Newspaper advertisements also stop in Oct. 1948. However, the cinema is listed in Kineweekly Year Book until 1952.\n\n10 According to the council minutes, the cinema was owned and managed by Raymond Stross in 1945, Frederick Ernest in 1946 and John Willis, Robert Elkin and William Potter in 1947. In 1948, William Ling is recorded as owning and managing the cinema. Minutes of the Corporation Watch Committee Book, 1945–48. Kineweekly Year Book records H.P.E. Mears as manager in 1945, F.E. Murkin in 1947 and A.G. and K.M. Spiers from 1948 to 1951. Kineweekly Year Book, 1945–51. Kelly's Directory records Raymond Stross as proprietor in 1946. The argument regarding the frequent changes of management stands, however.\n\n19 In 1940, prices ranged from 5d to 1s 3d; in 1947, F.E. Murkin charged from 1s to 2s 3d; in 1948, A.G. and K.M. Spiers charged from 1s to 1s 3d. They remained the same until the cinema closed. Ibid., 1940, 555; 1947, 344; 1948, 357, 1949, 371; 1950, 375; 1951, 365.\n\n27 This pattern continued post-1945, but more ‘big’ productions were shown in the late 1940s. This was probably due to the effects of the ad valorem fiasco of 1947, which forced exhibitors to show whatever films they could obtain. Harper, ‘Fragmentation and crisis’, 362.\n\n28 A limited number of advertisements were placed in 1924, so the ratio of British to American films may have differed from that adduced by the evidence. Of those advertised, half were British.\n\n41 Robert Sklar argues that contemporary film-makers recognized the need to present social change, but in a manner that would not ‘disturb the inherited moral order’. Sklar, R., Movie-Made America: A Cultural History of American Movies (New York, 1994), 95Google Scholar. See also essays in Fischer (ed.), American Cinema of the 1920s, for a yearly analysis of film production.\n\n50 According to Sklar, there was a significant increase in the production of crime and gangster films in America during the early 1930s. The rise in bookings for this type of drama at the Queens undoubtedly reflects this increase. Sklar, Movie-Made America, 176–81."
