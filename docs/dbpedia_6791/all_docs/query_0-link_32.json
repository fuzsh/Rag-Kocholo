Figures 1-7\n\nTHE NEW DRAMA\n\nTOP\n\nThere have been two periods of great drama in British history, the first in the Renaissance, Shakespeares age, and the second, confusingly called the Renaissance of the British Drama, featuring George Bernard Shaw and the New Drama.1It is this renaissance of the modern period, roughly occupying the years 1890 to 1950, that is the subject of this book.\n\nWilliam Archer (1856-1924), the most influential drama critic of the New Drama movement and translator of Ibsen, thought of the ages between the Puritans closing of the theaters in 1642 and the creation of the New Drama in the 1890s as the dark ages of the drama, with only a few glimmerings of light along the wayCongreve, Wycherly, Gold­smith, Sheridan, Robertsonto give hope for the future. Throughout The Old Drama and the New (1923), Archer used metaphors of light and dark or wasteland metaphors to contrast the New Drama with the Old (the whole century from about 1720 to 1820 was a dreary desert broken by a single oasisthe comedies of Goldsmith and Sheridan), metaphors he applies to most of nineteenth-century drama for its pleasure-seeking addiction to melodrama, low comedy, and other escapist fare.2\n\nTo read the diatribes against the nineteenth-century theater by certain critics and dramatists of the 1890s is to be reminded that nothing really changes in popular culture. The most debased of our own film and TV fare is a lineal descendant of nineteenth-century popular theater, except that the ante on thrills and laffs has been considerably upped, making the Victorian plays complained about by Archer seem tasteful and thoughtful. Yet theres no doubt that this escapist, often simplistically moralizing drama of the nineteenth-century popular theater was of a decided mediocrity, not only because it catered to the low tastes of a very undereducated and rather uncouth audience but because it was virtually without literary value. This can partly be attributed to the fact that without copyright laws protecting them playwrights had gotten out of the habit of publishing their plays (except as prompt books) and thus of thinking of them as literature, subject to criticism. Archers insistence on literary quality had much to do with the return of substance to British drama, as well as a return of improved technique. Perhaps the most significant feature of this period is that in it the literary drama overtook the old Theatrical Theater, making necessary a critical approach fundamentally literary.\n\nBut Archers partisan condemnation of nineteenth-century drama must be qualified in several ways. First, though the nineteenth century was largely a desert for the drama, it was the scene of a theatrical harvest, during which the theater as an institution grew and flourished in the hands of great actors and actor-managers, and all the arts and crafts of the theater were refined. Second, though the drama of the times was mostly mediocre as literature, much of it was first-rate as theater, causing Britains growing middle class to flock to it for amusement, thus sparking its physical and institutional developmentaround fifty theaters were built in London alone between 18oo and 1890. Its true that those seeking greatness in the nineteenth-century theater found it mostly in the acting and staging, and in revivals of Shakespeare and other classics, not in the contemporary drama; but at least they found it. And those primarily seeking entertainment were seldom disappointed. The thousand or so playwrights who wrote between Shakespeare and Shaw, though now mostly forgotten, could at least be generally counted on to amuse the populace according to the tastes of the times, and occasionally even to elevate those tastes slightly. Another consideration is that the theatricalism, abstraction, and musical nature of much nineteenth-century drama has been partially vindicated by the dramatic practices of twentieth-century drama, though of course the difference is that the best twentieth-century drama made these properties or qualities serve higher purposes. These qualifications aside, Archers characterization of over two centuries of theater as desert or dark age had much validity, considering the standard set by Shakespeare, and interested Victorians agreed that a dramatic revival was in order. The alternative was to follow Matthew Arnolds example in abandoning the theater out of disgust.\n\nBut which exactly needed to be revivedthe drama or society? The word renaissance connotes the rebirth of a people and thus might be thought too strong a term if applied only to the drama. Most Victorians did not think of their age as especially benighted, at least nothing a little reform and technological and business progress couldnt take care of. It may have been a dark age of the drama, but in the novel and poetry and the other arts, and certainly in the sciences and in business and industry, most Victorians considered theirs a progressive, enlightened age. So it was hard to convince an otherwise forward-looking peopleindustrializers of a world empire and avid users of railroads, telegraphy, electricity, photography, and telephonesthat they were backward in much else besides this very specialized and seemingly unimportant area known as the drama.\n\nBut George Bernard Shaw, this eras chief playwright, argued and demonstrated that, technological progress notwithstanding, backwardness was so deeply entrenched in the moral, religious, and governmental systems of the day that it was not too much to call the entire age a dark age and to play its progressiveness as an ironic joke. For Shaw, as well as Archer and many others, the word renaissance was not too ambitious for the extreme measures that were needed to breathe new life into a morally rotten society, and the drama, with its ancient roots in the life-worshipping Greek religion of Dionysius, was precisely the means needed. As an institution for the gathering of people together to commune on the issues of social health and spiritual well-being, and to plumb the mysteries of human identity in a riddling universe, employing thereby all the arts and crafts in a unifying effort, the drama was ideally designed to be the focus of culture, as it had been at its beginnings in ancient Greece. In fact, the health of a nation could be determined by how central it made its drama and how seriously it took it. For Shaw and Archer, a major diagnostic of Victorian society was its trivialization of the theater. Only in a dark age would the spiritual light that may illuminate the stage be allowed so nearly to go out.\n\nA renaissance is a period of enlightenment. The original Renaissance was awakened to the long-lost past of the Greeks and Romansits chief reality was that of ancient truth rediscovered, as, for example, the way Aristotelian principles were henceforth applied to drama. In contrast, the modern age, guided by science to be irreverent toward the past and skeptical of received truth (as the maverick Galileo had been skeptical of Aristotle), thought of itself as more concerned with present reality, especially awakening to physical reality, since it could be empirically verified. It supposed that the physical world was scientifically knowable and controllable, and that therefore the future could be commanded through the invention of new technologies and new methods. From about the middle of the nineteenth century there was a gathering insistence that art follow science in a more realistic investigation of the physical world, thereby joining the March of Progress. And so the novel followed painting, to mention two of the arts, in becoming more realistic and thus supposedly less escapist. By the 1890s the New Drama as well was identified with realism, with British experiments in realism, however timid, as early as the 1860s (T. W. Robertson). On the continent, Émile Zola had argued in 1873 that playwrights should be scientists too, realistically and tough-mindedly examining in the laboratory of the stage the physical operation of human society and human consciousness. And, from the seventies on, Henrik Ibsen, with his microscopic dissection of modern Norwegian society and individual personality, had shown how best to do it in a dramatic form. For Archer, Ibsen was the model for the future.\n\nBut the realism of an art based on illusion, as is drama, was immediately challenged, even by some of those playwrights labeled as realistsIbsen himself fused realism with symbolism and flirted with expressionism. Many artists argued that the use of nonrealistic modes of expression did not necessarily mean that art was escapist; rather, arts approach to reality could only be through illusion (i.e., spiritual reality)a play, for example, was a playing with reality. And the substitution of electric lights for gas lights in the eighties and nineties, made possible by sciences regard for physical reality, did not necessarily add to the stages spiritual illumination but actually seemed at times to obscure its presentation of spiritual reality. A sign of the times, however, was that the aggressively positivistic science of the day made people feel apologetic about using a word like spiritual, though some playwrights were less intimidated than others. And thus began a very complicated debate on the nature of dramatic reality.\n\nREALISM AND THE REACTION\n\nTOP / Table of Contents\n\nRealism as a dramatic style refers to the appearance of lifelikeness (verisimilitude) in setting, costume, dialogue, gesture, facial expression, and so on. A realistic play was to be a photographic copy of common, observable experience (in practice, usually middle-class domestic experience, to accord with the reality of the rise of the bourgeoisie). The stage was to appear, not as a stage, but as a room or any actual environment; props were to be seen, not as props, but as authentic parts of a particular everyday environment. All the developing technology of the modern theaterhydraulic machinery, cycloramas, lighting boards, etc.-was brought to bear in creating the illusion of authentic environment. A proscenium arch separated the stage from the auditorium and framed the action taking place on the stage in a three-sided box set. Some theaters (such as Londons Haymarket under the Bancroftssee below) eliminated the apron stage in front of the proscenium altogether and bordered the proscenium so that the effect was that of looking at a framed picture. The prosceniums fourth wall, through which the audience peered, as Peeping Toms might look into bedroom windows, was invisible by convention.\n\nAs for the realistic play, no authorial intrusion was allowed, and neither audience nor actors were acknowledged for what they were. The idea was to achieve the illusion of re-created life, in its immediacy and dense actuality. At its best (Ibsen and Chekhov) it did indeed give the feeling that one was peering through an open window into someones house and, unobserved, overhearing private conversation. Real­ism at its best was very persuasive in making audiences believe that the illusion they were seeing was not an illusion. But of course that simply made realism the most outrageous of all of the theaters pretensesone had to make-believe that one was not in a theater and not looking at actors acting on a stage. But it must have been a relief to those tired of plays that pointed the moral, and owing to its relative subtlety, riveting to those wishing to know what it all meant. The supposed neutrality or scientific objectivity of the author, the indirectness of the characterization, and the relative inconclusiveness of the action forced the viewer to pay close attention to the details in order to form judgments, with much of the meaning of such plays occurring in the subtext and accumulating gradually, almost imperceptibly, detail by detail.\n\nRealism at first was associated with social drama, for its immediate goal was to display accurately and authentically the social environment and behavior of the day. But this association gave realism a reputation for being superficial, for getting lost in relatively unimportant surface detail at the expense of portraying the more important soul of things. That was why Ibsen resisted realism for so long, preferring to go on writing obsolete heroic drama, often in verse, rather than stoop to mere photography. But then it dawned on this genius that the surface of life could be used in a poetic, symbolic way, just as great photographers were learning that the camera need not just copy lifes exterior but could interpret and poetically evoke the hidden depths as well. Ibsen converted to realism when he found that he could use the surface to suggest the deeps and so invented what came to be called psychological realism, in which the picturing of society is employed to suggest the underlying soul or psyche. And insofar as his plays penetrated mundane appearances, reaching to the significance of things, they were examples of philosophical realism as well, and of critical realism insofar as they saw through the humbug of the day. It was a neat trick, this elevating of what seemed a trivial and mundane art into a high art, but so many missed the trick that Ibsen was often erroneously dismissed as a mere social realist, thus leading other dramatists to become overtly nonrealistic in their expression of the psychological deeps and intellectual heights in order to separate themselves from what was thought a second-rate art.\n\nThe point to be underscored is that as human reality is multidimensional, the word realism should not have been limited to the imitation of our most superficial reality. This early mistake in terminology plagues us like an original sin, accounting for the quotation marks around realism and nonrealism to this point, to signify that the standard notions of these terms have created a false distinction, for nonrealistic plays are no less capable of showing us reality than are realistic plays, and in fact the reality conveyed by nonrealistic plays may be more significant. Theater departments often wisely use the alternate terms representational and presentational, but English departments, caught in the toils of literary history, seem to be stuck with the confusing realism and nonrealism. Having acknowledged the confusion, however, we may henceforth drop the annoying quotation marks if we keep constantly in mind that realism and nonrealism are misnomers.\n\nAnother, related confusion in terminology might just as well be mentioned herethat over the term naturalism, which is used in at least three different ways. Naturalism may refer to nothing more than the natural-looking or natural-sounding quality of a play. Chekhovs plays are often cited as naturalistic in this sense, as his characters create the impression that they are as disorganized, spontaneous, and inarticulate as life outside of art frequently is. Shaws plays are not naturalistic in this sense, for his characters are articulate well beyond what is considered natural. In acting, Gerald du Maurier is particularly credited with developing the most naturalistic style, which consisted mainly of giving the appearance of not acting, a style Shaw had little use for. This sort of naturalism, as a kind of hyperrealism, is just as often referred to as realism pure and simple, the critics being hopelessly inconsistent.\n\nNaturalism (sometimes capitalized in this sense) may also refer to a particular philosophy of life and/or to a particular literary-dramatic embodiment of that philosophy. Naturalism as a philosophy refers to the Social Darwinist idea that human beings are purely the product of heredity and environment, utterly determined in their behavior by these shaping factors of the natural world. This philosophy may be embodied in any kind of play, realistic or nonrealistic; and a play may have characters in it who express a naturalistic view without the play itself being totally, or at all, supportive of naturalism as a philosophy. Literary naturalism refers to works that attempt to embody a naturalistic philosophy in a very specific form, in which realistically portrayed characters are obviously and entirely at the mercy of environment and heredity. Typically, plays of this type (Gorkys The Lower Depths, ONeills The Iceman Cometh) focus on a lower-class or primitive environment, where the iron laws of heredity and environment are most nakedly exposed in an elemental struggle for survival.\n\nThe reactions against realism and naturalism were various, some nonrealistic dramatic forms given names from the past, such as fantasia, burlesque, allegory, and extravaganza, some having names invented for them, such as symbolism and expressionism, and some seeming to fit no particular category (most of Shaws plays). Of the new forms, symbolism and expressionism most typified the modernist reaction against realism and naturalism, having in common that they were evocations or assertions of a reality beyond the ken of positivistic science. Symbolism pointed to a spiritual reality behind appearances, and expressionism projected outward an internal reality positivism overlooked.\n\nUncapitalized, symbolism merely refers to the use of some things to represent other things, as a single chair on a stage might represent all furniture, a tree might represent life, or a setting sun might represent the coming of death. Symbolism capitalized refers to the specific use of symbolism, conceived by a late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century literary movement (beginning with such poets as Mallarmé, Verlaine, and Valéry, and finding its purest dramatic expression in the plays of Maeterlinck and Yeats), to evoke a spiritual world beyond the five senses through an associational technique that connects things in the material world with their correspondences in the spiritual world. Symbolism in this sense employs symbols in the least definite of ways to suggest unseen powers and emotional realities, to evoke the esoteric affinities of the writer. Symbolism was private and subjective in that the authors system of association, the particular way he evoked the archetypes, was his own; but Symbolism overcame the implied chaos of subjectivism because the correspondences activated universal archetypes, buried in the psyche of everyone, that, when properly evoked, were capable of connecting individuals in a collective awareness.\n\nExpressionism was usually a more extreme assertion of private, subjective reality, of the sort posited by psychoanalysis, though it too might appeal to universal archetypes. Prototypical were Strindbergs A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata, peopled by bizarre, rather abstract characters involved in dreamlike action, the logic of which was emotional and associational rather than rational. Expressionism flowered in the Germany and Austria of the twenties, with the works of Oscar Kokoschka and Georg Kaiser, and spread to America (ONeills The Hairy Ape) and elsewhere. Dictionary definitions often say that expressionism distorted reality, but such distortion was only from the point of view of realism. From its own point of view, expressionism did not distort reality; rather, it projected outward what was really there in the inner mind or soul of the writer or character. Its mimesis (imitation) was of psychological or spiritual reality. Its aim was to assert the primacy of human will and imagination over external circumstance, in contradiction to deterministic naturalistic theory.\n\nRealism of the extreme purity Archer wanted is an aberration in the theater, for the long tradition of the theater, before and after that brief period of the realistic movement, has been more nonrealistic than realistic, though many of the greatest dramatists seemed to derive strength from an alloy of the two. From the Greeks to the New Drama, the stage traditionally presented reality through the device of acknowledged illusion; anything else seemed deceitful. And although the movement in nineteenth-century drama was generally from a non­realistic, or presentational, mode to a realistic, or representational, mode, the movement in twentieth-century drama to the present has been from a realistic mode not so much back to a nonrealistic mode as to a latitudinarian attitude that anything is possible in the theater and that the playwright is free to use realistic or nonrealistic modes, separately or in combination, as appropriate to the play. But this has only become clear in the last fifty years, the postmodern era. In the period of our study, 1890 to 1950, the last half was largely characterized by a reaction against realism, with the fifties and sixties capping it off with the aggressively antirealistic Theater of the Absurd. And so we come full circle.\n\nMyron Matlaw, in his Modern World Drama: An Encyclopedia, defines realism thus:\n\nREALISM is as loose a term in the drama as it is in the other arts. It refers to any attempt at reproducing verisimilitude on the stage. Since this could mean the representation of external or internal, physical or psychological or philosophicalor even political, sociological, or economic-realities, and since these may be perceived in many different ways, the term is almost meaningless. Instead of being a description of anything, it is popularly used as an evaluation, usually an approving value judgment on the truthfulness of a work.3\n\nThe term is almost meaningless, says Matlaw. How dismayed Archer and some of the New Dramatists would be to hear that this is the outcome of their struggle to force the drama to be realistic. Yet Matlaw, in throwing up the lexicographers arms at the futility of defining so slippery a word, is simply being true to the spirit of his own postmodern age, an age in which not only are the wisest scientists considerably less positive, not to mention less positivistic, about reality than they used to be, but also we have considerably less confidence about languages relation to any reality outside itself. From this skeptical postmodern perspective, then, latitudinarianism seems the most becoming position to take. In any age it is difficult to empathize with the heated arguments of the past if they are no longer of concern, but our postmodern perspective makes it all the more difficult to cast ourselves back to the 1890s and feel how burning the issue of realism was to the New Dramatists (even as we grow cooler to the passionate arguments of Ionesco et al. against realism). It seemed then a life-and-death issue, at least for the drama.\n\nThe tone of William Archers plea for realism in The Old Drama and the New is very telling. He obviously felt beleaguered by those (such as Yeats) who would dismiss modern realistic drama as inferior or degenerate. Archers object was to discover in the history of drama a guiding principle of evolution, something that would help determine the essence of drama, and that would provide the basis for a rational standard of values by which the drama could be judged.4\n\nArcher begins with the assertion that the two sources from which drama arose were imitation (mimesis) and passion. By passion he signifies the exaggerated, intensifiedin brief, the lyrical or rhetorical expression of feeling.5 He cites song, dance, and heightened speech as examples, but eventually includes almost any stage business that he considers not exactly imitative of reality. Imitation is the essence of drama, and all the lyrical-rhetorical exaggerative elements, which he associates with the primitive, are impurities that need to be purged from drama and delivered to the music hail, the opera, and the ballet, the proper homes for the hysterical arts. The form that best accomplishes this purgation is modern realism, imitation triumphant. Who can doubt that the future belongs to it?6"
