        "text": "New York. 1953. High above the city, in a luxury hotel bedroom, on a hot summer's night, four of America's most famous legends—a beautiful film star, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, a renowned baseball player and an infamous senator—meet for an extraordinary confrontation.\n\nThe playwright, who was present for the Melbourne rehearsals thanks to the British Council and the Potter Foundation, wrote that \"the real question is why we make heroes for ourselves in the first place. Certainly most of them are extraordinary people, but do we enthrone them out of respect for their extraordinariness (and promptly dethrone them if they prove mere mortals after all) or is the whole business a feeble excuse for not exploring the extraordinary possibilities within ourselves?\"\n\nIn 1983 this production also toured to venues in Tasmania (26 July-6 August) and Adelaide (11-20 August). In 1984 the show was performed at the Sydney Opera House as part of the Festival of Sydney (7 January-25 February)."
