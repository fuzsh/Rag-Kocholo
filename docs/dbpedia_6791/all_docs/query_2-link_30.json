        "text": "Note: This essay was written for NYU’s Social Foundation III course.\n\nStanley Kubric’s 1964 masterpiece Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb goes down in cinema history as one of the darkest comedies about the nuclear threat. Set in the Cold War era, it speculates what could have happened if an American Air Force General with command of a nuclear fleet goes rogue and hits the launch button. Its controversial narrative had critics of its time “[compare] it to Soviet propaganda” (Schlosser), yet at the same time it is agreed upon by today’s critics, scholars, and nuclear specialists that the speculated risks were almost entirely factual — to the point where it is “basically a documentary” (Adams). On top of that, supposedly, Kubric had “researched the subject for years” and “consulted experts” while producing the screenplay (Schlosser). This paper is interested in answering the question of to what extent did Dr. Strangelove’s portrayal of the Soviet Union and the Cold War accurately and realistically reflect the themes and values of its time period? In short, the answer is that on the surface, Kubric’s portrayal of the Soviet State was an exaggeration of reality to achieve its comedic effect. Yet in reality, it only kept true to and highlighted the relevant themes of the era, merely portrayed through the unconventional medium of a satire film.\n\nThe first notable theme in the movie and also throughout the Cold War is the idea of deterrence — the hope that the fear of mutual destruction would be enough to prevent total war. As Dr. Strangelove puts it, “Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy… the fear to attack” (Dr. Strangelove 55:09). The crux of the humor in the film comes from the fact that deterrence is executed incorrectly, as the Soviet leader has a Doomsday Machine that triggers when the Americans attack, yet it was not announced to the world. The whole point of deterrence is lost if the necessary communication is not in place and consequently does not induce the fear to attack in the enemy. This is evidently not based off of actual events of the Cold War as the ending of the film reflected the opposite of how the conflict transpired in the end. Yet at the same time, it is a realistic portrayal of the mechanism behind the idea of “deterrence,” albeit a failed one, but it was what actually prevented war from happening in the sixties — the fear of a nuclear fallout and mutually assured destruction. The fear to attack yet the necessity to maintain a competitive military edge is arguably the main driving force behind all arms races in history.\n\nHowever, those who have thought through the scenarios of mutually assured destruction will soon realize the irony or paradox behind it all, and Kubric certainly has. During the cold war, imagine that America attacks first; America will be subject to Soviet retaliation and total destruction. On the other hand, if America was struck first, then deterrence would have failed already, and retaliation would leave little for America to benefit from. This is supposedly the logic that should have prevented war altogether, except it fails to account for human error, when one individual steps out of line to launch a nuclear attack. The mechanisms that were in place to retaliate automatically, which cannot be cancelled to assure the enemy with a credible threat of destruction, would then be triggered. General Turgidson confirms this in a conversation with President Muffley when he said that “I admit the human element seems to have failed us here. But the idea was to discourage the Russkies from any hope that they could knock out Washington, and yourself, sir, as part of a general sneak attack” (Dr. Strangelove 29:00). It became even more clear at the end of the film when a series of mushroom clouds fill the screens accompanying chilling music, implying the destruction of both superpowers in this ironic situation.\n\nThe second theme throughout the Cold War is only apparent in retrospective reflection of the suspenseful era, and that is the idea of misconceptions of the self and enemy. They can be driven either unintentionally through the prevalent fear of Communists or intentionally through government propaganda. Jervis’ Hypotheses on Misperception comes into play, and examples include: “thinking the enemy is more evil than it really is, not realizing one’s own faults, and not understanding how one is perceived by the other side” (Lindley). General Ripper arguably exemplifies all three, most memorably for the audience is probably his crazy conspiracy theory that the Communists have infiltrated the system and is controlling the population through the water system, adding a layer of humor to all conversations relating to water. “Do you realize that fluoridation is the most monstrously conceived and dangerous communist plot we have ever had to face?” Ripper questioned Mandrake. (Dr. Strangelove 58:00). This is just one of the many different examples of the masses’ exaggerated perception of the Soviet’s magnitude of evil. Other examples include the perceived “inferior Soviet technological capabilities” (Lindley), or realizing that conspiracy theories like these further escalate the spiral of misinformation and escalate fear among the masses. This argument can be taken to a new level if the film itself can be seen as a product of fear, and induced amplified emotions among its viewers through the upsetting thought of death and destruction by the enemy. Dr. Strangelove in and of itself could have, ironically, contributed to the misconceptions of the enemy.\n\nMisconceptions also easily lead to paranoia. This becomes increasingly problematic when it is not just civilians, but also politicians and policymakers who fall into this trap. Surprisingly, out of all the highly caricatured portrayal of the American and Soviet leaders, the paranoia exhibited by the War Room in Dr. Strangelove was not among the exaggerations. This was not helped by the fact that children at school had to undergo nuclear attack drills, which made the threat of war appear much more imminent and real. To further the paranoia, for obvious reasons, civilians are not briefed on the latest military intelligence. This means that the masses will only find out there is a nuclear attack just moments before it strikes, when the evacuation or process begins. This leaves a lot of room for speculation and even the smallest sign that could be relevant can potentially trigger paranoia. A real life example of this paranoia influencing politics is Senator McCarthy’s Communist “witch-hunt” of the 1950s, which followed his claim that he had “a list of known Communists still working in the Department of State” and launched a series of unconstitutional “investigations into alleged subversion and espionage.” These allegations were later proven to be hoaxes (Senate.gov). The reason that a figure like McCarthy who built his platform on unproven claims and capitalized off of people’s fear can thrive in the political arena only happens because of paranoia, which leads to a tendency to behave irrationally for self-preservation. Out of all the different themes throughout the film, perhaps the Cold War paranoia was the most realistically portrayed in Dr. Strangelove.\n\nThe final theme in Dr. Strangelove is the undeniable portrayal of Communism or Marxism in the film and where it comes in to contradict traditional American values of capitalism. It actually was not incredibly clear throughout the film, until the very end, when Mandrake had the interaction with the Coca Cola vending machine. The simplest explanations for why it had not appeared earlier on could be because Kubric wanted to avoid becoming too political, which would defeat the purpose of producing a dark comedy meant to be taken less seriously. Or, a more technical explanation could be a deliberate narrative choice to create an air of mystery around who the Soviets were and how unpredictable their actions may be, rather than ruining the mystery by dissecting it throughout the film. Regardless, this interaction between Mandrake and Colonel Guano is one of the most important dialogues throughout the film, as Mandrake needs to call the president to deliver the recall code for the bombers, yet did not have loose change for the pay-phone at 75:05:\n\nMandrake: “Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine, I want you to shoot the lock off it. There may be some change in there.”\n\nColonel Bat Guano: “That’s private property.”\n\nMandrake: (exasperated) “Colonel, can you possibly imagine what is going to happen to you, your frame, outlook, way of life and everything, when they learn that you have obstructed a telephone call to the President of the United States? Can you imagine? Shoot it off! Shoot! With the gun! That’s what the bullets are for, you twit!”\n\nGuano: “Ok. I’m gonna get your money for you. But if you don’t get the President of the Unites States on that phone, you know what’s going to happen to you?”\n\nMandrake: “What?”\n\nGuano: “You’re going to have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company.”\n\nDespite an incredibly tongue-in-cheek dialogue at the peak of narrative tension in the film, this interaction reveals a clear messages that Kubric is conveying through Dr. Strangelove. This interaction first and foremost drives up the frustration within the audience as the main protagonist is so close to recalling an attack which could trigger a global nuclear fallout. Yet what obstructs Mangrove’s success is the telephone company refusing to put his call through for free, and Mangrove was just a mere quarter short to continuing his call. The seemingly insignificant loose change is perhaps a symbol of American capitalism which comes between many important decisions that were made in the country’s history, and inhibited the best decisions to be made, and Kubric perhaps wanted to call the nation’s attention to.\n\nAnother noteworthy observation is Colonel Guano’s priorities. In this case, when Mangrove is evidently the more senior officer in the chain of command and is integral to preventing a nuclear war. The Colonel seems to have placed the importance of the Coca-Cola Company above that of the president, and calls into question who actually runs the country. The Colonel appears to be less afraid of answering to the President and being responsible for a nuclear fallout, than having to antagonize western and capitalist ideas of private property, with the looming fear of Coca Cola finding the two guilty of vandalism or theft. This critique of capitalism can be seen as a Marxist perspective on the negative effects of Western capitalism.\n\nThe theme of Marxism, just like the previous theme of paranoia, perhaps also has two layers to it — one concerning the Cold War, and another concerning the film itself. The Coca Cola Company reference was actually a product placement directed by the company itself (Lincoln et al.). This meant that it was not just how the war transpired that was influenced by the Coca Cola Company, but also, even how the film developed. Perhaps such a blatantly obvious instance of product placement is a deliberate artistic decision of Kubrick’s, as there are many more subtle ways to include Coca Cola Company in less significant scenes to the film. Yet, in the film, Kubric integrated this product placement, as subtle as a tip-toeing elephant, into the climax of the film. This iconic piece of dialogue was far from trivial — it defined how the film and the war would progress.\n\nIn summary, Kubrick’s iconic film Dr. Strangelove defined an era, and it was by no means a simple film. In relation to history, Marxism versus Capitalism, and the Soviet Union and the Cold War, the film tackled important and relevant themes. But the moment Kubrick decided the film was to be a dark humor satire about the war, the resulting film became complicated as a historian’s source. Despite telling the tale of an outrageously fictional event and a majority of the film is evidently an exaggerated caricature of American and Soviet politics, it was used to bring to light relevant questions, reflect on concrete themes, and highlight realistic values that played out in the Cold War era. In that sense, it is incorrect to say that the film painted an unrealistic and inaccurate picture of its time, as Kubric did not intend for the film to be seen as-is. Simply conveyed through an unconventional manner, Dr. Strangelove was in fact as realistic as a satire can get. It is a film with conflicting identities: simultaneously intended to be taken lightly and seriously, and obnoxiously aware of its own satire."
