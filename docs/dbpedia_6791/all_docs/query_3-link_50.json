        "text": "In his groundbreaking novels “The Book of Laughter and Forgetting” (1980) and “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” (1984), the Czech-born Milan Kundera wrote about his country under the shadow of the Soviet Union, reinventing the form of the novel while examining the osmosis between the personal and the political there, and the subversive roles that humor and irreverence can play in a totalitarian state.\n\nDuring that time, he recalled in a 1980 interview, a sense of humor was a sign that a person could be trusted. He added, however, that laughter came in different forms: the laughter of genuine joy versus the laughter of “angel-fanatics,” who are so certain of their own worldview that they are “ready to hang anyone not sharing their joy”; the laughter that recognizes the Kafkaesque absurdities of life (particularly in an authoritarian regime) versus the sort of nihilistic laughter “which proclaims that everything has become meaningless.”\n\nIn “The Festival of Insignificance,” his flimsy new novella about a group of friends in Paris, Mr. Kundera — who has been living in France, “his second homeland,” since 1975 — returns to many of these same themes. But instead of a profound meditation on political and psychological freedom, he has produced an extremely slight musing on people’s proclivities for pranks, lies and perverse choices — like a waiter pretending to be from Pakistan and babbling in his own made-up language; a man pretending to have cancer when he is perfectly healthy (in a section titled “The Secret Charm of a Grave Illness”); and women taking up with a boring man precisely because he is boring and makes such banal conversation.\n\nIn fact, this novella (which was written in French) not only takes place in Paris but also reflects a Parisian salonlike fascination with tongue-in-cheek amusements and poses — as opposed to the Central European outlook evinced by the author’s early books. Those works were concerned not with the intellectual games of jaded Western sophisticates but with the struggles of a small country and ordinary people to hold onto a sense of independence in the face of tyranny.\n\nJokes in Mr. Kundera’s early books signified an unwillingness to cave to officialdom and ideological certainty. Jokes in “Festival” are not about defiance, and they’re not about an innocent joy in the magic of play. Rather, they fall into the category of nihilistic hoaxes or the tired efforts of would-be artists to amuse themselves.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
