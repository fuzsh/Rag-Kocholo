        "text": "Strolling through downtown Palm Springs we saw the Walk of Stars which honours nearly 500 people who have lived in the Palm Springs area and have gained recognition for their accomplishments in various fields.\n\nI stopped to look at the star for Mary Pickford, the Hollywood silent film actress since I had done some research on her in the past for a writing project and I knew she was a Canadian.\n\nMary was born Gladys Marie Smith in Toronto where she first appeared on the stage. As a young girl she toured the United States with her mother and siblings putting on vaudeville shows. Her name was changed to Mary Pickford by the producer of the first Broadway play in which she landed a role.\n\nKnown as America’s Sweetheart she would go on to star in more than 200 films.\n\nShe also became a film producer and director.\n\nMary was the co-founder of the film company United Artists along with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her husband actor Douglas Fairbanks.\n\nSadly Mary suffered from depression after the introduction of ‘talkies’ ended her silent film career and Douglas Fairbanks left her for another woman.\n\nThe deaths of her mother and two siblings within five years led to her becoming an alcoholic, something that had killed her own father. She died a relative recluse in 1979.\n\nIt was important to her to die ‘a Canadian’ so she had her Canadian passport renewed near the end of her life.\n\nMary Pickford owned a villa in Palm Springs and it is now available for rent for around $2000 a night.\n\nThere is also a theatre in Palm Springs named after Mary Pickford which has fourteen screens and shows current films.\n\nOther posts………….\n\nWay Ahead of Their Time\n\nThe Canadian Woman Who Painted The United Nations"
