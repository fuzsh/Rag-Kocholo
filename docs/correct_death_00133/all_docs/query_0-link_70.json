It is one of the oldest cemeteries in Los Angeles, California and is located at 6000 Santa Monica Boulevard in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles. It was founded in 1899 as Hollywood Cemetery, and later known as Hollywood Memorial Park until 1998 when it was given its current name. The studios of Paramount Pictures are located at the south end of the same block, on 40 acres (16 ha) that were once part of the cemetery which held no interments. Individuals interred in the cemetery include many prominent people from the entertainment industry, as well as people who played vital roles in shaping Los Angeles.
