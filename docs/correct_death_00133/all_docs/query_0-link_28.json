        "text": "Film Career\n\nPickford began working as an extra in films at D.W. Griffith’s Biograph Studio in 1909. By 1913 she was working exclusively in motion pictures, and she soon became a star. She was beloved by millions of fans for playing sweet innocents in such films as Hearts Adrift (1914), Tess of the Storm Country (1914), Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917), and Johanna Enlists (1918).\n\nAn enormously popular actress, Pickford negotiated high salaries for herself and became one of the richest women in the United States. For several years she worked for Adolph Zukor’s Famous Players Company–Paramount, which created the production company Mary Pickford Studios for her.\n\nIn 1919 Pickford took the lead in founding the United Artists Corporation with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. United Artists was the first major film production and distribution company to be controlled by artists rather than businessmen. The following year she married Fairbanks, whom she divorced in 1936. (She had earlier married and divorced actor Owen Moore.)\n\nWith United, Pickford continued to be a superstar, appearing in Pollyanna (1920), Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921), Rosita (1923), and Little Annie Rooney (1925). Her first talking film, Coquette (1929), brought her an Academy Award for best actress.\n\nPickford retired from the screen after making Secrets (1933), her 194th film. Thereafter she devoted herself to United Artists, for which she produced several films. She also became first vice president of the company in 1935. In 1937 Pickford married actor Charles “Buddy” Rogers, with whom she had starred in My Best Girl (1927). She died on May 29, 1979, in Santa Monica, California."
