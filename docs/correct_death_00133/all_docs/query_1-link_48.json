        "text": "Actress Mary Pickford, wildly famous during the silent era, developed a pattern early in her career.\n\nThe pattern first became evident at the Biograph studio in 1909, when a 17-year-old Pickford worked with director D.W. Griffith, pushing the boundaries and conventions of film.\n\nEven though Pickford was fast gaining fame and recognition at Biograph – and the pay to go with it – she was starting to get Restless.\n\n“[F]or the next twenty-four years,” writes biographer Robert Windeler, “whenever Mary Pickford got restless, the entire movie industry was likely to feel the repercussions.”¹\n\nPickford was ambitious, No Doubt About It. She knew her worth and how to negotiate it. Samuel Goldwyn once joked, “It took longer to make Mary’s contracts than it did to make her pictures.”2\n\nNevertheless, Pickford was a hard worker, and she knew how to Read a movie audience.\n\n“She knew everything there was to know about making a movie,” said Charles Rosher, Pickford’s favourite cameraman. “She could do everything, she was a walking motion picture company.”3\n\nIt seems a foregone conclusion, then, looking at her life with 20/20 Hindsight, that she would always become a Studio Boss. In 1919, together with Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, and director Griffith, Pickford co-founded the independent studio, United Artists.\n\nBiographer Windeler, author of Mary Pickford: Sweetheart of the World, is almost rapturous in his appraisal of Pickford’s contribution to film. “Since 1919 she had set standards for the entire film industry, and made at least a million dollars a year as an actor-producer doing it.”4\n\nPickford was associated with United Artists for decades, retaining her share of ownership until the 1950s.\n\nBut her energy and ambition could not last forever. In 1965, a tired Mary Pickford went to bed with the intention of never leaving it.\n\n“[S]he had worked hard all her life since she was five,” explains Windeler, who interviewed Pickford in the early 1970s. “She would not get up out of bed or leave the house again, except to go to the hospital.”5\n\nThe documentary, Mary Pickford: The Muse of the Movies (2008), lists the ways in which Pickford was a Groundbreaker:\n\nFirst actor whose name appeared on a marquee. Paramount boss, Adolf Zukor, added the words “America’s Sweetheart”.*\n\nFirst actress to make $1 million.\n\nAt one time, she was the most famous woman in the world.\n\nThe first actress to fly in an airplane on film (1915’s Mistress Nell).\n\nIn 1928, she had her famous curls cut off, and the news landed on the front page of the New York Times.6\n\nNot only was she an actress, she was a writer, director, producer.\n\nShe and her then-husband, Douglas Fairbanks, are considered the first international Movie Stars.\n\nThe home that she and Fairbanks remodeled, Pickfair, was The Place To Be in the 1920s. It was the first private home in Los Angeles to have an in-ground swimming pool.7\n\nBut this is only telling part of the story. Being a Smart businesswoman, in itself, isn’t entirely what made Pickford a sensation.\n\nTo understand that, you have to see her on screen.\n\nWhen Pickford reigned supreme, says Windeler, many of her films portrayed an era for which nostalgic Americans had a yearning: “a rural small-town America of the late nineteenth century, already missed by an America growing up and moving too fast.”8\n\nPickford, it could be argued, was in the Right Place at the Right Time. She was born in Toronto in 1892, and moved to New York with her family not long after her father’s death. She began acting on stage as a child in Toronto, New York, and on tours in the U.S.\n\nEven as a kid, Pickford felt the burden of supporting her family, something that would drive her throughout her life. She later said that portraying young girls on screen gave her the opportunity to reclaim the little girl she never was.9\n\nEven though she was trained on the stage, her acting is natural and feels modern in its restraint. She knew how to speak to us through the camera.\n\nAlso: Her charisma elicits our sympathies. She’s amusing, defiant, moving, sarcastic, determined.\n\nPickford died in 1979 from a cerebral hemorrhage. Her funeral, like much of her personal life, was a Private Affair. She is now interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, CA.\n\nThankfully, she leaves behind the treasured filmography of a smart, funny, and fiercely restless filmmaker.\n\nThis is a contribution to THE THIRD MARATHON STARS Blogathon hosted by Musings of a Classic Film Addict, In the Good Old Days of Classic Hollywood, The Wonderful World of Cinema.\n\nFilms Watched for this Blogathon:\n\nRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917)\n\nPoor Little Rich Girl (1917)\n\nThe Hoodlum (1919)\n\nPollyanna (1920)\n\nMary Pickford: Muse of the Movies (2008)\n\nSources and Notes"
