        "text": "Termites and Pia Zadora raze the former home of the rich and famous. Pickfair, the legendary estate of Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, has been razed to clear space for a small palace for actress Pia Zadora and her husband.\n\nOnce upon a time, Pickfair was home to distinguished guests from the world over, among them Albert Einstein, Charlie Chaplin, the king of Spain and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.\n\nNow all that remains of the estate is a guest wing built in the 1930s and the remnants of Pickfair's living room.\n\nPickfair, which grew from a $3,000 stable in 1911 to become a vast, green-gabled melange of American Colonial styles, at one time was called the nation's second-most famous residence _ after the White House.\n\nBut contractors said it couldn't be saved. In essence, time had eaten away at the timbers of Pickfair.\n\nThe realities of termites and dry rot did little to soothe the wave of nostalgia some felt upon hearing of the building's demise.\n\nOne frequent visitor was Douglas Fairbanks Jr., who remembers moonlight swims in the kidney-shaped pool.\n\n\"I regret it very much,\" he said in a telephone interview from New York. \"I wonder, if they were going to demolish it, why they bought it in the first place?\"\n\nPhyllis Lerner, president of the Beverly Hills Historical Society, said: \"I've got a funny feeling about it, because it's no longer Pickfair to me. It really wasn't a pretty house, but my God, the guest list!\"\n\nAn invitation to Pickfair meant you had arrived. Rudolph Valentino and Gloria Swanson were just two names on a startling guest list: Maurice Chevalier, Anna Pavlova, Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Jack Dempsey, Amelia Earhart, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry Ford, Babe Ruth, Lillian Gish and H. G. Wells.\n\nPickford was 86 when she died in 1979. Her marriage to Fairbanks had ended in 1934 and she hadn't made a movie in nearly 50 years. But the mystique of Pickfair lingered on until the end.\n\nHer third husband, actor Buddy Rogers, several times called reporters to the mansion to dispel rumors that Pickford, who became reclusive in the mid-1960s, was locked up. She spoke from an upstairs room, using a tape-recorded message or telephone.\n\nZadora and her millionaire husband, Meshulam Riklis, bought the estate from Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss for $6.68-million in 1988. Zadora appeared in the films Lonely Lady and Butterfly, two flops in the early '80s, but has since launched a successful career singing songs from the '40s and '50s. Her husband is head of Riklis Family Corp., which was No. 47 on Forbes magazine's 1989 list of top 400 privately owned companies.\n\nThe couple reportedly plans to spend as much as another $5-million to build their tile-roofed palazzo, adding 2,754 square feet to the 13,421 square feet in the original floor plan.\n\nRemnants of the original Pickfair living room are to be incorporated into the new mansion as a tribute to the glories of the past, said Rob Myers, the couple's general contractor.\n\n\"Once we got into it, it was like cancer,\" Myers said of the termites and rot that permeated the original woodwork. Workers tied new lumber to the crumbling beams of the old living room earlier this week.\n\n\"We kept cutting away at the bad stuff, trying to get at the good stuff until we got down to the foundation,\" Myers said. \"And the foundation didn't have any steel in it, so we couldn't build on that and we had to keep going.\"\n\nPickford, known as \"America's Sweetheart,\" was loved for her roles in Pollyana, Tess of the Storm Country and Little Annie Rooney. Fairbanks was the swashbuckling hero of Zorro, The Thief of Bagdad and Robin Hood.\n\nThe Beverly Hills Historical Society raised no objections when the city granted permits for a new structure to be built at the site on Pickfair Way.\n\nWinston Millet, former president of the society, is one who feels no regret at Pickfair's razing. He noted that even the name was thought up by a studio public relations worker.\n\n_ Information from the Associated Press was used in this report."
