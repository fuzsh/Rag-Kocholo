        "text": "Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks posing for a publicity shot in front of their new studio in 1922\n\nMovie stars and executives of United Artist Corporation. Ca. Nov. 10, 1930. L-R: Al Jolson, Mary Pickford, Ronald Colman, Gloria Swanson, Douglas Fairbanks, Joseph Schenck (Pres,. And Chrm.), Charlie Chaplin, Samuel Goldwyn, Eddie Cantor\n\nPickford Fairbanks Studio, 1923 Santa Monica, with Film sets for the Thief of Bagdad\n\nA rare employee badge circa 1920’s from United Artists\n\nThe front enterance to United Artists on Formosa Ave.\n\nThe Mill and Carpenter shop at United Artist Studios. These skilled craftsman would build Greek Palaces, Arabian Mosques to French Villages.\n\nLook what those carpenters built! Filming taking place on the backlot for Thief of Bagdad starring Douglas Fairbanks.\n\nIn April 12, 1955, Samuel Goldwyn takes over the lot\n\nAfter six years of anonymity, the Samuel Goldwyn Studios got its name back today when the veteran producer replaced the huge sign over the main gate. This action followed Goldwyn’s successful bid of $1,920,000 in Superior Court yesterday, winning complete ownership of the studio, including Mary Pickford’s former interest. Prior to 1949, Goldwyn occupied the studio on lease, during which time the sign graced the top of the main gate. When the lease expired in that year, it marked the start of the litigation between Goldwyn and Miss Pickford, which was finally reolved. Goldwyn is at right watching the progress. April 21, 1955.\n\nA nice shot of the front gate enterance\n\nSamuel Goldwyn Studios taken June 1, 1941\n\nLook at those cars!\n\nInterior shot of the lot then and now.\n\nFont enterance then and now.\n\nMay 6, 1974 A fire destroyed two sound stages at the Samuel Goldwyn Studios and caused major darnage in the executive, offices of producers and writers. The fire was under control after almost three hours at the studio, home lotof several independent motion picture and television producers.\n\nQ.M- Quin Martin casting foreground, became “Love Boat.” The fire broke out at a sound stage during the taping of a children’s show. The set was a ‐Cave used in the show “Sigmund and the Sea Monsters,” a Sid” and Marty Krofft production for television. About 60 studio workers and cast members were on the set when, according to one report, sparks from a stage light ignited Combustible material.\n\nNothing like “Top Flight Detective Actors” to solve a mystery.\n\nBuddy Ebsen or Barnaby Jones, this hit T.V series was affected by yet another studio fire. I miss T.V Guides, the Guides were better than shows on T.V today. “I’ll just read thank you, you keep the remote.” Looks like Barnaby is looking for clues of the fire’s origin…\n\nOpened its doors in 1939, right across the street from Goldwyn Studios. Frequent visitors include Frank Sinatra, Humphrey Bogart, and Ava Gardner, Keenan Wynn, Even Elvis Presley and James Dean popped in. John Wayne passed out in one of the Red Leather Booths only to wake up and cook himself breakfast in their kitchen. This was the go to joint when working ‘The Lot.”\n\nFormosa Cafe-John Wayne once passed out here. When he woke up “after cafe closing” he made himself eggs in the kitchen. Elvis frequented here and practically everybody that worked at U/A, Goldwyn, Warner Hollywood etc. You could stumble back to work it was so close.\n\nThanks for reading!

Phantom of the Backlots Presents: Uninvited Visitor https://a.co/d/eRTFLsy\n\nBack in 1982, I begin my tale…\n\nHaving worked for MGM Film Labs until they officially went out of business, I was in need of a job. I applied with all the studios and was accepted in an apprenticeship program for IBEW Studio Electricians. Problem was-no openings were available. As time marched on- I also applied to all Local Law Enforcement Agencies, Fire Departments and Utility Companies.\n\nLo and behold, The Southern California Gas Company offered me a solid package I accepted. I was there physically, but mentally I wanted to start my apprenticeship, sooner not later. Ironically, I was assigned to Hollywood Base, located off Formosa Street, across from-at the time-Warner Brothers Hollywood Lot, better the former Goldwyn Studios.\n\nI chose “Distribution,” rather than “Customer Service,” for training I could use elsewhere, like at the studios. I received a commercial drivers license first, driving heavy equipment to local job sites in Hollywood. We even put in a gas service for this studio on S.M Blvd. Casting for the “LoveBoat” was a thing to behold as gals lined up, scantly clad, hoping to break in to Hollywood Television.\n\nBring on the Cattle Calls…\n\nEvery morning it seemed, a line would formCasting for the “LoveBoat”cause was a thing to behold as gals lined up, scantly clad, hoping to break in to Hollywood Television and Film. My Pal Jimmy and I walked this same studio perimeter in the 70’s, looking for a way in. But, while doing our surveillance, we became disengaged because they had “No Backlots.” The studio was worthless for exterior set exploration. We want “Sets!”\n\nAs we prepared for work, across the street from showbiz, we would slowly exit down Formosa looking at all the “pretty girls.” This successful series followed Fantasy Island on Saturday nights.We jokingly casted “our own selections” from the cab of our own fleet. Later in the afternoon, we would return dirty and grungy from jackhammering pavement, digging in dirt, and welding on live gas mains. Manly Man stuff that I figured would help me get the dream job I desired ..\n\nMy ticket to showbiz\n\nWell not glamorous- but hard work usually always pays off. In the studios, my duties would involve four unions. Teamsters to drive equipment to and from, Metal Shop for pipe work. Electrical when generators are used, and Laborers for all things physical. 4 studio unions would be involved on things we did daily as one union.\n\nMy Escape\n\nAn add popped up in the Newspaper, remember those? Jobs offered to drive Universal Studio Glamour Trams. Not wishing to wait out for my electrical apprenticeship, I applied and was rewarded with a studio job I could only have dreamed of -driving trams the length of a boat.\n\nA Love Boat …on wheels"
