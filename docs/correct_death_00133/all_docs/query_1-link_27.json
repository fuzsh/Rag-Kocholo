        "text": "Full Name: Gladys Louise Smith\n\nProfession: Actress\n\nBiography: Mary Pickford, known in the 1910s and 1920s as \"Queen of the Movies,\" helped shape the early American film industry. She was a prominent actress, aside from her influence as co-founder of Pickfordâ€“Fairbanks Studios, United Artists, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nPickford began her acting career as a child in Toronto, Canada. She later moved to the United States with her family and transitioned from stage to film. Pickford quickly became a popular actress, earning the nickname \"The Biograph Girl\" for her work with the Biograph Company.\n\nIn 1919, Pickford co-founded United Artists with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and Douglas Fairbanks. This gave her more control over her career and the films she made. She starred in many successful silent films, including \"Pollyanna\" (1920) and \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" (1921).\n\nPickford won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in \"Coquette\" (1929), her first talkie. Her career declined, however, with the rise of sound films. She retired from acting in 1933 but continued to produce films and work as a vice-president of United Artists.\n\nThroughout her life, Pickford was involved in various business ventures and philanthropic efforts. She co-founded the Hollywood Studio Club and the Motion Picture Relief Fund to support those in the film industry. Pickford was married three times and adopted two children with her third husband, Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers.\n\nPickford's contributions were recognized with an Academy Honorary Award in 1976.\n\nBorn: April 8, 1892\n\nBirthplace: Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nGeneration: Lost Generation\n\nStar Sign: Aries"
