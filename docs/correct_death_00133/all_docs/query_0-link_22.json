        "text": "(1892-1979)\n\nWho Was Mary Pickford?\n\nIn 1909, Mary Pickford appeared in 40 movies for D.W. Griffith's American Biography company. She also worked as a producer and co-founded United Artists, with Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., who would become her second husband. Pickford retired from the screen in 1933 but continued to produce. She died in 1979.\n\nEarly Life\n\nActress, producer and screenwriter Gladys Mary Smith was born on April 8, 1892, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Known as \"America’s Sweetheart,\" Mary Pickford was a legendary film actress during the age of silent pictures. She often appeared on screen in young girl roles, even when she was an adult. Pickford began performing at the age of five on the stage and was known for a time as \"Baby Gladys.\" After touring in different shows and productions for more than nine years, she went to New York to conquer Broadway. Taking the stage name, Mary Pickford, she made her Broadway debut in The Warrens of Virginia.\n\nSoon after the show’s run, Pickford got into film, working for D. W. Griffith, a director and head of American Biography Company. At the time, most films were short and she appeared in more than 40 movies in 1909. When Griffith moved his operation to California the following year, Pickford went with him. Over the years, her fame grew as well as her salary. She became an international star, beloved for her beauty and charm.\n\nCreation of United Artists\n\nSome of Pickford’s greatest films were a collaborative effort with friend and writer-director Frances Marion. Together they worked on such hits as Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917) and Poor Little Rich Girl (1917). Pickford also worked behind the scenes as a producer and founded the United Artists (UA), a film company, in 1919, with Griffith, Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., who would become her second husband. She had been married to actor Owen Moore and divorced him to be with Fairbanks.\n\nPickford and Fairbanks married in 1920, becoming one of Hollywood’s earliest super couples. Fans adored the pairing, and the couple were known to host fabulous events at their home, called Pickfair, which were attended by many of the leading figures in film.\n\nIn the 1920s, Pickford continued to score more box-office hits with Polyanna (1920) and Little Lord Fauntleroy (1922). She went on to help establish the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1927. Around this time, the film industry was changing and talking pictures were on the rise. In 1929, Pickford starred in her first talkie Coquette, which explored the dark side of a wealthy family. She won an Academy Award for her work on the film. Still she was never quite able to recreate the phenomenal success she had in silent pictures with the sound films. Her last film was 1933’s Secrets.\n\nLater Years\n\nAfter retiring from the screen, Pickford continued to be involved in filmmaking. She worked as a producer on such films as One Rainy Afternoon (1936), Susie Steps Out (1946) and Sleep, My Love (1948). She also was on the board of directors for UA for many years. She married her third husband, Charles “Buddy” Rogers, in 1937. They adopted two children and stayed together until her death.\n\nDeath\n\nIn her final years, Pickford became reclusive. She largely stayed home at Pickfair and choosing to only see a select few friends. She died on May 29, 1979, in Santa Monica, California.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Mary Pickford\n\nBirth Year: 1892\n\nBirth date: April 8, 1892\n\nBirth City: Toronto\n\nBirth Country: Canada\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Mary Pickford was a legendary silent film actress and was known as \"America’s Sweetheart.\" She was a founder of United Artists and helped establish the Academy.\n\nIndustries\n\nFilm\n\nAstrological Sign: Aries\n\nDeath Year: 1979\n\nDeath date: May 29, 1979\n\nDeath State: California\n\nDeath City: Santa Monica\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"
