        "text": "I have pondered writing this series of articles for a long time, in fact, ever since Mary Pickford ran her newspaper column, ‘Personalities I have met’ in the mid-teens. Of course, having been at Biograph from the earliest days, when motion Pictures were first being noticed, I know all of the stars that form the core of Hollywood today.\n\nYou might have wondered why we ex-Biograph and Vitagraph girls never put each other down in public. We have an unwritten agreement not to do so, and this dates back to the early days when actresses were regarded as whores having a day off. Our enemies weren’t just outside the studio, but inside as well, one being the ‘World’s Genius’, D.W. Griffith.\n\nI might just as well start, therefore, with Mary Pickford. As you know Miss Pickford (or Gladys Smith as I know her) slightly predated my time at Biograph. She always referred to me as a friend in any article she contributed to, but we are not really friends as such, nor are we staunch enemies. Since we arrived in Hollywood, we’ve kept a respectful distance from each other, and this, I suppose, has prevented us from falling out big time. I have never been invited over to Pickfair, and neither have I invited her to my house, except once for an interview. Mary always has loads of celebrities up at Pickfair, but makes sure I am never there, as I might embarrass them. Of course, my old friend Charlie (Chaplin) is now an almost permanent fixture at Pickfair, and if I hear the Pickfords (Fairbanks’s) are having Albert Einstein, The Duke of Windsor, or Lord Mountbatten around, I’ll bawl Charlie out, and shout across the restaurant or movie theater we’re in:\n\n“Don’t worry Charlie, I won’t be up at Pickfair tonight”.\n\nPoor Charlie, it’s not his fault, but he takes all the flack. Can you imagine me with dopey old Albert Einstein, after I’d had a couple of drinks. We’ll not go there.\n\nBack in the day, at Biograph, I was known for my mocking tones and irreverent manner with the executives and director. I did mock some of the regular company as well, but usually kept my opinions at the level of a mumble. For instance, I’d make snide comments about the way The Sweetheart always waved her hair on top. You will have noticed that the average actress, however much she fussed over her banana curls, always frizzed up the top, or lets it run a bit wild. This was a token of humility, designed to thwart any claims of us being swell-headed. Gladys (Mary) always went the whole hog, and, rather than make her curls with rags, she used hard rollers with spikes in ‘em. How did she sleep at night? She put her hand between her head and the rollers, and this seems to have damaged her right hand, which now appears limp to me.\n\nPeople often ask me why I am so unbelievably ambitious. Well, there’s one simple answer – Mary Pickford! She once told me she wanted to earn $200 a week by the time she was 20 years old, and then make $1,000 a week by 22. Furthermore, she wanted to be the first named movie actress (we didn’t count Florence Lawrence as she had faded very quickly). Mary also reckoned she could get her name over a studio before anyone else. Poor Mary, I beat her on every count. Of course, I achieved all of this because I had linked myself to Mack Sennett – took a shortcut, you might say. However, no one should dismiss me for that – every Biograph actress had the same opportunity to do likewise, but they did not realize how deep his understanding of films, and their mode of sale, actually was. Mack Sennett, like many of us, could never see anything in Mary, and would say:\n\n“I don’t see why everyone’s so crazy about her – I think she’s affected!”\n\nObviously, Mack was incensed that Mary regularly ate at the top table, while most of us munched at dry, curled up sandwiches. I didn’t mind so much, as I could sit with the proletariat, and not have to suffer those stuck-up assholes, like D.W. Griffith. Mary was a Belasco trained stage actress, and Griffith instinctively thought she was good. Although Mack was a bit of a clown, we all reckoned that Mary’s films were greatly enhanced by his presence in them. Want to know something? Mack Sennett wrote the screenplays for some of Mary’s early films – you might remember The Lonely Villa – screenplay written by The King of Comedy in 1911.\n\nMary Pickford is a prodigious star of films, but how good an actress is she? Fortunately, I once discussed this with The Sweetheart herself, and she told me that her brother Jack and sister Lottie, were better actors than she was. She says her success was all down to her hair. I’m glad she said this, as it saved me the embarrassment of putting her straight. I would add that Dot Gish is a better actress than Mary – Dot is also far more competent than her sister, Lillian. How does Mary compare with me? Well, modesty forbids me from saying, but, after co-starring with me in Mender of Nets, she refused to play opposite to me again, and very soon after, she was gone from the studio altogether. Her main problem has always been her rigidity and staidness. She appears almost musclebound and wooden on the screen, and I always think that a star player should glide around as though on wheels. As I have said before, Mary throws her feet down, in a cavemanish way, even when wearing dainty shoes. Griffith always wanted her in his films, due to her static appearance. However, her lack of passion and animation infuriated him, and he would often be seen shaking her by the shoulders. I believe he once threw her across the stage, almost breaking her arm. Lottie tells me that Mary is completely devoid of emotion – her abilities lie elsewhere.\n\nAt Biograph, there were many huge egos being polished around the place. First there was Griffith himself, then there was his one-time star-of- stars Florence Lawrence, followed by Miss Pickford and yours truly. Consequently, there was a lot of jostling for position. We never went for each other’s throats though, and would often just mimic each other’s accents. You will understand that, in America, your accent tells everything. Not everyone in the studio came from New York, and there must have been 50 variations of English being played out. In New York there are five different ‘big apple’ accents, and we New Yorkers would tease one and other relentlessly. In those days, I had just about the worst Brooklyn/ Staten Island accent, you’ve ever heard. The actors would call me over saying:\n\n“Cwome over wid de bwoys Mwabel, and have a twawk with izz”\n\nAnd all said in a twangy sort of way. I’d reply by throwing a megaphone or some stage prop at them.\n\nIf you had a Kansas accent you were a marked girl. We would never give her a moment’s peace. “Come on Miss so and so, say ‘I milked the cow’. If she was idiotic enough to comply she would say:\n\n“I mulked the keeyow”\n\nand we’d all fall about laughing. Mary Pickford came from Canada, but unlike Mack Sennett, she had not yet adopted a true yankee accent (or “damned yankee accent” as Griffith used to say). To my American ears she sounded vaguely Scottish, saying ‘about’ as ‘aboat’ and such like. I reveled in talking to her, in my idea of a Scottish accent, adding an eh(?) on the end of every sentence. She had a peculiar way of pronouncing her ‘r’s which I cannot replicate. It was all ridiculous really, but in those days we thought this type of thing very funny, and I was, as usual, going over the top. I know what you’re wondering – what did we say to the English actors. The English were unassailable, and were mostly highly respected thespians, so we sat at their feet. If anyone did mock one of them, you can bet, like me, they’d later be cajoling the actor to teach them to speak ‘proper’. As today, an aristocratic way of speaking in Hollywood was as good as money in the bank. I was lucky, I had Charlie Chaplin to teach me, but the studios spent thousands on old English school ma’ams to train their Bronx-accented starlets (although our films were silent, we were expected to speak in public). By the way to the English, Canadians sound exactly the same as Americans.\n\nWhen Mary left Biograph, temporarily, for IMP studios, it was like a rubber band releasing its tension. She and I could breathe at last. One of the things that annoyed me was the way that her brother and sister did whatever she told them to. I said to them one day:\n\n“Why don’t you tell that prissy bitch to fuck off.”\n\n“Oh no, no, we can’t do that, she’s the head of the family.”\n\n“How come she’s head of the family, when your mother’s still alive. Look at me, I have no stage mother, and no stage sister, yet I still get by.”\n\n“Come on now Mabel” said Jack Pickford “You’ve got Mack Sennett, a six foot muscle-bound monster who clears a path for you” .\n\nI couldn’t really argue with that, but at least Mack was a man, and not a silly curly headed Little Lord Fauntleroy. It was hopeless arguing with them, and the whole family decamped with Mary, when she left for IMP. This was a shame for Lottie was simply adorable, and Jack, well I’ve been in love with Jack since, like, forever (what girl isn’t?).\n\nEventually, only Mabel’s and Mary’s souls remained at Biograph. We both became entrenched 3,000 miles west, in the strange part of Los Angeles known as Hollywood. It’s odd to think that we never lived more than a mile from each other, and yet we hardly ever met. In late 1914, I was at some studio party or other, where I was talking with Blanche Sweet, Lottie Pickford and Dot Gish. Suddenly, Mary came over from the other side of the room, where she’d been sucking up to Adolph Zuckor. This was unusual, but Charlie Chaplin had just walked in, and she was badgering me to introduce her to him. I obliged, and introduced her to Chas, as Hetty Green (the millionairess stock market investor). I said this because Mary was very good in business, and worked hard and successfully, on the financial aspect of her career.\n\n“Oh, come on Mabel, stop messing around and introduce me properly.”\n\n“O.K. this is Mary Pickford.” I said condescendingly.\n\nI’m glad to report that Chas was less than impressed, and only vaguely knew of dramatic actresses. He’d heard of Mary, obviously, but drama was outside his comfort zone. At that time, Charlie and I were in what I call our ‘dreamtime’, a mix of passionate love and professional respect. Chas excused himself and went off to speak with Tom Ince, leaving Mary stuck, uncomfortably, with me. Mary crept off to Zuckor, as soon as possible, and a little later Charlie came over:\n\n“What is she, some kind of Goldilocksian dwarf?” He said, nodding in Mary’s direction.\n\nWe all laughed, including Lottie. Charlie only became mildly interested in Mary, after she’d become Mrs. Fairbanks. However, Charlie now turned his attention to the beautiful Blanche, a platinum blond, billed as ‘the girl with the silken hair’. I believe Charlie was keeping half an eye on me, to see how I’d react. There was no reaction. I could have told Chas that Blanche only had eyes for Marshal Neilan, the husband of Gertude Bambrick. As with Mary and myself, Blanche and Gertie had fallen out somehow, during their time on the stage. Blanche held some sort of life-long grudge against Gertie, hence her determination to steal Marshal away from Gertie, something she finally achieved 8 years later. Here’s a quest for you: Find a photo of Gertie and Blanche socializing together. You’ve as much chance as you would have of finding one of me with Griffith or Miss Pickford.\n\nI have, in the past, called Mary ‘The Great Persuader’. First, she persuaded Griffith she was a great actress, then persuaded Owen Moore that she was worth marrying. Soon after she persuaded some of us to go on strike, because Griffith had put little Mae Marsh in a star role she thought she should have had. Poor Mae, she was very young, and suffered abuse for years after from the girls, including myself. Then, one day I woke up, and realized I’d been duped by The Sweetheart.\n\nFor many years I had an uneasy truce with America’s Sweetheart. Then, everything happened. Firstly, it came to my attention that Jack Pickford had fallen in love with ex-Zeigfield dancer Olive Thomas. Jack told me that Mary disapproved, and had forbidden them to marry. They married anyway, with the only guest, also the best man, in the form of Tommy Meighan.\n\nAt this very time, the sweet Mary, married to Owen Moore, was conducting an affair with married man, Doug Fairbanks. Of course, I was incensed, being a good catholic girl. On top of that I considered Owen to be a good friend, and did not like to see him treated so shabbily. I was not invited to Doug and Mary’s wedding, which was kept pretty much secret. Doug was the type of he-man gorilla that I despised, and I was less than pleased when he appeared at the opening of The Mabel Normand Studio in 1916. I found him conceited and full of himself. He was essentially a man’s man, and, as many know, I like my men to be more intellectual, more philosophical, and devoted entirely to me. I doubted that The Gorilla could even read or write. Charlie later told me later that Doug had an intense disliking for me, so the feeling was mutual. I would pit my sarcastic wit against his he-man tree-swinging any day of the week. Fortunately, this meant I would never attend any boring functions at Pickfair. Surprisingly enough, his son, Doug Jnr. (by Doug’s first wife) was a sweet young boy, who I spoiled terribly whenever I met him. In a way I envy him, for he’s lived all over the world with his mother, and met everyone worth meeting. I daren’t ask him what he thinks of his stepmother, but I wish him every success in his acting career.\n\nMary never had children herself, and, as you might have heard, she was infertile. You might have read that this was caused by a botched appendix operation. Well, it was caused by a back-street abortion, before she married Owen Moore. Whose baby was it – well, your guess is as good as mine.\n\nAround 1925, Doug and Mary had become very reclusive, locking themselves away at Pickfair. It seems, though, that Mary had told Valentino he could come around at any time. One particular Sunday, Doug and Mary were sitting in their garden, when Valentino suddenly appeared on the Pickfair lawn. Doug flew out of his chair, screaming\n\n“What the fuck are you doing here, you greasy Greek wop!?”\n\nHe grabbed poor Valentino by the collar, marched him to the gate, and threw him out. Turning to Mary he shouted:\n\n“Don’t you ever invite that slimey, olive oil spic around here again!”\n\nSpeaking with Valentino later, he told me he was shocked, and didn’t even know where Greece was! This incident serves to show the true nature of the ‘swashbuckler’. He was ignorant and racist – even more racist than Albert Einstein, or Edgar J. Hoover.\n\nThe Bad Times.\n\nIt was when Jack’s wife Olive Thomas died that I really lost it with Miss Pickford. Jack came to me distraught, and we cried together all night. I felt a little cheated, as I had hoped to meet her, but she was often away on location. I don’t know why, but I suspected Mary was behind Ollie’s death. Her rejection by the Pickford matriarchs, Mary and her mother, could have caused her to take her own life on that fateful night in Paris. After that day I don’t think I ever spoke to Mary again – I just couldn’t. Over the next few weeks I spent every Sunday sitting with Ollie’s grief-stricken mother, out on the beach at Santa Monica.\n\nOllie’s mother was not, as I have said elsewhere, the only grief-stricken mother I sat with, on account of that poisonous dwarf, Mary. In 1922, the sweet Mary arranged the wedding of Jack and Marilyn Miller at Pickfair, curiously enough while I was out in Europe – now isn’t that strange? The wedding, of course, should have been in New York, where Marilyn’s family lived. The first Marilyn’s mother learned about the wedding was when she received an invite from the thoughtful Mary. She threw it away. About a month later, I arrived in New York from Europe. Now it had been arranged that I’d stay at Marilyn’s apartment in Manhattan, and, as I’d heard about Jack and Marilyn’s marriage, I’d expected to find it empty, as everyone, I presumed, was in L.A.. You could have knocked me down with a feather, when Marilyn’s mother opened the door, just as I inserted the key.\n\nMarilyn’s mother told me the whole sordid story, and said Mary had sent her a film of the wedding. We watched the film on Marilyn’s projector, and what we saw was nauseating to say the least. We saw The Sweetheart running around controlling things, totally overwhelming the newly-weds. I felt physically sick.\n\nPolitical Collusion on The Playing Fields of Pickfair.\n\nAs you might know, Mary and I are at opposite polls when it comes to politics. While I am a committed socialist, she hails the new fascist parties coming up in Germany, Italy and the U.S. I read a piece by her in the newspaper in which she blames the Jews for The Great War, and the current situation in Germany. She thinks the U.S. fought on the wrong side in that War To End All Wars. What right has she to say that, when only her brother was involved in the conflict, and he never left U.S. waters! Meantime, my brother Claude was out fighting on the Somme, up to his neck in muck and bullets. It’s about time the government owned up, and told us why we were involved in a conflict that did not concern us. Now, Charlie Chaplin almost certainly had Jewish ancestry, and I asked him why he associated with those fascists up at Pickfair. He simply shrugged his shoulders, but when I mentioned that Chaplin imitator Adolph Hitler he colored up, and ranted that he was going to prosecute Hitler for impersonating him. I wish him luck, but I am sure there is no copyright on toothbrush mustaches and lank hair. Lord save us all, if that madman Hitler ever becomes head of the German government.\n\nFinally.\n\nIn a way we were all like Mary Pickford, always looking for an angle , so as to get ahead. Mary took it farther than most, but then she had more time to devote to it. While the Biograph girls were out, loose on the town, Mary stayed home, and, between sewing her dresses and curling her hair, she schemed and schemed, then schemed some more. She may not be the best actress in the world, but she is certainly the wealthiest. I’ll let Mack Sennett have the final word:\n\n“She was the greatest confidence trickster the movie industry has ever known.”\n\nThat’s something, coming from ‘The Master of Illusion’.\n\n*I will, periodically, release more of these articles in the future.\n\nBibliography:\n\nSunshine and Shadow by Mary Pickford (1956).\n\nWhen the Movies Were Young by Linda Griffith (1924).\n\nMabel Normand: A Sourcebook of her Life and Films by Wm.
