        "text": "Since we’re already on the topic of Canada, it is worth mentioning that the world’s first movie star, Mary Pickford, was a Canadian.\n\nMary was born in Toronto in 1892. Her alcoholic father died when she was very young; her mother was forced to allow Mary to take an acting job–something considered highly disreputable in those days–in order to feed the family. By the turn of the century, Mary and her younger brother and sister were touring America, playing third-rate theaters, staying only a step ahead of starvation. Fast forward a few years and she has become the most recognizable woman in the world, known far and wide as “our Mary,” “Little Mary,” and “America’s Sweetheart.”\n\nI found this fascinating 2-part interview with Mary that was recorded in 1959. In the first part, she talks about growing up in Toronto. http://archives.cbc.ca/arts_entertainment/film/clips/3653/\n\nIn second part, she talks about her early career, her friend and business partner, Charlie Chaplin, her husband Douglas Fairbanks, and their 38-room house, known as Pickfair. http://archives.cbc.ca/arts_entertainment/film/clips/13869/"
