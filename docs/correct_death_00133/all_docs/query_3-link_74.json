        "text": "Although the Soda Fountain’s focus is on film and pop culture of the 1920s and 30s, we do occasionally review movies made during other parts of the 20th century. So put on your best pair of tight jeans, shake up that can of Aqua Net and crack open a box of Dipps granola bars because we’re reviewing the ultimate Canadian teen movie of the 1990s: Degrassi’s School’s Out!\n\nIf the name Joey Jeremiah means anything to you, you’re probably A) Canadian and B) Gen X. With his trademark fedora, Joey (played by the charismatic Pat Mastroianni) was the cocky but good-hearted troublemaker of the OG Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High television series’, the Canadian franchise which undoubtedly, for better or for worse, left its mark on a generation of Canadian teens who came of age in the 1980s and early 90s. Although Degrassi was made up of an ensemble cast and didn’t allow for star billing, Joey undoubtedly became the star anyway. Can we call him the Canadian Cagney? Or maybe the Canadian Ferris Bueller? The only difference being that unlike Ferris, Joey always got caught. And in School’s Out (1992), the made-for-TV movie that marked the end of the original series, boy does he ever get caught.\n\nThat’s because Degrassi wasn’t just entertainment; it was educational entertainment. Every episode was a “very special” one: the show tackled heavy topics such as AIDS, teenage pregnancy, abortion, alcoholism and death, as well as lighter fare like first date jitters, unrequited crushes and trying to get into a strip club when all you have is a crappy fake ID and barely enough dollar bills for a glass of Coca Cola. Degrassi addressed these issues head on with an often unflinching eye, yet it was never quite as edgy as it clearly thought itself to be. The series had much in common with the “hygiene films” or “social guidance films” shown in classrooms during the 1950s and 60s: there was always a lesson to be learned and parents (usually) knew best. In grade eight, we had a “Guidance” class which consisted of nothing more than our teacher playing VHS tapes of Degrassi Junior High while at the same time making snide remarks about the appearance of the cast (“With hair like that, no wonder they have problems!” he’d cackle).\n\nIn spite of the fact that I had to watch it at school, I chose to watch Degrassi at home too. Although the show sometimes looks a little cheesy to me today, it didn’t then: my sister and I would make jokes about other teen-oriented TV shows, such as Saved by the Bell and 90210, but, unlike my Guidance teacher, we never made fun of Degrassi. There was a certain authentic grittiness to this Canadian show that was missing from the American programs. For one thing, unlike 90210, the kids in Degrassi were actually kids: with pimples, frizzy hair and all. Joey and his best pals Snake (Stefan Brogren) and Wheels (Neil Hope) even formed a Ramones-esque band called The Zit Remedy. Also, the show was Canadian and in the 1980s and early 90s, that was a big deal: most of the pop culture we consumed was American so it was kind of a thrill to watch a TV show set in our home city of Toronto, and one that never pretended to be American at that. I remember being really excited whenever they’d show Canadian dollar bills and how proud I was when the New York based Sassy magazine mentioned Degrassi in an issue. So when School’s Out debuted on CBC television on January 5th, 1992 when I was in ninth grade, it was a huge deal and not just for me: the movie attracted 2.3 million viewers. In an era long before streaming, we all pretty much watched the same thing and School’s Out was the talk of my high school the day after its premiere. There are a few very important reasons for this: one involves a banana and the other involves an F-bomb. But more on that later.\n\nContinue reading “Sex, Drugs and Scrunchies: Revisiting the Degrassi Movie School’s Out (1992)” →\n\n“Francie held one of the doll’s hands tightly. A nerve in her thumb throbbed and she thought the doll’s hand twitched. She almost believed the doll was real.” – from A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith (1943)\n\nOn Halloween night 1989, I did two things that I had never done before: I stayed home while my sister went trick-or-treating and I watched my first genuine horror movie. The movie was Child’s Play (1988), about Chucky, a carrot-topped Corky-style talking-doll possessed by the spirit of a serial killer, and I was instantly transfixed. I don’t know what it was about this movie that fascinated me but I do think it’s interesting that I discovered it just after I had stopped playing with dolls myself. Not that I had wanted to put away my beloved Barbie and Jem dolls: at twelve years old however, it was what was expected of me. Up until then, I had lived in two worlds: my drab real life one and the exciting, colorful, “grownup” world of my glamourous dolls. Perhaps that’s why Child’s Play appealed to me: I liked the idea of one of my dolls coming to life, even if it was inhabited by the ghost of a deranged psychopath.\n\nAs children, we are encouraged to use our dolls to channel our hopes, dreams and ambitions – this is especially true when it comes to the marketing of Barbie. Infused with so much of our emotional energy, it’s not impossible to imagine a doll becoming sentient. In fact, one of the most famous doll makers of the first half of the 20th century, Madame Beatrice Alexander, was described by a journalist for the World Telegram thusly: “Not only does (she) put soles on her dolls, but she puts souls into them!”\n\nContinue reading “Listen Up, Doll Face” →\n\nDean lived in North Etobicoke, so I had to take two buses to get to his condo. I didn’t know anyone else who lived in a condo—when I was a kid, we called them “condom buildings,” even before we knew what a condom was—and as I stepped off the bus in my stacked platform sandals, I was disappointed at the ordinary blah-beige tower bouncing up against the early morning clouds. As I approached the front entrance, hesitation tugged at my heart and slowed my feet.\n\nNo one knew where I was. I didn’t even have a cell phone because only doctors and drug dealers had mobile phones in the mid-1990s. You know that scene in Clueless when Cher and Dionne are walking down the school hallway chatting on their phones? That was meant to be a joke.\n\n“Do I look nervous?” Dean asked, grinning as he ushered me into his apartment. “If I do, it’s because I was afraid that you wouldn’t show up.”\n\n– Excerpt from “Fifty Dollars for the Powder Room”, my nonfiction essay, published in the Fall +Winter 2023/2024 issue of the Humber Literary Review. The issue is free to read online for the season, please visit the Humber Literary Review’s website here.\n\n“This film is about the birth of Venus in Australia.”\n\nHelen Morse (actor, Mademoiselle de Poitiers in Picnic at Hanging Rock)\n\nPerhaps it is when we are young that we are the closest to being our dream selves. Once lost, a dream – like youth – can never be found.\n\nI had these thoughts while watching Peter Weir’s ethereal Picnic at Hanging Rock, a film that can be described as “a mystery that remains a mystery”. Based upon the 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay (who reportedly said that the novel came to her in a dream), Picnic at Hanging Rock opens with a title card informing us of the following:\n\nOn Saturday 14th February 1900 a party of schoolgirls from Appleyard College picnicked at Hanging Rock near Mt. Macedon in the state of Victoria. During the afternoon several members of the party disappeared without trace…\n\nThe film begins with girls in white nightgowns: long haired maidens washing their pretty faces in basins of pink roses; tightening each other’s corsets; counting Valentine cards; breathlessly reciting poetry; pressing flowers into booklets; gossiping and giggling; the mirrors on walls and vanity tables capturing themselves, capturing each other. “You must learn to love someone else, apart from me, Sarah,” the Venus-like Miranda gently admonishes her quiet, sensitive friend as she runs a brush through her long blonde mane before a looking glass. “I won’t be here much longer.”\n\nLike Lewis Carroll’s Alice, Miranda will disappear. Unlike Alice, she won’t come back.\n\nContinue reading “Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975): A Dream Within a Dream” →\n\n“I decided that short skirts are here to stay, and if we wear short skirts, we must wear short hair or we’re going to look top-heavy.”\n\nMary Pickford, as quoted in The Sunday Tribune, August 26th, 1928\n\nOne of Hollywood’s first international superstars, Mary Pickford began her career in movies in 1909, as an actress at the Biograph Company. Although she had been born in Toronto, Canada in 1892, on the site where the Hospital for Sick Children currently stands, she became known worldwide as “America’s Sweetheart”. Powerfully independent and possessing strong business acumen, Pickford went on to become one of the founders of United Artists (in 1919) and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (in 1927). To her fans and the public at large however, Pickford was “Our Little Mary” and “the Girl with the Golden Curls”.\n\nIn 1921, an article in the Border Cities Star stated that each one of Pickford’s curls was worth twenty thousand dollars; since she had twenty curls, “Mary Pickford’s hair is (worth) four hundred thousand dollars.” Reporting that one of her curls had accidently been snipped off during the filming of Little Lord Fauntleroy, the paper lamented that “with one of her golden ringlets missing, Mary Pickford has sustained an actual loss of twenty thousand dollars” (as the article notes, Pickford’s hair was not insured).\n\n“I have to give up one entire day a week to my shampoo,” Pickford told the Lewiston Daily Sun in 1926, noting that she liked short hair on other women. “But the public knows me by my long hair and I could never screen with bobbed hair for my appearance would not be the same.”\n\nBut by 1928, with the dominance of sexy “flapper” stars such as Clara Bow and with the arrival of talking pictures, Mary’s long tight curls were beginning to look like a relic. More importantly, Mary’s mother, of whom she was especially close, died of breast cancer on March 21st, 1928. On June 21st of that year, a bereaved Mary walked into a New York City beauty parlor.\n\nMARY PICKFORD CUTS HER HAIR!, screamed the headlines the following day. As reported by the Spokane Daily Chronicle:\n\n“Mary Pickford had a big story for the papers today. Reporters swarmed to hear. ‘I’ve cut my hair,’ she exclaimed and the multitude gasped. ‘But what of the curls?’ demanded the throng when they had recovered their breath.\n\nSpokane Daily Chronicle, June 22, 1928\n\nThat same day, The Daily Times published an article titled “Mary Loses Famous Curls: Movie Actress Joins Flapper Ranks in Bobbing Tresses While Doug Almost Weeps”. In it, Mary spoke of her husband Douglas Fairbanks’ reaction to her new hairdo: “Doug cried – or at least he looked as though he was going to – when he came in and found me brushing my bobbed hair.”\n\nHer fans were none happier, as evidenced by the angry letters that Pickford says she received. “You would have thought I’d murdered someone,” she wrote in her memoirs. “And perhaps I had, but only to give her successor a chance to live.”\n\n“I think if most critics knew how much it hurt the people that made the things that they are writing about, they would second guess the way they write these things. (…) It is devastating when you are being institutionally told that your personal expression was bad. That’s something that people carry with them, literally, their entire lives and I get why. It f****ing sucks.”\n\nSeth Rogen\n\n“I hope they burn every print of this turkey that’s in existence.”\n\nJoan Crawford (talking about her 1932 critical and box office flop Rain)\n\nIn 1932, US unemployment reached 24%; an estimated 15,000 WW1 veterans, many out of work, marched to the nation’s capital to demand the payment of their bonus for serving in the war; and Grand Hotel, a movie about beautiful, rich people won Best Picture. Grand Hotel is a good film but there were at least two other movies that came out that same year which were much more interesting: Tod Browning’s Freaks, which turned a gruesome fun house mirror on America to reveal who the real monsters are (hint: not the sideshow performers) and Lewis Milestone’s Rain, an unflinching brutal takedown of religious and moral hypocrisy. Both movies flopped spectacularly with critics and audiences alike when they opened in 1932. Today, they are considered masterpieces. Sometimes it just takes a while for people to “get it”.\n\nThere has been so much said and written about Freaks over the years that there really isn’t anything new that I can add to the conversation besides to say that if you haven’t already seen it, you most definitely should (but be prepared for it to haunt you for days and not for the reasons you may think), so this post will focus on Rain which, apart from Joan Crawford’s makeup in the film, has been less talked about.\n\nBased on a short story by W. Somerset Maugham, Rain takes place on a South Pacific island where a ship of American passengers are temporarily stranded due to a possible cholera outbreak. Among the passengers are Mr. Davidson (Walter Huston), a bible thumping missionary; his equally uptight wife (Beulah Bondi) and Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford), a fun loving, brazen young woman who makes no secret of the fact that she’s a prostitute. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nContinue reading ““Sweating Right Through Her Dress”: Joan Crawford, Critics and Rain (1932)” →\n\nFor almost fourteen years, I lived without television. It was less out of any kind of wannabe-intellectual snobbery and more due to the fact that when I moved into my first apartment, I just never got around to getting a TV hooked up. After my second move, it no longer seemed necessary; I’d already gotten along well without one and besides, I reasoned, I had probably already had my fill of “the boob tube” as a kid: in an attempt to escape drama at home and bullies at school, I crawled into the TV set as a child and stayed there, preferring the scripted scenarios and happy endings to a confusing and unhappy reality.\n\nMy TV-abstinence ended on Christmas of 2020 when my partner, Neil, gifted me with a digital antenna. Due to the location of my apartment unit, I’m only able to pick up a handful of channels: a few stations from Buffalo, sometimes PBS and TVO and usually CITYTV. In other words…\n\n“There’s nothing on except Hudson & Rex!”\n\nThis was my lament during those early days of winter Covid-lockdowns, referring to Citytv’s homegrown show about two handsome detectives (one of whom happens to be a German shepherd). It hurts to admit it now, but at first I approached Hudson & Rex with a cynical eye (Canadians tend to be skeptical about our own talent). It wasn’t long however before I was admonishing Neil not to change the channel:\n\n“I want to see Rex jump!”\n\n“He always jumps!”, Neil responded.\n\n“And it’s always awesome!” I replied.\n\nRex does more than just take the bad guys down in slo-mo. In addition to sniffing out clues and solving crimes, he also comes to the aid of victims and the bereaved: carrying boxes of tissues and offering cuddles of comfort. One of my favorite moments happens in a recent episode in which the team finds out that a physiotherapist, whose murder they are attempting to solve, was also a sexual predator. Rex senses that Sarah, the team’s Chief of Forensics, is triggered by this news and he’s instantly at her side. “Our big furry empathy bomb,” Sarah calls him affectionately. This is why I love the show: as someone who struggles with PTSD, Rex is a comfort to me too.\n\n“The dog embodies a rich, mythic sort of heroism, an empathy that is broader and deeper and more pure than what an ordinary human would be capable of,” author Susan Orlean writes in Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend. My love of Hudson & Rex inspired me to pick up Orlean’s impeccably researched and immensely entertaining book, thus taking a deep dive into the history of dogs in movies and television.\n\nThe first movie to star a dog was the 1905 British smash hit Rescued by Rover, an early narrative film about a collie who saves a kidnapped baby. The movie was so popular that the name “Rover” (which was not a typical dog’s name prior to the film), became synonymous with “dog”. Studios quickly realized that movies with dogs “fetched” big bucks at the box office: there was collie superstar Jean the Vitagraph Dog and then Strongheart, the German shepherd with the sad, beautiful eyes who had a dog food named after him; Charlie Chaplin got a doggy sidekick and so did Harold Lloyd. Pete the Pup joined Our Gang in 1927 and even badass George Bancroft had a canine companion in the 1929 gangster movie Thunderbolt. One of my favorite on-screen dogs from the silent era is in the Nell Shipman Canadian adventure film Back to God’s Country (1919): a Great Dane named “Wapi the Killer”; an abused dog who is described by the title cards as “an alien without friends, hating the men who understand nothing of the magic of kindness and love, but whose law is the law of the whip and the club.” Only after he is rescued from these brutes by Shipman’s heroine does Wapi experience “a new miracle of understanding roused by the touch of a woman’s hand.” In Back to God’s Country, dog and woman rescue one another, thus fulfilling their shared dream of freedom.\n\nIn her book, Susan Orlean interestingly connects our affection for animals with the rise of industrialization:\n\n“The invention of cinema came at the moment when animals were starting to recede from a central role in human civilization; from that moment forward, they began to be sentimental — a soft memento of another time, consolation for the cost of modernity.”\n\nSusan Orlean, Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend\n\nBut of all the canine cinema superstars of the silent era, not one was more beloved, influential or enduring than Rin Tin Tin.\n\nContinue reading “Before There Was Hudson & Rex, There Was Duncan & Rinty” →\n\n“April is the cruelest month,” T.S. Eliot wrote and I would add “most fickle” and “untrustworthy” too. A month that tends to make more promises than it keeps.\n\nMy father died on April 10th, thirteen years ago. The day before, I had been comfortably wearing a light, pink spring jacket. But it began to snow the morning my father died. Waiting outside for the bus to take me to the hospital, I shivered in my thin clothing. I had not expected the cold. I was unprepared.\n\nGrief tends to take the form of the one we are grieving. Therefore the grief I experienced in the wake of my dad’s death was quiet, pensive and even comforting; like the man himself. And giving. Thirteen years gone and he still gives to me: like this musical box of his that my mother gifted me with last summer. A box that plays the tune to the Beatles’ “Yesterday” when it is wound. A box that contains nothing more than a couple of old pennies, a cat’s veterinary card from 1983, my grade two class photo, an old watch and a badge from his Navy uniform.\n\nTreasures.\n\nA reminder that we never truly lose the ones we love.\n\nWhen you think of a Prohibition-era gangster, what image immediately comes to mind? Is it Al Capone and the Saint Valentine’s Day massacre? Is it John Dillinger being shot to death by federal agents outside the Biograph Theater? Or is it Edward G. Robinson, a cigar anchored between his lips, imploring us to “Be Somebody!”; is it James Cagney shooting his words out quicker than bullets from a Tommy gun?\n\nFor me it’s Robinson and Cagney, in Little Caesar (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931) respectively, who best embody the slick anti-hero in all of his brutal brilliance, better even than the real-life gangsters themselves.\n\nBut before Cagney and Robinson shook up the game, there was a different kind of on-screen gangster.\n\nAnd he was mighty cuddly.\n\nIn Thunderbolt (1929), George Bancroft plays Thunderbolt Jim Lang, a gangster sentenced to death, who bides his time in prison by plotting revenge on the bank teller (Richard Arlen) who stole his moll (Fay Wray). If this sounds gritty, it isn’t – the intensely likable Bancroft is a cross between James Cagney and Oliver Hardy and the hijinks he gets up to in Thunderbolt have more in common with the latter’s comedy shorts with Stan Laurel than they do with The Public Enemy. In the New York Times’ 1929 review of the film, writer Mordaunt Hall describes Thunderbolt as “a musical comedy plot striving to masquerade as a drama.” But it isn’t the film’s plot that makes it interesting but rather when it was made: during Hollywood’s turbulent transition from silent movies to “talkies” (sound films), a period which has been well documented in films such as Singin’ in the Rain (1952) and most recently in Babylon (2022).\n\nContinue reading “Thunderbolt (1929): The Good, the Bad and the Cuddly” →"
