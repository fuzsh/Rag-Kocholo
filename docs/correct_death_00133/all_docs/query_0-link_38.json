        "text": "Library of Congress [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nMary Pickford was born April 8th 1892, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She was an actress and loved her work. Mary became a hit at a very young age, of about 5, in Toronto, and then the glory came.\n\nIn 1919 she starred in her best movie, \"Daddy Long Legs.\" She loved it and wanted it to last forever. Mary Pickford loved acting and once said: \"Acting could be a gift, or something to work at and just have fun doing it.\"\n\nIn America, Mary Pickford was known as \"America's Sweetheart.\" Also in 1919, she made her last silent movie, called \"My Best Girl,\" then she went to speaking and we heard her voice.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1920 Mary Pickford became the most famous woman alive. At that moment she did not want to act, yet did not want to be poor again, so she adjusted and learned to like what she did. She got $350,000 per movie. Then the company she worked for did not have enough money to support her, and she went to a new company and changed the way people thought about independent women.\n\nMary Pickford died on May 25, 1979, in Santa Monica, CA."
