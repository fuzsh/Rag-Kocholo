        "text": "I got together with my long lost cousin over the weekend and one of the things he showed me was a scrapbook that had been made by a great aunt. What he thought was strange was that stuck in amongst all the other cuttings was a signed photo of Mary Pickford.\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking that lots of people stick into scrapbooks all sorts of things and there is no family connection. Anyway I googled Mary Pickford and what I found makes me think there has to be a connection. My cousin has been told on several occasions as he was growing up, there is one, but we'd now like to know how, what, when.\n\nMary Pickford was born 8th April 1892 Toronto, Canada, she died in Santa Monica. California in May 1979 of a cerebral haemorage aged 87. Mary Pickford was a stage name, her birth name was Gladys Marie Smith, I have checked this detail out on the IGI, as well as a few other sources and also asked my cousin whether he knows of any other info, something his Mum mentioned in passing that might help us.\n\nOur grandmother was born a Smith in 1895, for Mary Pickford to be a cousin, one or both her parents would have had to have gone to Canada around 1895. Its her where I draw a blank, it would appear that he fathers name was John Smith and apart from JS and herself also being in the acting profession, I cannot say with certainty who they were.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on where my cousin and I should go next. As always MTIA :smilee:\n\nAs luck would have it, just as things are getting interesting, my sub has run out.\n\nIt so happens that Mary Pickford's grandfather Joseph could well fit into my family tree. The Joseph I have was born in Gloucestershire and I am wondering whether this is the same one talked about in Wikipedia but there it says he came from Liverpool. Was he a born and bred Liverpudlian or was it just the port he left from?\n\nMy late uncle spoke of the Lawrence River and my family trading out in Canada, but being ten I thought he was off on another flight of fancy (as he was want to do) but now it seems I could have down with paying a little more credence to his words.\n\nWhat is also interesting is that keying in John Charles Smith in the search engine, brought up entries connected with Waterloo. This seems to add more evidence for the family fortune in my great grandfathers time to have come out of Waterloo and the connection to the Duke of Wellington.\n\nI like puzzles, I am so close I can practically taste it, its shame this information has come to light when I am subscriptionless, so I will have to look round for a good deal :smilee:\n\nThanks for all your efforts so far, much appreciated."
