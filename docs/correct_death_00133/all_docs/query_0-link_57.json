        "text": "A pioneer of the American film industry with a career that spanned many decades, Gladys Marie Smith, known professionally as Mary Pickford, was cited as ‘America’s Sweetheart’ and ‘The Girl with the Curls’, her hair selling for ridiculous money, her fans clambering for every piece of her. She was, perhaps, best known as ‘The Queen of Cinema’ as her rise to the top cemented her status as the most powerful woman in Hollywood. This is the story of one of the finest and most determined movie stars of the silent era who redefined the movie business and forever changed Hollywood…\n\nGrowing Up in Misery\n\n1892. Mary was born at 211 University Avenue in Toronto, Canada, long since buried under a sea of steel and glass. Her father was John Smith, son of English Methodist immigrants, working a variety of odd jobs. Her mother, Charlotte, worked as a seamstress. Both of Mary’s siblings, her sister Lottie and her brother Jack, became actors. But this household was far from kind. John was abusive due to his alcoholism, abandoning his family and dying shortly after suffering a fatal blood clot. This was a family bereft, left penniless. Like her siblings, young Mary loved to act and so she had to start working in a theatre when she was just six-years-old, all to support her family.\n\nShe was just very attuned to human misery. And I suspect [that’s] because she’d grown up in human misery and she didn’t forget it.\n\n– Scott Eyman (biographer).\n\nDeath. Poverty. Disease, Mary’s home once placed under infectious quarantine as a public health measure. Mary became the family’s breadwinner and soon, the stage provided merciful respite from the horrors of home life. Her entire family loved to act, the stage their second home. But the determination to succeed was strongest in Mary. She was driven to become a star. And her chance would come in 1899…\n\nThe Boarder\n\nTo make ends meet after the death of John, everyone in the family, no matter how young, had to work or find some way of earning money. Charlotte started taking in boarders, one of whom, Mr Murphy, was the theatrical stage manager for Cummings Stock Company. It was his idea to cast the then seven-year-old Mary and the then six-year-old Lottie in silent parts in the production of ‘The Silver King’, whilst Charlotte would play the organ. The applause for Mary was loudest. The money was even better.\n\nMary was driven by a desire to succeed, so much that, in her first years as an actress, she would stab her cheeks with a pin to imitate the blushing older actresses of her time. She joined Toronto’s Valentine Stock Company and that was the end of her life in school. By 1900, the theatre had become a family business. The family toured America by rail performing in third-rate companies and plays. It was a tough time living in poverty and life on the rails was not a life much rosier. Mary gave herself one more year to make it to Broadway. That’s it. Or I am done with this acting business. She was eight, by the way.\n\nMary never lacked confidence. And in 1906, Mary, Lottie and Jack supported singer Chauncey Olcott on Broadway. She gave it a few more years. It was in this play Mary adopted her stage name. The play was written by William C. deMille, brother of Cecil. But when Mary was not onstage, she was out of work yet remained eager to act. So, at the astonishingly young age of just 17, she decided to star in a movie and appealed to director DW Griffith for a role in one of his pictures. Mary wasn’t invited. No, she just thought she’d turn up and see what happens.\n\nShe never wanted a career in the movies, but just a little role to tide her over until the next stage show came. The movie business intrigued Mary greatly. She was screen-tested but lost out on the role, yet Griffith had taken a shine to Mary. All of his actresses were earning $5 a day but after just a few hours with Mary, Griffith agreed to take her on for $10 a day.\n\nAnd what a decision that would turn out to be.\n\nThe Fledgling Star\n\nThe movies were Charlotte’s idea. Mary kinda hoped Griffith would turn her down, but in her first few days in the studio, Mary realised just how desperate directors were for actresses. And the money was good. All $10 of it. Mary was tough. The directors of the day were not kind to their actresses. On Mary’s first day, Griffith dragged her into makeup painted and her black and white. He demanded she overact. She refused. He dubbed her ‘The Great Unkissed’, determined to break Mary’s will. But he never did. She was the only actress of his that fought back. You will respect me, she told him. She was just 17. She had her stage career as a safety net, so she felt confident enough to speak her mind.\n\nMary may not have loved Griffith, but she loved to act. She played bit parts and leading roles, from mothers to prostitutes. In 1909 alone, she appeared in 51 films, with her first starring role being ‘The Violin Maker of Cremona’, starring opposite Owen Moore, one of her many, many future husbands. She said later:\n\nI played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities… I decided that if I could get into as many pictures as possible, I’d become known, and there would be a demand for my work.\n\nAudiences were noticing Mary’s work. She stood out from the crowd for all the right reasons. But nobody knew her name as actresses were not credited in Griffith’s films. But advertisers cottoned on to Mary’s popularity and by 1910, she was featuring front and centre of the posters of her various movies. They labelled her, ‘The Girl with the Golden Curls’ and ‘Blondilocks’. She had blonde, curly hair, it was a noticeable feature of hers…\n\nMary could act and her performances were winning acclaim. She was starting to be recognised on the streets so she asked for a $5 raise. Griffith tried to prevent her from capitalising on her success (and he ordered all her fan mail to be ‘torn up’ before Mary could see it). But the fame she was gaining could not be stopped. Her popularity was exploding and because moviegoers had already singled out Mary as a firm favourite of theirs, her success in features was guaranteed.\n\nMary was a star.\n\nFrom Rags to Riches\n\nPredictably, Mary left Griffith and his sexism behind, enjoying a successful run on Broadway in 1913. In that year, she signed a motion picture contract with Adolph Zukor and the Famous Players Film Company. 1913 was the dawn of the feature film. And Mary was about to become the biggest star in the movie business.\n\nIt was then she decided to dedicate her career to the movies. She was attracting a strong following. Comedy dramas such as ‘In the Bishop’s Carriage’ made her irresistible to moviegoers. And with each success, she asked for more money. I do like her gumption. ‘Heart’s Adrift’ was Mary’s first picture in which her name was on the top of poster, reserved for the leading star. My word she had made it.\n\n[Heart’s Adrift] sent her career into orbit and made her the most popular actress in America, if not the world.\n\n– Kevin Brownlow (biographer).\n\nWithin a few weeks of the release, Mary’s salary had been upped to $560,000 a year. She put most of it into her savings. She was prudent, after all. Only one year later, she was earning $1 million. She knew her worth. She quit Griffith when he asked her to flash her legs in a caveman costume. I’m not putting myself through that, to be debased, she thought. And so she left. Every time a studio did something that made her feel uncomfortable, or if a better offer came along, she would jump ship and sign for a new studio.\n\nBy 1914, there was no doubt that Mary was the most famous woman on Earth. The world’s first female celebrity, a name everyone knew. Her golden, long curly hair, the childish dresses she often wore to make her appear younger, the image of innocence. She had cultivated an appearance and a style and it worked for her. She was frozen in time, childlike, as Alice in Wonderland. Few realised her curls cost $50 each, a lot considering a movie ticket was a nickel…\n\nMary’s hair came to define her. She travelled with a suitcase full of hair. That’s not weird at all. She did pay the price of the innocent image she exuded. When one child spotted Mary with a manicure, back then reserved for adults, the child shouted, “Mama! She’s not a real little girl! She has long fingernails!” Mary played up to this image from then on. She cut her nails short and stopped herself from applying lipstick in public to maintain her image. She refused to use pencils in public too, for fear others would mistake them as cigarettes.\n\nShe really had thought of every little detail.\n\nThe Disguise\n\nMary had become an international star. She created a fan worship never seen before. She was mobbed regularly on the streets by hordes of adoring fans. Today? Normal. Back then? It had never been seen before. It gave her incredible power. She used her stature to promote causes that were close to her heart. She was a strong businessperson who controlled her own career.\n\nDuring World War I, she sold Liberty Bonds and on one occasion, she spoke on Wall Street to 50,000 people. Although she was Canadian, she became a potent symbol of all things Americana. To raise money for Liberty Bonds, she sold one of her famous curls for $15,000. And later on, after one, single speech in Chicago, Mary alone sold an estimated $5 million worth of bonds. The US Navy dubbed her, ‘Little Sister’, whilst the US Army named two cannons after her, making her an honorary colonel. Mary was living one hell of a life.\n\nThe curls were not real. Mary didn’t dare tell anyone that at the time, though. The hair was bought from prostitutes. Mary would, eventually, tire of playing ‘little girls’ and she cut off the famous curls. The reaction across America was insane. The nation lost its shit. As one of her biographers once said:\n\nYou would have thought she’d murdered the American eagle.\n\nMary’s fans adored her sweet, innocent, little girl image. She was just five feet tall, too, so she could play those roles convincingly. Without speaking a world, in this, the silent era, the world loved her. By 1916, she was earning $10,000 a week.\n\nShe would sign off on every aspect of her productions, from the script to the director. She wanted her fans to know she had a hand in making her pictures. One review of her work at this time simply described Mary as, ‘Luminous tenderness in a steel band of gutter ferocity.’ Only Charlie Chaplin had a bigger pull with critics. One journalist once said of Mary:\n\n[She is] the best known woman who has ever lived, the woman who was known to more people and loved by more people than any other woman that has been in all history.\n\nThe Impossible Curls\n\nMary starred in over 200 movies in her career. At her peak, one of her movies netted her, in today’s money, $18.72 million. When I say she was the most famous and richest actress on the planet, in her day, she truly was. The most remarkable feat of Mary’s success, however, was her control. She prevented any kind of scrutiny and worked hard for her fame and fortune. Hard work was all she ever knew, right from when she was just six, lured into acting to support her family. The whole world was entranced by her. The characters she played never broke. They were strong and formidable. Just like Mary.\n\nShe entered a kind of zeitgeist that is hard to imagine today. She shaped Hollywood but also transcended Hollywood. During the war, soldiers carried her portrait in lockets they wore around their necks, for example. Hollywood did not destroy her, far from it. She helped to rescue it. And that made her the ultimate heroine.\n\nShe was youthful and beautiful, but her acting talent seared her roles into public consciousness. She captured her roles so effortlessly it was utterly mesmeric. In 1919, Mary, Griffith, Chaplin and Fairbanks formed an independent film production company that you may have heard of: United Artists. Mary was now producing her own movies. Her fame almost impossible.\n\nThey built a large office in LA, today a hotel, and a theatre nearby. Mary supervised every detail, even the design of the toilets. Which were pink. She would approve scripts, and hire directors, writers, cast and crew. She was an absolute trailblazer, the envy of so many people. And it’s important to remember: she was still just 27. The producers were signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree, far removed from the infamous studio inference we know today.\n\nEven today, Mary remains the most powerful woman who ever worked in Hollywood. Even today. She was a rebellion against the establishment but she also helped to create a new world, a new vision for Hollywood. And she loved it.\n\nMary truly lapped up every second of a life well lived.\n\nStardom\n\nMary married Douglas Fairbanks in 1920 and turned their Beverly Hills mansion into a royal palace. Over the next few years, visitors included Albert Einstein, Amelia Earhart, F Scott Fitzgerald, George Bernard Shaw, Helen Keller, HG Wells, and, of course, Charlie Chaplin. Mary didn’t like Charlie Chaplin too much, partly borne from jealousy. She once called him a clown. To his face. But she decided to rise above this, committed to uniting the stars of Hollywood rather than be divided by egos. Mary would go on to become one of the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1927.\n\nMary and Douglas were a celebrity super couple, mobbed everywhere they went. Mary decided to slow down on her acting career after 1920. She went to making just one movie a year after 1921, focusing instead on her productions. Despite this, her 1920s was her best decade. Her movies in this era were her best received. Her film, ‘Pollyanna’ (1920), grossed $1.1 million, whilst her film, ‘Rosita’ (1923), grossed $1 million. But the arrival of the talkies would prove to be her undoing.\n\nMary underestimated the value of adding sound to pictures, saying, “Adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the Venus de Milo.” Instead, it turned out to be like putting trousers on her. Fans were shocked by Mary’s transformation. Gone were the curls and the childlike innocence. The talkies were when Mary grew up.\n\nIt coincided with her mother’s death in 1928. Mary cutting her hair made the front page of The New York Times. Not that Mary cared. Her 1928 movie ‘Coquette’ won her an Academy Award after all. And not her only one. But the public did not respond to these more serious roles. She found her career fading as the talkies took hold, Mary struggling to stay relevant. It was unfair but she never complained. By 1930, she had lived a thousand lifetimes.\n\nShe had wielded her power with savvy grace, a person of great compassion and generosity. During the production of her pictures, she hung a bucket up and asked everyone working to put some money in for those in the industry who were not working. She donated much of her time and energy to charities. But she could never hope to match the success of her silent movies, despite her best efforts.\n\nShe retired from acting in 1933.\n\nThe Last Years\n\nMary had been in the movie business for an impressive 23 years and acting for 35 when she retired at the age of 41. She had thought about it when her mother died but in the 1930s, she lost her brother and sister, too. Her family was gone. And with it, Mary faded into the background, content with retirement and a quieter pace of life. She did appear on stage in the 1930s and in a series of radio plays for NBC and CBS in 1936, a year in which she became the vice-president of United Artists. Plus, she continued to produce films right up to the 1950s, including one with The Marx Brothers. She may have retired from acting, but the movies remained close to her heart.\n\nLife became very hard for Mary. Like her father, she became an alcoholic, undoubtedly brought on by the loss of her mother and siblings, all in a period of just eight years, followed by the breakup of her marriage, with Douglas dying not long after. She became depressed and difficult to deal with. But you can’t blame her for that. It’s so hard to imagine what she must have felt after so much loss. Over time, she became a recluse and allowed very few visitors to her home.\n\nShe had earned enough money to enjoy retirement and to relax. She published her memoirs in 1955 but by 1965, she was refusing to see any visitors, only speaking to people over the phone. Confined to her bedroom, all alone. She received an Academy Honorary Award in 1976 and the Academy sent a television crew to her house. She let them in, giving the world one last glimpse of one of the greatest actresses who ever lived.\n\nShe continued to host charitable events at her home until May 29th, 1979 when Mary Pickford died at a hospital in Santa Monica, California, from complications from a cerebral haemorrhage. She was interred in the Garden of Memory of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.\n\nShe was 87-years-old.\n\nTimeless\n\nGladys Marie Smith, better known as Mary Pickford, was… above all else… absolutely, insanely rich. A millionaire, several dozen times over, she came to shape the movie business and became the most powerful woman Hollywood has ever seen. She is fondly remembered today, not for the tragic start and tragic end to her life, but for all she packed in to that life.\n\nShe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and her handprints and footprints are displayed at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre. Many theatres and buildings are named in her honour. And where she was born is now a Hospital for Sick Children. And, perhaps most importantly of all, in 2017, to commemorate her 125th birthday, Mary Pickford was honoured with a Google Doodle, a little reminder of one of the most remarkable people who has ever lived.\n\n100 years ago, Mary Pickford was the most powerful woman in Hollywood. A producer, a studio head and a phenomenal force onscreen, a celebrity with the kind of fandom that was unheard of in her day. One of the founders of the Motion Picture Academy, a darling of the silent screen, ‘eternally feminine, but wouldn’t allow herself to be pushed around by anybody’, as one of her biographers put it. She was also a noted philanthropist. Cari Beauchamp, resident scholar at the Mary Pickford Foundation, once said of Mary:\n\n[She played] a girl with spunk, a girl with backbone… she can be poorer than dirt and literally be covered in dirt, and yet she stands up for what is right, she stands up for her community and she has a sense of self that is universal and timeless.\n\nNot many would consider Mary a feminist icon but she is. For who she was, she was not only ahead of her time, but a true trailblazer. She was one of a kind, a unique individual that shaped the very movie business in which she made her name but also a business in which she empowered all actresses and gave them a voice in the silent era.\n\nMary Pickford truly was The Most Powerful Woman in Hollywood.\n\nToodle-Pip :}{:\n\nPost KQ: Comments, Likes & Follows Greatly Appreciated :)\n\nImage (click on it to enlarge): 1) Mary Pickford.
