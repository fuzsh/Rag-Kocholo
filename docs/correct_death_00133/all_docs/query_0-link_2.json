        "text": "Mary Pickford known as “America’s Sweetheart” was one of the few stars to be successful in both the silent and sound film eras. She won an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1929.\n\nMary Pickford married Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. the action-adventure film star actor, screenwriter, director, and producer noted for his swashbuckling roles in such movies as The Mark of Zorro (1920), The Three Musketeers (1921), Robin Hood (1922), The Thief of Baghdad (1924) and The Black Pirate (1926) on March 28, 1920.\n\nThe wedding gift from Fairbanks to his love and “America’s First Movie Star” Mary Pickford was a Beverly Hills hunting lodge in the untamed hills west of Hollywood that would inaugurate an influx of movie-industry residents which would include Rudolf Valentino, Tom Mix, and Will Rogers, among others."
