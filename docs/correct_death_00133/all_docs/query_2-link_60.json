        "text": "On Oct. 3, 1903, Mary Pickford played the Opera House in Cheboygan acting under her given name of Gladys Marie Smith. At the time, Pickford was just 11 years old, already a seasoned actor who had been traveling the vaudeville circuit for four years. The whole Smith Family was on tour, but it was “Baby Gladys,” the girl with the curls, who got the jobs that made them money.\n\n“America’s Sweetheart,” Mary Pickford was actually from Canada. Her father died in a tragic accident, leaving her mother Charlotte struggling to survive, running a boarding house. One of the boarders was the manager of a stock company in Toronto who suggested the three children make money as actors. The Smith family joined the vaudeville circuit touring Ontario and the northern part of the U.S., living on train cars, acting wherever there was a stage and living hand to mouth. “Baby Gladys” quickly made a name for herself as “the cleverest of child actresses on the stage today.”\n\nAt age 11, in Cheboygan, Pickford played a young child in “the Fatal Wedding.” She was tiny for her age. This would be her stock in trade, “blondilocks,” with long golden curls and an angel’s face.\n\nThe Cheboygan Democrat said “The Fatal Wedding” was an enormous hit across the country, but “special mention should be given to the little girl who played the most important role. She could not be more than 10 years old, and her lines were more than those of any other character, but she never faltered for an instant and no one would have done the part better.”\n\nBut the opinionated Cheboygan reporter was disappointed in Mrs. Smith’s decision to take her children out of school and put them in show business. “The parents have neglected all other forms of their education, simply having them to devote their entire time to the stage business.” Little did he know that “Little Gladys” would soon become not only the most famous actress in the world, but one of the shrewdest businesswomen ever.\n\nAfter touring for three years, Pickford, 14, moved to New York to live with a friend and to look for work on Broadway. Her mother and the two other children worked stock theater back in Toronto. They struggled being apart and Pickford was going to call it quits. By herself, she concocted a scheme to meet David Belasco, a famous Broadway producer. It worked. He admired her precocity and charm. And he convinced her to choose a new name.\n\nPickford sent a telegram to her mother: \"Gladys Smith now Mary Pickford. Engaged by David Belasco to appear on Broadway this fall.\" She was cast as a child in “The Warrens of Virginia.”\n\nShe continued to play children until she was almost 30. At 11, she played a 5-year-old. At 28, she played 12-year-old Pollyanna. She also took parts written for boys, including Little Lord Fauntleroy. She first met Douglas Fairbanks on a set where they were both child actors. He thought she was a boy and invited her to come play with his train sets, which she did. They later married.\n\nMary never grew over 5 feet tall. She kept her youthful looks. In her autobiography, “Sunshine and Shadow,” she admitted that as a child she ate the petals one by one, from one rose a day, hoping their smell, color and beauty would somehow get inside her. Other stage tricks to keep her looking young included oversized furniture and a special spotlight that softened her face. She studied the facial expressions of children, noting that children let emotions pass over their faces and never furrowed their brows. Show business loves actors who look younger than they are —they can get more years out of them.\n\nAt first Pickford accepted her fate as a child actor. “I’d already been pigeonholed. I decided to be a semiprecious stone rather than a paste imitation of something more glittering and gorgeous.”\n\nTeen-aged Pickford’s success on Broadway brought her to the attention of DW Griffith of Biograph, who was producing one-reel short films for nickelodeons. Pickford began to play the role of the innocent young ingenue, down on her luck but tough. She continued to play children. She went to California to film when she was 18, arriving just before Hollywood was officially named.\n\nShe was soon cast in the first silent movies and her career skyrocketed. She was the first person to leave her handprints at Grauman’s Chinese Theater. She was the first artist to have her name in marquee lights and the first actress to fly on an airplane in a film. She was the first Hollywood celebrity and the most famous woman in the world.\n\nShe became a trailblazer in the industry. The24-year-old signed a contract to produce the movies she starred in. She was paid $10,000 per week, a record salary in 1916. She co-founded United Artists in 1919, Pickford-Fairbanks Studio in 1920 and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1927.\n\nEventually, Pickford wanted to play adult roles.\n\nShe said, “I’m sick of Cinderella parts, of wearing rags and tatters. I want to wear smart clothes and play the lover.\"\n\nIn 1928, she took her first roll in a talking movie, “The Coquette.” She cut her trademark long curls into a short bob to play a socialite. The world went wild, her haircut making the front page of the New York Times. Pickford won the Academy Award for best actress in “The Coquette,” but Pickford knew her audience. Rather than disappoint the public and let them watch her grow old, Mary dropped out of acting at 36 years old.\n\nShe said, “I was forced to live far beyond my years when just a child, now I have reversed the order and I intend to remain young indefinitely.”\n\nPickford did not like the new talking movies much anyway. She felt that silent films were an elevated art form, like ballet. They did not need words to convey a story. Furthermore, she knew that 40 percent of their film sales were overseas, where people who could understand silent movies would not be able to understand talkies.\n\nPickford did not drop out of show business. After retiring from acting in 1933, she continued to produce films for United Artist. She remained partners in the company, along with Charlie Chaplin, for 20 more years. She sold her shares for millions in 1955.\n\nPickford start her career playing on stages like the Cheboygan Opera House. As a co-founder of United Artist and the Academy of Motion Pictures, and as producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman in business and perhaps the world."
