        "text": "Peter Phillips (born 21 May 1939) is an English artist. His work ranges from conventional oils on canvas to multi-media compositions and collages to sculptures and architecture.\n\nAs an originator of Pop art, Phillips trained at the Royal College of Art with his contemporaries David Hockney, Allen Jones, R.B. Kitaj and others figures in British Pop Art. When he was awarded a Harkness Fellowship he moved to New York, where he exhibited alongside American counterparts Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist. Phillips later returned to Europe, where he now resides and continues to paint and exhibit."
