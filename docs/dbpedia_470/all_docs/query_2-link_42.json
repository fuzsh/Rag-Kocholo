He became Finance Director of BBC News in 1997, before being appointed Chief Operating Officer of that division in 2001. In 2005, he became the BBC’s Director of Business Development, and was responsible for the sale of BBC Broadcast which became Red Bee Media.\n\nIn 2006, Peter moved to Ofcom, the UK's media and communications regulator, where he was a member of the Board. He was responsible for its approach to reshaping regulation in the light of digital developments, and led its work on the future of public service broadcasting, high-speed broadband, and illegal internet file sharing.\n\nIn 2010, Peter moved to Cambridge University Press, the world's oldest media organisation with a global reputation in its academic and educational fields, as Chief Operating Officer. In 2012 he was appointed as the Press's Chief Executive.
