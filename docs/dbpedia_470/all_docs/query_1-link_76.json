        "text": "The Queen's grandson Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn have announced they are to divorce.\n\nA statement issued on their behalf said the decision was \"the best course of action for their two children and ongoing friendship\".\n\nIt confirmed they had separated and will share custody of their children Savannah, nine, and Isla, seven.\n\nBoth of their families were \"sad\" but \"fully supportive\" of the decision to \"co-parent\", the statement added.\n\nThe couple told the Queen and other Royal Family members about their decision last year.\n\nMr Phillips, 42, is the son of Princess Anne and her first husband, Captain Mark Phillips.\n\nHe is the eldest grandchild of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\n\"The decision to divorce and share custody came about after many months of discussions and although sad, is an amicable one,\" the statement read.\n\nIt added: \"Peter and Autumn have requested privacy and compassion for their children while the family continues to adapt to these changes.\"\n\nMr Phillips met Canadian management consultant Autumn Kelly, 41, at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal in 2003, while he was working for the Williams Formula 1 team.\n\nThey married in 2008 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle - where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding would take place ten years later - and brought up their children in Gloucestershire.\n\nBefore the wedding, Mrs Phillips gave up her Catholic faith - a move which, because of rules on royal successions that were later changed, allowed Mr Phillips to retain his right to the throne.\n\nWhile Mr Phillips is a member of the Royal Family, he is not a working royal and does not have a title.\n\nLast month the Daily Mail revealed that he featured in a Chinese television advert endorsing milk from Jersey cows."
