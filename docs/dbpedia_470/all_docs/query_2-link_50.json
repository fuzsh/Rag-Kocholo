        "text": "Unique royals who attended university and achieved a degree?\n\nHave you ever wondered who was the first to graduate university from the royal family and what did they study? We have done some research and found the following information. In the past the royals did not traditionally go to university. Instead, they took up their royal duties after completing their schooling.\n\nKing Charles III\n\nThe first British royal to graduate from university was King Charles III. Attending the Trinity College Cambridge in 1967. He studied history, archaeology, and anthropology for the first part of the tripos.

He was the first legitimate grandchild of a monarch in more than 500 years to be born without a title or courtesy title. This was due to his mother Princess Ann refusing the titles the queen offered. She did this as she felt she could give them a simpler childhood. He attended the University of Exeter and graduated with a degree in sports science. Additionally he played for Exeter University rugby league team.\n\nZara Philips\n\nZara attended the University of Exeter, where she studied physiotherapy. After University Zara went on to pursue an equestrian career.

Subsequently he graduated with a 2.1 in Geography.\n\nPrincess Beatrice\n\nDiagnosed as dyslexic in her youth Princess Beatrice didn’t let this hold her back. She studied at Goldsmiths, University of London. Graduating in 2011 with a 2.1 bachelors degree in history and the history of ideas. Additionally Princess Beatrice is now a patron for the Helen Arkell Dyslexia Centre. She supports springboard for children. This is a literacy project for young children with learning difficulties.\n\nPrincess Eugenie\n\nPrincess Eugenie studied a combined honours degree. This was in Art History, English Literature and Politics at Newcastle University.
