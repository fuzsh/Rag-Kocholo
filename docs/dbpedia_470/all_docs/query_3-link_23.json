        "text": "PETER PHILLIPS\n\n16 July to 5 Sept 2021\n\nA new exhibition from the private collection of pioneering British Pop Artist Peter Phillips.\n\nCreated by Phillips at varying points throughout his exceptional career spanning more than fifty years, the works have travelled with Phillips around the globe, adorning the walls of both his studio and private residences.\n\nAs an originator of the Pop Art movement, Phillips trained at the Royal College of Art in London with his contemporaries David Hockney, Allen Jones and Ronald Kitaj among others. Internationally acclaimed, his work has exhibited in countless solo shows, projects and retrospectives. Having many times exhibited alongside his American counterparts Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, the artists’ friends and contemporaries read like a Who’s Who of 20th Century art.\n\nSays Phillips, “I was painting stuff that was familiar to other people, however it wasn’t imagery that they expected to come from an artist, they thought that an artist painted landscapes and portraits… and I was painting cars and pin up girls and then it ended up being called ‘pop art’. It was a new way of thinking about the world that we live in, exposing particular things that people didn’t even consider as art.”"
