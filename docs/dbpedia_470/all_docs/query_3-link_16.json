During his course there, Phillips saw reproductions of work by Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. Peter Phillips was particularly aligned to American culture and reflected its commercial iconography and aggressive advertising style in his dynamic montage paintings. One of the most important English POP artists, Phillips taught at the Coventry and Birmingham Colleges of Art in 1962 to 1963. In 1963 he was represented at the Paris Biennial. In 1964 his work was included in the Pop Art exhibition shown at the Hague, Vienna and Berlin. From 1964 to 1966 he lived in New York and travelled in the USA with Allen Jones by car and adopted the custom car as a metaphor for the work of the artist. He had his first one-man exhibition at the Kornblee Gallery, New York in 1965 and was invited to contribute three prints to the first major Pop Art Print portfolio, 11 Pop Artists I-III. From 1968 to 1969 he was guest teacher at the Hochschule für Bildende Künste, Hamburg. He travelled in Africa, the Far East and the USA. In 1972 he had a retrospective at the Westfälischer Kunstverein, Münster, and in 1976 at the Tate Gallery, London. In 1977 he had a retrospective in Milan. In 1981 he visited Australia. In 1982-83 he had a retrospective which was shown at six British museums. In 1992-95 he visited Canada and US for exhibitions in cities including Montreal, Boston, Houston and New York.
