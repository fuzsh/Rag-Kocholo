All sections appear to be securely adhered and the canvases are original. There is a slight gap between the right hand panel and the main canvas, where the stretcher has possibly bowed, visible upon close inspection. There are some fine incisions and instances where the surface has been worked, these are in keeping with the Artist's working methods and intentions. There is some slight wear to the corners and extreme edges. There are a small number of isolated instances of fine lines of cracking to the work, most of which are only visible upon close inspection. There is a vertical crack towards the upper edge to the left of centre, with associated small flecks of loss. There is reticulation throughout much of the black pigment, however, some of this may be due to the varnish. There is some inconsistency to the shade and texture of the yellow pigment in places, which may be due either to a discoloured varnish or some fading of pigments. There appears to be an area to the left of the car headlights which has cracked and has possibly been retouched. There are a small number of faint scuffs to the work, predominantly towards the edges. There are some instances of small accretions, studio matter, surface detritus and light surface dirt. There is one vertical line of excess varnish in the lower left quadrant and a raised horizontal thread to the main canvas in the lower third. This excepting, the work appears in very good overall condition. Inspection under ultra violet light reveals fluorescence and probable retouching in the aforementioned area to the left of the car. In addition, there are instances of scattered spot retouchings predominantly focused to the external, adjoined sections of canvas, largely focused on the right vertical edge, To the main canvas there is fluorescence to the aforementioned vertical crack, with a small number of further instances of spot retouchings including to the car. The work is unframed.
