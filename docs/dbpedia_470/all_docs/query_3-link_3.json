His work ranges from oils on canvas to multi-media compositions and collages. As one of the originators of Pop Art, Peter got his start at the Royal College of Arts with his fellow students David Hockney, Allen Jones, R.B. Kitaj and others of the British Pop Art Movement.\n\nWhen he was awarded a Harkness Fellowship he moved to New York, where he exhibited his work alongside his American counterparts Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist. Peterâ€™s work can be seen in dozens of museums and galleries worldwide. He now resides in Australia where he continues to paint and exhibit."
