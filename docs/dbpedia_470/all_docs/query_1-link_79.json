        "text": "Peter Phillips, Elizabeth II’s eldest grandchild, has split from his partner of three years.\n\nMr Phillips, who is the Princess Royal’s son and the King’s nephew, had introduced Lindsay Wallace to the Royal family, inviting her to numerous public events.\n\nThey are now said to have “gone their separate ways”, with The Sun reporting that their relationship “simply ran its course”.\n\nMs Wallace, who is 43 and has two children from a previous relationship, went to school with Mr Phillips’s sister Zara Tindall.\n\nSince they began dating in 2021, after his marriage to Autumn Phillips broke down, they have been seen together at key Royal family events, including the late Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations, Royal Ascot, the christening of Lucas Tindall, Wimbledon and the Coronation Concert.\n\nThey made their first official appearance in June 2022 at the Epsom Derby, visiting after Mr Phillips’ grandmother Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle.\n\nHe had finalised his divorce from Autumn Kelly a year earlier, co-parenting their daughters, Savannah, now 13, and Isla, 12.\n\n“They were friends first because Lindsay is very close to Zara but then the relationship developed into something much closer,” a friend said at the time. “They are really happy together.”\n\nMr Phillips, 46, is the eldest son of the Princess Royal and her former husband Captain Mark Phillips.\n\nHe works as managing director of Sports & Entertainment Ltd (SEL), head of partner acquisition for the rights agency CSM Sport & Entertainment, chairman of City Racing, and is patron of ISPS Handa, which sponsors golf tournaments.\n\nIn March, he was photographed in Bahrain attending the Formula 1 Grand Prix, and gave a television interview in Australia in which he spoke warmly about the Royal family.\n\nThere in his role with ISPS Handa, he told an interviewer the King was in “good spirits” but “frustrated” that his recovery is taking longer than “he would want it to”.\n\nHe also praised the Princess of Wales as “remarkable” and said she and Prince William had “got it right” in balancing their public life and family life.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Phillips declined to comment on reports of his break up with Ms Wallace.\n\n‘Difficult decision’\n\nA friend of the couple told Hello magazine: “Peter and Lindsay made the difficult decision to separate as they were spending less time together with work and family commitments.”\n\nThey added that he had been “away and travelling non-stop” because of business commitments, while she was based in Scotland.\n\nThey added: “It obviously came as a shock as most people thought they were absolutely rock solid, it’s very sad.”"
