        "text": "It looks like love was in the air for Peter Phillips and his new girlfriend Harriet Sperling at the Beaufort Polo Club in Gloucestershire last weekend.\n\nPhillips, eldest son of Princess Anne and ‘favourite grandson’ of the late Queen Elizabeth, has clearly inherited the royal family’s love for all things equine – his first public date with Harriet was at the Badminton Horse Trials last month, and now the two have been hitting it off in the Festival of Polo’s VIP marquee.\n\nHarriet, a writer and an NHS nurse, looked beautiful in blue at the event, which in the past has been a favourite of King Charles. An eyewitness at the event told The Sun that Phillips and Sperling ‘couldn’t keep their hands off each other and didn’t care who was watching.’\n\nCalling the couple ‘loved-up’, they continued, ‘The way things are going we could see them together at Royal Ascot this month, or he could even take her to meet the King and the rest of the Royal Family at Balmoral this summer.’\n\nPeter Phillips has, of course, already introduced Sperling to Queen Camilla. The three were seen laughing and joking in the stands at Badminton. The two looked ‘completely smitten’ at the event according to insiders, with Peter looking like ‘the cat who got the cream’.\n\nIndeed, sources told The Sun that Peter, who’s ‘had his relationship ups and downs in recent years’ is ‘over the moon’ to be settling down with Sperling. The series of romantic dates come just weeks after Princess Anne’s oldest son announced his separation from Lindsay Wallace. According to Hello!, the couple, who had been dating for three years, ‘made the difficult decision to separate as they were spending less time together with work and family commitments. ‘Peter’s business commitments and work in F1 meant he has been away and travelling non stop,’ they continued. Lindsay had joined Peter for many of his royal engagements over the course of their relationship, including the Platinum Jubilee and the Coronation Concert.\n\nPrior to that, Phillips was married for 13 years to Autumn Kelly before their divorce in 2021. The pair have two children together: 13-year-old Savannah Anne Kathleen, the Late Queen’s first great-grandchild, and Isla Elizabeth, 12. The two girls accompanied their father and Sperling to Badminton.\n\nSperling, who is a single mother, has written powerfully about her own experience raising children alone: ‘My daughter and I journeyed 10 years with only each other,’ she said. ‘I liken us to an island and it has often felt hard to imagine anyone joining that island.’ The nurse also spoke of how important her Christian faith was to her during those years, writing that ‘it is often tough parenting alone, but although there is a stigma to endure, God is able to step in and turn it for good.’\n\nRead More\n\n‘I hope I am able to represent you all very soon’: the Princess of Wales issues a personal letter as she apologises for missing a key Trooping the Colour event\n\nKate Middleton has been out of the public eye for a number of months as she receives treatment for cancer\n\nThe couple certainly chose a family affair for their second public date. The Gloucestershire Festival of Polo has long been a favourite of Peter Phillips’ sister Zara Tindall, who has competed in the charity event alongside Prince William, and Princess Anne.\n\nIt is thought that Phillips attended the polo festival in his capacity as patron for Liver and Pancreas Research UK, a role he has held for a decade."
