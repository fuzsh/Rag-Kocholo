        "text": "The royal family is a well-known symbol of the UK. In the past, royals did not traditionally go to university, instead taking up royal duties after completing their schooling. However, these days young members of the British royal family are more likely to head to university before juggling jobs alongside royal engagements and charity work.\n\n1. Prince William, Prince of Wales\n\nThe Prince of Wales studied at the University of St Andrews, in Fife, Scotland, where he initially pursued a degree in art history before switching to geography in his second year. Prince William graduated with a Master of Arts, earning a 2:1. While at university, he played water polo and met his wife, Kate Middleton. The couple lived together with friends during their second year of study.\n\n2. Catherine, Princess of Wales\n\nKate Middleton studied history of art at the University of St Andrews. This was where she first met Prince William. After graduating, she worked part-time as an accessory buyer at the clothing chain Jigsaw and for her family’s party planning business until she married Prince William in 2011. Following her marriage, she became the Duchess of Cambridge, and then the Princess of Wales.\n\n3. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\n\nAmerican actor Meghan Markle became the Duchess of Sussex when she married Prince Harry in May 2018. Before her acting career, the duchess studied theatre and international studies at Northwestern University, near Chicago. During her time as an active royal member she carried out royal duties, worked with charities and supported humanitarian causes.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess chose to step back from active royal duties in 2020 and have since moved to California to raise their two children.\n\nAnd if you’re wondering why her husband is absent from this list, it’s because Prince Harry didn’t go to university. He instead joined the army, after leaving school.\n\n4. Queen Elizabeth II\n\nQueen Elizabeth II didn’t go to university – she and her sister Princess Margaret were the last members of the British royal family to be educated privately at home, as was customary in the past.\n\nThe sisters were taught initially by their governess. Once Princess Elizabeth became heir presumptive, she began receiving private tuition on constitutional history from Henry Marten, vice-provost of Eton College. She also had several native French-speaking governesses who taught her to speak the language fluently. During the Second World War, Queen Elizabeth joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service and studied vehicle maintenance at Aldershot.\n\n5. King Charles III\n\nCharles III was the first UK monarch to achieve a university degree. He attended Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, where he studied anthropology, archaeology and history. He also spent a term at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, (now Aberystwyth University) where he studied Welsh and the history of the principality. While at university, he spent time studying at archaeological sites in France and taking part in excavations in Jersey, in the Channel Islands.\n\nHe was also part of Trinity’s drama group, the Dryden Society, and appeared in two of the society’s annual productions. He received a master’s from the University of Cambridge in 1975.\n\n6. Princess Beatrice\n\nThe daughter of Charles’ brother Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York, Princess Beatrice studied history and the history of ideas at Goldsmiths, University of London. She was diagnosed with dyslexia as a child and has since become a patron for the Helen Arkell Dyslexia Centre and supports Springboard for Children, a literacy project for young children with learning difficulties.\n\n7. Princess Eugenie\n\nPrincess Eugenie is Beatrice’s younger sister and eighth in line to the throne. She attended Newcastle University, where she studied a combined honours degree in art history, English literature and politics. She graduated in 2012 with a degree in English literature and art history.\n\n8. Peter Phillips\n\nPeter Phillips is the eldest son of Anne, the Princess Royal (the younger sister of King Charles) and her first husband, Captain Mark Phillips. Peter attended the University of Exeter and graduated with a degree in sports science. While at Exeter, he played rugby league.\n\nHe and his sister, Zara Tindall, do not have official titles because their parents rejected the Queen’s offer of titles when they were born. They are the only grandchildren of the Queen without titles.\n\n9. Zara Tindall\n\nZara Tindall, Peter Phillips’ sister, also attended the University of Exeter, where she studied physiotherapy. The horsewoman has won an Olympic silver medal and received an MBE for her services to equestrianism in 2007.\n\n10. Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh"
