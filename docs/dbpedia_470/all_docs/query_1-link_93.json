        "text": "The grandchildren of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip are an exclusive club. Only eight in number, they grew up in what is arguably the most famous family in the world, and they have experienced levels of privilege and scrutiny few can understand.\n\nThe royal cousins were raised with protocols and rituals that seem archaic to normal families. “I curtsey to her every time I see her,” the queen’s eldest granddaughter, Zara Tindall, once said. “The thing with my grandmother is she is still my grandmother and she’s very approachable, but she’s also from an era where that was how it was done.”\n\nBut once the formalities were over, Queen Elizabeth II was simply her grandchildren’s beloved “Granny.”\n\n“Behind closed doors, she’s our grandmother, it’s as simple as that,” Prince Harry once noted.\n\nIn her later years, her grandchildren—and later, their children, the newest addition to the royal family tree—were the apple of Queen Elizabeth’s eye. “She just loves having us around,” Princess Eugenie has explained.\n\nAs children, the cousins were often together, exploring the grounds of various royal palaces and engaging in play-fighting on the balcony during formal events. “We had a lot of fun and there was a lot of space for kids to run around,” the queen’s eldest grandson, Peter Phillips, once recalled. “So, there was quite a gang of us growing up in that age and it was a lot of fun. We caused quite a bit of mayhem and chaos.”\n\nDuring their youth, the cousins were often spotted out together at night clubs, sporting events, and music festivals. As they have settled into adulthood, many have remained close, sharing a group chat on WhatsApp, playing beer pong, and bringing their children together for playdates. They have also emotionally supported each other. In a recent episode of Mike Tindall’s podcast The Good, the Bad, and the Rugby, Prince William recalled his emotional reaction when his cousin Zara won the gold as an equestrian.\n\n“The only time I’ve ever cried when watching sport was when Zara won, I think it was the European championship,” Prince William told Tindall. “I was down in Exmoor at the time, camping. We were all huddled around the phone watching it. She was there, she was blubbing away, the flag was going up. I was in pieces.”\n\nThey have been there for each other in times of great sorrow as well. On September 17, 2022, the world watched as Queen Elizabeth’s eight grandchildren joined together to stand vigil over the coffin of their beloved Granny. As the family enters a new era under King Charles, join us as we explore the lives of Queen Elizabeth’s grandchildren, from oldest to youngest.\n\nPeter Phillips\n\nThe oldest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, Peter Phillips was born on November 15, 1977. His parents, Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips, declined royal titles for their children. One of the least publicly visible of the queen’s grandchildren, Phillips attended the University of Exeter. Following in his parents’ sporty footsteps, he currently works at the sports management company SEL UK.\n\nIn 2008, Phillips married Autumn Kelly, a Canadian. Their daughter Savannah (Queen Elizabeth’s first great-grandchild) was born in 2010. Their second daughter, Isla, was born in 2012. The couple divorced in 2021. Phillips is now dating Lindsay Wallace, a close friend of his sister Zara.\n\nIn 2020, Phillips was criticized for starring in a Chinese TV ad promoting Jersey Fresh Milk. In the commercial, he sits in front of a backdrop of an English estate and takes a glass of milk from a butler. According to the Daily Mail, in a longer video accompanying the ad, he speaks about visiting his grandmother’s Windsor estate, where a herd of Jersey cattle are bred.\n\nPhillips is currently 18th in the line of succession.\n\nZara Tindall\n\nBorn May 15, 1981, Zara Tindall is Queen Elizabeth’s first granddaughter. Once known as a wild child in her youth (she even sported a tongue piercing), her parents, Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips, gave her and her brother, Peter, leeway to grow up as private citizens. “I’m very lucky that both my parents decided to not use the title and we grew up and did all the things that gave us the opportunity to do,” Tindall told The Times in a 2015 interview.\n\nA talented equestrian, Tindall won a silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She married rugby star Mike Tindall in 2011. “First actual date, just went out for lunch locally,” Mike has said. “And ended up being quite a boozy one. Then we figured out that we both quite like getting smashed. It was a good start.”\n\nZara has been open about fertility struggles, specifically the pain of suffering two miscarriages. “It was a time when my family came to the fore and I needed them,” she said in 2018. The Tindalls welcomed their first daughter, Mia, in 2014. Their second daughter, Lena, was born in 2018, followed by son Lucas in 2021.\n\nThe Tindalls have numerous brand deals, and Zara’s include Land Rover, Rolex, and the outdoor clothing brand Musto. She is now 21st in the line of succession.\n\nPrince William, Prince of Wales\n\nCurrently first in line to the throne, Prince William was born on June 21, 1982. The first child of Prince Charles and Princess Diana saw his grandmother as more than just a family member. “She may be my grandmother, but she is also very much the boss,” he once said.\n\nAccording to Prince William, despite her stoic reputation, the queen was not afraid of telling off her wild grandchildren when it was necessary. “We were chasing Zara around, who was on a go-kart. Peter and I managed to herd Zara into a lamppost and the lamppost came down and nearly squashed her,” Prince William recalled in 2021. “I remember my grandmother being the first person out at Balmoral running across the lawn in her kilt, [she] came charging over and gave us the most almighty bollocking, and that sort of stuck in my mind from that moment on.”\n\nPrince William married Kate Middleton in 2011. They have three children. Prince George was born in 2013. Princes Charlotte was born in 2015, and Prince Louis came along in 2018. The three Wales children are often photographed being mischievous with their Phillips and Tindall cousins, continuing the family tradition.\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex\n\nThe fifth in the line of succession, Prince Harry was born on September 15, 1984. When his mother, Princess Diana, died in 1997, it was said that his grandfather Prince Philip was deeply worried about how the funeral would impact his grandsons. “It’s about the boys,” he reportedly cried. “They’ve lost their mother.”\n\nAs a show of support, Prince Philip decided to walk with his grandsons, Charles, and Diana’s brother Charles Spencer in a procession behind the casket. “I’ll walk if you walk,” he reportedly told the boys.\n\nPrince Harry married American actor Meghan Markle in 2018. They have two children, Prince Archie, born in 2019, and Princess Lilibet, born in 2021.\n\nAlthough the Sussexes resigned as working royals in 2020 and now live in California, Prince Harry is said to still be close to his cousin Princess Eugenie, who was friends with Meghan before she met Harry. “They’re still the best of friends,” an insider told People earlier this year, “and talk constantly.\"\n\nPrincess Beatrice of York\n\nPrincess Beatrice was born on August 8, 1988. Ninth in the current line of succession, she is the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson. A graduate of Goldsmiths, University of London, she is currently the vice president of partnerships and strategy at the tech company Afiniti.\n\nWhen Beatrice married Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in 2020, she wore a repurposed gown belonging to Queen Elizabeth II. They couple welcomed a daughter, Sienna Mapelli Mozzi, in 2021. Beatrice is an ambassador for the charity Made by Dyslexia and has been open about her own learning challenges with dyslexia.\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022, Princess Beatrice and her sister, Eugenie, released a moving tribute that read, in part: “Thank you for making us laugh, for including us, for picking heather and raspberries, for marching soldiers, for our teas, for comfort, for joy. You, being you, will never know the impact you have had on our family and so many people around the world.\"\n\nPrincess Eugenie of York\n\nThe second child of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, Princess Eugenie, nicknamed “Euge,” was born on March 23, 1990. Eugenie attended Newcastle University and is currently a director at the prestigious art gallery Hauser & Wirth. She also cofounded the Anti-Slavery Collective.\n\nPrincess Eugenie married Jack Brooksbank in 2018. She chose to wear a wedding gown that showed the scar on her back, a remnant of a surgery for scoliosis when she was 12. “I believe scars tell a story about your past and your future, and it’s a way to get rid of a taboo,” she said.\n\nThe couple welcomed their first son, August, in 2021. Their second son, Ernest, was born in 2023.\n\nPrincess Eugenie is among the most active of the queen’s grandchildren on Instagram, and often makes posts praising her family members. When her grandfather Prince Philip died in 2021, she posted this loving tribute: “I remember learning how to cook, how to paint, what to read. I remember laughing at your jokes and asking about your spectacular life and service in the Navy. I remember incinerating the sausages and you swooping in to save the day. I remember your hands and your laugh and your favourite beer.”\n\nPrincess Eugenie is currently 11th in line to the throne.\n\nLady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor\n\nQueen Elizabeth’s youngest granddaughter, Lady Louise, was born on November 9, 2003. She is the eldest child of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones. Currently 16th in the line of succession, Louise was premature and born with esotropia, which causes the eyes to look inward. She went through surgeries during her childhood to correct the condition.\n\nLouise was close to her grandfather Prince Philip and shares his love of carriage driving. She is said to be “down-to-earth,” and reportedly worked at a garden center to earn money for her first car. She is currently a student at University of St. Andrews, where her cousin Prince William and his wife, Princess Catherine, also studied."
