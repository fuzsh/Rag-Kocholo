        "text": "Prince Philip: Peter Phillips discusses gifts for his grandfather\n\nQueen Elizabeth II’s eldest grandchild appeared on Love Your Weekend with Alan Titchmarsh on Sunday. Peter Phillips, the son of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips, joined the gardening enthusiast to talk about the summer’s biggest equestrian event — the Festival of British Eventing, which was hosted by the Princess Royal on the grounds of her Gloucestershire home, Gatcombe Park. Like his mother and sister, Peter grew up horseriding and, while he did not pursue a professional career in the sport, he still shares a passion for all things equestrian.\n\nAnne and her daughter Zara Tindall both had great success in their horseriding careers, with the princess being named BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1971 and Zara being the first royal to win an Olympic medal in 2012.\n\nThey and Peter, who organises the Festival of British Eventing, are not the only members of the Royal Family who grew up with a love for the sport.\n\nIn fact, most members of the family start horseriding from a young age, a hobby understood to be greatly encouraged by the Queen, who was given her first horse at the age of four.\n\nBoth the Queen and her late husband Prince Philip shared a passion for the equestrian world, with Her Majesty being a keen rider well into her nineties, and the Duke of Edinburgh who was a pioneer for carriage driving.\n\nREAD MORE: Camilla's 'unflinching' response to Diana's 'bold' confrontation over Charles affair\n\nIt is understood that the Queen and Philip had a soft spot for their eldest grandchild, who has often been described as their “favourite”.\n\nHowever, according to a royal biographer, Peter once devastated his grandfather after making a heartbreaking personal decision.\n\nAccording to Ingrid Seward, author of ‘Prince Philip Revealed, Philip was “saddened” by the dissolution of Peter’s marriage to Autumn Phillips and their decision to divorce.\n\nIn her book, Ms Seward wrote: “Philip comes from the generation that puts up and shuts up.\n\n“To his mind and that of the Queen’s it has always been that divorce is the very last resort.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And she's already met the Queen, sources close to the pair have confirmed.\n\nLearn more about Peter Phillips' new romance, who she is and how they met, here.\n\n“Having cautioned the couple to try to make it work for a two-year period when it eventually fell apart, he [Philip] knew there was nothing more to do except tell them to just get on with it.”\n\nIn February 2020, Peter and Autumn announced that they were officially separating. A year later, in June 2021, the couple’s divorce was finalised.\n\nPeter and Autumn, who were married for 13 years, have two daughters together — 11-year-old Savannah and 10-year-old Isla.\n\nAt the time of their split, the couple released a statement, which read: “After informing HM The Queen and members of both families last year, Peter and Autumn jointly agreed to separate,” said a spokesperson for the pair.\n\n“Both families were naturally sad at the announcement but fully supportive of Peter and Autumn in the joint decision to co-parent their children.”\n\nTheir divorce came a couple of months after the death of the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nIn April 2021, Philip died at the age of 99.\n\nIn her book, Ms Seward claimed Peter and Philip shared a close bond, saying: “According to a member of staff, the Duke became more cantankerous in his old age.\n\n“The only one that could cheer him up was Peter, who used to love duck flighting with his grandfather.”\n\nIt’s thought they still “played games” and “teased each other” up until Philip’s passing.\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nMeghan and Harry 'determined' to show that 'their way is the best way' [INSIGHT]\n\nLilibet and Archie to be given special ‘roles’ in upcoming ceremony[REVEAL]\n\nMeghan and Harry warning over entering the 'lion's den' on UK return [ANALYSIS]\n\nPeter, who was one of the 30 guests at the prince’s funeral, later opened up about his grandfather’s impact on his life.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC in July 2021, the Duke’s eldest grandson described Philip as a “hugely influential fixture in our lives”.\n\nHe said: “Even though he was 99 years old, he lived a remarkable life and I think if any of us can even live half the life that he did, we would all be extraordinarily happy.\n\n“He was such a fixture in all of our lives and of course, it's sad, of course, we miss him.\"\n\nSpeaking about his two daughters, he added: “They're exceptionally lucky to have had two great-grandparents who have lived as long as they have.\n\n“My children certainly appreciate that and know that it's something special.”\n\nPeter spoke to the BBC ahead of the Gatcombe Park Food and Drink Festival, which — like the Festival of British Eventing — is also held at his mother's Gloucestershire home.\n\nHe said that his own passion for the countryside had come from his late grandfather."
