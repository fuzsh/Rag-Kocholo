        "text": "Peter Philips, a visionary Belgian makeup artist, holds the prestigious title of Creative and Image Director for Christian Dior Makeup. Since stepping into this role in March 2014, Philips has expressed his honor and respect for the brand’s values, savoir-faire, and innovation, becoming an integral part of Dior’s creative journey. His tenure at Dior has seen him mastermind the makeup for the brand’s runway shows, alongside collaborations with luxury houses such as Louis Vuitton and Chanel, and editorial work for Vogue Italia.\n\nBefore his current role at Dior, Philips was at the helm of Chanel’s makeup and beauty lines until 2013, where he led product development and crafted the iconic makeup looks for Chanel’s campaigns and runway presentations.\n\nEducated at the Royal Academy Antwerp, Philips found himself in the company of future fashion luminaries like Raf Simons and Willy Vanderperre during his studies. Although he initially pursued fashion design, a serendipitous encounter with a makeup team backstage at a fashion show sparked his interest in makeup artistry as a career. This revelation led him to switch paths, embarking on a journey that would establish him as one of the most selective and inventive makeup artists in the fashion industry.\n\nPhilips’ career is marked by his creativity and willingness to experiment. Notably, an impromptu decision to sketch Mickey Mouse onto a model’s face during a shoot with Vanderperre resulted in one of his most memorable works. Additionally, his dramatic oversized red lips for Alexander McQueen’s AW09 show further cemented his status as a makeup artist capable of blending artistry with high fashion.\n\nPeter Philips continues to influence the beauty world through his innovative approach and artistic collaborations, reshaping our understanding of makeup’s role in fashion and beyond."
