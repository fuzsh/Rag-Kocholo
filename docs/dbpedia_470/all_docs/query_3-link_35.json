Rock also appears as though he is the conductor/artist/producer on a number of the Tallis Scholars/Peter Phillips choral release, which I doubt is the case. He also appears as producer on a number of other ‘Classical’ releases, if that is what the appearance of those albums on Pete Rock’s ‘Production’ screen signifies."
