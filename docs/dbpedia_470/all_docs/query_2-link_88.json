        "text": "The eminent writer Simon Schama has described Cindy Sherman as ‘an anatomist of self-consciousness, a collector of living masks.’ The artist, whose work since the early 1970s has concentrated on ‘series’ of meticulously composed self-portraits using costumes and make-up to transform her identity – sometimes abstracting the image to such an extent that the human ‘subject’ is completely effaced – has possibly one of the most recognised names in the art world, but certainly the least recognised face.\n\nWorking in almost obsessive isolation, resolutely sourcing accessories, costumes, make-up and prosthetics for each new identity, the 60-year-old Sherman calls upon a wide range of cinematic, pictorial and personal influences to construct her frame, whether it be a rear-projected Tippi Hedren-like Hitchcock heroine, an illicit scene or gesture from a 1960s De Sica or Antonioni movie, Hans Bellmer’s sexually charged yet childlike deconstructed dolls, the kitsch, nightmarish scenarios of a Dario Argento giallo, the gore and grotesque of Jan Švankmajer’s stop-frame animated fairy tales or the lascivious grimace of Caravaggio’s Young Sick Bacchus. Along the way, Sherman’s little shop of horrors has become one of the most unsettling and unforgettable oeuvres of modern times, and the artist one of the most influential of the last half-century.\n\nAnd it is an oeuvre which – on the surface at least – makes Belgian make-up maestro Peter Philips’ own relationship to beauty and transformation almost laughably conventional. The former fashion-design student at Antwerp’s Royal Academy of Fine Arts (alongside industry luminaries such as Dior couturier, Raf Simons, photographer, Willy Vanderperre and stylist, Olivier Rizzo) was named Creative and Image Director of Christian Dior Make-up in 2014, following a tenure as Chanel Make-up’s Global Creative Director between 2008 and 2013.\n\nPhilips’ reputation in the industry as an unparalleled cosmetic artist was initially forged in the late 1990s. His daring experiments with radical young creatives such as Raf Simons, for whom he infamously face painted a perfect-scale Mickey Mouse, landed him work with venerated photographers such as Irving Penn. At the helm of Chanel and now Dior, Philips has created not only many of the world’s most visionary beauty products but also the most coveted, with every season of sell-out cosmetics redefining how women across the world make their own daily transformations. Intrigued by the parallel and contradictory impulses between two artists whose careers, though disparate, have both been dedicated to cosmetic transformation, System invited Peter Philips to visit Cindy Sherman in her New York City studio.\n\nSurrounded by carefully arranged shelves of vintage wax mannequin heads, torsos with glass eyes and exquisitely applied rouge and lipstick, boxes of platinum marcel-waved and beehived wigs, prosthetic breasts and other mysterious, unidentifiable protuberances, a conversation about their own respective methodologies and approaches to identity and aesthetics, to appearance and transformation, to the beautiful and the grotesque, begins to take shape."
