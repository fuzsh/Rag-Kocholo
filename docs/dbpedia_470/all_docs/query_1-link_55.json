This is a workshop for singers of a high level who will work the repertoire in reduced groups as well as in the whole choir.\n\nThere is a limit on the number of places and a selection process to guarantee the quality. Pre-formed groups are also invited to apply.\n\nCONTEXT AND REPERTOIRE\n\nVictoria and Vivanco were, most probably, choristers in Avila Cathedral together. Vivanco was probably born in 1551 and Victoria in 1548 (the dates of birth are not known exactly) and therefore it is likely that they sang together for a year or two as seises in the cathedral choir. Later in life, both took holy orders and worked as priests, dedicating their lives to the composition of sacred music. Since Saint Teresa was born in 1515, also in Ávila, they surely came into contact with her.\n\nAnother curiosity is that during their lifetimes, it was Vivanco who was much better known than Victoria, who spent much of his life outside Spain, but History has swapped these roles. Today it is Victoria who is much more famous, with the music of Vivanco being perhaps somewhat unjustly neglected in the repertoire of the groups specializing in Spanish renaissance music.\n\nThe works to be studied in the Seminar are those pieces composed for triple choir by both composers.\n\nThis is, therefore, an unusual project for various reasons:\n\n. Assumes a high technical level (triple choir works), which are not easy to be performed by either amateur choirs, or by professionals, without a high level and resources.\n\n. Brings together the work of two Avila composers, contmpories of each other and of Saint Teresa, which allows the comparison of their triple choir works, knowing that Victoria was studying and working in Rome for twenty years, subject to the influence of the Italian composers of the time, whilst Vivanco always stayed in Spain.\n\n. Offers the possibility to work on these pieces and also perform them in the same city where both composers spent their childhood years and received their initial musical training.\n\n. Enables high-level choral singers to work with one of the most globally renowned specialists in renaissance choral music as is Peter Phillips and with a specialist in the interpretation of Victoria as is Rupert Damerell.\n\n. There will also be a third British director, the young award-winning composer and choir director Alexander Campkin, who will work with the reduced groups of singers.\n\nThe seminar will begin with Rupert Damerell and Alexander Campkin, with Peter Phillips joining on 21 August.\n\nThe seminar will have approximately 30 teaching hours.\n\nREPERTOIRE\n\nThe works to be studied are the following:\n\nMusic for triple choir by Victoria and Vivanco\n\nVictoria\n\nLaetatus Sum, Misa Laetatus Sum, Magnificat sexti toni\n\nVivanco\n\nChristus Factus Est, Pater Dimitte Illis, O Quam Suavis\n\nREGISTRATION AND MATRICULATION\n\nThere are two modes of registration and matriculation:\n\n.
