        "text": "By Al Myers\n\nI have known Peter Phillips from Australia for many years. We have competed with each other many times in IAWA world competitions, with the first being at the 2007 IAWA World Championships in Christchurch, New Zealand. At that World Championships we had an epic battle on the platform. Peter lifted unbelievable, winning the overall best lifter award. I was behind him in second place in the overall standings which I felt great about, as he lifted like superman.\n\nPeter has been a major leader, contributer, and competitor in the ARWLWA, centered out of the Belmont Club in Perth, Australia. Peter has been involved with all round weightlifting for many years, both with the “old group” and the new generation of all rounders in Perth. He’s currently serving as President of the ARWLWA. He’s also a major leader in IAWA – serving as a past meet promoter, IAWA Vice President representing Australia, and serving on the IAWA Technical Committee. He’s competed in many IAWA Championship events through the years, with overseas trips to England, Scotland, New Zealand, and the USA.\n\nHowever, on his trip to the USA to take part in the 2016 World Championships, Art’s Birthday Bash, and the Gold Cup, I got to know him much better than ever before. At Lebanon we both stayed at the same hotel and we went out to eat several times together (along with having a few beers!), and at the Gold Cup Peter stayed at my house. We really got to know each other “off the platform” during this hectic month of IAWA competitions. In getting equipment ready for the Gold Cup I don’t know what I would have done without his assistance. He helped me get everything ready, loaded on the trailer, set up at the meet, and even unloading everything once I got it back to the gym! Plus his insight as a meet promoter helped me identify things that was needed for the meet. While he was here I introduced him to a few country past-times of mine – fishing, shooting trap, riding 4-wheelers, and a relaxing afternoon drive in one of our native grass pastures enjoying the peace and quiet of nature.\n\nAfter the Gold Cup we had time to catch a few workouts in together at the Dino Gym. Our training styles and training philosophies are very similiar. We spent alot of time discussing training, specifically how it applies to all round weightlifting. Peter is a great training partner – but the logistics of living 10,500 miles apart will hinder our training together! I introduced him to the Neck Lift, as well as doing some harness lifting. Peter’s a natural at this type of lifting. I have a challenge lift at the Dino Gym which consists of a two huge train wheels connected with a heavy bar. The preset loaded weight of this challenge is 1500 pounds (actually a few pounds more, I rounded down). These train wheels sit by the front door of the Dino Gym and most people just look at them as they come into the gym. Only a few have actually lifted them throughout the years. After getting done with a harness lifting session I challenged Peter to take them on. Of course Peter is not one to back down from a challenge! Now I want to mention that these Train Wheels are very tippy, and it’s more difficult than lifting on a regular heavy bar. Peter lifted them with ease. I even had him do it a second time so I could get a good picture!\n\nWe had such a good time I hated to see him leave. I know we will be lifelong friends.\n\nBy Al Myers\n\nI was honored to be able to promote the IAWA Gold Cup this year. The Gold Cup has had a prestigious past, with many great meet promoters putting on top notch shows. These past promotors set the bar high for me! I felt everything went very well. There was lots of great lifting and many new IAWA World Records set. Right now I feel a sense of relief that the meet is over and it was a success!\n\nWe had one Junior Lifter, my daughter Molly Myers. Molly started the event with a tremendous back squat of 110 KGS. She did this lift without knee wraps and a belt (she forgot her belt!). One thing that makes the Gold Cup very special is that it is a true World event every year. Peter Phillips made the trip from Perth, Australia to do a 155KG Thumbless Grip Deadlift. Timo Lauttamus represented Finland and performed an amazing 100KG Little Finger Hacklift. Steve Gardner from England started the meet off with a 80KG Middle Fingers Straddle. Karen Gardner from England continues to show her many all round lifting skills by lifting 32.5KG in the Hands Together Bench Press. George Dick from Scotland always keeps the crowd entertained, and in the process set a new World Record with a 45KG Dumbbell & Barbell Anyhow. A couple of other lifters that really stood out included Eric Todd with a 60KG Lying Lateral Raise and 89 year old Art Montini with a 80 KG Deadlift.\n\nFor the past several years an outstanding Best Lifter of the Gold Cup has been awarded. The award is named the Howard Prechtel Memorial Award, in honor of Howard Prechtel for starting the Gold Cup many years ago. This year’s winner was Timo Lauttamus with his outstanding Little Fingers Hack. Second Place went to LaVerne Myers, and third place went to Peter Phillips.\n\nI have many people who I need to thank for helping me throughout the weekend. First up is my dad LaVerne. He served as co-promoter for the Gold Cup and really helped coordinating the meet venue and hosting several lifters at his home. My wife Leslie catered the meal herself, and did an excellent job. I may be biased but I felt the banquet meal was one of the best ever! I especially want to thank the crew that helped with loading and setup – Brad Wehling, Jason Lahr, and Kyle Jones. I couldn’t believe we did the meet set up in only an hour. Steve Gardner was brilliant on the microphone all day as well as doing all the scorekeeping. My buddies Chad and Thom helped so much as well. Lastly, I can’t say enough about all the help I got from Peter Phillips. Peter was spending the week with me and I put him to work! Peter helped me get all the equipment ready and loaded the day before, helped with set up and tear down, officiated all day, and then helped me unload everything once I got it back home. He was my right-hand man! I especially want to thank all the lifters that took part in this event.\n\nThis day was a great day in the history of the IAWA.\n\nMeet Results:\n\n2016 IAWA Gold Cup\n\nAbilene Civic Center\n\nAbilene, KS, USA\n\nOctober 22nd, 2016\n\nMeet Promoters: Al Myers and LaVerne Myers\n\nAnnouncer and Scorekeeper: Steve Gardner\n\nOfficials (3-official system used): George Dick, Peter Phillips, Denny Habecker, Dennis Mitchell, Chad Ullom, LaVerne Myers, Al Myers, Thom Van Vleck\n\nLoaders: Chad Ullom, Al Myers, Jason Lahr, Dean Ross, Molly Myers\n\nResults (PDF) – iawa-gold-cup\n\nby Al Myers\n\nWhen I was in Australia for the IAWA Gold Cup, meet promoter John Mahon hosted the very first International Old Time Strongman Challenge following the meet. I was very excited to see this – as OTSM was started in the USAWA 5 years ago and now other countries in IAWA are getting interested in it. The founding concept of OTSM is to bridge strongman with All Round Weightlifting by contesting lifts/movements that were favorites of famous Old Time Strongmen and contest them by following the basic format of a weightlifting meet instead of a strongman competition. This means having lifts that can be loaded with the weight of the lifter’s choosing, and allowing 3 attempts to accomplish a max. Also as part of these OTSM lifts rule infractions in the rulebook are a minimum and a lifter is on a 1 minute clock to perform a legal lift.\n\nThis was a truly international OTSM challenge. Lifters from Australia, England and the USA took part. The challenge had a good variety of lifts with the Anderson Squat, the Apollon’s Lift, and the People’s Deadlift being the events contested. The venue was outside on the lawn of the Belmont Club. It was a beautiful sunny day for the competition which added to the enjoyment of lifting. Very rarely do you get a chance to lift outside. It’s a special moment when that does happen.\n\nSteve Gardner was appointed the head official and I assumed the role of timekeeper. The Anderson Squat was the first event. John had perfect stands for this event which allowed the plates to be rested on elevated stands. Graham “Big Red” Saxton took control early with a big 260 KG Anderson Squat! John Mahon put up the biggest Anderson Squat with a 300 KG. For the Apollon’s Lift, Peter Phillips had made up a beautiful set of replica Apollon’s Wheels for the event. This made this OTSM event even more authentic! Denny Habecker “Steinborned” the axle to achieve a very fine lift of 56 KG’s. Newcomer Alex Biason performed a very solid 81 kilograms in the Apollon’s Lift. The People’s Deadlift was very exciting. I knew beforehand several of the lifter’s would be very close in poundage and it would be a showdown for top lift. Indeed it turned out that way. Alex hit 215 KG followed by Graham at 225. John and Peter finished off tied with 250 KG each.\n\nWhen all the dust settled, John Mahon came out as the overall champion, followed by Graham Saxton in second, and the USAWA OTSM reigning champion Denny Habecker in third. I was very pleased to see all participating countries represented in the top three in the inaugural international Old Time Strongman Challenge. An award was given to the lifter with the top total poundage, and that also went to John with a 656 total.\n\nI was so impressed with this event following the Gold Cup that I plan to host the second international OTSM Challenge following the Gold Cup next year during my promotion.\n\nMEET RESULTS\n\n2015 International OTSM Challenge\n\nNovember 29th, 2015\n\nBelmont Sports and Recreational Club\n\nPerth, Australia\n\nMeet Promoter: John Mahon\n\nHead Official: Steve Gardner\n\nScorekeeper: Sharni Clifford\n\nLifts: Anderson Squat, Apollon’s Lift, People’s Deadlift\n\nLifter Age BWT SQ Apo DL TOT PTS John Mahon 32 115.8 300 106 250 656 515.1 Graham Saxton 53 121.0 260 71 225 556 486.9 Denny Habecker 73 89.9 160 56 172.5 388.5 467.4 Alex Biason 48 118.2 230 81 215 526 445.6 Peter Phillips 62 104.5 120 66 250 436 443.8"
