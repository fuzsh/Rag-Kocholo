        "text": "A prominent figure in British Pop art, Peter Phillips studied at Londonâ€™s Royal College of Art alongside contemporaries such as David Hockney, Allen Jones and R.B. Kitaj, among others. Upon receiving the Harkness Scholarship to study in New York, he had the opportunity to exhibit with his American counterparts Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist. His interest in everyday objects, mass consumerism and experimentation with digital techniques is reflected in his work through the image of the tyre and what it represents."
