The first half begins with Lent, in the Lamentations of White, and proceeds to the upheaval of an Earthquake, an event associated with the Crucifixion. David Lang originally wrote sun-centered to accompany Antoine Brumel's Earthquake Mass, deciding to focus on Galileo's battle with the church authorities over whether the earth revolves around the sun, or vice versa, carrying into this narrative the fragility of human existence.\n\nOur second half ends with a gentler view of Christian teaching, though befpre that the trauma associated with Lent is continued in Nico Muhly's Recordare, a setting of the Lamentations, written for the Tallis Scholars. But then the mood lightens, with music in praise of Jesus (Parson's O bone Jesu) and Mary (Ave Maria and Regina caeli), before the Byrd Propers for All Saints remind us that the desired end of life is to stand, with the Saints, before God, who is the origin of light. The beautiful music of Justorum animae—one of Byrd's most performed motets—assures the righteous of their place in heaven; while the final Beati mundo corde affirms that the clean of heart 'shall see God.'"
