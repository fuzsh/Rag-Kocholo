        "text": "British businessman (born 1977)\n\nFor other people named Peter Phillips, see Peter Phillips (disambiguation).\n\nPeter Mark Andrew Phillips (born 15 November 1977) is a British businessman. He is the son of Anne, Princess Royal, and Captain Mark Phillips, the eldest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, and a nephew of King Charles III. At the time of his birth, he was 5th in the line of succession to the British throne; as of February 2024, he is 18th.\n\nPhillips attended the University of Exeter before working at Jaguar Racing. He is a managing director for SEL UK, a boutique sports management company. He married Autumn Kelly, a Canadian management consultant, in 2008 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. They have two children together, separated in 2019, and divorced in 2021.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nPeter Phillips was born at 10:46 am on 15 November 1977, in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, London.[1][2] He was the first child of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips, who had married in 1973.[2] At the time of his birth, there was a 41-gun salute from the Tower of London.[2] He was baptised on 22 December 1977 by the Archbishop of Canterbury Donald Coggan in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace.[3] His godparents were his maternal uncle, Prince Charles; Geoffrey Tiarks; Captain Hamish Lochore; Lady Cecil Cameron of Lochiel and Jane Holderness-Roddam.[4]\n\nPhillips was fifth in line to the throne at birth and remained so until the birth of his cousin Prince William in 1982. His parents were said to have refused offers from his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II that would have led to his being born in the peerage. Phillips was the first legitimate grandchild of a monarch in more than 500 years to be born without a title or courtesy title.[2][5] Phillips has a younger sister, Zara Tindall (née Phillips; born 1981), and two younger half-sisters, Felicity Wade (née Tonkin; born 1985),[6] the daughter of Mark Phillips and his former mistress Heather Tonkin; and Stephanie Phillips (born 1997), the daughter from his father's second marriage to Sandy Pflueger.\n\nPhillips went to Port Regis Prep School in Shaftesbury, Dorset before following some of his family by attending Gordonstoun School in Moray, Scotland. Whilst at Gordonstoun, he was chosen to be head boy.[7] During his gap year, he went to Sydney and worked for Sports Entertainment Limited (SEL), a company to which he would later return; he also worked for Jackie Stewart's Formula One racing team during that time.[8] Phillips represented Scotland at rugby union at youth and junior level in the mid-1990s.[9]\n\nHe attended the University of Exeter and graduated with a degree in Sports Science.[10] He played for the Exeter University rugby league team.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter his graduation in 2000, Phillips worked for Jaguar as corporate hospitality manager and then for Williams racing team, where he was sponsorship accounts manager.[7][10][11] He left Williams in September 2005, for a job as a manager at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh.[10] In March 2012, he left RBS to take on a role as managing director at SEL UK.[12]\n\nIn August 2012, he was guest of honour at the Rugby league Challenge Cup Final between Warrington Wolves and Leeds Rhinos at Wembley.[13]\n\nIn the year leading up to June 2016, Phillips was responsible for organising the \"Patron's Lunch\", in celebration of the Queen's 90th birthday. It included a parade down The Mall and a hamper picnic for 10,000 guests.[14]\n\nIn January 2020, Phillips appeared in an advertisement for Chinese company Bright Food. In the video, he uses his status as a \"British royal family member\" to promote the company's milk, while surrounded by luxury.[15]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nPhillips dated Elizabeth Lorio, a cod liver oil heiress from the United States, for two years. In 2001 they lived together for eight months.[16] Later, he had a four-month relationship with Tara Swain, a flight attendant.[17]\n\nIn 2003, Phillips met Autumn Kelly, a Canadian management consultant, at the Formula 1 Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal.[7] Their engagement was announced on 28 July 2007.[10][16][19]\n\nKelly, who was raised in the Catholic Church, was received into the Church of England before her marriage. If she had been Roman Catholic at the time of the marriage, Phillips would have lost his place in the line of the succession to the throne because of since-repealed[20] terms of the Act of Settlement 1701.[21][22][23] Shortly before their wedding, the couple were interviewed and photographed by Hello! magazine, and were reported to have been paid £500,000, resulting in some concern in royal circles.[24][25][26] They married on 17 May 2008 at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.[26][27] The service was conducted by David Conner, the Dean of Windsor.[28] The couple lived in Hong Kong after Phillips changed positions within the Royal Bank of Scotland and became head of their sponsorships activities in the region.[29]\n\nTheir first child, and the Queen's first great-grandchild, a daughter named Savannah Anne Kathleen, was born on 29 December 2010 at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.[30][31][32] The Queen was present for the baby's baptism, which took place on 23 April 2011 at Church of the Holy Cross in Avening, Gloucestershire, near Gatcombe Park, the home of Phillips' mother. Savannah was born 12th in the line to the throne and is now 19th.[33] On 29 March 2012, the couple's second daughter, Isla Elizabeth, was born at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. She was born 13th in the line to the throne and is now 20th.[34]\n\nOn 11 February 2020, Phillips and his wife confirmed that they had separated in 2019 and announced they were planning to divorce.[35][36] The divorce was settled on 14 June 2021.[37]\n\nAfter his divorce, Phillips began a relationship with Lindsay Wallace in 2021, with whom he made his official debut as a couple at the Epsom Derby in June 2022.[38] The two ended their relationship in 2024.[39]\n\nOn 17 September 2022, during the period of official mourning for Queen Elizabeth II, Phillips joined his sister and six cousins to mount a 15-minute vigil around the coffin of their grandmother as it lay in state at Westminster Hall.[40] On 19 September 2022, he joined the Queen's children and other senior members of the royal family in walking behind the cortege in the state funeral procession.[41]\n\nBy June 2024, Phillips had introduced King Charles and Queen Camilla to his partner, NHS paediatric nurse and freelance writer Harriet Sperling (née Sanders), great-great niece of Raymond Courage, Lord of the Manor of Edgcote.[42]\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\n6 February 2002: Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal[43]\n\n6 February 2012: Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal[43]\n\n6 February 2022: Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal[43]\n\n6 May 2023: King Charles III Coronation Medal\n\nArms\n\n[edit]\n\nCoat of arms of Peter Phillips\n\nNotes\n\nThese arms were granted to Peter William Garside Phillips, the father of Mark Phillips and grandfather of Peter Mark Andrew Phillips, in October 1973. Mark used these arms differenced with a three-point label, and the younger Peter with a five-point label, until Mark inherited the plain arms in 1998.[44][45]\n\nCoronet\n\nPhillips is entitled to use the coronet of a female-line grandchild of the sovereign.[46][45]\n\nCrest\n\nOn a Wreath of the colours, a spur rowed upward or, winged argent, enclosing a lozenge encharged with a label gules.\n\nEscutcheon\n\nPer chevron azure and Or, in chief a horse courant argent, and in base a sprig of forget-me-not flowers, slipped and leaved proper.[44]\n\nMotto\n\nPro rege et patria (For king and country).\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nPortraits of Peter Phillips at the National Portrait Gallery, London\n\nPeter Phillips at IMDb"
