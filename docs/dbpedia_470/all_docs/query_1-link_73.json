        "text": "Peter Phillips, King Charles’s nephew, has been spotted with a new date just weeks after his split from his partner of three years.\n\nThe late Queen’s ‘favourite grandson’ is now understood to be dating paediatric nurse and freelance writer, Harriet Sperling.\n\nThe pair were spotted holding hands as they spent the weekend together at the Badminton Horse Trials.\n\nThe smitten couple watched cross-country horse riding from a sponsor’s tent on Saturday, before leaving with Mr Phillips’s two daughters, Savannah, 13, and Isla, 12.\n\nThey returned to the event on Sunday where Mr Phillips, who is 18th in line to the throne, was seen talking animatedly to Camilla.\n\nA friend of Mr Phillips told The Telegraph that the 46-year-old had met someone “recently” and the couple had been “spending time together”. However, he added it was too early to be anything more serious at this stage.\n\nThe latest development in the royal’s love life comes after news of his split from Lindsay Wallace, 43, made headlines last month.\n\nThe romance reportedly “ran its course” after three years.\n\nThe couple, who were described as “rock solid”, were so serious that Mr Phillips even introduced his new partner to the late Queen before her death in 2022.\n\nPrior to his relationship with Ms Wallace, the father-of-two was previously married to Autumn Kelly, 45, with whom he shares his two daughters.\n\nThe pair split in 2020 before divorcing in 2021, and it was then that his friendship with Lindsay turned romantic.\n\nThe late Queen’s eldest grandchild and the first-born son of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Philips, the 46-year-old works as a businessman and is currently the managing director of a boutique sports management company, SEL UK.\n\nIn 2022, his net worth was reported to be around £15.7 million.\n\nHe made history when he was born in 1977 when his parents refused to give him an official title - despite him being fifth in line to the throne at the time.\n\nThis was done in a bid to give Peter - and later his younger sister Zara Phillips - a chance at a relatively normal life.\n\nIt also simultaneously made him the first Royal grandchild in over 500 years to grow up without a title.\n\nMr Phillips’ representative has been contacted for comment."
