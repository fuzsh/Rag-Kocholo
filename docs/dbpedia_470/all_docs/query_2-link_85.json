During a visit to UCL, the Duchess, disclosed: \"I started off doing Psychology at St Andrew's, with History of Art,\" said Kate.

However, the university's online magazine, Varsity, debunked the myth, claiming that the bodyguard did not, in fact, take the exams, and so was unable to get the impressive mark.\n\nMORE: 19 celebrities who found success without a degree\n\nPrince Edward\n\nUniversity: Jesus College, Cambridge\n\nDegree: History\n\nEdward in the walled walkway known as 'The Chimney' at Jesus College\n\nThe Queen's third son studied history at Jesus College, Cambridge University and is reported to have enjoyed his time there, taking part in many theatre productions and playing sports.\n\nEdward graduated in 1986 with a lower second class honours degree, before embarking on a career in theatrical productions.\n\nDuchess of Sussex\n\nUniversity: Northwestern University, Illinois\n\nDegree: Theatre and International studies\n\nMeghan studied at Northwestern University near Chicago\n\nThe wife of Prince Harry also went into further education, studying theatre and international studies at the famed Northwestern University in America.
