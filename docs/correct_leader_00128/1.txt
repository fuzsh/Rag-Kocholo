Ryutaro Hashimoto (橋本 龍太郎, Hashimoto Ryūtarō, 29 July 1937 – 1 July 2006) was a Japanese politician who served as the Prime Minister of Japan briefly from January to November 1996. He took over from Tomiichi Murayama at the head of a coalition government. Shortly after he had been appointed Prime Minister after Murayama resignation, the New Frontier Party (NFP) win the 1996 elections in November, leading to his departure from office.

He was also the leader of one of the largest factions within the ruling LDP through most of the 1990s prior to 1996, and remained a powerful back-room player in Japanese politics until scandal forced him to resign his leadership position in 2004. Disgraced, he chose not to stand in the general election of 2005, and effectively retired from politics. He died on 1 July 2006 at a Tokyo hospital.
