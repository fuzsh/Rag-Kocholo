        "text": "Forgotten war survivors sue Japan for damages\n\nStanford conference to coordinate efforts to seek redress\n\nDate: Mon, 2 Dec 1996 18:09:18 -0800\n\nOn Sunday, the joint edition of San Francisco Chronicle/Examiner carried a front page article in the Metro section ( Forgotten war survivors sue Japan for damages ) discussed extensively the upcoming conference to be held at Stanford University on December 6 to December 8, 1996 (see attached). ============================================================ [The San Francisco Examiner] Sunday, Dec. 1, 1996 ï¿½ Page C 1 1996 San Francisco Examiner --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Forgotten war survivors sue Japan for damages Stanford conference to coordinate efforts to seek redress Julie Chao OF THE EXAMINER STAFF They are the forgotten survivors of what some call the other holocaust. For 3-1/4 years, Melvin Routt lived on pumpkin vines, worm-infested rice sweepings and any insects he could catch, all the while toiling in coal mines for the Japanese war effort. His weight dropped from 163 pounds to 83. Clinton Jennings of San Francisco lived through the savage Bataan Death March, in which 7,000 POWs died, then survived two months on a \"hellship\" to Japan, where food was lowered on a rope in a big bucket to 500 men crowded into one holding area. Like millions in Asia, Routt and Jennings were victims of the Japanese Imperial Army's wartime brutality. Fifty years after the end of World War II, the number of survivors is dwindling. They are far from satisfied by morsels of apologies Japan has coughed up in the last few years and have been frustrated in their attempts to get financial compensation. An international conference at Stanford University next week hopes to change all that. Sponsored by the Global Alliance for Preserving the History of WWII in Asia, an umbrella group of about 30 organizations worldwide, the meeting will allow lawyers, victims, scholars and other interested parties to unite and coordinate their efforts in seeking redress from the Japanese government. At their first meeting two years ago, the focus was on education. This time, they want to launch lawsuits. \"After two years of education, we think it's time to take some legal action,\" said Betty Yuan, a conference organizer and president of the Cupertino-based Alliance for Preserving the Truth of Sino-Japanese War. Japanese attorneys will fly in to give updates on cases they are pursuing in Tokyo courts on behalf of victims. Researchers from mainland China will report on new evidence of germ warfare. Victim groups from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and North America will discuss how future lawsuits might be coordinated. Karen Parker, an international human rights lawyer in San Francisco, will speak on her experiences fighting in the U.N. and Japanese courts over the last four years for compensation for the so-called \"comfort women.\" An estimated 200,000 women and girls were used as sex slaves by the Japanese military, servicing 10 to 30 men a day in horrendous conditions throughout Asia. Lawsuit in behalf of thousands The largest POW suit was filed in Tokyo district court in January 1995 by the Miami-based Center for Internee Rights. The suit, representing 33,000 U.S. military POWs, 14,000 civilian internees and thousands more Dutch, British and Australians survivors, asks for an apology and $22,000 individual compensation from the Japanese government. Like Routt, 75, and Jennings, 76, they contend they were used as slave laborers in violation of international war conventions. \"We feel that . . . a combination of an apology with this monetary token payment is the best way to resolve it,\" said Gilbert Hair, the center's director, who is slated to speak at the Stanford conference. Another 1,400 American POWs were shipped to Manchuria, where, as Sheldon Harris detailed in his 1994 book, \"Factories of Death,\" Japanese medical unit 731 carried out horrific germ warfare experiments on humans. Japanese doctors infected prisoners and Chinese populations at large with diseases, including plague and anthrax; performed amputations to train medical students, often without anesthesia; and conducted frostbite experiments where they exposed various parts of the body to minus 40-degree temperatures, then attempted to defrost them. \"It's beyond science fiction,\" said Harris, a retired Cal State-Northridge history professor. Not only were the perpetrators not punished after the war, many went on to become presidents of universities, deans of medical schools and heads of public health agencies, Harris said. Frank James, now living in Redwood City, was shipped to Mukden in Manchuria as a POW in November 1942. About 300 Americans died that winter, and James was one of two men assigned the next spring to lift the half-frozen bodies onto autopsy tables, where Japanese doctors removed organs. He testified to Congress in 1986 that the Japanese gave him an injection upon his arrival, took frequent blood samples and released fleas in the warehouse where the prisoners slept. When he returned to the United States in 1945, the U.S. Army made him sign a document swearing never to discuss his experiences in the camps. For 40 years, he didn't breathe a word. When his family would ask, \"I just said I had a bad time,\" he said in a telephone interview. Harris said the U.S. government had known about the experiments and made a secret deal not to try the Japanese for war crimes if they turned over their data. The former POWs universally blame Gen. Douglas MacArthur for the deal, but Harris said the order had surely come from higher up. \"They made MacArthur a hero, put a medal around his neck,\" said Routt, who now lives in Tracy. \"Should've been a noose as far as we're concerned.\" A list of war criminals The Department of Justice is expected to take a tiny but important step to address the issue by creating a list of Japanese war criminals, just as it has a list of Nazi war criminals. Anyone on the list would be refused entry to the United States. Hair, of the Center for Internee Rights, said he had supplied the Department of Justice with the center's list of war criminals, which includes top Japanese lawmakers and industrialists. The U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has allowed the Japanese government to foster a \"victim mentality\" and largely gloss over its own acts of aggression, Hair and others say. Not until 1995 did then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama make a historic speech apologizing for the suffering of all wartime victims. Critics dismissed it as inadequate and watered-down. Japan's position on financial compensation is that the issue was settled in the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty, said Sukasa Uemura, spokesman for the embassy in Washington. In that treaty, Japan agreed to surrender unconditionally and paid the international Red Cross the equivalent of about $15 per POW while the Allies agreed not to bring war crimes charges against it. \"Legally speaking, Japan as a government, as a nation, compensated,\" Uemura said. \"All legal issues with respect to compensation are settled.\" Parker, the human rights lawyer, said Japan's refusal to compensate victims directly could partly be attributed to lack of pressure from other countries, especially the United States and China, which have political and economic reasons for wanting to maintain good relations with Tokyo. At the conference, Parker intends to explore the possibility of bringing a suit in another country, such as the United States. Tokyo has used legal technicalities to contest current suits, indicating it doesn't intend to pay, she said. \"It does seem (the Japanese government) wants these old ladies to die one by one until the whole thing blows over,\" said Elaine Kim, an Asian Studies professor at UC-Berkeley. Of the 200,000 sex slaves, only 40,000 lived through the ordeal, Parker said. Just 500 are believed alive today. The majority were Korean, but women from China, the Philippines, Burma and the Netherlands, the colonial power in Indonesia at the time, were used as well. Japan did not admit to the program until 1994, two years after the first of the women stepped forward. Last year, a private fund was established to compensate the women. Parker and others agree that, regardless of Japanese judicial machinations, what is necessary here is a heightened awareness of the Japanese atrocities. Next spring, San Francisco Unified is expected to become the only school district in the country to include information on Japanese wartime atrocities in its high school curriculum, said Leland Yee, newly elected as a member of the Board of Supervisors. Yee, whose own mother often recounted tales of Japanese aggression, drafted the resolution earlier this year as a member of the School Board. There was quite a bit of debate, but \"I made it clear this was not going to be a forum to bash Japanese Americans,\" said Yee. \"(The war) should be taught in schools, and not just Pearl Harbor,\" said Routt, the ex-POW in Tracy. \"Kids growing up have absolutely no knowledge of what war is really like.\"\n\nFrom: Ignatius Ding"
