        "text": "November 7, 1996\n\nWeb posted at: 12:15 p.m. EST (1715 GMT)\n\nFrom Correspondent May Lee\n\nTOKYO (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto easily won a second term in office Thursday, but his biggest challenge is just beginning: ruling the nation with a minority government.\n\nHashimoto received 262 votes in the 500-member lower house of Parliament, largely due to a loose alliance his conservative Liberal Democratic Party formed with its old allies, the Social Democrats and the tiny Sakigake party.\n\nIn lower house elections last month, the LDP failed to secure a majority. But no party, not even its former coalition partners the Social Democrats and Sakigake, will agree to formally join a new coalition.\n\n\"The main reason why (LDP is) having difficulties finding partners is because everybody knows the decisions that will be made over 12 to 24 months will be very, very difficult decisions,\" political analysts Keith Henry said.\n\nHenry specifically said deregulation, administrative reform and economic recovery are key issues facing the government.\n\nWithout new alliances, the LDP will rule as a minority government, leaving room for other parties to have an influential voice and the potential to cast crucial swing votes.\n\nAs a result, political battles over controversial issues, such as national security, could erupt.\n\nHenry said, \"These are still wedge issues: what to do about American bases in Okinawa? What to do about a flare-up in North Korea, Where does Japan stand with Hong Kong, Taiwan and China?\"\n\nThat leaves one viable option for Hashimoto and his minority government -- maintain the status quo until they can regain a comfortable majority.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nHashimoto's coalition-building may be difficult - Oct. 21, 1996\n\nJapanese voters go to the polls - October 19, 1996\n\nJapanese election campaign under way - October 8, 1996\n\nNew party formed in Japan as elections near - September 28, 1996\n\nJapanese prime minister dissolves parliament, calls election - September 27, 1996\n\nJapan's prime minister tries to outflank new party - September 24, 1996\n\nRelated sites:\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nAsahi News (Japan)\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)\n\nExternal sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive."
