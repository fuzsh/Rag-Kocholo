A visit to a Shinto shrine, most properly on foot, during the first three days of the year is paramount. More than 3 million people were ushered en masse through Tokyo's huge Meiji Jingu this year first ceremonially washing, then throwing coins, depositing talismanic arrows to puncture bad luck and tying fortunes written on strips of paper to the shrubbery, so many that it looked as if fresh snow had fallen. Each gate and doorway will bear a kadomatsu, a subtle arrangement of bamboo, straw and pine. Some, in front of big stores will be huge church organs of bamboo, others a more simple bouquet. The end of the year signals the time for o-souji the big cleaning and this year the cleaning and tidying is nowhere more evident than in the Japanese bureaucracy. Japan has embarked on its biggest bureaucratic reorganisation since World War II, rationalising its 23 ministries and agencies down to 13, cutting 128 bureaus in those bodies down to 96, their advisory bodies from 211 to 89 and shuffling more than half a million bureaucrats. This tectonic shift, which has rocked Japan's finicky bureaucrats, was initiated by former prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto four years ago before he was forced from office by a disastrous election result. Fittingly, Hashimoto, if nothing else an aggressive change merchant, has just taken a new Cabinet post and will oversee the reforms he started. The aim of the big change is to seize control of the country from the bureaucrats and hand it to the politicians. In the past, the politicians simply rubber-stamped policy, budgets and legislation devised by the bureaucracy. The bureaucrats even answered questions in Parliament for the ostensibly responsible minister. Despite the appalling record of government of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, if the shake-up achieves its end, it will be another welcome small step towards Japan becoming a true democracy. Rather than conduct turf wars between ministries and connive to channel taxpayers' money into their own projects to disperse according to their own policy strategies and vested interests, bureaucrats should now have to work more in concert with other ministries to enact policies determined by elected politicians. The bureaucrats, despite their feudal nature, are typically the elite of the education system and some of the most skilful and knowledgeable in the world. The problems have been in co-ordinating and implementing policy rather than the policies themselves. The immediate effect may well be a welcome boost for the economy as the sheer physical change has employed thousands of removalists, builders, printers, caterers, disposal agents, and no doubt bar owners and restaurateurs, over the normally quiet new year period, at a cost of more than 30 billion yen ($452 million). In face-sensitive Japan, there will also be ructions over which ministries now have the most power, with the merged mega-ministries uncertain whether they will have more or less clout. Even the Ministry of Finance, which will remain as is, will lose its coveted name of okurasho, or Treasury House, which goes back more than 500 years punishment, some say, for its track record of scandals and errors in the 1990s. Most independent observers welcome the changes, at least because they will force an examination of processes and organisations that have become entrenched. Some changes, however, bring more ambivalence. For example, the Financial Reconstruction Commission, created in 1998 when Japan was on the economic brink, has been a largely independent body responsible for making tangible progress in preventing a systemic collapse in the financial system while forcing banks and other institutions to improve their credit management and focus on a strategic direction. It will now be absorbed by a new department and again come under the sway of the still-tainted Finance Ministry, which for years perpetrated the convoy system that allowed poor credit quality and slack management to flourish. More intriguingly, the reorganisation is recreating a version of Japan's notorious Home Ministry, the all-powerful pre-war office that pushed Japan into war and ruthlessly quelled public dissent. Bureaucrats with pedigrees from the Home Ministry are moving into the top positions in the newly created Cabinet Office of the prime minister. And at a time when these changes are taking place to hand more power to politicians and the prime minister's office, Japan has in Yoshiro Mori its least popular and most tanglefooted Prime Minister since the war. Commentators have almost unanimously doubted Mori's ability to lead and invigorate the new structure, and that plays directly into the hands of the grand architect, Hashimoto. Since he returned to the Cabinet in December, Hashimoto's profile has been growing almost daily. The reorganisation, his ambitious plan, will now have his hand at the wheel. Politicians, bureaucrats and commentators alike have little doubt that Hashimoto desperately wants to resume his abridged premiership. In a public poll taken immediately after the latest Mori Cabinet was inaugurated, Hashimoto far outstripped the Prime Minister and ranked as the top Cabinet minister. He is unlikely to unseat Mori before July's Upper House election because of the strong likelihood that the LDP will suffer at the polls and the Prime Minister will have to resign to take responsibility. For the moment, Hashimoto is travelling in the box seat. acornell@gol.com\n\nEmailLinkedInTwitterFacebook\n\nSubscribe to gift this article\n\nGift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLatest In Politics\n\nFetching latest articles\n\nMost Viewed In Politics"
