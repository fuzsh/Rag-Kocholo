        "meta_description": "Karen Hill Anton brings the wisdom of experience to her writing, connecting perspectives on native Japanese culture with U.S. culture. A resident of Japan for nearly 50 years Ms. Anton’s unique views offer a fascinating transnational understanding of two inextricably linked cultures. A writer, columnist, consultant and coach, she is well known for writing popular columns for key periodicals in Japan including “Crossing Cultures” for the Japan Times and “Another Look” for Chunichi Shimbun, and op-ed essays for Shukan ST.\n\n \n\nShe has consulted for many global corporations in Japan, including Citibank, Eli Lilly, Shinsei Bank, and JP Morgan, among others; and has coached senior executives in finance, pharmaceuticals and software industries. She has been especially successful in guiding Japanese women seeking to change careers, make significant lifestyle alterations, as well as re-enter the workforce after maternity leave. She is Emerita: Board of Governors, Temple University, Japan Campus, Shizuoka Human Rights Association, the Jun Ashida Educational Foundation Committee, and is an Allman Fellow and Freeman Foundation Fellow. Karen Hill Anton was invited to serve on the Internationalization and Society Advisory Council of Prime Ministers Keizō Obuchi and Ryutaro Hashimoto.\n\n \n\nMs. Anton has presented workshops and seminars on the craft of memoir writing for the Japan Writers’ Conference, and the Society of Writers, Editors, and Translators. Having studied for many years, she has achieved second-degree mastery in Japanese calligraphy. Originally from New York City, she has raised her four children and made her home with her husband William Anton in the rural province of Shizuoka, Japan, since 1975. Her memoir, The View From Breast Pocket Mountain, is the Grand Prize Winner of the 2022 Memoir Prize for Books, 2021 B.R.A.G Medallion, and the 2020 SPR Book Awards Gold Prize. The View From Breast Pocket Mountain is a treasure trove of experiences crossing borders and cultures, creating a life, and finding contentment in a far-off country. A Thousand Graces is her first novel. Set in the 1970s Shōwa era of Japan, it evokes nostalgia for a simpler time as traditional customs and values fade away and Japanese society inexorably changes to meet the expectations and demands of a more modern world. Roger Pulvers, author of Liv, calls the novel “a magnificent coming-of-age story of desire, passion and the getting of wisdom.”\n\n \n\nMs. Anton’s speaking engagement with the Tokyo American Club can be seen here. \n\n \n\nTo hear her interview with Now and Zen Japan, click here., powered by Localist Event Calendar Software",
