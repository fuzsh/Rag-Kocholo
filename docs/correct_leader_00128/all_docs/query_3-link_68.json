        "text": "Ryutaro Hashimoto's reformist agenda led to his downfall\n\nJapan's former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has died at the age of 68.\n\nHe had been critically ill in a Tokyo hospital with intestinal problems after undergoing surgery.\n\nMr Hashimoto, of the Liberal Democratic Party, served as prime minister from 1996 to 1998. He retired from politics last year because of his poor health.\n\nAs prime minister, he introduced financial reforms, but resigned after an electoral setback which was blamed on an unpopular tax increase.\n\nHe also put security ties with the United States on a firmer footing and resolved a crisis over opposition to US bases in Okinawa.\n\nBut the tax increase - introduced in an attempt to cut the nation's huge budget - backfired when it led to a collapse in consumer spending and then defeat in upper house elections.\n\nConsidered a skilled negotiator, Mr Hashimoto had been seen as one of the few politicians capable of arguing on an equal footing with Japan's powerful bureaucrats.\n\nHe graduated from the elite Keio University, where he majored in political science. He worked at a spinning company for two years before entering parliament at the age of 26 after his father's death."
