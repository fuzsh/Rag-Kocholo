        "text": "Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto might be sushi now, but it's not yet clear that his accomplices in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have the slightest clue how to fix their country's economic mess. Investors, nevertheless, regarded the Tokyo shake-up as a good thing, with a rally in tech stocks helping prod the Wired Index 5.56 points higher to close at 437.15.\n\nAlthough Hashimoto stepped down following an election setback for his party, he insisted that the failure was his alone, and that voters were not passing judgment on the LDP's fiscal stewardship. This appraisal, of course, is dead wrong, but it's not as though Hashimoto had demonstrated much of a capacity for lucid thinking as far as Japan's economic meltdown is concerned.\n\nEd McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said it's clear that Hashimoto's crash and burn represents a wake-up call to those responsible for Japan's shortsighted policy blunders.\n\n\"The question is whether they'll behave like my son and sleep through it,\" he observed, \"or whether they'll finally get out of bed.\"\n\nTokyo already may have hit the snooze button. The frontrunners for the premiership, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and party stalwart Seiroku Kajiyama, can both claim virtually zero economic experience. McKelvey believes US investors are braced for this prospect, and will tolerate to some extent continued muddling by Japanese political leaders.\n\n\"What we can't deal with,\" he said, \"is a spiraling downward.\"\n\nNot all is wrong with the world, though. Tech stocks were among the first to shrug off overseas worries and remind investors why bulls still run rampant on this side of the Pacific. Microsoft (MSFT) jumped US$4.94 to $118.13 on expectations that the Godzilla of software makers will report better-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday. Dell Computer (DELL), the PC bellwether was also stronger, climbing $5.17 to $105.98.\n\nIntel (INTC) advanced $2.63 to $82.38 amid optimism that chip sales will pick up in the second half. The company reports its second-quarter performance on Tuesday. Applied Materials (AMAT) dropped $1 to $28.50 after the largest maker of equipment for chip production warned that its quarterly earnings probably won't meet market expectations. It blamed Asia's economic troubles for slumping sales.\n\nOnline issues surged in late afternoon trading. Yahoo (YHOO) bolted $3.75 to $185.00, and America Online (AOL) gained $5.13 to $117.63 on news that it had entered the mortgage market, expanding its real-estate offerings in collaboration with Intuit."
