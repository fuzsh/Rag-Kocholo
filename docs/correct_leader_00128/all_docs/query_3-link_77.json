        "text": "Former Japanese prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, an outspoken politician who jousted with US officials over the auto trade and brought \"Big Bang\" financial reforms to Tokyo, has died at the age of 68.\n\nMr Hashimoto, who retired from politics last September citing poor health, had undergone surgery to remove a large part of his intestine after being rushed to hospital on June 4, media said.\n\nHe died at the International Medical Centre in Tokyo.\n\nMr Hashimoto was rushed to hospital with abdominal pain and underwent surgery to remove a large part of his intestine in early June.\n\nHailed as a forceful leader who would tackle reform when he took over as premier in 1996, he ultimately faltered in the face of financial crisis, political scandal and economic stagnation.\n\nBy the time Mr Hashimoto made a second run for the premiership in April 2001, losing out to reformist Junichiro Koizumi, he had become an emblem of the ruling party's resistance to change.\n\nMr Hashimoto - a dapper, quick-tempered politician who practised kendo, the art of fencing with bamboo staves - himself once had a reputation as a popular reformer.\n\nAfter a high-profile term as trade minister during which he faced off against then-US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in a bitter feud over the auto trade, Mr Hashimoto became head of a coalition government in January 1996.\n\nA media favourite who stood out with his slicked-back hair, rakish suits and ever-present cigarette, he was welcomed abroad as a take-charge executive.\n\nVowing to \"go down in flames\" if he failed to carry out economic and other reforms that would carry Japan into the next century, Mr Hashimoto led the LDP through October 1996 elections.\n\nThe party failed to win a majority by a slim margin, but the poll set the stage for the LDP's first return to power outside a coalition after being booted out by disgruntled voters in 1993.\n\nMr Hashimoto then unveiled a \"Big Bang\" reform package to open up Japan's financial sector by 2001, a program which even his critics said was largely a success.\n\nHe also initiated an overhaul of the government aimed at boosting efficiency and giving the prime minister more power - reforms Mr Koizumi later mobilised in his own push for change.\n\nDespite his lone-wolf image and reputation as a policy expert,\"Hashiryu\", as he was popularly known, relied heavily on bureaucrats to help craft his policy agenda.\n\nHis self-styled \"cabinet for a new age\" was slammed for being made up of party elders, with posts allotted by seniority and LDP factional dynamics, casting doubt on his commitment to change."
