        "text": "During his stormy two-year tenure as Japanese prime minister in the late 1990s, Ryutaro Hashimoto's austere financial policies and haughty manner culminated in a painful recession and the worst electoral debacle in his party's history.\n\nThat would seem to make him an improbable candidate to lead Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party as it scrambles to restore voter confidence before elections in July. During the past several days, however, Hashimoto _ who was forced to resign in 1998 because of his party's humiliating electoral defeat _ has emerged as the clear favorite to succeed Yoshiro Mori as party president and hence Japan's next prime minister.\n\nHashimoto's surprising comeback, the product of weeks of back room maneuvering, injects a new element of uncertainty into the Liberal Democrats' efforts to revive Japan's ailing economy. In a political system that prizes consensus, Hashimoto, 63, is perceived as a rare and unpredictable maverick.\n\nForeign investors cheered the single-minded determination with which Hashimoto, as prime minister, pushed deregulation of Japan's financial system and streamlined inefficient government agencies. But Hashimoto also stacked his Cabinet with scandal-tainted cronies and rammed through an unpopular tax increase as the economy was weakening.\n\nAlthough he has held a top post in the Mori Cabinet as minister for administrative reform, Hashimoto has kept a low profile this past year. Japanese press accounts suggest that, to shore up his base within the party, he has toned down his enthusiasm for restructuring the economy. Whether he supports the package of emergency economic and financial measures announced last week by the Mori government remains a mystery, even to some of his supporters.\n\nHashimoto has said little publicly since Friday, when Mori formally declared his intention to stand aside, other than that he is \"very honored to be considered\" as a contender for Mori's job. That was a considerable understatement; colleagues in the Liberal Democratic Party say it's a foregone conclusion Hashimoto will be named party president in balloting set for April 24.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats dominate the three-party coalition that controls the government; the prime minister's job usually goes with the party's presidency. Hashimoto heads the party's largest faction and is said to have locked up the support of two smaller groupings with enough votes to ensure his election as party leader.\n\nStung by charges that it is secretive and undemocratic, the ruling party recently introduced a formal election process to pick its president. But the contest is mostly for show; typically, the winner is decided well before the voting.\n\nHashimoto's main rival, former health minister Junichiro Koizumi, told supporters Friday that he thought it was important to contest the post, however remote his chances. \"Those who do not fight because they are afraid of being defeated are cowards,\" he said.\n\nLDP elders are rallying around Hashimoto when many fear the party could be in danger of collapse. It has been weakened by a series of splits and defections, and Mori's tenure has been plagued by gaffes and scandals."
