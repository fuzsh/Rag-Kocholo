        "text": "January 9, 1996\n\nWeb posted at: 12:32 a.m EST (0545 GMT)\n\nFrom Tokyo Bureau Chief John Lewis\n\nTOKYO (CNN) -- Ryutaro Hashimoto, the man picked to replace outgoing Prime Minister Tomiichi Muryama, may be a member of the Japan's new political guard, but he's a product of the old.\n\nThe 58-year-old minister of trade is poised to take over the top spot later this week. It has long been his ambition, according to analysts. (Hashimoto fencing - 459K QuickTime movie)\n\nBut Monday, the heir-apparent was still playing the blushing bride.\n\n\"It was hard for me to sleep last night after I learned they had decided to appoint me,\" he said.\n\nThe leader of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party isn't usually so shy. His combative style has scored him major political points here, most recently in the Japan-U.S. auto talks.\n\n\"He went head-to-head, literally, with (U.S. Trade representative Mickey Kantor), and ultimately with Clinton. He certainly showed the Japanese that he could stand up to the Americans when they need to be stood up to,\" said political analyst Keith Henry.\n\nHashimoto's political career began in his father's footsteps. At age 26, he inherited his Diet seat from his father with a lot of help from the powerful War Bereaved Association.\n\nAs the association's leader until last year, Hashimoto led the group's strong opposition to an official Japanese apology for the Pacific War.\n\nWhile called a \"new leader,\" Hashimoto learned his political tricks at the knees of one of the old masters, former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. Tanaka elevated the Liberal Democratic Party's fund-raising machine in the 1960s and early '70s to a work of art before being chased from office, and later convicted, on bribery charges.\n\nTrue to the rough-and-tumble world of Japanese politics, Hashimoto has known his share of controversy. He came under fire in 1990 for suggesting Japan's falling birthrate was due to Japanese women putting college and career ambitions ahead of motherhood.\n\nBut Hashimoto, who has served in numerous high-profile cabinet posts over the years, has been well-groomed for the top spot, and that's apparently where he's headed.\n\nIt's almost certain that Hashimoto will become the new prime minister, according to observers. But, they cautioned, given the fact that he is a product of the old system, any changes that may come about during his administration will probably be more evolutionary than revolutionary."
