        "text": "Singapore Government Press Release\n\nMedia Relations Division, Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts,\n\nMITA Building, 140 Hill Street, 2nd Storey, Singapore 179369\n\nTel: 6837-9666\n\nKEYNOTE ADDRESS BY MR RAYMOND LIM, MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY, AT THE 5TH JAPAN-SINGAPORE SYMPOSIUM, TOKYO, ON 18 FEBRUARY 2003\n\nJAPAN-SINGAPORE:\n\nCREATING A FUTURE IN PARTNERSHIP\n\nYour Excellency Senior Vice-Minister Tetsuro Yano\n\nYour Excellency Ambassador Okawara\n\nYour Excellency Ambassador Lim, Chew, Koh and Pany\n\nLadies and Gentlemen\n\nThe Japan-Singapore Symposium (JSS) has been an important element in the multi-faceted bilateral relations between our two countries. Proposed by then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in 1994 and wholeheartedly supported by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, the inaugural Japan-Singapore Symposium was held in Tokyo in 1995. Since then, we have had three symposia alternating between Singapore and Tokyo in 1996, 1998 and 2001. Over the intervening years, the JSS has matured and come into its own. It has brought together many Japanese and Singapore politicians, government officials, businessmen, academics and the media under one roof to network and to discuss issues of mutual interest. More significantly, the symposium is an important forum for both sides to explore ways to strengthen bilateral as well as regional cooperation.\n\nSeven years ago, the 2nd Japan-Singapore Symposium held in Singapore in 1996 identified a common vision for Singapore and Japan and worked out a road map for our long-term cooperation. These were: first, to help build a community of prosperous economies stretching from North America, across the Pacific, to Japan and down to New Zealand, based on the free flow across borders, of goods, services, capital, technology, and information. Second, to cooperate in maintaining the stability of the region by defusing potential flash points and encouraging a stable relationship between the US, Japan and China. Third, to ensure that East Asia will not turn inward but will remain open to the world.\n\nThe common vision was drawn up during the good times when the region was vibrant and promising. The global and regional environments have changed much since. Until the Asian financial crisis in 1997, regional economies were all doing well. Foreign investment kept rolling in and the region was registering impressive growth year after year. But the financial crisis completely altered the landscape in the region. Until today, some of the countries in Southeast Asia are still recovering from the effects of the financial crisis.\n\nThe events of September 11 led to a slowdown in the world economy sending further shock waves to the region. The US is a key export market for the region. The recovery of the regional economies hinges primarily on the US recovery. Beyond economics, the September 11 attacks revealed the extent of the Al-Qaeda network and its penetration into the region. In our region, terrorism by extremist Islamic groups has emerged as a threat right at our doorstep.\n\nThese are difficult changes for the region. To compound the region�s woes, developments in Iraq and North Korea have added more uncertainties to world stability. The tense situation in Iraq is posing security concerns in the Middle East. It is also unsettling the world economy as the region is the main supplier of oil for the world. Closer to us, North Korea�s decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) threatens to further upset the peace and security of the region.\n\nMany economic pundits had previously dubbed the 21st Century to be the Pacific Century. Barely three years into the 21st Century, sceptics of the Asian miracle appear to be in ascendancy. Is this the end of the road for Asia? Will these setbacks weigh us down permanently? Should we let ourselves be mentally trapped by our current circumstances and constraints? More importantly, will these changes affect the Japan-Singapore common vision identified seven years ago?\n\nMy answer to these questions is a robust \"No\". I am an optimist. While the gloss of the region is diminished, its tremendous potential remains. I believe the region can revive its dynamism if regional governments band together in cooperation. The common vision which we identified at the 2nd JSS remains relevant today. In fact, the present difficult times make it all the more urgent for us to strengthen our relations and bilateral cooperation as we work towards our common vision.\n\nBut how can Japan, an economic superpower, and Singapore, a small country, help the region regain its shine?\n\nSimilar Destiny, Strong Cooperation\n\nAt a glance, our differences in culture, language and history hardly justify a strategic and multi-faceted bilateral relationship. But these differences belie the number of common and complementary interests, and the shared outlook that exist between our two countries.\n\nWe have a congruence of views on the importance of a continued US presence in the region. The strong bilateral ties are underpinned by a common interest in trade and investment liberalisation. In multilateral fora, such as APEC, ARF, ASEM, and the UN, Singapore and Japan also share many common interests, like freedom of passage in high seas and straits, and nuclear non-proliferation. We have often supported each other�s candidatures in international organisations.\n\nOur relative lack of size shapes our shared outlook. Japan and Singapore are situated at the northern and southern end of East Asia respectively. Within each of our sub-region, Japan and Singapore are both island nations surrounded by bigger neighbours. This is a geographical fact. But we have never allowed ourselves to be trapped by our comparative lack of size vis-à-vis our neighbours. Both countries have developed much faster than our respective neighbours. The sense of vulnerability and lack of a large hinterland have made us work harder and stay ahead of others.\n\nOver the years, Singapore and Japan have forged a very close cooperative relationship. Politically, there are excellent contacts between our leaders, officials and businessmen. Visits by political leaders and officials have become a regular feature. Then Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, the late Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi (then as Foreign Minister) and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi had separately found Singapore to be a suitable location to deliver their visions for ASEAN. Institutional links such as the Japan-Singapore Parliamentary Friendship League, exchange programmes for politicians and officials and MFA-Gaimusho Dialogue have also been firmly established.\n\nEconomically, Japan is Singapore�s third largest trading partner, second largest investor and one of our biggest single source of tourists. Japanese companies make up more than 30% of the 6,000 multi-national companies (MNCs) in Singapore. Japanese investments have played a major role in Singapore�s economic development. These investments have not only provided us with access to capital, technology, but also links to the global markets.\n\nOn the other hand, Singapore is an attractive base as a global launchpad for Japanese products and services. For example, NTT DoCoMo, SINGTEL and Centre for Wireless Communications (CWC) collaborated on testing of wide-band CDMA (w-CDMA) 3G Technology in Singapore in 1999. In 2002, Honda tested its Intelligent Community Vehicle System (ICVS) in Singapore. Honda has chosen Singapore over other countries to conduct its very first commercial testing of the innovative business model of car sharing within a community. The system integration was done by Singapore�s National Computer System (NCS). In the same year, SHARP set up its application development centre for Integrated Circuit (IC) cards in Singapore to develop applications and uses for smart cards. As you can see, Singapore complements Japan. Singapore offers a \"Living Working Laboratory\" environment to Japanese companies to develop and test out next generation products and applications, leading on to subsequent successful commercialisation because we have a strong enterprise ecosystem in place to support such business activities.\n\nAs noted by Tokyo Governor Ishihara Shintaro during his visit to Singapore in 2002, the hardware of what makes Singapore click, such as equipment in the port or electronic road pricing system in Singapore, were mainly Japanese. Singapore has been able to use such hardware and technology successfully. He lamented that on the other hand Japan has not been able to take advantage of them. I must say that we have been fortunate. Singapore�s small size allows us to implement and move things along easier and faster. We have been able to leverage our smallness to strategic advantage. Singapore�s ability to effectively use the excellent technology of Japan helps to showcase Japanese systems and equipment to the world. It also allows Japan to test new ideas and inventions in Singapore. This synergy between our two countries is significant.\n\nManaging Difficulties\n\nCurrent global difficulties present both new challenges and problems. But they will also give rise to fresh opportunities for Singapore and Japan to work together for mutual benefit. We should take advantage of the adverse situation to gear up for the long-term opportunities in the new environment.\n\nOn our part, the changed global outlook has forced Singapore to reassess our prospects and change our strategies. We have to do so in order to maximise our chances and to continue to grow in the new and increasingly uncertain environment.\n\nOver the past few years, Singapore has been liberalising our economy to harness the power of private enterprise and free markets. We have opened up our telecommunications sector to free competition. We are also restructuring and deregulating the power industry. We have been liberalising our financial sector to free up protected industries like banking and stockbroking. In manufacturing, we placed a long term bet on the life sciences, with the aim of attracting MNCs and developing a fourth pillar of our manufacturing sector, together with electronics, chemicals and engineering.\n\nMore recently, we have established the Economic Review Committee (ERC) in 2001 to holistically and fundamentally review our economic policies and strategies with the aim of strengthening Singapore�s competitiveness and consolidate our social cohesion. The strategies include promoting entrepreneurship, developing human capital, upgrading our manufacturing sector, and promoting the growth of services sector. These measures will keep our economy flexible and resilient. They will also enable our economy to adjust quickly to changing circumstances, and to remain ahead in the race of nations.\n\nLike Singapore, Japan is also going through economically difficult times. Japan�s present economic problems have resulted in observers doubting whether Japan will ever recover its drive and vitality. However, I do not share this pessimism. Changes are taking place. Financial reforms have set off several rounds of mergers between Japanese financial institutions. Foreign banks are entering and acquiring Japanese institutions. Japan�s financial sector will be stronger from such consolidation and restructuring. Most Japanese corporations, especially those in the electronics sector, like Sony, Toshiba, Hitachi and Matsushita, have set bold targets for restructuring and are achieving them. Promising new growth sectors, including IT, are emerging in Japan.\n\nI know the Japanese government is determined to carry out fundamental reforms. In the short term, reforms will bring about pain but, in the longer term, restructuring will strengthen the Japanese economy and restore sustainable growth. However daunting structural problems are in Japan, when the technology sector picks up, Japanese corporations have the technological and production edge to reap the benefits. As a beneficiary of Japan�s prosperity in the past, Singapore looks forward to the Japanese economy recovering and resuming its role as an engine of growth for the whole region.\n\nFuture Cooperation\n\nSingapore has been a long-term and reliable partner for Japan in the region. We will continue to be so. We cannot rest on the laurels of our existing cooperation. Singapore takes a long-term view of our relationship with Japan. Only continuing collaborative efforts would result in a win-win situation for both Singapore and Japan.\n\nAllow me to share some of my thoughts on future cooperation. One, over the last few years, Japan is slowly playing a more active regional role. Japan�s involvement in the reconstruction process of Afghanistan and Sri Lanka is commendable. Japan has also played major roles in helping East Timor and Aceh. At a time when the world is laden with much uncertainties and heavy burdens, Japan�s diplomatic proactivity is a refreshing change. Confidence building in the region is key to maintaining peace and security in the region. Singapore welcomes Japan�s desire to play a more active role in promoting regional peace and security. Both sides could explore ways to work in tandem to help regional peace and stability.\n\nTwo, as trading nations, Singapore and Japan have a strategic interest in open sealanes. One example of this is our efforts at combating piracy in the region. Singapore shares Japan�s interest in maintaining maritime security and the freedom of navigation in the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea. We worked hand-in-hand in hosting regional conferences on anti-piracy. Singapore was the venue for the first Preparatory Meeting for the Tokyo Anti-Piracy Conference in March 2000. Japan hosted the Tokyo Anti-Piracy Conference in April 2002, which was a success. More significantly, Japan proposed the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Anti Piracy (ReCAAP), together with the establishment of an Information Sharing Centre (ISC) to combat piracy more efficiently and effectively. Singapore fully welcomes this initiative. Combating piracy is certainly an area we can further enhance our cooperation. Singapore has offered to host the ISC and to provide substantial host country support to ensure its viability. We look forward to continued cooperation with Japan in this area.\n\nThree, in the economic arena, there is much room for further collaboration between the private sectors of our two countries. Many Japanese companies have upgraded their operations by locating in Singapore their regional headquarters and key business functions like finance, sales, marketing, IT management, logistic and supply chain management and procurement. For example, although Toyota does not have a manufacturing plant in Singapore, its regional HQ - Toyota Motors Asia-Pacific Pte Ltd - in Singapore covers the entire Asia-Pacific region, excluding only China. It is responsible for providing business support and management control to 17 facilities in 11 countries. Japanese investments are now no longer just for industrial production. They have moved up the value chain to engage in knowledge-driven activities such as technology research, product development and e-business.\n\nAn interesting cooperation trend is that of transnational business alliances hosted by Singapore, and featuring prominent Japanese companies. A recent example is the announcement of Shell and Sumitomo�s intention to set up in Singapore one of the world�s largest ethylene plants to make plastics and polyester, which could be worth S$1.73 billion. The two companies have joined hands before in Singapore in the Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore and The Polyolefin Company (Singapore), both running at full capacity. Such inter-continental joint ventures are not easy to set up in Europe, and very difficult in Japan. But in Singapore, they come naturally. Another example is the Hitachi-IBM hard-disk drive (HDD) joint venture, which has decided to set up its Global Centre in Singapore. Besides being the Asia-Pacific regional headquarters, the Global Centre will also house the following functions in Singapore: Server HDD manufacturing centre; Multi regional sales centre; Worldwide financial centre and Intellectual Property and technology centre. All these global functions leverage on Singapore�s unique strength in these core competencies.\n\nIn addition, Singapore is also an ideal location to harness operating efficiency and sophistication for the world export market. A prime example is the electronics semiconductor industry in Singapore, where Toshiba and Matsushita Electric have invested about S$1.8 billion in Singapore�s first Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) plant. This project not only gave birth to a whole new industry sub-cluster, but it was also one of the top contributors to fixed asset investments in 2002 in Singapore. Such investments will further strengthen Singapore�s value proposition for Japanese investors. I urge more Japanese companies to take advantage of Singapore as a launchpad for your technologies and products. Singapore can establish new partnership models with Japan, involving enterprises of all sizes and at different stages of development, to form synergistic alliances.\n\nThe possibilities of bilateral cooperation could even go beyond our own shores. This is best exemplified by our close cooperation in recent years to assist the region�s growth, development, and integration. Our close consultations in managing the 1997 financial crisis and our contributions to the crisis-hit countries in the region were cases in point. Similarly, the Japan-Singapore Partnership Programme (JSPP), established in 1995 on an equitable cost-sharing basis to provide training and technical assistance to developing countries, has also played an important role in their development. More recently, the conclusion of the Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement (JSEPA) not only represented a milestone in Singapore-Japan relations, it is also a crucial step towards regional economic integration. The JSEPA is Japan�s first ever FTA and it shows that such bilateral agreements are possible. More significantly, it has led to interests by regional countries to conclude similar arrangements with Japan and regionally.\n\nIn terms of investments in the region, Japan can make use of Singapore as a gateway into Southeast Asia. Despite the difficulties that currently beset the region, it still offers possibilities and potential. There is no denying that China is the biggest attraction for investors. The investors will continue to flock to China. But MNCs would also need to tap the Southeast Asian market. MNCs do not usually put everything in one basket. They would need to spread their investments and risks. In this regard, Southeast Asia offers a competitive alternative to China as an investment destination. For example, Singapore and Indonesia have jointly developed the Riau islands, Batam and Bintan into an attractive investment alternative to China. There are several good reasons for Japanese investors to look at these destinations. One, not widely known in Japan, the labour costs in Batam and Bintan are actually much cheaper than in China. Two, Batam and Bintan are located just 45-minute ferry ride from Singapore. Japanese investors can tap into the superb business infrastructure such as financial, logistics and telecommunications in Singapore, while enjoying the low-cost production in Batam and Bintan. As a friend of Japan, I strongly recommend Japanese companies to study the Singapore-Riau configuration for your corporate strategic planning purposes.\n\nIn the social aspects, Japan and Singapore are experiencing similar social challenges. Our populations are ageing rapidly. In fact, Singapore has the second fastest ageing population in Asia, after Japan. At the same time, the birth rates in Japan and Singapore are also shrinking. These would have significant impact on our societies, particularly in the aspect of social welfare and labour market. Singapore and Japan should come together to share experiences and learn from each other on how best to manage these challenges. Regional countries would experience similar social challenges in time to come. It is part and parcel of development. Hence, our experiences on how we tackle the problems of ageing population, declining birth rate and shrinking workforce would in future be useful guides to regional countries as they too have to meet these challenges.\n\nThese are just some of my ideas on how I see future cooperation between Singapore and Japan. The cooperation between Japan and Singapore is in the common interest of both countries and also vital for the entire Asian region. I hope both sides will seize the opportunities, and help to further consolidate bilateral relations and build further decades of peace and prosperity for our peoples in the region.\n\nI am sure the JSS will try to flesh out in more concrete terms, over the next two days, how bilateral cooperation can be lifted to another level. As I had mentioned earlier, present difficulties will throw up new opportunities.\n\nI wish you a fruitful symposium. Thank you.\n\n. . . . ."
