        "text": "Although as prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who has died aged 68 following abdominal surgery, initiated proposals for Japan's momentous \"big bang\" financial reforms, he hardly had time to make his mark before becoming yet another of his country's turnstile premiers.\n\nHis 30 months in office - from early 1996 until mid-1998 - only just exceeded the average postwar term, and he was one of eight prime ministers of Japan who spanned the politically tortuous 1990s. In 1993, for the first time in 38 years, his Liberal Democratic (conservative) party lost power for 10 months, and Hashimoto had to lead a three-party coalition that included the socialists.\n\nThis did not help the Big Bang, which was fully completed only by 2001. His initial popularity also faded quickly with his decision to raise consumption tax from 3% to 5%, an economically suicidal move blamed for prolonging the slump that had hit Japan in the early 1990s. A similar mistake was to approve government aid to mortgage companies already awash in bad loans.\n\nThe upper house election of 1998, in which his party had hoped to do well, turned out to be disastrous, and Hashimoto resigned. But as an LDP insider of many decades' standing, he was put in charge of administrative reform for 16 months until 2001. He continued to head his powerful parliamentary faction - a key element in Japanese politics - until a $1m personal political fundraising scandal erupted in 2004. He chose not to stand again the following year.\n\nOverall it was an only too typical career in Japan's lacklustre politics, even in its little-publicised nepotism. Along with almost half the elected LDP members of the Japanese parliament, the Diet, Hashimoto was the close relative of an earlier politician; his father, Ryogo, was a cabinet member under Nobusuke Kishi, the prime minister who was imprisoned as a class-A war criminal but not tried, and who held office from 1957 to 1960. But Ryutaro went one better in familial politics, fathering Gaku, a member of the Diet today and his second son.\n\nHashimoto was brought up in prosperous circumstances, attending the Azabu private high school in a fashionable part of Tokyo. He graduated in politics from Keio University in 1960 and entered parliament three years later as an LDP loyalist. Slow progress followed until 1978 when, at 41, he was made minister of health, a cabinet post.\n\nIn this office he had to deal with the effects of a catastrophe caused by industrial pollution on residents of the small seaside town of Minamata. The victims had suffered terrible deformities, disabilities and death from absorbing mercury dumped in the bay by a large local corporation, Chisso. The tragedy became a Japanese symbol for how industrial development dominated society, and Hashimoto, subscribing to contemporary conventional politics, did almost nothing about it. Minamata disease still claims victims, and recently marked its 50th anniversary.\n\nHashimoto again held cabinet office in 1968, as transport minister under prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, the initiator of Japan's increasing modern nationalism. He soon rose to finance minister and was promoted to head MITI, the then notoriously powerful ministry of international trade and industry, from 1994 to 1996, under prime minister Tomiichi Murayama. Now Hashimoto became known at international conferences, but even when he assumed the premiership he was still locked in the domestic world of Japan's economic doldrums.\n\nHe was more successful in reforming government internally and streamlining its cumbersome cabinet structure, making possible its later reduction to 12 ministries and agencies. Diplomatically he adhered closely to the US military alliance, but persuaded the marines to reduce land holdings at a large base in the long-suffering Okinawa islands, where Hashimoto probably became most popular.\n\nHe promoted good relations with China and last March joined a group of Japanese politicians who met President Hu Jintao in Beijing in an effort to mend worsening relations between the two countries. But Hashimoto always supported what rankles China the most: the visits by Japanese politicians to the ultra-nationalist shrine in Tokyo, which commemorates war criminals who committed atrocities in China during the 1931-45 Japanese war there.\n\nHashimoto is survived by his wife, two sons and three daughters."
