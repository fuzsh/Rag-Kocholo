        "text": "(1937–2006). Hashimoto Ryutaro served as prime minister of Japan in 1996–98. He was known as much for his slicked-back hair and cigarette holder as he was for his conservative politics and talent for strong policy making. He left office after having failed to end a long-lasting economic recession in Japan.\n\nHashimoto was born on July 29, 1937, in Soja, Japan. He was the eldest son of Hashimoto Ryogo, who served as minister of education and minister of health and welfare in Japan’s Diet, or parliament. Hashimoto Ryutaro graduated from Keio University’s Faculty of Law in 1960 and then worked in a textile company. He was elected to the Diet in 1963 at age 26 to fill the seat left open by the death of his father the year before. Hashimoto went on to serve 11 terms in the Diet as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). At the age of 41, he became minister of health and welfare in the cabinet of Prime Minister Ohira Masayoshi.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1989, Hashimoto worked in many different aspects of the Diet and held a variety of positions. In the summer of 1989 he served as secretary-general of the LDP, a position second in command to the leader of the party. In 1989 Hashimoto was appointed minister of finance under Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki. In that capacity, Hashimoto concentrated on tax reform and was instrumental in boosting Japan’s financial commitment to the Persian Gulf War. His office, however, was tainted by scandal that year. A political secretary confessed to having helped arrange illegally handled bank loans for three of Hashimoto’s friends. Although never formally accused of being involved, Hashimoto resigned in order to show he was taking responsibility for the misdeeds of his office.\n\nHashimoto kept a low profile in the early 1990s, giving the scandal time to die down. In June 1994 he was appointed minister of international trade and industry in the cabinet of Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichi. Hashimoto concentrated on reforming trade relations and negotiations with other countries. He won national attention for his combative bargaining stance in an automobile trade dispute between Japan and the United States. In September 1995 Hashimoto, while still retaining his position as minister of trade, was elected president of the LDP.\n\nIn January 1996 Murayama stepped down, and Hashimoto campaigned to replace him. He intrigued voters both by his talent for policy making and by his charismatic personality. With his movie-star looks and his hobby of practicing kendo, a Japanese martial art in which duelists fight with heavy bamboo poles, Hashimoto presented a fresh face in Japanese politics. He was often criticized, however, for his sometimes harsh, conservative views. In 1994, for example, he had angered many by questioning whether Japan had committed aggression against other Asian countries during World War II. He had also blamed Japan’s low birthrate on Japanese women who seek higher education. Despite his critics, Hashimoto became prime minister in January 1996. He was viewed as a dynamic leader who would undertake much needed economic and financial reforms in order to end a recession that had lingered for five years and showed few signs of lifting.\n\nHowever, Hashimoto’s attempts to deregulate Japan’s financial sector and place its floundering banks on sounder footing were obstructed by his own party and made little progress. In 1997 his administration put into force a previously approved increase in the national sales tax. This measure was intended to reduce the country’s budget deficits but instead sent the Japanese economy into its most severe recession in several decades. In elections for the House of Councillors (the upper house of the Diet) held on July 12, 1998, the LDP won only about one-third of the seats contested. In the face of this stunning rebuke by the electorate, Hashimoto on July 13 announced his resignation as both prime minister and president of his party. He continued in office until he was succeeded by the party’s new president, Obuchi Keizo, on July 30 of that year."
