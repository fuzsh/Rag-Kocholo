        "text": "THAT the campaign for the leadership of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and, by extension, for the prime ministership, has been so animated and so hotly contested comes as a relief and a surprise to the party's bosses. When Yoshiro Mori, Japan's prime minister, last month announced his intention to stand down, there was an embarrassing shortage of candidates to replace him. Mr Mori's year-long tenure of the post has been marked by his own gaffes and blunders, by corruption scandals and by signs that the economy, far from being on the point of recovery, may be slipping back into recession. With elections for the upper house of parliament coming in July, the job of leading the Liberal Democratic Party, and hence of being prime minister, looked like a short-term and dangerous assignment. If the party fares very badly at the polls, then it might have to find another leader after just a few months."
