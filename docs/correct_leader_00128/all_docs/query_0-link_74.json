        "text": "Following the previous (July 1995) partial elections for the House of Councillors partial elections, Mr. Ryutaro Hashimoto (Liberal Democratic Party - LDP) became Prime Minister in early 1996 and formed a new coalition Government. In the October 1996 general elections for the House of Representatives, the LDP won an increased number of seats totalling 239 (it had lost its majority four years before).\n\nThe 1998 poll took place in the midst of a serious economic recession that was especially marked by high unemployment, budget deficit and bankruptcy rates. Polling day saw a relatively high turnout which contrasted with the general voter apathy evident in the campaigning period. Final results gave the LDP a mere 46 seats (of the 126 at stake and the 59 it was defending), its overall number of Councillors falling from 118 to a record low of 105, although there were some changes in the numerical strength of political parties subsequent to the official election returns as some members changed their party affiliation. In this context, Mr. Hashimoto, taking responsibility for this poor showing, announced his intention to resign from his post on 13 July and Mr. Keizo Obuchi became Prime Minister on 30 July; a new Cabinet was sworn in the same day."
