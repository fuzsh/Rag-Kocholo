        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, England -- Japan and the United States on Friday said government interference in the development of the Internet should be kept to a minimum.\n\nAfter holding talks ahead of the Group of Eight summit here, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and US President Bill Clinton issued a joint statement calling for the private sector to take the lead in developing the Net.\n\n\"Electronic commerce will be an engine of economic growth in the 21st century, with the potential to invigorate economies by enhancing productivity, streamlining distribution, and revamping corporate structure,\" the statement said. \"Both governments should avoid imposing unnecessary regulations or restrictions on electronic commerce.\"\n\nThe two governments also vowed that electronic transmissions should remain free of tariffs, saying they will \"work toward a global understanding\" to maintain the current \"duty-free environment.\"\n\nNext week, Clinton will attend a World Trade Organization meeting in Geneva, hoping to forge an agreement to keep electronic transmissions duty free. Earlier this month, the United States got the European Union to agree on working toward a \"standstill\" to keep the Net tariff-free, but was unable to gain a commitment for a permanent accord. The EU wants to establish a series of regulatory rules and agencies to monitor the Internet, although it has said that in principle it believes the Net should be free of tariffs.\n\nThe Clinton-Hashimoto statement also said the two nations would participate in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development work in developing a framework for the taxation of electronic commerce \"to prevent tax evasion and avoidance on the Internet.\""
