        "text": "Former Japanese prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, an outspoken politician who jousted with US officials over auto trade and brought \"Big Bang\" financial reforms to Tokyo, died yesterday at the age of 68.\n\nHashimoto, who retired from politics last September citing poor health, had undergone surgery to remove a large part of his intestine after being rushed to hospital on June 4, his son told a news conference. He died in a Tokyo hospital.\n\nHailed as a forceful leader who would tackle reform when he took office in 1996, Hashimoto ultimately faltered in the face of financial crisis, political scandals and economic stagnation.\n\nBy the time Hashimoto made a second run for the premiership in April 2001, losing out to reformist Junichiro Koizumi, he had become an emblem of his ruling party's resistance to change.\n\nHashimoto, a dapper, quick-tempered man who practised kendo fencing, himself once had a reputation as a popular reformer."
