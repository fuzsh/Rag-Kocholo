We calculate H1â¥ for light quarks of the Î hyperon, in the diquark spectator model with a Gaussian form factor for the hyperon-quark-diquark vertex. The model calculation includes contributions from both the scalar diquark and vector diquark spectators. Using the model result, we estimate the azimuthal asymmetry A12, which appears in the ratio of unlike-sign events to like-sign events contributed by double Collins effects, in the processes e+e-âÎ Î Â¯X and e+e-âÎ Ï X . The QCD evolution effects for the half kT moment of the Collins function and the unpolarized fragmentation function D1(z ) are also included. The results show that the asymmetries are sizable and measurable at the kinematical configurations of Belle and BABAR experiments. We also find that the evolution effects play an important role in the phenomenological analysis.\n\nQuasi-parton distribution functions: A study in the diquark spectator model\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nGamberg, Leonard; Kang, Zhong -Bo; Vitev, Ivan; ...\n\n2015-02-12\n\nA set of quasi-parton distribution functions (quasi-PDFs) have been recently proposed by Ji. Defined as the matrix elements of equal-time spatial correlations, they can be computed on the lattice and should reduce to the standard PDFs when the proton momentum P z is very large. Since taking the P z â â limit is not feasible in lattice simulations, it is essential to provide guidance for which values of P z the quasi-PDFs are good approximations of standard PDFs. Within the framework of the spectator diquark model, we evaluate both the up and down quarks' quasi-PDFs and standard PDFs formoreÂ Â» all leading-twist distributions (unpolarized distribution fâ, helicity distribution gâ, and transversity distribution hâ). We find that, for intermediate parton momentum fractions x , quasi-PDFs are good approximations to standard PDFs (within 20â30%) when P z â³ 1.5â2 GeV. On the other hand, for large x~1 much larger P z > 4 GeV is necessary to obtain a satisfactory agreement between the two sets. We further test the Soffer positivity bound, and find that it does not hold in general for quasi-PDFs.Â«Â less\n\nA new look at the Y tetraquarks and Î© _c baryons in the diquark model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAli, Ahmed; Maiani, Luciano; Borisov, Anatoly V.; Ahmed, Ishtiaq; Aslam, M. Jamil; Parkhomenko, Alexander Ya.; Polosa, Antonio D.; Rehman, Abdur\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe analyze the hidden charm P-wave tetraquarks in the diquark model, using an effective Hamiltonian incorporating the dominant spin-spin, spin-orbit and tensor interactions. We compare with other P-wave systems such as P-wave charmonia and the newly discovered Î© _c baryons, analysed recently in this framework. Given the uncertain experimental situation on the Y states, we allow for different spectra and discuss the related parameters in the diquark model. In addition to the presently observed ones, we expect many more states in the supermultiplet of L=1 diquarkonia, whose J^{PC} quantum numbers and masses are worked out, using the parameters from the currently preferred Y-states pattern. The existence of these new resonances would be a decisive footprint of the underlying diquark dynamics.\n\nThe stochastic spectator\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHardwick, Robert J.; Vennin, Vincent; Byrnes, Christian T.; Torrado, JesÃºs; Wands, David\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe study the stochastic distribution of spectator fields predicted in different slow-roll inflation backgrounds. Spectator fields have a negligible energy density during inflation but may play an important dynamical role later, even giving rise to primordial density perturbations within our observational horizon today. During de-Sitter expansion there is an equilibrium solution for the spectator field which is often used to estimate the stochastic distribution during slow-roll inflation. However slow roll only requires that the Hubble rate varies slowly compared to the Hubble time, while the time taken for the stochastic distribution to evolve to the de-Sitter equilibrium solution can be much longer than a Hubble time. We study both chaotic (monomial) and plateau inflaton potentials, with quadratic, quartic and axionic spectator fields. We give an adiabaticity condition for the spectator field distribution to relax to the de-Sitter equilibrium, and find that the de-Sitter approximation is never a reliable estimate for the typical distribution at the end of inflation for a quadratic spectator during monomial inflation. The existence of an adiabatic regime at early times can erase the dependence on initial conditions of the final distribution of field values. In these cases, spectator fields acquire sub-Planckian expectation values. Otherwise spectator fields may acquire much larger field displacements than suggested by the de-Sitter equilibrium solution. We quantify the information about initial conditions that can be obtained from the final field distribution. Our results may have important consequences for the viability of spectator models for the origin of structure, such as the simplest curvaton models.\n\nBaryon number and lepton universality violation in leptoquark and diquark models\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAssad, Nima; Fornal, Bartosz; Grinstein, BenjamÃ­n\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe perform a systematic study of models involving leptoquarks and diquarks with masses well below the grand unification scale and demonstrate that a large class of them is excluded due to rapid proton decay. After singling out the few phenomenologically viable color triplet and sextet scenarios, we show that there exist only two leptoquark models which do not suffer from tree-level proton decay and which have the potential for explaining the recently discovered anomalies in B meson decays. Both of those models, however, contain dimension five operators contributing to proton decay and require a new symmetry forbidding them to emerge at a higher scale. This has a particularly nice realization for the model with the vector leptoquark (3 , 1) 2 / 3, which points to a specific extension of the Standard Model, namely the Pati-Salam unification model, where this leptoquark naturally arises as the new gauge boson. We explore this possibility in light of recent B physics measurements. Finally, we analyze also a vector diquark model, discussing its LHC phenomenology and showing that it has nontrivial predictions for neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments.\n\nThe stochastic spectator\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHardwick, Robert J.; Vennin, Vincent; Wands, David\n\nWe study the stochastic distribution of spectator fields predicted in different slow-roll inflation backgrounds.

The quark densities for unpolarized and transversely polarized proton are also presented. We observe a Soffer bound for TMDs in this model.\n\nDiquark mass differences from unquenched lattice QCD\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBi, Yujiang; Cai, Hao; Chen, Ying; Gong, Ming; Liu, Zhaofeng; Qiao, Hao-Xue; Yang, Yi-Bo\n\n2016-07-01\n\nWe calculate diquark correlation functions in the Landau gauge on the lattice using overlap valence quarks and 2+1-flavor domain wall fermion configurations. Quark masses are extracted from the scalar part of quark propagators in the Landau gauge. The scalar diquark quark mass difference and axial vector scalar diquark mass difference are obtained for diquarks composed of two light quarks and of a strange and a light quark. The light sea quark mass dependence of the results is examined. Two lattice spacings are used to check the discretization effects. The coarse and fine lattices are of sizes 243 Ã 64 and 323 Ã 64 with inverse spacings 1/a = 1.75(4) GeV and 2.33(5) GeV, respectively.

In this paper, we discuss the effect of Hubble induced masses on the dynamics of spectator fields after inflation. We pay particular attention to the Hubble induced mass by the kinetic energy of an oscillating inflaton, which is generically unsuppressed but often overlooked. In the curvaton scenario, the Hubble induced mass relaxes the constraint on the property of the inflaton and the curvaton, such as the reheating temperature andmoreÂ Â» the inflation scale. We comment on the implication of our discussion for baryogenesis in the curvaton scenario. In the modulated reheating, the predictions of models e.g. the non-gaussianity can be considerably altered. Furthermore, we propose a new model of the modulated reheating utilizing the Hubble induced mass which realizes a wide range of the local non-gaussianity parameter.Â«Â less\n\nImplications of heavy quark-diquark symmetry for excited doubly heavy baryons and tetraquarks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMehen, Thomas\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe give heavy quark-diquark symmetry predictions for doubly heavy baryons and tetraquarks in light of the recent discovery of the Îcc ++ by LHCb. For five excited doubly charm baryons that are predicted to lie below the ÎcD threshold, we give predictions for their electromagnetic and strong decays using a previously developed chiral Lagrangian with heavy quark-diquark symmetry. Based on the mass of the Îcc ++, the existence of a doubly heavy bottom I =0 tetraquark that is stable to strong and electromagnetic decays has been predicted. If the mass of this state is below 10405 MeV, as predicted in some models, we argue using heavy quark-diquark symmetry that the JP=1+ I =1 doubly bottom tetraquark state will lie just below the open bottom threshold and likely be a narrow state as well. In this scenario, we compute strong decay width for this state using a new Lagrangian for doubly heavy tetraquarks which is related to the singly heavy baryon Lagrangian by heavy quark-diquark symmetry.\n\n``Wounded'' quarks and diquarks in high energy collisions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBialas, A.; Bzdak, A.\n\n2008-03-01\n\nParticle production in Au-Au, Cu-Cu, d-Au, and p-p collisions at 200 GeV c.m. energy are analyzed in the wounded quark-diquark model. Existing data are well reproduced. Emission functions of wounded and unwounded constituents are determined. Implications for the collective evolution of the system are discussed.\n\nWounded quarks and diquarks in heavy ion collisions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBialas, A.; Bzdak, A.\n\n2007-06-01\n\nA model in which the soft collisions of the nucleon are described in terms of interactions of its two constituents (a quark and a diquark) is proposed. When adjusted to describe precisely the elastic proton-proton scattering data and supplemented with the idea of wounded constituents, the model accounts rather well for the centrality dependence of particle production in the central rapidity region at RHIC energies.\n\nDecays ÎbâÎbÏ and diquark correlations in hyperons\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Xin; Voloshin, M. B.\n\n2014-08-01\n\nThe decays ÎbâÎbÏ are strangeness changing weak transitions involving only the light diquark in the baryon. Thus these decays can test the properties of such diquarks, in particular the suggestions existing in the literature of enhanced correlations in JP=0+ light diquarks. We revisit the estimates of the rates of these decays and point out that with the enhanced correlation their branching fraction can reach a few percent and may become visible in the measurements of differences of the lifetimes of b baryons.\n\nSpectroscopy of exotic hadrons formed from dynamical diquarks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLebed, Richard F.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe dynamical diquark picture asserts that exotic hadrons can be formed from widely separated colored diquark or triquark components. We use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation to study the spectrum of states thus constructed, both in the basis of diquark spins and in the basis of heavy quark-antiquark spins. We develop a compact notation for naming these states, and use the results of lattice simulations for hybrid mesons to predict the lowest expected BO potentials for both tetraquarks and pentaquarks. We then compare to the set of exotic candidates with experimentally determined quantum numbers, and find that all of them can be accommodated. Once decay modes are also considered, one can develop selection rules of both exact (JP C conservation) and approximate (within the context of the BO approximation) types and test their effectiveness. We find that the most appealing way to satisfy both sets of selection rules requires including additional low-lying BO potentials, a hypothesis that can be checked on the lattice.\n\nNeutral and charged scalar mesons, pseudoscalar mesons, and diquarks in magnetic fields\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Hao; Wang, Xinyang; Yu, Lang; Huang, Mei\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe investigate both (pseudo)scalar mesons and diquarks in the presence of external magnetic field in the framework of the two-flavored Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, where mesons and diquarks are constructed by infinite sum of quark-loop chains by using random phase approximation. The polarization function of the quark-loop is calculated to the leading order of 1 /Nc expansion by taking the quark propagator in the Landau level representation. We systematically investigate the masses behaviors of scalar Ï meson, neutral and charged pions as well as the scalar diquarks, with respect to the magnetic field strength at finite temperature and chemical potential. It is shown that the numerical results of both neutral and charged pions are consistent with the lattice QCD simulations. The mass of the charge neutral pion keeps almost a constant under the magnetic field, which is preserved by the remnant symmetry of QCD ÃQED in the vacuum. The mass of the charge neutral scalar Ï is around two times quark mass and increases with the magnetic field due to the magnetic catalysis effect, which is an typical example showing that the polarized internal quark structure cannot be neglected when we consider the meson properties under magnetic field. For the charged particles, the one quark-antiquark loop contribution to the charged ÏÂ± increases essentially with the increase of magnetic fields due to the magnetic catalysis of the polarized quarks. However, the one quark-quark loop contribution to the scalar diquark mass is negative comparing with the point-particle result and the loop effect is small.\n\nSpectator motives and points of attachment: an investigation on professional basketball.\n\nPubMed\n\nGencer, R Timucin; Kiremitci, Olcay; Boyacioglu, Hayal\n\n2011-12-01\n\nSpectator attendance to professional basketball in Turkey is significantly less than desired. Keeping in mind how important spectators are for team sports, understanding factors that affect game attendance will offer essential clues in terms of increasing spectator attendance. The main purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between basketball spectators' motives and points of attachment. With consideration to this purpose, the present study has tested the validity and reliability of the Motivation Scale for Sport Consumption and the Points of Attachment Index for Turkish basketball spectators. 197 basketball spectators participated in the study. Confirmatory factor analysis results demonstrated that the original models of the measurement tools employed for the study showed an acceptable degree of fit with the data. The internal consistency coefficients of the scales were found to be between 0.59 and 0.80 for the Motivation Scale for Sport Consumption and between 0.53 and 0.88 for the Points of Attachment Index. The canonical correlation analysis only returned a single significant function. The motives aesthetics and escape stood out in terms of the significant function, while the sport type (basketball in this study) stood out in the sense of attachment. Relationships identified between basketball spectators' motives and points of attachment could help sports managers and marketing experts to develop strategies focusing on increasing spectator attendance to their teams' games.\n\nQuark model with chiral-symmetry breaking and confinement in the Covariant Spectator Theory\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBiernat, Elmer P.; Pena, Maria Teresa; Ribiero, Jose' Emilio F.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nWe propose a model for the quark-antiquark interaction in Minkowski space using the Covariant Spectator Theory. We show that with an equal-weighted scalar-pseudoscalar structure for the confining part of our interaction kernel the axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity is preserved and our model complies with the Adler-zero constraint for pi-pi-scattering imposed by chiral symmetry.\n\n$X(3873$ and $Y(4140)$ using diquark-antidiquark operators with lattice QCD\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nPadmanath, M.; Lang, C.â B.; Prelovsek Komelj, Sasa\n\n2015-08-01\n\nWe perform a lattice study of charmonium-like mesons withmoreÂ Â» $$J^{PC}=1^{++}$$ and three quark contents $$\\\\bar cc \\\\bar du$$, $$\\\\bar cc(\\\\bar uu+\\\\bar dd)$$ and $$\\\\bar cc \\\\bar ss$$, where the later two can mix with $$\\\\bar cc$$. This simulation with $$N_f=2$$ and $$m_\\\\pi=266$$ MeV aims at the possible signatures of four-quark exotic states. We utilize a large basis of $$\\\\bar cc$$, two-meson and diquark-antidiquark interpolating fields, with diquarks in both anti-triplet and sextet color representations. A lattice candidate for X(3872) with I=0 is observed very close to the experimental state only if both $$\\\\bar cc$$ and $$D\\\\bar D^*$$ interpolators are included; the candidate is not found if diquark-antidiquark and $$D\\\\bar D^*$$ are used in the absence of $$\\\\bar cc$$. No candidate for neutral or charged X(3872), or any other exotic candidates are found in the I=1 channel. We also do not find signatures of exotic $$\\\\bar cc\\\\bar ss$$ candidates below 4.3 GeV, such as Y(4140). Possible physics and methodology related reasons for that are discussed. Along the way, we present the diquark-antidiquark operators as linear combinations of the two-meson operators via the Fierz transformations.Â«Â less\n\nSpectator Motives and Points of Attachment: an Investigation on Professional Basketball\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGencer, R.

A comparison to data (described very well up to -t approx 2 GeV2/c) allows to determine some properties of the constituents. While quark turns out fairly small, the diquark appears to be rather large, comparable to the size of the proton.\n\nMultiple spectator condensates from inflation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHardwick, Robert J.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe investigate the development of spectator (light test) field condensates due to their quantum fluctuations in a de Sitter inflationary background, making use of the stochastic formalism to describe the system. In this context, a condensate refers to the typical field value found after a coarse-graining using the Hubble scale H, which can be essential to seed the initial conditions required by various post-inflationary processes. We study models with multiple coupled spectators and for the first time we demonstrate that new forms of stationary solution exist (distinct from the standard exponential form) when the potential is asymmetric. Furthermore, we find a critical value for the inter-field coupling as a function of the number of fields above which the formation of stationary condensates collapses to H. Considering some simple two-field example potentials, we are also able to derive a lower limit on the coupling, below which the fluctuations are effectively decoupled, and the standard stationary variance formulae for each field separately can be trusted. These results are all numerically verified by a new publicly available python class (nfield) to solve the coupled Langevin equations over a large number of fields, realisations and timescales. Further applications of this new tool are also discussed.\n\nChiral Lagrangian with Heavy Quark-Diquark Symmetry\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJie Hu; Thomas Mehen\n\n2005-11-29\n\nWe construct a chiral Lagrangian for doubly heavy baryons and heavy mesons that is invariant under heavy quark-diquark symmetry at leading order and includes the leading O(1/m{sub Q}) symmetry violating operators. The theory is used to predict the electromagnetic decay width of the J=3/2 member of the ground state doubly heavy baryon doublet. Numerical estimates are provided for doubly charm baryons. We also calculate chiral corrections to doubly heavy baryon masses and strong decay widths of low lying excited doubly heavy baryons.\n\nPublicizing female athletes' weights: implications for female psychology undergraduates acting as spectators.\n\nPubMed\n\nHolm-Denoma, Jill; Smith, April; Waesche, Matthew\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the effects of including female athletes' weights in athletic event programs on female spectators' body image, eating disorder symptoms, self-esteem, and affective state and to investigate whether the magnitude of the athletes' reported weights had differential effects on female spectators (i.e., do female spectators who view heavier athletes respond differently than those who view less heavy athletes?). We used an experimental design to examine hypotheses derived from competing theories to determine whether exposure to female athletes of varying weight would adversely or beneficially impact female undergraduates (N = 152) who served as athletic event spectators. Analyses indicated that in this simulated study, female spectators' body image, eating disorder symptoms, self-esteem, and affective states were not impacted by the presence or by the magnitude of female athletes' weights in athletic event programs. The results imply that including athletes' weights in game-day programs at women's athletic events does not affect female spectators on an individual level.\n\nSpectators Control Selectivity in Surface Chemistry: Acrolein Partial Hydrogenation Over Pd\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe present a mechanistic study on selective hydrogenation of acrolein over model Pd surfacesâboth single crystal Pd(111) and Pd nanoparticles supported on a model oxide support. We show for the first time that selective hydrogenation of the C=O bond in acrolein to form an unsaturated alcohol is possible over Pd(111) with nearly 100% selectivity. However, this process requires a very distinct modification of the Pd(111) surface with an overlayer of oxopropyl spectator species that are formed from acrolein during the initial stages of reaction and turn the metal surface selective toward propenol formation. By applying pulsed multimolecular beam experiments and in situ infrared reflectionâabsorption spectroscopy, we identified the chemical nature of the spectator and the reactive surface intermediate (propenoxy species) and experimentally followed the simultaneous evolution of the reactive intermediate on the surface and formation of the product in the gas phase.

The reaction mechanism is studied within the framework of the ÎN-correlation model, which considers the isobar and nucleon of the ÎN-system produced in the nucleus at the virtual NN â ÎN transition to be in a dynamic relationship. The two-particle transition operator for nuclei is obtained by the S-matrix approach. We consider the properties of the spectator mechanism of isobar production using the example of the reaction 16O(Î³,Ïâpn)14O. Numerical estimates of the cross-section are obtained in the kinematic region, where it is possible to expect the manifestation of bound isobar-nuclear states.\n\nAthletic Events and Spectacular Spectators: A Longitudinal Study of Fan Aggression.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBryan, Clifford; Horton, Robert\n\nAthletic programs in the public schools and colleges are often justified by assertions that competitive team sports build character and sportsmanship for participants and spectators, and that sports reinforce such school and community ideals as the virtues of competition, patriotism, and the desirability of healthy living.

However, knowledge is scarce about whether or not alcohol is served to obviously intoxicated spectators at licensed premises inside and outside the sporting arenas, and if obviously intoxicated spectators are allowed entrance to these events. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the occurrences of overserving at licensed premises inside and outside arenas, and of allowed entry of obviously intoxicated spectators into arenas. An observational study assessing the rate of denied alcohol service and denied entry to arenas of trained professional actors portraying a standardized scene of obvious alcohol intoxication (i.e., pseudo-patrons) was conducted. The scene was developed by an expert panel, and each attempt was monitored by an observer. The settings were 2 arenas hosting matches in the Swedish Premier Football League in the largest city in Sweden and 1 arena in the second largest city, including entrances and licensed premises inside and outside the arenas. The rates of denied alcohol service were 66.9% at licensed premises outside the arenas (nÂ =Â 151) and 24.9% at premises inside the arenas (nÂ =Â 237). The rate of denied entry to the arenas (nÂ =Â 102) was 10.8%. Overserving and allowed entry of obviously alcohol-intoxicated spectators are problematic at sporting events in Sweden and may contribute to high overall intoxication levels among spectators. The differences in server intervention rates indicate that serving staff at licensed premises inside the arenas and entrance staff are not likely to have been trained in responsible beverage service. This result underscores the need for server training among staff at the arenas.

Field observations suggest that they may enhance social cohesion and that their effects are not limited to those actively performing but affect the audience as well. Here we show physiological effects of synchronized arousal in a Spanish fire-walking ritual, between active participants and related spectators, but not participants and other members of the audience. We assessed arousal by heart rate dynamics and applied nonlinear mathematical analysis to heart rate data obtained from 38 participants. We compared synchronized arousal between fire-walkers and spectators. For this comparison, we used recurrence quantification analysis on individual data and cross-recurrence quantification analysis on pairs of participants' data. These methods identified fine-grained commonalities of arousal during the 30-min ritual between fire-walkers and related spectators but not unrelated spectators. This indicates that the mediating mechanism may be informational, because participants and related observers had very different bodily behavior. This study demonstrates that a collective ritual may evoke synchronized arousal over time between active participants and bystanders. It links field observations to a physiological basis and offers a unique approach for the quantification of social effects on human physiology during real-world interactions.

The evolution of spectator electric fields in conformally flat background geometries is occasionally concocted by postulating the existence of ad hoc currents, but this apparently innocuous trick violates the second law of thermodynamics. Such a problem occurs, in particular, for those configurations (customarily employed for the analysis of the Schwinger effect in four-dimensional de Sitter backgrounds) leading to an electric energy density which is practically unaffected by the expansion of the underlying geometry. The obtained results are compared with more mundane situations where Joule heating develops in the early stages of a quasi-de Sitter phase.\n\nDynamical evolution of spectator systems produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMazurek, K.; Szczurek, A.; Schmitt, C.; Nadtochy, P. N.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn peripheral heavy-ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies, usually only parts of the colliding nuclei effectively interact with each other. In the overlapping zone, a fireball or quark-gluon plasma is produced. The excitation energy of the heavy remnant can range from a few tens to several hundreds of MeV, depending on the impact parameter. The decay of these excited spectators is investigated in this work for the first time within a dynamical approach based on the multidimensional stochastic Langevin equation. The potential of this exploratory work to understand the connection between electromagnetic fields generated by the heavy spectators and measured pion distributions is discussed.\n\nMotor Simulation without Motor Expertise: Enhanced Corticospinal Excitability in Visually Experienced Dance Spectators\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJola, Corinne; Abedian-Amiri, Ali; Kuppuswamy, Annapoorna; Pollick, Frank E.; Grosbras, Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe human âmirror-systemâ is suggested to play a crucial role in action observation and execution, and is characterized by activity in the premotor and parietal cortices during the passive observation of movements. The previous motor experience of the observer has been shown to enhance the activity in this network. Yet visual experience could also have a determinant influence when watching more complex actions, as in dance performances. Here we tested the impact visual experience has on motor simulation when watching dance, by measuring changes in corticospinal excitability. We also tested the effects of empathic abilities. To fully match the participants' long-term visual experience with the present experimental setting, we used three live solo dance performances: ballet, Indian dance, and non-dance. Participants were either frequent dance spectators of ballet or Indian dance, or ânovicesâ who never watched dance. None of the spectators had been physically trained in these dance styles. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to measure corticospinal excitability by means of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in both the hand and the arm, because the hand is specifically used in Indian dance and the arm is frequently engaged in ballet dance movements. We observed that frequent ballet spectators showed larger MEP amplitudes in the arm muscles when watching ballet compared to when they watched other performances. We also found that the higher Indian dance spectators scored on the fantasy subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, the larger their MEPs were in the arms when watching Indian dance. Our results show that even without physical training, corticospinal excitability can be enhanced as a function of either visual experience or the tendency to imaginatively transpose oneself into fictional characters. We suggest that spectators covertly simulate the movements for which they have acquired visual experience, and that empathic abilities heighten\n\nMotivational Factors for Evaluating Sport Spectator and Participant Markets.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMcDonald, Mark A.; Milne, George R.; Hong, JinBae\n\n2002-01-01\n\nSuggests a motivations framework to organize constructs for evaluating sport consumption.

As a source of perturbations, we consider either an inflaton field with a running spectral index or a spectator field that has a blue spectrum and thus provides a significant contribution to PBH production at small scales. First, we identify the region of the parameter space where a significant fraction of the observed dark matter can be produced, taking into account all current PBH constraints. Then, we present constraints on the amplitude and spectral index of the spectator field as a function of the reheating temperature. We also derive constraints on the running of the inflaton spectral index, d n /d ln k â²0.001 , which are comparable to those from the Planck satellite for a scenario where the spectator field is absent.\n\nElectron-deuteron DIS with spectator tagging at EIC: Development of theoretical framework\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCosyn, Wim B.; Guzey, Vadim A.; Sargsian, Misak M.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nAn Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) would enable next-generation measurements of deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) on the deuteron with detection of a forward-moving nucleon (p, n) and measurement of its recoil momentum (\"spectator tagging''). Such experiments offer full control of the nuclear configuration during the high-energy process and can be used for precision studies of the neutron's partonic structure and its spin dependence, nuclear modifications of partonic structure, and nuclear shadowing at small x. We review the theoretical description of spectator tagging at EIC energies (light-front nuclear structure, on-shell extrapolation in the recoil nucleon momentum, final-state interactions, diffractive effects at small x) andmoreÂ Â» report about on-going developments.Â«Â less\n\nSports spectator behavior: a test of the theory of planned behavior.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Wan-Chen; Lin, Shin-Huei; Cheng, Chih-Fu\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe theory of planned behavior has been applied to sports and exercise behaviors. According to this theory, human intention to take action in a specific context is guided by three antecedents: attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Behavioral intention mediates the relationships between these three considerations and its ultimate performance. However, this theory has seldom been applied to the behaviors of spectators of sporting events. A sample of 269 volleyball spectators in Taiwan was studied to examine whether people's intention mediated their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control toward a given behavior, watching the 2010 FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Volleyball World Grand Prix in Taipei. Regression analyses did not support behavioral intention as a mediator. This result is discussed in the context of planned behavior.\n\nAlcohol intoxication at Swedish football matches: A study using biological sampling to assess blood alcohol concentration levels among spectators.\n\nPubMed\n\nDurbeej, Natalie; ElgÃ¡n, Tobias H; Jalling, Camilla; Gripenberg, Johanna\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAlcohol use and alcohol-related problems, including accidents, vandalism and violence, at sporting events are of increased concern in Sweden and other countries. The relationship between alcohol use and violence has been established and can be explained by the level of intoxication. Given the occurrence of alcohol use and alcohol-related problems at sporting events, research has assessed intoxication levels measured through biological sampling among spectators. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the level of alcohol intoxication among spectators at football matches in the Swedish Premier Football League. Spectators were randomly selected and invited to participate in the study. Alcohol intoxication was measured with a breath analyser for Blood Alcohol Concentration levels, and data on gender, age, and recent alcohol use were gathered through a face-to-face interview. Blood Alcohol Concentration samples from 4420 spectators were collected. Almost half (46.8%) had a positive Blood Alcohol Concentration level, with a mean value of 0.063%, while 8.9% had a Blood Alcohol Concentration level â¥ 0.1%, with a mean value of 0.135%. Factors that predicted a higher Blood Alcohol Concentration level included male gender (p = 0.005), lower age (p < 0.001), attending a local derby (p < 0.001), alcohol use prior to having entered the arena (p < 0.001), attending a weekend match (p < 0.001), and being a spectator at supporter sections (p < 0.001). About half of all spectators at football matches in the Swedish Premier Football League drink alcohol in conjunction with the match. Approximately one tenth have a high level of alcohol intoxication.\n\nRelationships between thrill seeking, speeding attitudes, and driving violations among a sample of motorsports spectators and drivers.\n\nPubMed\n\nYÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m-Yenier, ZÃ¼mrÃ¼t; Vingilis, Evelyn; Wiesenthal, David L; Mann, Robert E; Seeley, Jane\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMotor racing includes high speed driving and risky maneuvers and can result in negative outcomes for both spectators and drivers. Interest in motorsports is also associated with risky driving attitudes and behaviors on public roads as well as with individual difference variables, such as sensation seeking. However, whether the links between motorsports involvement and risky driving tendencies differ for spectators and drivers has remained mainly unexamined. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between thrill seeking, attitudes toward speeding, and self-reported driving violations among a sample of motorsports spectators and drivers. A web-based survey was conducted and sampled 408 members and visitors of car club and racing websites in Ontario, Canada. The questionnaire included measures of (i) motorsports involvement, (ii) thrill seeking (Driver Thrill Seeking Scale), (iii) attitudes (Attitudes toward Speed Limits on Roadways and Competitive Attitudes toward Driving Scale); (iv) self-reported driving violations (adapted from Driver Behaviour Questionnaire), and (v) background variables. Path analysis was performed to test the relationships among the variables. For both spectators and drivers, thrill seeking directly predicted driving violations; competitive attitudes toward driving further mediated this relationship. Attitudes toward speed limits, however, mediated the relationship between thrill seeking and violations only for drivers. We observed significant relationships among individual difference measures, motorsports involvement, speeding attitudes and violations that may inform road safety interventions, including differences in the relationships among thrill seeking, speeding attitudes, and violations for motorsports spectators and drivers.

E.; ...\n\n2014-11-14\n\nThe Ï-Ï scattering amplitude calculated with a model for the quark-antiquark interaction in the framework of the Covariant Spectator Theory (CST) is shown to satisfy the Adler zero constraint imposed by chiral symmetry. The CST formalism is established in Minkowski space and our calculations are performed in momentum space. We prove that the axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity is satisfied by our model. Then we show that, similarly to what happens within the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, application of the axial-vector Ward Takahashi identity to the CST Ï-Ï scattering amplitude allows us to sum the intermediate quark-quark interactions to all orders. Thus, the AdlermoreÂ Â» self-consistency zero for Ï-Ï scattering in the chiral limit emerges as the result for this sum.Â«Â less\n\nThe effect of rugby match outcome on spectator aggression and intention to drink alcohol.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoore, Simon C; Shepherd, Jonathan P; Eden, Sam; Sivarajasingam, Vaseekaran\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAlcohol, aggression and assault injury are strongly associated with popular sporting events, but mediating factors are not clear. To explore aggression, happiness and plans to consume alcohol among spectators before and spectators after sports matches. Cross-sectional surveys of male rugby football fans at an international stadium generated four groups: a pre-match group of 111 men, and three post-match groups of supporters, 17 whose team had won, 23 whose team had lost and 46 whose team had drawn. Consenting participants were assessed using the assault sub-scale of the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory, on a self-rating of happiness (Likert scale), for planned alcohol consumption and demographic variables. Pre- and post-match group mean responses were compared. Analyses were performed on 197 male spectators (mean age 42 years). Spectators in 'win' (z = 2.63, p < 0.01) and 'draw' (z = 2.76, p < 0.01) groups rated themselves as more aggressive than those in the pre-game group, but those in the losing group did not (z = -0.03, p > 0.05). No differences, however, were observed between pre-match, 'win', 'draw' or 'lose' groups on the decision to drink after the match. Winning did not increase happiness (t = 0.25, p > 0.05), but losing (t = 2.09, p < 0.05) or drawing (t = 7.64, p < 0.001) decreased it. This study suggests that team success but not failure may increase aggression among supporters, and that aggression, not celebration, drives post-match alcohol consumption. Losing and drawing decreased happiness but winning did not increase it. Better understanding of pathways to violence in these circumstances will pave the way for more effective prevention and management strategies.\n\nCharge-conjugation symmetric complete impulse approximation for the pion electromagnetic form factor in the covariant spectator theory\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBiernat, Elmar P.; Gross, Franz; PeÃ±a, M. T.; ...\n\n2015-10-26\n\nThe pion form factor is calculated in the framework of the charge-conjugation invariant covariant spectator theory. This formalism is established in Minkowski space, and the calculation is set up in momentum space. In a previous calculation we included only the leading pole coming from the spectator quark (referred to as the relativistic impulse approximation). In this study we also include the contributions from the poles of the quark which interacts with the photon and average over all poles in both the upper and lower half-planes in order to preserve charge conjugation invariance (referred to as the C-symmetric complete impulse approximation).moreÂ Â» We find that for small pion mass these contributions are significant at all values of the four-momentum transfer Q 2 but, surprisingly, do not alter the shape obtained from the spectator poles alone.Â«Â less\n\nThermal inflation with a thermal waterfall scalar field coupled to a light spectator scalar field\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDimopoulos, Konstantinos; Lyth, David H.; Rumsey, Arron\n\n2017-05-01\n\nA new model of thermal inflation is introduced, in which the mass of the thermal waterfall field is dependent on a light spectator scalar field. Using the Î´ N formalism, the \"end of inflation\" scenario is investigated in order to ascertain whether this model is able to produce the dominant contribution to the primordial curvature perturbation. A multitude of constraints are considered so as to explore the parameter space, with particular emphasis on key observational signatures. For natural values of the parameters, the model is found to yield a sharp prediction for the scalar spectral index and its running, well within the current observational bounds.\n\nParticipant and spectator scaling of spectator fragments in Au + Au and Cu + Cu collisions at â{sN N}=19.6 and 22.4 GeV\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlver, B.; Back, B.

H.; Wyngaardt, S.; WysÅouch, B.; Phobos Collaboration\n\n2016-08-01\n\nSpectator fragments resulting from relativistic heavy ion collisions, consisting of single protons and neutrons along with groups of stable nuclear fragments up to nitrogen (Z =7 ), are measured in PHOBOS. These fragments are observed in Au+Au (â{sNN}=19.6 GeV ) and Cu+Cu (22.4 GeV) collisions at high pseudorapidity (Î· ). The dominant multiply-charged fragment is the tightly bound helium (Î± ), with lithium, beryllium, and boron all clearly seen as a function of collision centrality and pseudorapidity. We observe that in Cu+Cu collisions, it becomes much more favorable for the Î± fragments to be released than lithium. The yields of fragments approximately scale with the number of spectator nucleons, independent of the colliding ion. The shapes of the pseudorapidity distributions of fragments indicate that the average deflection of the fragments away from the beam direction increases for more central collisions. A detailed comparison of the shapes for Î± and lithium fragments indicates that the centrality dependence of the deflections favors a scaling with the number of participants in the collision.\n\nFootball match spectator sound exposure and effect on hearing: a pretest-post-test study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSwanepoel, De Wet; Hall, James W\n\n2010-03-30\n\nTo determine (i) noise exposure levels of spectators at a FIFA 2010 designated training stadium during a premier soccer league match; and (ii) changes in auditory functioning after the match. This was a one-group pretest-post-test design of football spectators attending a premier soccer league match at a designated FIFA 2010 training stadium in Gauteng, South Africa. Individual spectator noise exposure for the duration of the football match and post-match changes in hearing thresholds were measured with pure-tone audiometry, and cochlear functioning was measured with distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The average sound exposure level during the match was 100.5 LAeq (dBA), with peak intensities averaging 140.4 dB(C). A significant (p=0.005) deterioration of post-match hearing thresholds was evident at 2 000 Hz, and post-match DPOAE amplitudes were significantly reduced at 1,266, 3,163 and 5,063 Hz (p=0.011, 0.019, 0.013, respectively). Exposure levels exceeded limits of permissible average and peak sound levels. Significant changes in post-match hearing thresholds and cochlear responsiveness highlight the possible risk for noise-induced hearing loss. Public awareness and personal hearing protection should be prioritized as preventive measures.\n\nUnderstanding the drivers on medical workloads: an analysis of spectators at the Australian Football League.\n\nPubMed\n\nZeitz, Kathryn; Haghighi, Pari Delir; Burstein, Frada; Williams, Jeffrey\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe present study was designed to further understand the psychosocial drivers of crowds impacting on the demand for healthcare. This involved analysing different spectator crowds for medical usage at mass gatherings; more specifically, did different football team spectators (of the Australian Football League) generate different medical usage rates. In total, 317 games were analysed from 10 venues over 2 years. Data were analysed by the ANOVA and Pearson correlation tests. RESULTS; Spectators who supported different football teams generated statistically significant differences in patient presentation rates (PPR) (F15, 618=1.998, P=0.014). The present study confirmed previous findings that there is a positive correlation between the crowd size and PPR at mass gatherings but found a negative correlation between density and PPR (r = -0.206, n=317, P<0.0005). The present study has attempted to scientifically explore psychosocial elements of crowd behaviour as a driver of demand for emergency medical care. In measuring demand for emergency medical services there is a need to develop a more sophisticated understanding of a variety of drivers in addition to traditional metrics such as temperature, crowd size and other physical elements. In this study we saw that spectators who supported different football teams generated statistically significant differences in PPR. What is known about this topic? Understanding the drivers of emergency medical care is most important in the mass gathering setting. There has been minimal analysis of psychological 'crowd' variables. What does this paper add? This study explores the psychosocial impact of supporting a different team on the PPR of spectators at Australian Football League matches. The value of collecting and analysing these types of data sets is to support more balanced planning, better decision support and knowledge management, and more effective emergency medical demand management. What are the implications for practitioners\n\n\"Some like it hot\": spectators who score high on the personality trait openness enjoy the excitement of hearing dancers breathing without music.\n\nPubMed\n\nJola, Corinne; Pollick, Frank E; Calvo-Merino, Beatriz\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMusic is an integral part of dance. Over the last 10 years, however, dance stimuli (without music) have been repeatedly used to study action observation processes, increasing our understanding of the influence of observer's physical abilities on action perception. Moreover, beyond trained skills and empathy traits, very little has been investigated on how other observer or spectators' properties modulate action observation and action preference. Since strong correlations have been shown between music and personality traits, here we aim to investigate how personality traits shape the appreciation of dance when this is presented with three different music/sounds. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between personality traits and the subjective esthetic experience of 52 spectators watching a 24 min lasting contemporary dance performance projected on a big screen containing three movement phrases performed to three different sound scores: classical music (i.e., Bach), an electronic sound-score, and a section without music but where the breathing of the performers was audible. We found that first, spectators rated the experience of watching dance without music significantly different from with music. Second, we found that the higher spectators scored on the Big Five personality factor openness, the more they liked the no-music section. Third, spectators' physical experience with dance was not linked to their appreciation but was significantly related to high average extravert scores. For the first time, we showed that spectators' reported entrainment to watching dance movements without music is strongly related to their personality and thus may need to be considered when using dance as a means to investigate action observation processes and esthetic preferences.\n\nQuark Mass Functions and Pion Structure in the Covariant Spectator Theory\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBiernat, Elmar P.; Gross, Franz; Pena, Teresa; ...\n\n2018-05-24\n\nThe Covariant Spectator Theory is applied to the description of quarks and the pion.

A negative slope of the rapidity-odd directed flow component with approximately 3 times smaller magnitude than found at the highest RHIC energy is observed. This suggests a smaller longitudinal tilt of the initial system and disfavors the strong fireball rotation predicted for the LHC energies. The rapidity-even directed flow component is measured for the first time with spectators and found to be independent of pseudorapidity with a sign change at transverse momenta p(T) between 1.2 and 1.7ââGeV/c. Combined with the observation of a vanishing rapidity-even p(T) shift along the spectator deflection this is strong evidence for dipolelike initial density fluctuations in the overlap zone of the nuclei. Similar trends in the rapidity-even directed flow and the estimate from two-particle correlations at midrapidity, which is larger by about a factor of 40, indicate a weak correlation between fluctuating participant and spectator symmetry planes. These observations open new possibilities for investigation of the initial conditions in heavy-ion collisions with spectator nucleons.\n\nSynchronization, Attention and Transformation: Multidimensional Exploration of the Aesthetic Experience of Contemporary Dance Spectators\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJoufflineau, Coline; Vincent, Coralie; Bachrach, Asaf\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe co-presence of bodies in intersubjective situations can give rise to processes of kinesthetic empathy and physiological synchronization, especially in the context of dance: the body and attention of the spectators are oriented towards the dancers. In this study, we investigate the processes of âbody-mindâ resonance between a choreography and its spectators, and more specifically the lasting impact of this resonance post-performance. We then explore the relation between the observed effects and subjective measures of attention. The study focuses on the work of the French choreographer Myriam Gourfink, who develops a unique movement, based on the slower breathing of dancers: the breathing generates an extremely slow movement without rhythmic ruptures. Phenomenological studies of her work report changes in temporal perception and changes in bodily attentional states. We made use of two cognitive tasks in order to quantify this change in temporal perception: Spontaneous Motor Tempo (SMT) and Apparent Motion effect (AM) before and after a 40-min live performance. Subjective reports were collected at the end of the performance. Physiological data were recorded before and after the performance. We performed a control experiment with a choreography of a distinctly different quality of movement. Post-Gourfink performance, we observed a significant deceleration of SMT and a decrease in its variability, while AM was reported with longer temporal intervals. Neither of these effects was observed in the control condition. Furthermore, an increase in perception of AM was correlated with a slower breathing rate after the performance. Correlations with subjective reports suggest a link between changes in cognitive and physiological dynamics and the degree of absorption of the spectators in the performance. In addition, these changes were related to specific reported attentional dispositions that we interpret as a form of attentional resonance.

A prospective, structured questionnaire regarding facilities, transportation, medications and equipment, personnel configuration, compensation, and communications was mailed to all 28 NFL organizations. Those falling to respond were interviewed by telephone using the identical questionnaire. Data were compiled using Lotus 1-2-3. Data were collected from all 28 NFL organizations. Because two teams use the same stadium, results were calculated for 27 facilities (n = 27). The number of stadium first aid rooms ranges from 1 to 7, with an average of 2.4 +/- 1.3 rooms per stadium (+/- 1 SD) and these vary in size from 120 to 2,000 square feet, with a mean of 434 +/- 377 square feet. Each room is equipped with an average of 3.3 +/- 2.9 stretchers (or tables), with telephones being present in 91% and sinks in 88% of all rooms. To provide contractual EMS coverage, stadiums use standard EMS system designs, including private (n = 19), fire department-based (n = 7), municipal (city/county) (n = 5), volunteer (n = 4), and hospital (n = 3). Nine stadiums employ more than one type of provider. All stadiums have a minimum of one ambulance dedicated on-site for spectators, with a range of 1 to 7, and a mean of 2.9 +/- 1.4. Golf carts are used for intrafacility patient transportation in 17 stadiums, with a range of 1 to 6, and a mean of 2.5 +/- 1.3. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) medications and equipment are present in all NFL stadiums and are provided by the private EMS company (n = 16), stadium (n = 10), fire EMS (n = 7), hospitals (n = 4), municipal EMS (n = 2), and the local NFL organization (n = 1). Several facilities have more than one provider of ACLS medications and equipment. The majority of stadiums dispense acetaminophen (n = 25) and aspirin (n = 24). Some dispense antacids (n = 7) and antihistamines (n = 6). The\n\nThe G. I.

The large numbers of individuals involved and their mobility, however, make generation of this information non-trivial. This paper proposes a novel methodology to estimate and map crowd sizes using mobile Bluetooth sensors and examines to what extent this methodology represents a valuable alternative to existing traditional crowd density estimation methods. The proposed methodology is applied in a unique case study that uses Bluetooth technology for the mobile mapping of spectators of the Tour of Flanders 2011 road cycling race. The locations of nearly 16,000 cell phones of spectators along the race course were registered and detailed views of the spatiotemporal distribution of the crowd were generated. Comparison with visual head counts from camera footage delivered a detection ratio of 13.0 Â± 2.3%, making it possible to estimate the crowd size.

This anomalous coupling gives an obvious contribution to unpolarized and polarized PDFs and also leads to a cos 2 Ïh azimuthal asymmetry proportional to the squared Pauli form factor, due to the helicity flip of the struck quark. After determining the model parameters by fitting PDFs to the global fits, this new distribution for cos 2 Ïh asymmetry is given numerically. In the framework of transverse momentum dependence (TMD), we find that it is positive and of a few percent in the kinematical regime of HERMES and COMPASS Collaborations, in the same order of magnitude as the Cahn effect.\n\nLeaving Mango Street: Speech, Action and the Construction of Narrative in Britton's Spectator Stance\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCrawford-Garrett, Katherine\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis paper attempts to unite \"The House on Mango Street\" by Sandra Cisneros with the participant and spectator theories of James Britton and D.

Such measurements could be performed at a future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) with suitable forward detectors. The measured proton recoil momentum (â² 100 MeV in the deuteron rest frame) specifies the deuteron configuration during the high-energy process and permits a controlled theoretical treatment of nuclear effects. Nuclear and nucleonic structure are separated using methods of light-front quantum mechanics. The impulse approximation (IA) to the tagged DIS cross sectionmoreÂ Â» contains the free neutron pole, which can be reached by on-shell extrapolation in the recoil momentum.

Comparing our results with those from experimental data at RHIC, we find that the Sivers functions of sea quarks play an important role in the determination of the shapes of ANWÂ±. It is shown that ANW- is sensitive to u sea Sivers function, while ANW+ to d sea Sivers function intuitively. The results show that the contributions of u and d sea Sivers functions are rather sizable and of the same sign, and their signs agree with that of d valence quarks and are opposite to that of u valence quarks.\n\nMeasurement of the structure function of the nearly free neutron using spectator tagging in inelastic 2H(e ,e'ps )X scattering with CLAS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTkachenko, S.; Baillie, N.; Kuhn, S.

Neutron information is usually extracted from data on nuclear targets such as deuterium, requiring corrections for nuclear binding and nucleon off-shell effects. These corrections are model dependent and have significant uncertainties, especially for large values of the Bjorken scaling variable x . As a consequence, the same data can lead to different conclusions, for example, about the behavior of the d quark distribution in the proton at large x . Purpose: The Barely Off-shell Nucleon Structure experiment at Jefferson Lab measured the inelastic electron-deuteron scattering cross section, tagging spectator protons in coincidence with the scattered electrons. This method reduces nuclear binding uncertainties significantly and has allowed for the first time a (nearly) model-independent extraction of the neutron structure function F2(x ,Q2) in the resonance and deep-inelastic regions. Method: A novel compact radial time projection chamber was built to detect protons with momentum between 70 and 150 MeV/c and over a nearly 4 Ï angular range. For the extraction of the free-neutron structure function F2n, spectator protons at backward angles (>100â relative to the momentum transfer) and with momenta below 100 MeV/c were selected, ensuring that the scattering took place on a nearly free neutron. The scattered electrons were detected with Jefferson Lab's CLAS spectrometer, with data taken at beam energies near 2, 4, and 5 GeV. Results: The extracted neutron structure function F2n and its ratio to the inclusive deuteron structure function F2d are presented in both the resonance and the deep-inelastic regions for momentum transfer squared Q2 between 0.7 and 5 GeV2/c2 , invariant mass W between 1 and 2.7 GeV/c2 , and Bjorken x between 0.25 and 0.6 (in the deep-inelastic scattering region).
