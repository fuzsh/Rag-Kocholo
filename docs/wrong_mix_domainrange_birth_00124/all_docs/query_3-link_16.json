        "text": "Medjugorje visionary Vicka Ivankovic-Mijatovic was seen and heard by 25 percent of the Christian population during her August 19-26 stay in The Holy Land, organizers of the first international Maranatha pilgrimage are estimating.\n\n“I am completely satisfied with the response. Having Vicka with us here fulfills my dream. Today, Medjugorje is present in every Christian family and community in The Holy Land. People are asking questions about how to connect to the Maranatha Movement for the healing of humanity. I do not have words to describe my feelings” Maranatha world coordinator Sabrina Covic-Radojicic tells the Croatian daily Vecernji List.\n\nVicka returned to Medjugorje on Monday, also very much pleased with the events of the week.\n\n“I am overjoyed. I have been in the Holy Land before, but I never could bring Our Lady’s message. I do not know why I could not, only God knows. Obviously it was time for people to hear. But, behold, the time has come. People have heard and will hear the message. But this should not stop here, prayer for the healing of people should continue. More than ever, humanity needs prayer” Vicka tells the Croatian paper.\n\nAnd devotion to prayer will continue, says Fr. Nadeem Shakouri, the pastor of Maelia where Vicka’s apparition was attended by about 13,000 people on August 21.\n\n“I am delighted. Only the Lord could muster this crowd. I thank Him for the gift of Vicka’s arrival. It gives us hope that peace is possible in these regions. He asks us to continue to pray not only during Vicka’s stay in the Holy Land, but also after her departure. Pray for all the sick hearts awaiting recovery, and for all who witnessed these precious days and who will themselves become carriers of the messages” Fr. Shakouri tells Vecernji List.\n\nThe priest was further uplifted by the message the Virgin Mary passed on from the apparition in Maelia.\n\n“Our Lady’s message today encourages us because she told the faithful of the Holy Land that she has been with us all the time with her Son, and that they never left. We believers from Galilee will never forget these days. In her honor we bless the statue which we brought from Medjugorje one month ago, that we will be constantly reminded of this day” says Fr. Shakouri.\n\nOn August 24, Fouad Boutros Ibrahim Twal, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, ”expressed his fraternal hospitality” and thanked for the devotion to recollection and prayer, and for the joy offered to all who met Vicka whom he welcomed to The Holy Land, Vecernji List further reports.\n\nBoth he and Elias Shakouri, the Bishop of the Melkite Catholic Church, were invited by Maranatha organizers to participate in the international Youth Festival in Medjugorje next year, Maranatha world coordinator Sabrina Covic-Radojicic informs.\n\n10,000 attended Bethlehem apparition\n\nAugust 25, 2013\n\n[Source: Medjugorje Today]\n\nMassive turnout of people witnessed visionary Vicka Ivankovic-Mijatovic’s public apparition in an auditorium in Bethlehem on August 25.

There were 5,000 seats and the scouts who were blocking the doors were overwhelmed with what seemed like double the amount arriving” Liam Driver, the leader of the British delegation with the Maranatha pilgrimage, tells Medjugorje Today.\n\nVicka with British delegation leader Liam Driver on Mt. Tabor. Photo: Rachel Adams\n\n“They said to me ‘Really, we did not expect so many people. We prepared 5000 seats and thought that would be enough. Now many more are coming we are finding it hard to block the doors’” says Liam Driver.\n\nThe crowd was enthusiastic and greeted Vicka by singing Ave Maria when she entered the stage before the apparition.”It was quite incredible. The apparitions were on big screens so everyone would see Vicka crash on her knees. Sometimes there would be a round of applause and people crying out in wonder because everyone witnessed it” Liam Driver tells.\n\n“There was a big giant curtain like Our Ladys mantle and when Our Lady went, the mantle fell gracefully down on the people beneath it. Everyone bursted into applause” he says.\n\nThe apparition in Bethlehem was the last public one during Vicka’s week-long stay with the first international Maranatha pilgrimage. She will return to Medjugorje on Monday.\n\nOn August 22, only the 550 pilgrimage participants were present at Vicka’s apparition in the biblical Garden of Gethsemane.\n\nIn between, Vicka’s apparition on August 23 took place in St. Anthony’s Church in Jaffa. The Franciscan Monastery of San Salvatore in Jerusalem lent ground to the apparition on August 24 which took place in private.\n\n“But Vicka told me that during the appariton on August 24, Our Lady blessed all of us and asked us to “pray for the heart of the Church, and for the entire Church” Brazilian delegation leader Gabriel Paulino tells Medjugorje Today.\n\nApparition unites Israeli believers\n\nAugust 21, 2013\n\n(Source: Medjugorje Today)\n\nAbout 13,000 Christians, Jews, and Muslims cried from joy together when visionary Vicka Ivankovic-Mijatovic had her apparition in Mealia, Israel, on August 21. Earlier, Vicka’s pilgrimage group had visited Biblical sites by the Sea of Galilee.

Organizers estimate 13,000 people were present.\n\n“It was the biggest man-made event in the history of Galilee. Never before have we had this gathering with Our Lady and this huge number of people” Charbel Maroun, the President of the Marian Movement of Lay People in Galilee, tells Medjugorje Today.\n\n“Lots of people were crying of joy, crying because of the grace the experienced. They listened to what they heard about Medjugorje, and loved it. Thousands of young people were there. And one of my co-workers told me about a huge number of confessions” he says.\n\nThe Lebanese tv station Tele Lumiere broadcast the event live from a forest in Mealia where differences were set aside for a day.\n\n“There were a lot of Muslims. They liked it so much, they started crying because they were so happy to be present. There were also many members of the Israeli army. Nevermind ethnicity or religious background, everybody was present and happy” Charbel Maroun reports.\n\n“You could feel the Holy Spirit in the entire area. The people of Galilee will never forget this meeting. The majority of people here are weak in devotion and spirituality, and so for many it was the first time they saw such a huge manifestation of prayer.”\n\nDuring Vicka’s apparition, the Virgin Mary asked the attendees to pray for the Church in Galilee.\n\n“Vicka was so, so happy, and so was Our Lady, to see so many people. She prayed over us, blessed us all, and told us to pray for the Church here” says Charbel Maroun.\n\nEarlier on August 21, Vicka and the 550 other participants in the first international Maranatha pilgrimage had visited Biblical sites by the Sea of Galilee.\n\nThe Mass in Mealia on August 21 was concelebrated by all three Bishops of Galilee, and more than 40 priests\n\nThe group saw the setting of Jesus’ sermon on the Beautitudes (Matthew 5: 1-12), the place where Jesus called Peter, Andrew, John and James to follow Him (Matthew 4: 18-22), and the setting of Jesus’ handing over the authority of the Church to Peter (John 21: 15-19).\n\nVicka’s apparition on Thursday will take place in the Garden of Gethsemane, only attended by the Maranatha pilgrims. Earlier during the day, she will meet the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem\n\nMary was joyful in return to Nazareth\n\nAugust 20, 2013\n\n(Source: Medjugorje Today)\n\n2,500 people were present on August 20 when the Virgin Mary appeared to visionary Vicka Ivankovic-Mijatovic in Nazareth’s Basilica of the Annunciation. “The time has come for people here to know” Vicka said after several Holy Land visits when her apparitions have been private.\n\nVicka had her apparition on August 20 in front of this statue of the Virgin Mary in the Basilica of the Annunciation, Nazareth.
