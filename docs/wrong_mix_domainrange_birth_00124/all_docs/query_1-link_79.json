        "text": "MONTE CARLO, Monaco -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov dropped the first set in an astonishing 13 minutes Wednesday and was ousted at the Monte Carlo Open by a player ranked 198th.\n\nIvan Ljubicic, a 20-year-old Croatian, won the second-round match 6-1, 6-2. He eliminated the world's No. 3 player in 38 minutes.\n\n''The result doesn't surprise me at all,'' said Kafelnikov, the Australian Open champion. ''Every year I go through this on clay. I have to live with it.''\n\nKafelnikov, who had a chance this week to overtake Carlos Moya and Pete Sampras for the No. 1 ranking, did not give his opponent much credit.\n\n''It was no match at all today,'' the second-seeded Russian said. ''He didn't do anything spectacular. All he had to do was hit the ball over the net and I missed, that was it.''\n\nLjubicic, who beat Andrei Medvedev in the first round, didn't quite see it that way.\n\n''He played badly, but I did everything to make him play badly,'' he said. ''He couldn't find a way out of it.''\n\nLjubicic was born and raised in Bosnia and moved to Croatia in 1992. He has put in long hours of practice at the Monte Carlo Country Club.\n\n''I went through qualifying and have practiced at this club for two years,'' he said. ''So I feel at home here.''\n\nMoya, the top seed from Spain, beat Dinu Pescariu of Romania 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.\n\nIn two upsets, the Czech Republic's Jiri Novak downed No. 8 seed Greg Rusedski of Britain 6-2, 6-2, and Spain's Francisco Clavet routed No. 12 Thomas Enqvist of Sweden 6-2, 6-0.\n\nRusedski blamed his defeat on a lack of practice and little proficiency on clay. And that does not bode well for the French Open.\n\n''I have about as much chance of winning Roland Garros as of seeing a UFO land today,'' he said. ''I really don't enjoy it. Anyone who bets on me to win Roland Garros should be shot.''\n\nAlso advancing were No. 5 seed Mark Philippoussis, No. 10 Albert Costa, No. 13 Gustavo Kuerten, No. 15 Felix Mantilla, Hicham Arazi and Jiri Novak.\n\nPhilippoussis topped Paraguay's Ramon Delgado 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 in a match delayed because of rain.\n\nDelgado, who beat Sampras in straight sets at the French Open last year, clawed to a 5-4 lead in the first set. But he couldn't capitalize on two set points and Philippoussis won the tiebreaker.\n\n''He let me off the hook and maybe lost a bit of concentration,'' the Australian said.\n\nIn the second set, Philippoussis broke in Delgado's opening service game.\n\n''It was very drizzly out there and very tough to put balls away as they were so heavy,'' Philippoussis said.\n\nKuerten, the No. 13 seed, struggled past the Czech Republic's Bohdan Ulihrach 6-7 (5-7), 6-2, 6-4.\n\n''I am getting into my rhythm and if I keep playing like this I think I can beat anyone here,'' said Kuerten, the 1997 French Open champ. ''Maybe I put too much pressure on myself after winning Roland Garros. I am more relaxed now.''\n\nArazi defeated Mariano Puerta of Argentina 6-1, 6-4. The Moroccan, who has reached the quarterfinals of the French Open the last two years, will play Marcelo Rios in the third round. Arazi beat the Chilean at Roland Garros in 1997.\n\nCosta of Spain defeated John van Lottum of the Netherlands 6-2, 6-3. Mantilla of Spain stopped Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador 7-5, 7-6 (7-4)."
