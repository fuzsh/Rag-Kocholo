        "text": "The players involved: Sergiy Stakhovsky and Ivan Ljubicic\n\nSergiy Stakhovsky, Ukrainian outsider\n\nSergiy Stakhovsky, from Ukraine, was born in 1986. He turned pro in 2003, but so far, he hadn’t managed to break into the top 100. He had never entered the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, and his best ATP result had been reaching the quarter-finals in Milan, in 2005. In February 2008, he was world No 209, not far from his best ranking, No 176, reached in 2007.\n\nIvan Ljubicic, big-serving Croatian\n\nIvan Ljubicic, from Croatia, was born in 1979. Relying mainly on a deadly serve, he broke into the top 100 in 1999, and he claimed his first title in 2001, in Lyon, after he beat Younes El Aynaoui in the final (6-3, 6-2). He remained a top 50 player until 2004, when he climbed in the top 25 after he had twice reached the semi-finals of a Masters 1000 event, but 2005 was his breakthrough year.\n\nLjubicic reached the finals in four of his first six tournament, and during the indoor season, he claimed two consecutive titles in Metz (defeating Gaël Monfils, 7-6, 6-0) and Vienna (where he beat Juan Carlos Ferrero, 6-2, 6-4, 7-6), before reaching the final at the Madrid Masters 1000, defeated by Rafael Nadal despite a two-set lead (3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6) as well as in Paris Bercy (lost to Tomas Berdych). Later in 2005, Ivan Ljubicic led Croatia to win the Davis Cup for the first time, defeating Slovakia in the final (3-2). He climbed as high as world No 3, in 2006.\n\nThat year, he reached the quarter-finals at the Australian Open and the semi-finals at Roland-Garros, where he was defeated by Rafael Nadal (6-4, 6-2, 7-6). He began 2007 with an important title claimed in Doha at the expense of Andy Murray (6-4, 6-4), but his season was disappointing and at the end of the year, he was world No 18.\n\nThe place: Zagreb Indoor Open\n\nThe Zagreb Indoor Open was held for the first time in 1996, won by the local star Goran Ivanisevic, but it wasn’t held between 1998 and 2005. The event was back on the ATP schedule in 2006, and it was won by another local favourite, Ivan Ljubicic, who also reached the final in 2007 (defeated by Marcos Baghdatis). It was held on a fast indoor surface, which favoured big servers and aggressive players in general.\n\nThe facts: Stakhovsky takes the title\n\nWhen Stakhovsky, world No 209, came to compete in the qualifiers of the PBZ Zagreb Indoors, no one would have put any money on him winning the tournament. Furthermore, the Ukrainian was defeated by Blaz Kavcic (world No 396) in the last round of qualification. However, thanks to Michael Llodra’s last-minute withdrawal (the Frenchman had triumphed in Rotterdam the week before and needed recovery), Stakhovsky entered the main draw as a “lucky loser”.\n\nIn the first round, he beat the second seed, the Croatian giant Ivo Karlovic (4-6, 7-6, 6-2). In the second round, he eliminated Viktor Troicki (7-6, 3-6, 6-4), before beating Janko Tipsarevic (3-6, 6-4, 6-2) and Simone Bolleli (6-4, 6-4) to make his way into the final.\n\nOn the last day, the Ukrainian faced the local favourite and top seed Ivan Ljubicic, world No 25 and a former top 5 player. Stakhovsky was far from being the favourite on paper, but facing the Croatian in front of his home crowd in Zagreb was even a bigger challenge. However, the 22-year-old “lucky loser” rose to the occasion and finally prevailed (7-5, 6-4). He was the first lucky loser to claim an ATP title since Christian Miniussi, from Argentina, in 1991, in São Paulo.\n\n“It’s hard to say anything, it’s like a dream…The entire week has been amazing and I hope I will have more successes like this in future,” he said.\n\n“Stakhovsky played great, I tried everything, but he just didn’t give me any chances. I had only one chance for a break in the entire match, but failed to grab it,” Ljubicic explained.\n\nWhat next: Stakhovsky, Ljubicic enjoy memorable highs\n\nThanks to this win, Stakhovsky would be propelled to world No 123, and he would soon break into the top 100. He would add three other titles to his list of achievements, but his most memorable moment would happen in the Wimbledon second round, in 2013, when, to general astonishment, he would defeat Roger Federer (6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 7-6).\n\nStakhovsky would climb as high as world No 31, in 2010. He retired at the start of 2022, after defeat in Australian Open qualifying, and was in the news shortly afterwards as he announced his intention to join the Ukrainian territorial army and defend the country."
