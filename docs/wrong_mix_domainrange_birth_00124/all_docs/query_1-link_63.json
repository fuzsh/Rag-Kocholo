        "text": "Ivan Ljubicic has been appointed by the French Tennis Federation as director of the “Ambition 2024” program to help improve French tennis.\n\nThe former coach will be responsible for supervising and improving the quality of the over 14 national players.\n\nLjubicic will work closely with Nicolas Escude, Paul Henri Mathieu and Pauline Parmentier in the new role, which starts on 15 January 2023.\n\nLjubicic will start a three-month trip to France to assess the situation of French tennis.\n\nThe main goal of the “Ambition 2024” Programme has been created to ensure that French tennis produces better player in larger numbers ahead of the Olympic Games in Paris 2024. Only this year’s WTA Finals champion Caroline Garcia features in the top 30 in the ATP and WTA Tour Rankings. The top male player in French tennis is Arthur Rinderknech, who is ranked world number 44. The few emerging stars are Luca Van Assche, who was the first player born in 2004 to win the Challenger title in Maia and joined the top 150 in the ATP Ranking, Arthur Fils, who played in the main draw of the Masters 1000 tournament in Paris Bercy but lost to Fabio Fognini in three sets, and Gabriel Debru, who won the Roland Garros Junior title.\n\nIvan Ljubicic: “I am very happy to join the French Tennis Federation, one of the federations in the world that devotes the resources to developing the potential of young people. France has a very rich, very promising breeding ground, and I put my experience at the service of this new challenge with total commitment and a strong desire to share the values that forge champions”.\n\nFrench tennis President Gilles Moretton believes that young French tennis players will benefit from Ljubicic’s winning mentality.\n\nGilles Moretton: “His approach to tennis, focused on performance, at all times, and down to the smallest detail, is driven by this culture of winning that we want to instil in our French hopefuls. All this without ever turning away from the essential human values that the Federation shares.\n\nAlex de Minaur says it is a ‘dream come true’ for him to represent Australia in the Olympic Games after missing the event three years ago.\n\nThe world No.6 had been in a race against time to be fit for the Olympic tennis event after suffering an agonising injury setback at Wimbledon earlier this month. At the All England Club de Minaur reached the quarter-final stage for the first time and was set to take on Novak Djokovic. However, he was forced to withdraw from the match after tearing the fibre cartilage in his hip region after suffering a ‘freak’ injury. At the time of the announcement, it was estimated that he would be sidelined from the Tour for three to six weeks.\n\nHowever, the 25-year-old appears to have recovered fairly quickly in time for Paris with the tennis tournament starting on Saturday. It will be de Minaur’s debut in the Olympics after he was forced to pull out of the Tokyo Games due to a positive COVID-19 test.\n\n“To finally be able to represent Australia in the Olympics is a dream come true,” he wrote on Instagram on Tuesday morning.\n\n“I’m very passionate when I play for my country and wear the green and gold, so this is another one of those moments.\n\n“I’m extremely excited to lace up for Paris 2024.”\n\nDe Minaur is bidding to become the first male player from his country to win an Olympic medal in the singles event. He has already won two ATP titles this year in Alcapulco and s-Hertogenbosch. Since the start of January, he has won five out of 11 meetings against top 10 players.\n\n“It’s really great news – we’re actually expecting Alex to arrive in the village ahead of the official draw (on Thursday) and we know he’s been working with his rehab team quite extensively since the conclusion of Wimbledon,” Australian chef de mission Anna Meares told the Australian Associated Press (AAP).\n\n“He’s hungry to be here, he wants to be a part of this team and we will offer as much support as we can in that process.\n\n“He’s coming – we will wait to see that process. He still has time … injury can be a really stressful thing for an athlete and the more you rush it, the more problems you can potentially cause.\n\n“We’re leaving it in the hands of Alex and his rehabilitation team … it will be a decision purely by them.”\n\nDe Minaur is one of five Australian men playing in the Paris Olympics. The others are Alexei Popyrin, Matthew Ebden, John Peers and Rinky Hijikata.\n\nHolger Rune will have a second medical opinion on Monday before deciding if he is fit enough to play at the Olympic Games, according to his team.\n\nThe Danish world No.17 recently retired from his quarter-final match at the Hamburg Open due to a knee injury. The hope at the time was that his withdrawal would be just a precautionary measure ahead of the Olympics. However, he is also dealing with a second issue that appears to be more serious.\n\nAccording to TV 2 Sport, Rune has been struggling with a wrist issue and underwent a scan on Sunday which his mother Aneke says ‘doesn’t look promising.’ Aneke is also the manager of her son’s career. Rune’s Olympic dreams now rest on the outcome of a second medical expert that he will visit tomorrow who has a better understanding of the sport.\n\n“Unfortunately, it does not look promising after the first medical opinion after the review of the scan of the wrist,” Aneke Rune told TV 2 Sport.\n\n“We are waiting for two tennis-specific doctors who will give a second opinion tomorrow (Monday). Tennis wrists look different from regular wrists, so we’ll hold out hope for one more day.”\n\nRune is one of three Danish players entered into the Olympic tennis event along with Caroline Wozniacki and Clara Tauson. The country has only won one medal in tennis before which was at the 1912 Games when Sofie Castenschiold won silver in the women’s indoor singles event.\n\nSo far this season, the 21-year-old has won 27 matches on the Tour but is yet to claim a title. He reached the final of the Brisbane International and then the semi-finals of three more events. In the Grand Slams, he made it to the fourth round of the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nIt is not known when a final decision regarding Rune’s participation in Paris will be made.\n\nPoland’s top player on the ATP Tour is not giving up on his dream of winning a medal at the Olympic Games despite recently undergoing a medical procedure.\n\nWorld No.7 Hubert Hurkacz suffered a knee injury during his second round clash at Wimbledon against France’s Arthur Fils. In the fourth set tiebreak of their clash, Hurkacz dived for a shot but landed badly on his knee and required on-court medical attention. He then played two more points before retiring from the match.\n\nIn a social media post published on Wednesday, the 27-year-old confirmed he underwent a procedure on his knee earlier this week but didn’t provide any further details. Although Hurkacz has stated his intention to play at the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris, where the tennis event will be held on the clay at Roland Garros.\n\n“I had a knee procedure this Monday, but I’m feeling better already and my team and are dedicating extensive time each day to the rehab process.” He wrote on Instagram.\n\n“It’s a dream for every athlete to represent their country at the Olympics, and I want to make sure I am fully fit and ready before making the final decision to step on court. The aim is not only to participate, but to win a medal for my country.”\n\nSo far this season Hurkacz has won 34 out of 48 matches played on the Tour. He won the Estoril Open in April and was runner-up to Jannik Sinner in Halle.\n\nThe Olympic tennis event is scheduled to begin a week Saturday on July 27th. Poland is yet to win a medal in the event but expectations are high with women’s No.1 Iga Swiatek also taking part."
