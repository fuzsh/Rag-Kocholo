I think I reached a high level in tennis thanks to the hardships I went through.”\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s war in Bosnia, he had to leave Banja Luka, from where he came to Croatia as a refugee with his mother Hazira and brother Vlado in 1992.\n\nAfter that, Ljubicic moved to Italy, where he began his tennis career, during which he won 10 tournaments and was third in the world in 2006.\n\nHe later coached Federer, who also appeared in a documentary film about Ivan Ljubicic, N1 writes."
