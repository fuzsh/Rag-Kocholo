BENTON, Curtis (1885-1938).

This silent film actor turned screenwriter in the 1920s, and his credits include W.S. Van Dyke's "Half-a-Dollar Bill" (1924) and Hoot Gibson's "The Phantom Bullet" (1926). Bold and nice "Stay away from all the / 'Eves' --.-- they are full / of apple-sauce / Curtis Benton / K.N.X." on a beige 6" X 3 3/4" autograph album leaf, n.p., n.y. Though place and date not indicated, this was obtained by noted collector Preston Sawyer (1899-1968), California journalist and historical writer, in San Francisco around 1930. Benton went into radio announcing after talkies took over from silent films, so "K.N.X." is likely a radio station reference. Item #25825
