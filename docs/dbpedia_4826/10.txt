The half dollar is one of the most popular U.S. coins to collect. Many aren’t worth more than their face value — though older half dollars often hold value due to the silver in their composition — and the value of any coin is subject to its rarity, condition and demand, per CNBC Make It. However, some of the most valuable 50-cent pieces sell to coin collectors for thousands or even millions of dollars. Before you spend your coins, look out for some of these valuable half-dollars worth up to $1.5 million.

Even the coin’s melt value is worth something — approximately $9.75.
