Unless otherwise provided in this act, any right in a trust accrues in accordance with the law in effect on the date of the creation of a trust and a substantive right in the decedent's estate accrues in accordance with the law in effect on the date of the decedent's death.\n\n\"(C) If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before the effective date of the act, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.\"\n\nPart 1\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\nSECTION 62-3-101. Devolution of estate at death; restrictions.\n\nThe power of a person to leave property by will and the rights of creditors, devisees, and heirs to his property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in this Code to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates, including the exercise of the powers of the personal representative. Upon the death of a person, his real property devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his last will or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving lapse, renunciation, or other circumstances affecting the devolution of testate estates, or in the absence of testamentary disposition, to his heirs, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of intestate estates, subject to the purpose of satisfying claims as to exempt property rights and the rights of creditors, and the purposes of administration, particularly the exercise of the powers of the personal representative under Sections 62-3-709, 62-3-710, and 62-3-711, and his personal property devolves, first, to his personal representative, for the purpose of satisfying claims as to exempt property rights and the rights of creditors, and the purposes of administration, particularly the exercise of the powers of the personal representative under Sections 62-3-709, 62-3-710, and 62-3-711, and, at the expiration of three years after the decedent's death, if not yet distributed by the personal representative, his personal property devolves to those persons to whom it is devised by will or who are his heirs in intestacy, or their substitutes, as the case may be, just as with respect to real property.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 16; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-102. Necessity of order of probate for will.\n\nExcept as provided in Section 62-3-1201 and except as to a will that has been admitted to probate in another jurisdiction which is filed as provided in Article 4, to be effective to prove the transfer of any property or to nominate a personal representative, a will must be declared to be valid by an order of informal probate by the court or an adjudication of probate by the court.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment inserted \"and except as to a will that has been admitted to probate in another jurisdiction which is filed as provided in Article 4\", and substituted \"nominate a personal representative\" for \"nominate an executor\".\n\nSECTION 62-3-103. Necessity of appointment for administration.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this article [Sections 62-3-101 et seq.] and in Article 4 [Sections 62-4-101 et seq.], to acquire the powers and undertake the duties and liabilities of a personal representative of a decedent, a person must be appointed by order of the court, qualify, and be issued letters. Administration of an estate is commenced by the issuance of letters.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-104. Claims against decedent; necessity of administration.\n\nNo claim may be filed against the estate of a decedent and no proceeding to enforce a claim against the estate of a decedent or his successors may be revived or commenced before the appointment of a personal representative, except as provided in Section 62-3-804(1)(b). After the appointment and until distribution, all proceedings and actions to enforce a claim against the estate are governed by the procedure prescribed by this article [Sections 62-3-101 et seq.]. After distribution, a creditor whose claim has not been barred may recover from the distributees as provided in Section 62-3-1004 or from a former personal representative individually liable as provided in Section 62-3-1005. This section has no application to a proceeding by a secured creditor of the decedent to enforce his right to his security except as to any deficiency judgment which might be sought therein.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-105.

Proceedings within the jurisdiction of court; service; jurisdiction over persons.\n\nIn proceedings within the jurisdiction of the court where notice is required by this Code or by rule, and in proceedings to construe probated wills or determine heirs which concern estates that have not been and cannot now be opened for administration, interested persons may be bound by the orders of the court in respect to property in or subject to the laws of this State by notice in conformity with Section 62-1-401. An order is binding as to all who are given notice of the proceeding though less than all interested persons are notified.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 30; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-107. Scope of proceedings; proceedings independent; exception.\n\nUnless administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] is involved, (1) each proceeding before the court is independent of any other proceeding involving the same estate; (2) petitions for formal orders of the court may combine various requests for relief in a single proceeding if the orders sought may be finally granted without delay, but, except as required for proceedings which are particularly described by other sections of this article [Sections 62-3-101 et seq.], no petition is defective because it fails to embrace all matters which might then be the subject of a final order; (3) proceedings for probate of wills or adjudications of no will may be combined with proceedings for appointment of personal representatives; and (4) a proceeding for appointment of a personal representative is concluded by an order making or declining the appointment.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-108. Probate, testacy, and appointment proceedings; ultimate time limit.\n\n(A)(1) No informal probate or appointment proceeding or formal testacy or appointment proceeding, other than a proceeding to probate a will previously probated at the testator's domicile and appointment proceedings relating to an estate in which there has been a prior appointment, may be commenced more than ten years after the decedent's death.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section:\n\n(a) if a previous proceeding was dismissed because of doubt about the fact of the decedent's death, appropriate probate, appointment, or testacy proceedings may be maintained at any time upon a finding that the decedent's death occurred prior to the initiation of the previous proceeding and the applicant or petitioner has not delayed unduly in initiating the subsequent proceeding and if that previous proceeding was commenced within the time limits of this section;\n\n(b) appropriate probate, appointment, or testacy proceedings may be maintained in relation to the estate of an absent, disappeared, or missing person for whose estate a conservator has been appointed, at any time within three years after the conservator becomes able to establish the death of the protected person; and\n\n(c) a proceeding to contest an informally probated will and to secure appointment of the person with legal priority for appointment in the event the contest is successful may be commenced within eight months from informal probate or one year from the decedent's death, whichever is later.\n\n(B) If no informal probate and no formal testacy proceedings are commenced within ten years after the decedent's death, and no proceedings under subsection (A)(2)(b) are commenced within the applicable period of three years, it is incontestable that the decedent left no will and that the decedent's estate passes by intestate succession. These limitations do not apply to proceedings to construe probated wills or determine heirs of an intestate. In proceedings commenced under subsection (A)(2)(a) or (A)(2)(b), the date on which a testacy or appointment proceeding is properly commenced is deemed to be the date of the decedent's death for purposes of other limitations provisions of this Code which relate to the date of death.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 17; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 31; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment rewrote the section.\n\nSECTION 62-3-109. Statute of limitations on decedent's cause of action.\n\nThe running of any statute of limitations on a cause of action belonging to a decedent which had not been barred as of the date of his death is suspended during the eight months following the decedent's death but resumes thereafter unless otherwise tolled.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 32; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nPart 2\n\nVenue for Probate and Administration; Priority to Administer; Demand for Notice\n\nSECTION 62-3-201. Venue for first and subsequent estate proceedings; location of property.\n\n(a) Venue for the first informal or formal testacy or appointment proceedings after a decedent's death is:\n\n(1) in the county where the decedent had his domicile at the time of his death; or\n\n(2) if the decedent was not domiciled in this State, in any county where property of the decedent was located at the time of his death.\n\n(b) Venue for all subsequent proceedings within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court is in the place where the initial proceeding occurred, unless the initial proceeding has been transferred as provided in Section 62-1-303 or (c) of this section.\n\n(c) If the first proceeding was informal, on application of an interested person and after notice to the proponent in the first proceeding, the court, upon finding that venue is elsewhere, may transfer the proceeding and the file to the other court.\n\n(d) For the purpose of aiding determinations concerning location of assets which may be relevant in cases involving nondomiciliaries, a debt, other than one evidenced by investment or commercial paper or other instrument in favor of a nondomiciliary, is located where the debtor resides or, if the debtor is a person other than an individual, at the place where it has its principal office. Commercial paper, investment paper, and other instruments are located where the instrument is. An interest in property held in trust is located where the trustee may be sued.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-202. Appointment or testacy proceedings; conflicting claim of domicile in another state.\n\nIf conflicting claims as to the domicile of a decedent are made in a formal testacy or appointment proceeding commenced in this State, and in a testacy or appointment proceeding after notice pending at the same time in another state, the court of this State must stay, dismiss, or permit suitable amendment in, the proceeding here unless it is determined that the local proceeding was commenced before the proceeding elsewhere. The determination of domicile in the proceeding first commenced must be accepted as determinative in the proceeding in this State.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-203. Priority among persons seeking appointment as personal representative.\n\n(a) Whether the proceedings are formal or informal, persons who are not disqualified have priority for appointment in the following order:\n\n(1) the person with priority as determined by a probated will including a person nominated by a power conferred in a will;\n\n(2) the surviving spouse of the decedent who is a devisee of the decedent;\n\n(3) other devisees of the decedent;\n\n(4) the surviving spouse of the decedent;\n\n(5) other heirs of the decedent regardless of whether the decedent died intestate and determined as if the decedent died intestate (for the purposes of determining priority under this item, any heirs who could have qualified under items (1), (2), (3), and (4) of subsection (a) are treated as having predeceased the decedent);\n\n(6) forty-five days after the death of the decedent, any creditor complying with the requirements of Section 62-3-804(1)(b);\n\n(7) four months after the death of the decedent, upon application by the South Carolina Department of Revenue, a person suitable to the court.\n\n(8) Unless a contrary intent is expressed in the decedent's will, a person with priority under subsection (a) may nominate another, who shall have the same priority as the person making the nomination, except that a person nominated by the testator to serve as personal representative or successor personal representative shall have a higher priority than a person nominated pursuant to this item.\n\n(b) An objection to an appointment can be made only in formal proceedings. In case of objection the priorities stated in (a) apply except that:\n\n(1) if the estate appears to be more than adequate to meet exemptions and costs of administration but inadequate to discharge anticipated unsecured claims, the court, on petition of creditors, may appoint any qualified person;\n\n(2) in case of objection to appointment of a person other than one whose priority is determined by will by an heir or devisee appearing to have a substantial interest in the estate, the court may appoint a person who is acceptable to heirs and devisees whose interests in the estate appear to be worth in total more than half of the probable distributable value or, in default of this accord, any suitable person.\n\n(c) Conservators of the estates of protected persons or, if there is no conservator, any guardian for the protected person or the custodial parent of a minor, except a court-appointed guardian ad litem of a minor or incapacitated person may exercise the same right to be appointed as personal representative, to object to another's appointment, or to participate in determining the preference of a majority in interest of the heirs and devisees that the protected person or ward would have if qualified for appointment.\n\n(d) If the administration is necessary, appointment of one who has equal or lower priority may be made as follows within the discretion of the court:\n\n(1) informally if all those of equal or higher priority have filed a writing with the court renouncing the right to serve and nominating the same person in his place; or\n\n(2) in the absence of agreement, informally in accordance with the requirements of Section 62-3-310; or\n\n(3) in formal proceedings.\n\n(e) No person is qualified to serve as a personal representative who is:\n\n(1) under the age of eighteen;\n\n(2) a person whom the court finds unsuitable in formal proceedings;\n\n(3) with respect to the estate of any person domiciled in this State at the time of his death, a corporation created by another state of the United States or by any foreign state, kingdom or government, or a corporation created under the laws of the United States and not having a business in this State, or an officer, employee, or agent of such foreign corporation, whether the officer, employee, or agent is a resident or a nonresident of this State, if such officer, employee, or agent is acting as personal representative on behalf of such corporation;\n\n(4) a probate judge for an estate of any person within his jurisdiction; however, a probate judge may serve as a personal representative of the estate of a family member if the service does not interfere with the proper performance of the probate judge's official duties and the estate must be transferred to another county for administration. For purposes of this subsection, \"family member\" means a spouse, parent, child, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparent, or grandchild.\n\n(f) A personal representative appointed by a court of the decedent's domicile has priority over all other persons except where the decedent's will nominates different persons to be personal representatives in this State and in the state of domicile. The domiciliary personal representative may nominate another, who shall have the same priority as the domiciliary personal representative.\n\n(g) This section governs priority for appointment of a successor personal representative but does not apply to the selection of a special administrator.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 18; 1990 Act No. 521, Sections 33, 34; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1606; 1995 Act No. 15, Section 3; 1997 Act No. 152, Sections 11, 12; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 7, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-204. Demand for notice of order or filing concerning decedent's estate.\n\nAny interested person desiring notice of any order or filing pertaining to a decedent's estate may file a demand for notice with the court at any time after the death of the decedent stating the name of the decedent, the nature of his interest in the estate, and the demandant's address or that of his attorney. The demand for notice shall expire one year from the date of filing with the court. The clerk shall mail a copy of the demand to the personal representative if one has been appointed. After filing of a demand, the personal representative must give a copy of the demanded filing to the demandant or his attorney. If the demand is a demand for a hearing, then the personal representative must comply with Section 62-1-401. The validity of an order which is issued or filing which is accepted without compliance with this requirement is not affected by the error, but the petitioner receiving the order or the person making the filing may be liable for any damage caused by the absence of notice. The requirement of notice arising from a demand under this provision may be waived in writing by the demandant and ceases upon the termination of his interest in the estate.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 19; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nPart 3\n\nInformal Probate and Appointment Proceedings\n\nSECTION 62-3-301. Applications for informal probate or appointment; contents.\n\n(a) Applications for informal probate or informal appointment shall be directed to the court, and verified by the applicant to be accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief as to the following information:\n\n(1) Every application for informal probate of a will or for informal appointment of a personal representative, other than a special or successor representative, shall contain the following:\n\n(i) a statement of the interest of the applicant;\n\n(ii) the name, and date of death of the decedent, his age, and the county and state of his domicile at the time of death, and the names and addresses of the spouse, children, heirs (regardless of whether the decedent died intestate and determined as if the decedent died intestate) and devisees, and the ages of any who are minors so far as known or ascertainable with reasonable diligence by the applicant;\n\n(iii) if the decedent was not domiciled in the State at the time of his death, a statement showing venue;\n\n(iv) a statement identifying and indicating the address of any personal representative of the decedent appointed in this State or elsewhere whose appointment has not been terminated;\n\n(v) a statement indicating whether the applicant has received a demand for notice, or is aware of a demand for notice of any probate or appointment proceeding concerning the decedent that may have been filed in this State or elsewhere; and\n\n(vi) that the time limit for informal probate or appointment as provided in this article has not expired either because ten years or less has passed since the decedent's death, or, if more than ten years from death have passed, circumstances as described by Section 62-3-108 authorizing tardy probate or appointment have occurred.\n\n(2) An application for informal probate of a will shall state the following in addition to the statements required by (1):\n\n(i) that the original of the decedent's last will is in the possession of the court, or accompanies the application, or that an authenticated copy of a will probated in another jurisdiction accompanies the application;\n\n(ii) that the applicant, to the best of his knowledge, believes the will to have been validly executed;\n\n(iii) that after the exercise of reasonable diligence, the applicant is unaware of any instrument revoking the will, and that the applicant believes that the instrument which is the subject of the application is the decedent's last will.\n\n(3) An application for informal appointment of a personal representative to administer an estate under a will shall describe the will by date of execution and state the time and place of probate or the pending application or petition for probate. The application for appointment shall adopt the statements in the application or petition for probate and state the name, address, and priority for appointment of the person whose appointment is sought.\n\n(4) An application for informal appointment of an administrator in intestacy must state the name and address of the person whose appointment is sought and must state in addition to the statements required by item (1):\n\n(i) that after the exercise of reasonable diligence, the applicant is unaware of any unrevoked testamentary instrument relating to property having a situs in this State under Section 62-1-301 or a statement why any such instrument of which he may be aware is not being probated;\n\n(ii) the priority of the person whose appointment is sought and the names of any other persons having a prior or equal right to the appointment under Section 62-3-203.\n\n(5) An application for appointment of a personal representative to succeed a personal representative appointed under a different testacy status shall refer to the order in the most recent testacy proceeding, state the name and address of the person whose appointment is sought and of the person whose appointment will be terminated if the application is granted, and describe the priority of the applicant.\n\n(6) An application for appointment of a personal representative to succeed a personal representative who has tendered a resignation as provided in Section 62-3-610, or whose appointment has been terminated by death or removal, shall adopt the statements in the application or petition which led to the appointment of the person being succeeded except as specifically changed or corrected, state the name and address of the person who seeks appointment as successor, and describe the priority of the applicant.\n\n(7) The court may probate a will without appointing a personal representative.\n\n(b) By verifying an application for informal probate, or informal appointment, the applicant submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding for relief from fraud relating to the application, or for perjury, that may be instituted against him.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 20; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 35; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1607; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment deleted former subsection (a)(1)(vii), relating to further information, and added subsection (c)(7), relating to probate of a will without appointing a personal representative.\n\nSECTION 62-3-302. Informal probate; duty of court; effect of informal probate.\n\nUpon receipt of an application requesting informal probate of a will, the court, upon making the findings required by Section 62-3-303, shall issue a written statement of informal probate. Informal probate is conclusive as to all persons until superseded by an order in a formal testacy proceeding. No defect in the application or procedure relating thereto which leads to informal probate of a will renders the probate void.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 36; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-303. Informal probate; proof and findings required.\n\n(a) In an informal proceeding for original probate of a will, the court shall determine whether:\n\n(1) the application is complete;\n\n(2) the applicant has made oath or affirmation that the statements contained in the application are true to the best of his knowledge and belief;\n\n(3) the applicant appears from the application to be an interested person as defined in Section 62-1-201;\n\n(4) on the basis of the statements in the application, venue is proper;\n\n(5) an original, duly executed and apparently unrevoked will is in the court's possession;\n\n(6) any notice required by Section 62-3-204 has been given and that the application is not within Section 62-3-304;\n\n(7) it appears from the application that the time limit for original probate has not expired.\n\n(b) The application shall be denied if it indicates that a personal representative has been appointed in another county of this State or except as provided in subsection (d) below, if it appears that this or another will of the decedent has been the subject of a previous probate order.\n\n(c) A will which appears to have the required signatures and which contains an attestation clause showing that requirements of execution under Section 62-2-502 or 62-2-505 have been met shall be probated without further proof. In other cases, the court may assume execution if the will appears to have been properly executed, or he may accept a sworn statement or affidavit of any person having knowledge of the circumstances of execution, whether or not the person was a witness to the will.\n\n(d) Informal probate of a will which has been previously probated elsewhere may be granted at any time upon written application by any interested person, together with deposit of an authenticated copy of the will and of the statement probating it from the office or court where it was first probated.\n\n(e) A will of a nonresident decedent which has not been probated and is not eligible for probate under subsection (a)(5) may nevertheless be probated in this State upon receipt by the court of a copy of the will authenticated as true by its legal custodian together with the legal custodian's certificate that the will is not ineligible for probate under the law of the other place.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment rewrote subsection (e).\n\nSECTION 62-3-304. Informal probate unavailable in certain cases.\n\nApplications for informal probate which relate to one or more of a known series of testamentary instruments (other than a will and its codicils), the latest of which does not expressly revoke the earlier, shall be declined.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-305. Informal probate; court not satisfied.\n\nIf the court is not satisfied that a will is entitled to be probated in informal proceedings because of failure to meet the requirements of Sections 62-3-303 and 62-3-304 or any other reason, he may decline the application. A declination of informal probate is not an adjudication and does not preclude formal probate proceedings.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-306. Notice requirements.\n\n(a) The moving party must give notice as described by Section 62-1-401 of his application for informal probate to any person demanding it pursuant to Section 62-3-204, and to any personal representative of the decedent whose appointment has not been terminated. No other notice of informal probate is required.\n\n(b) If an informal probate is granted, within thirty days thereafter the applicant shall give written information of the probate to the heirs (determined as if the decedent died intestate) and devisees. The information must include the name and address of the applicant, the date of execution of the will, and any codicil thereto, the name and location of the court granting the informal probate, and the date of the probate. The information must be delivered or sent by ordinary mail to each of the heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the applicant. No duty to give information is incurred if a personal representative is appointed who is required to give the written information required by Section 62-3-705. An applicant's failure to give information as required by this section is a breach of his duty to the heirs and devisees but does not affect the validity of the probate.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 37; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-307. Informal appointment proceedings; delay in order; duty of court; effect of appointment.\n\n(a) Upon receipt of an application for informal appointment of a personal representative other than a special administrator as provided in Section 62-3-614, the court, after making the findings required by Section 62-3-308, shall appoint the applicant subject to qualification and acceptance; provided, that if the decedent was a nonresident, the court shall delay the order of appointment until thirty days have elapsed since death unless the personal representative appointed at the decedent's domicile is the applicant, or unless the decedent's will directs that his estate be subject to the laws of this State.\n\n(b) The status of a personal representative and the powers and duties pertaining to the office are fully established by informal appointment. An appointment, and the office of personal representative created thereby, is subject to termination as provided in Sections 62-3-608 through 62-3-612, but is not subject to retroactive vacation.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 38; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-308. Informal appointment proceedings; proof and findings required.\n\n(a) In informal appointment proceedings, the court must determine whether:\n\n(1) the application for informal appointment of a personal representative is complete;\n\n(2) the applicant has made oath or affirmation that the statements contained in the application are true to the best of his knowledge and belief;\n\n(3) the applicant appears from the application to be an interested person as defined in Section 62-1-201;\n\n(4) on the basis of the statements in the application, venue is proper;\n\n(5) any will to which the requested appointment relates has been formally or informally probated; but this requirement does not apply to the appointment of a special administrator;\n\n(6) any notice required by Section 62-3-204 has been given;\n\n(7) from the statements in the application, the person whose appointment is sought has priority entitling him to the appointment.\n\n(b) Unless Section 62-3-612 controls, the application must be denied if it indicates that a personal representative who has not filed a written statement of resignation as provided in Section 62-3-610 has been appointed in this or another county of this State, that (unless the applicant is the domiciliary personal representative or his nominee) the decedent was not domiciled in this State and that a personal representative whose appointment has not been terminated has been appointed by a court in the state of domicile, or that other requirements of this section have not been met.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment substituted \"Section 62-1-201\" for \"Section 62-1-201(20)\" in subsection (a)(3).\n\nSECTION 62-3-309. Informal appointment proceedings; court not satisfied.\n\nIf the court is not satisfied that a requested informal appointment of a personal representative should be made because of failure to meet the requirements of Sections 62-3-307 and 62-3-308 or, for any other reason, he may decline the application.

The notice shall state that, if no objection or nomination of another or no competing application or petition for appointment is filed with the court within thirty days from mailing of the application and notice, the applicant may be appointed informally as the personal representative. If an objection, nomination, application, or petition is filed within the thirty day period, the court shall decline the initial application pursuant to Section 62-3-309. The court may require a formal proceeding to appoint someone of equal or lesser priority.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment rewrote the section.\n\nSECTION 62-3-311. Informal appointment unavailable in certain cases.\n\nIf an application for informal appointment indicates the existence of a possible unrevoked testamentary instrument which may relate to property subject to the laws of this State, and which is not filed for probate in this court, the court shall decline the application.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nPart 4\n\nFormal Testacy and Appointment Proceedings\n\nSECTION 62-3-401. Formal testacy proceedings; nature; when commenced.\n\nA formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid will. A formal testacy proceeding must be commenced by an interested person filing and serving a summons and a petition as described in Section 62-3-402(a) in which he requests that the court, after notice and hearing, enter an order probating a will, or a petition to set aside an informal probate of a will or to prevent informal probate of a will which is the subject of a pending application, or a petition in accordance with Section 62-3-402(b) for an order that the decedent died intestate.\n\nA petition may seek formal probate of a will without regard to whether the same or a conflicting will has been informally probated. A formal testacy proceeding may, but need not, involve a request for appointment of a personal representative.\n\nDuring the pendency of a formal testacy proceeding, the court shall not act upon any application for informal probate of any will of the decedent or any application for informal appointment of a personal representative of the decedent.\n\nUnless a petition in a formal testacy proceeding also requests confirmation of the previous informal appointment, a previously appointed personal representative, after receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate proceeding, must refrain from exercising his power to make any further distribution of the estate during the pendency of the formal proceeding. A petitioner who seeks the appointment of a different personal representative in a formal proceeding also may request an order restraining the acting personal representative from exercising any of the powers of his office and requesting the appointment of a special administrator. In the absence of a request, or if the request is denied, the commencement of a formal proceeding has no effect on the powers and duties of a previously appointed personal representative other than those relating to distribution.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 8, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-402. Formal testacy or appointment proceedings; petition; contents.\n\n(a) Petitions for formal probate of a will, or for adjudication of intestacy with or without request for appointment of a personal representative, must be directed to the court, request a judicial order after notice and hearing, and contain further statements as indicated in this section. A petition for formal probate of a will:\n\n(1) requests an order as to the testacy of the decedent in relation to a particular instrument which may or may not have been informally probated and determining the heirs;\n\n(2) contains the statements required for informal applications as stated in the six subitems under Section 62-3-301(a)(1), and the statements required by subitems (ii) and (iii) of Section 62-3-301(a)(2);\n\n(3) states whether the original of the last will of the decedent is in the possession of the court or accompanies the petition.\n\nIf the original will is neither in the possession of the court nor accompanies the petition and no authenticated copy of a will probated in another jurisdiction accompanies the petition, the petition also must state the contents of the will, and indicate that it is lost, destroyed, or otherwise unavailable.\n\n(b) A petition for adjudication of intestacy and appointment of an administrator in intestacy must request a judicial finding and order that the decedent left no will and determining the heirs, contain the statements required by (1) and (4) of Section 62-3-301(a) and indicate whether administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] is sought. A petition may request an order determining intestacy and heirs without requesting the appointment of an administrator, in which case, the statements required by subitem (ii) of Section 62-3-301(a)(4) above may be omitted.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment substituted \"in the six subitems\" for \"in the seven subitems\", and inserted \"and\" before \"the statements\" in subsection (a)(2).\n\nSECTION 62-3-403. Notice of hearing on petition.\n\n(a) Upon commencement of a formal testacy proceeding or at any time after that, the court shall fix a time and place of hearing. Notice must be given in the manner prescribed by Section 62-1-401 by the petitioner to the persons herein enumerated and to any additional person who has filed a demand for notice under Section 62-3-204. The following persons must be properly served with summons and petition: the surviving spouse, children, and other heirs of the decedent (regardless of whether the decedent died intestate and determined as if the decedent died intestate), the devisees, and personal representatives named in any will that is being, or has been, probated, or offered for informal or formal probate in the county, or that is known by the petitioner to have been probated, or offered for informal or formal probate elsewhere, and any personal representative of the decedent whose appointment has not been terminated.\n\n(b) If it appears by the petition or otherwise that the fact of the death of the alleged decedent may be in doubt, or on the written demand of any interested person, a copy of the summons, petition, and notice of the hearing on the petition shall be sent by registered mail to the alleged decedent at his last known address. The court shall direct the petitioner to report the results of, or make and report back concerning, a reasonably diligent search for the alleged decedent in any manner that may seem advisable, including any or all of the following methods:\n\n(1) by inserting in one or more suitable periodicals a notice requesting information from any person having knowledge of the whereabouts of the alleged decedent;\n\n(2) by notifying law enforcement officials and public welfare agencies in appropriate locations of the disappearance of the alleged decedent;\n\n(3) by engaging the services of an investigator.\n\nThe costs of any search so directed shall be paid by the petitioner if there is no administration or by the estate of the decedent in case there is administration.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 39; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 9, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-404.

Uncontested cases; hearings and proof.\n\nIf a petition in a testacy proceeding is unopposed, the court may order probate or intestacy on the strength of the pleadings if satisfied that the conditions of Section 62-3-409 have been met or conduct a hearing in open court and require proof of the matters necessary to support the order sought. If evidence concerning execution of the will is necessary, the affidavit (including an affidavit of self-proof executed in compliance with Section 62-2-503) or testimony of one of any attesting witnesses to the instrument is sufficient. If the affidavit or testimony of an attesting witness is not available, execution of the will may be proved by other evidence or affidavit.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 21; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-406. Testimony of attesting witnesses.\n\nIn a contested case in which the proper execution of a will is at issue:\n\n(1) if the will is self-proved pursuant to Section 62-2-503, the will satisfies the requirements for execution, subject to rebuttal, without the testimony of any attesting witness, upon filing the will and the acknowledgment and affidavits annexed or attached to it;\n\n(2) if the will is notarized pursuant to Section 62-2-503(c), but not self-proved, there is a rebuttable presumption that the will satisfies the requirements for execution upon filing the will;\n\n(3) if the will is witnessed pursuant to Section 62-2-502, but not notarized or self-proved, the testimony of at least one of the attesting witnesses is required to establish proper execution if the witness is within this State, competent, and able to testify. Proper execution may be established by other evidence, including an affidavit of an attesting witness. An attestation clause that is signed by the attesting witnesses raises a rebuttable presumption that the events recited in the clause occurred.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 22; 1988 Act No. 659, Section 16; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment rewrote the section.\n\nSECTION 62-3-407. Burdens in contested cases.\n\nIn contested cases, petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death, venue, and heirship. Proponents of a will have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases and, if they are also petitioners, prima facie proof of death and venue. Contestants of a will have the burden of establishing undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, revocation, or lack of testamentary intent or capacity. Parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof. If a will is opposed by the petition for probate of a later will revoking the former, it must be determined first whether the later will is entitled to probate, and if a will is opposed by a petition for a declaration of intestacy, it must be determined first whether the will is entitled to probate.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 23; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-408. Effect of final order in another jurisdiction.\n\nA final order of a court of another state determining testacy, or the validity or construction of a will made in a proceeding involving notice to and an opportunity for contest by all interested persons, must be accepted as determinative by the courts of this State if it includes, or is based upon, a finding that the decedent was domiciled at his death in the state where the order was made.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-409. Order; foreign will.\n\nUpon proof of service of the summons and petition, and after any hearing and notice that may be necessary, if the court finds that the testator is dead, venue is proper, and that the proceeding was commenced within the limitation prescribed by Section 62-3-108, it shall determine the decedent's domicile at death, his heirs (regardless of whether the decedent died intestate and determined as if the decedent died intestate), and his state of testacy. Any will found to be valid and unrevoked must be formally probated. Termination of any previous informal appointment of a personal representative, which may be appropriate in view of the relief requested and findings, is governed by Section 62-3-612. The petition must be dismissed or appropriate amendment allowed if the court is not satisfied that the alleged decedent is dead. A will from a place which does not provide for probate of a will after death may be proved for probate in this State by a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian that the copy introduced is a true copy and that the will is not ineligible for probate under the law of the other place.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 40; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 10, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-410. Probate of more than one instrument.\n\n(A) If two or more instruments are offered for probate before a final order is entered in a formal testacy proceeding, more than one instrument may be probated if neither expressly revokes the other or contains provisions which work a total revocation by implication. If more than one instrument is probated, the order shall indicate what provisions control in respect to the nomination of an executor, if any. The order may, but need not, indicate how any provisions of a particular instrument are affected by the other instrument.\n\n(B) After a final order in a testacy proceeding has been entered, no petition for probate of any other instrument of the decedent may be entertained, except incident to a petition to vacate or modify a previous probate order and subject to the time limits of Section 62-3-412.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment inserted the subsection designators.\n\nSECTION 62-3-411. Partial intestacy.\n\nIf it becomes evident in the course of a formal testacy proceeding that, though one or more instruments are entitled to be probated, the decedent's estate is or may be partially intestate, the court shall enter an order to that effect.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-412. Effect of order; vacation.\n\nSubject to appeal and subject to vacation as provided herein and in Section 62-3-413, a formal testacy order under Sections 62-3-409 through 62-3-411, including an order that the decedent left no valid will and determining heirs, is final as to all persons with respect to all issues concerning the decedent's estate that the court considered or might have considered incident to its rendition relevant to the question of whether the decedent left a valid will, and to the determination of heirs, except that:\n\n(1) The court shall entertain a petition for modification or vacation of its order and probate of another will of the decedent if it is shown that the proponents of the later-offered will were unaware of its existence at the time of the earlier proceeding or were unaware of the earlier proceeding and were given no notice thereof, except by publication.\n\n(2) If intestacy of all or part of the estate has been ordered, the determination of heirs of the decedent may be reconsidered if it is shown that one or more persons were omitted from the determination and it is also shown that the persons were unaware of their relationship to the decedent, were unaware of his death, or were given no notice of any proceeding concerning his estate, except by publication.\n\n(3) A petition for vacation under either (1) or (2) above must be filed prior to the earlier of the following time limits:\n\n(i) If a personal representative has been appointed for the estate, the time of entry of any order approving final distribution of the estate.\n\n(ii) Whether or not a personal representative has been appointed for the estate of the decedent, the time prescribed by Section 62-3-108 when it is no longer possible to initiate an original proceeding to probate a will of the decedent.\n\n(iii) Twelve months after the entry of the order sought to be vacated.\n\n(4) The order originally rendered in the testacy proceeding may be modified or vacated, if appropriate under the circumstances by the order of probate of the later-offered will or the order redetermining heirs.\n\n(5) The finding of the fact of death is conclusive as to the alleged decedent only if notice of the hearing on the petition in the formal testacy proceeding was sent by registered or certified mail addressed to the alleged decedent at his last known address and the court finds that a search under Section 62-3-403(b) was made. If the alleged decedent is not dead, even if notice was sent and search was made, he may recover estate assets in the hands of the personal representative. In addition to any remedies available to the alleged decedent by reason of any fraud or intentional wrongdoing, the alleged decedent may recover any estate or its proceeds from distributees that is in their hands, or the value of distributions received by them, to the extent that any recovery from distributees is equitable in view of all of the circumstances.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 41; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-413.

Formal proceedings concerning appointment of personal representative.\n\n(a) A formal proceeding for adjudication regarding the priority or qualification of one who is an applicant for appointment as a personal representative, or of one who previously has been appointed a personal representative in informal proceedings, if an issue concerning the testacy of the decedent is or may be involved, is governed by Section 62-3-402, as well as by this section. In other cases, the petition shall contain or adopt the statements required by Section 62-3-301(a)(1) and describe the question relating to priority or qualification of the personal representative which is to be resolved. If the proceeding precedes any appointment of a personal representative, it shall stay any pending informal appointment proceedings as well as any commenced thereafter. If the proceeding is commenced after appointment, the previously appointed personal representative, after receipt of notice thereof, shall refrain from exercising any power of administration except as necessary to preserve the estate or unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(b) After service of the summons and petition to interested persons, including all persons interested in the administration of the estate as successors under the applicable assumption concerning testacy, any previously appointed personal representative and any person having or claiming priority for appointment as a personal representative, the court shall determine who is entitled to appointment under Section 62-3-203, make a proper appointment, and, if appropriate, terminate any prior appointment found to have been improper as provided in cases of removal under Section 62-3-611.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 11, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nPart 5\n\nAdministration Under Part 5\n\nSECTION 62-3-501.

A personal representative under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] is responsible to the court, as well as to the interested persons, and is subject to directions concerning the estate made by the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party. Except as otherwise provided in this part, or as otherwise ordered by the court, a personal representative under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] has the same duties and powers as a personal representative who is not subject to administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.].\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment substituted \"interested persons\" for \"interested parties\" in the second sentence.\n\nSECTION 62-3-502. Petition; order.\n\nA petition for administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] may be filed by any interested person or by a personal representative at any time, a prayer for administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] may be joined with a petition in a testacy or appointment proceeding, or the court may order administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] on its own motion. If the testacy of the decedent and the priority and qualification of any personal representative have not been adjudicated previously, the petition for administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] shall include the matters required of a petition in a formal testacy proceeding and the notice requirements and procedures applicable to a formal testacy proceeding apply. If not previously adjudicated, the court shall adjudicate the testacy of the decedent and questions relating to the priority and qualifications of the personal representative in any case involving a request for administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.], even though the request for administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] may be denied. After service of the summons and petition and upon notice to interested persons, the court shall order administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] of a decedent's estate: (1) if the decedent's will directs administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.], it shall be ordered unless the court finds that circumstances bearing on the need for administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] have changed since the execution of the will and that there is no necessity for administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.]; (2) if the decedent's will directs no administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.], then administration shall be ordered only upon a finding that it is necessary for protection of persons interested in the estate; or (3) in other cases if the court finds that administration under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] is necessary under the circumstances.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 12, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-503.

The filing of the petition does not affect his other powers and duties unless the court restricts the exercise of any of them pending full hearing on the petition.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 13, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-504. Powers of personal representative.\n\nUnless restricted by the court, a personal representative under Part 5 [Sections 62-3-501 et seq.] has, without interim orders approving exercise of a power, all powers of personal representatives under this Code, but he shall not exercise his power to make any distribution of the estate without prior order of the court. Any other restriction on the power of a personal representative which may be ordered by the court must be endorsed on his letters of appointment and any court certification thereof, and unless so endorsed is ineffective as to persons dealing in good faith with the personal representative.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-505.

Acceptance of appointment; consent to jurisdiction.\n\nBy accepting appointment, a personal representative submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding relating to the estate that may be instituted by any interested person. Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the personal representative, or mailed to him by ordinary first class mail at his address as listed in the application or petition for appointment or as thereafter reported to the court and to his address as then known to the petitioner.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-603. Bond not required without court order; exceptions; waiver of bond requirement.\n\n(A) Except as may be required pursuant to Section 62-3-605 or upon the appointment of a special administrator, a personal representative is not required to file a bond if:\n\n(1) all heirs and devisees agree to waive the bond requirement;\n\n(2) the personal representative is the sole heir or devisee;\n\n(3) the personal representative is a state agency, bank, or trust company, unless the will expressly requires a bond; or\n\n(4) the personal representative is named in the will, unless the will expressly requires a bond.\n\nIf, pursuant to Section 62-3-203(a), the court appoints as personal representative a nominee of a personal representative named in a will, the court may in its discretion decide not to require bond.\n\n(B) Where a bond is required of the personal representative or administrator of an estate by law or by the will, it may be waived under the following conditions:\n\n(1) the personal representative or administrator by affidavit at the time of applying for appointment as such certifies to the court that the gross value of the estate will be less than twenty thousand dollars, that the assets of the probate estate are sufficient to pay all claims against the estate, and that the personal representative or administrator agrees to be personally liable to any beneficiary or other person having an interest in the estate for any negligence or intentional misconduct in the performance of his duties as personal representative or administrator; and\n\n(2) all known beneficiaries and other persons having an interest in the estate execute a written statement on a form prescribed by the court that they agree to the bond being waived. This form must be filed with the court simultaneously with the affidavit required by item (1) above. A creditor for purposes of this item (2) is not considered a person having an interest in the estate.\n\nThe provisions of this subsection (B) are supplemental and in addition to any other provisions of law permitting the waiving or reducing of a bond. Any bond required by Section 62-3-605 may not be waived under the provisions of this section.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 24; 1988 Act No. 659, Section 17; 1989 Act No. 53, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 42; 1994 Act No. 470, Section 1; 1997 Act No. 152, Section 13; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-604. Bond amount; security; procedure; reduction.\n\nIf bond is required and the provisions of the will or order do not specify the amount, unless stated in his application or petition, the person qualifying shall file a statement under oath with the court indicating his best estimate of the value of the personal estate of the decedent and of the income expected from the personal estate during the next year, and he shall execute and file a bond with the court, or give other suitable security, in an amount not less than the estimate. The court shall determine that the bond is duly executed by a corporate surety, or one or more individual sureties whose performance is secured by pledge of personal property, mortgage on real property, or other adequate security. The court may permit the amount of the bond to be reduced by the value of assets of the estate deposited with a domestic financial institution (as defined in Section 62-6-101) in a manner that prevents their unauthorized disposition. Upon application by the personal representative or another interested person or upon the court's own motion, the court may increase or reduce the amount of the bond, release sureties, dispense with security or securities, permit the substitution of another bond with the same or different sureties or dispense with the bond.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 14, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment inserted \"or dispense with the bond\" at the end.\n\nSECTION 62-3-605. Demand for bond by interested person.\n\nAny person apparently having an interest in the estate worth in excess of five thousand dollars, or any creditor having a claim in excess of five thousand dollars, may make a written demand that a personal representative give bond. The demand must be filed with the court and a copy mailed to the personal representative, if appointment and qualification have occurred. Thereupon, bond is required in an amount determined by the court as sufficient to protect the interest of the person or creditor demanding bond, but the requirement ceases if the person or creditor demanding bond ceases to have an interest in the estate worth in excess of five thousand dollars or a claim in excess of five thousand dollars. After he has received notice and until the filing of the bond or cessation of the requirement of bond, the personal representative shall refrain from exercising any powers of his office except as necessary to preserve the estate or to pay the person or creditor demanding bond. Failure of the personal representative to meet a requirement of bond by giving suitable bond within thirty days after receipt of notice is cause for his removal and appointment of a successor personal representative unless good cause is shown for the delay.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 25; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 43; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment substituted \"five thousand dollars\" for \"one thousand dollars\" throughout, and inserted \"unless good cause is shown for the delay\" at the end.\n\nSECTION 62-3-606. Terms and conditions of bonds.\n\n(a) The following requirements and provisions apply to any bond required by this part:\n\n(1) Bonds shall name the judge of the court as obligee for the benefit of the persons interested in the estate and shall be conditioned upon the faithful discharge by the fiduciary of all duties according to law.\n\n(2) Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the approved bond, sureties are jointly and severally liable with the personal representative and with each other. The address of sureties shall be stated in the bond.\n\n(3) By executing an approved bond of a personal representative, the surety consents to the jurisdiction of the court which issued letters to the primary obligor in any proceedings pertaining to the fiduciary duties of the personal representative and naming the surety as a party. Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the surety or mailed to him by registered or certified mail at his address as listed with the court where the bond is filed and to his address as then known to the petitioner.\n\n(4) On petition of a successor personal representative, any other personal representative of the same decedent, or any interested person, a proceeding in the court may be initiated against a surety for breach of the obligation of the bond of the personal representative.\n\n(5) The bond of the personal representative is not void after the first recovery but may be proceeded against from time to time until the whole penalty is exhausted.\n\n(b) No action or proceeding may be commenced against the surety on any matter as to which an action or proceeding against the primary obligor is barred by adjudication or limitation.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-607. Order restraining personal representative.\n\n(a) Upon application of any interested person, the court by temporary order may restrain a personal representative from performing specified acts of administration, disbursement or distribution, or exercise of any powers or discharge of any duties of his office, or make any other order to secure proper performance of his duty, if it appears to the court that the personal representative otherwise may take some action which would jeopardize unreasonably the interest of the applicant or of some other interested person. Persons with whom the personal representative may transact business may be made parties.\n\n(b) The matter shall be set for hearing within ten days or at such other times as the parties may agree. Notice as the court directs shall be given to the personal representative and his attorney of record, if any, and to any other parties named defendant in the application.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 15, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment, in subsection (a), substituted \"any interested person\" for \"any person who appears to have an interest in the estate\"; and in subsection (b), substituted \"application\" for \"petition\" at the end.\n\nSECTION 62-3-608. Termination of appointment.\n\nTermination of appointment of a personal representative occurs as indicated in Sections 62-3-609 to 62-3-612, inclusive. Termination ends the right and power pertaining to the office of personal representative as conferred by this Code or any will, except that a personal representative, at any time prior to distribution or until restrained or enjoined by court order, may perform acts necessary to protect the estate and may deliver the assets to a successor representative. Termination does not discharge a personal representative from liability for transactions or omissions occurring before termination, or relieve him of the duty to preserve assets subject to his control, to account therefor, and to deliver the assets. Termination does not affect the jurisdiction of the court over the personal representative, but terminates his authority to represent the estate in any pending or future proceeding.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-609. Death or disability terminates appointment.\n\nThe death of a personal representative or the appointment of a conservator or guardian for the person of a personal representative terminates his appointment. Until appointment and qualification of a successor or special representative to replace the deceased or protected representative, the representative of the estate of the deceased or protected personal representative, if any, has the duty to protect the estate possessed and being administered by his decedent or ward at the time his appointment terminates, has the power to perform acts necessary for protection, and shall account for and deliver the estate assets to a successor or special personal representative upon his appointment and qualification.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment substituted \"or guardian for the person\" for \"for the estate\".\n\nSECTION 62-3-610. Order closing estate terminates appointment.\n\n(a) Unless otherwise provided, an order closing an estate as provided in Section 62-3-1001 terminates an appointment of a personal representative and relieves the personal representative's attorney of record of any further duties to the court.\n\n(b) A personal representative may resign his position by filing a written statement of resignation with the court and providing twenty days' written notice to the persons known to be interested in the estate. If no one applies or petitions for appointment of a successor representative within the time indicated in the notice, the filed statement of resignation is ineffective as a termination of appointment and in any event is effective only upon the appointment and qualification of a successor representative and delivery of the assets to him. When the resignation is effective, the personal representative's attorney of record shall be relieved of any further duties to the court.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 44; 1997 Act No. 152, Section 14; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment, in subsection (a), inserted at the end \"and relieves the personal representative's attorney of record of any further duties to the court\"; and in subsection (b) added the last sentence, relating to when the resignation is effective.\n\nSECTION 62-3-611. Petition for removal; cause; procedure.\n\n(a) A person interested in the estate may petition for removal of a personal representative for cause at any time. Upon filing of the petition, the court shall fix a time and place for hearing. Notice shall be given by the petitioner to the personal representative, and to other persons as the court may order. Except as otherwise ordered as provided in Section 62-3-607, after service of the summons and petition upon the personal representative and receipt of notice of removal proceedings, the personal representative shall not act except to account, to correct maladministration, or preserve the estate. If removal is ordered, the court also shall direct by order the disposition of the assets remaining in the name of, or under the control of, the personal representative being removed.\n\n(b) Cause for removal exists when removal would be in the best interests of the estate, or if it is shown that a personal representative or the person seeking his appointment intentionally misrepresented material facts in the proceedings leading to his appointment, or that the personal representative has disregarded an order of the court, has become incapable of discharging the duties of his office, or has mismanaged the estate or failed to perform any duty pertaining to the office. Unless the decedent's will directs otherwise, a personal representative appointed at the decedent's domicile, incident to securing appointment of himself or his nominee as ancillary personal representative, may obtain removal of another who was appointed personal representative in this State to administer local assets.\n\n(c) The termination of appointment under this section shall relieve the personal representative's attorney of record of any further duties to the court.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 16, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment added subsection (c), relating to termination of appointment.\n\nSECTION 62-3-612. Change of testacy status.\n\nExcept as otherwise ordered in formal proceedings, the probate of a will subsequent to the appointment of a personal representative in intestacy or under a will which is superseded by formal probate of another will, or the vacation of an informal probate of a will subsequent to the appointment of the personal representative thereunder, does not terminate the appointment of the personal representative although his powers may be reduced as provided in Section 62-3-401. Termination occurs upon appointment in informal or formal appointment proceedings of a person entitled to appointment under the later assumption concerning testacy. If no request for new appointment is made within thirty days after expiration of time for appeal from the order in formal testacy proceedings, or from the informal probate, changing the assumption concerning testacy, the previously appointed personal representative upon request may be appointed personal representative under the subsequently probated will, or as in intestacy as the case may be.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-613. Successor personal representative.\n\nParts 3 and 4 of this article [Sections 62-3-301 et seq. and Sections 62-3-401 et seq.] govern proceedings for appointment of a personal representative to succeed one whose appointment has been terminated. After appointment and qualification, a successor personal representative may be substituted in all actions and proceedings to which the former personal representative was a party, and no notice, process, or claim which was given or served upon the former personal representative need be given to or served upon the successor in order to preserve any position or right the person giving the notice or filing the claim may thereby have obtained or preserved with reference to the former personal representative. Except as otherwise ordered by the court, the successor personal representative has the powers and duties in respect to the continued administration which the former personal representative would have had if his appointment had not been terminated.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-614. Special administrator; appointment.\n\nA special administrator may be appointed:\n\n(1) informally by the court on the application of an interested person when necessary:\n\n(a) to protect the estate of a decedent prior to the appointment of a general personal representative or if a prior appointment has been terminated as provided in Section 62-3-609;\n\n(b) for a creditor of the decedent's estate to institute any proceeding under Section 62-3-803; or\n\n(c) to take appropriate actions involving estate assets;\n\n(2) in a formal proceeding by order of the court on the petition of any interested person and finding, after notice and hearing, that appointment is necessary to preserve the estate or to secure its proper administration including its administration in circumstances where a general personal representative cannot or should not act. If it appears to the court that an emergency exists, appointment may be ordered without notice.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1997 Act No. 152, Section 15; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment added subsection (1)(c), relating to appropriate actions involving estate assets.\n\nSECTION 62-3-615. Special administrator; who may be appointed.\n\n(a) If a special administrator is to be appointed pending the probate of a will which is the subject of a pending application or petition for probate, the person named executor in the will shall be appointed if available and qualified.\n\n(b) In other cases, any proper person may be appointed special administrator.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-616. Special administrator; appointed informally; powers and duties.\n\nA special administrator appointed by the court in informal proceedings pursuant to Section 62-3-614(1) has the duty to collect and manage the assets of the estate, to preserve them, to account therefor, and to deliver them to the general personal representative upon his qualification. The special administrator has the power of a personal representative under this Code necessary to perform his duties.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-617.

In other cases, the appointment of a special administrator is subject to termination as provided in Sections 62-3-608 through 62-3-611.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-619. \"Executor de son tort\" defined.\n\nAny person who obtains, receives, or possesses property of whatever kind, belonging to the decedent, by means of fraud or without paying valuable consideration equivalent to the value of the property, shall be charged and chargeable as executor of his own wrong (executor de son tort) with respect to the goods and debts. The value of the property is charged to the executor de son tort. Likewise, the value of the property shall be deducted from any distribution or payment of any claim or commission to which the executor de son tort is entitled from the estate.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment rewrote the section.\n\nSECTION 62-3-620. Order for executor de son tort to account for deceased's property; decree for damages.\n\nActing sua sponte or upon the petition of any interested person, the probate judge of the county in which a deceased person was domiciled at the time of his death may order the executor de son tort to account for the property in his possession. Upon a finding that the property has been converted, wasted or otherwise damaged through improper interference, the court may assess damages including attorney's fees and costs in the amount determined by the court not to exceed the value of the property charged to the executor de son tort.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment rewrote the section.\n\nSECTION 62-3-621.

Time of accrual of duties and powers.\n\nThe duties and powers of a personal representative commence upon his appointment. The powers of a personal representative relate back in time to give acts by the person appointed which are beneficial to the estate occurring prior to appointment the same effect as those occurring thereafter. Prior to appointment, a person named personal representative in a will may protect property of the decedent's estate and carry out written instructions of the decedent relating to his body, funeral, and burial arrangements. A personal representative may ratify and accept acts on behalf of the estate done by others where the acts would have been proper for a personal representative.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment substituted \"personal representative\" for \"executor\" and inserted \"protect property of the decedent's estate and\" in the third sentence.\n\nSECTION 62-3-702. Priority among different letters.\n\nA person to whom general letters are issued first has exclusive authority under the letters until his appointment is terminated or modified. If, through error, general letters are afterwards issued to another, the first appointed representative may recover any property of the estate in the hands of the representative subsequently appointed, but the acts of the latter done in good faith before notice of the first letters are not void for want of validity of appointment.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nSECTION 62-3-703. General duties; relation and liability to persons interested in estate; standing to sue.\n\n(a) A personal representative is a fiduciary who shall observe the standards of care described by Section 62-7-804. A personal representative has a duty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent in accordance with the terms of a probated and effective will and this code, and as expeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the best interests of the estate. He shall use the authority conferred upon him by this code, the terms of the will, and any order in proceedings to which he is party for the best interests of successors to the estate.\n\n(b) A personal representative shall not be surcharged for acts of administration or distribution if the conduct in question was authorized at the time. Subject to other obligations of administration, an informally probated will is authority to administer and distribute the estate according to its terms. Upon expiration of the relevant claim period, an order of appointment of a personal representative, whether issued in informal or formal proceedings, is authority to distribute apparently intestate assets to the heirs of the decedent if, at the time of distribution, the personal representative has not received actual notice of a pending testacy proceeding, a proceeding to vacate an order entered in an earlier testacy proceeding, a formal proceeding questioning his appointment or fitness to continue, or a proceeding for administration under Part 5. Nothing in this section affects the duty of the personal representative to administer and distribute the estate in accordance with the rights of claimants, the surviving spouse, any minor and dependent children, and any pretermitted child of the decedent as described elsewhere in this Code.\n\n(c) Except as to proceedings which do not survive the death of the decedent, a personal representative of a decedent domiciled in this State at his death has the same standing to sue and be sued in the courts of this State and the courts of any other jurisdiction as his decedent had immediately prior to death.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2005 Act No. 66, Section 5; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 44, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment, in subsection (a), deleted \"applicable to trustees as\" before \"described by Section 62-7-804\" in the first sentence; and in the third sentence of subsection (b), inserted \"Upon expiration of the relevant claim period,\", and substituted \"has not received actual notice\" for \"is not aware\".\n\nSECTION 62-3-704. Personal representative to proceed with court sanction.\n\nA personal representative shall proceed expeditiously with the settlement and distribution of a decedent's estate under the supervision of the court, as follows:\n\n(a) Immediately after his appointment he shall publish the notice to creditors required by Section 62-3-801.\n\n(b) Within ninety days after his appointment he shall file with the court the inventory and appraisement required by Section 62-3-706.\n\n(c) Upon the expiration of the relevant period, as set forth in Section 62-3-807, the personal representative shall proceed to allow or disallow claims and pay the claims allowed against the estate, as provided in Section 62-3-807.\n\n(d) Upon the expiration of the relevant period, as set forth in Section 62-3-1001, the personal representative shall file the accounting, proposal for distribution, petition for settlement of the estate, proofs required by Section 62-3-1001, and proof of publication of notice to creditors.\n\n(e) Within the time set forth in Section 62-3-806(a), serve upon all claimants a notice stating that their claim has been allowed or disallowed pursuant to that section.\n\n(f) The time periods stated herein for completing the above requirements are not intended to supplant any other time periods stated elsewhere in this Code. The court may on its own motion, or on the motion of the personal representative or of any interested person, extend the time for completing any of the requirements of administration contained in Article 3 [Section 62-3-1001, et seq.] including any of the above requirements, and especially including the requirement to account, under Section 62-3-1001, in cases of estates which remain significantly unadministered as of the expiration of the relevant time period, either as to the marshalling of assets or as to the allowance of claims.\n\n(g) If a personal representative or trustee neglects or refuses to comply with any provision of Section 62-3-706 he is subject to the contempt power of the court. The probate court, after a hearing and any notice the court may require, may issue its order imposing the sentence, fine, or penalty as it sees fit and remove the personal representative and appoint another personal representative.\n\nHISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 26; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 45; 1993 Act No. 181, Section 1608; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment, in subsection (c), inserted \"allow or disallow claims and\"; in subsection (d), substituted \"accounting\" for \"account\"; added subsection (e), relating to Section 62-3-806, and redesignated the remaining subsections accordingly; and rewrote subsection (g).\n\nSECTION 62-3-705. Duty of personal representative; information to heirs and devisees.\n\nNot later than thirty days after his appointment every personal representative, except any special administrator, shall give information of his appointment to the heirs (regardless of whether the decedent died intestate and determined as if the decedent died intestate) and devisees, including, if there has been no formal testacy proceeding and if the personal representative was appointed on the assumption that the decedent died intestate, the devisees in any will mentioned in the application for appointment of a personal representative. The information must be delivered or sent by ordinary mail to each of the heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the personal representative. The duty does not extend to require information to persons who have been adjudicated in a prior formal testacy proceeding to have no interest in the estate. The information must include the name and address of the personal representative, indicate that it is being sent to persons who have or may have some interest in the estate being administered, indicate whether bond has been filed, and describe the court where papers relating to the estate are on file.
