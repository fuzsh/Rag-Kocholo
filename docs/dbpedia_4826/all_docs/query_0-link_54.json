Humbles me as a coach. They won it all last year and they’re more than willing to wait for a few hundred thousand down the road instead of cash right now for the best chance to repeat.”\n\nThe usually unflappable DiCosmo stopped and appeared to choke back tears before saying, “It’s not the wins I’ll remember, or the championships, or the trophies … well, I mean, I WILL remember the wins and the championships and the trophies because those things got me a house off No.7 fairway and some beach property. But what I’ll also remember — besides the trophies and some pretty solid investments that should allow me to retire year after next with the lifestyle I’m accustomed to, minus the locker room smell — is how these guys were willing to take some deferred stocks instead of cash up front. ‘Unselfish’ is the word that comes to my mind.”\n\nHe stopped, gathered himself, then said, barely above a whisper, “Old school.”\n\n“The team that pays together, stays together,” team captain and All-American linebacker CD “Low Blow” Lee said. “Word.”\n\nLee is one of a triplet set of linebackers on an ATM team that dominated last year. As a trio, Lee and brothers CA and CB registered more than 300 tackles.\n\n“If there’s been a better combo of linebackers to ever play, I sure ain’t seen ’em,” defensive coordinator Bowler Johnson said. “And won’t, not in this lifetime.”\n\nThe triplets’ little brother CC anchors the secondary at strong safety. One of the bigger safeties to ever play the game, the 6-6, 225-pound baby of the Lee bunch runs a 4.4, can bench a small county and is one of the reasons opponents attempted just two passes of more than 15 yards all season. While each was completed, one resulted in a limp-off, the other in a cart-off.\n\nThe offense starts with Jimmy “No Shoes” Taylor, a barefooted wonder who confuses defenses and electrifies fans with his daring runs, rocket arm, and six-car garage. A senior from the tobacco fields of small-town Virginia, Taylor missed the first week of fall drills after wrecking his Jag on the drive from his summer home in Jackson Hole.\n\n“He’ll be ready for the opener,” offensive coordinator and NFL Hall of Fame receiver Quincy “Eye Black” Fontenette said. “Insurance covered the Jag; also got Jimmy a new deal with an insurance company whose name I can’t say right now, but I have some pamphlets I’ll be happy to hand you after practice.”\n\nElo “6-Sport” Capers, everybody’s favorite running back, is healthy after having spent the summer “lifting weights, getting my shoulder back right, and rotating the tires on my Audi,” the heralded junior said. Besides football, Capers has lettered in basketball, baseball, track and field, breakdancing, and advanced/varsity trampoline.\n\nHe’s good, but the Guys Up Front might be better. The self-proclaimed Best Dressed Offensive Line in Football (each player wears a necktie during games), the ATM offensive line is anchored by center Trudell “Big Hands” Patterson and guards Blaze “Big Feet” Butler and Grayson “Big Fill-in-the-Blank” Katona.\n\n“Every girl’s crazy ’bout a sharp-dressed man,” the shy and popular Katona said.\n\nThe offense usually plays with only one tackle, but opposing defensive coordinators will testify that at a cat-quick 7-2, 360, Moses “Where He At?” Abraham sort of counts as two guys anyway.\n\nATM opens the season against Wofford.\n\nPicked to finish second this season are The New York Stock Exchange University of Alabama AT&T Fightin’ Benjamins.\n\nContact Teddy at teddy@latech.edu\n\nBy JOHN JAMES MARSHALL, Journal Sports\n\nThe historical record for the local American Legion baseball program is not exactly the most impressive thing you’ll ever run across.\n\nIf you run across them.\n\nTo be honest, that’s probably just better for all concerned. It’s not exactly a glowing resume.\n\nSo before you can begin to understand what the Bossier Phillies have accomplished this summer, let’s take a quick trip down the long and sordid historical trail.\n\nFrom 1950 to 2007, no Fourth District (Northwest Louisiana) team won the American Legion state championship. That’s 57 – fifty-seven – years. You’d think by accident some team would have lucked out over the course of six decades.\n\nThe Bossier Cyclones broke that streak in 2007 and made it to the Mid-South Regionals, but got their hats and gloves handed to them after two games in Paducah, Ky.\n\n(In 1978, a local team did make it to the regionals, but that’s because the host city is a guaranteed a spot in the eight-team field and didn’t have to qualify on the state level.)\n\nAmerican Legion baseball has become such a non-entity that it basically doesn’t exist in this part of the state anymore. There were a couple of examples of local teams making a run to the state championship in the 2000s before getting disqualified on rules technicalities.\n\nDon’t look now, but the Bossier Phillies are about to go where no local team has gone before. After winning the state tournament three weeks ago in Lafayette, then winning the Mid-South regionals in Washington, Mo., they will play in the American Legion World Series in Shelby, N.C. on Thursday at noon (CDT).\n\n“I guess this in uncharted territory for this area,” said Phillies head coach Dane Peavy.\n\nYou think?\n\nThe Phillies will take on Midland, Mich., in the first of three games in pool play. They will also play on Saturday (6:30 p.m.) and Sunday (3 p.m.) in hopes of getting to the semifinals. The pool play games can be seen on ESPN+. Semis on Monday and the Tuesday finals will be on ESPNU.\n\n“I’m really impressed with the way our guys have handled themselves over the last couple of weeks,” Peavy said. “They’ve had some adversity obviously earlier this year and in both tournaments. And we’ve kind of shook that off to really grind through and take hold and do some really good things.”\n\nThe Phillies are 23-4-1 overall and since there is no local league, played in weekend tournaments to get ready for the playoffs.\n\nPeavy, who is the Benton head coach during the high school season, has six of his players on the year – Hudson Brignac, Kade Bryant, Tanner Webb, Jackson Jones, Hayden Millen and Griffin Sibley – to form the core of the team. But there are plenty of added pieces to help take the Phillies to this new level.\n\nThe additions include Tucker McCabe (Northwood), Brody Bower (Minden), Easton Sanders (Glenbrook), Ty Boozer (Pleasant Grove), Blayne McFerren (North DeSoto), Britain Pipes (Liberty-Eylau), Colton Smith (Parkway), Abel Thetford (Parkway) and Cade Moore (Carthage).\n\nOnly Brignac, McCabe, Bower, McFerren and Smith have graduated from high school. “I kind of thought we might be a year away,” Peavy said.\n\nMixing the team together has not been a problem, according to Peavy. “They’ve all played together in various age groups or various teams throughout the years,” he said. “So it really didn’t take just a whole lot to jell. They really play well with each other and they get along. We kind of keep the same mantra that I have in high school – be good humans and be good teammates; stand behind each other and stick together.”\n\nPeavy says the team doesn’t really have an ace on the mound. “It’s just more of what we feel like is best for our guys,” he said. “I think everybody’s kind of carved out their own niche. You never know who it will be from day in to day out (to start) and the guys will know who’s going to be in relief.”\n\nThe Phillies, who reached the state championship game a year ago in Peavy’s first season, advanced out of the regionals this year the hard way – having to win two games in the finals. First, they beat Bryant (Ark.), who had earlier defeated the Phillies, then defeated unbeaten Tupelo, Miss., 5-3 in the championship game.\n\nThere might not have been a local team to reach this far before, but there is one person who knows all about it – Peavy. In 2016, he was the coach of the Texarkana team that made it to the Legion World Series – the only coach in Arkansas history to make it that far.\n\n“To go back to Shelby eight years later after I initially thought I would probably never return, it’s a pretty surreal moment, to be honest,” he said.\n\nContact JJ at johnjamesmarshall@yahoo.com\n\nBy LEE HILLER, Journal Sports\n\nDistrict 1-5A games kick into gear just two weeks into the 2024 high school football season with the district enlarged by one school, now including nine teams.\n\nFour district games, three locally will start 1-5A competition with Benton playing at Airline and Haughton facing Byrd at Lee Hedges Stadium while Captain Shreve and Huntington vie at Independence Stadium and Evangel is on the road at Natchitoches Central.

I fished this level for two seasons while expanding my bass fishing knowledge. To fish with the best anglers in the world was quite the privilege and made me realize just how lucky I was to get in the boat with pro anglers like Clark Wendlandt, Dion Hibdon, and Kelly Jordon. But I also got to wet a hook in some of the best bass lakes in America.\n\nOne of my first favorites would be Lake Okeechobee in South Florida. This is a place like no other I have fished in my entire career. It is a great fishery, but also intimidating with its massive expanse of wide-open cattails patches and hydrilla grass beds.\n\nTo navigate this lake without GPS would be a nightmare and almost impossible to return to an area where you caught fish the day before, as the entire lake looks the same. But when it comes to big bass, this lake is in a class all to itself. Massive largemouth bass in the 10-pound range are fairly common. It’s not unusual for a tournament angler to bring in a 30-pound, 5-fish limit.\n\nNext comes Kentucky Lake. During the early 2000s this lake was on fire and was a magnet for major bass tournaments due to its great fishing. Two things played a key role in what made this lake so good — current and ledges. Kentucky Lake is known as a great current lake as bass set up on these deep-water ledges waiting to ambush just about any lure an angler might want to throw. It’s also one of many great lakes along the Tennessee River chain. While the lake was on the decline a few years ago, it has now rebounded, and the fishing is once again really good.\n\nAnother great lake I fished during my FLW days was Beaver Lake in Arkansas. This lake is a structure fisherman’s dream and was where the “shaky head” craze first started. The shaky head is a small ball head jig (usually 1/8 oz. or 3/16 oz.) with a light wire hook.\n\nThis technique is usually fished on a spinning rod with light line anywhere from 8 to 10-pound test. Known as a bottom dragging bait, this technique is great for catching finicky bass. Beaver Lake is where this technique started. It has become a mainstay method for catching bass all across the country.\n\nCloser to home, and a place that just might be the best bass lake in America as named a couple of years by Bassmaster Magazine, is Lake Sam Rayburn. Located just across the Louisiana/Texas state line in East Texas, Sam Rayburn is the crown jewel of the bass fishing world. Anglers commonly weigh-in 30-pound stringers almost year around.\n\nWhether you like to fish deep or shallow, Rayburn offers you the opportunity to fish any way you desire. It is a great deep structure fishing lake, along with plenty of shallow cover for bass to hide. Probably the number one technique used here is the Carolina rig. This is a drag-the-bottom technique with a ¾ or 1-ounce tungsten weight with a 3-foot leader using a baby brush hog in watermelon/red.\n\nRayburn is also the second biggest lake in Texas and gets more tournament fishing pressure than any other body of water. It’s truly amazing how each week this lake gets pounded but continues to put out 20- and 30-pound stringers.\n\nOther great lakes that I’ve had the pleasure to fish include Lake Hartwell and Santee Cooper South Carolina, Lake Eufaula in Oklahoma and South Alabama, Lake Chickamauga and Old Hickory in Tennessee, Toledo Bend, Lake Fork and a lake I grew up on, Lake Monticello, located just outside of Mt. Pleasant, Texas. But one of my newest favorites is East Texas’ very own Lake of the Pines. This lake has been a sleeping giant but in recent years has really become a very popular bass tournament lake.\n\nWhile some will disagree, another place that has a special place in my heart is the mighty Red River! This body of water has become one of my personal favorites. I’ve had quite a bit of success on the Red River and it seems to suit my style of fishing.\n\nI guess you could say I have been truly blessed to get the opportunity to fish some of the best fisheries in America. Along the way, I’ve made an endless list of friends of both professional anglers and weekend warriors. It has been through this list of anglers that I have been able to sustain a great outdoors radio/podcast program for 17 years called Hook’N Up & Track’N Down.\n\nBut I’ve also had a little help with two great co-hosts, Gary McCoy and Mike Echols. Together we have been able to put together an outdoors program that’s both highly entertaining and educational.\n\nWe are lucky to live in a country with so many great places to wet a hook in the many lakes and rivers loaded with great fish-catching opportunities. Not only can anglers bring in great stringers but can make some great memories, just as I have done!\n\n‘Til next time, good luck, good fishing and make sure to introduce a kid to the great outdoors.\n\nContact Steve at sgraf26@yahoo.com\n\nBy LEE HILLER, Journal Sports\n\nPlenty of top-tier games will ring in the 2024 high school football season when local teams kick off on the first full September weekend.\n\nTaking a preseason look at each week on the schedule, Week 1 is an immediate hit. It is hard to pick out just one game that highlights that first week of games.\n\nThursday, Sept. 5 has two former 1-4A rivals colliding with Northwood hosting Benton. The two schools have stayed on each others’ schedule despite Benton moving up to 1-5A in 2019.\n\nLoyola travels to Monroe to face St. Frederick in a battle of private schools with playoff pedigrees. The Flyers have won the last five outings.\n\nFriday’s slate of games is topped by a battle of 2023 state champions with Oak Grove playing at Calvary. The Tigers come to town after a 12-2 season and a Non-Select Division IV title. Calvary brings a 14-game win streak after taking the Select Division III championship.\n\nA pair of Monroe powers come to Shreveport as well with Ouachita playing Captain Shreve at Lee Hedges Stadium and Evangel hosting Neville.\n\nThe Gators and Lions last played in 2012 but have faced each other 23 times with Ouachita winning 14.\n\nEvangel has won the third-most state championships in Louisiana prep circles with 14 and Neville is next with 12. The Tigers edged past the Eagles 30-29 last year on a two-point conversion stop, and have won four of five meetings.\n\nAirline and Byrd will have hands full with road games to south Louisiana.\n\nThe Vikings travel to Lake Charles to play Barbe. The Bucs finished 2023 6-5 and compete in a tough 3-5A. The Yellow Jackets play at St. Amant who finished last season 10-2.\n\nHuntington is also on the road to face powerhouse West Monroe.

I have to make sure I’m in the right protection or reading the right guy. He challenges me and our offense in different ways.”\n\nThe essence of what made Baker’s defenses the last two seasons at Missouri so effective is no secret. He made his schemes simple and relatable so his defenders could react rather than become mentally paralyzed with too much rolling around in their heads.\n\nIt’s the opposite of how LSU defenders played the last two seasons under former Matt House.\n\nToo much complexity resulted in miscommunication, misalignments and too many mistakes that made the 10-3 Tigers of 2023 rank 103rd or worse nationally in six defensive stat categories.\n\nLSU head coach Brian Kelly took a look at Missouri’s defensive numbers under Baker last season – No. 4 nationally in fumbles forced (17), 11th in sacks (18), 16th in fumbles recovered (10) and 18th in tackles for loss – and made Baker college football’s highest-paid assistant at $2.5 million annually.\n\n“Our scheme is very user-friendly and very player-friendly,” said Baker, who was LSU linebackers coach in 2021 on Tigers’ head coach Ed Orgeron’s final staff before he was fired. “It takes time (to learn). We really work hard as a staff compartmentalizing things, putting things in buckets, and trying to give them (the players) some word association. It’s clicking with them pretty quick.”\n\nMore than one LSU defender describes Baker’s defense as allowing them to play “free.”\n\n“Free, like you don’t have to worry about a lot on your mind,” Tigers’ cornerback Ashton Stamps said. “You have one call, one check, and not like 14 different checks. Just being free allows you to do freakish things.”\n\nLSU All-SEC inside linebacker Harold Perkins Jr. is all in on anything Baker can design.\n\n“Coach Baker has a spectacular mind,” Perkins said. “He can come in here right now and draw up something (a scheme) that I like. He’s always bringing fresh stuff to the table. We may come out in a look we’ve already used, but we’ll run something totally different from it.”\n\nOne of Baker’s charges is making maximum use of Perkins’ spectacular athletic ability, which seemed vastly reduced last season when he moved to middle linebacker.\n\nPerkins is playing in the box again this season as an inside linebacker but with more confidence and knowledge instilled in him by Baker.\n\n“Harold Perkins right now is playing on fire,” Baker said. “We’ve put a lot on his plate. We have packages (for Perkins), and we move him all around. He’s not just playing on the inside.\n\n“I’m very pleased with Harold and his development. If you talk about where he started this thing at the beginning of spring and where he is now, it’s night and day. I really think he’s not even scratching the surface of where he’s going to be.”\n\nMonday began a run of 12 LSU practices in the next 13 days – six straight days this week, a recovery day on Sunday and then another six consecutive days putting the Tigers on the doorstep of season-opening game week preparation.\n\nBaker is trying to solidify a starting lineup and playing rotation.\n\n“We’ve been mixing a lot of people with a lot of different groups,” Baker said. “We haven’t settled into any type of depth chart. We’ve improved a lot physically since spring. The guys did a really good job in the summer on their own. We have about 90 percent of our playbook in and we’re calling it all so there’s a lot on their plate mentally.\n\n“I’m pleased where we’re at, but we still have a long way to go. I’m still looking for more consistency. When we all do our job, we’re pretty good.”\n\nBaker said this two-week stretch of six consecutive practices each week is huge for the defense leading into the Sept. 1 season opener vs. USC in Las Vegas.\n\n“We’re looking for marked improvement,” Baker said. “I think the cream will start rising to the top.”\n\nContact Ron at ronhigginsmedia@gmail.com\n\nBy PATRICK MEEHAN, Centenary Sports Information Director\n\nIt won’t be long now.\n\nCentenary’s first official NCAA Division III football season kicks off Sept. 7 and the Gents begin practicing this Friday.\n\nWatch for more information on preseason practice later this week. Coach Byron Dawson is putting the finishing touches on preparing, including recently hiring a receivers coach with ties to a couple of Arkansas college program.\n\nCody Kent, a native of Marysville, Ark., received a bachelor of science degree from Southern Arkansas and a master of science from Arkansas State. Kent enters his ninth season coaching and has coordinated for seven seasons at the high school and European professional levels.\n\n“Cody is passionate about football and the former marine sergeant will bring high energy and discipline to the wide receiver room,” said Dawson. “This fall, the focus will be building team chemistry and implementing the culture and systems of our program.”\n\nPrior to coming to Centenary, Kent was the QB/WR/TE coach and offensive coordinator for the Graz Giants in Austria. Under Kent’s guidance, the Giants made two playoff semifinal appearances, ranked in the top three in offense in consecutive seasons. The Giants had an international win last season against the Serbian champion Kragujevac Wild Boars. In Kent’s tenure, the Giants were 18-6 overall in two seasons after posting an 8-12 record the previous two seasons.\n\nIn 2023, Kent was the offensive coordinator for Jacksonville (Ark.) High School and helped develop an all-state quarterback who amassed 2,090 total yards and 24 touchdowns. Jacksonville had a 55 percent increase in scoring.\n\nKent was the WR/QB Coach and OC for the Winterthur Warriors in Switzerland for two seasons (2021-22) and coached the QBs for the Swiss National Team against Russia in 2021. From 2019-2021 Kent was the QB/WR/RB/TE coach and OC for Lafayette County High School in Stamps, Ark.\n\nThe Gents will stage a “Fan Day” event on Saturday, Aug. 24 on campus before hosting Louisiana Community Christian in a scrimmage on Saturday, Aug. 31. Further details on those upcoming events will be released soon.\n\nSOFTBALL: The National Fastpitch Coaches Association released the 2023-24 Easton/NFCA Division III All-America Scholar Athletes last week, and eight Ladies were among 72 Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference student-athletes recognized.\n\nA remarkable 8,054 collegiate student-athletes captured Easton/NFCA All-America Scholar-Athlete honors for the 2023-24 academic year.

After spending the formative years grinding it every time another one rolled around, I’m probably a 0-for-the entire century in terms on any measure of interest. A great part of it is due to the way NBC failed to recognize how to best televise the games, mistakenly thinking that showing events on tape delay was the way to go.\n\nThis time around, the presentation has been an A+. You can watch the events live (in the afternoon) or in primetime (taped as if live) if you can stay away from the internet all day.\n\nOr both.\n\nBut television is not the star of this show. The results have been incredibly watchable, but it’s the performers – not the performances – that have stolen this show.\n\nI’m about to go all golly-gee on you, but I can’t tell you how incredibly impressed I am with the athletes themselves. Not just how they run or jump or swim, but how they act.\n\nWhen a race is over, they immediately look to other competitors to congratulate or console. (Almost) no showboating, just a whole lot of respect.\n\nWhen you juxtapose that to the sports we see on a regular basis, it is beyond refreshing. This is the opposite of standing over a defender and staring him down after a dunk. Or bat flipping a home run that makes it over the wall by two feet. Or a running back flexing after a three-yard gain.\n\nIt’s as if when a Cy Young winner strikes out an MVP, the batter would walk out to the mound and congratulate him on throwing a hell of a 4-seam fastball.\n\nAin’t happening.\n\nWhen “Sweden’s” Mondo Duplantis was on his way to winning the gold in the pole vault, silver medalist Sam Kendricks of the USA sprinted across the track to cheer for the man who had just defeated him. Any defensive backs doing that after a wide receiver scores a touchdown?\n\nDidn’t think so.\n\nAnd I can’t get enough of the family celebrations. Or the selfies with random fans. So genuine, so unscripted.\n\nLook, I get that some might think Noah Lyles is a little too over the top, but when you did what he did – winning the 100 meters to become the fastest man in the world – you get to do whatever you want to do, my man. We good.\n\nAs for ringing the bell for the gold medal winner … perfect. Whoever came up with that deserves a raise.\n\nI guess I missed that part of the Olympic preparation involves months of media training. Sure seems like it. They all seem to say the right thing all the time. They are happy, gracious, emotional, genuine and respectful. They answer questions as athletes are supposed to, not saving their thoughts for an Instagram post.\n\nInclude Lyles in that group. After being promoted as a 100/200 double winner, some might think he’d be crushed after finishing third in the 200 and be conveniently unavailable afterward.\n\nInstead, after some quick medical treatment, he went on NBC to explain that he had contracted COVID earlier in the week (he’s also a life-long asthma sufferer) and that he was as proud of winning a bronze medal as anything he’d won before.\n\nThat.\n\nI’ve said it before and I’ll say it again – you can keep basketball, golf, tennis and any other sport in which the Olympics are not the sport’s ultimate goal. Wouldn’t miss them at all. Track and field, swimming, gymnastics, volleyball and a few others provide all we need.\n\nThat’s why the reactions of the athletes in those sports are so genuine.\n\nWe all wish for days in which sports were less commercial or “about the brand.” It’s nice to be reminded that it can still be that way.\n\nToo bad it takes four years to be reminded of that.\n\nContact JJ at johnjamesmarshall@yahoo.com\n\nBy DOUG IRELAND, Journal Sports\n\nThe first event in the Humor & Harmony Weekend downtown was a comedy show unfolding at nearby Municipal Auditorium Thursday evening, with more patrons in the “G Dome” a few blocks east of Origin Bank.\n\nThere were also plenty of laughs at the bank as most of the head football coaches and some of their assistants, and school administrators gathered for the third annual Caddo Parish high school football coaches’ appreciation supper, hosted by the Shreveport-Bossier Journal and Origin Bank.\n\nThe affable group exchanged handshakes and some hugs walking in as in-person meetings aren’t frequent in most cases, although there are plenty of phone calls and text messages exchanged throughout the year.\n\nAfter the supper and brief program concluded, much of the group lingered to visit. New Captain Shreve head coach Jeremy Wilburn, who was offensive coordinator for veteran Huntington coach Stephen Dennis until taking the Gators’ post in January, hung around to chat with Dennis and companions.\n\nEarlier, Wilburn said his new role at Shreve has been exciting – and tiring, in the best sort of way.\n\n“Right now, I’m pretty tired. We’ve been going with 4:30 wake-ups, 5 o’clock locker room, 6 a.m. starts for four days straight now, with multi-hour practices. Today was the first day of school so the kids went to class and got back in the flow of things,” he said.\n\nRenovations to Shreve’s facilities dislodged the coaches and team for spring and most of summer, but that hurdle is almost cleared now.\n\n“We were out of the office for two months this summer, and had about eight days before we kicked off on Monday to get the locker room in order, get the gear in order, soft goods out and everything lined up. We’re still kind of in that process,” said Wilburn, “putting in long days right now. A lot of my coaches have put in many more hours than they planned on through this point of the summer.”\n\nBut that hardly outweighs the excitement, he said. And for him, attending the appreciation supper for the first time provided a very enjoyable step outside the blur of the daily routine.\n\n“We don’t see each other in person much at all, but this evening, for all of us to be able to take a minute to pause, while the bands aren’t playing on Friday nights, we get to enjoy the camaraderie as a group. We’re always with our staffs, and don’t get to have this fellowship much, so that step outside our own circles to mingle with other coaches is what makes this event special.”\n\nElsewhere, Booker T. Washington coach Gary Cooper and Green Oaks’ James Bradford Jr. were trading laughs and barbs, mostly laughs, as they discussed the 2024 “Soul Bowl” battle between their teams. It’s set to cap the Week 3 local prep football slate with another Saturday kickoff.\n\n“Oh, we talk all the time, but not that week,” said Bradford, chuckling.\n\nBut that hardly stops the players on both teams from communicating.\n\n“You can’t shut that off, as much as you wish you could,” said Cooper. “We stress to our guys to be smart about what they’re saying. They’re gonna have fun, and we just want them to keep it in the right mindset. This is a great rivalry with a lot of interest and a lot of history, and you don’t want things to get too heated. You also don’t want to take the fun out of it.”\n\nSome schools were unable to join the supper due to practice schedules or other prior commitments. That resulted in ample leftovers and plenty of to-go plates and boxes heading into the night, a nice way to wrap up a joy-filled evening at Origin Bank.\n\nContact Doug at sbjdoug@gmail.com\n\nShown below: Head coaches (seated, left to right) Gary Cooper, BTW; Jeremy Wilburn, Captain Shreve; John Sella, Loyola; (back row, l-r) Stephen Dennis, Huntington; Chase Thompson, North Caddo; James Bradford Jr., Green Oaks; Thedrick Harris, Woodlawn. (Journal photo by KEVIN PICKENS)\n\nBy JASON PUGH, Northwestern State Sports Information\n\nNATCHITOCHES – Shreveport native Kevin Robinson made plenty of memories on the mound in his first season in a Northwestern State baseball uniform this spring, while another recently unfolded off the field and will send him in street clothes onto a national platform.\n\nIt came via word from the Southland Conference, which selected Robinson as the league’s male representative for the 2024 NCAA Student-Athlete Leadership Forum in Charlotte, North Carolina. The event takes place Nov. 21-24.\n\nRobinson is a member of Northwestern’s Student-Athlete Advisory Committee and NSU’s Presidential Leadership Program and spent his summer coaching high school age baseball players.\n\nHe was surprised by his selection, just as much as his quick success on the diamond was unexpected, he said.\n\n“It’s nothing that I thought would happen in the first year or so,” Robinson said. “I’m excited to get to meet a bunch of people from around the country and expand my network.”\n\nRobinson went from a walk-on to the Demons’ midweek starter as a freshman, posting a 3-1 record and a 2.73 ERA that ranked second on the team. His 5-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio led the Demons as did his 1.09 walks per nine innings number.\n\nA C.E. Byrd graduate who was the Outstanding Player on the 2023 Shreveport-Bossier Journal All-Metro Baseball Team, Robinson became a focal figure in his true freshman season at Northwestern.\n\nHe gave the Demons stability in midweek games and his nine starts were third most on the roster. The son of former Louisiana Tech player Daniel Robinson was the starting pitcher in the Demons’ 11-5 win against the Bulldogs on March 12 at Brown-Stroud Field.\n\nHe was the winning pitcher in the Demons’ first shutout of the season against LSU-Alexandria on April 16 and was the winning pitcher in both games of a season sweep of state rival Grambling.\n\nHis off-field impact in his SAAC role and as a leader on campus, coupled with his baseball success, earned him nomination for the Southland honor.\n\n“This is a very special opportunity for Kevin as an individual,” head coach Chris Bertrand said. “His selection shows he represents all the characteristics we stand for. It shows we are on the right track of bringing in incredible student-athletes into the program and into he university. Once they’re here, we put them in an environment that helps them thrive. To have that recognized by the Southland Conference and the NCAA, there is no better compliment to Kevin and to the program.”\n\nThe NCAA Student-Athlete Leadership Forum provides a diverse representation of student-athletes, coaches and administrators with an opportunity to build a leadership toolkit and develop self-awareness. Participants leave the program with leadership skills, an exploration of values, beliefs and behavioral styles and an understanding of the NCAA as a whole and the value of Student-Athlete Advisory Committees. The forum also creates a network of like-minded peers for continued connection and dialogue.\n\nIt also reinforces Robinson’s success and impact on and off the mound.\n\n“Nothing that has happened is anything I thought would have expected coming in here 12 months ago,” said the well-traveled Robinson, who will visit North Carolina for the first time in November. “It’s really cool. It proves to me the work I’m putting in off the field is coming to fruition.”\n\nContact Jason at pughj@nsula.edu\n\nIf you’ve never seen a race walk, it’s like watching a lot of discomforted people hurrying, with determined and stressful purpose, to get to the nearest bathroom.\n\nThat, you’ve seen. And experienced.\n\nIf you’ve successfully navigated such a familiar situation but you’ve never seen it as a competition but are eager to, you are in for the same feeling of relief and afterglow today. Because FINALLY — it’s here!\n\nI kid you not.\n\nToday — Wednesday, August 7 — the marathon race walk mixed relay competition will be decided, over the hills and through the woods in the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics.\n\nFor more than 42 kilometers, a male and female competitor will alternate every 10 kilometers or so until they’ve crossed the finish line, which in American miles is 26 and a smidge. Male-female-male-female. No baton to pass at each relay point, just a low five. Like tag team wrestling.\n\nWill take between 4-and-a-half to 5 hours, give or take: no one knows for sure since this is an Olympic first.\n\nThis is no slap at walking. This bureau is pro-walk. Like to walk. LOVE to walk. Try to walk two or three miles a day, 10,000-steps-plus and all that.\n\nBut casually. Not competitively. The only things I try to beat while walking are the sun and my age.\n\nThose of a certain age will remember race walking in black-and-white on television, either at the Olympics in the 1960s or on “Wide, Wide World of (Sometimes Walking) Sports, and Jim McKay trying to come up with something to say while, with Jim, we watched a pack of people walking as if they really, REALLY wanted to start running.\n\nWant a professional challenge? Try step-by-step play-by-play.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nLet’s face it: race walking is goofy. It requires a gait that demands you swallow your pride, and maybe a corn cob, at the door. It is not for either the faint of heart or the faint of colon.\n\nIt’s a tough sport.\n\nRace walking became an Olympic sport back in 1908 at the London Summer Olympics, and I can only imagine how:\n\n“Hey, Uncle Jules, since you’re the head of the Olympic Committee this go-’round, think you can make a sport for me? I would like to compete and get a medal but methinks jumping and especially the running, by golly, that appears tiresome.”\n\nBoom! Race walk.\n\nThose who can, run, do; those who can’t, walk.\n\nAlas, this seems to be a part of Olympic fever. When you watch (or more likely just hear, like me) about some of these sports, doesn’t it sound like, “Well, I did all that 50 years ago —at church camp.”\n\nPing pong and trampoline. Skateboarding and bicycle jumping. And the most daring, pride-swallowing stretch of all, 3-on-3 basketball. Now we are taking real sports and dividing them up? Next is 2-on-2 basketball and then 3-on-3 soccer and on it goes.\n\nIf we ARE going to have 3-on-3 Olympic basketball, it should be “call your own fouls.” How is it true 3-on-3 otherwise?\n\nCome on guys …\n\nThis is not an edict or proposal to do away with any of the Olympic “sports.” It’s like college football bowl games: if someone wants to play them and watch them and pay for them to be played, great. If it’s college football bowl games, I’m watching. Some of these Olympic things, neg.\n\nTo each his own.\n\nI’m just saying this: don’t sell this stuff to me as Real Olympics. We know that while the Alamo Bowl is a college bowl game, it’s not one of the Big Six bowl games. And while breakdancing is called an Olympic sport now, it’s not the 100m or the 4×400. To paraphrase, don’t walk on me and tell me you’re running.\n\nFor the record, Americans aren’t walkers of the Olympic variety. We scored a silver back in Antwerp in ’20 (NINETEEN 20) and a couple of bronze deals 50 years ago. In the individual 20-kilometer competitions last week, the winners were from Ecuador and China. Took between 80 to 85 minutes to walk the 12-and-a-half American miles.\n\nThat’s booking it for a walk, between 8 and 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe Americans? We didn’t walk. And we ain’t medley walking today, either. We’ll be running and jumping.\n\nAnyway, that’s it. Gotta run…\n\nContact Teddy at teddy@latech.edu\n\nBy RON HIGGINS, Journal Sports\n\nBATON ROUGE – Spring football practices have no sense of urgency.\n\nThere’s usually a load of returning players sitting out recovering from off-season surgeries. Head coaches experiment with position changes. New coordinator hires are installing their offensive and defensive schemes while patiently expecting growing pains.\n\nWith the start of the regular season 4½ months away, you’ll rarely see any coaching staff member so exasperated they start yelling.\n\n“Spring is more about technical work,” LSU head coach Brian Kelly.\n\nAnd now after the first four LSU preseason practices with the Tigers’ Sept. 1 season-opener vs. USC in Las Vegas looming?\n\nThe LSU practice field, especially from its new defensive coaching staff charged with executing a miracle makeover responsibility of one of college football’s worst units a year ago, is filled with volcanic expletive-filled eruptions.\n\nMaybe it’s because a heat index edging towards 110 degrees – a virtual furnace – greets the coaches and players each morning after they exit the cool-climate-controlled indoor facility.\n\nOr maybe it’s because there’s a smoldering anger among returnees on defense not to be ranked 103rd or worse nationally in six stat categories as they were last season.\n\n“Being able to adapt to our coaches and learn how they want things and how they yell and stuff like that is good, especially early in fall camp.,” LSU senior linebacker Greg Penn III said. “They are bringing the intensity. We (the players) have to match that intensity.”\n\nIt’s up to veterans like starting fifth-year senior defensive tackle Jacobian Guillory to explain to incoming freshmen not to take it personally if an assistant verbally unloads on them.\n\n“I listen to the message and apply it to my game or whatever I did wrong,” Guillory said. “It’s not that they’re yelling at you. They’re yelling at the problem. It’s not an F-you or F-that.”\n\nNew defensive coordinator Blake Baker and new assistants Bo Davis (D-line), Kevin Peoples (edge rushers), Corey Raymond (secondary) and Jake Olsen are priming the pump daily in their daily individual position pre-practice meetings.\n\nLSU junior All-SEC first-team offensive tackle Will Campbell, a projected 2025 NFL top 10 first-round draft choice, said there’s a noticeable attitude change in the 2024 defense.\n\n“It’s night and day the difference between this year and last year with the juice that they come out to practice with,” Campbell said of the defense. “They come out ready to fly around, they’re ready to hit. They’re violent, ready to fight, ready to go. And that’s what we need at the end of the day.”\n\nThat’s a credit to Baker, LSU’s linebackers coach in 2021 who was Missouri’s defensive coordinator the last two seasons where his pressure defenses were known for creating turnovers and huge yardage losses.\n\n“Pressures can come from a lot of different looks, but playing fast is really the essence of what has made Blake’s pressures so difficult,” Kelly said. “The teachability of Blake’s system allows our guys to play really fast without paralysis by analysis.”\n\nPenn, who was a true freshman during Baker’s previous one-season stint with the Tigers, loves Baker’s defensive philosophy.\n\n“He (Baker) wants to attack all the time,” Penn said. “He wants to be aggressive, be physical. If we’re watching film and he sees us playing timid, he’ll say `We don’t want no poodles.’”\n\nGuillory said Baker wants the LSU defense to be “juiced up” every day.\n\n“Even when our defensive backs make a play downfield, I want to run downfield, high-five him and pick him up,” Guillory said. “It’s about being a group and not individuals.”\n\nOn the defense’s back end in the Tigers’ secondary which ranked 115th nationally last season in passing yards allowed (255.6 yards per game), LSU senior wide receiver Kyren Lacy said he already sees improvement.\n\n“Coach Corey got those guys right,” Lacy said. “They’ve changed everything. They come up with something new every day.”\n\nCAMP NOTEBOOK\n\nLSU sophomore tight end Mac Markway, a former 4-star recruit who played in 12 games last season, told Kelly Monday night he’s leaving the program. “He made a decision he’s not going to play,” Kelly said. Markway announced through social media he intends to transfer. Kelly is quite pleased sophomore Ka’Morreun Plimpton (6-6, 242) and true freshman Trey’ Dez Green (6-7, 237), the Tigers’ backup tight ends behind starter Mason Taylor. “KP’s run-blocking consistency and catching assignments have been really good,” Kelly said. “Trey’ Dez has assimilated as well as we could have expected for a true freshman. They’re both going to play.”. . .Returning defensive lineman Bradyn Swinson and Jalen Lee haven’t practiced with the team because they are finishing a morning Spanish class to graduate. “That class ends Monday,” Kelly said. “We’ve been bringing both of them here in the afternoons with an assistant coach, a strength coach and a trainer so they can stay on track.”\n\nContact Ron at ronhigginsmedia@gmail.com\n\nJOURNAL SPORTS\n\nThere are some good rivalries among Bossier Parish schools, but there’s a stronger sense of brotherhood among the football coaches just east of Red River.\n\nThat was apparent Tuesday evening at the third annual appreciation dinner hosted by Origin Bank in Shreveport, and organized by the Shreveport-Bossier Journal sports staff to pay tribute to coaches and administrators as the school year, and specifically football season, is nearly here.\n\nFootball practice already IS here. That kept the Airline contingent from attending, with head coach Justin Scogin sending regrets. But the other five Bossier coaches were on hand for the social event, along with some coaching staff members and principals, and local officiating assignments director Curtis Graham, who provided insight into the men in stripes with whistles and flags who will enable fair play this season.\n\nAward-winning veteran SBJ writer and columnist John James Marshall pointed out to the group that the relationships between the Bossier coaches and football staffs are exceptionally cordial, and that adds value to the matchups as they unfold during the season. Tuesday there were Benton Tigers mingling with Bossier Bearkats, Haughton Bucs laughing with Parkway Panthers, and the ever-friendly Lion from Plain Dealing, head coach Clint Walker, making the rounds with his big smile and firm handshake.\n\nAnd there were friendly jabs. Recounting a few of the memorable prep football stories that Journal writers have produced recently, JJ cited the incredible 2022 score war won 78-71 by Benton over Haughton, looking out at Tigers’ offensive-minded coach Reynolds Moore.\n\nImmediately, Marshall winced as he looked at second-year Bossier coach Gary Smith – who previously was Haughton’s defensive coordinator, and good-naturedly ducked his head and grimaced.\n\nBut Smith popped right back. “Yeah, but the year before, we won 7-0,” he said, grinning.\n\nFact. You could look it up. Journal prep sports guru and historian Lee Hiller did.\n\nMoore and Smith recounted that slugfest in the rain a few minutes later, with Moore claiming Haughton’s touchdown came on a play when Benton had only 10 defenders on the field.\n\nIt was that kind of fun-filled gathering Tuesday night.\n\nMore of the same is anticipated when Caddo Parish coaches gather Thursday evening.\n\nBy DOUG IRELAND, Journal Sports\n\nNATCHITOCHES – For a third straight season, the Natchitoches Central Chiefs football program has a new head coach and that’s unsettling.\n\nBut with Brad Laird in charge, things are settling down fast.\n\nLaird, who was head coach at Northwestern State for the past six seasons, took over this spring after former Class 2A championship coach Jess Curtis, who built a dynasty at Many, bolted to Lafayette’s Southside High. Curtis stayed only one season in Natchitoches after replacing James Wilkerson, now an assistant at reigning Select Division III champion Calvary Baptist.\n\nNCHS finished 2-8 last season under Curtis but was consistently competitive with its Shreveport-Bossier rivals in District 1-5A, losing in the final minutes at Benton and Haughton, and on the last play to Parkway, among other bitter pills.\n\nLaird was 28-18 as head coach at Ruston High from 2013-16. He helped establish the junior high feeder system that has fueled the Bearcats’ return among state powers in the LHSAA’s highest classification, and he hired current Bearcats’ coach Jerrod Baugh from east Texas. Baugh guided Ruston to the Non-Selection Division I state championship last December.\n\nSince NCHS did not stage spring practice as Laird was building his coaching staff, the Chiefs got their preseason camp started a week ahead of most teams. It’s was a week filled with teaching new schemes and a new practice style. So the Chiefs, exactly 100 strong with freshmen through seniors, are already in full pads as they go through their paces this week on J.D. Garrett Field on campus.\n\n“Just now being able to solidify, in the last couple of weeks, our coaching staff, so right now the biggest things we’re doing is 1) playing with great effort but 2) the install,” said Laird.\n\n“Any time a new coaching staff is involved, you’re going to have schematically things that are different. School’s about to start, football season is about to be here, and these guys have shown their excitement with their work ethic.”\n\nClasses start today for freshmen, Thursday for the students in grades 10-12. But for the team, they’ve learned a lot already as they’ve settled in under Laird and his staff.\n\nFor the last seven years, Laird has coached at Northwestern, where the roster was filled with players on scholarship and eager walk-ons hoping to earn scholarship money and playing time. Back in the high school ranks, Laird is enjoying a different motivation from the players, some who he’s watched for years since his son Brock is a senior baseball standout at NCHS.\n\n“That’s what’s fun to watch, because they ultimately choose to come out here and be involved,” he said. “To me the biggest satisfaction is to be able to watch these young men from as early as third, fourth, fifth, sixth grade, and then ultimately when they graduate as seniors, to see how far they’ve come on, and off, the field.”\n\nThere’s a bigger picture, something he’s always kept in mind every step of the way since he entered coaching after wrapping up his playing days as a record-breaking QB at NSU after the 1995 season.\n\nIt’s obvious as the broad smile on his face and the sparkle in his eyes as he moves through the Eugene Christmas Fieldhouse, watching the Chiefs gear up for their evening practice.\n\n“The field is the same, college or high school, just as long and wide. The hash marks are different, the goalposts are wider at this level,” he said. “There’s so much you can learn on a football field, outside of football, and that hasn’t changed. The opportunity to do this in Natchitoches at this level has been fun and I am looking forward to many more days of this.”\n\nContact Doug at sbjdoug@gmail.com\n\nThe dog days of August are upon us and unless you live in Alaska, no one wants to be outside. But there’s still a lot to talk about and I’ve got a few things on my mind that I need to get off my chest. So today, I’ll give you my perspective on some topics that are both good and bad.\n\nFootball season is right around the corner which is hard to believe. NFL teams are right in the middle of training camp while college teams are reporting as we speak. High school teams are going through physicals and preparing to start their preseason training. But no matter who your favorite team is, the fact that August is here means fall and cooler temperatures are coming soon, which is my favorite time of year!\n\nWith the coming of fall, it’s also the time of year where bass tournament anglers who have had good seasons are now preparing for their championship events. Fall fishing can be awesome and is probably my favorite time to fish, mainly because the lakes are not as crowded since a lot of guys are getting ready for deer season.\n\nNext, what changes will tournament organizations like B.A.S.S. and Major League Fishing (MLF) make for the 2025 season? Of course, we are talking about the hottest topic of 2024 with regards to forward-facing sonar. B.A.S.S. has decide to limit the amount of overall screen size per boat to 60 inches. Meaning you’ll be limited to the number of sonar units you can have on your boat.\n\nSo instead of 16- and 18-inch screens, some anglers will go back to five 12-inch screens. Another change for 2025, anglers will only be allowed one transducer per boat instead of three like some anglers have been running. This will have a bigger impact on the anglers than limiting their screen sizes. The jury is still out on MLF with regards to forward-facing sonar and we’ll keep our ears open and will report any changes… if they make any at all.\n\nNext thing on my mind is the amount of cheating going on in tournament bass fishing today. Come on guys… really! If you must resort to cheating in order to win or do well in a bass tournament, you’re a loser anyway. But until judges drop the hammer on these guys and really make them pay for their actions, cheating will continue.\n\nSlapping these cheaters on the wrist with a small fine and picking up trash on the side of the road is not enough of a deterrent. Jail time should be automatic with heavy fines and a lifetime ban on fishing. Sounds harsh? These guys are committing fraud and should be punished accordingly.\n\nWe’ll wrap it up with this. This year, it’s come to my attention that more and more anglers are being diagnosed with skin cancer/melanoma. I continue to see a lot of anglers ignore or refuse to take any precautions by protecting themselves from the sun’s harmful rays. Guys, I am an unfortunate example that we are not bullet proof and you need to do a better job of protecting yourselves.\n\nEvery angler out there should be making regular dermatologist appointments because the key to beating Melanoma is catching it early. Please take the time to protect yourself and find a dermatologist who can detect and treat any skin abnormalities. These regular appointments just might save your life.\n\nChange how you dress for outdoor activities by wearing sun protective clothing and sunscreen. You might think it’s overkill, but now is the time to change your apparel habits so that you can protect yourself from the number one cancer killer — melanoma.\n\n‘Til next time, good luck, good fishing and if you’re not sure it’s a bite, set the hook!\n\nContact Steve at sgraf26@yahoo.com\n\n“He was a very unique man.”\n\nWhat better epitaph for Tynes Hildebrand than the words his wife Julia shared with her son Bruce just after her husband passed from this world into the big basketball court in the sky Sunday afternoon, July 28, following a relatively brief illness, at age 93.\n\nName somebody else who made impact for seven decades – yes, seven of them – on a university, on places like Sabine Parish, Natchitoches and Shreveport-Bossier, and on many more people and places in his travels through our state, this neck of the woods and the college sports world.\n\nAnd I mean world. He and his dear friend Don Landry, coaching at Nicholls, were among the cornerstones of the Louisiana Association of Basketball Coaches and spearheaded international competition for all-star teams in the old Gulf States Conference and its successors 50-plus years ago.\n\n“Coach Hildebrand” kept making the rounds, in his 15 years running the basketball program at his alma mater, Northwestern State. In 13 years as the transformational athletics director (1983-96) at Northwestern. And then for 18 years as an evaluator of college basketball officials, first in an assignment created for him by his protégé, Greg Sankey, then the young commissioner of the Southland Conference, now commissioner of all he surveys in major college sports, but specifically, the SEC.\n\nTynes Hildebrand was truly as remarkable, influential, and supportive a person as you would ever hope to encounter, for so many in such a variety of pathways — Northwestern was just the most prominent. Church, Kiwanis, LABC, other Natchitoches civic causes, then as a leader among residents of The Oaks in Shreveport, and there are more gardens of good he planted. All of it, he said, was a partnership with his wife of 72 years, his Florien High School sweetheart.\n\nShe wasn’t able to attend his funeral Sunday at First Baptist Church in Natchitoches. She was back where they’ve spent the last few years, near Bruce’s home in Flower Mound, Texas, but many friends from all over gathered for Coach’s sendoff, people like retired NCAA coordinator of basketball officials John Underwood, former Southland commissioner Tom Burnett, and quite a few of Hildebrand’s former players, including Mike Brey, now an Atlanta Hawks assistant coach after 23 years as head coach at Notre Dame.\n\nThe service was exactly what you’d hope – sweet, filled with humor, and with reverent celebration of faith. It was as if Hildebrand planned it, which he did. Picked the traditional hymns and Bible verses. Even wrote his own obituary. He knew the final buzzer sounds on us all.\n\nOthers, who couldn’t attend, shared memories on social media.\n\nLarry Hymel, former Southeastern Louisiana sports information director: “I still remember his quote after the Demons didn’t do as predicted the previous year. At a press conference he said “Last year we were picked to be the team to beat, and everyone beat us.”\n\nTammy Broz Boclair, former media staffer at Stephen F. Austin, at Vanderbilt and with the Southland: “Such a wonderful man who was a mentor to so many! Loved spending time with him and soaking in his wisdom! Vividly remember sitting in his office and talking about an upcoming SLC basketball tournament. He told me in that beautiful drawl, ‘Tammy, you need to tell those people what I tell my coaches, don’t make your emergency, my emergency.’ – I still use that today!!!”\n\nDon Worthington, former Alexandria Town Talk sportswriter: “The Sunday is still clear in my mind — Sam Goodwin’s Demon football team had upset Southern Mississippi (22-0, 1984) and I wanted to know more. My sports editor, Bill Carter, said phone him, but I thought I could sneak in a quick trip. When I arrived at NSU my car died in the athletic office parking lot.\n\n“As I was pondering my options, Tynes drove up and I explained my dilemma.\n\n“He threw me his car keys and I agreed to return his car Monday. I interviewed Sam and others, rushed back to Alex and hoped Bill was none the wiser.\n\n“When I returned to Natchitoches Monday morning Tynes had already had my car towed to a mechanic and repairs were underway! I will never forget his kindness.”\n\nBob Tompkins, a colleague of Worthington’s, later Town Talk sports editor: “I remember you telling that story after it happened, Don, and have never forgotten it, either. Tynes was a good man, a righteous man, and I was among a countless number privileged to have him address me as ‘my friend.’”\n\nCarlos Treadway, a rugged Demon tight end who has become president of Ford Credit Europe: “RIP Coach, it was an honor to be inducted into the Long Purple Line (NSU’s alumni hall of distinction) with you.”\n\nRobert Noah, lifelong Natchitoches resident: “I remember going to the games with my dad in Coach Hildebrand’s early years and Dad told me one time, ‘that’s a tough coach but he’s a good coach!’ I met him once, I believe it was at a quarterback club meeting, his handshake, to me just being a kid at the time, was strong and firm like my dad’s. I pretty much modeled mine after his and my dad’s. Coach Hildebrand left a lasting impression on those he met.”\n\nCollin Killian, retired Texas A&M basketball publicist: “Sorry to hear this. Coach was a remarkable human who impacted so many lives. I was privileged to get to know him and Julia when he would observe A&M games. She’d find a quiet corner in the arena (those were ample not too long ago) and spend most of the game immersed in a book. He was always a gentleman and loved sharing interesting stories. A life well lived!”\n\nRight out of college, Hildebrand worked on an Army base involved in atomic energy research during the Korean Conflict. He was honored as the top commissioned officer one year. That experience provided him with a familiar line that often started meetings he’d convened.\n\nIt seems ideal to wrap up this tribute. Because Tynes Hildebrand finally truly is, “at ease.”\n\nContact Doug at sbjdoug@gmail.com\n\nJOURNAL SPORTS\n\nAfter a successful opening week, another round of high-stakes competition is nearing its pinnacle in the Diamond Youth Baseball World Series at Tinsley Park in Bossier City.\n\nPlay wraps up Wednesday evening with the championship rounds. After competition in the Division II brackets was completed last Thursday, Division I play began Friday.\n\nThe DYB World Series is expected to boost the local economy significantly, with an estimated economic impact of approximately $4 million, said Shreveport-Bossier Sports Commission with Visit Shreveport-Bossier officials and local government leaders.\n\n“On behalf of the City of Bossier City, we are honored to continue hosting this prestigious event,” said Mayor Tommy Chandler. “The turnout for Division II was phenomenal, and it’s heartwarming to see Diamond Youth Baseball participants enjoying our top-tier facilities at Tinsley Park.\n\n“The Bossier Dixie Baseball community’s embrace of visitors from 11 states is truly remarkable. Many thanks to the Shreveport-Bossier Sports Commission with Visit Shreveport-Bossier, Diamond Youth Baseball, and our dedicated Bossier Parks and Recreation Department for their hard work.”\n\nThe Diamond Youth Baseball World Series, formerly known as Dixie Youth Baseball, is a top-tier youth baseball event in the United States. This week’s focus is on the Division I category that includes 31 teams in three different categories: AAA, Majors and Ozone. Tournament host Bossier has teams in each bracket, while Louisiana state champions are from Girard (AAA, Majors) and Ponchatoula (Ozone).\n\nThis premier tournament, hosted by DYB, offers a structured and competitive platform for youth leagues and culminates in a series of state tournaments leading to the World Series.\n\n“We’ve had a fantastic time this past week hosting hundreds of athletes and their families in Shreveport-Bossier,” said Sara Nelms, Director of Sports for the Shreveport-Bossier Sports Commission with Visit Shreveport-Bossier. “The games have been outstanding, and visitors have been enjoying local attractions, restaurants, and hotels. The Bossier Dixie baseball family has warmly welcomed these traveling athletes and their supporters participating in Diamond Youth Baseball, creating a wonderful sense of community both on the field and in the stands. We look forward to doing it again this second week. Sports travel events continue to heavily benefit our community as a travel destination.”\n\nThe influx of over 3,000 attendees from 11 states is driving considerable spending across local hotels, restaurants, and retail stores. This event is not only benefiting local businesses but also enhancing the area’s appeal as a top choice for future sporting events and tourism. Many of the participants are extending their stay with family, turning their visit into a vacation and further contributing to the local economy.\n\n“We had an incredible Division II World Series last week and are now gearing up for the Division I AAA World Series starting this Friday,” says Clay Bohanan, Director of Bossier Parks and Recreation. The town has been buzzing with excitement, and we’ve received numerous compliments about our facilities. Many have remarked that they are the best in the southeastern region.\n\n“This week, we’re expecting even more participants than last, which will bring significant economic benefits to the entire city. A huge thanks to Bossier Dixie, the Shreveport-Bossier Sports Commission with Visit Shreveport-Bossier, and the dedicated Bossier Parks and Recreation workers for their outstanding contributions to the success of the DYB World Series.”\n\nA key factor in the event’s continued success is the extensive renovation of Tinsley Park in Bossier City. In 2019, the park underwent a multi-million-dollar upgrade, which included converting fields to turf, adding five new turf infields, a concession stand, playground, batting cage, ADA-compliant field, and improved parking with RV spots. The installation of a lightning detection system and enhanced LED lighting further supports the park’s ability to host major tournaments like DYB. These improvements have played a crucial role in attracting high-profile events and contributing to the local economy.\n\n“It’s incredible to witness the journey of 9,000 participating teams come down to 36 competing for the title of Diamond Youth Baseball World Series champions,” said Nelms. “For many teams, reaching this stage seems like a distant dream, and achieving it is truly amazing. Events like these are about the stories and memories made along the way; winning is just the icing on the cake. Shreveport-Bossier has excelled in creating a fun and competitive environment where participants are making unforgettable memories.”\n\nBATON ROUGE — One of the great all-time entrepreneurial stories belongs to a pair of LSU basketball walk-ons.\n\nWhile riding the end of John Brady’s bench hand-checking the water cooler as a pair of non-scholarship basketball guards, Jack Warner and Brandon Landry had a dream to open their own sports bar after graduation.\n\nThey used LSU road trips as opportunities to visit sports bars across the nation, especially the South, for design and menu ideas.\n\nIn 2003, they opened Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux, a sports bar/restaurant within walking distance of Tiger Stadium. It gradually earned the honor of the nation’s best sports bar from ESPN in 2012.\n\nToday, there are 78 Walk-On’s in 15 states. Walk-Ons even sponsored Shreveport’s Independence Bowl from 2017 to 2019.\n\nYet all of the above may have never happened for Warner and Landry if upcoming NCAA legislation expected to be rubberstamped in time for the 2025 recruiting calendar year had been in place.\n\nThe NCAA is getting taken to the woodshed every time it gets sued. It first resulted in a transfer rule fit for gypsies and made them paid mercenaries thanks to NIL deals with no enforceable parameters.\n\nThe latest NCAA white flag-waving surrender – dramatically increasing scholarships in all sports while lowering roster limits – will make success stories like walk-ons Warner and Landry extinct.\n\nCollege football now has a limit of 120 players on its roster including 85 on scholarship, meaning there is ample roster room for walk-ons though they may never play or eventually earn a scholarship or even dress out for games.\n\nAll indications are major athletic conferences are signing off on NCAA legislation that caps the roster at 105 while awarding 20 more scholarships (from 85 to 105), meaning every player on the roster would be on scholarship.\n\nScholarship increases filling rosters in every sport with scholarship-only athletes would eliminate walk-on programs. Thus, the post-college business success stories of overlooked or late-developing athletes like walk-ons Warner and Landry won’t happen under the new legislation.\n\nClemson head football coach Dabo Swinney is another former walk-on. He played two years at Alabama as a walk-on wide receiver under head coach Gene Stallings before receiving a scholarship.\n\nIt led to a coaching career for Swinney, who has won two national titles at Clemson.\n\n“If (he) Stallings doesn’t see me (as a walk-on), I can’t imagine how different things would have been,” Swinney said recently at the Atlantic Coast Conference media days.\n\n“Walk-ons just want to be part of the team. They want to help you practice. Last season, Florida State had so many players opt out of its bowl game it would have had to forfeit if it wasn’t for all the walk-ons available for the game.”\n\nCurrent LSU running back Josh Williams first joined on their 2019 national championship team as a walk-on.\n\n“I bet on myself,” said Williams, who earned a scholarship in 2020 and enters his sixth season as Tiger having played in 47 games with 10 starts and 1,011 career rushing yards and 11 TDs.\n\nWhile it seems like a scholarship increase should create more opportunities for walk-ons to earn free college rides (a misnomer term considering the sweat equity invested by non-scholarship athletes), that’s not necessarily so.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause of the NCAA’s inability to lasso any common sense and set parameters for its transfer and NIL rules which have worked hand in hand to professionalize college sports overnight.\n\nIt has forced head coaches to increasingly shop in the transfer portal for immediate, experienced talent if they can’t sign their share of blue-chip high school recruits.\n\nIt means a barely recruited player, like two-star rated 2017 football recruit Justin Jefferson, probably these days don’t even get the chance to sign a Division 1 scholarship.\n\nYes, the same former LSU record-breaking wide receiver about to start a fifth NFL season with the Minnesota Vikings after signing a four-year, $140 million contract ($110 million guaranteed) in June.\n\nCurrent LSU head coach Brian Kelly said he has been in discussions with his recruiting staff and general manager Austin Thomas about operating under the expected increase of scholarships.\n\n“Do you all of a sudden start throwing out 30 more scholarship offers (to sign 20 players)?” Kelly said. “I don’t know that I’m comfortable doing that at this point because we’ve evaluated a lot of players and offered scholarships to several players.\n\n“We have to be very, very intentional in how we do this. We’re going to have all options vetted and be ready to move strategically when and if it gets to that final ruling by the courts.”\n\nSince athletic departments have to pay their schools for scholarships, paying for 20 is another added expense piled on the plate of athletic directors who soon will have to deal with revenue sharing by athletes as well as begging rich donors for cash to stockpile in collectives to buy athletes.\n\nIt means wading into every gushing fountain of cash possible, maybe tapping into past forbidden advertising revenue sources such as corporate sponsor logos sewn on school jerseys.\n\nMaybe a future LSU uniform will contain a logo created from Shreveport’s old SPAR Stadium which had my all-time favorite signage on one of its outfield walls.\n\nCADDO RADIATOR WORKS. . .BEST PLACE IN TOWN TO TAKE A LEAK.\n\nI’d buy that jersey in a heartbeat.\n\nContact Ron at ronhigginsmedia@gmail.com"
