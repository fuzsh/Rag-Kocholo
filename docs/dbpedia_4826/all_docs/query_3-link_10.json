        "text": "The 2013 $1 B* duplicate star notes are very popular these days. For those who are unfamiliar, here is an article detailing the event: $1 2013 Duplicate Serial Number Error. Here is the quick summary:\n\nSerial numbers are supposed to be unique for each denomination and series\n\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) accidentally printed 6.65 million $1 2013 New York (\"B\" Federal Reserve Bank) star note serial numbers twice\n\nThe serial numbers printed twice fall into these ranges: B 0000 0001 * - B 0025 0000 * and B 0320 0001 - B 0960 0000 *\n\nCollectors have been trying to find pairs of matching serial numbers - often called Twins\n\nWhat is a duplicate pair worth?\n\nPairs of duplicate serial numbers are considered print errors, so they are inherently valuable to collectors and investors. As of early 2022 only about a dozen Twins have been found and united. Of those, one pair has been sold publicly. It has been up for auction twice actually. First it sold for $7,200 in August 2021 (Stacks & Bowers) and then $9,300 in March 2022 (ebay).\n\nTwo auctions are not enough to draw any long term conclusions, but a pair in hand it is likely worth at least several thousand dollars depending on the condition of the notes.\n\nHere it is - serial number B04436550* that sold for nearly $10,000:\n\nWhat if I only have ONE $1 2013 B* star note?\n\nSingle notes from the duplicate serial number range are NOT considered print errors. They have the same rarity as regular star notes. Tens of thousands of these notes are already in the hands of collectors.\n\nIn the case of these notes, though, people are buying and selling them on ebay for between $25 and $50 for circulated and up to $100+ for uncirculated examples. See completed ebay auctions here. As normal star notes they should not be selling for nearly that much money. Most circulated notes should be selling for about face value. Why are they fetching such a premium? The answer: speculation.\n\nPeople are treating these star notes as lottery tickets. Everyone hopes that they will be the next person to find a matching pair that can sell for $10k or more. That is driving up the price of these notes, regardless of how rare or common they are.\n\nIn Summary...\n\nOne half of a pair: NOT a print error, NOT particularly rare, but people are paying over face value for them\n\nMatching pair: print error and probably worth several thousands of dollars\n\nQuestions for the audience:"
