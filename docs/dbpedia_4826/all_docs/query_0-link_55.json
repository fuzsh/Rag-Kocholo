        "text": "KALAMAZOO, MI – Incumbent U.S. Congressman Bill Huizenga, R-Zeeland, faces three challengers Nov. 8 in the race for the U.S. House’s new 4th District.\n\nHuizenga faces Democrat and U.S. Marine Corps veteran Joseph Alfonso, Libertarian and former state lawmaker Lorence Wenke and U.S. Army veteran Curtis Michael Clark of the U.S. Taxpayers Party.\n\nThe U.S. House’s new, redistricted 4th District encompasses the southern half of Ottawa County, including the cities of Holland, Zeeland and Hudsonville along with the Jenison area. From Ottawa County, the district stretches south just past Benton Harbor and east to include Kalamazoo, Portage and Battle Creek.\n\nThe redistricting had placed Huizenga into the same district as fellow Republican U.S. Congressman Fred Upton. The match-up was avoided, however, after Upton announced earlier this spring he would retire from Congress.\n\nHuizenga was initially without a Democratic challenger after Alfonso, who filed his candidacy last December, was removed from the primary ballot in late May when the state board of canvassers ruled that he had fallen short of the necessary 1,000 signatures to petition onto the ballot.\n\nBut Alfonso went to secure the Democratic nomination on the November ballot after he launched a successful write-in campaign in the Democratic primary in August.\n\nAlfonso is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and previously worked in banking. He holds a bachelor’s degree in environmental science.\n\nHuizenga has served in the U.S. House since 2011 and is a member of the House Financial Services Committee. He also is the co-owner of Huizenga Gravel Inc. Prior to his time in Congress, Huizenga served in the state House from 2003 to 2009. He holds a bachelor’s degree from Calvin College.\n\nWenke is a former state lawmaker who served in the state House from 2003 to 2009 as a Republican. Prior to working in state politics, he served eight years as a Kalamazoo county commissioner. Wenke is the former CEO of Wenke Greenhouses and he holds a bachelor’s degree from Western Michigan University.\n\nClark served in the U.S. Army from 1983 to 2006 and has worked in broadcasting, according to information he submitted to Ballotpedia.\n\nMLive/The Grand Rapids Press partnered with the nonpartisan League of Women Voters of Michigan to provide candidate information for readers. Each candidate was asked to outline their stances on a variety of public policy issues listed below.\n\nClark did not respond when asked to participate in filling out the questionnaire.\n\nAll responses in the voter guide were submitted directly by the candidate and have not been edited by the League of Women Voters, except for necessary cuts if a reply exceeded character limitations. Spelling and grammar were not corrected. Publication of candidate statements and opinions is solely in the interest of public service and should NOT be considered as an endorsement. The League never supports or opposes any candidates or political parties.\n\nInformation on other state, county and local primary races can be found at Vote411.org.\n\nWhat do you see as the federal government’s role in health care? Given the COVID-19 pandemic, what are your concerns and plans regarding public health in the U.S.?\n\nJoseph Alfonso:\n\nOur first step in convincing the general public that medicare for all would work is to have them see it at work in their homes. Medicare for everyone under the age of 18 would educate every family on the financial freedom it would provide and afford medical care access to every child in the United states. If a Medicare for All bill comes across my desk I will sign it, but if we cannot get there, this step would push us closer to our goals and help millions of Americans.\n\nBill Huizenga:\n\nAccess to affordable health care is out of reach for too many people. To reduce costs and increase access to health care, we must curb costly junk lawsuits, encourage the use of health savings accounts, increase portability, and empower both small businesses and states to be innovative in reducing costs for employees and their families. Any reforms Congress passes must include protections for patients with pre-existing conditions. Congress must make improving mental health care a priority. I continue to lead bipartisan efforts to modernize and improve mental healthcare at the federal level.\n\nLorence Wenke:\n\nThe Federal government pays too many of the nation’s health care bills, but where the Federal government pays the bills it should also make the rules. Personal responsibility for an individual’s healthcare should be connected to how much and how often the Federal government pays the bills for an individual. I support the Federal government taxing harmful health products such as alcohol, sugars, transfats to reduce the cost of medical care. Pandemics like Covid 19 are rare but preparation by the Federal government is necessary & should support vaccinations, research and rules of behavior. Government did well in response to Covid 19.\n\nWhat federal policies do you support for a healthy economy and to help Americans without financial security improve their economic positions?\n\nBill Huizenga:\n\nAs a small business owner, I understand what Michigan job creators need: less red tape and lower taxes. My number one priority in Congress is to promote an atmosphere for job creation, economic growth, and higher wages for employees across Michigan. Washington’s addiction to spending is having a negative impact on our economy, increasing inflation, and raising costs on families across Michigan. That is why I am a strong supporter of the Inflation Prevention Act and continue to support a balanced budget amendment to fully address Washington’s out of control spending over the long term.\n\nLorence Wenke:\n\nWealthy people should pay a higher tax rate on income than lower income taxpayers. Balancing the budget with tax increases and spending reductions will have my support. Wealthy people have too many options for reducing their taxes. All citizens should pay at least a small minimum in taxes on their income. I support legislation for returning manufacturing from China to America. I support reducing financial subsidies for people who could work and refuse. I do not support endless funding to parents for children born to parents who will not take responsibility for their children. Support for job training should be accessible.\n\nJoseph Alfonso:\n\nHaving access to fields that the community needs is a starting point. Sometimes young people, or even older people, learn outside rather than the classroom. We can work with the small businesses on creating opportunities for those who do not have financial security.\n\nWhat federal policies do you support regarding elections, campaign funding and voting rights?\n\nLorence Wenke:\n\nFederal policies should set the dates for elections and be the final source of enforcement of accurate vote counting when Federal employees are being elected. All dollars spent funding campaigns from any sources should be on public record for all to view. The voting rights of all citizens should be protected, counted by machines and according to the rules of the State and Federal governments. The gerrymandering of districts should be ended by the Federal government. Citizens who have the right to vote should be issued specific voting identification that can be used at polls and absentee ballots.\n\nJoseph Alfonso:\n\nWe can really improve our system by taking money out of politics and putting it into our elections. The right to vote is sacred and should be protected, and putting in barriers on citizens of this community to use that sacred power is against the foundation we are supposed to be.\n\nBill Huizenga:\n\nThe idea that our election process should be open and free from illegal practices is the cornerstone of our democracy. While we should continue to bring more Americans into our democratic process, it should be done without the threat of fraud or abuse to the electoral system. That is why I am supporting the Save Democracy Act. The Save Democracy Act would institute common-sense reforms to address election integrity concerns and restore confidence in the principle of one-citizen, one-vote. Congress must continually work to ensure that each federal election is free, fair, and legitimate.\n\nHow would you address racial, economic, health and education inequities, including our country’s 16% of children and 10% of seniors living in poverty?\n\nJoseph Alfonso:\n\nOur community can have all the job openings they could ask for, but if those jobs are paying qualified people below their survivability we are going to continue to see this problem. Policy that makes universities explain why the cost of their schools are what they are is a step in the right direction. Not making parents wait for a child tax credit to come in at the end of a year, and stop borrowing against Social Security could help lower that percentage as well.\n\nBill Huizenga:\n\nA federal policy is not going to address these inequities overnight. Students, regardless of their zip code, should have access to a quality education where teachers, administrators, and parents have greater input.\n\nRampant inflation is causing soaring prices that hurt seniors, individuals, and families across all walks of life. Enacting pro-growth policies can reduce economic disparities, lower prices, and increase opportunity. Workforce development must be geared to equip those seeking work with job openings.\n\nLorence Wenke:\n\nTaxpayers’ support should only be available to people who made use of their free public education, did not have children outside of marriage, do not use drugs, and are willing to work. Taxpayer dollars needs to be earned through work or volunteer work through government approved agencies. Citizens who are sick, injured or old should be the first to get taxpayer support. Taxpayer support should be depend on a person’s education history and work history. Work and taxpayer support need to be directly connected. Racial discrimination is very real and reparations for African Americans should be considered. Criminals should not be subsidized.\n\nWhat policies do you support to meet U.S. energy needs while protecting our water, air and land for current and future generations?\n\nLorence Wenke:\n\nProduction of energy through fracking, drilling, and digging has my support. Nuclear, solar and wind electrical generation have my support. We need to change to electric automobiles and trucks. Building codes for insulation need to be strengthened. Efficient mass transportation needs to be subsidized and encouraged. Pollution of our water is very difficult and expensive to remedy. Government needs the right to review how we get our water, how we use it and how clean it is when we are through using it. This means access to businesses and reporting by businesses on the use of water. Farmers need to be included\n\nBill Huizenga:\n\nAmerica is facing an energy crisis and our focus should be on unleashing domestic energy. The US must adopt an “all of the above” approach that responsibly develops our resources, utilizes alternatives, ends our reliance on foreign oil, and protects & preserves our environment. As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Great Lakes Task Force, I have been on the forefront of the efforts to preserve the ecology and economy of the Great Lakes. As a member of the bipartisan PFAS Task Force, I have worked to protect communities from contamination, promote research, and support cleanup efforts.\n\nJoseph Alfonso:\n\nExtension of several energy tax incentives, including the production tax credits (PTC) for wind and solar electricity, electric vehicle tax credits, and incentives for advanced biofuel production. We protect our water, air and land by not only passing laws but working with our local, state and sovereign territories on solutions they may have in order to have the best results, while spending wisely.\n\nWhat policies do you support relative to immigration to the U.S.?\n\nBill Huizenga:\n\nOur immigration system is broken. A workable and effective immigration bill should recognize America’s immigrant heritage and respect the enormous contributions of immigrants by encouraging and enforcing legal immigration. Immigration reform must prioritize border security and a legal identification process rather than providing amnesty. I will continue to work towards a rational and balanced immigration reform bill that opposes amnesty, ensures border integrity, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes hard working Americans.\n\nJoseph Alfonso:\n\nThe pathway to citizenship should be made accessible and fair. We need reform at the board on how we process asylum seekers and a more humane way in dealing with those coming to America to seek a better life. There is no us vs. them. This is an issue of values and the value is simple, do you value human life?\n\nLorence Wenke:\n\nThe boarders of our country need to be secured so that immigration is controlled. No one seems to have a better idea on how to do this than a wall along our border in Mexico. We need immigrants but we should choose them and they should enter according to our immigration laws. Every state should be responsible for their share of illegal immigrants and supply jobs or money. Citizenship in the USA should be hard to get. Babies born in the USA to illegal immigrants should not be considered citizens. Illegal immigrants should be receive taxpayer funded services.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat to expect from Michigan’s first gubernatorial debate on Thursday\n\nMeet the 11 candidates running for the Grand Rapids school board"
