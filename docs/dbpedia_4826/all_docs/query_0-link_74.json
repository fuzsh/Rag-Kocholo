The Milner project is. To have great improvements and this is one of the pro. Acts which will a Teri Fly increase production on the Southside and eventually enhance business conditions in this Section of Idaho. The fact that one thousand men. Will soon be at work on the Rogerson Wells Railroad would indicate that we Are soon to have a Road connecting this Metropolis with the great California markets. This is a dream of the residents of Southern Idaho for years Ancl when it reaches fruition will be the result of Many anxious hours of waiting and expectation on the part of hundreds of settlers on the twin Falls tract. A Quot 5 ,. A a a a Quot. The business women s club of Al win Falls is a progressive lot of girls and. You no we Man who Are working for the up building of this Community at no Little sacrifice. The majority of these Are working in offices or some other gainful occupations while they Are doing their share in the up building of the Community. Such self sacrifice should not be overlooked by the business men and Citi. Zens of this Quot Community. Twin Falls needs much of this Community building spirit and. Every organization such As this should be encouraged. A a a to a a a a the fourth of july committee seems to Quot be working hard on the program for the Celebration of our National Independence Day Here. Such a committee must work accomplish much these plays because everybody is inclined to. Quot let George do it Quot and this spirit militates against the committee. We should take More interest in the Celebration of this great anniversary and sometimes one feels inclined to suggest that those who so steadfastly refuse Are almost lacking in patriotism. While we do not care to make such a suggestion yet such an idea is really implied on the part of some. Let s do our part even if it does Cost us some Effort and some sacrifice. The cause is Worth purebred poultry purebred poultry is receiving encouragement through the interest of a leading merchant in Laurel Jones county who gave 20 settings of purebred Rhode Island red eggs to 20 &quot4h poultry club members. A these girls were required to raise As Many As possible of the Chicks hatched and keep ail except one Pullet which was returned to the donor. The 20 pullets which Camea Back were made into 5 pen to each of which a cock was added. The 5 pens were then Given to.5 other girls in the. County who were to own the chickens. Each of. These girls however Promise to Send in a setting of eggs to be distributed in turn to other girls. Eighteen of the original Quot girls succeeded with the project according to a report received by the United. States department of agriculture. The two who failed were allowed to try again. This plan has proved an excellent Means of interesting club girls in the production of purebred poultry and Many of their neighbors have also become interested. Quot a re there seems to be More excitement in the Republican political Camp Over an editorial which appeared in the v times recently urging fusion than there is in the democratic circles. In other words Quot the jeffersonian Are biding their time and carefully watching developments but some of the g. O. P. Leaders Are quite excited Over the proposition. Generally speaking anything which looks like defeat for the grand old party excites considerable speculation and we feel that this fusion idea is the Only possibility of winning the election in Idaho this fall. Whether Samuels is selected to head the ticket or some other Leader of Merit is riot the Issue but if the democrats and progressives wish to get a majority of the votes at the a a coming election they must get together on a ticket. Some of the democrats object to this and this is no More than we expected but we should recall also that some folks in1 both parties Are always bitterly opposed to fusion of any sort and yet when it comes to a question of Victory or defeat we a do not believe our Republican Bra them would a hesitate on this Issue.
