        "text": "\"He has a world-wide reputation for being a pain in the ass.\"\n\n—Sarah Harding(src)\n\nDr. Richard Levine is a wealthy palaeontologist who appears only in The Lost World. Like John Hammond, he is only interested in details, particularly the behavior of dinosaurs and does not much think of the consequences of his actions nor how the dinosaurs on Isla Sorna were created. In this way, he acts as the antithesis of Ian Malcolm, who shows interest in the cause and effect aspect of actions. The Lost World starts with a series of appearances of large and unknown lizards being found on the shores of Costa Rica. Levine and Martin Gutierrez travel to Costa Rica to investigate these appearances. Levine attempts to take pictures of a body of a large dinosaur carcass, identified as an Ornitholestes. Levine sends some of its flesh to Dr. Malcolm who inspects it with his friend Elizabeth Gelman.\n\nAppearance and Personality[]\n\nDuring the events of The Lost World he is in his early thirties.[1] He is tall and dark. He often wears khaki clothing. He wears wire-frame spectacles and was known to be often cowardly towards the worst of situations.[2][3]\n\nHe is precise in his movements and manner. He is generally agreed to be the best paleontologist of his generation. Most people find him pompous and arrogant. He ignores his own plight, ignoring dangers to his own health, even after being bitten by a Procompsognathus and was never grateful for being rescued. Only after Ian Malcolm and Sarah Harding explain the effects of DX and him realising he was bitten by a compy, does Levine realize he may suffer from adverse health effects.[4]\n\nIn The Lost World[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nRichard Levine was probably born in the early 1960s, since he is in his early thirties in 1993. Levine is part of the Estate of a famous toy series, the Becky Dolls. [5] Though precise details remain unknown \"Becky Dolls\" could very well likely be a pseudonym for the \"Pleasant Company\" makers of requisite and quality dolls in the 1990s. The company is now called \"American Girl\" and remains successful throughout the decades, insinuating that therefore he is wealthy. The Becky Dolls could also be a pseudonym for \"Barbie Dolls.\"\n\nEducation and work[]\n\nLevine studied biology at Yale University together with Martin Guitierrez. Levine quit the doctoral program to get his degree in comparative zoology. His interest became focused on prehistoric life and became a famous paleontologist at Berkeley.\n\nSearch for the Lost World[]\n\nIn August 1993, Levine first appears, attending Malcolm's talk \"Life at the Edge of Chaos\" at the Santa Fe Institute. He persuades Malcolm to help him to search for dinosaurs in Costa Rica.[1]\n\nA judge ordered that Levine's driving licence is cut and Levine has to do public service after a massive speeding violation, and he complied by teaching a seventh grade class, which is how he met Arby Benton and Kelly Curtis. Levine coincidentally learns that he is not the only one looking for the 'lost world', and he rushes to Isla Sorna without informing Malcolm or Jack Thorne. When he arrived at Isla Sorna, he and his guide Diego attempt to climb a cliff face before being assaulted by a pack of Velociraptors. Diego is dragged off but Levine survives and tells the group that it was probably because of his large backpack that could have imposed on the raptors.\n\nIsla Sorna[]\n\nunder construction\n\nIn The Lost World: Jurassic Park[]\n\nDespite being a main character in the book The Lost World, Levine is not featured in the movie version. Instead, in the film, some of his actions were transferred to Sarah Harding and John Hammond.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nLevine drives a bright-red Ferrari.[6]\n\nLevine may be able to read German, because when Jack Thorne, Arby Benton, and Kelly Curtis went into his house, they saw some books with German title on the desk.[7]\n\nHis character was cut from the film version of the novel and was incorporated into Sarah Harding's character.\n\nReferences[]\n\nNavigation[]"
