        "text": "Dear Colleague:\n\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act (Act) was enacted into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022. The Act further amends the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), and impacts the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®).\n\nOver the past three years, the Department of Education (Department or we) has implemented these changes in phases, beginning with the 2021-22 Award Year. The final phase of the Department’s implementation of the changes required by the Act will occur in the 2024-25 Award Year.\n\nThis Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) summarizes the changes resulting from the Act that have previously been implemented and explains the final changes to the need analysis formulas and the calculation of Pell Grant awards that the Department is implementing beginning with the 2024-25 Award Year. The Department will make significant and extensive changes to the FAFSA form and process for the 2024-25 Award Year to implement these statutory changes.\n\nThe Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) has also published Questions and Answers (Q&As) about FAFSA Simplification changes for the 2024-25 Award Year. These Q&As can be found on the OPE website.\n\nThe Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to calculate a student’s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA applicants—and, where applicable, their parents and spouses—through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly from the IRS to the Department with an individual’s approval and consent. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid.\n\nThere are strict limitations on the access and use of FTI under the IRC. FTI will only be available to institutions, state higher education agencies, and designated scholarship organizations, via the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR). FTI will not be included on the FAFSA Submission Summary.\n\nApplicants may view all information provided on their FAFSA by obtaining an unredacted copy of their ISIR from their school. However, contributors may only obtain information they provided on the FAFSA, such as their FTI. Contributors are individuals, such as a parent or spouse, that may be required to provide information on an applicant’s FAFSA depending on the applicant’s dependency or marital status. Despite these limitations, institutions are still permitted to use professional judgment to amend FAFSA data values, including information that was originally received as FTI.\n\nApplicants and other contributors must consent to the use of their FTI on the FAFSA. An applicant or contributor can enter income and tax data manually on the FAFSA. However, we will reject the ISIR, and the applicant will not be eligible for federal student aid until all required contributors provide consent. Because the FUTURE Act requires consent to use FTI for federal student aid eligibility and FTI includes filing status, nontax filers must also consent.\n\nApplicants and other FAFSA contributors will also need to provide information on the FAFSA that is not FTI (such as certain demographic information and assets). That information is subject to general requirements for use and disclosure of FAFSA data.\n\nAn Electronic Announcement (EA ID: GENERAL-23-34), published May 12, 2023, contains additional information on the requirements for accessing and using FTI. The Department also plans to provide additional information about requirements for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information, including FTI, in the near future.\n\nOther types of untaxed income have been eliminated from the need analysis, including housing, food, and living allowances paid to members of the military and clergy; veterans noneducation benefits; and the general categories of “other untaxed income” and “money received by or paid on behalf of the student.”\n\nNote that foreign earned income exclusion amounts must be entered manually (they are not transferred via the FA-DDX), and although they are included in the calculation of an applicant’s SAI, they are not considered when determining the applicant’s eligibility for a Maximum Pell Grant. As such, for the 2024-25 Award Year there will be a new “C flag” comment code added to the ISIR that will require institutions to review how foreign income exclusion amounts impact eligibility for a Maximum Pell Grant prior to awarding federal student aid. See the relevant Q&A at OPE’s website for details.\n\nApplicants and contributors who file foreign tax returns will not have tax information available to retrieve from the IRS and instead will have to input their income and tax data manually, although they will still be required to provide consent to use their FTI (which includes filing status). They will convert foreign currency to dollars and enter the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns, such as adjusted gross income, income tax paid, and any untaxed income that corresponds to the five types of untaxed income listed above.\n\nThe definition of family size has changed to align with the number of individuals reported as dependents on the applicant’s (if independent) or applicant’s parents’ (if dependent) U.S. tax return. Applicants may update family size if it changes after filing the tax return.\n\nThe number of family members in college is no longer a factor in the need analysis. Schools may use professional judgment to adjust other data items related to COA or SAI that reflect costs associated with additional family members enrolled in college.\n\nThe Simplified Needs Test (SNT) and Auto-Zero were eliminated. Some applicants will still qualify for an automatic Maximum Pell Grant or be exempt from asset reporting based on similar criteria.\n\nSome applicants will qualify for a Maximum Pell Grant based on tax filing status or on AGI compared to poverty threshold for their family size and state of residence. Those who qualify for a Maximum Pell Grant and are not required to file a federal income tax return (if independent) or whose parents are not required to file a federal income tax return (if dependent) will be assigned an SAI equal to -1,500. Other students eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant will receive an SAI no greater than 0.\n\nOther applicants will have assets excluded from their SAI calculation based on income, tax filing status, and receipt of a benefit from a federal means-tested benefit program. This asset exclusion effectively replaces the SNT from the EFC formulas. The following applicants are eligible for the asset exclusion provision:\n\nThe criteria used to determine dependency status for receiving federal student aid remain largely the same but with some differences.\n\nBeginning with the 2024-25 award year, students who are separated will no longer be considered married and should not indicate they are married on the FAFSA. Unless independent by a criterion other than marriage, they will be considered dependent students.\n\nThe Act adds to the dependency override (DO) provision by noting that a DO may be warranted when a student is unable to contact their parents or when contact poses a risk to the student. Circumstances where contact is not possible or risky can include human trafficking (as described in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act); legally granted refugee or asylum status; parental abandonment; estrangement; or student or parent incarceration. However, incarceration by itself is not sufficient to make a student automatically independent. The financial aid administrator would need to determine that the student is unable to contact their parent(s) or that contact would pose a risk to the student.\n\nThe Act changes the statutory basis for determining who is a veteran. It cites Title 38 (about veterans’ benefits) of the U.S. Code, section 101(2), which has similar language to the HEA and states that a veteran is one who served in the active military, naval, air, or space service and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable. The Act further provides that “veteran” includes any person who falls under 38 U.S.C. 101(21)-(23). Those paragraphs define “active duty,” “active duty for training,” and “inactive duty training.” FAAs should rely on Sec. 101 definitions to determine whether an applicant is a veteran.\n\nBeginning with the 2024-25 award year, otherwise dependent students who indicate that they have unusual circumstances that prevent them from providing parent data will no longer receive a rejected application but will instead have their application processed with a provisional independent status. This will generate output documents with a provisional SAI and an estimate of federal student aid eligibility. Aid administrators will need to make a final determination whether these students should receive a dependency override.\n\nThe guidance in DCL GEN-22-15, in the section “Additional Flexibility for Assisting Students with Unusual Circumstances,” established the communication timeline and processing procedure that schools must follow beginning in the 2023-24 Award Year when handling cases where students indicate they might be independent due to unusual circumstances. The communication timeline and processing procedure laid out in that DCL will continue in Award Year 2024-2025 and beyond.\n\nUnder the Act, the term “estimated financial assistance (EFA)” was replaced with “other financial assistance (OFA).” OFA still refers to all scholarships, grants, loans, or other assistance known to the institution at the time the determination of the student's need is made. FSA will begin using the term “other financial assistance” throughout our various publications and websites.\n\nThe formula for determining a student’s need remains the same, except that EFC has been replaced by SAI and EFA has been replaced by OFA. When determining a student’s need, an institution will use the following formula: Cost of Attendance (COA) minus Student Aid Index (SAI) minus Other Financial Assistance (OFA) equals need. (COA – SAI – OFA = Need)\n\nThe new definition of items excluded from consideration as other financial assistance now includes the following two forms of assistance:\n\nAn applicant may receive a negative SAI as low as -1,500. When packaging students for need-based Title IV aid (Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Direct Subsidized Loan programs), convert any negative SAIs to a 0 SAI for awarding purposes. For example, consider an applicant with a $15,000 COA, a -500 SAI, and a $7,395 Federal Pell Grant. When calculating remaining need for other need-based programs, the school will change the -500 to 0 in the need-based calculation referenced above. The student’s remaining need will be $7,605 ($15,000 – 0 – $7,395 = $7,605).\n\nNote that a negative SAI converted to 0 will also not increase a student’s eligibility for non-need-based aid.\n\nIn amending HEA section 475, Congress removed the provisions that allowed schools to use alternate EFCs when packaging students for periods other than 9 months. Therefore, when packaging for any period that is not 9 months, schools will use the calculated SAI (9-month) in the awarding formula for need-based aid (COA – SAI – OFA = Need). For example, if a student is attending a summer term only, the COA used to determine subsidized Direct Loan eligibility will be based on the actual period of enrollment (3 months), but the SAI used in the formula will be the 9-month calculated SAI. As a result, students enrolled for periods shorter than 9 months will have less need than when using an alternate EFC.\n\nThe Act affirms that institutions may not require additional information beyond the FAFSA to award or disburse federal financial aid to applicants. The exceptions to this rule are if additional information is required to complete the verification process, document a determination of independence, or exercise professional judgment. Additional information may be requested for the separate awarding of state, tribal, and institutional financial aid. We encourage institutions, state higher education agencies, and others to rely solely on the Student Aid Index and other FAFSA data elements whenever possible.\n\nSeveral changes to the 2024-25 FAFSA described above may impact a school’s ability to complete the institutional awarding and packaging process. Examples include removal of the housing question, removal of the ability for independent students to elect to provide parent information (including financial information), and removal of the question asking the student whether they are interested in work study. An institution may separately ask students to indicate a choice (e.g., clarify their housing plans to produce a more accurate COA) but may not require this information as a condition of awarding or disbursing federal student aid.\n\nThe Act makes several significant changes to the process for determining the amount of a student’s Scheduled Award and disbursement amounts.\n\nPell Grant Formulas 1-5 used to determine a student’s Pell Grant payment amount were not changed. However, as described below, the enrollment status step within the Pell Grant Formulas will now use an enrollment intensity formula where appropriate. The law changed the Scheduled and Annual Pell Grant Award calculations, which we describe below. Additional details, including examples of payment schedule calculations for each Pell Formula, are available in the 2024-25 Draft Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility Guide.\n\nNote that the Department’s regulations for the Pell Grant program currently make reference to enrollment status. Until the Pell regulations are corrected, schools should interpret any reference to enrollment status in those regulations to mean enrollment intensity.\n\nEnrollment intensity is the percentage of full-time enrollment at which a student is enrolled, rounded to the nearest whole percent. For example, if full-time enrollment is 12 or more credit hours and the student is enrolled in 7 hours, the enrollment intensity would be (7 ÷ 12) × 100% = 58%. For the 2024-25 award year and thereafter, a student’s Scheduled Pell Grant award is multiplied by the student’s enrollment intensity percentage to determine the Annual Pell Grant Award. Though a student’s enrollment may exceed full-time enrollment, as defined by the school, enrollment intensity cannot exceed 100% for Pell Grant adjustment purposes. Please note that students enrolled in clock-hour or nonterm credit-hour programs are still always considered to be enrolled full-time for Pell Grant awarding purposes and, therefore, will always have an enrollment intensity of 100% when calculating Pell Grant amounts within Formula 4.\n\nPlease note that if an institution awards credits in decimals (e.g., 7.5 credits, 10.5 credits) the institution must incorporate the partial credits that it awards into the enrollment intensity formula (e.g., (7.5 ÷ 12) x 100% = 63%).\n\nThe Department of Defense is no longer able to provide confirmation that a service member killed in the line of duty meets the revised special eligibility criteria after the 2023-24 award year. Further, no comprehensive database exists to identify public safety officers killed in the line of duty. Therefore, students will self-identify potential eligibility on the FAFSA®, and the school will be required to verify eligibility by collecting supporting documentation from the student. Schools will report Special Rule eligibility to the Department using the new FAFSA Partner Portal (formerly FAA Access to CPS Online) to generate an ISIR transaction reflecting the student’s eligibility. Schools will award eligible students Max Pell, regardless of SAI. Other aid for these students will be based on their calculated SAI.\n\nSchools will be able to continue awarding funds to students who meet the current IASG or CFH criteria in the new FAFSA Partner Portal. For more information and resources regarding the IASG and CFH process, please review OPE’s Q&As about FAFSA Simplification on the OPE website.\n\nWe recognize that the Act changes foundational aspects of how institutions calculate, award, and disburse federal student aid. We commit to providing resources needed to update institutional policies and procedures, train staff, and prepare students for the changes.\n\nAs described above, the Department has already published (and will continue to update) the 2024-25 Draft Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility Guide, which includes a detailed explanation of the proposed process for calculating SAI and determining eligibility for Federal Pell Grants starting with the 2024-25 Award Year. We have also published the 2024–25 Draft FAFSA Specifications Guide, which consolidates all FAFSA-related processing information and guidance into a new, multi-volume resource. Finally, OPE has published Q&As on the OPE website and plans to continue updating those Q&As as they receive additional questions from the community.\n\nThese and other resources are available on the FAFSA Simplification Information page on Federal Student Aid’s Knowledge Center. To further assist the community with implementation of the FAFSA Simplification changes, the Department will provide additional operational guidance and technical resources in the near future.\n\nYou may refer additional questions to the Department using the Contact Customer Support form in FSA’s Partner Connect Help Center. To submit a question, please enter your name, email address, topic, and question. When submitting a question related to this DCL, please select the topic “FSA Ask-A-FED/Policy.”\n\nWe appreciate your continued partnership as we implement these changes."
