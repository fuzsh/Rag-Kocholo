        "text": "Summary\n\nCurrently, 34 states, territories and districts have minimum wages above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.\n\nFive states have not adopted a state minimum wage: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee. Two states, Georgia and Wyoming, have a minimum wage below $7.25 per hour. In all seven of these states, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour applies.\n\nState Minimum Wages\n\nThe table below reflects current state minimum wages in effect as of April 9, 2024, as well as future enacted increases. This table does not reflect industry specific and prevailing wages.\n\nNotes\n\n1 American Samoa: The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-28) sets minimum wage rates within American Samoa and provides for additional increases in the minimum wage of $0.50 per hour each year on May 25, until reaching the minimum wage generally applicable in the United States. The wage rates are set for particular industries, not for an employee's particular occupation. The rates are minimum rates; an employer may choose to pay an employee at a rate higher than the rate(s) for its industry.\n\n2 Connecticut: The Connecticut minimum wage rate automatically increases to 1/2 of 1 percent above the rate set in the Fair Labor Standards Act if the Federal minimum wage rate equals or becomes higher than the State minimum.\n\n3 The Massachusetts minimum wage rate automatically increases to 10 cents above the rate set in the Fair Labor Standards Act if the Federal minimum wage equals or becomes higher than the State minimum.\n\n4Minnesota: For large employers, with an annual sales volume of $500,000 or more, the minimum wage is currently $10.50; for small employers, those with an annual sales volume of less than $500,000, the minimum wage is $8.85.\n\n5Missouri - In addition to the exemption for federally covered employment, the law exempts, among others, employees of a retail or service business with gross annual sales or business done of less than $500,000.\n\n6 Montana: Employers with annual sales of less than $110,000 may pay $4.00 an hour.\n\n7 New Jersey: For small employers (six employees or fewer), the schedule of increases is as follows: $13.50 eff. 1-1-24; $14.30 eff. 1-1-25; $15.00 eff. 1-1-26.\n\n8 New York: The new minimum wage varies across the state based on geographical location and, in New York City, employer size.\n\n9 Ohio: Employers with annuals receipts less than $385,000 annually may pay $7.25 an hour\n\n10 Oklahoma: Employers of ten or more full-time employees at any one location and employers with annual gross sales over $100,000 irrespective of number of full-time employees are subject to federal minimum wage; all others are subject to state minimum wage of $2.00 (OK ST T. 40 ยง 197.5).\n\n11 Oregon: In addition to the new standard minimum wage rate, SB 1532 sets out a higher rate for employers located in the urban growth boundary, and a lower rate for employers located in nonurban counties. Employers in the urban growth boundary must pay $1.25 above the standard minimum wage and employers in nonurban counties can pay $1 less than the standard minimum wage.\n\n12 Puerto Rico: Employers covered by the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) are subject to the Federal minimum wage of $7.25. Employers not covered by the FLSA will be subject to a minimum wage that is at least 70 percent of the Federal minimum wage or the applicable mandatory decree rate of $5.08, whichever is higher. The Secretary of Labor and Human Resources may authorize a rate based on a lower percentage for any employer who can show that implementation of the 70 percent rate would substantially curtail employment in that business.\n\nOther Exceptions"
