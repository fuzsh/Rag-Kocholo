        "text": "Welcome to Wichita Public Schools!\n\nWe are so glad you've chosen to join the WPS family. Please select the appropriate button below to begin your enrollment process.\n\nOnline enrollment for the 2024-25 school year is available for grades 1-12 starting July 8, 2024. In-person enrollment for the 2024-25 school year is July 29 - 30, 12 - 7 p.m. All kindergarten families need to enroll in person. There is an additional Ages & Stages Questionnaire all kindergarten students need to complete to pinpoint developmental progress.\n\nIf you are a returning parent and forgot your ParentVUE account or password, please use the password reset button on the homepage of ParentVUE. If that doesn't work, contact our Help Desk at 973-4357.\n\nThe first day of school for the 24-25 school year is Wednesday, August 14, 2024. NEW THIS YEAR: Half-day orientation for all new middle and high school students on Tuesday, August 13.\n\nAll families are encouraged to complete and submit the Application for Free and Reduced Price School Meals form and qualify in order to receive free or reduced priced meals, as well as free or reduced prices on textbook rentals, athletic fees, instrument rentals and student fees. Parents can apply through LINQ Connect (formerly Titan), using their Titan log in and password.\n\nFamilies interested in enrolling students for pre-kindergarten should go to the pre-K page to complete an interest form.\n\nDoes your student show listed at an incorrect school on ParentVUE due to a change of home address? Online enrollment can be completed regardless of whether the student shows the correct school. After completion of online enrollment, please contact the school staff at your child’s new school. Upon presentation of proof of address, the school staff will change your child’s school in the district's system.\n\nProof of Address – During online enrollment, parents can upload documents that verify home address or bring them to their child's school. This could include a rental receipt, lease agreement, gas/electric bill or a mortgage payment stub."
