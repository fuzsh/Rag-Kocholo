Van Dyke's \"Half-a-Dollar Bill\" (1924) and Hoot Gibson's \"The Phantom Bullet\" (1926). Bold and nice \"Stay away from all the / 'Eves' --.-- they are full / of apple-sauce / Curtis Benton / K.N.X.\" on a beige 6\" X 3 3/4\" autograph album leaf, n.p., n.y. Though place and date not indicated, this was obtained by noted collector Preston Sawyer (1899-1968), California journalist and historical writer, in San Francisco around 1930. Benton went into radio announcing after talkies took over from silent films, so \"K.N.X.\" is likely a radio station reference. Item #25825"
