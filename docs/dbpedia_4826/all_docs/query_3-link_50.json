        "text": "There are substantial differences in lifetime earnings by educational attainment\n\nMen with bachelor's degrees earn approximately $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates. Women with bachelor's degrees earn $630,000 more. Men with graduate degrees earn $1.5 million more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates. Women with graduate degrees earn $1.1 million more.\n\nAfter controlling for key socio-demographic variables that influence earnings and the probability of college completion, the differences in lifetime earnings by educational attainment are reduced, but still substantial\n\nRegression estimates show that men with bachelor's degrees would earn $655,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates. Women with a bachelor's degrees would earn $450,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates.\n\nWe also measure the lifetime returns of educational attainment using the discounted present dollar value\n\nApplying a 4 percent annual real discount rate, the net present lifetime value at age 20 of a bachelor's degree relative to a high school diploma is $260,000 for men and $180,000 for women. For those with a graduate degree, it is $400,000 for men and $310,000 for women.\n\nOverall, these findings confirm the significant long-term economic benefits associated with college education.\n\nEstimated lifetime earnings by educational attainment (in millions of dollars)\n\nShow as table\n\nTable equivalent for chart: Estimated lifetime earnings by educational attainment (in millions of dollars) Educational attainment Men Women Gross (without controls) Net (with controls) Gross (without controls) Net (with controls) Less than high school 1.13 1.18 0.51 0.59 High school graduate 1.54 1.53 0.80 0.87 Some college 1.76 1.7 1.01 1.04 Bachelor's degree 2.43 2.19 1.43 1.32 Graduate degree 3.05 2.68 1.86 1.69\n\nSOURCE: Tamborini, Christopher R., ChangHwan Kim, and Arthur Sakamoto. 2015. “Education and Lifetime Earnings in the United States.” Demography 52: 1383–1407.\n\nNOTES: Results are based on median regression using data from the 2004 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and longitudinal records from the Social Security Administration.\n\nAll content is simplified for presentation.
