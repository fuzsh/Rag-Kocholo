        "text": "Two lawmakers who were against state-funded school vouchers were defeated in Republican primaries last Thursday. But in what could become a critical loss, incumbent Senate Education Chairman Jon Lundberg ― who sponsored Gov. Bill Lee's voucher legislation this year ― was defeated by Donald Trump-endorsed anti-voucher candidate Bobby Harshbarger.\n\nAs the primaries unfolded, several races for Tennessee state Senate became referendums on the issue of state-funded private school vouchers, with out-of-state groups pouring millions into key state legislative races.\n\nLongtime incumbent Frank Niceley was ousted following an aggressive ad blitz from pro-voucher PAC School Freedom Fund, which attacked Niceley as \"liberal with our money.\" The same PAC bought ads attacking Rep. Bryan Richey, who sought an open seat vacated by retiring Sen. Art Swann. Pro-voucher candidate Tom Hatcher won that primary.\n\nBut despite nearly $200,000 spent by outside groups to support Lundberg in his hotly contested race against Harshbarger, a pharmacist from Kingsport who is son of U.S. Rep. Diana Harshbarger, a Trump endorsement, and support from a PAC that shares a treasurer with his mother's congressional campaign, pushed Harshbarger to the finish line. He opposes vouchers.\n\nSenate Speaker Pro Tempore Ferrell Haile successfully defended his seat in a challenge from the right from Chris Spencer, who accused Haile of being \"anti-child.\"\n\nHere's a look at the other competitive state Senate primaries in Thursday's election.\n\nTennessee state Senate District 4\n\nIn one of the most closely watched state Senate races this year in District 4, incumbent Sen. Jon Lundberg fell behind Thursday evening and was defeated by challenger Bobby Harshbarger in the Republican primary. Harshbarger was endorsed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nLundberg was chair of the Senate Education Committee and had served in the legislature since 2006. He was the sponsor of Gov. Bill Lee's statewide universal school voucher program this year and a vocal advocate for school choice policies.\n\nHarshbarger is the son of U.S. Rep. Diana Harshbarger, R-Kingsport, and a pharmacist and small business owner from Sullivan County. Harshbarger earned the endorsement of former President Donald Trump shortly before an assassination attempt last month. Harshbarger is the subject of a complaint with the Tennessee Registry of Election Finance alleging coordination with political action committee East Tennessee Conservatives PAC, which sent text messages attacking Lundberg. The PAC shares a treasurer with Congresswoman Harshbarger's campaign.\n\nThe district includes Hawkins and Sullivan counties in upper East Tennessee.\n\nTennessee state Senate District 18\n\nTennessee Senate Speaker Pro Tempore Ferrell Haile, R-Gallatin, fended off a primary challenge from the right in Republican Chris Spencer, who racked up endorsements as a \"true constitutional conservative Republican.\" Haile comfortably defeated Spencer on Thursday.\n\nHaile raised a hefty war chest to fund his re-election bid and defend against Spencer, who earned endorsements from singer-songwriter John Rich, women's sports activist Riley Gaines and Nashville auto magnate Lee Beaman. Spencer pledged to support anti-abortion legislation, work with the Tennessee Firearms Association on gun policies, vet school curriculums for \"leftist propaganda and inappropriate sexualization of our children,\" and support funding for better teacher and support staff pay.\n\nFacing Spencer's accusations of being \"anti-child,\" Haile pointed to his record sponsoring legislation to establish Tennessee's Safe Baby Courts, which seek to smooth transitions for adoptive families, and supporting legislation to ban medical and surgical gender transition for minors, and to prohibit transgender children from participating in sports that do not align with their gender assigned at birth. Haile supports expanding access to publicly funded private school vouchers.\n\nHaile will face Democrat Walter Chandler, of Hendersonville, in November. Chandler is an aerospace engineer with experience at Belcan and Boeing. His legislative priorities include expanding Medicaid, gun reform, expanding pre-K and opposing private school vouchers.\n\nThe district includes Sumner and Trousdale counties.\n\nTennessee state Senate District 2\n\nIn a race that became a referendum on state-funded school vouchers, pro-voucher candidate Tom Hatcher won the open Republican primary for state Senate District 2, defeating state Rep. Bryan Richey and businessman John Pullias.\n\nRichey, a Navy veteran who has served in the Tennessee House of Representatives, succumbed to an onslaught of hundreds of thousands of dollars in opposing ads bought by the School Freedom Fund, which criticized him as a \"soft on crime liberal.\" The PAC is affiliated with the Club for Growth and poured $3.6 million into five Tennessee legislative races attacking candidates who oppose publicly funded school voucher programs.\n\nHatcher is a Blount County native who served as Blount County Circuit Court Clerk for 30 years. He was also previously a Blount County Sheriff’s Deputy. He now faces Democrat Patti Young, a retired Maryville City Schools teacher who operates a small equestrian facility and summer camp in Blount County.\n\nThe district includes Blount, Monroe, Polk and part of Bradley counties in East Tennessee. The seat is open following the retirement of state Sen. Art Swann, R-Maryville.\n\nTennessee state Senate District 6\n\nIncumbent Sen. Becky Duncan Massey, R-Knoxville, defeated a challenge from the right by Monica Irvine in the Republican primary for Senate District 6.\n\nMassey, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, will now face Democrat Dominica Bryan in the November general election. Massey cosponsored Lee's school voucher proposal this year. Bryan is a longtime investigator with the Tennessee Department of Children's Services.\n\nThe district includes part of Knox County.\n\nTennessee state Senate District 8\n\nIn another race that turned into a referendum on state-funded school vouchers, longtime incumbent Sen. Frank Niceley, R-Strawberry Plains, was ousted in an expensive race for state Senate District 8 by Republican challenger Jessie Seal.\n\nNiceley is a farmer and businessman who has represented the district since 2012 and previously served six terms in the state House of Representatives. Niceley was another target in the School Freedom Fund's negative ad blitz, attacked for opposing publicly funded school voucher programs.\n\nSeal, of Claiborne County, is a public relations director for a medical facility and an officer in the Claiborne County Republican Party.\n\nSeal now faces Democrat R.E. Ellison in the November election. Ellison, a retired computer science professional, ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.\n\nThe district includes Claiborne, Grainger, Hancock, Jefferson, Sevier and Union counties in East Tennessee.\n\nTennessee state Senate District 10\n\nSen. Todd Gardenhire, R-Chattanooga, handily fended off a primary challenge from former Red Bank city commissioner Ed LeCompte. Gardenhire has represented the district since 2013 and is currently chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nGardenhire will now face Democrat Missy Crutchfield of Chattanooga in the November election. Crutchfield, an activist and co-editor of Be Magazine, unsuccessfully ran for Hamilton County School Board earlier this year. She is the daughter of Ward Crutchfield, who previously held Gardenhire's seat.\n\nThe district includes includes Bledsoe, Hamilton, Marion and Sequatchie counties in Southeast Tennessee.\n\nTennessee state Senate District 12: Yager will now face Roane State student\n\nIncumbent Sen. Ken Yager, R-Kingston, won the Republican primary in Senate District 12, defeating Teena Hedrick, a retired nurse practitioner from Roane County. Yager is chair of the Senate Republican Caucus and has represented the district since 2006. Yager was a teacher in Harriman City Schools and later served as county attorney and county executive.\n\nYager now faces Democrat Curtis Kelly of Clarkrange in the Nov. 5 election. Kelly, a student at Roane State Community College, ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.\n\nThe district includes includes Campbell, Clay, Fentress, Macon, Morgan, Overton, Pickett, Roane and Scott counties. Yager beat Hedrick in all of the counties. Locally, here's The Associated Press tally of their vote totals in Roane and Morgan:\n\nRoane County - 4,264 for Yager, 2,080 for Hedrick\n\nMorgan County - 1,689 for Yager, 410 for Hedrick\n\nTotal votes - 15,654 or 77.3% for Yager, 4,587 or 22.7% for Hedrick\n\nKelly was unopposed, so The Associated Press did not report the candidate's vote total.\n\nTennessee state Senate District 24\n\nIncumbent Sen. John D. Stevens, R-Huntingdon, won the Republican primary in Senate District 24, defeating Charlies \"Charlie\" Cooper, an Army veteran who is the budget administrator and public relations director for Benton County government.\n\nStevens is a lawyer from Huntingdon who has represented District 24 since 2012.\n\nThe district includes Benton, Carrol, Gibson, Henry, Houston, Obion, Stewart and Weakley counties in Middle and West Tennessee.\n\nTennessee state Senate District 30\n\nIncumbent Sen. Sara P. Kyle, D-Memphis, won the Democratic primary in Senate District 30, defeating Erika Stotts Pearson of Memphis. Kyle is an attorney who has been in the Tennessee Senate since 2015. She previously served as director of the Tennessee Regulatory Authority.\n\nThe district includes part of Shelby County.\n\nThe Oak Ridger's news editor Donna Smith contributed to this story."
