        "text": "Banknotes featuring the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, will remain legal tender, and can continue to be used. There is no need to exchange current banknotes for the new King Charles III notes.\n\nThe Bank’s counter at our Threadneedle Street building will only issue Queen Elizabeth II banknotes.\n\nThe temporary postal exchange service for obtaining the new banknotes is now closed.\n\nFor those who used our postal exchange service before the deadline, please allow up to 8 weeks for your application to be processed before contacting us. This is due to the large volume of applications for King Charles III banknotes that were received.\n\nThere is no limit on the total amount of banknotes you can exchange. You may need to fill in one of our forms or provide photo identification (ID) and proof of address.\n\nFind out what you need to do in Exchanging banknotes by post or Exchanging banknotes in person on our website.\n\nContact the police if you suspect a note is counterfeit. They will give you a receipt and send the note to us for analysis. If the police tell you the note is not required to support a criminal investigation, you can take it to your bank as a suspect counterfeit. If it is genuine, you will be reimbursed.\n\nIf you are a retailer or business, see the Banknote Checking Scheme section on our website for advice on what to do with counterfeit notes.\n\nEach banknote denomination is a different size. The higher the value of a note, the larger it is.\n\nOn the front of the notes (the side with raised print), the value can be identified by the number of clusters of raised dots in the top left corner. The £5 has none, the £10 has two, the £20 has three and the £50 has four clusters.\n\nWhilst polymer notes are more durable, they are not indestructible. Over time they will be subject to wear, which can include damage to the foil. As part of the banknote lifecycle, worn banknotes are eventually removed from circulation and replaced with new notes. We remove hundreds of millions of worn banknotes from circulation every year.\n\nIf your note is heavily damaged we will exchange it for a new note.\n\nThe words ‘I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of five/ten/twenty/fifty pounds’ appear on all of our notes. This phrase dates from long ago when our notes represented deposits of gold. At that time, a member of the public could exchange one of our banknotes for gold of the same value. For example, a £5 note could be exchanged for five gold coins, called sovereigns.\n\nHowever, the value of the pound has not been linked to gold for many years, so the meaning of the promise to pay has changed. You can no longer exchange banknotes for gold. You can only exchange them for other Bank of England banknotes of the same face value.\n\nHM Queen Elizabeth II or (by mid-2024) HM King Charles III will always be on the front of our notes. But when we issue a new banknote, the Banknote Character Advisory Committee chooses a field to celebrate on the note and we invite the public to nominate who they think should appear on it. We call the people on the back of our notes ‘characters’. Then, our Banknote Character Advisory Committee creates a shortlist and presents it to our Governor, who makes the final choice.\n\nWe produced banknotes shortly after we were founded in 1694. You can see examples of every note we’ve ever made in the online collections from our museum.\n\nThe museum also has artwork by banknote designers, machinery and equipment relating to banknote production and examples of counterfeit and imitation notes. It is the largest collection of Bank of England notes and associated material in the world.\n\nIn 2016 we issued our first banknote made of polymer: a thin, flexible plastic material. The polymer used in our banknotes is polypropylene, which is formed into a durable yet lightweight plastic film. It is coated with layers of special ink, which carry the printed design of a banknote. The polymer material allows us to include ‘windows’ or clear sections in the design, which makes them harder to counterfeit.\n\nThe material for our withdrawn, paper banknotes was made by a specialist paper manufacturer. Most paper is made out of wood pulp, but the paper we used for our banknotes was manufactured from cotton.\n\nSince 2011, we have recycled most of our old paper banknotes. They are either used to create a soil improver or processed at a local energy recovery facility to generate electricity.\n\nAs composting is not suitable for polymer notes, we commissioned an independent third-party to conduct a lifecycle study assessing the environmental impacts of different waste treatment options. The study used international standards (ISO 14040:2006 and 14044:2006) for the assessment and it was externally reviewed by a panel of industry experts. Recycling was the most favourable option. As a result, we have secured a UK-based recycling solution, which will see polymer banknotes turned into pellets before being transformed into new plastic items such as plant pots.\n\nIn 2016, we found out there is a trace of animal-derived product in our £5 polymer notes. Our investigation discovered that a tiny amount of tallow (less than one part per thousand) is used in an early stage of the production process of polymer pellets. These pellets are used to create the base substrate for our polymer notes.\n\nWe did not know about this issue when we signed the contract for our polymer supply. During our research, we found out that many household goods use animal-derived additives. For example, cosmetics, plastic carrier bags and household detergent bottles. They are also commonly used to make plastics for other payment methods, eg debit and credit cards and mobile phones.\n\nThe only currently viable alternative for polymer notes is to use chemicals ultimately derived from palm oil. We asked the public what they thought about both of these options in a full public consultation. We provided a range of relevant information, including outreach and discussions with potentially affected groups.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we decided not to change the composition of polymer we use for our banknotes. Some of the important issues we considered thoroughly were:\n\nour responsibility to issue and maintain the supply of high quality and secure banknotes.\n\nour obligations under the Equality Act 2010.\n\nconcerns about the use of animal-derived products.\n\nYou can read more about our decision on the composition of polymer banknotes.\n\nCash-handling machines will need to be adapted for the new banknotes. This includes self service checkouts, ATMs, ticket machines and any other machine that weighs, counts, sorts, accepts, dispenses or recycles banknotes.\n\nThis will likely require a software update, which is normal practice when a new banknote design is issued. Additional hardware upgrades may be required for some machines because of the change to a new material and the reduction in banknote size.\n\nIf your business uses cash-handling machines, you should engage directly with the machine manufacturer to discuss what adaptations will be required. Before purchasing a new machine, you should ask if it is compatible with the new banknotes.\n\nWe have a list of machine manufacturers that have been offered access to test banknotes. If your manufacturer is not listed, please let us know at cashindustry.enquiries@bankofengland.co.uk."
