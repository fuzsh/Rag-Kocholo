        "text": "On March 8, 1965, I went to Philadelphia to watch Princeton play Penn State in the opening round of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament. As the two teams were warming up, a contact lens fell to the court from the eye of a Princeton player. He bent over to pick it up but couldn’t see it. Teammates stopped their drills and came to help. They got down on their hands and knees and grovelled, crawled like bugs. Some went completely prone and squinted down along the floorboards. No one saw the lens. Princeton’s Bill Bradley, who happened to be on the sideline talking to his coach, watched with a curiosity that evolved toward impatience as five minutes went by. People in the stands were clapping in unison. Bradley had enough. Leaving the sideline, he walked to mid-court, stopped, bent forward, and pointed at the lens.\n\nFocus like that is an obvious asset in the central vision of a basketball player, and so is peripheral vision, which adds so much to court sense. When Bill was in high school, in Crystal City, Missouri, he would walk down the streets with blinders on his eyes to see if he could read the signs in shopwindows on either side. Nonsense? Court sense. In early December of his senior year at Princeton, I persuaded him to go with me to an ophthalmologist, who plotted his peripheral vision within circles on a graph, and we found that Bill could see as much as twenty-three degrees more than most people. Bill could practically see out the back of his head, let alone a bit of plastic on a floor.\n\nI described these optical scenes in a New Yorker Profile in January, 1965. Princeton went to the Final Four that season, an extracurricular distraction that left Bradley with an intensified deadline for his senior thesis. He was a history major, and his subject—for which he had completed all interviews and other research—was Harry Truman’s second senatorial campaign. Back in Princeton from the Final Four, where he had scored fifty-eight points in his last college game, he was getting so much press attention that he needed a place to hide, a place to write. He hid for a couple of weeks in my house. My wife and I had gone to Florida to begin the research for a piece on oranges, and our children went off with grandparents. We lived in a rural setting. Bill, alone, spooked in the night, heard ghosts. Goblins. Ghouls. Writing day and night about Harry Truman, he sat at my typing table. There was a rug of great value beneath the table. Wearing shoes with sharp leather heels, as nervous as a professional writer, he fidgeted with his feet, scuffing as he wrote, and destroyed the rug, leaving behind a bundle of Persian shreds.\n\nI had not met him until 1964, although I had watched him since he was a freshman, when he set some sort of record by making fifty-seven consecutive free throws. As a junior, he agreed to the New Yorker piece, although he wondered why I wasn’t doing it for Time, where I was employed. He spent a large part of that summer in Princeton, reading for his thesis, and he was also in the gym a lot, often just with me feeding basketballs to him, as he kept his edge for the upcoming Tokyo Olympic Games. When he went home to Crystal City, I went with him. His mother put me in a bedroom that looked out on Taylor Avenue and Grace Presbyterian Church, their church. We ran a couple of miles each day on a high-school track. And one day we went to Don Bosco, a basketball camp ten miles west, where Bill introduced me to Ed Macauley.\n\nMacauley ran the camp and Bradley was a featured guest. Macauley had also worked for the St. Louis Hawks, as their star center, and had been an All-American at Saint Louis University. He was known as Easy Ed, for the time it took him to come up the floor. While his teammates ran a fast break, he trailed them almost at a walk. Easy Ed was six feet eight, Bill six-five. Nineteen years later, I accompanied Bill on a campaign visit to the boardwalk in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, where he bucked the currents of a human river behind a sign that read “MEET SENATOR BRADLEY.” One potential voter he met said, “Man, are you tall. You looked small when you played for the Knicks.”\n\n“I was small when I played for the Knicks,” the Senator said. Right enough. He was the small forward. And now, in 1964, at Camp Don Bosco, in Missouri, I was walking up a dirt road with Bill Bradley and Ed Macauley. The road consisted of deep parallel ruts with a grassy hump in the middle. Bradley was in one rut, Macauley in the other, and I was up on the hump between them. I am smaller than most people—about as small as Andrew Carnegie, James Madison, Vladimir Putin, Joseph Stalin, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Actually, I was five feet seven at my zenith and have lately condensed. The hump was a good foot higher than the ruts. Nonetheless, the three of us in outline formed the letter M.\n\nBill spent the early days of his senior year in Tokyo, winning a gold medal. Other Princeton people were there, too—Lesley Bush, a platform diver, who was in her fourth year at Princeton High School; Jed Graef, a backstroker, who had just graduated from the university; and my father, the head physician for the U.S. team. All three athletes were gold medallists. There was withal a matter of yen. If athletes wanted to watch competition in a sport other than their own, they had to pay to get in. Jed wanted to watch the basketball. Bill found a spare equipment bag, added some costume touches, and marched Jed into the arena as a member of the American team. At this point in this narrative, I cannot resist flashing forward to 2003, when Jed’s daughter Dana was a sophomore in my Princeton writing class. One of her essays was about her childhood in western New York. Her mother is a Buddhist priest. Dana said in the essay:\n\nI played in the snow, cut tulips from our neighbors’ yard, and stole cookies year round. I ate crepes for Easter, latkes for Channukah, and chocolate almost every day. I hid our guests’ keys when I wanted them to stay, and rode home from preschool on my father’s shoulders. I wore a white lace dress for my mother’s ordination, a gray satin dress for her sanctioning, and a green dress for my father’s inauguration into the Swimming Hall of Fame.\n\nWhen Bill Bradley was young, his mother signed him up for enough swimming lessons to improve a bluefin tuna. She was an athlete, a golf-club champion. Bill never took to golf. Tennis lessons produced neither an overhead nor a backhand down the line. But he was somewhat impressed by his competence as a swimmer. For seven years in the nineteen-seventies, my family spent July at a house beside a lake in northern New Hampshire. Actually, we were two merged families, with lots of kids, but we had enough canoes and Rangeley boats to go around. When Bill and his wife, Ernestine, first visited us there, Bill stepped off the dock and into a canoe. He chose a place quite close to one end of the canoe. The other end shot up into the air, pointed at the sky, while Bill’s end penetrated the lake with him in it. I had never heard him mention canoeing lessons. This was in the middle of his ten years as a Knick. The next summer, he announced on arrival that ABC, for its program “The Superstars,” had invited him to Florida with other professional athletes to compete in various sports other than their own. Bill would be competing as a swimmer. So he wanted to take advantage of our lake to prepare to race on television. I had competed in swimming only as a boy at summer camp, but I didn’t lose a race in ten years. For what else it may be worth, I had also been an American Red Cross water-safety instructor during summers in my college years.\n\nI gestured toward a diving raft that was forty or fifty yards from the dock. I said I would be pleased to help him train for television and would race him from the dock to the raft. The look on his face was not exactly contemptuous; it would be interpretive to call it a smirk. There was some of that, but mainly he was concealing amusement, and doing his best not to be insulting, not even to seem indulgent. It was clear, though, that he thought my offer absurd.\n\nThree, two, one, go! When Bill reached the raft, I was waiting for him there. We had a telephone on the porch of the lakeside house. Bill swam back to the dock, climbed out, went to the telephone dripping, touched a bunch of buttons, got ABC on the phone, and cancelled his trip to Florida.\n\nIn fact, he was acting, pantomiming, faking a phone call to Florida. He was connected to no one at ABC or anywhere else. There is more clown in him than most people have had a chance to discern. He went to Florida, he was on the show, and he won something.\n\nThe swimming race was unimagined and ten years in the future when The New Yorker published my Profile of Bill Bradley. My participation in the process occurred in William Shawn’s office, where he had checking proofs, copy-editor proofs, and every other kind of proof, including his own, none of which he showed to me as he brought up point after point and discussed them with me. The New Yorker’s criterion was that the writer be satisfied, and in that criterion I was immersed for the first time.\n\nAs I wrote in 2017 in my book “Draft No. 4”:\n\nShawn edited the piece himself, as he routinely did with new writers of long fact, breaking them in, so to speak, but not exactly like a horse, more like a baseball mitt. For a week or so before the press date, we met each day and went through galleys from comma to comma, with an extra beat for a semicolon. . . . Now and again, Mr. Shawn said things that were most encouraging to a fretful, not to say neurotic, unconfident writer. He had had a lot of practice.\n\nHe made me feel entirely comfortable in his presence, so comfortable that when the Daily Princetonian published its annual Joke Issue two days after The New Yorker published the Bradley Profile, I took a copy of the Joke Issue to West Forty-third Street to show to Mr. Shawn. A big, bold, wall-to-wall headline said:\n\nBRADLEY BOOTED-OUT!\n\nOlympian Took Dope,\n\nThrew Cornell Game\n\nA front-page sidebar contained the reaction of Harry Truman, a quote begun by chaste symbols—?!*%#—meant to suggest unprintable words. “I never did trust that boy,” Harry said. Elsewhere on the front page was a photograph of Grant Wood’s “American Gothic,” under the words “Parents Receive News Stoically.” Without explanation, I handed the Joke Issue to Shawn, thinking that he would get it immediately and laugh. He didn’t get it, and he didn’t laugh. His face reddened. He looked stricken. I spluttered explanation. I wasn’t ninety-two then, as I am at this writing. I was thirty-three going on thirteen. I desperately hoped to join the New Yorker staff. This, in a crowded field, is the dumbest thing I ever did.\n\nWhen Bill was at Oxford, studying P.P.E. (Politics, Philosophy, and Economics) as a Rhodes Scholar, he not only played basketball for the university but also flew to Italy to play professionally for a Milanese meatpacker called Simmenthal. In his second Oxford year, he wrote to me asking that I go to Trenton and buy from the state government a book titled “New Jersey Civil Practice Laws and Rules.” I sent it to Oxford. Widely predicted to be a future governor of Missouri, Bill was weaving the first threads of a carpetbag.\n\nThe Knicks had drafted him, and after he returned from Oxford, in 1967, he had his first tryout with the team, at the Knicks’ training center, in Farmingdale, on Long Island. Red Holzman, the coach, studied Bill in the company of the team’s best players, among them Dick Barnett, Walt Frazier, and Willis Reed. Willis, six-ten, was the Knickerbockers’ franchise player, the team captain, its leading scorer. Like planets, the others orbited around him. And off they went in full-court scrimmage in Farmingdale. Bill was an exceptional passer, a pinpoint passer, but his first pass to Willis connected with nothing and bounced away, hitting the base of the empty stands. A minute or two later, after Willis set a pick, as he had before, Bill ran his defender into the pick, again expecting Willis to roll suddenly away from his defender, coming open for a bounce pass, in this classic set piece of basketball. Again, the pass went bouncing off on its own. Holzman blew his whistle and stepped onto the court to tell Bill, “Willis doesn’t roll.”\n\nThis flat statement made a deep entry into the comic wit of Robert Bingham, the New Yorker fact editor to whom Mr. Shawn assigned me after my first two Profiles. Bingham was my editor for sixteen years, before he died, in his fifties. He dragged my confidence past numerous barriers, and he treated my manuscripts as if they were mine, looking up now and again from some hot-dog line I’d written and saying, “Willis doesn’t roll.”\n\nBill, meanwhile, got off to a slow, discouraging start with the Knicks, not getting much game time, and even being booed in Madison Square Garden because of irrationally high expectations, not to mention a widespread skepticism prompted by the size of his signing bonus, for which he had been given the nickname Dollar Bill. I had admired him and what I heard about him since he was a freshman in college, and he would become a friend forever, but there would be no era in which I thought more highly of him than when he was struggling to make it with the Knicks, playing three minutes a game, or something of the kind, and surely feeling the threat of a depression the like of which he’d never experienced.\n\nAfter basketball games in the Garden, he would go to dinner and the basketball did not go with him. His best asset, I had long thought, was his ability to compartmentalize the factors in his life, and never let his concentration on one thing spill over into others. When he went to dinner, with a variety of people, he dwelt on subjects that had nothing to do with his job. He was like that then, and he is like that now.\n\nBy February, 1969, he was faring better. When the Knicks showed up in Milwaukee to play the Bucks, I happened to be nearby, spending a week as a writer-in-residence at Lake Forest Academy, in Illinois. I went to the game. The Knicks won. Bill had a standout game, and was confronted afterward by a man with a microphone asking for his pithiest analysis of the contest. Stepping into this cliché encounter, Bill took the microphone and analyzed the action, then reanalyzed the action, and gave a third and a fourth analysis, and was not about to give back the microphone. Changing the subject, he talked on, and on, and on, until the TV control room threw a switch.\n\nOn Christmas Eve that year, in a New York movie theatre where continuous screenings ran far into the night, Bill stayed up late with me, watching Robert Redford in “Downhill Racer.” Since early summer, my wife and I had been separated, and therefore came Christmas without my daughters. Apart from a family death, if there is a lower moment in a physically healthy life I can’t imagine it.\n\nThe Knicks’ season was in full flow. They beat the Detroit Pistons 112–111 that Christmas Day and lost to the Lakers the following night. They would see more of the Lakers and the Lakers would see more of them. The Lakers were Wilt Chamberlain. The Knicks were Dave DeBusschere, Bradley, Barnett, Frazier, and Captain Willis Reed. They were on a roll (but not that one). In May, they beat the Lakers in the N.B.A. finals. It was the Knicks’ first championship. They won their second, also against the Lakers, in 1973, and at this writing the Knicks have yet to win another.\n\nHis political ruminations notwithstanding, Bill thought about other futures, other professions, and one of these was photography. He bought a Nikon with multiple lenses and went at the challenge with the same dedication he had given to no-look passes and peripheral vision. One of his first artistic themes was life on the road, life on the run, the quotidian experience of a professional athlete, forever in airplanes, in unfamiliar cities, checking into and out of hotels. One example of this genre is on display in a fishing cabin owned by me and my family on the upper Delaware River. Made in Los Angeles, the picture is a point-blank view of a hotel under construction, shot from a room in a neighboring hotel so close that the picture shows no roofline or other defining edges, just twenty half-finished hotel rooms, full of building materials, and looking like a grotesque checkerboard, the itinerant athlete’s total view. DeBusschere, Bill’s roommate on the road, slept through most of that.\n\nFifty-eight years ago, I took an outdoor picture of Bill with our garage in the background. He was twenty-two. In more recent years, he has used that photograph in two of his books and in a long video he describes as “a performative autobiography.” In professional compensation, I have yet to see one red cent, let alone a dollar bill.\n\nBill had been a Knick for seven years when West Germany and the Netherlands reached the finals of the World Cup, in Munich. Bill was married now, and his wife—as smart a person as I have ever met, apart from nuclear scientists and geophysicists—had grown up Ernestine Misslbeck, in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, fifty miles from Munich. The Misslbecks wanted to attend the Cup final, a tough ticket if ever there was one. The match would occur on the seventh of July. Could Bill do something for his in-laws? He called the Milanese meatpacker he had played for when he was at Oxford. The company said it would obtain the tickets if Bill would fly to Italy and play one exhibition game for the meatpacker. He went.\n\nHe was elected a U.S. senator from New Jersey in 1978. His home was in Denville then, in Morris County. Earlier, when he had first planned to run for office in the state, I had sought and found a carpetbag, filled it up with New Jersey road maps, and given it to him. It hung on a peg high inside his front door for twenty years. It is now in the possession of Ernestine and Bill’s daughter, Theresa Anne. She is my goddaughter. When Bill was in his early Senate days and had not yet bought a house in Washington, he borrowed the apartment of Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron, who were somewhere else at the time. For a week or so, I was in Washington working on my geology project at the Smithsonian and at the U.S. Geological Survey, nearby in Virginia. I stayed with Bill. Coming through the door, you faced a curvilinear wall with an Italian bicycle hanging on it like a work of art, which it was. It was worth more than a car. And it was not the most arresting sight there. The apartment was filled with Pat and Dick Nixon figurines, a Pat salt shaker with a Dick pepper shaker, Pat and Dick ceramics of every ilk, five years after Deep Throat and Woodward and Bernstein’s reportage on Watergate.\n\nBill’s new presence in the Senate gave rise to a trivia question that lasted for eighteen years around Princeton. People with nothing better to do entertained one another with this question: What Princeton basketball player became a Rhodes Scholar and later a United States senator? Answer: Paul Sarbanes, Princeton 1954. Sarbanes, from Maryland, served in the U.S. Senate for thirty years, which included Bill Bradley’s eighteen.\n\nIn 1970, on vacation in Maine, Bill began writing a book he called “Life on the Run.” His ten-year career in pro basketball was still not far from its beginning, but his theme was clear to him and was in part the theme expressed in the photograph he made in the Los Angeles hotel. Since my own first book had been about Bill, it was assumed by some that I had had a hand in Bill’s first book. If you want to know the truth, he sent me the manuscript, asking me to vet it. I did, and wrote to him, saying, among other things, “Abandon the project, you’ll embarrass yourself.” He still has the letter. He claims that—twenty years after “Life on the Run”—I suggested that he abandon the manuscript of his third book, “Time Present, Time Past.” He has also stored in his memory, and conceivably his alone, some magazine’s list of “The 10 Best Sports Books of All Time.” “Life on the Run” was No. 4. “A Sense of Where You Are,” my book about him, No. 6. Not that it is relevant, but my book about him says, “He is everything his parents think he is.” Anybody with enough angst to destroy a rug while trying to write is a writer.\n\nWhen I was preparing this piece, Bill’s daughter surprised me with a letter I had written to Bill fifty-eight years ago—a few days before he graduated from Princeton:\n\nWe’ve spent so much time talking together that I’m going to miss it quite a bit. . . . There was always some sort of purpose, something to be accomplished . . . but the thing I learned that impressed me most was that, although your discipline is justly celebrated, you know how to waste time every bit as much as I do, which means that you’re a champion at it. For every hour in which something got done, two went out the window. The best two went out the window.\n\nAt Drake’s Corner Road, you will be missed by Laura, Sarah, and Jenny. . . . Martha will have to live down the disappointment of not having been old enough when you were here. Even the older children have no standards by which to judge you except what you’re like when you’re dealing with them, and all of them start acting as if Ringling Brothers is in town whenever you come up the driveway.\n\n. . . I hope that you will be coming up the driveway for years and years. Come to think of it, that is what we’re all going to miss most: the explosive sound of the tires biting into the red gravel; the after-burner cutting in when you reached the big poplar; and, as the car came into view, the impressionistic blur against the green of the trees; then, finally, the relieving sight of the arresting parachute opening out to the rear.\n\nWhen Yolanda Whitman and I were married, fifty-plus years ago now, the mayor of Princeton officiated on the Princeton campus. We were five in all, and the two others—the witnesses—were my mother and Bill. He is the younger brother I never had, and I am the brother he never had. “Bro” is how he has signed his e-mails to me since soon after e-mail was introduced. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the month in which the New York Knicks won the 1970 N.B.A. finals."
