        "text": "I am deeply honored that you have asked me to meet with you today on this occasion of such importance to the future of your profession, your State, and your nation. I come to you today as a refugee from a very exclusive public school known as the United States Senate. There the course of instruction is often difficult, the recesses all too rare and the recitation so lengthy that the entire class is frequently kept after school. There are, moreover, two major difficulties to this school on Capitol Hill: first, it is not always possible to tell the teachers from the students; and, secondly, while many mothers are clamoring to have their children admitted to the school, no student ever wants to graduate.\n\nThe State of Maryland has sent many distinguished sons to the United States Senate, many who deserve the title of \"Profiles in Courage\". I am reminded today of one in particular – one, I might add, who traced his ancestry back to Kings County, Ireland – whose long years of public stewardship included service in the Maryland Convention of 1776 that called for independence; in the Continental Congress where he signed the Declaration of Independence; in the Maryland Assembly and Senate; and as Maryland's first United States Senator. His name I'm sure you know – Charles Carroll of Carrollton. His example is one I hope you can inspire into your pupils – for though he entered public service at a time when his religion was a handicap and his great fortune an excuse for avoiding such tasks, his career was always marked by the greatest courage, the finest scholarship, and the highest integrity. Legend has it that he signed his name to the Declaration of Independence as Charles Carroll of Carrollton when it was suggested that King George might hang the wrong Charles Carroll by mistake. When the new nation, eager in its independence and bitter in its efforts to throw back the British troops, sought to confiscate British property during the war, Charles Carroll boldly opposed those measures which seemed to him as tyrannical as those from which the country was trying to escape. He had been elected to the Continental Congress on Independence Day itself – and when he died in 1832, he was revered throughout the nation as the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence and as a man of unusual ability and vision. Certainly he is one of the most distinguished alumni of our Senate school.\n\nBut however important a role the Senate may play in our national life, I think I can say without resorting to exaggeration that I feel privileged to be here today before one of the most influential gatherings in the country. Your influence is not in bombs or wealth or national fame; nor is it dependent upon political parties, pressure groups or sheer force of numbers. But the fact remains that you and your associates in the teaching profession will in the long run have more to say about the future of this country and the world than any of these – not on the battlefield, not in the council room, but in the classroom. We the people of America have entrusted into your hands the future leaders of this nation, the most powerful nation on earth – and the way in which you fulfill this trust, in the guidance and direction which you give to America's youth, will have a more profound effect on our national future than perhaps any decision we may make in the Senate.\n\nAll of you are familiar with the motto credited to Francis Bacon, but actually traceable back to ancient scriptures, that reads: \"Knowledge is power – Nam et ipsa scientia potestas est.\" No doubt that slogan has appeared on many a school or teachers' college bulletin board. But now this truism is truer than ever before, a statement that sums up volumes of prose about the Cold War. Which nation has the scientific personnel and know-how to develop the first so-called \"clean\" atomic bomb for tactical use – the first earth satellite – the first intercontinental ballistic missile? How long will the West retain its lead in productivity and living standards – to what extent can it export to its less wealthy friends the capital, the technical assistance, the skills and other knowledge they need? The answers to these questions over the long run are in your hands. We no longer complacently believe that the educational and scientific capabilities of this country cannot be duplicated elsewhere. We recognize that the race for advantage in the Cold War is not only a competition of armaments, production, ideology, propaganda, and diplomacy but a race of education and research as well.\n\nThe advantages which will enable the United States to win this race, however, whether they take the form of better proximity fuses or the new hybrid seed corns which recently won us friends behind the Iron Curtain will not instantly spring up in the hour they are required. There is a lag of from five to ten years between the results of fundamental research and the practical application of those results; before that research takes place, several years of training and experience are required: and even before that, the mind of the future scientist must be properly melded and stimulated by his elementary and secondary school teachers.\n\nRecent Soviet advancements – including the first earth satellite, an intercontinental ballistic missile, a new hydrogen explosion and others – all point up how critical this race has become. The Soviet Union already has available for this work more engineers and scientists than we presently have in any capacity in this country, and very nearly as many as this country and Western Europe combined. In recent years, the output of new engineers and scientists in the U.S.S.R. has surpassed that of the total United States and Western Europe graduating classes in these fields – their current enrollment of engineering and science students in institutions of higher education exceeds our own – and we are already falling far short of even our own current needs. Their lead may become even more serious, and in the most critical areas of technical knowledge within the next decade, according to Allen Dulles of the CIA, \"unless we quickly take new measures to increase our facilities for scientific education.\"\n\nIt is apparent, too, that this lead is not merely one of numbers, but of quality as well. A special study concluded by the Joint Atomic Energy Committee of the Congress concluded that \"the training given Soviet engineers and scientists is of a high order and compares favorably with the best in the United States and Europe.\"\n\nThe same study pointed up the responsibility of our public school systems in this area. At the same time, the teaching of the physical sciences and mathematics in our secondary schools has declined; about half of those with talent in these fields who graduate from high school are either unable or uninterested in going to college; and of the half who enter college, scarcely 40% graduate The task of reversing these disturbing trends is in large measure up to our public schools and their teachers.\n\nIn short, our position in the world and our hopes for survival ten, twenty or thirty years from now depend in large measure upon the kind of education which you in the teaching profession are able to offer your pupils today.\n\nBut we need something more than a nation of scientists and technicians – something more than an arsenal of super-weapons and ingenious inventions. We must have men and women capable of leading the \"free world\", of taking the hard and unpopular decisions necessary to preserve world peace and national security. In our concern over the education of more scientists and engineers for the future America, we dare not neglect its politicians.\n\nI realize that most Americans, including educators, are not accustomed to thinking of us politicians as educated men. We may be experienced, or cynical, or skillful, or shrewd or even fluent – but no more education is required for this kind of success than finding one's way around a smoke-filled room. Successful politicians, according to Walter Lippmann, are \"insecure and intimidated men,\" who \"advance politically only as they placate, appease, bribe, seduce, bamboozle, or otherwise manage to manipulate\" the views and votes of the people who elect them. It was considered a great joke years ego when the humorist Artemus Ward declared: \"I am not a politician, and my other habits are also good.\" And, in more recent times, even the President of the United States, when asked at a news conference early in his first term how he liked \"the game of politics,\" replied with a frown that his questioner was using a \"derogatory\" phrase. Being President, he said, is \"a very fascinating experience . . . but the word 'politics' . . . I have no great liking for that.\"\n\nBut under our form of government, we must put our ultimate faith in ordinary men, not machines or experts. In the words of Thomas Jefferson: \"If we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, (then) the remedy is not to take it from them – but to inform their discretion by education.\n\n\"To inform their discretion by education\" – that is your task, and the task of every teacher in every city and village in America. The students of today who may discourage you, harass you, and hopefully sometimes cheer you include the leaders and diplomats of tomorrow. Prince Bismarck once said that one-third of the students in Germany broke down from dissipation; one-third broke down from overwork; but the other third ruled Germany. (I leave it to each of you to decide which third becomes teachers.)\n\nBut in this country there can be no doubt that our educated and thinking citizens must of necessity be among the rulers of our land. The only question is what kind of education they need and will receive. Permit me to offer a few suggestions from my vantage point in the political arena.\n\nFirst, I would emphasize that we need not an over-concentration upon civic and political affairs, but the development of a broad range of talents. We do not need men like Lord John Russell, of whom Queen Victoria once said that he would be a better man if he knew a third subject – but he was interested in nothing but the Constitution of 1688 and himself. We do not need the kind of political education once described by Lord Bryce as \"sufficient to enable them to think they know something about the great problems of politics, but insufficient to show them how little they know.\" We need instead men with the education of Thomas Jefferson, described by a contemporary as \"A gentleman of 32, who could calculate an eclipse, survey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a horse, dance a minuet, and play the violin.\" We need man like Daniel Webster, who could throw thunderbolts at Hayne on the Senate floor and then stroll a few steps down the corridor and dominate the Supreme Court as the foremost lawyer of his time; like John Quincy Adams, who, after being summarily dismissed from the Senate for a notable display of independence, could became Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard and then become a great Secretary of State. (Those were the happy days when Harvard professors had no difficulty getting Senate confirmation.) We need men like Missouri's first Senator, Thomas Hart Benton, the man whose tavern brawl with Jackson in Tennessee caused him to flee the state, and yet whose education was described with these words in his obituary: \"With a readiness that was often surprising he could quote from a Roman Law or a Greek philosopher, from Virgil's Georgics, The Arabian Nights, Herodotus or Sanchez Panza, from the Sacred Carpets, the German reformers or Adam Smith; from Fenolon or Hudibras, from the financial reports of Mecca or the doings of the Council of Trent, from the debates on the adoption of the Constitution or intrigues of the kitchen cabinet or from some forgotten speech of a deceased Member of Congress.\"\n\nSecondly, I would emphasize that we need scholarship fitted for practical action, for something more than merely discussing political issues and deploring their solutions with learned phrases. For, as George William Curtis asked a similar body of educators a century ago, in urging their interest in the Kansas-Nebraska controversy: \"Would you have counted him a friend of ancient Greece who quietly discussed the theory of patriotism on that Greek summer day through whose hopeless and immortal hours Leonidas and his three hundred stood at Thermopylae for liberty? Was John Milton to conjugate Greek verbs in his library, or talk of the liberty of the ancient Shunamites, when the liberty of Englishmen was imperilled?\"\n\nIt is not enough, therefore, that our schools merely be great centers of learning, without concerning themselves with the uses to which that learning is put in the years that follow graduation. Indeed, care must be taken to see that it is not all left behind upon graduation! Dean Swift, you know, always said that Oxford was truly a seat of great learning; for all freshmen who entered were required to bring some learning with them in order to meet the standards of admission – but no senior, when he left the University, ever took any learning away, and thus it steadily accumulated.\n\nThird, I would emphasize the importance, in teaching students about public affairs, of avoiding the confusion of political idealism with political fantasy or rigidity. We need idealism in our public life – we need young men and women who will stand for the right regardless of their personal ambitions or welfare. But let us not permit them to carry that idealism to the point of fantasy – to the point where any compromise or concession is regarded as immoral. For politics and legislation are not matters for inflexible principles or unattainable ideals. Politics, as John Morley has acutely observed, \"is a field where action is one long second best, and where the choice constantly lies between two blunders;\" and legislation, under the democratic way of life and the Federal system of Government, requires compromise between the desires of each individual and group and those around then. Henry Clay, who should have known, said compromise was the cement that held the Union together:\n\n\"All legislation. . .is founded upon the principle of mutual concession. . . Let him who elevates himself above humanity, above its weaknesses, its infirmities, its wants, its necessities, say, if he pleases, 'I never will compromise;' but let no one who is not above the frailties of our common nature disdain compromise.\"\n\nSome of my colleagues who are criticized today for lack of forthright principles – or who are looked upon with scornful eyes as compromising \"politicians\" – are simply engaged in the fine art of conciliating, balancing and interpreting the forces and factions of public opinion, an art essential to keeping our nation united and enabling our Government to function. Their consciences may in one sense direct them from time to time to take a more rigid stand for principle – but their intellects tell them that a fair or poor bill is better than no bill at all, and that only through the give-and-take of compromise will any bill receive the successive approval of the Senate, the House, the President and the nation. A Federal aid to education bill, for example, will come from the Congress only when partisan, personal and regional considerations are made secondary to the good of our children and nation.\n\nI have posed to you today the challenge that confronts the educational system of America – the challenge of world leadership or world weakness, of success or failure in the Cold War years to come, the challenge of survival or extinction. The question remains as to whether our educational system today is capable of meeting this challenge – or whether a shortage of teachers, a shortage of classrooms, a shortage of money and a consequent lack of high quality education will not in the long run prove to be the undoing of our nation.\n\nThat public education is in a state of crisis today is well known. There is less agreement on the cause and on the cure. I can only hope that those who recognize the urgent need of improving public education in this country will not exhaust their efforts in looking for a scapegoat, but will join in attacking the problem at its very roots.\n\nThe responsibility for ending this crisis, in my opinion, must be shared at three levels – Federal, State and local.\n\nFirst, the Federal government, which has far greater as well as more effective means for raising public revenues, has an unavoidable responsibility to enact promptly a bold and imaginative program of Federal assistance to the States and local school districts for the construction of public schools, leaving all direction of academic content and standards, of course, in local hands. Our teachers cannot be expected to fulfill their critical responsibilities when nearly a million boys and girls are deprived by the classroom shortage of full-time schooling, when millions more are held back in unwieldy classes of forty or more. We need this year additional classrooms to meet the requirements of about nine million more pupils than we presently have adequate room for in our elementary and secondary schools. The valiant efforts of State and local authorities, which spent over two and one-half billion dollars in school construction during the last school year, must be supplemented by Federal action to meet this nation-wide problem.\n\nBut more and better classrooms are not enough. More and better teachers are also needed, better trained, better paid, better utilized. Here the State and local authorities share responsibility. Our State governments must provide better teachers' colleges, attracting the best students and providing the best education. All of you are familiar with States with too many teachers' colleges which are, as a result, too small, too poorly financed and staffed, and too ill-equipped in terms of physical plant, libraries, laboratories and other facilities.\n\nAuthorities on the State level could also take steps to improve teacher certification, re-examining outmoded statutory requirements, maintaining and gradually elevating minimum standards, and providing for those who pass a sense of accomplishment and prestige comparable to those who pass the examinations necessary for admission to the legal and medical professions.\n\nFinally, a large measure of responsibility for improving the quality of teaching in our schools rests with our local school board and school administrators. Not as a United States Senator, but as an interested citizen, I would respectfully suggest that present methods for recruiting teachers might be re-examined – to attract the best students, to select the best graduates, to compete in the labor market with the expertly developed recruitment methods of American business. Although the figure is too staggering to comprehend fully, the fact is that our schools must recruit during the next three years alone almost three-quarters of a million new teachers, more than our entire school system contained only a short time ago.\n\nOnce teachers are recruited and hired, more can be done to improve the methods of teacher promotion. We must find better rewards for our better teachers; we must make actual use of probationary periods to retain only those with satisfactory performance records; and we must demonstrate concretely to young beginners in the field that real opportunities for advancement await those whose contribution is of the highest caliber.\n\nMore can be done, also, in terms of better teacher utilization – removing dull and burdensome administrative details and paperwork that might better be done by electronic computers or parent volunteers.\n\nAnd finally, and perhaps most important, school boards, school patrons and all of our citizens must cooperate in the effort to achieve better teachers' salaries. No profession of such importance in the United States today is so poorly paid. No other occupational group in the country is asked to do so much for so little. No amount of new classrooms, television, training and recruitment techniques can attract and retain good teachers as long as their salaries are beneath the responsibility and dignity of their position, when we pay the average railway conductor nearly twice as much as we pay the teacher who conducts our elementary classes, or plumbers, plasterers, and steamfitters are paid more for improving our homes than we pay teachers for improving the minds of our children.\n\nHelp from the Federal level for more and better classrooms – help from the State level for better teachers' colleges and better teacher certification, help from the local level for better teacher recruit sent, better teacher promotion, better teacher utilization, and better teacher salaries – those are the goals toward which must move all those who recognize that in your hands lies the fate of the nation.\n\n\"Knowledge is power,\" said Francis Bacon; it is also light. In the dark and despairing days ahead, our youth shall need all the light the teaching profession can bring to bear upon the future.\n\nIn his book \"One Man's America,\" Alistair Cooke tells the story which illustrates my point. On the 19th of May, 1780, as he describes it, in Hartford, Connecticut, the skies at noon turned from blue to gray and by mid-afternoon had blackened over so densely that, in that religious age, men fell on their knees and begged a final blessing before the end came. The Connecticut House of Representatives was in session. And as some men fell down in the darkened chamber and others clamored for an immediate adjournment, the Speaker of the House, one Colonel Davenport, came to his feet. And he silenced the din with these words: \"The Day of Judgment is either approaching or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for adjournment. If it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish, therefore, that candles may be brought.\"\n\nTeachers of America, we who hope for the future peace and security of our nation, and for the wisdom and courage of our leaders, ask once again that you bring us candles to illuminate our way."
