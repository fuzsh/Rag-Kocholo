The school only had sophomores in its first year, and all he had was a 35-piece BAND. He took them to a parade and they won. The die was cast. He knew nothing about half time shows and always kept the book that had guided him. His style of pageantry show was original, and the crowd loved it. Go Moffit drills! He did have an orchestra for several years at Loara, but the numbers in the band had taken over. Within five years of the school’s opening, he had one of the largest programs, most competitively successful marching bands, and played university level literature in the concert hall.
