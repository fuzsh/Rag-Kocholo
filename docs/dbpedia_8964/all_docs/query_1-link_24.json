        "text": "It sounds very interesting. I have questions about some bits:\n\nHoyer makes the case that once the option of emigration was blocked, people basically got on with building their lives and made a society that worked, where things gradually got better and where there was a surprising degree of pluralism and disagreement for what was effectively (though not officially) a one-party dominated state.\n\nI wonder if this doesn’t undersell things. People adjust their actions in relation to what is possible, to a larger degree, and most people are not heros, fools, or strong iconoclasts/rebles, so they don’t push hard against a system that is likely to smack them down if they do push. In such situations, that most people are able to make their lives within the system is interesting, and important to know, but I’m not sure that it tells us all that much about the system itself. I suspect that something like this is true of every oppressive society or culture in the world.\n\nWe both drew the conclusion that this was a permanent feature of the system. But Hoyer argues that it was, rather, a symptom of the particular crisis of the 1980s.\n\nI know less about the Easter German economy than I do the Soviet one, but in his exhuastive book, The Soviet Economic System, Alec Nove argues, convicingly, I think, that the problems that plagued the Soviet economy in the 1980s, though made worse by the decrease in oil prices, were predictable and largely inevitable results of the system over-all, and that it was hard to see how the system could be reformed in an acceptable way. He notes some differences of the East German system, including its better access to foreign trade than most of the Communist block, and the way that market pressures were able to be used sometimes even in the controlled economy there, but I’d be surprised if it wasn’t the case in E. Germany, too, that the system was likely to continue to develop more and more problems that couldn’t really be fixed piecemeal. Of course, it would take a careful study by a specialist to know for sure.\n\n(Wikipedia says the book was less well received in Germany than in the UK. If you or anyone has details on how/why, that would also be interesting to know.)\n\nA couple of anecdotes here that may be relevant. I went through East Berlin going to Prague in about 1980 (I don’t remember the exact date). A few things that struck me:\n\n1. Some younger people were quite willing to talk to you fairly openly on the street (in perfectly good English). The thing that most irked them was not being able to travel freely.\n\n2. The thing that I really was not available were fresh fruit and vegetables, even though I was there in summer. But I walked around the streets and saw people parking their Trabis and talking boxes of fruit and vegetables out of the boots. I’m not sure whether there was a black market or whether they grew them on allotments.\n\n3. I had to take the S-Bahn to get to the Ostbahnhof where the train to Prague left from. They insisted I have the correct change (which I didn’t have) and were inflexible about it. So I just travelled “schwarz”. Nothing happened. It aligned with a general feeling that rather than being a police start, East Germany was rather anarchistic.\n\n4. There were some modern buildings with rather ugly architecture to be seen, but in many buildings there was no sign of any repairs or renovations having been made since the end of the war. There were still bullet holes to be seen on the facades of many buildings.\n\n5. Near Alexanderplatz, I saw a free street concert. The support act was a Police cover band and the main act had original light rock songs and was pretty good. The crowd was fairly large but reserved, mostly long haired youth.\n\n6. When I took the train to Prague most people got off at the first stop beyond the border, and I didn’t know why. I found out later why. They were changing money, because when you got to Prague all the banks were closed and without cash you couldn’t buy anything or get into a hotel. I had to bribe people to get to a hotel that would take US dollar travellers cheque. First lesson, there are ways to do things, but you have to know them.\n\nChasing through the links, many of the rejections struck me as tediously unimaginative and entirely conformist imperialist history. For example, when someone posing as a true expert tells me Hoyer’s remarks on the Hallstein doctrine are wrong but just leaves it there, without any effort to explain how she got it wrong or cite even a meager handful of facts showing she was wrong, I am not impressed. Facts and arguments are the sharp edge of a hatchet job, but when you can’t even do that? It suggests your views are part of the mythology. By the way, I don’t share the complacent certainty that conformity to the conventional views so mystifyingly held by the authorities (however does that happen, such historians wonder? The will of The People?) is purely voluntary here and now but not there and then.\n\nSimilarly, the flat assertion that Stalin would never have accepted a neutral united Germany strikes me merely as piety. Chronology refutes any falsification that sees the formation of the BRD as reactions to Stalinism or Soviet imperialism. Yet, that is the fundamental premise of such dismissal. Soviets withdrew from Austria and Iran, so no, the assumption no neutral Germany could have negotiated needs support. The bland unspoken assumption that only continuity with the Second Reich and Weimar and (the good parts of) Third Reich (economy and society) could produce a real Germany needs some argument. Adenauer’s rejection is just as blunt a fact as the Wall. Somehow ignoring that he did reject it to put the onus on Stalin is egregious special pleading I think. And references to modern research, a la Wentker, aren’t enough. Citations may not convince me, but the absence of citations should convince no one.\n\nThe general notion that Hoyer’s popular history must rehearse at acceptable length a whole catalog of favorite crimes in order to be deemed acceptable doesn’t even make sense in a work correcting false views. First, once again, the real rebuttal to these claims lies in a brief selection of citations demonstrating Hoyers is tilting at a straw man, thus her selection is not a correction but a falsification. That is to say, reviewers should show how Ossis are not second-class and the DDR is not dismissed. This seems to be in defiance of common opinion and thus needs more demonstration to justify rejecting Hoyer in toto.\n\nSecond, a double standard is at work here: It simply is not, not, not the case that by common consent every popular work of history must detail at suitable length the failures, crimes and atrocities of the historian’s state, or be rejected as propaganda. Perhaps it should, though how this isn’t another kind of sensationalism is not clear to me? This is especially true when conventional wisdom and civic religion erect mythologies about villains as well as heroes. The implication no decent historian offends the devout readers is the very opposite of historical judgment in my opinion.\n\nBut that’s enough on the negative critique from the right. (Of the links the only leftish view is the Christian Bangel article, which is very narrow in focus, a personal testimony which appears to be honest, but isn’t a scientific survey. Data, not the end of the story. Double standards usually require such stringent quality control in selected cases after all, but I don’t reject Bangel.) The truth is, I’ve left the book unfinished lying in the bathroom and I haven’t been able to force myself back to it even given the usually desperate need to read on that occasion. Why not?\n\nTo put it briefly, because 1)her view is too much about justifying national unity 2)her view relies far too much on BS like the paranoia of collective entities 3)there is too thin, nearly nonexistent comparative analysis between the DDR and the BRD even, much less the capitalist world as a whole and 4)there is no viewpoint on historical context, before and after.\n\nAnd to put it bluntly, 1)the DDR is basically decommunized (or destalinized if you insist) in roughly the same kind of sentimental way the BRD is denazified. Lurking in the background is, Let us all, Ossis and Wessis unite as Germany wages war against Russia and supports Israel. Her softness on the AFD, which is after all quite popular everywhere (at the moment) is I think part and parcel of her patriotic agenda. But I’m not a German or even an Anglo-German.\n\n2)The complaints about Hoyer’s leniency against the SED leadership are nonsense. The notion that a group of people have a mind that an amateur can diagnose as paranoia, even when there really are enemies, is malignant twaddle. This is committed anticommunist analysis, seeing a whole group of people (many of whom were jailed by Nazis) as pathological. Perhaps the most ridiculous example is Hoyer’s ludicrous certainty that it was the state’s slandering of a Lutheran clergyman who set himself on fire as a nutjob and a right winger that provoked the widespread opposition. Perhaps I am unduly influence by the example of Christian clergymen in the US throughout my lifetime? But I firmly believe putting undue faith in the good faith of the clergy is for liars and fools. I’m afraid arguing with my life experience will be an uphill job. Thus, I see this as another example of someone arguing that it’s woke snobbery that is provoking Trumpery, except with a right wing twist to turn it back on the enemy.\n\n3)When talking about the emigration from the east to the west in the late forties and fifties, Hoyer tacitly affirms there were no Nazis fleeing to safer ground. And I know 1953 is a whole eight years after the Third Reich, which Hoyer assumes is an entire generation so that apparently Nazism couldn’t possibly play even a lesser role in the events of June. Don’t agree. To me it seems inescapable to see her basic attitude as, Germany shouldn’t have paid such massive reparations thus the DDR was savagely persecuted and “we” today should forgive the abused people of Germany for impaired ways of dealing with this (i.e., the DDR’s socialism.) I don’t believe this is the same thing as rejection of collective punishment. Perhaps I haven’t gotten far enough, but the BRD’s involvement in foreign affairs is uncriticized. For that matter (unless I haven’t got to that part yet?) the DDR’s supplementary role along with the Cubans in helping defeat South African intervention in Angola (a defeat playing a role in the end of apartheid in my judgment) isn’t praised, despite the supposed apologetic intentions of Hoyer.\n\n4)In the end I think Hoyer still holds to the preposterous notion that somehow democracy—meaning a free market system as Hoyer’s Free Democratic Party economist and politician husband presumably has it?—is the opposite of totalitarianism, the amalgam of Naziism and Communism. I think by avoiding explication of this, much less defense, of the long trend Hoyer avoids asking the question: Isn’t the rise of the AFD so strongly in the east and the west, the product of the defeat of socialism? Socialism is the opposite of fascism. It’s fascism and democracy that are the brothers (Cain and Abelish at times?) If one end of the seesaw, socialism, goes down, doesn’t the other end go up? The implicit notion that Erhard’s miracle isn’t just as ephemeral as Schacht’s miracle I think is false. And her book, which I think is pervaded by the feeling that FDP economics is just and true, lacks value in proportion.\n\n19: It’s a two-Doug night.\n\n27: One reason people get wound up about the GDR is that it’s still a salient division in German politics. One way that Germany is different from other post-communist countries in Europe is that the former monopoly party has not returned to power at the national level. Here again, that’s a function of having had another German state.\n\nThe division is relevant at the sub-national level where the SED’s successors have shared power in most (maybe all, I’m not looking it up just now) of the eastern states, and none of the western ones. At least two bids to bring the Left into state government in the west have failed specifically because the SED repressed family members of SPD parliamentarians, and they could not bring themselves to vote the successor party into power. The division is relevant because Sahra Wagenknecht — someone who thought that the early summer of 1989 was a dandy time to join the SED — leads a faction in the Bundestag.\n\nSo talking about the GDR’s past is one way of talking about Germany’s present, and of course that’s contentious. Doug Muir’s a periodic resident of Bavaria; I’ve lived in Berlin for a dozen years now, and Munich for ten before that; we’re both more than interested outsiders.\n\nHoyer’s book is close to M.E. Sarotte’s Not One Inch in my TBR pile. I bought them both with pleasant anticipation, but now I am feeling uneasy about them. Sarotte, because I wonder how she will address the “Compared to what?” question. (I thought her book on the fall of the Wall was terrific on details, but less so on the big picture.) Hoyer, because I worry that she will elide unpleasant parts of the GDR to a degree that makes the book untenable. If she were writing about the American South in the first two thirds of the 20th century — would she say, “Oh yeah, things were bad for Black people” or would she capture the centrality of Jim Crow in that society?\n\nI’ll probably find out this spring or summer when I read the book, and the discussion here has helped me to understand the sources of my unease and to realize I’m far from the only one.\n\n“So, no, I’m not wildly pleased about the personalization and the aggression.”\n\nIt’s not aggression. It’s impatience and, yes, irritation.\n\nYour interest in the DDR stems from… what, two weeks you spent there forty years ago? Which is fine! It’s good to have interests. And you don’t have to live in a place to be interested in its history.\n\nBut other-Doug and I do live in or near the former DDR, so its legacy affects us directly in a way that it doesn’t affect you. Like, my small town has a refugee center, and the AfD organized a protest of it. Our little Bavarian Stadt didn’t have enough AfD supporters, though, so to make it work, they bussed in some protestors from… the former DDR, just a few miles away.\n\nFurther: I’ve been dealing personally and professionally with the legacy of Communism for most of the last 25 years. In 2008, in post-Communist Armenia, I put my wife and small children on an airplane out of the capital at 5 AM; at 10 AM, the Army started shooting protesters in the street. In 2015, in post-Communist Tajikistan, we had to shelter in place for a day when there was an abortive coup that turned into a bloody purge, with a running gun battle on the airport road a few minutes from our house. In Moldova in 2018, I nearly lost my job because my work had annoyed a local oligarch. That oligarch had gotten his start, back in the 1980s, as a low-level KGB man running the surveillance cameras in the local Intourist hotel; when the USSR fell, he made his first million using sex tapes to blackmail local politicians and businessmen.\n\nI don’t mention these anecdotes to score points. Once you choose a career as a development worker, stuff like this is going to happen sometimes. And I know many people whose experiences have been far, far more alarming. I mention this stuff to make the point that, for many years, “what is the legacy of Communism” has been a much more immediate question for me and my family than it probably has been for you or yours. It’s something that has impacted our lives very directly. I can draw a direct line from the Communist surveillance state of the late 1980s to some very unpleasant experiences that I had 30 years later: it was literally the same dude.\n\n— Does this make me a frothing knee-jerk anti-Communist? I don’t think so? I’m interested in that history, and I’m perfectly happy to discuss the various positive aspects of those regimes. The USSR was progressive in a bunch of ways, crushed Hitler, put the first man in space, and had really good basic public health! Communist Yugoslavia was actually damn interesting, and might have survived if Tito hadn’t screwed up the 1968 Constitution! Communism in Hungary finally got rid of the rapacious, extractive, and reactionary nobility that had plagued the country for the last 500 years!\n\nSo if you want to say “the DDR had pretty good housing and health care, actually” — well, I don’t actually think that’s correct, but it’s a conversation I’m perfectly happy to have; see my comment on life expectancy, above. And a conversation about exactly why the DDR fell — lack of freedom (if so, which ones)? stifled expectations? desire for consumer goods? pan-German nationalism? — could be endlessly interesting.\n\nBut if the starting point is “other than the bad stuff — which I absolutely acknowledge but don’t really want to discuss in detail — there was much to like”, then yeah, hackles may rise. From where I sit, the bad stuff was unavoidable and central.\n\nDoug M.\n\nwacko: “perhaps they’re just refusing to wear the smiley conformist mask that most western people wear all their lives. But I could be wrong, of course.”\n\nYou could indeed go wrong, but conformism is in the eye of the beholder isn’t it? Ask any follower of a cultlike authoritarian movement and they’ll tell you how nonconformist they are. The real conformists are those of us who reject their fake populist conspiracy narratives – we are sheep who believe everything that the “Lügenpresse”, the lying press, is telling us. The millions who in recent weeks have taken to the street to defend democracy and human rights against right wing extremism – possibly the biggest mass protest in German history by number of participants (https://taz.de/Demos-gegen-rechts-im-Maerz/!6002586/) – are, if you believe the AFD, following government orders (“bestellte Massen”).\n\nIt is instructive to look back to the period immediately after the fall of the SED regime in 1989, when a window of opportunity opened. The Bürgerrechtler, the civil rights activists who were instrumental in bringing down the regime, founded new political parties. They mostly wanted the GDR to remain independent and to develop some sort of democratic socialism based on the experiences that had been made. The first and last election was held in March 1990 and was won by the CDU with 41% (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkskammerwahl_1990). The CDU was a so-called “block party”. Although the regime was functionally a one party state, it allowed the existence of a Christian, a liberal and a nationalist party with names similar to the parties of Western bourgeois democracy. These parties simply had to agree to whatever the SED proposed – calling the conformist would be an understatement – but they were formally separate. After the Wende, the West German CDU shamelessly fused with the SED regime party CDU and used it as its power base.\n\nVoters now for the first time had a choice – and they voted for the same old. The SPD, which was not tainted by SED collaboration, got 22%, the SED successor party PDS 17%. The new parties of the civil rights movement, led by courageous if often politically naive idealists who had brought about a successful nonviolent revolution with millions on the streets: became irrelevant immediately. The next thing happening was that the new government and parliament under the leadership of these opportunist fake Democrats dissolved its own state – and the window of opportunity was closed for good.\n\nWhat happened isn’t hard to explain, people followed the money. But they did have a choice and what they got is exactly what they voted for, the dissolution of their own independent state in favor of a new regime of West-dominated bourgeois capitalism.\n\nThere’s a half-written comment on my home computer, so maybe I will add more later, but here are a couple of thoughts from about halfway through the book. (Chronologically, the Berlin Wall just went up.)\n\nThe book is more of a political history than I would have expected from the introduction, or from the commentary I have read. That is, there is more about what the leaders did, and thought that they were doing. It’s not just who was in charge of what, how they got that power, and who was fighting them for it/angling to follow them in that role, but there is a good bit of that kind of history, which was not quite what I was expecting.\n\nOne of the things I’m not liking about the book is that I’m not confident about how she knows the things that she writes, especially the larger judgements. For example, she opines that once the Wall was up, most people in East Germany basically shrugged, rolled up their sleeves and got on with building the country. How did she come to that assessment? Without evidence — and Hoyer does not cite any for her view — one could just as easily write that the East Germans with initiative got out while they could, and the ones who were left were cowed by the Soviet occupation and the security apparatus, so they kept their heads down and half-assed their way through the next quarter century.\n\nBut the tendency is there in smaller things, too. The chapter about building the Wall also has a vignette about a woman who jumped, fatally, from the third-story window of a street that was West Berlin up to the facade of her building, which was in the East. She criticizes the press in West Germany for calling it a “jump to freedom,” saying that they could not have known her motivations. But on the immediately preceding page, Hoyer had been writing from the woman’s point of view, about her rising panic that the Western fire brigades that had been catching people who jumped would not arrive in time for her.\n\nOne of her theses from the introduction is along the lines that East Germany is more than just a footnote of German history, and deserves to be considered as a thing in itself. That’s fair, and a good reason for the book. But, in my view, when actually writing the book she elides this with the position that East Germany had an existence that was not immediately tied to Soviet power. It’s a little like writing about the Confederation of the Rhine while downplaying, though not excising, the role of Napoleon."
