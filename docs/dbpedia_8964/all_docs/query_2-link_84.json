        "text": "In the soggy, early morning hours of April 22nd, 1956, a team of Soviet and East German soldiers began to dig at the muddy municipal cemetery in Altglienicke, East Berlin. The spring season had been exceptionally rainy, causing many short circuits in Berlinâs telephone network. The soldiersâ assignment was to unearth a buried telephone cable and check for damage. When they reached the cable, however, they made a surprising discovery: the cable had been wiretapped and rerouted into a secret tunnel.\n\nOperation GOLD\n\nCode-named âOperation GOLD,â the Berlin Tunnel mission was a secret tunnel constructed beneath the city of Berlin by the CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (MI-6) in order to clandestinely intercept communications from the Soviet Union. The East German capital was the center of a Soviet communications network connecting key European nodes and extending well into Russia.\n\nIt was an audacious operation in both scope and skill.\n\nAlthough a mole threatened the entire mission, historians consider the Berlin Tunnel one of the greatest intelligence successes of the Cold War.\n\nWhy Berlin?\n\nDuring the Cold War, monitoring and thwarting Moscowâs influence worldwide was the top priority for CIA and our allies.\n\nIn the 1950s, before reconnaissance satellites, wiretaps were one of the essential ways the Agency collected intelligence on Soviet military capabilities. The Soviets had shifted from radio to landline telephones for most military traffic, transmitting both encrypted messages and non-secure messages. Almost all of the communications between Moscow (Russia), Warsaw (Poland), and Bucharest (Romania) went through Berlin, making it the perfect target.\n\nThe only problem: East Berlin was one of the most heavily guarded cities in the world.\n\nSpies Beneath the City:\n\nThe CIA and MI-6 believed tunneling from West Berlin to the underground cables in nearby East Berlin was feasible, and that they could tap the Soviet communicationsâ lines securely and without anyone noticing.\n\nIn January 1954, then-CIA Director Allen Dulles approved the covert tunneling and tapping operation. The CIA used a U.S. Air Force radar site and warehouse in West Berlin as cover for the construction of the tunnel.\n\nDigging the Tunnel:\n\nThe Air Force radar site, which was roughly the size of an average city block, was fenced with chain-link high security fencing and contained a warehouse that served as the main operations building for the mission.\n\nThe first big obstacleâwhat do with all the dirt?\n\nAfter many weeks of debate, it was decided theyâd create a special basement in the warehouse for the purpose of storing all the dirt. During the tunnelâs construction, over 3,000 tons of soil was removed.\n\nThe warehouse also contained a combined kitchen-dining facility and barracks, and another building, which housed three diesel-driven generators to provide power for all the facilities.\n\nThe soil was quite sandy, so to avoid potential cave-ins, technicians decided that the tunnel should be lined with steel. Near the entrance where there was the greatest chance of collapse, a metal âshieldâ was devised so that even if dry sand was encountered, the danger of a cave-in would be virtually eliminated.\n\nThe tunnel liner was formed from sections of heavy steel plate constructed so that, when bolted together, five sections formed a steel ring approximately six feet in diameter and 15 inches long. The men worked under the cover of the shield, and when a sufficient amount of material had been excavated, the shield was forced forward with hydraulic jacks and a new section of liner was put in place. 125 tons of steel liner plate were used to line the tunnel.\n\nConstruction took a year.\n\nThe finished tunnel was 1,476 feet longâroughly the length of the Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial. One half sloped down, while the other half sloped up. British technicians installed the taps, and collection began on May 11th, 1955.\n\nA Mole in Our Midst:\n\nUnknown at the time to CIA and MI-6, the KGBâthe Soviet Unionâs premier intelligence agencyâhad been aware of the project from its start.Â\n\nGeorge Blake, a KGB mole inside MI-6, had told the Soviets about the secret operation during its planning stages.Â But to protect Blake, the KGB allowed the operation to continue until April 21, 1956 (April 22 in Berlin) when they âaccidentally discoveredâ the tunnel while supposedly repairing faulty underground cablesâwithout putting Blake at risk.\n\nThe Soviets planned the discovery in hopes of winning a propaganda victory by publicizing the operation.Â But their plan backfired when, instead of condemning it, most press coverage marveled at the audacity and technical ingenuity of the operation.\n\nIntelligence Success or Failure?\n\nThe Berlin Tunnel was CIAâs most ambitious operation conducted at the time. But was it a success?\n\nMost intelligence and foreign policy experts do consider it a huge success. The tunnel yielded valuable intelligence for U.S. policymakers and the U.S. military, such as:\n\nBecause the Soviets knew about the tunnelâs existence since its inception, many historians assumed any intelligence collected would have been fake. However, studies conducted years later show that the Soviets had not attempted to feed false information over the Berlin Tunnelâs tapped lines. The intelligence collected, as far as CIA can tell, was genuine.\n\nIn the end, the Berlin Tunnel produced:\n\nFollowing the tunnelâs shutdown, processing of this immense volume of data took more than two years to complete."
