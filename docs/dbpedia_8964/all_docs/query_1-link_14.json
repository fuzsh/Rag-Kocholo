        "text": "Berlin was founded in the early 1200s. In the 1400s German princes made it their capital. Berlin was the capital of the German kingdom of Prussia for most of the 1700s and 1800s. The city later became the capital of Germany.\n\nDuring World War II (1939–45) Berlin was nearly destroyed. The city was the site of heavy bombing and bloody fighting. More than 150,000 residents of Berlin died.\n\nGermany lost the war to the countries known as the Allies. The four main Allied countries then took control of Germany. Soon the Allies divided Germany into two countries: East Germany and West Germany. The Soviet Union had control over East Germany, and they established a harsh government there. The other Allied powers made West Germany a democracy.\n\nBerlin was in East Germany, but it was divided as well. East Berlin became the capital of East Germany. West Berlin was part of West Germany though it was separate from the rest of that country. (The capital of West Germany was Bonn.)\n\nMore than 2 million people fled from East Berlin into West Berlin between 1949 and 1961. To prevent more people from leaving, East Germany built a wall around West Berlin. The Berlin Wall was heavily guarded. It separated West Berlin from East Germany for almost 30 years.\n\nEast Germany’s communist government collapsed in 1989. People began to tear down the Berlin Wall. In 1990 the two parts of Germany and Berlin were reunited. Berlin was again the capital of all of Germany. Population (2015 estimate), 3,469,849."
