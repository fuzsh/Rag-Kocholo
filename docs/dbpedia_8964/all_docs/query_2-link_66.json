        "text": "Google Maps\n\nBerlin has earned its electric reputation, but there is much more to explore on an East Germany road trip beyond the capital.\n\nSee UNESCO World Heritage sites in pretty Potsdam, where Prussian kings “summered” in an opulent palace and Cold War spies held covert meetings.\n\nMeanwhile, trendy Leipzig is quickly stealing Berlin’s thunder as an emerging hub for techno music and art. Prague is an easy road trip from Berlin, perfect for a few days spent sipping craft beers and sightseeing.\n\nFinally, head to Görlitz to find a scene-stealing Old Town and stroll right across the border into Poland for a few pierogis. With Berlin as your base, the region’s many underrated gems are just a short drive away. Los geht's!\n\nJust a 40-min drive from our local depot, Potsdam is a quick and easy first stop on this East Germany road trip from Berlin.\n\nThis UNESCO World Heritage Site is poised on the banks of the Havel River, with an interesting blend of architecture, history, and green spaces.\n\nYour first stop should be Sanssouci Palace, truly Germany’s answer to Versailles. Once the summer home of King Frederick the Great, this opulent palace is dripping in luxury and surrounded by beautifully landscaped gardens.\n\nIf spy novels are more your thing, Potsdam has plenty of Cold War intrigue to get your motor running. Glienicke Bridge once formed a border between West Berlin and East Germany, creating an ideal location for the regimes to exchange their captured secret agents.\n\nFor this reason, it became known as the “Bridge of Spies,” and even served as a filming location for the so-named film inspired by true events, starring Tom Hanks.\n\nWhere else but Leipzig can you catch a concert of Johann Sebastian Bach’s greatest hits, then dance the night away to the latest techno beats? The wave of artists and musicians flocking to the city has created infectious energy that pulsates day and night.\n\nGet your fill of beautiful architecture in the Old Town, then head to Karli (short for Karl-Liebknecht-Straße) to dance the night away in techno clubs that rival sister Berlin’s.\n\nOn the other side of the Vltava River, Prague Castle cuts an imposing figure on the city skyline. Explore the church, castle complex, and surrounding gardens at your leisure before grabbing a shameless photo opp at the colourful John Lennon Wall.\n\nThere are usually some extra brushes and paint laying around, so feel free to leave your mark (political statement or otherwise).\n\nWhen you’re ready for a pivo or three, there are traditional beer gardens like Letna and Riegrovy Sady, or head to the hip riverfront hangout Naplavka."
