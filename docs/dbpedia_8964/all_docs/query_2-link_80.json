        "text": "The chart shows the GDP per capita of East Germany (yellow) and West Germany (blue). The researchers warned that the numbers from East Germany may be misreported, as they are not based on market prices.\n\nNevertheless, the two regions diverged significantly after 1950, and the communist side never fully recovered. The quick rebound that the East experienced immediately after reunification made up for little more than what it suffered during the turmoil around 1990.\n\nThe authors argued that the divergence was likely affected by several pre-existing conditions.\n\nNotably, the Soviets dismantled East Germany’s industrial base during occupation and didn’t support rebuilding efforts like the Allies did in the West.\n\nEven before the war, the East was significantly more working class, protestant, and politically left-wing.\n\nFinally, the East lost some of its most skilled and educated citizens, as they fled oppressive communist rule. Eastern Germany may not have been able to recover that loss just by changing political systems.\n\nThe authors explored how each of these factors, and several others, may alter estimates of the impact of communism on East Germany."
