        "text": "To prevent attempts to scale the wall or escape by digging underneath, the wall was reinforced with barbed wire, spikes, metal gratings, bunkers and vehicles made into obstacles.\n\nA wide-open area of dirt and sand, a buffer zone between the two walls, became known as \"no man's land\" or the \"death strip,\" where guards in watch towers could shoot anyone trying to escape.\n\nOn border grounds, at least 140 people died either by gunshot, by fatal accident while trying to escape, or suicide.\n\nThe most famous border crossing was known as Checkpoint Charlie.\n\nTimeline\n\n1 of 23\n\n2 of 23\n\n3 of 23\n\n4 of 23\n\n5 of 23\n\n6 of 23\n\n7 of 23\n\n8 of 23\n\n9 of 23\n\n10 of 23\n\n11 of 23\n\n12 of 23\n\n13 of 23\n\n14 of 23\n\n15 of 23\n\n16 of 23\n\n17 of 23\n\n18 of 23\n\n19 of 23\n\n20 of 23\n\n21 of 23\n\n22 of 23\n\n23 of 23\n\nFebruary 4-11, 1945 - In the face of Germany's defeat in World War II, the Allies' Yalta Conference agrees to divide Germany into four zones of occupation: Great Britain, France and the United States occupy the western, northwestern and southern portions, and the Soviet Union occupies the eastern.

Kennedy speaks to a crowd in West Berlin at the Rathaus Schöneberg (city hall) on Rudolph Wilde Platz: \"Today in the world of freedom the proudest boast is 'Ich bin ein Berliner' ('I am a Berliner') all free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin. And therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words 'Ich bin ein Berliner.'\"\n\nSeptember 12-13, 1964 - Martin Luther King Jr. visits Berlin at the invitation of West Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt. King delivers a sermon on both sides of the wall titled \"East and West -- God's Children.\"\n\nSeptember 3, 1971 - Talks between the US, Britain, France and the Soviet Union lead to the Four-Power Agreement on Berlin, a decree to improve conditions for West Berliners and ease travel to and from West Germany and West Berlin, as well as travel by West Berliners to the East. It also normalizes Berlin's status as a divided city.\n\nDecember 21, 1972 - West and East Germany sign the Basic Treaty, which normalizes diplomatic relations and recognizes each other's sovereignty.\n\nJune 12, 1987 - In a speech at the Brandenburg Gate, US President Ronald Reagan challenges General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev, leader of the USSR, to \"tear down this wall!\"\n\nApril 1989 - GDR border guards are instructed to stop \"using firearms to prevent border violations.\"\n\nOctober 18, 1989 - Communist Party chief Honecker is ousted and is replaced by Egon Krenz.\n\nNovember 2, 1989 - Krenz announces sweeping political and economic reforms.\n\nNovember 4, 1989 - More than a half million people participate in a pro-freedom rally in East Berlin, demanding free elections.\n\nNovember 6, 1989 - A preliminary law passes that gives all citizens travel and emigration rights, with restrictions.
