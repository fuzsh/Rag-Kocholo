        "text": "Germany is Europe's largest economy and the most populous country in the European Union.\n\nAchieving national unity later than other European nations, Germany quickly caught up economically and militarily, before defeats in World War One and World War Two left it shattered, facing the difficult legacy of Nazism and divided between Europe's Cold War blocs.\n\nAfter 1949, West Germany rebounded to become the continent's economic giant and a prime mover of European cooperation. Franco-German cooperation was central to European economic integration in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nWith the end of the Cold War, the two parts of the country were once again united, although the economy of the former east continues to lag behind the rest of the country.\n\nSince reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 and co-founding the Eurozone.\n\nThe 63-year-old former finance minister defied earlier expectations by winning the September 2021 election.\n\nHe formed a coalition with the Greens and business-friendly Free Democrats in December, becoming the first Social Democrat chancellor since 2005.\n\nHe took over from the Christian Democrat Angela Merkel, Germany's first female chancellor, who governed for 16 years in coalition with either the Free Democrats or the Social Democrats.\n\nMr Scholz was her vice-chancellor as well as finance minister in 2018-2021.\n\nDespite having a much more restrained and cautious response than that of other Western countries to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Scholz oversaw an increase in Germany's defence budget, weapons shipments to Ukraine and a discontinuance of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.\n\nScholz set out the principles of a new German defence policy in his \"Zeitenwende\" speech to parliament immediately after the invasion.\n\nScholz described the attack as a \"historic turning point\" and announced that in response his government would use a â¬100bn fund to significantly increase military spending, reversing Germany's previously cautious defence policy.\n\nPresident: Frank-Walter Steinmeier\n\n800 - Emperor Charlemagne, Frankish ruler of France and Germany is crowned Roman emperor by Pope Leo III.\n\n843 - Break-up of the Frankish empire; Germany emerges as separate realm.\n\n962 - German King Otto I is crowned Roman emperor after gaining control of northern Italy; beginning of what becomes known as Holy Roman Empire centred on Germany.\n\n1250 - Death of Emperor Frederick II Hohenstaufen marks the virtual end of central authority and the acceleration of empire's collapse into independent princely territories.\n\n1438 - Election of Albert I marks beginning of Habsburg dynasty based in Austria.\n\n1517 - Martin Luther proclaims Ninety-Five Theses against traditional church practices; start of Protestant split from the Catholic Church.\n\n1618-1648 Thirty-Years' War: The failure of Habsburg emperors' attempt to restore Catholic dominance and imperial authority against the opposition of Protestant princes.\n\n1648 - Peace of Westphalia - the collective name for two peace treaties signed in the Westphalian cities of OsnabrÃ¼ck and MÃ¼nster - ends the war.
