        "text": "Formation of West Germany\n\nAmidst the concerns of the Soviet occupation in the east of Germany, British and American officials met in London in 1947. They were already drawing up plans to create a Western-backed territory to retain their presence in central Europe.\n\nAfter the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime (see Hitler and the Nazi Party), the Allies, who also included the formerly Nazi-occupied nations of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, believed that the German people had no right to have a say so soon after the war's end. They created a list of new laws to govern the country.\n\nWhat was the new constitution?\n\nThe new constitution, or 'Basic Law', gave hope of a free and prosperous future after the tyranny of Hitler. There were concerns in some quarters that it was too similar to the Weimar Consitution. Still, it had some important amendments, such as the removal of 'emergency powers' for the chancellor. Along with the $13 billion Marshall Plan from the United States that pledged to rebuild Europe in 1948, the Basic Law provided an excellent foundation for the growth of a successful nation. In the 1950s, the West German economy grew by 8% a year!\n\nTheFrankfurt Documents were a proto-constitution which went through the Bundestag (parliament) and were polished, leading to the creation of a new state under chancellorKonrad Adenauer in 1949.\n\nIn opposition to the Federal Republic of Germany (west Germany), five states formed the German Democratic Republic in the east. Monitored and engineered into a one-party state by the Soviet Union, it was a repressive dictatorship marred by food shortages and hunger. Without the industrial heartland of the Ruhr and the economic leg up from the United States, the GDR struggled, and the execution of Soviet-influenced collectivism by early leader Walter Ulbricht just made matters worse. In 1953 there were huge protests, where hundreds of thousands clamoured for reform, but this was crushed after Soviet military intervention.\n\nCollectivism\n\nA socialist policy where all land and crops are controlled by the state and strict farming quotas need to be met. It often resulted in food shortages and starvation.\n\nFormer Capital of West Germany\n\nThe capital of the Federal Republic of Germany during its years as West Germany (1949 - 1990) was Bonn. This was due to the complicated political nature of Berlin with its east and west divisions. Bonn was chosen as a temporary solution, instead of a bigger city such as Frankfurt, in the hope that the country would be reunited one day. It was a city of modest size with a traditional university and had cultural significance as the birthplace of composer Ludwig van Beethoven, but even today, it only has a population of 300,000.\n\nReunification\n\nDespite the reconciliation and cooling of tensions between East and West Germany which culminated in the visit of Erich Honecker to Bonn in 1987, there was still fear of a revolution. As the wheels of communism began to come off in Central and Eastern European states, East Germans escaped through the border of other revolutionised countries in 1989.\n\nDemonstrations began around the country and finally, in November 1989, the Berlin Wall was pulled down, with the authorities powerless to stop the sheer number of protestors. People from East and West Berlin gathered together in celebration. After this, a single German currency was established and the five eastern states became part of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990."
