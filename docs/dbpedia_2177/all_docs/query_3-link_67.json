        "text": "Jakarta – Talented, down to earth and kind are just a few of many facts that people could find from mehro, Los Angeles-based new musician who becomes a worldwide idol after releasing his debut single, Perfume, in February. Unfortunately, aside from those things, there is only limited information his fans know about him.\n\nFortunately, as a big fan and journalist, I had the opportunity to get to know him better in a special interview we did via a video call on October 22, 2020. On that occasion, the singer and songwriter shared many enthralling things about him that the public rarely knows. Here is the list:\n\n1. The name is written in lowercase, and there is a reason in it\n\nAs a fan, may not all of us realize that the writing of mehro name is in all lowercase letters. However, this thing is grabbing the writer’s attention. Notably because mehro himself often wrote his initials “m” in lowercase, too.\n\n“I like to be less spoken. I prefer my actions define what I do rather than my words.” mehro said, explaining the reason why he uses small m in the name.\n\n2. Lightning inspires Lightning\n\nAfter releasing his debut and successful single, Perfume, in February, mehro has published two other songs this year. They are Hideous in July and Lightning in October, which both is just as thriving as Perfume.\n\nmehro says a lot of things inspire him to create each song, and it could be in the form of something unexpected, like the lightning that inspired him to create Lightning.\n\n“The inspiration was getting to see a lightning storm for the first time in my life and capturing who I was and what I was feeling at that time of my life and putting it into a song. I wasn’t even really conscious of what the song was about.\n\n“I didn’t really realize that till later, but it was about young love and it was … about the loss of loved one and it means a lot to me because it deals with a lot of different things that I’ve been through in my life, and so that’s the inspiration. Just who I was about that time and the lightning storm inspired that out of me.” he told the author.\n\n3. Started learning guitar since 4 or 5 years ago\n\nIf you see how good mehro is at playing the guitar, you might think that he has been learning to play the instrument since a long, long time ago. But apparently, mehro started playing it just about four or five years ago.\n\nHe also revealed that as a teenager he joined a choir, where he started learning to sing.\n\n“I started playing the guitar about four or five years ago and that’s when I started writing songs, that’s when I started. I was in the choir growing up but it didn’t really sing. It’s a specific thing and I’m grateful for the experience I have, but singing alone versus singing with a large group of people is different.” he told the author.\n\n4. Loves to cook and eat\n\nApart from liking music, who would have thought that the charming singer is also fancies cooking. He said he started learning to cook since the coronavirus pandemic broke out, and Italian foods and eggs are his favorites to cook.\n\n“I like pasta. I like to cook pasta. I am Italian. I like vegetables. Eggs are very simple, but I like to cook eggs.” mehro said.\n\nAbout his favorite food, the idol whose ancestors are Italian and Irish said that he is into sushi.\n\n“I also love sushi. My two favorites foods are Italian foods and sushi. So, yes, if I could only eat those two foods for the rest of my life I would be okay, but I don’t have to. There are so many other foods to try and I can’t wait, but those are two of my favorites.”\n\n5. Went to acting class and dreamed of becoming a filmmaker\n\nWhile his career as a musician is on the rise, mehro revealed that he possessed other dreams he wanted to accomplish, which is to become a filmmaker and actor.\n\n“I like acting. I love film and I love visual media, which is why I take videos very seriously,” said the man who had starred in a short film entitled Scarecrow.\n\n“I do love… I think I will be a filmmaker one day. If the time comes to me to be an actor, then I’ll also an actor, as well. That’s another journey that I would love to do as well,” he added.\n\n6. Loves tulips sincerely\n\nIf you are a fan of mehro, you probably already know that the tulips we are talking about here are not flowers, but his loyal and supportive fans that he loves so much, as he told the author in the interview.\n\nWe will also find out this fact very soon if we observe the replies that mehro leaves to every fan’s comment on his social media accounts, where he clearly shows his sincere love for each tulip.\n\n“I find that it’s beautiful and I find that I have the best fans in the world that are sincere and loving and kind and thoughtful.” mehro explained about his fans.\n\n“I really do love all of you, and I am capable of loving many people and what you shared with me is so special, and there isn’t favorite. It is just if you love me and if you support me, that I’ll love and I’ll support you.”\n\nHe further said that he also has a message for everyone who knows him, especially the tulips.\n\n“I would say give yourself the opportunity to love yourself because it’s the most important thing that you can do. Please love yourself and forgive yourself and accept yourself for who you are and I would also say the same about the people and their lives and whoever those people are, whatever challenges they’re going through, it’s possible for them to surround themselves with people they love and to forgive the mistakes that other people have made in their lives and to try to understand the people that you don’t know.\n\n“Be willing to be open and hear that person’s perspective because they are human beings too. They are going through the struggles of life, that other human beings are going through is just different than how you and I are going through. But it still struggles, regardless.” he added.\n\nFor those who are wondering where is the Tulips name came from, you will find out the answer if you listen to Perfume, and I recommended it.\n\n7. Loves to compose songs at night\n\nAs a singer who writes his own songs, mehro said he composed most of his songs at night. However, he also admits that the songwriting ideas can come anytime and anywhere at the most unexpected times.\n\n“A lot of songs come very late at night as I don’t expect it to happen and then the inspiration strikes and you have to act on in.\n\n“It really any time of day, and the places, it doesn’t really matter as long as the environment allows you to be creative, which for me can be any environment that is not intrusive, that isn’t crowded to speak,” he said.\n\n8. Was an opening singer in Elohim’s tour\n\nBefore the coronavirus pandemic broke out, mehro was on tour with other American musicians, such as Elohim. He was the opening singer for Elohim, mehro explained.\n\nUnfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic forced them to postpone the tour. mehro stated he regretted this a lot, but he also said he was happy to be allowed to join many talented musicians on that music tour.\n\n“I was the opener and Bahari was direct supports, and it was Elohim tour. It meant a lot to me because she invited me to be the opener in October of 2019, and growing out I’ve never had a stream. I had two hundred something followers on Instagram and she wanted me to open for her and it meant a lot to me. I loved it. I learned a lot. It was a… I grow a lot as a performer, as a person, just being out there. I won’t trade that experience for anything.” he declared.\n\n9. Interested in writing a book\n\nAs a singer and songwriter whose work is highly praised by fans and listeners of his music, mehro admits that he is interested in publishing a book of song lyrics and spoken words. However, he did not specify when this would happen.\n\n“It’s very interesting. I’ve never thought about doing a poem book but I’m not opposed to it. I have thought about doing spoken words in live concerts. When the time comes, I think that will be really fun. If the time comes to publish like let’s say my lyrics into a book or including the poems, including the narratives, I would love that.”\n\n10. If he can possess a superpower, this is what mehro chooses\n\nEven without superpowers, we know that mehro can save and change his fans’ world already. However, if he can pick one, mehro said he wanted to have the power to stop time.\n\nThe reason why he chose that superpower will absolutely make you love him more, which is so that he could prevent a lot of bad things from happening.\n\n“I would have the ability to stop time or slow down time just in case, you know, there’s a lot of things you could do, there’s a lot of emergencies that you could prevent. There’s a lot of… you know you see someone that’s about walking in front of the car, something, you can turn on the power and moved that person and you see something is about to spill or someone about to slip, you will prevent a lot of bad things from happening.” mehro explained.\n\n“So that’s I think I would choose, but I don’t know. It’s a tough question,” he added."
