        "text": "Last August 2012 ‚Äì yeah once again I know its super late üòõ , I went to Singapore to see Passion Pit Concert with my best friend , Kat.\n\nBoth of us is a huge fan of Passion Pit , esp. Kat , she is crazy about this band..\n\nI personally like this band because its different, they are smart in terms of choosing a lyrics and also able to bring different nuance for their song.\n\nI am in love with this band, when I was listening to SleepyHead, geezz this song its so unique esp the intro, it will trigger you to listen more and easy to be remembered. Passion Pit itself is an American ElectroPop band from Cambridge, Massachussets. The lead of this band is Michael Angelakos, most of member of this band went to Berklee College of Music in Boston except Michael.\n\nIn Singapore, they performed at Esplanace Concert Hall, one of the coolest music hall in Singapore, I was so excited to watch them !! They came to Singapore to promote their new album, Gossamers !\n\nWhen I arrived at Singapore, I was so tired because the schedule was so tight esp I also watched Beach Boys ‚Äì 50 Years Anniversary Concert in the next day ( I will write the review soon!!) ‚Äì but suddenly it was gone and killed by excitement !! hahaha‚Ä¶.\n\nAt first the concert hall was empty , and we still sat based on arrangement but when Passion Pit came on stage with Take a Walk as the first song, everybody went crazy, standing and dancing all around !! hahahaha‚Ä¶. The Reeling was the second song, and I was surprised that Kat already left me and Titis ‚Äì she jumped out from the seat and run to the festival area hahahaha‚Ä¶. And we followed her, escape from the guard while she didn‚Äôt watch us ‚Ä¶\n\nYess, its like Hipster‚Äôs Dream come true ahahaha.. They were amazing ‚Ä¶ I should say that this concert was attractive , we danced all night long and sing a long, esp when they performed Let Your Love Grow Tall and My Fav song, Carried Away !!\n\nIts hard to take one‚Äôs eyes off Angelakos, who paced the stage restlessly throughout the 70-minuse show! Yess, I caught up some pitchy voices from him during the performances but he was able to cover it with his stage act.\n\nThey had 2-encore song -> Mirrored Sea and Little Secret ‚Äì gosh this was the best because just like Little Secret song lyrics, people jump out Higher and Higher!! Ahhaaha\n\nBefore the end of my article, this is the set list from their concert :\n\n‚Ä¢ Take a walk ‚Äì Gossamers\n\n‚Ä¢ The Reeling ‚Äì Manners\n\n‚Ä¢ Moth‚Äôs Wing ‚Äì Manners\n\n‚Ä¢ To Kingdom Come ‚Äì Manners\n\n‚Ä¢ Let Your Love Grow Tall ‚Äì Manners\n\n‚Ä¢ Carried Away ‚Äì Gossamers\n\n‚Ä¢ To Kingdom Come ‚Äì Manners\n\n‚Ä¢ Live to tell the tale ‚Äì Chunk of Change\n\n‚Ä¢ Eyes as candles ‚Äì Manners\n\n‚Ä¢ Constant Conversation ‚Äì Gossamers\n\n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôll be Alright ‚Äì Gossamers\n\n‚Ä¢ Better Things ‚Äì Chunk of Change\n\n‚Ä¢ Its not my fault, I am Happy ‚Äì Gossamers\n\n‚Ä¢ Smile upon me ‚Äì Chunk of Change\n\n‚Ä¢ Sleepyhead ‚Äì Manners\n\n‚Ä¢ Encore :\n\n1. Mirrored Sea ‚Äì Gossamers\n\n2. Little Secret ‚Äì Manners\n\nToo bad they didn‚Äôt play my fav songs : Love is Greed and On My Way huhuh ‚òπ\n\nSingapore crowd was nice, it was not too crowded but they respect the band, I must say that Indonesian people more hysterical when watching concert esp. the girls who always screams loudly hahaha‚Ä¶ In Singapore, people more calm but they active to give appreciation for the performer..\n\nIn terms of sound quality and time management, Singapore is way better than my country ! The show only late for 15 minutes , sound quality also stable, in balance so it didn‚Äôt annoy the audiences‚Ä¶\n\nAt the end of the show, Nate ‚Äì the drummer threw his drumstick and you know what , my friend Kat got it hahahahaha‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ woow, it was sooo lucky, we even didn‚Äôt realize it before when the stick dropped near us..\n\nThe best part was meet & greet with Passion Pit, they were willing to sign the Gossamers CD for us.. Finally, I can talk to them and shake hands!! Ahahahah, and they were amazed when I told them that I came from Indonesia haha‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know maybe they surprised that there are also Indonesian people who find their music attractive (in fact, so many Jakarta people loves your music guysss !, you should come here‚Ä¶. !!)\n\nThank you, Passion Pit‚Ä¶ Thanks for the great concert .. it was one of the best experiences to finally watch you and meet you personally guys..\n\nI got sooooo carried away by youuu , Passion Pit\n\n@Rinda_nda\n\nFor all my friends know that I am definitely not a Justin Bieber Fans, I barely know his songs. But this little young man has stolen my attention since the the first time he‚Äôs famous worldwide. What I really observed about this pop-idol is his career journey and of course the power of his fan based, Belieber!\n\nI started to read a lot about Bieber when I accidentally watched his documentary movie, Never Say Never in HBO. One insight that I got from that movie is what a hard worker he is! Sometimes people my age usually mocking him because we think that he is not that talented and just selling his boyish face to the audiences, but when I saw this movie, I found him a mature young man, respectful, tenacious and he doesn‚Äôt take himself too seriously.\n\nYou should admit that he is the most popular teen male singer for now. He sold out Madison Square Garden Tickets for only 22 minutes ‚Äì as you know mostly a legend musician like U2, Michael Jackson who was successful to perform in Madison Square Garden. Justin also Digital Most Famous Celebrity , just see the followers of his twitter/ Facebook Fans and of course YouTUbe !\n\nHe has a cinderfella story ‚Äì from an ordinary teenager from Canada to a most wanted singer who was able to perform in Madison Square Garden. He was found on YouTube and now he is the most high gross teen pop singer worldwide.\n\nOne thing that attracts me is how he‚Äôs engaging with his fans. His fans know his story, they feel they know him well and feel special bonding with his story ‚Äì ‚Äúif it could happen to him, it could happen to me ‚Äì NEVER SAY NEVER!‚Äù (okay, Honestly,I actually a little but forget ‚Äì hows the melody of this song hahaha ) it‚Äôs the refrain from his songs that always repeated by him during his concert.\n\nBack to Never Say Never quotes ‚Äì I found it interesting. Yeah , I know its only a song but look beyond the song and lyrics (forget it that its Bieber song) ‚Äì we often forgot to Never say never in our daily basis ‚Äì to our self, to our family or relatives. Its simple, its actually the way you treat and believe with your self. We forgot that we should have self-respect to our self and honor our self more than it supposed to be. That‚Äôs what I see from Little Justin and his team success.\n\nHis music promoter, Scooter Braun said that a lot of people hesitates that this Bieber Fever would last longer, it just interim. But Braun said that all doubt and hesitations ‚Äì is what make them stronger. We find it challenging if people under estimate us- so we have a full bank of motivation to perform. It Simply Never Say Never ‚Äì just fight it forever!\n\nWell, even though I am not a listener and a fan of Justin (but I love his fragrance product, Someday ‚Äì it smells nice! Hahaah ), but thanks to remind me to stand up for my self and respect my ability to success. I think Justin Bieber is a great influence from all pre-teen and teenager in the world ‚Äì I hope he is better not turning to another Britney Spears or Lindsay Lohan.\n\nSo people, Never Say Never ‚Äì if you haven‚Äôt tried it !\n\n@rinda_nda\n\nCurrently I am crazy about one Music Apps , its called SOUNDTRACKING , I have used it for a while, and cant get enough of it. Based on that apps, I want to create theme for my Blog, its called Soundtrack of The Day , and I will describe the song, history and also what emotion that I felt on that day. Hopefully, I am able to commit to write it everyday, but if its not, please understand my bad ! hahahahaha\n\nMy soundtrack of the day is I only have eyes from you by The Flamingos ! This song is playing on my mind for today, even though I was listening to other song, this one still haunting me hahahaha ‚Ä¶.\n\nYou might have heard this song a lot, coz mostly Standard Jazz Band in club or caf√© usually sing this in their performances. One of the most famous version of this song is Jammie Cullum version , but my favourite is Harry Conick Jr‚Äô version.\n\nThis song actually not a jazz song, its definitely a ballad song for movie soundtrack , Dames which originally sing by The Flamingos.\n\nWho‚Äôs the hell is The Flamingos ? They are one of the great doo ‚Äì woop quartet. Doo woop is a vocal based ‚Äì rhytm & blues music that develop first in African ‚Äì American Community. Sample of a Doo Woop artist is The Chords (who sing Shhh Boom ‚Äì The Cars Soundtrack) and of course The Supreme ‚Äì who inspired DreamGirls Movie !\n\nThis song has a thousand cover version with a various artist start from Frank Sinatra, Jammie Cullum, Harry Conick Jr, Corrine Bailey Rae, even non-mainstream & electronic artist like BECK !\n\nOne thing that I love about this song is, the ambiance! Its soft, smooth and sexy. It drives you away from your hectic day, this song is already on my list for my wedding hahahaha . The lyrics might be a little bit too poetic but its simple and easy to understand.\n\nWell, today was an absurd day for me, but this song make me dream away and fly to neverland!\n\nTrust me , if you get mad or feel negative emotion, just listen to your soundtrack of the day and it will be your anchor to forget all your problem !\n\nLife is surprisingly simple , by the way\n\n@rinda_nda\n\nFor about 3 months a go, I have watched American Idol regularly again, and its season 11 already! I know its super duper too late, yeah I know its my bad huhuhu.. I missed the momentum but I think I never too late to review and embrace someone‚Äôs music ability esp. I am one of a MUSIC FREAK , its mandatory for me to do that ..\n\nI have love and hate relationship with this show, sometimes I hate it a lot but inside I am addicted to it!\n\nI must say that this season is SPECTACULAR, so many amazing talents ‚Äì well its totally different with last very PREDICTABLE season 10, from the beginning I was bored to death with season 10\n\nWell, enough about this show, most of people already know what kind of show it is , I just want to talk about Phillip Phillips ‚Äì The WINNER ! One thing I should say that HE IS AMAZING! I really love Dave Matthews and this guy is a mix between Dave Matthews voice and Jonny Lang Guitar skill , DAMN its so PERFECT. First Audition in Georgia, Phillips sang Superstitious and Thriller ‚Äì it gave me goosy! hahaha\n\nDuring the audition, Phillip was very consistent and stands out among all the talents. He might doesn‚Äôt have a wide vocal range or perfect exquisite vocal technique, but He offers Quirkiness, Uniqueness, Unforgettable stage act and very cool vocal timbre. My Fav moment is when he sang in the group with HeeJun, Neco, etc ‚Äì He sang I only have eyes for you, it was a ballad song and usually people make a Jazz cover from that song, but he sang it beautifully with his style and tone. Again speechless!!\n\nThere was an episode with Stevie Nicks as the music mentor. Stevie Nicks is one of my Idol ‚Äì She was the leading Lady from Fleetwood Mac. One thing that I remember is what Stevie said about Phillip. She said that if Mick Fleetwood saw you before during my era, he would like you to join Fleetwood Mac to sing with Lindsay !! hahaha‚Ä¶. She even compared Phillip with Lindsay Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac leading Man)\n\nFor me, there were 3 favorite performances from Phillip (actually its hard to choose, coz all is good !!) First is when he sang Beggin from Frankie Valli , Time of the Season from The Zombies (also my favourite band ) and Still Raining from Jonny Lang !\n\nThis guy offers a new music vibe , original and so different with the other singer who offers karaoke standard performances. He has talent to play blues music with a alternative voice tone ‚Äì smooth but a lil bit strong ! that‚Äôs what makes him different with Colton Dixon (Another American Idol 11 contestant) ‚Äì Colton does not have signature voice and style, he is good looking and trendy but i dont know where is he going in music world ? ‚Äì he tends to do copycat of big rock artist\n\nI always curious what‚Äôs Dave Matthews opinion about him, and I found this article ! ‚Äú He should kick my ass (then) maybe I can retire and he can take over the band ‚Äú (Dave Matthews) hahahahahah ‚Ä¶.\n\nWell, now I am waiting for his new album, The world from the side o of the moon, he promoted it through his twitter regularly ! cant hardly wait .. Please keep your awesomeness and originality in your music, Mr. Phillips\n\n@rinda_nda"
