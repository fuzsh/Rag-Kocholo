        "text": "We already entered the second month of this year once again and this is also the month where every Indonesians is going to elect their new leader on presidential election. I have one say before you vote, remember who were you voting for and you don’t want another corrupt politician on the ballot again, do you?\n\nIn New Album on the Corner, we were breaking down several Indonesian albums that dropped by this month. It would be their revelations of their true colors of their albums. Whether it’s an album or extended play, we would check them out for their sounds.\n\n1. Titi DJ — 40\n\nTracklist :\n\nA Little Bit Of Light [ft. Stephanie Poetri]\n\nSAYAP-SAYAP CINTA\n\nMerah Delima\n\nHilang Sewindu\n\nBawa Cinta\n\nTOP FORTY\n\nMenemanimu Melenakanku\n\nKau Pujaan\n\n1234 5678\n\nTo Be Continued\n\nThere’s no doubt that Titi DJ is one of the notorious Indonesian diva who had an ups and downs chronicle as a solo artist since the 80’s. At the beginning of her music career, she had a hit or miss track records throughout the years. It wasn’t until 1999 when she gained her biggest momentum with her eighth album and that’s where she got catapulted into the spotlight. As we already know about this walking legend, she is one of the living diva to ever existed in Indonesia.\n\nTo celebrate her 40 years of musical milestone, Titi DJ decided to break an ice on a full scale mode with her newest album titled “40”. To put it specifically, she really does her own thing which isn’t too surprising to hear. Somehow on the other hand, she embraced a bit of mediocrity aspect at some occasion. She also bring two of her previous song material including “Bawa Cinta” from her sixth studio album and the other one is Mayang Sari’s song that was written by her. Didn’t raise any bar but a good thing to break the mold.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : SAYAP-SAYAP CINTA, Merah Delima, Hilang Sewindu, TOP FORTY, Menemanimu Melenakanku, Kau Pujaan\n\n2. Perveration — Putrefaction Of Infinite Apogee\n\nTracklist :\n\nBacterium Decomposition\n\nConsuming Maggots Seeds\n\nEviscerated Innards\n\nFestering Throat\n\nDamaging Excrement\n\nInfinite Apogee\n\nNecrocannibalism\n\nChaotic Spreading\n\nDevouring Voraciously\n\nAbominable Dismembered\n\nIn the outskirts of Kediri, Perveration came onto the surface with their gruesome music beyond their heaviness. This death metal duo appeared to displayed their brutal sonic direction in the early 2020’s with their debut album. Darkness, damnation, & emptiness were their main theme all along with the duo’s musicality which was beneath the underground.\n\n3 years after their debut album went out, Perveration released their sophomore album titled “Putrefaction Of Infinite Apogee”. Beside of how crude and bloody this album was, the band summoned their helluva sounds of gruesomeness. Although there are some flawed part that probably overshadowed the album’s true color, they were able to unleashed it out of their own dimension. So it’s not a bad effort but it wasn’t a bold statement to described this album.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Bacterium Decomposition, Consuming Maggots Seeds, Eviscerated Innards, Infinite Apogee, Chaotic Spreading\n\n3. Cakra Khan — DIVINE\n\nTracklist :\n\nBroken Symphony\n\nSalah Tapi Baik\n\nKepada Hati\n\nCahaya\n\nTennessee Whiskey\n\nTake The Pain\n\nTak Sejalan\n\nMemilih Dia\n\nComing Home\n\nNanti\n\nSehebat Apapun Cinta\n\nGet Together\n\nPersinggahanmu\n\nRindu Tak Bersuara\n\nKamu Adalah [ft. Ade Govinda]\n\nUnless you’re someone who grew up watching Inbox or Dahsyat while melayu pop genre was on its peak while on the brink of decline, your ears would eavesdropped when Cakra Khan who just came to the picture as one of newly-emerged male solo artist in the early 2010’s. His raunchy raw but melancholically soulful voice really blew people away and he positioned himself on the shade of spotlight.\n\nOut of nowhere and unbeknownst to others, Cakra Khan dropped the bombshell with his very new album titled “DIVINE”. This was his second album since 11 years after the release of his debut album and something a little bit different about this second album but it’s kinda interesting. An R&B leaning driven sound brought its new color at full stop. But at the same time, melancholy nuance remained felt strong & stand still despite new wave of elements flowed around this album. If you’re probably a fan of his music, this one is somewhat worth for you to listened and he does a bit of bold move to refresh his sonic direction.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Broken Symphony, Salah Tapi Baik, Kepada Hati, Cahaya, Take The Pain, Tak Sejalan, Memilih Dia, Coming Home, Nanti, Get Together, Persinggahanmu, Kamu Adalah\n\n4. After Nourway — Undelivered\n\nTracklist :\n\nMaybe\n\nNumb\n\nNo Good In Goodbye\n\nIsn’t It?\n\nHilang Rasa [ft. Ashira Zamita]\n\nIn the early 2020’s, a duo called After Nourway launched their milestone with modern pop genre. Taking notes from Coldplay, the duo has their strong interest in music and were determined to being on the playing field. Their second single really catapulted them into the mainstream territory and anyone started to look upon the duo. Because of their ongoing heat, Warner Music Indonesia took notice and signed them as one of their musical acts at their current roster lineup.\n\nAfter their three singles dropped by last year while under the umbrella of Warner Music Indonesia, After Nourway has finally opened their new year by unleashed their debut EP titled “Undelivered”. Each of these 5 songs from their EP represents each 5 stages of grief and they actually interprets this whole theme kinda well done. It was grey-ish at first but it progressed pretty much a bit of mellow and then ended up in a bittersweet deliverance. This EP demonstrates their modern pop sonic direction in a halfway through. Let’s just say the did a decent job effort and called it a day for a good while.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Numb, No Good In Goodbye, Isn’t It?, Hilang Rasa\n\n5. Febinda Tito — Romansa 3 Babak\n\nTracklist :\n\nSemau-maumu\n\nMeteorologi\n\nBerantakan\n\nAku Kau Sia Sia\n\nMengalah\n\nBukan Denganku\n\nMati Rasa\n\nHati Tak Sama\n\nSeperti Semula\n\nTak Lagi Lagi\n\nFebinda Tito had a great start in the early 2020’s as an upcoming musician. He began his music career independently and his music attracts so many people when his debut album came out in a daylight. While his popularity are on the verge of rising, it caught the attention from Warner Music Indonesia and he got a record deal from the major label. Ever since he signed to Warner Music Indonesia, his music got played on a wider scale alongside with a significant increase of followings.\n\nAs we already learned that Febinda Tito got a bunch of singles on the run by last year. So now on February, he dropped his second studio album titled “Romansa 3 Babak”. So basically, the album’s theme is based on romance novel in a musical interpretation. In the case of genre, pop was his primary genre. However, it can be also goes on two way street, whether it’s toward folk pop or pop rock. Not a best album but it’s such a fresh air to rethink the concept.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Semau-maumu, Meteorologi, Berantakan, Aku Kau Sia Sia, Mengalah, Hati Tak Sama\n\n6. The Bad Blues Conspiracy — The Bad Blues Conspiracy\n\nTracklist :\n\nRock N Roll\n\nMake Love In Tears\n\nThe Revolution Won’t Be Centralized [ft. Matter Mos]\n\nThe Blues\n\nLonely Man\n\nTownship [ft. Chevrina Anayang]\n\nHeart Breaker\n\nFire of Life\n\nI Want to F#NK You\n\nWuoohoo\n\nThe BBC\n\nWhat would happened if Arya Novanda being put on the same room with one member from Speaker First and one member from Kelompok Penerbang Roket? The answer is you get a fresh and newfounded supergroup blues rock band called The Bad Blues Conspiracy. Combining their variety strength, this trio unleashed their raw form of blues rock in authentic manner. They also has their own motto in just three words, bluesy, funky, & kinky.\n\nShortly after the new supergroup was established, The Bad Blues Conspiracy made their first big move in 2024 and released their debut album titled “The Bad Blues Conspiracy”. As bluesy as it can be or as raw as it can be, it’s a near heavily hypnotizing on the nearly entire run. Let’s not forget Arya Novanda’s guitar playing just set in on the full motion mode at several occasion. It could have been an absolute perfect unit but it’s an excellent first album to say at least.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Rock N Roll, Make Love In Tears, The Revolution Won’t Be Centralized, The Blues, Lonely Man, Heart Breaker, Fire of Life, I Want to F#NK You, The BBC\n\n7. Poetrow — ONOTAN\n\nTracklist :\n\nCHANGE\n\nILLUSION [ft. Nara]\n\nHELLO\n\nGIMME\n\nPESTA [ft. Keilandboi]\n\nMODE\n\nPoetrow is one of the upcoming new rapper to be on the run lately in 2023. Migrated from Kei Island to Yogyakarta, he paved his own thing at the hip-hop scene. He’s just only an another average rapper joe until Tuantigabelas appointed him as the featured artist for his single titled “Terbaik”. For a newcomer like himself, that collaboration song was only just begun.\n\nAfter his recent collaboration with Tuantigabelas, Poetrow released his very first album titled “ONOTAN”. The lyrical plot on this EP took place between his school years & the present days. On the output perspective, it was a hit or miss shot on a gray zone. But at the same time, his potential could be a big thing if he dive just a bit. Not excellent but not a bad EP at all.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : CHANGE, PESTA, MODE\n\n8. Refo Dan Fauna — Cerita Dari Teman-Teman di Krapela\n\nTracklist :\n\nKrapela Theme Song Versi Refo dan Fauna Life Action\n\nDari Tilang Turun Ke Hati\n\nAku Suka Sama Cowok India\n\nAku Suka Sama Kamu Wahai Lee Jin Ah (Sarangheyo Anyeonghaseyo)\n\nJidat Aku Jenong\n\nAku Wawancara Orang, Orangnya Ketiduran\n\nDitinggal Pak Bos Lagi Dinas\n\nKerja Lagi Revisi Lagi\n\nKetindihan Setan Pas Lagi Tidur\n\nBurungku Hilang\n\nSalah Jimat\n\nThere’s no doubt that Refo Dan Fauna would being spotlighted as one of the promising upcoming artist at its lowkey. The most unique thing about this musician is that he was an outsider musician and he shook so many people despite being a low profile artist himself. It’s pretty that he’s here to stay for good.\n\nA years after his latest EP went fly off the air, Refo Dan Fauna goes to full scale mode by releasing his first full-length studio album titled “Cerita Dari Teman-Teman di Krapela”. He made this entire album based on his friends & fans’ stories and turn it into a concept album. He delivered and interpreted the storytelling by the getgo. On the sound side, it can be smooth, subtle, or unexpectedly hook-ish. To put it mildly, this album is almost remarkably well done as if the creativity forces were still in charge.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Krapela Theme Song Versi Refo dan Fauna Life Action, Aku Suka Sama Kamu Wahai Lee Jin Ah (Sarangheyo Anyeonghaseyo), Jidat Aku Jenong, Aku Wawancara Orang, Orangnya Ketiduran, Ditinggal Pak Bos Lagi Dinas, Kerja Lagi Revisi Lagi, Ketindihan Setan Pas Lagi Tidur, Burungku Hilang\n\n9.

Borneboi, Slim Phi, Pandv]\n\nFreestyle (Skit)\n\nBetter Run\n\nAbah\n\nRest (Outro)\n\nDuring his high school years, Crazy Zal from Banjarmasin started off his music career as a rapper while focus on studying. This was his early period where he delved a bit into gangsta rap, G-funk, boom bap, and any other hip-hop subgenres. When pandemic broke out in 2020, he was recruited by WASAKA as the group’s member and this is the point where he ran his musical milestone professionally, so did with his solo career that follow suit by later.\n\nAs his reputation grew stronger throughout the years, Crazy Zal just finally launched his debut album titled “Rest”. There’s a lot variety of things going on, including its nuances and its elements. This album embodied a bit of oldheads spirit at the body of a newheads rapper on different time. There’s also a lot of mixed emotions from happy to anger and captured that feelings in many ways. This one is probably a gray-ish first album but not overexaggerated at least. The underline about this album is really decent by overall.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : ’Til I Win (Intro), Southride, Recognize, Dedicated, We Got the Flava, Abah, Rest (Outro)\n\n10. Aruma — Bertumbuh\n\nTracklist :\n\nRindu Berjatuhan\n\nEkspektasi [ft. Raim Laode]\n\nMuak\n\nHilang Kendali\n\nTunggulah Sebentar\n\nAs we already know right now, Aruma is currently a big thing as a newcomer on the heat zone and that zone in question was a handful of her first three hits at the jumpstart via major label. During her formative years, she developed her love for music and put a commitment into it as the whole. With her presence on social media, she demonstrated her musicality by covering various of songs that recently considered as popular.\n\nAfter having her momentum in AMI Awards 2023 plus winning her first award for the best newcomer, Aruma has finally dropped her first EP titled “Bertumbuh”. Even though this EP has 5 tracks only (including 2 new songs), she expressed her series of emotion with balladry approach but with curtain of chill & relaxed nuance. Probably her musicality kinda grew a bit at this point, would her sonic direction develop even more? It might be unsure but she’ll be here to stay for real good.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Rindu Berjatuhan, Ekspektasi, Muak, Hilang Kendali, Tunggulah Sebentar\n\n11. Sunwich — Apophenia\n\nTracklist :\n\nThe Bended Man\n\nMutamycete\n\nThe Reason Why\n\nTears Are Holding Me Tight\n\nHello Virgo!!\n\nFalse Expectation\n\nLoss and Regrets\n\nFold in Anathema\n\nDon’t Get to Know Me Too Well\n\nSunny Side Up\n\nSunwich is currently being considered as one of the heatseekers on the run throughout Asian continent. It’s an indie pop band that broke the surface of music scene with their fresh sound plus having a lot of mixed bags with all kinds of lyrics. Even though the band experienced its changing formation, they remained proactive more than ever.\n\nNow, the promise due has finally arrived and Sunwich released their brand new album titled “Apophenia”. This one is surprisingly cheerful for nearly the entire tracklist. Who could have guessed if this indie pop band did something different from each band members’ point of view. It just captured around their experience on a sight of their flowery sound. This album is their most exciting stuff to listened and it’s worth the wait for the whole momentum.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : The Bended Man, Mutamycete, The Reason Why, Tears Are Holding Me Tight, Hello Virgo!!, False Expectation, Loss and Regrets, Fold in Anathema, Sunny Side Up\n\n12.

Despite not being a proactive singer, she had her ability to developed her musicality on a thin line between pop, jazz, & folk as a whole. For the starter, she kicked her music career off as the singer and she also rolling the wheel with her band called Madame & Toean at one point. She just currently make her move on the surface in the early 2020’s.\n\nApparently out of the blues, Rahma Savitri decided to woke up and released her newest album titled “432”. Working together with Roedyanto, she tackled on mental health issue as the album’s main topic. Plus for the fun fact, the album’s title taken from the level amount of hertz frequency for meditation purpose and you can heard its harmonic sounds from that aspect. This one is very chill and steady but not even closed to perfection from the case scenario.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Saat Dalam Raga, Kala, Kasih, Rayakan, Sang Pencari Cahaya, Pulang (I’m Home)\n\n13. Jangar — Malam\n\nTracklist :\n\nArtileri\n\nTanah\n\nStress\n\nAdiksi\n\nJalan Pulang\n\nAda Lagi Yang Mati\n\nIn the late 2010’s, the facade of indie music in Indonesia is getting more wide open from every spectrum. One of the bands who fueled that escalation would have to be Jangar. At that time, this band from Denpasar was really hot as flame when they brought a unique heavy rock sound in 2016. Then 3 years later, they received even more popularity for their critically-acclaimed album titled “Jelang Malam” and more people start to look at them as one raw acts on the run, especially for their stage performance.\n\nThroughout the early 2020’s, Jangar did crafted their ammunition earlier and they finally released their new EP titled “Malam”. By this time, they covered one of Iwan Fals’ song titled “Ada Lagi Yang Mati” on this EP by doing their own rendition. The band still maintained their lyrics about a harsh adversary while dealing the whole thing in a struggle manner. Somehow their raunchy sound still fits that vicious atmosphere. They’re still got it, just not almost too messy for most of the time.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Tanah, Stress, Adiksi, Jalan Pulang, Ada Lagi Yang Mati\n\n14. RYO — DANG! RYO\n\nTracklist :\n\naBoUt u\n\nDalam Diam [ft. Limbx]\n\nRahasia [ft. Noya Clarissa]\n\nBetrayal\n\nIn the very grey-ish surface of Indonesian music, you’ll usually encountered every newcomer to ever appeared from the obscured place in most cases. RYO is one of the newcomer who just entered the field last year. She had been cooking around the underground when her music career took off. With her electro-pop soundalike sonic direction, she gave something a bit of flamboyant to its paperwork. Even at its obscurity level as the newcomer, she came out as fresh as lowkey rookie.\n\nAfter her several singles went out on the low area, it is the time for RYO strike her fully-loaded shot with her first EP titled “DANG! RYO”. By this time around her brand new EP, she added a nearly heavy dose of dangdut koplo element to its entirety of electro-pop sound and the output was really something else different from what’s had been there on her catalogue. It’s pretty unusual or uncalled from her but it’s good to see her making a bold move to put herself out of the comfort zone.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Dalam Diam, Rahasia\n\n15. Caessaria — Messtorius\n\nTracklist :\n\nNo Regret\n\nLegenda Si Besar Dan Si Kecil [ft. Anji]\n\nMemeluk Badai\n\nThe Hardest Thing\n\nCintaku Tak Bercanda\n\nHambar\n\nMessloverius\n\nCloser [ft. Winky Wiryawan]\n\nLebur [ft. Sara Wijayanto]\n\nAlien & Sun\n\nKelambu Rindu\n\nSemesta Bercerita\n\nMeneduhkan Luka\n\nRenjana\n\nHeartless\n\nIf you ever goofing around for a long time to think about what’s new from industry plant, you won’t need to look further than one particular dream pop band from Bandung named Caessaria. This band just entered the radar back in 2020 at first and they took off in a usual jumpshot in the early 2020’s. Alongside with being signed to Musica Studio’s, they landed their first score with their debut EP in 2022 and it became clear that the band was more than ready to set ablaze.\n\nSince their first EP got already out by two years ago, finally and at last Caessaria released their first full-length studio album titled “Messtorius”. This is where the band proven their nerve to fight the main flow and breaking some new ground on this album. They also got a handful featured artists such as Anji, Winky Wiryawan, & Sara Wijayanto. So far and so forth, this one is probably had more wiser work from both input & output perspective.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : No Regret, Memeluk Badai, Cintaku Tak Bercanda, Hambar, Messloverius, Closer, Lebur, Kelambu Rindu, Semesta Bercerita, Renjana"
