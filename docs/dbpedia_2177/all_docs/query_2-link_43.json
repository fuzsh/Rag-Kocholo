        "text": "2. Costume The Indie/Electro genre is famous for it’s eccentric and exiting clothing, our artist, Woodkid is renowned as a global style icon and clothing is an important part of both genres helping to establish target audience and genre convention. Below are some current trends and styles found in the genre represented by similar Indie/Electro artists. We may choose to include some similar items to help appeal to target audience and establish the indie/Electro genre within our music Video/Digipack. Nike Air Max: The vintage feel of most indie clothing crosses over the Snapback cap: both indie/electro musicians and music video’s. Originating from the Extremely popular in 90’s street scene Air Max One’s are now the leading footwear choice current UK streetwear in the indie genre and will hopefully be included in our music video to appeal to our target audience. Yoann Lemoine (Woodkid) Vintage shirts: The vintage feel of footwear crosses over onto shirts also, here are some popular vintage shirts-\n\n3. Lighting Lighting affects the way a music video is conveyed to the audience, for example a Heavy Metal or Hip/Hop video would conventionally have very low, natural to reinforce the dark themes of the genres. Whereas more positive, mainstream genres such as pop and dance traditionally use high, artificial lighting to emphasise the beauty of the lead singers or to help portray the positive vibes of the artist and video. Hip/Hop: Extremely low lighting reinforces dark themes of hip/hop Pop: High level natural lighting creates more positive view of lead signer and genre and emphasises the aggressive nature of the artist emphasises sex appeal Electro (our genre): The futuristic, retro feel of many electro music video’s is down to the trippy, luminous lighting involved. The dark background contrasts with the bright phosphorescent colours create a mysterious, techno environment. We aim to use a similar effect in our music video."
