        "text": "Various radio stations can be received on radios in most vehicles in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. They act as the game's soundtrack and can also be heard in the Audio menu, while the game is paused. Many of the songs appear on cutscenes, and some songs are programmed to be played on certain parts of a mission; for example, Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" starts to play when the player enters their first vehicle at the start of the game. Emergency vehicles are equipped with a police radio specially recorded for the game, which was a departure from previous games in the series.\n\nThe arrangement of the soundtrack of GTA Vice City was a big move on the part of Rockstar Games: unlike previous games in the series, which relied to a great extent in original creations, GTA Vice City has an overwhelming majority of licensed content, with just five original songs.\n\nMost radio stations play a mixture of music, DJ chat, and spoof advertising. The stations each reflect one style of music intended to evoke the atmosphere of the time. The bulk of the soundtrack consists of contemporary 1980s music, but also includes music from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nSeveral of the stations also reappear in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, which is a direct prequel to the game.\n\nAn extensive 7-CD Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Official Soundtrack Box Set was released containing music from the game's radio stations, while a shorter Greatest Hits compilation CD was also released.\n\nOn December 6, 2012, GTA Vice City was released on iOS and Android to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary. However, over the years, song licenses expired, and therefore some songs were removed from these versions of the game. The same songs are missing from the game re-releases as a PS2 Classic on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, as well as The Definitive Edition. The only station to retain its original soundtrack was Wave 103.\n\nThere are ten radio stations, with one custom station modified by the player. The songs are listed in the same order as they appear in the game manual. Authors of the original songs are listed aside the song title in superscript. Please select a station to jump to its section.\n\nItalicized songs with * are missing from all game releases which came after December 2012.\n\nRadio Stations[]\n\nWildstyle[]\n\nWildstyle is hosted by Mr. Magic and plays hip hop and electro.\n\nTrouble Funk – \"Pump Me Up\" (1980)\n\nDavy DMX – \"One for the Treble (Vocal Mix)\" (1984)\n\nCybotron – \"Clear\" (1983)\n\nHashim – \"Al-Naafiysh (The Soul) (B-Side Version)\" (1983)\n\nHerbie Hancock – \"Rockit\" (1983) *\n\nAfrika Bambaataa and The Soul Sonic Force – \"Looking for the Perfect Beat\" (1983) *\n\n2 Live Crew – \"Get It Girl\" (1986)\n\nRun-D.M.C – \"Rock Box\" (1984)\n\nMantronix – \"Bassline (Club Version)\" (1985)\n\nTyrone Brunson – \"The Smurf\" (1982) *\n\nWhodini – \"Magic's Wand\" (1982)\n\nZapp & Roger – \"More Bounce to the Ounce\" (1980)\n\nGrandmaster Flash and the Furious Five – \"The Message\" (1982)\n\nKurtis Blow – \"The Breaks\" (1980)\n\nMan Parrish – \"Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don't Stop) (The Unauthorized Acid House Remix)\" (1982/1988)\n\nFlash FM[]\n\nFlash FM is hosted by Toni, and plays pop.\n\nHall and Oates – \"Out of Touch\" (1984)\n\nWang Chung – \"Dance Hall Days\" (1982)\n\nMichael Jackson – \"Billie Jean\" (1982) *\n\nLaura Branigan – \"Self Control\" (1984)\n\nGo West – \"Call Me\" (1985)\n\nINXS – \"Kiss the Dirt (Falling Down the Mountain)\" (1985)\n\nBryan Adams – \"Run to You\" (1984)\n\nElectric Light Orchestra – \"Four Little Diamonds\" (1983)\n\nYes – \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" (1983)\n\nThe Buggles – \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" (1979)\n\nAneka – \"Japanese Boy\" (1981)\n\nTalk Talk – \"Life's What You Make It\" (1986)\n\nThe Outfield – \"Your Love\" (1985)\n\nJoe Jackson – \"Steppin' Out\" (1982)\n\nThe Fixx – \"One Thing Leads to Another\" (1983)\n\nLionel Richie – \"Running with the Night\" (1983) (PS2 and The Definitive Edition only)\n\nK-Chat[]\n\nK-Chat is a celebrity talk station hosted by Amy Sheckenhausen.\n\nThe following persons are interviewed:\n\nJezz Torrent\n\nMichaela Carapadis\n\nPat \"Mr. Zoo\" Flannerdy\n\nGethsemanee Starhawk Moonmaker\n\nBJ Smith\n\nClaude Maginot\n\nThor\n\nFever 105[]\n\nFever 105 is hosted by Oliver \"Ladykiller\" Biscuit and plays disco, soul, funk and R&B.\n\nThe Whispers – \"And the Beat Goes On\" (1979)\n\nFat Larry's Band – \"Act Like You Know\" (1982)\n\nOliver Cheatham – \"Get Down Saturday Night\" (1983)\n\nPointer Sisters – \"Automatic\" (1983)\n\nRené & Angela – \"I'll Be Good\" (1985)\n\nMary Jane Girls – \"All Night Long\" (1983)\n\nRick James – \"Ghetto Life\" (1981)\n\nMichael Jackson – \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" (1982) *\n\nEvelyn \"Champagne\" King – \"Shame\" (1977)\n\nTeena Marie – \"Behind the Groove\" (1980)\n\nMtume – \"Juicy Fruit\" (1983)\n\nKool & the Gang – \"Summer Madness\" (1974)\n\nIndeep – \"Last Night a D.J.

It has only one program, called Pressing Issues, which is hosted by Maurice Chavez. The two station supervisors, Jonathan Freeloader and Michelle Montanius, appeal listeners for money funding during breaks. Each segment focuses on a particular issue, with Chavez chairing a discussion on the issue between several guests with different backgrounds, points of view or approaches.\n\nThree such issues are broadcast within the game. They are:\n\nMorality (guests: Pastor Richards, Jan Brown, Barry Stark)\n\nPerception and Positive Thinking (guests: Konstantinos Smith, Jeremy Robard, Jenny Louise Crab)\n\nPublic Safety (guests: Alex Shrub, Callum Crayshaw, John F. Hickory)\n\nRadio Espantoso[]\n\nRadio Espantoso is a Spanish-language radio station hosted by Pepe and plays Latin jazz, mambo, son, salsa and Latin funk.\n\nTranslations for the titles, at the side, in superscript.\n\nCachao – \"A Gozar Con Mi Combo\" (Let's Rejoice With My Combo) (1994)\n\nAlpha Banditos – \"The Bull is Wrong\" (Stuart Ross)\n\nTres Apenas Como Eso – \"Yo Te Miré\" (I Saw You) (Craig Conner)\n\nDeodato – \"Latin Flute\" (1973)\n\nMongo Santamaría – \"Mama Papa Tú\" (Mom, Dad, You) (1969)\n\nMongo Santamaría – \"Me and You Baby (Picao y Tostao)\" (Chopped and Toasted) (1969)\n\nMachito and his Afro-Cuban Orchestra – \"Mambo Mucho Mambo\" (Mambo Lots of Mambo) (1952)\n\nUnaesta – \"La Vida Es Una Lenteja\" (Life Is A Lentil) (Craig Conner)\n\nLonnie Liston Smith – \"Expansions\" (1975)\n\nIrakere – \"Añunga Ñunga\" (1980) (Incorrectly credited in the manual as \"Aguanile\") *\n\nDeodato – \"Super Strut\" (1973)\n\nXavier Cugat and his Orchestra – \"Jamay\" (Nahuatl word, means \"adobe crafting place\") (1955)\n\nBenny Moré – \"Maracaibo Oriental\" (Eastern Maracaibo) (1958)\n\nTito Puente – \"Mambo Gozón\" (Enjoyable Mambo) (1958)\n\nEmotion 98.3[]\n\nEmotion 98.3 is hosted by Fernando Martinez and features soft pop, power ballads and soft rock.\n\nForeigner – \"Waiting for a Girl Like You\" (1981)\n\nKate Bush – \"Wow\" (1978) *\n\nSqueeze – \"Tempted\" (1981)\n\nREO Speedwagon – \"Keep On Loving You\" (1980)\n\nCutting Crew – \"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\" (1986)\n\nRoxy Music – \"More Than This\" (1982)\n\nToto – \"Africa\" (1982)\n\nMr. Mister – \"Broken Wings\" (1985)\n\nJohn Waite – \"Missing You\" (1984)\n\nJan Hammer – \"Crockett's Theme\" (1986)\n\nNight Ranger – \"Sister Christian\" (1983)\n\nLuther Vandross – \"Never Too Much\" (1981)\n\nWave 103[]\n\nWave 103 is hosted by Adam First, and features new wave, synthpop and post-punk.\n\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood – \"Two Tribes\" (1984)\n\nSigue Sigue Sputnik – \"Love Missile F1-11\" (1986)\n\nGary Numan – \"Cars\" (1979)\n\nThe Human League – \"(Keep Feeling) Fascination\" (1983)\n\nBlondie – \"Atomic\" (1979)\n\nNena – \"99 Luftballons\" (1983)\n\nKim Wilde – \"Kids in America\" (1981)\n\nTears for Fears – \"Pale Shelter\" (1983)\n\nCorey Hart – \"Sunglasses at Night\" (1983)\n\nABC – \"Poison Arrow\" (1982)\n\nA Flock of Seagulls – \"I Ran (So Far Away)\" (1982)\n\nThe Psychedelic Furs – \"Love My Way\" (1982)\n\nAnimotion – \"Obsession\" (1984)\n\nSpandau Ballet – \"Gold\" (1983)\n\nThomas Dolby – \"Hyperactive!\" (1984)\n\nRomeo Void – \"Never Say Never\" (1981)\n\nMP3 Player/Tape Deck[]\n\nGTA Vice City allows players to play their songs in the PC, Xbox and iOS ports of the game. This custom radio station is named \"MP3 Player\" in the PC port, \"Tape\" in the Xbox port, and \"Tape Deck\" in the iOS port.\n\n\"MP3 Player\" only supports .ogg and .mp3 music formats (as well as shortcuts to those types of files). Tracks are played in alphabetical order according to their file names and cannot be skipped. Inserting custom music into \"MP3 Player\" consists simply of placing music files into the \"mp3\" folder located within the primary game folder (i.e. Program Files\\Rockstar Games\\Grand Theft Auto Vice City\\mp3). For the Xbox version, a CD must be installed into the console's hard drive. The logo of \"MP3 Player\" is just a \"palette swap\" of the logo of the \"MP3 Player\" custom station from GTA III.\n\n\"Tape\" requires the player to copy the songs from an audio CD to the Xbox in the \"Music\" menu of the original Xbox Dashboard[2], so that the game can read the songs from the Xbox hard drive. After that, the songs can be played in the game from a common vehicle changing the radio station until they reach \"TAPE\", also, the player can change the music in the game with the D-pad.\n\n\"Tape Deck\" requires the player to create a music playlist on their iOS device named \"VICECITY\", and add songs to that playlist. After that's been done, they must start up the game, be in any civilian vehicle, and keep changing the radio station until they reach \"Tape Deck\", which is between Wave 103 and \"Radio Off\".\n\nOther Songs[]\n\nThe version of \"Al-Naafiysh (The Soul)\" by Hashim used in the third GTA Vice City trailer is the \"A-Side\" version, which isn't the version used in-game.\n\nA number of other songs can be heard during mission cutscenes. These songs are not featured on any of the game's radio stations.\n\nModern English – \"I Melt with You\" (1982) (featured during the third Back Alley Brawl cutscene)\n\nLos Super Seven – \"Compay Gato\" (2001) (featured during the Naval Engagement cutscene)\n\nLos Super Seven – \"Campesino\" (2001) (featured during the Trojan Voodoo cutscene)\n\nAl Di Meola – \"Ritmo De La Noche\" (1982) (featured during the Bar Brawl scene)\n\nBig Country – \"In a Big Country\" (1983) (featured during the first cutscene of The Driver, original PS2 version only; replaced by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's \"The Message\" in all subsequent versions)\n\nWhodini – \"The Freaks Come Out at Night\" (1984) (featured during The Job cutscene)\n\nBlue Öyster Cult – \"Burnin' for You\" (1981) (featured during the Boomshine Saigon cutscene)\n\nAdditionally, the European edition of the Flash FM soundtrack CD contains the following songs, which do not actually appear in the game:\n\nGlenn Frey – \"Smuggler's Blues\" (1984)\n\nToto – \"Hold the Line\" (1978)\n\nBoys Don't Cry – \"I Wanna Be a Cowboy\" (1985)\n\nNon-Selectable Radio Station[]\n\nOne radio station, Vice City News, was due to appear in the game as a news radio station but was dropped during development. Despite this, the VCN building and Mavericks still appear in the final version of the game.\n\nCommercials[]\n\nCommercials in GTA Vice City were greatly expanded from the commercials of the previous game. The biggest appeal of the commercials in Vice City is that for the first time in the series Rockstar could produce commercials that dealt with an earlier era, here showcasing the typical vibe and mindset of people and media of the 1980s. Later games in the series that were set in an earlier period would follow this model.\n\nDue to being the first game made in the 3D Universe that was set in an earlier era, Rockstar had enough technological advances to showcase the music, clothes, atmosphere and thus, the typical commercials of the 1980s. There are references to relevant topics of the period, such as hair products, the Red scare, Japanese car companies winning the American market and early home consoles that could bring the quality of arcade machines to the living room.\n\nSome products advertised are: \"Ammu-Nation\" (the firearms store that is \"leading the war against communism\" and that has film festivals where they \"screen the documentary \"Red Dawn\"), \"Yuppie and the Alien\" (a \"Miami Vice\" meets \"ALF\" police drama that teams up a human cop and an alien \"that could vaporize dissidents in Alpha Centauri but in this precinct [he has to] do it by-the-book\") and the Domestobot (a domestic helper robot for people that tried hiring a nanny but desisted after she wanted health insurance).\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe original soundtrack featured 103 songs; 1983 was the most represented year, with 21 songs featured.\n\nIt is worth noting that, while there where previous inroads in making stations with licensed content (Grand Theft Auto: London had an array of 1960s Italian films soundtracks and reggae, and Grand Theft Auto III had electronic, rap, dub and 1980s pop), that was nothing on the scale and depth of the soundtrack of GTA Vice City, with hits well-known by the mainstream public and in a large quantity in every station.\n\nThe game consolidated the use of an original police radio track created especially for it. Previous games in the series used a generic police track used in countless films, series and games (\"5 George K, number 30 Broad Street\" is said in the track), with the exception of GTA London (which used an original police track with British accents and references to locations in London). Since GTA Vice City, all the GTA games that have included a police track have used a track created especially for that game.\n\nThe radio tuning sound effects are snippets from various tracks from GTA III.\n\nFor example, one of the snippets heard when tuning the radio is a fragment from the Dormatron commercial in GTA III where the woman says \"strap in your arms and legs\".\n\nThe only anachronistic songs given the 1986 setting are Cachao's \"A Gozar Con Mi Combo\" (1994), Man Parrish and Michael Gray's \"The Unauthorized Acid House Remix\" of \"Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don't Stop)\" (original came out in 1982, remix in 1988), and two songs that are not included in any radio and can only be heard in certain cutscenes: Los Super Seven's \"Compay Gato\" and \"Campesino\" (both from 2001).\n\nWhodini's \"The Freaks Come Out at Night\" can be heard in a cutscene but is not included in any of the game's radios.
