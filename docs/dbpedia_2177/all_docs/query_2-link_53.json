        "text": "The aim of this dissertation is to identify how the theory of cultural industry applies to the Korean pop music industry. It argues that K-pop is not only a perfect fit for the Frankfurt school’s theory, but a continuation of it in a manner that was not predicted. It draws on theories of cultural commodification, the reduction of art into a product and the standardisation of popular music using selected key examples in K-pop itself. These examples include several groups, but primarily the three founders of the three most successful K-pop production houses. It also identifies how Lee Soo-man’s practice of “cultural technology” became the blueprint for the K-pop industry as a whole in the early 2000s, leading it to reach substantial international success by the end of the decade. This dissertation concludes that the K-pop industry makes no effort to hide its purely capitalist motivation, and that its success is based primarily on such business decisions. It also concludes that the consumers of K-pop have effectively been conditioned to expect certain behaviour from their chosen idols and agencies as they derive enjoyment from the capitalist venture of purchasing and supporting them – as the theory of cultural industry identified in the 1940s.\n\nDrawing on qualitative interviews with Canadian-based K-pop (contemporary South Korean “idol pop” music) fans, this study discusses how transnational fans experience and interpret K-pop as a form of cultural hybridity that facilitates global imagination. In particular, the study explores how fans consume and translate transnational pop music while engaging with different modes of global imagination in their everyday lives. In so doing, the study contributes to a better understanding of the text and context of K-pop from the lens of audiences’ negotiation with globalization.\n\nThe original contribution of this paper is to identify a list of success factors of K-pop music and to validate the reliability of the factors identified. A quantitative survey was tested on K-pop music fans to find how these factors affect the fans' general satisfaction. An online survey form was generated and posted on the social media. Fans were asked to rate sixteen statements in terms of how likely each statement describes the reasons they like K-pop music. At the end of the survey, fans were also asked to rate their general satisfaction of K-pop music. A total of 207 samples were collected, and data taken from the respondents were processed with factor analysis, reliability test, descriptive statistic test, and multiple regression tests to obtain results. All the sixteen statements were found to be highly reliable. The results also showed that three scales are important elements in increasing fans' general satisfaction, with Korean culture as the most important scale, followed by the talent, and performance scales. However, the idol aesthetic scale was found to be statistically insignificant in this study. Implications of K-pop music's crossover with other music genres are discussed in this paper.\n\nThe Korean Wave—otherwise known as Hallyu or Neo-Hallyu—has a particularly strong influence on the Middle East but scholarly attention has not reflected this occurrence. In this article I provide a brief history of Hallyu, noting its mix of cultural and economic characteristics, and then analyse the reception of the phenomenon in the Arab Middle East by considering fan activity on social media platforms. I then conclude by discussing the cultural, political and economic benefits of Hallyu to Korea and indeed the wider world. For the sake of convenience, I will be using the term Hallyu (or Neo-Hallyu) rather than the Korean Wave throughout my paper."
