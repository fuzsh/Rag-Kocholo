        "text": "Eee\n\nSweden2712 Posts\n\nI searched for it, but didnt find one so I'm going to start an \"Help me find this song\"-thread were people can help out each other find the name for songs etc.\n\nIt happens to a lot of us sometimes that we hear a song and memorize a bit of the lyric but either somehow memorize it wrong or google dosent find a match. Sometimes we see a musicvideo or a commerical, and try to find it trough what we remember of it.\n\nObviously i started this thread because in the last couple of years this has been a song that has been bugging me, and I dont know the name of it. It used to be on MTV all the time in the 90s (I was a kid back then, so i dont really remember a lot). It was kind of an really melancholic song with a looped piano beat (it was kind of an electronic song) and if I remember correctly the video had this little girl sitting in a car and looking out from her window.\n\nIf recall correctly this was shown on the at the same time as songs like \"Beastie Boys - Intergalactic\" and \"Daft Punk - Around the World\" (I might be wrong though!)\n\nCan someone help me?\n\n[UoN]Sentinel\n\nUnited States11320 Posts\n\nTL I need your help as well. I've been trying to find this one pop song, I think I heard it first May of 2011 and a few times after that, then when I started trying to look for it it disappeared.\n\nFemale singer, all I remember (and this is the part that got me looking) was the melody:\n\nA, A, G, F, E, D-E-F-E-D repeated 4 times.\n\nChord progression was Bb, Gm, Dm, F if I remember correctly.\n\nNo distinct lyrics, just female vocals. And here's a hastily assembled wav of the melody, at least what I think it sounds like\n\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?vehnq155a522vr2"
