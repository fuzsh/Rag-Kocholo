        "text": "For the very first Asian Issue of NYLON Indonesia, I decide to make a special feature about upcoming bands/musicians across Asia. As usual, beside some shortlist I already have in mind, I know I need to keep searching on the internet, listen to so many Soundcloud, Bandcamp, and blogs until I discovering new names I haven’t heard before. One of them is Spazzkid, the moniker of Mark Redito, the Philippines-born, L.A. based bedroom musician. At first, judging from his moniker, I though his work gonna sounds like Skrillex’s party banger anthem, but then when I play his single called “40 Winks” which samples the Memoryhouse cover of My Bloody Valentine’s “When You Sleep”, its a pure bliss, dreamy electropop which sounds more like Toro Y Moi than any stadium DJ.\n\nIt was love at the first heard, and obviously I immediately stalking his Bandcamp account and shamelessly downloading all 8 songs(its actually free downloadable, so…) on his Desire album. A solid electropop/ambience album, Desire is probably my favorite electronic album of this year, and a perfect reason to feature him on that special feature. Here’s my conversation with the man himself.\n\nHi Mark, how are you? Would you mind to introduce yourself?\n\nHey I’m Mark from Los Angeles and I make electronic music as “spazzkid.”"
