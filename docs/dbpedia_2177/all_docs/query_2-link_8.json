His new film called “Star Syndrome”, the story about the legend musician who attempted to make a comeback.\n\nWith the benefit of its gimmick purpose, the soundtrack for Star Syndrome is an album form. Which means it’s 11 tracks on this new soundtrack album. According to Gilang Dirga, the soundtrack had to be created in live recording and the result is vary for the most part. One parody over there, one jingle over there, & one acoustic piece over there, it’s all there just like the movie. By overall, it’s a decent soundtrack album and there’s nothing much to dive down a bit.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Simpang Siur [Jay and The Others], Labirin [Kezia Aletheia], Penjahat Cinta, Indonesian Dodol, Korea Afrika, Labirin (Ending Scene)\n\n2.

This band had already take part in this kind of revivalism on the full scale.\n\nSince their comeback single went already out to the surface, Deredia finally dropped their second album titled “Bianglala”. All of those 7 years in the making, it’s very worth to wait for. They were able to kept their oldies sonic direction on this album and the band did it at their own good ol’ fashion.

For Derai, they choose to be an alternative pop duo. The married couple from Sukabumi did know very well each other since high school years and the duo shared the same interest in music. Their debut album in 2021 really made the duo as the fresh stuff that popped out from that year.\n\nAlas, the payoffs for their promise went arrived and so Derai released their new EP titled “love in colors”. Taking inspiration from love language, they seemingly handled the love theme so easily on this EP. It covered several aspects like acts of service, receiving gifts, physical touch, words of affirmation, & quality time, it’s all there in each of 5 tracks. It’s a short solid EP, it’s worth to listen.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : On My Way, in my blood, Relate To You, Love Tale, minor\n\n5.

So far, he strummed his way throughout 2010’s with his first two albums on the map, making his name look knowable throughout Denpasar.\n\nFinally alas, Made Mawut has finished the preparation and he released his new album titled “Tradisi”. The acoustic blues-driven element that packed with social lyricism really solidified this album for the most part. It delved from one topic to another such as family, tradition, & politics.

This new EP from her is quietly jazzy in a very subtle way and it left no scratch at all. Although it’s only 4 songs, you can feel the freedom nuance on every spectrum, whether it’s the tunes or musical exploration. It’s a good start for an early bird musician like her to be this passionate.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : So Lucky to Be Young, Tempting, A Gifted Mind, Bye Bye Blackbird (Cover)\n\n8.

He’s the man who made the song about how to make chicken nuggets, it’s titled “Aku Udah Bisa Goreng Nugget Sendiri” and it’s really something else behind this whole outsider music lore.\n\nGoofy as usual, Refo Dan Fauna went to work again and by this time he released his new EP titled “Krisis Seperempat Dewasa”.

In order to do so, she released her new album titled “St. Bernadette”. This album revolves the various circles of life that always goes around. In her effort of exploration, she’s able to captured its dark nuance but it’s also raw in the gentle motion as possible.

For the inspiration, they were influenced by 80’s new wave & 60’s britpop to shaped their main musicality.\n\nSince Mandoors gave a handful of hints for their upcoming album, we would expect that the band is going to dropped their new album and they actually did the thing. After they finished their preparation, the band released their new album titled “SONE”. The dominance of electronic element felt really strong on this album and it’s slipped through the sonic direction of neo-psychedelic.

With the very help from Rendy Pandugo & Lafa Pratomo, this EP is a mixed bag between bedroom nuance and heartbreak lyricism but with a bit of humour slipped onto it. Although it’s not an excellent EP, at least this is a decent start for her as a solo artist.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Sinyal-Sinyal, Apa Mungkin, Satu Bulan\n\n13.

He made his first album with a fully loaded pop-leaning oriented and an honest lyricism. All of this came from his conscious mind to tell the whole tales that revolved around his life, especially on preparing to entering the age of 30’s.

With the mixture influence of 90’s & 2000’s American-British alternative rock, this band managed to get the proper sounds done right. It’s almost near to perfection.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Penjelajah Waktu, Segar, Serangga, Simpul, Penjara, Tak Berdaya, Jeruk, Nyali, Antrian, Pasien, Berkelana\n\n22.

Since arts was part of his pivotal life, he handled this kind of stuff professionally, whether it’s his music career or working as a proficient visual designer. This musician is probably one of the promising early bird to be on the run.\n\nAfter all of his singles being dropped throughout the early 2020’s, DEABDIL has finally released his very first album titled “4x3”. Let’s start with its music portion, every single tracks were almost heavily acoustic and even the ballad lyricism did fueled the album’s strength. But at one point, he just got sucked into hit or miss territory. By overall, it’s a decent start.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Lagu Tentang: HARI INI, TERUNTUK ______, SENIN, JEBAK, 1/2, ( titik temu ), bumi, bulan, matahari"
