        "text": "“What I like most about the Singapore music scene is that everyone has their own flavour. Our multiracial culture and bilingualism have something truly unique to offer to the world,” says Yung Raja. The 26-year-old hip-hop artiste’s view on home-grown music is reflective of his own trajectory—he first found fame with spitfire English-Tamil rap remixes that quickly went viral.\n\nToday, Yung Raja can be counted amongst the local artistes putting Singaporean music on the global map. As someone who grew up immersed in tunes emerging from our nation (from nostalgic National Day songs that he still knows by heart to genre-less tracks by experimental new artistes), what he is most excited for is the sheer potential of growth the local industry holds. “We are at an infantile stage right now, which is exciting because we are growing at an incredible rate.”\n\nAnd who better to introduce us to a crop of new and old native music than someone who is so hopeful about its future? Here are eight tracks that Yung Raja thinks anyone who wants to celebrate the beauty of the Singapore music scene needs to add to their playlist now."
