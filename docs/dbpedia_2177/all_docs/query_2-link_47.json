        "text": "Bad use of \"SIMULATION\" or \"SIMULATOR\" tag\n\nGuys... please can you STOP using the \"simulation\" or \"simulator\" tag for every game out there? I want to clean my steam browsing by filtering tags and it happens that the simulation tag is everywhere!\n\nCity building games? BOOM! simulator tag!\n\nAction shooter? BOOM! simulator tag!\n\nFarming RPG? BOOM! simulator tag!\n\nRTS old school? BOOM! now it is considered a f***ing SIMULATOR!!!!!\n\nSTOP USING THE SIMULATOR TAG FOR EVERYTING!! PLEASE LET IT BE USED FOR REAL SIMULATORS like flight simulators or some driving simulators.\n\nEDIT:\n\nIf any Steam dev happens to read this thread (I doubt this) please I ask you to take action by:\n\nA. Stop the people from creating tags and tagging. No more free will to create tags and use them to tag games.\n\nB. Narrow down to the core tags, that is leaving only the basic tags e.g strategy, simulation, rpg... etc they should be available only for steam staff, store mantainers and devs to tag their own games (which MUST be approved by steam staff).\n\nC. Create an internal set of rules defining how the tags will be used by devs and staff. Too diferent tags can´t be used in the same game (e.g Strategy, Sports) . Games should only have no more than one or two tags. Obviously they must make sense.\n\nD. TAG RULES:\n\n1 - Simulation tag should be used only for Flight Sims, Driving Sims and no more than that.\n\n2 - FPS are just FPS (even if they are realistic like ARMA series).\n\n3 - Strategy games are no more \"simulation\" games even if the name states so (e.g Simcity).\n\n3B-Strategy games tags should use the criteria of \"old school\" strategy games. Chess games for example would fall into the \"board game\" tag. Management and city building tags dilute into Strategy.\n\n4 - RPGs are just RPGs. Even if they are turn based with strategy elements or other elements. JRPGs (and many others that don´t come to my mind right now) dilute into the RPG tag.\n\n5 - Visual novels (in my opinion should be wiped off the entire store) should be in the visual novel tag. No RPG or Adventure should be mixed in them. (hell they should be banned.. they are not even games!)\n\n6 - Indie games. You can´t tag a game because it is indie. It MUST fall into one of the other main tags.\n\n7 - \"Living simulators\" are not a genre. They are either RPGS (e.g Stardew Valley) or Sandbox (The sims series). For the curious: why the difference? in Stardew Valley you follow a history line. In The Sims, you don´t. Also RPG means Rol Playing Game if you didn´t know.\n\n8 - Adult tagging. Adult games should only be used for explicit porn or erotic games (with \"erotic\" I mean a game that is based on nudity.\n\n8B- Games that have some kind of erotic moments in it storyline (no porn intended) are OUT of this tag and are rated with conventional R ratings in the steam store. They must be tagged according to its main genre.\n\n8C- Hentai tag (and alikes) is/are diluted into adult tag.\n\n8D- Puzzle games with erotic/pornographic images go into the adult tag. Not Puzzle.\n\n9 - Puzzle tag is strictly for puzzle games. No more puzzle tag in Zelda -esque games. THOSE ARE RPGS, REMEMBER.\n\n10 - \"Crafting\" games are reserved to Minecraft clones in all their flavors. (yeah millions of them lately).\n\n11 - \"Survival\" games could be mixed with \"Horror\" if the case happens.\n\n12 - Zombie tag.\n\n12B- If the game has zombies but you have to build a base to hold them in isometric view, it is a Strategy tag (thinking of Stronghold series here, something like that with zombies).\n\n12C- If the game has zombies and you have to survive see point 11.\n\n12D- If the game has zombies and you run like crazy with a gun top down view it is a shooter.\n\n12E- You can figure out the rest\n\n13 - Limit the \"Adventure\" tag. Remember, the plot should be used to tag only if the game cannot be tagged as any of the other primary tags. You will find that most of the now called \"adventure\" games are platformers disguised in 3D.\n\n14 - Sports. Driving games should NOT be tagged as sports. This is purely to mantain order in the tagging system. (I totally know that car racing are sports in real life, but please erase that from your mind, we are NOT using real life thinking to tag, it is purely to make easier the sorting, filtering and searching of the store; this applies to all the rules above by the way)\n\n15 - Users should STILL (yeah I know you can do it as it is now, thanks) be able to report bad tags."
