        "text": "Fans of Netflix's action-packed series La Casa de Papel/Money Heist know that besides the theme song \"My Life is Going On\" by Cecilia Krull, another tune that's heard frequently in the series is the Italian folk song \"Bella Ciao.\" Expect to hear it at least once in the show's fifth and final season, which premieres on Netflix on September 3.\n\nViewers are first introduced to the song in a scene with the Professor and his older brother Berlin—two of the show's main cast members. During one of Tokio's (Úrsula Corberó) narrations, she provides insight into the meaning—and explains how the thieves were first introduced to it.\n\n\"The life of The Professor revolved around one idea: Resistance. His grandfather, who had fought against the fascists in Italy, taught him the song—and he taught it to us,\" Tokio says on the show.\n\nIf viewers pay close attention, they'll notice the song is played during big plot points. In season 1, for example, the crew sings \"Bella Ciao\" when Moscow manages to forge a tunnel leading out of the Mint.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Money Heist's unofficial theme song.\n\n\"Bella Ciao\" was an Italian folk song that took on a political meaning.\n\nAccording to \"Bella Ciao\"—which translates to \"Goodbye Beautiful\"—is an Italian folk song that was used as an anthem for the anti-fascist resistance and sung worldwide as a hymn of freedom. And in Jerry Silverman's book , Silverman reports that it was first sung by women working in the fields of Northern Italy while trying to pass the time.\n\nDuring World War II, the lyrics changed to reflect \"the partisans fighting the fascists.\" It's the latter version, with lyrics infused with bravery and defiance, that is used on La Casa de Papel/Money Heist.\n\nIt became a song of solidarity during COVID-19.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, as much of the world quarantined due to the COVID-19 pandemic, \"Bella Ciao\" became a song of solidarity. With its Italian roots, many sung it in support of the Italian people who were at the epicenter of the pandemic. In one area in Germany, a neighborhood began singing the song in unison as their neighbors played live instruments:\n\nAnd on Instagram, several Italians shared clips singing along to the song from their balconies:\n\nThe song is one of many political symbols in Money Heist.\n\nWith all of the hidden messages that are packed in La Casa de Papel/Money Heist, it only makes sense that the music also sends a strong message. Another symbol in the series is the red coveralls the thieves wear. The color red was used to symbolize new liberties and freedoms during several revolutions around the world, according to Google Arts & Culture Center.\n\nThe Salvador Dalí mask is another prop that has a deeper meaning, too. The famed Spanish artist created much of his work during Zurich's Dada movement, which—according to the Tate—was about rejecting the modern capitalist society. With the theme of resistance so prominent in the series, it makes sense that \"Bella Ciao\" would have an intentional message, too. In fact, the season 3 tagline was \"join the resistance,\" and the last words spoken were \"Then, it was war.\"\n\nThe show features Manu Pilas's version of \"Bella Ciao.\"\n\nThere are countless renditions of \"Bella Ciao.\" If you're looking for the official version featured on the Money Heist soundtrack, it's the .\n\nCheck out the lyrics to \"Bella Ciao\" in Italian and the English translation.\n\nAfter enjoying the above clip of The Professor and Berlin singing \"Bella Ciao,\" you can check out the Italian lyrics and an English translation below.\n\nAccording to Genius, the Italian lyrics go:\n\nUna mattina mi son alzato\n\nO bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao\n\nUna mattina mi son alzato\n\nE ho trovato l'invasor\n\nO partigiano, portami via\n\nO bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao\n\nO partigiano, portami via\n\nChé mi sento di morir\n\nE se io muoio da partigiano\n\nO bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao\n\nE se io muoio da partigiano\n\nTu mi devi seppellir\n\nE seppellire lassù in montagna\n\nO bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao\n\nE seppellire lassù in montagna\n\nSotto l'ombra di un bel fior\n\nE le genti che passeranno\n\nO bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao\n\nE le genti che passeranno\n\nMi diranno «che bel fior.»\n\nQuesto è il fiore del partigiano\n\nO bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao\n\nQuesto è il fiore del partigiano\n\nMorto per la libertà\n\nIn English, here's how that translates, according to Genius:\n\nOne morning I awakened\n\nOh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!\n\nOne morning I awakened\n\nAnd I found the invader\n\nOh partisan carry me away\n\nOh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!\n\nOh partisan carry me away\n\nBecause I feel death approaching\n\nAnd if I die as a partisan\n\n(And if I die on the mountain)\n\nOh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!\n\nAnd if I die as a partisan\n\n(And if I die on the mountain)\n\nThen you must bury me\n\nBury me up in the mountain\n\n(And you have to bury me)\n\nOh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!\n\nBury me up in the mountain\n\n(And you have to bury me)\n\nUnder the shade of a beautiful flower\n\nAnd the people who shall pass\n\n(And all those who shall pass)\n\nOh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!\n\nAnd the people who shall pass\n\n(And all those who shall pass)\n\nWill tell me: \"what a beautiful flower\"\n\n(And they will say: \"what a beautiful flower\")\n\nThis is the flower of the partisan\n\n(And this is the flower of the partisan)\n\nOh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful!\n\nBye! Bye!\n\nThis is the flower of the partisan\n\n(And this is the flower of the partisan)\n\nWho died for freedom\n\nWant to listen all day? You can use \"Bella Ciao\" as a ringtone."
