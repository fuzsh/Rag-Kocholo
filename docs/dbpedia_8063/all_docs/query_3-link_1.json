        "text": "by Nathaniel R\n\nFor as long as we've been conscious of the movies, there's been a Woody Allen movie released every single year. That clockwork regularity ended with Wonder Wheel (2017). Amazon refused to release the completed picture A Rainy Day in New York which was meant for 2018 when the bad press kept mounting and some of that film's cast (Rebecca Hall and Timothée Chalamet, among them) disowned the film due to media pressure from the Farrow family's accusations against the director (unchanged since 1992 -- Woody was never officially charged after two separate investigations -- but revived very publicly/frequently since early 2014). The filmmaker and Amazon Studios are, last we heard, still in a pricey legal battle over their broken contract (even if you dislike Woody, one wonders what argument Amazon Studios could possibly come up with that's a winning one since they went into that contract with full knowledge of the accusations) but Woody has the greenlight from other sources for his 2020 picture, as yet untitled, which will begin filming in July...\n\nThe movie will use the San Sebastian Film Festival as its story backdrop and the plot involves an American husband and wife having separate affairs with a Spanish woman and a French film director while they fall in love with the fantasy of the movies all over again. So, a very Woody Allen plot... romantic affairs + movie magic. Given what's been going on with the press and American actors who worked with Woody Allen in the past, most of the cast are newbies to his filmography... though to be honest Woody had been drifting away from his old habit of reusing the same actors over and over again for quite some time anyway.\n\nThe new film will star Christoph Waltz and Gina Gershon (who we assume are playing the American couple though we might be wrong?), Spain's Elena Anaya (Wonder Woman, The Skin I Live In) who we assume is playing the Spanish woman the husband hooks up with), and longtime friend of Woody, Wallace Shawn (this will be his sixth Woody Allen picture). This has been an interesting trend in Woody's movies, for some time now, of drifting away from NYC as the mandatory setting.\n\nSpain's Sergí Lopez (Pan's Labyrinth) and France's most ubiquitous male star Louis Garrel will also appear so we assume one of them is playing the French movie director who the wife takes up with since both of those actors star in French movies, Garrel more frequently of course since he's actually a Frenchmen. Good cast but, as is with any movie, it all depends on execution on all fronts. We used to wonder if Woody's one a year work habit was damaging his work (given the depreciating returns since the mid 90s) but perhaps in this time away he's been taking more time than usual with the writing?\n\nMe Too and Time's Up do care about art and cultural legacy, especially since many of them are involved in the arts. They just don't think that artistic impact and cultural legacy excuse, negate, or justify criminal and abusive behavior. And since their basis for existence is combating the widespread abuse of women by men in power, they are bound by their purpose to side with the Farrows. There is enough data out there that acknowledges that women who come forward about abuse are often telling the truth, and often lose far more than they gain when they come forward.\n\nIn Allen's case, there's certainly room for doubt as Allen has never been formally indicted and there have been some disturbing allegations about Mia that haven't received that much attention. That Allen slept with and then married his ex-girlfriend's young daughter certainly doesn't help his case, especially since what he did is almost textbook grooming behavior, but just because he's guilty of one atrocious act doesn't mean he's guilty of the other. That is a sad, sad defense though.\n\nAt this point, I do side with Dylan Farrow, but not necessarily with Mia. Watching his movies makes me feel gross. I'm grateful I'm not a critic and that I don't have to pretend to even muster any sort of critical distance, and luckily, there are so many wonderful artists out there that there is always something really wonderful at the buffet: I won't miss the gefilte fish.\n\nClaran-I think the assumption is that Allen's films will do well enough internationally that they could quite frankly avoid a domestic success (or even release) and still do well enough to break a profit. Most of his recent films have almost entirely made their money in Europe, specifically Spain & France, and as a result this is probably not that bad of an investment.\n\nJust in general on this story I've thought about this many times, and while I find Woody Allen to be a sleaze at best, I'll never not love Annie Hall or Manhattan or Hannah and Her Sisters; separating the artist and the art is achievable here. I've seen pretty much every one of his films, and unlike most MeToo charges Allen's has at least seen a courtroom. I've also always been uneasy that Ronan Farrow, the man's son, has been lending the credibility he is due for going after people like Bill Cosby & Harvey Weinstein to go after Allen, disregarding how inappropriate and lacking in journalistic objectivity it is to pretend to be unbiased in defending a mother you love and a father you hate without perhaps handing this story off to a colleague who doesn't have the same emotional ties to the story.\n\n\"Rainy Day\" is also opening in Argentina in November. As to the purported abuse:\n\n* Mia Farrow had a huge ax to grind what with Woody's relationship with her adopted daughter.\n\n* Her son Moses has defended Woody Allen and said that Mia -who he says was physically abusive of her children- coached little Dylan about what to say. Why should we believe Dylan and not Moses?\n\n* If the coaching did take place at such a young age, with the passing of time the mind of the child may get mixed up as to what really happened. So I'm not blaming Dylan. She may be convinced.\n\n* Allen was cleared of all charges.\n\n* Ronan should stop referring to Allen as his father, since (by Farrow's own admission in an interview) it's highly probable that Ronan is Frank Sinatra's son. You need only look at him to see whose genes he's got.\n\n* In any case, we'll never know the truth. I'm simply stating an alternative scenario."
