        "text": "Steve Carell is gearing up to reunite with his Melinda and Melinda director Woody Allen in the filmmaker's new movie.\n\nThe Foxcatcher actor will replace Bruce Willis in the film after Willis \"was forced to leave\" production, reports Variety.\n\nThe untitled project, which is written and directed by Allen, already features an all-star cast, including Kristen Stewart, Blake Lively, Jesse Eisenberg, Parker Posey, Anna Camp and Paul Schneider among many others.\n\nWillis exited the project earlier this month due to his Broadway commitment to Misery but not before he had been spotted filming on set.\n\nAllen's last movie Irrational Man was released in July and starred Joaquin Phoenix, Parker Posey and Emma Stone.\n\nMeanwhile, Carell's latest project saw him revisit his evil villain character Gru from the animated franchise Despicable Me in the wildly successful spin-off film Minions.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated actor's next films will see him reunite with two of his Crazy, Stupid Love co-stars, starring alongside Julianne Moore in Freeheld and Ryan Gosling in The Big Short."
