        "text": "Hollywood filmmaker Woody Allen's latest film A Rainy Day in New York appears to have been shelved indefinitely by Amazon Studios.\n\nThe film, which features the likes of Selena Gomez, Elle Fanning, Jude Law and Call Me By Your Name star Timothée Chalamet, finished filming last year, but has yet to receive a release date.\n\nOn Thursday (August 30), the distributor confirmed that \"no release date has ever been set\", according to The Guardian.\n\nIt first emerged earlier this year that Woody Allen's latest film may not be getting a release at all, and this latest report doesn't do much to dissuade that notion.\n\nIn the wake of the #MeToo movement, there was a renewed focus on allegations made by Allen's adopted daughter Dylan Farrow that Allen sexually abused her when she was just seven years old, back in the early 1990s.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning filmmaker has long denied claims from Dylan and her mother Mia Farrow and recently reiterated that he has never been criminally charged by Connecticut authorities in a statement after Dylan gave an interview on the topic in January.\n\n\"When this claim was first made more than 25 years ago, it was thoroughly investigated by both the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital and New York State child welfare,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"They both did so for many months and independently concluded that no molestation had ever taken place. Instead, they found it likely a vulnerable child had been coached to tell the story by her angry mother during a contentious breakup.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"I never molested my daughter – as all investigations concluded a quarter of a century ago.\"\n\nA Rainy Day in New York had already caused controversy even before the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements because of its plot depicting a romance between a married 44-year-old man (Jude Law) and a 15-year-old girl (Elle Fanning).\n\nThe film's stars Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Hall both announced they were donating the salaries from their film to #MeToo-related charities, and To Rome With Love's Greta Gerwig has apologised for working with Woody Allen in the past too.\n\nRape Crisis England and Wales works towards the elimination of sexual violence. If you've been affected by the issues raised in this story, you can access more information on their website or by calling the National Rape Crisis Helpline on 0808 802 9999. Rape Crisis Scotland's helpline number is 08088 01 03 02.\n\nReaders in the US are encouraged to contact RAINN, or the National Sexual Assault Hotline on 800-656-4673."
