        "text": "Karl Lagerfeld is giving Woody Allen’s newest film a distinct French fashion flair.\n\nThe house of Chanel has confirmed that Lagerfeld provided an iconic tweed suit and silk blouse for Cate Blanchett, who plays the lead role in the untitled movie, which has been shooting in New York and San Francisco.\n\nThe film also stars a wide range of actors from Peter Sarsgaard, Sally Hawkins, Michael Emerson and Alec Baldwin to comedians Louis C.K. and Andrew Dice Clay.\n\nThe actress was spotted filming scenes in New York earlier this year wearing chic beige trousers and a mint green bowed blouse, hinting at her character, that of a wealthy woman who falls into financial trouble and has to leave New York for San Francisco.\n\nSome high-fashion mags such as Harper’s Bazaar have compared Blanchett’s wardrobe to Diane Keaton’s Annie Hall look. But Keaton’s costumes were by Ralph Lauren, not a French designer. Big difference.\n\nAllen has been shooting in San Francisco too, in various locations including outside Shreve & Co. jewelers on Post Street, where Blanchett wore a beige dress buttoned to the neck, and Sarsgaard wore a blue shirt with a khaki suit.\n\nThe film crew previously shot scenes in Belvedere, Tiburon and a winery in Larkspur. Other locations have included Ocean Beach, Pacific Heights, and the Marina and St. Francis Wood neighborhoods.\n\nSounds like Woody is doing a loving pictorial to the city, much like he has done with Paris and Rome in his previous films. The last time Allen shot in in San Francisco was for 1972’s Play It Again, Sam."
