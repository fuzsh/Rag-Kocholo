        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Parker Posey, who was part of Woody Allen‘s last film Irrational Man, is in final negotiations to reteam with the filmmaker on his untitled next movie. She will join an ensemble that so far includes Blake Lively, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg and Bruce Willis.\n\nAs is with any Allen movie, there are no plot details, but the picture is being produced by Letty Aronson, Stephen Tenenbaum and Edward Walson, his usual collaborators. Allen has been casting the film for the past few months.\n\nIrrational Man stars Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix and will be released July 17 by Sony Pictures Classics.\n\nPosey, who is an indie favorite having been a part of such films as Christopher Guest’s A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration, just produced through her company the indie The Architect, in which she also stars. She also has starred and appeared in several TV shows including Granite Flats, Louie and The Big C. She is repped by Gersh."
