        "text": "Last week saw Bruce Willis suddenly drop out of Woody Allen’s upcoming project, but the director hasn’t wasted time in finding a replacement, with Steve Carell signing on to step into the breach. Not exactly like-for-like casting, we think you’ll agree…\n\nNo explanation has officially been given for Willis’ departure, but while it would have been intriguing to see how the former action star would link up with Allen, Carell seems a natural fit for the director’s oeuvre. The as-yet-untitled film is currently shooting in New York and LA, with plot details non-existent at this stage.\n\nWhat we do know is that Carell will be joining a typically starry cast featuring Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll, Anna Camp and Paul Schneider. The film is expected to open at some point in 2016 with a specific release date to be confirmed.\n\nFor more great film and TV news, head to our movie channel or subscribe to Total Film."
