        "text": "Woody Allen‘s untitled film has added yet another Sopranos alum to its cast. Max Casella, who played Benny Fazio for five seasons on the HBO series, has been cast in the upcoming feature from Amazon Studios. He joins former Sopranos Steven Schirripa and Tony Sirico as well as Kate Winslet, Justin Timberlake, Juno Temple, and James Belushi. The film, a period drama set in the late ’50s, is written and helmed by Allen. He is producing along with Letty Aronson and Edward Walson. Casella is also apart of Allen’s Amazon series Crises In Six Scenes, which debuts September 30. His upcoming films include Jackie with Natalie Portman and the Ben Affleck-directed crime drama Live By Night. He is repped by Innovative Artists and Ellipsis Entertainment Group.\n\nGilbert Owuor has joined the cast of Duncan Jones’ indie film Mute, starring Alexander Skarsgard, Paul Rudd, and Justin Theroux. Shooting is set to being next month in Berlin. Owuor will play Maksim in the film, which is set 40 years from today, about a mute bartender who goes up against his city’s gangsters in an effort to find out what happened to his missing partner. The project is based on a script by Jones and Mike Johnson with Stuart Fenegan attached to produced and Bill Johnson, Jim Seibel and Ara Keshishian executive producing. Up next, Owuor can be seen in David E. Kelley’s Amazon series Goliath, premiering in October. He is repped by Innovative Artists and D2 Management."
