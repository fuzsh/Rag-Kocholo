        "text": "Steve Carell has replaced Bruce Willis in Woody Allen’s upcoming untitled film, which is currently shooting in Los Angeles, following the Die Hard star’s unexplained departure, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWillis left the production in mysterious circumstances last week. Some reports have indicated there was a conflict with the actor’s forthcoming run in the Broadway version of the Oscar-winning psychological thriller Misery, while the Wrap’s reporter Jeff Sneider has suggested he was dropped from the cast.\n\nPlot details, and the title for the movie, Allen’s follow-up to the Cannes debutant Irrational Man, remain under wraps – as is typically the case for the film-maker’s movies. The new film will also star Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Blake Lively, Parker Posey and Corey Stoll. Carell last worked with the director on his 2004 Manhattan-set tragicomedy Melinda and Melinda.\n\nCarell will next be seen in gay rights drama Freeheld, alongside Julianne Moore and Ellen Page. He has also just wrapped The Big Short, which stars Brad Pitt, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling. The film tells the story of the investors who managed to profit from the financial collapse of 2008."
