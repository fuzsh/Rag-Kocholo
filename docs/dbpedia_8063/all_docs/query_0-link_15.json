        "text": "Amazon loves Woody Allen. Not only did they sign Allen to create his first serialized television show, they’ve also now grabbed up his latest romcom– as yet untitled– which will star Steve Carell, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively, Parker Posey and Jeannie Berlin.\n\nAmazon plans to release the film this summer using the traditional route–in theaters. Shortly after the film’s theatrical run, it will become available digitally exclusively to Amazon Prime subscribers. “Like all beginning relationships, there is much hope, mutual affection, and genuine goodwill — the lawsuits come later,” said Allen. “Woody Allen is a brilliant filmmaker,” said Roy Price, Head of Amazon Studios. “We’re so proud to be in business with him for both his next film and his first ever TV series.”\n\nAllen is writing and directing the untitled six-episode television series he agreed to, and then later regretted. The series stars himself, Elaine May, and Miley Cyrus and begins shooting next month."
