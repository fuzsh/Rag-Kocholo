        "text": "EXCLUSIVE Remember how Woody Allen said he regretted making a deal with Amazon and didn’t know how he’d write a TV series? Well, he’s done it.\n\nWoody’s untitled six episode series, presumably a comedy, will shoot beginning in March in New York. It looks like it will take six weeks, or one episode a week.\n\nA casting call has gone out for supporting players including a young Jack Lemmon type and a group of “Miss Marple” types. No word yet on the plot, the main cast or characters, or anything else. But all should be revealed shortly. For the Lemmon character, Woody do well to check out new pop singer Charlie Puth. Juliet Taylor, FYI.\n\nWoody’s next feature film — set for release later this year– has all star cast featuring Steve Carell, Parker Posey, Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Blake Lively, and the amazing Judy Davis.\n\nRoger Friedmanhttps://www.showbiz411.com\n\nRoger Friedman began his Showbiz411 column in April 2009 after 10 years with Fox News, where he created the Fox411 column.
