        "text": "As a correspondent on the popular news show parody, \"The Daily Show\" (Comedy Central, 1999- ), comedic actor Steve Carell used his strange deadpan humor to build a career that eventually spanned into high-profile movies and television shows. After memorable supporting roles in \"Bruce Almighty\" (2004) and \"Anchorman\" (2004), Carell announced his arrival with a star-making turn in the sleeper hit comedy, \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" (2005). He made the jump back to television with his uncomfortably funny portrayal of the pushy, clueless boss Michael Scott on the American adaptation of the British hit comedy series, \"The Office\" (NBC, 2005-13) - a role he refused to abandon in light of his tandem movie star status. During his award-winning run on \"The Office,\" Carell continued to star in big studio movies, including replacing Jim Carrey as the lead for the sequel, \"Evan Almighty\" (2007), which saw his supporting character turned into a leading role. Meanwhile, he made the Don Adams character of Maxwell Smart his own in the big budget feature treatment of \"Get Smart\" (2008). Though he eventually left \"The Office\" in 2011, Carell continued to make both blockbuster hits like the animated \"Despicable Me\" (2010) series and smaller, more reality-grounded films like the wrestling drama \"Foxcatcher\" (2014) and the indie coming of age story \"The Way Way Back\" (2013), as well as character roles in films like \"Woody Allen's \"Caf√© Society\" (2016) and Adam McKay's financial drama \"The Big Short\" (2015), confirming that he was one of the most versatile actors working on either the big or small screen."
