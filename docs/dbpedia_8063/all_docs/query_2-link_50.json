        "text": "Emma Stone and Colin Firth are headed to France to star in Woody Allen's next comedy, the film's producers announced Tuesday.\n\nThe director will continue his film tour of Europe, shooting the still-untitled comedy in the South of France this summer.\n\nThere was no release date given for the film and no further details from the highly secretive Allen.\n\nThis is the second time in his career Allen has chosen France as a location. His 2011 fantasy comedy Midnight in Paris took an Academy Award for screenplay and was nominated for three others (including best picture and best director for Allen).\n\nAllen, best known for his love affair with New York City, marks his eighth film in Europe with this comedy."
