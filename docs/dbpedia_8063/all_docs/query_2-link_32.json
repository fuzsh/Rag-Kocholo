        "text": "Woody Allen has completed casting his latest untitled film, which returns him stateside to New York and San Francisco this summer. It’s Allen’s second time directing in San Francisco, where he shot his directorial debut, 1969’s “Take the Money and Run.”\n\nStarting with 2005 release “Matchpoint,” Allen has been shooting mostly overseas, in London (“Matchpoint,” “Scoop,” “Cassandra’s Dream”), Barcelona (“Vicky Cristina Barcelona”), Paris (Oscar-winning “Midnight in Paris,” 2011’s highest-grossing indie) and Rome (“To Rome with Love,” June 22). UPDATE: He shot 2009’s “Whatever Works” in NY.\n\nAlready cast in the new film are Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Bobby Cannavale, Bradley Cooper and Michael Emerson. The complete cast includes Louis C.K., Andrew Dice Clay, Sally Hawkins, Peter Sarsgaard, Max Casella and Alden Ehrenreich. The film is a Gravier Production produced per usual by Allen’s sister, Letty Aronson, and Stephen Tenenbaum.\n\nAronson and her famous sibling have a cool set-up as independents who remain in complete control of their films. Allen’s films usually perform twice as well overseas as in North America–“Midnight in Paris” earned $56 million domestic and $98 million foreign. Hence they raise foreign coin for each project, with support from the foreign countries where they shoot, and have actors lining up to star in them for basement rates."
