        "text": "After news broke last week about Bruce Willis’ departure from the cast of Woody Allen’s now-shooting new film, the production has moved quickly to secure the services of Steve Carell to replace Willis, Variety reports.\n\nCarell joins a cast that includes American Ultra stars Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, as well as Blake Lively (The Age of Adeline), Parker Posey (Irrational Man), Anna Camp (Pitch Perfect) and Corey Stoll (Ant-Man).\n\nWillis had to depart the project due to scheduling conflicts with his appearance on Broadway in Stephen King’s Misery, although some reports suggest he was dismissed. No official announcement on the reason behind his exit has been made.\n\nAllen’s new film is set to debut in 2016 and is currently untitled.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL18yMRIfoszEaHYNDTy5C-cH9Oa2gN5ng&v=qvTY7eXXIMg"
