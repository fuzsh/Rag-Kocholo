        "text": "In Woody Allen's latest, the story isn't much but the acting and photography are.\n\nCritic's rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars\n\n“Café Society” is probably what you’d call a placeholder Woody Allen movie, a small offering between more cerebral offerings, if he’s still making those.\n\nMaybe that’s why I liked it. The film, about Hollywood in the 1930s, reminded me of “Radio Days,” Allen’s 1987 film about the golden age of radio in the 1940s that came after “Hannah and Her Sisters.” Thus it was considered something of a trifle, something to tide us over before he got back to more-serious pursuits.\n\nI loved it, and it remains one of my favorites of his films.\n\n“Café Society” doesn’t rise to the same heights, but it’s certainly enjoyable, beautiful to look at, funny, with good performances. The story isn’t much to speak of and the characters are underdeveloped, but on balance it falls squarely on the “see it” side of the ledger. (Allen’s personal life will keep some people away, but, as ever, this is a judgment on his movie, nothing more.)\n\nJesse Eisenberg plays Bobby Dorfman, an obvious Allen stand-in. (Allen provides narration in a noticeably shaky voice; then again, he is 80. It’s the first time he’s narrated one of his films and not appeared in it since … yep, “Radio Days.”)\n\nBobby lives in cramped quarters with his family in the Bronx, but soon sets out for Hollywood unburdened by prospects or ambition, you might say. He figures things will take care of themselves, especially since his uncle, Phil Stern (Steve Carrell), a powerful Hollywood talent agent, lives there.\n\nNot so fast, at least at first. Phil blows Bobby off for a couple of weeks; when he finally deigns to meet with him, Phil doesn’t even remember his name. But he gives Bobby a job running errands and introduces him to Vonnie (Kristen Stewart, outstanding), his English-major secretary. She’s smart and grounded and has little use for the name-dropping culture she inhabits by virtue of her job.\n\nBobby falls for her immediately.\n\nShe seems to like him, too, but says she’s seeing someone else. A pretty obvious love triangle develops, with Bobby wanting to marry Vonnie and take her back to New York to live in the East Village. He doesn’t have a job, but his gangster brother Ben (Corey Stoll) has moved into the nightclub business, and Bobby can run the place, maybe.\n\nBobby winds up back in New York, indeed running his brother’s nightclub, which becomes a beacon of New York society. (The film is, as much as anything else, a romantic fantasy.) Bobby meets and marries another Veronica (this one played by Blake Lively, terrific in a small role). They’re happy, and then one night in walks. …\n\nGuess. The movie isn’t particularly hard to figure out and doesn’t try to be. Its charms lie more in what the actors make of characters that could have been cliches (or, if you’re in a kinder mood, archetypes) and its gorgeous look.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine an actor better as Allen’s alter-ego than Eisenberg, with his stammering delivery, as if the words are tripping over themselves. Stewart nails the role of a sweet Midwestern girl who has moved to the big city and realizes it’s not going to swallow her whole. Carell patiently proves there is more to Phil than we first would guess.\n\nJeannie Berlin and Ken Stott are terrific as Bobby and Ben’s bickering parents (bringing to mind, yes, Julie Kavner and Michael Tucker in “Radio Days”).\n\nBoth Hollywood and New York look like vintage postcard versions of how we imagine them. Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, an Oscar winner for “Apocalypse Now,” “Reds” and “The Last Emperor,” makes Hollywood in particular glow.\n\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\n“Café Society” is, simply, enjoyable, and at this point that’s enough. It’ll probably never make it into anyone’s list of the 10 most-important Allen films. But I’d watch it again over a few movies that would.\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com. Facebook: facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.
