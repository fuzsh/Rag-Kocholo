        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Aug 30 ― Well it looks like we won’t be seeing Bruce Willis star in a Woody Allen movie anytime soon.\n\nApparently, Steve Carell has replaced Willis in the new movie known solely as “The Untitled Woody Allen Project”.\n\nThe reasons behind Willis’ exit are ambiguous. There was a rumour that Willis was fired by Allen, but many also said the movie had a conflicting schedule with Willis’ upcoming commitment on Broadway adaptation of “Misery”.\n\nIt would have been Willis’ first film with Allen. Carell has joined the star-studded cast including Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg and Corey Stoll."
