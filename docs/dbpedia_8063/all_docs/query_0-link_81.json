        "text": "Woody Allen is one of those names in the film industry that forces you to pause. Whether you have strong opinions on his complicated personal relationships or don’t care, there’s no question that the man has greatly influenced the realm of American film and comedy during his 61 years in the industry. Today, The Hollywood Reporter published an interview with the Academy Award winning director, and the resulting piece was as frank as you would expect. During the course of the interview, Allen and reporter Stephen Galloway discussed Allen’s decision to recast Bruce Willis’ part in Cafe Society, how his controversial marriage with Soon-Yi has affected his life, and what it was like making the shift from film to television for his new, untitled Amazon series. Here’s what we’ve learned.\n\nWhy was Bruce Willis replaced by Steve Carrell in Cafe Society?\n\nBefore we get into the why, let’s cover the what. Cafe Society is an upcoming Woody Allen film that stars Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, and now Steve Carell. This coming-of-age rom-com takes place in the 1930s and follows a young man (Eisenberg) who moves from New York to Hollywood. Once in the land of stars, he lands a job with a big agent (Carell) and falls in love with his agent’s gorgeous secretary (Stewart). So far, it sounds like a typical, period piece Woody Allen rom-com with some newer names attached. Cafe Society will premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 11 and will be released digitally through Amazon Studios July 15.\n\nSo what’s with the casting change? It’s less dramatic and more inconvenient. According to Allen, Willis’ involvement with the Broadway musical Misery made it too difficult for him to commit to Allen’s project:\n\nI shot a few scenes in California with Bruce Willis, and Bruce was going to do something on Broadway [Misery] and it was just too much for him. So we replaced him with Steve Carell.\n\nBut now you may have another question: If Cafe Society is being released by Amazon Studios, then why do audiences have to wait so long for its digital release? This is all part of the deal Allen has with Amazon, which requires the film to have a typical theater run before it’s released to mainstream audiences. By the way, Amazon paid $15 million for this one.\n\nAllen wasn’t traumatized by the Soon-Yi scandal, and he hasn’t kept in touch with Mia Farrow.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter interview spent a good amount of time discussing the scandal you think of when you hear Woody Allen’s name — Allen’s relationship with Soon-Yi. If you need a refresher, Allen was dating actress Mia Farrow for 12 years before Farrow discovered Allen had been having an affair with her 21-year-old adopted daughter, Soon-Yi. Allen was never technically Soon-Yi’s stepfather, but the whole relationship is a little too close for comfort for most. According to Allen, he was not traumatized by the scandal:\n\nI was immune, yes I was. You can see I worked right through that, undiminished. Made films all through those years and at the same rate I was making them. I’m good that way. I am very disciplined and very monomaniacal and compartmentalized.\n\nThis is probably connected to one of Allen’s other big reveals — he doesn’t read anything about himself. Allen went on to say that he understandably hasn’t seen Farrow in years and that one of the greatest experiences of his life has been helping his wife, Soon-Yi. When asked how Soon-Yi has changed him, Allen’s responses were a bit lackluster, highlighting how great of a wife and companion Soon-Yi is, but not much else. Slight burn. Here’s hoping Soon-Yi doesn’t read anything about Allen either.\n\nWhat’s going on with Woody Allen’s Amazon show?\n\nThis may be the most exciting part of the interview for those of us who are streaming obsessed. Prime Video’s currently untitled Allen project will be a limited run comedy starring Elaine May (The Heartbreak Kid, The Birdcage) and Miley Cyrus. All six half-hour episodes have now been edited and finished, and, according to Allen, the domestic comedy set in the 1960s has a definite beginning and a definite ending. There won’t be a second season for this one.\n\nWait, Miley Cyrus? The Disney star turned pop singer who always has her tongue out?\n\nIs there another? Allen first paid attention to Cyrus when his kids were watching Hannah Montana, and he was impressed by her line delivery. Here’s Allen’s review of Cyrus:\n\n“The show is a silly little show, but she’s very good at what she does. And then she emerged as a singer, and someone showed me a little clip of hers from Saturday Night Live, and I said, ‘It confirms what I always thought about her: She is very good, she is really a talented girl.'”\n\n(Note: It’s unknown whether the above clip is the SNL clip Allen referenced in the interview. It’s just a good Miley Cyrus performance.)\n\nWill Allen be doing another Amazon show?\n\nThat’s highly unlikely, though Allen never gave a reason why. He just said he didn’t think he’d do another. However, creating a TV show was much more difficult than Allen originally anticipated — a challenge he accredits to the high level of today’s television:\n\nAnd I found as soon as I started to get into the project, I couldn’t bring myself to slough it off because this is not television of 50 years ago, where every silly thing was acceptable. You’re working in a medium that has grown up and has got wonderful things being done in it, and, yes, you may prove to be an embarrassment, but you don’t want to be a total embarrassment."
