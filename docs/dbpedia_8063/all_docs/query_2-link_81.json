        "text": "Woody Allen has famously dissed Los Angeles his whole career, but the 79-year old director has been spotted working on his latest movie around town, including a shoot at Los Feliz's Vista Theatre.\n\nAllen, who cranks out movies at a clip of about one per year, has already begun shooting the latest in an ongoing series of Untitled Woody Allen Projectsâ€”just barely a month since Irrational Man hit theaters. In fact, one of his actors, Bruce Willis, stopped working on Allen's movie earlier this week, with rumors circulating that Allen may have fired him.\n\nPhotos from the shoot in Beverly Hills show Willis, Jesse Eisenberg, and Kristen Stewart in vintage costume and in an appropriately vintage Ford.\n\nOn Tuesday, shooting moved to Los Feliz and Allen used the classic Vista Theatre as a setting. The marquee was changed to advertise the 1935 Barbara Stanwyck film The Woman In Red.\n\nOn Wednesday, the production was spotted filming at a beach somewhere in Los Angeles.\n\nThere are few details on the film, but the cast reportedly also includes Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll, Anna Camp, Paul Schneider, and whoever will replace Willis."
