        "text": "Woody Allen is looking to cast Emma Stone in the lead role in his next untitled film. There's not a lot of information for the film on what it's about, but Deadline says Allen will shoot in the South of France where he made the Owen Wilson movie Midnight In Paris.\n\nStone is a fantastic actress, and she'll be great in a Woody Allen movie. I've actually been on a Woody Allen kick recently and have been watching all of his movies. A lot of them I'm seeing for the first time, and they've been fun to watch!"
