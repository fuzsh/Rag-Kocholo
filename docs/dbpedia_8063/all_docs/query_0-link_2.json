        "text": "Following the report Bruce Willis was forced to leave the production of Woody Allen‘s next pic, Allen has moved quickly to find his replacement as sources tell Variety that Steve Carell will replace Willis in the pic.\n\nCarell joins Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll, Ken Stott, Anna Camp, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick and Paul Schneider in the cast, with Allen writing and directing.\n\nThe film is currently untitled and without distribution. As has been the case with several of Allen’s past films, Sony Classics is the front-runner to land the pic.\n\nAs always, plot details are under wraps, and the shoot is currently under way. Though an early report said Willis was forced to leave because of his commitment to “Misery” on Broadway, there remains some confusion surrounding his exit since the actor did appear on set before leaving the production.\n\nNo release date has been set for the pic. The film is being produced by Letty Aronson, Steve Tenenbaum and Edward Walson. Executive producers are Ronald L. Chez, Adam B. Stern and Allan Teh.\n\nAllen and Carell previously worked together on “Melinda and Melinda” in 2004. Carell can be seen next in the drama “Freeheld” alongside Julianne Moore, Michael Shannon and Ellen Page, followed by the financial drama “The Big Short,” which also stars Brad Pitt, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling.\n\nHe is repped by WME and Media Four. The news was first reported by Deadline Hollywood."
