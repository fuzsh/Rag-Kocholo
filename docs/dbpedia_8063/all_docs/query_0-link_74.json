        "text": "Amazon has acquired Woody Allen’s latest film, adding one of film’s biggest names to its growing slate of original movies.\n\nAmazon said on Thursday that it will distribute Allen’s currently untitled film in a traditional theatrical release this summer, followed by a streaming release through its subscription service, Amazon Prime.\n\nThe romantic comedy, shot last summer in New York and Los Angeles, stars Kristen Stewart, Steve Carell and Parker Posey.\n\nThe deal also extends Amazon’s relationship with Allen, who is prepping a six-episode TV series for the online retailer. In a statement, Allen said: “Like all beginning relationships, there is much hope, mutual affection and genuine goodwill — the lawsuits will come later.”\n\nAmazon released its first original film last year by another quintessentially New York filmmaker: Spike Lee’s Chi-Raq."
