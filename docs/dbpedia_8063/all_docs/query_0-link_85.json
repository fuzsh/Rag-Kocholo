        "text": "Woody Allen remains one of the most industrious filmmakers in the business.\n\nWith his latest, Café Society, yet to open in cinemas after its debut at the Cannes Film Festival; the director appears to have already started prepping his 47th cinematic project, with Variety reporting its very first casting announcement.\n\nLooks like Oscar winner Kate Winslet will be collaborating with Allen for the very first time, though she had previously turned down Match Point; with final negotiations taking place before the film's shoot in the fall. Allen, as usual, will write, direct, and produce the untitled film; with plot details being heavily guarded at this time.\n\nThough already nominated at this year's Academy Awards for Steve Jobs, Winslet could very well once more be looking at Oscar glory with the project; Allen has directed more actresses in Oscar-winning performances than any other living director, with a total of six, only elsewhere beaten by William Wyler. Starting with Diane Keaton's win for 1977's Annie Hall, Cate Blanchett most recently picked up the gong in 2013 for Blue Jasmine.\n\nHis line of films, however, has been rather shaky of late; though Café Society picked up largely favourable reviews at Cannes, the general consensus seemed to brand the film as largely forgettable amongst the director's oeuvre.\n\nJesse Eisenberg plays a young man arriving in Hollywood in the 1930s with dreams of a career in its film industry; though instead finds himself in love, and entranced by the café society which marked such a spirited age. He stars alongside Kristen Stewart, Blake Lively, Parker Posey, and Steve Carell."
