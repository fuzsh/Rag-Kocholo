        "text": "Bruce Willis, whose favorite thing used to be shattering plate-glass windows with his body, is doing a new thing lately: Signing on for a movie, then not actually making said movie. He kick-started this fun, late-in-life trend with The Expendables 3, which, as we reported in 2013, saw Willis replaced unceremoniously by Harrison Ford, much to Sylvester Stallone’s evident glee. Next up was Wake, a thriller in which he was set to star as a “sociopath with no fear.” But this April, after the film had issues with financing because “a certain producer would not stand down from the picture,” Willis dropped out, citing another commitment.\n\nLast week, Willis exited Woody Allen’s latest movie, again blaming scheduling conflicts, this time with his forthcoming stint on Broadway in an adaptation of Stephen King’s Misery. (Maybe someone on Willis’s team should start using GCal?) Strangely, Willis was photographed on set just a day prior to his abrupt departure—meaning he either totally forgot about Misery and then was all, “Crap, I gotta go do this play, dude,” or there’s truth to some Twitter rumors about Allen’s role in his departure.\n\nThough we may never know the truth about What Happened With Willis, Allen has already replaced him with Steve Carell. Carell, who is surely regularly mistaken for Bruce Willis at parties, is familiar with Allen’s rapid, one-film-a-year production style, having played a small part in Allen’s 2004 flick Melinda And Melinda.\n\nAllen’s been characteristically tight-lipped about both the plot and the title of his latest. But we do know that it’s shooting this month in both New York and LA and stars Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll, Anna Camp, and Paul Schneider . . . for now.\n\nNews\n\nSteve Ballmer Chases NBA Glory at Intuit Dome, the LA Clippers’ Gleaming New Home\n\nThe team owner and former Microsoft chief dreams of taking home “the Larry” and escaping the Lakers’ shadow. “We want to win every year,” Ballmer tells Vanity Fair. “It is a philosophy.”\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nHow Trumpworld Is Coping With the Kamala Harris Boom\n\nIn just days, the vice president has raked in more than $100 million, scored countless endorsements, started a social media phenomenon, and secured enough delegates for the nomination. “She has been totally dominating,” marveled one GOP strategist.\n\nTelevision\n\nJ.D. Vance’s Mythical Couch Tryst Is a Fact-Checker’s Nightmare. Stephen Colbert Explains Why.\n\nDuring his Late Show monologue, Colbert roasted Donald Trump’s running mate for the untrue (?) sofa-billy elegy currently delighting the internet.\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump’s GOP Swings and Misses With Desperate Attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nRepublicans built a campaign around assailing Joe Biden. But now he’s out and Trumpworld can’t seem to figure out how to hit Harris besides warmed-over racist and sexist insults.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nNews\n\nWhat Kamala Harris Means for Democrats’ Chances in Battleground States\n\n“She’s been like a defibrillator to the Democratic Party in this race.”\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince Harry’s Calls to King Charles “Go Unanswered”\n\nThe monarch is reportedly no longer speaking to his younger son over Harry’s ongoing battle to secure enhanced security when he visits the UK.\n\nHollywood\n\nHarvey Weinstein to Face New Sexual Assault Trial in November\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan might bring new accusations against the previously convicted former movie mogul."
