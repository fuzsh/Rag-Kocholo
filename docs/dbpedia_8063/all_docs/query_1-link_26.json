        "text": "Steve Carell has stepped into replace Bruce Willis in the new Woody Allen movie, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.\n\nThe new movie is shooting in Los Angeles with a cast that includes Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Blake Lively, Parker Posey and Corey Stoll among many others.\n\nThe reasons for Willis' departure remain murky. The actor was spotted on set and in costume with Eisenberg, but abruptly left the production this week. Some reports have cited a conflict with the actor and his upcoming Broadway work in the stage adaptation of Misery. Other reports have said the actor was let go.\n\nCarell appeared in Allen's 2004 movie Melinda and Melinda. He next appears in the gay civil rights drama Freeheld, which will screen at the Toronto Film Festival."
