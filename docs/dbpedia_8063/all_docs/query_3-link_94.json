        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Woody Allen is getting the gang back together. Steven Schirripa, who famously played Bobby “Bacala” Baccalieri on The Sopranos, has joined the cast of Allen’s untitled next movie. The role sets up a reunion with Tony Sirico, who played Paulie “Walnuts” Gualtieri on the HBO mob drama and joined the cast of Allen’s film last month. The cast also includes Juno Temple, Kate Winslet, James Belushi and Justin Timberlake.\n\nNo character description was provided for Schirripa’s role and plot details are under wraps, but the film written and to be directed by Allen is a period drama set in the late 1950s. Allen is producing alongside his frequent collaborators Letty Aronson and Edward Walson.\n\nSchirripa plays DA investigator Detective Anthony Abetemarco on CBS’ Blue Bloods, which returns October 23 with Season 7. He recently appeared on IFC’s hockey comedy Benders and was a regular on The Secret Life Of The American Teenage. His film credits include Jersey Boys, Hereafter, Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas and Casino. Schirripa is repped by Innovative, Steve Lovett management and lawyer Roger Haber."
