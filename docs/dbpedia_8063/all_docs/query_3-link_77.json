        "text": "Due to the amount of films consistently being churned out by the prolific writer / director Woody Allen, his upcoming projects are often coined Woody Allen’s untitled project. For some of the more hardcore Allen fans, the announcement of the title is an event in itself. As thus, we give to you the upcoming title of Mr. Allen’s next film, which will star Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Parker Posey, and relative newcomer Jamie Blackley — Irrational Man. The plot supposedly centers on a small town college campus, in which a philosophy professor with an existential crisis gives his life new purpose when he enters into a relationship with his student. Allen will remain behind the camera in this one, so it seems he won’t be the older professor paired off with the young Emma Stone.\n\nWhile the title is a bit more vague than some of his previous titles — in which one could perhaps ascertain more of the plot — like Manhattan Murder Mystery or Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Too Afraid to Ask, we are aware of a production location in Rhode Island. No more Europe?\n\nSony Pictures Classics has once again acquired all North American rights to the film, which isn’t too surprising."
