        "text": "Public Morals alum Michael Rapaport, Girls‘ Becky Ann Baker and The Daily Show‘s Lewis Black are among the new cast members announced today by Woody Allen for his untitled TV series to premiere on Amazon later this year. Also set are Margaret Ladd (Falcon Crest), Joy Behar (The View), Rebecca Schull (Wings), David Harbour (Black Mass), and Christine Ebersole (Amadeus).\n\nThey join previously announced Allen, Elaine May, Miley Cyrus, John Magaro, and Rachel Brosnahan. As per usual with Allen’s fare, little is known about the project other than that it takes place in the 1960s, Production began in New York this month.\n\nThe show is executive produced by Erika Aronson and produced by Helen Robin.\n\nThe project is the latest move in Allen’s growing relationship with Amazon. On the film side, Amazon Studios recently announced its acquisition of the writer-director’s latest untitled feature for all North American rights, including theatrical and streaming. The 1930s romantic comedy stars Jeannie Berlin, Steve Carell, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Corey Stoll, and Ken Stott. Amazon will open the film this summer with a traditional, nationwide theatrical release for three months before making it exclusively available on Amazon Prime.\n\nRapaport is repped by Innovative Artists and Brillstein Entertainment Partners. Ebersole, Black and Behar are repped by APA."
