The film, untitled for the moment, pairs Eisenberg with a cast that includes Penelope Cruz, Alec Baldwin and Ellen Page. The film will shoot in Rome this summer. For Allen, the quintessential New York filmmaker, this marks his fifth film to be shot in Europe and to be co-produced with his own production company and eager European partners."
