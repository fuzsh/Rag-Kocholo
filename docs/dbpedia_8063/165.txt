Bruce Willis shot for a day on Woody Allen’s latest, as yet untitled film (see above). Willis then dropped out due to ‘scheduling conflicts’ with his Broadway turn in the stage adaptation of Stephen King’s Misery. Read into that what you will.

Steve Carell will now replace Willis in the film which also stars Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll, Ken Stott, Anna Camp, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick and Paul Schneider.

It’s sad that Willis couldn’t stay the course on this one. It would have been great to see him fire-out some of Woody’s rat-tat-tat dialogue. He’d better deliver a great performance in Misery.
