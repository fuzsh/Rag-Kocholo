LOS ANGELES, Aug 30 ― Well it looks like we won’t be seeing Bruce Willis star in a Woody Allen movie anytime soon.

Apparently, Steve Carell has replaced Willis in the new movie known solely as “The Untitled Woody Allen Project”.

The reasons behind Willis’ exit are ambiguous. There was a rumour that Willis was fired by Allen, but many also said the movie had a conflicting schedule with Willis’ upcoming commitment on Broadway adaptation of “Misery”.

It would have been Willis’ first film with Allen. Carell has joined the star-studded cast including Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg and Corey Stoll.
