Rom-com starring Kristen Stewart, Steve Carell and Parker Posey shot in New York and L.A.

Amazon has acquired Woody Allen's latest movie, adding one of film's biggest names to its growing slate of original titles.

Amazon said Thursday that it will distribute Allen's currently untitled film in a traditional theatrical release in North America this summer, followed by a streaming release through its subscription service, Amazon Prime.

The film is a romantic comedy set in the 1930s that was shot last summer in New York and Los Angeles. It stars Kristen Stewart, Steve Carell and Parker Posey.

The deal also extends Amazon's relationship with Allen, who is prepping a six-episode TV series for the online retailer. That series, to star Elaine May and Miley Cyrus, is to start shooting in March.

"Like all beginning relationships, there is much hope, mutual affection and genuine goodwill â€” the lawsuits will come later," said Allen in a statement.

"Woody Allen is a brilliant filmmaker," said Roy Price, head of Amazon Studios.

"We're so proud to be in business with him for both his next film and his first ever TV series."

Amazon released its first original film last year by another quintessentially New York filmmaker: Spike Lee's Chi-Raq.
