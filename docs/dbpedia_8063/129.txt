Allen’s latest feature, “Café Society,” opened the Cannes Film Festival back in May and received a slew of positive reviews. Starring Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg and Steve Carell, the dramedy is set in the 1930s and follows a young man who moves to Hollywood in hopes of working in the film industry.
