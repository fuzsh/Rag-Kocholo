        "text": "During World War II General de Gaulle, who was undersecretary of state for war, resisted surrender to the Germans.\n\nWhen Marshal Petain, who was committed to an armistice with the Germans, became premier of France, de Gaulle fled to London where he led the French Resistance Movement.\n\nIn July 1940 he was sentenced to death for treason by a French court martial, but his Free French movement continued to gather momentum and attracted large-scale support from French colonies in West Africa and the underground movement in France.\n\nAfter the war, de Gaulle was unanimously elected president of the provisional government in October 1945, but resigned in January 1946 after a new constitution for the country could not be agreed upon.\n\nDe Gaulle disapproved of the constitution of the Fourth Republic and withdrew from politics to write his war memoirs.\n\nHe was called upon in 1958 to avert civil war in Algeria and on 1 June of that year was named premier and granted wide emergency powers including the right to prepare a new constitution.\n\nIn December 1958 de Gaulle was elected president by a 78% vote. In 1965 he was elected president for a second seven-year term but resigned in 1969."
