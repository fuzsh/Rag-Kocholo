        "text": "I wrote my Sunday column about a memoir, “My Father Left Me Ireland” by Michael Brendan Dougherty, and what his Irish story might offer to Americans thinking about a reinvention of our traditions, a synthesis beyond our current culture wars. Now, as a kind of sequel, I want to recommend a biography, Julian Jackson’s “De Gaulle,” whose portrayal of modern France’s most famous leader is relevant to the same questions.\n\nUnlike Churchill and Stalin and other World War II-era figures, Charles de Gaulle doesn’t loom particularly large in the American imagination’s filmstrip of the past, appearing briefly as an anti-Nazi hero and then again in cameos as a Cold War-era irritant. And the story that de Gaulle entered and altered, the history of France between the Revolution and the Vichy era, is regarded as too byzantine for most Americans to follow; some of us have seen “Les Misérables,” and that’s complicated enough.\n\nAll of this is unfortunate because France’s more-than-hundred-year war over its own self-understanding, the epic struggles among radical, liberal, conservative and reactionary factions over the French Revolution’s legacy, has an immediate relevance for our own national divisions.\n\nYes, our own ideological extremes are less dramatic, and our culture war has been waged mostly without barricades in the D.C. streets, and without (as yet) a New York Commune under the rule of First Citizen Ocasio-Cortez. But in many ways our politics since the 1960s have been Frenchified in a very 19th-century style."
