        "text": "Jacques Chirac, who molded the legacy of Charles de Gaulle into a personal power base that made him one of the dominant leaders of France across three decades and a vocal advocate of European unity, died on Thursday at his home in Paris. He was 86.\n\nHis death was confirmed by the Fondation Chirac in Paris.\n\nMr. Chirac was elected to two consecutive terms as president, beginning in 1995, having already been prime minister under centrist and Socialist presidents.\n\nAt his death he was most remembered for his defiant stand against the United States-led war in Iraq, his ability to preside over a state in which power was divided between the left and the right — comity that is hardly imaginable today — and his championing the European Union.\n\nMr. Chirac had been a highly visible mayor of Paris for 18 years, using that office as a springboard into national politics. Only years later would his mayoralty emerge as the source of a damaged reputation: In 2011, he was convicted of embezzlement and misusing public funds to finance his political party while running the city.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
