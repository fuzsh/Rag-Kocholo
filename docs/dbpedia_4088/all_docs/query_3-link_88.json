        "text": "The Last Great Frenchman: A Life of General de Gaulle\n\nCharles Williams, Angela Williams. John Wiley & Sons, $45 (544pp) ISBN 978-0-471-11711-7\n\nThis is a splendid popular biography of French leader Charles de Gaulle (1890-1970), who saved France's honor through his leadership of the Free French during WWII and saved France itself from civil war in 1958. All this is familiar territory but is recounted here with verve and anecdotal warmth, along with fresh appraisals of de Gaulle's career as soldier, politician and head of state. Williams contrasts the infuriatingly obstinate public figure with the private man, emotional and affectionate in the bosom of his family. Especially interesting is the account of de Gaulle's tender relationship with his retarded daughter, ``about whom he cared perhaps more than any [other] human being.'' The author also sheds light on de Gaulle's determined anti-Americanism during his final years. This is an admiring examination of a man whose single-minded patriotism made him the living symbol of France for three decades. The author (Lord Williams of Elvel) is deputy leader of the opposition in the British House of Lords. Photos.
