RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 1. INTRODUCTION In the pages to follow I shall attempt to describe some major patterns of parliamentary strategy and tactics which obtained during the second phase of the Fourth Republic, from the general election of June 17, 1951, to the breakdown of constitutional order on May 14, 1958. (The study wiiis completed in February, the introduction written in late May.) _I propose to deal only with those parliamentary groups, cliques, and individuals who essentially accepted the French constitutional status quo. This excludes not only the Communists but also the \"extreme right,\" which was, as it happened, very weak during most of the period. While I did not study these two extremes, I felt almost certain that their styles in politics were significantly different from those of the so- called \"national\" groups. This belief made it reasonable to limit-my field of investigation to the national groups. More- over, during most of the period the extremes entered but little into \"the game,\" so that the \"nationals\" did not find many occasions to apply to them the patterns of calculation and be- havior to be discussed. ' The materials for this study have been derived from a variety of sources: the proceedings of the National Assembly and of the Council of the Republic; news and analyses appearing in the French press; personal observations of meetings of parliament; interviews with. parliamentarians and journalists; memoirs of political and military leaders; and collaboration in-research with colleagues' close to parliament. Occasionally I have drawn .on data from periods preceding June 1951, when they seemed to furnish the best illustrations of persisting practices. While many of the illustrations of \"rules of the game\" given below concern domestic politics, the analysis to be presented is, I believe, relevant to the fuller understanding of French foreign policy. Contemporary France appears to furnish an instance of what probably is a very frequent situation: certain ways of calculating and acting are evolved, tested, and reinforced in domestic politics, but then extended to foreign affairs, often with unexpected consequences. One tendi to assume that reactions abroad are similar to those with ?-? Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/09/13 ?

Accordingly, members of the French political class frequently act in the field of foreign-affairs as if their foreign counterparts were so like themselves that the issue at stake could be treated as a domestic one. In the process of arriving at a national decision on a problem of foreign policy, politicians often apply the procedures customarily used to deal with domestic partners and antagonists, with little perception of the repercussions this may have abroad. A situation in foreign policy must have become very acute indeed for its requirements to modify the rules of the game. In the matterof the rearmament of West Germany, for instance, it would be difficult to understand French behavior between August-1950 and December 1954 without taking into account the customary style of parliamentary politics in Paris. Not only did the French first seem to accept, then reject, EDC, but they rejected the Paris Agreements (December 24), in spite Of their acceptance of a detailed blueprint, the London Agreement, on the preceding October 12. This behavior produced a situation so threatening that external realities finally had to be taken into account: within a week the Assembly reversed itself. Less than two months later the completion of the process of ratifi- cation had come to appear so inevitable that some of the diehards of December 24 becaTs tacit supporters of WEU. It seems charac- teristic of Frenchipof14 that things have to come to such a pass before reality can be accepted. This peculiarity may be partly explained by certain patterns of behavior which are largely evolved in domestic politics. These patterns are dis- cussed below (see Chapter 1). As-long as foreign problems obtrude themselves less sharply than domestic, the ordinary \"rules of the game\" are likely to be quite influential in determining French conduct in inter- national affairs. A well-developed capacity for avoiding their responsibility seems to affect the politicians when they are faced with major national misfortunes (pp. 36-40). The device _of passing the buck is used even in circumstances which might seem unpropitious for this universal technique (pp. 40-41). Such propensities among the politicians are likely to affect the feelings, and hence the conduct, of French policy makers in moments of international crisis. The latter are apt to suspect that their colleagues are out to-unload all responsibility upon them (pp. 48-51), and to make intense efforts to repay them in kind, (pp. 52-53). The practice of agreeing to make certain concessions to a domestic opponent,tdding conditions which ? ? ?

RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 3. one believes to be unacceptable, is applied to foreign affairs , (pp. 61-63). In moments of domestic or foreign crisis, cabinet members are disposed to relinquish their positions, while par- liamentarians are tempted to give up some of their normal functions to the government (pp. 66-75). In both domestic and foreign affairs one often observes a tendency to draw back at the last moment from completing an enterprise (pp. 77-78) and .to scuttle a measure deliberately at a very late stage of its career (pp. 78-80). Related to this behavior is a maneuver called \"the lifting of a mortgage\" (pp. 85-92) whose major consequences may be rather unexpected to those who use the device (pp. 94-97). Decisions in foreign policy are affected by a belief in the expediency of \"waiting\" (pp. 99-110) and in the need to proceed by stages (pp. 110-113), and by an apprehension that the premature announcement of a \"solution\" may be fatal to its chances of adoption (pp. 114-116). The conviction that a \"valid\" solution can be conceived only \"in the heat of the decisive moment\" also extends beyond domestic issues (p. 116). In foreign affairs especially, faith in the effects of passing time may reflect a hope that sooner or later force majeure will provide an automatic solution (pp. 116-118), or, alterna- tively, the confidence that ingenuity will find a solution if enough time is available (p. 118). The practice of equivocation as a means of making possible temporary alliances in parliament is applied to problems of foreign policy (pp. 140-142), and to international dealings (pp. 143-144). There is a tendency to treat foreign policy decisions like parliamentary resolutions, where each component of the majority must be accorded some verbal concession (pp. 146-149). The disposition to take major action in domestic politics only when catastrophe appears the imminent consequence of a continued refusal to act is carried over into the field of foreign affairs (pp. 154-156). Only the immediate future tends to be taken into account (pp. 157-158). Many of the patterns of behavior to be presented below are, no doubt, found outside France. It is the way these patterns combine which is peculiar to France. Even where French practice Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 4. - corresponds to the universal game of politics, certain French peculiarities are observed. The-recourse to imprecise statements (p. 138), for example, is a aommon enough political device, but in contemporary France it is thrown into relief because, for one reason, it conflicts with a rather strong aspiration to \"precision.\" Hence a political device usually accepted in other countries is some- what shocking to Frenchmen. French politicians, like those in other countries, may justify important political failures on the ground that a great deal was learned in the course of them. In the case of France, however, such behavior is intimately related to some of the customary parliamentary maneuvers discussed in Chapter 3. Before entering into an analysis of the patterns of parlia- mentary maneuvering in the period 1951-1958, it may be useful to sketch the framework of \"parliamentary arithmetic\" (the distribution of strength. among the various groups) within which it occurred. The elections of 1951 produced a \"hexagonal\" chamber in In approximate numbers, there were among the 630 deputies: Communists 100 Socialists 105 Radicals and near-by small groups 115 Christian- Democrats 90 Moderates 100 Gaullists 120 Both theCommunists and the Gaullists then refused to enter into alliancesacceptable_to other groups, or were refused entry by them,- so that all the four other groupings had to combine if a majority was to be secured. Any three would have furnished. too narrow a base. Thus the-parliament began with a continuation of the previous formula: a coalition of Socialists, Radicals, Christian- Democrats, and Moderates. The governments so formed were those headed-by Rend Pleven and Edgar Faure, which lasted from the summer of 1951 to the winter of 1952. During this period, however,_a-differently constituted majority began to emerge, ? ? ? Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 5. when a law granting subsidies to Catholic schools was passed by the Gaullists, Moderates, and Christian-Democrats, supple- mented by a fraction of the Radicals. Certain Gaullists and Moderates had designed this measure as a tool to disintegrate the Fourth Force, and it did so. The Socialists withdrew into opposition. Had the Gaullists remained monolithic, the Assembly woad have become ungovern- able, and, as some hoped and predicted, a way to power would have opened for the General. In the spring of 1952, however, the Gaullists began to break up and, before the end of this parliament in the fall of 1955, about half of them had joined other groups, mostly the Moderates. The remainder, deprived of the prospect of power on their own, \"entered the system,\" i.e., supported governments and participated in them, while the General renounced them. By 1955 the picture thus was, approximately: Communists 100 Socialists 105 Radicals, etc. 115 Christian-Democrats 90 Moderates 150 Ex-Gaullists 70 As early as 1952, however, it had become possible to form governments without the support of the Socialists. The first of these, that of Antoine Pinay, was voted in by mistake in the winter of 1952. It had not yet been perceived that a new majority had come into existence (cf. p. 61), The Piney government enjoyed the support of the emerging \"dissident Gaullists\" Ow Moderates) without their furnishing any ministers. In the next government (Rend Mayer, from winter to spring of 1953) the \"dissident Gaullists\" participated, while the nex- Gaullists\" (as the orthodox Gaullists were called after the General had renounced them) gave their support, from which they, _too, advanced to full membership in the subsequent combination (Joseph Laniel, from the early summer of 1953 to the late spring of 1954). This was the \"true\" formula of the legislature, the one which produced the greatest stability. The majority's complement of 425 votes could withstand sub- stantial defections on particular occasions, and also attrition through time, without endangering the government, at least after its first months. This majority was re-established in the list government of the parliament (Edgar Faure, from the winter of 1955 through the rest of the year). But between Laniel and Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/09/13: Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 6. Faure there had been a peculiar interlude, that of Pierre Mendes-France. The fall of Pinay in the winter of 1952 and that of Mayer in the spring of 1953 had not been connected with major issues of policy. But that of Laniel (June 1954) occurred about a month after the fall of Dien-Bien-Phu and about a month before what was in fact the \"abandonment\" of Indochina by France. While it may be argued that Laniel and Bidault, had they re- mained in office, would have followed a policy similar to that of the new Premier, Mendes-France, it remains a fact that the latter pursued his own course with a changed majority. . Taking his stand as a reformer, he could draw on the support of the Socialists. While the Christian-Democrats went into opposition, large fractions of the Radicals and \"ex-Gaullists,\" as well as a smaller fraction of the Moderates, allowed Mendes-France to survive while the abolition of the status quo in Tunisia began and EDC gave way to WEU. By that time the job assigned to Mendes-France as liquidator of over-ripe issues was done, and the majority of Laniel reasserted itself early in 1955, after \"seven months and seventeen days.\" In the spring, with this majority, Edgar Faure managed to accelerate the withdrawal from Tunisia and, in the summer and fall, to initiate and complete the retreat from Morocco by drawing on the temporary support of the Socialists. Faced with the growing strength of the rebellion in Algeria, he attempted a consolidation of his majority through new elections, and failed. The election of January 2, 1956, produced the following approximate party representation: -Communists 150 Socialists 100 -1-4end4sites 15 Radicals of various factions and related groups 90 .Christian-Democrats 75 -Moderates 110 ex-Gaullists 20 -Extreme Right 35 The groups which had formed the majority of Laniel and Faure now controlled but 295 out of 595 votes, and were thus no 19.0itt. effective-as'a coalition. It was not feasible to add the Mendesists or the Extreme Right (mainly Poujadists) to such 'a combination. There was thus only one practicable majority Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 ? ? ? RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 7. in this Third Assembly of the Fourth Republic, the same with which the first one had ended, stretching from the Socialists to the Moderates. In the first two governments formed-under this formula, that of Guy Mollet, from the winter of 1956 to the spring of 1957J and that of Maurice Bourges-Maunoury, from the spring to the fall of that year, the Socialists and Radicals participated in a government which the Christian- Democrats and Moderates merely supported, and which the latter in the end overthrew. In the next government, that of Fdlix Gaillard, from the fall of 1957 to the spring of 1958, the same formula produced the majority, but all its constituent groups participated. When sufficient Moderates deserted the government to overthrow it, the new government of Pierre Pflimlin, beginning May 14, 1958, included representatives of all the supporting parties except the Socialists, who joined a little later. By then, however, the Fourth Republic had in effect broken down. This is the context within which were used the tactics now to he analyzed.

Chapter 1 FACTIONS AND DOCTRINES In contrast to a widely held view, \"doctrines\" do not play a major role in French politics (pp. 9-13). What often gives the impression of \"doctrine\" is a set of more or less emotion- laden phrases peculiar to a given party (pp. 13-14). Conflicts of an \"ideological\" nature are apt to involve simple answers (often irrelevant to action) to simple questions (pp. 14-15) During the period analyzed, interest in constitutional matters was limited (pp. 15-16), while here as elsewhere the attention of politicians was largely absorbed by efforts to defend and improve the position of special economic interests ( p. 16) Historical memories play a minor role in the attitudes toward current problems (pp. 17-20). The conflict between \"Right\" and \"Left\" has declined in intensity (pp. 20-25), this has involved a sharp reduction in the role played by the opposition between \"clericals\" and \"anti-clericals\" (pp. 28-32). In the political class the feeling has gained strength that the policy to be followed in any given situation is commanded by \"facts\" rather than by doctrine (pp. 25-28). During the period analyzed, the most intensely fought issues split both the Right and the Left (pp. 32-33). In France, one often hears, politics is \"intellectual,\" \"theoretical,\" \"abstract,\" \"ideological,\" even \"idealist.\" According, to the most important contemporary commentator on parliamentary activities (Jacques Fauvet), \"ideological quarrels\" occupy \"an eminent place\" in politics. They invade everything: We always start by conferring on our most trite - discussions the dignity of philosophic disputa- tions.1 For, The French people prefer pure .ideas in all circumstances.z In the preface to the book which contains these assertions -- the only recent essay on French politics by an observer close to the political.class--the author announces that he itk\"liberating himself for awhile from the constraints of day-to-day events,\" and proposes to regard the \"landscape\" which-he is usually viewing at Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 20 13/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020007-R Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-658 10.- - short range \"from a greater distance.? In so doing he seems to have turned his eyes toward an imaginary world where \"sordid\" facts have been replaced by \"pure\" ideas which may appear out- dated, but do not lack dignity. A few weeks after the elections of Janutry 2, 1956, the staff of a satirical weekly (Le Canard Enchain) gathered around a recording apparatus in order to discuss, in more or teas serious fashion, the new political star, Pierre Poujade. One of them (Robert Treno) said: What worries me is not Poujade's program but his lack of program. One knows from experience where this leads.... He doesn't have any doctrine, he doesn't have any program, isn't that curious? But this was bound to provoke a reply: You are talking about doctrines and ideology. And M. Pinay, does he have a doctrine? And M. Legendre, does he have a doctrine? And Coste-Floret, does he have a doctrine? Schuman, does he have a doctrine? And Laniel? Please tell me about Laniel's ideology! (Henri Jeanson)4 It_is, in fact, not easy to find doctrines in French politica though politiciansfrequently talk about them; less frequently by the way, than they are often believed to do, and less emphatically than they used to do in the Third Republic. Let usconsider from this point of view the main groupings in French politics (always with the exception of the Communists and of the extreme Right). - Th. initials usually employed to designate the Socialists, \"SFIO,\" stand for \"French Section of the Workers International\"; but one wonders how many among those specialized in politics are in any way aware of the antiquated ideological words behind the familiet abbreviation. Though the Socialists are particularly inclined-to talk about their \"doctrine,\" the commentator cited before, itho stresses the role of \"ideology\" when he makes over- all itailvents, admits that the Socialist Party \"has no doctrine anymore.\" Still, it is \"one of the rare political organisations which still possess.a certain modest number of economic.and social conceptions of _their own.\"6 These \"conceptions\" include a favorable c_- ? ? ? narlaccifiPri in Part - Sanitized CODY Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 ? ?

On the other hand, words such as \"socialism,\" \"nationali- zation,\" or any other terms referring with an air of specificity to a radical transformation of the present order are, on the scale of national politics, not too frequently employed by the Socialists. Demanding that all nuclear fuels be owned by Euratom, a Socialist speaker in the Assembly, a former Premier, added: If we regard this measure as desirable, it is not, ladies and gentlemen, please believe me, because of any sectarian ideology hostile to private property.7 When a Socialist Premier wants to \"fall leftward,\" he may suddenly come out with vague demands for workers' participation in the conduct of business so that the Moderates may cry \"Sovietization\"! Nobody will have known that the Socialists were particularly intent on this reform, and few will wonder about the disappear- ance of the demand once it has served its function. Suppose that Le Monde, the newspaper most widely and thoroughly read by the political class in Paris, wanted to describe in detail the program of the Socialists: many of its readers, though special- ized in politics, would feel that they were being led into rather unknown territory, though they would also be sure that there were no major surprises in store for them. If teachers are part of the \"intelligentsia,\" the Socialists represent that stratum to a higher degree than other parties; but among the intellectuals who are socialist militants, function- aries, parliamentarians, exceedingly few are known on non-political grounds, or as contributors to \"doctrine.\" \"The doctrinal effort which the. appearance of the Communists ought to have imposed on the other parties, and particularly on the Socialists,\" observes Jacques Fauvet, \"was not made until shortly before the war.\"8 I should rather say that it was not made at all, as far as the Socialists are concerned, despite a few essays by Leon Blum and one by Jules Moch. If that book appeared to be followed by some difficulties for Moch in the party, this was not because of any excessive deviations from Marxism which it may have contained, but rather because the author envisaged a raising of retirement ages, a suggestion unwelcome to public employees forming a deci- sivi-part of the Socialist clientele. It would, indeed, be difficult to indicate the.relations between the alleged Socialist Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-AC 6-6-58 12. doctrine and .Marxism, which Socialist leaders have not renounced but which they claim as their own quite rarely and in very brief affirmations. The few persons who are held by party members to be \"theoreticians\" because they write in the party's monthly are quite unknown outside of the limited circles of its readers, and so is the monthly itself. When somebody talks about \"the doctrine of the Radicals,\" others immediately think of the philosopher Alain. On the other hand, one often hears the following anecdote retold: having written a book called Elements of a Radical Doctrine, Alain had it placed before the seat of every Radical minister at the table of the Council of Ministers. One of the recipients, upon looking at the book, remarked: If a Radical doctrine really existed, would we not be the first to know it? \"To my mind,\" declared an important Radical (Edgar Faure), \"Radicalism ill a method- for solving problems rather than a set of solutions.\"' (He went on to suggest that the facts outside of parliament and the distri- bution of party strength within it imposed about the same \"method\" on every reasonable man.) \"The Radicals conceive of themselves as Socialists,\" alleged Jacques Fauvet.10 But if the full name of the party is \"Republican Radical and Radical socialist Party,\" the words \"Socialist\" and \"Socialism\" are almost never applied by Radicals to themselves on the level of national politics; they almost never claim allegiance to any doctrine called \"Socialist.\" ? Lately an effort has been made, in the group around Pierre Mendes-France, to create a new Radical doctrine. But this is indicative of the break-up of the old Radical Party into various fragments, rather than of its continued vigor. Among the eighteen members of the directing commitee of the periodical which attempts this creation of a new doctrine (Cahiers de la R4pub1ique), there are at least two Socialists, two \"Left Catholics\" and one Left The-Christian Democrats, too, used to have a periodical supposedly oriented on doctrine (Terre Humaine), edited by a man viewid as the \"theoretician\" of the party (Etienne Borne); but it ceased publication for lack of readers. Jacques Fauvet admits that \"the principle of unity\" of this \"movement\" is \"emotional rather than intellectual\": \"being faithful to a tradition,\"11 that of the anti-conservative trend in French Catholicism between the 1830.'s and the Second World War. \"If one had to indicate the aims of the Christian Democrats, ten years after the foundation of their party,\" another journalist ? ?

Even those who believe that \"doctrine\" plays a dominant role in French politics agree that there is little of it among the Moderates, where one is usually content with rejecting Socialist errors, without however seriously attacking the social-economic status quo on behalf of less government interference. In his famous speech in Bayeux in 1946, de Gaulle furnished the organizations, which were to profess allegiance to him, the bases of a political doctrine by sketching a \"presidential\" constitution for France. In addition, there was the idea of an \"association between capital and labor\" as well as \"federalist\" words concerning the French Union. But during the years when Gaullist or ex-Gaullist movements were of importance in French politics (1947-1955), doctrine was shrinking rather than expand- ing. The major postulates of Gaullist ideology only rarely appeared in parliamentary speeches or in actual proposed legis- lation. It became unusual to hear a Gaullist leader say in the Assembly: We continue to strive for a presidential regime.13 On the whole, Gaullist speakers came to limit themselves to the affirmation that existing institutions were in need of radical revision; and that the salvation of France depended on the General's return to power. The only Gaullist periodical which had a somewhat doctrinal air ceased publication in 1953. At time the Gaullist criticism of the \"regime\" ceased to be peculiar to that group, and became what was widely felt to be a set of commonly accepted and predictably inoperative truisms. Though there is little \"doctrine\" in French politics, what does, -Of course, exist for each major political tendency, and what often gives the impression of \"doctrine,\" is a set of somewhat special and more or less-emotion-laden phrases. (These are-at present more important on the local level and in elections than. in parliamentary politics.

Often, by the way, the words to which adherents of a party are attached and which differentiate them best from partisans of other move- ments are not those by which the party would characterize itself; an instance would be the use of the adjectives \"human\" and \"new\" by the Christian Democrats. Also, the pantheons of the various tendencies are sometimes a bit strange. \"Neither Montalembert... nor LaTour du Pin...deserves to figure in the genealogy of the Christian Democrats,\"15 remarked, correctly, Jacques Fauvet in speaking about two prominent French Catholics of the nineteenth century. If they are nevertheleis claimed by the Christian Democrats, this is not by virtue of the efforts made by ingenious \"theoreticians\" who have interpreted them in the desired sense, but rather because one knows them little, cares less, and because their names appear mostly at ceremonial occasions when words are not taken too literally. In a frequently encountered view of French politics the many complicated doctrines to which the various tendencies are allegedly attached enter recurrently into passionate and pro- tracted combat; and inside each doctrine, it is claimed, anguishing struggles between its various components occur. At the occasion of \"political conflicts,\" Jacques Fauvet affirmed, \"ideological controversy is endlessly cultivated.\"16 'Whenever debate lasts for some time, it becomes for the Christian Democrat a conflict between justice and liberty, fdr the Radical a choice between the individual and the state, for the' Socialist one between reform and revolution.? I do not know of any evidence in the period of the Fourth Republic which would supportthis observation. To take one case, among the Socialists, the traditional conflict between \"Reformists\" and \"Marxists\" has almost entirely disappeared since the time when Daniel Mayer was replaced, after the liberation, by Guy Mollet,who presented himsdif as being more to the \"Left.\" In 1958, Mayer belongs to the Icainority\". within the party; but so does Andri Philip (who got himself expelled because he went farther than Mayer), who has been one of the most outspoken \"Reformists\" and who has never broken with his past.

Take the \"ideological\" debate on the operations of 1956-1958 in Algeria and on the future of that territory. Whatever the factual or moral worth of the conflict- ing positions, they were exceedingly simple and lacking in any doctrinal foundations. Has \"torture\" been applied in Algeria? Has it-been applied systematically? If it has been applied, can this be justified by the necessities of a \"war against subversion\" and by the \"atrocities\" committed by theTebels\"? IS it legiti- mate to speak about \"torture\" in public? What are its consequences for the course and outcome of the war? What are the effects of revealing its use? These were some of the questions around which the debate turned (to take only the problem of the \"special pro- cedures\" which may have been applied in Algeria). Just as one perceives here complication of thought, there was no \"search for an unattainable synthesis\": those who participated in these discussions tended rather to answer the questions which I mentioned with a definite yes or no. French politics, one often hears, is characterized by the \"primacy of the political,\"19 and by lack of interest in the economic. \"The most popular play in politics,\" notes an eminent observer, \"that which is always being played before a full house, is the debate on the constitution.\" \"Just as in 1848,\" one discusses \"the advantages of unicameralism and bicameralism, the powers of the Assembly as against those of the executive\". one continues to propose \"modifications\" of the electoral law:20,. It is astonishing to this commentator \"that there are still plain citizens: who follow with passion the exchanges of oratory con- cerning Article 9 or Article 17 of a constitution which has been changed fifteen times in the course of one hundred and seventy years, u21 But the number of such simple souls, though unknown, is, I believe, quite small. The last manipulation bearing on \"Article 9 or Article 17,\" prior to that of early 1958, occurred in 1953-and 1954. Among the events which interested the political class at that time and also managed, in various degrees, to arouse attention in the country, were: a long ministerial crisis in the Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-21874C 6-6-58 16. spring of 1953; sudden and large strikes of government employees during the summer; the election of a President of the Republic toward the end of the year; the conflict between the government and Marshal Juin; the fall of Dien Bien Phu; the replacement of Laniel by Mends-France as premier in the spring of 1954; the end of the war in Indochina; a new policy toward .Tunisia, and the rejection of EDC during the summer; the approach toward another formula for the rearmament of Western Germany in the fall. In the middle of all this a fairly small number of parliamentarians specialized in constitutional questions had a \"little reform\" Of the constitution voted by the Assembly, without any oratorical jousts, and with only a few members present. The country did not take notice. When, early in 1958, the government for the first time proposed a major revision of the constitution, the country did not abandon its indifference, and politicians were only mildly interested because one believed that nothing much. would actually happen: the revision might not be adopted; if passed, it would not make much difference. As to the alleged lack of interest in economics, it is indeed possible that the political class is less concerned than is the case in certain other democracies with important measures intended to influence the size of the national income and its distribution. But even if this could be established, it would still be erroneous to affirm that this differential is linked to the \"idealism\" by virtue of which, according to an observer, \"the French chambers were passionately discussing the question of ,crucifixes in courts of justice at a time When, at the beginning of the twentieth century, Britain and Germany were. concerned with their economic future.\"22 In an already remote past the rarity of parliamentary discussions of great economic problems expressed a hostile attitude toward the interference of the state into the economy. For a long time now the lack of concern with large economic issues has been accompanied by parliamentary absorption in a vast number of narrowly circum- scribed economic questions, most of which appear small to every- body except the limited category of those whose special interests are at itake. It has often been noted that parliament adopted the attitude of \"I don't want to know anything about it\" with regard to the various \"Monnet plans,\" but that it is indefatig- ably concerned with, for instance, \"the war prisoners' gratuity\": four hundred francs (approximately ninety cents) for one month of captivity. A deputy could, without sounding absurd, affirm that the. Assembly had \"devoted more time to the famous gratuity than it had to the Atlantic Pact, .the common market-, orAlgeria.\"23 * * * ? ? ?

The alleged domination of French political life by \"doctrine\" is supposedly complicated by what an observer calls \"the historical nature of our discussions.\"A Nothing, it is held, changes. According to an observer, The constitutional debate has lasted from 1792 on. One never tires of it. It is never necessary to get a new director for this play. The old dialogue is still effective 25 I have already indicated that in the Fourth Republic the constii. tutional debate is conducted only from time to time and in the midst of general indifference. In addition, the constitutional debate bears only on certain arrangements within the framework of the existing regime, a framework which nobody of any import- ance proposes to change. As to the matters on which it seems appropriate to advocate innovations, they are mainly thode which supposedly bear on the stability of governments: provisions concerning motions of confidence on censure and the right to dissolve parliament. Within this restricted sphere one is sometimes far removed from traditional alignments: _early in 1958, a \"Center\" or \"Left Center\" group (the Christian Democrats) advocated a reform of the constitution to which a.group of the \"Right Center\" or \"Right\" (the Moderates) objected. (The use of the words I have put into quotation marks fluctuates as these words have become less important. Cf. pp. 20-25.) The objection was that the reform would make the executive too independent of the legislative, while traditionally the :Right is supposed to be in favor of such an independence, and the Left inclined toward \"government by the Assembly.\" All this Beets very far from 1792. References to History are supposed to be very frequent in the rhetbric'of the day. Speaking of the conflict around EDC, Jacques Fauvet observed that: One is still for or against Mkinich. The partisans and the enemies of EDC have classed themselVdi in _ this fashion. They have treated each Other ea ten .of Munich, though nobody was ever able to find out . whether the anti-Munich people Were those Who re- jected the EDC so as not to recreate the militaty threat of Germany, or those who, it accepting'EDC, refused to capitulate to the Soviet menace.2b Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 18. However, a detailed analysis of the rhetoric on EDC would show, I believe; that the image of \"Munich\" was referred to quite infrequently and that its emotional charge was unimportant. \"The dead,\" affirmed the same author, \"are always dragged into our quarrels.\" \"When the communists,' he observed correctly, \"want to embarrass the Socialists, they bring out against them a quotation by Jean Jaures,\" who is indeed one of the most alive figures of the recent past; and \"the Radicals never fail to invoke Clemenceau,\"27 an affirmation which I do not believe to be equally correct. In parliament the Radicals almost never mention Clemenceau, just as little as they do their other \"ancestor,\" Camille Pelletan. Nor would it be very convenient to do otherwise, given the protracted conflicts between Clemenceau and the Radical Party and his famous words directed against it, as when he spokeabout the \"deaf-mutes of the seraglio\" conspir- ing to \"strangle\" him. Above all, the feelings which still remain attached to the name of Clemenceau, and the desire to look back- ward, apart from rare ceremonial occasions, appear insufficiently strong to Justify a frequent utilization of this or any other figure of the past. (As to Clemenceau, a close inspection of references to him would, I believe, also find that he is used just as much or more by the Right than by the Left: he is now mainly associated with 1917, a year of the Right in which he brought treason charges against Radicals.) As long as Edouard Herriot was alive, he was indeed abundantly cited and venerated at the congresses of his party. But at the first Radical Congress after his death, in the fall of 1957, his image, his words, his name were already virtually absent. The past often vanishes quickly. (It should, however, be kept in mind that the dimming of the past seems to be a general trend in the West, and one which has probablygone to greater lengths elabwhere than in France.) Take the Resistance. \"Every year,\" noted a journalist less than thirteen years after the liberation, \"but more and more discreetly sad anniversaries are being celebrated here andthere: the death of Jean Moulin, that of Pierre Brossolette.... A speech, a bunch of flowers in front of a marble_slab....arouse vague memories of a remote epoch to which some still remain attached.\"28 There may have been deli- berate exaggeration in this; but this would not detract from the significance of the statement. \"It La characteristicof Frenchmen,\" we are assRred by an analyst, \"to think of politics in terms of history.\"49 Thus, in the debate on EDC the future, supposedly, was quickly lost sight of: ? ? ? ?

Jean Monnet would be a new Charlemagne A lot of historic bric-a-brac was exhibited. The Count of Paris [the pretender to the throne -- N.L.] wrote that France had never been in such peril since the time of the Treaty of Troyes.3C\" But here again, I believe, closer inspection would show the slight importance of these glimpses into the past in comparison with the great visions which the enemies of EDC had. They claimed that that institution would have meant. the \"death of France.\" The ways in which that \"death\" would occur were indicated with only very few digressions into history. Only certain anti-clerical circles and small groups of Catholics that are of \"Gallican\" persuasion or particularly hostile to the Christian Democrats evoke the past more frequently. Current decisions, we are told, tend to be based on historical analogy. Thus the \"anti-Munich reflex\" supposedly played a capital role on the occasion of the Suez expedition in the fall of 1956. The argument that \"if one capitulates to force today, one only saves peace to lose it more surely\" gained political importance, according to Jacques Fauvet, only by virtue of the historical precedents which could be cited. This affirmation appears gratuitous: the conlict with Egypt in 1956 was the first occasion since the war when a use of French force, without_ that of the United States, appeared neither impossible (as it had in the case of possible conflicts with the Soviet Union) nor unquestionable (as in the French domain outside of conti- nental France). Thus there was a real analogy with the situation of the years preceding the war. One may be reminded of a past experience when the present one is remarkably similar and yet have no inveterate inclination toward harking back.' Many, we are told by an observer, aspire to make past regimes come to life again: With us dead regimes possess the property of surviving in many souls, and even in parties. In France one's real allegiance goes to a regime of the past.

Thus, ...the Orlians monarchy still lives on Two masses are read on the anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI. Two newsRfpers speak in the name of Charles Maurras.\" But what seems significant to me is precisely that royalism has disappeared from the list of significant political forces. Before the ver, L'Action Fran9aise was to be reckoned with on the Left Bank in Paris, and to a lesser extent throughout France by virtue of: its daily newspaper. Its successor, Aspects de la, France, is an obscure sect'. While the pretender has become a major figure in Parisian society, not a single parliamentarian would admit-to being, anything but \"republican.\" Instead of a multiplication of gestures of revolt in favor of dead regimes, a pervasive conformism appears to prevail. Recently, when a deputy of the extreme Right was speaking in the Assembly, the Left exclaimed, reviving the cry of the years of the popular .front: Fascism will not pass! The extreme Right responded: Fascism will not pass! On the rare occasions when the term is /still used, everybody is somebody else's \"Fascist.\" AccOrdifig to a widespread myth, France is divided against herself to kpeculiarly high degree under the sway of doctrine and history. The weight of the past and the attachment to ideas are supposed to be in large part responsible for the fact that there is always an opposition not only to the government in power but to the existing regime itself. It may be noted, however, that, apart from the Communists, the opposition, \"aiming to overthrow-the-regime by force if need be,\"32 hardly ever enjoyed sufficient strength during the Fourth Republic to envisage even the approaches to such revolutionary actions, the exception being the period from the fall of 1947 to the end of 1948 -- somewhat more than twelve months in the course of somewhat more than twelve. years.

RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 21. There is, one affirms, a fundamental split between the Right and the Left. Nobody could deny the importance of this division, but neither should it be exaggerated. It is exaggerated when one accepts the myth of a frankly anti-democratic Right: The Right desires passionately a reform of the- constitution.... The Right feels that any con- stitution based on \"the stupid law of numbers\" ought to be abrogated.33 But-whatever the unexpressed desires of the men of the Right may be, nobody can publicly question \"the stupid law of numbers\" in the Fourth Republic without thereby condemning himself to political insignificance. To the myth of a passionate Right corresponds that of a Left sufficiently ardent to induce politicians who really do not harbor Left sentiments to use its sacred vocabulary. One always cites instances of this practice from the period between 1879 and 1914; and one forgets to add that this phenomenon has since then very much declined. Jacques Fauvet recalled that \"men of the Right sitting at the Center\" of the Chamber called themselves during the Third Republic \"Republicans of the Left,\" or were members of the \"Radical Left,\" and that their successors in the Fourth Republic might belong to the \"Concentration of Left Republicans.\"34 But by now the use of Left vocabulary has become even more superficial than it already was at the time when Raymond Poincar4, a \"Republican of the Left,\" could proclaim that he was separated from the Right by \"the whole extent of the religious question.\" Today, the president of the Concentration of Left Republicans, Edgar Faure, can easily admit to a journalist that \"the ideas of 'the Left' and of 'the Right' can be considered as, in part, outdated. I see myself, and have doubtlessly always seen myself, as a man of the Center,\" who \"remains a member\" of \"what one continues to call in traditional fashion the 'Left.'\"35 (The weakening of traditional verbal Leftism indicated by these words is not contradicted by the diffusion of the term \"social\" in the name of parliamentary groups and parties which do not belong to the Left; for it does not seem that \"social\" is at present a word with a Left connotation.) While the Right disguises itself less and less as the Left, the Left presentsitself less and less as such: another sign of Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC - 6-6-58 22. the decline of this division. Because everybody is \"republican\" the Socialists, when they returned to \"participation\" in' the government in 1956, were looking for a somewhat less widely applied word to designate partners acceptable to them. For a time they tried \"democrats.\" But they had to abandon this attempt; for all parliamentary groups, with the exception of the communists and of the Poujadists, were \"condemned\" to \"live together\" in order to constitute a majority; and none wanted to be anything but \"democrats.\" In the new atmosphere a Radical, a Secretary of State, and an aspirant to the presidency of the republic (Andre Cornu) could eliminate an esthetically offensive statue of Gambetta from the court of the Louvre without creating any upset. Pierre Poujade, on the other hand, \"invokes in his speeches Jeanne d'Arc as well as 'our Robespierre.\"36 This despite the fact that Robespierre has until now been excluded, with a few other Jacobins and members of the extrane Left of the period, from the benefit of the good feelings which have developed toward all participants in the Great Revolution, from Charlotte Corday to Danton, from the Chouans to the Jacobins. However, in the spring of 1957 a proposal was made in the Assembly inviting the government to celebrate offi- cially the 200th birthday of Robespierre. Among the signatories of this proposal one finds not only, as one would indeed expect, a Socialist, a Left Radical, and a Radical of the Right (Edgar Faure), but also a Christian Democrat (Maurice Schumann) and, astonishingly, the very incarnation of the Right, Antoine Pinay. According to one journalist, personal motives are now necessary if somebody wants to resist everybody's tendency to approve everything: M. de Baudry d'Asson, a deputy from the Vendee, belonging to the Moderates, protested in the corridors of the Assembly against Pinay's concession: This is an insult to the memory of my guillotined ancestors .37 The incident (Antoine Pinay finally withdrew his signature) permits one to appreciate the extent to which the revolution, which was still so alive a hundred years after its occurrence, has receded into history as its 175th birthday approaches. In the Third Republic every major political tendency had its master historian of the revolution, from Taine to Mathiez. No more so. Unsettled questions have somehow been. left in suspense. Mathiez, for instance, wanted to prove that Danton was mainly a scoundrel. The charge appeared to be Serious, but it has not led to any definite grouping of defenders and detractorsof that personage. ? ? ?

The interest both of historians and of the general public in the revolution has sharply decreased: during the entire course of the Fourth Republic there has not been a single work on the revolution which has evoked great academic or general interest. (I am, here again, not talking about the communist domain, where a central directive seems to impose a higher level of attention to the revolution. It is, of course, significant that such a directive is being maintained; but it is-equally significant that the revolution seems to be in the process of being forgotten in the less organized sectors of the Left.) On the French stage, anti-revolutionary sentiments predominate on the rare occasions when the revolution is evoked. But even then history mainly serves as a vehicle for expressing themes which are beyond time (Bernanos' Dialogue of the Carmelite Sisters) or which refer to the present (Anouilh's Poor Bitos). In Parliament the apparent cordiality of relations between the Right and the Left often goes beyond mere politeness. After all, one is condemned to live together. Parliamentary \"arith- metic\" associates everybody with almost everybody else in the formation-of this or that majority. A Premier, when asking the Assembly to terminate its existence (Edgar Faure in the fall of 1955), could insist that personally he had no complaint against it: only thirteen of its members had never voted for him. In the name of the Moderates a deputy addressed himself to a Socialist Premier in the following terms: You lack neither courage nor good sense nor honesty. This is more than is required for leading the country to a better future.38 , Speaking of an attitude which he believed to be founded in a preference for \"France going it alone,\" a preference often attributed to the Royalist Charles Maurras, a Socialist leader declared: To be sure, the old doctrine of Maurras is not without grandeur.39 -- an admiision which contrasts with the violent tone, which had O almost-inViriably been adopted by the Socialists in the past toward the Royalistenemies of the Great Revolution. ?

On the occasion of a debate on Morocco, a Socialist who is sometimes still said to belong to a \"Left\" wing of the party (Edouard Depreux) was repeatedly interrupted by a Moderate belonging to the right wing of his group (Jean Legendre). When the speaker threatened the disturber with a parliamentary penalty, the Socialist reacted in this way: I beg you not to do this. If our opinions diverge, we are all profoundly moved by the abominable Franco-Moroccan drama .40 When, in parliament today, an opinion approved by someone on this side of the chamber is expressed by somebody else at the other end, this will not always prevent the first person expres- sing his full accord with the other. Thus, for instance, on one occasion the Assembly listened to a general (Adolphe Aumeran), who had the reputation of being a \"fossil,\" conclude a violent polemic against the EDC in a fashion which according to prevailing usage would be called \"nationalist\" (a term which has now become negative with everybody except a fringe on the extreme Right). , There was applause, \"on some benches of the Right\" and \"on the extreme Right,\" but also a \"Very good!\" from a Socialist, Max Lejeune.41 This Socialist was, to be sure, viewed as somewhat special in his party: he began his parliamentary career on its left wing and finished it on its extreme right wing. (Such marked shifts of individual position, which were frequent in the Third Republic, are now less customary.) Still, Lejeune always expressed his \"nationalist\" sentiments, and yet he acceded to high positions in Algeria and in the Sahara. On another occasion, another \"reactionary\" general (Joseph de Monsabert) stated his agreement with a prominent Socialist, a former governor-general of Algeria (Marcel-Edmond Naegelen). When the general proceeded to affirm that \"the correct policy in North Africa is to lean on former Moslem soldiers whom we must make into a privileged group,\" the Socialist, in his turn, exclaimed: 'Wry good!\"42 But it was this very same Socialist who, half a year before, was the candidate of_the Left (the Communists included) at the election of the President of the Republic; it was around his name that there arose, at certain moments of that election, what some observers called a popular-front atmosphere. And it was of him that another-Moderate whom the Left regarded as the representative of heavy industry in parliament (Pierre Andre) could say: We all know the magnificent work which . M. Naegelen has accomplished in Algeria.43 - ? ?

Yet another general, a right-wing Gaullist (Pierre Koenig) attributed to the Socialist Robert Lacoste \"a conception of a powerful France which is very close to mine, \"44 without thereby creating any difficulty for the man of the Left in his own party. A certain community of views of all the \"national\" parties between the Communists and the extreme Right was equally implied when a Socialist (Edouard Depreux) spoke of those \"whom M. Pinay once excellently called the aggressive extreme Right.\"45 At the fair of Lyons in 1952, Edouard Herriot, mayor of the city.and \"demi-god\" of the Fourth Republic, posed for photographers between Cardinal Gerlier, the Archbishop of Lyons, and the Count of Paris, pretender to the throne of France. In the summer of 1957, on the occasion of the marriage of the \"Dauphin\" at Dreux, numerous parliamentarians attended. M. Edgar Faure is present. A joke is attributed to him, which he surely did not make, just as little as the Count of Paris pronounced the words With which he is credited. Here is the story. So many parliamentarians were present that the prince exclaimed with a smile: -- Well, gentlemen, why don't we use this occasion for a small Council of Ministers? -- Oh, no, Monseigneur, answered M. Edgar Faure, not in this heat.46 The mayor of Dreux was a Radical of the Left, Maurice Viollette. Uniting the royal couple, he declared: A Frenchman should be able to greet the tricolor without insulting the fleurs-de- lys.46 The weakening of the conflict between the Right and the Left is accompanied by the rise of the feeling that the policy to be-followed in any given situation is commanded by \"facts\" rather than by doctrine; that facts usually admit only small differences between the policies which reasonable men might advocate. \"Most of the speeches made by Premiers,\" an observer noted, \"tend_to prove that anybody else in their place would have acted just as they did.\"47 And a minister (Edgar Faure) observed, Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 26. 'That_ the coalition, on which the government is atpresent based, should be enlarged,\" by adding the Socialists to all the other \"national\" groups already participating in it, \"is an opinion which I am expressing all the more gladly as I have always indicated to our Socialist friends that only their own refusal keeps themaway from power.\" But whatever the composition of the majority,. it could not pursue other aims, in the economic sphere, than those which we have set ourselves. I should even like to affirm that no majority could use other means than those which we are using .48 The same politician, when violently attacked in an/election campaign, protested \"that he has not been able to discover 'the smallest difference of doctrine' between him and his enemies.\"49 \"It has been said,\" he noted with approval when he was Premier, \"that all previous governments have pursued an identical policy.\" This is true: \"We ought to become aware of this.\" But what about the preceding government, that of Pierre Mendes-France, \"which seemed in so many ways to depart\" from the line of the other governments? Even that cabinet, he maintained, \"pursued the same policy as the others,\" just as \"my government pursues the same policy as that of Mendes-France.\"50 A Socialist leader -- seeking the premiership at a moment when his party had not participated in governments for more than three years 7- expressed this theme in a less trenchant form: If the continuity of governmental activity does not always express itself in the conflict of our ideas, it remains an important fact of the political life of the nation.51 Answering a near-communist (Pierre Cot), a Premier (Filix Gaillard) recalled how. narrow the margins are within which one chooses when in powa.: As a \"goockstudent of the School of Political Science,\" as you have called me, I greet you as the great rhetorician who has been reasoning in the abstract for so many years...where one does not have to deal with the human and material reality of a country.

You cannot choose either to sacrifice youth and the future. There are many things which you cannot sacrifice. It is for this reason that to govern this country is difficult, and it is for this reason that governing it proceeds by decisions which are being made every day. As things are, one does what is possible. One does not proceed by major choices but by small settlements which have to be made every day. One subtracts a little from what one wanted to do. One asks the overseas terri- tories to slow up their plans a bit, as continental France has been doing; one asks the nation to deprive itself a bit. ? ? ? One is manipulating not intellectual data but real margins, and that is where the difficulty lies.52 The \"difficulty\" -- apart from that of being an \"umpire\" between conflicting demands (see Chapter 5, pp. 145-146) is that of making the right \"wager\" rather than that of applying true doctrine. Thus, a man of the Right, opposing in the fall of 1955 the policy of Edgar Faure toward Morocco, a policy approved by the Left, explained: I affirm that if Mohammed Ben Youssef returns to France, he will, after some time, inevitably also 'return to the throne of Morocco. You do not be- lieve that this will be the case, and we believe that it will. This is the wager.... ? ..as I said a moment ago, it is a matter of a wager. There are those who believe that the present policy is correct; they are sincere. I ask them to believe that we are equally sincere when we tell them that we don't think it is.53 - Another Moderate deputy emphasized the same theme, by virtue of which the earlier abyss between the Right and the Left was being replaced by simple divergences between forecasts concerning a future which it was, in any case, impossible to predict with certainty: Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 28. As M. Barrachin said a moment ago, it is not surprising that we are divided on difficult and anguishing subjects. Future events will decide between us, events which are unknown to all of us.54 The abatement in the conflict between the Left and the Right implies a reduction in the antagonism between what used to be called the clerical and the anti-clerical parties. The Left has, in fact, accepted the numerous changes which have made the separation between church and state less \"rigid.\" Jacques FaiiVet recalls: Intransigent partisans of a meticulous separation between church and state feel that it has been, unnoticeably, undone. In 1956 a deputy called for full observance of the law of 1905 establishing that separation. This parliamentarian, a Socialist, pointed out that representatives of the government have been participating in ceremonies of beatifi- cation; that members of the clergy and deans of schools of Catholic theology have been given official recognition on public occasions; that priests are receiving compensation in their quality as guardians of churches which are public buildings: 16,000 francs per year. Finally, .iiibsidies to Catholic schools are considered a direct violation of the principle of separation.55 But apart from the last point, the few deputies who get excited about sudh2clerical offensives\" or \"the capitulation of the government before the priests\" appear by now archaic, like the few remaining Marxists outside the communist camp. According to the conventional phrases of the present, the noun \"anti- clericalism\" calls for the adjective \"outdated\", just as much ' as does the noun \"nationalism.\" Only provincials of the \"French desert\" of the southwest are still supposed to be engaging in that sport of 1900, \"eating priests\" -- just as the dream of a return to a state religion is supposed to be entertained only in other backward areas, for instance in the west. According to Jacques Faavet, \"the problem of Catholic schools...could be managed in_concrete fashion,\" if it were left \"on the municipal or regional level,\" while it becomes \"insoluble\" once it has _ ? ? ?

Each camp is afraid of exploiting temporary advantages: might it not thereby provoke a later disastrous counter-offensive of the other side which would have been unduly exacerbated.? ThUs, the slight parliamentary majority in favor of Catholic schools which resulted from the elections of 1951 did not go beyond grant- ing a quite limited subsidy to these schools in the so-called Barange Law of 1951; and the equally slight majority hostile to Catholic schools which resulted from the elections of 1956 has refrained from abrogating that law. In the campaigns preceding both these general elections, the problem of state subsidies to Catholic schools -- the only major problem in the relations between church and state which does not yet appear settled -- played but a minor role, by virtue of mutual restraint. In order to survive, governments tend to proclaim their neutrality when this question comes up before parliament (Rena Pleven in 1951; _Guy Mollet in 1956). The tacit agreement to preserve the status quo is accompanied by a rather strict taboo: in national politics one must avoid publicly pronouncing words which might make the quarrel flare up again. 'Affirming that \"the problem of Catholic schools\" becomes \"philosophic\" when it appears in parliament, Jacques Fauvet maintains: When that matter comes up, the deputies soon begin to discuss the existence of God.57 But it has become impossible in parliament even to name Him, whether one be for or against. Fifty years ,ago a leader (Rent Viviani)1, justifying the creation of a Ministry of Labor, exclaimed: We have been devoting ourselves, all of us together,...to an enterprise hostile to religion. We have torn faith out of the human conscience. When a human being living in misery bent his knees, fatigued by the ' burdens of the day, we have helped him to stand erect again, and we have told him that behind the clouds there are only chimeras. All together, in a magnificent gesture, We Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 30. have extinguished the lights in heaven; they shall never be lighted again.58 The chamber voted, 340 against 128, that the speech of the Minister-of Labor be printed and posted on walls throughout the country. Today a parliamentarian using such language would be regarded as mad. Militant atheism has greatly declined, and the expression of whatever there remains of it is ruled out in parliament -- just as religious believers in the Assembly are very discreet about their faith. It is extremely rare for them to mention the name of their religion; the Christian Democrats call themselves the Popular Republican Movement and very rarely use words referring to ragion. The battles of oratory of half a century ago have been replaced by tiny incidents. When some Christian Democrats in the Assembly recalled \"Munich\" to Edouard Daladier, he answered rudely, \"Stop croaking,\" the raven being a popular image of a priest. Depicting the future reduction of the country's current deficit in power by virtue of nuclear energy, a Moderate (Andre Mutter) recalled that a Socialist (Felix Gouin) had said that this new source of energy was arriving \"providentially.\" The Catholic Moderate added: If a member of another group had used this adverb, it might have appeared suspect. Coming from M. Gouin, it is perfectly apt (Laughter).9 These are the kinds of asides in which the former war between clericalism and anti-clericalism survives. When an observer of high reputation maintains that ...it is always possible to stage another performance of Faust in the Opera, and another debate on clericalism in the Palais Bourbon...60 he is expressing a belief which, for all the frequency of its occurrence, is quite far from incontrovertible facts. During the first half of the century the importance of the conflict between clericals and anti-clericals was expressed in the fact that insistence on a strict separation between church and state seemed to be central to the position of the most power- ful party of that period, the Radical Party. In 1951, a minority of the Radicals in parliament voted in favor of subsidies to Catholic schools, thereby contributing to the most important victory of-the \"clericals\" since the beginning of the century. The vote of the Radical minority, however, did not lead to any ? ? ?

While it has been rent by various divisions in the course of the present decade and, for the first time in its history, beset by major splits, the exist- ence of _a minority which in 1951 had voted with the \"clericals\" on the \"school\" issue played no role in this action. In these circumstances it is difficult to perceive, as many nevertheless do, a continued attachment of the Radicals to their tradition of insisting on a separation between church and state.61 A Radical who had voted for the Barange Law was subsequently Minister of Education throughout several governments (Andre Marie). Another Radical who occupied this post later (Rene Billeres) is supposed to be a practicing Catholic. Near the beginning of the century this rumor, or this fact, would have been of political importance: today it is not. It was only in 1955 that the party forbade its members to belong to the Asso- ciation for the Freedom of Teaching, the most important clerical pressure group in the fight for subsidies to Catholic schools. Why did the Radicals outlaw membership in an organization to which, according to the usual notions, no Radical could be expected to belong? Simply because the vice president of this organization was a prominent Radical (Bernard Lafay) who parti- cipated, for instance, in a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in which France was dedicated to the local saint. The general election of 1956 seemed to have furnished a slight majority in favor of the abrogation of the law of 1951 granting subsidies to Catholic schools. But February 17, 1956, the Assembly refused, 288 against 279, to set a date for a dis- cussion and vote on the proposal to abrogate that law. Among the 288 deputies who, in fact, thus voted for the maintenance of the law, there were nineteen Radicals, and among them not only individuals belonging to the right wing of the party but also several deputies close to Mendes-France. One week later the Assembly repeated its stand, this time with 301 against 276 votes, and the Radicals played the same role on this occasion. Toward the end of the year, the Assembly reaffirmed its stand, 291 against 282. Among the 291 who, this time, decisively , perpetuated the granting of subsidies to Catholic schools, there were 26 Radicals, and among them again various deputies devoted to Mendes-France. If all those Radical deputies who followed Mendes, say, on Algeria, had been determined to have the Barange Law abrogated, it would have been. Thus, the victory obtained' by the clericals in 1951 was consolidated in 1956 by Radicals : belonging-to the left wing of the party, particularly those who, on January 2, 1956, had been elected in the metropolitan area of Paris by voters who had previously favored Gaullists or Christian Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 32. Democrats, and by young voters of the \"Christian Left.\" In these conditions it is fair to say that the \"classical\" division between Right and Left has ceased to exist. But when \"a period of intense conflict\" arrives, does one not then encounter again, in the words of an observer, \"the Left_ and the Right facing each other, ready for battle, excluding all compromise \"762 This does not seem to be the case either. The division of the political class of 1939 among those who \"resisted\" the Germans, those who took up a \"wait-and-see\" atti- tude, and those who \"collaborated\" split both the Right and the Left: members of both these pre-war halves of the political class were found in substantial numbers within each of the new groupings. A parliamentarian (Paul-Boncour) recalled the 10th of July, 1940, in Vichy when he was one of the eighty who refused to vote the end of the Third Republic: Upon meeting others taking up the same position, one was amazed to find oneself together, as so many among us had fought in opposed camps. Num- erous parliamentarians among those who voted together on this occasion told me: \"If I had only known!\"63 The EDC treaty was rejected because numerous Socialists, Radicals, and Moderates voted against it, so that three amon& .th.t.livelar-enoncon\".ME2_?.1.1arlcP-1.11.?Adedon that issue. As to the problems of North Africa since 1954, each group had its \"liberals\" as well as those who were in favor of a _!'strong\" policy. Among the Moderates, where the latter prevailed, there was Antoine Pinayolho granted independ- ence to Morocco and was supposed to have been for a long time in favor of greater concessions to the Algerian Nationalists - than the governments since 1956 were willing to grant. Among the ex-Gaulligts, Jacques Soustelle was in favor of \"firmness\"; but many attributed to the silent General de Gaulle a willing- ness to envisage rather loose forms of association between metropolitan France and her domain overseas. Among the Christian Democrats, Georges Bidault was close to the majority of the Moderates, but Robert Schuman was said to envisage \"liberal\" solutions. As to the Radicals, Maurice Bourges-,Maunoury, Felix Gaillard, and Andre Morice were responsible for a policy on Algeria which was violently combatted by Pierre Mendes-France, ?

The Radicals in power collaborated on Algeria with the Socialists Robert Lacoste, Guy Mollet, Max Lejeune, who were in turn opposed by their comrades Gaston_Defferre, Edouard Depreux, Daniel Mayer. Thus, many mem- bers of the Right felt close to Lacoste, while on the Left many counted on a man of the Center such as Edgar Faure, and even on the very incarnation of the Right, Antoine Pinay. \"Within one month,\" Jacques Fauvet recalls, \"a Radical leader was overthrown by another Radical and replaced by a third one.\"64. Early in February 1955, Rene Mayer's conduct was decisive in having Pierre Mendes-France overthrown, to be replaced, toward the end of the month, by Edgar Faure. Mayer, whose constituency was the Department of Constantine, seems to have feared that Mendes-France would initiate an unduly \"liberal\" policy in Algeria. A convinced \"European,\" he may have held Mendes responsible for the rejection of the EDC. His rather unsatisfactory four months as Premier early in 1953 may have disposed him against the so much more brilliant and noisy record which Mendes made fortimself in the same position; and his hostility may have been increased by the frequent allusions of Mendes to the unsatisfactory per- formance of his predecessors. As to Edgar Faure, it was difficult, in the winter of 1955, to indicate the differences between his general-orientation and that of Mendes, in whose government he had played a leading role, first as Minister of Finance and then as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Ten months later the conflict between these two men was to be a major factor in French politics: but even then it had not become much clearer what their actual differences were, as to policies recommended or executed. In the meantime, Edgar Faure, as Premier, had continued the economic policy for which he had already been responsible under Mendes. He had not changed the country's foreign policy. He had pursued Mendes's new line toward Tunisia, granting it \"internal autonomy.\" He had \"opened the Moroccan file\" and arrived at a solution of unsurpassed \"liberalism,\" namely the independence of Morocco -- an outcome which everybody would have refused at the beginning of the -year had it at all appeared as a practical possibility. In Algeria there resided a governor general whose designation by Mendes-France had been a major factor in his downfall, Jacques Soustelle, who was then regarded by those attached to the status quo as a dangerous innovator. But Mendes presented himself to France as a reformer, while Faure gave the impression of pursuing day-to-day compromises which were supposed to render possible the continuation of the rapid economic advance started in 1953.

Chapter 2 THE STRUGGLE AGAINST RESPONSIBILITY Members of the political class often attempt to diminish their responsibility by claiming a presumption of innocence (p.35); by affirming that reality and the government are too complex to allow the imputation of definite responsibilities to definite persons (p. 36); by avoiding the very question of responsibility (pp. 36-4); by passing the buck (pp. 40-41); by arranging for a diffusion of responsibility (pp. 41-48); by avoiding being put into positions of committing actions, which might burden them with responsibility (pp. 48-51) however strong the need for such actions may be on other grounds; by arranging for others to act in their place (PP. 52-59); or, if they have to act themselves, to do so as little as possible ( p. 60), by provoking others to commit an overt break or refusal through the device of attaching impossible conditions to ostensible agreement (PP. 61-65); by appropriately timing their alternations between being in and out of power (pp. 66-73); by keeping themselves ignorant of actions of subordinates (pp. 73-74); by tacitly or explicitly delegating their powers at awkward moments (pp. 74-75). The Minister of Foreign Affairs (Yvon Delbos) had to inform the Council of Ministers of numerous developments un- favorable to France; it was in-the winter of 1937. Wanting to break \"the depressed silence\" which followed his words, the Minister assured the President of the Republic and his colleagues \"with forced good humor\" that he would have preferred giving-them \"less distressing information.\" At that moment the President (Albert Lebrun) gave him a friendly slap on the shoulder and claimed with \"affectionate sympathy\": \"But, of course; my dear Minister, everybody knows that this isn't your fult!\"1 The words of the President of the Republic illustrate the myth of its own egoism so largely accepted in the political class: Why should Yvon Delbos have been dis- tressed by the perils of the situation if they did not en- danger his personal position? But also, and this is what interests us here, it appears that if things in the important ? domain with which I am charged go quite badly, there is no presumption that I am in any way responsible: I am held to be innocent until a proof to the contrary is furnished.

Such a proof seems singularly difficult to establish. Often it appears impossible to locate those responsible; such is, to-those who know politics from the inside, the jumble of jurisdictions and activities. Only the ignorant public will easily and summarily attribute responsibilities. \"Please recall the last electoral campaign,\" an eminent parliamentarian (Pierre-Henri Teitgen) asked his colleagues. \"Whichever your party, you were then vehemently reproached with attitudes which you had not adopted or which you had combatted, with decisions which you had disapproved.\"' This Professor of Law wanted to illustrate the consequences of existing institutions which should be reformed. But beyond this, the errors of the public in imputing responsibilities seem natural to the political class: only specialists can judge. On its part, that class uses but attributing responsibility to persons levels of the apparatus of the state. is an important tendency to avoid, in question of responsibility. little the device of or agencies on lower On the other hand there various ways, the very It repeatedly happens that politicians of the first rank view the past in which they have been operating as if they had been nothing but particularly well-informed observers. on June 16, 1940, Sir Edward Spears, Winston Churchill's repre- sentative lb Bordeaux, met Paul Reynaud who had just resigned from the.Premiership, and listened to his account of the beginning of the last ministerial crisis of the Third Republic. He was going through a necessary formality, a producer giving an account of the last disastrous -performance of a play to its backers. The.curtain had been rung down, it was over, he must think of his own plans.? The occasion was one which no longer concerned him, and the details did not gteatly matter. He was at pains to underline his detachment.3 Weygand, with a look of absolute exasperation, lifted his hand, turned his head toward Reynaud and said with a voice like a saw on steel: \"This war is sheer madness, we have gone to war with a 1918 army against a German army of ?????epr ? ? ?

Four hundred fighters and thirty bombers capable of flying by day, and that for the whole of our front; our tanks are inadequate and insufficient, ridiculously few in numbers.\" He went on in this-strain, finally declaring that not only were the prac- tical means of waging war totally lacking, but the whole strategic theory on which our plans had been made was mistaken.4 Not until 1956 did General Weygand publish the volume of his memoirs in which he attempted to prove that these judgments merely repeated views which he had formulated as long as ten years before the collapse when he occupied high positions in the French armed forces. But apparently many of those to whom Weygand talked in 1940 did not know this. To them his attitude appeared as based on a forgetting of his own responsibilities which seemed both \"normal\" and shocking. This was also the reaction of General de Gaulle, who listened to a similar statement by Weygand two weeks later: The Commander-in-chief, who had been chief of the General Staff between 1930 and 1935, set forth the reasons for the defeat of the armies commanded by him in the sober, though aggressive, tone of somebody who complains about a stat @ of affairs for which he is not responsible.' These words seem applicable to an attitude taken by another leader in another issue at another point in history. In the spring of 1953 Robert Schuman, who had left the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a few months previously after having occupied that office for several years, analyzed in a public statement the relations between France and her two protectorates: It is said that France has no policy in North Africa (Morocco and Tunisia). That is true in the sense that she has not yet chosen between several possible policies.... The two Residents General form the highest level of the hierarchy....Their field of initiative is vast...and they have tended to norinccifipri in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 38. enlarge upon it, particularly in those cases where their own views coincide with those of the local French population....The technique of the fait accompli is the great and incessant ,temptation which the Residents General meritori- ously resist, to the extent to which they do not succumb to' it. The relation between the government and the Residents General is-to some extent reproduced by that between the Residents General and certain among their services (-Police, information, etc3...which are not effectively controlled by them. Above the Residents General the Minister of Foreign Affairs is responsible for their acts which are supposed to conform to his own views. This is one of those fictions on which democracy is based....This fiction does not take account of the fact that, first of all, the government exercises but limited influence on events in North Africa and on the men who represent France there, and controls them only to a limited extent. In addition... the determination of policy is entrusted to the government, that is, to a collegial body within which the advice of the responsible Minister does not necessarily prevail. He may, of course, resign....But can he easily take it upon him- self to provoke such an upset? ...In addition, democracy implies that the decisions of the executive be the result of divergent opinions. I have gained the conviction that no important feform in the relations between France on the one hand and Morocco and Tunisia on the other will be possible unless everybody returns to ? the exact notions of responsibility and hierarchic subordination.

But what outsider would have suspected that the person who talked in this way had been for years responsible for the sad state of affairs which he was describing so calmly? \"Since the former Minister of Foreign Affairs has left the Quai d'Orsay,\" wrote a journalist who was expressing a wide-spread opinion, \"he writes and he speaks as if he had not been for three years the absolute master of our diplomacy.\" As Robert Schuman was viewed as a politician with particularly high moral standards, this journalist interpreted his conduct as falling under the great law of the discrepancy between the pretensions and the conduct of authority. \"This pious man makes his mea culpa on the breast of others.\"7 In fact, an examination of Schuman's statement reveals no allega- tion of new developments which had intervened since his de- parture from the Ministry, and which might have permitted him to differentiate between what should have been done before 1953 and what was to be done henceforth. But if this is so, what if one were to apply to the author himself \"exact notions of responsibility?\" Was it only after the end of his tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs that \"the establishment of an adequate policy\" began to be a matter which \"brooks no delay?\" Two and a half years later, the Premier, Edgar Faurel, described to the National Assembly the aggravation of the tension between high French officials in Morocco and the government. This politician, who habitually speaks in a tone of studied moderation, expressed his indignation about mis- conduct ighich had become almost normal: It is high time that all this stop: Such resignations, taken back and then' offered again, must occur no more:...No resignations of high civil servants anymore, let us have obedience: I do not know whether the govern- ment over which I preside in these difficult circumstances will last. But I can say that I have finally understood what I had sometimes only guessed. There must be an end to conduct which leads to the disintegration of the state. It is the government which governs, and if this government remains, it will govern:8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 40. At the moment at which he talked in this vein the Premier could look back on seven months of office, which is more than the average life of a government. In the fall of 1953, after the surprising strikes of the summer, various parties represented in the government thought it wise to distantiate themselves from it without, however, withdrawing their support. A journalist observed: . All these groups expressed themselves as if they did not belong to the majority and as if they were not represented in the govern- ment, which, however, most of them have been for the last seven years.9 That politicians treat as non-existent the responsibilities which they have incurred in the past is, no doubt, a reaction which may be observed anywhere. What is perhaps distinctive of contemporary France is that this reaction appears both as \"normal\" and horrifying to members of the political class themselves. This conduct is one of the many aspects of that permanent scandal, the behavior of those in power, not only according to a sentiment widespread in the country, but also to a feeling important within their own ranks. The incidents which I have quoted thus often seem not so much to illustrate the point that anything may happen, but rather to render starkly visible the very nature of the political animal: If he speaks so easily of the past as if he had had no share in determining what happened, is it not because he possesses (and must possess to survive and to rise) a remarkable capacity for disengagement from past responsibilities? And is that capacity not one of the many signs of his basic egoism? * If I do not avoid the very question of responsibility, I may as a politician still attempt to reduce my own. Of course, I may say, I have been connected with such and such a policy which now appears in a dubious light; but it was above all the policy of certain of my colleagues. (If they apply the same device, there arises the classical situation in which every- body places responsibility on someone else.) In' 1952, at the time of the signing of the treaty instituting a European Defense Community, two men appeared to be the protagonists of the \"European\" tendency: Robert Schuman, Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RN-2187-RC 6-6-58 41. Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Rene Pleven, Minister of National Defense. Towards the end of the year the government fell:- \"Parliamentary arithmetic\" indicated an extension of the majority to include the \"anti-European\" Gaullists. Their \"entrance\" into the majority, which was accomplished after two weeks of crisis through the new government of Rene Mayer, was prepared by the semblance of an effort at forming a government made by the Gaullist Jacques Soustelle. Received by him, Rabert Schuman supposedly let it be understood that it was not he who had been chiefly responsible for the EDC treaty, but rather Rene Pleven. Whether Schuman said this or not, the story -- and this alone is important here -- gained currency in the political class. A few days after the fall of Dien Bien Phu, a deputy described the reactions of those ministers who seemed in various ways especiallyimplicated in this defeat: One had the impression that the Ministers placed the responsibility on each other and diffused their several versions of who was responsible through their attaches in the corridors of the Assembly.10 A picturesque manifestation of the limits of ministerial soli- darity. A year and a half later, during the electoral campaign of Deoember, 1955, a candidate \"is being reproached at a meeting for having been a member of the government at the moment of Dien Bien Phu.\" He answered: \"I was Minister of War and not Minister for the Associated States of Indochina.\"- Given the way in which jurisdiction over operations in Indochina was divided in Paris, this argument does not lack validity. But on the level of feelings it is not entirely conviticing, not even in the political class: it is often easy to perceive a determination to \"pass the buck\" at any cost even behind quite good excuses, if they are not one's own. 7 What is much more persuasive there is to say: to be sure, I am responsible. But so are you; so is almost everybody -- an insistence on the diffusion of responsibility which is a special form of \"buck-passing.\" Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/09/13: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300020002-8 RM-2187-RC 6-6-58 42. - As the life of a government is so short (which makes one sometimes overlook the fact that the average presence of a Minister in a given Ministry lasts noticeably longer), it is very often possible to affirm that the life of a certain policy extended over several governments; why, then, pick on any one of them? The actions which it took may have been rendered inevitable by those of its predecessors; and it may have done nothing more than maintain an already established ?groove.\" The possibility.of having recourse to such arguments constitutes one of the many advantages of governmental in- stability, advantages which are, of course, rarely mentioned, but which contribute to perpetuating this instability despite its universal condemnation in public statements, and in the face of the intermittent onslaughts of reformers. Thus, to take a minor instance, a parliamentarian can co"
