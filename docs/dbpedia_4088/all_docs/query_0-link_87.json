        "text": "April 27th\n\nThe Feast Day of Saint Assicus, a contemporary and friend of St Patrick, who became the first Bishop of Elphin in (what is now) the North of the Irish Republic. Assicus was a renowned metalworker, and it was as a coppersmith that he became acquainted with Patrick, and a skilled Bell Founder. His followers established a school of Arts & Crafts in his memory, but he wasn't universally popular - and it was the result of a slanderous story told about him that led to Assicus' death; so ashamed was he of the reputation attached to his name that he fled his community and lived as a hermit for seven years. His followers eventually found him and persuaded him to return, but his spartan lifestyle had weakened him so much that he died on the journey home.\n\nIt's also Freedom Day in South Africa, commemorating the date of the first non-racial democratic elections held in the country on this date in 1994 -- and UnFreedom Day, also in South Africa, established in 2005 to highlight the lack of access to democracy for the poor and homeless in South Africa. The South African government attempted to ban events in 2009, in a move whose irony obviously went over their heads - and the police were anyway prevented from taking action by the crowds at the demonstration.\n\nAlso on this Date: Umayyad troops under Ṭāriq ibn Ziyād invade Gibralta, beginning the Muslim conquest of Hispania (711 - WIKI gives both this date and April 30th); Edward I defeats the army of Scottish King John Balliol at the Battle of Dunbar, and takes the Stone of Scone home with him as a souvenir :\"I've brought the kids some rock like they asked\" (1296); the Battle of Carbisdale, in which Royalists attempt to impose Charles II as King without the conditions demanded by the Scottish Government (1650); Samuel Simmons pays John Milton a total of £10 [worth about £2500 today] for the exclusive copyright to Paradise Lost (1667 - seven years later, Simmons gives Milton's widow £8 - £1500 - for all the remaining manuscripts of her husband that she still has); Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks is premiered [with \"no fiddles\" by Royal Command] in Green Park, London (1749); in spite of the heroic efforts of Sybil Ludington overnight, British forces attack Connecticut and win the Battle of Ridgefield (1777 - something of a pyrrhic victory, as this galvanises previously indifferent settlers to take arms to defend their property and rights); Beethoven completes, signs and dates the manuscript of his piano bagatelle, Fur Elise (1810); the London Zoo opens in Regent's Park (1828); Mississippi Steamship, Sultana, carrying over 2000 passengers [1400 of them ex-prisoners of the American Civil War being taken back to their homes] sinks after the four boilers explode - 1,168 people are killed (1865 - the boat has a capacity for 376 passengers, but the Captain has found the $2.75 per soldier offer too tempting); Gounod's Romeo et Juliette is premiered at the Lyric Theatre, Paris (1867); Massenet's opera Le roi de Lahore is premiered at the Palais Garnier, Paris (1877); Chris Watson becomes Australia's third Prime Minister, and the first leader of a Labour Government anywhere in the world (1904); the fourth Olympic Games, and the first held in Britain, open in London (1908); the first half of Fritz Lang's four-and-a-half-hour-long silent film Dr Mabuse the Gambler, is released in Germany (1922 - the remaining two hour conclusion is released a month later; the whole film is itself the first in a trilogy); Himmler approves the site used for the building of Auschwitz 1, which receives its first prisoners a month later (1940 - exactly three tears later to the day, Polish Resistance agent Witold Pilecki escapes from the Camp, where he has deliberately allowed himself to be held in order to gather information and evidence); Athens falls to Nazi invaders (1941 - the Greek forces had inflicted a humiliating defeat on Mussolini's forces earlier in the year, something Hitler could not allow to go unpunished); the last German troops retreat from Finland (1945 - on the same day, Mussolini is captured by anti-fascist Italisn partisans as he tries to escape to Germany); Sierra Leone wins independence from the United Kingdom (1961); Arnold Wesker's Chips With Everything is premiered at the Royal Court Theatre (1962 - John Noakes is in the cast); Afghan president Mohammed Daoud Khan is assassinated in a coup d'etat (1978); Austrian President Kurt Waldheim is banned from entering the United States for his wartime activities (1987); Betty Boothroyd becomes the first [and, so far, only] woman speaker of the House of Commons (1992); the contract to begin construction of the One World Trade Center is signed (2006);\n\nBirthdays Today include: Mary Wollstonecraft (1759); Hyacinthe Jadin (1776); Charles Robert Cockerell (1788); ... .- -- ..- . .-.. / -- --- .-. ... . (1791); Friedrich von Flotow (1812 - the Paris Conservatoire was his alma martha); Ulysses S Grant (1822); Edward Whymper (1840); Serge Prokofiev (1891); Nicolas Slonimsky (1894); William Carrothers (1896); Cecil Day-Lewis (1904); Philip Radcliffe (1905); Guido Cantelli and Edwin Morgan (both 1920); Jack Klugman (1922); Igor Oistrach (1931); Casey Kasem (1932); Geoffrey Shovelton (1936); Judy Carne (1939); Michael Fish (1944); Russel T Davies (1963); Anna Chancellor (1965); Darcey Bussell (1969); Olari Elts (1971); Sally Hawkins (1976); Dai Fujikura (1977); and Jenna Coleman (1986).\n\nFinal Days for: Ferdinand Magellan (1521); Jan van Goyen (1656); Sigismond Thalberg (1871); William Macready (1873); Ralph Waldo Emerson (1882); Alexander Scriabin (1915); Hart Crane (1932); Antonio Gramsci (1937); Edmund Husserl (1938); Arthur Shields (1970); Olivier Messiaen (1992); and Mstislav Rostropovich (2007).\n\nAnd the Radio 3 schedules for the morning of Sunday, 17th April, 1969 were:\n\nWhat's New? (a weekly programme of recent records)\n\nBach Cantatas: BWVs 103 & 12\n\nYour Concert Choice: (a request programme of gramophone records)\n\nMusic Magazine with features on Searle's Hamlet; Berlioz' Memoirs; Witold Lutoslawski; Duke Ellington at 70\n\nApril 28th\n\nThe Feast Day of husband-and-wife Saints Vitatis and Valeria of Milan, very early Christians (late first/early second Century) - the former killed after he'd made his faith obvious by showing support and compassion to another Christian. Vitalis was tortured and then buried alive. Valeria was either beaten so severely after refusing to celebrate the Roman gods that she died of her wounds, OR was tortured and beheaded after attempting to give Christian martyrs a ... well, Christian burial. Vitalis and Valeria had two sons, Gervasius and Protasius, both of whom are also venerated as saints.\n\nAnd it's International Workers' Memorial Day, a worldwide day of remembrance for those hundreds of thousands of workers each year killed, injured, disabled, or made unwell at their place of work. This is its 40th anniversary, and I cannot remember its being mentioned in Britain, nor ever seeing anyone wearing the purple ribbon commemorating the dead - or, for that matter, ever seeing them on sale. My bad - there were processions in Manchester in 2012.\n\nAlso on this Date: the \"Good Parliament\" sits for the first time, intending to root out corruption in the English Court and to reform Government in England (1376 - sitting for nearly three months, the longest parliament ever at that time, it meets with fierce opposition from chief pocket-liner, John of Gaunt); the Battle of Cerignola between Spanish and French forces ends with a decisive victory for the Spanish, who use arquebuses against the French cavalry - one of the earliest uses of small-arms gunpowder in a European conflict (1503); Acting Lieutenant Fletcher Christian wrests control of HMS Bounty from his commander, Lieutenant William Bligh (1789 - Bligh and 18 of his supporters are set adrift in the South Pacific, and manage to row 4000 miles to safety); Fetis' edition of Meyerbeer's unfinished opera L'Africaine is premiered at the Paris Opera (1864); Billy the Kid, under sentence of death, kills his jailer as he is taken to \"an outhouse\" and escapes (1881); Dvorak conducts the first performance of his Carnival Overture in Prague (1892); the first long-distance air race in England [from London to Manchester] is won by French aviator Louis Paulhan (1910 - the runner-up is Brit Claude Grahame-Wright, whose plane is beset by engine trouble; as a result, he gains the consolation prize of having made the first long-distance flight at night); Soviet troops invade Azerbaijan, bringing the 23-month-old independent republic back under Russian control (1920); the Empire Stadium opens in London, ready for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924-25 - it has cost £750,000 [around £45million today] (1923 - as it is bulit in Wembley Park, it quickly becomes known as \"Wembley Stadium\". The replacement stadium completed in 2007 cost £798million [just over £1billion today - or about the cost of a DUP bribe]); the Glenn Miller Orchestra records Pennsylvania 6-500 (1940 - the telephone number of the New York hotel in which the band frequently performed); Serbian fascists massacre nearly 200 Croatian Serbs in the Croatian village of Gudovac - the beginning of a genocidal campaign against Serbs that continues throughout the rest of World War 2 (1941); Thor Heyerdahl and five associates begin the Kon-Tiki Expedition (1947 - the raft is at sea for 101 days, sailing 4300miles from Peru to Polynesia); Stravinsky conducts the premiere of his ballet Orpheus [with choreography by George Balanchine] in New York (1948); Luciano Pavarotti makes his La Scala debut, in a revival of Zeffirelli's production of La Boheme, with Karajan conducting (1965); Muhammad Ali attends his induction into the US Army, but refuses twice to step forward when his name is called; he is warned that he is committing a felony punishable by five years in prison and a $10000 fine, but he still refuses to step forward and he is arrested - later that day, the New York State Athletics Commission strip him of his title of Heavyweight Champion of the World, and suspend his Licence to box (1967 - he is not allowed to box for the next three years); 78-year-old Charles de Gaulle steps down as President of France (1969); exactly a week after declaring that he would not resign, but would carry on fighting, South Vietnamese General Cao Van Vien resigns and flees the country as North Vietnamese troops continue their advance on Saigon (1975); members of the Red Army Faction, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and and Jan-Carl Raspe, are found guilty of several murders, other attempted murders, and of forming a terrorist group after a seven month trial (1977 - they are sentenced to life imprisonment); the new, People's Democratic Party government of Afghanistan announces that the former President, Mohammed Daoud Khan has resigned from office \"for health reasons\" - they neglect to mention that these have been caused by their having just shot him (1978 - the coup begins a period of violent Civil War in the country that continues to this day); the Soviet authorities announce the Chernobyl explosions after high levels of radiation are detected 900 miles away in Sweden (1986); Aldrich Ames, who had been a CIA counterintelligence officer with 31 years experience, pleads guilty to spying for and supplying classified information to the KGB (1994 - Ames' personal record was often marked \"mediocre\" and even \"poor\" but he was still given access to highly sensitive information. It was noticed that, with an annual salary of just $60,000, he could still afford to pay $540,000 home and a $50,000 jaguar car in cash, and a monthly credit card bill greater than his annual salary. But he passed polygraph [\"lie detector\"] tests twice in his career - those cunning swine the Soviets had given him top secret advice on how to deceive the equipment: \"Just relax\"); a gunman shoots at over sixty people at various parts of Port Arthur, Tasmania: 35 of them are killed (1996); CBS News releases evidence of American troops torturing and raping prisoners of war in Iraq - the \"evidence\" mostly consisting of photographs taken by the troops themselves (2004 - the torture is consistent with documents prepared by the US Department of Justice the year before, arguing that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to US \"interrogators\" working overseas); and 8 people are killed and many others injured after the Taliban attacks election candidates in Pakistan ahead of the next month's election (2013).\n\nBirthdays Today include: Edward of York [later Edward IV] (1442); Tobias Asser (1838); Karl Kraus (1874); Lionel Barrymore (1878); Kurt Gödel and Paul Sacher (both 1906); Oskar Schindler (1908); Mildred Persinger (1918); Dick Ayers (1924); Francis Burt and Harper Lee (both 1926); Yves Klein and Eugene Merle Shoemaker (both 1928); Christopher Headington (1930); Mike Brearley (1942); Nicola LeFanu (1947); Terry Pratchett (1948); Bruno Kirby (1949); Jay Leno (1950); Gerald Barry (1952); Michael Daugherty (1954); Ian Rankin (1960); Penelope Cruz (1974); Marketa Dvorakova (1977); Bradley Wiggins (1980); Jessica Alba (1981);\n\nFinal Days for: Rhys ap Gruffydd (1197); Thomas Betterton (1710); Ludwig Tieck (1853); Samuel Cunard (1865); Carl Ferdinand Pohl (1887); Alexander Mackenzie (1935); Richard Hughes (1976); Francis Bacon (1992); Rolf Landauer and Alf Ramsey (both 1999); Kim Borg and Penelope Fitzgerald (both 2000); Percy Heath (2005); Milan Popović (2012); and Janos Starker (2013).\n\nAnd the Radio 3 schedules for the morning of Saturday, 28th April, 1979 were:\n\nAubade: Vaughan Williams Toccata marziale; arr Canteloube L'Aio de rotso; Bailero; Malurous qu'o uno fenno (Songs of the Auvergne); Weber Polacca brillante; Elgar Variations on an original theme (Enigma).\n\nRecord Review: introduced by John Lade, who kept his mouth shut whilst Charles Osborne reviewed Mozart's Cosi, and whilst David Murray discussed \"miscellaneous new records\". I liked John Lade - he was good.\n\nNew Releases: Schumann Papillons (played by Peter Frankl); Schubert \"Death & the Maiden\" S4tet (the Chilingirians).\n\nRussian Songs by Tchaikovsky and Georgi Sviridov sung by Irina Arkhipova with Craig Sheppard.\n\nRobin Ray \"presents for your pleasure a weekly selection of popular classics, in performances chosen from over 75 years of gramophone recordings\".\n\nApril 29th\n\nThe traditional date that Noah decided that it was safe to leave the Ark.\n\nAnd the Feast Day of St Cenheidlan - or, to give the latinised version of her name, St Endelianta - better known in English as St Endellion; ironically, as it was the invading English pirates who killed this Celtic-Brittonic saint. Believed to be a daughter of King Brychan of modern-day Breconshire, and supposedly a god-daughter of King Arthur, she settled with her siblings in her godfather's Kingdom of Cornwall, spreading the Christian gospel to the local people. The church and village of St Endellion is named after her, and the annual Music festivals and the String Quartet (with 'cellist nephew of Leeds Piano Competition founder Fanny Waterman) named after the village.\n\nAnd it's International Dance Day - and Day of Remembrance for All Victims of Chemical Weapons.\n\nAlso on this Date: Joan of Arc enters the city of Orlean (1429 - the first decisive victory for the French in the Hundred Years' War since their defeat at Agincourt, fourteen years earlier); James Watt's patent for a steam engine with separate condenser is \"inrolled\" [sic](1769); Captain Cook sets foot in Australia, instantly naming the territory \"Stringray Bay\" - on reflection, he later decides that, in light of the scientific reason for the Endeavour's expedition, \"Botany Bay\" probably sounds a bit more inviting (1770); French Admiral Comte de Grasse successfully breaks a British blockade of the Fort Royal port of Martinique, allowing the four French ships anchored there to leave (1781); a week after it had been completed, Mantuan violinist Regina Strinasacchi gives the first performance of Mozart's Violin Sonata in Bb [K454] with the composer [who plays the piano part from memory, as he hasn't finished writing out yet] (1784);

a landslide of more than 90million tons of limestone rock obliterates the North West Canadian mining town of Frank - around 90 people are killed, and many of them remain buried under the rubble (1903); David Lloyd George, the Liberal Government's Chancellor of the Exchequer, presents the People's Budget - imposing Tax increases on the richest members of society in order to fund social welfare programmes for the poorest (1910 - Lloyd George is supported by the President of the Board of Trade, Winston Churchill); the five-month-long Siege of Kut ends when the British surrender to Ottoman Army (1916 - on the exact same day, the Easter Rising in Dublin comes to an end with the surrender of the Republican forces - they are jeered by the crowds as they are led to prison, but the British Army then manage to grasp defeat from the jaws of victory in their unjust treatment and summary executions of the prisoners); the German Army in Italy surrenders to the Allied forces (1945 - on the same day, American Troops under the command of Lieutenant Felix Sparks liberate Dachau Extermination Camp; Allied Bombers drop food and medical parcels on Holland to relieve the Nazi-imposed Dutch Famine [and saving, amongst thousands of others, 13-year-old Audrey Hepburn's life];

Aretha Franklin's Respect, recorded on St Valentine's Day, is released (1967); South Vietnamese troops, backed by the United States, invade Cambodia (1970); President Nixon announces the release of the edited highlights of his Watergate tapes in an attempt to exonerate himself of all blame in the Scandal (1974); Operation Frequent Wind [and there's probably never been a more appropriate name] begins to evacuate US citizens and South Vietnamese allies from Saigon to escape the advancing North Vietnamese army (1975); an arson attack, on Los Angeles Public Library causes a fire that takes fire officers seven hours to extinguish and destroys 400,000 books, and damages 700,000 others (1986 - nobody is hurt); a cyclone devastates the South-East of Bangladesh, killing at least 138,866 people, and leaving ten million others homeless (1991 - on exactly the same day, an earthquake in Racha in western Georgia left 270 people dead, 100,000 homeless, and destroys many mediaeval buildings); riots break out in Los Angeles following the acquital of the police officers who had violently beaten up Rodney King, a black construction worker (1992 - the riots continue for the next five days, resulting in 63 deaths, 2383 people injured, 12,000 arrests, and damage to property worth over $1billion); the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 outlawing the production, possession, and use of chemical weapons comes into force (1997 - Egypt, Israel, North Korea, and Sudan have never signed up); Prince William and Kate Middleton get married in Westminster Abbey (2011);
