        "text": "France developed out of the Frankish kingdoms that succeeded the Roman Empire, and more directly, out of the declining Carolingian Empire. The latter had been established by the great Charlemagne but began splitting into pieces soon after his death. One of these pieces became the heart of France, and French monarchs would struggle to build a new state out of it. Over time, they succeeded.\n\nThis is a chronological list of the leaders who have ruled France; the dates given are the periods of said rule.\n\nWho Was the First King of France?\n\nOpinions vary as to who the first French king was due to the complex and transitional history of the monarchy.\n\nThe following list includes all of the transitional monarchs, including the Carolingian and Louis I, the latter of whom was technically king of the Carolingian empire and not what we know today as France. Although Louis wasn't the king of the modern entity we call France, all the later French Louises (culminating with Louis XVIII in 1824) were numbered sequentially, using him as the starting point. Also, it's important to remember that Hugh Capet, the first king, didn't invent France; there was a long, complicated history before him.\n\nLater Carolingian Transition\n\nAlthough the royal numbering starts with Louis, he was not a king of France but the heir to an empire that covered much of central Europe. His descendants would later fracture the empire.\n\n814–840 Louis I (not technically a king of France)\n\n840–877 Charles II (the Bald)\n\n877–879 Louis II (the Stammerer)\n\n879–882 Louis III (joint with Carloman below)\n\n879–884 Carloman (joint with Louis III above, until 882)\n\n884–888 Charles the Fat\n\n888–898 Eudes (also Odo) of Paris (non-Carolingian)\n\n898–922 Charles III (the Simple)\n\n922–923 Robert I (non-Carolingian)\n\n923–936 Raoul (also Rudolf, non-Carolingian)\n\n936–954 Louis IV (d'Outremer or The Foreigner)\n\n954–986 Lothar (also Lothaire)\n\n986–987 Louis V (the Do-Nothing)\n\nCapetian Dynasty\n\nHugh Capet is generally considered the first king of France. He and his descendants would go on to face several conflicts to gradually expand and transform a small kingdom into the nation of France.\n\n987–996 Hugh Capet\n\n996–1031 Robert II (the Pious)\n\n1031–1060 Henry I\n\n1060–1108 Philip I\n\n1108–1137 Louis VI (the Fat)\n\n1137–1180 Louis VII (the Young)\n\n1180–1223 Philip II Augustus\n\n1223–1226 Louis VIII (the Lion)\n\n1226–1270 Louis IX (St. Louis)\n\n1270–1285 Philip III (the Bold)\n\n1285–1314 Philip IV (the Fair)\n\n1314–1316 Louis X (the Stubborn)\n\n1316 John I\n\n1316–1322 Philip V (the Tall)\n\n1322–1328 Charles IV (the Fair)\n\nValois Dynasty\n\nThe Valois dynasty would fight the Hundred Years War with England and, at times, looked like they would lose their thrones. They also found themselves facing religious division.\n\n1328–1350 Philip VI\n\n1350–1364 John II (the Good)\n\n1364–1380 Charles V (the Wise)\n\n1380–1422 Charles VI (the Mad, Well-Beloved, or Foolish)\n\n1422–1461 Charles VII (the Well-Served or Victorious)\n\n1461–1483 Louis XI (the Spider)\n\n1483–1498 Charles VIII (Father of his People)\n\n1498–1515 Louis XII\n\n1515–1547 Francis I\n\n1547–1559 Henry II\n\n1559–1560 Francis II\n\n1560–1574 Charles IX\n\n1574–1589 Henry III\n\nBourbon Dynasty\n\nThe Bourbon kings of France included the absolute apogee of a European monarch, the Sun King Louis XIV, and just two people later, the king who would be beheaded by a revolution, Louis XVI.\n\n1589–1610 Henry IV\n\n1610–1643 Louis XIII\n\n1643–1715 Louis XIV (the Sun King)\n\n1715–1774 Louis XV\n\n1774–1792 Louis XVI\n\nFirst Republic\n\nThe French Revolution swept away the monarch, killing their king and queen; the terror that followed the twisting of the revolutionary ideals was in no sense an improvement.\n\n1792–1795 National Convention\n\n1795–1799 Directory (Directors)\n\n1795–1799 Paul François Jean Nicolas de Barras\n\n1795–1799 Jean-François Reubell\n\n1795–1799 Louis Marie La Revellíere-Lépeaux\n\n1795–1797 Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot\n\n1795–1797 Etienne Le Tourneur\n\n1797 François Marquis de Barthélemy\n\n1797–1799 Philippe Antoine Merlin de Douai\n\n1797–1798 François de Neufchâteau\n\n1798–1799 Jean Baptiste Comte de Treilhard\n\n1799 Emmanuel Joseph Comte de Sieyés\n\n1799 Roger Comte de Ducos\n\n1799 Jean François Auguste Moulins\n\n1799 Louis Gohier\n\n1799–1804 Consulate\n\nFirst Consul: 1799–1804 Napoleon Bonaparte\n\nSecond Consul: 1799 Emmanuel Joseph Comte de Sieyés\n\n1799–1804 Jean-Jacques Régis Cambacérès\n\nThird Consul: 1799 Pierre-Roger Ducos\n\n1799–1804 Charles François Lebrun\n\nFirst Empire (Emperors)\n\nThe revolution was brought to an end by the conquering soldier-politician Napoleon, but he failed to create a lasting dynasty.\n\n1804–1814 Napoleon I\n\n1814–1815 Louis XVIII (king)\n\n1815 Napoleon I (2nd time)\n\nBourbons (Restored)\n\nThe restoration of the royal family was a compromise, but France remained in social and political flux, leading to yet another change of house.\n\n1814–1824 Louis XVIII\n\n1824–1830 Charles X\n\nOrleans\n\nLouis Philippe became king, chiefly thanks to the work of his sister; he would fall from grace shortly after she was no longer around to help.\n\n1830–1848 Louis Philippe\n\nSecond Republic (Presidents)\n\nThe Second Republic didn't last long, chiefly because of the imperial pretensions of a certain Louis Napoleon.\n\n1848 Louis Eugéne Cavaignac\n\n1848–1852 Louis Napoleon (later Napoleon III)\n\nSecond Empire (Emperors)\n\nNapoleon III was related to Napoleon I and traded on family fame, but he was undone by Bismarck and the Franco-Prussian War.\n\n1852–1870 (Louis) Napoleon III\n\nThird Republic (Presidents)\n\nThe Third Republic brought stability in terms of the structure of government and managed to adapt to the First World War.\n\n1870–1871 Louis Jules Trochu (provisional)\n\n1871–1873 Adolphe Thiers\n\n1873–1879 Patrice de MacMahon\n\n1879–1887 Jules Grévy\n\n1887–1894 Sadi Carnot\n\n1894–1895 Jean Casimir-Périer\n\n1895–1899 Félix Faure\n\n1899–1906 Emile Loubet\n\n1906–1913 Armand Fallières\n\n1913–1920 Raymond Poincaré\n\n1920 Paul Deschanel\n\n1920–1924 Alexandre Millerand\n\n1924–1931 Gaston Doumergue\n\n1931–1932 Paul Doumer\n\n1932–1940 Albert Lebrun\n\nVichy Government (Chief of State)\n\nWorld War II destroyed the Third Republic, and a conquered France tried to find some sort of independence under World War I hero Petain but was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n1940–1944 Henri Philippe Petain\n\nProvisional Government (Presidents)\n\nFrance had to be rebuilt after the war, and that started with deciding on the new government.\n\n1944–1946 Charles de Gaulle\n\n1946 Félix Gouin\n\n1946 Georges Bidault\n\n1946 Leon Blum\n\nFourth Republic (Presidents)\n\n1947–1954 Vincent Auriol\n\n1954–1959 René Coty\n\nFifth Republic (Presidents)\n\nCharles de Gaulle returned to try and calm social unrest and began the Fifth Republic, which still forms the government structure of contemporary France."
