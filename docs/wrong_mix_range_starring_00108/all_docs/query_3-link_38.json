        "text": "Connie Britton and Oliver Platt have joined the cast of Professor Marston & The Wonder Woman, the upcoming biopic about Wonder Woman creator Dr. William Moulton Marston.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Britton (Friday Night Lights, American Horror Story) and Platt (Fargo, X-Men: First Class) join a stellar cast that also includes The Hobbit's Luke Evans, as well as Iron Man 3's Rebecca Hall and Bella Heathcoate.\n\nAngela Robinson is writing and directing the film, which tells the true story of Harvard psychologist Marston (Evans), his wife Elizabeth (Hall), and the polyamorous relationship the two had with a former student of Marston's named Olive Byrne (Heathcote).\n\nPlatt joins the cast as Sensation Comics editor M.C. Gaines, while Britton will star as a psychologist named Josette Frank, who accused Marston of being an anti-feminist.\n\nNext year, Warner Bros. will debut a new film based on the iconic DC superhero that Marston created. Check out the new trailer and posters for Wonder Woman ahead of its release this coming June."
