But now one of the filmmaker's other big sci-fi properties is making headlines with a return. MGM and Warner Bros. Pictures have announced that Emmerich will get back behind the camera for a big screen reboot of the sci-fi flick Stargate that is being developed as a trilogy. Co-writer Dean Devlin will also be returning as producer, and this comes after word from Emmerich himself surfaced last fall saying, \"We went to MGM, who has the rights, and proposed to them to do a sequel, but as a reboot...and then do three parts.\" So now it's official. But we wish someone else was directing. More below!\n\nPaul Rudd & Danny McBride Joining 'Sausage Party' Arriving in 2016\n\nThe voice cast of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's animated R-rated comedy Sausage Party was already top notch. Rogen was already lending his voice to the film along with Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, Salma Hayek, Edward Norton, Michael Cera, David Krumholtz, Bill Hader, James Franco and Craig Robinson. But now a press release has revealed that Paul Rudd and Danny McBride are also lending their voices to the film along with \"Workaholics\" star Anders Holm. This truly is a star-studded voice cast. However, we'll be waiting awhile to see this flick, because Sony Pictures won't release it until June 3rd, 2016. More below!\n\nLarry Charles to Write, May Direct, 'The Man Who Sued God' Comedy\n\nSince he's no longer at the helm of A Walk in the Woods, director Larry Charles (Borat, The Dictator) is on the hunt for a new project, and it seems he's found one. Deadline has word that New Films International has hired Charles, who was also behind \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and \"Seinfeld,\" to write The Man Who Sued God, based on a 2001 Australian cult favorite of the same name. Charles also has expressed interest in directing the film where he'll put his own spin on the story about an ex-lawyer who files a claim against God himself after his insurance company dismisses the destruction of his boat as an ‚Äúact of God.‚Äù Read on!\n\nLiam Neeson on 'A Walk Among the Tombstones' in Thriller Trailer\n\nWe've seen Liam Neeson get into plenty of action in Taken, the wretched Taken 2, Unknown and Non-Stop earlier this year. Now he's toning it down a bit, but sticking with the thriller genre in A Walk Among the Tombstones. The film is based on Lawrence Block's novel of the same name, featuring Neeson as recurring character Matt Scudder, an ex-NYPD cop who now works as an unlicensed private investigator operating just outside the law. In this particular tale, he's helping a heroin trafficker hunt down the men who kidnapped and murdered his wife. It definitely has a more serious tone than Taken and seems to work.\n\nBobcat Goldthwait's 'Willow Creek' Horror Gets New Trailer & Poster\n\nIt's been nearly a year since we saw a trailer and a wild poster for the horror film Willow Creek from comedian turned filmmaker Bobcat Goldthwait, and the film is finally coming to limited theaters and VOD this summer. The found footage film has been described as The Blair-Squatch Project since it follows a bigfoot believer who heads into California‚Äôs Six Rivers National Forest in order to finally capture footage of the infamous Bigfoot. Now we get another trailer hyping the release next month, and there's also a cool new poster that cleverly uses the footprint of the possibly mythical creature. This looks pretty fun. Watch now!\n\nWant to Eat Out of a Monkey's Head Just Like 'Temple of Doom'?\n\nLast weekend marked the official 30th anniversary of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and we featured a collection of nostalgic looks back at the film that is actually a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark. But much like the Ghostbusters 30th anniversary, we're perfectly fine with tributes to the adventure film popping up throughout the year. In fact, much like cool Ghostbusters stuff hitting this year (including the LEGO version of the Ecto-1), there's a fun little purchase that any true fan of Indiana Jones would probably like to add to their shelf. But it might not be for the faint of heart, and it could get you some weird looks.\n\nFirst Trailer & Poster for Guillermo del Toro's Animated 'Book of Life'\n\nFollowing yesterday's first look photos, the first official trailer and poster for the animated film The Book of Life from producer Guillermo del Toro have arrived. The story follows the journey of Manolo (Diego Luna), an aspiring musician struggling with pleasing his family and winning over the love of his life (Zoe Saldana). There's some truly stunning animation on display here, like a mix of the world of Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas, but in the style of the Day of the Dead celebration. Channing Tatum seems a bit out of place as a rival romancer, but this still looks like an original adventure for everyone. Watch it!\n\nWatch: Daniel Radcliffe & Zoe Kazan Together in 'What If' Trailer\n\n\"It's very easy to be cynical about love, until you've had that instant connection...\" Time to smile. A trailer has debuted for the indie romantic comedy What If, formerly known as The F Word when it premiered at the Toronto Film Festival last year. It was one of my favorite films of that festival and it's a true charmer, an honest look at love and relationships in a modern world. Daniel Radcliffe & Zoe Kazan play two people destined to fall in love, with so much in their way (including a boyfriend). The supporting cast includes Adam Driver, Mackenzie Davis and Rafe Spall. Even though this trailer runs 3-minutes, it's fantastic, and doesn't give away too much of the film at all. This is one indie film worth taking a look at and enjoying!\n\n'Beyond the Brick: A LEGO Brickumentary' Doc Picked Up by Radius\n\nLast fall, we learned about a timely, developing documentary called Beyond the Brick: A LEGO Brickumentary that would take a closer look at the international building block toy sensation by focusing on Adult Fans of LEGO (AFOLs), fan conventioneers, LEGO artists, and famous LEGO fans along with the kids who love the LEGO toy sets so much. THe film debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival earlier this year, and now Radius-TWC has picked up the film for distribution worldwide. In addition, two photos from the documentary have been released, showing off a massive Lord of the Rings homemade LEGO set. Look now!\n\nJeremy Renner Finds CIA Drug Traffic in 'Kill the Messenger' Trailer\n\nAfter bringing down aliens in The Avengers, and becoming a corrupt politician in American Hustle, Jeremy Renner is exposing the shady drug smuggling tactics of the CIA in Kill the Messenger. The film hails from \"Dexter\" and \"Homeland\" director Michael Cuesta and follows the true story of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb, who stumbles onto a story which leads to the shady origins of the men who started the crack epidemic on the nation‚Äôs streets and more worrisome moves in the so-called \"War on Drugs.\" Rosemarie DeWitt, Ray Liotta, Oliver Platt, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Andy Garcia and more also star in the film, and the first trailer shows off a pretty compelling story from our nation's history.\n\nWeinsteins' Spark Buzz with Sexy MPAA Banned 'Sin City 2' Poster\n\nJust a little over a week ago, we got a look at five new character posters for the sequel Sin City: A Dame To Kill For. However, what we didn't see was a poster featuring the titular woman played by Eva Green, and now we know why. Page Six just debuted a new poster featuring the actress, but it was deemed to be too sexy for a sanctioned release by the MPAA ‚Äúfor nudity ‚Äî curve of under breast and dark nipple/areola circle visible through sheer gown.‚Äù Clearly this is just The Weinstein Company trying to stir up some controversy to get some buzz around their late summer release, but you can't deny that's a damn sexy poster. Look now!\n\nAnthony Mackie & Stephan James to Lead Two Jesse Owens Biopics\n\nWith John Boyega taking a major role in Star Wars: Episode VII, that left the lead role in the Jesse Owens biopic Race open for the taking. Now The Wrap reports rising star Stephan James, currently shooting the civil rights drama Selma, has landed the role following the iconic African-American track-and-field star who competed in the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany and won four gold medals after his humble beginnings saw him growing up in 1920s Cleveland, and eventually ending up in Alabama. That's where the film from director Stephen Hopkins (Blown Away) will begin. But it's not the only Jesse Owens project on the way."
