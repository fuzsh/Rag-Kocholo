        "text": "When Sony purchased the rights to create films around the Godzilla character, the company had envisioned creating a franchise. While it was a bumpy start to launch, the company found a creative team in producer Dean Devlin and director Roland Emmerich that carried a concept to release. That led to GODZILLA (1998), which had tremendous licensing from toys and an astounding $150 million in promotional tie ins, such as with Taco Bell.\n\nAs the movie neared release, a sequel began early pre-production. Devlin and Emmerich were attached, as producer and director. However, during this time the 1998 Godzilla film released in the United States to a $44 million opening weekend. Sony put on a brave face, with a spokesperson noting: \"It's the seventh-biggest opening of all time, I don't know how anyone could be disappointed with these numbers.\" In the years that would follow, though, it became more apparent that the $130 million production, which had $50 million in marketing muscle behind it, missed expectations.\n\nDespite not hitting the financial mark, Devlin and Emmerich had a vision on where they wanted the sequel to go. On separate occasions, Devlin has noted both that the sequel would feature multiple Godzillas and that it would include a more heroic Godzilla that would go to Monster Island, name dropping both Mothra and Rodan in the process. It should be noted that due to these being mentioned on different occasions there is a possibility they were juggling separate ideas, rather than a movie that would have featured both multiple Godzillas and Monster Island. Furthermore, the reference to multiple Godzillas was so vague it's open at this point how that could be. For example, were they all offspring of the original? Were some children of the offspring seen at the end of the 1998 film? Outside of the monster angle, Devlin also mentioned that Matthew Broderick playing scientist Nick Tatopoulos would have been the only reoccurring actor from the first film.\n\nHowever, during the next six months following release, Sony began pushing for a sequel at a reduced budget. This idea did not interest Devlin and Emmerich and by December 1998 they publicly noted they would no longer be involved, except possibly as executive producers before leaving altogether in the summer of 1999. This led to a diverged iteration of the proposed sequel as writer Tab Murphy, fresh off his work for Disney's Tarzan, wrote a very different script compared to the hinted sequel concept that Devlin teased in interviews.\n\nTwo sequels were planned for GODZILLA (1998), getting as far as being registered with the US copyright office. Registered on April 13th, 1998, the submitted material indicates that the agreement between Toho and TriStar occurred on June 17th, 1997 for these additional entries. The registration numbers are V3414D227 and V3414D224 respectively.\n\nWord regarding the sequel started early. Director Dean Devlin notes the 1998 movie as Part 1 although cited that at that time nothing had been written for the follow ups. He stated that there is an aspect to Godzilla's \"mythology which we do not explore in the first film that can take us into a new direction for the second and third [movies].\" An early hint at what the sequel would be comes from an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer with Dean Devlin, where he notes the possibility for the story to be about \"Godzillas (as in lots of 'em)\". Mentioned in Japan's Favorite Mon-Star (ISBN: 1550223488).\n\n25 years after GODZILLA (1998) was released, Devlin was interviewed by Yahoo Entertainment about unmade sequels to his films. This is when he brings up Monster Island for GODZILLA 2, saying: \"We really wanted to go to Monster Island... In the original Godzilla movies, Godzilla started off as a monster, but became a hero by the time Monster Island was introduced.\" During the interview he also brings up Mothra and Rodan. In addition, he stresses that Matthew Broderick was the only actor they were eyeing to return. He also talks about the animated Godzilla: The Series (1998) noting: \"The animated series and our sequel lived separately... But they did have the same idea of converting Godzilla into a hero so that when we got to the next movie, Godzilla would be the one who is going to save us, not kill us. It was all part of us going, 'We knew we screwed up [on the first movie], but we can make this right!'\"\n\nThe intended release of the movie is unclear, although had been noted by E! News in 1998 as \"probably\" coming out in 2000.\n\nFor the time line of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's involvement, in December 1998 E! News noted they had already started to distance themselves from the project and would not be involved \"except perhaps as executive producers\". Sci-Fi Japan notes they left the project entirely in May of 1999. By June of 2000, Devlin opened up in a Los Angeles Times article that it was due to the budget, mentioning: \"They wanted to tailor it budget-wise, so it didn't make sense for us creatively.\"\n\nSony's initial reaction to the box office of the 1998 Godzilla was more positive as noted in Entertainment Weekly in June of 1998.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times mentions that the 1998 movie had $150 million in promotional tie-ins.\n\nNote the image used for this concept is not representative of how Mothra and Rodan would have looked like in the movie."
