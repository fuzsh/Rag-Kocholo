        "text": "This movie is extremely, irredeemably terrible. At least last year’s “Oz the Great and Powerful” had Disney production value (all that pretty CGI!) and an actual plot, albeit a profoundly sexist one. (Of course a woman would become a witch because of a man’s romantic rejection!) Putting that aside, it was recognizably a film about Oz, with most of the main characters, the right kind of costume and set design, and a story that cohesively linked with the 1939 film (which was re-released in 3-D recently). But “Dorothy’s Return” has barely anything even remotely reminiscent of our original Oz, despite being written by Baum’s grandson. There is no Wizard of Oz. No Munchkins. No glittery red shoes. No discussion of the power of home. No mention of the Wicked Witch, at least not by name. It’s a film scrubbed of all Oz references that is somehow supposedly about Oz. I still have my doubts.\n\nLet’s get the most obvious gripe out of the way first: “Dorothy’s Return” actually looks horrendous, using a computer-animated style that would be better suited to direct-to-DVD releases—which, actually, maybe this movie should have been. The characters look extremely goofy and not even similar to the 1939 iterations, and it doesn’t help that expressiveness is utterly lacking from these faces. You won’t relate to or care about Dorothy because her face is a complete blank; there’s no emoting depicted at all by her or anyone else. Couple that with the color palette, which looks like it was dreamed up in MS Paint, and blurry textures and landscapes. Oh, it’s all so bad.\n\nThis film focuses on Dorothy (voiced by Lea Michele), who wakes up back in Kansas, safe and sound with Toto, after her trip to Oz (for some reason, the film seems to be set in present-day, but that change is never addressed). But the tornado has ravaged her town and her home, and an evil inspector comes and condemns her family’s house. Oh no! Where will Dorothy go?\n\nBack to Oz, of course, because although it’s only been one day that Dorothy has been gone in her world, in theirs, it’s far longer. Since her departure, Oz has fallen back into darkness, and Dorothy’s three friends Scarecrow (voiced by Dan Aykroyd, of “The Campaign”), Tin Man (Kelsey Grammar, of “I Don’t Know How She Does It”), and Lion (voiced by James Belushi, of “Thunderstruck”), need her to come back and save them. The land is being threatened by Jester (voiced by Martin Short, of “Frankenweenie” and “Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted”), the Wicked Witch’s devious, power-hungry little brother, and since Dorothy slew her, can’t she slay him? That’s the hope of her friends, who use a rainbow to essentially kidnap Dorothy and bring her back to Oz.\n\nBut a malfunction in the rainbow-kidnapping machinery means Dorothy doesn’t make it all the way to Emerald City, and instead has to travel through the countryside to get there. Along the way, she makes new friends: fat owl Wiser (voiced by Oliver Platt, of “Ginger & Rosa”), candy military man Marshal Mallow (voiced by Hugh Dancy, of “Our Idiot Brother”), miniature porcelain China Princess (voiced by Megan Hilty), and an old tree who doesn’t have a name until Dorothy calls him Tugg (voiced by Patrick Stewart, of “Sinbad: The Fifth Voyage” and “The Wolverine”). Together, they travel along the Yellow Brick Road to return Dorothy to Lion, Scarecrow, and Tin Man, who are trying to get to the bottom of Jester’s nefarious plan.\n\nWell, it’s not that notorious. Jester wants to rule, and no one else wants him to, and he only wants to because his sister was mean to him—or something? There is very little explanation for his characters besides that, and for some reason he has a magic orb, and he can control the flying monkeys with it—or something? Trying to understand this story will leave you with a lot of “or something.” I could ask a million other questions and still not get why anyone would be interested in this.\n\nBut aside from the completely throw-away plot, it’s the disservice done to the characters that is the most offensive part of “Dorothy’s Return.” And how they treat Dorothy is worst of all: She comes off here as annoying, brattish, clueless, and pushy, instead of her originally spunky, determined, and curious self. She gets a few songs, and Michele handles them acceptably but not remarkably; I can’t recall one lyric. These are all message-heavy songs, about chipping in to help the community and believing in yourself, but they feel disingenuous and manufactured.\n\nUltimately, there’s no whimsy here, and no reason to either cheer for Dorothy or accept others’ labeling of her as a hero. No reason to see “Legends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return” at all, really.\n\nEnjoy reading this review? Check out our roundup of what other films are opening this week."
