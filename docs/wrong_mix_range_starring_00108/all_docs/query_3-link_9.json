        "text": "I badly want to see Godzilla Minus One, but it is literally impossible. It isn’t in theaters, it isn’t streaming, and there’s no Blu-ray. This is utterly baffling to me, since Godzilla Minus One was released last year and was one of the most acclaimed films of the year, it was a box office hit and became the first Godzilla movie to win an Academy Award. But will I ever be able to see it? I honestly have no idea.\n\nI am Captain Ahab, and Godzilla Minus One is my white whale.\n\nThat sound you hear is me banging my head against the wall.\n\nFortunately, Adam Wingard’s Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is a good consolation prize. Godzilla X Kong is a sequel to Wingard’s 2021 film Godzilla Vs. Kong, and you might be able to guess by the titles that Godzilla X Kong is less about getting Godzilla and Kong to fight each other and more about getting them to team up to fight other monsters, which is just fine with me.\n\nApparently the lack of availability of Godzilla Minus One is due to some licensing deal between Legendary Entertainment (which produces the American Godzilla movies) and Toho Studios (the Japanese company that created and owns Godzilla and produced Godzilla Minus One). While this is something that I still find deeply frustrating, at least it means that there are more Godzilla movies in the world and the franchise may be at an all-time high, which as a devoted fan of monster movies is a good thing in my book.\n\nGodzilla Vs. Kong and Godzilla X Kong are both highly entertaining movies that deliver exactly what the titles promise. If you go to see a movie with “Godzilla” and “Kong” in the title, you are probably expecting one thing: lots of monster action. And by God, that is what these films will give you. All the monster action and crumbling cities that you can handle. I do find it funny that even though Godzilla and Kong are theoretically the good guys, the monsters in these films have probably caused trillions of dollars of damage to major cities across the globe.\n\nOkay, so in Godzilla Vs. Kong we learn that Godzilla, Kong and all the other monsters (called Titans in the movies) originate from Hollow Earth. Basically, Hollow Earth is the idea that the planet is, you guessed it, hollow. According to Wikipedia, this theory was definitively disproven in 1774, which is hilarious to me, as is the idea that some people in this day and age could still believe in it. But to be honest, I like the idea of Hollow Earth because I think it is good fun. It is an utterly ludicrous idea that is demonstrably false, but it makes for fun science fiction and as far as conspiracy theories go, Hollow Earth seems like a pretty harmless one. You never hear anything about the Hollow Earth theorists stirring things up, but don’t even get me started on the Flat Earthers, ugh.\n\nAnyway, despite being complete nonsense the Hollow Earth stuff in these Godzilla movies is quite a bit of fun. There are a lot of Hollow Earth scenes in both Godzilla/Kong movies, and the special effects are dazzling. The Hollow Earth stuff also gives the movies a sort of old-school adventure vibe, like something Jules Verne or Edgar Rice Burroughs might have come up with after a cocaine binge.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nIn Godzilla Vs. Kong, the story was basically an excuse to get Godzilla and Kong to beat the crap out of each other, only for them to realize that they share a greater common enemy (in this case, Mechagodzilla), and team up to defeat him. If you’re wondering what the hell a “Mechagodzilla” is, it’s a giant mechanical Godzilla made by an evil sci-fi corporation. Theoretically made to give humanity a fighting chance against the Titans, it promptly goes rogue and starts causing chaos, and Godzilla and Kong have to set aside their differences to kick Mechagodzilla’s giant metal ass.\n\nMechagodzilla can be seen as a metaphor for mankind’s scientific arrogance, the kind of “they were so preoccupied wondering if they could that they didn’t stop to think about if they should” idea that Jurassic Park explored more than 30 years ago. But if you want, you can ignore that and just see Mechagodzilla as a giant robot Godzilla, and that’s just fine too.\n\nAt the end of Godzilla Vs. Kong Mechagodzilla has been defeated and Godzilla and Kong have gone their separate ways, and Godzilla X Kong picks up some time later. Godzilla is something of a Monster Sheriff, and keeps the other Titans in line. He has also, adorably, taken up sleeping in the Roman Colisseum, curling up in it and snoozing like a cat in a cat bed, which was one of my favorite things in the movie. It’s just so cute.\n\nAnyway, some stuff happens and Kong and a small group of humans end up going on an epic adventure in to Hollow Earth, where we learn more about the history of the monsters and Kong meets more of his people, including a cute little mini-Kong that is apparently named Suko, although I called him Nunchuck because there’s an early scene where Kong picks him up and smacks another giant ape in the face with him, which was absolutely hysterical. Nunchuck (it’s a better name and you cannot convince me otherwise) is a bit of a little shit at first but he soon becomes endearing and I ended up really liking him as Kong’s unofficial sidekick.\n\nThe main villain of the film is another giant ape called the Skar King, a tyrannical despot who has enslaved the rest of Kong’s species. The Skar King wields the spine of some giant creature as an enormous whip, which was a very creative weapon, and is in control of an enormous ice-powered monster called Shimo. With Godzilla’s help (as well as an assist from Mothra, making a surprise return), Kong sets out to defeat the Skar King and free his enslaved people, basically becoming Kong Spartacus, or SpartaKong if you will (sorry not sorry).\n\nThe American Godzilla movies have taken some flack for not having very compelling human characters, which on the one hand is a fair criticism because the human characters aren’t that interesting (although I have heard that this is something Godzilla Minus One does very well). But at the same time, as I mentioned previously, most people probably do not go to a Godzilla movie for human drama. I feel a bit bad for the actors in these movies because, even though it must be great fun to be in one of these movies, you would have to be aware that viewers aren’t going to be seeing the movie because you’re in it, they’re going to see it because of Godzilla and the other monsters.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nThere are a lot of actors in these movies that I like, such as Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, Millie Bobby Brown, Alexander Skarsgard, and others, and they’re all fine, but they’re mostly there to move the plot forward and be in danger during monster fights. I do have to specifically mention Dan Stevens, a hugely likable actor who in Godzilla X Kong plays a guy called Trapper who I guess is kind of a veterinarian for giant monsters (he replaces one of Kong’s teeth early in the movie) and is a cocky-but-likable hotshot in the vein of Han Solo or Star-Lord. Stevens is clearly having a great time and his enthusiasm is infectious. His taste in music also gives the movie a couple of fun musical scenes that reminded me of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, which is never a bad thing (and it reminds me that I need to write about Guardians 3).\n\nGodzilla X Kong also reunites Stevens with director Adam Wingard, who directed him in the 2014 thriller The Guest which I covered some years ago (it’s a good movie, you should see it). Wingard also directed the 2011 slasher film You’re Next, which I like a lot but haven’t written about because I think reading about it would traumatize my mom and I already traumatized her enough writing about people exploding in Ready or Not (sorry mom!).\n\nI am a fan of Wingard’s work and his Godzilla movies are a lot of fun. Wingard has a knack for finding creative ways to film the action scenes, like a couple of first-person shots from Kong’s perspective while he battles Godzilla in Godzilla Vs. Kong. The monster battles in both movies are an absolute blast, although it did make me a bit sad to watch the pyramids get obliterated in Godzilla X Kong, RIP to another historical landmark. I was glad that the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro was spared, despite the destruction of much of the surrounding city. And the Roman Colisseum also (mostly) survives to be used as Godzilla’s cat bed.\n\nGodzilla X Kong puts less emphasis on human drama than some of the previous American Godzilla movies, and there are lengthy stretches in which there are no humans at all, which is just fine with me (again, no disrespect to the human actors, they are all fine). The special effects are terrific and the expressions and body language of the monsters are so well done that it’s not hard to understand what is going on, despite the lack of dialogue except for monster grunts and roars (there is a LOT of grunting and roaring in this film).\n\nI really enjoyed the Godzilla/Kong movies. They’re not particularly profound or enlightening, but they are a whole lot of fun and if you enjoy the sight of giant monsters smashing each other and their surroundings into tiny bits (as I do), you will get more than your money’s worth.\n\nHopefully I will be able to see and write about Godzilla Minus One someday.\n\nThe Ghost and the Darkness is a criminally underrated historical thriller from 1996 starring Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas that is based on the fascinating true story of the Man-Eaters of Tsavo. It received a very mixed reception when it was released, the film’s director Stephen Hopkins expressed mixed feelings about it and Roger Ebert hated it so much that he said it was one of the worst films of 1996. With all due respect to the late Mr. Ebert, I don’t know what the hell he was talking about. He must have seen a different movie from the one I saw, because the one I saw was damn good.\n\nBut first, some background. In 1898, the British were attempting to build a railway bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya. Over a period of nine months, from March to December of 1898, the building site was attacked by a pair of male lions who killed many of the workers. The lions were eventually killed by Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson, the man in charge of overseeing the project. The lions were ferocious and cunning adversaries and the second one only died after Patterson shot it nine times. Patterson later wrote a book about his experiences which was published in 1907 (he also had the skins of the lions made into rugs, and later the skins were sent to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, where they are still on display today).\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nThe historical accuracy of the book is debated, since Patterson may have exaggerated parts of the story. It’s hard to say for sure exactly how many people were killed by the lions. Reports from the time put the number at a staggering 135, but more modern studies suggest that the number was closer to around 30. Still, 30 people eaten by lions is a heck of a lot! Even then, that number might not be entirely accurate either since it only accounts for the number of people eaten by the lions, not necessarily the number of people killed but not eaten by the lions. We may never know the exact death toll.\n\nPatterson’s book has been adapted to film several times, with The Ghost and the Darkness being the most recent cinematic telling of the story. The screenplay was written by William Goldman, who was an accomplished writer known for novels and screenplays, including Marathon Man and The Princess Bride. It was directed by Stephen Hopkins, who I know best as the director of Predator 2, which is a goofy but fun movie. Val Kilmer plays Patterson, and even though Patterson is unquestionably the film’s protagonist, he gets second billing to Michael Douglas, who plays an American big game hunter named Charles Remington.\n\nRemington is a fictional character, though he was based to some extent on an actual person. Michael Douglas also produced the film and wasn’t originally going to act in it, but when they were having trouble casting Remington (Anthony Hopkins and Sean Connery turned it down), Douglas decided to play the character himself, which both Hopkins and Goldman have since expressed unhappiness with. When Douglas decided to play the character, the role was greatly expanded from what it was originally and the relationship between Douglas and Hopkins was tense. Hopkins has said that making the film was a nightmare and that he was never happy with the final product, although he was very complimentary of Val Kilmer.\n\nThis film had all the makings of a cinematic disaster: creative conflicts, difficult filming conditions, stars with massive egos, etc. In addition to animatronics designed by the great Stan Winston, the production also used real lions, so…yeah. I can imagine that would have been stressful, even if the lions they used for filming were for obvious reasons not as aggressive as the real-life man-eaters. But despite all these obstacles, The Ghost and the Darkness is an excellent film, so after all that preamble let’s talk about the film itself.\n\nThe film begins in London with Patterson being hired by an arrogant financier named Robert Beaumont to get the railway project in Kenya back on schedule. Beaumont gives Patterson five months, which Patterson finds agreeable since his wife is due to give birth to their first child in six months and he has promised her that he will be there for the child’s birth. It is a promise he will not be able to keep. Beaumont is played by the late Tom Wilkinson, who sadly passed away in December 2023. He was a very gifted actor, and he makes an impression in this film, despite only being in two scenes.\n\nUpon arriving at the work site, Patterson meets Samuel, the foreman. Samuel is played superbly by John Kani, who played T’Challa’s father King T’Chaka in the Black Panther movies. Samuel is one of the most likable characters in the film, and he informs Patterson of a recent lion attack. That night Patterson kills an approaching lion and the next day the workers celebrate the danger having passed. Little do they know of the terror that lurks in the tall grass…\n\nSome weeks later, a worker is dragged from his tent in the middle of the night and his remains are found the next day. Patterson and Samuel make the grim discovery that there are two man-eaters on the loose, which Samuel says has never happened before. The workers start to turn on Patterson, since the lion attacks started after he arrived at the camp. The workers also start calling the lions the Ghost and the Darkness, which are extremely badass nicknames, and the beasts take on an almost supernatural aura.\n\nPatterson requests reinforcements but Beaumont denies his request. After all, Beaumont says, what will people think of the great British Empire if we can’t handle two measly lions? Tom Wilkinson is so great at making you hate Beaumont, he is a selfish prick who openly states he doesn’t care at all about the dead workers, he only cares about his bottom line. Sadly, you don’t get to see him get eaten. Ah, well.\n\nA big game hunter named Charles Remington soon arrives at the camp. Remington’s brash personality initially clashes with Patterson’s more laidback demeanor, but the two develop a respect for each other and Kilmer, Kani, and Douglas are great together. After a series of tense and bloody confrontations in which many more workers are killed, the remainder decide to get the hell out of there while the getting’s good. You can’t blame them.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nEventually Patterson, Remington, and Samuel are finally able to slay one of the beasts, but after a night of drinking and celebrating Patterson awakes from a nightmare to discover that the remaining lion has killed Remington. The scene in which Patterson and Samuel discover Remington’s corpse is extremely well-acted by Val Kilmer and John Kani. The two men don’t say a word. They silently burn him in a funeral pyre and light the tall grass on fire in order to drive the lion towards a trap they have set up on the partially completed bridge. The final confrontation occurs at night against the backdrop of the burning grass. Patterson and Samuel are at long last able to defeat the beast, and the film ends with the bridge being completed and Patterson reuniting with his wife and meeting his child.\n\nVal Kilmer is great in this movie. He gives Patterson a slight Irish lilt which is enough to remind the viewer of Patterson’s Irish heritage but is never distracting. Kilmer had a reputation as being difficult to work with and when he made The Ghost and the Darkness he was coming off the release of The Island of Dr. Moreau, the production of which was an infamous disaster. But despite the negative press from that film, Stephen Hopkins said that Kilmer threw himself into the role of Patterson and had a passion for the film. I think it shows.\n\nAnd while I’m not usually the biggest fan of Michael Douglas, I think he’s quite good in this film. Behind-the-scenes tomfoolery aside, Douglas is believable as a grizzled hunter and his banter with Patterson and Samuel provides much of the film’s emotional backbone. His death is genuinely sad, and Patterson and Samuel’s reactions to the discovery of his death is one of the film’s most emotionally moving moments.\n\nI think this movie is terrific. The cinematography is great, the music by Jerry Goldsmith is rousing and chilling, the acting is great, the characters are likable, it’s scary and suspenseful, and it tells a fascinating true story. I don’t know what more you could ask for, honestly. This film’s negative reception upon its initial release makes no sense to me, and Ebert’s hatred of it in particular is utterly baffling. It’s a minor miracle that The Ghost and the Darkness even got made in the first place, since it had all the makings of an epic cinematic disaster: a troubled production, creative differences, a mixed reception, and disappointing box office. The fact that it turned out as good as it did despite all that is icing on the cake, and it makes me happy that the film has since found an audience and has a cult following.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nSo there you have it, the last (for now!) of my series about killer animal movies. I hope you’ll agree that I saved the best film for last. I will probably revisit this topic in the future, since there is no shortage of killer animal movies to choose from and I have had a lot of fun watching and writing about these films. Next post is going to be about something different, but until then, as is tradition, here are my rankings of all the movies I’ve discussed over the last few posts.\n\nFINAL RANKINGS:\n\nThe Ghost and the Darkness\n\nCrawl\n\nAlligator\n\nBackcountry\n\nBeast\n\nAnaconda\n\nDeep Blue Sea 3\n\nMeg 2: The Trench\n\nAlligator II: The Mutation\n\nStaring at a blank wall for 82 minutes\n\nLake Placid (I hate this movie)\n\nBackcountry (2014)\n\nLet’s switch gears for a while and go from a big-budget blockbuster with a tropical setting to a low-budget indie flick in a forest environment. Backcountry is a straightforward story: a young couple named Alex and Jenn go on a weekend camping trip. Alex is secretly planning to propose and wants to take Jenn to a lake in the woods he loved as a kid. But, of course, Alex makes a bunch of macho bullshit mistakes and they end up badly lost in the woods. It seems like a bear may be stalking them and soon the bear attacks and mauls Alex to death. Jenn struggles through the woods back to civilization and survives.\n\nAnd that’s it, really. There are no generic corporate bad guys, which is refreshing. It’s a straightforward survival story with only two main characters. Alex and Jenn do meet another guy in the woods, an Irish tour guide named Brad who has dinner with them. Brad and Alex don’t like each other and Brad flirts with Jenn, which pisses Alex off. There are some weird vibes from Brad and in a different kind of movie Brad would have stalked them through the woods and tried to violently murder them, and he would probably be from a family of inbred cannibals living in the woods like something out of The Hills Have Eyes or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\n\nBut Backcountry is not that kind of movie. On the contrary, Brad helps Jenn at the end of the movie when she manages to find her way back to civilization, which is a nice subversion of expectations. Jenn is a very likable protagonist, and her trek through the wilderness is harrowing and visceral. Alex is a bit of a frustrating character since the predicament he and his girlfriend find themselves in is entirely of his own making. He doesn’t take a map with them into the woods, claiming that he knows the area so well that he doesn’t need one, only to discover that the lake he wanted to take Jenn to isn’t where he thought it was and they are lost. On top of that, he took Jenn’s cell phone out of her backpack and left it back in their car, so they can’t call for help. Along the way, he tries to act like he’s a great outdoorsman by showing off to Jenn like he thinks he’s Bear Grylls or Les Stroud, which he very much isn’t.\n\nIFC Midnight\n\nStill, it’s not like Alex is cartoonishly evil or anything. He’s a normal guy who makes some boneheaded decisions, but, I mean, don’t we all? And the poor guy pays for his sins big time during the terrifying bear attack scene. The bear attack is filmed entirely from Alex and Jenn’s perspective inside the tent, which puts the viewer right into the scene. It’s every camper’s worst nightmare. I’m not an outdoorsy person myself, and Backcountry perfectly encapsulates the reasons why. The bear attack scene is probably the single most frightening sequence in any of the monster movies I’ve written about lately since it feels like something that could actually happen. For all his flaws, Alex didn’t deserve such a grisly demise (the bone-crunching sound effects are hard to get out of your head, as is the sight of Alex’s eviscerated remains).\n\nBackcountry is also based to some extent on a true story of a couple named Mark Jordan and Jacqueline Perry, who were attacked by a bear while kayaking in Canada. The bear mauled Perry and Jordan managed to stab it with a Swiss Army knife to get the bear off her. He then took Perry back to their kayak and attempted to take her to the nearest campsite, but sadly she succumbed to her wounds in the boat. Jordan was later given a medal for bravery by the Canadian government. It’s a tragic story and Backcountry doesn’t sensationalize it (although it does fictionalize it). Bear attacks on humans are fortunately rare, a quick Google search reveals that the odds of being attacked by a bear are one in 2.1 million, but they do happen.\n\nIt is a bit disingenuous to call Backcountry a monster movie, it is primarily a survival thriller. It’s not an action movie with big explosions, it’s a slow-burn suspense movie. It’s very well-directed and well-acted, and maintains a tense atmosphere throughout. There’s only one death in the movie and it is a deeply harrowing one, not the kind of cool or fun one where a mercenary gets his head bitten off, and there is no satisfying cathartic moment where the monster is killed in a gory explosion. The film is a chilling reminder that nature is not to be messed with, and while it may not be as entertaining as Deep Blue Sea 3 or Meg 2, it is undeniably a better movie overall and is tied with Crawl as the most purely frightening killer animal movie I’ve written about so far.\n\nBeast (2022)\n\nThe 2022 Idris Elba thriller Beast finally gave me something I have been wanting for years. The trailers for the 2011 Liam Neeson movie The Grey strongly implied that there would be a scene in which Liam Neeson fights a wolf in hand-to-claw combat. But if you have seen The Grey (or maybe you read my post about it that I wrote many years ago), you will know that there is no such scene in that film. The screen cuts to black just as the battle is about to begin. I still think of this as being one of the cruelest rug-pulls I have ever experienced in a movie, and although The Grey is still a very good film (albeit one that is very hard to watch), I never quite forgave it for that.\n\nWhich is why it thrills me to no end to report that in the movie Beast Idris Elba fights a lion, and it is glorious. I finally got the action-hero-vs.-killer-animal fight that I have wanted for years. Elba plays Dr. Nate Samuels, a recently widowed man on a safari vacation in South Africa with his daughters Meredith and Norah. Nate is attempting to reconnect with his daughters, with whom he became somewhat distant while his wife was dying of cancer. Nate confesses to his old buddy Martin (played by Sharlto Copley, an actor I am always happy to see) that he feels guilty over not having been there for his family when they needed him most.\n\nNate, Martin, and the girls soon run afoul of a vicious man-eating lion and it doesn’t take long for a ruthless gang of poachers to get involved too. I liked the inclusion of the poachers; they’re solid secondary antagonists and it makes sense to include them since poaching is a real-life problem. It also helps that you don’t feel bad for them when they get eaten. There are a lot more animal attacks in Beast than there were in Backcountry, and while the latter film’s bear attack is the most frightening and impactful, the lion attacks in Beast are still suspenseful and bloody.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nBeast was directed by an excellently named Icelandic director named Baltasar Kormakur, who films much of the movie in continuous long takes in which the camera is constantly on the move. I like this very immersive filmmaking style and it increases the tension a lot when the lion is on the rampage. Idris Elba is a very good actor and Nate is easy to root for, and when Martin is gravely wounded by the titular beast Nate has to take charge, even though he is not an animal expert like Martin. But Idris Elba is a big guy and Nate proves to be more than capable of taking care of himself and his daughters.\n\nAnd then there is that final man vs. lion battle, which is great. I have no idea if such a scenario is even remotely plausible, but something tells me that even a guy as beefy as Idris Elba would be promptly eviscerated in such a confrontation. So it might not be very realistic but to be fair to the movie Nate is not the one to strike the final blow against the murderous feline. The lion is on the verge of killing Nate when a different pride of lions (that Martin helped raise) intervenes and kill the man-eater.\n\nBeast isn’t a perfect film or even a very original one, but it’s well-made, it looks great, has likable protagonists, is tense, bloody and has a satisfying, if a bit far-fetched, conclusion. Backcountry and Beast make for a solid killer-animal double feature and offer a nice dose of more grounded thrills after the over-the-top silliness of movies like Deep Blue Sea 3 and Meg 2. I’ve got one more killer-animal movie I’m going to write about soon, and it’s my favorite of all the movies I’ve covered recently. It’s so good that it deserves its own individual write-up, so that is going to be my next post. See you soon.\n\nAnother Monster Mash, another batch of animals that want to eat you! My reviews of these movies ended up being a bit longer that I anticipated so I’m going to break them up into multiple posts. Let’s get started with the third entry in a series I have covered before.\n\nDeep Blue Sea 3 (2020)\n\nDeep Blue Sea 3 is the second sequel to the original Deep Blue Sea, which was released all the way back in 1999. The original is a movie that I am still quite fond of and is one of my favorite monster movies I have ever written about. Sadly, the first sequel, Deep Blue Sea 2, which was released straight-to-video in 2018, was mostly boring and failed to recapture the fun of the original film. I can cut the sequel a bit of slack because it didn’t have anywhere near as high of a budget as the original, but there’s still no excuse for how painfully dull the second movie was.\n\nFortunately, the third movie is a significant improvement over the second and is quite a bit of good cheesy fun. The main character is Dr. Emma Collins, who along with her team is living on an artificial island called Little Happy, where they are studying the effects of climate change on shark mating, or something. It doesn’t really matter, but the movie’s location is one of its strongest points. The man-made island in the middle of nowhere is a great location for a shark movie, cleverly bypassing the issues of why the protagonists can’t just leave or call for help.\n\nIt’s also a cool location, period. I haven’t seen a location like this in a movie before, and considering what was probably a pretty low budget it looks very good. It also starts to sink later in the movie after a bunch of explosions, which reminded me of the scene near the end of Casino Royale where James Bond fights a bunch of bad guys in a collapsing building in Venice. It’s like that, but on an entire man-made island and with sharks. Very cool stuff.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nI won’t lie, the first half or so of this movie is a bit slow. Emma and her cohorts are likable folks but I didn’t particularly care about whatever research they were doing and so for a while you’re just waiting for the sharks to show up. Eventually they do, accompanied by a guy named Richard (who is of course Emma’s ex-boyfriend) and a bunch of shady Australians that turn out to be ruthless mercenaries, let by a bloke named Lucas who is the main (human) villain. Richard and Lucas are tracking the sharks from the second movie (I think), and they even directly reference the events of the previous two movies, which provides a nice bit of connective tissue for the series.\n\nAfter some conflict between the two groups, Lucas just decides to kill everybody and starts blasting the island apart with some kind of explosive launcher, I don’t know what kind of gun he uses but it’s blue and green and I kept thinking it looked like a Nerf gun. The island starts to sink and the sharks close in. These are also super-intelligent sharks that are very crafty. There are some great kills in this movie, many of which are quite unexpected. The best one happens when Richard decides Lucas has gone too far and jumps off their boat AND DIRECTLY INTO THE GAPING MAW OF A SHARK!! It’s fantastic. There’s another one where one of the protagonists is fighting a bad guy and a shark comes out of nowhere and bites the bad guy’s head clean off! And then Emma kills one of the sharks by smushing it in a trash compactor! Excellent.\n\nLook, Deep Blue Sea 3 is obviously no masterpiece, but it is much more enjoyable than the lackadaisical second film. The movie’s first half is a little slow, but the second half is quite action-packed. There are likable characters, a cool and unique location, and bloody and often unexpected kills. You could do a lot worse for a direct-to-video shark movie that is a sequel to a movie that came out more than 20 years ago.\n\nMeg 2: The Trench (2023)\n\nHere’s another sequel to a movie I wrote about in a previous Monster Mash. Meg 2 is one of those movies that got absolutely dragged over the coals by critics but that I found to be quite enjoyable, although it does take a while to get to the good stuff. Meg 2 was directed by Ben Wheatley, a filmmaker with a strong horror pedigree who cut his teeth with the grisly 2011 indie thriller Kill List and who also directed the 2020 version of Rebecca on Netflix. It wouldn’t surprise me if Meg 2 had a bigger budget than all of Wheatley’s previous films combined, and despite the many flaws of Meg 2 Wheatley is a talented filmmaker, and I will always be in favor of movies in which Jason Statham does battle with enormous prehistoric sharks.\n\nI’m not going to go into a lot of detail about the plot of Meg 2, because let’s face it, nobody cares that much. While I enjoyed the original movie The Meg back in 2018, I don’t think the world was clamoring for a sequel. But money talks so we got a sequel anyway. Meg 2 is utterly ludicrous, but perhaps the most surprising thing about it is how sedate the first half feels.\n\nFor the first hour of this movie there’s relatively little shark action and way too much focus on the extremely boring corporate bad guys. Why are there always boring corporate bad guys in killer animal movies? The dull villains in this movie don’t even have a fun evil plan, like building a space laser. All they want to do is mine valuable rare minerals from the bottom of the ocean and sell them to make money. Boring! Be more creative, bad guys! You’re already rich, you don’t need more money! Take a hint from James Bond villains and use your ill-gotten gains to build a freakin’ space laser, sheesh! (What I am realizing here is that I want more movies to feature space lasers.)\n\nAnyway, the somewhat dull first hour is offset when the movie does a nosedive into full-tilt insanity in the last 30 or so minutes. To adapt a phrase from Matt Damon in Saving Private Ryan, Meg 2 takes a nosedive out of the crazy tree and hits every branch on the way down for its totally bonkers climax. All the heroes and villains (and creatures) end up at a gorgeous tropical vacation island called Fun Island where all hell breaks loose.\n\nWarner Bros. I like the tagline too.\n\nHere are some of the highlights: Jason Statham zips around on a jet ski skewering megalodons with improvised explosive-tipped harpoons, all while bad guys chase after him shooting at him with machine guns! Heroes and villains alike are attacked by toothy creatures called snappers that are kind of like Gila monsters crossed with velociraptors! Lots of tourists are devoured by giant sharks! Statham kills one of the big sharks by impaling it with one of the rotor blades from a crashed helicopter! He also kills the main human bad guy by kicking him into the maw of one of the sharks and dropping the one-liner “So long, chum!” (GET IT??)\n\nOne of the returning characters from the first movie who was mainly comic relief has now become a badass who wields a massive handgun equipped with poison-tipped bullets, and he then fires the gun one-handed whilst flying through the air like something out of a John Woo or Michael Bay movie! And best of all, there is a GIANT OCTOPUS, in other words, a KRAKEN!!! And then there is an all-out KRAKEN/MEGALODON FIGHT!!!\n\nWhew. So yeah, this movie’s last 30 minutes are completely insane in the best possible way. It’s a shame that the rest of the movie doesn’t have the same momentum of the last 30 minutes, if that level of craziness could have been sustained for the entire movie we might have had something truly special on our hands. Despite a thorough critical drubbing, Meg 2 still made nearly $400 million worldwide so it wouldn’t surprise me if Meg 3 rises from the deep in another few years. If so, here’s hoping that the focus will be less on boring illegal mining operations and more on full-bore aquatic monster mayhem since that is clearly where the strength of this franchise rests.\n\nThere are a LOT of Killer Animal movies. Every single animal you can think of has been put into a horror movie and made to kill people. Not just obvious ones like sharks, lions, bears, alligators, and snakes, but also slugs, whales, frogs, beavers, and on and on. Basically, if it walks on four legs (or slithers) it has eaten someone in a movie. And while I am not going to exhaustively cover every single Killer Animal movie ever made (there are far too many, and shark movies in particular are their own entire subgenre) I will be talking about some that I enjoy.\n\nLet’s start with one of my favorite animals, the noble alligator. Alligators are fascinating creatures, there is something prehistoric and primordial about them and they look like they could swallow you whole with one bite. The makers of the following films clearly agreed.\n\nAlligator (1980) and Alligator II: The Mutation (1991)\n\nYou know that urban legend about alligators in the sewers? Well, 1980’s Alligator asks the age-old question, “what would happen if a teenage girl’s pet baby alligator got flushed down the toilet and ended up in the sewer, where it spent the next 12 years feeding on dead animals that were used in experiments by an unscrupulous corporation that was trying to develop a growth formula for livestock, and the sewer gator mutated into a giant gator beast that was 36 feet long and perpetually hungry?”\n\nWe have all asked ourselves this question at some point.\n\nFortunately, Alligator presents an entertaining answer to this timeless query. The main character is a world-weary police detective named David Madison, played by Robert Forster. Some severed body parts start showing up in the sewers and during the course of his investigation Madison begins to suspect that there is something lurking below the streets of Chicago (or is it somewhere in Missouri? It’s unclear where the movie is supposed to take place, although it was filmed in Los Angeles).\n\nGroup 1 Films\n\nMadison meets a herpetologist named Marisa Kendall and the two of them form a romantic relationship while hunting the gator. Nothing like hunting a giant mutant reptile to bring couples together! Also, a herpetologist is someone who studies reptiles and amphibians, and not someone who studies herpes. Please tell me I’m not the only person who thought of this.\n\nAnyway, after Madison spearheads a police operation to flush the alligator out of the sewers and the attempt fails, his boss caves to pressure from the mayor (who is in the pocket of the evil corporation that experimented on animals and caused the alligator to mutate in the first place) and suspends Madison. This frees up his schedule so he and Marisa can concentrate on alligator-hunting full-time.\n\nThe alligator itself is a fearsome beast and looks very cool, and Madison eventually kills it by blowing it up with a bomb. I am always happy when a monster movie ends with the monster being blasted into tiny bits. But before its explosive demise, the gator wreaks substantial havoc. The gator’s killing sprees are the most fun parts of the movie, as well they should be since monsters eating people are the reason people watch monster movies in the first place. The best scene comes near the end, when the gator attacks an outdoor wedding and all of the sleazy scientists and corporate types and the corrupt mayor are either smashed flat or disappear down the beast’s prodigious gullet.\n\nThe movie has a good sense of humor and has the good sense both to not take itself too seriously and to not be too long. The movie is a flat 90 minutes, which is exactly as long as it should be. There are some funny moments, like a guy selling kitschy alligator souvenirs when the police are hunting the beast and the movie has fun introducing a hardass big-game hunter named Colonel Brock who is supposed to be a super-cool animal-hunting expert and is promptly eaten.\n\nShout! Factory\n\nAlligator is one of many Killer Animal movies released in an attempt to capitalize on the success of Jaws in 1975. It is not a great movie by any means but it is one of the better Jaws imitators. Robert Forster’s protagonist is scrappy and likable and the monster looks cool, and there are some good kills. Time also seems to have been good to it, it has an 85% on Rotten Tomatoes. It’s a very cheesy movie and the pacing lags a bit at times but it’s still good fun and the recent 4K Blu-Ray from Shout! Factory is well worth your time.\n\nNot so much for the “sequel”, Alligator II: The Mutation, released 11 years later in 1991. I put “sequel” in quotes because Alligator 2 is basically the same movie. It retreads the same territory without adding anything to it and ends up feeling like a tired imitation, which is too bad because this poster is awesome.\n\nGolden Hawk Entertainment\n\nSadly, the movie does not live up to this glorious poster, which I would happily hang on my wall.\n\nTell me if this sounds familiar: an unscrupulous business tycoon dumps a bunch of chemicals into the sewers which mutates a baby alligator to enormous size and when drifters start to go missing and severed body parts start turning up a world-weary detective named David starts investigating and okay Alligator 2 is the same movie as the first one. The main character even has the same first name and there is at least one shot that is straight-up lifted from the first movie.\n\nIt’s lazy filmmaking, to say the least. Alligator 2 also makes the mistake of spending too much time focusing on corporate skullduggery. In the first movie the sleazy corporate villains were side characters and we spent most of the movie with the likable protagonist. For some reason Alligator 2 gives way too much screentime to the boring evil business tycoon, who, in addition to dumping chemicals in the sewer, is also a greedy real estate developer? The connection between these two branches on the Tree of Evil is never made clear.\n\nBut it also doesn’t matter, because of course Mr. Sleazy Tycoon gets eaten. There are other subplots involving the mayor’s guilt for being in the pocket of Mr. Sleazy Tycoon and the mayor’s daughter and the chief of police is also the mayor’s daughter’s godfather and who cares? There is too much focus on miscellaneous chicanery and not enough monster action. It’s also mostly bloodless, as opposed to the first movie which wasn’t excessively gory but at least it had some blood when people got EATEN BY A GIANT GATOR.\n\nFortunately, Alligator 2 picks up a bit when it introduces the most entertaining characters. These are a group of cousin-marryin’, moonshine-swillin’, gator-wrasslin’, redneck good ol’ boys, led by a fella named Hawkins. These fellers are by far the best part of the movie. But then of course most of them are promptly eaten. At least Hawkins gets to go out like a badass, locked in mortal combat with the beast. And the movie somewhat redeems itself by having the protagonists kill the gator by blowing it up with rocket launchers, and I will never be able to fully dislike a movie in which a giant alligator is blown up with rocket launchers (more movies should have this).\n\nThe ways in which Alligator 2 borrows from the first movie are too numerous to mention, so I’m not going to bother to catalogue them all. But it doesn’t manage to do anything better than the first movie did more than a decade prior. I wasn’t aware that the original movie even had a sequel until a week or so ago and I thought it sounded like good cheesy fun, but sadly Alligator 2 is mostly cheese without much fun. Not even the presence of genre stalwarts like Dee Wallace and Kane Hodder can save it.\n\nI did like the redneck gator-hunters though.\n\nLake Placid (1999)\n\nI do not like Lake Placid.\n\nIt was directed by Steve Miner, whose horror directing credits include Friday the 13th Part 2, Friday the 13th Part III, and Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, so you’d think he would be able to handle a movie about a killer alligator, but you would be wrong because Lake Placid is bad.\n\n20th Century Fox. “You’ll Never Know What Bit You” is a solid tagline though.\n\nBut what makes it so bad? Mostly the characters. There are four main characters in this movie and I HATE ALL OF THEM. Bridget Fonda plays a paleontologist who never stops whining and is a condescending jerk. Brendan Gleeson plays the grumpy sheriff who seems to actively hate himself, his job, and everyone around him. Oliver Platt plays a horny, rich asshole who makes crude sexual comments about every woman he lays eyes on. And Bill Pullman is the least offensive character, a fish and game officer who mostly just seems bored. The movie even has the gall to try to foist a romantic subplot on Fonda and Pullman’s characters, and it rings utterly, utterly hollow.\n\nEverybody in the movie seems to hate each other and none of the actors have any chemistry. I hate Oliver Platt’s character the most, he is an aggressively unpleasant douchebag and every time he opens his mouth I want to put my fist in his face. I can’t think of another movie off the top of my head in which every single character is so unlikable and impossible to care about.\n\nWorse yet, none of these jerks get eaten!! I was sure that at least one of them would but none of them did. Even Platt! His character had “Gator Bait” written all over him and then he doesn’t get eaten! Both Alligator movies had the good sense to turn the sleazy corporate types into gator chow, but Lake Placid can’t even get that right. I think at times it tries to be a horror comedy, but it fails miserably on both counts because it isn’t scary and its attempts at humor aren’t funny.\n\nThis movie has no stakes, no tension, no drama, and no reason to care. The monster in Alligator killed a good 15-20 people and terrorized an entire city. The casualties in Lake Placid amount to two people, one bear, one cow, and one moose. And I felt the most sympathy for the bear, the cow, and the moose.\n\nAll of this is compounded by the fact that Stan Winston worked on this movie. Winston was a legend whose credits include Terminator, Jurassic Park, Predator, Iron Man, Aliens, and many more. Even though the monster in this movie looks good, there is very little monster action and the characters are so unlikable that the whole movie sinks like a stone. Even Betty White as a foul-mouthed old lady who secretly feeds cows to the creature provides only momentary amusement. Although at one point she says she’s rooting for the gator and she hopes it eats everyone else, and I strongly agreed with her.\n\nWorse yet, this piece of crap movie somehow spawned an entire series. There are SIX of these damn things! SIX!!\n\nI hate Lake Placid. It’s not scary, it’s not funny, it has awful characters, it wasted the talents of Stan Winston (a bona fide legend), it insults the intelligence of its audience at every opportunity, and worst of all, it’s BORING. There are only two good things about it: the cool-looking monster and the fact that it is only 82 minutes long (which still somehow feels like too much). This might be my least-favorite movie I have ever watched for one of these Monster Mash posts of mine, and I suffered through Humanoids from the Deep and Wolfen.\n\nOne of this movie’s sequels was 2015’s Lake Placid vs. Anaconda, which leads us to our next movie…\n\nAnaconda (1997)\n\nWhen I was talking about the Ninja Turtles a couple weeks ago, I described the 90’s Ninja Turtles movies as iconic slices of 90’s cheese, and the same applies to Anaconda. This is one of those so-bad-it’s-good movies that has developed a cult following over the years, and it’s not hard to see why.\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\nThe cast includes Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Jon Voight, Eric Stoltz, and Owen Wilson. J.Lo plays the director of a film crew making a documentary about a long-lost Amazonian tribe. As they travel down the Amazon River, they encounter Paul Serone, a Paraguayan snake hunter played by Voight. Serone’s behavior is immediately suspicious, and of course it turns out that he’s a poacher hunting for a massive anaconda, and he will stop at nothing to bring the beast in alive for a big payday.\n\nI’m not usually the biggest Jon Voight fan, but he is legendary in this movie. He spends half the movie glowering like he just sucked on a lemon and he is so shifty that it is remarkable anyone trusts him at all. I don’t know what a Paraguayan accent sounds like so I don’t know if Voight’s accent in this film is in any way accurate (though somehow I doubt it), but what I do know is that the man chews the scenery like there is no tomorrow, and I respect it.\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\nHe’s making this face for pretty much the entire movie. Of course he inevitably betrays the rest of the group and most of them die, and then he uses J.Lo and Ice Cube as snake bait. This backfires horribly and his death scene is one of the all-time best. There’s a shot from INSIDE THE SNAKE’S MOUTH AS IT SWALLOWS VOIGHT WHOLE! And then IT BARFS HIM UP WHILE HE IS STILL ALIVE AND PARTIALLY DIGESTED, AND HE WINKS AT J.LO!\n\nAmazing.\n\nI’ve read comments online of people talking about how much this scene traumatized them as kids, and if I had seen this movie as a kid it would have traumatized me too, but watching it in 2024 it’s more funny than scary. The titular anaconda is CGI for a lot of the movie, and it’s that wonky mid-90’s CGI that still had that uncanny valley effect. It doesn’t hold up particularly well but the goofy special effects add to the movie’s goofy charm. This movie has the kind of charm that Lake Placid tried for and missed completely.\n\nJ.Lo and Ice Cube are likable leads and Jon Voight’s hammy performance steals the movie. It’s a schlocky movie but it’s highly entertaining schlock that is reasonably well-made, in spite of (and perhaps because of) the goofy special effects. It’s a fun popcorn movie that is just the thing for a Friday night with friends and drinks.\n\nBefore I close things out, I have to give a special mention to Alexandre Aja’s 2019 film Crawl, which is a top-notch creature feature that I’m not going to say a whole lot about here because I already talked about it back in 2019 and I don’t have much to add. It’s about a college student and her dad who get stuck in the basement of their house in the middle of a massive hurricane, the basement is filling with water and hungry gators are lurking. Crawl is an excellent nail-biter, with solid performances, very good special effects, bloody kills, and constantly escalating tension. I highly recommend it. See you next time for more killer animals!\n\nI saw some movies. Let’s talk about ‘em. Beware of spoilers.\n\nCrawl\n\nCrawl is a movie with a very simple premise: A college student and her dad get stuck in a rapidly-flooding basement during a Category 5 hurricane and must rely on their wits to survive. Also, there are several hungry alligators roaming around that will be more than happy to dine on their tasty human flesh. It’s a movie with a very clear purpose, and it succeeds admirably in achieving that purpose.\n\nCrawl is 87 minutes long, which is just right. The movie doesn’t get bogged down with superfluous exposition or flashbacks, and the brisk running time ensures that there is never a dull moment. There are some flashbacks, but they serve to effectively build the relationship between the two main characters and never go on for too long.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nThe main characters are Haley Keller (played by Kaya Scodelario) and her dad, Dave (played by Barry Pepper). Haley is a member of the swimming team at the University of Florida, and her swimming skills will come in very handy during her and her father’s harrowing ordeal. A Category 5 hurricane is rapidly approaching and Haley and her sister are concerned about their father since neither of them have been able to reach him on his cell phone. Haley decides to look for him, and eventually finds him in the basement of their old house.\n\nWouldn’t you know it, Dave’s got a badly broken leg, the water level in the basement is rising quickly, and there are the aforementioned gators that would like nothing more than to make the Kellers their dinner. As the water rises, it gives the ravenous reptiles more room to maneuver and increases the pressure on Haley and Dave.\n\nIn addition to being wonderfully simple and effective, the film’s premise is at least somewhat plausible. Something like this could conceivably happen, which isn’t something that is often said about horror movies. Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper are both very good in the lead roles, they have believable chemistry and are smart and resourceful, which makes them easy to root for. This movie wouldn’t work nearly as well if the lead characters weren’t as good as they are.\n\nThe movie was directed by Alexandre Aja, a French provocateur known for ultra-violent slasher movies such as High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes and Piranha 3D. Crawl is much more restrained than many of Aja’s other films, and he does a great job ratcheting up the tension as the film progresses. This is still a horror movie, so there are some grisly moments but the gore feels more impactful than the relentless splatter of some of Aja’s other films (the outrageously gruesome beach party massacre in Piranha comes to mind).\n\nCrawl is made with great technical skill (the gators are CGI but done so well that it’s never distracting), razor-sharp suspense, and two compelling lead performances. It’s a movie that knows exactly what kind of movie it is, and it accomplishes what it sets out to do with flying colors. It never gets bogged down with unnecessary exposition or extraneous subplots. It’s lean, mean, and packs a sharp bite, much like those toothy gators. Fans of horror and suspense movies should eat it up.\n\nZombieland: Double Tap\n\nIt’s amazing that three of the four lead actors in Zombieland: Double Tap look exactly the same now as they did when the original Zombieland movie came out a full decade ago. Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone all look the same in this movie as they did in the original, it is seriously uncanny. The only main cast member to look significantly different in the new movie is Abigail Breslin, which makes perfect sense when you consider that she was 13 years old when the first movie was released and is now 23.\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\nGiven the ten-year gap, it’s amazing that this movie exists at all, and even more amazing that it’s as much fun as it is. It’s definitely not as good as the original, which came out of nowhere and surprised everyone by being as good as it was, and is still one of my favorite zombie movies. It was also one of Emma Stone’s breakout roles, she used the ten-year gap in between Zombieland movies to win an Oscar for La La Land in 2016 and star in two Spider-Man movies, among many others. I could go on for a while about what the other actors have been doing in the intervening years but I’m not going to because I have a huge crush on Emma Stone and have no shame admitting it.\n\nAnyway, despite lacking the freshness and originality of the first movie, Double Tap is still a highly entertaining romp through a zombie-filled USA that captures the original’s movie spirit of zombie action, quirky characters and irreverent humor. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel but since the first movie’s formula worked so well it’s a classic case of not fixing what ain’t broke.\n\nI don’t have a whole lot to say about this movie other than that if you enjoyed the first one you will probably enjoy the follow-up. The returning cast members are great and there are some fun new additions, the most memorable of which is probably Zoey Deutch as Madison, a clueless blonde who has nonetheless managed to survive the zombie-infested world. As Woody Harrelson’s trigger-happy character Tallahassee puts it, “Zombies eat brains, and she ain’t got none.” When he says this he is wondering how Madison has managed to survive, but perhaps he’s also answering his own question.\n\nZombieland: Double Tap is nothing revolutionary, but there’s still plenty of fun to be had as long as you don’t go into it expecting too much.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate\n\nOkay, this movie is brand new and I’m gonna talk about some spoilers, so hold off on reading this if you haven’t seen it yet.\n\nLet’s just start off by saying that the timeline of the Terminator movies is (and arguably always has been) a complete mess. This is somewhat inevitable given the time travel elements of the story, but at this point you’d need some kind of a PhD to make sense of it all. This, combined with the lukewarm reception to the previous three Terminator movies, led the makers of this latest installment to ignore the previous three movies entirely and make Dark Fate a direct sequel to 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which is widely and justly regarded as one of the best action movies ever made.\n\nThese are big shoes to fill, and while Dark Fate is (again, perhaps inevitably) not as good as the first two classic Terminator films, third-best out of six ain’t too bad. Yes, I am saying that this is the best Terminator movie since Terminator 2. Dark Fate is the second film directed by Tim Miller, who made the first Deadpool movie. He fills Dark Fate to the brim with top-notch action, and because of this I found it to be a very enjoyable movie, despite some controversial plot points.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nOkay, it’s time to talk about the elephant in the room, and that elephant’s name is John Connor. Terminator: Dark Fate kills him off, early. Double shotgun blast, dead. No question. Yep, the hero of mankind’s future resistance against the machines is promptly and unequivocally dispatched. This is something that will doubtless piss off a lot of die-hard Terminator fans, but…it didn’t actually bother me very much. I don’t know, maybe it’s because I haven’t seen Terminator 2 in a long time, but my reaction to John’s death was more “Oh, wow! I didn’t see that coming!” and less “HOW DARE THEY?!?!?!” I’m a Terminator fan but for whatever reason I was pretty ambivalent about John’s swift demise.\n\nI guess what I’m saying is that if you can get past the movie’s decision to dispatch John Connor, you’ll probably have fun with Dark Fate. I did. If you just can’t believe that the movie would kill John so quickly, you probably won’t like it much. Which would be a shame in my opinion, because there’s quite a lot to like about the movie.\n\nThe first thing to like about it is the cast. Linda Hamilton returns to the franchise after nearly thirty years, playing John’s mother Sarah, who is now a grizzled badass who is worn out after decades of fighting evil robots and is wanted in all 50 states. It’s great to see Hamilton back, she is a reminder of why people got excited about Terminator movies in the first place.\n\nAlso very good is Mackenzie Davis as Grace, an enhanced soldier sent back in time from the future to protect someone who is not John Connor. Grace is tormented by her dark past, which is also in the future…look, time travel is really confusing, but Mackenzie Davis is great. I liked her a lot, and not just because she carries on Linda Hamilton’s Terminator 2 legacy of having incredible biceps.\n\nAnd of course there is the Governator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing the Terminator robot who killed John but has since come to learn the error of his ways and has even found a family, who adorably call him Carl. “I’m never gonna fuckin’ call you Carl,” Sarah growls at him, in one of the movie’s funniest lines. And Carl is surprisingly funny. The movie gets a lot of mileage out of subverting the audience’s expectations for what a killer robot from the future would spend its time doing after completing its mission, which is something I admit had never occurred to me (Carl owns a drapery business).\n\nThe overall plot is mostly a rehash of previous Terminator movies. You know the drill: evil robot gets sent back in time to kill someone, good robot gets sent back in time to protect said someone. Dark Fate is basically the same thing, with a couple of different wrinkles. The evil robot this time around is called a REV-9, and in addition to being able to mimic people like the T-1000 in Terminator 2, it can also make copies of itself, which is problematic for our heroes, to say the least. Played by Gabriel Luna, the REV-9 is a fearsome foe, and is every bit as tenacious as previous Terminator antagonists.\n\nLook, Dark Fate is not a great movie. I called it the best Terminator movie since Terminator 2, and I stand by that statement, but that does not mean it’s a great movie. The plot is largely a rehash of previous installments and it can feel formulaic. But I liked the characters, the action sequences are terrific, it’s surprisingly funny, and overall I enjoyed myself, so I can’t complain too much.\n\nSo there you go, three fun movies I’ve seen this year. I’ve been real lazy about posting lately, and I’ve got some catching up to do. The next movies I want to cover are Spider-Man: Far From Home (which I loved) and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, which stars not two but THREE of my favorite actors. Those were fun movies and I’m looking forward to writing about them.\n\nI’ve seen some fun movies over the last couple weeks and haven’t had time to write about them until now, so let’s talk about ‘em. First up is John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum. I’m a big fan of the John Wick series, and my expectations going into the third movie were pretty high.\n\nFortunately, director Chad Stahelski and star Keanu Reeves didn’t let me down. John Wick 3 is every bit as kinetic and badass as the previous films in the series. The John Wick movies continue to be an absolute dream come true for action junkies such as myself, and the action sequences in this movie are nothing less than poetry in motion.\n\nBrutally violent poetry, but hey.\n\nImage: Lionsgate\n\nThe third movie does have some pacing issues and is maybe a bit overlong, and the plot can be kinda confusing. I’m still not sure who that guy John meets in the desert was supposed to be. But it doesn’t matter, because the movie delivers where it counts: ACTION. Keanu Reeves is such a badass that you’d never guess he’s 54 years old. The dude puts actors half his age to absolute shame.\n\nI could go into more detail about the extent of this movie’s awesomeness, but it’s been a few weeks since I saw it so I don’t think I could really do it justice. It has some flaws but they are more than overcome by the ferocious intensity of its action. Keanu is one of our best action stars and seems like a genuinely cool guy in real life. How much ass does this movie kick? All of it.\n\nNext up is Aladdin. The original Aladdin is one of my favorite classic Disney movies, and it’s one of the first movies that I clearly remember seeing in a theater (I must have been around five), so it holds a very special place in my heart. I was cautiously optimistic about the new live-action version of the movie, since I genuinely love Aladdin but the new movie was directed by Guy Ritchie, a filmmaker that I have a…complicated relationship with. The movie got mixed reviews and plenty of people didn’t seem to like it, so I was prepared for potential disappointment.\n\nFortunately, I couldn’t have been more wrong. The new version of Aladdin is an absolute joy and I enjoyed the heck out of it. It delivers everything you want from Aladdin: all the characters, all the songs, the great story, all of it. The production design, sets, special effects and costumes are excellent across the board, the songs are vibrant and catchy, and the movie is, above all, fun.\n\nImage: Disney\n\nWill Smith also deserves a lot of credit for taking over the role of the Genie and making it his own. He did a great job with it, it must have been hard taking over from a performance as iconic as Robin Williams was in the original version, but I was very impressed with Smith’s work in the film. I don’t know what more you could ask for from a live-action version of Aladdin. It has some flaws, sure, but much like John Wick the overall experience is so enjoyable that its flaws are easy to overlook.\n\nGuy Ritchie toned down the aggressive stylization that characterizes much of his work and made a movie that honestly far exceeded my expectations. The critics were very mean to it but don’t listen to them. See the movie and decide for yourself. The movie is “Rotten” on Rotten Tomatoes, but I have become increasingly jaded with Rotten Tomatoes ratings and don’t put much stock in them. The popularity of Rotten Tomatoes is something that I think has really hurt the movie industry in a lot of ways, and its ratings hold far too much sway over whether audiences see a movie or not.\n\nThis is a discussion for another time, but it boils down to this: if a movie you’re interested in gets a bad Rotten Tomatoes score or whatever, who cares? See the movie for yourself and make up your own mind. Your opinion is every bit as valid as those of so-called “professional critics.” Who needs ‘em?\n\nSpeaking of fun movies with mediocre Rotten Tomatoes scores, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is another one. For the last Godzilla movie, which came out in 2014, everyone was like, “there’s not enough Godzilla.” Godzilla appears early and often in the new movie and there’s all the monster-smashing action you could wish for. So what does everyone say? “There’s too much Godzilla.” MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MINDS PEOPLE!!!\n\nI hear people say that the plot of this movie is ridiculous. Of course it is! Have y’all never seen a Godzilla movie before, or any monster movie at all for that matter? They’re all ridiculous, across the board. It’s part of what makes them fun. If you’re complaining about the plausibility of a monster movie, you’re completely missing the point. This is something that should not require explanation.\n\nImage: Warner Bros./Legendary\n\nKing of the Monsters was directed by Michael Dougherty, and it’s his first foray into big-budget blockbuster filmmaking. His previous movies included the cult classics Trick ‘r Treat and Krampus, and he’s clearly a guy who loves monster movies. His film brings together some of the most classic monsters from the long-running series of Japanese Godzilla films (there are seriously like 30 Godzilla movies). There’s Mothra (a giant moth, obviously), Rodan (basically a humongous pterodactyl), and King Ghidorah, a massive three-headed dragon who is the movie’s main antagonist.\n\nI don’t know if you knew this, but it’s actually been scientifically-proven that nothing on earth is cooler and more badass than a three-headed dragon, except for maybe John Wick. You can’t argue with this, it’s science.\n\nAgain, I’m not saying this movie is perfect by any means. The plot is a bit hard to follow and there are a lot of great actors in this movie who get almost nothing to do. Poor Charles Dance, for example, does almost nothing but glower in the background of a few scenes. So yes, the characters in the movie are not very memorable, despite being played by capable actors such as Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Kyle Chandler, Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins (the latter two reprising their roles from the 2014 Godzilla film). But it’s no slight against these very good actors to say that they’re not the real stars of the movie.\n\nThe stars of a movie subtitled “King of the Monsters” are the damn monsters, and they are AWESOME. They look great, they sound great, they smash stuff real good. A lot of care and attention clearly went into the design and creation of these mighty beasts, and the action sequences in the movie are thrilling and fun. There were multiple times during the movie where I thought to myself, “now THIS is the stuff I pay to see!” and that’s pretty much the highest compliment I can give. I came for fun monster action, and fun monster action was what I got, so I left the theater happy. Bring on Godzilla Vs. Kong, which is set for release next year.\n\nSo there you go, three movies that weren’t perfect but hey, what movie is? Other than Die Hard, anyway. John Wick 3, Aladdin and the new Godzilla film are excellent summer entertainment, critics be damned. If you want to see a movie, go see it. If you pick one of these you’ll have a good time. Next up is X-Men: Dark Phoenix and Elton John biopic Rocketman, which came out this weekend but I haven’t seen yet. Next weekend, hopefully! Go have fun at the movies!\n\nIt was a cinematic year that was primarily dominated by two Marvel villains, both of whom made big splashes. It’s hard to pick just one for the coveted title of Villain Of The Year, but ultimately there was one villain who just had to be given the title, and that villain is…\n\nThanos in Avengers: Infinity War\n\nIt had to be Thanos as Villain Of The Year. No other villain made as much of an impact on the lives of a movie’s characters. And not only did Thanos massively change (and, at least temporarily, end) the lives of dozens of superheroes, he also hugely impacted the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has become a box-office juggernaut ever since the release of Iron Man in 2008. With Thanos, Marvel showed that it is not afraid to shake up the status quo of its hugely profitable film franchise. And really, the fact that Thanos actually succeeded in wiping out half of all life in the universe makes him Villain Of The Year pretty much automatically.\n\nMarvel/Disney\n\nAlso, remember when he THREW A PLANET AT IRON MAN??? Holy crap that was awesome.\n\nJosh Brolin did fantastic work bringing Thanos to life, and the writers, directors, and special-effects people created a character who was surprisingly sympathetic, instead of the two-dimensional power-hungry jerk the character could have easily been if he had not been handled so well. Infinity War was the culmination of a decade’s worth of blockbuster movies, and thanks to Thanos the Marvel Cinematic Universe will never be the same. And for the record, I am still not over that Spider-Man scene. You know the one. Sniff.\n\nErik Killmonger in Black Panther\n\nMarvel/Disney\n\nIn any other year, Killmonger would have been Villain Of The Year. But thanks to Thanos, he is a very strong runner-up. Michael B. Jordan was excellent and turned Killmonger, much like Thanos, into a deeply sympathetic and even tragic figure. The viewer could understand Killmonger’s point of view, even while disagreeing with his actions. He was charismatic, intelligent and badass. He was everything a great movie villain should be. I’ve got him as a very close runner-up for VOTY, but if he’s your number one I’m not going to tell you that you’re wrong.\n\nCaptain Wafner in Overlord\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nIn stark contrast to sympathetic villains like Thanos and Killmonger, Captain Wafner was a villain with no redeeming qualities at all. He was a sadistic Nazi captain who was irredeemably evil even before he got half his face blown off and injected himself with an experimental serum that gave him ungodly strength and turned him into even more of a monster. Overlord was one of the year’s goriest thrill rides, and its villain was one of the year’s nastiest.\n\nThe Predators in The Predator\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nSpeaking of gory thrill rides, it’s a toss-up between Overlord and Shane Black’s much-maligned Predator reboot for the title of goriest movie of the year. The Predator had its share of flaws, but I still found it to be an enjoyable, if bumpy, ride, and probably the best thing about it was seeing the different varieties of Predator that Black and his creative team conjured up. The design of the Predator in the original 1987 Predator movie was great to begin with, so Black didn’t change it too much. But he did add a few new wrinkles that were fun to see even if the Predator dog creatures were a little goofy, complete as they were with Predator dreadlocks.\n\nThe Meg in The Meg\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nThe Meg is the film that finally answered the age-old question, “What would happen if Jason Statham were to fight an enormous shark?” The Meg is a deeply cheesy B-movie that was nonetheless quite enjoyable, and its massive shark was its crowning achievement. Or should I say sharks, because there are actually two of the giant beasts. The toothy monstrosities are enormous and, of course, hungry for nubile human flesh. The Meg is a thoroughly preposterous movie that is certainly no masterpiece, but it is quite a bit of fun and its gargantuan shark beasts should be more than enough to satisfy any fan of aquatic monster movies.\n\nSolomon Lane and August Walker in Mission: Impossible – Fallout\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nTom Cruise’s latest Mission: Impossible flick was the thrill ride of the year, and it had two quality villains to give Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and the rest of his team a run for their money. Sean Harris reprises his role as the diabolical Solomon Lane from the previous M:I film, and Superman himself, Henry Cavill, played August Walker, who was more than a match for Ethan in a fight. Give Lane and Walker credit: they came this close to enacting their evil plan, only to be thwarted at literally the last possible second. Being a bad guy can be a thankless task when all your hard work comes to naught. Hopefully they’ll try again in a few years, because I want more Mission: Impossible movies. Or at least Lane can try again, Walker won’t be able to participate on account of being extremely dead.\n\nGhost in Ant-Man and The Wasp\n\nMarvel/Disney\n\nIt was a year of sympathetic villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ghost was a young woman who was suffering from a unique condition that gave her the ability to phase through solid objects and teleport short distances, which made her hard to handle in a fight, though her powers are unstable. But she became more sympathetic once the viewer learned about her tragic backstory, how she lost her parents in the lab accident that gave her powers and how shady government types took advantage of her powers to turn her into a weapon. She was the main superpowered antagonist for most of Ant-Man and The Wasp, but the movie ends with her seemingly cured of her affliction so perhaps we’ll see her again down the road.\n\nThe Murdersaurus (technically the Indoraptor) Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\n\nUniversal\n\nYou could argue that the main villains of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom were the morons who thought it would be a good idea to auction off a bunch of dinosaurs, and you wouldn’t be wrong. But those people were all idiots and dinosaurs are much cooler, so let’s talk about the Indoraptor instead. I dubbed it the Murdersaurus because it was a genetically-engineered death lizard designed specifically for hunting and killing. It gets to do a lot of hunting and killing in the second half of Fallen Kingdom, and I was kind of sad when it died because it was my favorite character in the movie.\n\nLizzy and Ralph in Rampage\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nSpeaking of monster movies where all of the human characters were pretty dumb, Rampage was another deeply silly movie that I enjoyed quite a bit, it just might have been my guilty-pleasure movie of the year. The monsters were George the albino gorilla, Ralph the wolf, and Lizzy the (I think) alligator, all of whom were mutated to enormous size and exceptional ferocity. I didn’t include George as one of the villains because he ultimately becomes a good ape again, despite causing a lot of death and destruction. The monsters are fun to watch and the special effects are top-notch, and much like Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom the monsters are much more entertaining the bland human characters.\n\nThe Screenslaver in Incredibles 2\n\nDisney/Pixar\n\nFor a kids movie, Incredibles 2 had a surprisingly sophisticated villain. Writer/director Brad Bird’s long-awaited follow-up to his 2008 original, Incredibles 2 is that rare movie that is fun for kids but also contains a lot for adults to enjoy. This is a movie that treats its viewers with respect, regardless of whether that viewer happens to be a kid or a grown-up. It’s a tricky balancing act, but Incredibles 2 makes it look easy. The Screenslaver is a villain who takes advantage of the world’s overreliance on technology, and manipulates the omnipresent screens that are all around us. That’s a scary idea. The Screenslaver is one of the most culturally-relevant cinematic villains of the year.\n\nDryden Vos in Solo: A Star Wars Story\n\nDisney/Lucasfilm\n\nPaul Bettany is one of my favorite actors. He’s the kind of actor who elevates any movie he’s in. Since he frequently plays good guys, it’s always fun to watch him cut loose as a bad guy and really chew some scenery. He chewed scenery with aplomb in the latest Star Wars spinoff as a ruthless crime lord named Dryden Vos, who was at least part alien. Dryden is the kind of villain who acts friendly one moment but can explode into murderous rage at the drop of a hat. I like villains like that because their unpredictability ensures that the viewer is always on edge whenever they are around. Bettany’s role in the film is not a huge one, which is not too surprising if you’re aware of the movie’s behind-the-scenes drama (Bettany’s role was initially played by a different actor), but he makes an impression with a limited amount of screen time, as all great actors do.\n\nCable in Deadpool 2\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nOkay, so this is another debatable one, since Cable and Deadpool end up as allies. But much like Ghost in Ant-Man and The Wasp, Cable serves as the superpowered antagonist for much of the film, so he counts. It was a big year for Josh Brolin playing Marvel comics characters, and he was perfectly cast as the gruff cyborg Cable. He looks pretty much identical to how Cable looks in the comics, and is placed front and center along with Deadpool in the movie’s biggest action scenes. Deadpool 2 was more cluttered than its predecessor, but it benefited from a more complex antagonist, even though I haven’t forgotten that Cable and Deadpool become pals by the end of the movie and have a long history of teaming up in the comics, so perhaps we’ll be seeing more of him in the future.\n\nMathias Vogel in Tomb Raider\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nWalton Goggins was another actor who had a busy year playing villains. In addition to playing the main villain in this year’s Tomb Raider reboot, he also played a secondary villain in Ant-Man and The Wasp. Goggins is an actor who frequently plays slimy bad guys, and he was well-suited to both of his villainous roles this year. In Tomb Raider he played Mathias Vogel, the leader of an expedition to find a hidden artifact with Great and Terrible Power. He was not a nice person, but he was at least somewhat sympathetic by virtue of the fact that he had been stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere for years and desperately wanted to return home. Still, he was a nasty fellow and his death was thematically appropriate and quite satisfying.\n\nSo there you have it, my favorite villains of 2018. Keep in mind that this was not a comprehensive list of every villain in every movie I saw this year, it was simply a list of my favorites. There were a surprising number of sympathetic villains this year, which makes me happy because if there is one thing I like it is a complex bad guy. 2019 is bringing us another full slate of bad guys, including the return of Thanos and the most dreaded evil clown of all, Pennywise. See you at the movies!\n\nThe theme for this Monster Mash is that there is no theme. That may be cheating, but I don’t care. This is a completely random selection of movies that have nothing whatsoever to do with each other. Beware of spoilers. Here we go!\n\nGraveyard Shift (1990)\n\nGraveyard Shift is based on Stephen King’s short story of the same name from his 1978 story collection Night Shift, and is one of several films based on stories from the book. Graveyard Shift tells the story of a Maine textile mill suffering from what could generously be called a rodent infestation. The movie expands on some aspects of the story, giving more details to the main characters and the town the mill is in, which depends on the mill to keep it going and can’t afford to have the mill closed.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nThe mill is run by a corrupt and cruel foreman named Warwick, who pays off the building inspector to keep the mill open and runs the place with an iron fist. He rounds up a group of employees to clean out the mill’s filthy basement, and in the process the group discovers a warren of tunnels underneath the mill, and a grotesque bat-like monster that dwells beneath. The monster is gross and cool-looking, and hunts the hapless workers through the subterranean tunnels. It also suffers a grisly death when the protagonist traps it in a cotton picker and the beast is ground to bits.\n\nPeople who suffer from claustrophobia or have an aversion to rodents should avoid this movie like the plague, although it’s a decent horror thriller. The acting is solid and the mill itself and the tunnels beneath it look appropriately worn-out and ancient. The mill looks like it would be a wretched place to work, especially at night, which makes the movie a bit depressing at times, but perhaps that’s the point. You might need a shower and a walk outside in the sunshine after watching this one.\n\nThe movie adds more detail to some aspects of the short story, but it also dumbs some of it down. The story has multiple kinds of mutated rats lurking in the basement, but the movie just has the giant rat/bat monster, as well as your garden-variety rodents. It’s too bad that the movie doesn’t have more variety in its icky antagonists, but the rat/bat monster is cool. Maybe that’s where all the special-effects budget went and there wasn’t anything left over, I dunno.\n\nGraveyard Shift isn’t one of the more prestigious adaptations of Stephen King’s work, and won’t be mentioned in the same breath as King classics like The Shining, Carrie, or It. But Graveyard Shift still makes for a solid creature feature, as long as you have a high tolerance for creepy crawlies.\n\nPumpkinhead (1988)\n\nPumpkinhead was the directorial debut of the legendary Stan Winston, whose resume includes Terminator, Predator, Jurassic Park, Iron Man, Aliens, Avatar, and many more. It stars Lance Henriksen as Ed Harley, a man living a simple life in the country running a small grocery store with his young son Billy. Ed and Billy and their dog Gypsy are happy together until Billy is tragically killed when he is hit by a motorcycle driven by a guy named Joel, who is in the area camping with his friends, who are also present when Billy is killed. Joel is on probation for a similar motorcycle incident and refuses to let his friends contact the authorities.\n\nStricken with grief and rage, Ed takes Billy’s body to a supposed witch who lives in a dingy cabin in the middle of a swamp. She tells him she can’t bring Billy back to life, and Ed tells her he wants revenge. That’s something she can help him with, but warns him that vengeance comes with a terrible price. Ed decides to go through with it and the witch brings to life a spindly demon called Pumpkinhead which proceeds to hunt down not just Joel, but all of his friends with him, even though they were not responsible for what happened to Billy and tried to do the right thing in the wake of the accident.\n\nAs Pumpkinhead begins to hunt down Joel and the other campers, Ed experiences the beast’s murders through the monster’s eyes. He realizes he has made a terrible mistake and begs the witch to call the monster off. She replies that the monster will not stop until all of its targets are dead, and warns Ed that he will be killed as well if he attempts to stop it. Ed ignores her and attempts to help the surviving campers, leading to a series of tense confrontations with the relentless demon.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nAs the monster kills more, Ed and the other survivors notice that Pumpkinhead’s face is becoming more human-looking and that it is beginning to resemble Ed’s face. This leads to the realization that Ed and the monster are connected, and Ed kills himself to stop the demon and save the remaining campers, dooming himself to become the next iteration of Pumpkinhead for the next poor soul who goes to the witch seeking vengeance.\n\nNormally I don’t go into that much detail for the plot of a Monster Mash movie, but in this case I felt it was appropriate. For a film called Pumpkinhead, there is a surprising amount of emotional depth to the story. Ed has a strong character arc for the protagonist of an 80’s horror movie with a cheesy title. He goes from happy with his son to grieving at his son’s abrupt demise, he becomes fueled by vengeance and sets loose a demon upon the people who wronged him, only to realize he made a terrible mistake and that vengeance is not the answer, as well as realizing that his actions have doomed people who were not responsible for what happened to his son, and sacrifices himself to save them.\n\nAt every step of this process, Lance Henriksen does great work in making Ed a sympathetic protagonist, his actions are extreme but understandable given his emotional turmoil. The movie also engenders a lot of sympathy for Pumpkinhead’s victims, since most of them are good people who tried to do the right thing after Ed’s son was killed. Even the initially-despicable Joel begins to see the error of his ways.\n\nStan Winston is responsible for some of the most iconic and influential movie monsters of all time, and the spindly, demonic Pumpkinhead may be one of his most underrated creations. The beast is genuinely creepy and its murder spree, while not as graphic as slasher films like Friday the 13th, is still quite harrowing, made all the more so by the sympathy the viewer feels for its victims.\n\nPumpkinhead is a surprisingly great movie that absolutely deserves its status as a cult classic. Stan Winston died from cancer in 2008 at the age of 62. It’s a damn shame he didn’t get to direct more of his own films, since Pumpkinhead shows a lot of promise for a first-time director. But his many iconic creations will live on and continue to inspire generations of aspiring filmmakers, and for that we can all be grateful.\n\nJurassic Park III (2001)\n\nJP3 is the black sheep of the Jurassic Park series, the awkward middle child of the family. There were the first two Jurassic Park movies made by Steven Spielberg, and then there were the more recent Jurassic World movies with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard. Sandwiched haphazardly in between is Jurassic Park III, directed by Joe Johnston, who made the first Captain America movie, The First Avenger, in 2010.\n\nJP3 is barely 90 minutes long, in sharp contrast to the other four films, all of which are around two hours long. That’s because JP3 has no plot. None. Some random kid disappears in the vicinity of one of the dinosaur islands, and original Jurassic Park protagonist Alan Grant, played once again by Sam Neill, is hired under false pretenses to help look for him. The movie tries to throw in a couple of extra wrinkles to the plot, all of which are predictable and do nothing to make the movie feel like a complete story.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nAll of that sounded harsh, so let me clarify: I don’t hate this movie. It’s reasonably well-made and entertaining, there are fun action sequences and the Stan Winston-created dinosaurs look great. Admittedly the bird-like velociraptors are kinda dopey and haven’t aged well, but the Spinosaurus is badass. But by the end of the movie, there’s no sense of having arrived anywhere, no feeling that anything important happened. It’s a reasonably diverting way to kill an hour and a half, but it’s no surprise that JP3 is the least-remembered film in the series.\n\nDeep Blue Sea 2 (2018)\n\nDeep Blue Sea 2 is the recent direct-to-video sequel to the original Deep Blue Sea. It stars no one you’ve ever heard of and looks like it cost about a buck-fifty to make. The back cover of the Blu-Ray mentions the events of the original film and makes it sound like the new one is a direct sequel, but in the movie itself there are no references to the original whatsoever and aside from a vaguely similar premise the two movies have nothing to do with each other.\n\nI will admit to having a certain fondness for low-budget, straight-to-video sequels to movies that had wide theatrical releases, A-list stars, and much higher budgets. Such low-budget schlock can be quite a bit of fun, but sadly Deep Blue Sea 2 is mostly just boring. The film’s budget must have been so low that they could barely afford to put any actual sharks in the movie, CGI or otherwise.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nThis poster scene is a lie, by the way. It doesn’t happen in the movie. The characters wander endlessly through flooded hallways that all look exactly the same, with different colors of lighting being the only distinguishing feature. There’s no tension or suspense, the characters are boring and the plot, if you can call it that, is a rehash of the original. Honestly, the best thing about this movie is the ample and frequently-displayed cleavage of the lead actress. It’s like the makers of this cheapie knew there was nothing else of any interest going on or anything cool to look at, so they put the lead actress in a skintight, low-cut wetsuit for most of the movie. It’s better than nothing, I guess.\n\nThe Pyramid (2014)\n\nThe Pyramid is a found-footage movie with lots of jump scares. That sentence alone should be enough to dissuade many people from seeing this film, since people love to complain about jump scares and found-footage horror films. There has been a deluge of such films ever since the massive success of the first Paranormal Activity movie in 2007 and Cloverfield in 2008. It’s been a genre of increasingly diminishing returns since then, and The Pyramid is no exception. It’s not completely terrible so much as it is exceptionally average.\n\nAs with other found-footage movies, The Pyramid claims to document actual events, which of course it does not. The fake true events that comprise the film’s story surround the discovery of a pyramid in Egypt buried 600 feet beneath the surface of the desert. This pyramid is three-sided, unlike other pyramids, and a team of five people soon ventures inside. This turns out to be a BIG MISTAKE, as they soon find themselves lost and trapped within the dusty, dark confines of the ancient structure. They also discover that they are not alone.\n\nThe problem I have with these found-footage movies is that they’re all the same. Some people hear about some weird stuff going on somewhere and gear up to investigate, only to encounter something horrible and never be heard from again. The most influential movie in the genre is The Blair Witch Project, released in 1999, a film loved and hated in equal measure. The Pyramid is The Blair Witch Project with Egyptian trappings, and follows the exact same structure as you might expect, right down to the frustratingly ambiguous ending.\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nSo why am I talking about this film during a Monster Mash? Well, the pyramid is full of emaciated, hairless, feral cats that have adapted to their dark confines and become rather vicious. They cause plenty of problems but the main reason The Pyramid counts as a monster movie is because of Anubis, the half-man, half-jackal Egyptian god who ushered souls into the afterlife. He does quite a bit of afterlife-ushering in this movie, and his pursuit of the hapless protagonists are the best scenes in the film. He looks cool and I like the fact that he’s the main antagonist. How many other films have an actual Egyptian god stalking people? Not many.\n\nAnubis doesn’t make The Pyramid a good movie, but at least he makes it more interesting. The found-footage angle of this movie doesn’t even make sense. These kinds of movies are meant to be composed of footage shot by the characters themselves, and as such two of the people who venture into the pyramid are members of a documentary crew. You’d think that the movie would be entirely made up of their footage, but it isn’t. The movie cheats by frequently showing much of the action in the exact same way any other movie would, only using the found-footage conceit when it’s convenient. This renders the entire point of the found-footage thing moot.\n\nThe Pyramid is a decent scare-fest but it lacks originality and its scares are mostly predictable. Anubis is a cool antagonist but his inclusion is not enough to help the film rise from the depths of mediocrity. When the inevitable “History of Found-Footage Movies” book is written, The Pyramid will be little more than a footnote.\n\nSpawn (1997)\n\nCalling Spawn a monster movie is a bit of a stretch, since technically it’s a comic-book superhero movie. But it’s full of enough grotesque demons and hellspawn that I figure it counts as a monster movie. It’s right in the middle section of the Venn diagram of monster movies and superhero movies. It stars Michael Jai White as Al Simmons, a black ops operative who is betrayed and killed by his shady boss Jason Wynn (played by Martin Sheen) and sent to hell. In hell Al makes a deal with a demon called Malebolgia. Al agrees to serve Malebolgia and lead the armies of hell, and in return Malebolgia will allow him to return to Earth to see his wife again.\n\nThe demon inevitably screws Al over and soon Al becomes involved in a weird and frankly rather baffling plot. I haven’t read any of the Spawn comics, but I found the story of the film to be very hard to follow. Of course Al seeks revenge on the duplicitous Jason Wynn, but there are a bunch of other characters and subplots that are thrown around haphazardly and the movie feels cluttered and unfocused.\n\nI’ve got to talk about the CGI in this movie. It’s awful. This film has some of the worst-looking CGI characters I’ve ever seen. The Malebolgia demon looks like something from a 90’s PlayStation game, the scenes that take place in hell look like they were created on a laptop, and the final battle is nearly incomprehensible. Maybe the effects looked OK to audiences in 1997, but they haven’t aged well at all. The Matrix came out two years later and still holds up well today, but the same cannot be said of Spawn’s pixelated hellscapes.\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nIn contrast to the lousy CGI, the film’s practical effects are quite good. Spawn himself looks really cool, and not all of the film’s CGI is bad. There are some very cool shots of Spawn’s red cape billowing out behind him that I liked a lot. Michael Jai White is an accomplished martial artist in real life (he has seven black belts) and a badass actor. He makes Al a sympathetic protagonist, despite the fact that he spends most of the movie covered in layers of makeup that make him look a bit like The Thing from the Fantastic Four, but with third-degree burns.\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nBut White isn’t the movie’s top-billed star. The first name in the credits is John Leguizamo, one of my least-favorite actors. I find him insufferably irritating in every movie I see him in, with the possible exception of John Wick. In Spawn Leguizamo plays a demon named Clown, a fat, crude, repulsive little creature who farts green clouds and eats maggot-filled pizza, and later transforms into an ugly monster called the Violator. He’s obnoxious and unpleasant, but from what I’ve read it’s a pretty accurate representation of the character from the comics. Still, I hated him. Maybe I was supposed to, but the fact remains that he drove me nuts.\n\nSpawn is a profoundly flawed movie, but was still fairly influential in its own way. Its protagonist was one of the first African-American superheroes on film, and the film was one of the first superhero movies to be promoted largely based on the popularity of the then-recent comic book, with Spawn having made his first appearance in 1992. Spawn is a character that could really use a new cinematic incarnation, since special effects have now caught up to the ambitions of the filmmakers of the original movie. There has been talk of a new Spawn movie with Jamie Foxx in the title role and that could be very interesting, but we’ll have to wait and see if it actually happens.\n\nOn a personal note, I remember badly wanting to see this film in 1997 when I was nine years old, and my mom steadfastly refused to let me see it. At the time I thought this was a blatant act of wanton cruelty, but of course my mom was completely right in not letting me see it, because if I had seen Spawn when I was nine it would have traumatized me for weeks. Thanks, mom.\n\nSo there you have it, a bunch of fun if mostly forgettable movies that have nothing to do with each other. Most of the movies I talked about here weren’t that great, but I still had fun watching and writing about them. I’m not going to rank them because most of them weren’t very good and I feel like deciding which one was slightly better or worse would be pointless and arbitrary, but I will say that the best film on this list is Pumpkinhead, and is the only film discussed here that I would wholeheartedly recommend. So check that one out and skip the rest. I watched them so you don’t have to.\n\nEarlier this month I saw The Meg in theaters, and it got me thinking about monster movies with an aquatic setting. Sharks, carnivorous fish and slimy sea monsters await!\n\nThe Meg (2018)\n\nThe Meg is a movie that I wanted to see as soon as I heard about it, since it can be boiled down to “Jason Statham fights a giant shark.” The Meg is an unapologetically silly B-movie, but it’s an unapologetically silly B-movie with a nine-figure budget. It makes me happy that Hollywood is willing to spend that kind of money on cheesy creature features. 2018 has been a good year for such films, since it has also seen the release Of Rampage and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Both films are full of plot holes and people making monumentally stupid decisions, and I enjoyed them both immensely. The Meg follows suit, and once again, I had a lot of fun with it.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nThe Meg of the title is a gigantic prehistoric shark, now extinct. Or is it? In the movie, of course it is not. Jason Statham plays Jonas Taylor, who encountered the beast years ago during an underwater rescue operation. No one believed him at the time but it turns out he was right all along. The Meg is a very fun movie, the kind of movie whose flaws made me like it more. Take lines of dialogue like “that living fossil ate my friend!” as an example of things about this movie that are stupid that I still really liked. That was a poorly constructed sentence, but whatever.\n\nThe Meg was directed by Jon Turteltaub, best known for the National Treasure movies starring Nicolas Cage. Why have Nicolas Cage and Jason Statham never been in a movie together? Someone needs to make that happen. Turteltaub understands the inherently ridiculous nature of the film he’s directing, and wisely doesn’t take it too seriously. The film moves along briskly and the special effects are top-notch. There’s one bit during the climax that was so awesome it made me want to stand up and cheer. The Meg is a deeply silly movie, but it’s a very enjoyable slice of popcorn entertainment.\n\nHumanoids From the Deep (1980)\n\nIn stark contrast to the large budget and A-list stars of The Meg, Humanoids from the Deep is a cheapie from infamous schlockmeister Roger Corman. It concerns the residents of a small fishing town who are set upon by the titular humanoids, who are the result of, you guessed it, a science experiment gone wrong. The movie is every bit as cheap and forgettable as its name implies, although the humanoids themselves look appropriately slimy and gross, thanks to Monster Mash regular Rob Bottin. The movie was directed by a woman named Barbara Peeters, which is surprising when you consider the amount of sexual exploitation present in the film.\n\nNew World Pictures\n\nApparently this was thanks to Corman, who didn’t think Peeters’ initial cut of the film had enough nudity, so he had the movie’s second unit director film additional scenes of the humanoids assaulting women and inserted them into the film without telling Peeters. Classy. With a title like “Humanoids from the Deep,” a certain degree of tastelessness is to be expected, but Corman’s sleazy additions to the film leave a bad taste in the mouth. Let’s forget this piece of junk and move on.\n\nPiranha (1978)\n\nPiranha is another Corman production, and as such contains the requisite amounts of gore and nudity, but thankfully this one isn’t as mean-spirited as Humanoids from the Deep. Piranha was directed by Joe Dante, who made The Howling a few years later. It was one of many films inspired by the huge success of Steven Spielberg’s Jaws in 1975, and is generally regarded today as one of the better Jaws ripoffs, including by Steven Spielberg himself.\n\nNew World Pictures\n"
