        "text": "By George Rose\n\nApril 12, 2018\n\nNew at BOP:\n\nReview: Matrix Resurrections\n\nMovie Review: Moonfall\n\nMovie Reviews: Scream\n\nThe #1 Movie in America\n\nNovember Forecast\n\nThe Many Saints of Newark\n\nOctober Forecast\n\nNew Trivia Question\n\nAll site updates\n\nShare & Save\n\nTweet\n\nPrint this column\n\nIt was just a few weeks ago that hope sprung for video game adaptations with the Tomb Raider reboot. With a little less than $60 million in the bank, hope now seems lost again. You could say Ready Player One’s $40+ million opening renews a bit of that faith but that film just uses the idea of video games, not a specific title. Ramage is sort of stuck between these two movies. On one hand it’s a direct adaptation like Tomb Raider, although a more loose interpretation of the story in comparison. On the other hand you could argue Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s star appeal is closer to that of Spielberg himself. Will Rampage earn the video game average final score of about $60 million or will star power help it unlock the $100+ million achievement?\n\nI want to stay positive, I really do. At best, Rampage stands to be among the top three biggest game adaptations of all time. That’s because only two have earned over $100 million and none have earned more than $135 million. The good news is that Johnson takes $150 million blockbusters dumps every morning after breakfast. After first appearing as a digitized joke in 2001’s The Mummy Returns and staring in 2005’s disastrous Doom adaptation (his first video game movie), he eventually would go on to become one of Hollywood’s most bankable actors. Maybe what the new Tomb Raider lacked was discovering a heroine with a bigger fan base; Alicia Vikander may also have a Supporting Actress Oscar but she doesn’t have Angelina Jolie’s appeal. The Rock might just be the cheat code we’ve been searching for.\n\nVideo game puns aside, there’s little good to look for in Rampage outside of Johnson’s presence. Yes, Rampage is one of the great classic arcades and it should make the visual jump from 8-bits to HD with ease. The problem lies in the writing. As a writer, nothing could be more infuriating. I’d rather watch lazy special effects or have the shaky camera make me nauseous. I do NOT enjoy watching a film fail based on obvious issues with story. Since the trailers showcase some rather enticing action sequences and Johnson can sleep his way through keeping an audience entertained, all middle fingers are pointing at the writing. There are no reviews for the movie that’s opening in three days (as of this writing) so one can assume those that will be posted by the time you read this article will suggest the same thing.\n\nDespite the inevitable, there is still a bit of excitement surrounding Rampage. Being born in the 1980’s and having grown up around the birth of video games, you can expect to see me at the theater on opening weekend. With a $60 million average video game adaptation total, there’s at least a few million of us fans out there. For those ready to log in with me and join the battle, here are 5 Ways to Prep for the ultimate monster mash-up: Rampage!\n\n#1) GODZILLA (1998)\n\nThe premise of Rampage is rather simple: chemicals are released that affect three creatures (gorilla, lizard and wolf), turning them into large and aggressive monsters that destroy cities. In the game, you were the animals and you found pleasure in destroying the environment. As you leveled the skyscrapers, you got bonus points for grabbing helpless civilians from building windows and for crushing tanks as the military attacked. I’m still not sure why people blame games for violence but, hey, I got a new high score for causing mass chaos!\n\nIf the story about a tiny creature growing taller than a tower sounds familiar, it’s because it has been done before. A lot, actually. Godzilla is the mother of all unnaturally altered beasts. Is it really a surprise that a game from the 80’s would use giant monsters similar to Godzilla and King Kong? No, since those movie games didn’t exist back then. It is a surprise, however, that such great game can feel like such a trite piece of filmmaking. You really can’t out-Godzilla the original Japanese legend. We have the classic exports that are decades old and we also have a recent reboot of the giant lizard from 2014. Since the latest American-made Godzilla is a darker take and is intended to be part of a larger cinematic universe (Godzilla vs Kong coming in 2020), it seems more appropriate for a viewing of the comparison to Rampage to be the one-off film from 1998. It was - as the creature itself would encourage - a disaster.\n\nWith blockbuster filmmaker Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) at the helm, everyone expected 1998’s Godzilla to be a monster hit. Instead, it ended with less than $140 million and almost killed the franchise. Thanks to modern technology and 3D enhancements, the series got another restart in 2014. For now, the best way to prep for the giant lizard in Rampage is the watch Hollywood’s last truly terrible attempt at Godzilla. It is sure to help you enjoy Rampage’s variation on the tale and gives you a more reasonable expectation for where this film’s chances lie at the box office, though $140 million might still be asking for too much.\n\n#2) LAKE PLACID (1999)\n\nWe’re only one out of three monsters deep and there’s already a problem with Rampage. In the game, the green beast with a long tail and sharp teeth was assumed to be a lizard. In our defense, fans knew it was lizard because the character’s name was Lizzie. So why, then, would the writers (or producers or director) change that monster in the new film to be a massive crocodile? Granted, the commercials say the results of the toxin will lead to unpredictable results (the wolf can fly now) but those changes should be more consistent with the game. I don’t see a reason to make the film’s green meanie into a crocodile other than trying to avoid the trappings of a comparison to Godzilla. Then again, I’m about to debunk that theory.\n\nAdvertisement"
