        "text": "Welcome back to my Home Movies! Today, we see Godzilla vs. Kong go to war one more time. Aside from that, there’s the release of French Exit, but not much else. The slate continues to be somewhat dry, even counting a new Criterion Collection release. Still, we press on. It’s just how we do things here. Read on for more…\n\nJoey’s Top Pick\n\nGodzilla vs. Kong\n\nI was very much looking forward to Godzilla vs. Kong, even given the declining foundation since Godzilla. I wouldn’t say that it let me down, but it never rose above what it could have been. The monsters are interesting. Everything else? Not so much. It exists as a momentary pleasure, even if it probably is re-watchable in a dumb-fun way. It just could have been more, and that bugs me. In a better week, it wouldn’t be my top pick. This week, however? It cracks the slot. Here is some of what I wrote in my mixed review:\n\nGodzilla vs. Kong is basically what you’d expect out of this property. The movie is big, dumb, and all about creatures, not people. Plus, it basically acts as if parts of Godzilla: King of the Monsters didn’t happen (not necessarily a bad thing). However, it also moves so far past what’s come before, it’s as if there’s a sequel or two that we’ve missed. That sort of nonsense isn’t unexpected, but at times, it’s jarring, considering how many wild things are added here, or just stepped around. It’s a notable aspect of the film, likely a victim of a contentious editing process. The titans survived that process. Everything else? Not so much.\n\nAlso Available This Week\n\nEat Wheaties\n\nFrench Exit\n\nParks & Recreation: The Complete Series (TV)\n\nUs Kids\n\nVoyagers\n\nThe Walking Dead: World Beyond Season One (TV)\n\nYour Honor: Season One (TV)\n\nCriterion Corner\n\nStreetwise/Tiny: The Life of Erin Blackwell\n\nFrom The Criterion Collection: “In 1983, director Martin Bell, photographer Mary Ellen Mark, and journalist Cheryl McCall set out to tell the stories of homeless and runaway teenagers living on the margins in Seattle. Streetwise follows an unforgettable group of kids who survive by hustling, panhandling, and dumpster diving. Its most haunting and enduring figure is iron-willed fourteen-year-old Erin Blackwell, a.k.a. Tiny; the project’s follow-up, Tiny: The Life of Erin Blackwell, completed thirty years later, draws on the filmmakers’ long relationship with their subject, now a mother of ten. Blackwell reflects with Mark on the journey they’ve experienced together, from Blackwell’s battles with addiction to her regrets to her dreams for her children, even as she sees them repeat her own struggles. Taken together, the two films create a devastatingly frank, empathetic portrait of lost youth growing up far too soon in a world that has failed them, and of a family trying to break free of the cycle of trauma—as well as a summation of the life’s work of Mark, an irreplaceable artistic voice.”\n\nStay tuned for more next week…\n\nShare this:"
