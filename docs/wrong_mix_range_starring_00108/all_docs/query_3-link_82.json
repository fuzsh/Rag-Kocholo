But much like other McCarthy works, there was no undoing the mistakes that sowed the seeds of their own demise.\n\nRead More\n\nNo Country For Old Men: America’s Cycle of Violence, And Cosmic Indifference\n\nSince its release, ‘No Country For Old Men’ has stood the test of time as one of the greatest films of all time.

Director Adam Wingard permanently altered the landscape for monster movies and continues to set a new blockbuster standard with every subsequent release, and it all goes back to Godzilla vs. Kong.\n\nRead More\n\nSXSW 2024 Festival Diary Day 8: The Final Day and My Festival Top 5\n\nThe Final Day of the 2024 SXSW Film Festival is here and what a journey it has been.

A dual ode to the pinnacle of the action hero archetype, ‘Kingdom of the Crystal Skull’ and ‘Dial of Destiny’ form two films that exist solely to say goodbye to Indiana Jones, despite, in each case, the film preceding it having already done so. We beg the question, where were these films going?\n\nRead More\n\nWhy We Need to Celebrate ‘Insidious Chapter 2’ More\n\nWith the fifth film in the franchise, ‘Insidious: The Red Door’ releasing this week, now is the perfect time to take a trip into the Further and revisit this absolute gem of the horror genre.
