        "text": "During a St. Petersburg Men's Association meeting several years ago, Willard Patton stood up and urged the powers that be to lower sanction dues for senior bowlers. He berated the American Bowling Congress for not doing the same for seniors he felt had contributed so much to the organization.\n\nPatton's request was denied, but he has continued to press the point through the years.\n\nSuch stubborn determination has kept Patton, 82, on the lanes and bowling in senior leagues at Seminole Lanes and Sunshine Bowl.\n\nThat, in itself, is not unusual considering the large senior bowling population in Pinellas County. But it is unusual when you learn Patton is blind.\n\n\"Back in 1965, I had a stroke and went blind in my left eye,\" Patton said. \"Two years ago, I had an angioplasty for heart troubles. Then I woke up one morning about nine months ago and couldn't see anything out of my right eye either. I went to a couple of eye doctors and they said the strokes had destroyed the optic nerves.\"\n\nPatton visited a specialist who offered a partial cure for $16,000.\n\n\"I couldn't afford that,\" Patton said, \"so I just resigned myself to the fact that I'm legally blind.\"\n\nSuch a traumatic experience could knock the fight out of anybody and Patton is no exception.\n\n\"I used to be pretty combative, but now I refuse to get into an argument with anybody because I can't remember a thing,\" he said, laughing.\n\nThat's one of the toughest things Patton had to face. Argument was the byword of his career. He earned a law degree in Atlanta and spent more than three years in the Army Air Corps judges advocate's office in England and France during World War II. He worked 33 years as an adjudicator for the Veteran's Administration.\n\nAt 32, Patton got a relatively late start in bowling, knocking down duckpins in an Atlanta center.\n\n\"I was a sub on my brother Edmond's team and I liked the sport from then on,\" Patton said.\n\nWhen Patton and his late wife, Eunice, moved to St. Petersburg in 1947, he converted to 10-pin bowling at a now-defunct center in St. Pete Beach. Later, Patton moved his game to Ten Pin Lanes in South Pasadena and then to Seminole Lanes, where he founded the Super Seniors League for bowlers 75 and older. During his early bowling career, Patton carried a 190 average and rolled a career-high 290 game, 747 series.\n\n\"I can't read a paper, can't watch TV and I don't see the pins,\" Patton said. \"I position myself on the lanes between the 25 and 30 boards and just let go. The guys tell me what pins are left and I have enough experience to know what angle to shoot at.\"\n\nPatton is averaging 165 in the Super Senior League and recently finished fourth in the National Senior Olympics.\n\n\"Little by little, I'm able to get around pretty good now, and I have a girlfriend who takes good care of me,\" Patton said. \"I believe in the Lord and I think I'm on good terms with him.\"\n\nGIOVINCO WINS: Lucy Giovinco won the South African Open singles title May 28 in Johannesburg, beating Team USA teammate Kendra Cameron of Gambrills, Md., 298-266. Giovinco beat England's Pauline Buck 256-180 to make the final.\n\nGiovinco is a five-time Team USA member from Norcross, Ga., and a former Tampa resident. She graduated from Hillsborough Community College, became its bowling instructor, and was the first American woman to win the World Cup in Tehran, Iran, in 1976.\n\nTeam USA won five of seven events and the overall title. South Africa's Daniel Kerr won the men's singles title, beating America's Chris Barnes of Wichita, Kan., 237-221.\n\nWIBC UPDATE: Carolyn Trump of Fort Myers remained in second in the Classic Division's singles competition with a 748 series behind leader Jan Schmidt of Rochelle, Ill., with a 765.\n\nHelen Edwards of Texarkana, Ark., and Joanne DePatis of Beaverville, Ill., took the Division II doubles lead with a 1,188 pinfall. Goodie Dave of Alexandria, Va., and Sandi Harling of Forestville, Md., grabbed the Division III doubles lead with a 1,087 total.\n\nAROUND THE LANES: Billy Finocchi rolled a 299 game, an 802 series and a four-game set of 1,081 at Rainbow Lanes. . . . Earl Weaver nailed a 299 game and a 956 four-game set at Dunedin Lanes. . . . The ABC championship tournament ended Sunday at Huntsville, Ala., with Brian Olson of Fargo, N.D., rolling its final 300 game. Final official results will be released next week. . . . Despite rumors to the contrary, the Ladies Professional Bowler's Tour continues to thrive, adding the $65,000 Music City Country Classic in Hendersonville, Tenn., to its summer tour June 22-26."
