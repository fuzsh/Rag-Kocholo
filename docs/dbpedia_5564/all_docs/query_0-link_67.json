        "text": "AMERICAN actor Will Patton has said \"I always feel good when I'm in Ireland\".\n\nThe South Carolina native, 67, shared his love for the Republic and looked back on his time in Sligo.\n\nWill - who is starring in a new movie called Sweet Thing - said Ireland is at the top of his travel list if he gets time off from work.\n\nThe actor told of how welcome he feels in Ireland and thinks his comfort has something to do with his heritage.\n\nSpeaking with the Irish Sun, Will said: \"I always feel good when I'm in Ireland. I've only been there once but I felt the good the whole time I was there.\n\n\"I just felt like I belonged there. You know when you go some place and you feel, 'It's okay for me to be here, this is a place I feel alright in'.\n\n\"I have some friends in Sligo and I stayed at their place.\n\n\"A lot of my background, if you go back into my blood line is [Irish] so that might have something to do with the comfort.\"\n\nRecounting his trip to Sligo, he continued: \"I drove all the way across [Ireland] but mostly stayed in Sligo and around that general area.\n\n\"All of the ancient ruins everywhere, they're so mysterious and powerful and so beautiful.\n\n\"And I was interested that Inis Fraoigh was such a tiny island, I thought of it as this huge place!\"\n\nHe added: \"I've been thinking about [coming back to Ireland] and if I have time off that's the place I most want to go.\"\n\nAnd despite not following GAA football, Will has high hopes that Mayo will break the curse and bag a win this Saturday.\n\nCommenting on his upcoming movie, Sweet Thing, Will praised the director, Alexandre Rockwell, and his two children, Lana and Nico, who star in the film.\n\nWill plays the role of Lana and Nico's father in the movie and said they all \"became a family pretty quickly\".\n\n'EXTREME SITUATIONS'\n\nThe actor said: \"I had worked with Alex way back...in the early 90s and we kept in touch over the years and been wanting to work together again over the years.\n\n\"Sweet Thing is made with his actual kids, his actual daughter and son and I play their father so I'm basically taking Alex's place in the family!\n\n\"[Alex's work] is almost like homemade movies with this kind of texture in the life inside them.\n\n\"It's kind of like going in to somebody's living room and saying, 'Okay, let's make this dangerous kind of experiment'.\n\n\"I found that me and Lana and Nico, the kids, became a family pretty quickly and also just became really good acting partners, they were some of the best acting partners I've ever had.\n\n\"It just fell into place pretty well and it's pretty extreme situations too so we had to be in an area of trust there.\"\n\nWORKING THROUGH PANDEMIC\n\nComparing Sweet Thing to other movies he's starred in, Will said: \"It's thrilling! And there's a lot of improvisation involved so you're never really sure if you're out on a limb too far so you have to trust the director when you do that. I find that really good directors will allow that.\n\n\"I did this movie... called American Honey and this other one called Minari and there's a similarity just in terms of kind of being in an open place when you're doing the work so that if something maybe goes in a different direction, one feels they can try that even though it might be wrong.\n\n\"And a lot of times the bravery of that is very right.\"\n\nWill continued acting throughout the pandemic but described it as \"going into the front lines of some really scary dangerous in terms of not only the work but are we going to die if we do this now?\"\n\nHe said: \"I had been filming constantly during the pandemic and I've gotten used to it. I was back filming in July 2020 and not many people had been doing it.\n\n\"And never seeing anyone's face except the other actor you're working with while the camera's rolling.\n\n\"I kind of like the masks, I could wear them forever and keep that low profile.\"\n\nSweet Thing debuts this Friday, September 10."
