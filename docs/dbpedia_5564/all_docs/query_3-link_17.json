        "text": "The power resulting from intentionally connecting with colleagues continues to inspire me. My friend and fellow 6453 ALUMNI member, best-selling author, maestro of \"Gettin' it Done\" and purveyor of cool things, Michael Bergmann, shared some valuable time with a team from Tillamook County Creamery Association this week. He reviewed the principles and inspiring stories from his book, Innovation From The Ground Up, with me and my Tillamook colleagues, Liam Wustenberg, David Damiano, Chris Vanausdoll, Steven Asnes, Steven Hallstone, Michael Szydlowski, John Boortz and Doug Zamboni. Michael has documented a simple, practical and applicable methodology to drive innovation and achieve big things with resources that are available to you, your personal network and the combined power of the group's collective network. Check it out. Glad that we did and thanks to Michael for helping our team. https://lnkd.in/gibEw6Y5\n\nTillamook County Creamery Association invests in its people and its great culture. For me, that has translated into the most consistently rewarding workplace I've experienced in my career. Part of Tillamook's investment is this year’s LEAD series, where each month Tillamook will invite external guests who are blazing trails, transforming communities and breaking barriers to meet with our team. Through this interview-style discussion our guests’ stories inspire new strategies, important insights and great conversation, all while building connections to our six Core Competencies and our five Shared Values. Last month, our guest was my friend and former colleague at Nike, Greg Hoffman. Greg delivered on all of the above and more. Typically, these LEAD Series conversations are led by our CEO, but I was fortunate to get the call to represent this time -- honored to introduce the team to Greg and lead the conversation. Hearing from many of my colleagues over the last few weeks about what inspired and moved them from Greg's stories has been fun. Connecting people is a passion of mine, so seeing this happen successfully via this LEAD Series session with Greg is a joy. Some of the stories Greg shared with us can be found in his book, #EmotionByDesign https://lnkd.in/gTUN2_fk which is a worthy read. Be Well! 6453 ALUMNI--check it alums"
