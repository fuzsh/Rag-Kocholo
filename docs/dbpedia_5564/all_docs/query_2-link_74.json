Rowe (PattonAward@mammalsociety.org)\n\nMembers\n\nKayce Bell\n\nJohn R. Demboski\n\nJacob A. Esselstyn\n\nSharon A. Jansa\n\nHayley C. Lanier\n\nHistory and Mission\n\nThe James L. Patton Award was established in 2015 to promote and support museum-based research by graduate student members of ASM. Each year, one $5000 award will be granted to facilitate the direct use of museum specimens, including travel costs to visit collections and associated analytical or equipment costs. The award honors Jim’s commitment to research collections and their use in understanding the diversity and evolution of mammals, his passion for mentoring young mammalogists, and his long-standing service to the society. The James L. Patton Award is a competitive fellowship.\n\nBoth MS and PhD level students are encouraged to apply. We particularly encourage proposals that include the direct inspection of museum collections, including both traditional and/or novel uses of specimens and their associated data. The project description should include mention of broader project objectives and the specific component for which collections use is being requested. Applicants should also describe how their research contributes to the development of natural history collections and their associated data (e.g., field collection, curation, and digitization).\n\n2023 James L. Patton Award Recipient\n\nImage\n\nEdú Guerra is a PhD student in the Biology department at the University of Washington, working under the guidance of Dr. Sharlene Santana. He is a Brazilian mammalogist with a keen interest in exploring the ecological and evolutionary dynamics within a spatial and temporal context. During his undergraduate studies at Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo, he learned from Dr. Yuri Leite and Dr. Leonora Costa the first steps of mammal surveying –from placing traps to storing specimens in drawers– and the importance of museum collections to understand biodiversity. With a Master's degree in Ecology from Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro and previous experience as a Curatorial Assistant, Edú is currently an active member of the Collections Committee of the Brazilian Society of Mammalogists. In his current research, he focuses on using Tamiasciurus douglasii as a model system to investigate the impacts of ongoing climate change on intrapopulation phenotypic variability. This involves visiting museum collections to collect morphological and genomic data from both modern and historical populations. By comparing these data across the geographic distribution of Tamiasciurus douglasii, he aims to elucidate temporal changes and spatial patterns. Additionally, Edú is passionate about teaching and engaging in outreach activities that highlight the value of museum collections.\n\nDonate Now!\n\nYou can donate to the James L.

We encourage all applicants to become long-term, engaged members of the society.\n\nApplication Requirements:\n\nResearch Proposal (two page maximum, 12 pt font, 0.5\" margins, single spaced. Literature Cited may be on a separate page.)\n\nWithin the two-page limit, each proposal must contain a Museum Collections Statement.
