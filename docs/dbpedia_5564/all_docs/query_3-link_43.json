        "text": "In time Patton’s legacy has come to be defined by his controversial and sometimes erratic behaviour almost as much as by his martial prowess. When a pair of mules blocked a bridge during the Sicily offensive in 1943, halting his armoured convoy and making it vulnerable to enemy fire, Patton personally shot the animals and ordered them pushed off the bridge. Two of Patton’s men were tried in connection with the killing of dozens of Italian and German prisoners of war in southern Sicily on July 14, 1943, which came to be known as the Biscari Massacre. Both claimed that they were following orders not to take prisoners that Patton himself had set forth in a fiery speech to their division a month earlier. Patton denied responsibility, and he was exonerated of any crime.\n\nPatton was sharply criticized for a pair of incidents in August 1943, when he physically struck hospitalized soldiers who exhibited no outward signs of injury. On August 3 Patton visited the 15th Evacuation Hospital outside Nicosia, Sicily, where he encountered Pvt. Charles Kuhl, who appeared to be unwounded. When asked what he suffered from, the soldier replied, “I guess I just can’t take it.” Patton cursed at the soldier, berating him as a coward, and then slapped his face with his glove and kicked him out of the tent. Kuhl was later diagnosed with chronic dysentery and malaria. On August 10 Patton repeated the scene at the 93rd Evacuation Hospital near San Stefano, Sicily. Pvt. Paul Bennett had been diagnosed with combat fatigue, and upon seeing Bennett cry, Patton repeatedly slapped him, cursed him, and threatened to either send him to the front lines or have him killed by firing squad. Medical officers and a number of journalists quickly reported the incidents to Eisenhower, who reprimanded Patton by letter and ordered him to apologize to all concerned. Patton grudgingly did so, and Eisenhower, who could ill afford to lose Patton, asked reporters to bury the story for the sake of the war effort. News of the incidents broke in late November 1943, however, causing the uproar that Eisenhower had hoped to avoid. Many in the U.S. Congress and the press called for Patton to be sacked, and the Senate delayed Patton’s promotion to permanent major general. Although Patton kept his job, those incidents likely cost him a command role of ground forces in the Normandy Invasion in June 1944.\n\nHistorians generally agree that Patton was not only one of the greatest military leaders that the United States has ever produced but also one of the most complex and contradictory. Patton believed that it was critical for a general to stand out and to be seen by his troops, a philosophy that conveniently coincided with his ego. He dressed impeccably in a colourful uniform and knee-high boots, sporting ivory-handled pistols. Whether one liked him or loathed him, no one forgot him. He was a devout Christian who prayed morning and night, yet he was liberal with his use of profanity; he was also a staunch believer in reincarnation who was convinced that he had lived many previous lives as a warrior. Although he had many black soldiers under his command—notably, the 761st Tank Battalion, a segregated armoured unit known as the “Black Panthers” that won distinction on the battlefield—he nevertheless saw African Americans as inferior and disparaged their performance in combat. He helped to liberate numerous concentration camps, but he privately made virulently anti-Semitic statements during the occupation of Germany. Whatever demons he struggled with, and likely there were many, Patton possessed a genius for war like few others in history.\n\nAlex Lovelace"
