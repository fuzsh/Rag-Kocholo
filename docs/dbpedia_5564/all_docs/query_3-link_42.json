        "text": "On August 16th I became 77 years young, notice I said became because there was nothing I could but except it. Some of my friends and employees ask me why I was still working. I have loved all the experiences in life, from 20 years in the U.S. Navy, to building and help build companies that helped train our warfighters in all agencies of the Department of Defense. I continue to love what I do, and do not see retirement in my life. I thought I would give everyone a few words on getting older and going into the winter of life. First the Holy Bible tells me growing old is a blessing from the Lord. As I age it brings new dreams, dreams bring expectations, expectations bring new goals to achieve. I have found that as we live longer life teaches many things, it is up to us to learn what life is teaching. Each 10 years of brings new experiences, I have found that wherever you are in life is the perfect age, it's fantastic. I go to bed each night and wake each morning to the miracles of God and say thank you for another day. Another thing I have found in this journey you never stop learning, that way your mind always stays young. Living a long time that is the easy part, it's what you did between the date of birth and the day you depart this earth, thatâ€™s how you will be remembered. As I grew older, it did not matter to me what people said they could do, I watch and see what they do. I do have many memories; you can see then if you look closely, they are in lines in my face. Being older gives one the insight to people, you know what they are before they open their mouth to speak. I said all that to tell you, enjoy your family and friends, laugh a lot, enjoy your life."
