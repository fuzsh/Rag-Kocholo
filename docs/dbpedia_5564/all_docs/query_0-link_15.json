He portrays Wayne Tillerson in the Prime Video neo-western mystery thriller, Outer Range.\n\nBiography[]\n\nThe eldest of three children, Will is the son of Bill Patton, a playwright and acting/directing instructor. He attended the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem and The Actors' Studio in New York City.\n\nPatton is an award-winning actor who first broke out on the scene with a supporting role in the 1979 film Minus Zero. However, he wouldn't land his first major role until 1985, when he appeared as the main antagonist Wayne Nolan in Desperately Seeking Susan. Although, his role in 1987 American neo-noir political action thriller film No Way Out was when he began to receive true recognition. He was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of General Bethlehem in The Postman. From 2001-2003, he portrayed Jackson Haisley in The Agency. He also recurred as Alan Wilson in the 24 series before landing a starring role in the TNT alien drama Colonel Weaver from 2011-2015. Some of his other credits include The Good Wife, Shots Fired, Swamp Thing, Halloween Kills, and Yellowstone.\n\n[]\n\nat the"
