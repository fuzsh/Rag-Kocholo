        "text": "Associate Attorney\n\nElizabeth Patton is licensed to practice law in the state of Tennessee. In 2018, she graduated cum laude in the top ten of her class from Belmont University College of Law. While in law school, she served as the Executive Submissions Editor for the Belmont Law Review and as the Executive Director of the Belmont Legal Aid Society, a student organization providing pro bono legal services. The Tennessee Supreme Court recognized Elizabeth Patton as a “Law Student for Justice” for her pro bono work throughout law school, much of which focused on assisting immigrant and refugee communities.\n\nBefore going to law school, Ms. Patton earned a bachelor’s degree in International Relations and Latin American Studies, summa cum laude. She joins Rose Immigration Law Firm with solid experience in family-based immigration, naturalization, humanitarian cases, and removal defense. Ms. Patton also comes to us with experience in business-based immigration gained while working as an administrative paralegal at Rose Immigration Law Firm. Her practice will continue to include business-based cases, with emphasis on H-1B and PERM labor certification, as well as family and humanitarian, naturalization, and removal work."
