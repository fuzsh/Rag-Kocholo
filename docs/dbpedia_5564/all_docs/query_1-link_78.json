        "text": "Going into the 2024 football season, Nittany Lions Wire will be looking at each scholarship player listed on the Penn State roster. Over the preseason, each profile will cover where the player is from, how recruiting websites rated them coming out of high school, and what role they will play for James Franklin this season.\n\nNext up is a look at a long snapper entering his third season with the program, Will Patton. Patton is an in-state walk-on player for the Nittany Lions, and while his playing time outlook may not be stellar this season, he does bring some in-state pride to the program for 2024. Here is a snapshot look at the backup long-snapper.\n\nPreseason Player Profile\n\nHometown: New Castle, Pa.\n\nHeight: 6-4\n\nWeight: 245\n\nRecruiting Rankings\n\nNo composite ranking information is available.\n\nClass of 2022\n\nClass in 2024: Redshirt sophomore\n\nWill Patton was not exactly on many college football recruiting radars at the FBS level, but Penn State kept tabs on the high school dual-sport athlete. Patton was a two-year starter for Shenango High School on offense and special teams. He was also a track and field standout and a two-time state finalist in the discus throw. He finished second only to J’ven Williams.\n\nCareer Stats\n\nAfter redshirting during the 2022 season, Will Patton did not see any game action in 2023.\n\nDepth Chart Overview\n\nPenn State went with Tyler Duzansky (pictured above) as the team’s primary long snapper in 2023, and that should remain the case once again this fall. Patton would be the most likely alternative on long snapping duty if called upon, however.\n\nMiscellaneous Info.\n\nFollow Patton on X: @will_patton1\n\nFollow Patton on Instagram: @will_patton47"
