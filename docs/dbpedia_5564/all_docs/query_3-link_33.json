        "text": "From day one, Will Patton loved baseball. That was all he knew, a Lincoln Heights boy in the 1950s.\n\n\"My grandpa, he always kept us near some activity. That's what the old guys did. They loved their baseball. During the evenings, he'd turn the little radio on, sitting on the porch. That's what you did. That was the excitement, watching my grandpa sip his little beer and smoke his cigar, listening to the baseball game. And I was thinking, OK, this is what a man is supposed to do. I think I'm getting the idea here. It doesn't look bad.\"\n\nEvery Sunday, Grandpa White would arrive in his Buick Special, pick up young Will, and they would go to see a game â€‘ maybe a semi-pro team coming through town, or a pickup game, or, on a really big occasion, a trip to Crosley Field.\n\nBut mostly, they watched a Little League game, where Will's older brother played catcher. One Sunday, after the game, a knock came at the door.\n\n\"It was a young man, a scout,\" Patton says. \"He said he was a scout for the Cleveland Indians, and he wanted to sign my brother.\"\n\nYoung Will thought, \"Who? For real! I've got their baseball cards!\"\n\nBut his brother turned the scout down. \"He said he wanted to go to college. He didn't like getting his hands dirty. He wanted to go to school. I thought, man, if I had your talent . . . \"\n\nBut Will Patton's talent was in coaching. For years, he's been giving the young sluggers of the West Side Reds lessons, not just in playing as a team but behaving as a family.\n\n\"As long as I see my kids becoming productive citizens, that's all I need,\" says Patton, 66. \"I tell them, you make a good man of yourself, that's one mark you put up there with The Man for me.\""
