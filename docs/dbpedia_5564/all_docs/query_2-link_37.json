Please review these guidelines about when it's appropriate to call the police and which number to call to reach an officer.\n\nWhen to call 9-1-1\n\nWhen you need help or you need immediate police assistance, consider it an emergency. If you need to report a crime, suspicious vehicles or activity, car crash, an injured person or animal, someone in harm's way, or something you have witnessed, contact the police immediately. Don't wait! Give the police the opportunity to apprehend the suspect, gather evidence now, and help when time is critical.\n\nCall 9-1-1 any time of the day or night to be connected with a 9-1-1 communications dispatcher. When it's an emergency, an incident in progress, or something that just happened, 9-1-1 is the number to call to reach a police officer. The Centre County Emergency Communications Center will dispatch an officer to you.\n\nInformation that needs to get to police as soon as possible will be delayed if you send an email, or if you call the Patton Township Police Department administrative offices after hours and leave a message. In an emergency, please do not use email or after-hours phone messages.\n\nWhen in doubt about what qualifies as an emergency, please call 9-1-1.\n\nWhen to Call Administrative Offices\n\nWhen you need information about car safety seat checks or bike safety or have a noise or animal complaint, consider that a non-emergency.\n\nIf you're certain you have non-emergency and just need information, you can call 1-800-479-0050, which will connect you to a police officer in your area. The Patton Township Police Department suggests you add this 800 number to your cell phone contacts.\n\nCall the Police Department to obtain copies of accident reports, records checks, and parking permits.\n\nPlease reserve communication by email for non-emergencies\n\nTo submit an anonymous tip, you can use our form.\n\nTo submit a non-emergency online report, you can use our form.\n\nFor ordinance violations such as grass that needs to be mowed or sidewalks that need to be shoveled, please contact our ordinance officer\n\nIf you have any suggestions for improving police communications, please email or call to let us know how we can help\n\nForms"
