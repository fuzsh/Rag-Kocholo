        "text": "by Ron Gorman, Oberlin Heritage Center volunteer docent\n\nSeven years before the celebrated abolitionist Frederick Douglass first stood before a sympathetic audience of white abolitionists and “trembling in every limb” told them the story of his life as a slave, another ex-slave, James Bradley, stood before an audience of white colonizationists (people who believed freed slaves should be returned to Africa), and skillfully debunked the rationale of colonization and slavery. His presentation was part of a series of academic debates on abolitionism and colonization that would have an important impact on the American abolition movement and dramatically alter the course of Oberlin’s history.\n\nJames Bradley statue – Covington, KY\n\nThe debates were held at the Lane Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, in February, 1834 (see my William T. Allan – Lane Rebel from the South blog post for details). Of the approximately 45 total hours of debate time, James Bradley occupied about two hours, but an argument can be made that they were the two most important hours of the debates. Bradley started by telling his personal story, of being born in Africa, enslaved as a toddler, and brought across the Atlantic Ocean to South Carolina. Although we don’t have a transcript of his exact words at the debates, we do have a published account of his life story, written by him shortly afterwards. Here are some excerpts:\n\nA slaveholder bought me and took me up into Pendleton County, Ky. I suppose I stayed with him about six months. He sold me to a Mr. Bradley, by whose name I have ever since been called. This man was considered a wonderfully kind master and it is true I was treated better than most of the slaves I knew. I never suffered for food and never was flogged with the whip but oh, my soul! I was tormented with kicks and knocks more than I can tell…\n\nI used to work very hard. I was always obliged to be in the field by sunrise and labored until dark, stopping only at noon long enough to eat dinner. When I was about 15 years old, I took what was called the cold plague in consequence of being overworked and I was sick a long time. My master came to see me one day, and hearing me groan with pain, he said, “This fellow will never be of any more use to me. I would as soon knock him in the head, as if he were an opossum.” His children sometimes came in and shook axes and knives at me, as if they were about to knock me on the head…\n\nMy master kept me ignorant of everything he could. I was never told anything about God or my soul. Yet from the time I was 14 years old, I used to think a great deal about freedom. It was my heart’s desire. I could not keep it out of my mind. Many a sleepless night I have spent in tears because I was a slave. I looked back on all I had suffered and when I looked ahead, all was dark and hopeless bondage. My heart ached to feel within me the life of liberty.\n\nAfter the death of my master I began to contrive how I might buy myself. After toiling all day for my mistress, I used to sleep three or four hours and then get up and work for myself the remainder of the night. I made collars for horses out of plaited husks. I could weave one in about eight hours and I generally took time enough from my sleep to make two collars in the course of a week. I sold them for 50 cents each. One summer, I tried to take two or three hours from my sleep every night, but I found that I grew weak and I was obliged to sleep more. With my first money, I bought a pig. The next year I earned for myself about $13 and the next, about $30…\n\nI used to go out with my hoe and dig up little patches which I planted with corn…got up at night to tend it. My hogs were fattened with this corn and I used to sell a number every year. Besides this, I used to raise small patches of tobacco and sell it to buy more corn for my pigs. In this way I worked five years. At the end of which time, after taking out my losses, I found that I had earned $160. With this money I hired my own time for two years. During this period, I worked almost all the time, night and day. The hope of liberty stung my nerves and braced my soul so much that I could do with very little sleep or rest. I could do a great deal more work than I was ever able to do before. At the end of two years, I had earned $300 besides feeding and clothing myself. I now bought my time for 18 months longer and went 250 miles west, nearly into Texas, where I could make more money. Here I earned enough to buy myself, including what I gave for my time, about $700.\n\nAs soon as I was free, I started for a free state. When I arrived in Cincinnati, I heard of Lane Seminary, about two miles out of the city. I had for years been praying to God that my dark mind might see the light of knowledge. I asked for admission to the seminary. They pitied me and granted my request, though I knew nothing of the studies which were required for admission. I am so ignorant that I suppose it will take me two years to get up with the lowest class in the institution. But in all respects I am treated just as kindly and as much like a brother by the students, as if my skin were as white and my education as good as their own…[1]\n\nBradley also told how he secretly taught himself to read and write, against his masters’ wishes (and against the law in most Southern states). After telling his life story, Bradley went on to attack the concepts of slavery and colonization. This was a crucial time in the national abolition movement, when a large number of white Americans, even those who opposed slavery, believed that blacks couldn’t be integrated with whites in large numbers without a detrimental effect on both. This was one of the biggest arguments against abolition and in favor of colonization. At this point in time free blacks comprised less than 3% of the American population. Enslaved blacks, on the other hand, made up more than 34% of the population of the Southern states (and more than 50% of the population of South Carolina and Louisiana). The only knowledge many white Americans had of blacks came through the dehumanizing institution of slavery and the racial stereotypes that were used to rationalize it. In the words of South Carolina’s pro-slavery statesman John C. Calhoun:\n\n“…two races differing so greatly, and in so many respects, cannot possibly exist together in the same country, where their numbers are nearly equal, without the one being subjected to the other. Experience has proved that the existing relation, in which the one is subjected to the other in the slaveholding States, is consistent with the peace and safety of both, with great improvement to the inferior…”[2]\n\nBradley’s mere presence at Lane Seminary, and the energy, ambition and hard work that brought him there, seriously challenged this philosophy. But Bradley had more to say, as described by Lane student Henry B. Stanton:\n\nThis shrewd and intelligent black, cut up these white objections by the roots, and withered and scorched them under the sun of sarcastic argumentation, for nearly an hour, to which the assembly responded in repeated and spontaneous roars of laughter, which were heartily joined in by both Colonizationists and Abolitionists. Do not understand me as saying, that his speech was devoid of argument. No. It contained sound logic, enforced by apt illustrations. I wish the slanderers of negro intellect could have witnessed this unpremeditated effort.\n\nIn response to the common argument that freed slaves would be unable to take care of themselves, Bradley said: “They have to take care of, and support themselves now, and their master, and his family into the bargain; and this being so, it would be strange if they could not provide for themselves, when disencumbered from this load.”[3]\n\nIn response to the common argument that the slaves were content with their position, we know him to have written: “How strange it is that anybody should believe any human being could be a slave and yet be contented. I do not believe there ever was a slave who did not long for liberty. I know very well that slave owners take a great deal of pains to make people in the free states believe that slaves are happy but I know likewise that I was never acquainted with a slave, however well he was treated, who did not long to be free.”[4]\n\nI don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that Bradley’s contribution was critical to the debates. Theodore Weld had the impassioned fervor and unassailable logic; William T. Allan and Huntington Lyman generated sympathy and outrage with their tales of victimization and abuse; but someone needed to attack the pervasive stereotypes and demonstrate that the John C. Calhouns were wrong. Only James Bradley could do that, and by all accounts he did it masterfully.\n\nAfter the debates, Bradley became a manager of the newly formed student anti-slavery society, and when the school tried to squelch the students’ anti-slavery activities, he became one of the “Lane Rebels” who withdrew from the school in protest. When John J. Shipherd came down and invited the rebels to attend Oberlin College instead, Bradley was interested. But there was one hitch. Oberlin College at that time didn’t have a policy to admit black students. So the rebels demanded that such a policy be instated before they would come to Oberlin.\n\nShipherd, being a progressive member of the Western Reserve Anti-Slavery Society, was fine with this demand, but he needed the approval of the students, faculty and trustees of Oberlin College, and he expected he was in for some opposition. He wrote back to Oberlin: “Indeed, if our Board would violate right so as to reject youth of talent and piety because they were black, I should have no heart to labor for the upbuilding of our Seminary, believing that the curse of God would come upon us, as it has upon Lane Seminary, for its unchristian abuse of the poor slave.”[5]\n\nOpposition he expected, and opposition he got. And then some. It was led by none other than his colony co-founder, Philo P. Stewart, who “at once proclaimed Bro. Shipherd Mad!! crazy etc. etc. and that the School was changed into a Negro School.” The Tappan brothers of New York offered generous financial support to the college, and the renowned revivalist minister Charles Finney offered to come to Oberlin and head a new Theological Department, if only the demands of the Lane Rebels were accepted. But this had little or no impact on the opponents. The college and the colony split on the issue and entered into several weeks of heated and sometimes acrimonious debate. Finally, with Shipherd threatening to depart “for another field of labor”, the college trustees voted by a narrow 5-4 margin to accept the demands of the rebels, and Oberlin College became the first college in the country to have a formal policy of race-blind admissions.[6]\n\nWith that the Lane Rebels, James Bradley included, came to Oberlin, as did two other notable African Americans, Charles and Gideon Langston (older brothers of John Mercer Langston). In fact so many students (the vast majority white), came to Oberlin over the next year that Oberlin College was forced to open four branch institutions in 1836 to handle the overflow. One of these was the Sheffield Manual Labor Institute in nearby Sheffield, which stressed agricultural manual labor and preparatory coursework. James Bradley transferred to this branch and attended along with about forty students, including the Langston brothers, James Fitch, Mary Hosford, and Mary Kellogg (future wife of future Oberlin College President James Fairchild).\n\nSheffield Manual Labor Institute at the Burrell Homestead\n\nBut things didn’t go well at Sheffield. Its agricultural experiments failed, and the school and many of its students faced financial difficulties. The crowning blow came when the school applied for a charter from the state of Ohio in 1837, and was told that it would only be granted if the school excluded black students. By this time the presence of James Bradley and the Langston brothers at Oberlin and Sheffield had allayed the community’s fears, with even Philo Stewart taking “his position with the foremost of Abolitionists”, so excluding black students from any Oberlin-affiliated school was unthinkable. (In fact, the Oberlin College campus was already openly harboring escaped slaves.) Consequently the Sheffield institute closed, with a few of the students returning to Oberlin, but most scattering to the wind. Unfortunately James Bradley was among the latter, and we have no record of him after leaving Sheffield.[7]\n\nBut even though we don’t know what happened to James Bradley, he clearly made his mark on Oberlin. His sheer indomitable will propelled him out of “dark and hopeless bondage” and to the Lane Seminary debate platform 7 years before Frederick Douglass, 9 years before Sojourner Truth and William Wells Brown, and 11 years before Lewis Clarke took the national stage. I can’t help but wonder what the results of the Lane debates might have been without him, and what the effect might have been on abolitionism and especially on the history of Oberlin. But I’ll have to leave those questions as food for thought, along with these closing words that James Bradley wrote in his letter to abolitionist Lydia Maria Child:\n\n“God preserve you, and strengthen you in this holy cause, until the walls of prejudice are broken down, the chains burst in pieces, and men of every color meet at the feet of Jesus, speaking kind words, and looking upon each other in love – willing to live together on earth, as they hope to live in Heaven!” – James Bradley\n\nSources consulted:\n\nLydia Maria Child, The Oasis\n\nHenry B.

But these weren’t Confederate rebels, they were Southern abolitionists, at a time when “abolitionist” was a dirty word even in the North. They were also students of a theological seminary in Cincinnati – a college that tried to stop them from spreading their anti-slavery message and from doing good deeds among the African-American population of that city. But these students wouldn’t be shut down. Instead they left that school in protest. And they came to Oberlin, along with about two dozen of their anti-slavery brothers, in just the second year of the Oberlin colony, and put this town and college on an entirely new course that its founders couldn’t have envisioned just two years earlier. One of these Southern rebels was the son of a respected Southern slaveholder. The other was a native African who himself had been enslaved.\n\nThe slaveholder’s son was William T. Allan. He was born in Tennessee in 1810, and moved with his family to Huntsville, Alabama about a decade later. His father, John Allan, was pastor of Huntsville’s First Presbyterian Church. John Allan owned two families of 15 slaves, who William would later say were “almost as kindly treated as slaves can be, yet they pant for liberty”. [1] But even though he owned slaves, John Allan was opposed to slavery. He was not an abolitionist, but a “colonizationist”, believing in the gradual emancipation of the slaves and their colonization back to Africa. He was a co-founder of Alabama’s Society for the Emancipation of Slavery and the Madison County Colonization Society.\n\nFor a month in 1832, the Allan family had a houseguest – a young reformer from Connecticut named Theodore Weld. Weld was on a mission from Lewis Tappan, a wealthy New York philanthropist, to travel the country and determine what kind of interest there might be for a new type of college that Lewis and his brother were interested in supporting, called a “manual labor institution”. The idea was that students would engage in manual labor to help pay their way through college, both as a benefit to the college and as moral discipline for themselves. To enhance the moral discipline, the school would teach and emphasize moral values and religious purity. As a secondary goal, Weld was to evaluate existing manual labor institutes that might be worthy of support from the Tappan brothers.\n\nTheodore Dwight Weld\n\nWeld did find such an institute, the Lane Seminary in Cincinnati, and he spoke about it to interested young men who he met in his travels, like William T. Allan (who would become a lifelong friend) and his brother James. Weld, the Allans, and several more of these young men enrolled in the Lane Seminary and arrived there in 1833 to begin their studies.\n\nDuring the course of his nationwide tour, Weld became zealously committed to the abolitionist cause – believing that slavery was a sin and should be abolished immediately, without colonization. [2] Once his original mission was complete, he embarked on a new, personal mission to abolitionize the students of the Lane Seminary. His first target was William Allan. William was a colonizationist, like his father and like most of the Lane recruits. But it didn’t take much effort for Weld to convert him into a full-fledged abolitionist.\n\nWith that, Allan became an ally of Weld, spreading the abolition message through the Lane student body. Soon they had enough converts that they felt comfortable challenging the colonizationists to a series of debates. The debates would cover 18 evenings, at two and a half hours each. Seventeen students eagerly participated in the debates, many of them recruits who Weld had met during his travels, and most of whom had first-hand experience with slavery in the South, like James A. Thome, the son of a wealthy Kentucky slaveholder, and Huntington Lyman, a Connecticut native who had spent several years in Louisiana.\n\nThe debates were held in February, 1834. Weld, a very powerful and persuasive orator, was the keynote speaker. He spoke for two nights, followed by two nights of group discussion and debate. This was followed by four nights of first-hand testimony about slavery. This was probably the most powerful part of the debates, and William Allan led it off. Here’s part of what he had to say:\n\nWhat is slavery? Before we can prescribe a remedy, we must understand the disease. We must know what we are attempting to cure, before we give the medicine…\n\nAt our house it is so common to hear their screams from a neighbouring plantation, that we think nothing of it. The overseer of this plantation told me one day, he laid a young woman over a log, and beat her so severely that she was soon after delivered of a dead child. A bricklayer, a neighbor of ours, owned a very smart young negro man, who ran away, but was caught. When his master got him home, he stripped him naked, tied him up by his hands, in plain sight and hearing of the academy and the public green, so high that his feet could not touch the ground ; then tied them together, and put a long board between his legs, to keep him steady. After preparing him in this way, he took a paddle, bored it full of holes, and commenced beating him with it. He continued it leisurely all day. At night his flesh was literally pounded to a jelly. It was two weeks before he was able to walk. No one took any notice of it; no one thought any wrong was done…\n\nAnd lest any one should think that in general the slaves are well treated, and these are the exceptions, let me be distinctly understood — Cruelty is the rule, and kindness the exception.[3]\n\nOne audience member remarked later, “I was rejoiced to hear such a beginning from the son of a slave-holder; for I had longed to learn the true condition of the slave.” Several other students also gave first-hand accounts of slavery, including James Thome and Huntington Lyman. The abolitionism portion of the debates ended on the ninth evening with a vote being taken on the following question: “Ought the people of the slaveholding states to abolish slavery immediately?” The answer was a unanimous Yes (although a few students who hadn’t made up their minds abstained from voting).\n\nThe students then entered into nine evenings of debate about the colonization issue, which included readings from extensive reports, addresses and repositories of the American Colonization Society. According to student Henry B. Stanton, just reading the colonization society’s own promotional material was enough to change many attitudes:\n\nMost of the Colonizationists who expressed any opinion on the subject, declared their ignorance of the doctrines and measures of the Society until this debate. They cannot find words to express their astonishment that they should have been so duped into the support of this Society, as a scheme of benevolence towards the free blacks, and a remedy for slavery. They now repudiate it with all their hearts.[4]\n\nAnd thus when a vote was taken on the final night of the debates concerning the colonization issue, only one student voted in favor of colonization, with all the others opposed (except a handful of abstainers, as before). The debates inspired the students to start their own anti-slavery society, with William Allan as President. Many of the students also started distributing abolitionist literature and going out into the Cincinnati African American community to teach and minister to the large population of ex-slaves there. Said Henry Stanton, “Almost all of our southern brethren are engaged in colored Sabbath schools and Bible classes. Some of them have devoted their lives in doing good to that oppressed race.”\n\nBut racism, which was prevalent in Ohio at that time (especially in Cincinnati, situated right across the Ohio River from the slave state of Kentucky), reared its ugly head. The students met with much abuse and condemnation from white residents, and the Lane Seminary itself came under fire from the local community and its supporters, many of whom were slaveholders or conducted business with slaveholders. The school was even threatened with mob violence. The trustees of Lane Seminary asked the students to desist from their activities, but a committee of students, chaired by William Allan, stood firm. Finally the trustees came down hard on the students, banning any further anti-slavery discussion or activities, firing a professor, and recommending expulsion procedures against Weld and William Allan. As a result, several dozen students quit the school in protest, becoming known as the “Lane Rebels”.\n\nWhen news reached Huntsville, Alabama that the Allan boys had left Lane, their father was not happy, and their neighbors were incensed when they learned of their abolitionist activities. Said William, “They blow away against abolitionists down there at a terrible rate – say they’ll cut my throat, that I’m afraid to come home, etc.”[5] However, one of Allan’s Huntsville neighbors, James Birney, a wealthy slaveholder who had co-founded the local emancipation and colonization societies with John Allan, was so moved by the Lane debates that he emancipated all of his slaves and became an outspoken abolitionist.\n\nThe news of what happened at Lane also sent shockwaves through colleges throughout the North. Many institutions suddenly became aware of student anti-slavery societies on their own campuses and shut them down, in hopes of staving off a similar disaster. One college, however, had the opposite reaction. John J. Shipherd, a member of the Western Reserve Anti-Slavery Society and the co-founder of a newly formed manual labor institution called the Oberlin Collegiate Institute (now Oberlin College), went down to Cincinnati to visit the Lane Rebels and invite them to Oberlin, promising that their philanthropic and anti-slavery activities wouldn’t be squelched there. After a complex set of negotiations (which I’ll describe in more detail in my next blog post), about two dozen of the Rebels agreed to come to Oberlin and enroll in the newly formed Theological Department, headed by the renowned revivalist minister, Charles G. Finney, with generous financial support from the Tappan brothers. William Allan said of the plan, “This Oberlin plan, however, has opened up a new train… That, with me, will be putting on the capstone–I shall have passed the rubicon if I should go to an institution where abolition is concentrated–at the head of which is that arch-heretic Finney.”[6] James Thome and Huntington Lyman joined Allan in heading to Oberlin. Theodore Weld enthusiastically supported the move, but did not join in himself. Flushed with his success at abolitionizing first William Allan and then the Lane Seminary, he instead took off on a remarkable speaking campaign across the state that would “fast abolitionize Ohio” and create dozens of new local anti-slavery societies.\n\nWhen the Lane Rebels came to Oberlin in early 1835, abolitionist students who had been silenced by other colleges in the North followed suit. Thus the fledgling colony of Oberlin became a major national center of abolitionism virtually overnight. This was encouraged by Weld, who arrived in Oberlin in late 1835 and gave rousing anti-slavery lectures for 21 nights. According to student James Fairchild (future Professor and College President), Weld spoke with such “fervid eloquence” that “Oberlin was abolitionized in every thought and feeling and purpose.” The college leadership remained true to their word of allowing unrestricted free speech, although Reverend Finney did attempt to temper the enthusiasm, believing the students should devote their time to general moral reform and revivalism, which he felt would ultimately lead not only to the abolition of slavery, but of all earthly sin. In 1836 Allan wrote to Weld, “Bro. Finney has used his heart & head & influence to convince us that it is our duty to preach. He groans over the subject & speaks of himself as being agonized about it. Thus we are situated–you and Stanton groaning on one side & Finney on the other.”[7]\n\nBut it was the groans of Weld and Stanton that persuaded Allan. He and fellow rebels James Thome, Huntington Lyman, John Alvord, and Sereno Streeter became lecturing “agents” of the American Anti-Slavery Society, numbering among “The Seventy” apostles of aboltionism who were selected to be trained by Weld to travel all over the North, endure peltings with rotten eggs, stones and bricks, and convert thousands to the cause. (Allan and Thome had already become members of the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society at its charter meeting in Zanesville in April, 1835.)\n\nWilliam Allan graduated from Oberlin college in 1836 and began a long and active anti-slavery career. He preached and lectured against slavery in Ohio, New York, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois, finally settling in the latter and becoming an agent of the Illinois Anti-Slavery Society. In 1839 Theodore Weld published a testimonial from William Allan in his book about the horrors of slavery. In the 1840s Allan became an organizer of the Illinois and Iowa chapters of the first national anti-slavery political party, the Liberty Party, which nominated his ex-Huntsville neighbor, James Birney, for President of the United States. When William’s mother became mortally ill in 1841, his father advised him not to return home, as local sentiment was so strong against him that he feared for his safety. John Allan himself died in 1843, freeing his slaves in his will. William remained in Illinois and helped free slaves himself, his home becoming a sanctuary on the Underground Railroad. He died in Illinois in 1882 after a long, distinguished and honorable public career.\n\nAllan family tomb in Illinois. (Unfortunately this is the closest we have to a picture of William T. Allan)\n\n(By the way, if you’re wondering why I haven’t made any mention since the first paragraph of the ex-slave rebel who came to Oberlin, it’s because I’ll be telling his story in detail in my next blog post.
