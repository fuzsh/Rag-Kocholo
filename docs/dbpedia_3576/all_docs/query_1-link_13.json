        "text": "THE FIRST PURITAN SETTLERS OF WINDSOR. (cont.)\n\nNash, Joseph constable of Hartford, 1660. Timothy admitted an inhabitant of Hartford, 1659. John was an assistant in 1662. The name was frequent in Massachusetts in the early settlement. Thomas, Fairfield.\n\nNewbury, Thomas married Ann Fordsupposed to be the son of Joseph.\n\nNewbury, Joseph, (Mr. McClure says) came to Windsor in 1639. He was the ancestor of Gen. Newbury, formerly of Windsor. He was an early settler and a respectable family.\n\nNewbury, Benjamin married Mary Allyn, of Windsor, 1616 son of Joseph.\n\nNewton, Rev. Roger the first minister in Farmington about 1642, after about 9 years he moved to Milford, where he was installed. Rev. Samuel Hooker, son of Rev. Thomas Hooker succeeded him, and preached at Farmington about 40 years. He married the daughter of Rev. Thomas Hooker, of Hartford. He was installed at Milford in '60, and died in '83.\n\nNewton, Thomas elected deputy of Fairfield in 1644.\n\nNewton, Benjamin Haddam, 1673.\n\nNewman, Robert 1656. There were several of this name in Massachusetts in the early settlement of that colony. Antipas Newman married the daughter of Gov. Winthrop, of Massachusetts.\n\nNichols, Isaac Fairfield, 1653deputy in '62supposed to be from Stratford.\n\nNichols, John do. do.\n\nNichols a sergeant, ordered to train the men at Hartford in 1639. Supposed to be Siborn Nichols.\n\nNiccolls, Siborn juror in 1661appraiser of Dix's estate in '76. Ancestor of Cyprian Nichols, of Hartford. The name of Nichols is spelt differently by those of the same original ancestor. He settled an estate also, in 1670. Cyprian, of Hartford, juror in 1701. Cyprian has been a family name. There were many of the name of Nichols came to Massachusetts in the early settlement of that colony.\n\nNorthum, James 1644. Signed the agreement in '59 to remove to Hadley. He moved and died there; and the name is yet at Williamstown and other towns in Massachusetts, and one family at Hartford.\n\nNorton, Capt. in 1634, was barbarously murdered with Stone and others of his crew, by the Indians on Connecticut River. (See John Endicott in No. 1.)\n\nNorton, Francis Hartford, 1639juror in '44fined £5 for a libel in '43. His ancestor was the agent of Capt. Mason.\n\nNorton, John made free in 1663.\n\nNorton, James 1640.\n\nNorton, Thomas 1647. The name is not numerous in the State at this time. John, a juror in '71.\n\nNorth, Sarah apphed to the General Court to be divorced from her husband. The Court decided, that if she did not hear from her husband within seven years, she should be divorced, (six years having then expired.) It appears from this case, that seven years unheard of, has been a cause for divorce in Connecticut from its early settlement by the Puritans.\n\nNott, John Wethersfieldon the jury in 1640, deputy in '62-3. Some distinguished men from this ancestor.\n\nNowell, Thomas Windsordied in 1648, and left a widow without children. He was a kinsman of Robert Wilson and Tabbe Phelps. He left an estate of £368. He came from Yorkshire.\n\nNoyes, Nicholas clergyman at Haddam as late as 1684.\n\nNoyes, Richard Haddam, 1674-76.\n\nNoyes, Rev.

He was the first minister in Lymelived to be aged, and preached there over 50 years.\n\nOldham, John In 1633 he resided in Dorchester, and came to Connecticut the same year, through the wilderness with three others, to trade for beaver with the Indians. The Indians on the Connecticut River made him most welcome, and gave him some beaver skins. He traded with them for hemp, which spontaneously grew on the low lands of Connecticut. Mr. Oldham was afterwards killed by the Indians near Block Island, and his estate was settled in the Connecticut colony. He had with him when killed, two boys and two Indiansthese the murderers took with them. Capt. Gallup afterwards found Oldham on board of his vessel, (filled with Indians) with his head split and his body badly mangled. Capt. Gallup put the body into the seastripped the vessel of her riggingand took from her what the Indians had left, and then took Oldham's vessel in tow, but night coming on with a high wind, he let her adrift, and she was lost.\n\nOlcott, Thomas 1640, constable of Hartforddied in '54left a widow Abigail who died in '93. The children were, Thomas, Samuel, John, Elizabeth and Hannah. Thomas was the only one of the name who came to Connecticut in the first settlement. The biography of this family has been traced by N. Goodwin, Esq. from Thomas to the present descendants.\n\nOlcott, Samuel Hartford, 1676, son of Thomas.\n\nOldage, Richard came to Windsor with Mr. Huet in 1639.\n\nOlcoke, Thomas 1639, 1643.\n\nOlmsted, James Hartford, came into the colony as early as 1639. He resided at Cambridge in 1632, and was a constable and freeman there. He died in 1640 or '41. His children were, Nicholas and Nehemiah. Nicholas married Miss Loomis, of Windsor. He had a cousin Rebecca OlmstedRichard was also a kinsman as well as John. He left a large estate, and gave in his will £50 to the church in Hartford. The family, some of them, particularly Nicholas, must have come to Hartford as early as 1636.\n\nOlmsted, Richard Hartford, 1640constable in '46fence viewer in '49deputy in '62-3. He moved to Norwalk, and was made a military officer. In 1661, he with John Banks and Joseph Judson were appointed by the General Court to run the town lines between Fairfield and Stratford. He and Nathaniel Ely were two of the first and principal settlers of Norwalk. And though Norwalk had been purchased some years previous and some few famihes had settled there; yet in 1650, Mr. Olmsted and Nathaniel Ely petitioned the General Court for a settlement of itthe Court so ordered, and called the town Norwalk, afterwards gave them town privileges. He was a leading man in that section of the colony.\n\nOlmsted, Nicholas Hartford, 1639surveyor of roads in '46a soldier at Mystic against the Pequotts in 1637, and son of James. In 1673 Leut. Nicholas Olmsted with Capt. B. Newbury and John Wadsworth, Ensign, were appointed, if any forces were sent out of Hartford county for the rehef of other counties, in case of a war with the Dutch, to command such forces so sent.

Pantry to set off the meadow fences, and order the proportions between proprietors.\n\nOrton, Thomas Windsor, married Margaret Pell at Windsor, 1641, was a juror in '63-4--perhaps a son of Thomas, of Charlestown, Ms., 1642.\n\nOsborn, Richard Fairfield, 1653. There was a Richard Osborn at Hingham in '35perhaps the same. The name was early at E. Hampton, L.I.\n\nOsborn, John 1643, married Ann Oldage, of Windsor, '45. He probably was the son of John of Weymouth.\n\nOsborn, James died in 1676. His children were, James, Sarah, Samuel, Elizabeth, Arnold and Mary Brace.\n\nOrvis, George died in 1664.\n\nOwen, John married Rebecca Wade, of Windsor, 1650. John Owen came to New Haven in 1641 or '42. Rev. John resided at Groton. The family came first to Massachusetts. John Owen had children, Josiah, John (died,) John, Nathaniel, Daniel, Joseph, Mary, Benjamin, Rebecca, Obadiah and IsaacJosiah married Mary Osborn. Josiah in Simsbury, 1682. Hon. Daniel, of Rhode Island, Leutenant Governor.\n\nPatrick, Daniel and Robert Feaks first purchased Greenwich, as agents of the New Haven Company; and by the management of the Dutch Governor of New Netherlands, and other causes, the first settlers placed themselves under the government of the Dutch, and received their incorporation as a town of Peter Stuyvesant, the Governor of New Netherlands. In the Indian war with the Dutch, the settlers were driven from their homes, and did little more towards settling Greenwich until they were taken under the protection of the government of Connecticut after they had obtained the Charter.\n\nPacker, John New London, 1664.\n\nPacket, John 1665.\n\nPalmes 1663.\n\nPanton, Richard made free in 1663.\n\nParker, William Hartford, an original proprietor in 1639supposed moved to Saybrook or New London.\n\nParkman, Elias owned a vessel in the colony in 1637. He came from Dorchester to Windsor in '35 or '36.\n\nParsons, Thomas married Lydia Brown, of Windsor, 1641. There have been some men of distinction in Massachusetts and Connecticut by this name.\n\nParsons, Ebenezer Windsor, 1676. Joseph and William of Simsbury in 1682.\n\nPark or Parks, Robert a juror in 1641-2-3, and a grand juror in '43deputy in '41.\n\nParks, Thomas 1649probably a son of Robert.\n\nPantry, William Hartford, 1639. In land division in '39 juror '42-'44 and juror in -43viewer of chimneys in '49townsman in '45constable in '48to set off meadow fence and proportion between proprietors in '43. He was from Cambridge, possibly the same William who was at Cambridge and admitted freeman there in 1635.\n\nPatrigg, William Hartford, (so spelt by himself,) was one who signed the agreement to move to Hadley in 1659.\n\nPatrick, Capt. who commanded a company of men at the Mystic Fort, in 1637. After the close of the action, he started with 40 men, in company with Major Mason, with 20 men for Saybrook, through the woods, a distance of about twenty miles, while Capt. Underhill went by water and took with him the Indian prisoners and the men who had been wounded in the action. This took place upon the 27th of May, 1637, which was on Saturday. The Sabbath was spent at the Fort with Leut. Gardner, who treated them with the kindness they so richly merited.\n\nPalmer, Edward Hartford, 1645. The name of Edward has been a family name in Massachusetts in the Palmer family. The name is common in the centre and eastern part of Connecticut.\n\nPalmer, Nicholas went to Windsor in 1639 with Mr. Huetand is found in the colony in '61.\n\nPalmer, Henry 1648.\n\nPalmer, Walter 1658.\n\nPalmer, William juror in 1642made free, '60.\n\nPatridge, John 1656.\n\nPatridge or Partridge, William 1656, was an important man in the early settlement of Fairfield county. William Partridge is found a chimney viewer at Hartford in '59perhaps the same.\n\nPayne, John Hartford, 1639, constable. No man in Connecticut held the office of constable as early as 1639, unless he was a man of high standing in his town. They were the principal directors of town affairs. A constable was the first officer appointed by the General Court in forming a new town a kind of confidential adviser of the General Court in town matters.\n\nPayne, M. 1664.\n\nPeck, Deac. Paul Hartford, 1639held some offices in the colony, and was an early settler, and resided in Hartford. Richard Peck and his wife Margery and family, came to New England in the Defence, of London. Paul Peck was of great use in the town and colony in its early settlement. Some of the family moved to Milford.\n\nPeck, Joseph moved to Saybrook.\n\nPearce, John Hartford, 1639.\n\nPerkins, William had liberty of the Court at Boston, with William Sergeant, Thomas Hardy, Thomas Mowlet, Robert Coles, and five others, under John Winthrop, jr., to plant at Agawam, about 1632 (Ipswich.)\n\nPerkins, John 1646, came from Massachusetts. There was a John Perkins who came to Massachusetts in '31two other John Perkins' were admitted freemen there as early as '33 and '37. John Perkins, (spelt on the record Purkis) had 6 acres of land in the division of the up-land east of the river.\n\nPette, John first found upon the land record in Windsor, 1666probably son of John of Springfield.\n\nPete, and Alexander Knowles appointed assistants, Fairfield, 1661.\n\nPeters, Rev. Thomas came to Saybrook with Mr. Fenwick, and was the first minister there. There had been but a few settlers there previous to the arrival of Mr. Fenwick, and those who came with him, except the officers and men of the fort. It had been little more than a military post. Many of the inhabitants of the three old towns, after 1644, moved to Saybrook and cultivated farms. It had progressed slowly as a settlement until the colony purchased the fort and lands upon the river in 1644. Upon the settlement of Norwich many of the principal men of Saybrook, with Mr. Fitch, the minister, moved to Norwich, viz. Major Mason. Thomas Tracy, and others.\n\nPell, Thomas New London county, was made free, 1662. It was ordered, that those who wished to be freemen should present themselves in person, with a certificate under the hands of a majority of the townsmen where they resided, that they were persons of civil, peaceable and honest conversation, and of the age of 21 years, and had £20 estate, exclusive of the poll, in the list. With such certificate and the approbation of the General Court, they could be made free. A Doctor Pell, supposed to be Thomas or his father, who resided at the fort as physician under Leut. Gardner, went with Major Mason as surgeon for the little army to meet the Pequotts in the battle in 1637but proved himself cowardly by remaining on board the vessel, instead of going up to the battle to the rehef of the wounded. Probably the same Thomas Pell who came to Massachusetts in the Hopewell.\n\nPenfield, William Middletown, 1663.\n\nPerry, Richard Fairfield, 1649.\n\nPerry, Francis 1663.\n\nPettibone, John is first found on the records of lands in Windsor, 1666. The family probably settled in what is now Simsbury, on first coming to Windsor. John, of Simsbury, '82. Samuel, do. 1730. Owen, do. 1846.\n\nPettibone, John Simsbury, married Sarah Egglestone in 1664his children were, John, Sarah and Stephen.\n\nPepper, William was brought before the court for an offence. He confessed he had committed several robberies in 1661. Had broken prison and was punished for it in May, 1661. In 1663 committed several robberies on Long Island and Shelter Island, and tried for it at Southhold, and was banished and sold in Barbadoes for three years as a servant.\n\nPhelps, William, Esq. Windsor, came with Mr. Warham's church to Windsor, in 1635. He married before he came from England, and had four children before he moved to Windsor, viz. William, Samuel, Nathaniel and JosephTimothy was born at Windsor in 1639, and Mary in 1644the latter married Thomas Barber. He was a member of the first Court held in the colony in 1636, to try Henry Stiles; he was also a member of the Court of Magistrates in 1637, which declared war against the Pequotts; also in 1633 and '39, 1640-1-2-3, was an assistant (in the Upper House). He was foreman of the first grand jury in 1643, that attended the General Courtand deputy in 1646. He aided in enacting the first law in the colony, in 1639, after the compact of the towns on Connecticut River, and was afterwards an assistant to the Governor in the General Assembly. He was a member of the General Court for twelve sessions. He was one of a Committee to consult the Elders, and form a law against lyingwas a Committee with Haynes, Hopkins and Welles to form criminal laws for the colonyto treat with George Fenwick for liberty to make salt on the Long Island Soundand was on the war Committee against the Quinnipiac Indians. Mr. Phelps was one of the most efficient and valuable officers in the colonyhis whole time must have been occupied in the service of the public. He was a brother of George and Samuel Phelps. Mr. Phelps, with Roger Ludlow, Henry Wolcott, Mr. Warham, John Mason, Thomas Lord, and Matthew Allyn were some of the leading men of Windsor and in the colony-for many years.\n\nPhelps, George came to Windsor with Mr. Warham in 1636 brother of William and Samuel Phelps. From William, George and Samuelthe three brothers, who settled at Windsor, came the Phelps's of Connecticut. William was a magistrate in 1636. George married Miss Randall, daughter Of Philipshe died in 1648children, Isaac, Abraham and Josephby a second wife, Jacob, John and Nathaniel, and died at Westfield, 1678.\n\nPhelps, Samuel brother of William and George Phelpscame to Windsor in the early part of the settlement, and died in 1669. Left children, Samuel, 17 years old, Sarah 15, Timothy 13, Mary 11, William 9, John 7, Ephraim 6, Abigail 3, and Josiah 2. William Thrall appraised his estate. The Phelps's brothers came from DorchesterGeorge went there in 1630.\n\nPhillips, William Hartford, viewer of chimneys and ladders in 1643appointed to designate the location of a fence at Podunk the same rear--selectman in '45.\n\nPhillips, Ann died in 1669 without issue. She was a sister of John Rogers, of Englandmoved to Hadley before the death of her husband, and owned land in Hartford at her decease.\n\nPhillips, George Windsor, settled in 1639.\n\nPhiax of Pequott, 1649.\n\nPhysic, Thomas 1649.\n\nPierson, Rev. Abraham was the first clergyman settled at Branford. He united with Davenport in opposing the union of the two colonies in 1665 with great inflexibility. He was rigid to excess in church communion, and disapproved of the liberality of the clergy in the Connecticut colony in this respect; he differed with them upon the ordinance of infant baptism, Sze., as no person in the New Haven colony could be made a freeman unless he was in full communion with the church. He fully agreed with Davenport and some others in that colony, that no other government than that of the church should be maintained in the colony, and opposed any union with Connecticut for the reason that a good character and an orderly walk, with £30 estate, or had held office in the colony, was all that was required to make a man a freeman in the colony of Connecticut, which would mar the order and purity of the churches. And he unquestionably feared it might weaken the power of the clergy, who had possessed the entire control of the government over the people of the colony of New Haven. Indeed Mr. Pierson was so much dissatisfied, and most of his church and congregation united with him, (Dr. Trumbull says) that they soon left Branford and removed to Newark, N.J., and carried with them, not only the records of the church but the town records also. After it had been settled about 25 years, he left the place nearly destitute of inhabitants; and Branford was not resettled until about 20 years after Mr. Pierson left it. Some of his descendants are now of the best famihes in New Haven and Hartford. He was from Yorkshire, England, and came to Boston and was there a member of the churchhe went from thence to South Hampton, L.I., as their minister, and from thence he removed with a part of his church to Branford, and for the cause before related, he with his church removed to Newark, where many of his descendants now reside. (He is noticed in this work because South Hampton had been under the government of Connecticut.)\n\nPierson, John Middletown, died in 1677, and left one son.\n\nPierce, Edward Wethersfield, 1640. There are many of this name in different parts of Connecticut, viz. Southbury, Cornwall, Bristol, and Litchfield. Edward and John came from Watertown, Mass.\n\nPierce, John 1639ancestor of Rev. George Pierce, President of Hudson College, Ohioof the Hon. John Pierce, of Southbury, former Senator of Connecticut, brother of George.\n\nPiddell, Corbit 1649.\n\nPicket, John Wethersfield, 1660.\n\nPinkney, Philip Fairfield, 1654.\n\nPinson, Andrew 1669.\n\nPinney, Humphrey was one of the first settlers at Windsor in 1639. He was a juror in 1645. He was from Dorchester in Massachusetts, and was probably the ancestor of the few persons of the name now in Connecticut. One of the sons moved east of the river, the remainder of the family continued on the west side. He was the ancestor of Judge Pinney, of Ellington, and of Sidney, of Hartford. He married Mary Hall in Dorchester. His children were, Samuel, Nathaniel, Mary, Sarah, John, Abigail and Isaac.\n\nPinney, Nathaniel son of Humphrey, died at Windsor, 1676left children, Nathaniel and Sarah.\n\nPin, Richard 1656.\n\nPiper of Haddam in 1676.\n\nPiser of Saybrook, 1669.\n\nPlant, John was in the colony in 1639. It appears he did not remain at Hartfordprobably went to Fairfield county, it being about the time Stratford was settled. The name is now at Stratford, in the person of the Hon. David Plant, former member of Congress and Leut. Governor of Connecticut.\n\nPlumb, Joseph Wethersfield, came there in 1636, and was a member of the Court in '37, also in '38 and '41. He was fined £10 for signing a paper against Rev. Mr. Smith. He aided in settling Oldham's estate in '36-7was often a juror and member of the General Court as magistrate and deputy.\n\nPlumb, John 1639perhaps son of Joseph.\n\nPlummer of Wethersfield, 1638probably the ancestor of the Hon. George Plummer, of Glastenbury, which once was a part of Wethersfield. The name is sometimes spelt Plumer. Francis Plummer came from Wales to New England in '63, and settled at Newbury.Farm.\n\nPitkin, William was early in the colony. He was a lawyer by profession, and often appeared in defence of criminals. He was the first attorney general appointed for the colony in 1662and the first that induced the court to suffer a change of pleadings upon a change of jurisdiction, on an appeal to a higher court. He for a time was Treasurer of the colony. William Pitkin' Governor from 1766 to 1770Deputy Governor from 1754 to 1766. He was often deputy and a magistrate. Either the first William must have had a son William, who was sent by Connecticut., in 1693, to Governor Fletcher of New York, respecting the militia of the colony, or he was aged when he performed the service. It has been a respectable family from Mr. Pitkin the first to the present period. As he was the first and only person of the name who came early into Connecticut, he undoubtedly was the ancestor of William who was Governor and Deputy Governor of Connecticut for 15 years; also of Rev. Timothy, minister at Farmington, and Timothy, LL. D., formerly member of Congress. The first William settled at Hartford. He taught school at Hartford from October to April, 1662, for £5probably was poor when he began life. Pomeroy, Eltwed or Edward, Windsor, had his horse killed by the Indians in 1637. His sons in 1640 were, Caleb, Eldad, Joseph, and Joshua. Caleb married Hepzibah Baker, and moved to Northampton. He was the ancestor of a respectable family in Hartford, and of Ralph Pomeroy of the Revolution. He was the only one of the name that came into the colony in the early settlement. The public remunerated him in part for his horse killed by the Indians in the early settlement of Windsor, but not until 1660. He then received £10 in wampum at 6 a penny.\n\nPond, Nathaniel Windsor, died in 1675. Thomas Pond and Wm. Reeve came from England in the Elizabeth and Ann to N. England. Porter, John, Windsor, came in the first settlement of the town juror in 1641grand juror in 1643recorder in 1640constable in 1639-40. He was ordered by the Court to keep Starks with locks and chains, and to hard labor and coarse fare until called for. He was an important man in the colony. He died at Windsor, 1618, and left a large estate to his children, viz. John, James, Samuel, Nathaniel, Rebecca, Rose, Mary, Anna and Joseph. To Joseph he gave 20 shillings. He was the ancestor of several of the name in Hartford.\n\nPost, John and Thomas made free in 1663.\n\nPorter, Joshua a juror in 1641.\n\nPorter, Daniel received his salary as physician out of the public treasury in 1661was in the colony in '44.\n\nPorter, Jonathan 1639. Hezekiah, 1645.\n\nPorter, Samuel signed the agreement to move to Hadley in 1659. He was the son of John.\n\nPorwidge or Periwydge, William 1644.\n\nPost, Stephen Hartford, 1639constable in '41was in the division of lands in Hartford in '39. Some of the family moved down the River.\n\nPratt, John Hartford, 1639townsman in '41constable in '44deputy in '39 in April and Augustmember of the first grand jury in '43juror in '42; he was a juror, deputy and a magistrate, and was an important man in the colony. He came here amongst the first settlers of Hartford.\n\nPratt, William Hartford, one of the first settlers, as early as 1639. There are many of the name in the county of Hartford. He moved to Saybrook, and was made a Leutenant there in 1661he became a prominent man there.\n\nPratt, Abraham came early into the colony.\n\nPratt, Thomas juror in 1643.\n\nPresson, Edward 1643.\n\nPreston, William probably was an officer, as he was ordered by the court in 1642, to take into his custody, James Hullet, Thomas Gilbert, George Gibbs and Lydia Bliss, and keep them in gins, with coarse diet, hard work and sharp correction. A William Preston came from England in the ship Truelove, James Gibbs, masterthis may be the same William Preston. John Preston came with him.\n\nPrentice, John N. London, fined £5 for notching a colt's tail, 1664.\n\nPrice, William 1636probably a brother of John who married a daughter of Henry Wolcott, Esq. of Windsor.\n\nPrior, Humphrey 1646.\n\nProvost, David 1647.\n\nPrudden, Rev. Peter had charge of the church in Wethersfield, in 1638he left there in 1639 or '40; after which Rev. Henry Smith took the charge of the church there. At this time (1640) a settlement was commencing at Milford, to which place Mr. Prudden removed, and took with him a few of his congregation from Wethersfield. They purchased of the Indians all the land between New Haven (west line) and Stratford, the river being the west line of Milford. The town of Milford was greatly aided in its first settlement by emigrants from the towns of Windsor, Hartford and Wethersfield. It was claimed by Connecticut as within her jurisdiction, as other towns were, where the early settlers went from Connecticut, as was Stratford, Fairfield and Norwalk. It was also claimed by New Haven.\n\nPutman, Elias 1642.\n\nPurcase or Purchis John, 1639perhaps the same that was at Boston in 1656.\n\nPyne, James 1647.\n\nPyncheon, William came to New England as early as 1630. He was one of the principal settlers and founders of the church at Roxbury (near Boston.) He was made an assistant and treasurer of that colony. In 1636, he with a company from Roxbury and vicinity, removed and became the pioneers in settling Springfield. For a few years Springfield was united with Connecticut, and was claimed by it as one of her towns. Mr. Pyncheon was made a magistrate and judge of the Court of Connecticut as early as November, 1636. He attended the General Court, as a member, at three different sessions in 1636-7-8. His vessel was apphed for by the General Court in 1637, to transport the men and munitions of war in the expedition against the Pequotts.

The division in the church at Wethersfield where he first settled, had become so great that Mr. Swain determined on leaving the place and colony. He therefore purchased Branford, and at once commenced a settlement there. Mr. Abraham Pierson, then at Southampton, L.I., united with him with a part of his church and congregation in the settlement at Branford. Mr. Swain was afterwards a magistrate of the New Haven colony. He came to Massachusetts from England in company with Francis, in the ship Rebecca, and was one of the first settlers of Wethersfield.

He received many other marks of confidence from the colony. He was a member of the Colony Congress in 1656-7-8 and '62 and '63. This was the highest office in the gift of the colonies. He had also been treasurer of the colony, and frequently an assistant to the General Court. He was the ancestor of the Talcotts in Hartford, and of the former attorney general of the State of New York. John Talcott in 1673, was appointed a major, to act in case of a war with the Dutch. Governor Tallcott's third daughter, Jerusha, married Doct. Daniel Lathrop, of Norwichshe was a lady of great intelligence. Joseph Talcott was Deputy Governor in 1724, and Governor from 1725 to 1741 inclusive, and treasurer of the colony.\n\nTalcott, Samuel son of Dorothywas a gentleman of less distinction than his brother John.

George Taylor came to Massachusetts in the Truelove, George Gibbs, master.\n\nTaylor, Stephen married Ann Hosford, of Windsor, 1642.\n\nTaylor, Stephen also married Ann Nowel, of Windsorgrand juror in '72. (Perhaps the same person as above.)\n\nTerre or Terry, Stephen Windsorwas among the first settlers of Windsor, and in 1633 was appointed one of a committee with H. Wolcott, jr., William Westwood and Nathaniel Ward to lay a highway for cart and horse upon the upland, from Hartford to Windsor. Grand juror in 1643. Thomas Robert and Richard Terry came from England in the ship James, John May, master, to Massachusetts. John Terry, probably a son of Stephen, united with John Case in settling Simsbury, by enforcing the owners of lands at Massacoe to build on and settle them. Hon.

His children were, Elizabeth, Stephen, Sarah, John, Rebecca, Mary, Solomon, and another Rebecca.\n\nThomas, Serg't. of Mystic, in 1663 apphed to the General Court for directions how to conduct himself there under the authority;he was advised to keep quiet, and if abused by them, to apply to the Deputy Governor, but not to obey those who held commissions under other colonies.\n\nThompson widow of Thomas, married Anthony Hawkins, of Farmington.

His children were, Mary, John, Elizabeth and AbigaiL.In 1667 he charged the wife of Matthew Griswold, of Lyme, of being a witch, and induced others to suspect her of witchcraft; for which Mr. Griswold caused him to be arrested and arraigned before the Court. He stated the cause of his suspicions and jealousies. The Court decided she was not a witch, and that he had no cause to be jealous of herthat he had greatly sinned in harboring such jealousy against so good a neighbor, who had done him many favors. But as he was poor, the Court, to recompense Mrs. Griswold for the wrong, and to clear her of all suspicions of the offenceordered that the opinion of the Court should be published by the constables in Saybrook and Lyme, at some public meetingand ordered Tillerson to pay 7 shillings for the express warrant, and 5 shillings for the constable.\n\nTracy, Thomas Wethersfield, juror in 1614 was often a juror and deputy, and held other posts of honor.

Uriah Tracy, former Senator of the U. S., and Hon. Albert H. Tracy, late Leut. Governor of New York.\n\nERRATA\n\nUpon further examination into the genealogy of the Loomis family, I am satisfied that only the family of Joseph came to Connecticut. I was led into the error by the Lecture of Dr. McClure, delivered at East Windsor some years since. It will be corrected in No. 3when the whole Catalogue will be published, including a large number of names since found, and not printed in either of the two Numbers before the public, in their proper places.\n\nTanner, Rebecca was a sister of Thomas Shaylor, and was married and had sons previous to 1690.\n\nTalcott, Capt.

Their mother Patience, removed to Colchester, and resided there in 1719.\n\nMrs. Taylor widow of Stephen, jr., Windsor. died in 1689.\n\nTerre or Terry Richard, of Southold, L.I., 1662. The descendants of Stephen, of Windsor, claim Richard, of Southold, to have been a brother of Stephen. Tradition says they came to Massachusetts in company; Stephen settled in Connecticut, and the other on L.I. It was probably as claimed by thembeing found one at Windsor, the other at Long Island.\n\nTerry, Leut. John Simsburydied in 1691son of Stephen, of Windsor.

The town of Tolland was originally the east part of Windsor, and in 1713 the town of Windsor appointed Matthew Allyn, Roger Wolcott, and Timothy Thrall to lay out a settlement on the east side of Windsor, on lands purchased of the Indians, which the committee performed and reported. Joseph Benton who had emigrated to Tolland from Hartford, made the record as town clerk in 1719. Notwithstanding in 1715, M. Allyn, R. Wolcott, T. Thrall, and John Ellsworth petitioned the General Court to lay out a township, to be bounded east upon Willimantic river, &c., to contain 36 square miles, and to be called Tolland. The petition was granted, and a town 6 miles square, called Tolland, allowed to the Windsor petitioners. In May, 1719, the four petitioners conveyed the town of Tolland to 53 persons, but reserved to each of themselves 300 acres, and these 53 became the actual settlers of Tolland, some of whom had been settled there as early as 1713 or '14. Amy Hatch was born there as early as 1713. Joseph Hatch the son of Joseph, was the first white male child born in Tolland in 1715. In 1719 Joseph Benton was one of a committee to build a meeting house there; the same year he was appointed to procure a minister to preach there, and the Rev. Stephen Steel officiated at Tolland in 1720. Mr. Benton was sworn first town clerk in 1719, and Shubael Stearns in 1720.

In 1636, the Indians murdered five men at Saybrook, while they were at work in the meadows; and in November of the same year assassinated another, and most cruelly tortured Capt. Tilly to death. In December, 1636, six of the inhabitants of the town were attacked by the Pequots, two of whom were tortured to death by them; during the same month four others were killed there; the January after they assassinated one citizen and took two others, who they split in twain. These murders and other outrages committed by the Indians in 1636-7 caused the war against the Pequots in 1637. When the people of Saybrook attended church at the tap of the drum, the males carried their guns, and stacked them in the corners of the church with a sufficient guard the outside to secure the worshippers from surprise and danger from the Indians.\n\nTinker, John in April, 1660, was made an assistant at N. London, with O. Bruen, J. Rogers, Leut. Smith, and John Smith as commissioners, with the assistance of Maj. Mason, to hold courts there for the year.

Thomas Tewsey began to preach about 1712 or '13.\n\nTucker, John 1642died in '62, at New London. ChildrenMary, John, Amos, Samuel and Rhoda.\n\nTucky, George was fined 40 shillings for using improper language to Mrs. Eggleston.\n\nTudor, Owen came with the 2d colony to Windsor, in 1639.

He also had daughters. Doct. Elihu Tudor, of East Windsor, was a son of Rev. Samuel Tudor, and a great grandson of Owen, he graduated at Yale College in 1750. In 1757 he entered with great spirit into the French war as a surgeon. He was with Gen.

He was called the great mathematician of the day.\n\nTurner, Daniel in 1649 was twice publicly whipt on lecture days, then imprisoned one month, and again whipt and gave bonds for his future good behaviorfor slandering Mrs. Chester. The Puritans appear to have punished offenders by whipping, with the same object that a parent corrects his children, only to improve their habits, morals and manners, and not to disgrace them, unless the offence committed was a great immorality and violation of law. Men who had been publicly whipped, are found afterwards holding places of honor in the colony.\n\nTurner, Nathaniel(see Underhill.) He went with Capt. Endicott to reduce the Indians on Block Island, for the murder of Capt. Oldham, and from thence to the Pequots, to demand the murderers of Capts.
