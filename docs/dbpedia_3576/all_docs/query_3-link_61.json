        "text": "From That Same Old Guy:\n\nI've traipsed through plenty of old mill towns in service of this blog -- Watertown to Clinton to Maynard to Hudson (all in Massachusetts) -- but I'd never seen anyplace like Rockville, Connecticut. A Tolland County village that was incorporated in 1889 and subsumed by the town of Vernon in 1965, Rockville is bisected by the Hockanum River, which drops more than 250 feet over 1.5 miles. That water power allowed for the development of several mills, going back before the Revolutionary War, per Wikipedia.\n\nBefore embarking on a recent day trip to visit my mother in Connecticut, I did a quick Google Maps search to find a good place not too far off the highway where I could explore. Rockville immediately jumped out at me, because of the R.E.M. song. As I zoomed in closer on the map, I could see that there was a nice little downtown; what caught my eye first was Loom City Lofts. That sounded promising. Once I saw Paper Mill Pond and Springville Mill Apartments, I headed to Wikipedia to learn more about this mill town, and realized I had found the right place.\n\nI started my tour at the loft apartment building, which is stunning in its color and style.\n\nLoom City Lofts is situated at the southern end of Shenipsit Lake, where the headwaters of the Hockanum River are located.\n\nThis building is unlike any other old mill complex I've seen. Known historically as the Minterburn Mill, this structure was built in 1906, and is an early example of reinforced concrete in an industrial buildling. Every other mill in Rockville and the other towns and cities that I've visited is wood or brick or a combination.\n\nThere used to be more buildings at the site, the oldest of which dated to 1834. A three-building complex known as the Rockville Warp Building was demolished in 2016. \"The site's industrial history dates to at least the 18th century, when an iron works and a gin distillery were documented at the site,\" according to Wikipedia. \"In the late 18th century George Hall established a fulling mill....The Rockville Warp Building dates to this time; the proprietors also built a stone dam, which was later replaced by the present concrete dam. The mill produced cotton warps used for yarn and satinet production in a number of Rockville's mills. In 1906, the plant was purchased by the Minterburn Mills....That company produced woolen and worsted fabrics until it closed in 1952. The plant was then bought by Roosevelt Mills, which produced knitwear at least into the 1970s.\"\n\nThe apartments opened in 2016.\n\nMy next stop was a backsider's dream, the heart of the Rockville Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. \"The Rockville Historic District consists of approximately 550 acres and includes 975 buildings, a structural density of 1.8 buildings per acre.\" according to this Living Places web page. \"The...[d]istrict is a physical reflection of the development during the nineteenth century of a small industrial city. Dominated by its textile mill buildings and with the fall of the Hockanum River as its matrix, the City of Rockville...embodied the urban and industrial development patterns associated with the use of water power in manufacturing.\"\n\nThe buildings in the historic district are a mix of mills, mill-owner mansions, worker tenements, and commercial and institutional buildings, nearly all of them built between 1830 and 1934.\n\nAbove is the circa-1890 Belding Brothers Silk Mill. Established in Rockville in 1866, the Belding Brothers' company eventually expanded manufacturing operations to Massachusetts, Michigan, California and Canada.\n\nAs I was snapping that photo, a guy in a Keith Gauvin Roofing van, who was stopped at a red light, called out to me: \"Beautiful buildings, right?\" I yelled back that they sure were, and I was trying to shoot as many of them as I could. \"I drive by here all the time for work. There's another down that way that got turned into apartments,\" he said, referring to Loom City Lofts. I told him I'd just come from there. \"This town must have been amazing when all the mills were running,\" he said. I quickly imagined bars, restaurants, banks, social clubs and churches jam-packed with mill workers and their families.\n\nThe light turned green and we wished each other a good day. It's always nice to run into someone who appreciates the backside of America as much as I do.\n\nAbove, you see the Belding Brothers building at right, connected via pedestrian bridge to the former Rose Silk Mill, which the Belding operation acquired in 1871, according to this web page. There once were other buildings to the right of the Belding complex, between Brooklyn and Grove streets. The smokestack to the left is part of the former Dart Stone Mill.\n\n(Close-up of the pedestrian bridge.)\n\nWhile the former Minterburn Mill building -- aka Loom City Lofts -- stands apart from the standard red-brick mills in Rockville and in most other old factory towns, the Dart Stone Mill is yet another kind of old industrial beast. Made of light-colored stone and stucco, the Dart buildings date to 1868, according to this Preservation Connecticut web page.\n\n\"This mill, erected by Albert Dart in 1868, has the most dramatic setting of any mill in Rockville -- perched on the high rock shelf at the second millseat down from Snipsic Lake,\" according to the Preservation Connecticut site. \"Dart first used the mill for spinning silk, then added shoddy production (shoddy is low-grade cloth made from the by-products of wool pressing). Cyrus White bought the mill in 1870, continuing shoddy production and adding manufacture of cotton warps. In the late l870s White ran six sets of cards for his woolen operation and 4,800 cotton spindles, as well as renting space to the textile firms of J.J. Regan and J.A. Smith and Son. Belding Brothers and Co. bought the mill in 1909.\"\n\nThe Hockanum River runs directly underneath the Dart Stone Mill, which you can sort of see in the photo below.\n\nBelow, a view of the Dart Stone Mill from below the falls.\n\nThe Dart Stone Mill, the Rose Silk Mill and others are all crowded together, as you can see below.\n\nTo the left in the photo above is the old Rose Silk Mill. Below is the main entrance.\n\nThe Rose Silk Mill dates to 1867; it was acquired, as mentioned above, by the Belding Brothers in 1871. Below are some more photos of the Rose Silk Mill.\n\nJust north of the Rose Silk Mill is the Hockanum Company mill, which was built in 1865 by the Carlysle Thread Company. Over the decades, the buildings were home to Samuel Fitch and Sons, maker of liners for rubber boots and raincoats; the Hockanum Company; a storage firm; a band practice operation; and more. At some point, it was known as the Daniel's Mill. Below are some shots of this old mill.\n\nNext in the line is a mill complex that, as far as I can tell, is empty.\n\nThese buildings were most recently home to Presstek, Inc., which manufactures offset plates and presses. In 2018, that company was acquired by Mark Andy, Inc., a company founded in 1946 in Missouri. I'm guessing a consolidation followed that deal, resulting in the shutdown of this facility.\n\n(Rear of the former Presstek plant.)\n\nIn 2016, Presstek acquired analog and digital offset printing plate manufacturer Ano-coil, which had been located at this site since 1958, upon its founding.\n\nPrior to Ano-coil, this site was occupied by textile conglomerate M.T. Stevens from 1934-1951. In 1960, a massive fire destroyed much of the original mill complex, which had been built as the American Mills Company. That business was organized in 1847 to manufacture \"woolen textiles, such as cassimeres, and occupied a massive six-story stone and wood mill formerly located east of the present plant,\" per the Connecticut Mills web site. \"The American Mills Company continued to operate and expand its Rockville plant into the early-20th century. In 1918, however, the firm and mill complex were sold to the Hockanum Mill Company, a holding company formed in 1906 that operated three other textile mills in Rockville at the time of the acquisition. The Hockanum Mill Company retained the American Mills Company’s name, management, and some 200 employees, among them being the firm’s 95-year old president George Talcott.\"\n\nI'm unclear on just how many complexes in Rockville the Hockanum Mill Co. operated at its peak, but it was quite a few.\n\nAt the western end of Brooklyn Street, hard by the Hockanum River, is the building below.\n\nNow home to Diversified Welding, the warehouse served as a storage facility for Ladd & Hall, a Vernon-based furniture retailer that went out of business last September after 83 years. I haven't found any further historical information about this property.\n\nAcross Vernon Avenue from the old furniture warehouse is the former New England Mill, the lone surviving building of which has been converted to an apartment complex known as Linden Place.\n\nNew England Mill Co. was founded in 1836, per this web site, making high-grade woolen cloth.\n\nThe Linden building is one of three former mills in the short span between Vernon Avenue and Spring Street that have been redeveloped into living quarters.\n\nThe Florence Mill Apartments, below, were erected in 1864.\n\nI know that picture isn't great, but I was battling the sun on this day. Anyway, this wonderful place provides housing for elderly and disabled residents. The mill replaced a textile mill that was destroyed by fire, per Wikipedia. \"In 1881, it was described as the largest brick building in Rockville, and continued in the production of textiles. It was purchased in 1881 by White & Corbin, who expanded the building several times, making it the largest manufacturing plant in the United States for the manufacture of envelopes,\" Wikipedia continues. \"The building was used for this purpose by White & Corbin and its successors (including the U. S. Envelope Company), until 1975.\"\n\nJust steps westward along West Main Street is Springville Mill Apartments.\n\n\"The Springville Manufacturing Company constructed a modern brick mill in 1886 at 155 West Main Street,\" says the Living Places web site. \"The building was equipped with automatic sprinklers, elevators and electric lights. It features a five-story stair-and-bell tower with a slate-shingled pyramid crowned by a pair of finials.\"\n\nNowadays, apartment dwellers can enjoy a fitness center and in-ground pool.\n\nThe final stop on this mill tour is absolutely my favorite, for a number of reasons.\n\nReason No. 1: The former Hockanum Mill is the oldest surviving textile mill in Rockville, per this handy-dandy web site. \"The Hockanum Company was first established in 1838 to manufacture satinet. In 1858, the company began production of high grade cassimeres from domestic and imported wool. By 1903, 400 workers were employed. A brick mill was added in 1881, and a reinforced concrete building in the early 20th century.\" The complex is located near the western terminus of West Main Street.\n\n(I'm not sure if this house was part of the original mill, nor what its future purpose might be.)\n\nReason No. 2: This mill complex, which contains multiple buildings and which is much bigger than I initially realized, has been home to the New England Motorcycle Museum since 2018. Ken Kaplan of Kaplan Cycles -- which is located on the museum site -- bought the mill complex in 2013 (I think; that's the year he started the renovation project). Kaplan, who has also been in the computer refurbishment business for more than 30 years, is quite a character, which brings me to Reason No. 3:\n\nGo Kaplan America!\n\nLast year, the museum and business owner starred in his own Discovery Channel show, \"Kaplan America.\" I'm not sure whether the show has been renewed. In 2019, in an effort to promote the show, Kaplan, well, just read this article about him getting arrested.\n\nTo fully appreciate the amount of work that went into this project, and that goes into just about large-scale redevelopment of such old mill buildings, check out the video below from the museum:\n\nAccording to the museum web site, there is a plan to open a brew pub on site; I believe the museum is currently open, but operators have been seeking funds to repair roof damage.\n\nBelow is a shot of the motorcycle shop.\n\nThis place is a real eye-popping mix of standard brick mill building and bold new art.\n\nI assumed the painting below depicted internationally renowned motorcycle stunt man Evel Knievel. But after watching all the Kaplan America stuff, I'm not so sure it's not a likeness of the museum owner himself.\n\nMake sure to check back for part two of my Rockville story, in which I discover lots of cool, non-woolen mill stuff!"
