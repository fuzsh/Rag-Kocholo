        "text": "From the Great Pass of the 18th century to America’s Space Exploration of the 20th century to the military installation of the 21st century, Oneida County is home, or directly connected to much of America’s history.\n\nFrom the first international trade during the 18th century through to the world trade of present-day, Oneida County has been at the forefront of America’s growth. The motivation for international interest in this region was its vital woodlands and various fur-bearing animals - as lumber and furs were a much-desired commodity in the marketplace in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries."
