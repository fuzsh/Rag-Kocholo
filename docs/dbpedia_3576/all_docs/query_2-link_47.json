        "text": "In 1638 the New Haven Colony traded \"eleven coats of trucking cloth and one coat of English cloth made in the English fashion\" to the Mattabesec Indians for land known as Totokett (Tidal River). The first permanent settlement was established in 1644 when people from Wethersfield came to Totokett, later renamed Branford after the town of Brentford in Middlesex County, Englandâ€¦..\n\nWe thank the Branford Historical Society and local residents for their assistance in providing these materials."
