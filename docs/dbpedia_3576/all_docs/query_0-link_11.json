George holds an MA in History from Indiana University-Bloomington and a BA in History and Russian from Ohio State University. He is currently the Future Faculty Teaching Fellow in the Department of History, Anthropology, and Classics at Butler University and has received the Walter S.

She positions her research at the intersections of race, gender, and class through the lens of legal history. The women that she researches sit at various levels of oppression and privilege yet each one found themselves at the mercy of the American court system. She is interested in uncovering the various experiences that women had while they navigated the court systems to negotiate the rights of themselves and their children.\n\nClintin Austin\n\nClintin Austin completed a BA with a double major in History and Geography with a minor in Political Science from Texas Christian University.

At IU she hopes to build upon her undergraduate Honors thesis that endeavored to read against the silences of the archives in order to make audible/visible the voices and experiences of Black women even in primary sources that sought to erase their stories. Her thesis looked at Black women’s daily radical resistance from the early Atlantic period through the antebellum era of slavery in the US especially as that resistance was made manifest in acts of maternalism. Anna found this project to be fascinating from the perspective of filling in gaps of US history and from a social justice perspective that seeks to uplift Black women’s voices that have been silenced and/or distorted in order to perpetuate White supremacy and patriarchy. Anna earned her B.A. at the University of Dayton (UD) with a double major in History and English and a minor in Women’s and Gender Studies. Through her coursework at UD, she was privileged to encounter feminist and queer theory that inform her current research in US history.

In her master's thesis, she analyzed histories of women charged with murder to demonstrate how the colonial experience and ideals of gender have shaped the Brazilian criminal justice system. For her doctoral dissertation, she aims to explore photographs of women deprived of freedom in post-emancipation Brazil. Her primary interest lies in understanding how photography was used to delineate degraded forms of personhood and subjection for women of color, as well as how historians can interrupt the colonial and patriarchal gaze that have produced these women’s visual representations. Originally from Porto Alegre (Brazil), Paloma is a Tibetan Buddhist practitioner who also loves contemporary feminist art and is constantly seeking decolonial and anti-neoliberal ways of thinking and living.\n\nJoão Pedro Corrêa da Silva\n\nJoão Pedro Corrêa da Silva is Ph.D student from southern Brazil.

He also worked on heritage and identity regarding German colonization in the State of Rio Grande do Sul and the African community. He is the creator of a website called memory and prejudice. On that website, he deals with racial and sexist issues from the beginning of the '40s in Cachoeira do Sul, a small city in southern Brazil.\n\nJessica David\n\nJessica David is a doctoral candidate in Ancient History at Indiana University. Prior to attending IU, Jessica completed a Bachelor of Arts in History at the University of Southern Indiana (2008), a post-baccalaureate certificate in Classics at the University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill (2010), and a Master of Arts in History at The Ohio State University (2012).

She is interested in history that examines U.S. foreign policy through an inter-American lens, centering both U.S. and Latin American actors, and approaching foreign relations as fundamentally omnidirectional and transnational. She believes that working for a more nuanced understanding of U.S.-Latin American relations can facilitate broader questions about how U.S. power has functioned in the world at large, while offering the necessary context to understand contemporary realities and inequalities in both Latin America and the United States. Jessie holds a B.A. from Whitman College, where she wrote a thesis about Ronald Reagan’s policy toward apartheid South Africa, and an M.A. from the University of Chicago, where she wrote a thesis about Mexico, Cuba, and the United States after the Cuban Revolution.\n\nBrock DeMark\n\nBrock DeMark is a historian of urban space, imperial ideologies, and material culture in colonial-era India and the wider British Empire.

It examines Dagong Bao’s strategies to endure the challenge of market competition and the intricate political environment in China at the time. His current project intends to investigate the relationship between political power and the press, the network of people and resources within the media industry, and the question of censorship and self-censorship in Republican China. Jiacheng was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, and grew up in Shanghai. He has been studying and living in Japan for the past seven years.

His dissertation project examines the historical development of Qizilbash Sufi religiosity and Qizilbash-Alevi communities in early modern Anatolia and Iran from the 1450s to the 1600s. His research explores how Qizilbash Sufism gave rise to new formulations of power, religion and identity through discursive traditions and rituals; what kind of role Qizilbash communities played in the Safavid Empire; how we can situate Qizilbash movement in the context of early modern Ottoman empire-building. Ufuk has conducted archival and library research in Turkey and Iran. In terms of research languages, he has studied Persian in Iran and Classical Arabic in Jordan.\n\nSamuel Fajerstein\n\nSamuel Fajerstein is a Russian Studies Workshop Ph.D. fellow in the Department of History at Indiana University.

Maggie’s research makes a vital intervention in the historiography of “struggle” by untangling intellectual projects and cultural forms of expression in Durban from the dominant dialogue of labor strikes and organized resistance. Maggie additionally has work experience teaching both history and isiZulu, and has held a position as editorial assistant at the American Historical Review.\n\nCarrie Fudickar\n\nCarrie Fudickar is a PhD Candidate writing about Afro-Creek Property in the early nineteenth century.

Originally from La Grande, Oregon, Johnny earned dual bachelor’s degrees in History and Economics from Eastern Oregon University and an MA in History from the University of South Florida. His most recent work examines how American monetary experts connected language of economic ‘science’ with an internationally informed discourse of civilization in the first years of the twentieth century. In doing so, they helped establish the gold-exchange standard as a marker of civilization, which not only expanded the scope of the American civilizing mission, but also the range of imperial power. He is also interested in exploring how the elimination of a diverse range of global currencies to establish “civilized” monetary systems, rendered perceived ‘backward’ nations more transparent to US investors. Johnny is also the Editor of The Economic Historian, a blog he started in 2018, and the Assistant Editor of the Indiana Magazine of History.\"\n\nK. Ermelinda García\n\nK.

In particular, he examined how some women were able to use their influence and power as mothers, sisters, and wives to encourage the men in their lives to embody ideals of masculinity which would foster a more benevolent patriarchy. This research was meant to be both a departure from male-centric studies of masculinity and to add nuance to our understandings of the ways which patriarchy shaped the lives of women in the past. Archival research for this project was carried out at Oxford’s Bodleian Library, the Massachusetts Historical Society, and the Houghton Library at Harvard.

Her dissertation is a labor history of French archives from the eighteenth to twenty-first century. Studying labor brings the history of archival institutions to life, and it provides a way to explain for the vast differences between archives despite state pressures to standardize. Human error, the inherent messiness of archives, and the myriad obstacles that archival workers faced all contribute to institutional specificity. Uncovering and recreating those practices, she argues, is crucial to better understand the French Revolution as it is primarily through those practices that we are able to learn about it at all.
