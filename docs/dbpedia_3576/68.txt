Jabez, the son of James Fitch, was baptized on 7 June 1702 in Preston, New London County, Connecticut. [1] He died on 31 January 1784, probably in Canterbury, Windham County, Connecticut. The Canterbury church records say that Jabez, the son of Major James, married Lydia Gale, the sister of Richard Gale, on 29 May 1722. [2] Captain Jabez married second Elizabeth Darbe on 14 January 1754 in Canterbury. [1] He married third Rebecca Unknown.

Lydia, the daughter of Abraham and Sarah Gale, was born on 9 July 1699 in Watertown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. [3, 2:15] Lydia, the wife of Captain Jabez, died on 22 August 1753 in Canterbury. [1]

Lydia apparently came to Canterbury to live with her older brother Richard.

The inscriptions on the gravestones of Jabez and Lydia in the Cleaveland Cemetery in Canterbury say: [4]

Jabez and Lydia owned the covenant on 2 June 1723 in the church in Canterbury. [2] Lydia, the wife of Jabez, was admitted to the church on 11 April 1731; Captain Jabez was admitted in February 1744. [2]

Jabez was a representative from Canterbury to the General Assembly of the Colony of Connecticut 54 times between May 1734 and December 1775. [5]

Jabez was appointed to a committee to audit the colony’s accounts with the treasurer in May 1737. [5] John Dwight of Killingly’s houseâand all his financial recordsâburned on the night after 18 February 1750. In May 1750 the Assembly appointed Jabez Fitch, Esq. of Canterbury to be on a committee to investigate the matter. [5] The report was presented in May 1751. [5] Upon the request of Jabez Fitch, agent for the town of Canterbury, the Assembly appointed a committee to study a boundary dispute between the towns of Canterbury and Windham in May 1751. [5] During his life he was regularly appointed to committees to help solve the colony's disputes.

In October 1738 the Assembly appointed Jabez ensign of the fifth company in the town of Norwich. [5]

In May 1740 Jabez Fitch of Canterbury complained that he had built a bridge over the Quinnabaug River at a cost of 210 pounds and had received only Â£134-09-00 in subscriptions. The Assembly ruled that he could charge tolls from those who had not paid. [5]

The Assembly appointed Jabez a Justice of the Peace for Windham County for the upcoming year in May 1749 and every year following until May 1755. [5] In May 1756 and every following year until May 1776 the Assembly appointed him Justice of the Peace and Quorum for Windham County for the following year. [5] The Assembly of the State of Connecticut appointed him to this office every year from May 1777 to May 1783. [5]

On 4 February 1754 Jabez Fitch of Canterbury sold the farm he lived on to his son Jabez, Jr. On 4 April 1758 they partitioned the farm. [6]

The Assembly of the colony of Connecticut appointed Jabez a judge of the probate court for the district of Plainfield in Windham County for the following year in May 1759 and every year following until May 1776. [5] The Assembly of the State of Connecticut appointed him to this office every year from May 1777 to May 1783. [5]

In an undated deed, acknowledged on 27 March 1765, Jabez Fitch and Elizabeth Fitchâformerly the widow of William Darbee of Pomfret and now the wife of Jabezâsold 17 acres to Jabez, Jr. [6]

In May 1771 the Assembly appointed Jabez Lieutenant Colonel of the 11th Regiment of Connecticut militia. [5]

Jabez Fitch of Canterbury, being in a “weak and languishing state of body,” made his will on 10 December 1783. He noted that he had never given his son Jabez anything and forgave him 100 pounds of a 110-pound note dated 20 March 1777 he held against him to make him equal to his son Asahel and his three daughters Jerusha, Lydia and Lucy. He also noted that he had given his deceased son Perez, late of Stamford and his deceased daughter Alice, the late wife of Reverend James Cogswell their portions while they were alive, and nothing was due their heirs. The remainder of his estate was to be distributed according to the laws of the state. He appointed his son Jabez his sole administrator. Witnesses testified on 10 February 1784. Inventory, amounting to about 329 pounds was exhibited on 2 April 1784 and accepted on 7 April 1784. [7]

The court ordered a distribution to Jabez's widow Rebecca Fitch on 2 January 1787. After this distribution and debts, the estate was insolvent. A somewhat ambiguous estate paper says that further inventory was discovered. Apparently, a judge ordered that Solomon Morgan of Plainfield and Jabez Fitch [Jr.], late of Canterbury, owed about 151 pounds. Jabez is described as “now absconded and gone.” [7]
