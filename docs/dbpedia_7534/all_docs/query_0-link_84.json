        "text": "Councillor Jane Kean – this is her response to the consolation\n\nI am responding to the Draft Library Strategy 2024-2029 Consultation, as the Labour councillor for the Romford ward of St Alban’s.\n\nTown halls, parish churches, public houses, markets, and local libraries are at the heart of civic life. In the mid-20th century nearly every town, and sizeable village in England boasted a free library. The public provision of a free library was seen as the hallmark of a progressive society where learning was prized as a means of “getting on” socially and economically. Libraries and the learning activities carried out in them contributed directly to the formation of the modern English civic life and culture that many of us grew up and flourished in. It is, therefore, simply bewildering that at a time when we are trying to grow our economy and promote stronger civic values in the younger generation and amongst new immigrants that the council might, if not careful, reduce their opportunities – which in my mind is the only possible outcome if the Council reduces the library estate and service without any firm plan in place to address the remainder of the library estate.\n\nI attended the consultation meetings in Collier Row, Romford and Gidea Park Libraries. There I was forcibly reminded of the role libraries and librarians played in my own personal development. I was an early reader. This was due to the fact that I lived next door to a primary school teacher whose own daughter was a teacher to me. We, family and friends, all regularly visited the Thameside complex in Grays. It was a magical, free, public facility. As well as the theatre, there was also a local history museum and the library. My father studied for his Open University Degree there. While he consulted the academic books in the library, I hung around in the local history museum. It was there I learned Queen Elizabeth 1st’s speech,“ I know I have the body of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and a king of England too.” This was her famous address to her troops at Tilbury. A generation later, my mother and father took their grandchildren, my children, to the local children’s section of Upminster library whilst I studied at Essex University. I was given special permission to take books out overnight from the University’s short loan section. Later I poured over examples of risk calculations at the library table in Upminster as part of my Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators course. I held lessons on London history and places of interest in the room above Hornchurch library and my choir Fairlytes Singers met in that same room for singing rehearsals before performing at the Queens Theatre. As a result of polio and childhood sickness and poverty one of my grandmothers was illiterate, so I would say that my family is living proof of the importance of library based learning in the lives of working class people trying to “get on.” It is simply backward to be divesting our communities of libraries which are fundamentally publicly accessible spaces for learning and self- improvement. Every day we are confronted with fake news and scams. Havering residents need support with literacy, numeracy, critical thought and research skills more than ever before.\n\nSince my election in 2022, I have visited Romford Library many times, to attend meetings of the Citizens Advice Havering, to meet with residents when it is evident that the situation demands a quiet, private, safe space so that they can offload their concerns, and more recently to borrow litter picks for my “Litter Pick and Natters”. It has sometimes been necessary to book a table so that I can use my laptop; demand for tables with access to plug sockets for laptops is high. Having visited regularly, I doubt Romford Library has the capacity to absorb library users from Gidea Park and Collier Row especially if it has to do so before its own facilities are improved, expanded, or these libraries are closed simultaneously. The strategy document also raises doubts about the capacity of the remaining libraries to absorb the extra demand.\n\nMy concern about the strategy and public consultation is that at no time have I seen how the savings figures break down across the library estate, nor have the costs of making those savings been set out in the consultation document. There will be costs to the council of closing and securing buildings and keeping them empty and it is not clear whether the Council intend to sell the land, or develop it using a vehicle for that purpose. What is clear is that the savings of between £334,613 and £350,855 are relatively small whilst the social and economic cost to Havering though difficult to quantify, will be very high and continue for generations.\n\nCURRENT LIBRARY PROVISION IN ROMFORD:\n\nWithin the Romford constituency there are three libraries and they are Romford Main Library (open 50 hours a week) and the two branch libraries of Collier Row and Gidea Park (each open 24 hrs a week). These libraries currently serve the constituency of Romford which had a population of 109,351 in 2021 but this is expected to rise to 119,263 in 2031 which falls just outside the life span of the strategy. Please note that whilst St Alban’s Ward, my ward, does not contain a council library, its population is expected to increase by 34% over this period. No other ward is likely to see the same percentage increase. The Council’s draft strategy does not address the issue of Romford’s population growth over time and this is a serious defect in the strategy.\n\nFLAWED BUSINESS CASE FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT WITHOUT PLANS FOR ROMFORD MAIN LIBRARY\n\nThe strategy and consultation proposes the development of a business case for capital investment in the remaining library estate following the closure of the four unspecified branch library buildings but, other than two lines of text referring to “an options appraisal and business case for a new children’s library”, there are no details of what that capital investment might look like and when it would be sequenced. Based on that, as an elected Romford Labour councillor, I would like to gently and politely ask the Cabinet Member responsible for this strategy to talk to the cabinet member for regeneration. The omission of any reference to the future of Romford’s main library is a significant flaw in the strategy. I am sure the Cabinet Member for Regeneration might be able to advise the Cabinet Member of the reasons why the future of Romford’s main library makes it imperative that the branch libraries in Romford should remain open, including inter alia: –\n\n· Romford’s status as a thriving metropolitan centre.\n\n· Romford’s population is projected to significantly increase as already mentioned.\n\n· The emerging Romford Masterplan will surely make references and spatial provision for the relocation and expansion of the existing library?\n\n· Romford’s library (built in the 1960’s) is in decline.\n\n· There is huge development opportunity in Romford to use Department of Culture Media and Sport grants and community infrastructure contributions to create a cultural quarter bringing together a new children’s learning centre, the local studies and family history service, the museum and the library, funded by revenue generating uses.\n\n· The branch libraries provide scope for alternative library provision should the administration grasp the opportunities that are clearly present.\n\nInstead the Proposed Library Delivery Model plans for the managed reduction of Havering’s branch libraries which in time may prove to be very costly and short sighted.\n\nDEEP AND UNACCEPTABLE CUTS TO ROMFORD BRANCH LIBRARIES AND LIBRARY PROVISION\n\nThe Strategy suggests a reduction in the number of library buildings in the borough by four from ten libraries to six libraries. Identified for potential closure are the two Romford branch libraries of Collier Row and Gidea Park (the other branches being South Hornchurch, Harold Wood, Elm Park and Rainham), but uniquely amongst the Havering constituencies of Dagenham and Rainham, and, Upminster and Hornchurch, that could leave Romford with only one main library which would have to serve a population of approximately 119,263 by the end of the strategy’s lifespan. Not only could Romford lose two branch libraries but 48 hours, out of the proposed reduction of 96 hours would be lost to Romford residents. This is simply unacceptable. It is noted that on the horizon is the possible redevelopment of the Gidea Park Library and this might mitigate that loss but as yet that project is in its early stages.\n\nPROPOSED CLOSURE OF COLLIER ROW BRANCH LIBRARY – UNENLIGHTENED AND COSTLY\n\nThere is no world in which it would be right to close the Collier Row branch Library. Yes, the branch library is in poor condition. It was earmarked for closure back in 2019. However, it was given a reprieve because of its importance to the communities that comprise the wards of Havering-atte-bower and Mawneys. I understand it was hoped that an army of volunteers would help run the service. Volunteers did come forward but it is likely that efforts to bolster the service with volunteer help were undermined by the Covid19 pandemic.\n\nThe Collier Row library serves two Romford wards, Havering-atte-Bower and Mawneys. Both wards contain a population which is below the English average in terms of educational attainment. 23.3% of residents in Havering-atte-Bower, and 21.5% of residents in Mawneys, over the age of 16 have no qualifications. The English Average is 18.1%. Rather shockingly for a Borough whose Leader has been championing proposals to host and develop Europe’s largest data centre only 5 wards out of the 20 Havering Wards meet that average, or have better educational attainment than the English average. It therefore makes no sense for the council to be reducing the library learning opportunities available to the Borough’s children to improve their knowledge and skills. Skills are on the new Labour Government’s agenda. Whilst the residents in Heaton and Gooshays top the list of most educationally challenged wards, they will continue to have access to the Harold Hill Community Hub which is right. Romford’s children will suffer by comparison.\n\nAt the library consultation meetings strong concerns were expressed about the proposed closure of Collier Row branch library because it serves Havering’s rural hinterland and it does not have great transport links to Romford. Collier Row is furthest away from any other nearby library (page 97) when it is closed, its users will be forced to travel by car, bus, bike or on foot into Romford to use the main library. 18.7% of Havering-atte-bowers population and 19.4% of Mawneys’ population do not own a car or van. Residents in these wards would therefore have to walk, cycle or take a bus to Romford to use the main library. The journey times to Romford Library would far exceed current journey times. More concerning, is that fact that at the consultation meetings, the view was expressed repeatedly (and a little unreasonably in my opinion) that Romford was not a popular destination for many residents; an unknown number of older drivers would probably stop using library services because they find negotiating the A12 daunting and the parking costs in Romford’s car parks prohibitive. Additionally, local children from the many local primary schools would not be able to walk to a library escorted by teachers or independently travel because of the perceived risks. Since Collier Row also serves a catchment area with relatively high numbers of children living in poverty it begs the question where will these children go for learning enrichment? Just opening a room in the already booked full to capacity local Community Centres will not address their specific learning needs, it is the skilled human resource in the form of professional library officer that will make a qualitative difference to their lives.\n\nGIDEA PARK LIBRARY AND THE BALGORES SPECIAL SCHOOL\n\nOn 8th November 2023 Council approved the commencement of a procurement process for the Balgores Special School, a project that aims to establish in Gidea Park a 300-place special school for children and young people, next to the existing Gidea Park Library, that may be demolished and reconstructed as part of that project. The emerging plans for this proposed school are not referred to in the library strategy. Of course the planning process is far from certain in terms of timing and outcome so that is understandable. It is, therefore, to the general principle of closing the Gidea Park Library before the outcome of that process is known that this part of my email refers. I would like to urge the Cabinet Member for Young People, and Cabinet Member for Digital Transformation and Customer Services, to give serious consideration to the sequencing of the project so that Gidea Park is not left without its valued local library service.\n\nGidea Park library is loved and used by local residents. Evidence of its place at the heart of the community can be seen from the elaborate murals decorating its walls, to the fine displays of reading scheme books in its children’s section. Attendees of the consultation meetings were left in no doubt of the thought and effort that has gone into making it a warm and welcoming place for local children even if maintenance of the building has not kept pace with that aspiration. It surprises me given the aspiration that resides in its well educated residents that there has been very little capital investment in the library facilities.\n\nGidea Park branch library does not have the same captive market for its services that Collier Row library has, being nearer to Romford main library. However, it is almost as equally popular as Collier Row, judging from the number of visits to the library and this popularity and affluence should have been a reason to invest in its facilities to create a revenue stream that would have offset its annual running costs. What the Cabinet Member for Digital Transformation and Customer Services should be aware of is that Gidea Park has recently lost two banks and two popular butchers shop. Mindful of the emerging plans for the special school, cabinet members might wish to note that should this library be cut and/or closed prematurely there will be an adverse impact on businesses nearby. In the meantime, is there an opportunity to work with the high street banks to offer a banking or post office hub here?\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nMuch is made within the strategy of the role that technology could play in mitigating the harm of closing four of Havering’s branch libraries. However, technology will not help those who do not have access to computers or tablets and they are mainly the old, the poor and those with disabilities. Nor is technology fool proof and a substitute for a professional librarian. As Neil Gaiman wittily said, “Google can bring you back 100,000 answers, a librarian can bring you back the right one.”\n\nPRICELESS CONTRIBUTION OF THE LIBRARY SERVICE\n\nIn bringing this emailed response to the consultation to a close, I thought it important to acknowledge the significant contribution Library staff have made to the mental health and well-being of residents. Residents in the Borough were hit hard by the deprivation of friends and family during Covid19. Hornchurch main library became a vaccination centre. As Havering came out of the pandemic, librarians worked hard to attract back lost visitors. However, libraries soon became houses of hope as they adapted their facilities to meet the physical needs of those seeking warmth and shelter during the worst cost of living crisis in decades. It would be impossible to put a price tag on the contributions that librarians have made but one way of repaying that service would be for the administration to flesh out the missing parts of the library provision jigsaw so far as the future of Romford Main Library and Gidea Park Branch Library are concerned. Then the administration should task its officers with putting its capital to work more efficiently to attract grants for capital investment that would generate new revenue income and reduce library running costs through improved energy efficiency.\n\nThank you for taking the time and trouble to read this response to your consultation. I hope to receive an acknowledgement and response to my comments in due course.\n\nA reason to be cheerful? By Claire Blakemore\n\nThere are many reasons I disagree with Toby Young, but one in particular is his reaction to the film I, Daniel Blake. The film, by Ken Loach, charts how a disabled man in his late fifties, out of work and with poor IT literacy tries to navigate his way through the benefits claims system, and finds himself caught up in an Orwellian bureaucratic nightmare. Toby Young was very upset. Not with the fundamental inhumanity of the Department for Work and Pensions claims system, or with the startling levels of poverty and inequality that have found themselves embedded in modern Britain. He was upset because he thought Loach had an: ‘absurdly romantic view of benefit claimants.’ He was upset because the benefit claimant wasn’t ‘drinking, smoking, gambling, or even watching television’. He was upset because Loach had the audacity to create a character that ‘listens to Radio 4, likes classical music and makes wooden toys for children’. [1] Toby Young was incandescent that a piece of art demonstrated that working class people were cultured.\n\nFigure 1Photo taken by Claire Blakemore Royal Academy Summe Exhibition 2017\n\nThat someone to the right of the political spectrum has this reaction isn’t much of a surprise. The last fourteen years of Conservative rule has been characterised by the strategic\n\nde-prioritisation of the arts. In the state school curriculum art, dance, drama, literature and\n\nmusic has been pushed aside in favour of science, technology, engineering and maths; leading to a startling 47% drop in students taking arts subjects at GCSE. [2] Funding in schools for these subjects is so bad, that Labour reported in 2022 that less than £10 is allocated per student for all music, arts, and cultural programmes. [3] The devaluing of the arts has been further compounded by local funding cuts that have reduced access to arts and cultural venues and spaces. In 2019/20, around 53.5 percent of 11-15 year olds in England were participating in theatre and drama activities, compared to 69 percent in year 2008/09. [4] The reality for too many young people is that they will never have visited a theatre, been to an art gallery, or museum to experience first hand the transformative power of art and culture.\n\nThe Cultural Learning Alliance calls this the learning enrichment gap, in 2017, a Sunday Times investigation found that private schools in London alone have 59 theatres.\n\nbetween them, with many of them being state of the art. By contrast, the West End only has 42\n\ntheatres. [5] We spoke to local teachers in Havering, who say that the appetite for attending local theatres is as high as ever, and that many schools are still running trips and days out to the theatre, but that this effort is hampered by lack of funding. The number of places offered for students are limited, with demand vastly higher than places available. One of the biggest issues is the cost of staffing to replace the teachers that chaperone trips. Some teachers resort to using their own days off to minimise the staffing costs and make these trips happen. The teachers we spoke to said that to increase participation it would be great for theatre companies to visit the school themselves, or have more opportunities for artists in residence so that pupils see first hand what it means to be a professional creative. While there are some fantastic initiatives, for example Speak Up run by the National theatre, a lot depends on secure long-term funding for schools and local arts venues. Meanwhile, schools are increasingly losing art and drama teachers and the willingness and appetite for schools to provide access to these activities is precarious and too dependent on the goodwill of passionate teachers to keep them going. For example, if a drama teacher leaves, it can be the case that the provision of drama teaching will leave with it, given the subject is not on the national curriculum. Right now, the pressure on teachers is higher than ever, and with that, it is easier for cultural enrichment activities to fall down the list of priorities.\n\nOne of the consequences when we devalue the arts in state education is that we end up\n\nwith unequal representation in our creative industries. According to an analysis by\n\nLabour nearly half of all British cultural stars nominated for major awards in the last decade\n\nwere educated at private schools. This is despite only 6% of the population being privately educated. [6] Meanwhile, the creative industries are suffering from a drought of diverse, imaginative creative talent. A report by Creative Access found that class is the missing dimension in diversity and inclusion in the creative industries, with 73% believing there is class-based discrimination, this is particularly pronounced in publishing. [7] While this is set to have an impact on our cultural heritage, health of our creative economy and international standing, another key dimension of denying children arts and culture is the impact on their mental health. A comprehensive study by Oxford researchers in 2023 found that young people’s mental health deteriorated during COVID-19, with higher levels of depression and social, emotional and behavioral difficulties than before the pandemic hit. [8] Arts and culture form part of a holistic package of education that ensures children feel a sense of connectedness to themselves, each other, and society. Art may not be a panacea for mental health, but allowing children the opportunity for artistic expression does form an important part of a broader education of the whole child.\n\nBut change, finally, is afoot. In March, Keir Starmer outlined Labour’s vision and long term strategy for the arts – putting creativity, art, and culture at the heart of their stated aim of a decade of national renewal. As Charlotte Higgins from the Guardian pointed out, the content of his speech mattered less than the fact that he was making it at all. [9] There has been a deafening silence for too long on the importance of the arts and culture to the UK, despite it being a fundamental component of our soft power as a nation, and as Starmer has pointed out, the bedrock of our ability to attract international investment – for example he noted Warner brothers building studios in the UK. In his speech, Starmer has promised to put creativity at the heart of the curriculum, ensuring that the school accountability framework is reworked to make sure that the arts count and that all children should study an arts or sports subject until 16. He also noted the importance of oracy skills being woven into the education system, something that private education already prides itself on. Encouragingly, there was also acknowledgement of the importance of the arts for health and wellbeing, noting that young people face a mental health crisis that the arts could go some way to mitigate. Starmer noted that while he ‘cannot turn on the taps’ in terms of funding straight away, the curriculum is something that is an immediate change that can be made. [10]\n\nWhile the election is far from won, Keir Starmer’s speech was the first time anyone working in arts education has a reason to be hopeful in a long time. That we may, if all goes well, have someone in Downing Street who understands that the arts and economic vitality is not a zero sum game. That growing the economy and investing in the arts is not mutually exclusive. The stunted imagination evident in education policy in recent years has been worrying. When Rishi Sunak announced he wanted everyone to study maths to 18 it suggested there was no greater vision for education and skills other than educating everyone to become an investment banker like him. [11] This wouldn’t be so much of a problem if this announcement was complemented also by a focus on the arts, or it was joined up in some way with other elements of the curriculum, to provide young people a holistic education. It was a good example of policy being led by ego not evidence. Perhaps someone should tell Sunak about the link between mathematical and musical ability, and that studies show children who play musical instruments are able to complete complex mathematical problems better than peers who do not play instruments. [12]\n\nFigure 2 Thangam Debbonaire MP Shadow Culture Secretary\n\nMeanwhile, after 12 culture secretaries in 14 years, we now have the tantalising prospect of Thangam Debbonaire as a potential culture secretary. Debbonaire was a professional cellist who performed as part of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and describes her potential future post as her ‘dream job.’ If Debbonaire was elected, it would be a huge departure in and of itself, given that none of the last 12 cultural secretaries have had an arts education, the majority coming from Law or Finance backgrounds. [13] In a recent speech at Remix Summit London 2024, Debbonaire made another crucial point about the importance of arts and culture – the link with progress and emerging technologies, noting: ‘It is the creative industries that stimulate ideas of what another world could look like’. [14] Both Debbonaire and Starmer seem to fundamentally grasp that investment in arts and culture is what drives innovation, rather than distract from it. Crucially, both talk about creating the right conditions for art and culture to thrive, and that there has to be a holistic ecosystem, supported by many parts of society for people to not just take part in the arts, but take risks in it. Debbonaire has also underscored the need for diversity and equality to be part of building the right ecosystem, a critical dimension if we are to truly develop world-leading culture. She notes that she wants to see creative industries and art and culture, work together and that ‘the publicly invested sector feeds the commercial sector, and vice versa.’ [14] Critically for arts educators she wants every child to have access to high quality creative education, understanding that creativity skills are critical no matter what job a child may do in later life. But more than that, she understands that giving someone access to an outlet for creative expression is something that enriches a persons life, no matter who they are and what job they end up doing.\n\nAll these announcements are positive, but we have to be realistic that it will take decades of funding and hard work to try to undo some of the damage done over the last 14\n\nyears, and we are yet to fully see the impact of strangling arts investment on the next\n\ngeneration of creative talent. But I want to end on a positive note, because if there is one thing\n\nopening access to the arts gives us, it’s more optimism. Ken Loach announced his\n\nretirement last year, but there are signs the next generation of filmmaking voices are\n\nalready here, in spite of the current political climate. The film, aptly titled Scrapper by Charlotte Regan depicts a young girl, who uses her wits to survive on her own terms after losing her mum. It recently won the World Cinema Dramatic Grand Jury Prize at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. [15] Charlotte Regan, the director, identifies herself as working class, and has said that ‘I’d love to see more working-class films that are happier’. [16] The film is a joy, rather than the usual grey of kitchen sink, social realist drama it is colourful, fizzing with charm and eccentricity to reflect Charlotte’s lived experience. This is why people need to be able to express art in their own way. There is more to working class lives than poverty. There is humour, vitality, and community. As Reagan shows there are so many groundbreaking, entertaining stories still to be told.\n\nFinally, as Starmer said in his speech, ‘talent doesn’t discriminate, opportunity does’. [10] Artistic talent, like sporting talent doesn’t care what’s in your bank balance. Labour’s job, if they are to win the next election is to ensure they do everything to make sure that finding that talent is not a lottery. They must build an ecosystem that not only finds creative talent, but nourishes it and helps it thrive. Not just because it is the right thing to do, but because when we allow the best artistic talent to shine, we give all of us the chance to see the world through new, more vivid, more optimistic eyes.\n\n++++\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3869182/Why-Lefties-misty-eyed-movie-romanticises-Benefits-Britain-says-TOBY-YOUNG.html\n\nhttps://www.campaignforthearts.org/huge-decline-in-arts-subjects-worsens-at-gcse-and-a-level/\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jul/15/creativity-crisis-looms-for-english-schools-due-to-arts-cuts-says-labour\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/421005/childrens-theatre-activities-engagement-england-uk-by-age/\n\nhttps://www.culturallearningalliance.org.uk/closing-the-enrichment-gap-between-independent-and-state-schools/#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20a%20Sunday%20Times,End%20only%20has%2042%20theatres.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/10/uk-award-nominees-privately-educated-labour-analysis#:~:text=Labour’s%20study%20mirrors%20the%20findings,of%20those%20who%20won%20Brits.\n\nhttps://creativeaccess.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-class-ceiling-in-the-creative-industries-report-2024-2.pdf\n\nhttps://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-09-21-young-people-s-mental-health-deteriorated-greater-rate-during-pandemic-major-new\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/15/labour-leader-arts-keir-starmer-background-culture\n\n10. https://labour.org.uk/updates/press-releases/keir-starmers-speech-at-the-labour-creatives-conference/\n\n11. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-outlines-his-vision-for-maths-to-18\n\n12. https://www.brainbalancecenters.com/blog/correlation-between-math-and-music-ability#:~:text=It’s%20about%20time%20signatures%2C%20beats,who%20do%20not%20play%20instruments.\n\n13. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Culture,_Media_and_Sport\n\n14. https://www.debbonaire.co.uk/blog/2024/02/13/speech-to-remix-summit-london-2024-ideas-for-the-revolution/\n\n15. https://www.sundance.org/blogs/release-rundown-grand-jury-prize-winners-scrapper-and-the-eternal-memory-open-in-august/\n\n16. https://www.bfi.org.uk/interviews/charlotte-regan-scrapper\n\nThis article is part of a series covering the Fabian New Year Conference , written by Dave Baldock and Sue Watson\n\nDavid started by thanking the Fabian Society for the invitation. During the speech he was interrupted several times by protestors over the Labour approach to the war Gaza and Israel’s aggression. The disruption attracted coverage in the national media.\n\nThe General Election gave the Country a change option between Labour and the Conservatives. Labour offered green jobs and protection for the planet.\n\nThe Government was proposing to break international law with the Rwanda scheme. The rule of law is fundamental and doing this sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nLabour would reconnect and restore the UK’s influence in the world. There were bleak issues to deal with – Ukraine and Gaza were worrying but there is a rising threat of military power and neglect of Human Rights\n\nThe older rules-based order is eroding with great power rivalry causing tension. Institutions such as the United Nations are not valued, and with the climate in crisis the influence of government is being reigned back. Mounting disorder does not help address climate issues as there is a lack of co-ordination.at Government level.\n\nAfter the first interruption, David resumed.\n\nLabour wants a sustainable cease fire in Gaza.\n\nChange will be brought about by Labour in power not by protest. Labour in government will have more ability to achieve this.\n\nDavid Lammy’s recent Fabian pamphlet sets out a vision reconnecting Britain to the world[1].\n\nThis advocated “progressive realism” – equality, rule of law, internationalism.\n\nWe must deal with the world as it is, not as we would wish it to be. This continues the realism of Bevin, the architect of NATO, and the principled foreign policy advocated by Robin Cook.\n\nBevin saw things as they were. He was not a fan of Stalin and would not be a fan of Putin. He advocated the nuclear deterrent and standing up to dictators. He had faults, particularly views on the empire.\n\nRobin Cook had conviction and principles. The response of the Labour government to Kosova reflected this.\n\nLabour needs to operate in the real world of Bevin and apply the idealism of Cook.\n\nThe new world disorder is changing lives with more conflicts. Gaza had seen thousands of innocent people killed. Eighty-five per cent of the population were refugees, and there were still over a hundred hostages.\n\nThe position was intolerable, and Lammy called for a sustainable cease fire. He had been to the Middle East four time, and each time there was a fear of escalation. Israel and Hizballah were close to conflict. The conflict had expanded to the Red Sea which was threatening food prices. So, closing the Red Sea would have significant CONSEQUENCES.\n\nPreventative diplomacy is needed, one of Britain’s strengths. In its approach to Israel and Palestine the UK had seen a decade of indifference. It is important not to sleepwalk in to despair.\n\nThe Israeli PM was morally wrong to reject a Palestinian state. Israel must change. Under a Labour government the UK will collaborate with partners to recognise Palestine as part of a move to peace,\n\nRussia has chosen war in Ukraine and was now aligned with Iran and North Korea.\n\nSoth Korea had provided more shells to Ukraine than Europe. There needs to be a long-term response and a pathway to Ukraine NATO membership.\n\nThis is progressive realism.\n\nThe climate is a longer-term issue. The COP approach has made progress, albeit too slowly. We should not lose perspective After Paris 2015, the rise in temperature was forecast to rise by 3.5 degrees, now the projection is 2 degrees. So, progress has been made. The expenditure on clean energy id now doubles that on fossil fuels.\n\nThe UK can set an example. Labour is committed to ending new licences in the North Sea. There is a need to build on “securenomics” to build and protect green markets.\n\nWe are living through a crisis and if and when Labour returns to Government the eyes of the world will be on us.\n\nThe aim of Government is to keep people secure, and the planet protected. Neither is guaranteed and Labour needs to rise to the challenge.\n\nDB\n\n.\n\n[1] Britain Reconnected – David Lammy March 2023"
