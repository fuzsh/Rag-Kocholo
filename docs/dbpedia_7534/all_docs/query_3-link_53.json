        "text": "​The Olympic Games have one of the most widely recognised brands in the world – constructed over a century since the birth of the modern Games, yet with roots that reach back millennia to Ancient Greece. Throughout the years, hundreds of people have grown and enhanced that brand, and over time the need emerged to create a comprehensive foundational identity to increase consistency, efficiency and impact across all that the IOC does. The project would become the first of its kind since the modern Games began in 1896 – the development of a global Olympic identity designed for all mediums and channels.\n\nTaking inspiration from the rich heritage of Olympic graphic design, a new visual system has been created to bolster the brand’s core values, all the while enhancing consistency and recognition through numerous applications. The evolved Olympic brand identity also adds purpose and emotion to a brand whose influence extends beyond the organisation and the Olympic Games to all stakeholders and personnel connected with the Olympic Movement.\n\n​\n\nOlympic past inspiring the brand evolution\n\nWhen it comes to evolving the identity of a brand with such a storied past, there’s no shortage of material to take inspiration from. Extensive research of the Olympic archives was conducted in order to find design pearls from past Games editions. The team drew on every decade, especially the golden age of graphic design through the 60s and 70s when the Olympic Games identities helped shape a new design aesthetic and approach that transcended cultures and languages.\n\nUndoubtedly, the most important piece of Olympic identity throughout the years are the Olympic rings. The famed symbol was designed in 1913 by the founder of the modern Games, Pierre de Coubertin, and debuted at the Olympic Games Antwerp 1920, the first Games after World War I. The symbol represents the world coming together; at the time of its design, every flag in the world contained at least one of the symbol’s six colours. These colours continue to be at the foundation of the evolved identity, and the new graphic devices introduced combine them to further represent the world united on the field of play.\n\nThe idea of incorporating illustrations in the evolved brand identity was also rooted in and inspired by Olympic history – specifically the role art and creativity played in it. From 1912 to 1948, art competitions were held alongside the sport – with Olympic medals awarded to architects, poets and artists. Adding illustrations to the evolved brand identity was a way not only to communicate and connect in new ways, but also to bring art back into the heart of the Olympic brand, championing creative talent in the process.\n\nThe three new typefaces also took cues from the Olympic past. Bold, athletic and proud, Olympic Headline was inspired by typography found throughout Olympic Games history, such as the Tokyo 1964 and Seoul 1988 emblems. Clear, classic and Swiss-inspired, Olympic Sans is a contemporary interpretation of Akzidenz-Grotesk, a typeface designed in 1896, the same year that the modern Games were born. Traditional, artistic and inspired by heritage, Olympic Serif gives a subtle nod to the ancient Games.\n\nTHE EVOLUTION BEGINS\n\nThe new design system is currently in use across dozens of internal and external IOC channels and projects, as well as partners’ platforms, with the full brand rollout expected by Paris 2024. Today, it is possible to experience elements of the evolved identity in person at the IOC headquarters and The Olympic Museum in Lausanne as well as the Olympic Broadcasting Services and Olympic Channel Services offices in Madrid.\n\nDigital channels such as Olympics.com and the Olympics app are currently undergoing a complete brand overhaul to align with the evolved identity and connect with audiences in new, more impactful ways. Alongside the Olympic Games, all future editions of the Youth Olympic Games will also feature the evolved brand identity.\n\nNew brand elements are also expected to be released in the future. In the coming months, a new set of Olympic sports and universal pictograms will be debuted, providing a language-neutral, gender-neutral icon system for the Olympic identity. New illustrations will also progressively be added to enrich and update the current brand assets, while allowing for continuing engagement with artists and creative talent.\n\nThe evolved brand identity was created by Canadian Agency Hulse & Durrell in collaboration with the IOC and a team of international artists, typographers and designers."
