        "text": "As the under-31 section of the Fabian Society, the Young Fabians is the only left-of-centre think tank run by and for young people. We focus on the development of policy ideas through empowering members to contribute to current debate and discussion.\n\nThe Young Fabians run a host of events ranging from panel events with high profile speakers to policy workshops focused on generating ideas that seek to solve some of the issues faced by society.\n\nThe organisation is responsible for publishing policy pamphlets and members can also contribute their articles to its dedicated magazine: Anticipations. In addition to the national executive, the Young Fabians is home to several policy networks, which run their own events in their specific policy area."
