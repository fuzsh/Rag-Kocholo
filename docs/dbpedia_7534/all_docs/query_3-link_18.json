        "text": "The Fabian Society has played a central role for more than a century in the development of political ideas and public policy on the left of centre.\n\nAnalysing the key challenges facing the UK and the rest of the industrialised world in a changing society and global economy, the society’s programme aims to explore the political ideas and the policy reforms which will define progressive politics in the new century.\n\nThe society is unique among think tanks in being a democratically constituted membership organisation.\n\nIt is affiliated to the Labour Party but is editorially and organisationally independent. Through its publications, seminars and conferences, the society provides an arena for open-minded public debate.\n\nAll Labour Prime Ministers have been members of the Fabian Society.\n\nMore about the Fabians The Fabian Society: a brief history\n\nBeatrice and Sidney Webb\n\nBeatrice and Sidney Webb (1858 – 1943 & 1859 – 1947) were the most significant early figures in developing the ideas that would come to characterise Fabian thinking – a thorough research methodology that remains a feature of the Society to the present day.\n\nBoth were prodigious authors, producing works that provided the foundation stone for much of the modern welfare state.\n\nYoung Fabians\n\nThe Young Fabians are the under-31′s section of the Fabian Society. Established in 1960, they are the only think tank run by and for young people. They are affiliated to the Labour Party and have formal representation on the Young Labour National Committee.\n\nThere are over 1,700 Young Fabians and all Fabian Society members under the age of 31 are automatically members of the Young Fabians.\n\nThe Young Fabians develop policy ideas through seminars, conferences and pamphlets and produce a quarterly magazine, Anticipations. They seek to encourage debate and political education amongst our members and within the wider Labour movement.\n\nFabian Women\n\nThe Fabian Women’s Network was launched in 2005, and is run by a committee of volunteers. There are approximately 2,000 women in the Fabian Women’s Network of all ages and backgrounds.\n\nThe Fabian Women’s Network aims to bring people together to:\n\ncreate a thriving network for social and political change,\n\nconnect Fabian networks with Fabian Women Parliamentarians; and\n\nprovide new ways in which women from all backgrounds and sectors can engage in topical policy debates.\n\nThe Network has held a number of high profile receptions and policy discussions and regularly works with voluntary sector organisations on campaigns that affect women’s lives, including women and finance, work/life balance and family related policy. Speakers at previous events have included Cabinet Ministers, Ministers, representatives from leading charities or agencies, business, academics and media.\n\n2011 saw the launch of Fabiana, the Fabian Women’s Network magazine.\n\nBooks about the Fabians\n\nThe History of the Fabian Society by Edward R. Pease (1916) Kindle edition\n\nThe Fabians by Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie (1977)\n\nFamous Fabians\n\nWikipedia entries for:\n\nAnnie Besant (1847-1933)\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw (1856-1950)\n\nBeatrice Webb (1858-1943)\n\nSidney Webb (1859-1947)\n\nHG Wells (1866-1946)\n\nRH Tawney (1880–1962)\n\nGDH Cole (1889-1959)\n\nMargaret Cole (1893-1980)\n\nHarold Laski (1893-1950)\n\nMichael Young (1915-2002)\n\nAnthony Crosland (1918-1977)\n\nBrian Abel-Smith (1926-1996)\n\nBernard Crick (1929-2008)\n\nThe Fabian Window\n\nThe stained glass window was designed by George Bernard Shaw in 1910 as a commemoration of the Fabian Society, and shows fellow Society members Sidney Webb and ER Pease, among others, helping to build ‘the new world’.\n\nRead more\n\nLondon School of Economics\n\nLSE was founded in 1895 by Beatrice and Sidney Webb after a breakfast meeting with Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw at Borough Farm, near Milford, Surrey on 4 August 1894.\n\nThe four Fabians decided to establish the School following a bequest of £20,000 by Henry Hunt Hutchinson who wished to advance the Fabians’ objectives of a fairer society. By studying the causes of poverty and analysing inequalities, the Webbs sought to promote greater equality of power, wealth and opportunity.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n."
