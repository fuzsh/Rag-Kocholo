        "text": "Government\n\nThe United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is the monarch—the king or queen. The head of government is the prime minister, who serves in the name of the monarch.\n\nThe United Kingdom has three branches of government: the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. The legislature consists of Parliament, which is the supreme authority in the country. The executive consists of the prime minister, the Cabinet, and other ministers who make and direct the policy of the country, along with government departments and local authorities. The judiciary determines common law and also interprets statutes, or legislative enactments of Parliament.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a written constitution. The British constitution is formed partly by statutes; partly by common law, based on decisions of courts of law; and partly by practices and precepts, which are known as conventions. These conventions are not part of the law of the country but are nevertheless necessary for running the machinery of government. Because the constitution is not written, it can be adapted as necessary either by an act of Parliament or by the acceptance of a new convention.\n\nThe Monarch\n\nThe monarch, or sovereign, is nominally the head of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. The monarch is also the head of the established Church of England and is commander in chief of the armed forces. In practice, however, the monarch acts only on the advice of the prime minister and the Cabinet and cannot reject or ignore their advice. These restrictions on the powers of the monarch are the result of several centuries of confrontation and interaction between the monarchy and Parliament. The current monarch of the United Kingdom is King Charles III. In effect the United Kingdom is governed by his majesty’s government in the king’s name.\n\nThe king still has a number of duties. He formally appoints the prime minister and other important government ministers. He calls and dissolves Parliament, and he opens a new session with a speech from the throne. This speech, written by the government, outlines plans for the forthcoming session of Parliament. The king confers honors—in the form of peerages, knighthoods, and decorations—that are given on the advice of the government and that often reward people for services to the political party in power. He also can award some honors himself, such as the Order of the Garter. He appoints judges, army officers, diplomats, and officials of the Church of England, also on advice.\n\nAlthough the king has little authority of his own, he is kept informed of events and is sometimes consulted by the government. The king has the advice of a Privy Council, which consists of government ministers and other people recommended by the government. In the event of an inconclusive national election, the king may be required to choose a new prime minister.\n\nThe king is also head of the Commonwealth, which consists of independent countries that formerly belonged to the British Empire as well as some dependent territories. The Commonwealth has more than 50 members, including Australia, Canada, India, and Nigeria. The king is head of state in some Commonwealth countries; he is represented in these countries by governors-general, who are not members of the British government and who act independently. The British government cannot interfere in the affairs of a Commonwealth member, except in the case of dependencies, such as the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar.\n\nThe history of the monarchy plays a large part in the history of the British Isles. The present monarch is a descendant of Sophia—the ruler of the German electorate of Hanover—whose son came to the British throne in 1714 as George I. Sophia was the nearest Protestant descendant of James I, her grandfather. The Act of Settlement in 1701 provided for the accession to the throne of Sophia and her heirs in order to ensure a Protestant monarchy. By this act all British monarchs must be members of the Church of England. The act also strictly limited the role of the monarch in the government of the country. In 1917 the royal family dropped their German titles and took the name of the house of Windsor because of the unpopularity of everything German during World War I.\n\nThe king and his family members are largely supported by the state. Parliament annually approves allowances for members of the royal family. The king’s private expenditures come partly from his own funds and partly from an inheritance known as the Duchy of Lancaster. The prince of Wales receives revenues from another estate—the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nLegislature\n\nParliament is responsible mainly for making laws, appropriating money for state purposes, and debating important issues. Parliament consists of the monarch, the House of Commons, and the House of Lords. In theory the monarch functions as the supreme legislative authority through Parliament. In practice, however, the monarch and Parliament rarely come together, except at the openings of Parliament sessions.\n\nThe House of Commons is technically the lower chamber of Parliament, but in practice it dominates the upper chamber, or House of Lords, in terms of activity and political power. Only the Commons has the power to impose taxes and to vote on spending issues affecting public departments and services. It consists of 646 popularly elected members—529 from England, 59 from Scotland, 40 from Wales, and 18 from Northern Ireland. Each member—called a member of Parliament, or MP—is elected from and represents a particular constituency, or district. Members receive a salary and hold their seats for the duration of a Parliament.\n\nAt the beginning of each new session of Parliament, the members of the House of Commons elect a speaker. The speaker controls debates and rules on points of order and members’ conduct. Members of Parliament are controlled by their party whips, who round up members before debates and make sure that they vote.\n\nThe members of the upper house of Parliament, the House of Lords, are not popularly elected. The beginnings of the Lords can be traced back as far as the 11th century, when the Anglo-Saxon kings consulted councils composed of religious leaders and royal advisers. It did not emerge as a distinct element of Parliament, however, until the 13th and 14th centuries. By the late 17th century the House of Commons had overtaken the House of Lords to become the predominant chamber, and today the power of the Lords is very limited.\n\nPrior to 1999, the House of Lords included all hereditary peers, or nobles by inheritance or birth. The House of Lords Act of 1999 disqualified hereditary peers for membership in the House, with the exception of 92 individuals who had been elected by their fellow peers and were allowed to retain their seats on a temporary basis. Life peers, or individuals with nonhereditary titles conferred by the monarch, now form the majority in the House of Lords. The chamber also includes archbishops and senior bishops of the Church of England. Peers receive no salary. Although about 700 individuals are qualified to sit in the House of Lords, only about half regularly attend sessions.\n\nLegislation begins with the introduction of a bill into either house. Most bills are introduced by the government, though members may introduce their own bills. Finance bills can be introduced only in the Commons. A bill is given three readings in the house in which it is introduced; if passed, it is sent to the other house, where it is submitted to the same procedure. If a bill is passed by both houses, it becomes law. In theory the monarch has the right to veto a bill, but this has not occurred since the 18th century. Likewise, the House of Lords has little power to stop or delay bills that have been passed by the Commons. It is hoped that the members of the Lords—often senior political figures who have been knighted for their services—will use their experience to suggest amendments to a bill. The Lords cannot interfere with a finance bill or with a bill that has been passed by the Commons in two consecutive sessions.\n\nExecutive\n\nThe head of the government is the prime minister. The prime minister is the leader of the majority party in Parliament and has the power to appoint and dismiss ministers. The prime minister is the main representative of the government and recommends the appointment of some senior judges and of senior clergy of the Church of England. The prime minister also draws up an annual list of honors, which are usually awarded on New Year’s Day.\n\nThe prime minister selects a Cabinet of ministers from MPs in his or her political party. The Cabinet develops the government’s policies, which are presented as proposed legislation to Parliament, and exercises control over government departments. Meetings of the Cabinet are held in private, and strict secrecy is maintained. Some matters are discussed by Cabinet committees, which consist of the ministers involved. The Cabinet Office handles the records of Cabinet meetings and provides information to ministers. To maintain stability the Cabinet must act as a collective group and issue unanimous statements and policies. If a minister does not agree with Cabinet policies, that minister must resign.\n\nMinisters head government departments and are responsible for the work of those departments. The ministers must be prepared to answer questions about their departments in the House of Commons. Ministers who sit in the House of Lords have a parliamentary secretary who answers questions raised in the Commons. This system of parliamentary control over government departments discourages inefficiency and irresponsibility.\n\nThere are many government departments of various sizes and complexity. Major departments include the Treasury, which handles the country’s finances; the Ministry of Defence; the Ministry of Health, which operates the National Health Service; the Home Office, which controls the police and other law-and-order institutions; the Foreign Office; and the Post Office. There are several Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish departments. Most of the work of government departments is carried out by members of the civil service. Because none of the positions held by civil servants is an elective or political appointment, a change in government does not affect a department’s staff.\n\nJudiciary\n\nThe judiciary is independent of the legislature and the executive. No one—not even the monarch—can control or influence the courts’ operations or decisions. Judges in the United Kingdom are appointed by the sovereign, on advice, and are virtually irremovable.\n\nThe legal system of Scotland differs in many ways from that of England and Wales; however, both systems have civil and criminal divisions, and both use the jury system for trying persons accused of serious crimes. The legal system of Northern Ireland is similar to that of England and Wales.\n\nIn England and Wales the courts most often used for civil cases are the county courts. Certain cases are heard in one of the divisions of the High Court. The Civil Division of the Court of Appeal hears appeals from the county courts and the High Court. Further appeal is possible to the Supreme Court, the United Kingdom’s highest court. Legislation passed in 2005 established the Supreme Court to assume the judicial functions of the House of Lords, which had previously served as the highest court of appeal. The new court opened in 2009.\n\nMost criminal cases are tried without a jury in magistrates’ courts. These courts are presided over by unpaid laypeople called justices of the peace or by paid magistrates, who are trained lawyers. Serious criminal cases usually come first before a magistrates’ court before passing to the Crown Court for trial by jury. The Central Criminal Court handles cases for London and its surrounding districts. Appeals from the Crown Court are heard in the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal or, sometimes, in the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Scotland most civil cases are heard in sheriff courts, which are similar to English county courts. Minor civil matters are often tried by a justice of the peace. The supreme civil court is the Court of Session, from which appeals may be made to the Supreme Court. Minor criminal cases are handled by district and sheriff courts, with or without a jury. More serious criminal cases go to the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh.\n\nElections and Political Parties\n\nAll British citizens aged 18 or older are eligible to vote in parliamentary and local elections. Voter registration is compulsory and carried out annually. Residents who do not return the registration form sent to their home each year may be fined.\n\nA general election for all members of Parliament must be held at least every five years. However, the prime minister can ask the monarch to dissolve Parliament and call a general election at any time. Candidates for election to Parliament or a local council are normally chosen by the local parties. There are no primary elections as in the United States.\n\nThe United Kingdom has had a two-party political system since the late 17th century. Since World War I the Conservative and Labour parties have dominated the country’s politics. The Conservative Party has generally supported the interests of big business and private property owners, advocated a strong military, and promoted traditional cultural values. The Labour Party historically has advocated socialism and the nationalization of basic industries and relied heavily on trade unions for support. Starting in the late 20th century, however, the Labour Party reevaluated some of its leftist policies in an effort to broaden its appeal. For example, it dropped its unpopular unilateral nuclear disarmament policy and rewrote the clause of its constitution that committed it to the public ownership of industry.\n\nIn the late 20th century several smaller parties began to gain representation in Parliament. The most prominent of them was the Liberal Democrats, formed in 1988 by the merger of the Liberal and Social Democratic parties. There are also small nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales—the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales). Parties in Northern Ireland include the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Sinn Féin.\n\nRegional and Local Government\n\nIn 1999 Parliament devolved, or passed down, many of its legislative and executive powers regarding regional government to national assemblies in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The central Parliament remains responsible for defense, foreign affairs, social security, and overall economic policy for the United Kingdom. It also continues to act as the regional government for England, which does not have its own assembly.\n\nOf the three regional assemblies, the Scottish Parliament enjoys the widest powers. It has responsibility for such matters as health, education, agriculture, and transportation and can make small adjustments to the British income tax rate. The Welsh assembly has similar powers but cannot levy taxes or draft new laws. Northern Ireland’s assembly, which was established as part of the Good Friday peace agreement of 1998, was given limited legislative and executive powers. Because of ongoing ruptures in the peace process, however, the British government has suspended Northern Ireland’s assembly and executive committee several times since 1999.\n\nEach part of the United Kingdom has a distinct system of local government. The local governments have very few legislative powers and must act within the framework of laws passed by the central Parliament (and, in Scotland, by the Scottish Parliament). Depending on the region, local governments may be responsible for providing such services as garbage disposal, water supplies, sewerage, and street cleaning. Some of them also administer the police and fire services as well as education, certain health services, and housing. Income for the operation of local government comes partly from the national government and partly from rates (property taxes).\n\nParts of the United Kingdom have as many as three levels, or tiers, of local government, each with its own responsibilities, whereas other areas have two tiers or only a single tier. England has a combination of systems, some with multiple tiers. There are 34 counties, which are subdivided into lower-level units known as districts, boroughs, or cities. England also contains 46 administrative units called unitary authorities, which are not subdivided into smaller units but instead constitute a single tier of local government. England’s six metropolitan counties are divided into 36 metropolitan boroughs. Greater London has its own administrative unit, the Greater London Authority. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have single-tier systems of local government. Scotland is divided into 32 unitary authorities, called council areas, and Wales has 22 unitary authorities, called counties or county boroughs. Northern Ireland is divided into 26 districts.\n\nInternational Relations\n\nThe foreign policy of the United Kingdom reflects the country’s global interests. The United Kingdom has historically worked closely with other countries in Europe and overseas, especially the United States, on a range of issues.\n\nThe United Kingdom was a founding member of the United Nations (UN) and is one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council (along with China, France, Russia, and the United States). The United Kingdom is one of the leading financial contributors to the UN. The United Kingdom was also a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a military alliance of numerous European countries, the United States, and Canada. NATO members have pledged to respond collectively to an armed attack against another member.\n\nThe United Kingdom belongs to several international economic organizations. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) aims to stimulate economic progress and world trade. Along with seven other leading industrialized countries, the United Kingdom is a member of the Group of Eight (G8), which meets annually to discuss economic issues as well as a range of other topics, such as terrorism, human rights, and climate change. The United Kingdom also participates in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the World Bank.\n\nThe United Kingdom joined the organization that became the European Union (EU) in 1973. Many Britons, however, were reluctant EU members. The United Kingdom did not participate in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), a group of EU countries that share a common currency, the euro. The British government chose not to join the EMU because of its belief that membership was not in the country’s economic interest. In June 2016, in the face of growing opposition to EU membership, Britain held a national referendum to decide whether the country should remain in the organization. Some 52 percent of British voters chose to leave, setting the stage for the United Kingdom to become the first country to do so.\n\nThrough its membership in the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom maintains ties with many of its former colonies. Other organizations to which the United Kingdom belongs include the Council of Europe, which seeks to protect democracy and human rights and to promote European unity, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a regional security organization.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first union of separate states in the British Isles took place in 1301, when Wales was joined to England by the creation of the title of prince of Wales for the son of Edward I of England. Wales was not officially incorporated with England, however, until 1536. In 1603, when Queen Elizabeth I died, James VI of Scotland became king of England (as James I), uniting Scotland and England under one ruler and creating the so-called Union of the Crowns. Despite this unification, Scotland retained its own parliament until 1707, when the Act of Union formally united its parliament with England’s to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain. From then on, the government and parliament in London were called British rather than English. (For history before 1707, see England; Scotland; Wales.)\n\nThe new British Parliament was divided between two main political parties, the Whigs and the Tories. The Whigs had become important in the late 1600s and had been largely responsible for getting rid of James II and bringing in William and Mary from the Netherlands to be king and queen. The original Tories are sometimes said to have been the Cavaliers (supporters of Charles I) of the English Civil War, and some Tories later supported the cause of Charles I’s son, James II, and opposed William and Mary. However, most Tories had joined with the Whigs in welcoming them. By this time it was only the extreme Tories, called Jacobites, who still wanted to restore James II or his son James Edward Stuart to the throne. The Jacobites organized two rebellions, in 1715 and 1745, but were crushed on both occasions.\n\nWalpole, Britain’s First Prime Minister\n\nThe Stuart royal line came to an end in 1714 when Queen Anne died, since none of her 17 children survived her. She was succeeded by the nearest Protestant heir, George I, a prince of the house of Hanover, a small state in Germany. His accession to the throne marked the beginning of the Georgian age of British history, named for a series of four kings called George. This era lasted from 1714 to 1830, through the reigns of George I, George II, George III, and George IV.\n\nGeorge I did not speak English, and he was so wrapped up in his beloved Hanover that he took little interest in British affairs. He soon began to stay away from meetings of his inner council, or cabinet, and left the government in the hands of Sir Robert Walpole, the able Whig leader. George II, who ruled 1727–60, also stayed away from meetings of his ministers. Walpole made himself supreme in the government, selected his colleagues, and insisted they work with him or leave the cabinet. He thus became the first prime minister.\n\nWalpole promoted trade and commerce and strove to avoid war. But in 1739 the British people became aroused over the story of Robert Jenkins, a sea captain, who claimed the Spaniards had boarded his ship and cut off his ear. Walpole was persuaded to declare war against Spain in 1739—the War of Jenkins’ Ear. He resigned when this war merged into another continental war, the War of the Austrian Succession, in America called King George’s War. When peace was made, in 1748, the real issue—whether France or Britain was to prevail in India and North America—was still unsettled.\n\nBritain Wins French Territory\n\nFrom 1756 to 1763 Britain fought France in the Seven Years’ War. This war brought to the fore a leader of genius, William Pitt, earl of Chatham. He carried on the struggle against France in America, Africa, and India, as well as in Europe and on the sea. The war cost France almost all its territory in North America and India and vastly extended Britain’s empire. Horace Walpole wrote to Sir Horace Mann, in Italy: “You would not know your country again. You left it a private little island living upon its means. You will find it the capital of the world.”\n\nThe American Revolution\n\nBefore the Seven Years’ War ended, George III began his 60-year reign, 1760–1820. Determined to “be a king” and quite unfit to be one, he got rid of Pitt and put his own Tory friends in power.\n\nThe Tory government imposed new taxes on the American Colonies. The colonists insisted the British Parliament had no right to tax them without their consent. Pitt and Edmund Burke counseled compromise, but George III and his ministers obstinately insisted on their course. Troops were sent to enforce the decrees, and the colonists met force with force. On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted a Declaration of Independence. Two years later France entered the war on the side of the colonists. The Americans finally won their independence, and Britain lost the most valuable part of its colonial empire.\n\nGeorge III’s attempt at personal rule was now completely discredited. Parliament regained its leadership. William Pitt, second son of the earl of Chatham, became prime minister in 1783 and held the position for 17 years.\n\nBritain’s Classical Age\n\nThe numerous wars of the 18th century were fought with small professional armies and hardly disturbed the even tenor of life in Britain. Even the loss of the American Colonies was little felt. Britain still dominated the seas, and its mariners and traders soon built a second empire greater than the old. Before the century ended, the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution were to produce tremendous upheavals. Until the storm broke, Britain was quiet and settled.\n\nThe years 1740–80 were Britain’s classical age—an age of art and elegance, of enlightenment and religious tolerance. Wealth and leisure became more widely diffused. In town and country the middle class put up comfortable, dignified homes in the Queen Anne and Georgian styles. Into them went furniture designed by Thomas Chippendale, Thomas Sheraton, and the Adam brothers, and beautiful china, glass, and silver plate made by skilled English handicraftsmen. The dress of the age was extravagant. Men wore bright-colored silk coats, waistcoats, and breeches; women appeared in hoopskirts and elaborate headdresses or high pompadours. The three great portrait painters of the age—Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, and George Romney—pictured the fashionable aristocrats, while William Hogarth caricatured both the fashionable and the common people. Alexander Pope, a bitter satirist, was the leading poet of the age. But the most characteristic literary figure was Samuel Johnson, who gathered with other writers in London’s coffeehouses to discuss and debate.\n\nThe government was little concerned with reform. Individuals, however, were showing a growing sensitivity to the wretched condition of the poor. Hundreds of charity schools, Sunday schools, and hospitals were founded, all at private expense. John Howard made prison reform his life’s work.\n\nMeanwhile, the British Empire profited greatly from slavery. The slave trade, in which millions of Africans were captured and transported to the Americas to be sold as slaves, was vital to Britain’s colonial economy in the Americas. In the 1780s, at perhaps the peak of the slave trade, some 78,000 Africans were forcibly taken to the Americas each year. About half of them were transported by the ships of British merchants. The slave trade brought wealth to several British ports, notably London, Bristol, Liverpool, and Glasgow. As part of what is known as the triangular trade, British slave ships departed from these ports loaded with British manufactured goods. The ships sailed to western Africa, where the goods were traded for enslaved Africans. The British ships carried the slaves to the Americas, where the slaves were traded for money or for sugar, molasses, rum, tobacco, cotton, or other plantation crops. The port cities grew and flourished, as local merchants traded in the colonial products. Bristol also prospered as a processing center for sugar and tobacco from the colonies.\n\nUltimately, William Wilberforce and others set in motion an abolition campaign that was to free the slaves in all the British colonies by 1833. The new humanitarian spirit was quickened by the Methodist movement, a tremendous religious revival led by John Wesley.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution\n\nBritain now entered upon the greatest revolution in all history. It began with inventions in the textile industry—John Kay’s flying shuttle, to speed up weaving, and James Hargreaves’s spinning jenny, for making yarn. These inventions transformed the textile industry, which had seen almost no change for thousands of years. By 1781 James Watt had developed a steam engine to run these and other machines. During the next 15 years cotton manufactures trebled. The great Industrial Revolution was under way.\n\nA revolution in agriculture also began in the 18th century. In the time of Queen Anne, British landowners began to devote their wealth and personal attention to improving methods of cultivation. On their enclosed fields they practiced scientific rotation of crops and pasture and new methods of draining, drilling, sowing, and fertilizing. They began to grow root crops (turnips and potatoes) in fields instead of in small gardens. By selective breeding and proper winter feeding of stock they doubled the average weight of cattle and sheep.\n\nImproved Nutrition and Transportation\n\nFresh beef and mutton replaced salt meat in the winter diet. Scurvy and other skin diseases, prevalent in earlier centuries, grew rare even among the poor. The increasing knowledge of medicine combined with better nutrition to bring about a sharp drop in the death rate—from 33 in a thousand in 1830 to 23 at the end of the century. As a consequence population increased enormously.\n\nGreat improvements in inland transport accompanied the revolutions in industry and agriculture. In Queen Anne’s reign coal was still carried on packhorses. Roads were so poor that wheels stuck in the mud or broke on hard, dry ruts and huge stones. The government still took little interest in road building. Private initiative supplied the need. Turnpike companies laced the land with roads and made their profit by collecting fees at tollgates. Heavy wagons lumbered over the new turnpikes, and light stagecoaches sped along them at 10 miles (16 kilometers) an hour, stopping at coaching inns for new relays of fast horses. In 1750 a great era of canal building began. Before the end of the century the land was interlaced with a network of waterways. Like the roads, the canals were built for profit by private companies.\n\nBritain’s threefold revolution was accomplished by private initiative. Individualism, the spirit of the age, freed people’s minds and energies. Yet many government restrictions still shackled industry and commerce. Adam Smith, creator of the science of political economy, called attention to the harmful economic effect of what he believed was bad government policy. Complete freedom of industry and trade, he said, would unleash even greater productive energy. His ideas, published in Wealth of Nations (1776), gave direction to the new industrial age.\n\nChallenge of Napoleon\n\nThe outbreak of the French Revolution ended the harmony of 18th-century Britain. Class faced class in bitter controversy. Thomas Paine upheld the revolutionists in a stirring appeal to the masses, The Rights of Man. Edmund Burke eloquently voiced the attitude of conservative Englishmen: “The French,” he declared, “have shown themselves the ablest architects of ruin who have hitherto existed in the world.”\n\nSupporters of the British monarchy were horrified when France set up a republic and executed Louis XVI. George III went into mourning and expelled the French envoy. France declared war, and Britain promptly joined the coalition of European monarchs against the new French republic. The war dragged on without much result until the young general Napoleon Bonaparte began to win amazing victories. By 1797 Britain was left to carry on the war alone. Britain, weak on land, was supreme on the sea. Admiral Horatio Nelson’s victory of the Nile (1798) gave the British Navy control of the Mediterranean and secured the route to India. At Trafalgar (1805) Nelson annihilated the French fleet. Napoleon, victorious on the Continent, was unable to invade the island kingdom, so he sought to ruin the “race of shopkeepers” by forbidding Europe to trade with Britain. Britain countered by blockading all European ports controlled by Napoleon. The United States, exasperated by Britain’s interference with its commerce, declared war on Britain in 1812.\n\nBritain meanwhile had built up an army, led by the duke of Wellington. Wellington first drove the French out of Spain. In 1815 he commanded the British forces at the Battle of Waterloo, which destroyed Napoleon’s army. Before the year ended, a British ship carried off Napoleon to an island prison.\n\nEffects of the War with France\n\nTriumph over France brought Britain national glory and financial profit. Britain expanded its empire and secured its control over sea routes. The increased demand for British goods stimulated commerce and quickened the pace of the Industrial Revolution. British blast furnaces and textile mills supplied munitions and clothes not only for the armies of Britain but for its allies as well.\n\nEnglish poetry reached its highest point since the age of Shakespeare. The ideas of the French Revolution ended the Classical Age on the Continent as well as in Britain and gave birth to a new back-to-nature movement in art and literature called Romanticism. The Romanticists extolled emotion as the Classicists had reason. They sought the beautiful in nature or in medieval art rather than in classical models.\n\nChanges appeared also in dress and morals. Women ceased to powder their hair. Men discarded wigs and cut their hair short. Wool and cotton began to replace silks, satins, and velvets for both men and women. The reformers of the age sent missionaries into foreign lands, but they took little interest in the increasing wretchedness of Britain’s poor.\n\nThe war swelled the fortunes of landlords, merchants, and manufacturers. To the poor it brought misery. Men and women toiled 12 to 18 hours a day in mines and factories. Wages were at starvation levels. Child labor was widespread. Laissez-faire (from a French term, meaning “let it alone”), the rough beginning of a free market economy, was becoming the order of the day in industry. The new freedom, unfortunately, did not extend to the working classes. They were forbidden to hold meetings, to organize unions, even to publish pamphlets. When workers rioted and smashed the new machines, the government made machine breaking a capital crime. Fourteen Luddites (so called after their leader, King Ludd, who may have been real or imaginary) were put to death in Yorkshire in 1811.\n\nInspired by the revolt of the French peasants, the Irish rebelled against English rule in 1798. In 1800 Pitt succeeded in bringing Ireland into a union with Great Britain similar to that between England and Scotland. The Act of Union went into force on January 1, 1801, creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The mass of the Irish, however, being Catholics, were still excluded from the government. George III allowed only Church-of-England Irish to sit in Parliament.\n\nThe Coming of Democracy\n\nThe factory system made tremendous changes in the social structure. Two new classes had appeared—the capitalists, or entrepreneurs, who owned the factories and machines, and the mass of the workers, who were dependent upon the capitalists for employment. Large manufacturing cities had risen in the north, close to the coalfields. Many of these cities had no representation in Parliament because no new boroughs had been created to send up members since the time of Charles II. In the south of England, Tory proprietors of boroughs with few or no inhabitants (called pocket boroughs or rotten boroughs) continued to send representatives. Cornwall sent as many members to the House of Commons as all Scotland.\n\nThe spirit of reform was gradually making itself felt. The philosopher Jeremy Bentham made utility the test of law and said government should promote “the greatest happiness of the greatest number” by scientific legislation. Philosophic radicals such as James Mill advocated a laissez-faire individualism. Robert Owen showed in his New Lanark mills in Scotland that good hours, good wages, and healthy factory conditions could be made to pay.\n\nWilliam Cobbett, a radical journalist, led a campaign for universal suffrage because he believed workmen could improve their condition only by achieving the right to vote. The great industrial city of Manchester had no parliamentary representation. In 1819 a crowd of 60,000 assembled on St. Peter’s Field to choose a “legislative representative.” Mounted soldiers charged into the crowd, killed 11 persons, and wounded many. This Peterloo Massacre aroused great indignation and gave the deathblow to the old Toryism.\n\nThe Regency and the Trend to Reform\n\nGeorge III became insane in his later years and blind as well. For nine years before his death his incompetent eldest son governed as prince regent. (This period, 1811–20, is therefore known as the Regency.) On his father’s death, the prince regent became King George IV.\n\nThe more progressive Tories now began a series of reforms that opened a new era. Trade unions were partially legalized in 1825. Catholics were admitted to Parliament—after a struggle of many years—by the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829. Harsh criminal laws were reformed, reducing capital offenses to about a dozen. (In 1800, 200 offenses had been punishable by death.) In 1829 Robert Peel set up, for the first time in history, a civilian police force. Started in London, it spread quickly to other cities. The people called the police by either of Peel’s names—bobbies or peelers.\n\nWilliam IV, brother of George IV, began his short reign in 1830. The reform of Parliament had by now become the burning issue. Extreme Tories, led by the duke of Wellington, stood fast against it. Reform groups in Parliament, including the moderate Tories, drew together and supported Earl Grey, the Whig leader. Wellington’s government fell and the Whigs came into power. Lord John Russell introduced a strong reform bill. In the face of tremendous opposition in the House of Lords, Parliament passed the Reform Act of 1832.\n\nParliamentary Reform\n\nThe Reform Act created 43 new boroughs and deprived the rotten boroughs of their representatives in Parliament. The battle for universal suffrage, however, was still to be fought. The Reform Act slightly increased the number of voters by lowering the property qualifications; but the mass of the working people were still too poor to vote.\n\nDuring the 1830s the Tories dropped their somewhat discredited name and became known as the Conservative Party. The free-trade Conservatives (Peelites) gradually merged with the Whigs, who were to become the new Liberal Party. Liberalism in the 19th century meant individualism. The true Liberal of that day championed freedom of thought and religion, freedom of trade, freedom of contract between the individual employer and the individual workman, and unrestricted competition. The party was made up chiefly of the industrial middle class.\n\nThe Victorian Age\n\nWilliam IV died in 1837, in the seventh year of his reign, and Victoria, his 18-year-old niece, became queen of the United Kingdom. Three years later she married her cousin Albert, a German prince. As prince consort, Albert gave valuable aid to the queen until his death in 1861.\n\nThe young girl entered eagerly upon her new duties. Her long reign, 1837–1901, was to be immensely creative in literature and science, and before its close Britain reached the first place among nations in wealth and power. In the first years of her rule, however, the country seemed to be almost on the verge of revolution.\n\nA series of bad harvests, beginning in 1837, continued into the Hungry Forties. England suffered a wheat famine, Ireland a potato famine. A high tariff on grain (called corn in England) kept out foreign wheat. The price of bread soared. A new Poor Law (1834) had ended the outdoor relief for paupers that had been begun in the time of Queen Elizabeth I. The workhouses that took its place (described in Charles Dickens’s novel Oliver Twist) were more dreaded than jails. Wages were miserably low. A tremendous migration began from the British Isles to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.\n\nA group of reformers called Chartists drafted in 1838 a bill called the People’s Charter, calling for universal male suffrage. Meanwhile an Anti-Corn Law League had been formed in 1836 to campaign against the Corn Laws, which restricted the import and export of grain. The group advocated the free entry of foreign wheat to feed the poor. Sir Robert Peel, the Conservative prime minister, was finally converted to their view, and in 1846 he put through Parliament a bill repealing the Corn Laws. Wheat at once poured in from overseas. Prosperity returned, even for the farmers. The working people now began to turn their attention to the new trade unions and to the cooperative movement, started in 1844 by the Rochdale Pioneers.\n\nFree Trade and Prosperity\n\nThe success of the Corn Law repeal encouraged the government to remove the tariff on other foods and on the raw materials needed by manufacturers. With free trade, Britain entered upon its period of greatest prosperity. Iron and steel output expanded greatly. Steam and machinery came to be used increasingly in every kind of manufacturing process. A tremendous boom in railway building caused many old posting inns to fall into disuse. By 1848 a large part of the new trackage was paralleled by telegraph wires. “Penny postage,” introduced throughout the British Isles in 1840, provided a cheap and uniform postage rate prepaid with an adhesive stamp. Commerce was set free in 1849 by the repeal of the old Navigation Laws, which had permitted only British ships to carry goods between different parts of the empire. The application of steam power to oceangoing vessels stimulated the growth of the merchant marine and the navy. Commerce expanded enormously. In 1851 the country celebrated its industrial progress in the first great international fair, called the Great Exhibition.\n\nThe government began to take more interest in the empire, which provided the manufacturers with both markets and raw materials. The Crimean War (1854–56) was fought to protect British and French imperial interests against Russia’s threatened advance toward the Mediterranean and India. After helping the British East India Company put down the Sepoy Revolt in India (1857), Parliament deprived the company of its political powers and transferred the government of India to the British crown.\n\nWider Suffrage and Imperialism\n\nThe Reform Act of 1832 had benefited only the middle class. In 1867 Parliament took another long step toward democracy by putting through the second Reform Act. This gave the vote to almost all adult males in the towns. The bill had been introduced by Benjamin Disraeli, a Conservative. Nevertheless the new voters, many of them workingmen, supported William Gladstone, a Liberal. With Gladstone’s first and greatest ministry, 1868–74, an era of reform set in.\n\nThe Education Act of 1870 set up elementary schools financed in part by the government. In the same year competitive examinations were introduced for employment in the civil service. The Trade Union Act of 1871 gave full legal recognition to trade unions. In 1872 the secret ballot was introduced in parliamentary elections.\n\nImperialism came into the ascendancy in 1874 with Benjamin Disraeli’s Conservative ministry. Disraeli obtained for Britain financial control of the Suez Canal, key to Britain’s eastern empire. In 1876 he had Queen Victoria declared empress of India. When Russia defeated Turkey and advanced close to Constantinople, he called the Congress of Berlin (1878), which checked Russian ambitions.\n\nDuring Gladstone’s second ministry, 1880–85, a third Reform Bill was enacted, in 1884. This gave rural voters the same voting privileges as the townspeople. The “Grand Old Man” went down to defeat because he championed Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish question split the Liberal Party into Home Rulers and Unionists. The Liberal Unionists, led by Joseph Chamberlain, gave their support to the Conservative Party because they wanted no separate parliament for Ireland. A coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Unionists took office.\n\nDuring the three ministries of Robert Salisbury, the government brought the navy to a high state of efficiency and secured for Britain the lion’s share in the partition of Africa. To stimulate interest in the empire, it celebrated the 50th and 60th years of Victoria’s rule (1887 and 1897) with magnificent “jubilees” attended by Indian princes and representatives of all the far-flung dominions and colonies. Before the century ended, the British were engaged in the South African War (1899–1902) against the Dutch farmers (Boers) in South Africa. After some humiliating defeats, Britain won the war and annexed the two Boer republics, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. Following annexation, Britain granted self-government to South Africa under the leadership of Jan Smuts, a Boer. Before the war was over, Queen Victoria died (1901), ending the longest reign in British history. Edward VII, her son, succeeded her.\n\nAn Age of Peace and Progress\n\nThe Victorians called their age “modern” and thought it superior to all past centuries. It was an age that envisioned an indefinite future of progress with peace and plenty. Wages and working conditions steadily improved. Dividends from British industry and from foreign investments supported a leisure class. The population of the United Kingdom increased in the last half of the 19th century from 28 million to nearly 42 million people. The age was extraordinarily creative in literature and science. The poets Alfred Tennyson and Robert Browning expressed the Victorians’ optimism and religious feeling. But it was chiefly an age of the novel, represented by William Thackeray and Charles Dickens, and the essay. In pure science, Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution had worldwide influence.\n\nThe Victorians did not excel in music or in painting. Architecture actually deteriorated, owing in part to the progress in technology that caused a breakdown of craftsmanship and tradition. Cheap manufactured knickknacks cluttered Victorian parlors.\n\nThe Labour Party and the New Liberalism\n\nWhen Edward VII came to the throne, in 1901, Britain was no longer the only “workshop of the world.” The Industrial Revolution was now in full swing in other countries. Germany, the United States, and Japan competed strongly with Britain in foreign markets. Unemployment soon became chronic. Serious unrest stirred the working classes.\n\nGermany not only competed with British industry but had become the greatest military power on the Continent. In 1900 it began to expand its navy, challenging British control of the seas. To meet this threat, Britain abandoned its “splendid isolation” and entered into an alliance with Japan in 1902. In 1904 it concluded the Entente Cordiale with France, and in 1907 it reached a similar agreement with Russia.\n\nIn 1900 the British Trades Union Congress held a conference to form a new political party. Delegates were invited from various socialist organizations. Chief among these was the Fabian Society. The Fabians were middle-class intellectuals who had been advocating national ownership of land and industry since 1883. The new party became known at once as the Labour Party.\n\nFabian teachings had been spreading also in the Liberal Party. The “new” Liberals of the 20th century no longer advocated a policy of laissez-faire in government. They had turned against individualism and classical economics and favored extending the powers of the state to abolish poverty. They still held to the 19th-century Liberal doctrine of free trade. On this issue they won the election of 1906. Labour Party representatives supported the Liberal program of social legislation.\n\nLloyd George’s Social Legislation\n\nThe driving power of the new government was David Lloyd George, chancellor of the exchequer under Prime Minister Herbert Asquith from 1908 to 1916. In 1908 he put through Parliament an Old Age Pensions Act granting pensions to all elderly people with a small income. On January 1, 1909, more than half a million men and women drew their first pensions.\n\nPensions and the constantly expanding navy vastly increased the expenses of the British government. In 1909 Lloyd George proposed heavy taxes on the wealthy and a new tax on land. The House of Lords rejected his budget.\n\nA constitutional struggle took place that ended in the Parliament Act of 1911, which stripped the House of Lords of much of its power. The way was now open for the passage of a National Insurance Act (1912) to pay wage earners unemployment and sickness benefits.\n\nIn 1910, in the midst of the parliamentary struggle, Edward VII died. He was succeeded by his only surviving son, George V.\n\nWorld War I and Its Aftermath\n\nOn the eve of World War I the people of Great Britain were concerned with militant suffragettes, workingmen’s strikes, and a crisis in Ireland over Home Rule. War broke out with startling suddenness on August 1, 1914. Britain declared war three days later, and the British dominions and colonies were automatically drawn in. British and empire troops fought in France and Belgium, at Gallipoli, and in Palestine, while the navy held the seas and prevented food and supplies from reaching Germany.\n\nLloyd George became the war leader in 1916 when he succeeded Asquith as head of the Nationalist government, a coalition of Liberal and Conservative parties. The peace treaties, which he negotiated, added more territory to the vast British Empire in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. The United Kingdom itself, however, was made smaller by a treaty (1921) granting self-government to the southern part of Ireland as a dominion of the British Commonwealth. The six northern counties of Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom under the name Northern Ireland.\n\nIn 1918 Lloyd George’s government passed an Education Act abolishing all fees in state-supported elementary schools. The same year it extended male suffrage and granted the right to vote to single women over 30 and married women over 35 who met certain property qualifications. In 1919 women became eligible for Parliament. Universal adult suffrage was not achieved until 1928.\n\nThe war had vastly increased the national debt. By imposing heavy income taxes, the government managed to balance the budget while increasing payments to the unemployed. Industrial peace, however, did not return. After a few years of prosperity, exports declined and unemployment rose. A wave of strikes engulfed the country.\n\nThe Conservatives deserted the Nationalist coalition and defeated the Liberals in 1922. The Labour Party (which had come out openly for socialism in 1918) voted with the Liberals to turn out the Conservatives, and in 1924 Ramsay MacDonald was chosen to head Britain’s first Labour government. He remained in office only nine months, going down to defeat partly because he advocated closer relations with Russia.\n\nUnder Stanley Baldwin as prime minister, the Conservatives returned to power for almost five years (1924–29). Again unemployment relief was increased. The cause of unemployment was the shrinking world market for British coal, textiles, and steel. The Labour Party believed full employment could be attained by government ownership of basic industries. The unions called a general strike in 1926 to force through their demands. The strike was quickly ended except for the coal miners, the most distressed of the workers.\n\nThe regular election of 1929 favored the Labour Party, and MacDonald formed a cabinet. The world depression dislocated international trade and currencies and plunged Britain into a financial crisis. The number of unemployed mounted to nearly 3 million. The leaders of the three parties then formed a coalition cabinet called the National government. MacDonald retained the premiership, but he now owed his support chiefly to the Conservatives. The Labour Party had expelled him when his government introduced drastic economies. He resigned in 1935 and Baldwin again became prime minister.\n\nThree Kings in One Year\n\nGeorge V died in January 1936, and his eldest son, Edward, the popular prince of Wales, came to the throne as Edward VIII. Before his coronation, the king announced his intention of marrying an American, Mrs. Wallis Warfield Simpson, as soon as her second divorce became absolute. Parliament and the dominions’ governments disapproved. Edward abdicated on December 11, 1936, and his brother, the duke of York, was proclaimed king as George VI.\n\nBritain Abandons Free Trade\n\nSince the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, Britain had been practically a free-trade country. Almost all other nations had put up tariffs that handicapped British exporters. When the world depression caused a slump in trade, the dominions asked Britain to import more raw materials from them. In return, they would favor British manufactures. In 1932 Parliament passed the Import Duties Act. The act imposed a basic tariff of 10 percent on all goods not specifically exempted. This paved the way for the Ottawa imperial conference in the same year, which worked out “preferential” tariffs within the empire.\n\nThe Statute of Westminster (1931) had recognized the complete control by the dominions of their foreign as well as domestic affairs. The Ottawa conference strengthened the ties of the Commonwealth by binding the members into a closer economic union. This, however, did not check the growing nationalism in India and other Asian dependencies.\n\nWorld War II\n\nAdolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933 and soon began to rearm the country. Britain, absorbed in domestic troubles, was unprepared for war. Hitler seized Austria in March 1938 and then made demands on Czechoslovakia. Britain, along with France, adopted a policy of appeasement, hoping Hitler’s demands could be satisfied short of war. Neville Chamberlain, who had become prime minister in 1937, believed he had achieved “peace for our time” when Hitler pledged at Munich (September 30, 1938) that he had “no further territorial claims in Europe.” Six months later Hitler broke the pact and took over most of Czechoslovakia.\n\nBritain joined with France in guaranteeing Poland’s independence. Hitler took no action until after the Soviet Union signed a peace pact with Germany (August 24, 1939). Eight days later (September 1) his army marched into Poland. Britain and France declared war two days later.\n\nOn May 10, 1940, Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands. On the same day Winston Churchill succeeded Chamberlain as prime minister. Britain lost most of its armament in the famed retreat from the Dunkirk beaches. When France fell in June the British began their “year alone” and suffered the furious onslaught of German bombers in what was called the Blitz. “Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty,” said Churchill, “and so bear ourselves that if the British Commonwealth and Empire last for a thousand years, men will say, ‘This was their finest hour.’ ”\n\nThe Battle of Britain was a victory that ranked in importance with the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. Britain was saved from invasion by its navy and its air force. In the years that followed, British and Commonwealth troops fought on the far-flung battlefields of this war. On the home front, Churchill and his ministers remained in London even as the bombs fell. Throughout the war they huddled with military leaders to plan the war effort in the secret Cabinet War Rooms, a cluster of offices in the basement of a building near Parliament. The royal family also stayed in London, even after Buckingham Palace was bombed. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited bombed-out areas and broadcast messages that inspired the people during the years of hardship. Civilians contributed to the war effort in a variety of ways. They observed blackouts during air raids, served as air raid wardens to assist others during attacks, and took part in a national rationing program. People across the country also grew their own food as part of the government’s Dig for Victory campaign. (For British military action in the war, see World War II.)\n\nSix years of war cost the United Kingdom 397,762 in dead and missing and thousands of civilian casualties. Millions of properties were damaged or destroyed. Britain received extensive aid from the United States through the lend-lease program but met most of its huge war expenditures by selling overseas investments, by large overseas borrowing, by domestic loans, and by a tremendous increase in taxation.\n\nBritain’s Socialist Revolution\n\nIn 1945 Britain held its first general election in 10 years. The Labour Party received an overwhelming majority. Clement Attlee, its leader, succeeded Churchill as prime minister. The party was elected on a socialist platform and at once embarked on a nationalization program. The state bought out shareholders in the Bank of England, the coal mines, all inland transport, aviation, gas, and electricity. It subsidized housing and food. It put through the “cradle-to-grave” social insurance plan drawn up under Churchill’s ministry. It also set up a National Health Service to provide free medical care.\n\nThe postwar government faced grave financial difficulties. It cut imports to bare necessities and ruled that almost the entire output of Britain’s factories must be sold abroad instead of in the home market. It fixed prices, rationed scarce goods, limited wages, and called on people to practice austerity.\n\nTo offset the loss of income from foreign investments, Britain needed to double its exports above the prewar level. In 1949 the postwar sellers’ market ended, and the high prices of British products caused a swift drop in exports. The government scaled down the value of the British pound from $4.03 to $2.80. This made it possible for British manufacturers to sell their goods in dollar markets but increased the price of necessary imports from dollar countries. Foreign loans and credits, especially Marshall Plan aid from the United States, helped in financial crises and in the task of rehabilitating overage and war-damaged industrial plants.\n\nDecline in World Power\n\nThe British Empire suffered major losses in territory and world influence in the years 1947–49. Britain, in effect, had no choice but to withdraw from colonial territories it no longer had the military and economic power to control. India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) became self-governing nations within the Commonwealth, and Burma (now Myanmar) gained complete independence. In the Middle East, Britain withdrew from Transjordan, Palestine, and all Egypt except the Suez Canal territory. Éire (southern Ireland) cut all ties with Britain and took the name the Republic of Ireland.\n\nOn the continent of Europe, Britain no longer held its historic balance of power. For centuries it had helped prevent a strong nation from dominating the continent by throwing its weight toward that nation’s rivals. Now the Soviet Union controlled all eastern Europe. The only other world power was the United States. It used its influence to organize the nations of western Europe for cooperation in defense and economic progress. Britain joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), formed in 1949 to meet the threat of Soviet aggression, and expanded its armament production. With United Nations forces, British troops participated in the Korean War in 1950–53.\n\nConservative Government\n\nThe Conservatives returned to power in 1951. Winston Churchill, then 76, again became prime minister. In 1952 he presided over the accession of a new monarch, Elizabeth II, upon the death of George VI.\n\nIn the 1950s many of Britain’s postwar problems remained unsolved, but its economy rode on a wave of prosperity. Manufacturing output exceeded prewar production early in the decade. By 1959 the output of steel had risen 55 percent above that of 1938. Between 1949 and 1959 domestic production increased and exports rose by 40 percent. Most Britons in the early 1960s were earning twice as much as they had been in 1949. The Conservatives lifted certain controls set by the Labour government. In 1953 they denationalized iron and steel and trucking. Food rationing ended in 1954. Nevertheless, during this period of expansion, periods of inflation hurt exports and caused strikes.\n\nChurchill resigned as prime minister in 1955 and was succeeded by Sir Anthony Eden. Eden was widely criticized for his handling of the incident known as the Suez Crisis. Britain withdrew its last troops from the Suez Canal zone in June 1956, according to an earlier agreement. In July Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal. Britain and France protested vigorously. In October Israeli forces invaded Egypt. After demanding a cease-fire between them, Britain and France sent forces into the canal zone. They were branded as aggressors in the United Nations. The Anglo-French troops withdrew as a United Nations task force moved in. In January 1957 Eden resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Harold Macmillan.\n\nIn 1959 Britain helped found the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The more tightly knit European Economic Community (EEC) made greater economic gains, however, and the Macmillan government sought EEC entry to stimulate Britain’s trade. Since the tariff agreements between Commonwealth countries conflicted with EEC regulations, long negotiations and compromises were necessary. France vetoed Britain’s bid for EEC membership in 1963 and again in 1967.\n\nThe death knell of colonialism sounded in the 1950s and 1960s as most of the foreign territories of the European powers won independence. The British had trained their colonies for self-government, so they usually parted with Britain as friends, and the new nations remained in the Commonwealth. A notable exception was South Africa, which became a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1961. Throughout the 1960s more than 20 British colonies and trusteeships in Africa, Asia, South America, and the West Indies achieved independence.\n\nShifts in Power\n\nIn October 1963 Macmillan resigned because of ill health. He was succeeded by another Conservative, Sir Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home. Home’s government lasted only a year before Labour’s Harold Wilson was elected prime minister, ending 13 years of Conservative rule. Wilson was unable to stop an illegal declaration of independence by the white minority government of the British colony of Rhodesia. Wilson’s government outlawed capital punishment and began the Open University for continuing education. In the late 1960s Wilson faced an outbreak of violence between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. His popularity declined in the last years of his term, largely because of continuing economic problems.\n\nAfter a Conservative victory in 1970, Edward Heath took office as prime minister. In 1972, because of continuing conflict in Northern Ireland, Heath suspended the Northern Ireland Parliament and restored direct rule from London. Heath’s major triumph was winning French acceptance of British entry into the EEC in 1972–73. However, he proved unable to cope with Britain’s mounting economic problems, chiefly rising inflation and unemployment and a series of crippling labor strikes. A pay strike by coal miners, in the midst of a worldwide energy crisis, led Heath to call a new election in February 1974, and Wilson returned as prime minister. Wilson promptly made peace by granting the miners’ demands.\n\nFaced with severe economic challenges, Labour struggled in the 1970s. Neither Wilson nor James Callaghan, who succeeded him in April 1976, was able to meet the demands of the labor unions. A series of labor strikes in 1978–79 paralyzed hospital care, refuse collection, and other essential services. In 1979 Callaghan, who had headed a minority government for two years, became the first British prime minister since 1924 to lose office after a no-confidence motion. Margaret Thatcher, who had been the Conservative Party leader since 1975, became Britain’s first woman prime minister.\n\nThatcherism\n\nThatcher set out to end socialism in Britain. She worked to privatize nearly every publicly owned industry and to reduce government spending on such social services as health care, education, and housing. Though Thatcher was highly unpopular during the first part of her term, a world economic recovery helped to revive Britain’s economy and reduce inflation. Thatcher’s popularity soared when Britain recaptured the Falkland Islands after an Argentine invasion in the spring of 1982. Thatcher called a general election in 1983, a year earlier than required, and the Conservatives won an overwhelming victory.\n\nThatcher made the battle for power with the labor unions a hallmark of her ministry. A series of new laws debilitated labor by, for example, forbidding sympathy strikes and requiring unions to poll their members before ordering a strike. In 1984 coal miners began a nationwide strike to protest the closure of 20 or more mines that the government claimed were uneconomical. The government eventually won, and the striking miners went back to work a year later without a single concession.\n\nIn 1987 Thatcher became the first British prime minister in more than 150 years to win a third consecutive election. By 1990 she had become the longest-serving British leader of the century, but her 15-year tenure as head of the Conservative Party ended in that year. The reasons for discontent with Thatcherism ranged from her domineering personal style to the abolition of the local property tax in favor of a flat-rate community charge, or poll tax. Her resistance to integrating the British currency, the pound, into a common European currency led to the resignation of a number of Cabinet ministers. Thatcher resigned in November 1990 and was succeeded by John Major, a top minister in her cabinet. In 1992 Major led the Conservatives to victory again, extending their winning streak to four elections since 1979.\n\nRise of New Labour\n\nDuring his second term Major came under severe scrutiny from opponents inside and outside the Conservative Party. In particular, the question of British integration in the European Union (EU), the newly formed successor to the EEC, split the party. Major supported greater British integration in the EU, but many Conservatives still opposed the union. In late 1996 the Conservatives lost their majority in Parliament for the first time since they wrested control of the government from the Labour Party in 1979.\n\nAs the Conservatives splintered, they faced a serious threat from popular Labour Party leader Tony Blair. Labour had suffered repeated Parliamentary losses, and many suspected that the party had lost touch with the British voters when Blair took over its leadership in 1994. Blair refashioned the Labour Party as “New Labour,” dropping the party’s traditional but controversial socialist policies, such as the nationalization of industries. In 1997 Blair became prime minister by leading the Labour Party to a landslide victory over the Conservatives. Labour won 419 seats in Parliament, compared to only 165 seats for the Conservatives. Blair’s government was reelected with a strong majority in 2001.\n\nThe Blair government accepted some Conservative policies but also carried out several reforms. Blair eliminated all but 92 of the hereditary peers of the House of Lords in favor of appointed life peers. He organized referenda in Scotland and Wales that created autonomous assemblies, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales, to administer regional affairs. Peace talks between the British and Irish governments and the major political parties of Northern Ireland yielded the landmark Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The accord provided for an elected assembly in Northern Ireland for the first time since 1972. The process of turning over power to the Northern Ireland Assembly proved long and difficult because of ongoing disputes in the province. In 2007, however, the major Northern Irish political parties reached a historic agreement to form a power-sharing government.\n\nBritain in the 21st Century\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks against the United States in 2001, global terrorism dominated the political agenda in Britain. Blair closely allied the United Kingdom with the United States in a global war against terrorism. British troops took part in the military effort to oust Afghanistan’s Taliban regime, which was charged with harboring Osama bin Laden, who had founded al-Qaeda, the terrorist organization linked to the September 11 attacks. Some of Blair’s Labour Party colleagues opposed military action. The Blair government also faced a slowing economy and a widespread perception that public services such as health, education, and transportation had not improved under Labour leadership.\n\nStarting in late 2002, politics in Britain was dominated by Blair’s decision to support military action to oust the government of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. The Iraqi government was alleged to either have or be developing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) that might be used against Iraq’s neighbors or find their way into the hands of terrorists. The Iraq War, which began with a U.S.- and British-led attack in March 2003, divided the Labour Party and aroused strong public opposition. When military inspectors failed to uncover WMD in Iraq after the coalition drove out Saddam, the Blair government was accused of distorting intelligence used to justify the war. In 2005 Blair won another term as prime minister, but thereafter his popularity declined, largely because of the protracted war.\n\nOn July 7, 2005, London suffered a series of coordinated terrorist attacks: three bombs went off on Underground trains and another destroyed a double-decker bus. The attacks killed 52 people and injured more than 700 others. They were carried out by four suicide bombers who held British citizenship.\n\nBlair stepped down in 2007. He was succeeded by Gordon Brown, his chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nThe decline of the Labour Party continued during Brown’s tenure as prime minister. His government was hurt by a worldwide economic recession brought on by a financial crisis in late 2008. Brown also faced a scandal involving the abuse of expense accounts by members of Parliament. In the general election of May 2010, the Labour Party finished second to the Conservatives, but no party achieved a majority. The Conservatives joined with the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government—Britain’s first since World War II. David Cameron, leader of the Conservatives, became prime minister, with Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats as deputy prime minister.\n\nThe Cameron Years\n\nIn October 2010 the British government announced a five-year austerity plan aimed at reducing the country’s huge budget deficit. The plan included some of the British government’s biggest spending cuts since World War II, including reductions to welfare entitlements and the dismissal of up to 500,000 public-sector employees.\n\nIn early 2011 the Arab Spring—a series of popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa—became a focus of British foreign policy. Cameron took a particular interest in the revolt in Libya and Libyan ruler Muammar al-Qaddafi’s brutal repression of it. Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were instrumental in persuading the UN Security Council to authorize military action against Qaddafi’s forces. In March 2011 U.S. and European forces launched air strikes in Libya in an effort to disable the country’s air force and air defense systems. A week later NATO officially took command of military operations in Libya.\n\nThe British political landscape was shaken in 2013 and 2014 when the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) made dramatic gains in local elections. The UKIP was a Euroskeptic party, meaning that it opposed immigration and called for Britain’s withdrawal from the EU. In 2014 the party also won a historic first-place finish in elections for the European Parliament, marking the first time in modern British history that a party other than Labour or the Conservatives had won a national election.\n\nAs Euroskepticism gained momentum in Britain, so did the movement for independence in Scotland. In 2011 the Scottish National Party, which sought to make Scotland an independent state, won a sweeping victory in elections for the Scottish Parliament. After the election Alex Salmond, the first minister of Scotland, called for a referendum on independence. Cameron agreed to the referendum but, along with former prime minister Gordon Brown, worked to keep the United Kingdom intact. Days before the vote, Cameron, Clegg, and Labour Party leader Ed Miliband promised to increase powers for Scotland’s government if the referendum was rejected. On September 18, 2014, Scottish voters defeated the referendum, with about 55 percent voting against independence.\n\nIn foreign affairs, a new challenge arose with the emergence of the militant Sunni group known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL; also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria [ISIS]). In September 2014 Parliament voted to approve British participation in the U.S.-led air strikes against ISIL in Iraq. At the time, Cameron made clear that the action would be limited to Iraq and that Britain would not attack ISIL in Syria. The debate over military intervention in Syria was reopened, however, after terrorists connected to ISIL launched a series of attacks in Paris in November 2015. In December Parliament authorized air strikes by the British military on ISIL targets in Syria, with dozens of Labour ministers joining the Conservatives and others in voting for the measure.\n\nMeanwhile, a general election was held in May 2015. Key issues in the campaign included immigration, the government’s austerity policies, the future of the National Health Service, and Britain’s membership in the EU. Cameron attempted to address Euroskeptics in his own party and the challenge of UKIP by promising to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s relationship with the EU. He also vowed to hold a national referendum on continued EU membership by the end of 2017 if he were reelected. Despite polls suggesting that the vote would be very close, the Conservatives captured enough seats to form a majority government without the participation of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nMonths after the election Cameron proposed a series of reforms to British membership in the EU. In February 2016 the European Council, consisting of the leaders of all EU member countries, reached at least compromise agreements on most of the Cameron’s proposals. Cameron scheduled the referendum on “Brexit,” as the British exit from the EU became known, for June 23, 2016, and pledged to campaign for remaining in the organization. The campaign for EU withdrawal was led by former London mayor Boris Johnson. In the referendum some 52 percent of voters chose to leave the EU, making the United Kingdom the first country ever to do so. Cameron announced that he would resign as prime minister to allow his successor to negotiate the country’s withdrawal.\n\nWithin three weeks of the referendum, the Conservative Party narrowed the pool of candidates to replace Cameron to two—Home Secretary Theresa May and Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom. Although the campaign was expected to continue until September, it ended within days when Leadsom withdrew her candidacy. May was named the new Conservative leader and became prime minister on July 13, 2016.\n\nThe Premiership of Theresa May\n\nMay had opposed Brexit but came into office promising to see it to completion. In March 2017 Parliament authorized May to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which details the provisions under which a country can leave the EU. She did so on March 29, 2017, in a letter to the president of the European Council. The letter formally opened a two-year period of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU over the details of separation. In April 2017, May called for an early parliamentary election to be held in June. She said that its results would provide stability and certainty for Britain during its Brexit negotiations and transition out of the EU.\n\nAgainst this background, Scotland called for a new vote on whether it should break away from the United Kingdom. The majority of Scottish voters had opposed leaving the EU in the Brexit referendum. With the approval of the Scottish Assembly, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon formally requested that the British government allow Scotland to hold a new referendum on Scottish independence before Britain left the EU.\n\nOn May 22, 2017, more than 20 people were killed and dozens injured in a terrorist attack in Manchester. The attack took place at an arena following a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande, and many of the casualties were children—teenaged and younger fans of the pop star. The attacker, who detonated a homemade bomb, was killed in the blast. ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Britain since the London bombings of 2005, in which more than 50 people were killed. The Manchester bombing followed a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London on March 22, 2017, in which an attacker killed five people. Still another attack occurred in London on June 3, 2017, only days before the parliamentary election. Three attackers mowed down pedestrians with a vehicle on London Bridge and then continued their attack with knives in Borough Market, eventually killing eight people.\n\nIn the June 8, 2017, election the Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, posted a dramatic gain of 30 new seats in the House of Commons. May’s gamble to hold an early parliamentary election did not pay off. The Conservatives lost their majority and moved to form a minority government (rather than a formal coalition government) with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe central task for May’s government remained coming up with a plan for Brexit negotiations with the EU. There was wide disagreement even within the Conservative Party on a number of details related to the separation. So-called “hard” Brexiters wanted a clean break between the United Kingdom and the EU. May favored a “softer” approach that aimed at preserving economic ties with the EU.\n\nIn November 2018 the leaders of the EU’s 27 other member countries agreed to a withdrawal deal that May supported. It set a withdrawal date in March 2019 but stated that Britain would continue to follow EU rules until at least December 2020 while negotiations continued on the details of the long-term relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom. The agreement faced strong opposition in Parliament from across the political spectrum. Many people called for a new referendum on Brexit, but May refused to consider that option.\n\nThe House of Commons debated the agreement in December. Facing the likelihood of a humiliating rejection, May interrupted the debate to postpone the vote. The opposition responded by threatening to hold a vote of confidence and to call for an early election. May’s opponents in the Conservative Party scheduled a vote on her leadership of the party for December 12, 2018. Needing the votes of 159 MPs, May received 200 to survive as leader. The postponed vote on the Brexit deal was held on January 15, and Parliament defeated it by the huge margin of 432 to 202. Corbyn, the Labour opposition leader, called for a vote of confidence in May’s government to be held the next day. May survived the challenge by a vote of 325 to 306, but the turmoil continued.\n\nAfter more negotiations with European leaders, May submitted a revised plan to Parliament. The House of Commons rejected it on March 12 by a vote of 391–242. With the March 29 withdrawal date fast approaching, the EU agreed to push back the deadline to April 12. Then, following a third defeat for May’s plan in Parliament, the deadline was extended again, this time to October 31. The delay could not save May, however. In late May she announced that she would resign as Conservative Party leader on June 7. She said she would step down as prime minister once the party had chosen a new leader.\n\nBoris Johnson and Brexit\n\nIn July the Conservatives chose Boris Johnson as their new leader. Johnson succeeded May as prime minister on July 24. He vowed to complete Britain’s withdrawal from the EU by the October deadline, even if a deal had not been reached. On September 4, however, the House of Commons voted to force Johnson to request a delay of Britain’s withdrawal if he did not meet one of two requirements by October 19. The requirements were submitting an agreement on Brexit for Parliament’s approval or getting the House of Commons to approve a no-deal Brexit. Johnson was not able to fulfill either condition, so he requested that the EU extend the Brexit deadline. The EU set a new deadline of January 31, 2020.\n\nIn an attempt to get popular backing for his Brexit approach, Johnson called a snap election for December 12, 2019. He campaigned on a promise to complete Britain’s withdrawal from the EU by the new deadline. In the election the Conservatives increased their presence in the House of Commons by 48 seats, winning a total of 365 seats. It was the party’s most commanding victory in a parliamentary election since 1987. Labour, on the other hand, suffered its worst national election performance since 1935. The Labour Party won only 202 seats, a drop of 60 seats. In the wake of this loss, Corbyn announced that he would not lead the Labour Party into the next election.\n\nJohnson, having secured a solid parliamentary majority, was poised to carry out his preferred version of Brexit. Soon after the election, Parliament approved Johnson’s Brexit plan by a vote of 358 to 234. The EU gave its final approval on January 30, 2020, and Britain formally left the union the next day.\n\nAfter long and often bitter negotiations, a new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the EU was finalized at the end of 2020. The agreement specified that there would be no limits or taxes on goods traded between businesses in the United Kingdom and the EU. However, such trade would require extensive paperwork. Citizens of the United Kingdom and of the EU had previously enjoyed the freedom to live, work, and study in one another’s countries. With the new agreement that possibility would be eliminated for many people.\n\nMeanwhile, the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 had begun spreading around the world, reaching the United Kingdom in early 2020. Johnson’s government initially took a low-key approach to combating the pandemic, unlike the aggressive measures taken in much of the rest of the world. By mid-March 2020 COVID-19 was spreading rapidly in Britain. The government changed its strategy, imposing social-distancing and mask-wearing requirements. It also ordered a lockdown that included the closing of schools and businesses.\n\nAs the pandemic continued, Johnson started and stopped a series of regional stay-at-home orders, depending on the spread of the disease. Many observers criticized Johnson’s slow, unsteady response to the crisis. However, British scientists, aided by government funding, made historically rapid advances in developing a COVID vaccine. Britain began a national campaign to vaccinate its people in late 2020. Still, by mid-2022 the United Kingdom had suffered more than 175,000 COVID-19-related deaths, more than most other countries around the world.\n\nJohnson’s time as prime minister was marked by a series of scandals that ultimately led to his downfall. In late 2021 reports began surfacing that Johnson and members of his cabinet and staff had violated the terms of social-distancing orders earlier in the pandemic. They were accused of having held social gatherings at times when the government had banned such events. The resulting scandal was called “Partygate.” At first Johnson insisted that he and his staff had followed the government-issued guidelines, but he later apologized for attending an event. In January 2022 an official investigation reported that “some of the events should not have been allowed to take place.” In response, Johnson apologized to Parliament. In April he was fined for not following pandemic-related rules. He thus became the first sitting British prime minister in living memory found to have broken the law.\n\nJohnson’s public approval rating plummeted in the wake of the scandals. In addition, Britain struggled with inflated prices of fuel and groceries. In June 2022 the Conservatives called a vote of confidence to determine if Johnson would continue as party leader (and thus as prime minister). He survived as party leader, with 211 Conservative members of Parliament voting in his favor, and 148 voting against him. However, his authority collapsed within a month after a new scandal emerged. A government official was accused of misconduct, and Johnson’s initial statements regarding the scandal were found to be false. Calling for Johnson to leave office, dozens of Conservative members of Parliament and other officials resigned over the course of two days in early July. On July 7 Johnson announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader. He remained prime minister until the Conservatives selected a replacement. On September 5 the Conservatives chose Foreign Secretary Liz Truss as their leader. The next day Johnson formally resigned as prime minister, and Truss took office.\n\nJust a couple of days later, on September 8, 2022, Elizabeth II died, after having ruled as queen for 70 years. She was the longest-reigning monarch in British history. Upon her death, her eldest son became King Charles III.\n\nTruss’s tenure as prime minister proved short-lived. Her “high growth, low tax” economic plan caused great turmoil in the financial markets. As the economic crisis deepened, her government dramatically reversed course on Truss’s sweeping tax-cut proposals. Truss publicly apologized for the “mistakes” she had made. On October 20 she announced her resignation, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history.\n\nTruss’s resignation put into motion another Conservative Party leadership contest. On October 24 the Conservatives announced the selection of former chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Rishi Sunak as their new leader. Sunak succeeded Truss as prime minister the following day. He was the first person of color and first Hindu to lead Britain.\n\nA general election in July 2024 ended 14 years of Conservative rule. The Labour Party won a landslide victory, and Labour leader Keir Starmer replaced Rishi as prime minister."
