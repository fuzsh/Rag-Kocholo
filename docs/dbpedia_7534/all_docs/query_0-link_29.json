        "text": "Fairfield’s Master of Science in Accounting program offers a 30-credit master’s in accounting. Students can choose between three tracks: assurance, business analytics or taxation. Coursework covers accounting in governments, hospitals, and universities; ethics, financial statement analysis, and entity taxation.\n\nThe program not only meets these professional needs, it also addresses the educational requirements of most states for CPA certification. Students who choose the taxation track must complete at last six courses in tax (though seven are strongly advised). In addition, all students complete research coursework. The curriculum includes off time to take the CPA exam and complete paid internships. This program must be completed on a full-time basis, beginning in the summer and ending the following May. This cohort model insures a strong sense of community among all the students, as well as opportunities to work closely with the Dolan School’s accounting faculty.\n\nFairfield Dolan | MS in Accounting\n\nTraditional courses are taught as lectures/seminars. Courses offered in other formats are designed to offer the same type of classroom experience as the traditional format. Some classes use online discussion, chats, blogs, electronic portfolios, and more as ways to enhance the course experience. Classes taught fully online deliver lectures through a variety of means, and use any or all of the above methods to ensure student participation, comprehension, and performance."
