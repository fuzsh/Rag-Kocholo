AI has incredible potential to transform lives and public services such as the NHS. We have an incredible tech sector here in the UK but the Government have been too slow to capitalise on opportunity. Of course when it comes to emerging tech like AI regulation will play a central role - but it is possible to regulate without stifling innovation. Managing these risks is crucial as we continue to explore the opportunities AI will afford both now and in the future.\n\nVery excited to have had my article published in the The Young Fabians Quarterly Journal “Anticipations”.
