Fabian Society Report. 44 pages http://www.fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hungry-for-Change-web-27.10.pdf\n\nAt a national level, the report’s first recommendation is for a new cross-departmental minister to ‘coordinate action across government departments while working in partnership with devolved governments, local authorities, regulators, businesses, trade unions, civil society and those in poverty to end household food insecurity in the UK.’ (p1)\n\nAt a national level, the report recommends that ‘all governments in the UK should ensure all directly and indirectly employed public sector workers are paid at least the level of the living wage, and they should champion the voluntary living wage rates in the private sector’ (p33)\n\nThe report recommends that ‘Local authorities should establish food access plans that will identify any physical barriers to affordable, sustainable, nutritious food in their area and develop an action plan to overcome them. Local authorities should build on the work already being done by the Sustainable Food Cities Network to boost access to affordable, nutritious food in local areas.’ It specifically looks at the need to address physical inabilities to access a sufficient quantity and quality of food’ (p14) and the problem of ‘fat swamps’ in urban areas (p16).\n\nThe report makes the case for universal free school meals that conform with nutrition standards as a means of providing children from low-income households with a nutritious, hot meal (p16). It warns that the Healthy Start Scheme is at risk despite the fact that ‘evaluations of the initiative have shown it to be a valuable public health scheme that can ensure babies born into poverty in the UK are protected from poor diet related health outcomes in the crucial early months of development. Ending this scheme could also contribute to higher costs in the long term’ and adding that ‘public health initiatives are generally good value for money’ (p30)\n\nIPES-Food. 2017. ‘Unravelling the Food–Health Nexus: Addressing practices, political economy, and power relations to build healthier food systems.’ The Global Alliance for the Future of Food and IPES-Food. 120 pages\n\nhttps://futureoffood.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FoodHealthNexus_Full-Report_FINAL.pdf\n\nLeverage point 1 recommends: ‘Food systems thinking must be promoted at all levels, i.e., we must systematically bring to light the multiple connections between different health impacts, between human health and ecosystem health, between food, health, poverty, and climate change, and between social and environmental sustainability. Only [then] can we adequately assess the priorities, risks, and trade-offs underpinning our food systems.’\n\nLeverage point 2 recommends: ‘Policy processes must be up to the task of managing the complexity of food systems and the systemic health risks they generate. Integrated food policies and food strategies are required to overcome the traditional biases in sectoral policies ‘\n\n‘A range of actors — policymakers, big and small private sector firms, healthcare providers, environmental groups, consumers’ and health advocates, farmers, agri-food workers, and citizens — must collaborate and take shared ownership in this endeavour.’\n\nFrontiers in Public Health. August 2016. ‘School Holiday Food Provision in the UK: A Qualitative Investigation of Needs, Benefits, and Potential for Development’. Frontiers In Public Health 8 pages. http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpubh.2016.00172/full\n\nInterviews with staff involved in holiday clubs found that they ‘felt that the food provided at holiday clubs gave children opportunities to try new and more nutritious foods than they would have access to at home. Staff believed that the children liked trying new foods and felt that these new food experiences could have a positive influence on children’s dietary habits at home.’ In addition, ‘holiday clubs offered an array of enjoyable activities for children’ which ‘were believed to alleviate boredom and reduce the likelihood that children would engage in anti-social behaviour’ thus improving overall wellbeing (p4).\n\nSupplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) can be used to restrict the development of hot food takeaways (A5). SPDs are not systematically produced but build upon and provide more detailed advice or guidance on the policies in the Local Plan. For planning decisions to be successfully upheld they need to be able to demonstrate a link to sound evidence and clear local policy. There needs to be good linkage between any SPDs or neighbourhood planning policies, health strategies (Health and Wellbeing Strategy and the JSNA) and, most importantly, the local plan. Local plans need to refer to these health strategies and vice versa.\n\nA Health Impact Assessment can be undertaken to help determine whether the planned development is likely to negatively impact upon health and wellbeing.\n\nStreet Trading Policies set out the Council’s approach to street licensing and its standards for those engaged in street trading.\n\nWhere food outlets operate from their property (vending, cafes in Council buildings, parks, leisure and sport centres and children’s centres, Council-operated markets or mobile trading activities), Councils can use their licensing powers to restrict the selling of unhealthy food.\n\nLocal authorities can “control” fast food vans by designating streets as requiring a ‘consent’ to trade under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 (LGMP Act) Sch. 4 Sect 2. (1) and introduce a policy refusing consent for unhealthy food vending and/or restricting location and hours of operation.\n\nThe provision of hot food or drink (beyond certain exemptions) after 11pm and before 5am requires a premises licence (Licensing Act 2003). If public health can be brought into the licensing objectives, a licence to sell unhealthy late-night takeaway food may be refused or restricted on these grounds. Otherwise, late-night food can only be restricted in line with the current objectives.\n\nFabian Commission. October 2015. ‘Hungry for Change. The final report of the Fabian Commission on Food and Poverty’.

Amongst other results, the report finds that the interventions on the wider determinants of health averaged a fivefold return on investment and highlights the “cross-sector flow problem: cost-effective public health programmes may not be commissioned if decision-makers are only looking through a narrow health lens.” (p6)\n\nGraziano da Silva, José. Speech delivered at the third meeting of mayors of cities of the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact. Valencia. 20 October 2017. http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57930#.We2k14hrwdU\n\nThe Director General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) called for innovative partnerships of local actors, civil society, private sector and academic and producer organisations to develop food strategies to overcome food waste and ensure a healthy and nutritious diet for all. He added the need for greater coordination between food and energy policies, and those regarding water, health, transport and waste in line with the New Urban Agenda, adopted in October 2016.\n\nPHE. March 2017. ‘Strategies for Encouraging Healthier ‘Out of Home’ Food Provision A toolkit for local councils working with small food businesses’ Public Health England. 63 pages. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/encouraging-healthier-out-of-home-food-provision\n\n‘Strategic partnerships across relevant local council departments (for example, planning, economic development and public health), as well as with external agencies and the local community can add value to interventions’. (Toolkit p20)\n\n‘An increasing body of evidence has added weight to the argument for a whole systems approach to be taken. The most recent Cochrane review of obesity prevention initiatives and the McKinsey Global Institute analysis of interventions both concluded that no single solution creates sufficient impact to reverse obesity; only a comprehensive, systematic program of multiple interventions is likely to be effective.’ ‘The Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA) has also argued that systems-wide leadership is vital to tackling obesity and suggested that local councils should aim to achieve a consistent approach to tackling obesity across all their strategies and policies.’ ‘The recent Local Government Association (LGA) local practice example analysis of ways in which local council public health departments are working in partnership to add value emphasises the need for a shared vision and for integration across council departments.’ ‘A joint approach to commissioning, pooling budgets and resources can be very effective. This is likely to be critical in maintaining and growing an effective public health offer at a time of increasing financial constraint.’ (Annexe D pp15-16)\n\nPublic Health England. March 2014. ‘Obesity and the environment: regulating the growth of fast food outlets’. Public Health England publications. 11 pages https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/296248/Obesity_and_environment_March2014.pdf\n\nFocusing on the environment and the connections between planning and health, the report argues that ‘local authorities have a range of legislative and policy levers at their disposal, alongside wider influences on healthy lifestyles, that can help to create places where people are supported to maintain a healthy weight. Public health professionals should work with their colleagues across local authorities to use these and other approaches to maximise health benefits.’ (p3)\n\nThe Food Foundation. January 2016. ‘Force-Fed. Does the food system constrict healthy choices for typical British families?’. The Food Foundation. 64 pages. http://foodfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Food-Foundation-64pp-A4-Landscape-Brochure-AW-V32.pdf\n\nOne of the report’s policy recommendations is that ‘quick-service restaurants often serve cheap, unhealthy food and we need a range of measures in place to incentivise food service providers to provide healthier food. Planning regulation is only one of these measures, but, given the strength of evidence and existing guidance from Public Health England, having consistent decision-making by local government and planning inspectors on fast food outlets around schools would be an easy win.’ (p35)\n\nThe report studies the extent to which unhealthy eating patterns are becoming more common as we increasingly ‘eat out’. In addition to planning regulations to limit the number of fast food outlets (mentioned above), the report recommends many other measures to ‘incentivise food service providers to provide healthier food’. These include ‘setting upper limits for the formulation of processed foods’ for specific nutrients; making Government Buying Standards mandatory for all public procurement; using VAT to support healthy choices; increasing school meal uptake and improving food in schools and workplaces (p27, 35).\n\nPublic Health England.

PHE publish evidence on the impact that ‘increasing access to healthier food for the general population’, ‘decrease exposure to unhealthy food environments’, ‘increased access to healthier food in schools’, ‘access to retail outlets selling healthier food’, ‘urban food growing’, ‘provision of and access to allotment and garden space’ have on key public health outcomes. These include maintenance of healthier weight, reduced risk of CVD, type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal conditions and some cancers, nutrition related outcomes among children and adolescents, BMI among children and adolescents and mental health and wellbeing (pp30-32).\n\nTCPA. Dec 2017. ‘Practical Guides for Creating Successful New Communities Guide 8: Creating Health-Promoting Environments.’ The Town and Country Planning Association. 34pages https://www.tcpa.org.uk/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=e120cac7-c8df-45a5-8879-bb830df3fc77\n\nThe Town and Country Planning Association's new development guidelines for Local Authorities take on an explicit public health perspective and recommend improving the food environment through: supporting the development of and facilitating access to a diversity of food outlets selling healthy food options; avoiding over-concentration of hot-food takeaways and restricting their proximity to schools, town centres or other facilities aimed at children, young people, and families; and giving communities the means to grow their own food in designated public and private spaces accessible from the home, school, or workplace. (p14)\n\nPHE. March 2017. ‘Strategies for Encouraging Healthier ‘Out of Home’ Food Provision A toolkit for local councils working with small food businesses’ Public Health England. 63 pages. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/encouraging-healthier-out-of-home-food-provision\n\n‘A systematic review of nutrition interventions targeting vending machines found that reducing price or increasing availability increased sales of healthier choices’ (Annexe D p8).\n\nA systematic review of the national levers that make the case for local authority interventions in the following areas:\n\nmaking healthy options available in the public sector, particularly through promotion of the GBSF\n\nre-committing to the Healthy Start scheme\n\nencouraging all schools to commit to the School Food Standards\n\nincrease access to healthy foods in disadvantaged areas\n\nto support local authorities to deliver whole systems approaches to tackle obesity, including through supporting healthier and more sustainable food procurement\n\nuse existing planning levers to limit the growth of hot food takeaways, for example by developing supplementary planning policies\n\nwork with local outlets and partners to increase access to healthy food choices. (Annexe D p17)\n\n‘A good understanding of the makeup of the local food and drink environment will be important in determining intervention focus.’ The report suggests using the Food Premises register and various mapping systems to map outlet locations and show proximity to schools, leisure centres and other sites frequented by children and young people. It recommends ‘In any mapping process it may be worth noting outlets occupying council-owned premises, for example leisure centres, where there may be better scope to leverage changes.’ The report also recommends local authorities try and gain an understanding of the consumer food environment by assessing the availability, procurement, price and prominence of healthier ingredients, food products and catering practices. (Toolkit pp13-14)\n\nSoil Association Food for Life. 2016. ‘A Healthier Place: the impact of the Food for Life Programme’. Soil Association Food for Life. 12 pages https://www.foodforlife.org.uk/about-us/our-impact/evaluation-reports\n\nFood for Life shows the impact its whole school approach and multi-settings programme have on health and well-being and the local economy. This latest report shows that for every £1 spent on Food For Life (FFL) there is a social value of £4.41 created over a three year period. It also shows that pupils in FFL schools reported consuming almost one third more portions of fruit and vegetables than pupils in comparison schools. It also found an increase in free school meal uptake in FFL schools and an increase in the procurement of more ethical, sustainable and local produce via the Food for Life Served Here.\n\nInternational Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems. June 2016. ‘From Uniformity to Diversity: A Paradigm Shift from Industrial Agriculture to Agroecological Systems’. IPES-Food. 96 pages. http://www.ipes-food.org/images/Reports/UniformityToDiversity_FullReport.pdf\n\nIPES recommends that ‘improved education on healthy eating in schools from an early age is essential to changing eating habits’ and that in order to achieve this ‘school curricula at all levels should include modules that integrate the multiple dimensions of food systems, including hands-on experiential programs such as school gardens, food preparation facilities, and making meals a time for learning as much as for eating’ (p72).\n\nPublic Health England. February 2015. ‘Local Leadership, New Approaches. How new ways of working are helping to improve the health of local communities’. Public Health England. 21 pages. https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/407060/2014712_Local_leadership.pdf\n\nPHE reports on Calderdale Council’s support of the integration of Food For Life in schools across the borough as well as extending to all settings with the aim of transforming food culture. Citing the public health manager at the Council, the report writes that ‘there’s widespread support for this type of focus on prevention from colleagues at the CCG and the local NHS hospital trust, who appreciate its potential to improve health and tackle inequalities’ (p8).\n\nParliamentary Office of Science and Technology. April 2016. ‘Barriers to Healthy Food’. Houses of Parliament. 7 pages. http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/POST-PN-0522\n\nThe report makes evident that increasing the availability of healthy options is mostly dependent on reducing the availability of unhealthy options. As the report does not find strong evidence to support the widespread existence of food deserts, it instead recommends acting on the promotion, advertising and marketing of unhealthy options to make these less attractive in comparison with healthier alternatives. It adds the importance of having strong healthy public sector food standards as well as reformulation and portion control."
