        "text": "Alumni Honor Roll\n\nAlumni of the program are encouraged to continue leveraging the tools, skills, and knowledge that they learned during the 4-week program and to share with other members of their communities. This Pay-it-Forward approach will ensure that every young man and woman in East and Central Africa would have the opportunity to be empowered to take steps to improve quality of life in their homes, communities, and countries.\n\nThere are ways that alumni engagement is measured - through what we call the 3P's: (1) Philanthropy; (2) Perpetuate; and (3) Participate. A point is given to each alumnus after completing the respective activity (a visual guide is below). Following is the Alumni Honor Roll which recognizes alumni who have earned at least one point in one of the three categories.\n\nAlumni Award Winners\n\nThe YALI Regional Leadership Center East Africa would like to recognize alumni who have been caught in the act of performing or implementing the 3P’s (Perpetuate, Participate, and Philanthropy). These 3P’s are critical to measuring how engaged alumni are with their alma mater and with each other. The 3P’s also gauge the impact that alumni are having on communities as a result of their membership in the program.\n\nThe following individuals are alumni who have gone above and beyond the simple completion of the program and seek to serve as passionate ambassadors of the Center by: Perpetuating volunteer opportunities; Participating in trainings and events to empower themselves and others; and contributing Philanthropy of time, resources, or services.\n\nTop Overall 3P's Performer & Top Perpetuate Performer\n\nNesia Mahenge\n\n(Cohort 1 - Tanzania)\n\nTop Participate Performer\n\nHellena Nambogwe\n\n(Cohort 2 – Uganda)\n\nTop Philanthropy Performer\n\nAzza Nadir\n\n(Cohort 2 – Sudan)\n\nTop Philanthropy Performer\n\nGahimbare Vestine\n\n(Cohort 1 – Burundi)"
