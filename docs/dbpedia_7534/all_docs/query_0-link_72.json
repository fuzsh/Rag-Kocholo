        "text": "Legal Aid & Mediation\n\nEviction Defense Project (EDP)\n\nLegal Action of Wisconsin's Eviction Defense Project provides free, same-day legal representation for families in eviction cases in Milwaukee small claims court. In addition to same-day legal representation, the EDP can provide advice to tenants, as well as assist tenants with post-judgement matters, such as motions to clarify CCAP records. EDP has been able to seal dismissed cases almost ten times as often as unrepresented tenants. EDP works in concert with other housing service providers by accepting referrals for clients with same-day representation when they otherwise have not secured extended representation before their case. With the help of attorneys and students across Milwaukee County who volunteer their time pro bono, the EDP is able to help anywhere from six to 12 otherwise unrepresented families facing eviction per day.\n\nEviction Free MKE (EFM)\n\nEFM provides pro-bono extended legal representation for families in eviction cases in Milwaukee County small claims court. Eligible tenants must be from Milwaukee County and have incomes at or below 200% of federal poverty guidelines.\n\nMediate WI Tenant/Landlord Mediation\n\nIn this program, professional mediators de-escalate tension between tenants and landlords, help them find common interests or goals, connect with available financial and supportive services, and craft an individualized solution that makes sense to both parties. This grant serves households across Milwaukee, Waukesha, Washington, and Ozaukee counties and closely collaborates with the Rental Housing Resource Center.\n\nFlexible Financial Assistance & Wraparound Support\n\nFamily Flex Fund\n\nProvides tiered case management and flexible financial aid for families that would otherwise be using crisis services to prevent an episode of homelessness.\n\nRent, Utility, and Flexible Assistance\n\nVarious programs provide specific (delinquent property tax, utility bill, etc.) or flexible financial assistance to clients with unique eligibility for each program. For example, parents returning from incarceration or veteran-led families.\n\nCommunity Case Management (CCM)\n\nIn partnership with the Greater Milwaukee Foundation, CCM programs provide flexible financial assistance for community case managers covering security deposits, first month’s rent, monthly bus passes, moving expenses, move-in supplies, and food-related gift cards. Flexible funds allow case managers to provide their clients with the amount and type of support they need to achieve stability as determined by Individualized Plans for Independence.\n\nSchool-Based Housing Case Management\n\nThe School-Based Housing Case Management program is run in partnership with the Siemer Institute for Family Stability. Students with frequent school mobility have a challenging time focusing on education. Housing case managers work with Milwaukee Public Schools to identify students that frequently change schools due to housing insecurity. Housing case managers then wrap those students’ families with supportive services, including rent assistance and case management. The goal is to stabilize a student in one school throughout the school year, so they can focus on their education and not where they are going to sleep that night. In 2023, this program was expanded to begin serving housing unstable students and their families in the City of Waukesha.\n\nWraparound Supportive Services\n\nOnce families move from homelessness back into their own home, optional wraparound supportive services are offered by multiple organizations, typically for 12-months, to help ensure families do not re-experience homelessness because underlying needs weren’t met.\n\nTenant/Landlord Resource Referral\n\nMilwaukee Rental Housing Resource Center\n\nThe Rental Housing Resource Center (RHRC) is a single physical and digital location for tenants or landlords looking for eviction prevention resources. RHRC is a collaboration of nine organizations: Apartment Association of Southeastern WI, Community Advocates, IMPACT, Hope House, Legal Action, Legal Aid Society, Mediate Wisconsin, City of Milwaukee Dept. of Neighborhood Services, and the Milwaukee County Housing Division. Safe & Stable Homes helps cover the cost of the physical location, website, outreach materials, and one full-time Triage Specialist.\n\nIMPACT 211\n\nResidents in any community can call the 2-1-1 referral line to talk with a representative who can identify which community resource, out of a detailed listing of resources, fits the caller’s health & human service needs.\n\nLegal Support\n\nEvictionFreeMKE provides no-cost attorneys for low-income tenants facing eviction. Every week, local canvassers knock on the doors of about 100 homes that appear on a weekly eviction filing list to share program information. Over 7,000 local households have received legal aid in their eviction case (Nov 2021-2023). Legal representation rose from about 3% of tenants to about a quarter of all eviction filed. An independent evaluation of the first 18 months of the program found an economic benefit to Milwaukee County of between $9 million and $9.3 million through deferred crisis services from prevented evictions."
