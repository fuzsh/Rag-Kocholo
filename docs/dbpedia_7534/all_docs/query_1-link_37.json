        "text": "Denis Stairs\n\nHarold Nicolson\n\nPeacemaking 1919 (1933)\n\n”œWhat book had the greatest influence on the way you think about policy?” The question can’t be answered. Not honestly, at any rate. It can only be constructed. For all I know, the greatest influence came from the didacticism in the tales of Hans Christian Andersen or the brothers Grimm””tales read to me at bedside long before I could read myself. The biggest influences, after all, are the ones we internalize. They’re like oil in an engine. We don’t know they’re there””although we soon enough start to cough and sputter if they dry up. We find then that we can’t run. We have nothing to say.\n\nSo the answer has to be construct- ed. It can’t be induced. And the con- struction itself must be built on mem- ory””usually a memory from youth, not from maturity. The heads of the young are nearly empty, and their minds impressionable. The heads of the old fill up (or shrink, more likely), so it’s harder to get new ideas in. They bounce off (although to be fair to filled-up heads, in the study of politics this is often because the new ideas aren’t really new after all).\n\nAs an alleged policy wonk who has made a modest living out of peanut-gallery observations on foreign policy and international affairs””an academic spectator’s sport if ever there was one””I’d have to construct my own answer in favour of Harold Nicolson’s Peacemaking 1919, first pub- lished, in two parts, in 1933, and again, with a new introduction, ten years later, when the world was once more at war.\n\nI read it first as an undergraduate student of history at Dalhousie in the late 1950s. Neither of the two world wars had then acquired the place they now hold among the young, who appear to see them in much the same way as I, at their age, saw the Crusades, or the Wars of the Roses””as the bar- barous happenings of a dead past, hav- ing no relevance, and offering no les- sons, for a living present. But for us the two great shooting wars of the 20th cen- tury were far from empty abstractions. Our fathers and grandfathers had served in them. As adolescent males, we won- dered and debated (and doubted) whether we would have been able to match their courage if challenged as they had been in combat; whether we would have had the strength to keep faith with our comrades if we had been tortured, like captured members of the Resistance, by the Gestapo; whether we would have tried””somehow””to defend and protect the Jews had we been ordinary Germans in Hitler’s time. The world wars, in short, were still very real in the 1950s, and with atomic bombs spreading about, and sabres rat- tling, and the forces of the Warsaw Pact and the NATO alliance bristling at one another, it was self-evident that such lessons as could be found in them might still be germane. This was a ”œmodern,” not a postmodern age, and we knew it to be dangerous. States mattered. Nations mattered. Beliefs mattered. And they all had a terrible habit of killing.\n\nIt was easy to move, when young, from so melodramatic a perspective to a fascination with Nicolson’s melan- choly tale, and his own reaction to it. Nicolson was only 33 and a relatively junior British diplomat when he arrived in Paris in January 1919 to take part in the conference that was sup- posed to bring the peace that was to end all wars. Like many of the young, though perhaps not so many of the old, he had been gripped and inspired 12 months before by Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, Four Principles and Five Particulars. He ”œ[t]ook it for granted,” as he later reported, ”œthat on them alone would the Treaties of Peace be based.” They were morally compelling. There was general agreement that they would form the basis of negotiation. And he was sure that President Wilson ”œpos- sessed unlimited physical power to enforce his views.”\n\nBut then the real work began, and one by one the principles came tum- bling down, or were compromised beyond recognition. Their collapse started with the very first. The ”œcovenants,” the negotiators soon found out, could not be ”œopenly arrived at,” for if the bargaining were truly in the open, the howls of their respective constituency populations would deprive them of the power to make the concessions they knew they had to make. The concessions them- selves, moreover, depended on a will- ingness to violate, one after another, the very points, principles and partic- ulars that the final result was sup- posed to embody. The diplomatic agenda was cluttered in any case by shadowy deals and self-serving com- mitments that not long before had been secretly contrived in response to the necessities, or at least to the con- veniences, of war. It was all too clear, as the process wound down, that its intended job could not be done. At the end of the stiffly formal ceremony in which the Treaty of Versailles is signed, Nicolson finds a colleague, Headlam Morley, ”œstanding miserably in the littered immensity of the Galerie des Glaces.” They ”œsay noth- ing to each other. It has all been hor- rible.” Back at the hotel, after an apparently sombre celebration with ”œvery bad champagne” and a stroll on the boulevards of Paris, the defeated idealist retreats ”œ[t]o bed, sick of life.”\n\nHere was the portrait of a politics whose stakes were not merely power and property, but life and death””a politics that had not only failed, but failed cataclysmically. It was the por- trait also of a clash of optimism and idealism with the brutish realities of world affairs. In the contest, the opti- mism and idealism lost. It was the por- trait, further, of an encounter of an elitist diplomacy with vox populi. But as it turned out, there was precious lit- tle to be said for the wisdom or perspi- cacity of either the diplomats them- selves or the populations they were there to serve. Small wonder that one of the lessons that Nicolson identified in his fresh introduction to the 1943 edition was that ”œPeace must be found- ed on realities rather than on hopes.”\n\nPerhaps it was not the best of les- sons to learn. Certainly former Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy would not think so. But it must have seemed the right lesson to draw in 1943, when the cataclysm that had begun with the fail- ure of Versailles was wrecking its havoc around the globe. And it seemed a per- suasive enough lesson for an undergrad- uate to learn in 1959.\n\nThere have been more influential expositors of the realist position by far than Harold Nicolson”” Thucydides, for example, in ancient times, and Hans J. Morgenthau in a time that I have to recognize as my own. But Nicolson, with his telling combination of historical analysis and daily diary, made the link to the personal. In so doing, he also made his world-view stick.\n\nDenis Stairs is McCulloch Professor in Political Science at Dalhousie University. He is also a member of the IRPP’s Board of Directors.\n\nCharles Castonguay\n\nAndré Laurendau and Davidson Dunton, co-chairs\n\nReports of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1965-1970)\n\nWhen I return to check a point in the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission’s preliminary or final reports, I more often than not find myself lingering longer than necessary, with a feeling that I’ve come home, that here is the way we should proceed in our think- ing over language matters: with policy based on fact-finding and on compro- mise between the ideal and the practi- cal. And the facts come first, to ensure that the end result works out as suc- cessfully as possible.\n\nReconnecting with this familiar wisdom and with the Commission’s pioneering investigations prompts me to continue exploring language behav- iour in Canada, while keeping a critical eye on policies or statements which are not sufficiently in touch with lin- guistic reality. The report’s basic approach””that lack of transparency and inadequate examination of the facts pave the way to half-truths and prejudice””nags me to action whenev- er partisan zeal attempts to suppress investigation or discussion of sensitive but central aspects of language behav- iour such as linguistic assimilation.\n\nI came to appreciate the Commis- sion’s work in the early 1970s, at the same time that I first took an interest in language issues. My curiosity had been stirred by the possible creation of feder- al bilingual districts and by public debate over the distinct language policy which was emerging in Quebec.\n\nAs the years go by, the growing sclerosis of the language bureaucracies now firmly established in Ottawa and Quebec City leads them to channel research and debate on languages along official lines. The era of the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission has in retrospect taken on the aura of a golden age of free, uninhibited enquiry.\n\nThe Commission’s mandate””to see how Canada might develop ”œon the basis of an equal partnership between the two founding races”””strikes one today as strange and extraordinarily far removed from the current Canadian political agenda. Given the inextricable interweaving of linguistic and national identities, the gradual hardening of English-speaking Canada’s response to Québécois aspirations for security and recognition in these respects renders ever more remote the chance of a return to frank and sober deliberation over language issues.\n\nNevertheless, revisiting the B&B books still works on me a welcome feeling of relief and détente. Not so much through their proposed solu- tions to the enduring Canadian lan- guage and political crises: on language policy they largely amounted to apply- ing a symmetric treatment””support of English in Quebec and French in the rest of Canada””to remedy a situation which from the standpoint of French was seriously out of kilter from coast to coast. For example, the bilingual dis- tricts concept, the result of an interest- ing compromise between the princi- ples of personality and of territoriality, could have effectively alleviated the pressure of anglicization without arousing Québécois apprehensions, had the Commission proposed its application be limited to the principal French-speaking populations outside Quebec, those in New Brunswick and Eastern and Northern Ontario. But such was not the case, and the doctri- naire stance of the subsequent Trudeau administration did the rest.\n\nThe books continue to be relevant, then, not so much because of the solu- tions they propose””it must be added in the Commission’s defence that it was not as well-informed as it would have liked to be concerning the magnitude and trends of linguistic assimilation in Montreal and the rest of Canada””as by their spirit of sane, sincere, upright and responsible enquiry, which remains an inspiration to this day.\n\nCharles Castonguay teaches in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Ottawa.\n\nRoss Finnie\n\nArthur M. Okun\n\nEquality and Efficiency The Big Tradeoff (1975)\n\nAfter I decided to write about Arthur Okun’s classic book, conversations with various colleagues revealed that it had been an important book for others as well. Above all, I was reminded, this was because Okun used a simple analo- gy to represent a complex set of social- political-economic choices. We can increase the well-being of those at the bottom of the economic ladder, but at a cost: Okun’s ”œleaky bucket” symbol- izes the losses which occur when money is transferred from those with higher incomes to those who are not so well off. It’s a simple, useful metaphor, but the book is in fact much deeper, much richer than this.\n\nAfter considerable scholarly dis- cussion””the text is more than abun- dantly footnoted””of the nature of ”œrights,” both economic and other- wise, Okun comes to the main theme of the book when he offers a strong, indeed passionate argument for why the more-or-less equal distribution of political rights in Western democracies should be accompanied by greater equality in the distribution of eco- nomic rights. But after presenting the big picture in this regard, he narrows his focus to concentrate on what might be done to eradicate poverty. This strategy emerges from a simple benefit-cost analysis which causes him to judge that the greatest benefits of any redistribution program would result from bringing those at the very bottom up towards the middle, and that the means of going much further than this would be more complex, and the costs higher.\n\nOkun’s position could thus be phrased in the modern parlance of social inclusion: ”œI have stressed par- ticularly the urgency of assisting the bottom fifth on the income scale and helping them into the mainstream of our affluent society…” (emphasis added), such as the opportunity to have ”œfirst homes, first cars, and college slots for solid students” (118) and the participa- tion in civic society which goes along with such material well-being.\n\nBut Okun speaks at similar length, if less passionately, about market effi- ciency and all that the market econo- my typically delivers, principally because of the individualistic incen- tives that drive people to produce according to their own particular tal- ents and energies. These are old les- sons, dating at least from Adam Smith, but they always bear repeating””per- haps especially because the view Okun provides is far from uncritical, as he notes the dehumanizing role of greed, the energies consumed by conflict, the often arbitrary nature of the gains and losses, the inequity of the winner- takes-all conflicts that so often occur, and so forth. But in a pragmatic con- clusion reminiscent of Churchill’s maxim that democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others, Okun concludes that ”œAlthough the ethical case for capital- ism is totally unpersuasive, the effi- ciency case is thoroughly compelling to me” (64). We can, so to speak, be bought by the market system and the material abundance it delivers.\n\nThe equity-efficiency trade-off this:\n\nIf both equality and efficiency are val- ued, and neither takes absolute priori- ty over the other, then in places where they conflict, compromises ought to be struck. In such cases, some equality will have to be sacrificed for the sake of efficiency, and some efficiency for the sake of equality. But any sacrifice of either has to be justified as a neces- sary means of obtaining more of the other (or perhaps some other valued social end).\n\nThis is the classic economist’s trade-off: inequality-reducing interven- tions come at an efficiency cost, and vice versa. The leaky bucket. So, how much water do we wish to haul with it?\n\nOkun lays out the principal redis- tributive tools: tax reform, cash trans- fers, in-kind benefits (especially health care and food stamps), and expanded employment incentives and opportu- nities. The costs are similarly lined up: administrative costs, reduced labour supply (although Okun notes the lack of any convincing empirical evidence that these effects are large), reduced saving, and the destructive effects on ”œattitudes.”\n\nWhat, then, are the programs that might be employed to accomplish the desired redistributive ends and what are the associated losses? These are empirical issues upon which we can (at least in principle) agree. What should we choose? That is for each of us to decide, and no one can tell us if we are right or wrong. The relevant political problem is to find the point on this frontier””the equality-efficiency trade- off””that is right for us collectively. It must be done, and will be done implic- itly if not explicitly, but the task is daunting.\n\nYet Okun steps up to the chal- lenge and is unafraid to offer a set of specific policy prescriptions which he believes could do the redistributive job he thinks needs to be done, and yet win widespread support precisely for its intelligent, effective (my adjec- tives, not his) balance between the desirability of helping the poor and the costs of doing so.\n\nTo this end, Okun outlines the measures he believes would generate a given amount of increased equality in the most efficient manner, thus essentially identifying the unleakiest bucket possible. He suggests where the aid would be best targeted for maximum benefit, based on the size of the gains and the deservingness of those assisted, and he then argues why the Americans of his day (the mid-1970s) would (or should) support the specific program choices he pro- poses, which to his mind represent the best equality-efficiency trade-off possible.\n\nOkun’s recommendations thus comprise a practical anti-poverty poli- cy agenda which could form the basis of public action still today, either in the United States, for which Okun designed it, or here in Canada, or indeed in a good number of other countries. Not bad for a little book”” just 120 pages””written over a quarter century ago!\n\nAlthough this slight volume is of course dated, going back to it gave me some of the same thrills I felt as a fourth-year undergrad when I first turned its pages and wrote comments in its margins, some of which I was not ashamed to read this latest time through it. And ”œthrills” is not too strong a word: One should be thrilled by such ideas, at least those of us who entered economics because it seemed the discipline most able to make the world a better place (corny as that might sound to many), and not simply an exercise in applied math or a game board for the intellectual one-upman- ship into which so many academic debates deteriorate.\n\nThe basic ideas Okun proposes are not especially complicated, but before I read his exposition of them, the world seemed to me to be largely divided into two camps. Either you supported ”œhelping the poor,” and a different distribution of income and different ways of organising society in general, and despised markets””and economics and indeed economists, in general””or you were in favour of mar- kets and saw value and hope only in dabbling a bit at the margin so as not to disrupt things in any significant manner, and tended toward an arro- gance derived from a presumed under- standing of how things really worked that those others””with their childlike innocence, well-meaning though they might be””did not possess. I’m obvi- ously setting up straw persons here and generalizing rather extravagantly, but only to emphasize that it did seem to me at the time that only two ways of thinking about these issues were possible.\n\nOkun therefore opened up a whole new range of thought for me and made clear that there was ample room for effective action. To respect, even embrace markets for all the marvellous things they do was not at all inconsis- tent with seeing the need for and pos- sibility of effecting change in an effi- cient manner. In modern pop jargon, it was the meeting of ”œhead and heart,” a union that on such questions I think only economists can truly experience.\n\nIn personal, practical terms, Okun gave me the desire to study poverty, low earnings and income distribution more generally, so as to possibly con- tribute to our understanding of what the situation is, how it came to be, and how things might be different. The ultimate destination was policy analysis, indeed policy recommenda- tions, based on a strong appreciation of markets, of individuals’ incentives, and of the need to change the distri- bution of income principally by open- ing up opportunities for those at the bottom, targeting programs on such people at the times in their lives when action would be most justifiable on grounds of ”œfairness” and most effec- tive in terms of the subsequent flow of benefits.\n\nSo I am strongly in favour of:\n\nassured access to high-quality education and otherwise enriched environments for all children so as to generate the base platform from which they can build productive careers and constructive lives;\n\ngenerous wage subsidies and earned-income tax credits designed to provide those at the bottom end of the labour market with incentives to work and with the day care, trans- portation, and other help they need to make work pay and thus get them into the sorts of entry-level jobs that can serve as a first step toward moving into the economic mainstream;\n\nadult education and training to help people recover from previous stumbles or bad luck or to help them pick up and move when jobs and an economic future lie in different places than they did in the past.\n\nIn short, I believe in a society which provides generous assistance in the form of expanding employment opportunities which could help those in the lower reaches of the economic system build better lives””and all this in preference to passive employment insurance or welfare schemes, to train- ing programs which become the job rather than a means of actually devel- oping skills and moving into the labour force, or to transfer programs which prop up regions or industries which are not inherently viable on their own.\n\nI find support for this view in Okun’s simple statement that ”œIf those at the bottom receive the contents of the [unleakiest!] leaky bucket and are granted greater equality of opportuni- ty, most will get on their own two feet.” (118) I am perhaps not so san- guine as Okun, but we will not know until we try. To make the attempt is surely what defines us as human beings: the will and ability to work together to help those who are less well off. It is only good sense to do this ””yes””with our eyes open to its costs and in as efficient a manner as possible.\n\nIn fact, I would go further than Okun in arguing that there can be direct efficiency gains from certain redistributive measures. Giving every child””or adult””the chance to devel- op the skills and labour market oppor- tunities that will make him or her more productive can be efficiency- enhancing. But I share Okun’s disdain for the failed policies of the past, and for what typically passes for ”œleft” thinking today, which so often pro- ceeds from ignorance of ”œthe econom- ics” of the problem. As Okun puts it:\n\nIronically, the cause of reform received a serious setback from those who sought to advance it. With friends like that, it needed no ene- mies. A new effort should display more concern for the preservation of market incentives and more respect for genuine skepticism; and it should eschew divisive rhetoric. My fellow reformers should want to design pro- grams of aid to the poor that will not spawn laziness, as they can, guided by a solid body of factual””even sci- entific””evidence.\n\nIf it is done properly, however, ”œEqualization should have a unifying theme: this can be a better nation for rich and poor alike by fulfilling the right to a reasonable standard of decent living for all citizens” (116).\n\nIn short, this little book is well worth a read now, as it was then. This is especially true for reformers with ”œleft- ist” instincts who remain economists to the core. But it is also true for any- one interested in inequality issues, as Okun covers topics as diverse as the underlying theoretical arguments for and against any particular level of inequality, the major types of econom- ic system, all the way through to a practical program of reform that would help bring those at the bottom into the economic mainstream. The Big Tradeoff: One of the great issues of the day. A great, big book.\n\nRoss Finnie is a Research Fellow and an Adjunct Professor in the School of Policy Studies, Queen’s University.\n\nPierre Fortin\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes\n\nThe General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936)\n\nThe book that has had the greatest influence on the way I understand macroeconomics and think about macroeconomic policy is Keynes’ General Theory. It has been to macro- economics what Einstein’s Grundlage der allgemeinen Relatività¤tstheorie (1916) was earlier to cosmology and gravity. Each brought giant leaps in important areas of scientific knowledge.\n\nFor economists, the main intellec- tual challenge of the interwar period had been to explain the persistence of mass involuntary unemployment in advanced countries during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Until Keynes’ book appeared in 1936, this extraordi- nary macroeconomic fact had been denied theoretical existence by the canons of classical economic thought. For, the argument went, if workers came for any reason to offer more labour services than firms needed, competitive labour markets would exert downward pressure on wages. The resulting lower wages would lead workers to voluntarily reduce their sup- ply of labour and firms to increase their demand for labour, so that the initial excess supply would shrink and even- tually disappear. Hence, persistent involuntary unemployment was seen as a theoretical impossibility.\n\nKeynes thought denying the exis- tence of involuntary unemployment in the midst of the Great Depression was absurd. He saw things differently. First, he argued that business expectations about the future were volatile and inde- terminate. This left business invest- ment highly vulnerable to periodic bouts of rising optimism or pes- simism””irrational exuberance or dis- tress, as we would call it today. The out- come was large economy-wide fluctua- tions in aggregate demand for goods and services, with associated repercus- sions in labour markets. Later, Keynes’ successors identified many other sources of aggregate demand instability: household consumption, commodity exports, military spending, etc.\n\nSecond, Keynes claimed that the corrective reaction in wages that classi- cal economic thinking relied on to bring production and employment back into balance after such an econo- my-wide disturbance either did not work at all or worked too slowly to be relevant in real time. One line of argu- ment was that, to the extent depressed production and high unemployment caused prices to fall in general, con- sumers and firms could in fact decide to spend less now in expectation of lower prices later. Instead of curing depression and mass unemployment the market reaction would make things even worse. A downward spiral of depression and price deflation could set in. Needless to say, in the midst of the deflation experienced by many countries in the 1930s, this kind of argument looked strikingly relevant, just as it would today considering what has recently been happening in Japan.\n\nKeynes suggested recessions could be made shorter and less severe by the appropriate use of monetary and fiscal policy to stabilize aggregate demand, production and employment. In eco- nomic downturns, central banks could lower interest rates and ministries of finance could increase spending or reduce taxes to prop up aggregate demand and decrease unemployment. In economic expansions and times of rapid inflation, monetary and fiscal policies would work in reverse.\n\nAt the time Keynes was writing, many believed the only choice coun- tries had was either to remain capital- ist, which meant keeping individual freedom but accepting high unem- ployment, or to embrace socialism, which implied full employment with restricted freedom. Keynes showed a way out of this dilemma: capitalism with state-managed aggregate demand could bring near-full employment without suppressing political and eco- nomic freedom. Although he has since been accused by conservatives of pro- moting state intervention, his policy proposals were actually meant to save capitalism from destruction during its worst crisis in two centuries. To belie Marx, so to speak.\n\nThe popular interpretation of Keynes’ General Theory is as a tract for fiscal activism. There are two rea- sons why this is totally incorrect. First, Keynes emphasized the stabilizing role of monetary policy as much as that of fiscal policy. He did acknowledge mon- etary policy would be ineffective in a situation where interest rates would have already fallen to zero and could not be reduced further. Fiscal expan- sion would then be available as a last resort. But he definitely saw this as an exceptional case, likely to occur only in the depth of a depression such as experienced in the 1930s or in 21st- century Japan.\n\nSecond, there is no evidence whatsoever that Keynes ever displayed any bias in favour of either fiscal fine-tun- ing or systematic deficit spending. He was a fiscal conservative who kept warning against excessive short-term tinkering with the tax system and was a staunch supporter of medium-term fiscal balance. He definitely recom- mended that the fiscal deficits incurred in recessions be offset by fiscal surplus- es in expansions. A public debt-to-GDP ratio rising on trend is something he strongly condemned. Canadian fiscal policy was never as anti-Keynesian as in the two-decade period from 1975 to 1995, when fiscal deficits were large and systematic and the public debt-to- GDP ratio quadrupled.\n\nIn the last 60 years, Keynesian ideas have been bitterly attacked by both left and right. Leftists obviously never had any taste for theories whose basic pur- pose was to make capitalism run better. Conservatives tried to deny the basic tenets of Keynesian thought and bring the classical view back to life, suggest- ing that the private economy was inherently stable and that wages and prices were sufficiently flexible to quickly remove any imbalances between supply and demand. The con- servative counter-revolution against Keynesian ideas was spearheaded by Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas, both of the University of Chicago, and Edward Prescott of the University of Minnesota.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Friedman and Lucas developed the view that economic fluctuations resulted from confusion about wages and prices that was generated by ill-advised monetary and fiscal policies in labour and prod- uct markets. One startling and implau- sible implication of this line of argu- ment was that workers withdrew their labour services voluntarily for almost a decade after 1929 because they could not figure out what the true rate of inflation was. In the early 1980s, Prescott went even further. He rejected any suggestion that monetary policy could affect production and employ- ment, and argued that business cycles were the economy’s best response to changing productivity growth. The straight implication was that reces- sions were always a good thing. Unemployment was high in recessions only because workers rejected job offers that paid less than they thought their labour was worth.\n\nThese conservative explanations of periodic recessions and high unem- ployment had their academic hour of glory in the 1965-85 period. But they challenged common sense and were eventually contradicted by empirical evidence. For example, if unemploy- ment was high in recessions due to workers rejecting job offers because wages were too low, then one would observe many more job quits in reces- sions than in expansions. But in fact, precisely the opposite is true: job quits decline in recessions and rise in expansions.\n\nAnd guess what? Keynes is back! The years since 1985 have seen an extraordinary resurgence of Keynesian ideas, led, among many others, by macroeconomists such as 2001 Nobel prize-winners George Akerlof and Joseph Stiglitz. In the practical world of monetary policy, Alan Greenspan’s success at the helm of the U.S. Federal Reserve since 1987 owes almost every- thing to Keynes, and almost nothing to the conservative icons of the previ- ous two decades.\n\nFor some time in the 1970s and 1980s, it was difficult to advocate Keynesian ideas. The world of acade- mia can be just as intolerant as the world of religion or politics. In those days, Keynes was repeatedly pronounced ”œdead,” and Keynesians were just not listened to. But the beauty of the scientific method, which guides the progress of economic ideas over the long run, is that conservative the- ory could not survive indefinitely against common sense and mounting contradictory evidence.\n\nNaturally, Keynes’ book will never be so widely read as a Danielle Steele novel. But, believe it or not, I recently saw a flight attendant reading the General Theory during her break on an Air Canada flight from Vancouver to Montreal. ”œIt’s a bit difficult to fol- low,” she said, ”œbut people say it’s one of the most important books of the 20th century.”\n\nI couldn’t agree more.\n\nPierre Fortin is Professor of Economics at l’Université du Québec à Montréal.\n\nPierre Fortin\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes\n\nThe General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936)\n\nChaque fois qu’une récession frappe, on se pose toujours les mêmes ques- tions : d’où viennent les récessions?, comment se fait-il que l’économie se met à produire en dessous de son potentiel véritable?, pourquoi tant de travailleurs tombent-ils en chômage et tant d’entreprises doivent-elles déposer leur bilan? C’est l’économiste britannique John Maynard Keynes qui proposa la première explication cohérente des récessions, dans son livre intitulé La théorie générale de l’emploi, de l’intérêt et de la monnaie et publié en 1936. En économie, ce livre eut une portée révolutionnaire com- parable à celle de l’article de 1916 d’Einstein sur la théorie de la relati- vité générale en cosmologie.\n\nQue contenait le livre de Keynes? Au milieu de la Grande Dépression des années 1930, le prin- cipal défi posé aux économistes était évidemment d’expliquer la persis- tance de taux de chômage de 20 p. 100 ou plus qui affligeaient plusieurs pays industrialisés. Jusque là, la pen- sée classique en économie avait tout simplement nié la possibilité d’une telle occurrence. Car, prétendait-on, si un excédent de main-d’œuvre en chômage apparaissait pour quelque raison, la concurrence pour les emplois disponibles aurait tôt fait d’abaisser les salaires. Des salaires plus bas inciteraient les travailleurs à renoncer volontairement à offrir leurs services et les entreprises à augmenter leur niveau d’embauche. L’excédent initial de main-d’œuvre diminuerait donc et finirait par se résorber entièrement. Ainsi, la persistance du chômage involontaire était perçue comme une impossibilité théorique.\n\nKeynes comprit qu’en niant l’existence du chômage involontaire prolongé, qui crevait les yeux au creux de la Grande Dépression, la sci- ence économique se couvrait de ridicule. Il aborda les choses de manière différente. En premier lieu, il fit remarquer que les attentes des entrepreneurs face à l’avenir étaient fragiles et instables. Par conséquent, l’investissement des entreprises (cons- truction d’usines et achat d’équipement) était très vulnérable à des phases alter- nantes d’exubérance irrationnelle et de pessimisme exagéré, comme on dit encore aujourd’hui. S’ensuivaient des fluctuations périodiques de la demande globale de biens et de ser- vices et des répercussions généralisées sur la production et l’emploi. Les suc- cesseurs de Keynes en ont en fait rajouté : la consommation, les expor- tations, les dépenses militaires, etc., sont aussi reconnues aujourd’hui comme des sources importantes de fluctuations de la demande globale.\n\nEn second lieu, Keynes prétendit que, lorsque la demande globale s’af- faiblissait et qu’un écart se creusait entre l’offre et la demande de travail, la réaction correctrice des salaires sur laquelle l’analyse classique comptait pour résorber le chômage ou bien ne se produisait pas ou bien se produisait trop lentement en temps réel. Il fit même observer qu’une chute des salaires et des prix, plutôt que de résorber le chômage, pouvait avoir l’effet contraire de l’amplifier. Car, dans la mesure où un effondrement de la production et de l’emploi entraîne une baisse généralisée des prix””une déflation””, les consomma- teurs et les entreprises peuvent très bien décider de dépenser encore moins aujourd’hui et de reporter leurs dépenses à plus tard dans l’attente de prix plus bas dans l’avenir. Le cas échéant, la dépression et le chômage s’aggravent plutôt que de se résorber. C’est la descente aux enfers : la dépression cause la déflation, qui creuse la dépression, qui accentue la déflation, et ainsi de suite.\n\nÀ la suite de son diagnostic, Keynes affirma qu’on pouvait atténuer et raccourcir les récessions en stabilisant la demande globale, la production et l’emploi au moyen d’une politique régulatrice intelligente. Lors d’un ralentissement économique, les banques centrales abaisseraient les taux d’intérêt et les ministères des finances augmenteraient les dépenses publiques ou allégeraient la fiscalité de manière à ranimer la demande globale et à réduire le chômage. Lors d’une expansion économique accom- pagnée d’une inflation en hausse, la politique monétaire et budgétaire agi- rait en sens inverse.\n\nÀ l’époque où Keynes publia son livre, on croyait souvent que les pays étaient confrontés à une alterna- tive : ou bien demeurer capitalistes, ce qui préserverait les libertés fonda- mentales, mais au prix d’un chômage endémique, ou bien embrasser le socialisme, ce qui procurerait le plein emploi, mais au prix d’accrocs aux libertés. Keynes proposait une solu- tion élégante au dilemme. Un capita- lisme assorti d’une régulation appro- priée de la demande par l’État permet- trait de réconcilier plein emploi et pleine liberté. On pouvait avoir le beurre et l’argent du beurre. Il est ahurissant d’entendre encore aujour- d’hui une certaine opinion conserva- trice accuser Keynes d’avoir fait la promotion de l’étatisme. Sa proposi- tion ne visait qu’un objectif : sauver le capitalisme de la destruction au milieu de sa pire crise en 200 ans et empêcher la répétition de telles crises dans l’avenir. Faire mentir Marx, en quelque sorte.\n\nUne interprétation répandue de la Théorie générale de Keynes est qu’il s’agit d’un pamphlet en faveur de l’« activisme budgétaire ». Cette lec- ture de la pensée de Keynes, que ses critiques ont cherché à accréditer, est complètement erronée pour deux raisons. La première est que Keynes a insisté sur le rôle stabilisateur de la politique monétaire tout autant que de la politique bugétaire. À ses yeux, des taux d’intérêt bas pouvaient, en général, nous débarrasser des réces- sions tout aussi efficacement qu’une accélération des dépenses publiques ou une réduction des impôts. (La stratégie actuelle de reprise en Amérique du Nord repose précisé- ment sur l’abaissement des taux d’in- térêt, ce qui est parfaitement keynésien.) Naturellement, Keynes a souligné que la politique monétaire serait inopérante dans le cas où les taux d’intérêt auraient déjà atteint le niveau zéro et ne pourraient baisser encore plus. La politique budgétaire serait alors disponible comme dernier recours. Mais il a reconnu sans ambiguïté cette situation comme exceptionnelle et susceptible d’appa- raître seulement au creux d’une dépression comme celle des années 1930 (ou comme celle du Japon con- temporain).\n\nLa seconde erreur est de croire que Keynes ait envisagé la politique de régulation conjoncturelle comme une tentative de réglage de précision de l’économie ou qu’il se soit fait le promoteur des déficits budgétaires systématiques. Bien au contraire, sur le plan budgétaire, Keynes était plutôt conservateur. Il ne cessait de mettre en garde contre la manipula- tion exagérée du régime fiscal et il était un fervent partisan de l’équili- bre financier à moyen terme. Il a clairement recommandé de combler les déficits encourus lors des réces- sions par des surplus réalisés lors des phases d’expansion. Il s’est ferme- ment opposé aux déficits à repetition comme ceux que le Canada a encou- rus de 1975 à 1995. Ce furent les années les plus anti-keynésiennes de toute l’histoire macroéconomique du pays.\n\nAu cours des 60 dernières années, les idées de Keynes ont fait l’ob- jet d’attaques virulentes, de la part de la gauche comme de la droite. Les penseurs de gauche, il va sans dire, n’ont jamais apprécié les théories dont la conséquence est d’améliorer le fonctionnement du régime capita- liste. De leur côté, les penseurs de droite ont systématiquement tenté de réfuter la doctrine keynésienne et de redonner vie à la vision classique des choses, selon laquelle le secteur privé de l’économie est fondamentalement stable et la flexibilité des salaires et des prix permet une résorption rapide de tout déséquilibre entre l’offre et la demande globales.\n\nLes années 1970 à 1990 ont vu ces idées classiques connaître un regain de popularité dans les milieux de la recherche universitaire. Mais la négation du chômage involontaire et de la capacité stabilisatrice de la poli- tique macroéconomique continuait de défier le bon sens et fut contredite par une accumulation de preuves défavorables. Affirmer que le chô- mage était toujours volontaire don- nait une explication assez incroyable de la Grande Dépression des années 1930 : nos grands-parents se seraient mis eux-mêmes en chômage pendant 10 ans en s’entêtant à rejeter les emplois disponibles parce qu’ils jugeaient les salaires offerts insuf- fisants ! En fait, si vraiment les hausses de chômage qui accompag- nent les récessions découlaient d’un refus de travailler en raison de salaires jugés insuffisants, les travailleurs seraient beaucoup plus nombreux à démissionner de leurs postes d’emploi pendant les récessions que pendant les expansions. Or, c’est bel et bien le contraire qui est observé : les démis- sions sont nettement moins fréquentes pendant les récessions. (Et on comprend pourquoi !)\n\nEt devinez quoi? Après ce nouveau recul des idées classiques, Keynes est maintenant de retour! Un collègue l’a même baptisé « le Lapin Energizer de l’économie ». Les 15 dernières années ont été témoins d’une remon- tée extraordinaire des idées keyné- siennes, sous l’influence de chercheurs tels que George Akerlof et Joseph Stiglitz, lauréats du Prix Nobel 2001, et de plusieurs autres. Sur le terrain concret de la politique monétaire, le président de la banque centrale des Etats-Unis, Alan Greenspan, doit pra- tiquement tout son succès aux idées de Keynes.\n\nNaturellement, le livre de Keynes ne sera jamais lu autant qu’un roman d’Alexandre Jardin ou de Marie Laberge. Mais, croyez-le ou non, j’ai récemment rencontré, sur le vol 150 d’Air Canada de Vancouver à Montréal, une agente de bord qui lisait la Théorie générale pendant sa pause. « C’est un peu difficile à suivre, me confia-t-elle, mais il paraît que c’est un des livres les plus importants du 20e siècle. »\n\nFort bien dit, madame!\n\nPierre Fortin est professeur au départe- ment d’économie à l’Université du Québec à Montréal.

Not that ”œroot causes” are irrelevant, but we are relearning some of the terrain proper- ly covered by that phrase. As Clifford Orwin so aptly put it in the National Post, ”œAristotle had it right 2,300 years ago: Men don’t become tyrants in order to get in from the cold.”\n\nOne could learn the same lesson from my book of choice: The Federalist Papers. Hastily written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay (under the composite pseudonym of Publius) to encourage New Yorkers to ratify the American Constitution, this series of newspaper articles forms a remarkably coherent and substantial contribution to political and constitu- tional thought.\n\nI first read The Federalist in gradu- ate school in the mid-1970s, under the tutelage of Walter Berns. Other books I was reading at the time had a more immediate impact on me, and some of those (Plato’s Republic, for example) rank ahead of The Federalist on my all- time list. There are few books, howev- er, that have stayed with me as long or that I turn to more regularly for politi- cal and constitutional guidance, even about the most current issues””Sept. 11, for example.\n\nFor all of their profound differ- ences, Aristotle and Publius would agree that the ”œroot causes” of September 11 extend well beyond eco- nomic inequality. True, Madison in Federalist 10 identifies the ”œunequal distribution of property” as ”œthe most common and durable source of fac- tions”; far more dangerous, however, is the burning desire of the ambitious few for ”œpre-eminence and power,” mir- rored by a similar lust for victory among their followers. This desire for pre-eminence contributes to a propensity for ”œmutual animosities” so strong ”œthat where no substantial occasion presents itself the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been suffi- cient to kindle … unfriendly passions and excite [the] most violent conflicts.”\n\nNot only is property a less danger- ous source of faction, but Madison actually considers it ”œthe first object of government” to protect ”œthe diversity in the faculties of men from which the rights of property originate.” In effect, government should promote the ”œmost durable” source of faction in order to counteract the most danger- ous source. The desire for pre-emi- nence on the part of at least some of the ambitious few will then be divert- ed into the building of commercial empires, while the consumer benefici- aries become less likely recruits for warlike crusades.\n\nNot all of the ambitious few in modern commercial society become captains of industry, of course. Some continue to pursue political pre-emi- nence, but here too there are ways of harnessing ambition to the public good. The answer lies in representative democracy organized in a system of checks and balances in which ”œambi- tion [is] made to counteract ambition.”\n\nIn all of this, The Federalist is unblinkingly realistic about human nature. ”œIf men were angels,” says Madison, ”œno government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be nec- essary.” Since men aren’t angels, how- ever””since bellicose factionalism is ”œsown in the nature of man”””one needs arrangements that supply ”œby opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives.” One must fight fire with fire, in other words””and one must do so endlessly. Do you think that the ills of the human condition can be ultimately solved? Do you want to fight the ”œwar to end all wars,” or root out terrorism once and for all? Take an antidote: read The Federalist.\n\nBut take the full dose. If you end up agreeing with Kant that appropriate checks and balances make decent poli- tics possible even for a race of intelli- gent devils, you’ve passed too quickly over Federalist 55. Publius may think it important to compensate institutional- ly for the ”œdefect of better motives,” but he doesn’t think better motives are unnecessary or lacking. Just as there is ”œa degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of cir- cumspection and distrust,” says Madison, ”œso there are other qualities in human nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence.” Moreover, liberal democratic govern- ment ”œpresupposes the existence of these qualities in a higher degree than any other form.” In other words, with- out ”œsufficient virtue among men for self-government,…nothing less than the chains of despotism can restrain them from destroying and devouring one another.” Social conservatives, take heart. While government as soulcraft is not central to Publius’ agenda, his reflections surely count against state- supported hostility to conventional virtue and its seedbeds.\n\nPerhaps the requisite virtue can survive social libertarianism. Certainly, the muscular response of America to the events of September 11 means that citizens of that nation are not as dis- solute as social conservatives some- times fear. But the same events should remind libertarians of The Federalist’s warning not to conflate limited gov- ernment with weak government. Government properly limited in the ends it pursues must nevertheless be powerful enough to achieve those ends. The libertarians among us worry about the power imbalance between the state leviathan and the puny indi- vidual. In the words of Canada’s Supreme Court, the state should come under special scrutiny when it stands as the ”œsingular antagonist” of the individual. Well, yes, the power of the state is indeed a source of danger, but as Publius knew, it is also an essential source of protection.\n\nHow to achieve the correct balance? Therein lies the great difficulty: ”œYou must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.” In achieving the latter, ”œa dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control.” But not an overly direct dependence. No recall of elected repre- sentatives, for example. In The Federalist one finds a powerful defence of repre- sentative government against populism.\n\nRepresentative democracy may be the ”œprimary control,” but it is not enough. ”œExperience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.” These include the sepa- ration of powers and the checks and balances already referred to. Judicial review of the Constitution is one of those checks. On the other hand, Publius defended the Constitution against those who decried its lack of a bill of rights, arguing that the existing document, without what later became the first 10 amendments, was ”œitself, in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, a bill of rights.” Yes, that was Hamilton writing, not Madison, who later became the father of the Bill of Rights, shepherding it through the first Congress. Until then, however, Madison had been a staunch critic of the ”œparchment bar- riers” of a bill of rights. Robert Goldwin argues that Madison assumed leadership of the Bill of Rights movement in the First Congress as a prudential concession to political reality and in order to ensure a much weaker bill than its partisans wanted. However that may be, Publius certainly provides consid- erable food for thought on the issue of judicial power, as on so many others.\n\nAnd that is my point. The Federalist is a rich source of political wisdom on many of our public issues. Do you want to think clearly about the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government and the proper relations between them? I would not be alone in directing you to The Federalist Papers. Ditto for fed- eralism itself, the novel modern understanding of which was first laid out by Publius. What about the rela- tionship between the institutional devices of liberal democracy and com- mercial capitalism? Again, The Federalist is very revealing. Are you perplexed by the debate between pop- ulism and representative govern- ment? Between the advocates and critics of judicial power? Consult Publius. How about an analysis of human passions and their relation- ship to public life? On this last ques- tion, Plato, Aristotle or Shakespeare might go deeper into the heart of the human soul, but Publius is far from a shallow analyst. He certainly knows why the desire to get in from the cold explains neither tyrants nor terrorists.\n\nRainer Knopff teaches in the Department of Political Science, University of Calgary.\n\nJeff Rose\n\nSidney and Beatrice Webb\n\nStatutory Authorities for Special Purposes (1922)\n\nNot long after the First World War, as the forerunners of Thatcherism at Westminster brayed against the damnable socialistic practice of gov- ernment regulation, denouncing it for being at loggerheads with the creed of individualistic enterprise, a well-aimed work of scholarship was published whose purpose was to defend both government regulation and its sup- porting doctrine””a doctrine of com- munal cooperation which understood individualistic aspirations to be a potential threat to projects that were intended to benefit the collectivity, and which relied upon government regulation to nullify that potential threat.\n\nDrawing most of its detail from thousands of examples of communal cooperation which lay documented in parish and county records dating from the 13th century, the book reminded its readers why regulation had been practised over the length and breadth of England since the time of the Norman Conquest and likely before. The self-imposed task of uncovering these records and of eluci- dating the thinking that lay beneath the regulatory regimes whose histo- ries were told there was a crowning accomplishment of Sidney and Beatrice Webb, whose researches into the nooks and crannies of English public policy produced the massive history of English local government of which the book in question, Statutory Authorities for Special Purposes (1922), was the final volume.\n\nA magnificent work of literature, research and advocacy, Statutory Authorities for Special Purposes is peer- less as an introduction to the later development of government as an instrument of collective welfare. It was also historically original, focusing the reader’s attention on a variety of unconventional sources of insight into the permanent tension between com- munal needs and individualistic impulsions.\n\nThe Webbs’ research unearthed the roots of government regulation not, as might have been expected, in communal cooperation that was aimed, for example, at suppressing the spread of communicable diseases or the spread of fire, but rather in the communal cooperation that was nec- essary for the creation and mainte- nance of such improvements as embankments, drainage sewers and sluices in order to render the land hab- itable; primitive systems of main roads known as turnpikes; urban services-in- common including lighting, paving, ”œwatching” and cleansing; and rudi- mentary measures whose purpose was to alleviate destitution.\n\nIn all cases, the Webbs found that the rich documentary record disclosed similar histories. A collectivity, beset by a natural challenge which had to be overcome, but could not be overcome unless every appertaining individual could be counted on completely, invariably found that mere social norms were insufficient to ensure the primacy of collective interests over individualistic aspirations. Human nature being what it is, merely infor- mal pressure to conform was inade- quate to make certain, for example, that every individual owning part of a wall of turf which kept the sea at bay would maintain his own part in good repair. Yet he must, because everyone’s livelihood depended on his doing so. It followed that the behaviour of every appertaining individual had to be reg- ulated, a task performed at first by local magistrates, later by county insti- tutions and eventually by means of private legislation from Westminster. In certain cases, it was even judged necessary to confer an exclusive right to act upon municipal or county insti- tutions, thereby removing individual- istic enterprise from the picture alto- gether and with it, any residual threat to the interests of the collective.\n\nSometimes the benefits of regula- tion were distributed with a degree of equity; sometimes regulation was indistinguishable from class rule. Nonetheless, the result was that by the time the English political system began to democratize the concept of the common good””that is, to widen the definition of society to incorpo- rate more and more of its members, thereby enlarging the ambit of the collectivity to which the benefits of communal cooperation would be dis- tributed””centuries of experience had delivered and nurtured a dependable mindset about how to accomplish any collective purpose, practical or moral, which really mattered to the society.\n\nThis mindset can be said to have encompassed the following prescrip- tive propositions. If a common chal- lenge had to be surmounted, if guar- anteeing an outcome really mattered to the society, if the effectiveness of the communal project was too important to allow it to be jeopard- ized by individualistic aspirations, then government regulation was necessary. On the other hand, if guaranteeing an outcome did not really matter, the life of the collec- tivity in that regard could be deter- mined by the interaction of individ- ualistic impulsions, that is, shaped by market forces. Put another way, if the society did not turn to govern- ment regulation to guarantee an out- come, but left the outcome to be determined by market forces, the society was declaring that whatever ultimately resulted in that regard did not really matter.\n\nWhatever you might think of these propositions (they’ve always seemed pretty sensible to me) they surely provide an interesting way to think about such contemporary issues as security screening at airports, or whether to let the market decide how much hydroelectric power will be produced, at what price and for whom. If a society does not turn to government regulation to guarantee an outcome, but leaves the outcome to be determined by market forces, the society is declaring that whatever ulti- mately results in that regard does not really matter. Yet as far as those con- temporary issues are concerned, the outcomes appear to matter to society a great deal, do they not? So the way forward ought to be clear.\n\nTruth be told, reading Statutory Authorities for Special Purposes over 30 years ago was not a road-to-Damascus moment for me. In fact my youthful influences were a heterodox tabernacle of scholars and doers from which the Fabians were largely absent. But Statutory Authorities for Special Purposes belongs on these pages for the simple but sufficient reason that it sets an inspirationally high standard for com- mitted advocacy and scholarship by practitioners of public policy and aca- demics alike.\n\nJeff Rose is Senior Fellow in the Harrowston Program on Conflict Management and Negotiation at the University of Toronto.\n\nJohn F. Helliwell\n\nK.C. Wheare\n\nFederal Government (3rd edition, 1953)\n\nand\n\nReport of the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations (The Rowell-Sirois Report, 1940)\n\nTo choose a book or books that had the most influence on my policy thinking, I knew I would have to go a long way back. Once a few thousand volumes have passed before your eyes, and been assessed in the light of many years of experience, it is too much to expect a single book to fundamentally change the course of your thinking. John McCallum’s paper showing trade intensities more than 20 times greater among Canadian provinces than between provinces and U.S. states has had an enormous influence on my own subsequent research and policy analysis, as has Robert Putnam’s research on social capital. But both were in discussion paper form when they had their influence.\n\nI finally came up with two books: the Rowell-Sirois Report (The Report of the Royal Commission on Dominion- Provincial Relations, 1940) and K.C. Wheare’s Federal Government (third edi- tion, 1953). Both had their influence because they were two of the three principal texts (the third being The Federalist Papers of Hamilton, Jay and Madison) used by John Deutsch in his senior UBC political science course on federalism, which I took in the late 1950s. In his deft hands, these books revealed the complexity and fascina- tion of the interplay between institu- tions, events and political thought, set in a context where people matter indi- vidually, collectively and in their enriching diversity. Deutsch not only sowed the seeds of my life long fasci- nation with societies and how they work, but offered countless instances where evidence and careful thought had been combined to fashion policies to improve the quality of life.\n\nThose were heady days for federal- ism, before the federal constitutions adopted by so many new African states in the 1960s failed to fulfill their design- ers’ hopes for post-colonial progress. These failed experiments demonstrated once more the truth of John Deutsch’s insistence that the success of institutions depends on the norms and networks of society (what has under Putnam’s influ- ence come to be called ”œsocial capital”). An unintended refresher course was pro- vided by the experience of the former Soviet Union in the decade following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Most of those studying the transition understood the importance of establishing an institu- tional framework to support and facili- tate transition, but all were surprised by the speed with which the initial institu- tional vacuum was filled by criminal alternatives to social order, and widely anticipated economic convergence was replaced by years of shrinking output, growing inequality, rising mortality and crime and crumbling trust.\n\nEven among heavy readers, I sus- pect my experience is common””that certain books had a profound impor- tance because they were tools in the hands of a master scholar. If John Deutsch has not made the Rowell- Sirois Report come alive as the chroni- cle of a society thinking out its prob- lems, it would have remained just another official document for me.\n\nJohn Helliwell is Professor of Economics at the University of British Columbia and a member of IRPP’s Board of Directors.\n\nChristina Spencer\n\nAyn Rand\n\nAtlas Shrugged (1957)\n\nI am sitting on the Toronto-Ottawa train””which arrived 15 minutes late at my stop, and which will lose anoth- er 30 minutes before reaching its final destination””and re-reading one of the most powerful policy books of our era: Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged. The exercise feels a bit odd, since the plot centres on a transcontinental railroad system crumbling due to bad public policy. As VIA Rail adds reading time to my schedule, I console myself that at least our transportation systems, rail includ- ed, aren’t going to crumble today.\n\nBut maybe tomorrow.\n\nAll public policy, after all, is based on philosophical principles, and if the principles are wrong, the future will be messy. Ayn Rand’s genius is that she identified these principles in a format accessible to all””not just wonks and politicians””by writing a novel that has enjoyed huge popularity since its pub- lication in 1957. For all that her intel- lectual opponents accuse Ms. Rand of being cruel and elitist for having creat- ing tough, uncompromising heroes, it is her insistence on bringing philoso- phy down to earth that truly infuriates the college crowd. Their favourite cry is that her views are ”œsimplistic.” They aren’t; they are simply clear.\n\nI read this book for the first time when I was 14, and, as the cliché goes, it changed my life. Morality had always mattered, but I rarely chal- lenged my moral premises. Altruism was good. Money was the root of all evil. Enjoying one’s own achievement was selfish. Corporations were evil.\n\nAtlas Shrugged rapidly changed those views. But its broader impact was in convincing me that one must base one’s actions on a framework of consistent principles””which required both identifying the roots of those principles and constantly testing them by their effects in the real world. Philosophical evasion is out.\n\nRand’s fictional villains, who set policy, start with the philosophical principle ”œfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need.” They take it to its logical conclusion, which is the destruction of individual creativity, of personal incentive and, ultimately, of human happiness. They do it through legislative initiatives such as the ”œanti-dog-eat-dog policy” which hamstrings competition; the ”œequalization of opportunity” bill, which forces successful businesses to divest themselves of some assets so others will have a ”œchance”; and the ”œfair share law,” which allows competi- tors access to a producer’s products so that they may enjoy profits whether or not they do any innovation of their own. Versions of all of these laws exist in Western countries today. Indeed, the specifics of Ms. Rand’s ”œfictional” legis- lation are mimicked in many modern laws. Which shows that ideas have practical, predictable consequences.\n\nThe fictional demise of the railroad at the centre of this book eerily foreshadows the current state of the airline industry. The key plot twist”” productive men finally refusing to martyr themselves to those who feel entitled to their work without pay- ment””points directly to the Canadian ”œbrain drain.” (Conrad Black, in decid- ing that he would no longer put up with the philosophical disgrace that passes for much of government policy in this country, can be easily imagined as a character from Atlas Shrugged.)\n\nHow do governments get away with policies that any good economist (or reasonable person, for that matter) knows are unsound? Because produc- tive men and women, specifically entrepreneurs, tacitly accept the ideas behind such policies.\n\nI’ve sat through far too many edi- torial boards where a corporate CEO or equivalent refuses to condemn an inept government initiative, lest we think his only motive is profit. Profit, we all know, is evil; that’s a philosoph- ical axiom. That’s why Allan Rock attacked ”œbig pharma” in the Cipro affair last fall. That’s why he was will- ing to see his officials flout regulations in the name of a perceived public need. ”œBig pharma’s” response? While defending its patent rights, it never once tried a moral defence of the right to earn a profit.\n\nTo that, Ayn Rand would say: ”œCheck your premises.” Profit-vs.-need gets a good look in Atlas Shrugged in one character’s ”œspeech” on why the profit motive is profoundly moral.

I thought I might major in eco- nomics, but I wasn’t sure, so I also checked out a number of other disci- plines during my first year. In the eco- nomics stream, a first-year student had two choices in those days at the U of C. He or she could take the standard micro and macro introductory courses””in classrooms which were already bursting at the seams (long before fiscal restraint hit the campuses), presided over by teachers who taught the laws of eco- nomics as if they were laws of physics.\n\nThe other option was to take a sin- gle full-year course called ”œThe Economics of Capitalism.” The course title alone suggested something rather subversive. It was taught by Robert Wright, an eclectic, open-minded pro- fessor who had sold men’s suits in an earlier incarnation. For most econo- mists, well-versed in the logic and beau- ty of free markets, capitalism is a natural state of being: there is no need to actu- ally name it. Simply to use the ”œc-word” is to open the possibility that the cur- rent state of economic affairs might only be a way station en route to some- thing else. I immediately signed up.\n\nProfessor Wright assigned three textbooks for the year-long course, one of which was a thin paperback volume costing only eight dollars at the U of C. bookstore. (Twenty-two years later, the price tag is still firmly affixed to my dog-eared copy.) This alone was enough to merit immediate plaudits from shell- shocked students, reeling at the price of textbooks. But it got much better when we actually started to read the thing.\n\nThe Age of the Economist turned me on to economics. Instead of throwing novice students straight into a deep end full of supply-and-demand graphs and invertible matrices, the book didn’t have a single graph or equation. (It does include a couple of simple flow charts to help readers visualize the logic of particular arguments, but they don’t really count). In other words, this was an eco- nomics book that spoke English.\n\nThe book provides a readable, almost suspenseful overview of the evo- lution of economic thought, embedded in an equally dense history of global economic development. The early mar- ket theorists are introduced in the con- text of the early rise of merchant capi- talism and, later, its industrial progeny. Then the subsequent emergence of rad- ical economic theorists, from Owen to Marx to Lange to Sweezy, is described along with the ferment of the times in which they lived. Post-war debates in economic theory””even obscure ones, like the ”œtwo-Cambridges” controver- sies, real business cycle debates and monetary targeting””come alive because they were vested with a broad- er socio-political significance.\n\nLearning economics this way, this wide-eyed first-year student was impressed with a lesson that is unfortu- nately lost on most economists. Human beings are not atoms, and their eco- nomic behaviour cannot really be explained in the same way that physi- cists model velocities and gravities. (In fact, in this postmodern era even physi- cists recognize considerably more con- tingency and uncertainty than most economists do.) Competing economic theories reflect the power struggles and politics of the societies in which they are developed. Hence, economic theo- ries evolve over time to reflect the rise and fall of the broad political-economic regimes which spawned them.\n\nThe absolutist, ahistorical econom- ics that is standard fare in mainstream economics departments misses this per- spective. The fact that the history of economic thought, and even economic history itself, is hardly taught anymore in university economics programs is ample testimony to the arrogance and narrow-mindedness of the profession. And the decline in economics enroll- ments is a further warning of the poten- tial irrelevance of the discipline; for some reason, building highly technical models of atomistic Pavlovian behav- iour does not strike many critical-think- ing young people as a rewarding life’s vocation. If more economists started thinking and writing like Fusfeld, who deliberately linked the evolution of eco- nomics to the evolution of human soci- ety, a lot more students would get turned onto the subject, and economics would be all the better for it.\n\nIn the preface to the version of his book which I studied from (the third edition, published in 1977), Fusfeld wrote:\n\nThis book tries to show how one discipline [economics] is related to the great issues that have troubled people everywhere””order versus freedom, riches and poverty, privilege and equality, human welfare, material and moral values, and others. It is easy to get so involved in the intricacies of economics that we lose sight of these larger issues. Here they are pushed to the front of the stage, for economics has always been an instrument through which we may achieve a bet- ter understanding of the great prob- lems that have troubled humankind.\n\nFusfeld’s book helped convince me that economics was indeed the dis- cipline that could contribute the most to helping to solve pressing human problems, and so I majored in econom- ics. If I had enrolled in the standard micro-macro course path, and seen eco- nomics first through the standard text- books””which spend more time explaining the difference between mar- ginal and average functions than addressing pressing real-world concerns like poverty and environmental degra- dation””I would not be an economist today. Some of my colleagues, who think that ”œunion economist” is a con- tradiction in terms, probably think that would have been a good thing.\n\nThe Age of the Economist is now into its ninth edition, its author about to turn 80 years old. The latest edition includes, according to a breathless announcement from the publisher, an all-new chapter on ”œThe New Economy.” Oh yeah, I remember the New Economy. That was the world in which computer technology powered unmeasurable pro- ductivity gains, the business cycle was a thing of the past, and high-tech com- panies didn’t have to worry about the old rules of business. We didn’t study the New Economy in first-year eco- nomics classes in 1979; and I doubt that first-year economics students will be studying it five years from now, either.\n\nThe long-lived perspective I gained from seeing economics first through Fusfeld’s eyes is that it is a historically relative and ideologically loaded disci- pline””no matter how positivist its practitioners pretend to make it, with their charts and graphs and grids and formulas. So when powerful people started telling me that problems like class conflict, unemployment and inequality were all passé now that we had the Internet, I was immediately very suspicious. I doubted that there was anything new at all about the New Economy. And now I look pretty smart. (I never bought a single share in Nortel Networks, either.) And given the events of the past year, I suspect that Fusfeld himself is already busy on a tenth edi- tion, featuring an all-new chapter titled ”œPlus ça change, plus c’est la meme chose.”\n\nJim Stanford is an economist with the Canadian Auto Workers, and current chairperson of the Progressive Economics Forum (www.web.ca/~pef).

Contemporary critics may denounce government from the centre, but the centre was much narrower in the past when prime ministers made policy while perched on the loneliest heights.\n\nLaurier made certain his principal minister Clifford Sifton was absent when he decided how Alberta and Saskatchewan would become provinces. R.B. Bennett forgot the names of his francophone ministers when he intro- duced them to the press after the elec- tion of 1930. Mackenzie King despised policy gatherings and became constipat- ed during the famous Liberal policy con- ference of 1933. The conference’s end brought immediate relief.\n\nThose who studied Canadian gov- ernment from the 1940s through the early 1960s relied upon such eminent scholars as Dawson, Ward, Corry and Hodgetts whose worthy texts concen- trated upon the constitutional, institu- tional and administrative foundations of the Canadian government. These were the texts for Canadians even though the so-called ”œpolicy sciences” had become the academic fashion at American universities in the early 1950s. Canadian politicians rarely wrote mem- oirs and, when they did, said little. The country’s powerful bureaucrats rivalled Opus Dei in their commitment to the oath of secrecy. As a humble summer student in the Department of External Affairs in 1966, I made the mistake of praising Jim Eayrs’ In Defence of Canada, which explained national security poli- cy in the interwar years. I was severely rebuked by the division head who expressed the view that Professor Eayrs had betrayed the trust of Canadian offi- cials and should be arrested.\n\nAll came undone in the later 1960s, including the diary of Mackenzie King where Eayrs had found so many of the secrets when he worked on the King biography. When R.M. Dawson, King’s official biographer, read King’s diary in the 1950s, he treated it as a parson would pornography. On the lonely heights, King made policy””on Empire, on social welfare, on the provinces and on war. Rare are the references to sections 91 and 92 of the BNA Act in the King diary; fre- quent are the clashes of personality, the bursts of memory and the invocation of the deity as a guiding force. In under- standing how political decisions are made, no document tells more.\n\nReading Mackenzie King’s diary in the early 1970s when ”œpolicy,” ”œpartic- ipation” and ”œprocess” were the new mantras of early Trudeau Ottawa, I felt the windows on past politics come open. This stiff, prissy prime minister had bequeathed a document that explained better than any other how decisions had been made in Canada. King had wanted the record sup- pressed, but those bureaucrats he trust- ed most, the civil servants who had always kept the secrets, betrayed him. As Philip Larkin said of sexual inter- course after 1963, all that went before belonged to yesterday’s tomorrow.\n\nJohn English is an historian at Waterloo University and a former Member of Parliament.

I was exposed to Blalock during my graduate studies. In my case, he was preaching to the converted. After all, I was doing my Ph.D. so that I could do quantitative empirical research.\n\nYet reading Blalock was a cultural shock. His starting point was that ”œcausal thinking belongs completely on the theoretical level and [that] causal laws can never be demonstrated empirically” (Causal Inferences, 6). I was being told that what I wanted to do was an unattainable objective. I had to learn to become sceptical about everything, including social science research.\n\nBlalock’s point is that it is impos- sible to test causal statements without making some simplifying assumptions about the direction of causality, about the potential effect of ”œother” factors not explicitly incorporated into the analysis and about the relationship between the theoretical concepts and the empirical measures. In my view, his point is indisputable. This is a les- son in humility which it is in the interest of all social scientists never to forget.\n\nOne of the lessons I have drawn from Blalock is that any analysis entails some simplification. This has led me to be wary both of those who criticize others for being simplistic and of those who ”œsimplistically” think that it is possible to come up with ”œcomplete,” ”œexhaustive,” ”œholistic” accounts of social life. I suspect that these people do not really appreciate the complexity of social phenomena. Any interpretation is necessarily a sim- plification of a complex process.\n\nRight after asserting that causal laws cannot be demonstrated empiri- cally, Blalock adds that ”œthis does not mean that it is not helpful to think causally and to develop causal models that have implications that are indi- rectly testable” (Causal Inferences, 6). One of the great advantages of causal thinking is clarity. When I teach, when I conduct research, and when I try to make sense of contemporary events, I spontaneously ask myself the three following questions: What is going on exactly? Why? And what will it change? Making sense of reali- ty entails providing an accurate (though simplified) description of that reality and examining its causes and consequences. This can be achieved only by clearly distinguish- ing these three questions, and by ask- ing oneself what we should observe if what we think””our hypothesis””is right and if it is wrong.\n\nIn Blalock’s Theory Construction, there is a particularly interesting section on block-recursive systems that I have found quite helpful in doing research and in making sense of the world. Blalock shows that it is possible, when thinking in terms of a complex model including a great number of variables, to combine these variables into blocs of interrelated factors and to focus on one bloc at a time. But he also insists that this is possible only if we assume a (block-recursive) system in which the temporal and causal sequence of the blocs is clearly laid out. The message is that it is possible to introduce some degree of complexi- ty, provided some simplifying assumptions are made.\n\nThinking in terms of block-recur- sive systems helps us to distinguish ”œproximate” and ”œdistant” causal fac- tors. Some people, for reasons of their own, like to focus on the former and others on the latter, but some of the debate about which are more impor- tant seems to me misguided. Let us recognize that different factors play a qualitatively different role in the causal sequence.\n\nThat being said, Blalock has nev- ertheless convinced me that we should have a particular concern for the most distant factors. The reason is that failing to incorporate an impor- tant distant factor is more consequen- tial than not including even a crucial proximate one. In the latter case, the consequence is that the explanation is only quite partial, that it does not fully elaborate the causal process. In the former, the risk is that the expla- nation is simply wrong, because the relationship is spurious. I can live with partial explanations; I do not want to be dead wrong.\n\nThe implication is that when I study the vote, for instance, I start with the most distant factors, old fash- ioned socio-demographic characteris- tics, such as the regional cleavage. That should only be the starting point of the analysis, but it should be the starting point nevertheless. I think Blalock would approve.\n\nAndré Blais is Professor of Political Science at l’Université de Montréal.\n\nRobin Boadway\n\nAnthony Downs\n\nAn Economic Theory of Democracy (1957)\n\nand\n\nJames Buchanan and Gordon Tullock\n\nThe Calculus of Consent (1962)\n\nPolitical economy””the study of how political processes condition policy outcomes””is very much the fashion nowadays among academic econo- mists. Public choice explanations of government behaviour abound, and policy prescriptions are subjected to the joint tests of political feasibility and immunity to public sector failure. The current methodology owes much to two remarkable, persuasive and highly readable books: An Economic Theory of Democracy by Anthony Downs, published in 1957, and The Calculus of Consent, by James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, pub- lished in 1962. These two books launched the field of public choice, and the ideas in them have formed the basis for the way most economists view the political process. They were the first public finance books I read as a graduate student at Queen’s, even before Richard Musgrave’s great 1959 treatise The Theory of Public Finance, from which my generation learned the field. In fact, the Downs and Buchanan-Tullock books conditioned my appreciation for the latter.\n\nThe contents of the books are dis- armingly intuitive, and my brief discussion of their many ideas will by no means do them justice. Downs argued that since politicians are peo- ple, their actions will be driven by self-interest. Their main concern is to be elected, and in a parliamentary sys- tem of government, the vehicle for election is the political party. Downs constructed a model of political party competition in which party platforms are determined solely by the objective of maximizing votes. He recognized that majority voting can lead to certain instabilities or cyclical majorities, especially where redistributive out- comes are at stake. However, he argued that uncertainties and imper- fect information on behalf of both voters and political parties would mit- igate the vote-cycling problem, an approach that anticipates the notion of probabilistic voting that has come to dominate modern-day political competition models. Downs recog- nized that there was a place for ideo- logical differences between political parties, but since ”œeach party realizes that some citizens vote by means of ideologies rather than policies, … it fashions an ideology which it believes will attract the greatest number of vot- ers” (100). Thus, even ideology is pre- scribed by the desire to get elected.\n\nBuchanan and Tullock, on the other hand, also accept the self-inter- ested version of political decision- makers, but view the role of the polit- ical process from a more contractual perspective. Collective, and coercive, choice is essentially a means by which unexploited gains from trade are internalized. Because of the free-rider problem, this cannot be done by vol- untary contract: governments are needed. However, collective decision- making comes with costs. For one, governments can be inefficient. They are susceptible to lobbying, log-rolling and the like. For another, since una- nimity is not a feasible voting rule, the political process is liable not just to internalize free riding, but also to redistribute. This is viewed as a potential cost imposed by the government on citizens, who may find themselves on the wrong side of redistributive policy. Constitutional rules ought to trade off the potential benefits to citi- zens from participating in collective decisions through the political process against the possible inefficiencies and confiscation of property that such decisions will inevitably entail.\n\nThese important tracts have been very influential for my own thinking about policy issues, though not in a way that might be predicted. My reaction to them has been a bit contrary. They have served to reinforce, and even to form, my view that the world needs sound normative policy analysis, unfettered by considerations of political feasibility, as a complement to political economy-based policy analysis. In other words, the lessons I have taken from these books concern the limitations, rather than the poten- tial, of public choice for informing nor- mative policy analysis. In particular, I can think of three important and relat- ed reasons why normative policy analysis should not necessarily feel constrained by political feasibility.\n\nFirst, neither these books nor the public choice theory that has followed have succeeded in resolving the most fundamental problem of collective decision-making””how to deal with the redistributive dimension. It is no exaggeration to say that government is largely an institution for redistribu- tion: virtually everything it does has redistributive consequences, whether intended or not. (Try and identify policies that make no one worse off.) Regrettably, policy analysis must be based on some value judgment, if only implicitly, about how to weigh the gains and losses of different citizens. Political economy models offer little guidance on these matters. Indeed, redistribution is their Achilles heel. It is well known that if politicians, vot- ers and bureaucrats all behaved in their own self-interest, chaos would ensue, and this cannot be precluded by Downsian notions of uncertainty and probabilistic voting. I would pre- fer to think that there must be some consensus over basic social values, and normative analysis can contribute to searching for that consensus.\n\nSecond, political economy models simply cannot capture the reality and complexity of political decision-mak- ing. We economists have been seduced by the niceties of the market mechanism, and the way it reconciles and coordinates millions of conflict- ing decisions made every day. Conceiving of a political marketplace that is analogous to the economic marketplace reflects the conceit of economics. Political institutions are not like economic models, and there is no analogue of prices as a device to facilitate equilibrium outcomes. As Arrow pointed out in his profound but exacting 1951 tract Social Choice and Individual Values (a great and demand- ing read, but not for the weak of heart), there is no mechanism that will readily guarantee stable collective choice outcomes. And, this is true without the additional complication of institutions, transaction costs, and so on. The implication I take from this observation is that since political out- comes are ultimately unpredictable, even if one wanted to use political fea- sibility as a constraint on policy advice, it would be practically impos- sible to do so. Political feasibility is simply too elusive a concept. What is feasible is what the public can be per- suaded to accept, and what politicians can be persuaded to enact.\n\nThat being the case, political out- comes can be manipulated, which brings us to the third reason why nor- mative policy analysis should not nec- essarily feel constrained by political feasibility. Since collective decisions must be based on some value judg- ment, and since some consensus about value judgments is necessary for a stable society, part of the purpose of normative analysis is to inform the political process rather than the reverse. In other words, part of the purpose of normative policy analysis is to persuade or advocate, and that involves winning over the public to one’s own scheme of values. It being impossible to prescribe policy without such value judgments, it is highly desirable to be up-front about those values, rather than to hide beneath the cloak of political feasibility.\n\nThese considerations have per- suaded me that there is room in public policy discourse for normative analysis that does not take political feasibility to be a binding constraint. It is both intellectually and ethically justified, and might even lead to good things in the end. It can be argued that some of the more important pol- icy changes that we have witnessed in Canada in the post-war period would not have come about had political fea- sibility been (mistakenly) treated as a constraint””think of free trade, medicare, the GST””and it seems to me that it is important that at least some economists are adamant about eschewing political feasibility in pur- suing their work.\n\nThis might seem like a strange conclusion to draw from reading the two books that parented the whole field of public choice. (It was certainly not the response expected from my professor at the time, Walter Hettich, who has earned a reputation as a dis- tinguished scholar of public choice.) That said, the books, especially Downs’, still make fascinating reading. I would highly recommend that anyone interested in serious policy analysis do read them, though no doubt the response elicited will not typically be as contrary as mine.\n\nRobin Boadway is Sir Edward Peacock Professor of Political Economy at Queen’s University.\n\nHeather MacIvor\n\nNiccolà² Machiavelli\n\nThe Prince (1514)\n\nFor me, politics and government are interesting insofar as they relate to what makes people tick. A fascination with individual and group psychology lies at the heart of my approach to pol- itics. I was born and raised a Nova Scotia Tory. Politics was the air I breathed, but politics of a particular kind. It revolved around personalities and passions, not abstract principles. Which people would join which party faction? How can we get this particular person ”œonside”? How many of his friends will follow him? It has always been crystal-clear to me that love and hate, loyalty and fear, friendship and resentment fuel the political machine. My two years as a foot soldier on Parliament Hill only confirmed this conviction. If we do not take into account such basic truths as the ego and ambition of the individual politi- cian, or the group pressures which are essential to effective political organiza- tion, then we really have no idea what politics and government are about. After all, if politics isn’t about real, live human beings, then what’s the point?\n\nNeedless to say, my psychological understanding of politics has often gotten me into trouble. In gradu- ate school my work was sometimes derided as ”œjournalistic,” a ”œPeople mag- azine” approach to a discipline based on general laws. The quirks of personal- ity had no place in the modern ”œsci- ence”œ of politics. (Strangely enough, those who adhered most strongly to this view were themselves acute and ardent observers of the personalities and group dynamics which drove the internal politics of their own depart- ment.DoasIsay,notasIdo.)WhenI suggested to one of my professors that his pet theory was rather unrealistic in psychological terms, he replied, in a voice dripping with disdain, ”œOf course, you’ve been a practitioner.” So I am always enthusiastic about books which explore the connection between poli- tics and human nature, if only because they make me feel less like an alien in my own discipline.\n\nOne such book, which I discov- ered in my undergraduate days, is James W. Ceaser’s Presidential Selection: Theory and Development (1979). Ceaser’s historical and institutional analysis of American presidential nomination has profoundly shaped my own under- standing of Canadian party leadership selection, as well as my approach to political institutions in general. In his introduction, Ceaser argues that those who design political institutions must take individual ambition into account. They must craft institutions in such a way as to establish ”œcertain constraints and incentives that promote desired habits and actions and discourage unwanted behaviour.” While he acknowledges that ”œthe ambitious seek what in the first instance is advanta- geous for themselves,” Ceaser is nonetheless optimistic that, when appropriately channelled through well- designed institutions, ”œambition can be used to curb its own natural excesses.” On the other hand, a poorly designed institution perversely rewards behav- iour which undermines the legitimacy of the institution itself and threatens to damage the public good.\n\nThe relevance to current Canadian debates over institutional reform should be obvious. Consider the popu- lar perception that our House of Commons is full of political eunuchs, blindly following their party leaders into ever-lower depths of public esteem. Throw in the recent concern about prime ministerial power, as described by Donald Savoie and Jeffrey Simpson, and the value of Ceaser’s analysis becomes apparent. Government MPs are induced by their ambition to kow- tow to the prime minister, who controls access to the cabinet, parliamentary sec- retaryships, patronage positions, and other rewards for loyalty. The prime minister also appoints the clerk of the Privy Council, and holds the fate of deputy ministers in his hands. So a prime minister with a majority of seats controls the legislative branch, the political executive and the permanent executive. The ambition of MPs, cabi- net ministers and public servants leads them to curry favour with the one man on whom their hopes of advancement depend. No wonder Canada is gov- erned by a ”œfriendly dictatorship,” in Simpson’s phrase.\n\nTo readers interested in pursuing this subject, I recommend two other books; Joseph A. Schlesinger, Ambition and Politics: Political Careers in the United States (1966), for its analysis of ”œpoliti- cal opportunity structures,” and James Q. Wilson, Political Organizations (1974), for its shrewd analysis of insti- tutional incentives and their impact on individual and group behaviour.\n\nBut with the greatest respect to con- temporary political scientists, none of us can hold a candle to the great thinkers of the classical era and the Renaissance. Both Plato and Aristotle understood the connection between politics and human nature, although the former believed that the purpose of politics was to re-create humanity and the latter believed that institutions should be tailored to fit the people they were intended to govern. Once so tailored, they must be adjusted regularly to reflect improvements in the moral and intellectual virtues of the population””an idea later adopted by John Stuart Mill.\n\nTo my mind, the greatest single analysis of personality in politics is Machiavelli’s The Prince, perhaps because Machiavelli, too, was ”œa practi- tioner.” The former Florentine diplo- mat had witnessed the full pageant of Italian Renaissance skullduggery: popes leading armies into battle, popes awarding seats in the College of Cardinals to their illegitimate sons, political murder and torture, the exter- mination of conquered populations and the deliberate violation of Christian teachings in the name of gaining and securing personal power.\n\nNaturally, Machiavelli concluded that politics was a dirty business with little room for conventional morality:\n\n…there is such a gap between how one lives and how one ought to live that anyone who abandons what is done for what ought to be done learns his ruin rather than his preservation; for a man who wishes to profess goodness at all times will come to ruin among so many who are not good.\n\nSuch candour is risky””and refreshing: would that today’s political scientists wrote with such clarity and concision! ””and Machiavelli has paid a high posthumous price. But a careful reading of The Prince, and of his other political writings (especially The Discourses), uncovers the shaky foundations of his notoriety. Machiavelli did not argue that ”œthe ends justify the means,” as is often alleged, nor did he sanction cruel- ty for its own sake. His advice to rulers can perhaps best be summarized, in a paraphrase from one of our own former prime ministers, as ”œevil if necessary, but not necessarily evil.”\n\nThose who sanctimoniously dis- miss the Florentine as the devil incar- nate, and The Prince as ”œTyranny for Dummies,” are living in a fool’s para- dise. Politics is a dirty business, from time to time, as all zero-sum games fuelled by ambition must be. It abounds with flatterers who praise a ruler to the skies and then take full credit for his success (hello there, Warren Kinsella). It is chock-a-block with pious hypocrites whose private dealings bear no resem- blance to their public pronouncements. While contemporary Canadian politics are (mercifully) a good deal less bloody than those of Machiavelli’s day, we have merely switched from actual mur- der to ”œdeath by press release.” The means have changed, but the game and its goals remain the same.\n\nIn recent years, some political sci- entists have attempted to ”œrehabilitate” Machiavelli as a relatively benign figure in the history of political thought. Harvey Mansfield, for example, sug- gests that Machiavelli is the father of the modern executive branch (see his Taming the Prince: The Ambivalence of Modern Executive Power, 1989). While these are noble efforts, it will not do to sanitize Machiavelli completely. Edward Pearce’s delightful book Machiavelli’s Children (1993), takes the Florentine diplomat on his own terms and applies his teachings to the experi- ence of several modern rulers: Franco, Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Thatcher and even George Bush père. Machiavelli ”œuntamed” is immensely valuable as an observer of human nature, particularly the nature of homo politicus.\n\nOddly, many political scientists overlook what may be the most intrigu- ing element of The Prince: the relation- ship between fortuna (luck, destiny, opportunity) and virtù (courage, shrewd- ness, skill). To Machiavelli, the interplay between our opportunities and our abil- ity to take advantage of them deter- mines political success. Perhaps this insight helps to explain an enduring puzzle of Canadian politics: the remark- able longevity and ascendancy of Jean Chrétien, a man without conspicuous verbal or mental gifts. Machiavelli might point out that Chrétien is a deeply shrewd man with a sharp eye for the main chance, and the willingness to seize opportunities when they fall his way. But he might also caution, in light of the political and fiscal crises provoked by September 11, that a prince who relies too heavily on fortuna may lose his crown when Lady Luck deserts him.\n\nMachiavelli’s portrayal of human beings as ”œungrateful, fickle, simulators and deceivers, avoiders of danger, greedy for gain” is incomplete. There are people who enter politics for pure and principled reasons, and a few even manage to hang on to those principles throughout their careers. But Machiavelli’s point is that as long as those other, nasty people play the polit- ical game, they must be dealt with appropriately. The good and the pure will quickly become the powerless and the irrelevant unless they master the techniques of ”œnecessary evil.” Machiavelli’s editorial comment on his advice about dishonesty could stand as the motto for the entire book: ”œIf men were all good, this rule would not be good.” Until politics is populated by saints, The Prince will remain an indis- pensable resource for all who partici- pate in, and observe, political life.\n\nHeather MacIvor teaches political science at the University of Windsor.\n\nNeil Brooks\n\nReport of the Royal Commission on Taxation (The Carter Commission, 1966)\n\nand\n\nLouis Eisenstein\n\nTh"
