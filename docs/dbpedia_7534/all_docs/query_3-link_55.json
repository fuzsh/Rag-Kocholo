        "text": "New left’s strategy: change the party, remake the socialist alliance\n\nAcross the 1960s and ‘70 s, British society and more specifically the postwar settlement have been shaken by what Ralph Miliband defined as a generalized process of de-subordination (Miliband 1978). This process manifested in the reprise of impetus and dynamism on the part of “trade unions, not to mention the great labor struggles, the sharp rise in the Labour vote in 1966, the radicalisation of students, intellectuals […] (Hobsbawm 1981: p. 18), but also in the change in attitudes among “ordinary” citizens (Robinson et al. 2017). Citizens’ engagement with politics of class, race, and gender, as well as changes in allegedly more private domains, turned into a wider “dealignment” from collective roles and allegiances (Lent 2001; Sarlvik & Creve 1983) and entailed the increasing rejection of deference to social hierarchies. Rather similarly to what happened in France and Italy during the long ‘68, the rise of “popular individualism”, while challenging the rigid Keynesian compromise and the hierarchies of the labour movement (Brown & Coates 1969), also led to the establishment of innovative alliances between new expressions of unionism and libertarian movements of various kinds, especially in major urban centres (Gyford 1983). In addition to innovating the demographics and the ideological outline of an increasingly broad and radical Left, these developments entailed the potential to offer a left-wing response to public discontent with corporatism and with the political and social establishment (Black et al. 2013; Jobson 2015; Jones 1996; Medhurst 2014).\n\nBy the 1960s, along with a significant influx of blue-collars politicized by the new industrial struggles, a new ideal type of militant “young, educated, public-service professionals” (Richards 1997) was already reshaping the ideological and behavioural coordinates of Labour’s base bringing to the fore a participatory ethos less deferent to party and unions hierarchies and established procedures (Jenkins 1988; Seyd 1987). This led to a progressive shift to the left of most CLP’s and, as a reflex, of the NEC, which by the end of the 60 s started to act as an intra-party pressure group explicitly aiming at counterbalancing the influence of the parliamentary and governmental elite (Shaw 1988). A key role in the radicalisation of both CLPs and NEC was played by the perceived “betrayal” by the Wilson and Callaghan governments, which failed to fulfil the commitments expressed in the 1964 and 1976 election manifestos, demonstrating in the eyes of the base the unreliability of the parliamentary elites and the need to rein in their power (Seyd 1987). In addition to these developments within Labour, a broader political-cultural area was emerging, bridging the party base, especially at the local level, with new movements and cultural circles. Beyond injecting new issues and sensibilities within the broader Labour base (Brooke 2011), the new urban left engaged with the Labour Party at the local level, powering municipalist socialist experiments (Eley 2002) and experimenting in more flexible and innovative patterns of participation crossing the boundary between party and society (Boddy & Fudge 1984). Alongside the renowned case of Ken Livingston’s GLC, notable cases are those of Manchester (Wainwright 1987) and of the “Socialist republic of South Yorkshire” (Payling 2014). In these major urban areas, local authorities led by the Labour Left actively engaged with extra-parliamentary groups and creatively included them in policy making, with the explicit aim of creating a new constituency and renew the labour movement (Crowson et al. 2011). The extent of the effectiveness of this merger of countercultural libertarian intellectual and political activism and a renewed labour movement became apparent during the great miners’ strikes of the 1980s, when a urban coalition of feminist and gay liberation movements joined the Labour base in actively supporting the upheaval against Thatcher (Kelliher 2017, 2021).\n\nThese changes in collective identities, aspirations, and patterns of political participation deeply affected the development of the strategy of Labour’s New Left, under the political and intellectual leadership of Tony Benn. At the turn of the 1960s and ‘70 s, Benn started to formulate his theory of socio-political change which later would found practical translation in the intra-party struggles of the late 1970s and early 1980s (Adams 2011). The key causal connections within this strategy posed the reform of the Labour Party as the first step for the construction of a broad alliance with the emerging new generation of citizens and movements and the overcoming of the narrowly parliamentarist approach to politics which had been pursued by the Labour Party since its foundation. To grasp the intellectual roots of the New Left’s proposal of reform of the Labour Party, it is useful to start by focussing on Tony Benn’s essay published by the Fabian Society in 1970, in which the future leader of the New Left of the Labour Party summarized his analysis on the main trends of change in the development of political subjectivities and in the forms of participation. The analysis revolved around what Benn called the “new citizen”, the subject of the “new politics”:\n\nWe are dealing with a new form of citizen, nowadays, who is far more intelligent than most people in positions of authority yet accept that he is. (Benn 1970: p. 6)\n\nIn Benn’s view, the engine of change had been economic development: the improvement of living standards, linked to technological development and the Keynesian compromise, for the first time in history allowed common people to develop the ability for choice, both through the market and in cultivating their individual interests during leisure time. At the same time, the development of mass media and the diffusion of education, as well as the growing technical specialization in the division of social labour, meant that the stock of individuals with good cognitive resources increased rapidly. Thus, citizens became “more intelligent”, but also more open and cosmopolitan because of the greater range of stimuli to which they are subjected. The exit from material need towards a new phase marked by existential security and relative well-being opened up new possibilities for citizens, who started to become more and more demanding and self-affirmative. At the same time, the growing social complexity increased the integration of citizens within productive and social systems, making them the fundamental element in the chain of value production and consequently increasing their perception of being able to influence events. This increased sense of possibility would lead citizens to come together and express new demands that emerged from below, precisely because the New Citizen on the one hand was urged by the increase in social complexity to formulate new problems, while on the other finally reached the cognitive abilities and the confidence that enabled him to formulate those demands together with other peers without being dependent on political parties. He moved therefore from mobilisations based on collective loyalties to mobilisations based on specific “issues”.\n\nFaced with such developments, Benn believed that the type of socialism advocated by the Labour left had to evolve too. The goal remained the struggle for human dignity and against capitalism, but the way in which it was strategically conceived had necessarily to be adapted to the new times. The bureaucratic and hierarchical apparatuses developed to manage the welfare society—both state institutions and corporatist parties and unions—were increasingly perceived as clashing with the new values and preferences held by citizens, as they were unable to accommodate the demands for a multifaceted democratic participation:\n\nIt would be foolish to assume that people will be satisfied for much longer with a system that confines their national political role to the marking of a ballot paper with a single cross once every 5 years. People want a much greater say. That certainly explains some of the student protests against the authoritarian hierarchies in some of our universities and their sense of isolation from the problems of real life. Much of the industrial unrest—especially in unofficial strikes—stems from workers’ resentment and their sense of exclusion from the decision making process, whether by their employers or, sometimes, by their union leaders (Benn 2012b: p. 201)\n\nConsequently, the new socialists should promote the struggles for individuation and the protection of diversity, as well as the liberation from vertical apparatuses and the development of new forms of horizontal organization and power from below. Therefore, the Bennite New Left depicted a third way between.\n\n[…] the choice of bureaucratic state planning versus the market. […] a third option, based on democratic organisation and negotiation as themselves economic mechanisms. (Wainwright 1987: p. 25)\n\nAs extensively articulated in several later works (Benn 1980, 1982) and repeated in his diaries (Benn 2012a), Benn increasingly viewed socialism as the final realisation of a century-long process of democratisation to be finally realised through the implementation of new direct-participatory institutions, in every branch of civil society, the economy and the state. According to Benn’s theoretical elaboration the narrowly materialistic, “bread and butter”, conception of the aspirations of the working classes enshrined in the reformist and parliamentary repertoires of action pursued by both the party and union mainstream for more than seventy years had been rendered obsolete by economic development and social change. Socialist practice had therefore to be updated, adapting to the new postmaterialist and liberating impulses, reshaping its conception of the human and consequently the political agenda in a redistributive as well as libertarian-participatory key. Failing to do so would lead to the drowning out of social democracy by the rising tide of the anti-bureaucratic critique.\n\nIn order to channel the demands that came with the rise of the New Citizen, new forms of direct participation and bottom-up decision-making had to supplement the traditional mechanisms of parliamentary representation, bringing democracy into all branches of the state and arenas of social activity, ranging from domains as diverse as industrial management and the governance of public broadcasting (Benn 2012a). In fact, Benn proposed to temper the centrality granted by the Labour Party to parliament, complementing the intervention within state institutions through the support to the new issue-based demands formulated by self-organised citizens, seeking a new role for direct action within parliamentary democracy (Freeman 2014). From here derived the attention Benn and the New Left paid to extra-parliamentary struggles and movements, framed both as the key actors prefiguring the demands emerging spontaneously from New Citizens as well as the social forces that could prove decisive in the struggle for socialist democratisation. While Benn believed that the Labour Party could act as the vanguard of this new and final phase of democratisation, he contended that it could become a credible vehicle for the activism of the New Citizen only if it began a deep process of democratisation of its organisational structure:\n\n[…] it cannot present itself as the champion of democratic socialist development without paying some more attention to what this could mean for its own structure, nature and role. […] Only if we can learn how to do that to ourselves, can we really be confident of our ability to do the very same on a much larger, national, scale which will be certainly necessary, if any of our visions is to be realized by us, the people […]. (Benn 1970: p. 27)\n\nThe irreplaceability of the party as vanguard of the transformation lay in the need to guide and give a pragmatic translation to the demands of liberation that emerged in society. By embodying a model of radically democratic organization, Labour could become a pole of attraction, capable of inspiring the rest of society and directing the emerging and multifaceted forms of conflict towards the reform of the state and the capitalist system. But before launching this strategy, the Left needed to undermine the authoritarian rule of its parliamentary leadership, framed as the main obstacle to the democratisation of the party. One year after the publication of The New Citizen Benn outlined, during a lecture at the Fabian Society, the main domains of organisational reform to be addressed: the process for selecting Parliamentary candidates; who should elect the leader and deputy leader; and the accountability of cabinet members, MPs, local Labour groups, councillors, and trade-union delegations. All these reforms envisaged a significant redistribution of power within the party, from parliamentary and union elites to the direct participation of the organised base. Framed as the first steps within a broader strategy aimed at democratising the party to build the new democratic socialist alliance, these reforms.\n\n[…] challenged the view that the Parliament, and the state in Parliament, is the sole source of moral political authority. The reforms attempted to extend constitutional legitimacy to forms of political democracy outside Parliament as well (Wainwright 1987, p. 52)\n\nThese considerations, reinforced by the disillusionment generated by the Labour governments of the 1960s and ‘70 s (Seyd 1987), later formed the ideational core of the tactical approach of the intra-party organisation Campaign For Labour Party Democracy, the “armed wing” of New Left’s venture to change Labour’s structure. However, beyond the CLPD experience, we have seen that various bottom-up tendencies autonomously developed at the local level in the same period, aiming to challenge the usual logic of action and distribution of power within the party. The most advanced among these experiences is certainly that of the Greater London Council, led by the new leftist Ken Livingstone. Livingstone’s experimentations can be seen as a rulebook application of Benn’s strategy on the ground, through municipal socialist practices, as during his tenure he sought to develop an alliance between Labour activists, direct-action groups, ethnic minorities, and the new libertarian social movements (Kelliher 2017; Robinson et al. 2017). This entailed, on the one hand, a fiscal policy favourable to such groups, using property taxes to fund activist organizations; on the other, through the creation of thematic committees, Livingstone promoted the opening up of public administration, directly including citizens in the formulation of policies through the establishment of innovative institutions. More generally, Livingstone thought that\n\nThe Labour Party has to change its own structure so that women’s organizations, community organizations have a direct input rather than via the trade unions. Black political organizations should be affiliated to the Labour Party, as should various feminist groups. What we should aim for is to build a labour movement that represents not just the trades unions, but also these other sections of society which have been neglected by the labour movement in the past and whose demands have not been articulated. (Livingstone quoted in Boddy & Fudge 1984: p. 270)\n\nLivingstone’s policies aimed at lowering the boundaries between representative politics and civil society while building a new social alliance that extended beyond the traditional Labour Party constituencies, rested on strategic considerations that, as in Benn’s thought, looked with both concern and hope at the changing demographics of the British working classes. As Britain’s industrial base was contracting and the activism of women, students, ethnic minorities and LGBTQI + people started to rage on, this posed both a threat to traditional labourism and also an opportunity to broaden the socialist alliance. Labour’s response, according to both Benn and Livingstone, should have been to open up its organisational structure and innovate political practices beyond a narrow focus on winning and wielding parliamentary representation.\n\nMomentum and the movement party\n\nThe images of the New Citizen and the New Politics signalled the pivotal focus of Benn’s reform project, aimed at adapting the party form to the new times. In the same way, it is possible to identify a master concept characteristic of the Corbynist phase, namely the “movement party” or, more generically, the party-as-a-movement. The proposition of turning the party into a movement in particular is a recurring motif in the cultured debate concerning the Corbynist strategy and, in more detail, Momentum (Fitzgerald 2016; Garland 2017; Jones 2020; Skogan 2020).\n\nThe concept of the movement party is a key component of the discourse of two of the leading theorists affiliated with the movementist wing of Momentum, Hilary Wainwright and Keir Milburn. In the case of Wainwright, a former supporter and theorist of the extra-parliamentary New Left, the reflection on the movement party largely preceded her involvement in Momentum. The pivotal elements of this meditation, further developed during the Corbyn insurgency, have been set out in a 2008 article in the Red Pepper magazine.\n\nPerhaps we need to experiment with hybrid forms of ‘movement party’ organisation, especially in a context in which the nation state, the traditional focus of political parties, can only be one of many focuses of political struggle (Wainwright 2008).\n\nAccording to Wainwright, the gist of the movement party lies in its ability to operate simultaneously within state institutions—as a party -and within broader society—as a movement. The key notion here is the ability to leverage “non-state sources of power”, harnessed both to build a social base for radical claims and to radically transform the governmental logics adopted by the party.\n\nIn general terms one can say that the goal must move from winning the power to govern for the people paternalistically to being a struggle in collaboration with organised citizens to change political institutions from sources of domination to resources for transformation. (Wainwright 2008).\n\nThe movement party is supposed to mark the transition from a social democracy that has used the state to exercise “power as domination” towards a new model of polity capable of exercising “transformative” power, breaking down the radical separation between rulers and ruled that is constitutive of the parliamentary democracy.\n\nThe dualistic conception of the movement party is borrowed explicitly by Keir Milburn (2019), who, reflecting on the movements and parties emerged in response to the financial crisis and austerity policies, uses the concept of “dual strategy”. According to this conception of political strategy, parties act at the frontier between parliamentary politics and extra-parliamentary movements, in the belief that neither domain is sufficient, but both are necessary in determining the desired social change: on the one hand, pursuing direct action in society responds to the need to confront the dispersed and partly informal nature of power in increasingly complex societies. On the other hand, the state continues to be an actor which in such a dispersed society still holds important levers of economic policy and the almost complete monopoly on coercion through legislation and law enforcement. Movement parties therefore end up structuring themselves around a dual strategy, which aims at partly contradictory objectives: competing to win elections while promoting social change by extra-parliamentary means. Milburn identifies this dualistic conception of the party as a generational feature, part of a typically Millennial political worldview that stems from deep dissatisfaction towards both party and movement-based strategies.\n\nThis dualistic conception of party strategy, crossing the frontier between institutional politics and civil society, filtered in Corbyn supporters’ discourses about the movement’s strategy within Labour and more generally within British institutions and society. In such accounts, the Corbynist organisation Momentum is usually framed as the actor tasked with lobbying the Labour Party into the adoption of the dual strategy. Once again, Hilary Wainwright set the terms of the issue.\n\nWhile Momentum has stated its intent to ‘encourage those inspired by Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to get involved with the Labour Party’, it has also pledged to ‘build new and support existing organisations that can make concrete improvements to people’s lives’. In other words, and at least in theory, Momentum is an attempt to not only turn grassroots groups towards the Labour Party, but to turn the Labour Party to supporting these grassroots groups and helping new ones to emerge. (Wainwright 2015).\n\nTherefore, Momentum should have adopted the dual strategy both by supporting the electoral branch of the Corbynist insurgency—performing mainly campaigning tasks and defending the leadership from other factions—and by establishing extra-parliamentary direct-action networks, partnering with social movements.\n\nThe dichotomous pattern is recurrent in statements from Momentum leaders, even though different exponents have provided different specifications of the terms of the dualism. For example, in 2016, the founders of Momentum Adam Klugg, Emma Rees, and James Schneider published on Red Pepper an article of presentation of the new organization, defining its strategy through the dichotomy between a campaigning machine and the construction of a social movement active in local communities with informal repertories of action:\n\nThis membership growth offers Labour the opportunity to return to its radical heritage and become a social movement as well as a campaigning machine again—dual aims Momentum seeks to encourage. To build this movement, branches and constituency parties should be engaging more actively in communities, supporting grassroots organising and building networks for popular education. […] We also believe that electoral victory alone will not be sufficient to fundamentally transfer wealth and power to the overwhelming majority. We also need to build up a social base that can support a Labour government’s transformative changes. In particular, we need to build organisations of popular power (Klug et al. 2016).\n\nThere are not many differences between this conception and Wainwright’s, since the key issue is the fact that while state power is necessary to affect social change, it must be complemented by localized initiatives that empower citizens to self-organize in order to act directly to achieve some of the goals declared by the party and to defend them once obtained. However, again in 2016, founder James Schneider released another interview in which the dual strategy is formulated in different terms.\n\nIn terms of our aims, Momentum has a dual strategy. We want to make the Labour Party more open, participatory, and democratic. We want it to be an activist party, organising to win in every community, standing for Corbyn’s platform. We want to transform the party so that it can transform society. But we also want to provide a point of connection between the movements and the party, to use this moment to build popular power and increase capacity at the grassroots level. The Labour Party should be a giant lever for all popular struggles, raising them up and uniting them, providing them with a strategy to take power and win. To do that it we need a party strategy and a social strategy, in concert with each other. (Schneider 2016).\n\nHere the dichotomy is between objectives of party reform and promotion of social conflict. According to Schneider, it is necessary to promote an overall decentralization of the strategic perspective, contrary to the primacy attributed to the party by the New Left. In the New Left, the overcoming of parliamentarism envisaged nonetheless the party as playing a vanguard role vis-à-vis movements, by drawing amorphous social forces directly into parliamentary representation or by inventing new institutions. Benn’s pivotal problem was not primarily related to the enhancement of social movements, but rather to the adaptation of the party and the socialist project to the demands promoted by the New Citizen. Instead, the dualist strategic approach, when carried to its logical consequences, envisions a sort of “decentralization” of the party, which no longer represents the vanguard of the movement for socialism but one of two equally important forms of its expression. It is precisely in this conceptual knot that one can find the key distinction between the frames of the New Left and Momentum, as will be seen more in detail in the next section, a difference stemming from the different origins of the two insurgencies—the former, arising from within the party, the latter stemming from the alliance between the extra-parliamentary left and the Labour left.\n\nThis issue of the decentring from an essentially party-centric focus returned at a crucial stage in the recent history of the Labour left, in a statement of the Momentum NCG after the defeat in the general election of 2019:\n\nWith a change in leadership, our movement has the chance to shift our focus away from parliament alone and towards new horizons. We can build up political education in every part of the country. We can support trade unionists in their fight for better pay and conditions. We can strengthen direct-action groups challenging the government on the climate emergency. We can train and support a new generation of socialist leaders. We can form renters unions to build power and take on bad landlords. As many already are with Coronavirus, we can organise mutual aid to protect those most vulnerable to the worst impacts of Tory rule (Momentum 2020).\n\nIn the same document, the NCG analysed how Momentum had effectively focussed, until then, on electioneering and intra-party campaigning for constitutional reforms. As these activities were deemed insufficient, the leadership proposed to complement them with “new horizons” of action outside any strict reference to state institutions and party politics.\n\nIt must be noted, however, that even though Corbynists have thought and discussed a lot about building the extra-parliamentary branch of the party and many of them actually come from social movements, there is evidence that they have not been able to develop strong links between the party and movements (Bassett 2019a, b) and mould the former in the image of the latter, ending up “doing more and better what the CLPD used to do inside the party” (Panitch & Leys 2020: p. 232). This is mostly because, as we will see later on, the mounting of internal conflict between the parliamentary group and the leadership forced activists to make a choice between using their time and energies to defend the Corbyn project or trying to innovate organisational routines.\n\nConvergent theories of social change\n\nIn the previous pages we have seen that, despite some significant differences in emphasis, the Bennite New Left and the movementists of the 2010s show important signs of continuity in the formulation of political strategy, centred on the expansion of Labour politics towards social movements and away from the party’s narrow parliamentarism. While continuities in personnel may partly explain some of these convergences—think in particular of the role played by Hilary Wainwright, first as a semi-outsider observer of the grassroots New Left and then as a movementist activist and theorist—the fact that the two founding metaphors of the New Citizen and the Movement Party rest on the same “theoretical” interpretation of the links between social change and political participation is decisive.\n\nThe analytical assumptions lying behind the concept of the New Citizen have already been discussed extensively. The concept of the movement party, on the other hand, remains less clarified at present. As we have seen its developments in Wainwright and Milburn, now we need to step back and examine its early foundations. This is certainly a multifaceted concept, which has been used in different ways to identify mainly two characteristics of political parties: a close liaison with social movements (Della Porta et al. 2017) and/or an organisational model that is highly participatory and/or unstructured and reminiscent of movement practices (Kitschelt 2006). The invention of the term is due to Herbert Kitschelt, who has used the concept in an attempt to generalize some of the organisational characteristics observed in his studies on the emergence and evolution of “left-libertarian” parties, i.e. the Green parties of north-central Europe in the 1980s. In explaining the emergence of left-libertarian parties, the author explicitly refers to Ronald Inglehart’s theory of the Silent Revolution (Inglehart 1977). In Kitschelt’s interpretation.\n\nLeft-libertarian parties oppose the priority given to economic growth in public policy making, an overly bureaucratized welfare state, and restrictions placed on participation which confine policy making to the elites of well organized interest groups and parties. (Kitschelt 1989).\n\nAs it turns out, Kitschelt’s interpretation focuses not only on environmentalism and the critique of the paradigm of capitalist growth, but rather on a broader set of libertarian political and organisational preferences. According to Kitschelt, however, Green parties did not create such a conception but rather leveraged the emergence of new public values generated by the “structural” evolution of late industrial society. Specifically, drawing on Inglehart, Kitschelt argued that two social changes have radically impacted citizens’ participatory preferences from the 1960s onward. On the one hand, the increasing material security associated with economic development and the rise of the welfare state led citizens to diminish their emphasis on values such as deference to authority and conformism; according to Inglehart, the preponderance of such values in the past was the result of a socio-evolutionary response to the need to collectively address the challenges posed by the struggle for the material survival of individuals and the species. The weakening of materialistic values unleashed a set of higher degree needs and demands, related to the expression of each person’s individuality and signalling a heightened concern for the qualitative and immaterial components of life.\n\nSecond, these tendencies have been reinforced by what Inglehart refers to as “cognitive mobilisation”, pointing to the profound social impact of widespread access to education and mass media. According to Inglehart, participation in more complex information flows had made individuals more intellectually competent, leading to the emergence of more multifaceted personalities. As a consequence, these “new citizens” both placed more emphasis on individual needs and gained confidence in their capability to have an impact in society as individuals, even when apart from collective solidarities and organisations. The combined effect of the rise of postmaterialist values and cognitive mobilisation explained, according to Inglehart, the profound changes that have occurred in the forms of political participation since the 1960s, with the advent of a corrosive anti-authoritarian and anti-bureaucratic critique affecting the institutions of the welfare state, political parties, and labour unions.\n\nThe crux of Inglehart’s theory is to demonstrate, armed with massive quantitative data, how the emergence of such a critique, which sought to replace traditional forms of “collectivist” social organisation and political participation through the individualising, radically democratic and expressive practices experimented in libertarian movements, was not the offspring of political contingency but of deep social change—and thus would be an enduring presence in Western society. In this account, postmaterialist citizens, animated by libertarian leanings, have claimed for themselves increased autonomy and margins for direct action, outside the typical collective and representative constraints of postwar parties and trade unions. This in turn resulted in profound innovations in repertoires of action but also in a growing impatience with what has been perceived as the participatory narrowness of traditional forms of collective action. Kitschelt, echoing Inglehart, thus argued that the emergence of left-libertarian movement parties has been nothing more than the application to the party sphere of the anti-bureaucratic critique and the emerging postmaterialist and libertarian attitudes, resulting in new environmentalist and libertarian demands and in an expansion of the party’s sphere of action into extra-parliamentary domains, within a framework of radical democratisation of collective practices.\n\nThe examination of the origins of the concept of the movement party, closely related to the Theory of Silent Revolution, allows us to recognize a striking convergence between the analyses underlying the emergence of that concept and Benn’s elaboration on the New Citizen. Benn together with Inglehart reflected on the emergence of an anti-bureaucratic critique and of participatory values since the 1960s, looking at the implications for traditional forms of collective action. But it is not just this thematic focus: in fact, albeit in simplified terms, Benn anticipated several logical nexuses of Inglehart’s theory, hypothesizing a strong link between processes of economic and cultural development and the rise of libertarian and participatory values. Hence it emerges how the New Citizen concept and the Movement Party concept actually make reference to a common empirical background and contextualize it through a very similar logical framework, one that identifies in the rise of libertarian values both a challenge and a strong demand for the reform of the party form. This common interpretive substratum enables us to recognize the underlying conceptual convergence of the strategic formulations produced by the two waves of the Labour Left studied here.\n\nHaving explored the issue of strategic convergences between New Left and Momentum, in this section, I will turn to the tactical convergences between the two insurgencies. As we shall see, this is a particularly problematic issue as the 2010s movementists have sharply criticized the tactics pursued by New Left veterans. In the following pages, I will show how, despite their recalcitrancy, the logic of intra-party conflict and competition narrowed the strategic options open to the movementists.\n\nThe previous discussion showed that both insurgencies of the Left did not just aim at conquering the party, they wanted to change it. And they tried to change it not just to alter internal power relations, but to build a hybrid party movement alliance that would expand Labour politics beyond parliamentarism and renew British democracy beyond representative democracy. For the first time in the party’s history, Bennites openly challenged parliamentary socialism, and corbynist movementists followed suit, albeit from a different perspective. But they all did not go nearly as far as they had hoped.\n\nMomentum against the new left\n\nAs seen in the previous section, both Left insurgencies developed an ambitious strategic perspective, focussed on transforming the party and building a broad alliance with progressive social movements raging outside Labour. Both the New Left and the Momentum movementists converged on the objective of expanding Labour’s politics beyond parliamentarism. However, we have also seen that there have been some differences of perspective, that led the new movementists to stress less the role of the party as the vanguard of socialism. This is related to the different origins of the two insurgencies: while the Benn discourse originated within the ranks of the party as a response to social change, movementists elaborated their conceptions as members of extra-parliamentary social movements, which led to a decentering of the party in the movementist perspective.\n\nFrom 2015 on, Momentum developed as a sedimentary coalition between New Left veterans and new activists coming from the social movements of the 2010s (Avril & Beliard 2018; Pickard 2019); this partition reflected in the composition of Momentum’s leadership, where founder Jon Lansman had been joined by an executive team composed movementist activists. The encounter of these two streams of the Labour Left soon started to create some tensions regarding the tactics of the Corbyn movement. On the one hand, the veterans of the New Left had strong ties with the unions and were much more prone to reasoning in terms of intra-party conflict and strategy, following the experience of the CLPD.\n\nSeveral older activists speak with the certainty and precision of experienced stalwarts back on home territory: now that we’ve won the leadership, they insisted, it’s a matter of changing the party—resolutions to conference, replacing right-wing MPs, and so on. The familiar formula was expressed with great confidence that it would produce the desired left turn in the party, ready for government. (Wainwright 2016).\n\nOn the contrary, the new movementist activists were more focussed on the alliance with social movements and on the attempt to contaminate the party with the cultures and organisational logics experienced in these, adding feminist, anarchist and prefigurative interpretations to the repertoire of the Labour left (Bassett 2016; Schneider 2016). These differences have repeatedly caused attrition within the movement.\n\nThey thought he [Jon Lansman] was obsessed with structure, he thought they were lacking in any sort of organisational ideas. Lansman was the product of the left’s history, its hierarchies, of CLPD, of running slates and party organisation. He had kept the left alive over thirty-five years. They were born of the new movement from outside the structures of the party. These two strands became one within Momentum and Emma Rees became its first national coordinator, but in those early months everyone was fighting for their vision, as Lansman admitted: “They wanted a complete open-door policy. They wanted it to be a totally horizontal organisation, totally anarchic. […]” (Kogan & Kogan 2018, p. 251).\n\nIn addition to these differences in method, several activists and intellectuals from Momentum ranks have recognized a full-blown identity divide between the movementists and New Left veterans. This rift is reflected in the use of the label “labourist” to identify veterans (Bassett 2016; Schneider 2016), invariably portrayed as extremely inward-looking and focussed on procedures and organisational cohesion. Crucially, “labourist” is not a neutral term identifying the affiliation with the party, but rather the ideology of integral acceptance of representative politics and traditional, bureaucratic, and hierarchical party organization as the only possible frameworks for collective action (Judge 1999). It is an expression that has been widely used by the Left to criticize the organisational ideology of the party mainstream. Even the New Left of the 1970–80s used the term negatively, to criticize the party’s organisational tradition (Wainwright 1987).\n\nHow is it possible that New Left veterans, who long fought against the traditional parliamentarist orientation of the Labour Party, could be dismissed by new activists as mere “labourists”? This apparent contradiction is a product of how the new movementists perceived the tactical options adopted by Benn and the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy (CLPD). Benn’s analysis theorised the need to reform the party by identifying a set of risks and opportunities arising from powerful patterns of socio-structural change. On the one hand, by embracing the New Citizens’ demand for more direct control and becoming more democratic and accountable to its base, the party could be seen as the credible vehicle of social and value transition. On the other hand, by democratising its structures, Labour could undermine the powers of the parliamentary leadership and erase the barriers preventing outsiders from influencing party decision-making.\n\nThis reasoning led to the establishment of a strategy based on a clear ordering of priorities: first, reform the party through the setting up of the CLPD; then, forge an alliance with extra-parliamentary movements. The aim of the reforms advocated by the CLPD was to overthrow the key feature of parliamentarism—namely, the separation of the masses from the works of parliament—by giving more powers to individual members and the party on the ground (Seyd 1987). The key pillars of the CLPD’s action lay in constructing an alliance with the trade unions and organising the party base, both oriented to the left but unable to advance their demands jointly. The activists of the CLPD tried to compensate for this disorganisation by conducting extensive campaigning and recruitment throughout the years and dramatizing programmatic debates during national conferences (Massey 2020).\n\nThese tactics were overall successful, as the broad support obtained among the party base and trade unions allowed the CLPD to achieve mandatory reselection of all standing MPs in 1979 after 6 years of campaigning on the issue. However, the New Left failed to transfer control of the electoral manifesto from the Parliamentary Party to the party executive, although it managed to impose the most radical manifesto since the postwar period in the run-up to the 1983 elections. Additionally, the CLPD secured a change in the rules for the election of the secretary, removing the parliamentary party’s monopoly on the choice of leader. After the reform, the leadership would be elected according to a mechanism giving 30% of the votes to members as well as parliamentarians and 40% to the unions.\n\nLabour’s New Left’s broader strategy was thus actualized as a tactic focussed on fighting through party structures by means of conferences, motions, and internal selections. This approach, although proving capable of achieving important results, ended up sucking up all the energies of the New Left, de facto preventing it from concentrating on building a broad alliance with social movements and experimenting with new forms of involvement (Wainwright 1987; Seyd 1987), which took momentum only at the local level (Payling 2014) and thus failed to systematize on a national basis. This is for two main reasons. The first is certainly related to the fact that the attempt to change the party by undermining the power of the parliamentary leadership generated a very harsh internal opposition, which slowed down the advance of the Left and finally produced a split in the party in 1981 (Massey 2020). Second, while Benn articulated a broader discourse and was recognized as a leader of the New Left well beyond the party, the CLPD did not have strong ties outside the party, as it was composed of activists who were experts in party organizing and machinations but who found Labour to be their ultimate horizon of political action (Seyd 1987). Thus in the end, the Bennite Left, “in concentrating on trying to change the Labour Party, became entrapped in that struggle” (Panitch Leys 1997: p. 264).\n\nOnce New Leftists flocked to Momentum, they re-proposed such a tactical approach, even though it had already proved detrimental to the widening of Labour Left’s base beyond the party. The fulcrum of the movementist critique of the New Left lies exactly in the appreciation of the fact that too much emphasis on tacticisms within the party would go at the expense of wider movement building. It is important to note that these critiques were not entirely new, as already in the eighties leading left-wing intellectuals criticized the Bennite left for its’ excessive adhesion to Labour Party “constitutionalism” (Rustin 1980), “clinging to the old formulae” (Blackwell & Seabrook 1985) of Labour organizing. Historian Geoff Eley later went further on this line, arguing that if there was ever a New Left in the Labour Party, at the beginning of the eighties it was almost exclusively in municipalist experiments (Eley 2002). These considerations point to a disconnect between innovative but dispersed local experiences and the Bennites’ national strategy. Even CLPD founder and leading activist Vladimir Deerer admitted in 1984 that the Left’s efforts had been somehow too narrowly focussed on intra-party scheming (Harris 1984), and that this might have had feedbacks on the enhancement of resistance on the part of the Labour right.\n\nCLPD 2.0?\n\nThus, we have seen that the most innovative components of Momentum articulated a severe critique of the New Left methods. Yet despite these differences, the Momentum Left has taken up most of the key tenets of the CLPD tactics. While Momentum has been far more vocal, compared to its “predecessor”, in communicating its will to pursue the extra-parliamentary expansion of the Labour Party’s sphere of activity, it has in fact ended up, just like the New Left, persevering with a collective practice integrally focussed on intra-party conflicts and scheming. How did this happen?\n\nHaving gained power through the combination of an insurgency of the base and the support of part of the trade unions, the Corbyn leadership tried to cement its grip on the party on these two pillars, exactly as the CLPD had tried. As became clear in 2016, the affirmation of the Left demanded a harsh fight against the parliamentary group. In the face of repeated attacks by the parliamentary group, culminating in the triggering of a new leadership contest after mass resignations from the Shadow Cabinet in summer 2016, Corbyn had to show how the source of his power and legitimacy within the party stemmed from outside the parliament, residing in the great popular support conveyed by the movement that was formed around the remnants of the CLPD and Momentum. At this point the Left, adamantine with respect to the need to decrease the power of the PLP in favour of members, took again the road of constitutional reforms. This was an existential issue for the Left, that sought a way to maintain power and get some chances to retain it even after the eventual end of Corbyn’s leadership. All this would be impossible without a downsizing of the power of the largely hostile Parliamentary Group or a change in its composition. On the other hand, there have also been considerations of an ideological nature, in which is clearly present the legacy of the New Left. In this sense, the pivotal idea has been to encourage the democratisation of the party, in the belief that this could ensure the construction of an alliance with libertarian and radical social movements, attracted by the chance of affecting parliamentary politics guaranteed by the reduction of barriers to bottom-up decision-making:\n\nAnd initially, it did seem like the election of Corbyn was proof of the correctness of Benn’s adage. The democratisation of Labour and the democratisation of society was a singular project with two distinct but continuous moments. Corbynism could, the hope was, give voice to the new social movements and a new multi-ethnic and urban working class that had arisen in Britain’s sprawling metropolitan centres (Oduor 2020).\n\nThis approach appeared to be confirmed by the construction, within Momentum, of an alliance between movementists and old party activists. However, the success of the efforts at defending the leadership from internal adversaries came at a cost. In order to effectively counter the efforts to unseat Corbyn—culminating in the 2016 “coup” organised by the Shadow Cabinet, followed by a second leadership election—most of the new movementists resolved to take seriously internal struggles and to set aside the exclusive focus on movementisation.\n\nI think the second leadership election actually solved most of the older problems. Most of the early problems were about the dilemma, how important was the internal battle, how important was the external? The coup made it completely clear how important the internal battle was and it totally turned everyone to understanding that we’d got to defend Jeremy. Everybody understood that. And I think once we had won that second battle, everybody understood that now we’d got to win a general election. (Ghadiali 2018).\n\nInternal conflict, therefore, narrowed the strategic options open to the Corbynists. If this on the one hand resolved, at least temporarily, the rifts between movementists and veterans, on the other, it inserted an element of potential frustration, ready to explode and to lead many activists to disengagement in the eventuality of a slowdown of the ascent of the left.\n\nSuch were the circumstances that presided over the difficult birth of left renewal from a deeply neoliberal Labour Party, a dilemma largely dictated by the conditions of Britain’s first past the post electoral system. Movementist activists entering Labour with radical political consciousness are being shaped into a new cadre of Labour party door-knockers, focused on Party manoeuvring, electioneering and at best community engagement deploying methods drawn more from Obama and Sanders’ campaigns than from the organic ruptures of Greece and Spain. Stripped of strategies for social change which foreground social mobilisation, the post-movementists in Labour now have at their disposal merely tactical innovations (networked and “crowd-sourced” forms of organising) constrained within the reformist boundaries implied by Labour’s long history of Fabianism. (Bassett 2016).\n\nAnd indeed, as soon as Corbyn’s leadership came to an end, the issue of Momentum’s more or less movementist nature resurfaced vehemently. We have already seen the declaration of the National Executive following the 2019 defeat, which called out the need to broaden the focus of the organization beyond the mere party and parliamentary dimensions. In addition, the 2020 elections for Momentum’s executive have been marked by the triumph of a faction deeply committed to the movementist rhetoric and aggressively critical of Lansman and of the choice to transform Momentum into a pressure group along the tactical lines already covered by the CLPD (Forward Momentum 2020).\n\nOnce again, as in the New Left, the democratisation of the party had been viewed at the same time as a tool to allow the Left to take and maintain power and as a first step in a project of democratisation of society, while the construction of the extra-parliamentary alliance ended up to be postponed sine die. However, although for the first time the Left seized power within the party, paradoxically this time the results have been even narrower than in the 80s, mainly because of the timidity of the party leadership. The only substantive reform promoted by Corbyn regarded the lowering the number of MPs required for a new secretary’s candidacy. As a result of the conflict between the leadership and the Shadow Cabinet, this threshold has been dropped from 15 to 10 percent. Decisive in this context, in addition to the staggering physical and digital mobilisation efforts promoted by Momentum (Jones 2020), was the decision of the unions to deliberate within the party executive for the automatic inclusion of Corbyn in the list of candidates in the contest following the 2016 vote of no confidence, and subsequently for a reform that lowered the threshold required for nominations. Alongside this measure, the leadership managed to obtain an increase in the number of delegates from constituencies in the composition of the national executive. The fate of another and more decisive reform project, namely the reintroduction of mandatory reselection, has been radically different. This reform, already a warhorse of the Left in the 1980s, would have given members of party branches the right to choose, before each general election, their own MP candidate. For this reason, such a reform would put the parliamentary group at risk of seeing its autonomy undermined by the direct influence of members and would strongly incentivize centrism of the organized extra-party left at the local level. However, the introduction of mandatory reselection was never openly supported by the party leadership, which, aware of the aversion of the unions,Footnote 1 did not want to risk a clash with such crucial allies. Rather, in this context, it was Momentum that pushed strongly in favour of the reform. The result has been a latent conflict that threatened to deflagrate before the 2018 party conference, pitting Momentum and Young Labour on one side against the main unions, Unison and Unite (Ward 2022). To avoid potential public conflict during the conference, the leadership and unions worked out a compromise solution during a session of the party executive, which stipulated that a deselection process could be initiated whenever 33 percent of a constituency party’s membership requested it—the previous threshold was 50 percent. The reform passed, but left Momentum’s leadership deeply disgruntled. In fact, the impact of the changes has been nil: no MPs have been deselected through the new regime.\n\nIt appears from what has been discussed so far that the formal structure of the party and the patterns of intra-organisational conflict have been extremely effective in producing mechanisms that made it difficult, if not impossible, to launch a deep and extensive reform path following an impulse stemming from the organized grassroots. Indeed, to do so would require engaging in conflict against the organisational components opposing change, but in both insurgencies, such conflict over rules and constitutional reforms completely absorbed the energies of left-wing activists. This is even more evident as these tendencies ended not only to constrain the actions of activists, but even shaped their organisational culture. The movementists of the 2010s did not recognize the libertarian afflatuses of the CLPD veterans, and this is because, as we have seen, the party Left of the 1980s de facto renounced party movementisation in favour of full adherence to a project of internal conflict and reform. Ironically, Momentum’s leadership was dismissed in 2020 by a new movementist faction that leveraged the same criticisms that the movementist leaders levelled in 2015–2016 at Lansman and the former CLPD activists.\n\nFor two times, Labour’s “iron triangle” ended up suffocating the attempts to remake the party form and to locate the party at the forefront of a broad and hybrid social-parliamentary coalition. Despite being more than 30 years apart, the two insurgencies of the Left faced the same intra-party opportunity structure: on the one hand, they could leverage massive support from the base and solidarity by a wide array of movement activists located at the frontier between party and civil society, active in particular at the local level. Against them, the party bureaucracy and the parliamentary elite, whose hostility turned the rise of the left into an exhausting war of position within the party. As third stood the major unions, capable at any moment of tipping the balance: in both insurgencies, they played a major role in supporting the Left (Nunns 2018), but also imposed significant limitations to Momentum-backed reforms. Even worse in the Eighties, the withdrawal of union support was decisive in the final defeat of the Bennite project (Massey 2020)."
