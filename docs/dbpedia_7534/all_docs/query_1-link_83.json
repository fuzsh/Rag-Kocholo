        "text": "Here is a look at the life of former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and a former presidential candidate.\n\nPersonal\n\nBirth date: September 18, 1951\n\nBirth place: Detroit, Michigan\n\nBirth name: Benjamin Solomon Carson\n\nFather: Robert Carson, auto factory worker\n\nMother: Sonya (Copeland) Carson, domestic worker\n\nMarriage: Lacena “Candy” (Rustin) Carson (July 1975-present)\n\nChildren: Murray, Benjamin Jr and Rhoeyce\n\nEducation: Yale University, B.A. in Psychology, 1973; University of Michigan School of Medicine, M.D., 1977\n\nReligion: Seventh Day Adventist\n\nOther Facts\n\nWhen Carson became the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins at age 33, he was the youngest person to head a major division in the hospital’s history.\n\nHis parents separated when he was 8, after it was revealed his father was a bigamist. He and his brother were raised by their mother.\n\nCarson admits that he had a violent temper in his youth, and says one of the defining moments of his life occurred when he was 14. Carson attempted to stab a schoolmate, but luckily the boy’s belt buckle blocked the knife. After praying for three hours, Carson “came to an understanding that to lash out at people is not a sign of strength, it was a sign of weakness.”\n\nKnown for offering provocative commentary on a wide range of issues, including comparing the modern American government to Nazi Germany in a March 2014 interview with Breitbart, and at the 2013 Values Voters Summit, saying that Obamacare is “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.”\n\nTimeline\n\n1977-1978 - Intern in general surgery at The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\n1978-1982 - Completes his neurosurgery residency at Johns Hopkins.\n\n1982-1983 - Chief neurosurgery resident at Johns Hopkins.\n\n1983-1984 - Senior registrar in neurosurgery at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth, Australia.\n\n1984-2013 - Director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center.\n\n1987 - Primary neurosurgeon on team that performs the first successful surgery to separate conjoined twins connected at the back of the head (occipital craniopagus twins).\n\n1990 - Carson’s best-selling autobiography, “Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story,” is published.\n\n1994 - Founds the Carson Scholars Fund with his wife, which facilitates leisure reading for children and funds college scholarships for students with strong academics and humanitarian achievement.\n\n1997 - Primary neurosurgeon on the team that performs the first fully successful surgery to separate Type 2 vertical craniopagus twins (joined at the top of the head and facing opposite directions), where both twins survive and are neurologically normal.\n\n2002 - Co-founds the Benevolent Endowment Network (BEN) Fund, which provides financial support for the medical expenses of pediatric neurosurgery patients.\n\nAugust 2002 - Undergoes surgery for prostate cancer.
