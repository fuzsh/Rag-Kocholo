        "text": "Jess Barnard\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1204334\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI joined Labour at age 17 because I saw the damage a Tory government was inflicting on working class communities like mine and the desperate need for a socialist alternative. That’s why I’ve always worked tirelessly to tackle injustice, poverty and discrimination, whether as a Workplace Rep, Councillor, Parliamentary Candidate or Youth Worker.\n\nWe need a Labour government which tackles inequality head on, with a bold manifesto committed to funding and renationalising public services, addressing the housing emergency, delivering climate justice and putting human rights at the heart of international policy.\n\nMy record:\n\n– A trade unionist and striking worker, supporting a new deal for working people and reversing Tory anti-union legislation.\n\n– Supporting member democracy and transparency, opposed selection stitch-ups and equalities conference shutdowns on the NEC and NPF.\n\n– Providing regular in person and digital report backs, always accountable to our membership.\n\n– An outspoken voice for justice, transformative policies and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n– Standing for LGBTQ+ rights, disability justice and challenging the party to implement the Forde report, to tackle all forms of racism without delay.\n\nI’m proud to be supported by the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance and Momentum. Please Also support G.Bolton, Y.Dar and M.Rahman.\n\nCalvin Bissitt\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1740666\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nLabour is on the cusp of forming the next Government. We are so close, and yet still remain plagued by the same issues we faced five to ten years ago.\n\nMembers are unable to renew or update information. Calling in to report an issue or flag problems is impossible, and we have clear, evident issues with our selection timetables and processes. We need a serious change, not just a change in which faction sits in the NEC, but a meaningful change in how we run the party.\n\nWe have briefings being run against elected Labour officials, communication issues between our ruling body and members, and now we have a real need to settle on a plan and processes for the party’s inner workings.\n\nWe need a fresh pair of eyes, and real change starting from the NEC.\n\nI will work to ensure smooth systems, to make sure that our members can renew with ease, and that no one who puts themselves forward as a candidate finds out from twitter. I’ve spent the best part of my last year doing that with our Trades Council, and I want to ensure that the Labour Party is ready for government.\n\nAnn Black\n\nMembership Number\n\nA353890\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m asking you to nominate me for a further two years on the NEC as a principled, independent and accountable voice for members. I served from 2000 to 2018 and from 2020, and after ten years in government and twelve in opposition I know that government is always better. The first priority is the general election, and those who put faction before country will not be forgiven by those who most need Labour to succeed. The leader has chosen his team and his strategy, and any differences must be settled privately. Unity is paramount.\n\nIf we win, Labour will have to rebuild after 14 years of austerity and chaos, against the grim background of war in Ukraine and the Middle East. I support the national policy forum’s ambitious programme, including employment rights, building homes and protecting tenants, reducing child poverty, saving the NHS and tackling climate change.\n\nI have consistently argued for fairer allocation of membership subscriptions, improved IT systems, better communication with volunteers, an empowering women’s organisation and integrity in selections, complaints and disciplinary processes, and will return to these after the election. Please check my record at www.annblack.co.uk, mail me at [email protected], and trust me with your vote.\n\nEmail: [email protected], Website: www.annblack.co.uk, X: @AnnBlackLabour\n\nGemma Bolton\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1405940\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m standing for a third term on Labour’s NEC because I believe that we need a transformational Labour government and democratic party where members are respected and valued at every level.\n\nAt the general election, Labour must propose transformative, bold and popular policies that stand in opposition to the Tories. We must oppose austerity during an unprecedented cost of living crisis; repeal Tory anti-trade union legislation; support public ownership; campaign for a radical Green Prosperity Plan; fight rising poverty and racism and adopt a peace-oriented, independent foreign policy – which includes calling for an immediate, permanent ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nDuring over five years on the NEC, I’ve seen that we’re strongest as a party when members feel empowered and engaged. That’s why local parties should always select their parliamentary candidate.\n\nIn addition to serving two terms on Labour’s NEC, I’ve also been a parliamentary candidate; served on the Women’s Conference Arrangements Committee; as CLP Equalities and Youth Officer; as Co-Chair of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy (CLPD) and on the South East Regional Executive Committee since aged 18.\n\nI’m proudly endorsed by the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance, including Momentum and CLPD. Please also vote: Jess Barnard, Yasmine Dar and Mish Rahman.\n\nYasmine Dar\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1173052\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m standing for re-election to the NEC, to continue as a strong voice advocating for members, the lifeblood of our Party.\n\nThroughout my tenure, I’ve championed transformative economic policies and a foreign policy rooted in internationalism, seeking peace, justice, and human rights.\n\nI actively promote Party democracy, including dynamic, inclusive equalities structures, implementation of the Forde report and a strong trade union link. I’ve tirelessly advocated for transparent and fair disciplinary processes founded on natural justice.\n\nEmpowering members is a focal point of my efforts, including advocating for their right to select preferred candidates. As a BAME woman, social worker, anti-racist activist, and Councillor, my experiences fuel my determination to fight for a Labour government that transforms society. A crucial general election is on the horizon, and victory is imperative.\n\nIn the face of escalating living costs, heightened inequalities, and the ongoing impacts of Covid, our campaign against this government must intensify. I endorse vital campaigns to defend our NHS, for urgent action on climate change. I maintain a strong commitment to anti-war and anti-racist activism.\n\nPlease also nominate Jess Barnard, Gemma Bolton and Mish Rahman. Together, we can build a more just and equitable future for our nation.\n\nAdam Davies\n\nMembership Number\n\nA747430\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI was born and raised in South Wales in the 80’s and experienced the worst of the Tories first hand. I saw the effect of their policies on our communities, our industries and our people, and this drives me to do everything I can to fight them, and to build a better, fairer society for all of us.\n\nI moved to London and now live in Surrey. I’ve been active in my local Party for 12 years, and Secretary for the last six.\n\nI’ve learnt how we can win. My MP is Jeremy Hunt, but even here I’ve helped get Labour elected, and to kick the Tories out.\n\nWe need Labour representation everywhere, only we can be the voice our workers and our communities need.\n\nI want to help CLPs win more seats at all levels. I’ve been part of doing it in Surrey, and if we can do it here, it can be done anywhere\n\nWe’re going to win the next election, lets use that as our springboard to strong Labour voices in your communities, and help me be your voice on the NEC.\n\nPlease support Ann Black and Nick Palmer as well, to champion constructive non-factional Labour ideals.\n\nAngie Davies\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1191960\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI believe passionately in our party values – equality, community, tolerance, solidarity and a socially just society. I want to continue putting my Labour values into action and serve people in our communities as well as our party.\n\nFor the last 30 years, I am proud to have worked in the substance misuse and mental health field in our precious NHS. I am passionate about tackling inequality in all its forms.\n\nAs a councillor on Wirral Borough Council and as Deputy Leader of the Labour Group, I understand the challenges our communities and public services face. I really enjoy being a community champion, avid campaigner and activist, and have the experience, energy, knowledge and skills that are required to serve on the National Executive Committee.\n\nI am on the North West Regional Executive Committee, as well as CLP Treasurer, and Campaign Coordinator for our Borough Campaign Group. I also serve as a school governor, and as a board member for our local Youth Zone and a men’s mental health charity.\n\nI am a member of Managers in Partnership (part of UNISON) and Christians on the Left.\n\nPlease also nominate Akehurst, Baxter, Duale, Prashar, Singh Josan, Thomas & Wimbury.\n\nAbdi Duale\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1396053\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nIn 2022, I became the first black man elected to our NEC, and since then I have put the voices of CLPs and members at the forefront of the NEC. As well as focusing all of our efforts to unite our party to win the General Election and elect Keir Starmer as our next Prime Minister.\n\nThis year, our country is at a crossroads, with the possibility of a Labour Government the nearest it’s been in 14 years. We have made significant progress to change our party, so we can, in turn, win power and change our country. Now is not the time to undo that work and that’s why I am seeking your support to re-elect me to our party’s National Executive Committee.\n\nAs a former organiser in battleground seats, I have a track record of running successful campaigns. During my time on the NEC, I have used my experience to ensure no stone remains unturned in the pursuit of winning the General Election.\n\nI am a member of the Fabian Society, Co-op Party, and a member of GMB Union’s London Regional Committee.\n\nSupported by Labour To Win. Please also support Akehurst, Baxter, Davies, Josan, Prashar, Thomas and Wimbury.\n\nAmanat Gul\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1197018\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nMy name is Amanat Gul and humbly extend my request for your valued support in upcoming NEC membership election 2024. I am standing to be your candidate for the Labour NEC, I like to raise an effective voice for the ordinary members who want Labour in power.\n\nDavid Littlefair\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1162157\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nDear Members,\n\nI want to make Labour:\n\n– More working class\n\n– Less concentrated in cities\n\n– An institution that is in touch with Leave voters\n\nThanks for considering me again as an independent, non-slate affiliated candidate for the NEC.\n\nIn 2019 I set up Labour Beyond Cities – trying to address Labour’s bias toward liberal metropolitan professionals by moving resources to our red wall swing seats.\n\nIn 2023 I started a campaign in Labour to ensure Labour picks working class and blue collar workers to be MPs. Currently only 8 of our PPC selections come from a background in blue collar work. We are becoming the ‘On-behalf of Labour party’, and I think that’s wrong.\n\nYou can see the 2023 Conference panel I ran, ‘Breaking Labour’s Class Ceiling’ here:\n\nIf you’d like a non-factional NEC member who:\n\n* Will work to ensure Labour is a place where working class people can become MPs\n\n* Who thinks regional inequality is the biggest indicator of life outcomes in the country\n\n* Thinks Labour needs to be a party of big utilitarian change rather than niche identity politics issues\n\n* Sticks up for towns and coastal regions and the people who live in them- give me your vote!\n\nJoin my mailout here: www.labourbeyondcities.co.uk\n\nArgue with me on twitter here: www.twitter.com/labbeyondcities\n\nJacob Olaniya\n\nMembership Number\n\nL3092175\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am pleased for this opportunity that has been given to me to apply and represent our team Labour Party. However, this would give me the better ability and chances to provides the excellent services for the people of our communities of our Great Britain. I would have a great opportunities to provide helps and support our members and leaders of our team. This would be a better position to help our Labour Party to win and secure the no10.\n\nNick Palmer\n\nMembership Number\n\nA009765\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’ve been a Party member all my adult life, and served as MP for Broxtowe (Notts) from 1997-2010, the only Labour MP the constituency has ever had. I was CLP chair in SW Surrey and am currently chair of Didcot and Wantage CLP, where we are also working to elect the first Labour MP. I don’t believe in factionalism and have served each Labour leadership loyally, while reserving the right to speak out on individual policies.\n\nWe need reasonable, fully-funded policies to win power. We must also take the opportunity of power to achieve lasting improvements to our society and the world around us. We need a clear sense of direction, with priority given to:\n\n* reducing NHS waiting lists\n\n* funding our schools adequately\n\n* facilitating genuinely affordable housing\n\n* addressing poverty: food banks should not be needed in today’s Britain.\n\n* returning to the 0.7% target for international aid by the end of the next Parliament.\n\nI grew up in Denmark, where decades of social democracy have led to a healthy, thriving society. I want to help achieve the same in our country.\n\nPlease support Ann Black and Adam Davies as well, to champion constructive non-factional Labour ideals.\n\nNeeraj Patil\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0054413\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI support proportional representation and fair Parliamentary selections. I don’t represent any of the “blocs,” I’m proud to call myself an independent grassroots Labour activist who believes in empowering our CLPs and membership.\n\nI am an active member and campaigner of the Labour Party for 20 years. I have served as Lambeth Councillor for eight years and was Mayor of Lambeth from 2010 to 2011. As a Parliamentary candidate in 2017, I reduced the Conservative majority from 10180 to 1554, achieving a 10.8 % swing.\n\nI believe in zero tolerance towards Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, anti-Hinduism, and racial discrimination.\n\nI’m an A&E doctor who served the NHS for 30 years. I have worked on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Please support me in contributing my political and medical experience to get our NHS back on its feet.\n\nI’m standing for the NEC because I want a united Labour Party to win the next General elections, address the cost-of-living crisis, create green jobs, rebuild our economy, revive our NHS, and invest in our schools and local government to empower our communities.\n\nI recommend nominating independent grassroots Labour Party members to the NEC.\n\nDR. Neeraj Patil\n\nConsultant in A&E\n\nFormer Mayor of Lambeth\n\nAnu Prashar\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1207708\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m Anu Prashar, equality campaigner, trade unionist and hardworking Labour activist. We’ve changed our party and I will make sure that change continues.\n\nBut our mission isn’t just about winning elections, it’s about reshaping our country for the better. I’ll keep our focus razor-sharp on creating green jobs and rebuilding public services.\n\nGrowing up on a council estate in an immigrant family, my dad, a ‘postie’ and my mum, a factory worker, I saw how Labour in power can transform lives.\n\nAs CLP Chair and LCF Secretary, I’m committed to providing the right local support so every member can contribute to our mission.\n\nFrom day one in my first job I joined the union, and I’ve fought tooth and nail for workers rights as a vocal activist in UNISON. I will protect the trade union link, the backbone of our movement.\n\nI’m BAME officer of LGBT+ Labour and Chair of UNISON’s regional LGBT+ committee. As an Asian lesbian I’ve spent my life battling for equality and I will bring the same determination to rooting out discrimination in our party and creating opportunity for all.\n\nPlease also consider voting for Akehurst, Baxter, Davies, Duale, Singh Josan, Thomas and Wimbury.\n\nMish Rahman\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0137964\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nAs a working-class man of Bangladeshi heritage, whose father campaigned against the National Front, I am a committed anti-racist bringing my commitments to equality and justice onto the NEC since I was first elected in 2020. I have:\n\nOpposed the selection stitch-ups and crackdowns on democracy and due process that have become common in our Party\n\nPressured the leadership to fully implement the Forde Report\n\nOpposed all discrimination including Islamophobia, anti-semitism, homophobia, sexism, and transphobia without fear or favour.\n\nSpoken out against the indiscriminate killing of innocents in the Israel-Palestine conflict and founded the Labour For a Ceasefire Now campaign.\n\nRegularly reported back via online calls, articles and social media\n\nWorked collaboratively to introduce new equalities structures, including a BAME Members’ Structure which the leadership ditched.\n\nWith a General Election looming, I will work to deliver an election-winning Party which will change the lives of millions for the better.\n\nThat means supporting popular policies like a Green New Deal, public ownership, repealing anti-trade union laws, advancing migrants’ rights, defending human rights across the world and internationalist solidarity.\n\nI am proud to be supported by the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance and Momentum. Please also support Jess Barnard, Gemma Bolton, and Yasmine Dar.\n\nOnkar Sahota\n\nMembership Number\n\nB035541\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nBeing child of an immigrant family, I passionately believe in aspirational politics, where every generation does better than their parents. I’ve benefited from and believe in Labour values, that’s why I joined the Labour Party even before I joined the medical school.\n\nI have always fought against injustices, inequalities, discrimination and lack of equality in opportunity. My experience includes:\n\nâ— 35 years as NHS GP\n\nâ— Labour London Assembly Member (2012-2024)\n\nâ— 9 Years as Chair of Assembly Health Committee and former Assembly Chair\n\nâ— Member GMB, Unite and Co-operative Party\n\nâ— Former CLP Chair, Local Magistrate and School Governor\n\nThrough my NHS experience and political background, I offer a unique perspective to serve our party and future Labour Government which will have to rebuild the NHS.\n\nI will campaign to get a Labour Government elected and through the work of the NEC ensure that it delivers the change the country needs.\n\nThe NEC should ensure our Leadership is in touch with the aspirations of the members, that party governance meets the highest standards and holds itself to scrutiny. I champion unity and will give voice to grassroot members and CLPs who are the backbone of the Labour Party.\n\nKaz Self\n\nMembership Number\n\nA005911\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI joined the Labour Party in 1988 at the peak of Thatcherism, when attacks on worker’s rights and civil liberties were commonplace. I never thought I would see a worse Tory Government, but here we are in 2024 and the right-wing extremists are in charge. The folly of Tory Party politics is now laid bare before us, with a dentistry crisis, a housing crisis, a cost-of-living crisis and NHS waiting lists at record levels.\n\nMy Labour Party is one that is inclusive, diverse and representative of our society. I have no time for those who are just here to create division, those who are driven by the purity of their politics. Labour needs to be pluralistic and the NEC needs to reflect that. I believe Labour has moved in the right direction to become electable, but it is too far detached from its working class roots.\n\nI am the CLP secretary for Bristol North West. In this constituency we know how to win, we did it in 2017 and again in 2019. I am also running as a Bristol councillor candidate in May. I am a member of Open Labour and a proud trans woman.\n\nJane Thomas\n\nMembership Number\n\nA784581\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nThis is a general election year and a chance to finally end 14 disastrous years of Tory government. We simply can’t afford any more of this, certainly not my children, my friends and my community.\n\nIt’s why I’ve been out on the doorstep day in, day out in Sheffield and across the UK and will continue to do so throughout this year and the next. It’s why I’m a member of Yorkshire and Humber regional Board. Why I’m delighted to be Co Director of Labour to Win. Why I led the successful selection and election of Labour’s first mayor in South Yorkshire.\n\nI was formerly Head of the England Team at Friends of the Earth. I remain committed to the green agenda, to devolution and to closer ties with Europe.\n\nWe need to focus. This is not the time to be riven with internal battles. The next few years won’t be easy. It’s vital we focus on the main prize of a second [and third] term; winning in our devolved nations; having Labour mayors in place; and crucially – strong Labour councils up and down the country.\n\nPlease also nominate Akehurst, Baxter, Davies, Duale, Prashar, Josan, Wimbury\n\nMary Wimbury\n\nMembership Number\n\nA555105\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nLabour’s focus must be on getting into Government to tackle the cost of living crisis and climate change, alongside rebuilding public services.We also need NEC reps who will constructively challenge on behalf of ordinary members.\n\nTo win power in Westminster we need to take back and hold the rural and coastal seats and small towns we held 20 years ago. Such areas are under-represented at Labour’s top table. I’m a Constituency Secretary in North Wales but joined the party as a teenager in Kent and have been an officer and an activist in Yorkshire and London. I understand how the party works – warts and all. I’m a former parliamentary candidate, General Election Agent, Local Campaign Committee Chair, CLP Chair and Women’s Officer. I’m on the NEC of our sister party, the Co-op Party, trustee of a national education charity and my day job is running a social care organisation. I’m a member of Community Union and the GMB. I know what’s needed for good governance and if elected I’d uphold high standards, be accessible to members and report back regularly.\n\nContact: [email protected] or 07958 521344\n\nPlease also support Akehurst, Baxter, Davies, Duale, Prashar, Singh Josan and Thomas\n\nJohn Wiseman\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0023586\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nAs a Labour activist for over 25 years, I have held the positions of CLP Chair, Secretary, Vice-Chair One and Two, TULO and manfgurindery others. As a local councillor for over six years, I was able to take part in the scruitiny process as well as represent my community as a local Governor of three schools. As a chair of scruitiny as well as the Labour group for my council and Liverpool City Region Transport Committee, I was seen as a leader, facilitating policy discussions. As an active member of Unite’s National Political Committee, I believe trade unions must be at the centre of policy making in the party. Also as a former member of the National Policy Forum, I have contributed to policy ahead of general elections. As a regional executive/board member of the party in the North West for many years i have dealt with the positives and negatives of democracy i. Overall I feel we need representatives that listen and deliver for their members. I promise to communicate on regular basis encourage more diversity in representation in all levels in our party and overall be accountable. Be wise, nominate and vote for John Wiseman.\n\nMichael Adaarewa\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1423927\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am currently BAME officer for Gloucester and it will be a great opportunity for me to expand my knowledge and political experience as a member of the Labour Party. With the right support, with my desire to learn and my willingness to serve the Party I think I will be suitable for this post. The Party needs lovers of wisdom people who are willing to learn and contribute educationally to the principles and philosophy of the party, in a scientific manner.\n\nMUSATPHA B. ZAMAAN\n\nMembership Number\n\nL3095247\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am, the BAME officer of Milton Keynes Central Labour Party, seeking nomination for BAME representative within the NEC. I stand on the principles of equality, justice, and empowerment for all. My candidacy is fueled by a profound commitment to addressing the unique challenges faced by Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic communities. I recognise the systemic injustices that persist in our country specially under the 14-year Tory government, and pledge to be an advocate for change within our party and society at large.\n\nDrawing from my personal experiences and the voices of those I represent, I aim to bring an understanding of the issues affecting BAME individuals to our party’s agenda. From tackling racial inequality in education, employment, healthcare, and housing, I will champion policies that promote inclusivity and opportunity for every member of our diverse society.\n\nI am dedicated to fostering dialogue and collaboration within the Party to ensure that the voices of BAME members are not only heard but actively incorporated into decision-making processes. Together, let us work towards building a party that reflects the true diversity of our great country and stands as a beacon of progress and solidarity for generations to come.\n\nChristopher Knight\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1514624\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am writing to express my interest in the position of BAME Officer. I firmly believe that I have the necessary skills and experiences to contribute effectively to this role. I am a union activist and sit on the TUC National Executive Council as the BAME representative.\n\nWith a strong background in diversity and inclusion initiatives, I have developed a deep understanding of the challenges faced by BAME individuals in various settings. My experience as a prison officer has allowed me to engage with individuals from diverse backgrounds and advocate for their rights and needs.\n\nFurthermore, I possess excellent communication and organizational skills, which are essential for the role of a BAME Officer. I am confident in my ability to effectively represent the interests and concerns of the BAME community and to create an inclusive and supportive environment for all, giving everyone the opportunity to have their voice heard.\n\nI am enthusiastic about the opportunity to support and empower the BAME community, and I believe that my passion, dedication, and professional approach would make me a valuable asset to the role of BAME Officer.\n\nThank you for considering me for the position and I look forward to meeting you.\n\nNeeraj Patil\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0054413\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m standing to be your NEC BAME representative to connect our Party to the BAME community and aim to increase BAME representation in our Local councils and Parliament.\n\nI support proportional representation and fair Parliamentary selections. I don’t represent any of the “blocs,” I’m proud to call myself an independent grassroots Labour activist who served on the National Executive of BAME Labour for 10yrs\n\nI have been an active member and campaigner of the Labour Party for 20 years. I served as Lambeth Councillor for eight years and was Mayor of Lambeth from 2010 to 2011. As a Parliamentary candidate in 2017, I reduced the Conservative majority from 10180 to 1554, achieving 10.8 % swing.\n\nI’m an A&E doctor who served the NHS for 30 years. I served on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic and have seen how it affected our BAME communities disproportionately.\n\nI believe in zero tolerance towards Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, anti-Hinduism, and racial discrimination.\n\nI want our Party to win and address the cost-of-living crisis, create green jobs, rebuild our economy, revive our NHS, and invest in our schools and local government to empower our BAME communities.\n\nDR. Neeraj Patil\n\nConsultant in A&E\n\nFormer Mayor of Lambeth\n\nZafran Pervez\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1963848\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nAs a British South Asian student at the university of Leeds, I want to represent my community and others like me in this role. I want to be a voice for all ethnic minority communities by bringing their concerns to light. For too long I have experienced the symptoms of race consciousness and feeling as through I don’t belong or deserve the things that I have achieved, which is why I want to be a living example to especially younger people in minority communities to tell them that they are able to chase their dreams and aspirations and to never give up. Growing up, Barack Obama has been a role model for me because he looks like so many of us, and in turn I want to be that role model for so many young people who feel unrepresented.\n\nCarol Sewell\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0121663\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nFor the past four years, I’ve been proud to represent Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Members on our NEC. I’m standing to be your voice once again.\n\nI’m proud that as your representative on the NEC:\n\n• I’ve fought for – and won – changes to our party’s positions through the National Policy Forum, including on implementing the Windrush Lessons Learned Review, stopping the misuse of “stop and search” and ensuring the next Labour government will introduce changes that drive up BAME representation in Parliament.\n\n• I’ve secured new codes of conduct on Afrophobia and Anti-Black Racism and Islamophobia.\n\n• I worked to reintroduce the Bernie Grant Leadership Programme.\n\nIf re-elected, I will fight for:\n\n• Greater representation in Parliament, following through on our commitment to changing the law to allow All Black Shortlists – making sure our party reflects the diversity of our party and the communities we seek to serve. We must ensure greater representation for those – like Black men – who are far too often under-represented in our party.\n\n• More Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic voices in Local Government – especially at a senior level.\n\nRe-elect Carol Sewell – I will continue to fight your corner on our NEC.\n\nSiddhanth Sharma\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1771229\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nMy name is Siddhanth Sharma and I am a postgraduate alumnus from the University of Birmingham. I graduated in September 2023. I have achieved a MSc in Management.\n\nI genuinely want to make a difference by giving back to society and work for social causes. When I was 17 years old, I achieved a certificate signed by the Prime Minister for a campaign I led based on Autism. I have worked as an active listener for 7 Cups to listen to people’s problems and I found many people suffer from depression, anxiety, homelessness and family issues. I have gone around my town talking and giving food and water to the homeless. I have worked as Regional Director for an American non-profit organisation called The Borgen Project which is trying to eradicate global poverty. I want to be your NEC BAME Representative as I understand what this position requires. I’ve been a Labour Party member since 2018 and I’ve participated in many activities. Personally, the only gain I do have is to be part of something that helps improve the Labour Party and people’s lives to win more elections, which gives me great satisfaction.\n\nSoraya Adejare\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0126481\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nHaving grown up in poverty amid austerity and far-right politics, the opportunities afforded me were minimal. I don’t want this replicated for anyone and throughout my 9 years as a councillor in Hackney, I’ve worked tirelessly for the betterment of all. As an NEC representative I will continue to do so, also fighting for Labour to enable councils to build social housing on the scale needed for our communities.\n\nI will be strident in making calls for our incoming Labour Government to increase local government funding to ensure we can readily meet statutory obligations and restore services.\n\nI have been consistent in calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. I believe that Labour councillors do have a responsibility to our residents to strive for peace and that’s why I support the right of councils to take principled decisions when supporting campaigns for peace.\n\nI’m a single parent and supporter of the Single Parent Rights campaign. I brought it to Council and called for status recognition within the Equalities Act. As a current scrutiny chair, I’ve also worked collaboratively on our ongoing response to the Child Q case, our greening agenda and housing provision.\n\nMatt Collins\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1268975\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am honoured to represent the village of Bishop’s Tachbrook in Labour’s newly won administration of Warwick District. It has been a hard journey of campaigning, canvassing, and leafleting, but Labour now stands as the largest party of local government!\n\nIn Warwick, local Conservatives have failed us on social care, education, policing, town planning, transport, roads; every basic function of local government that is required to allow our residents to live good lives. These problems are echoed across our country, and I want to make sure that our national strategy serves as a robust plan for how we will fix them and fix them well.\n\nLocal government has the greatest ability to directly impact the lives of people across the country. It is so important that we get this right and show that we are Britain’s future. We can lead locally, but we need to have a strong voice in the NEC to make sure that our national strategy allows us to improve the lives of residents across the country.\n\nWe must keep up our enthusiasm for positive change and I hope that you will consider me as your representative to bring energy to the National Executive Committee.\n\nElizabeth Dennis-Harburg\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0145211\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m standing to represent local government and be a powerful advocate for councillors in all authorities on the NEC.\n\nAs Leader of North Herts District Council I’ve fought against Tory cuts to our budgets, finding innovative solutions to support our communities and continue providing the vital services that enrich their lives. I champion districts as Finance Lead for the District Councils’ Network and have built positive links with Treasury and DLUHC civil servants, delivering an additional 1% to the funding formula this year and securing help for councils struggling with Internal Drainage Board levies.\n\nAs your NEC representative for local government I’ll stand up for localism within our party. Councils are the form of government closest to people. As the largest party in local government we show people what Labour in power delivers. I will make sure we are heard and listened to. As Labour prepares for government we must shape a truly local approach to devolution which gives local people the power to deliver change for their communities. Taking back control means bringing power closer to communities, not sucking it up to the centre. I will stand up for councils and be the voice we need.\n\nClaire Holland\n\nMembership Number\n\nA838045\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nAs councillors, we have been the last line of defence for our communities through dark and challenging years. Now, we are leaders in rebuilding them as powerful, resilient communities, across the country.\n\nAfter 14 years of Conservative decline, our Labour government has a huge task to get the country back on its feet, restore trust, and have people believing in their futures again.\n\nDuring the general election and locals of 2023 and 2024, as I campaigned in towns, cities and villages across the country, it was heartening to witness that hope returning.\n\nAnd as we rebuild, councillors must have a place at the table, bringing our experience of managing crisis after crisis. We are on the front line of our communities, delivering for and alongside them.\n\nAs a life-long labour activist and trade unionist, I stood for my local council to secure free access to sports facilities for young people. 10 years on, I have the privilege of leading the London Borough of Lambeth and London Councils.\n\nAs your representative on the NEC I would draw from your knowledge and experience, wherever you are in the country, report back regularly and be a strong and passionate voice for local government.\n\nMinesh Parekh\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1230833\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m Minesh, a Labour and Co-operative Councillor in Sheffield. I’m Chair of my Group and portfolio holder for Economic Development. In Sheffield I’ve worked with colleagues to support Community Wealth Building policies, mitigate the cost-of-living crisis, and to centre climate justice in our work. Despite the difficult economic context we face, I’m proud of the decisions taken to ringfence services and deliver for residents.\n\nI’m also proud that Sheffield was the first council to support an immediate ceasefire in Gaza; it is right that councils champion our communities’ voices and stand up for peace and justice.\n\nAs NEC Rep my priority would be increasing local government funding. This Government has forced councils across the country to make unbearable cuts. It doesn’t have to be like this.\n\nAn alternative future is within reach; local authorities building council housing, creating good green jobs, and providing publicly-owned buses and trams. But we won’t get there with one arm tied behind our backs.\n\nThe next Labour Government can and must end fourteen years of austerity, lift the burden from our councils, and transform local government.\n\nI hope to win your support, and be a voice for councillors and councils on the NEC.\n\nPeter Wheeler\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1230833\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nAfter 14 wasted Tory years, the General Election saw Labour winning across the country. Winning in areas that have never been Labour before as well as regaining the trust of former strongholds.\n\nOur Government now has a real chance to work with local councils to tackle the key issues facing us – housing, the environment, poverty reduction and re-building the economy. It won’t be easy, there will be difficult times ahead but to be successful Labour local Government and Labour central Government need to stand shoulder to shoulder.\n\nAs a local Councillor, Trade Unionist and Labour Party member of 50 years standing, I believe I have the experience, passion and commitment to our Labour values to help secure the best possible partnership between our councillors and our Government – delivering real results for the people we represent.\n\nI’d like to pay tribute to the work Tudor and Nesil have done for Labour local government and also ask you to support the election of Claire Holland, leader of Lambeth, to the NEC.\n\nAndy Furlong\n\nMembership Number\n\nA511333\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nRules-based institutions are crucial for fostering stability, fairness and social progress. The Labour Party is no exception.\n\nOur rules and constitution provide a framework for consistent decision-making, ensuring accountability, and preventing arbitrary power. Inevitably, these rules will sometimes be challenged and tested, hence the importance of our National Constitutional Committee (NCC).\n\nI seek election based on 40 years of continuous, active party membership. I have served at every level, including Branch, Constituency, Regional Executive and National Policy Forum. I have been elected councillor and a parliamentary candidate.\n\nI have extensive experience of selection panels, local government appeals, and disciplinary investigations. I have been the appointed NEC representative for several parliamentary selections, always acting fairly and impartially as per the rulebook.\n\nAs a professional scientist with senior leadership experience in manufacturing and the voluntary sector, I firmly believe in evidence-based decision-making. This, coupled with my deep commitment to fairness, equality, justice, and the principles of democratic socialism, provides a strong match with the qualities and competencies required of a member of the NCC.\n\nI am a member of Swansea West CLP, GMB, Co-op Party, Fabians, Scientists for Labour and Labour Business.\n\nPlease also nominate Brahampreet Kaur, Sionedd-Mair Richards and Arooj Shah.\n\nRachel Garnham\n\nMembership Number\n\nA777413\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nDisciplinary processes must be transparent, accountable and above all, fair to grassroots members and trade unionists.\n\nIn my three years on Labour’s National Executive Committee I fought for the principles of natural justice to be applied within Labour’s disciplinary processes. These are seemingly too often ignored – the right for those accused to have clear, timely information, to have the opportunity to put their case, and a genuine right to appeal.\n\nI’m very concerned about equity in Labour’s disciplinary processes. It is troubling to hear how many Jewish people who support Palestinian human rights are reported to have been excluded from membership, and I am also concerned about fair treatment for disabled members, older members and those with mental health conditions. The Forde report exposed significant failings and must be seriously taken on board\n\nIf elected, I pledge to uphold the rulebook, reject factionalism and apply the principles of natural justice.\n\nI’m an experienced activist, Labour Party member for 30 years, member of UCU, Socialist Health Association and Socialist Education Association. I’ve participated in many disciplinary hearings and always been scrupulous in fair application of the rules. Please also support Emine Ibrahim, Dave Levy and Khaled Moyeed.\n\nBrahmpreet Gulati\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1938735\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nAs a 23-year-old, Indian female, coming from a working-class background there have been many challenges growing up. Whether that be my parents working day and night to make a living or escaping educational challenges. To even being told I wouldn’t make it to university.\n\nAll odds are against individuals like me, but I graduated in Religion, Politics and Society from King’s College London and am currently working in national security.\n\nI strongly believe that it is my responsibility to ensure that individuals are not held back in society often due to the unfair circumstances around them. I understand and will continue to represent the values of the Labour Party which are fundamental to ensuring everyone has a fair chance.\n\nI will bring objectively and fairness and a commitment to upholding Labour’s rules and high standards of behaviour to hearing cases as an NCC member.\n\nAchievements:\n\nKCL BAME OFFICER\n\nLeicester Young Labour BAME Officer\n\nLeicester Young Labour co- Chair\n\nFuture Candidates Programme graduate\n\nPlease also nominate:\n\nAndy Furlong\n\nSioned Mair Richards\n\nArooj Shah\n\nEmine Ibrahim\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0150489\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am standing to serve a third term on National Constitutional Committee. I am currently the longest serving CLP rep on the NCC and bring a wealth of experience to the role, I have also previously served as Chair of the committee. I have always been a strong believer in the importance of the party rule book and ensuring it is applied in a fair and just manner. I have vast experience of dealing with internal disciplinary matters from my 7 years on the NCC and also from my previous role on the London Regional executive. I have over the years built an approach and reputation that first and foremost removes factionalism from disciplinary processes and focuses on a fair and just approach for all sides in often difficult cases. I have also sat on regional membership appeals and panel appeals for Local Government selections. I believe in ensuring the integrity of the process to achieve fairness for all. If we ensure the rules are applied fairly to all then we will achieve a unified and effective Party.\n\nDave Levy\n\nMembership Number\n\nA006829\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am seeking your support to sit on our Party’s NCC.\n\nI promise that I will act with fairness and consider the evidence on any cases on which I sit.\n\nI believe that our rules should be interpreted in the context of UK law and human rights law and that the principles of natural justice must be maintained and offered to all members.\n\nI joined the party in 1974. Since moving to Lewisham in 2010, I have held a number of positions in my CLP, LCF & branch, having been intermittently Secretary of the CLP & LCF over that time. I have acted as a workers’ companion for the last seven years which gives me much experience in assessing cases of bullying and discrimination. I have been trained in employment and equality law.\n\nI am a member of CLPD and have authored and campaigned for many rule changes to make the party accountable to its members.\n\nI am supported by the CLGA and Momentum and would ask you to vote for me, and my running mates, Khaled Moyeed, Emine Ibrahim and Rachel Garnham.\n\nDr Neeraj Patil\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0054413\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am standing for the National Constitutional Committee as an independent grass-roots Labour activist who doesn’t represent any of the blocs,\n\nI want the three pillars of our party, The executive, Parliamentary Labour Party, and Membership, to function effectively under our Constitution and handle complaints referred to NCC with fairness and impartiality.\n\nI believe in zero tolerance towards Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, anti-Hinduism, and racial discrimination.\n\nI have been an active member and campaigner of the Labour Party for 20 years. I have served as Lambeth Councillor for eight years and was Mayor of Lambeth from 2010 to 2011. I have been a ward secretary and served on the NPF & National Executive of BAME Labour.\n\nI am an A&E doctor who has served the NHS for 30 years. I have worked as a Consultant in A&E on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWorking as an A&E Consultant, I have medico-legal experience to handle complaints fairly and effectively within the timeframe recommended by law.\n\nI will discharge my duties without prejudice or bias, ensuring that the rules of natural justice are followed during the disciplinary hearings.\n\nDr. Neeraj Patil, MBBS, FRCS, MRCS, FCEM\n\nConsultant, A&E\n\nMayor of Lambeth (2010-2011)\n\nMs Sioned-Mair Richards\n\nMembership Number\n\nA558860\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI joined the Labour Party (in the early 90s) to see a fairer Britain. I knew only Labour had the values to make this happen. There was Tory sleaze at the time, there is Tory sleaze now. And it has got worse. Cronyism, the special COVID contracts. They stink. The Tories say “Oh they’re all the same”. We need to show we’re not; that integrity and transparency are our watch words.\n\nAs a Sheffield City Councillor I was Group Chief Whip. I chaired the Audit & Standards Committee for three years and also that of the South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Authority. In these roles I led complex enquiries into complaints made about both councillors and officers & sorted them out.\n\nDiscipline in the Party has to be fair and seen to be fair. It also needs to be undertaken in a timely manner. We cannot have people hanging around waiting for their case to be dealt with. I want to bring my experience and commitment to push to make this happen.\n\nPlease nominate and vote for me in the CLP section of the NCC and also nominate and vote for Andy Furlong, Brahmpreet Kaur and Arooj Shah.\n\nOnkar Sahota\n\nMembership Number\n\nB035541\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nBeing child of an immigrant family, I passionately believe in aspirational politics, where every generation does better than their parents. I’ve benefited from and believe in Labour values, that’s why I joined the Labour Party even before I joined the medical school.\n\nI have always fought against injustices, inequalities, discrimination and lack of equality in opportunity. My experience includes:\n\n– 35 years as NHS GP\n\n– Labour London Assembly Member (2012-2024)\n\n– 9 Years as Chair of Assembly Health Committee and former Assembly Chair\n\n– Member GMB, Unite and Co-operative Party\n\n– Former CLP Chair, Local Magistrate and School Governor\n\nThrough my NHS experience and political background, I offer a unique perspective to serve our party and future Labour Government which will have to rebuild the NHS.\n\nI will campaign to get a Labour Government elected and through the work of the NEC ensure that it delivers the change the country needs.\n\nThe NEC should ensure our Leadership is in touch with the aspirations of the members, that party governance meets the highest standards and holds itself to scrutiny. I champion unity and will give voice to grassroot members and CLPs who are the backbone of the Labour Party.\n\nArooj Shah\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0042486\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nArooj Shah (L0042486)\n\nI am currently in my second year as Chair of the National Constitution Committee. I’m also the Leader of Oldham Council, and previously served as a Commissioner on Gordon Brown’s Commission on the UK’s Future.\n\nAs we approach a General Election this year, it is so important that the Labour Party is ready to govern, and its crucial that our rules are followed by our members and that any issues are dealt with robustly and fairly. I believe my record as NCC Chair shows my willingness to do this and to help create a Labour movement we can all be proud of and one that the public trusts to be Britain’s Future.\n\nPlease also nominate :\n\nRichards\n\nGulati\n\nFurlong\n\nDean Collins\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0144227\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nAs a Labour party activist for over 25 years, I have held the positions of Vice-Chair, Equalities(disabled) and TULO officer in the CLP’s I have been involved in. As a local councillor since 2012, I was able to take part in the policy setting at both County & Borough level. As a cabinet member & V. Chair of Labour group for the council, I was seen as a leader, and regularly held policy discussions before setting the policy of council. As an active member of Unite’s Regional Political Committee, I believe trade unions must be at the centre of policy making in the party, whilst working to achieve policies that work for the working population. As a regional board member of the Union (Unite), I speak up for members on what is needed, alongside the work I do in the workplace on policies at the acute trust I work at. Representatives need to listen and do their best for the members. As a disabled person I promise to encourage more diversity in representation in our party therefore pushing for policies that stand for the many.\n\nPlease also support candidates backed by the Centre-left Grassroots Alliance; Fraser McGuire and Liv Marshall.\n\nKelly Duddridge\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1801850\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am looking to join the NPF to play my part in shaping Labour policy to build up to & secure a second term. We will need 10 years to resuscitate our public services.\n\nAttending several conferences as CLP delegate gave me a thirst for the finer details of policy development & I want to help bring change that improves the lives of many who are struggling.\n\nI am committed to seeing Labour win this coming election because far too much hope and necessity for change depend on us ending 14 years of Tory misery.\n\nBeing at the raw end of Tory austerity, I believe voices like mine are beneficial to making sure that those on low incomes, or none, are remembered, represented, & respected in our policy-making while maintaining a pragmatic approach.\n\nAs a council estate mother of 4, I see how Tory priorities have negatively affected the experiences & prospects of our children. As a councillor, I see how they’ve decimated community services.\n\nTime to stop surviving & start thriving!\n\nWe need to be sensible, focused & strong to face the tough challenges ahead.\n\nWe need to get Britain’s future back\n\nPlease also support Neghat Khan, Nathan Oswin, Rory Palmer & Ruby Simpson (Youth place)”\n\nNeghat Khan\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0101522\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nMy name is Neghat Khan. For the past 10 years, I’ve been a Nottingham City Councillor leading on areas like communities, education, housing and regeneration. I’m a proud member of the GMB and the Co-op Party. It has been an honour to be your NPF Rep for the past two years, serving as part of the Safe and Secure Communities Policy Commission.\n\nI stood on a platform of engaging with members: listening to your views and putting them at the heart of Labour’s policymaking. I’ve spent two years making this a reality, delivering a manifesto we all can be proud of.\n\nLocal government has been under attack from this callous Tory government. Budgets have been slashed, services dismantled, and one in five councils say they could be insolvent by next year. Our next manifesto needs to secure the vital funds our communities and local authorities need.\n\nI want to engage with members and voters across the East Midlands, and on the policy issues that matter to them. Together, we can deliver a Labour victory and Keir Starmer keys to Number 10. I would encourage you to also support Kelly Duddridge, Nathan Oswin, Rory Palmer and Ruby Simpson (Youth Rep).\n\nFraser McGuire\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1823756\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m the Chair of Unite Hospitality East Midlands branch, and have been the Young Labour rep for the East Midlands since 2022. Growing up in rural Derbyshire I have seen the devastating effect of Tory austerity on our communities, with cuts to local government funding, social care, education and transport. I’ve organised with hundreds of Young Labour members and young workers; I know how desperately change is needed.\n\nI will stand up for transformative policies this country needs- like the nationalisation of key services- and as a climate activist I believe we have a long way to go to tackle the coming environmental crisis.\n\nAs a committed trade unionist, and vice-president of Derby Trades Council I will fight to see the New Deal for Working People go as far as possible. We need to unshackle our trade unions by fighting to repeal all anti-union legislation from the last 40 years and we must commit to pushing through radical workers rights reforms in the first 100 days of a Labour government.\n\nI’m proud to be supported by the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance, and Momentum and I urge you to nominate and vote for Dean Collins and Liv Marshall (youth position).\n\nMatthew Melvin\n\nMembership Number\n\nL3098879\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nWith climate change, the challenges (and opportunities) of AI, deepening inequalities, and the rise of populism, the only effective way to counter this is with experience from outside of politics.\n\nAs someone who has been in the marketing field for the past five years, I believe in supporting personal data rights and freedoms, as well as safely and responsibly harnessing AI’s potential.\n\nFor me, the role technology will play in shaping our society cannot be left to the free market to decide; according to a recent poll, 25% of America’s Gen Z now believe the holocaust is exaggerated. When such topics are as graphic, poignant, and disturbing as the holocaust, it’s no wonder that misinformation breeds – the raw truth is simply not advertiser friendly, and is either removed or not made in the first place. It’s imperative that we, in consultation with trade unions, decide how emerging technology benefits our society before the free market decides for us.\n\nI’m eager to give my voice and experience to the NPF so we can build a safe, green and digital future where everyone benefits. I hope you’ll consider me for this role.\n\nJacob Olaniya\n\nMembership Number\n\nL3092175\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am happy for this great opportunity to apply to represent our team Labour Party for this position of our National Policy Forum CLP Representative of the East Midlands. However, I would have the better chances and more ability to provides supports and helps for our, students and our communities of our Great Britain. This would be a great position for me to be providing the excellent services and campaigns for the Labour Party, for the greater supports for our Leaders in the Party to win and secure the no10.\n\nNathan Oswin\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0117251\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nIf we’re to make the most of the chance to serve in Government we need to harness our members’ knowledge and experience to help create policy.\n\nFor two years I’ve worked with members to do just that, putting forward motions on our NHS, Europe, Justice, Energy and Equalities.\n\nI’m asking you to vote for me to continue to fight for you, your priorities and to ensure Labour delivers a better future for our East Midlands.\n\nAusterity has ravaged our country, decimating our public services and seen inequality grow. I’ve been fighting against this for over a decade, campaigning with those bereaved by Covid, a Trustee for Hillsborough Law and now fighting for working people with the TUC at the Covid Inquiry.\n\nThe East Midlands has always been bottom of the list when it comes to investment, to really change things round here, Labour will need to recognise this cannot keep being the case. That’s what I’ll be making the case on.\n\nWe need pragmatic but ambitious plans, grounded in our members’ lived experiences to really make change happen. That’s how you rebuild Britain and the East Midlands.\n\nPlease also support Neghat Khan, Kelly Duddridge, Rory Palmer & Ruby Simpson (Youth place).\n\nRory Palmer\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0001989\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nOver these past two years the National Policy Forum has finalised a policy platform that will renew our country and build a better future; a policy programme that is ambitious and deliverable, showing that Labour is ready to govern again.\n\nWith over ten years experience as a National Policy Forum rep (as a regional rep & as a Member of the European Parliament) I have ensured the views of East Midlands’ members, CLPs, trade unions & affiliates have been heard through our policy-making process and reflected in the final year policy document agreed at last year’s Conference.\n\nWorking with trade union colleagues, I’ve helped secure a commitment to the Dying to Work campaign in our policy platform; a campaign that seeks to strengthen employment rights for workers with a terminal illness and which started here in the East Midlands. In previous NPF cycles I worked on key policies including the Living Wage, social housing, legal aid, climate policy and local control of bus services.\n\nPlease consider supporting me: I bring significant experience, a commitment to ensuring the National Policy Forum’s work is accessible to members and a track record representing East Midlands members.\n\nThere can be no complacency as the General Election approaches.\n\nWinning elections is how we change lives. I want to work with party members across our region to shape policy to win a Labour Government and to keep Labour in Government.\n\nI would also encourage you to support Kelly Duddridge, Neghat Khan, Nathan Oswin & Ruby Simpson (youth place).\n\nHayden Wilkinson\n\nMembership Number\n\nL3110666\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI believe that I am able to take the priorities of the region into effect as I have spoken to people across the east midlands and many have said they want younger representation as they understand the issues young people face and that is something I can do.\n\nI will do my best to focus on helping both families and business in the cost of living crisis, cleaning up our streets from both flytipping and crime but also providing support to education, transport and road maintenance.\n\nLouise Chinnery\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0077791\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI have been a Labour Party activist all my life and am the Chair of Mid Bedfordshire CLP. I was proud to play my part in our historic by-election victory and to see the big difference our Labour MP is already making to our community.\n\nAs a UNISON National\n\nOfficer, I campaign on behalf of tens of thousands of support staff in the NHS, who under difficult circumstances, keep the NHS running every day. I have seen first hand the impact of Tory neglect and the cost-of-living crisis. If elected I will endeavour to help shape Labour Party policy to ensure the NHS is put back on its feet and public services are fit for the future.\n\nLabours new deal for working people will be the most radical reform of workers rights in a generation. It will be transformative and provide workers with the meaningful rights and protections they deserve.\n\nAs the parent of an autistic child, my family have experienced the brunt of austerity. I will engage through the NPF to ensure that parents and kids with specials educational needs have a voice in much needed reform of the current system.\n\nPlease also nominate Alex Mayer, Richard Howitt and Adam Fox.\n\nAdam Fox\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0093669\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI have been a Labour Party member for 20 years and in that time I have been a Labour Councillor and Labour Group Leader in local government. I’m a proud trade unionist. In my local party I have held various roles including CLP Secretary and CLP Chair.\n\nAs a local councillor I put Labour Party policy into practice – building new council houses, tackling the climate emergency and supporting our local high street. I want to help further develop policies like these so that we transform the lives of ordinary people after 14 years of Tory disaster. We need to develop policy not just for the first year of a Labour government but for the next decade and more so that we can rebuild our country.\n\nI promise to engage with members and ensure that over the coming years Labour continues to develop policies that support ordinary working people across our region. I have campaigned across the region and I will make myself available to Labour members in the East so that I represent your views on the National Policy Forum and ensure that members’ voices are heard.\n\nPlease also nominate Louise Chinnery, Richard Howitt and Alex Mayer.\n\nRachel Garnham\n\nMembership Number\n\nA777413\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am an experienced, committed campaigner serving seven years on the National Policy Forum, 20 plus years in local Labour positions and previously three years on the National Executive Committee. I am a UCU activist and strong supporter of Labour’s trade union link.\n\nLabour needs a policy programme that will win elections and transform lives; seriously addressing the cost of living and climate crises; redistributing wealth and rebuilding public services.\n\nOn the NPF Public Services Policy Commission I have championed NPF submissions from Eastern Region CLPs including:\n\n-NHS investment not privatisation;\n\n-Local accountability of schools; extending Free School Meals;\n\n-Increased pay for health, social care, and education workers across the public sector.\n\nI have promoted reversal of Tory attacks on civil liberties; and listening to women by advocating policy made by Labour’s Women’s Conference. At the NPF in Nottingham I put forward amendments that made a difference, including a commitment to international law in Palestine.\n\nI want to continue to promote this platform on the NPF, and work towards a more democratic, transparent and inclusive policy-making process, recognising the sovereignty of annual conference.\n\nMembers matter.\n\nPlease also support other grassroots candidates Bryn Griffiths, Shahid Nadeem, Maxine Sadza and Alex Small.\n\nBryn Griffiths\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1949828\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI will always prioritise giving a voice to ordinary members and making myself available to the Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs). I will act as an advocate of the radical policies which have been passed by our Conference.\n\nI will support the Trade Unions in making sure that we are bold in our implementation of the New Deal for Working People. Labour’s Green Prosperity Plan should be the central plank of our policy and I will always advocate a radical approach that is proportionate to the challenge the planet faces. On economic policy I want our party to back our public services e.g. I will always argue for the rail service to return to the public sector. I will stand with the public sector unions in their efforts to remove the privateers from the National Health Service and Social Care. I will abide by Labour Conference policy passed by an overwhelming majority that we should introduce proportional representation.\n\nI am standing with the Shahid Nadeem, Maxine Sadza, Rachel Garnham\n\nBryn Griffiths, Alex Small (Youth position) as a Centre Left Grassroots Alliance candidate.

To achieve that we must win back seats across our region. That needs a brilliant Labour manifesto that reflects the concerns of residents where we live and draws on the expertise of you – our members.\n\nIf re-elected to the National Policy Forum I’ll work with you to develop a strong regional policy. Our policy-making should be outward looking, where we seek ideas and expertise from a huge range of people, and where there is space for robust debate. You need and deserve more involvement. At every stage I’ll fight for the process to be transparent and accessible to CLP members.\n\nI’ve been a Labour and trade union activist for 25 years, campaigning in every CLP across our brilliant region. I’m experienced at policy making and proudly served as your MEP.\n\nI’ve never minded speaking truth to power and I promise that on the NPF I will always stand up for CLP voices, not the ‘Westminster bubble’.\n\nLet’s get Britain’s future back. Let’s win.\n\nShahid Nadeem\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1811877\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m CLP Secretary and treasurer of the Unite Legal Workers’ branch and an active member of the Society of Labour Lawyers, which provides legal and policy advice to the Labour Party. If re-elected to the NPF, I would like to utilise my experience as a Member of Unison, SME4Labour Executive board member, founder of Pakistanis for Labour, vice chair of the South Essex Cooperative Party and Western East Anglia Coop Party Council to develop strong regional policy and engaging members.\n\nI’ll lay the groundwork for a bold agenda on the economy, jobs, health, education, housing, peace, and human rights; this will transform our country. It has been an honour to be your NPF Rep for the past two years. Apart from contributing to the Safe Communities commission, I also worked for amendments including Â£15 wage, housing, a Green New Deal, and Public ownership. I stood on a platform of engaging with members and putting members’ views at the heart of Labour’s policy-making, and I will continue to do so.\n\nI’m asking you to vote for me to continue to fight for you and your priorities and support other grassroots candidates Rachel Garnham, Bryn Griffiths, Maxine Sadza and Alex Small (Youth Rep).\n\nMaxine Sadza\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1431770\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nEastern Region\n\nMaxine Sadza\n\nMembership No: L1431770\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nWe have seen the effects of Tory austerity amongst the most marginalised in our society, leading to increased poverty, more food banks and poverty wages for public sector workers.\n\nI am currently a CLP Treasurer, retired member of Unite the Union and have been Women’s Officer, BAME Officer and Policy Officer. I was the UNITE Equalities Rep for my workplace whilst working for the NHS as a Biomedical Scientist. I brought up my two sons as a single parent. I am a grassroots Community activist involved in Acorn the Union. I am also a member of the organising committee of a local multicultural community festival and am the first BAME woman to be elected as a Councillor to Southend City Council. I stood to be a councillor in order to be a voice for the voiceless and to represent minority ethnic groups within the local community.\n\nI pledge to represent members’ views, work to ensure that democracy is upheld, and be a Champion the New Deal for Working People as well as Labour’s Green Prosperity Plan on the NPF. I will also oppose increased privatisation in our Health service.\n\nI am proud to be supported by the Centre Left Grassroots Alliance and Momentum.

I am also a social researcher with over 20 years policy development experience. If re-elected, I will continue to ensure local government is clearly represented on the NPF.\n\nAs a social researcher I am passionate about public engagement, opinion gathering and consultation. I have developed policy in public health, local government, housing, VAWG and education.\n\nI have been a Labour member and campaigner since 1987. I managed Party polling and the monthly message polls for the Labour Strategy Unit for two years, informing our election campaign strategies. By understanding the issues that mattered to the electorate, I communicated Party policy in a way that resonated with voters and members.\n\nI have held the offices of Group Chair, Chief whip and Secretary. I am a member of GMB, Unison and the Co-op party.\n\nIf re-elected to the NPF I will report regularly to London councillors ensuring they continue to play an active policy development role.\n\nBy supporting me you will have an experienced, enthusiastic NPF rep, passionate about winning a Labour Government.\n\nI would also encourage you to support Sara Conway, Bora Kwon, Abdi Mohammed and Hollie Wright.\n\nSara Conway\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1468535\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m honoured to be a local councillor in Burnt Oak and Cabinet Member for Community Safety and Resident Participation in Barnet’s first Labour Council administration. I’m also Chair of the Safer Communities Partnership Board and a member of the GMB, Unison, the Fabian Society and JLM.\n\nI have 30 years’ experience from the creative, commercial and community sectors, bringing people together to develop and deliver transformative policies and initiatives. I continue to learn constantly from, and really enjoy working with, the local VCFS, including as a trustee at Sebby’s Corner (providing essentials for children in need), the Artsdepot theatre, and the Jewish Volunteering Network, and as a member of Nisa-Nashim Muslim-Jewish Women’s Network; and supporting local residents’ community and environmental groups.\n\nAs a member of the Greater London Authority Civic Futures fellowship alumni I’m part of a policy development network bringing local government and civic society together to build and test ideas to help London’s recovery.\n\nI’m standing for the NPF to help share learning and build this collaborative spirit and communities focus into policy discussion and development across London, listening to and working with local party members.\n\nPlease also nominate: Chowdhury, Kwon, Mohammed and Wright.\n\nJack\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1965328\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nAydin Dikerdem\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1217068\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nThe next Labour government is going to inherit a deeply challenging economic climate, but it’ll also be faced with a nation desperate for change after 14 years of Tory austerity. I think the role of the NPF is to be an engine for ambition during this period, that tests and offers ideas and solutions from the membership, affiliates and unions.\n\nAs a local councillor and Cabinet Member for Housing I’m acutely aware of the challenges facing the public sector but also the radical alternatives that can be achieved with bold thinking. I joined the Labour Party in 2013 as austerity was biting and the housing crisis was deepening yet saw how workable pragmatic left-wing alternatives were side-lined. I’ve seen first-hand the intersection between policy and campaigns when working as an organiser for the New Economics Foundation, which has given me a strong grounding in the politics and national conversation around policy. And of course I’m now responsible for developing and implementing policy at the local level in a swing Council.\n\nI’m glad to be backed by the Centre Left Grassroots Alliance and would ask you to also nominate Rathi Guhadesan, Dave Levy, Pat Quigley, and India Burgess (Youth Position).\n\nRathi Guhadasan\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1362546\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m the CLP secretary for Brent East, Vice Chair for Kingsbury ward and served as ward organiser in my previous ward. I have attended the Labour national conference in 2022 and 2023, as CLP and Socialist Health Association delegate. I have participated in writing motions at ward level and for the SHA. As CLP secretary, I am familiar with the Labour Party rule book and allied resources. I am a national SHA Vice-Chair and London Branch secretary.\n\nI’m a participating member of Doctors in Unite and a qualified paediatrician with a background in international public health and the international development and humanitarian sectors. I have a keen interest in many areas of policy, particularly health, and would like to see a more integrated, intersectoral approach to public health policy. We must also see the New Deal for Working people delivered in full as well as a proper Green New Deal. If elected, I will endeavour to represent the grassroots of our Labour movement and be accountable and transparent to members.\n\nI’m proud to be supported by Momentum and the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance (CLGA). Please also nominate and vote for Dave Levy, Pat Quigley, Aydin Dikerdem, and India Burgess (Youth Position).\n\nBora Kwon\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1212405\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m standing to be an NPF member to offer my services and experience as a Labour party member, activist, and councillor in this crucial time as we head towards a general election.\n\nI joined the party 12 years ago, in the midst of the Tory-Lib Dem coalition years when I could see that the direction the country was going in was leaving behind huge parts of our society, and in the intervening years we have only seen things get worse. I have been a councillor in a London borough since 2018, where I currently serve as the Cabinet Member, and have seen how Labour policies in action can truly change lives.\n\nAs a general election approaches, our policies will be under scrutiny by the public so as a party and movement it’s vital that Labour presents a credible, inspiring and hopeful vision to the country. If elected as an NPF member I will report back and work with CLPs to enable members to contribute to our policy making process.\n\nPlease also nominate Rezina Chowdhury, Sara Conway, Abdi Mohammed.\n\nDave Levy\n\nMembership Number\n\nA006829\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI believe our Party needs to unite around our core values so that we can develop a policy programme which will make a real difference to people’s lives when we get into government.\n\nI will fight for a policy platform in the interests of the many, not the few, based on anti-poverty, pro-social justice and anti-racist principles. I’ll also place membership involvement at the heart of my work.\n\nMy experience as an economist, IT professional, trade unionist, and civil rights campaigner would mean I am very well-placed for the Economy, Culture, or Democracy commissions.\n\nI have been a member of the Labour Party for 50 years and have held various positions with it.\n\nI am President of my GMB branch, trained in employment law; I represent & organise members in their workplace.\n\nI am a member/subscriber to Amnesty, Liberty, the Open Rights Group, and the Labour Movement for Europe. I am active in Another Europe and CLPD.\n\nI will work hard, represent you, and remain fully open and transparent.\n\nI’m proud to be supported by Momentum and the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance (CLGA), please also nominate and vote for Rathi Guhadesan, Pat Quigley, Aydin Dikerdem, and India Burgess (Youth Position).\n\nAbdi Mohamed\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1221935\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am standing for the National Policy Forum because I am committed to representing the varied experiences and values of our members, ensuring that our policies are inclusive and effective in addressing the challenges facing our communities.\n\nHaving worked in local government, in Parliament and now for a national charity, I want to use my experience of policy development and implementation to help our party develop compassionate, detailed and robust policy. I have a track record of campaigning and winning in various policy areas, from children’s rights to disability policy.\n\nAs a year-round campaigner, I’m passionate about listening and acting on conversations with members of our party and with residents from being on the doorstep when canvassing. I want to use this experience as your delegate on the National Policy Forum.\n\nAs your delegate, I commit to:\n\n– Provide a regular members’ update\n\n– Presenting and reporting back during CLP meetings\n\n– Work with members and parties to develop ideas\n\nPlease also support Rezina Chowdhury, Sara Conway and Bora Kwon.\n\nFreya Nowell\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1900889\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am a life-long Londoner, Labour supporter, trade union member, part-time carer, innovator (a bold claim I know, but I promise I can back it up!) and policy nerd. I have exceptional people and operations skills, gained from a long, first career stint at Waitrose. I have undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, both of which focused heavily on policy development and innovation, which gave me the bug for working in politics, development and policymaking. After struggling to find an entry-level job in that field, I worked for my undergraduate university, leading outreach work with local schools to support improved access to Higher Education, and particularly Russell Group universities. From this, I went on to work for an education charity, developing training and support for teachers and school leaders working in some of the most promising (but also financially deprived) schools across the country. I bit the bullet and trained as a teacher myself a few years ago and spent an interesting (but joyous!) two years full-time in the classroom 2019-21. I went back into the charity sector in ’21. You can probably guess why I would be beyond honoured to represent you all and support a future of progressive, radical change!\n\nPatricia Bridget Quigley\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1505915\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nThe Labour Party must enable change for the better for the lives of current and future generations of working-class people in this country. I will work hard for policies that address entrenched poverty, ensure secure, decent housing for all and high quality educational, health and public services that deliver good outcomes for everyone, creating a more equitable and just society.\n\nA lifelong Labour Party supporter, I joined 8 years ago and have been active since in my local Labour party, previously Secretary of my ward branch for 5 years and now the CLP’s Women’s Officer and Secretary of Women’s branch.\n\nI worked in Education for over 40 years, as a classroom and headteacher; I’m diplomatic and experienced at working with a breadth of views. I have an interest in SEND policy and issues affecting families and children. I am a retired member of the NEU.\n\nI’m a community campaigner, fighting for social rent housing and the Right to Food. I’m a member of several Socialist Societies, including SHA and I sit on the National Executive of the Socialist Education Association.\n\nI’m supported by the CLGA, please nominate me and Rathi Guhadasan, Aydin Dikerdem, Dave Levy, and India Burgess (Youth Position).\n\nJohn Bowden\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0147273\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nGreat policymaking starts with a bold and creative vision of the society we want to be part of. It’s followed by building a policy framework which takes a unified approach to environmental, social and economic justice.\n\nIf elected I will bring a socialist vision to the NPF, backed up by policy expertise as both a qualified environmental and social value practitioner, and my experience as a homebuilding sustainability director.\n\nIn today’s world, climate justice needs to be factored into every policy decision. I can bring climate expertise into the Forum together with an understanding of business.\n\nLabour’s policies should be based on solidarity – fighting poverty and oppression at home and abroad. The brutal occupations of Ukraine and Palestine must both be condemned in the strongest terms and a consistent approach adopted when responding to countries that break international law.\n\nDuring my time as a CLP Secretary I learned that information is key to engaging members and inspiring activity – I commit to keeping members well informed if elected.\n\nI’m proud to be supported by the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance and Momentum and urge you to support Sangita Patel, Fianna Hornby, Evangeline Walker and Antonia Shipley (youth position).\n\nSam Corcoran\n\nMembership Number\n\nA020225\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nIn 2011 I fought the “unwinnable” seat of Sandbach Heath and East and won by 6 votes.\n\nNow the seat has a Labour majority of 140 and I am the first ever Labour Leader of Cheshire East Council. I am passionate about tackling climate change and in May 2019, under my leadership, the council committed to being carbon neutral by 2025 and has a detailed Carbon Neutral Action Plan.\n\nI believe in fairness and putting people before profit- that’s why I’m a Labour and Co-op councillor. I want to put those values into practice in developing Labour policies.\n\nI went to the best school in the country (Manchester Grammar School) and the best university in the world (Oxford). I paid no university tuition fees and received a government grant to cover my living expenses. I want others to have the opportunities that I have had.\n\nBy profession I am a chartered accountant and fellow of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, so I also have the technical expertise of dealing with tax policy and analysing legislation.\n\nPlease also vote for Connor Dwyer, Nathalie Nicholas and Claire Reid\n\nContact [email protected]\n\nTwitter @CllrSam\n\nFacebook CllrSam\n\nMobile number 07960 248553\n\nConnor Dwyer\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1342067\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nAs we look to put country first and enter government, it is vital our policy represents the needs of ordinary people across the whole country.\n\nI work in higher education and have experience working in further education and population policy. Through experience, I have a keen interest in local government services, and a personal interest in rail and energy policy.\n\nI grew up in a breadline single parent household. Social housing and council services prevented my homelessness as a child and helped me through my education. I understand the importance of public services, local government and a supported state education system for opportunity and quality of life. I want my experiences and expertise to help bring informed policy discussion on education, public services, and local government to the party.\n\nI have been a campaigning Labour member for 9 years, working in Council and Parliamentary elections and by-elections across the country, and in 2023 gained Sharoe Green on Preston City Council for Labour aged 24. I’m proud to be an active member of UNISON and the Co-operative Party. It would be my honour to serve the North West on the NPF. Please also nominate Sam Corcoran, Nathalie Nicholas & Claire Reid.\n\nFianna Hornby\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1330132\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m the proud Councillor for Gorse Hill and Cornbrook in Trafford – home to the first planned industrial estate in the world. Representing a ward with such great industrial heritage has only cemented my belief that the UK needs a Green New Deal to both address environmental challenges we face and ensure unionised Green jobs to support a just transition.\n\nAfter growing up in Preston and seeing the area flourish, I’ve taken inspiration from the socialist council leadership there. They have put Community Wealth Building at the heart of the Council. It’s been a pleasure to see more money staying embedded in the area. I believe these policies should be a key priority for a future Labour Government.\n\nI will do everything in my power to enable a Labour government. We then need to expand public ownership, secure better rights for workers, provide a decent education for all ages and incomes, protect our wonderful NHS, expand free childcare to support families and build more council housing across the UK.\n\nI am proud to be supported by the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance and Momentum and urge you to support John Bowden, Sangita Patel, Evangeline Walker and Antonia Shipley (youth position).\n\nGhislaine Moutima\n\nMembership Number\n\nL3123623\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nMy name Ghislaine Moutima for Government Labour party candidate nominated for this ; I’ come to teg we jobs the hand changed their own needs in we country Britain is very helpful country like youngest older children or disability people that Labour party candidate nominated needs to take advantage to their needs ; vote Labour party to make You happy with finances NHS Because we’re just to transform we country and take that in we hand.\n\nNathalie Nicholas\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0116079\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI am seeking your vote to serve as one of your NPF representatives for another term. I served on the National Policy Forum (NPF) for 2022-2023 on the Public Services that work from the start of the policy commission. I had the opportunity to work with other Labour members and union representatives on the Labour work plan. As a nurse with over 22 years of experience, I shared my knowledge and skills as an NPF representative to help contribute to the Labour Party policies and manifesto. I was invited to CLPs meetings in the Northwest and shared information on our work in the NPF. I believe policy development in the Labour Party must involve members, local parties, trade unions, socialist societies, elected representatives, and the wider community. Members should be able to help shape the Party’s policy agenda. Policymaking is one of the most critical things in the Labour Party; our policies should reflect the people, encompass social justice and social value to promote equity. I am a UNISON member and passionately believe we are stronger united and have a pivotal role in developing Labour Party policies. I would be delighted to receive your vote for National Policy Forum.\n\nPlease also vote Sam, Corcoran, Connor Dwyer and Claire Reid\n\nSangita Patel\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1750981\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’ve worked in local government for over 30 years, predominantly in Regeneration and Neighbourhood Services. I’ve collaborated with Councillors to allow for more local provision for adult education, enabling residents to confidently secure local jobs. Other projects include work on community safety, cohesion, climate change, and the Cost of Living. I’m now a councillor serving as Assistant Executive Member for Culture.\n\nI’m CLP Policy Officer and have been the Election Agent for my ward Councillor. I am also Chair of the Friends of Waterloo Park and Centre where I have supported award-winning projects on climate change and activities to help residents with the cost of living.\n\nI’d use my experience, which enables me to identify gaps in services, to influence a prospective Labour government to deliver progressive change. The Cost of Living and Climate Crises, as well as dilapidated public services, are damaging our communities so we must use this opportunity to restore faith in our residents; a Labour government cannot allow people to be choosing between heating and eating.\n\nI’m proud to be supported by the Centre- Left Grassroots Alliance and Momentum and urge you to support John Bowden, Fianna Hornby, Evangeline Walker and Antonia Shipley (Youth Position).\n\nClaire Reid\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0046816\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nThere has never been a more vital time to make sure Labour Party policy is based on both social justice and financial integrity.\n\nWe as members, Trade Unionists, Councillors and MPs are facing the fight of our lives at the next General Election, and one that could see us have a Labour Prime Minister for the first time in nearly two decades.\n\nMy 14 years (and counting!) as Labour Councillor for Denton South has showed me how much our communities desperately need the change that only a Labour Government can bring.\n\nWe have one chance to put forward a manifesto that is both steeped in the fairness that I know us members so passionately defend, but one than can also see Keir Starmer elected to Downing Street.\n\nFor the past two years I have relished the opportunity to help do exactly this as one of your North West CLP reps on the National Policy Forum.\n\nI would be honoured to continue to represent you through this crucial process and would be delighted to again receive your vote for NPF Representative.\n\nPlease also vote for Sam Corcoran, Connor Dwyer and Nathalie Nicholas.\n\nCathy Reynolds\n\nMembership Number\n\nA111671\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI believe that this country needs a strong Labour Government with a cohesive policy agenda which delivers the fair and equal society which we all want to see. I was a Strategic Policy Manager in Local Government for over 20 years so have a great deal of policy development experience to offer the party through the National Policy Forum. The big issues facing the country, climate change, the state of the economy, the cost of living and the wealth gap need clear policy directions which work together to deliver workable solutions across the board. Public Services are broken, kept going by the dedicated work of the millions of public employees, and the economy is in tatters. Fixing it all, within a tight fiscal envelope, will need big solutions which make the most of every available penny of public money. We will need to put people before profit.\n\nI am not part of any faction within the party but will provide an unbiased assessment of all policy suggestions.\n\nI was the Parliamentary candidate, in Eddisbury, in 2017, doubling the vote for Labour in what was a safe Tory constituency.\n\nI am currently Chair of Chester South and Eddisbury CLP.\n\nLeighton Sealeaf\n\nMembership Number\n\nL3120113\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nEvangeline Walker\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1965535\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI joined the Labour Party because I wanted to help build a movement that develops bold solutions to the issues facing the country.\n\nIn my CLP, I regularly contribute to discussions on the key policy challenges with a particular interest in housing and equalities. At meetings of our Women’s Branch, I’ve heard from women from all walks of life who’ve fought injustice and misogyny, and learned from their campaigns fighting against these issues. Chairing my university Labour Club has provided me with the organisation and communication skills required for the NPF.\n\nAs a committed member of Unite, I’ve stood on picket lines alongside striking workers: if elected, I’ll be uncompromising in my support for our policy offer for workers and in particular, delivering the New Deal for Working People in full. In government, we must also ensure a fair green transition and revitalised public services.\n\nIf elected, I will always put members first, ensuring that they’re able to hold me accountable. It would be a privilege to represent you on the NPF.\n\nI’m proud to be supported by Momentum and the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance and urge you to support Sangita Patel, Fianna Hornby, John Bowden and Antonia Shipley (youth position).\n\nJohn Wiseman\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0023586\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nAs a Labour activist for over 25 years, I have held the positions of CLP Chair, Secretary, Vice-Chair One and Two, TULO officer, and many more. As a local councillor for over six years, I was able to take part in the scruitiny process as well as represent my community as a local Governor of three schools. As a chair of scruitiny as well as the Labour group for my council and the Liverpool City Region Transport Committee, I was seen as a leader, facilitating policy discussions. As an active member of Unite’s National Political Committee, I believe trade unions must be at the centre of activity and policy making in the party. Also as a former member of the National Policy Forum, I have contributed to policy ahead of elections. As a regional executive/board member of the party in the North West for many years I have dealt with the positives and negatives of democracy. Overall I feel we need representatives that listen and deliver for their members. I promise to communicate on regular basis encourage more diversity in representation in all levels in our party and overall be accountable. Be wise, nominate and vote for John Wiseman\n\nHannah Cousins\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1424316\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nOn the NPF, I hope to promote member democracy, push for transformative socialist policies and ensure Labour in government enacts meaningful, long-lasting change.\n\nI’ve been active in the Labour Party for 9 years; mobilising and empowering young members as CLP Youth Officer, organising canvassing sessions as campaign co-ordinator and currently as my local branch chair.\n\nAs a committed trade unionist, serving as secretary for my Unite branch and previously Women’s Officer, I know how invaluable the link between the trade unions and Labour is. Having worked in the hospitality and transport industries and witnessing how our rights at work have been eroded under this Conservative government, it is crucial that an incoming Labour government delivers a New Deal for Working People and a Green Transition; pushing for these will be my top priorities.\n\nIt’s vital for CLPs across the region to be engaged with and contributing to our policy forum, and to be updated regularly by their representatives. I’ll always be accessible and transparent if I am elected.\n\nI’m proud to be supported by Momentum and the Centre-Left Grassroots Alliance (CLGA). Please also nominate and vote for Samantha Townsend, Dave Ray, Rochelle Charlton-Laine and Joshua Freestone (Youth Position).\n\nLuke Henman\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0106437\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI’m a passionate Labour and trade union activist with a track record of formulating policy in our region.\n\nI joined Labour at 16 and have campaigned hard for our candidates at all levels, including as a Party organiser and, as volunteer campaign co-ordinator in Middlesbrough, leading the award-winning campaign which won back the Mayor’s office in 2023.\n\nI’m an active trade unionist, having worked as a regional official for UNISON. I’ve seen what the Tories have done to public services; the scale of what needs fixing is huge and we need to make sure our Party has the policies to meet that challenge.\n\nI’ve worked at the heart of local government in our region as Mayoral advisor in Middlesbrough – developing policies that deliver on our shared values. I currently work in the social housing sector. I would bring all this experience to the NPF.\n\nOur region was central to past Labour Governments – and should be again. Our members have insights and ideas that will form a winning policy platform and build a better Britain – I’ll make sure their views are represented.\n\nPlease also support Georgia Jamieson, Michael Mordey and Melanie Morley, with Jacob Cousens for Youth Rep.\n\nGeorgia Jamieson\n\nMembership Number\n\nL0090604\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI joined Labour and the GMB as a teenager, actively campaigning for Labour across the UK. As an NPF youth representative between 2008-2011, I advocated for mandatory pay audits in the public and private sector; votes at 16 and an equalised minimum wage which would have ensured equal pay for equal work.\n\nI’ve worked in construction and services sectors to promote better opportunities for apprentices, and with educators, trade bodies and businesses to encourage more young girls to pursue STEM qualifications and careers. I’ve led internal colleague networks to improve maternity policies, and pursued changes in policy and attitudes to enable LGBT+ colleagues to be 100% themselves at work. In financial services, I’ve advocated to improve local, regional and national infrastructure to improve connectivity, productivity and job opportunities across the North.\n\nLabour must win the General Election to tackle the cost of living crisis caused by 14 years of chaotic Conservative government. The NPF’s work over the last 4 years will deliver a manifesto that will lead us to win in the polls. We must stay focused on developing policies for Labour’s second term to transform communities across the UK.\n\nPlease also nominate Michael Mordey, Luke Henman and Michelle Morley.\n\nRochelle Laine\n\nMembership Number\n\nL1210405\n\nCandidate Statement\n\nI have witnessed first-hand many atrocities within the education system as a teacher under this tory government. I’ve been on strike to demand better pay and conditions and I give my full support to those in similar circumstances.\n\nAs a county councillor, I’ve fought to support our poorest families that are being left behind; to bring them with us, we need a more equitable distribution of wealth. I also ensure wide, transparent communication in my role as labour Group Communications & Engagement Officer.\n\nIn the past two years as an NPF rep, I’ve helped shape policies to ensure better public provision of dental care and stronger support for SEN students; I hope a Labour government will go even further.\n\nI hold myself and others accountable whilst evaluating how best to move forward successfully, because I believe listening to grassroots voices should be central to any worthwhile policy development.
