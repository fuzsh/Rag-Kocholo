        "text": "My research interests converge at the intersections of mobility, organisation and politics. In this context I consider the role of transnational mobilities, from activists to tourists, in the formation of a global social question with a focus on the way slums are becoming destinations of a range of better-off travelers, in solidarity and volunteer travel and in slum tourism.\n\nIn the project Lockdown Stories, I have collaborated with community tourism providers and local heritage projects in favelas in Rio de Janeiro to respond to a significant drop in numbers of tourists visiting their projects since Covid-19. Lockdown Stories has resulted in a virtual tourism platform, helping to move some of their tourism provision online. The project was funded by Research England Global Challenges Research Fund.\n\nThe project continued with my new AHRC Research Network Grant with a focus of Local Heritage and Sustainability: promote reflection and sharing within and across communities with partners in Brazil, Mozambique and Malaysia.\n\nCurrently this work is continued in Virtual School Trips, bringing virtual favela experiences to UK class rooms\n\nIn 2012 I received a Marie Curie Post-Doctoral Fellowship from the EU for a two-year research project on slum tourism, conducted at the University of Potsdam, Germany. Prior to this I won an early career grant from the University of the West of England to study tourism in Rio de Janeiro’s favelas and to initiate the foundation of a slum tourism research network. I co-organised the first conference in this field of research in December 2010 at UWE. This led to the publication of a special issue on slum tourism in the journal tourism geographies and a book I edited on the same topic. In May 2014 I hosted the second slum tourism network conference in Potsdam and I am co-editor of two special issues emerging from the conference publications.\n\nIn my second empirical research field I study the ways in which social movements organise themselves in response to place and space with a particular interest in the organisational form of the protest camp. Since 2018 I have benefitted from various funds for research on the role of protest camps at the G-20 in Hamburg, which has led to a number of publications. I collaborated with the research network ‘Mapping G20’ which published a widely shared report on the G20 events.\n\nI am currently writing a new edition of my jointly authored book on protest camps as an organisational form (with Zed books) in collaboration with Anna Feigenbaum (Bournemouth University) and Patrick McCurdy (Ottawa University). I have taken part in the foundation of the protest camp research network. In the framework of the network, I have recently co-edited the book ‘Protest Camps in International Perspective’ (Policy Press). I am also one of the founders of the protest camp research collective.\n\nTheoretically my work converges around the concept of valorisation, and in particular diverse voluntary practices that contribute to the valorisation of places and ideas. Bridging my empirical interests, the concept of valorisation also informs my research of urban regeneration, with a focus on work in Johannesburg, Rio de Janeiro and Bristol, UK"
