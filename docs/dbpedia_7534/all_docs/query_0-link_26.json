        "text": "PURPOSE\n\nDespite decreases in overall smoking rates in the United States, populations of low socioeconomic status (SES) still have a high smoking prevalence compared to high SES groups.1 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 41.4% of adults over age twenty-five with a General Education Diploma (GED) and 22% with less than a high school diploma smoked cigarettes, compared to 5.6% with graduate degree.2 Not only are low SES populations more likely to smoke,3 but they also have higher levels of nicotine dependence.4 Low SES populations are equally likely to make quit attempts as higher SES populations, but they are less successful.2,5–7\n\nThere are probable reasons why low SES populations face greater barriers to quitting smoking that can be directly or indirectly linked to the experience of living in a low socioeconomic environment. For example, prior research provides evidence that compared to higher SES populations, low SES populations are exposed to more pro-smoking social norms,8 have relatively lower self-efficacy for quitting,4,9 are more likely to initiate smoking at a younger age,10 and report more negative affect and stress in their everyday life,11 all of which can affect quitting success.\n\nAn individual’s smoking behavior is reinforced by several mechanisms. A transdisciplinary framework by Unger et al. (2003) explains this occurrence as complex and multidimensional.12 The dimensions can act synergistically or attenuate each other to influence the tobacco use of an individual. For example, a genetic predisposition to smoking may not matter if strong laws are in place to deny youth access to tobacco. On the other hand, an adolescent whose friends pressure him or her to smoke may initiate smoking, even with a lack of a genetic predisposition. Several of these dimensions may loom larger for low SES individuals compared to high SES individuals. Individuals with less socioeconomic advantage might be exposed to more tobacco advertising and fewer smoke-free policies (or policies that are not adequately enforced).8,13–15\n\nThere is evidence that pro-tobacco social norms and pressures in low SES populations may be more intense and contribute to smoking prevalence disparities. In a qualitative study on the social context of smoking, the low SES participants were more likely to report a lack of restrictions on smoking at work, and less likely to report that smoking while walking in public was inappropriate.8 Additionally, if smoking is the norm within a group of friends, someone who quits smoking may be socially excluded.16 Christakis and Fowler (2008) found that “decisions to quit smoking are not made solely by isolated persons, but rather they reflect choices made by groups of people connected to each other both directly and indirectly at up to three degrees of separation”.17\n\nTo our knowledge, the relationship between specific perceived barriers to quitting and subsequent likelihood of quitting smoking in young adults has not previously been studied. Understanding the role that barriers play in quitting smoking for low SES populations is important because alleviation of these barriers could lead to more successful quit attempts, and in turn, decrease smoking disparities. A one-size-fits-all approach to tobacco cessation may not be effective, and exploring more targeted cessation options could prove beneficial. Targeted smoking cessation interventions for young adults are especially important because young adulthood is when life-long addictions to nicotine are most likely to be established, and quitting before age 30 reduces more than 97% of the lifelong health hazards attributable to smoking.18\n\nThe aims of this study were 1) to explore how self-reported barriers to quitting vary by SES among young-adult smokers, and 2) to examine how these reported barriers relate to quitting one year later. The low SES group consisted of participants whose parents had a high school degree (or equivalent) or less education, and the high SES group consisted of participants with at least one parent who had attended at least some college. It was hypothesized that the barriers to quitting smoking would vary by SES, with the low SES group reporting more barriers. Specifically, we expected that cost of quit aids/programs and friends’ smoking would play a bigger role in barriers to quitting for participants from low SES populations. We also hypothesized that barriers to quitting would be associated with subsequent quitting behavior one year later, and that this relationship would vary by SES, with barriers hindering quitting among low-SES more than higher SES individuals.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAlthough the low SES young adults in this study had higher prevalence of most (5/6) of the barriers compared to the high SES group, only one of the barriers (risk of gaining weight) was statistically associated with SES. These results are different from findings in prior studies that reported barriers to quitting smoking as more common among low SES populations in other age groups, i.e. social barriers,8 more negative affect,11 and greater nicotine dependence.4 A systematic review published in 2014 identified perceived barriers to smoking cessation among six vulnerable groups, one of which was low SES. Barriers common to all vulnerable groups in this review were similar to the barriers examined in our study: smoking for stress management, acceptability of smoking in their community, and lack of support from health providers.20 The lack of associations in our sample may suggest that perceived barriers are more similar between SES groups among young-adults than they are among all adults.\n\nIn our sample, those with a low socioeconomic status had 1.38 times higher prevalence of concern about weight gain as a barrier to quitting compared to those with a higher socioeconomic status. In general, research shows that children become aware that smoking is used for weight-control at an early age,21 and weight concerns among young adults is associated with higher likelihood of smoking.22 Body image and body weight concerns are complex factors for young-adult smokers.23 Although low-SES adolescents are more likely to be overweight,24 the research findings on weight-concerns and SES are mixed, with some finding no association between weight-concerns and SES in adolescents,25 and other findings indicating fewer weight-concerns among low-SES groups.26 However, these studies did not look at smokers specifically. Thus, it is possible that young-adult low-SES smokers have different experiences and concerns with weight-related issues than the general population.\n\nIt was surprising that the cost of quit aids as a barrier was not more common among the low SES group than the high SES group; however, it is possible that financial difficulties are a concern for all young adults regardless of SES, given that young adults in this age range (17–24) are often full-time students or living with their parents and not financially self-sufficient. Additionally, a study by Curry et al. found that young-adult smokers are about half as likely to use pharmacotherapy as adult smokers.27 So it may be that they aren’t considering pharmacotherapy at all. Lack of statistical significance in our data may be because there are real differences in the prevalence of the barriers, but they are too small to be detected with the sample size available for this analysis, or it may be that there truly is no difference, and these barriers affect young adults from low and high SES groups similarly.\n\nAs for the association between perceived barriers and quitting success, the results differed from the authors’ hypotheses. There were no statistically significant relationships between the perceived barriers to quitting among young-adult smokers and quitting status one year later. These findings are inconsistent with research on similar topics, but there have not been articles published on our particular topic before. It may be that there are other factors playing a role in these associations, such as nicotine dependence. In this sample, participants who quit smoking smoked approximately 3 CPD fewer in Wave One than those who continued to smoke. CPD as a covariate was consistently significantly related to the likelihood of quitting. Consequently, it is possible that young adults who have a harder time quitting are more addicted, and regardless of the barriers they perceive, addiction might be the key predictor of quitting for this age-group. Unfortunately, this study did not collect information on nicotine dependence. Further studies should examine how dependence affects the relationship between barriers to quitting smoking and quitting outcomes for young adults. It is also possible that most reported barriers individually do not accurately predict probability of quitting smoking for young adults, and it might be more appropriate to assess barrier combinations rather than individual barriers.\n\nThere are a few important limitations to note when interpreting the results of this study. First, it is unclear how accurately participants can report barriers that they feel affect them. Additionally, the barriers that the participants could choose from were pre-defined, and developed by the investigators of MACC. Consequently, these questions were not from a validated survey. Quitting was defined as smoking zero days out of the past thirty at the time of the survey; however, it is possible some participants may have relapsed shortly after the survey. Lastly, SES is a very complex construct, and using the parents’ educational attainment may not fully represent the true SES of the participants. Education is just a piece of SES, and is often also combined with income and occupation. However, parents’ income and occupation(s) were not collected in MACC. Even if the barriers to quitting smoking are equally distributed between SES groups, there is a possibility that they are harder to overcome for the low SES populations. This idea was not tested in the current analyses, but is an important possibility to keep in mind when interpreting the results. The generalizability of these data to more racially diverse populations and different geographic locations is limited due to the relatively homogenous white population of participants from Minnesota and a few comparison states in the Midwestern United States.\n\nTo the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to look at the relationship between young adults’ self-reported barriers to quitting smoking and the likelihood of short-term smoking abstinence one year later, while taking SES into account. There is a need for additional research to improve smoking interventions for young adults, as evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments for this population are underutilized27 and underdeveloped28.\n\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that, other than the risk of gaining weight, several perceived barriers to quitting smoking (i.e. cost of aid, friends’ smoking, perceived dependence, and smoking for coping with stress) may be similar between low SES and high SES groups of young adults. Additionally, our study did not find any associations between self-reported barriers to quitting and the probability of quitting smoking short-term. Rather, the only covariate that was consistently related to quitting was the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Thus, it is possible that perceived barriers may not actually be important factors in the cessation process for young adults, and may not vary between low and high SES groups in this age-range. More research is needed to verify these findings, and to further explore the role that nicotine dependence plays in quitting at this young age. This knowledge could lead to more targeted cessation interventions and more successful quit attempts for young adults."
