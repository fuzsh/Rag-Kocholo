        "text": "The San Jose Sharks made a great decision signing a pure goalscorer in Tyler Toffoli.\n\nSan Jose was desperate for goalscorers after last season's 181 total team goals, which put them in 31st place in the league. Their goal differential was a league-worst -150. Fabian Zetterlund had a terrific year and scored a career-high 24 goals.\n\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\nToffoli scored 33 goals between the New Jersey Devils and Winnipeg Jets, more than any Sharks player has scored in a single season on the current roster except Logan Couture's 34-goal season in 2017-18.\n\nWilliam Eklund had 45 points last season, and his 29 assists were second to Mikael Granlund. With Toffoli in the mix, Eklund has a better option to pass to. That is not to slight the other players on the Sharks roster, but Toffoli has proven he can score goals consistently.\n\nBringing in Toffoli also adds a Stanley Cup Champion to the Sharks' roster. He knows what it takes to play in the playoffs and win the Cup. With such a young roster that sports one of the best prospect pools in the NHL, players like Macklin Celebrini and Will Smith can lean on Toffoli for advice and offensive support.\n\nRelated: Tyler Toffoli & Macklin Celebrini Have Something In Common; It's Not That They Are Both Sharks\n\nThe puck hasn't dropped yet for the 2024-25 season, but on paper, the Sharks got a lot better with the addition of Toffoli.\n\nRecent Sharks News\n\nSharks 2nd-Round Pick Leaves Russia Early, Signs ELC\n\nFormer Sharks Forward Leaves NHL, Signs In Russia\n\nRangers' Chris Kreider Didn't Expect To Lose Barclay Goodrow As Teammate\n\nFormer Sharks Head Coach Joins Team Canada At Four Nations Face-Off\n\nBREAKING: Full Schedule Of 2024 NHL Rookie Faceoff\n\n'I Couldn't Be More Excited To Get Back On The Ice': Sharks' Bret Hedican Joins Ducks In Player Development Role"
