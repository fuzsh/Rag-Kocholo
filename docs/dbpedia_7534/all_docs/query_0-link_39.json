        "text": "Fueled by an intrinsic sense of curiosity and a passion for learning, my dream growing up was to be a history teacher. As a native of Atlantic City, New Jersey, when I was diagnosed with Chroneâs disease I had to take a left turn, changing my path and learning how to heal myself through food. Today, I am in remission and have spent my culinary career working and staging at some of the best restaurants in the country and around the globe. From Thailand, to Paris to New York City, I have used my experiences to start a private chef and cooking class company, Culinary Breakdown at the age of 24 and am now the Owner and Chef of MIDA restaurant in Bostonâs trendy South End neighborhood, MIDA Newton and APIZZA. As the only Black, chef-owned restaurant in Boston, I continue to find ways to put my passion for story-telling and teaching to use by building bridges in the community through food and conversation. I live in Jamaica Plain, MA with my wife, Debra and twin boys, Raffa and Lev.\n\nDr. Pinder-Amaker is an AssociateProfessor at Harvard Medical School who lectures and conducts workshops throughout the country on strengthening continuity of care, bolstering communication between campus- and community-based systems, eliminating barriers to mental health treatment, and supporting students who hold marginalized identities.

Mary started her education career as a middle school teacher in New York City and also worked in the Chelsea public schools where she was part of a team that designed a competency-based high school program. Mary resides in Roslindale and is the proud parent of two BPS graduates, one of whom is now a BPS dual language teacher. She has a bachelor's degree in Biology and Art from Cornell University and a masterâs degree in Math and Science Education from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.\n\nSusan earned her B.A. in political science at The University of Georgia, and later studied art and art history at MassArt and the SMFA here in Boston. Originally from Virginia, she spent many years working in real estate there. She moved to Boston in 2005 and worked as an associate at Serenella Boston. She sought ways to get to know her new community and to give back, and feels very fortunate to have connected with Steppingstone over a decade ago. Susan later joined the Board of Ambassadors, which only grew her enthusiasm for the organization. Susan lives in Newton with her husband and their three children. She has been involved in a variety of different organizations in the area and further afield including Hill House Boston, Ministry of Hope, Boston Childrenâs Hospital, Pine Street Inn and The Friends of the Public Garden, and works avidly to support service work through her childrenâs schools.\n\nTodd Bland joined the Board of Directors in 2012.

Todd earned his M.Ed. from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2001 and his BA from Bowdoin College in 1990. Todd is inspired to be a member of the Board of Directors because of the extraordinary Scholars, their families and the leadership, faculty and staff.
