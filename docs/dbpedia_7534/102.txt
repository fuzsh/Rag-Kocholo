Episode notes

In this episode, the Economy and Finance Network respond to the Chancellor's Spring Statement that was announced last month.

In the face of rising energy bills, a cost of living crisis and families facing the worst financial damage since records began, does this mini-budget go far enough to address the damage and alleviate the squeeze that households are facing? Dom, Chris, Rosie and Leo from the Young Fabians Economy and Finance Network share their thoughts on the Spring Statement as well as what they felt was missing.
