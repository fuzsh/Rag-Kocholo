        "text": "American college students David Kessler and Jack Goodman on a walking tour of Britain are attacked by a werewolf that none of the locals will admit exists. Jack dies. David recovers in a hospital, where he has nightmares.\n\nLandis attempts to take advantage of the subtle line between horror and humor and play with our defense mechanism of laughing at uncomfortable things. The result is unapologetically uneven, though equally effective at scaring you as it is at making you laugh.\n\nThe film launched Turner's career. The film was the directorial debut of Kasdan, screenwriter of Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Body Heat was a commercial success. Produced on a budget of $9 million, it grossed $24 million domestic.\n\nEmerging in the twilight of the New Hollywood years, Cutter's Way sees a practically bygone knack in American film for setting mood, evoking place and exploring unpredictable states of mind through a knowing, cynical, claustrophobic script, awash in the disgruntlement and mental cave-in of post-Vietnam America.\n\nIt's compelling to build a plot like this at a studious tread, rather than rushing head on through it. It gives us time to weigh the character of the Needle, and to contemplate his exceptionally scant, mysterious allusions to what he feels versus what he thinks.\n\nSeveral actual station employees at the film's location, WNEW-TV in New York, now known as WNYW Fox 5, cameo'd in the film. Producer-director Peter Yates and screenwriter Steve Tesich had collaborated two years earlier on the film Breaking Away.\n\nAfter a bizarre and near deadly encounter with a serial killer, a television newswoman is sent to a remote mountain resort whose residents may not be what they seem.\n\nThe Howling is like the Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill of horror movies, playing its own creative variations on a classic old-hat plot device, engulfing us with reminiscences of other movies and media like it and at the same time giving it a real-world edge.\n\nNighthawks is known for its production problems, re-editing of the film by Universal and Stallone for different reasons, and the rough working relationship between Stallone and Hauer. The movie was a commercial disappointment, but it received positive reviews, except for some which criticized the grandstanding, harebrained heroics that would be come prototypical of this era.\n\nA federal marshal stationed at a mining colony on the Jupiter moon of Io uncovers a drug-smuggling conspiracy. He gets no help from the workers or authorities when he finds himself marked for murder.\n\nPeter Hyams adapts High Noon to a futuristic outer space environment. Outland endured many comparisons to Alien, released two years earlier, most notably in its dark, claustrophobic and isolated neo-industrial deep space, and sinister and ruthless mega-corps. The movie was nominated for a Best Sound Oscar.\n\nSpielberg wrote and produced, but had a clause in his contract to prevent him directing another movie while he made E.T. Tobe Hooper was hired based on his work on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's the first and most successful entry in the Poltergeist series.\n\nCarpenter considers The Thing to be the first part of his Apocalypse Trilogy, followed by Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness. The lower-than-expected performance has been attributed to E.T. and Blade Runner releasing around the same time. It has since gone on to gain a cult following and is even considered by some to be one of the greatest horror films ever made. It spawned a novelization, a comic book miniseries, a video game sequel and a prequel film with the same title.\n\nSet in '78, the plot follows a sentient automobile named Christine, who wreaks havoc on its teenaged owner. Stephen King's novel originally depicted the car being possessed by the evil spirit of its previous owner, whereas Carpenter's film shows the evil spirit as present from the beginning.\n\nAnother Stephen King adaptation, only in this one, there is no good or evil. Just the indifferent forces of nature. Terribly sad, it revolves around a mother and son who, through a series of indirect circumstances, find themselves trapped inside a broken-down Pinto by a rabid St. Bernard. As excruciating as it is to watch the suffering and deterioration of the title pooch, there's no denying that the culmination to and moments of his attack are extremely intense, primarily thanks to well above-average work by cast, camera and cutting.\n\nSlasher films were in their heyday, and this god-awful one is largely known for its twist ending, which is considered by some to be one of the most shocking endings among horror films. What it really is is one of the dumbest.\n\nDe Palma's thoroughly unsubtle homage to Rear Window and Vertigo, Body DOuble was largely dismissed by some and even denounced outright by others. De Palma earned a Razzie nomination. Only Melanie Griffith received rave reviews, earning a National Society of Film Critics Award, a Golden Globe nomination and the Booker's Club called her \"Star of Tomorrow.\"\n\nTeenager Nancy Thompson must uncover the dark truth concealed by her parents after she and her friends become targets of the spirit of a serial killer with a bladed glove in their dreams, in which if they die, it kills them in real life.\n\nCraven produced it on a budget it earned back during its first week, let alone being met with rave critical reviews and spawning a franchise consisting of a line of sequels, a TV series, a Friday the 13th crossover and a remake. It's credited with carrying on many tropes found in low-budget horror films of the time, including the morality play that revolves around teenage promiscuity resulting in their death, leading to the term \"slasher film.\" Oh, and it was Johnny Depp's silver screen debut.\n\nThe Terminator, a cyborg assassin from the future, attempts to find and kill Sarah Connor, a waitress who is destined to give birth to a man who will save humankind from extinction.\n\nGiven that the world can take this movie completely for granted now, one can forget how gradually Cameron unravels what's happening with the two nude men who emerge one night from a torrent of voltage. The sharp-witted strokes characterizing Sarah, making her so authentic that we viscerally crave her survival until he can bother to show us just why we should be particularly concerned.\n\nPleases the Dirty Harry sensibility, but it's ambitious in a different way than those movies. It's still scarce even now for a foremost male star, especially a manly action hero, to star in a straight cop thriller in which the story pivots on his capability to understand and defer to a woman. Eastwood may have broken the bank making Dirty Harry movies, but he also kept changing and exploring, and that makes him one of the most remarkable of the box-office megastars.\n\n\"Fright Night\" sees a teenager believing that the newcomer in his neighborhood is a vampire. He turns to an actor in a television hosted horror movie show for help to deal with the undead."
