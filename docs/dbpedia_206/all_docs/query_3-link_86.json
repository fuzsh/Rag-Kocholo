        "text": "Lock the doors and check under the bed — you're going to need all the help you can get after reading these very scary and very real ghost stories.\n\nEven if you don't believe in supernatural occurrences, you might change your mind after learning about these real-life experiences of ordinary people who claim to have experienced extraordinary events.\n\nFrom ghostly incidents to mysterious encounters, we've collected a list of ghost stories so terrifying, you'll be sleeping with the lights on ... indefinitely.\n\nTo help curate our collection, TODAY.com spoke to paranormal experts and other knowledgeable sources on the subject, including Derek Hayes, host of “Monsters Among Us,” a podcast in which callers share details of mysterious encounters.\n\nAccording to Hayes, the show receives hundreds of calls each week and submissions from across the globe. “But every once in a while, somebody will call in one of those personal stories. It’s that personal connection for me that really brings it home,” Hayes tells TODAY.com. “And some of those are just terrifying.”\n\nWe've included some of Hayes' favorites, along with a variety of other ghost stories that we think you'll find fascinating, including haunted houses, jails and reported experiences with the spirit world among other unexplained phenomena.\n\nWhether you believe in ghosts or not, well, that's up to you. One thing is for sure, however, by the time you're done reading these creepy yarns, you're going to need a bigger flashlight.\n\nThe ‘grandmas’ in the cemetery\n\nJeff, a resident of Dayton, Ohio, was driving with his 3-year-old son, Miles, in the back seat, when they passed by a modest cemetery decorated with only flowers and small plaques.\n\n“It basically looks like a giant garden,” Jeff explains on the podcast “Monsters Among Us.”\n\nAccording to Jeff, as they drove by, his toddler, who’d been happily singing, abruptly stopped, pointed to the cemetery and exclaimed, “Look at all those people!”\n\nJeff turned to look, but didn’t see a soul. Confused, he asked Miles what he was talking about. “All those people over there,” his son replied. “There sure are a lot of grandmas.”\n\nAs Jeff tells it, chills ran down his spine as he asked his son what the people were doing. “They’re all standing there, looking down at the grass,” Miles said.\n\nCompletely unsettled by the conversation, Jeff sped up and drove home. Later that same day, he says his young son was watching TV when he turned to Jeff and said, “You know … they weren’t alive.”\n\nThinking Miles was referring to the cartoon, Jeff asked what he meant. “Those people we saw ... they were all paused,” his son replied.\n\n“I don’t know if my kid has the sixth sense,” Jeff says. “Or if he just has a wild imagination.”\n\nThe ghost of The Stanley Hotel\n\nThe Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, has been around for more than 100 years and was built as a posh getaway for the wealthy seeking solitude in the mountains.\n\nAs the years passed, however, occupancy declined, and by the 1970s, the grand hotel had fallen into disrepair. It was around that time that famed author Stephen King spent the night there and was inspired to write the book “The Shining.”\n\nThe book and blockbuster film helped return the Stanley to its former glory. Now, guests come in droves to see the hotel that inspired one of the scariest horror movies of all time.\n\nGiven its history, it should come as no surprise that many visitors report strange happenings. Aware of the ghostly rumors, Texas resident Henry Yau booked a last-minute getaway in April of 2016 to “check it out.”\n\nAfter arriving, Yau had dinner, then wandered around the Stanley to take photos. Stopping at the staircase, he waited for people to clear the area, then took a picture, thinking nothing of it.\n\nLater that night, however, Yau fell seriously ill. “I felt really sick, I had the shivers, I was like, something’s really wrong,” he tells TODAY.com. His companion suggested he go to the emergency room, but Yau refused.\n\nOn the trip home, Yau began swiping through the photos he’d taken when he discovered what he said was a “really, really strange image” of someone standing on the stairs.\n\nExcept no one had been there.\n\nThe next day, he posted the photo on Instagram, half-joking that he’d captured a ghost — and the world took notice. Almost overnight, Yau found himself in the limelight with his ghost picture warranting attention from global media outlets and paranormal experts who wanted to examine the photo.\n\n“Some experts say that there’s two ghosts, and other people said that the reason I got sick is because the ghost was trying to materialize, taking energy out of me,” he said. “There’s so many theories about this.”\n\nAnd what does Yau think? “I have no idea,” he says with a laugh.\n\nThe Whaley House hauntings\n\nIf there’s no such thing as ghosts, then explain the supernatural incidents at San Diego’s Whaley House, a destination dubbed “America’s most haunted house.”\n\n“I have definitely been present when people claim they hear things, smell things and, in some cases, even see apparitions,” says Victor Santana, operations manager at The Whaley House and Museum.\n\nWidely-known for its unexplained occurrences, the historical house was built in 1856 by Thomas Whaley, a former New Yorker who came West during the Gold Rush. It's quite possible Whaley got a sweet deal on the land given it was once home to the San Diego gallows, a place where countless criminals were executed.\n\nThough he doesn't know exactly how many people died at the site, Santana says one prisoner stands out.\n\n“Yankee Jim Robinson was executed on site after he stole a boat,” says the Whaley House manager. “Legend says that Thomas Whaley was actually a witness to that execution.”\n\nWhether it's true or not, Santana says that Whaley reported haunted happenings in his home in the years that followed, citing heavy footsteps going up and down the stairs while he worked in his office.\n\n“He would also sometimes hear a man grunting, if you will, and he would attribute that to Yankee Jim Robinson,” he says.\n\nAfter dying of natural causes, Whaley is said to have become a ghost himself at the house, with some visitors claiming to smell the cigars he enjoyed smoking. “Or you might even see him at the top of the staircase looking down on you,” says Santana.\n\nOther mysterious occurrences at The Whaley House include the unexplained scent of lavender in the air, attributed to Whaley's wife's perfume, as well as possible ghosts of the Whaley family's pets.\n\n“You might feel something brushing up against your leg, even licking your leg in some cases. And they believe that's the family dog,” says Santana.\n\nHas Santana ever actually seen an apparition there?\n\n\"I have never seen a ghost,\" he confirms. However, he has had a couple of odd experiences, including seeing a doll that seemingly appeared to move on its own once and occasionally he's heard a women's voice crying late night at night.\n\nSantana was also present during a paranormal investigation at the site in which an EVP (electronic voice recorder used by investigators), picked up something utterly spine-chilling.\n\n“You set up a recorder and you ask questions (like), ‘Is anybody in the room with us? What is your name?’ So, one of the questions was, ‘Are you happy that we are here with you tonight?’” explains Santana.\n\n“And when you play back the recording, you hear somebody say, ‘No.’”\n\nThe ghost truck stop\n\nOn his way to get married, a military man and his best man set off on an 800-mile road trip from Camp Lejeune in North Carolina to Lafayette, Indiana.\n\nIt was 1 a.m. on a cold January night in 2014 and the man tells “Monsters Among Us” that the weather was bad and temperatures were in “the negative double digits.”\n\nAs the pair closed in on Indianapolis, they discovered they had no money to pay for gas to refuel the car and were about to run out.\n\n“Growing up in the trucking industry with my dad, I decided to stop at a truck stop,” the man explained. But because the main interstates were shut down due to the weather, they had get off the highway and search for a truck stop along the back roads instead.\n\n“(We) found a smaller truck stop. It had one truck and it was just kind of strange. It was just a blacked out truck with a blacked out trailer. There was no real markings on it, nothing distinguishable,” he says.\n\nThey went in, hoping a clerk or waitress would spot them a few dollars for gas enough to make it to Indianapolis, at which time they'd go to the bank, take out cash and pay back the loan.\n\nInside they found a tidy diner, occupied by a waitress, cook and a lone truck driver.\n\n“I went inside, talked to this driver and he bought us a cup of coffee. We sat there and talked for about 30 minutes about what was going on and where we were headed, and he gave us 20 bucks for gas. I went outside, pumped our gas, came back in and I told him, ‘Hey, I really appreciate it. I'll be back.’”\n\nMaking good on his word, the man got cash from the bank upon arriving in Indianapolis and returned to the diner.\n\n“When we arrived at about 10 o’clock in the morning, it's boarded up,” he says. “It looked like it’s been abandoned for years and the truck’s gone. But we had just been in there.”\n\nThey pulled in anyway and found a police officer parked in the lot. They explained what happened just hours before to which the cop chuckled and replied, “Oh, you met the ghost of three.”\n\n“So, two military members converse, had a cup of coffee with, interacted with, three people at a diner that had a fuel pump. I got $20 worth of gas,\" says the man. \"When I came back, it been boarded up for, if I remember correctly, the cop said it had been boarded up for the last 25 years.”\n\nThe hauntings at the Lizzie Borden House\n\nOn August 4, 1892, Andrew and his wife, Abby Borden, were found brutally murdered in their Fall River, Massachusetts, home. Though murder wasn’t uncommon in the late 1800s, the fact that they were bludgeoned to death with an ax and the main suspect was their 32-year-old daughter, Lizzie Borden, certainly was.\n\nThe crime and trial that followed made headlines around the world. Lizzie was ultimately acquitted of murder, but she remains forever linked to the heinous killings, as does the home where the crime was committed.\n\nNow a bed-and-breakfast and museum, the Borden home attracts history buffs and thrill-seekers who come to see for themselves if rumors that the house is haunted are, indeed, true.\n\n“When I started working here, it was more of the history. I really didn’t care about the paranormal,” Suzanne St. John, a realtor and tour guide at the Lizzie Borden House, tells TODAY.com.\n\nHowever, that all changed after St. John says she experienced a few unusual happenings of her own.\n\n“Guests tell us they hear laughing and playing in the middle of the night, things get moved around,” she says. And St. John has experienced a few unusual things herself, saying that once she discovered toys scattered across a room that no one had been in.\n\nSt. John also talks of a picture that fell over and slid two feet across the floor without any plausible explanation, as well as a closet door that once opened on its own volition.\n\nOn the eve of the anniversary of Andrew and Abby’s murder, St. John says that she and two other tour guides at the house felt a sudden sharp, piercing pain in their left eyes — the same exact location of Andrew Borden’s fatal injuries.\n\nPerhaps the most unsettling, however, is the story St. John tells of a tour guide at the Lizzie Borden house who asked her group to silence their cell phones before beginning the tour. Moments later, a guest’s cell phone rang. She looked up and said, “It’s my mom.”\n\nThe tour guide asked if she wanted to leave and take the call, to which the woman replied: “She died two years ago.”\n\nThe ghost of Captain Joseph White\n\nThough Salem, Massachusetts is best known for its infamous witch trials, there have been plenty of other chilling stories throughout its 400-year history.\n\nOne of them is the tale of Captain Joseph White, a wealthy merchant who was found bludgeoned to death in his bed.\n\nIt was a crime motivated by money, according to Giovanni Alabiso, owner and tour guide at Salem Historical Tours, who says the 82-year-old merchant was allegedly targeted by greedy brothers hoping to get their hands on his will.\n\nBrothers Joseph and Francis Knapp enlisted the help of Richard Crowninshield to help get the job done. “Late in the evening, when Captain White is asleep, Dick Crowninshield comes in, he goes upstairs to the second floor and takes a club and bashes the captain over the head and crushes his skull,” Alabiso tells TODAY.com.\n\nThe murder resulted in a scandalous trial and is said to be the inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Tell-Tale Heart,” as well as the game “Clue.”\n\nWhether it’s the brutal nature of the crime or revenge for the attempt to steal his money, the spirit of Captain Joseph White is said to still wander the halls of his former home. “People believe Captain White is roaming around that house, protecting whatever treasure he reportedly has,” Alabiso said.\n\nTourists take photos of the house, and despite being empty, many pictures reveal shadowy figures (both male and female) in the windows and on the landing of the Gardner-Pingree House.\n\nWho are they? No one knows.\n\n“It’s definitely, absolutely active,” Alabiso says.\n\nThe haunted ventriloquist doll\n\nWhen Marty was a child back in the '90s, she tells \"Monsters Among Us\" that she was a fan of ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his dummy sidekick, Charlie McCarthy.\n\nShe says that when her father came across a ventriloquist doll as he wandered through a small magic shop located outside of Santa Rosa, California, he decided to buy it for her birthday.\n\nWhile ringing up the sale, Marty says the cashier gave her father \"weird vibes\" and said to him: \"You know when you put your hand inside the doll, he's going to come alive.\"\n\nLaughing off the comment, he brought the dummy home to his daughter.\n\nAccording to Marty, she was over the moon when he dad gave her the doll, saying: “I was so happy when I got that doll, I was obsessed.”\n\nBut before long, strange things began happening. Though impossible because the doll's head was made of hard plastic, she says its expression would change, including his smile.\n\nWorried something would happen to her precious dummy, Marty's family shut it away in a cupboard most nights. One night, she and her family were awakened by the \"pitter patter\" of steps in their living room. Thinking it was the dog or another family member, they went to look.\n\nNo one was there. Except for the doll, who was sitting on the couch.\n\n\"We remember specifically we always put it away because I loved that doll so much that I took care of it,\" Marty says on the podcast.\n\nOther strange occurrences began happening. While Marty and her dad were away, her uncle was alone in the house. The uncle says he heard Marty's father calling his name from the living room, even though he wasn't home.\n\nWhen he went to look? He found the doll, once again, sitting on the couch. And no one else.\n\n\"All of our family was pretty much scared of the doll,\" Marty says. \"People would start hearing their names being called, and we would hear walking at night. So, we just decided we needed to get rid of it.\"\n\nBeing Mexican and religious, Marty says her parents wanted to burn the doll in case it was demonic. They put it on the grill and, according to Marty, it wouldn't burn. \"This doll would not go up in flames, at all, whatsoever.\"\n\nThey tried cutting it up with a knife, but were unsuccessful. Finally, they threw it in the trash can. After the garbage was collected, Marty's dad went to retrieve the bin.\n\nIn it? The doll.\n\nTo rid themselves of the dummy, they dug a hole in the backyard, then filled it with cement.\n\nMarty and family have long-since moved away, but she says they still think about the doll and the possibility that eventually \"it finds one of us.\"\n\nThe imaginary 'friend'\n\nJacqueline from Oklahoma says that while her memories have faded over the years, she recalls having an imaginary friend when she was young.\n\nHer grandparents, “Granny Junie” and “Pa Hank,” lived in a small home with a quiet backyard. Jacqueline recalls visiting them as a child.\n\n\"I have very good memories of my Pa Hank,\" Jacqueline says on the podcast “Monsters Among Us.”\n\n\"He would sit under the tree with me and tell me stories.\" The stories were often about his life and memories of prohibition, she says. “He was actually a very interesting character.”\n\nThe only problem? Her grandfather died in 1981 — and Jacqueline was born in 1982.\n\n“I don't think I ever realized that I was getting stories from a ghost,\" she says, adding that the rest of her family knew of his presence in the house. \"My Granny Junie would never stay in the house on the anniversary of his death,” she says. \"He did die in the house.\"\n\nJacqueline also recalls hearing Pa Hank get up in the middle of the night when she was staying at the house. “It never occurred to me that these were memories of an entity,” she said.\n\nIn hindsight, Jacqueline says that even though her childhood “imaginary friend” was actually her dead grandfather, it casts a different light because it was a relative and not a stranger.\n\n“It never felt like ghosts, it felt like talking to my Pa Hank.”\n\nThe kidnapping ghost\n\nOn “Monsters Among Us,” a caller named Joe tells of moving to Georgia from California in the late 1990s. Soon after, he says his brother followed him to the Peach State and rented an old house built in the 1800s.\n\n\"It looked nice from the outside ... it did not feel good from the inside,\" Joe says during the podcast.\n\nAccording to Joe, things seemed off from the moment he helped his brother move into the home. \"I walked into the house and went, 'Oh, man.' The hair stood up on the back of my neck, and I just felt ill-at-ease, like this place isn't cool at all,\" he says.\n\nMoments later, while carrying items into the bedroom, Joe says he heard whispering.\n\n\"A heated whispering, almost an argument, between two people that seemed to be hovering in the top of the ceiling area of the room,\" he adds.\n\nJoe ran out of the room and asked his brother if he'd felt something off about the house, too. His brother had picked up on the vibe, but assured Joe that things would be alright.\n\n\"As long as you're good,\" Joe says he told his brother. \"I'm not good, but I'm going to help you. I'm going home and I probably won't come back here.\"\n\nAnd, sure enough, Joe's brother began experiencing unusual occurrences in the house.\n\nThe most alarming, however, was when Joe says his young niece was found wandering alone on a busy road with her hand up in the air.\n\nPolice and other agencies were called to investigate the incident and when asked, his brother's 4-year-old explained that she'd gone for a stroll with the “old lady that lives here.”\n\n“She just wanted to go for a walk, so we went for a walk.”\n\nGiven that the front door was too heavy for a 4-year-old to open by herself, no one could understand how she was able to leave the house.\n\nAccording to Joe, his niece said, “The old lady opened the door, then we petted the dog for a little bit, then went for a walk.”\n\n\"She was so genuine and honest at 4 years old, that he couldn't call her liar,\" Joe says during the podcast.\n\nSoon after, his brother moved and never returned.\n\nThe ghosts of Stone’s Public House\n\nConsidered one of the most haunted restaurants in America, Stone’s Public House in Ashland, Massachusetts, doesn’t have a ghost problem — it has a ghosts problem.\n\nJanet Morazzini, a longtime resident of Ashland, is the bartender and manager of Stone's Public House, which was built by John Stone back in 1832.\n\nAccording to Morazzini, even before she began working at the inn, she heard stories of the ghost of a young boy roaming the halls of the restaurant, which once served as an ad hoc hospital during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918.\n\nIt makes sense, Morazzini tells TODAY.com. “That’s where they would quarantine all the sick people,” she explains. “Apparently, quite a few souls have passed just due to that.”\n\nThe inn is also the site for other untimely deaths, including that of a young girl who was struck and killed by a train while she played near the railroad tracks bordering the property.\n\nAccording to Morazzini, a father and son visiting the inn stepped outside the restaurant to watch the trains. After coming back inside, Morazzini overheard the father reassuring his young son that there wasn't anyone else outside — despite the son insisting he'd seen a little girl sitting beside them.\n\n“He’s like, ‘She was sitting right next to me. She was crying. You didn’t see the little girl?’ And the dad said, ‘There was nobody there, it was just me and you, buddy,'\" Morazzini recalls.\n\nOther ghosts are said to haunt the old inn, including that of proprietor, John Stone, who Morazzini says didn’t actually die there, but is believed to be “watching over” the place.\n\nOne night when Morazzini was alone at the inn, she says she heard footsteps walking directly above her on the second floor. “I was just like, there is no explanation for that whatsoever. I’m leaving,\" she tells TODAY.com.\n\nStill, she doesn’t believe that the spirits have bad intentions. “I’ve never had that scary, hair-on-the-back-of-your-neck-gotta-get-out-of-the-building feeling there.\"\n\nThe unexpected passenger\n\nIn the 1990s, Julie, a resident of Portland, Oregon, was driving out the city to meet with friends when she found herself in traffic. The 18-year-old soon discovered that the cause of the slowdown was due to a dreadful car crash and to her horror, as she passed the scene, she realized that someone had died.\n\nA moment later, “there was a woman sitting in my passenger seat.” Julie says on “Monsters Among Us.”\n\nThough she admits it sounds crazy, Julie reports seeing a woman dressed in work clothes seated next to her. And despite being in complete shock, the woman in the passenger seat was even more freaked out. “She looked like somebody who just suddenly ended up in somebody else’s car,” Julie says of the incident.\n\nPanicked, the woman demanded to know how she got there and who Julie was. It was then that Julie noticed the woman had an unearthly quality about her and realized that whoever she’d passed on the side of the road was somehow in the car with her.\n\n“'Ma’am, you need to calm down, my name is Julie and I’m here to help,’” she says she told the stranger. Julie later went on to explain to the woman that she’d been in a car accident and somehow ended up in her passenger seat. The woman was stricken.\n\nAt that exact minute, they passed a clearing in the trees. With some encouragement from Julie, the woman peacefully looked toward the sun, then disappeared.\n\nIn completely disbelief, Julie pulled over and convinced herself she’d imagined the whole thing. Several days later, however, a story came on the news about a trucker injured in a car accident.\n\n“Before they finished, they threw a picture up of the woman that was in my car and explained that she had passed away in the accident,” Julie says during the podcast. “It was unbelievable, it was too much.”\n\nThe ghost in the choir loft\n\nAlicia Diozzi, teacher, tour guide and owner of Salem Kids Tours, typically sticks to talking about Salem, Massachusetts' long and diverse history.\n\nHowever, there’s one story she likes to share about a ghost that haunts First Church in Salem. The plot twist? Only children can see it.\n\n“The little ones, maybe age 4 or 5, will ask about a ghostly presence that they see up in the choir loft in the main sanctuary of our church,” she tells TODAY.com.\n\nAccording to Diozzi, kids often point to the same spot in the church and claim they see a woman there.\n\n“The kids will say she’s in a long dress, long-sleeves, and that she sometimes can be heard singing with the choir,\" Diozzi says.\n\nTales of the choir ghost have been circulating since the 1960s, says Diozzi. And she might have dismissed them had her own son not pointed to loft 15 years ago and asked about \"the lady who sings with the choir.\"\n\nWas she chilled?\n\n“Yes, definitely,” Diozzi says. “I feel like the main sanctuary at First Church has that feeling, you do kind of feel the presence of the past.”\n\nIt’s not a bad feeling she says, but rather a history or energy that’s comforting in a way.\n\nThe ghosts of 'Shawshank' penitentiary\n\nThe Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio is widely known for being the location of the classic movie, “The Shawshank Redemption.”\n\nBut the old penitentiary, which was shut down in 1990, also has a reputation for being haunted.\n\nHome to some of the most hardened criminals, the maximum-security prison was once the site of murders, suicides and other violent encounters, according to Theresa Argie, author and paranormal investigator known as “The Haunted Housewife.\"\n\n“(The reformatory) had this incredible vein of violence that ran through it almost from the beginning,\" Argie tells TODAY.com.\n\n“You can imagine why a place like that would be haunted,” she says. “There’s something negative there, you can just feel it in your bones.”\n\nAnd there are, in fact, plenty of ghost stories from the old prison.\n\n“We ran into female spirits there, which I thought was incredibly interesting,” Argie said. One of them, she says, is likely the wife of a former warden who was accidentally shot and killed while pulling a box down from a closet shelf.\n\nAccording to Argie, they've captured recordings of a woman crying and, on occasion, smelled rose perfume in the bedroom.\n\nAnother spirit that’s said to haunt the reformatory is a woman who sits in the prison chapel and cries. “When you approach this woman sitting in the pew, she disappears. Other people have seen her walking,\" Argie says.\n\nThen there's the malevolent presence there, according to Argie. And with the help of a medium, she says she communicated with it.\n\n“He would literally be cussing at me,” she recalled.\n\nWhile their sessions with the angry ghost were unnerving, it wasn’t until he followed Argie’s partner home that they were truly terrified.\n\n“One day, she saw him, through a reflection of her window, she saw this thing in the back, this shadow figure, and she knew it was him,\" Argie tells TODAY.com.\n\nAfter seeking the help of a paranormal expert, Argie says that “we haven't seen him since.”\n\nThe phantom ambulance lights\n\nIn the mid 1990s, Robert worked as paramedic in a small Texas town and tells the story of a “strange happening” that he and his partner experienced on a call one night.\n\nAfter receiving a call for a female having chest pains, he and his partner climbed in the ambulance to make their way to the address.\n\n“We took off Code 3, which means using our emergency lights and sirens,” Robert recalls.\n\nIn the absence of GPS back then, Robert says that they relied on maps and mailbox numbers to guide them to the rural location.\n\n“The address we were going to was a very rural one,” says Robert. “So, there was no street lights and it was a very dark night, so it was very difficult to read the mailboxes.”\n\nAs they searched for the correct driveway, Robert says he turned off the sirens. After determining they'd found it, they pulled in only to discover they were mistaken.\n\n\"So, we turned off the emergency lights as we backed up to the road and went up the correct driveway,\" he explains.\n\nUpon arriving at the scene, the paramedics realized that they'd been at the exact same address the month prior for a male suffering from cardiac arrest.\n\n\"In typical medical black-humor fashion, we mentioned to each other that this was probably the wife who was now having a heart attack and was now going to go join her husband.\"\n\nThey jumped from the ambulance, bags in tow, and began treating the woman, who, fortunately, ended up being alright. Robert says he sent his partner to get the stretcher from the ambulance so they could take her to hospital for evaluation.\n\n\"When he returned, he had this strange questioning look on his face,\" according to Robert. The pair wheeled the patient out to the emergency vehicle and that's when Robert saw that the ambulance \"had nearly every light it was equipped with turned on.\"\n\n\"Strobe lights, flood lights, some interior lights ... everything on.\"\n\nAfter taking the patient to the hospital, Robert asked his partner why he'd turned on all the lights.\n\nHe hadn't.\n\nIn fact, he reminded Robert that they'd shut them all off after going to the wrong address.\n\n\"Neither of us recall activating the emergency lights, strobes or flood lights when we arrived at the house. There was no real reason to do so, we'd already gotten there.\n\n“In the end, we wrote it off as her dead husband letting her know that he was still there.”\n\nThe ghost dog\n\nSarah, from Lancaster, Ohio, tells “Monsters Among Us” the story of her childhood dog, Cricket, who according to Sarah was a \"pretty unhappy dog.\"\n\n“She was super cranky, she only liked my grandma,” Sarah says. “She didn't seem like she felt well.”\n\nStill, the family loved their dog and was devastated when the pup ran out into the road and was struck and killed by a passing car as they were preparing to leave on a family vacation.\n\n\"It was very sad, very upsetting, especially with me being a child. My grandmother was there, she loved Cricket and Cricket loved her. They had this special relationship that none of us had.\"\n\nDespite the loss, the family had prepaid for their vacation, and not having a lot of money, decided to still go, leaving Cricket's body with an aunt who offered to take of the necessary details.\n\nUpon arriving at the hotel where they were staying, Sarah says the family was upset over the tragedy.\n\n“We go to bed, and in the middle of the night, I'm not sure why I woke up, but I startled, woke up, sat up in bed, and looked down, and on the floor was Cricket, a full-body apparition, of her,” says Sarah.\n\n\"She looked so happy, she looked like a different dog. She was jumping around. All that crankiness, all that unhappiness she had, was gone. It was like she was coming to tell me that she was OK. It was the clearest apparition. I've never seen an apparition again. It was the first and only time.\"\n\nSarah says she told her mother in the morning what she'd seen and her mom dismissed it as her middle-school brain just trying to make sense of the loss.\n\n\"I guess that's possible,\" says Sarah, \"but to this day, I can still envision Cricket in that moment. I've never forgotten that image and it helped me feel better about what had happened because she seemed so happy and I do think she was visiting me that night.\"\n\nThe ghosts of Willoughby Coal\n\nBuilt in the late 1800s, the Willoughby Coal building in Willoughby, Ohio, housed a variety of businesses in it's time, including a train depot, cheese factory and flour mill.\n\nIn 1912, it became the very prosperous Willoughby Coal, supplying coal to local residents before it was sold to Henry Windus and William “Don” Norris in the 1930s.\n\nOver time, the relationship between the two owners grew contentious, according to Theresa Argie. “Henry Windus wanted to buy the business from Don Norris, but Don was unwilling to sell,\" the paranormal investigator tells TODAY.com\n\nOne morning, Norris allegedly told his wife he was going out for bread and to check on repairs being done on the Willoughby building.\n\nHe never returned.\n\nSeveral hours later, his body was discovered in front of the door. “He was laying in a bloody heap,” Argie says.\n\nEven though his death was ultimately ruled accidental, Argie says that Norris' family believed he'd been murdered. Though no one knows what really happened that morning, Argie believes his spirit still haunts the building.\n\n“We have come in contact with him on many, many occasions,” she says and claims that others have reported seeing faces in the window and heard unexplained footsteps and other unusual occurrences at the building.\n\nBut Norris isn't alone.“We’ve probably got five or six resident spirits in the building.\"\n\nThe ghost nanny\n\nKip, a caller from New York state, talks of an old home that he and his wife purchased. Upon moving in, his wife invited her sister and newborn baby to come for a visit.\n\n“The stayed in the downstairs bedroom and my wife was sleeping in an upstairs bedroom,” Kip explains on \"Monsters Among Us,\" and says the first night their guests stayed, his wife overheard her sister talking to someone in the middle of the night.\n\nThe next morning, Kip’s wife asked who she’d been talking to and her sister replied, “I woke up in the middle of the night and there was an old lady standing over my baby and I had to tell her to get away.”\n\nAccording to Kip, there were more unexplained incidents in the house including mysteriously moving lamps and a creepy occurrence with a fire alarm that went off while his wife was outside working in their garden.\n\n“She immediately runs back into the house, figures out that it’s the smoke alarm in that same downstairs bedroom going off,” Kip says on the podcast. “When she opened the door, she said for a split second all she could see in the room was this white fog.”\n\nWithin moments, however, the white fog disappeared and the alarm shut off.\n\nConvinced the house was haunted, Kip’s wife reached out to a neighbor to learn more about the property and discovered that the previous owner was a 90-year-old woman who tragically died in a house fire.\n\n“Needless to say, we fixed up the house and got out of there as fast as we could and moved someplace else,\" says Kip."
