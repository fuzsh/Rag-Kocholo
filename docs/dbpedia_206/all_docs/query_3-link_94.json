        "text": "3T - 'Anything'\n\n3T - Anything (Official Music Video) HD Version\n\n'Anything' by 3T, released in 1996, was a smooth R&B hit that showcased the Jackson family's musical legacy.\n\nThe group, consisting of Tito Jackson's sons Taj, Taryll, and TJ, delivered silky harmonies reminiscent of their famous uncles. The track's catchy chorus and slick production helped it climb to number two on the UK charts.\n\nThe music video, featuring the lads serenading their love interests in a swanky mansion, became a staple on music channels.\n\n'Anything' proved that musical talent ran deep in the Jackson clan and remains a nostalgic favourite for '90s R&B fans. It's the kind of tune that still gets people swaying at retro nights.\n\nThe Beautiful South - 'A Little Time'\n\nThe Beautiful South - A Little Time (Official Video)\n\n'A Little Time' by The Beautiful South, released in 1990, was a brilliant showcase of the band's knack for blending catchy melodies with sharp, often cynical lyrics.\n\nThe song's duet format, featuring Paul Heaton and Briana Corrigan, tells the tale of a relationship breakdown from both perspectives. It's the sort of track that has you humming along before you realise you're singing about heartbreak.\n\nThe Beautiful South's 10 best songs, ranked\n\nThis tune gave The Beautiful South their first and only UK number one hit. The music video, showing a couple literally falling apart as they argued, won the band a BRIT Award for Best Video.\n\nDespite its commercial success, the band rarely played it live in later years. 'A Little Time' remains a perfect example of the group's ability to wrap serious themes in radio-friendly pop, a skill that made them one of the most successful British bands of the '90s.\n\nMr Big - 'To Be With You'\n\nMr. Big - To Be With You 4K Video\n\n'To Be With You' by Mr Big, which hit the airwaves in 1991, is a perfect example of how sometimes less is more in rock music.\n\nThis acoustic-driven power ballad became the band's biggest hit, topping charts in 15 countries. It's the kind of song that had lighters waving in arenas before mobile phones took over.\n\nFrontman Eric Martin wrote the basic structure of the song when he was just 16 or 17. The band's guitarist, Paul Gilbert, added the iconic \"wait\" vocal hook that opens the track.\n\nDespite being known for their technical prowess, Mr Big proved with 'To Be With You' that they could strip things back and still pack an emotional punch.\n\nJamiroquai - 'Virtual Insanity'\n\nJamiroquai - Virtual Insanity (Official Video)\n\n'Virtual Insanity' by Jamiroquai, released in 1996, is a funky slice of acid jazz that perfectly captured the zeitgeist of the late '90s. With its groovy bassline and Jay Kay's distinctive vocals, the track became an instant classic. It's the sort of song that still gets people up and dancing at parties today.\n\nThe music video, featuring Jay Kay dancing in a moving room, won four MTV Video Music Awards and is often cited as one of the best of all time.What many don't know is that the floor wasn't actually moving - it was the walls!\n\nThe song's lyrics, touching on themes of technology and environmental concerns, were oddly prescient. 'Virtual Insanity' helped propel Jamiroquai to international stardom and remains their signature tune.\n\nScorpions - 'Wind of Change'\n\nScorpions - Wind Of Change (Official Music Video)\n\n'Wind of Change' by Scorpions, released in 1991, became an anthem for the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War. This power ballad, with its iconic whistling intro, captured the spirit of hope and change sweeping across Europe at the time. It's the kind of song that gives you goosebumps, even if you weren't around when it first came out.\n\nThe track was inspired by the band's visit to Moscow in 1989, where they witnessed the political and social transformations firsthand. The CIA actually investigated whether the song was written as part of a Soviet propaganda campaign - it wasn't, by the way.\n\n'Wind of Change' topped charts in numerous countries and became one of the best-selling singles of all time. It's a rare example of a hard rock band creating a song that transcended genres to become a cultural touchstone.\n\nGabrielle - 'Dreams'\n\nGabrielle - Dreams\n\n'Dreams' by Gabrielle, released in 1993, was a debut single that made an immediate impact. With its smooth R&B sound and uplifting lyrics, it shot straight to number one in the UK charts.\n\nThe song's hook, sampling Tracy Chapman's 'Fast Car', adds a touch of familiarity that draws listeners in from the first note.\n\nGabrielle reveals her eye covering origins and how she inspired others with \"differences\"\n\nWhat many don't know is that Gabrielle wrote 'Dreams' while working as a sales assistant in a shop. She recorded the demo in her bedroom, never expecting it to become such a massive hit. The track's success was all the more remarkable given that Gabrielle was a relative unknown at the time.\n\n'Dreams' went on to become one of the defining songs of the '90s British R&B scene, its message of hope and perseverance resonating with audiences then and now.\n\nThe Connells - '74-75'\n\nThe Connells - '74-'75 (Official HD Music Video)\n\n'ʼ74-'75' by The Connells, released in 1993, is a wistful indie rock gem that gained unexpected success in Europe. The song's nostalgic lyrics and melodic guitar work struck a chord with listeners, despite the band's relatively low profile.\n\nIt's the kind of track that makes you pause and reflect, even if you're hearing it for the first time.\n\nWhile '74-'75' reached number one in several European countries, it barely made a dent in the US charts. The music video, featuring then-and-now photos of the band's high school classmates, added an extra layer of poignancy to the song's themes of passing time and missed opportunities.\n\nDespite being their biggest hit, The Connells never quite reached the same heights again, making '74-'75' a true one-hit wonder of the '90s. It remains a beloved track for those who remember it\n\nEagle Eye Cherry - 'Save Tonight'\n\nEagle-Eye Cherry - Save Tonight\n\nEagle Eye Cherry burst onto the scene in 1997, with this song becoming an instant radio favourite. With its catchy acoustic guitar riff and sing-along chorus, it's the kind of track that gets stuck in your head for days. The song's bittersweet lyrics about savouring a final night together resonated with listeners worldwide.\n\nEagle Eye Cherry, son of jazz musician Don Cherry, actually wrote the song while housesitting for his sister, singer Neneh Cherry.\n\nThe music video, shot in black and white, shows Cherry playing multiple characters in a Stockholm apartment block. It's a clever visual representation of the song's theme of different perspectives.\n\n'Save Tonight' topped charts across Europe and became Cherry's breakout hit. While he never quite matched its success, the song remains a beloved '90s classic.\n\nHanson - 'Mmmbop'\n\nHanson - MMMBop (Official Music Video)\n\n'MMMBop' by Hanson, released in 1997, took the world by storm with its infectious pop melody and youthful energy.\n\nThe song, written by the three brothers themselves, became a global phenomenon, topping charts in 27 countries.
