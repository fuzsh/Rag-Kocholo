        "meta_description": "A list of 318 films compiled on Letterboxd, including DuckTales: The Movie – Treasure of the Lost Lamp (1990), Edward Scissorhands (1990), Ghost (1990), Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) and Home Alone (1990). About this list: I do not recommend a vast majority of these films. In fact, a good 80-90% of these are anywhere from bad to terrible. But this list is operating purely on nostalgia when it comes to being a kid who spent their first decade of life from 1990-1999; and is meant to showcase the movies that were put it front of our eyes that decade. Being a 90s kid was weird. Parents were sometimes picky and obeyed the MPAA guideline, but many parents also didn’t really give a crap. Not many will have been able to watch the R-rated horror films or comedies on this list, but for those of us who weren’t sheltered - and potentially traumatized or desensitized in equal measure - here’s an epic canon of every film I could think of that was rented at the local Movie Gallery or Blockbuster to babysit us on the weekends (where it’s okay for “American Pie” to be sandwiched between “Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein” and “Baby Geniuses”).
