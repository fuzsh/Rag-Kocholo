        "text": "Cube Critics Jacob Aloi and Regina Medina discuss a comic book movie that is by fans for fans and super insider and a noir-ish mystery comedy.\n\nThe following are capsule reviews edited from the audio heard using the player above.\n\n‘Deadpool and Wolverine’\n\n“Deadpool and Wolverine” marks a notable entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, being both the third installment in the Deadpool series and also its debut within the MCU following Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox.\n\nThis brings Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), into a broader cinematic context alongside Hugh Jackman’s iconic Wolverine.\n\nHere, the duo traverses the multiverse in a quest to save Deadpool’s timeline, a plot rich with the trademark humor and fourth-wall-breaking antics expected from the “Merc with a Mouth.” The film pays homage to the ‘90s and early 2000s Marvel movies like the original “Daredevil” and the “X-Men” series.\n\nIt’s a must-watch for fans of the comic books and those who hold a special place for the superhero films of the early 2000s.\n\n— Jacob Aloi\n\n‘Sunny’\n\n“Sunny,” starring Rashida Jones, is a compelling new series on Apple TV+ that belies its cheerful title with a plunge into darker, more complex themes. Set against a backdrop that combines the neon-lit aesthetic of “Blade Runner” with the gritty underworld dynamics of “The Sopranos,” the show delivers a richly textured narrative.\n\nJones portrays Suzie, an American woman navigating life in Kyoto after the deaths of her Japanese husband and son. Suzie receives a robot named Sunny, designed by her late husband's company.\n\nTogether with Mixxy, a bartender, Susie looks into a mystery surrounding her husband’s secretive past. The series offers suspenseful detective work as well as a thoughtful exploration of Japanese cultural practices related to mourning and honor.\n\n— Regina Medina"
