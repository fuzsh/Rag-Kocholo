        "text": "We love all kinds of horror movies. Some people might hear \"horror\" and think first about classic monsters of the genre—zombies, Frankenstein's monster, vampires, etc—and that's all good and dandy. Others might jump to the slasher pool—big, scary bad guys like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers picking off unsuspecting victims and scream queens one by one—those are damn awesome too. But perhaps the most unheralded but deeply-loved subgenre of the horror world are the psychological horrors; movies that don't necessarily have a supernatural monster or happening at their core (though sometimes they also do!) but mostly focus on some sort of slow, methodical unraveling of a mind.\n\nThese stories can happen just about anywhere. Sometimes, it can be in the backdrop of a criminal investigation, a hunt for a killer or suspect. Other times, it can be in a city. It can be at home, or at a ballet recital, or in the midst of aging—these stories, really can happen to any and everyone. And, really, that's the whole point; not only are our characters feeling disconnected from reality, but so, too, are we the viewers. And at the end of the day, we're the ones really getting our brains fucked.\n\nSome of the best movies you'll ever see fall into this genre. Can you imagine a world without Stanley Kubrick's The Shining? A masterpiece that basically shaped the landscape that made way for what's been the last 40+ years of great horror movies (and included a quasi-sequel in Doctor Sleep from director Mike Flanagan). And there's more where that comes from. Blumhouse, the production company behind movies like Get Out and Happy Death Day almost exclusively makes movies that either explicitly or tangentially fit into this group.\n\nBut we digress—too much talk about the future when there's already a ton of great psychological horror films for you to watch right now. So without further ado, here's the best of the bunch."
