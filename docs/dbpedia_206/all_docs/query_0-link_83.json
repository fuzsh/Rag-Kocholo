Alick is passionate about preserving his native language and reviving cultural traditions through his art and dance, He has been working putting together a language book and aims to have it published by early 2025.\n\nAlick has promoted his culture through art & dance nationally and internally for over 20 years. His artworks are held in major institution collections such as the British Museum, Monaco Oceanographic Museum, Cambridge Museum of Anthropology & Archaeology, National Maritime Museum of Australia, National Art Gallery of Australia and the National Museum of Australia.\n\nAlick has influenced a whole generation of young emerging Torres Strait artists and has significantly revived the art of mask making in the Torres Strait. He believes that art and science are the two most important practices all first nation people should embrace. Art to keep the cultural fire burning and Science to learn about caring for country into the future of global warming and climate change.\n\nHis most iconic artwork presentation was when his work was put on the roof top of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco in 2016. His latest work will be displayed very soon on two Queensland rescue helicopters highlighting environmental themes such as climate change and marine conservation.\n\nAlick brings to life his artwork through cultural Torres Strait songs and dance. the first team he founded (Zugubal Dancers 2012-2016) has performed in many places internationally from the U.K to France to Monaco and throughout the Pacific. His most powerful performance was a traditional ritual in 2015 behind closed doors when the Zugubal dancers performed for Torres Strait turtle shell masks (artefacts) collected in the late nineteenth century and were on display at the Cambridge University/Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology.\n\nIn 2021, Alick with his wife and four children established their new dance team called Dhamuw Koedal. in a short time, they have performed in festivals such as the Winds of Zenadth cultural festival (WoZcf23) on Thursday Island, Melanesian Arts & Cultural festival (MACfest23) in Vanuatu, Cook Islands, National Art Gallery of Singapore and Art Gallery of NSW.

This is currently streaming on Stan.\n\nDespite his significant contributions towards caring for country, preservation of language and culture, Alick’s family feels that he is not given the recognition he deserves as a cultural leader and ambassador.\n\nAlick is a very spiritual person and acknowledges that his task as a cultural leader in this life is to continue to collect firwood and placing them in the fire lit by his ancestor and to keep that home cultural fire burning for the next generation of Zenadh Kes Islanders.\n\nAlick believes that, if one wishes to learn their traditional cultural language and is not in a language speaking environment, then one must turn to songs and dance. This will allow them to embrace their culture proper strong especially in the midst of the unknown technology world ahead.\n\nHe continues to education the young people to firstly understand their identity by knowing their Totems, Stars, and Winds. From these three elements, they will be more Loud and Proud as a first nation culture.\n\nThis is the world of Koey Zugub - Alick Tipoti.\n\nNaarah\n\n2024\n\nCreative Talent Award\n\nNaarah is a Gija woman from the Kimberly who grew up in lutruwita/Tasmania.

For almost 20 years, WETT has supported a range of partnerships and programs that align with Warlpiri education priorities in Yuendumu, Willowra, Nyirrpi and Lajamanu. So far, WETT has invested more than $53 million to support yapa (Warlpiri people) across its five education program areas:\n\nChildren and families supports Warlpiri governance and staff in early childhood services in Yuendumu and delivers a playgroup in Willowra in partnership with World Vision Australia\n\nLanguage and culture in schools supports communities to maintain culture by funding school country visits, Warlpiri language curriculum development and wages for elders to teach in the classroom and on country\n\nYouth development delivers out-of-school literacy activities for youth in partnership with World Vision Australia and diversionary youth programs through the Central Australia Youth Link Up Service (CAYLUS)\n\nSecondary school support funds interstate excursions for school students and students away at boarding school\n\nLearning community centres promote adult learning and literacy for work, life and wellbeing. The centres partner with Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education (BIITE) in Willowra, Nyirrpi and Lajamanu. They serve as classrooms, libraries, internet cafés, cultural archives and service hubs\n\nWETT is a Warlpiri-controlled and governed initiative administered through the Central Land Council (CLC).\n\nThe WETT advisory committee comprising four Warlpiri representatives from the four communities, along with one each from Newmont and the CLC, plays a crucial role in designing, planning, and monitoring WETT-funded initiatives. This committee, which meets at least three times a year, advises the directors of the Kurra Aboriginal Corporation, whose members are traditional owners of the mine site. The Kurra directors, guided by this advice, allocate funding to the WETT programs.\n\nMany of the founding members of WETT are still on the WETT advisory committee today and are taking innovative measures to support new and younger members to join the committee and grow into these important roles. WETT's commitment to developing strong governance, careful succession planning, and life-long learning was acknowledged when it received the prestigious Indigenous Governance Award in the non-incorporated category in 2018. In more recent years, WETT has developed an innovative monitoring and evaluation approach, the Yitakimaninjaku, warrirninjaku, payirninjaku manu pina-jarrinjaku (YWPP) ‘Tracking and learning’ program, through which local Warlpiri researches monitor WETT’s programs. The YWPP approach prioritises capturing and amplifying the voices of Warlpiri youth.\n\nWETT’s vision is for Warlpiri people to be strong in their knowledge of culture, country and language, to stand up for Warlpiri communities today and be strong role models for generations to come:\n\n“Our language, culture and decisions will be respected. Our voices will be heard. We will have the same opportunities as everyone else. Our children will be confident, knowledgeable, disciplined, healthy and respected. They will have good roles and jobs, as will the generations to come.”\n\nTui Nolan\n\n2024\n\nInnovation Award\n\nA proud Gudjal man, who grew up in Sydney, New South Wales, Tui Nolan has dedicated the past nine years of his career to advancing machine learning models.\n\nTui completed a Master of Science and a PhD in Statistics at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).

She has also acted as an ACT honorary ambassador.\n\nAs is her door, the gate to Aunty Matilda’s country has always been open to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is reflected in her support of the 1992 Mabo decision and the 1996 Wik decision where Aunty Matilda supported the families and celebrated with them, the iconic victories. Aunty Matilda is vocal supporter for the inclusion of Torres Islander peoples and culture.\n\nIn 1997, Aunty Dr Matilda’s involvement in Indigenous Affairs led to her delivering the Welcome to Country at Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation's ‘Sea of Hands’ installation, and contributing to the Bringing Them Home report into the Stolen Generations.\n\nAunty Dr Matilda has conducted the Welcome to Country Ceremony protocol for many significant events such as the opening of the Tjabal Centre at the ANU, opening of the Ngunnawal Student Centre at the University of Canberra in 1990, Nelson Mandela’s visit to Australia in 1990, and the Dalai Lama’s visit in 1992.\n\nIn 2006, Aunty Dr Matilda was named Canberra Citizen of the Year by ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope MLA.

Since then, Aunty Matilda has opened the 43rd, 44th and 47th Parliament of Australia. During her opening of the 47th Parliament of Australia, robed in her iconic possum skin cloak, and supported by her family, she passed down the responsibility to her son, Paul Girrawah House – to carry on this cultural tradition into the future.\n\nIn 2017, Aunty Dr Matilda’s lifelong commitment to her community was recognised by the ANU, with the conferral of the Degree of Doctor. In the little spare time she has in her ‘retirement’, Aunty Dr Matilda also illustrates children’s books. This has included the Tales of Ngambri History series, that are now circulated in ACT schools and painted works that have been in exhibitions. Dr House-Williams shares and promotes an understanding and respect for Ngambri, Wallabalooa and Wiradyuri cultures through education. She has also been enjoying spending her ‘down time’ time making traditional possum skin cloaks.\n\nAunty Dr Matilda continues to work tirelessly in her community, providing advice, mentorship and support to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who ask. Those who know her personally vouch that she does not rest and continues to work for First Nations Peoples without any days off. Aunty Dr Matilda opens her heart, her home and Country to all community who need her.\n\nDespite the adversity and challenges that she endured for being born into a generation that didn’t accept her, Dr Matilda House-Williams faced these head on, blazing new trails in the process. Aunty Matilda is a proud, strong, kind, yet fierce Blak Matriarch, who has created a legacy by forging new pathways for First Nations Women and our Mobs more broadly.\n\nDaniel Motlop\n\n2023\n\nInnovation Award\n\nDaniel Motlop is a Larrakia man from Darwin, Northern Territory who now calls Kaurna Country home, in Adelaide, South Australia. Growing up in Darwin, Daniel learned to appreciate the natural abundance around him learning to identify bush apples, billy goat plum, native passionfruit and to hunt for magpie goose and barra. After a long and successful career as a professional AFL player for Port Adelaide Power and North Melbourne, Daniel has shifted his focus to Indigenous social enterprise in the food and beverage industry.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and General Manager of Something Wild Australia, alongside his brothers Steven, Shannon and their father Eddie. Something Wild are an Indigenous food and beverage company who specialise in game meats and native greens and are at the forefront of supplying Indigenous foods to restaurants and consumer around Australia. Additionally, Something Wild have built strong relationships with Indigenous communities which allows them to promote and supply unique produce from one of the world’s oldest cultures. Not only does this provide Something Wild’s customers with the opportunity to experience products that celebrate Indigenous culture, it also provides positive opportunities and outcomes for many rural and remote Mob communities.\n\nOver the last six years, Daniel has innovated the way that native Australian ingredients are used in the mainstream food and wine industry. Through Something Wild, Daniel shares his extensive knowledge of unique Native ingredients including magpie goose, kangaroo, wild boar, green ants, native greens, herbs and spices, kakadu plums and bush apples. Something Wild were the first food business in Australia to acquire the permit to harvest and sell magpie goose from up north. Daniel has also developed and established the range of Something Wild’s consumer facing products, such as Seven Seasons Spirits and Native fruit flavoured yogurts. This has allowed for more of these uniquely Native Australian food ingredients to be introduced to mainstream Australian consumers. Daniel has also been involved in the establishment of a horticultural enterprise which develops methods of growing more mainstream native plants in greenhouses to allow for reliable harvest volumes and product specification. This innovation helps to ensure a more sustainable harvest.\n\nIn addition to working with native ingredients, Daniel has developed a community of First Nations harvesters which crucially allows for industry, and consequently economic development, to be established on country for the benefit of local Aboriginal people. Most ingredients are wild harvested and, Daniel provides job opportunities to First Nations people. This not only creates jobs but also keeps age-old traditions alive by introducing them to a new generation.\n\nDaniel says “We want to get to a stage where native ingredients are like regular fruit and veg.” Daniel believes that there’s space in every Australian household for ingredients that have sustainably nourished Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for thousands of years.\n\nAunty Dr Naomi Mayers OAM\n\n2023\n\nLifetime Achievement Award\n\nAunty Dr Naomi Mayers OAM, is a proud Yorta Yorta and Wiradjuri woman, born in 1941 on Erambie Mission, just outside of Cowra in country New South Wales.

Kelvin graduated from the University of New South Wales to become Australia's first Indigenous surgeon. He credits his mother, Grace Kinsella, a pioneering Indigenous registered nurse, for inspiring him and his older sisters, twins Marlene and Marilyn, to become doctors. Their father, Kong Cheok Seng, a Malaysian Chinese man, is also a doctor.\n\nProfessor Kong, now works on Awabakal and Worimi Country, and is associated with the University of Newcastle's School of Medicine and Public Health. He is an Otolaryngology, Head and Neck surgeon and a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS). Kelvin works at Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital and John Hunter Children’s Hospital, and he explains that hearing loss, often caused by Otitis Media (middle ear disease), significantly contributes to poor educational outcomes for children and can lead to higher unemployment rates in adults as a result. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children experience the highest levels of chronic otitis media in the world, affecting up to 70% of children in remote communities.\n\nDetermined to change the statistics, Dr Kong has dedicated his career to early intervention. Dr Kong says “If we can reduce the risk of hearing loss, we can have a direct impact on a child's ability to learn and develop. The change that we see is remarkable - we can take them from limited hearing and language skills to fully functioning teenagers with real employment prospects”.\n\nDr Kong is passionate about addressing the disparity in health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. Each year, he spends a portion of his time working in, and for, remote Indigenous communities providing access to quality healthcare that would otherwise be limited or completely unavailable. This includes visiting the Kimberley’s each year to perform specialist consultations and surgery.\n\nHe is also passionate about improving pathways into specialist medical training and improving Indigenous workforce across the health and research sector. Dr Kong mentors high school students to encourage more Indigenous people to consider careers in medicine and surgery.\n\nIn 2011, Dr Kong joined other medical practitioners in the Care for Kids' Ears campaign to address the ongoing issues experienced by remote communities. The campaign was designed to encourage communities to be empowered with resources and information about ear health to reduce the risk of ear disease and hearing loss. Dr Kong is passionate in his advocacy in which he centres the importance of working together as a community - \"When we work together with a community, we can address all the issues that arise from ear disease. Our job is to improve kids' health so they can get the education they need.\"\n\nSome of Dr Kong's many roles include:\n\nFirst ever identified Indigenous Fellow, and current Chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Committee for the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons’ (RACS).\n\nExaminer, Royal Australasian College Surgeons\n\nMentor Surgical Pathways for Indigenous Australians\n\nPublic and Private practice in Newcastle, at Hunter ENT Surgery\n\nProfessor and mentor at the University of Newcastle\n\nHonorary Professor Macquarie University\n\nAssociate Professor UNSW\n\nClinical lead, ENT Outreach services HNELHD\n\nIndigenous Lead, Australian Society Otolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery\n\nResearcher; Successful in numerous NHMRC grants, awards and collaboration\n\nChair, Advisory Group for reporting on the Ear and Hearing Health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people\n\nMember, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Ear and Hearing Health Partnership Committee\n\nServed on multiple advisory boards and committee’s including the Indigenous Health and Fellowship Services Committee\n\nPrevious Board member for the National Centre of Indigenous Excellence (NCIE)\n\nPrevious Board member Cancer Australia’s Advisory Board\n\nPrevious Board Member Hearing Australia\n\nPrevious secretary of Australia and New Zealand Society Paediatric Otolaryngology (ANZSPO)\n\nRecently, Dr Kong received an Honour Roll mention for Australian of the Year\n\nMany of our young Mob are labelled as problems, too difficult, described as having learning difficulties, or as not wanting to learn. The truth is that due to the complex legacy of colonisation, under-funded communities, and racism, many of our young people are living with undiagnosed and treatable medical issues that create barriers to learning, education, employment and healthy living.\n\nIt is Dr Kong’s goal to ensure that these barriers are eradicated and that our Mob have equal access to quality health care to enable them to have every opportunity in life.\n\nDonnell Wallam\n\n2023\n\nSportsperson of the Year\n\nDonnell Wallam is a proud Noongar woman from Korijekup, Western Australia, a small town 2 hours south of Boorloo (Perth). Donnell is a professional netballer and sharp shooter for the Australian Diamonds and the Queensland Firebirds. She was only the second Indigenous Suncorp Super Netball Player and third Indigenous woman to play netball for Australia. She is one of the most well-known and respected goalers in the Suncorp Super Netball competition.\n\nDonnell was picked as a replacement player for the Queensland Firebirds’ 2022 Suncorp Super Netball campaign, where she scored 519 goals and was the fourth-highest scorer in the competition. Her tally included 26 super shots (two-point goals) and 35 offensive rebounds, the third-highest tally in the 2022 season. This led her to be a training partner for Australia’s netball squad for the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, United Kingdom.\n\nDonnell takes every opportunity to share her culture and identity, and revealed a unique Deadly Choices uniform designed by Aboriginal artist Rachael Sarra, in the Suncorp Super Netball’s First Nations round in March this year.\n\nDonnell also exemplified incredible strength and staunch advocacy late last year when she sought an exemption from wearing an Australian Diamonds dress featuring the logo of sponsor Hancock Prospecting. This was due to the attitude deceased company founder, Lang Hancock, had expressed towards Aboriginal people on television in the 1980s. While the company pulled the $15 million sponsorship, four days later, Donnell debuted for the Diamonds in a Test match against England in Newcastle, coming off the bench to score the winning goal in the last seconds of the game. Additionally, Visit Victoria provided sponsorship of $15 million to secure the 2022 Super Netball grand final as well as several Diamonds matches and camps in the lead up to the 2026 Commonwealth Games.\n\nDonnell and her Queensland Firebirds teammates are active members of the community who attend and participate in netball coaching clinics in regional and remote Queensland.

Together with her Firebirds teammate Gabi Simpson, the deadly duo empower Mob to make positive health decisions, and unveiled the Firebirds’ new Deadly Choices shirt earlier this year.\n\nNetball has given Donnell the opportunity to be an advocate for her community and culture and to be a strong role model for young people all over the Country. Donnell has used her status as a professional athlete to progress and advocate pathways for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander netballers. Donnell embraces the opportunity to highlight sporting issues such as athlete pathways as well as important broader social issues.\n\nCourtney Burns\n\n2023\n\nYouth of the Year\n\nCourtney Burns is a 25 year old Gunaikurnai woman (land and sea country) from South Gippsland, Victoria. Courtney is currently studying Marine Science at James Cook University (JCU) in Townsville, Queensland, and assisting in the shark research lab in Townsville.\n\nCourtney is deeply passionate about ocean Country health, and interested in the links between elasmobranchs, ocean country and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Elasmobranchii is a class of cartilaginous fishes, including sharks, skates and rays. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been living off sea country since time immemorial, yet there is no evidence in scientific literature of relationships, positive or negative, with sharks.\n\nCourtney’s goal is to continue her research to be able to change the way the world sees sharks. She aims to promote action in their conservation by understanding the physiological effects of anthropogenic stressors (like climate change) on sharks, and how she can bring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures into scientific literature to further aid this goal.\n\nCourtney’s recent achievements include:\n\n2022/2023 – Aurora Internship Program; where she was placed within the ‘Physioshark’ team. Assisting with ‘Epaulette shark’ research projects and husbandry care of ‘Epaulette sharks’ and ‘Cinnamon Clown fish’; whilst tackling a metadata analysis on neonate blacktip reef sharks, focusing on their body condition (health).\n\nIndigenous Academic Achievement Award for Marine Science 2022 at the annual awards ceremony for the Indigenous Education and Research Centre (IERC) at JCU.\n\nGoogle Future Leaders in STEM Scholarship 2022.\n\nRecognised and acknowledged by CSIRO for Academic Excellence and offered a casual Research Technician position with the Predator Population team in the Environment business unit.\n\nCourtney also recently received a promotion from volunteer to Assistant Lab Manager/Volunteer Coordinator at the Rummer Lab at James Cook University within the Physioshark program.\n\nIn September 2022, Google and Aurora Education Foundation announced their STEM Scholarship recipients. Courtney was one of only three Aboriginal women selected as Google 2022 STEM scholars. This scholarship assists Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander university students who aspire to work in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Recipients of the scholarship receive assistance through funding which supports them throughout their studies.\n\nAs a James Cook University Student Ambassador, Courtney inspires other young First Nations people to consider tertiary education as an option for their future. Courtney also assists with University activities including career expos, recruitment events, school visits, campus tours, sponsorship events and more.\n\nCourtney encourages excellence from fellow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students by co-creating a supportive community via an Indigenous student association focusing on group study sessions, social sports, and gatherings online and in person.\n\nThe links between Ocean Country and our Mob have been known to us for a very long time. However, Courtney, through her research, studies and conservation, aims to bring these relationships to the forefront of mainstream scientific literature and ensure that First Nations knowledge is leading solutions to issues (such as climate change) affecting both our Mob, and the world.\n\nPatricia O'Connor\n\n2014\n\nFemale Elder of the Year\n\nRory O'Connor accepting the award on behalf of Patricia O'Connor.\n\nKnown for being a quiet achiever, Patricia O’Connor is the inspirational woman behind the Kombumerri Aboriginal Corporation for Culture.\n\nAn idea discussed around the dining table one evening in the early 1980’s has grown into one of Australia’s most successful Aboriginal-owned language centres, and is a major contributor to the Indigenous cultural landscape of south east Queensland.\n\nThe corporation trades by the name Yugambeh Museum. It is a language and heritage research centre and is the major source of information for researchers of Yugambeh cultural heritage.

The Museum also assists Aboriginal youth with employment and training opportunities, and helps community members trace their own family stories.\n\nPatricia has brought the stories of her community alive through her passion for curating interesting material for community. During her time with Kombumerri, Patricia has overseen 20 distinct and significant exhibitions – consisting of more than 300 panels and single photo items, at an average of one exhibition every two years.\n\nCurrently, Patricia is working with younger generations to create a new community movement called Yugambeh Mobo. Yugambeh Mobo is a campaign to unite the community through cultural pride from the past to our tomorrow. Yugambeh mobo aims to ensure Aboriginal culture, concepts and values are part of the south-east Queensland story.\n\nWayne Quilliam\n\n2009\n\nArtist of the Year\n\nWayne Quilliam has been working on the Australian and international scene for more than 15 years, establishing a reputation as one of Australia’s leading photographers.\n\nWayne is a prolific artist.

It was during her 10 years in this work that she built a reputation for her ability to advocate for justice for Indigenous people. This ability shone through in her campaigning on the 1967 Referendum, a turning point in the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\n\nIn 1972 Lowitja accepted a position as Senior Liaison Officer for the newly-created Department of Aboriginal Affairs. She saw this as a great opportunity to use her skills, passion and commitment to advance the rights of Indigenous people.\n\nBreaking new ground for Indigenous women at the national level, Lowitja became the fulltime chairperson of the National Aboriginal Conference in 1976. Lowitja continued to take on senior leadership roles and positions among prominent agencies in Aboriginal affairs, including Aboriginals Hostels and the Aboriginal Development Commission.\n\nIn 1990 Lowitja was appointed the inaugural chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.

His dream is to find funding to record Koomiloroi so that the language is there for the generations to come. He feels that traditional language is an important part of cultural identity.\n\nUncle Reg’s philosophy is that we are all here together and we should try to put the problems of the past behind us. There is a great future ahead of us all.\n\nLarissa Behrendt\n\n2009\n\nPerson of the Year\n\nLawyer and author Larissa Behrendt is a passionate and articulate advocate for the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n\nLarissa is Professor of Law and Director of Research at the Jumbunna Indigenous House of Learning at Sydney’s University of Technology.\n\nLarissa’s academic achievements alone have made her stand out.
