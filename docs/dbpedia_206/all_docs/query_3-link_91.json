        "text": "90s movies undoubtedly give us so much nostalgia. I mean, we have watched the likes of Home Alone, Jurassic Park, The Silence of the Lambs and Matilda time and time again and have never tired of them.\n\nAlso, we will never—and we mean never—not find 10 Things I Hate About You one of the funniest rom-coms, we’ll never not cry at tear-jerker Titanic—even though we know Jack’s definitely not coming back—and who wouldn’t want Hugh Grant in Four Weddings and a Funeral on a big screen? Then there are the film titles that have become phrases in our daily vocabularies without us realising, from Sliding Doors to Groundhog Day; talk about iconic. We also can’t help but point out the faces that made the nineties impossibly iconic, such as the Olsen twins in flicks such as It Takes Two.\n\nThe nineties also shape the way we dress to this day—featuring the original inspiration behind the Y2K looks we love to wear. There’s Clueless’s iconic co-ords, the spaghetti-strap red dress in She's All That, Julia Roberts’s OTK boots a la Pretty Woman, the ubiquitous flares in Dazed & Confused, Uma Thurman’s timeless white button-down shirt in Pulp Fiction...\n\nThey’re style references so prolific that you’d probably forgotten where they came from, but there’s nothing we love more than a good ol' throwback, which is why we’re bringing you this round-up. So, without further ado, then, here are 53 of the best 90s movies to both inspire your wardrobe and get totally lost in.\n\nThis story first appeared on glamourmagazine.co.uk"
