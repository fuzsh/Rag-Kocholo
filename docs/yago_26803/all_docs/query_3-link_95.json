        "text": "Clive Barker’s LORD OF ILLUSIONS 2-Disc Collector’s Edition Comes To Blu-ray Dec 18!\n\nI remember this movie being a pretty big deal in the horror community leading up to its release. I had two particular factors leading my interest into it; Clive Barker and Scott Bakula. As a huge Quantum Leap fan, and the fact that he wasn’t in a whole lot of movies, meant I just had to see it. And around this time, if a movie had Clive Barker’s name anywhere on its credits it was a must see. Unfortunately, I don’t remember being too impacted by the film once I saw it, and have not revisited it since probably a VHS rental back in the 90s. So foggy my memory that I didn’t remember Famke Janssen as the love interest in the movie. This release is also awesome because it contains both the theatrical version and Director’s Cut of the film. Anyway, I’m excited to go back to it now in Scream Factory’s upcoming Collector’s Edition as I’ll get a likely stellar transfer of the film as well as some groovy extras to discuss it.\n\nSCREAM FACTORY™ PRESENTS\n\nCLIVE BARKER’S\n\nLORD OF ILLUSIONS COLLECTOR’S EDITION\n\nStarring Scott Bakula, Kevin J.
