        "text": "Occult detective noir illusion jam that throws in a little BDSM and plenty of disgusting yet beautiful Barker-ism’s. I popped in the director’s cut of Clive Barker’s Lord of Illusions and decided to watch it in black and white to satisfy my shadowy noir craving and lemme tell you... if the effects ‘didn’t hold up’ or whatever people say who might be used to uncanny valley cgi than this should be your desired viewing experience.\n\nI was always a fan of this movie, but honestly I greatly prefer this over the theatrical cut, the plot flows better, the characters are way richer, and the atmosphere is decidedly darker as cinematic white bread art form Scott Bakula plays private detective Harry…\n\nMy review is based on the Director's Cut version that lasts 121 minutes with more explicit scenes.\n\nI remember that at some point in my childhood I got to see this movie but rather than terrify me it made me sleepy and I remembered little of it, now, many who see it recommend reading the book by Clive Barker first before venturing to see this adaptation and it may be true and they are not wrong because the book will usually always be superior in everything, but I in my case this has not been so and I decided to remember it and see it \"again\".\n\nIt all begins when some members of a sect betrayed their leader, a magician…\n\nJune Scavenger: 23/30\n\n#21. A movie your parents wouldn't let you see when you were a kid.\n\nhttp://letterboxd.com/scumbalina/list/alone-out-of-my-comfort-zone-june-scavenger/.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nBrace yourself, this is not a review.\n\nIt's father's day so I decided to go with this movie because it created quite a stir in my house in 1996. My Dad had just moved back in and my parents were attempting to work things out after 7 or 8 years after their divorce. The cracks started to show immediately. Dad has always been obsessed with death and the apocalypse. He's an eccentric fundamentalist who lives off the grid mountain man style. He’s always has pretty good taste in movies and would let me rent whatever I wanted at a time when…\n\nHooptober 10.0, pt.32- I shall make the audience...disappear!\n\n12/6 Countries (France, UK, USA, Japan, Italy, South Africa, Hong Kong, Russia, India, Germany, Spain, Finland) (COMPLETE)\n\n11/8 Decades (1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 1960s, 2010s, 2000s, 1910s, 1920s, 1940s, 1950s, 1930s) (COMPLETE)\n\n1/1- Clive Barker Adaptations.\n\n2nd Clive Barker (after Hellraiser)\n\nFeels good to be getting back to the cinematic efforts of Barker, even if it's not nearly as sublime as Hellraiser. If I was to put my finger on a totalising reason for the flaws, it's that Barker thinks too much like a writer and not enough like a filmmaker. D'Amour can be more passive at the end of a novel, the multiple characters can take their turns juggling the final moments,…\n\n#20 of 31 - HOOPTOBER 5.0 : We Don’t Need A Stretcher In There We Need A Mop\n\nWhat if a magician wasn't performing tricks? What if it were real! That is the territory we cover in Clive Barker's film! The film is way out there but he manages to pull in the mainstream audiences by way of Scott Bakula! Now don't get me wrong I don't hate the actor but he is about as mainstream as one can get and I believe that's exactly what they were going for! Bringing balance and appropriate grounding to a film that quite frankly teeters between the divine and bats in the belfry territory!\n\nWhat really interested me about the film is that…"
