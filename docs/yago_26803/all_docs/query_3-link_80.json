We see a man's buttocks and a brief shot of his hip region while fondling the girls. A kissing scene which culminates in a shirtless man caressing a woman as she undresses (although we don't see anything). They are talking and they seem naked, although all we see are shoulders and his chest.\n\nVIOLENCE/GORE 9 - People are shot and killed, people are killed by fireballs and there's a lot of gore. Here's a brief list: A man puts his fingers through someone's temple. A growling baboon scratches a girl, leaving bloody marks. A woman's hand is deeply cut in a close-up (we see her bloody hand throughout the rest of the scene). The devil shows up as a grotesque figure with lumpy features and burning eyes. A man is found with several knives sticking out of his body; he's bloodied and wheezing. A man pulls glass from his body in long, bloody pieces (we hear squishy noises). Swords enter a man's body with thuds; there's a great deal of blood. A woman is hit by a car and we see her twisted, bloody body under the wheels. A fight culminates in an impalement. A man gets out of a grave with a bloody face minus one eye. A deformed corpse is revived. We see bloody, wriggling organs a few times and heads split open exposing mud.\n\nLANGUAGE 7 - 25 F-words, 10 scatological terms, and several milder obscenities.\n\nDISCUSSION TOPICS - Magic and illusion, resurrection, Satan, cults, reality v. fantasy.\n\nMESSAGE - We must not be tricked into thinking fantasies are real.\n\nCAVEATS\n\nBe aware that while we do our best to avoid spoilers it is impossible to disguise all details and some may reveal crucial plot elements.\n\nWe've gone through several editorial changes since we started covering films in 1992 and older reviews are not as complete & accurate as recent ones; we plan to revisit and correct older reviews as resources and time permits.\n\nOur ratings and reviews are based on the theatrically-released versions of films; on video there are often Unrated, Special, Director's Cut or Extended versions, (usually accurately labelled but sometimes mislabeled) released that contain additional content, which we did not review.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nSee ratings & reviews at Critics.com\n\nFILTER by RATINGS\n\nDid you know you can now filter searches by any combination of ratings? Just go to our search page or use the search bar, with or without a keyword, from the top navigation menu. Move sliders from 0-10 in any combination, check and uncheck MPAA ratings and use keywords to further filter results -- please let us know what you think.\n\nTHE ASSIGNED NUMBERS\n\nUnlike the MPAA we do not assign one inscrutable rating based on age but 3 objective ratings for SEX/NUDITY, VIOLENCE/GORE & LANGUAGE on a scale of 0 to 10, from lowest to highest depending on quantity & context |more|\n\nFIND US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFollowFollow\n\nFollowFollow\n\nadvertisement\n\nCOPYRIGHT POLICY\n\nPrint a page, share with friends, and yes, please go ahead and email links.
