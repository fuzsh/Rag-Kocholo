        "text": "In one of the very first scenes in the movie, the camera pans over a deserted ranch house in the Mojave desert in 1982. As it pans further, we see chickens in a coop clucking away. A little bit further down we see dead chickens lying on the ground. We then go on to a stable where we see a dead horse. The dead animals were fake, provided by the prop department. In the next scene, we are inside the ranch house and now in the basement where Nix is leading a cult meeting. In the scene where the shackled mandrill teases and tortures Dorthea, the trainer was just off camera giving the mandrill voice and hand commands. To accomplish a scene where it growls and swipes at Dorothea, the trainer offered the mandrill a food reward, and then took it away. To get the mandrill to appear to snarl, the trainer gave a hand signal command to smile, which made it appear as though he was snarling. At one point the mandrill jumps off the chair and runs. To accomplish this, the trainer, off camera, merely called for the mandrill to come. In the end, the mandrill is shot and his head explodes. The real mandrill was not even on set when this happened. Special effects and image animation were used to create this shot. There was a scene filmed at the Magic Castle in Hollywood where doves in a cage are shown. The doves were the property of the Magic Castle. There were a few scenes in which snakes were used. One scene showed snakes crawling over supposedly dead bodies. The snakes had been released by one handler who tapped them gently on the tail to get them moving, while another handler on the other side of the dummies, which were used for bodies, used a rodent scent to attract the snakes. Another scene shows snakes in the back seat of a car. They had merely been placed there by their trainers. In one other scene, we see snakes around an actorâ€™s neck and body. The handlers again, simply placed the snakes on the actor, who was familiar with the snakes. The only other scene with animals showed cockroaches swarming on the wall as a light goes on. The handler had merely placed them on the wall in the dark, then when the actor turned on the light, the roaches ran of their own accord."
