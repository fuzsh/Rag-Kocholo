        "text": "Dir. Clive Barker (1995)\n\nA private detective faces off against an illusionist with supernatural powers.\n\nFull disclosure: this is the only movie that I've ever turned off because I was too freaked out to continue and never went back to finish. Yeah, yeah, I know, that makes me a pussy, whatever. This movie scared the bejeezus out of me when I was a teenager, especially the part with the strobe lights and the terrifyingly bloody mayhem onscreen. But just for you people (all four of you, anyway), I decided to go back and revisit it in an attempt to make it all the way through. Turns out... yeah, I guess I was just a pussy.\n\nPrivate detective Harry D'Amour (Scott Bakula) has been sent to Los Angeles to investigate a man committing insurance fraud and happens upon a bizarre murder scene in which a psychic named Quaid (Joseph Latimore) was tortured by a pair of psychotic ne'er-do-wells. While investigating this new crime, he runs across a famous magician named Philip Swann (Kevin J. O'Connor) who is known the world over for his feats of illusion magic. Swann's wife Dorothea (Famke Janssen) begins to get a bit too close to D'Amour, and Swann is none too happy about it. But Swann's powers are not a trick, and D'Amour begins to discover that perhaps even death itself is an illusion.\n\nSecond full disclosure: I kinda fucking love magic. I think every guy does. There's something in the male brain that allows magicians to resonate with our entire sense of reality, and toying with what shouldn't be possible in an accessible way is so intriguing. Whether it's the appreciation of being tricked or the attempt to figure out how the illusionist does what he does, this appeal is central to the plot of Lord of Illusions as well. Unfortunately, this was also during the era in which seemingly every trick or special effect was handled with CGI, and Barker's film has a ton of it, often to its own detriment. It makes a certain amount of sense, as Barker's brand of horror would have been near impossible to do completely at the time in which Lord of Illusions was made.\n\nWhile the computer aids are impossible to ignore, there's also a decent amount of practical effects used in the film as well. Some better-than-average gore, some truly scary scenes, and a mysterious and engaging plot actually make the Lord of Illusions a surprisingly watchable film despite its shortcomings. Barker has a style all his own, and you can generally tell its one of his films when you really get into it. This film is no different, and Barker's trademark brand of dark horror with an S&M twist comes through very well in this film. It's no Hellraiser, to be sure, but it's a fun film regardless.\n\nThe acting in the film is very dated, with Scott Bakula doing his best Sam Beckett impression throughout the film. He's a bit gumshoe, which actually works pretty well for the noir aspect of the film. All of the magicians running around are hugely entertaining and theatrical, and it gives the film a charming quality that I wasn't really expecting. It's certainly dark, and it's got a subdued score that feels like it could be applied to any of Barker's films. The film is based on Barker's story The Last Illusion from his Books of Blood, which contains some of my favorites of his works, and it's a film that just oozes his tone. I'm here for that if nothing else.\n\nAll in all, Lord of Illusions is certainly not the best of Barker's films, but it's also not his worst. (No, that would be Nightbreed, which is absolutely terrible.) It drags a little at times, which is fairly typical of a noir even if its in the horror genre. It's also decently bloody, and while the effects are uneven, some of them are quite good. Plus, there's magic, which is a topic that's rife for exploration in the horror genre because of its dependence on the ethereal and supernatural. Barker plays with reality a good bit in this film, and he's definitely the man for the job. One line that really stuck out to me as being especially applicable today: We have to agree on what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together. Hoo boy, if we could only follow that today...\n\nWho this movie is for: Clive Barker fans, 90's horror aficionados, Amateur magicians\n\nBottom line: Clive Barker is a true master of horror, and even his bad stuff is still pretty good (except for Nightbreed, which, again, sucks). Lord of Illusions might not be in the top 5 of his written and directed works, but it's still a hugely entertaining flick. If you're a Barker fan, you'll likely enjoy this one, and it's a great example of the mid-90's horror that often gets forgotten because of the stellar last half of the decade. Check this one out if you've never seen it before, it's streaming right now on Max."
