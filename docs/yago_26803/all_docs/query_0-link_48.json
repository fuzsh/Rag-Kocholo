        "text": "directed by Clive Barker\n\nAs a fan of Hellraiser but a casual horror-film watcher, I decided to catch up on this 1995 release and the third (and last) directed by Clive Barker himself. This was the film adaptation of Barker’s short story “The Last Illusion” and starred Scott Bakula, Kevin J. O’Connor, Famke Janssen, and Daniel von Bargen.\n\nThe film is both a film noir, detective movie and a horror movie rolled into one, not unlike Se7en. Bakula plays Harry D’amour, a standard detective with an inclination for the darker side of life and solving cases involving demons and exorcists. In a turn of career, he gets an assignment to trail an insurance fraud suspect, but the darkness guides him right into the largest demonic case he’s ever confronted.\n\nA cult leader with legitimate powers of sorcery named William Nix had compiled multiple supporters in a deserted trash-sculpture lair where he prophesied that he was the one called “The Puritan” who can grant the wisdom of both worlds to his followers (one world as we see it, the other existing supported by an illusion where even death is an illusion). After a botched sacrifice of a girl and the assassination of Nix by a former group of followers, the time has come when he will rise again with the help of Nix’s disciples. Harry D’amour happens upon these disciples’ whereabouts during the insurance fraud case, and he is told by a psychic (the same guy that shot Nix dead? In a different state 13 years after the killing of Nix?) that darkness has chosen D’amour to get in contact with other former members before the revival of Nix destroys the world.\n\nMy big takeaways from the movie are all of the practical special effects used, the artistic nature of the trash-sculpture garden by Nix’s lair, the creative interpretation of magic and sorcery during the fights with one of these magic forces, and the wild interpretation of Nix after he is revived and on a mission to end all of his followers’ live after all this time. I didn’t care for Bakula’s performance (his face reminds me of a miserable guy who just witnessed someone kicking his dog). The random love scene between Famke’s character and D’amour felt shoe-horned in, as well. The end credits’ music was some atrocious Diamanda Galás song that made me want to claw my eyes out.\n\nMy biggest criticism goes towards the writing of William Nix and the powers he is meant to have. He’s essentially a god-like character who plays with his haters’ lives like a cat plays with a mouse. He had the moment to save face and destroy Famke’s character (spoiler: she is the same girl they were about to sacrifice 13 years prior), toss D’amour down to “hell” after her, and finish off one of the lead actors’ roles (another former devotee, Phillip Swann). But he doesn’t, but that’s ok because now he can waste time giving speeches and looking cool while Swann can use his given magic traits (by Nix) against him.\n\nThe artistry of the movie should be witnessed, however. Barker is a visual artist by nature, as well, and a good deal of his visions went into making this. The blood and gore of Hellraiser are here in various forms, from the close-ups on the “binding” mask put on Nix, the slowly dying psychic with knives collected in his torso, and the “failed” magic trick Swann attempts onstage as swords impale him one after another as the audience gasps. The suspended cenobites in Hellraiser are revisited here as Nix suspends himself in a bloody animal carcass “sculpture.” You really just need to see Barker’s creativity at play throughout his movies altogether. While some scenes seem unremarkable, others are giving off “jump scare” moments (like when Janssen’s character reaches for a gun next to a “dead” cult member and it comes after her).\n\nWhile I would’ve recast Bakula (simply because he did not seem like an Indiana Jones character Barker was hoping he’d cast) and given William Nix more power to be more chaotic in the film (instead of waiting forever until he’s attack one of his haters), I enjoyed the imaginative story about two worlds and what happens when someone crosses the line between them both. Now if you’ll excuse me, the early CG effects that look like blue corn tortilla chips and Bakula pronouncing “Dorothea” as “Dorthia” has me a bit hungry. I’ll be enjoying them instead of watching the scene of hell’s butthole closing up again, thank you."
