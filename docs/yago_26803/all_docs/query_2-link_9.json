        "text": "2016 play by Jack Thorne\n\nHarry Potter and the Cursed ChildWritten byJack Thorne Story byBased onHarry Potter\n\nby J. K. RowlingMusic byImogen HeapDate premieredJuly 30, 2016; 8 years ago ( )Place premieredPalace Theatre, LondonOriginal languageEnglishGenreSettingWizarding Worldwww .harrypottertheplay .com\n\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play written by Jack Thorne from an original story by Thorne, J. K. Rowling and John Tiffany. The plot occurs nineteen years after the events of Rowling's novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It follows Albus Severus Potter, the son of Harry Potter, who is now Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic. When Albus arrives at Hogwarts, he gets sorted into Slytherin, and fails to live up to his father's legacy, making him resentful of his father. Rowling has referred to the play as \"the eighth Harry Potter story\".[1]\n\nFrom its premiere, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has received near-universal critical acclaim for its magic, illusions, and stage wizardry.[2] The original West End production premiered at the Palace Theatre on 7 June 2016.[3] It received a record-breaking eleven nominations and won another record-breaking nine awards, including Best New Play, at the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards. A Broadway production opened at the Lyric Theatre on 21 April 2018.[4] That production received ten nominations and won six awards, including Best Play at the 2018 Tony Awards. An Australian production opened at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne, on 23 February 2019.[5] A second American production opened in San Francisco at the Curran Theatre on 1 December 2019.[6] The first non-English production opened at the Mehr! Theater in Hamburg, Germany, on 5 December 2021.[7] A Canadian production opened at the Ed Mirvish Theatre in Toronto, on 19 June 2022.[8] A Japanese production opened at the TBS Akasaka ACT Theater on 8 July 2022.[9]\n\nThe play was originally produced as a two-part play, that could be viewed on the same day (i.e. in the afternoon and in the evening) or over two evenings.[10] In June 2021, the play was re-staged as a single 3.5 hour show for future performances on Broadway in November 2021.[11] In 2022, the San Francisco, Melbourne, Toronto, and Tokyo productions also adopted the one-part play, with Hamburg following in 2023. The West End production is the only location that continues to stage the original two-part play.[12]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2013, it was revealed that a stage play based on the Harry Potter series had been in development for around a year,[13] with the view to bringing it to the stage sometime in 2016.[14] At the time of the announcement, author J. K. Rowling revealed that the play would \"explore the previously untold story of Harry's early years as an orphan and outcast\".[15] The following May, Rowling began establishing the creative team for the project.[16]\n\nOn 26 June 2015,[17] it was revealed it would receive its world premiere in mid-2016 at London's Palace Theatre.[18] The announcement marked the eighteenth anniversary of the publication of the first Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,[19] published on 26 June 1997.[20]\n\nOn announcing plans for the project, Rowling stated that the play would not be a prequel.[21] In response to queries regarding the choice of a play rather than a new novel, Rowling stated that she \"is confident that when audiences see the play they will agree that it is the only proper medium for the story\".[22] Rowling also assured audiences that the play would contain an entirely new story and would not be a rehashing of previously explored content.[23] On 24 September 2015, Rowling announced that the play had been split into two parts.[24] The parts are designed to be viewed on the same day or consecutively over two evenings.[25][10]\n\nOn 23 October 2015, it was confirmed the plays were set nineteen years after the conclusion of the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,[26] and would open at London's Palace Theatre in July 2016.[27] The plays principally follow Harry Potter, now Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and his younger son, Albus Severus Potter.[28][29]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe play is divided in two parts, consisting of two acts each.\n\nAct One\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the opening scene, set during the epilogue of Deathly Hallows in the year 2017, Harry and Ginny Potter send their younger son, Albus Severus Potter, on the Hogwarts Express to begin his first year at Hogwarts. Harry works as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic, while Ginny is the editor of the sports section of The Daily Prophet. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger also send their daughter Rose on the train. Hermione is now the Minister for Magic, while Ron manages Weasley's Wizard Wheezes in Diagon Alley alongside his brother George. Aboard the Hogwarts Express, Albus befriends Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Harry's former foe Draco, and his wife, Astoria. In a break with the tradition of Potters being sorted into Gryffindor, Albus is sorted into Slytherin alongside Scorpius.\n\nBoth boys are bullied over the next years, with Albus perceived as failing to live up to his parents, and Scorpius being rumoured to be the son of Lord Voldemort. Astoria passes away due to a fatal disease. Albus and Harry drift apart, with Harry being uncertain about how to help Albus. The summer before his fourth year, Albus gets into a fight with Harry, after being given Harry's old baby blanket and a love potion from Ron. During the fight, Harry angrily says that he sometimes wishes Albus was not his son, and Albus spills the potion on the blanket.\n\nHarry obtains a prototype of a more powerful version of the Time-Turner, which allows one to travel into the past and change history. Simultaneously, Harry's scar starts hurting again, raising concerns that Voldemort may be returning. Amos Diggory, who is cared for by his niece Delphi, asks Harry to use the Time-Turner to prevent the death of his son, Cedric. After overhearing Harry refuse to help the Diggorys, Albus is inspired to do so and convinces Scorpius to help him. The two escape from the Hogwarts Express to visit Amos, and they team up with Delphi to steal the Time-Turner from Hermione's office, in the Ministry of Magic, while disguised with Polyjuice Potion.\n\nAct Two\n\n[edit]\n\nAs Cedric's death was the result of him winning the Triwizard Tournament[30] alongside Harry, the boys use the Time-Turner to travel back to the first tournament challenge. They disguise themselves as Durmstrang students to sabotage Cedric and prevent his victory. The plan fails, and the disguises cause Hermione to become suspicious of Viktor Krum, a Durmstrang student, and go to the Yule Ball with Ron instead. As a result, Ron never experiences the jealousy fundamental to his relationship with Hermione, and the two never marry. Ron instead falls in love with Padma Patil at the Ball, and Hermione becomes a frustrated professor at Hogwarts. Albus is now in Gryffindor.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry has nightmares about Voldemort. The centaur Bane tells Harry that a \"dark cloud\" is around Albus. Convinced that Scorpius is a threat to Albus, Harry tries to separate the boys at Hogwarts by attempting to force Headmistress Minerva McGonagall to keep tabs on Albus using the Marauder's Map.\n\nAlbus and Scorpius' friendship is destroyed, but the two reconcile after Albus steals Harry's old Invisibility Cloak from Albus' older brother James. Harry relents after a conversation with Draco and Ginny. Meanwhile, Albus and Scorpius make another attempt to use the Time-Turner to save Cedric, this time by humiliating him during the Triwizard Tournament's second task. When Scorpius returns to the present day, Albus is not with him. Dolores Umbridge reveals that Harry is dead and Voldemort rules the wizarding world.\n\nAct Three\n\n[edit]\n\nScorpius discovers that his actions caused Cedric to join the Death Eaters and kill Neville Longbottom, preventing him from killing Nagini and thus allowing Voldemort to win the Battle of Hogwarts. With Harry now dead, Albus never existed, while Voldemort was able to consolidate power and transform the Ministry of Magic into a dictatorial regime. In the new timeline, Scorpius became a popular Head Boy and Quidditch star, helping the staff and students torment Muggle-borns. Umbridge became the new Headmistress of Hogwarts and patrols the school with Dementors and a revived Inquisitorial Squad, led by Scorpius.\n\nA dark figure called \"The Augurey\" leads the Ministry of Magic. With the help and sacrifice of alternate Ron, Hermione, and Severus Snape, Scorpius uses the Time-Turner to prevent his and Albus' past actions, and restore the original timeline. Scorpius reunites with Albus, and the two are found by their parents, as well as Ron and Hermione. Harry scolds Albus, but the two begin to reconcile.\n\nRealizing the danger the Time-Turner poses, Scorpius and Albus attempt to destroy it, when they are joined by Delphi. Scorpius notices Delphi's tattoo of an Augurey and realizes she was in charge of the Ministry of Magic in the alternate timeline. Delphi takes them captive, killing a fellow student in the process, and reveals her intention of restoring the alternate timeline.\n\nAfter Ron states he saw Albus and Scorpius with Delphi, Harry and Draco confront Amos, and discover Delphi had bewitched him into thinking she was his niece. Delphi takes the boys to the final challenge of the Triwizard Tournament, but Albus and Scorpius foil her plans, and Delphi uses the Time-Turner again to travel farther back in time. She inadvertently takes the boys with her, and destroys the Time-Turner to leave them stranded in time.\n\nSearching Delphi's room, Harry, Draco, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron discover hidden writing on the walls claiming Delphi is the daughter of Voldemort, and describing a prophecy that will allow Voldemort to return.\n\nAct Four\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbus and Scorpius discover they have been taken back to the night before Harry's parents were killed. They write an invisible message on Harry's baby blanket, knowing in the present, the blanket would become stained with a love potion and expose the message. The message reads: \"Dad.Help.Godric's Hollow.311081.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Draco reveals the Time-Turner was actually a prototype for a perfected model owned by him. After Harry receives the message from the boys, he and his allies use Draco's Time-Turner to travel back in time to save them and stop Delphi. They deduce she intends to convince Voldemort to abandon his attempt to kill Harry, ensuring his survival.\n\nHarry magically disguises himself as Voldemort to distract Delphi; after a struggle, the group subdues her. Rather than killing Delphi, they decide that she will be given a life sentence in Azkaban Prison. Voldemort appears, oblivious to Harry and the group, and they allow the murder of Harry's parents to play out, unwilling to risk altering the future again.\n\nAfter returning to the present, Delphi is sent to Azkaban. Albus and Scorpius decide to be more active at Hogwarts, with Scorpius expressing interest in trying out for the Slytherin Quidditch Team. He also asks Rose to be his girlfriend. She turns him down, but becomes more friendly towards Scorpius. Harry and Albus visit Cedric's grave, with Harry apologising for his role in Cedric's death. Albus and Harry grow closer. Harry and Draco overcome their old enmity, having been allied in foiling Delphi's plot.\n\nOne-part revisions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe one-part version of the play, currently playing in Hamburg, Melbourne, New York, Tokyo, and Toronto, had over an hour and a half of content cut from the show to bring the runtime down to 3 hours and 30 minutes, including a 20-minute intermission. The dream sequences involving Young Harry, the Dursleys and Hagrid have all been removed, as well as the conversations Scorpius has with Polly Chapman and Draco in the Dark World. The St Oswald's location has been replaced with Amos Diggory's private residence, and the character of Lily Potter Jr is now only mentioned in the show.\n\nThe one-part version also makes Albus and Scorpius' relationship more explicitly romantic. Rose is a platonic friend to Scorpius rather than a love interest, and when Harry and Albus visit Cedric's grave, Albus tells Harry that Scorpius will always be the most important person in his life, to which Harry responds warmly. These changes have since been made in the two-part version of the play.\n\nProductions\n\n[edit]\n\nProduction Venue First preview Opening night Closing night Notes West End Palace Theatre Part One: 7 June 2016\n\nPart Two: 9 June 2016 30 July 2016 Currently running Broadway Lyric Theatre Part One: 16 March 2018\n\nPart Two: 17 March 2018 22 April 2018 Currently running\n\nTwo-part play: 16 March 2018 – 12 March 2020\n\nOne-part play: 12 November 2021 – present\n\nMelbourne Princess Theatre Part One: 18 January 2019\n\nPart Two: 19 January 2019 23 February 2019 9 July 2023[31]\n\nTwo-part play: 18 January 2019 – 27 March 2022\n\nOne-part play: 4 May 2022 – 9 July 2023\n\nSan Francisco Curran Theatre Part One: 23 October 2019\n\nPart Two: 24 October 2019 1 December 2019 11 September 2022\n\nTwo-part play: 23 October 2019 – 11 March 2020\n\nOne-part play: 9 February – 11 September 2022\n\nHamburg Mehr!

Some websites listed all three as authors of the script,[33] but by 26 July 2016, the official website for the play[34] and many others[35] were listing Thorne as the sole script writer.\n\nThe play is directed by Tiffany[36][37] with choreography by Steven Hoggett,[38] set design by Christine Jones,[39] costume design by Katrina Lindsay,[40] lighting design by Neil Austin,[41] music by Imogen Heap,[42] and sound design by Gareth Fry.[43] In addition, special effects were created by Jeremy Chernick,[44] with illusions by Jamie Harrison, and musical supervision by Martin Lowe.[45]\n\nThe producers and Rowling have maintained a campaign called #KeepTheSecrets to ask people who have seen the play not to reveal its major twists. The slogan is printed on the tickets for the play and badges with the slogan are handed out for free during intervals. People buying their tickets online are emailed a video after the play from J.K. Rowling asking them to support the campaign.[46][47][48][49]\n\nWest End (2016–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 26 June 2015, it was announced that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child would make its world premiere at the Palace Theatre in the West End.[50]\n\nTickets went on sale to preregistered priority members on 28 October 2015, before going on sale to the public on 30 October 2015.[51] In just under 8 hours of priority booking, 175,000 tickets were sold for the world premiere production.[52] To meet the demand for tickets, the play's booking period was extended through January 2017.[53] Upon tickets being made available to the general public, an extension was announced through 30 April 2017.[54] On the same day, another extension was announced, this time through 27 May 2017.[55]\n\nOn 20 December 2015, initial casting was announced with Jamie Parker playing Harry Potter, Noma Dumezweni playing Hermione Granger and Paul Thornley playing Ron Weasley.[56][57][58] The casting of the dark-skinned Noma Dumezweni as Hermione sparked controversy, with Rowling responding that Hermione's skin was never specified as white.[59][60] Further notable casting included Poppy Miller as Ginny Potter, Alex Price as Draco Malfoy, Sam Clemmett as Albus Potter and Anthony Boyle as Scorpius Malfoy.[61] The original production featured an overall cast of 42 actors.[62][63]\n\nPreviews for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child began at the Palace Theatre on 7 June 2016.[64] The official opening night for the play was on 30 July 2016.[3] The original cast played their final performances on 24 May 2017.[65]\n\nOn 16 March 2020, performances were suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[66] Performances resumed on 14 October 2021, continuing as the original two-part production.[67]\n\nBroadway (2018–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 4 May 2017, it was announced that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child would premiere on Broadway at the Lyric Theatre.[68] In preparation for the play, the Lyric Theatre underwent extensive renovations, which included removing 400 seats from the auditorium and moved the entrance to 43rd Street.[69] The New York Times estimated that it was the most expensive non-musical Broadway play ever, incurring approximately $68 million in opening costs.[70] Tickets initially went on sale on 18 October 2017.[71]\n\nOn 2 August 2017, the original Broadway cast was announced.

By June 2017, the book had sold over 4.5 million copies in the United States.[137]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child has received a range of reviews from critics.[138][139][140][141] Some audiences and critics have complimented the casting and performances, while many debate the quality of the piece and how it compares to entries in the main Harry Potter series.\n\nPublications awarding five-star ratings included The Independent, the London Evening Standard, The Stage and WhatsOnStage.com.[142][143][144][145] The Telegraph also gave five, although \"there are some quibbles,\" while The Guardian's Michael Billington awarded four stars.[146][147] According to Book Marks, the play's script received \"positive\" reviews (or a \"A-\" [148]) based on ten critic reviews with four being \"rave\" and four \"positive\" and two \"mixed\".[149]\n\nAnthony Boyle's performance as Scorpius Malfoy garnered particular acclaim. WhatsOnStage.com wrote that \"Boyle gives a career-making performance,\" while The Wall Street Journal described him as \"the break-out performance\".[145][150] Variety's critic, Matt Trueman, agreed, writing, \"it's Boyle who really stands out\", and both Trueman and Henry Hitchings, in the Evening Standard, noted that his performance was sure to be a fan favourite.[143][151]\n\nResponse within the Harry Potter fandom\n\n[edit]\n\nThe play was met with a polarising response from the Harry Potter fandom.[152] Fans responded positively to the play and its characters, with Scorpius Malfoy being particularly popular.[153] Some fans commented that the dialogue between the familiar characters was \"spot on\".[154] Others have noted that the play sheds light on some of the relationships between the characters, such as Harry and Dumbledore's.[155] The response had been particularly positive among fans who watched the play on stage.[156]\n\nIn response to the play's book-form publication, some fans said its story seemed more \"like a work of fan fiction\" and said that it diverged from previously established rules of the universe, criticising the script's characterisation.[157][158][159] Some also took issue with the style and plot of the script, complaining that the Time-Turner storylines had already been used, as had Cedric Diggory's death, and that the writers were rehashing old storylines and over-played tropes of the fantasy/sci-fi genre.[160][161]\n\nQueerbaiting accusations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe stage play's \"ambiguously gay\" portrayal of the male friendship between Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy has been criticized as an example of \"queerbaiting\",[162][163] with director John Tiffany stating his belief that it \"would not [have] been appropriate\" for The Cursed Child to directly address the characters' sexualities.[164][165][166]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginal London production\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Nominee Result 2016 Evening

Entertainment applied to purchase the rights to Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, leading to speculation that the stage play was going to become a film, despite earlier claims, most notably from Harry Potter creator J. K. Rowling, that a film adaptation was not being made.[175][176]\n\nIn November 2021, Chris Columbus, who previously directed the first two installments of the Harry Potter film series, expressed interest in directing a film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, with the intent of having the main cast members reprise their roles.[177][178][179][180] When The New York Times asked Daniel Radcliffe if he would be ready to return to his role as Harry Potter, he replied that he was not interested in it at the moment, but would not deny the possibility of returning sometime in the future.[181][182]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
