While on a case involving an exorcism, he witnesses the murder of an L.A. fortune teller, who warns him of the return of \"The Puritan,\" a dangerous cult leader named Nix who was thought dead and buried in the Mojave Desert over a decade ago. Famed illusionist Philip Swann and his alluring wife Dorothea lead D'Amour deeper into the mystery around Nix's cult. But Swann's apparent death on-stage complicates the case, as does the growing passion between D'Amour and Dorothea. With each bizarre incident, D'Amour learns just how thin the line between illusion and true magic really is, with the imminent return of the malevolent Nix more likely ever moment."
