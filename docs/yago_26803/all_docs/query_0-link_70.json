        "text": "From best-selling author and celebrated director Clive Barker comes a supernatural thriller that rips apart the boundaries between sanity and madness, and between the art of illusion and the terrifying forces of magic.\n\nScott Bakula (Quantum Leap) portrays Harry D'Amour, a private detective visiting Los Angeles on a routine investigation. Harry gets more than he bargains for when he encounters Philip Swan (Kevin J. O'Connor, The Mummy), a performer whose amazing illusions captivate the world. But are they really illusions? Harry isn't so sure as he is thrust into a nightmare of murder, deception and terrifying assaults from the dark beyond. Famke Janssen (GoldenEye, X-Men) and Daniel von Bargen (The Faculty) also star.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nDisc 1\n\nTheatrical Cut\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\nDisc 2\n\nDirector's Cut\n\nAudio Commentary with Director/Writer/Producer Clive Barker\n\nNEW! Interview with Special Effects Artist Howard Berger\n\nNEW!

Pre-orders are shipped as soon as the product arrives. International pre-orders may not come in before the street date. This is especially true with Australian pre-orders.\n\nAll items that come with a slipcover will say so in the product page.\n\nPre-orders will not say WITH SLIPCOVER until the product comes in.\n\nSlipcovers are not guaranteed to be in mint condition.\n\nIf you can order it, it's either in stock or a pre-order. If an item is out of stock you will not be able to add it to your cart. It's rare but our inventory may not be correct. So in some cases an item may have to be shipped separately."
