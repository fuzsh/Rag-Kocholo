        "text": "Padma Awards\n\ncivilian awards, India\n\nPadma Awards, three awards—Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri—that are among the highest civilian honors in India. The awards can be given for achievements in any field, including art, social work, public affairs, science and engineering, trade and industry, medicine, literature and education, civil services, and sports. To be nominated for a Padma Award, one’s activity should involve an element of public service. Nominations are open to the public, and self-nominations are allowed. Invitations for nominations are sent to all state and union territory governments of India, all federal government ministries and departments, Bharat Ratna and Padma Vibhushan awardees, and various institutes of excellence in the country. Nominations are submitted between May and September every year.\n\nHistory\n\nThe government of India instituted the Padma Vibhushan, along with the Bharat Ratna, in 1954. The Padma Vibhushan had three classes, which were renamed in 1955 to Padma Shri (for “distinguished service”), the lowest of the three; Padma Bhushan (for “distinguished service of a high order”); and Padma Vibhushan (for “exceptional and distinguished service”), the highest Padma Award.\n\nThe Padma Awards, along with the Bharat Ratna, were suspended twice. The first time was in 1978, when Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai’s government contended that the awards did not conform with Article 18 (Abolition of Titles) of the Indian Constitution, which states: “No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the State.” The awards were reinstated in January 1980, when former prime minister Indira Gandhi returned to office. The awards were suspended again between 1992 and 1997, following litigation that questioned their constitutional validity, again citing Article 18, and were reinstated after the Supreme Court ruled that the Bharat Ratna and the Padma Awards are not titles as defined by Article 18 of the Constitution of India and that they are national in character.\n\nThe Padma Awards Committee\n\nEach year, awardees are selected by a committee that is headed by the cabinet secretary of India and includes the home secretary, the secretary to the president, and four to six prominent persons. The committee submits its recommendations to the prime minister and the president of India for approval.\n\nAward declaration and presentation\n\nThe Padma Awards are announced every year (except a few years when they were interrupted) on the eve of India’s Republic Day, January 26, and are presented by the president of India in March or April at an annual ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the president. Honorees receive a certificate (sanad) signed by the president and a medallion. The names of the awardees are published in The Gazette of India (an official record of the government of India, published by the Department of Publications, part of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs) on the day of the ceremony. The total number of Padma Awards that may be given in a year cannot exceed 120, excluding individuals awarded posthumously, non-resident Indians, foreigners, and overseas citizens of India. The awards are not titles and cannot be used as a suffix or prefix to an awardee’s name.\n\n2023 and 2024 Padma Awards\n\nIn 2023 architect Balkrishna Doshi, pediatrician Dilip Mahalanabis, and veteran political leader Mulayam Singh Yadav were awarded the Padma Vibhushan posthumously. Renowned Indian percussionist and tabla player Zakir Hussain, political leader Somanahalli Mallaiah Krishna, and eminent mathematician S.R. Srinivasa Varadhan also received the Padma Vibhushan in the same year. Nine Padma Bhushan Awards and 91 Padma Shri Awards were conferred that year.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Of the 132 awards for 2024, 30 were awarded to women. The 2024 list included 8 non-resident Indians, foreigners, or overseas citizens of India; 9 awards were conferred posthumously. Padma Subrahmanyam, a renowned bharata natyam dancer; Vyjayantimala Bali and Konidela Chiranjeevi, eminent film personalities; M. Venkaiah Naidu, former vice president of India, and Bindeshwar Pathak (posthumous), founder of social service organization Sulabh International; were conferred the Padma Vibhushan Award. Among the 17 individuals chosen for the Padma Bhushan Award in 2024 were Young Liu, CEO of the Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer Foxconn; veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty; renowned cardiologist Ashwin Balachand Mehta; and popular singer Usha Uthup. The list of people who were awarded the Padma Shri included Parbati Baruah, India’s first female elephant handler (mahout); Gurvinder Singh, a social worker from Haryana; Yanung Jamoh Lego, an individual who has revived the herbal healing practices of the Adi tribe in Arunachal Pradesh; Prema Dhanraj, a burn victim who went on to become a plastic reconstructive surgeon and helped countless burn victims; and Rohan Bopanna, a professional tennis player who, at the age of 43, became the oldest World Number 1 in men’s tennis as he claimed the top spot in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Doubles Rankings declared on January 29, 2024, shortly after he won the 2024 Australian Open doubles championship with Australia’s Matthew Ebden. President Droupadi Murmu presented the Padma Awards for the year in a ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan (President’s House) on April 22, 2024."
