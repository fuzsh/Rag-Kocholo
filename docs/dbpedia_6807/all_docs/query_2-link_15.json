Narasimhan and the Chief Ministers of the two states.<br/><br/>The governor, in his condolence message said Ramanaidu's death created a vacuum not only in Telugu film but also in the film fraternity across India.<br/><br/>Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu expressed deep anguish over the passing away of the legendary producer, and Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao recalled the role played by Ramanaidu in shifting the Telugu film industry to Hyderabad.<br/><br/>Rao, in his condolence message, said the eminent filmmaker by producing movies in different Indian languages introduced many new artists and encouraged them.<br/><br/>Born June 6, 1936, Ramanaidu’s journey as a co-producer started with the 1963 Telugu film 'Anuragam'. Next year, he made his solo debut as a producer with the N.T.

        "text": "United Nations language staff come from all over the globe and make up a uniquely diverse and multilingual community. What unites them is the pursuit of excellence in their respective areas, the excitement of being at the forefront of international affairs and the desire to contribute to the realization of the purposes of the United Nations, as outlined in the Charter, by facilitating communication and decision-making.\n\nUnited Nations language staff in numbers\n\nThe United Nations is one of the world's largest employers of language professionals. Several hundred such staff work for the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management in New York, Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi, or at the United Nations regional commissions in Addis Ababa, Bangkok, Beirut, Geneva and Santiago. Learn more at Meet our language staff.\n\nWhat do we mean by “language professionals”?\n\nAt the United Nations, the term “language professional” covers a wide range of specialists, such as interpreters, translators, editors, verbatim reporters, terminologists, reference assistants and copy preparers/proofreaders/production editors. Learn more at Careers.\n\nWhat do we mean by “main language”?\n\nAt the United Nations, “main language” generally refers to the language of an individual's higher education. For linguists outside the Organization, on the other hand, “main language” is usually taken to mean the “target language” into which an individual works.\n\nHow are language professionals recruited?\n\nThe main recruitment path for United Nations language professionals is through competitive examinations for language positions, whereby successful examinees are placed on rosters for recruitment and are hired as and when job vacancies arise. Language professionals from all regions, who meet the eligibility requirements, are encouraged to apply. Candidates are judged solely on their academic and other qualifications and on their performance in the examination. Nationality/citizenship is not a consideration. Learn more at Recruitment.\n\nWhat kind of background do United Nations language professionals need?\n\nOur recruits do not all have a background in languages. Some have a background in other fields, including journalism, law, economics and even engineering or medicine. These are of great benefit to the United Nations, which deals with a large variety of subjects.\n\nWhy does the Department have an outreach programme?\n\nFinding the right profile of candidate for United Nations language positions is challenging, especially for certain language combinations. The United Nations is not the only international organization looking for skilled language professionals, and it deals with a wide variety of subjects, often politically sensitive. Its language staff must meet high quality and productivity standards. This is why the Department has had an outreach programme focusing on collaboration with universities since 2007. The Department hopes to build on existing partnerships, forge new partnerships, and attract the qualified staff it needs to continue providing high-quality conference services at the United Nations.

I said that his Taiwanese sounded similar to mine. He told me he speaks the Xiamen dialect of Minnanese, not Taiwanese. Taiwanese is a term only people in Taiwan use to refer to the form of Minnanese they speak, but the original term is Minnanese,” one friend said.\n\n“As I recall, the term ‘Taiwanese’ was first coined by Japanese officials during the Japanese colonial era. At that time, prospective educators from Japan studying at Taiwan Provincial Normal Institute [now National Taiwan Normal University] were required to take Taiwanese language classes, as they were to teach Taiwanese students. Japanese police officers were also required to learn the local language so they could communicate with Taiwanese under their jurisdiction. There are several Taiwanese dictionaries that retired Japanese police have compiled,” another replied.\n\nHowever, semantically, Taiwanese refers to the language of Taiwan, but Taiwan has many languages.\n\n“The early Austronesians in Taiwan spoke 10 to 20 distinct languages. Later, immigrants from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in China’s Fujian Province brought Minnanese of various dialects to Taiwan. The Hakka were the next ethnic group to travel in large numbers to Taiwan, bringing their own Hakka language, of which the Hailu, Sixian, Raoping, Dabu and Zhao’an are dialects. These are all languages of Taiwan, so why is only Minnanese considered Taiwanese?” one of the friends asked.\n\n“It is because descendants of Fujian immigrants make up the majority of Taiwan’s population today,” a friend answered.\n\n“Then why is it not called ‘Taiwanese Minnanese?’” another person asked.\n\n“Minnanese is a discriminatory term. The Chinese character for Min (閩) contains the character for insect (chong, 虫). It was a name the early Central Plains people in China used for surrounding ethnic groups. We should not use it,” a friend answered.\n\n“True, but this term has already become commonplace. It is fine to just keep the original meaning in mind. More than 1,100 years ago, during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, one of the kingdoms was called Min. Are you saying they called themselves insects?” a friend asked.\n\n“Taiwanese and Minnanese are different languages from different language families. They contain many different terms and pronunciations,” a friend answered.\n\n“The Zhangzhou and Quanzhou dialects have pronunciation differences. Are they also of different language families? The Hailu and Sixian dialects of Hakka also have their differences. Are they not from the same family as well?” another person asked.\n\n“I remember when the Chinese writer Lin Yutang (林語堂) moved to Taiwan in 1965. He said hearing locals speak Minnanese in Taipei made him feel at home. Born in Fujian, his mother tongue was Minnanese and he could understand what Taiwanese were saying. Are these from different language families?” a friend asked.\n\n“Exactly. If I can effectively converse with someone from Xiamen, why are our languages considered different language families?” one asked.\n\n“American English, Australian English and British English all have different accents. Even their word choices sometimes differ, such as ‘football’ and ‘soccer,’ but they are all known as being part of the English language,” a friend said.\n\n“The language Americans speak could be called ‘Americanese,’” another said.\n\n“Sure, but they probably would not call it ‘American Americanese.’ Using ‘Taiwanese’ is one thing, but why call it ‘Taiwan Taiwanese?’ Minnanese as spoken in Singapore is called Hokkien, the word derived from the Hokkien pronunciation of the Sinitic characters for ‘Fujian.’ Why do they hot call it ‘Singapore Singaporeanese?’” the person asked.\n\n“I also thhttps://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2024/08/17/2003822346ink the inclusion of ‘Taiwan’ is illogical. Should we also start saying ‘Singaporean Taiwanese,’ ‘Xiamen Taiwanese,’ or ‘Quanzhou Taiwanese?’” another asked.\n\n“It is to distinguish Taiwan Taiwanese from ‘Taiwanese Hakka,” another said.\n\n“Then we can say ‘Taiwanese Hakka’ and ‘Taiwanese Minnanese,’” a friend said.\n\n“However, ‘Minnanese’ is still a discriminatory term,” another said.\n\n“Perhaps we can use the term ‘Hokkien’ or ‘Hoklo,’” the friend replied.\n\nThe discussion went round and round with everyone having their own opinions on what to call the language spoken in Taiwan. We did not come to a conclusion.\n\nLee Hsiao-feng is an honorary professor at the National Taipei University of Education.\n\nTranslated by Nicole Wong\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2024/08/17/2003822346\n\n\"Language Enabled interpreter Airmen play a key role building partnerships abroad, but there are too few in Japanese and Ukrainian.\n\nAug. 12, 2024 | By David Roza\n\nPhilippine Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Jimmy Larida has partnered with the U.S. Marine Corps in 34 exercises over the course of his career, but something special happened in 2022 during the large-scale exercise called Kamandag 6.\n\nUnlike previous editions, this one featured Language-Enabled Airman Program (LEAP) scholars, a program in the Air Force Culture and Language Center (AFCLC) where Airmen and Guardians with significant experience in a foreign language can serve as cultural and linguistic experts for their fellow service members.\n\nAt Kamandag 6, LEAP scholars helped bridge the cultural gap between the American and Filipino Marines and translate military jargon so the two camps could work more closely together. Larida said the LEAP scholars “are truly one of us.”\n\n“It has made a huge difference,” he said in an October press release. “My marines trust them, and my marines are drawn to them. This needs to happen, every single time from here on out.”\n\nThat kind of connection not only helps at a tactical exercise, it is also an essential part of the U.S. National Defense Strategy, which notes integration with partners and allies as a cornerstone of deterring near-peer rivals such as Russia and China, especially considering the vast areas of the Pacific and Europe that the U.S. cannot secure alone.\n\n“Mathematically, I’m not sure that any of this actually works if we’re not able to work at the highest levels of integration with our partners and allies,” said AFCLC head and retired Air Force Col. Walter Ward.\n\nThe program is in high demand; there are 3,750 LEAP scholars across 101 languages, and 2,000 of those scholars are fully trained in the program while the rest are in development. About 70 percent of those 2,000 scholars have used their skills in work with allies and partners, according to AFCLC data.\n\n“I will never do another bilateral exercise without requesting the language and cultural expertise that LEAP was able to provide,” U.S. Marine Corps Col. Thomas Siverts said after Kamandag 6.\n\nThe problem is that there are only so many LEAP scholars to go around, especially in Japanese and Ukrainian, the demand for which “has gone through the roof in the last couple of years,” Ward said. While AFCLC has new mechanisms to track demand and stretch the capability of LEAP scholars, the best long-term solution may be to accelerate LEAP’s growth.\n\n“Do we need to get bigger and do we need to get bigger faster? Yes,” Ward said, acknowledging the Air Force has a long list of priorities to juggle. “If we have a strategy that hinges on incorporating partners and allies, at every stage of planning, campaigning and force development … I can’t see a pathway without those skills.”\n\nConstant Conversations\n\nBack at AFCLC headquarters at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala., about 20 employees manage nearly 4,000 LEAP scholars around the world. The center came up with its own system for military units to request LEAP assistance and for AFCLC to fill those requests without tasking authority or owning forces. Under the training partnership request process (TPR), requesting units fill out a form online specifying the rank and language of the LEAP scholar they need and how long they need the scholar for. Then the center matches a scholar to the request.\n\nBesides streamlining the process, the system also helps track LEAP demand: AFCLC fills a request from combatant commands every 1.19 days said Chris Chesser, chief of the center’s language division. On top of that, LEAP scholars use a self-reporting utilization tool to document how they use their language and culture skills outside of the TPR process.\n\n“From just the past two years, LEAP scholars have self-reported utilization in 123 countries and 79 languages,” Chesser said.\n\nBut some languages have fewer scholars to meet the demand than others. There are just 241 Japanese LEAP scholars helping build a partnership with Japan, a bond that U.S. Indo-Pacific Command leaders say is crucial to security in the region. As Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on, so too does the demand for the 64 Ukrainian LEAP scholars who can help.\n\n“There’s just no shortage of demand,” said Ward, to the extent that AFCLC is cross-training Russian speakers with some Ukrainian skills to try to swell the ranks.\n\nThe Air Force could hire more interpreters, but they may not speak aircraft maintenance, acquisition, medicine, or other military subjects the U.S. needs to work on with partners.\n\n“Contract interpreters speak the target language and presumably English, but every LEAP scholar speaks at least three languages: English, the target language, and Air Force,” Ward said. “Your typical dinnertime conversation probably didn’t involve words like fragmentary warhead or load-bearing capacity. So even if you speak a language, it can fall apart quickly when a conversation is technical and time-compressed.”\n\nTo try to stretch the capability of existing LEAP scholars, AFCLC is developing a flight lead/wingman concept, where a trained-up LEAP scholar oversees two colleagues who took the Defense Language Proficiency Test in Ukrainian, for example, but who may not have passed through LEAP’s language and culture mentorship or immersion programs.\n\n“Take the expert that has specialized training to others who are willing and able and have some talent,” Ward explained. “They can coach them up and make the same assets go a lot further.”\n\nNext Steps\n\nInterest in joining LEAP is high: every year the program gets about four applications for each one of the roughly 400 new spots it can support. Speaking in early July in the middle of the year’s application window, Ward said the program had received 20 percent more applications in 2024 than it had the year before with two weeks still left to go.\n\nThe program’s current mandate is to grow to about 4,000 LEAP scholars by 2026, but Ward said their model is highly scalable, “and we could grow that to whatever number that you want.”\n\nIn the meantime, AFCLC hopes to establish better metrics for tracking language and culture competencies across the service. Today, the system does not track those skills for Airmen and Guardians after they graduate basic military training, Ward explained.\n\n“If we mean what we say about interoperability with partners and allies, we can’t let that talent be dormant out there,” he said. “We’ve got to find it and deliberately develop it.”\n\nThe retired colonel made a business case for LEAP: where a contract interpreter can cost more than $100 per hour on top of the logistics of moving them to the requesting unit’s location, a LEAP scholar “will recover every penny that we will ever spend on their development and then some.”\n\nLanguage and culture skills, he added, “is as essential to the application of lethal effects as it is to basic partnership-building and coming to the agreements that we need to go apply them,” he said. “This is the asymmetric capability that our adversaries can’t match and can’t counter.”\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://www.airandspaceforces.com/air-force-interpreter-airmen-demand/\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — A Tennessee immigrant rightsImmigrant rights group files federal complaint over limited language options on Tennessee’s driver license test\n\nby: Tori Gessner\n\nPosted: Aug 15, 2024 / 05:32 PM CDT\n\nUpdated: Aug 15, 2024 / 05:32 PM CDT\n\ncoalition claims a Tennessee agency is violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 due to the lack of language access on the state’s driver license test.\n\nThe Our State, Our Languages coalition (OSOL), which is a coalition of grassroots, community organizations that came together in the summer of 2022, filed a federal complaint against the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security’s Driver Services Division, arguing the state fails to provide “meaningful access” to different languages on the driver’s test.\n\nTennessee’s written driver license test is currently offered in five languages — English, Spanish, German, Japanese, and Korean, with the last three added after car manufacturers moved to the state. Meanwhile, the most widely spoken languages in Tennessee, including Arabic, aren’t offered, according to OSOL.\n\n📧 Have breaking news come to you: Subscribe to News 2 email alerts →\n\n“Think of the real-life consequences of not being able to take the test in the language that you speak,” Sabina Mohyuddin, the executive director of the American Muslim Advisory Council said.\n\nOSOL argues the lack of language access is more than a roadblock for those with limited English proficiency — it’s a civil rights violation and goes against federal guidance.\n\nFederal guidelines recommend federally-funded state agencies provide translation and interpretation services if 5% of the population or 1,000 people have limited English proficiency. The coalition claims under that guidance, languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Vietnamese, Swahili, and Kurdish should be added to Tennessee’s test.\n\n“Our complaint is based on not providing meaningful access. It’s not that nothing is being provided. It’s not meaningful,” Diana Sanchez-Vega, founder and CEO of Sanchez-Vega Communications said. “From the moment someone walks into a driver services center, they should be able to interact with the front desk person in a way that they can meaningfully access that information so that they can meaningfully access those services.”\n\nOSOL conducted an in-person and over-the-phone test to compile consistent data before filing the federal complaint. The group said the results showed those with limited English proficiency who didn’t have access to tests in their native languages faced numerous negative consequences due to the language barrier, including failing the driver’s test multiple times, losing their jobs, and struggling to care for their families.\n\n“Community members regularly share how a parent cannot pick their sick kid up from school, how someone cannot attend a job interview because their ride fell through, how a community member cannot take a sick parent to the emergency department; how one family has no food for dinner because their ride is delayed at their job and will arrive after the store closes,” Sanchez-Vega said.\n\n“We had a Kurdish gentleman go into the driver services, and the staff there was sympathetic because the driver’s test is not offered in the Kurdish language, but the staff said, ‘Try going to another state,'” Mohyuddin said.\n\nNeighboring states, like Kentucky, offer its driver’s license test in 20 languages, according to the state’s website. Virginia offers its driver’s test in 26 languages.\n\nMeanwhile, Tennessee eliminated multiple language options on its driver’s license test in the 1990’s, and last legislative session, some lawmakers tried to make the driver’s license test English only. However, the bill failed.\n\nNews 2 reached out to the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security for an interview or statement in response to the allegations in the federal complaint, but had not heard back by the time this article was published. OSOL said the department has previously cited cost as a concern in adding more language options.\\\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://www.wkrn.com/news/tennessee-news/tn-driver-license-test-limited-language-options-federal-complaint/\n\n\"Misha Tadd, a distinguished sinologist specializing in Lao Tzu (571-470 BC), also known as Laozi for both his name and his philosophical book Tao Te Ching, is all set to release his latest research achievement on the masterpiece.\n\nThe work, also called Laozi, emphasizes the pursuit of natural transformation and truth, while cautioning against wasteful efforts in ways that do not align with the cosmic order.\n\nThis philosophy stands as one of the most profound and influential thoughts in China, with key tenets including noninterference governance and harmonizing with nature.\n\nTadd mainly does research on the book, and the new attempt will be a re-edited and compiled 245-page Latin version of Tao Te Ching from 1729.\n\nWith his upcoming book, Tadd, a native of the United States and an associate professor as well as the director of the Global Laozegetics Research Center at Nankai University, is expected to bring fresh attention to the classic work to the global research community.\n\nSince founding the center in April 2023, the first of its kind in the field of Laozi studies worldwide at Nankai University, Tadd has garnered global interest, with 64 consultants, including foreign experts from 13 countries such as Thailand, Germany, Denmark, and the United States.\n\nHis book, The Complete Bibliography of Laozi Translations: A Global Laozegetics Reference, which delves into 2,052 translated versions of Tao Te Ching in 97 languages, has made waves in the mainstream media in China.\n\nMedia outlets and prominent philosophy experts have commended Tadd for his research in the exegetics and translations of Laozi, an area that few Chinese philosophy researchers have ventured into but one that merits further study.\n\nChen Guying, a 90-year-old philosophy expert at Peking University, has remarked at various academic forums, saying, \"I have amassed around 300 versions of Laozi in various languages. I estimated there were 500-600 translated versions worldwide. My acquaintance with Tadd has revealed a significantly greater number of translations in existence.\"\n\nSince the establishment of the center, Tadd has gradually acclimated to the high regard from the Chinese people and adapted to his new working environment.\n\nTadd, 44, said he started to explore Chinese philosophy studies when he started his postal doctoral fellowship at Peking University in 2014.\n\nHe transitioned from traditional methods of Chinese philosophy research to focusing on the crucial need for diverse translations of Laozi.\n\nTadd's fascination with Laozi began at the age of 14 in a library in a small town in Massachusetts, leaving an enduring impact on his academic and professional pursuits.\n\nHe noted, \"Many foreigners, even by those in Iran, have embraced Laozi. During my studies, I encountered 41 translated works on Laozi in that Islamic country.\"\n\nGerman philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) collaborated with researchers and translators on an 81-chapter translation of Laozi, completing only eight chapters, a fact that he found regretful.\n\nThe influence of Laozi extends beyond academia, with figures like British musician George Harrison (1943-2001) incorporating Laozi's words into one of his songs.\n\nThe popular US film Kung Fu Panda also champions the concept of power of softness, a central tenet of Laozi.\n\nTadd highlighted that Laozi's teachings offer a universal outlook on life, \"making them easily accessible to foreigners compared to other Chinese philosophies with more historical complexities.\"\n\nIn his research, Tadd observed that while some foreigners are drawn to traditional Chinese medicine and practices like tai chi, the impact of Laozi's philosophy transcends mere cultural elements.\n\nCurrently, as the director of a prestigious university's research center, Tadd is adapting to managing an array of responsibilities and collaborations with global experts.\n\nHe reflects on the need to balance research and management, a decision influenced by the wisdom of Laozi.\n\nyangcheng@chinadaily.com.cn\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202408/15/WS66bd3892a3104e74fddba04f.html\n\n\"Courts will translate more documents, boost training after the U.S. Department of Justice found non-English speakers were denied access.\n\nMonmouth County courts entered into an agreement with federal authorities to resolve allegations the vicinage discriminated against residents with limited English language proficiency.\n\nThe agreement, approved Tuesday and announced Thursday, settles claims that the Monmouth vicinage failed to provide assistance to residents with limited proficiency in English, thereby depriving them of access to courts there based on race or national origin in violation of the federal Civil Rights Act.\n\n“People with limited English proficiency can lose their children, homes and fundamental rights when they face language barriers in our court systems,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement. “The Civil Rights Division will continue fighting to ensure that courts remove language barriers for the public.”\n\nThe agreement will require the judiciary to provide a list of reforms to improve access for residents with limited English proficiency by Sept. 12 and it must implement those reforms no more than 120 days after they are approved by the Department of Justice.\n\nIt mandates that judiciary workers who may encounter residents with limited English receive training on how to identify and aid such residents, as well as court requirements on remote and on-site interpreters, among other things.\n\n“Dispensing justice fairly and equitably is a cornerstone of our democratic system,” said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger. “We remain committed to ensuring that all litigants in New Jersey have equal access to New Jersey’s court system regardless of language barriers.\n\nThe deal requires the judiciary to continue translating forms and documents to Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian-Creole, Korean, and Polish — the five languages most commonly spoken by court users with limited English.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the judiciary had translated 167 forms into Spanish and 66 forms to the other four languages.\n\n“The Judiciary, like the Department of Justice, is committed to ensuring equal access to the courts for all. Many of the improvements detailed in the memorandum were already in place,” said state courts spokesman Pete McAleer.\n\nHe added the Monmouth vicinage had already taken steps to comply with the agreement and would continue to do so.\n\nThe memorandum will additionally require the judiciary to pay $89,718 to a court worker who alleged retaliation after raising concerns about court access for non-English speakers, and it requires the courts to excise mentions of discipline the worker faced over the complaint from their personnel files.\n\nAs is typical of such agreements, the memorandum does not include an admission or declaration of guilt.\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/feds-state-resolve-allegations-that-monmouth-courts-discriminated-against-people-with-poor-english-skills/\n\n\"Published Aug. 14, 2024 By Matthew Olay DOD News \"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr., today explained how incorporating the concept of integrated deterrence — the Defense Department's planning, coordinating and operating with all government agencies, as well as allies and partners — is key to meeting the challenges of an increasingly complex strategic environment.\n\nBrown discussed the concept while delivering a keynote speech at the 2024 U.S. Strategic Command Deterrence Symposium in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a mindset shift when it comes to how we think about deterrence,\" Brown told the crowd, noting that the geopolitical landscape of today is more complex than that of the Cold War era.\n\n\"Instead of a bipolar world, we're facing multiple adversaries and malignant actors that create an increasingly complex strategic environment challenging our deterrence framework,\" Brown continued. \"[That] means our strategies need to be networked, dynamic, adaptable and integrated.\"\n\nBrown labeled integrated deterrence as a cornerstone of the National Defense Strategy.\n\n\"Integrated deterrence means leveraging all powers of our nation; aligning our policies, investments and activities; and adapting our efforts to specific competitors as a holistic deterrence strategy,\" Brown said.\n\n\"We need to act with urgency now before we find ourselves needing to innovate in the midst of a major conflict,\" he continued.\n\n\"We need to act like we're in a crisis, before the crisis.\"\n\nTo achieve such deterrence, Brown said DOD needs to focus on three key areas: our adversaries' cognition and culture; the ever-evolving information environment; and the impacts of advancing technology.\n\nOn the topic of cognition and culture, Brown said that deterrence is based on the perceptions of our adversaries and how such perceptions can influence risk and reward-based decisions to create conflict in the pursuit of their national interests.\n\n\"But in determining these perceptions lies the challenge,\" Brown said. \"To accomplish this, we must understand the culture of our adversaries — their view of history, their collective values and the semantics of their language.\"\n\nStating that cognition and culture determine how our adversaries perceive information, Brown then discussed how the recent revolution in communication technology has significantly changed the information environment.\n\n\"We live in an era where the U.S. deterrence messaging can potentially be undermined through cyberoperations and information warfare, complicating the task of maintaining credible deterrence — and the global information ecosystem's fragmentation has made it increasingly more difficult to project a unified stance,\" Brown cautioned.\n\n\"These dynamics require an unprecedented level of coordination to ensure that United States' messages — in coordination with our allies and partners — are not only heard but are also accurately interpreted to achieve the desired deterrent effect,\" he said.\n\nOn the third topic of advancing technology, Brown pointed out how the character of war has been changed by the proliferation of new capabilities among state and non-state actors.\n\n\"New technologies have the potential to shorten viable response times in the event of an attack, changing the calculus and challenging the equilibrium on which global security relies,\" Brown said.\n\n\"We need to collectively deepen our understanding of the emerging technologies — both the opportunities and the vulnerabilities — so we can shape the international norms of behavior,\" he added.\n\nBrown's speech culminated in a call for integrated deterrence to be achieved through a joint, seamless alignment of all elements of national strength — what he said has been called a \"symphony of power\" by former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.\n\n\"Integrated deterrence is not just about possessing advanced technology and superior firepower — that is just one part of the orchestra,\" Brown said, adding that truly integrated deterrence requires harnessing the full power of government by drawing on all interagency capabilities and aligning all our national strengths.\n\n\"And by taking these steps along with our allies and partners, we forge an integrated deterrence,\" Brown said, closing out his remarks.\n\n\"And through that symphony of power, we ensure a future where deterrence prevails — safeguarding peace and security for all.\"\n\nNow in its 15th year, the Aug. 13-14 Stratcom Deterrence Symposium sought to draw from \"academic, government, military and international experts, to explore a broad range of deterrence issues and thinking,\" according to the command's webpage.\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://www.315aw.afrc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3874616/integrated-deterrence-is-key-to-meeting-challenge-of-future-conflicts-brown-says/\n\n\"A new study now published in Science reveals that the memory for a specific experience is stored in multiple parallel “copies”. These are preserved for varying durations, modified to certain degrees, and sometimes deleted over time, report researchers at the University of Basel.\n\nThe ability to turn experiences into memories allows us to learn from the past and use what we learned as a model to respond appropriately to new situations. For this reason, as the world around us changes, this memory model cannot simply be a fixed archive of the good old days. Rather, it must be dynamic, changing over time and adapting to new circumstances to better help us predict the future and select the best course of action. How the brain could regulate a memory’s dynamics was a mystery – until multiple memory copies were discovered.\n\nProfessor Flavio Donato's research group at the Biozentrum, University of Basel, uses mouse models to investigate how memories are stored in the brain and how they change throughout life. His team has now revealed that in the hippocampus, a brain region responsible for learning from experience, a single event is stored in parallel memory copies among at least three different groups of neurons, which emerge at different stages during embryonic development.\n\nMemory copies come and go, and change with time\n\nFirst to arrive during development, the early-born neurons are responsible for the long-term persistence of a memory. In fact, even though their memory copy is initially too weak for the brain to access, it becomes stronger and stronger as time passes. Also in humans, the brain might have access to such memory only some time after its encoding.\n\nIn contrast, the memory copy of the same event created by the late-born neurons is very strong at the beginning but fades over time, so that if one waits long enough, such a copy becomes inaccessible to the brain. In the middle ground, among neurons emerging in between the two extremes during development, a more stable copy could be observed.\n\nSurprisingly, which copy is used might also be linked to how easy it is to change a memory – or to use it to create a new one. The memories stored for a short time after acquisition by the late-born neurons can be modified and rewritten. This means that remembering a situation shortly after it has happened primes the late-born neurons to become active and integrate present information within the original memory. On the contrary, remembering the same event after a long time primes the early-born neurons to be re-activated to retrieve their copy, but the associated memory can no longer easily be modified. “How dynamically memories are stored in the brain is proof of the brain’s plasticity, which underpins its enormous memory capacity”, says first author Vilde Kveim.\n\nFlexible memories enable appropriate behavior\n\nFlavio Donato’s research team has thus demonstrated that the activation of specific memory copies and their timing could have significant consequences on how we remember, change, and use our memories. “The challenge the brain faces with memory is quite impressive. On one hand, it must remember what happened in the past, to help us make sense of the world we live in. On the other, it needs to adapt to changes happening all around us, and so must our memories, to help us make appropriate choices for our future”, says Flavio Donato.\n\nPersistence through dynamics is a delicate act to balance, one for which we might now have an entry point to fully understand. The researchers hope that one day, understanding what drives memories to be encoded and modified in the brain might help to soften those memories that are pathologically intrusive in our daily life, or bring back some that we thought lost forever.\n\nThe ability to turn experiences into memories allows us to learn from the past and use what we learned as a model to respond appropriately to new situations. For this reason, as the world around us changes, this memory model cannot simply be a fixed archive of the good old days. Rather, it must be dynamic, changing over time and adapting to new circumstances to better help us predict the future and select the best course of action. How the brain could regulate a memory’s dynamics was a mystery – until multiple memory copies were discovered.\n\nJournal\n\nScience\n\nArticle Title\n\nDivergent Recruitment of Developmentally Defined Neuronal Ensembles Supports Memory Dynamics.\n\nArticle Publication Date\n\n15-Aug-2024\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1054684"
