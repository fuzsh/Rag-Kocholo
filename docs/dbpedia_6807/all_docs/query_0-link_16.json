        "text": "Daggubati Ramanaidu who has been hailed from a rural family has become a Guinness Book Of Records holder for producing the highest number of films along with establishing a film studio. He founded Suresh Productions in 1964 which became one of the largest film production companies in India. He produced more than 150 films in 13 languages.\n\nRamanaidu established his own production house Suresh Productions, and produced Ramudu Bheemudu with NTR in a dual role in 1964. The film became a blockbuster at the box office and then he went on producing films such as Pratigna Palana (1965), Sri Krishna Tulabharam (1966), Stree Janma (1967), Paapa Kosam (1968) and Sepoy Chinnaiah (1969). After a string of failures he made Prem Nagar with ANR in 1971. It became a huge blockbuster and revived his career as a producer. He remade it in Tamil as Vasantha Maligai and Prem Nagar in Hindi. Both became huge successes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs all the studios were based in Madras at that time, he started \"Ramanaidu Studios\" in Hyderabad with the help of the state government in 1983. While frequently making films in Telugu and Tamil, he branched out into the Kannada, Hindi, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali, Oriya, Gujarati, Bhojpuri, Assamese and Punjabi languages.\n\nThere are numerous hits, super hits and blockbusters he has produced under his banner. In 2012, Ramanaidu was conferred with the third-highest civilian award of India, Padma Bhushan, in recognition for his contribution to Indian cinema. In 2009, he was conferred with the Dada Saheb Phalke Award, the highest award for films in Indian cinema. His sons Suresh Babu became a popular producer and another son Venkatesh, a successful star hero."
