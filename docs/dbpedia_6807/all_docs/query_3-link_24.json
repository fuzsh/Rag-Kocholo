They are presented in three categories: Padma Vibhushan (for exceptional and distinguished service), Padma Bhushan (distinguished service of higher order), and Padma Shri (distinguished service).\n\nThese awards aim to acknowledge outstanding achievements across various fields that involve an element of public service.\n\nThe Padma Awards are granted based on recommendations put forth by the Padma Awards Committee, formed annually by the Prime Minister. This committee, led by the Cabinet Secretary, consists of key officials such as the Home Secretary, Secretary to the President, and four to six distinguished individuals. Following the committee's recommendations, the final approvals are sought from the Prime Minister and the President of India.\n\nIn the previous year, the government announced a total of 106 Padma Awards, which included three cases involving duos.
