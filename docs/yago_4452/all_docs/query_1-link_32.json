        "text": "posted October 03, 2012 06:15 AM Yesterday I was thinking what might happen if a highly Uranian (esp. in regards to Moon and Venus) individual meets someone else, with whom they share strong Plutonic links.\n\nWould they be repelled by each other? Insanely attracted? Repulsed and attracted at the same time?\n\nWhat would be needed astrologically to keep an Uranian \"planted\" - emotionally, as much as that is even possible.\n\nThe couple that came to mind were Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, as I remember him having a Venus-Uranus-conjunction and well he definitely has had quite some reputation before getting married. *laughing*\n\n(actually now that I think abuot it, did not LIz Taylor had Venus-Uranus-conjunction, too?)\n\nAnyway, so he was flitting through life, the eternal bachelor, until he met her.\n\nApparently he said: \"\"Meeting for lunch in San Pietro, a pizza restaurant in a mini-mall near his office in Beverly Hills, Beatty says that he knew within minutes that she [Annette] was the one. Long past due to settle down, \"I was looking for someone to make me good\" is how Beatty puts it.\"\n\nSource: Christopher Goodwin. \"Taming of the screw.\" The Evening Standard. 3/7/2002.\"\n\nOf course I have no idea how happy they are with each other, but they`ve been married for 20 years I think.\n\nSo what is there going on astrologically.\n\nFirst of all, Beatty`s natal configurations:\n\n1)\n\nVenus conjunct Uranus in Taurus in 8th house\n\nquinkunx\n\nMars in SAgittarius in 3rd house\n\nThere actually is an interesting split in Beatty`s chart.\n\nYes, his bachelorhood can be easily seen by his Venus-Uranus-conjunction (and Uranus in 8th house), and tied to Mars in Sagittarius.\n\nAnd looking at the asteroids, isn`t it interesting that asteroid CUPIDO is EXACTLY on his Aries-Sun?\n\nPlus the asteroid LUST falls right onto the midpoint of his KARMA-NN-trine, sextile to both, and is on 18 Aquarius in 5th house.\n\nOn the other hand he also ha some very intense natal configurations, esp. involving Pluto.\n\n1)\n\nMoon conjunct LILITH (the Black Moon, I donÂ´t use the asteroid in synastry) in Scorpio\n\ntrine Pluto in Cancer\n\nsextile Jupiter in Capricorn\n\nand Pluto is opposite Jupiter\n\nhe also has:\n\n3)\n\nEROS on 28 Aqua conjunct UNION on 27 Aqua\n\nsextile\n\nNESSUS on 27 Aries\n\nquinkunx\n\nPluto on 26 Cancer\n\nAnd yes that obviously means he has a square of retro Nessus to retro Pluto. Whoa.\n\nAnd EROS and LUST both in Aqua def. resonate with the Uranustheme in terms of his Venus.\n\n----------------------\n\nno matter what the synastry will show, I strongly doubt that he would ever have settled down with a woman who does NOT resonate with uranus, in the very least it seems to indicate he needs someone able to do her own stuff and give him space, someone who is independent and does not DEPEND on him, but at the same time she probably would need a lot of inner strength, maturity and capacity of compassion and unconditional love.\n\nChecking for Bening`s chart what I see is this:\n\n1) she has\n\nSun on 7 GEmini\n\nopposite\n\nLUST on 8 Sag\n\nsextile/trine\n\nUranus on 8 Leo\n\nNow, if THAT Doesn`t fit the bill!\n\nDoesn`t look like she might get too clingy.\n\nShe also has a configuration speaking of seriousness, and a more sober and responsible kind. Not an easy one by any means though.4\n\nMars on 23 Pisces\n\nsquare\n\nSaturn on 23 Sagittarius\n\ntrine/quink\n\nJUNO on 25 Cancer\n\nAnd this very interesting configuration.\n\nKARMA on 15 Gemini conjunct UNION on 16 Gemini conjunct AMOR on 14 Gemini\n\nsquare\n\nEROS on 16 Pisces\n\nWell, where her husband has Union conjunct EROS she has AMOR there. Seems she has the capacity for unconditional love and it is part of what an union requires for her, though being in Gemini, still not the clingy kind.\n\nI find it intersting how both have love asteroids highlighted in the Air-signs.\n\nAnd one of them mentioned in an interview that one secret of their working relationship is the fact that they have a big house. Exactly what i would expect to hear from someone with Air-signs or Sagittarius emphasised.\n\nposted October 03, 2012 06:29 AM But what is there in their synastry, possibly indicating they might settle with each other?\n\nFirst of all there was one aspect that made me laugh SO hard when I saw it.\n\nher Uranus on 8 Leo squares his Venus-Uranus on 5-7 Taurus\n\nIt seems like he has met his equal here! This is a woman who would NOT like to get tied down, who would like the excitedness, but would not try to \"catch\" him. In a way, if he projected his Uranus onto her, his Venus i Taurus would be a tiy bit freer to express itself.\n\nAnd it is interesting how he seems to be a little more invested in the relationship in interviews than she does.\n\nHe quite possibly met his mach here, who simply reversed the roles.\n\nApart from that:\n\nhis KARMA trine her VALENTINE (1)\n\nhis AMOR conjunct her Sun exact\n\nhis VALENTINE trine her EROS\n\nPut quite simply, he might just love her.\n\nThey share some Uranian aspects as well, which reflect their natals:\n\nhis Sun trine her Uranus\n\nhis Venus square her Uranus\n\nhis Mars trine her Uranus\n\nhis Uranus conjunct her Black Moon Lilith\n\nBut these might have been related to more of a commitment kind of connection:\n\nhis Moon trine her Juno\n\nhis Saturn trine her Juno\n\n- HEr Juno closed a GT water trine between his Moon-Saturn, giving their interaction depth and longevity\n\nOh and her Union-Karma-Amor falls onto his SN.\n\nApart from that interestingly:\n\nhis Jupiter opposite her Juno exact\n\nhis OSIRIS opposite her ISIS exact\n\nBut what I noticed is that they have quite some \"obsessive synastry\"; I was looking at aspects to Pluto, BML and yes, even Nessus for this:\n\nhis Venus conjunct her BML\n\nhis Pluto conjunct her Juno and trine her Mars\n\nhis BML trine her Mars and Juno exact (GT in Water)\n\nhis NESSUS conjunct her Venus exact\n\nhis Moon opposite her NESSUS exact\n\nhis Mars quinkunx her BML exact\n\nhis Pluto square her Venus exact\n\nhis NESSUS square her Juno (2)\n\nPhew witht hese kind of obserssive aspects between them it isprobably good they are quite Uranian/ airy, independent in their love asteroids and Venus.\n\nTwo \"Uranians\" making Plutonic /or BML synastry, quite an interesting mix I think."
