        "text": "After 30 years of marriage, Annette Bening and Warren Beatty are still as in love as ever.\n\nThe “American Beauty” star, 63, stopped by the “Kelly Clarkson Show” earlier this week alongside her “Death on the Nile” director and co-star, Kenneth Branagh.\n\nThe pair discussed each of their plans for Valentine’s Day and shared special traditions they have for the romantic holiday.\n\nBening told host Kelly Clarkson that she and Beatty, 84, like to keep the holiday simple.\n\n“It’s pretty no-pressure,” she said. “Valentine’s is pretty low-key. He will generally make me like a little Valentine with just a little red felt pen and make a little heart. He’s very economical in his message.”\n\nThe “Captain Marvel” star continued, “There’s nothing to buy for him. He’s one of those men, you cannot find anything that he . . . So, no, it’s usually something small; it’s a little note, it’s a flower, yeah.”\n\nAs for Branagh, 61, he has been married to his wife Lindsay Brunnock for 18 years. He jokingly revealed to Clarkson that he does “bad poetry” for Brunnock and her “eyes roll over on Valentine’s Day morning.”\n\nBeatty and Bening have been married since 1992 and have four kids together — Stephen, 30, Ben, 27, Isabel, 25, and Ella, 21. Their oldest child came out as transgender in 2012.\n\nBening dished to People earlier this month about her relationship with the “Rules Don’t Apply” director. She explained that her first impression of the Oscar winner “was that he was incredibly intelligent.”\n\n“I remember thinking ‘Wow, this guy is so smart and so sharp and funny, but more — just articulate,’ ” she said. “He was very talkative [and] was very passionate about the movie that he was about to make. He had a lot to say — and he was charming, for sure.”\n\nHaving children together, she added, “was something I always wanted to do, ever since I was a little kid, the minute I could start babysitting, like 12 or 13, I was the neighborhood babysitter,” Bening said. “It just always felt natural to me. Nothing comes close.”\n\nNow that her kids are all grown up and out of the house, Bening finds herself to be an empty-nester. “Sometimes it’s hard for me to let go and just remember, ‘Oh, that’s not my job anymore,’ ” Bening said.\n\n“I’m so proud of these adult children, who aren’t children, but they’re my kids. They’re all so different, and they’re all out there discovering themselves and their voices. We think we’re there to teach them, and, of course, what we realize is that that they teach us everything.”"
