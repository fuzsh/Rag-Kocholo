        "text": "After 27 years of marriage, you’d think a couple would become bored of each other — but not when it comes to Annette Bening and Warren Beatty.\n\n“We just like to spend time together and talk,” Annette, 60, exclusively told Closer Weekly of their ideal date night. She was attending the opening night Arthur Miller’s All My Sons on Broadway in New York City with her longtime husband in tow. “And talk politics — a lot of politics.”\n\nThe Captain Marvel star and the Reds director, 82, were married on March 3, 1992. They have four children together — sons Stephen, 27, and Benjamin, 24, as well as daughters Isabel, 22, and Ella, 19. Annette was previously married to choreographer J. Steven White from 1984 to 1991.\n\nAnnette said she and Warren aren’t exactly empty nesters yet, despite the house being quieter these days. That’s because they have the “pleasure” of having their kids around a lot. Annette also described her “perfect Mother’s Day” as “just being with” them and Warren.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Warren said his favorite role of Annette’s is seeing her as a wife and mother. When it comes to seeing what she can do on the stage, though, he said “I don’t think there’s a finer actress” — at least for him. As for Mother’s Day, Warren simply said he and their children “do as we’re told!”\n\nAnnette — who has never won an Oscar — said she feels “very, very lucky” to be a part of this production. In fact, her attention is solely on All My Sons these days.\n\n“That’s the joy of doing this kind of work, trying to devote yourself to a play you really believe in,” the four-time Academy Award nominee noted. “I love this play — I have for a long time. I didn’t know if I would get to do it or not. There aren’t that many plays left that I think, ‘Oh, God, if I could do that play.’ This is one of them.”"
