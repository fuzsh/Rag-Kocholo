Its catalog has grown so impressive, in fact, that it’s a bit overwhelming — and at the same time, movies that are included with a Prime subscription regularly change status, becoming available only for rental or purchase. It’s a lot to sift through, so we’ve plucked out 100 of the absolute best movies included with a Prime subscription right now, to be updated as new information is made available.\n\nHere are our lists of the best TV shows and movies on Netflix, and the best of both on Hulu and Disney+.\n\n‘Oppenheimer’ (2023)\n\nThe winner of last year’s Academy Award for best picture, this unorthodox biographical drama from the director Christopher Nolan details the considerable achievements of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the man known as “the father of the atomic bomb,” with both historical sweep and moral nuance. Focusing on a handful of key tension points in Oppenheimer’s eventful life, Nolan deftly weaves a sprawling cast, intertwined timelines and jaw-dropping effects work into an astonishing portrait of both a single man and the world he changed. Nolan and Murphy also won Oscars, as did Robert Downey Jr. in a supporting performance that reminds us of the skilled thespian under the Iron-Man armor. Our critic called it “a great achievement in formal and conceptual terms, and fully absorbing.” (Nolan’s “Interstellar” is also on Prime.)\n\n‘American Graffiti’ (1973)\n\nBetween his debut feature “THX 1138” and the seismic sensation of “Star Wars,” George Lucas made a pit stop in the genre of coming-of-age comedy-drama with this teen-centered smash, which he co-wrote and directed. Set entirely on the last night of high school, circa 1962, “Graffiti” tells several stories of seniors standing on the precipice of “real life,” not sure where to go next. The prescience of the casting is stunning — it’s filled with soon-to-be-stars, including Richard Dreyfuss, Harrison Ford, Ron Howard, Paul Le Mat, Mackenzie Phillips, Suzanne Somers and Cindy Williams — the period music is delightful and the one-crazy-night vibes are immaculate.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
