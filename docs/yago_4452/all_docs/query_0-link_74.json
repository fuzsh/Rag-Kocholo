With no takers, the couple lowered the rental cost to $25,000 one month later. However, The Beattys still had no luck finding any tenants, so they decided to sell the property instead. In 2012, they put their mansion on the real estate marketing with an asking price of $6.955 million.\n\nThe extensive property features 10,600 square feet and sits on 1.1 acres. Originally constructed in 1992 with Mediterranean design influences, the mansion boasts a three-car garage, a pool, and a spa. Warren and his wife lived in the property for many years, having first moved in after their other home was damaged in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Right around the time they put the aforementioned property on the market, they moved back to their previous home (also in Beverly Hills), which had recently been renovated. This home sits on a 6.7-acre plot of land."
