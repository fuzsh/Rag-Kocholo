        "text": "On this thread in the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, this woman wants to know if she's in the wrong for telling her husband she wants a divorce because he refuses to clean up his mess. Here's what went down:\n\n\"I'm at my wits end. Everything changed after marriage and I couldn't tell you why. Our biggest problem is cleaning. My husband used to clean up after himself but after marriage he just completely stopped with no warning. We were dating for three years, engaged for one, and now freshly married. We're 28 and 29.\"\n\n\"After we got married my husband stopped cleaning. He wouldn't pick up after himself, wouldn't do his agreed upon chores and suddenly became a slob. It was like he's been intentionally dirtying things up. I stopped doing all of my housework out of protest a month into our marriage and I now live in complete and utter filth.\"\n\n\"I'm rarely home due to the mess. I live part-time with my sister at this point and he doesn't even care. I come home only to sleep at night and sometimes I don't even come home at all. It's like we aren't even married anymore and it's draining my mental health to the point where I've had multiple breakdowns this month.\"\n\n\"I'm completely over it. I wanted to get married but this is not the man I married. I would much rather be home where I belong, but I'm not a maid.\"\n\n\"The mess is as follows: wet food in the sink from him throwing his plate (finished or not) in there, bugs, garbage littered everywhere, puddles of mystery substances, the trash is never taken out, all of his laundry is dirty, clothes unfolded, crumbs galore, takeout everywhere since he won't cook, dishes piled to the skies. I can guarantee you there's more but I can't describe it right.\"\n\n\"It's like he's a toddler. It's exactly like mummy isn't cleaning up so he's tornadoing through our house and not caring. Before he would scrape his plate, rinse it, then leave it. He would take the trash outside and take the cans to the curb, he'd sweep, vacuum, occasionally do laundry and he would never eat in the bed.\"\n\n\"A few hours ago I told him that if he doesn't clean up tonight then I'm divorcing him tomorrow. I said if I don't see some progress on the house then we're over.\"\n\n\"He told me that I'm being an asshole for no reason and that cleaning is no longer his job. I nearly popped a blood vessel. We did not decide on that. He's telling me that I'm throwing everything away over pride and that all new marriages go through this transition.\"\n\n\"He told his mum and she called me not too long ago and told me that I need to calm down and reconcile. I really love my mother-in-law and she's one of the most level-headed people I know, hence the reason I'm writing this post. She's making me wonder if divorce is too far because it's only mess, but it is a mess.\"\n\n\"She told me that we can reach a compromise, need to take a breather and talk about it all, but I truthfully do not want to. She reminded me of our good times and that life won't always be the way it is now, but I'm feeling incredibly skeptical. I cannot stand filth and I can't live like this even if it's for him. AITA?\"\n\nOf course, people had a lot to say...\n\nMost users thought that OP (original poster) was not the A-hole:\n\n\"NTA , Your husband's behaviour is completely unacceptable. It's one thing to have different cleaning standards, but it's another entirely to actively refuse to contribute to a shared living space. The level of filth you're describing is not just messy; it's unsanitary and disrespectful.\"\n\nu/BabyyyyCute\n\n\"The part where he says he doesn't have to clean now that he's married is especially bothersome. He truly believes this and will never change.\"\n\nu/EDJardin\n\n\"He was on his best, fake behaviour until he trapped you in marriage then he let his true self come out. You are now married to the real person he always was. Everything that came before was a lie.\n\nHe has shown you who he really is. Believe him. You are not throwing everything away over pride. He's a filthy toddler and that is not what you expected to marry. It is NOT 'only a mess'. Do not believe you mother-in-law She was probably happy to be rid of him. Again, BELIEVE HIM. You're seeing the REAL him.\n\nDivorce him. Your life will not change or get better. His comment made that perfectly clear. Don't waste any more of your time. You are totally NTA.\"\n\nu/JanetInSpain\n\n\"The 'no longer his job' line made me want to drive you to the attorney's office to start the divorce.\"\n\nu/Zealousideal_Mood118\n\nOthers thought OP was the A-hole:\n\n\"YTA. For better for worse. Hire someone to clean and make him pay. Everyone wants to get divorces over things that can be remedied. I'm so tired of reading these posts.\"\n\nu/poppabear8888\n\n\"NTA as long as you actually follow through. YTA if you just use this as a casual threat when you get mad.\"\n\nu/SatansAnus7\n\n\"YTA. You're not considering that this is bigger than cleaning. If he was always cleaning and suddenly stopped, there's something else going on here.\n\nI (a man) can say this has happened to me before and there were big problems in my life that lead me to stop being as clean and tidy as I naturally am. I was generally unhappy with my life.\"\n\nu/throw_away485839\n\nAnd then there are those who think that everyone sucks here:\n\n\"ESH. You don't threaten divorce, you don't protest by matching his behaviour, you communicate. He sucks for saying it's not his job anymore and it's very concerning, but you didn't know that when you decided to match his energy. You both deserve each other.\"\n\nu/GreenArrowCuz\n\n\"Dude, hire a cleaner, make him pay for it. You stopped cleaning also. People expect perfection. Guess you both will have to live with the consequences. Good riddance! A lot of you will throw away a relationship bc it’s not perfect. Perfect only exists on paper. ESH.\"\n\nu/jfern009\n\nMy take? While I agree the word \"divorce\" shouldn't be thrown around so lightly, I do think OP has reached her boiling point within the marriage. For the husband to say that cleaning is no longer his job to excuse the mess just shows a huge level of disrespect on his part. Perhaps some more communication is needed, but I can't say that I blame OP.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?
