I always thought it was because he sensed a cultural shift with the AIDS crisis, that the great lothario image was not gonna work for him anymore. Also, maybe he actually did want a family at that point.\n\n[quote]He was such a pussy hound I can’t believe he remained monogamous\n\nI can't believe she would expect him to be monogamous.\n\nWhat’s up with these WB threads all of a sudden?\n\nIs a divorce about to be announced or what?\n\nSounds like it…\n\nR8, wasn’t Halle before Annette?\n\nI love AB. I just rewatched American Beauty the other day, and she was so fantastic.\n\nLove the scene where Spacey’s taking her and Peter Gallagher’s burgers order.\n\nSuch a great film!"
