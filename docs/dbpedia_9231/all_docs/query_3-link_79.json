        "text": "The Commonwealth of Summit, more commonly known as Summit, is a micronation in Ohio, USA. Summit was founded on August 12, 2020, and is governed by a Prime Minister and President. The Upper House and the House of Exemplaries are the houses that make up the Summit Parliament. The Parliament is responsible for determining if certain bills should be passed, with word from the Prime Minister.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Summit was picked because it is the name of the county in the State of Ohio that it is in. The name was chosen 12 August 2020 by the current Prime Minister.\n\nFlag\n\nThe flag of Summit depicts a diagonal bi-color of white and blue, and a Springbok, the national animal, in the middle. White and blue are the official colors of Summit, with white representing independence and liberty, while blue represents water and life.\n\nPolitics and government\n\nThe Commonwealth of Summit is just as it says, a commonwealth. Summit has two houses that make up the Parliament. The Upper House, and the House of Exemplaries. The House of Exemplaries is currently made up of three people, one from each province in the nation. The Upper House votes on primarily legislative cases and the House of Exemplaries can vote a motion of no confidence against the government, as well as vote for or against any proposed candidate for head of government at the beginning of the parliamentary term. The main and ruling political party is the Summit Green Party, which holds 3/5 seats in the senate.\n\nLaw and order\n\nThe Summitiac judicial system is very similar to the US judicial system, and every citizen has the right to a fair and just trial. There is currently one police agency in the country, which is the Summit National Police Service.\n\nForeign relations\n\nSummit currently has no official diplomatic relations, but is planning to broaden their horizon in the near future.\n\nRecognized micronations\n\nVancouver Island Soviet Socialist Republic\n\nMilitary"
