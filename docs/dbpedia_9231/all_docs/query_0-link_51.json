We know that for the stage and venue operators across the nation that help make this culture happen, the pandemic has been devastating. Too many have been forced to lower the final curtain on their businesses. Today, with more than $16.2 billion available through the Shuttered Venue Operators Grants, help is here,” said SBA Administrator Isabella Casillas Guzman. “The SBA is committed to moving as quickly as possible to deliver this vital funding effectively and equitably - ensuring relief goes to those venue operators whose revenues have been most impacted by the pandemic.”\n\nThe SVOG program was appropriated more than $16.2 billion for grants via the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits and Venues Act and the American Rescue Plan Act. Of these funds, at least than $2 billion is reserved for eligible SVOG applications with up to 50 full-time employees. Eligible applicants may qualify for grants equal to 45% of their gross earned revenue up to a maximum amount of $10 million for a single grant.\n\nThe SBA is accepting SVOG applications on a first-in, first-out basis and allocating applicants to respective priority periods as it receives applications. The first 14 days of SVOG awards, which are expected to begin in late April, will be dedicated to entities that suffered a 90% or greater revenue loss between April and December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The second 14 days (days 15-28) will include entities that suffered a 70% or greater revenue loss between April and December 2020. Following those periods, SVOG awards will include entities that suffered a 25% or greater revenue loss between one quarter of 2019 and the corresponding quarter of 2020.\n\nPrior to the opening tomorrow for SVOG applications, the SBA has hosted a national informational webinar (archived recording) to highlight the application process for potential eligible entities. The agency also provided recurrent program updates and information via frequently asked questions, additional video tutorials, an application checklist, and eligibility requirements through SBA’s dedicated SVOG website - www.sba.gov/svogrant - and targeted outreach to potential applicants.\n\nAs the SBA built the SVOG program from the ground up, it worked closely with its federal partners, including those dedicated to the affected industries such as the National Endowment for the Arts and Institute of Museum and Library Services, and Congressional authors in analyzing the legislation and Congress’ intent. The agency also consulted industry partners, such as the National Independent Venue Association, National Association of Theatre Owners, National Independent Talent Organization, Performing Arts Alliance, Broadway League, American Alliance of Museums and the Associations of Art Museum Directors, Children’s Museums, Science and Technology Centers, and Zoos & Aquariums. The SBA’s collaboration with these organizations has been vital to SBA’s understanding of and guidance for potential SVOG applicants and the agency looks forward to their continued partnership during the launch of the program.\n\nIn addition, SBA’s resource partners, including SCORE Mentors, Small Business Development Centers, Women’s Business Centers and Veterans Business Outreach Centers, are available to provide entities with individual guidance on their applications. Applicants can find a local resource partner via SBA’s website at www.sba.gov/local-assistance or via a zip code at www.sba.gov/localassistance. (Per federal grant program guidelines that the same and equal information needs to be provided to each applicant, SBA’s team members are limited on responses they can provide to individual, specific questions regarding SVOG eligibility, potential grant amount, or other detailed information.)\n\n###\n\nAbout the U.S. Small Business Administration\n\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration makes the American dream of business ownership a reality.

Sullivan County’s 7-day average percentage positive rate is 6.7%, just below Orange County at 7.1%, and that’s got our attention. We are seeing about 30 new positive cases per day.”\n\nThe number of quarantined/isolated people in Sullivan County – 765 as of March 25 – is more than double what it was at the beginning of the month, and two more deaths have been logged just in March, for a total of 68 since the pandemic began a year ago.\n\nBased on population density, the spread can be attributed not to specific places, but to human behavior and congregation of susceptible people. The most important and vital measure people can take to prevent the spread and potential overwhelming of the healthcare system is to get vaccinated when the are eligible, regardless of which vaccine is available. All – Moderna, Pfizer and Janssen – are equally proven to drastically reduce the chances of serious illness, hospitalization and death. Additionally, it is still imperative to wear a mask in public spaces and practice good hand hygiene, as well as social distancing.\n\n“This increase is looking similar to the rise we saw after the holidays, when people discovered they had contracted the virus from a friend or loved one at a party or family gathering,” McGraw observes. “With schools out for spring break this coming week and residents travelling to other states and locales for vacation, we’re concerned this upward trend of active cases will continue.”\n\nPublic Health Services and a range of community providers are actively delivering COVID-19 vaccine doses to thousands of people every week, and as of March 25, 24% of the total population of Sullivan County has completed their full series of vaccinations (one or two shots, depending on the vaccine).\n\n“We have not achieved ‘herd immunity,’ so the risk of widespread community transmission remains very present and very real,” McGraw warns. “We urge everyone – whether they were vaccinated yet or not – to continue wearing masks, social distancing, washing hands regularly, and staying away from close gatherings with people they don’t see daily and/or who are not yet fully vaccinated.”\n\nVaccines are available at pharmacies, hospitals, mass vaccination sites operated by New York State, local health departments, and other providers statewide – please contact your provider of choice to schedule your vaccine appointment. More info is available at www.sullivanny.us/departments/publichealth/covidvaccines.\n\nEligible New Yorkers can receive a vaccination through a network of State-run sites distributing vaccine statewide – to determine eligibility and schedule appointments at New York State-run vaccination sites only, use the “Am I Eligible?” app. Eligible New Yorkers can also make an appointment at a New York State-operated vaccine site at www.ny.gov/vaccine or through the New York State COVID-19 Vaccination Hotline at 1\n\nVaccine information:\n\n*Please check the NYS website for up to date Covid-19 information, including Vaccine eligibility and availability: https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/\n\nAs we receive vaccine info from The County, we will continue to post it on our website. You can sign up with the County to be notified of clinics or call the State hotline from 7am-10pm at 1-833-697-4829. Also, CVS Pharmacy will be administering the vaccine – call their customer service at 800-746-7287.\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\n\nFebruary 26, 2021\n\nGarnet, Public Health Collaborate\n\nto Get Vaccines to More People\n\nHarris, NY – Sullivan County Public Health Services and Garnet Health Medical Center-Catskills continue to partner to mount clinics to get COVID-19 vaccine out to residents.\n\nAs of Friday, February 26, Public Health has administered 2,155 vaccines (which includes 1,617 first doses and 538 second doses of the Moderna vaccine) in just over a month. The majority of these individuals have been essential workers as defined in category 1B by the State, and those age 65 and over.\n\nGarnet Health Medical Center – Catskills has administered 3,600 doses, which includes 1,811 first doses and 1,789 second doses.\n\nBoth groups have partnered since December, even sharing staff and resources through a memorandum agreement. Weekly planning calls are also held to touch base with additional partners, including the Center for Discovery and Sun River Healthcare, and to redistribute vaccine as it becomes available.\n\n“Garnet and Public Health have long been close allies in the constant quest for better health in Sullivan County, and the coronavirus pandemic has brought us even closer,” affirmed Public Health Director Nancy McGraw. “Using our notification list of residents who are eager to be vaccinated, our collaboration will result in several hundred more people receiving their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine this coming week.”\n\nPublic Health expects to receive additional doses early next week from the regional distribution hub in addition to the weekly allocation of 300-400 doses that it has been ordering. Knowing that Public Health has a list of over 10,000 people interested in being vaccinated, Garnet leaders are willing to commit to working in collaboration with the County, utilizing its notification list.

That becomes more difficult to do when approached by passersby who may not be as familiar with social distancing.\n\nSo, please respect social distancing and keep back from O&R work areas and remain at a safe distance from O&R workers.\n\nIn addition, O&R asks its customers who own dogs to keep their dogs on a leash, indoors or otherwise under secure control to avoid the possibility of O&R personnel being bitten while working on customer property.\n\nO&R is well aware that its customers cherish their dogs. Every responsible dog owner knows that even the most even-tempered, gentle dog is capable of biting someone. These days when more family members are home during the day, it makes sense that dogs may feel more protective of their home turf than usual and become more agitated and aggressive when strangers appear outside the home.\n\nThat’s why, to help create the safest environment possible for both O&R employees and customers’ pets, O&R asks its customers to keep dogs on a leash, indoors or otherwise under secure control to avoid the possibility of conflict when O&R workers are present.\n\nThis meeting is now completed.

Javits Center where FEMA has started to build a 1,000-bed temporary hospital that will help increase New York’s hospital capacity to combat COVID-19 and open next week. This is in addition to the four sites selected by the Army Corps of Engineers that will create temporary hospitals in downstate New York with total capacity up to 4,000.\n\nThe Governor also announced that three former Secretaries to the Governor — Steve Cohen, Bill Mulrow and Larry Schwartz — are joining the Governor’s COVID-19 Task Force. Mulrow and Cohen will be tasked with developing a NYS Forward Plan - a strategy to restart the economy following the NYS on Pause executive order. Schwartz is tasked with helping the State acquire healthcare equipment and supplies and increasing New York’s hospital surge capacity.\n\nGovernor Cuomo signed an executive order requiring all hospitals to increase capacity by a minimum of 50 percent, with a goal of increasing capacity by 100 percent.\n\nThe Governor also launched the ’NY Stronger Together’ campaign urging New Yorkers to stay home, stop the spread and save lives. As part of the campaign, celebrities including Robert De Niro, Danny DeVito, Ben Stiller and La La Anthony have sent videos of themselves at home to reinforce the Governor’s message that young people must stay home not for themselves, but to help protect older and more vulnerable New Yorkers. The campaign will also aim to highlight donations from major corporations, celebrities, philanthropic organizations to help increase the state’s supply capacity.\n\nAdditionally, the Governor announced that the state is opening a drive-thru COVID-19 mobile testing facility in the Bronx.\n\nVideo, Audio, Photos & Rush Transcript: https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-initial-delivery-equipment-and-supplies\n\nGovernor Cuomo also signed an executive order requiring all hospitals to increase capacity by a minimum of 50 percent, with a goal of increasing capacity by 100 percent.\n\nNo. 202.10: Continuing Temporary Suspension and Modification of Laws Relating to the Disaster Emergency\n\nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20210-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency\n\nThe link below provides a clear and concise page of how people can help and where they should be direct.\n\nhttps://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/get-involved-how-you-can-help\n\nESD COVID-19 Related Resources https://esd.ny.gov/esd-covid-19-related-resources\n\nIf you believe an employer is in violation of either existing labor laws or recently issued executive orders you can contact the NYS Attorney General’s Office at (212) 416-8700 or Labor.Bureau@ag.ny.gov\n\nGuidance on Coronavirus Resources from AG’s Office https://ag.ny.gov/coronavirus\n\nEmpire State Development (ESD) has created this FAQ to offer information to businesses regarding State regulations and general guidance related to the coronavirus. https://esd.ny.gov/novel-coronavirus-faq-businesses\n\nIf your question is not answered below, please contact ESD at our website at: https://esd.ny.gov/covid-19-help\n\nTo file a complaint with the NYS Department of Human Rights https://dhr.ny.gov/complaint#file\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19): Small Business Guidance & Loan Resources\n\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan Program\n\nhttps://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela/\n\nIf someone is looking for a procurement opportunity, direct them to the procurement form: https://www.governor.ny.gov/content/procurement-form\n\nIf people want to make a donation (including essential goods, services, and/or spaces) please direct them here: https://apps.health.ny.gov/pubpal/builder/survey/nys-covid19-tracking-offers\n\nImportant Numbers/Emails/Links\n\nPrice Gouging hotline: 800-697-1220\n\n24-Hour Coronavirus hotline: 1-888-364-3065\n\nNYS DOH website regarding Coronavirus:\n\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus/\n\nGuidance for Determining Whether a Business Enterprise is Subject to a Workforce Reduction Under Executive Order 202.6\n\nhttps://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026\n\nAssistance of Qualified Medical Professionals Survey:\n\nhttps://apps.health.ny.gov/pubpal/builder/survey/assistance-of-medical-prof\n\nRetired Health Professional Survey:\n\nhttps://apps.health.ny.gov/pubpal/builder/survey/retired-health-professional\n\nCOVID-19 Application For Suspension Of Debt Collection Activity:\n\nhttps://ag.ny.gov/covid-19-debt-suspension-application\n\nHere is the Dedicated ESD waiver email address: COVID19BusinessWaiver@ESD.ny.gov\n\nAmid a shortage of personal protective equipment — or PPE — products in the state, including gloves, masks and gowns, the Governor is asking all PPE product providers to sell to the state any products that are not essential or not currently being used.
