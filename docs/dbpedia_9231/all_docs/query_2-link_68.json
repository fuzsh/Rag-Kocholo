        "text": "ROBERT M. FRIEDLAND's lure was golden.\n\nIn 1985, Mr. Friedland, a young, fair-haired entrepreneur, attracted investors to a small mining company, Galactic Resources Ltd., with promises of an \"historic breakthrough\" that would produce hundreds of millions of dollars worth of gold from a mountain in Summitville, Colo. Such giants as the Bank of America, with $30 million in financing, and the Bechtel Corporation, which agreed to do the engineering and construction, helped get the project under way.\n\nToday, Galactic Resources is bankrupt and the Summitville gold mine, which it ran through a subsidiary, is abandoned. Left behind are about $20 million in unpaid bills and an environmental disaster as grand in scope as Mr. Friedland's words. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates it will cost $100 million to clean up the mine, including millions of gallons of cyanide-contaminated water, and is investigating whether Mr. Friedland and others involved in the project are liable for the damage under the Superfund law. The U.S. Attorney's office in Denver is also looking into the case.\n\nNow, Summitville is figuring prominently in a legislative drama that could alter the future course of mining in the United States.\n\nInterior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has called Summitville an \"extraordinary disaster\" and a prime reason Congress must change the General Mining Act of 1872, adopting tougher environmental and financial standards for mining companies and making them pay substantial royalties on the minerals they remove from Federal land. \"The lesson of Summitville,\" Mr. Babbitt said in a recent interview, is that tighter controls are needed so that companies \"can't just steal away in the middle of the night.\""
