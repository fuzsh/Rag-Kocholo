        "text": "The Shawangunk Ridge fire cost dozens of fire departments hundreds of hours of manpower and thousands of dollars to fight. Jackson Wang has more on how some of those fire companies are now getting assistance.\n\nSUMMITVILLE, N.Y. --Â Summitville Fire Chief Craig Blakesley and his firefighters were the first ones to combat the Shawangunk Ridge fire back in May. Right away, they knew it was going to be a long battle.\n\nâThe fire was pretty difficult,\" Blakesley said. \"There were a lot of times where it got pretty intense up there. It was a lot of work to do.â\n\nSoon, over a dozen other fire companies joined the fight, including Rock Hill.\n\nâWe had a lot of man power down here,\" said Kris Gwiozdowski, Rock Hill Fire Chief. \"Came down here early morning, left late at night.â\n\nIt took firefighters more than a week to put out the 2,700-acre fire. Luckily, there were no serious injuries or deaths. But the fire took a toll on the equipment and the budgets of several departments.\n\nâWe lost our hoses, there was damage to our Komoto, which is our utility vehicle for fight fires and forest fires,âÂ Blakesley said.Â\n\nNow, help is coming for 16 fire departments in Sullivan County. On Saturday, Assemblywoman Aileen Gunther announced each of those departments will be receiving $7,000 to help alleviate the deficit.\n\nâThey depleted a lot of their funds while they were fighting the fire, so a lot of them will use if for funds that would have otherwise been used for something else,âÂ Gunther said.\n\nThe money comes from this year's state budget. The departments can use the funds to buy new equipment that was damaged or destroyed by the fire.Â\n\nâWeâre going to buy some axes, like I said we just buy a new UTV, firefighting wildland equipment,âÂ Gwiozdowski said.Â\n\nAs these fire departments begin to work on their budget for next year, they say the money comes at a perfect time.\n\nâYou never know what can happen on these mountains,âÂ Gwiozdowski said.\n\nâWe were thrilled by the exact amount of money that we were going to receive, so it works out perfect,\" Blakesley said.Â"
