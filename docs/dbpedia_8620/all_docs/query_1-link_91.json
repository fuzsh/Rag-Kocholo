        "text": "This test is intended for the culture of sterile body fluids (other than urine, blood, BAL or bone marrow). Send fluid in a sterile specimen container to the Microbiology laboratory. Specify source of specimen, preferably using pre-defined specimen descriptors in CPOE.\n\nFor CSF, see Place Holder for CSF Bacterial Culture and Sensitivity with Gram Stain [CSFPHC].\n\nFor specimens collected from drains (other than CSF), see Fluid Bacterial Culture and Sensitivity with Gram Stain [FLDC].\n\nFor all other body fluids see Place Holder for Body Fluid Bacterial Culture and Sensitivity with Gram Stain (includes anaerobes) [FLDPHC].\n\nFor blood/urine/BAL/bone marrow see separate test guide entries specific to these sites.\n\nPreferred: Fluid in sterile specimen container or syringe (remove needle and replace with Luer tip cap).\n\nIf inoculating blood culture bottles directly, disinfect BOTTLE TOPS. Allow to dry. Inoculate 8-10 mL body fluid into 1 FA Plus aerobic blood culture bottle and 8-10 mL into 1 FN Plus anaerobic blood culture bottle. Send additional fluid in sterile container for direct exam (recommended). Do NOT overfill or under fill. Do not place patient label over the barcode label. Only BacT/ALERT blood culture bottles will be accepted.\n\nNote: If possible, inoculate the maximum volume for optimal sensitivity of culture.\n\nTransport specimens collected in a syringe or sterile container within 2 hours and pre-inoculated blood culture bottles within 30 minutes after collection at room temperature.\n\nTransport in the pneumatic tube system: Place blood culture bottles in a large biohazard specimen bag with the request slip. Then place the bagged bottles between TWO sections of foam padding inserts before sending the specimens in the pneumatic tube system. Please send any additional fluid in a separate pneumatic tube.\n\nIf specimen is received >12 hours after collection, viability of organisms may be significantly reduced. Specimens received > 24 hours after collection, or collected with expired transport media will be rejected.\n\nUW-MT: If already inoculated bottles are received with extra container of fluid, order FLDGBC. If <1mL of sterile fluid is received, order FLDANC. For fluid from drainages, order FLDC except CSF.\n\nHMC: See instructions in the Specimen Processing procedure.\n\nNote: If blood bottles received on an unacceptable fluid type, consult Microbiology manager or lead; do not toss bottles."
