It is widely accepted that human body fluids contain disease-associated proteins that are secreted, shed, and emanated from pathological tissues across the body (1). In disease, highly altered protein expression profiles in body fluids may generate undeniable signatures and unwrapped fingerprints, which may provide insight into disease mechanisms. Therefore, body fluids have potential applicability for the early detection of disease, for the monitoring of its progression, and for therapeutic drug efficacy, especially for their adjacent diseased tissue.\n\nProteomics is a powerful method for biomedical research. With the significant advances in mass spectrometry (MS) and proteomics technologies (2, 3), protein biomarker discovery has become one of the central applications of proteomics. In terms of disease diagnosis and prognosis, compared to tissue biopsy, human body fluids (e.g. blood, urine, tears, or saliva) appear to be more easy and attractive because of several key advantages, including low invasiveness, minimum cost, and the ease of sample collection and processing (4). The application of modern proteomic tools in body fluids (5) raised some major issues related to the standardization of sample collection, separation, and processing for qualitative proteomics [such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) (6-8) and multiple liquid chromatography (LC) techniques (9)] or quantitative proteomics [such as 2D difference gel electrophoresis (10), isotope-coded affinity tag (11), stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (12, 13) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (14-17)]. The ion intensity-based label-free quantitative approach has gradually gained more popularity and provides an alternative powerful tool to resolve and identify thousands of proteins from a complex biological sample (18, 19).\n\nBody fluid proteomes have been investigated for more than 10 years, beginning with the Human Plasma Proteome Project in 2002 (20). The emergence of high-accuracy and high-resolution mass spectrometers in 2006 led to large-scale analyses of tear-duct fluid (21), urine (22), and seminal plasma (23) from Mannâ€™s group, which were considered the first high-accuracy proteome maps of human body fluids. With the rapid development of MS technology, the large-scale MS-based draft of the human proteome was presented in 2014 (24), including the proteomes of human tissues, cell lines, and body fluids. Among them, the proteomic datasets from eight body fluids (urine, seminal plasma, blood, vitreous humor, CSF, synovial fluid, saliva, and milk) were assembled to contribute to the whole proteome map of humans (24).\n\nUrine with less complexity than serum and relatively high thermodynamic stability is a promising study medium for discovery of novel biomarkers in many human diseases, such as bladder and prostate cancer, and renal diseases (25-27). CSF is secreted from several different central nervous system (CNS) structures, and the change in the protein composition of CSF is considered a sensitive indicator for the analysis of neurodegenerative or other CNS disorders (28, 29). As for saliva, the related salivary protein markers (such as glycoproteins) (30) have been well demonstrated to be important for the diagnosis of Sjogrenâ€™s syndrome (SS), an autoimmune disease characterized by xerostomia (dry mouth) and xerophthalmia (dry eyes). Tear fluid analysis is also a noninvasive approach in early diagnosis and study of pathogenesis of eye-related diseases such as dry eye syndrome.\n\nIn this study, we collected 10 body fluids from 23 patients diagnosed with 19 common diseases, obtained 157 MS raw files, and conducted a proteomic comparison using high-resolution MS. All of the proteomic data from ascites, bile, CSF, hydrothorax, KJF, plasma, saliva, serum, tears and urine were obtained using similar approaches and bioinformatics pipelines. For each body fluid, relative protein abundance was estimated using intensity-based algorithm quantitation (iBAQ) methods (31). A deep analysis was performed regarding the protein composition of ten body fluids, and the proteins were extensively characterized to provide functional annotation of the body fluid proteomes, novel insights into the relationships among these ten body fluids, and greater research utility for multiple diseases.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work is supported by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (2016YFA0502500), National International Cooperation Grant (2014DFB30010), National Program on Key Basic Research Project (973 Program, 2012CB910300, 2014CBA02000), National High-tech R&D Program of China (863 program, 2014AA020201), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31270822) and Beijing Natural Science Foundation (Z131100005213003).
