Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis compact monograph reviews in simple, lucid terms the basic physiology and methods of calculation necessary for the understanding of body fluids, including sections on composition, adjustment of pH, and respiratory and renal regulation. The second part of the work is concerned with the clinical significance of the various abnormalities of pattern most commonly encountered.\n\nThe clinician will find this a ready means of refreshing and correlating his knowledge on a complex subject that is of daily importance. The book is written in a logical and sequential manner, presenting the normal and pathologic mechanisms without becoming unnecessarily involved in theoretical chemistry. The book is not, nor was it intended to be, a handbook of fluid therapy, but it is a review of an important phase of practical physiology well presented."
