        "text": "Print & Share (PDF 1.56MB)\n\nSpanish (Español)\n\nYou’ve probably heard that most Americans eat too much sodium. Your body needs a small amount of sodium to work properly, but too much sodium can be bad for your health. Diets higher in sodium are associated with an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, which is a major cause of stroke and heart disease.\n\nDespite what many people think, most dietary sodium (over 70%) comes from eating packaged and prepared foods—not from table salt added to food when cooking or eating. The food supply contains too much sodium and Americans who want to consume less sodium can have a difficult time doing so. That is why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is working with the food industry to make reasonable reductions in sodium across a wide variety of foods. Even though sodium may already be in many packaged foods when you purchase them, you can lower your daily sodium intake by using the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nLook at the Label!\n\nUse the Nutrition Facts label as your tool to make informed decisions!\n\nKnow the Daily Value. The Daily Values are reference amounts of nutrients to consume or not to exceed each day. The Daily Value for sodium is less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day.\n\nUse % Daily Value (%DV) as a tool. The %DV is the percentage of the Daily Value for each nutrient in a serving of the food and shows how much of a nutrient contributes to a total daily diet.\n\nUse %DV to determine if a serving of the food is high or low in sodium and to compare and choose foods to get less than 100% DV of sodium each day.\n\nAs a general guide: 5% DV or less of sodium per serving is considered low, and 20% DV or more of sodium per serving is considered high.\n\nPay attention to servings. The nutrition information listed on the Nutrition Facts label is usually based on one serving of the food. Check the serving size and the number of servings you eat or drink to determine how much sodium you are consuming.\n\nFood Choices Matter!\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 40% of the sodium consumed by Americans comes from the following foods:\n\nDeli meat sandwiches\n\nPizza\n\nBurritos and tacos\n\nSoups\n\nSavory Snacks (e.g. chips, crackers, popcorn)\n\nPoultry\n\nPasta mixed dishes\n\nBurgers\n\nEgg dishes and omelets\n\nBut remember, the sodium content can vary significantly between similar types of foods. So, use the Nutrition Facts label to compare products, and don’t forget to check the serving size in order to make an accurate comparison.\n\nTable Salt and Sodium: Defined\n\nThe words “table salt” and “sodium” are often used interchangeably, but they do not mean the same thing. Table salt (also known by its chemical name, sodium chloride) is a crystal-like compound that is abundant in nature. Sodium is a mineral, and one of the chemical elements found in salt.\n\nSodium as a Food Ingredient\n\nAs a food ingredient, sodium has multiple uses, such as for curing meat, baking, thickening, retaining moisture, enhancing flavor (including the flavor of other ingredients), and as a preservative. Some common food additives—like monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), sodium nitrite, and sodium benzoate—also contain sodium and contribute (in lesser amounts) to the total amount of “sodium” listed on the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nSurprisingly, some foods that don’t taste salty can still be high in sodium, which is why using taste alone is not an accurate way to judge a food’s sodium content. For example, while some foods that are high in sodium (like pickles and soy sauce) taste salty, there are also many foods (like cereals and pastries) that contain sodium but don’t taste salty. Also, some foods that you may eat several times a day (such as breads) can add up to a lot of sodium over the course of a day, even though an individual serving may not be high in sodium.\n\nSodium and Blood Pressure\n\nSodium attracts water, and a high-sodium diet draws water into the bloodstream, which can increase the volume of blood and subsequently your blood pressure. High blood pressure (also known as hypertension) is a condition in which blood pressure remains elevated over time. Hypertension makes the heart work too hard, and the high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs (such as the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes). Uncontrolled high blood pressure can raise the risk of heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney disease, and blindness. In addition, blood pressure generally rises as you get older, so limiting your sodium intake becomes even more important each year.\n\n10 Easy Tips for Reducing Sodium Consumption\n\nLearning about sodium in foods and exploring new ways to prepare foods can help you achieve your sodium goal. And, if you follow these tips to reduce the amount of sodium you consume, your “taste” for sodium will gradually decrease over time—so eventually, you may not even miss it!\n\nRead the Nutrition Facts label\n\nCompare and choose foods to get less than 100% DV (less than 2,300 mg) of sodium each day.\n\nPrepare your own food when you can\n\nLimit packaged sauces, mixes, and “instant” products (including flavored rice, instant noodles, and ready-made pasta).\n\nAdd flavor without adding sodium\n\nLimit the amount of table salt you add to foods when cooking, baking, or at the table. Try no-salt seasoning blends and herbs and spices instead of salt to add flavor to your food.\n\nBuy fresh\n\nChoose fresh meat, poultry, and seafood, rather than processed varieties. Also, check the package on fresh meat and poultry to see if salt water or saline has been added.\n\nWatch your veggies\n\nBuy fresh, frozen (no sauce or seasoning), or low sodium or no-salt-added canned vegetables.\n\nGive sodium the “rinse”\n\nRinse sodium-containing canned foods, such as beans, tuna, and vegetables before eating. This removes some of the sodium.\n\n“Unsalt” your snacks\n\nChoose low sodium or no-salt-added nuts, seeds, and snack products (such as chips and pretzels)—or have carrot or celery sticks instead.\n\nConsider your condiments\n\nSodium in condiments can add up. Choose light or reduced sodium condiments, add oil and vinegar to salads rather than bottled dressings, and use only a small amount of seasoning from flavoring packets instead of the entire packet.\n\nReduce your portion size\n\nLess food means less sodium. Prepare smaller portions at home and consume less when eating out—choose smaller sizes, split an entrée with a friend, or take home part of your meal.\n\nMake lower-sodium choices at restaurants\n\nAsk for your meal to be prepared without table salt and request that sauces and salad dressings be served “on the side,” then use less of them. You can also ask if nutrition information is available and then choose options that are lower in sodium"
