        "text": "Overview\n\nWhat are blood and body fluid precautions?\n\nBlood and body fluid precautions are used to prevent transmission of diseases such as HIV or hepatitis. These precautions are used by health care workers and people who provide first aid when they may be in contact with blood or body fluids. Precautions may include protective barriers, such as gloves, gowns, masks, or eye protection.\n\nThese precautions also apply to other body fluids, including breast milk, semen, rectal and vaginal fluids, and fluid that surrounds a fetus or organs inside the body.\n\nWhy are these precautions important?\n\nAlthough skin provides some protection from exposure to potentially infectious substances, it is strongly recommended that health professionals use blood and body fluid precautions for further protection when they are providing health care. These precautions also help protect you from exposure to a potential infection from your health professional in the unlikely event that you come in contact with the health professional's blood.\n\nThe American Red Cross recommends that everyone use blood and body fluid precautions when giving first aid.\n\nAre blood and body fluid precautions always needed?\n\nThe best practice is to always use blood and body fluid precautions, even when you can't see any blood and there's no chance that blood is present.\n\nHow can you reduce your risk of exposure to blood and body fluids?\n\nBlood and body fluid precautions involve the use of protective barriers such as gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection. These reduce the risk of exposing the skin or mucous membranes to potentially infectious fluids. Health care workers should always use protective barriers to protect themselves from exposure to another person's blood or body fluids.\n\nIf you give first aid, use blood and body fluid precautions. You may wish to have gloves available in your home, office, or vehicle if you think you may be required to help another person in an emergency.\n\nTaking the following precautions can help you minimize your risk of exposure to contaminated blood and body fluids.\n\nUse gloves to protect you whenever you touch blood, body fluids, mucous membranes, or broken, burned, or scraped skin.\n\nThe use of gloves also decreases the risk of disease transmission if you are pricked with a needle.\n\nAlways wear gloves for handling items or surfaces soiled with blood or body fluids.\n\nWear gloves if you have scraped, cut, or chapped skin on your hands.\n\nChange your gloves after each use.\n\nWash your hands immediately after removing your gloves.\n\nWash your hands and other skin surfaces immediately after they come in contact with blood or body fluids.\n\nAlways wear a mask and protective eyewear if you are doing a procedure that may expose you to splashes or sprays of blood or body fluids.\n\nMasks and protective eyewear, such as goggles or a face shield, help protect your eyes, mouth, and nose from droplets of blood and other body fluids.\n\nAlways wear a gown or apron if you are doing a procedure that may expose you to splashes or sprays of blood or body fluids.\n\nGowns or aprons protect you from splashes of blood or body fluids.\n\nTake these precautions if you give injections to a family member or to yourself:\n\nUse puncture-resistant containers to dispose of needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments.\n\nDo not recap needles.\n\nDo not bend or handle used needles or disposable syringes.\n\nAvoid touching objects that may be contaminated.\n\nLearn first aid and CPR, so when you are faced with an emergency or injury, you will know what to do.\n\nWhat should you do if you're exposed to blood or body fluids?\n\nHere are some steps to take if you are exposed to blood and body fluids."
