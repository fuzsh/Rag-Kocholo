        "text": "Spill Kits Help You Manage Risks\n\nAccidents happen. Each episode of vomit, blood or other body fluid spill in your establishment represents risks for your employees, guests and your brand. Pathogens can survive on surfaces for days, weeks, and even months and introduce risk for employees, customers, students and other stakeholders. The result can be unwanted media coverage and foodborne or bloodborne illness to patrons. For every establishment that serves or sells food, preventing norovirus and, more important, preventing the spread of norovirus is of critical importance.\n\nNorthfield Medical Manufacturing, the operator of OSHAKits.com, is the gold standard in Workplace Safety Spill Kits. We partner with major chains to implement the protocol mandated by the U.S. Food Code and OSHA as it relates to vomit, blood, and other biological spills. We provide the food safety kit, the thoughtful food safety supplies inside, and a process that changes corporate culture and encourages best practices. Word spreads. Fortunately, best practices spread fast, too.\n\nOur single-use body fluid kits are 100% disposable and up to 83% biodegradable."
