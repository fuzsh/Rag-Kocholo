We also get some fluids from the foods we eat.\n\nNot getting enough fluids can lead to dehydration.\n\nDaily fluid intake\n\nMost people should aim to drink enough during the day so their pee is a clear pale yellow colour.\n\nThe Eatwell Guide recommends that people should aim to drink 6 to 8 cups or glasses of fluid a day. Water, lower-fat milk and sugar-free drinks, including tea and coffee, all count.\n\nYou may need to drink more fluids if you're:\n\npregnant or breastfeeding\n\nin a hot environment\n\nphysically active for long periods\n\nill or recovering from illness\n\nChildren\n\nThe best drinks to give children are water and milk. Children can have pasteurised whole or semi-skimmed cows' milk, or goats’ or sheep’s milk, as a main drink from the age of 1.\n\nChildren should avoid sugary fizzy drinks, squash and juice drinks completely. Children who drink a lot of sugary drinks are more likely to become overweight. The added sugar in these drinks can also damage teeth.\n\nRead about drinks for babies and young children"
