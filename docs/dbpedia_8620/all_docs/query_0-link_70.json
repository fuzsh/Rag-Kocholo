If necessary, move the patient into multiple positions to suspend cellular material in the fluid.\n\nCOLLECTION TECHNIQUE\n\nComplete requisition entirely.\n\nLabel container(s) before procedure.\n\nCollect body fluid in labeled, leak-proof container.\n\nHeparin may be added to specimen to reduce clotting. Add 500 units of heparin per 100 ml of fluid anticipated (each mL heparin contains 1000 units). Gently agitate the flask as fluid is collected to mix the heparin with the fluid.\n\n*NOTE: It is not necessary to combine peritoneal washings or gastric washings with an anticoagulant (heparin). See special instructions below.\n\nSpecimen may be submitted fresh/unfixed or fixed in CytoLyt.\n\nAdd a volume of fixative to the specimen such that the ratio of fixative to specimen is 2:1.\n\nSeal container well to prevent leaking.\n\nPlace labeled container in a sealable Biohazard specimen bag and include the requisition in the outer pocket of the specimen bag.\n\nSend the entire specimen to the laboratory as soon as possible.\n\n**REFRIGERATE ALL CYTOLOGY SPECIMENS IF IMMEDIATE DELIVERY TO LAB/CYTOLOGY IS NOT POSSIBLE**\n\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR GASTRIC WASHINGS\n\nPatient Preparation:\n\nThe patient must be fasting overnight. Keep the patient hydrated by having him/her drink water or tea during the night, especially one hour prior to the procedure. If there is an obstruction, continuous suctions should be maintained overnight, and the patient should be kept hydrated using IV fluids. If barium has been given, the procedure must be delayed one week.\n\nCollection Technique:\n\nA Levine tube is introduced in the usual manner to the 75 cm mark. No lubrication is used except by moistening the tube with ice. Repeated amounts of Ringer’s solution is injected under pressure, aspirated, and discarded until the return is clear. 500 ml of Ringer’s solution is then introduced under maximum pressure and re-aspirated while the abdomen is vigorously massaged. The aspirated fluid is then placed in a clean, leak-proof container. Send the specimen to the laboratory immediately, packed in ice. Specimen may be submitted fresh or fixed with an equal volume of CytoLyt in a 50 mL to 100 mL container.\n\n**REFRIGERATE ALL CYTOLOGY SPECIMENS IF IMMEDIATE DELIVERY TO LAB/CYTOLOGY IS NOT POSSIBLE**\n\nREQUEST FORM\n\nAnatomical Pathology Requisition\n\nComplete patient information section.\n\nComplete the Non-Gynecologic section thoroughly.\n\nCAUSES FOR REJECTION\n\nIncomplete requisition.\n\nSpecimen container not labeled properly.\n\nImproperly fixed specimen.\n\nGross contamination due to spillage.\n\nProlonged period (more than eight (8) hours) at room temperature.\n\nInsufficient quantity for cytologic evaluation.\n\nDelay in delivery for adequate preservation.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n\nAllowing fluid to stand for a prolonged period before processing may cause deterioration and artifact.\n\nCells in fluids of long duration may be degenerated on first tap and a second tap may be required after re-accumulation for best cytologic detail.\n\nClots may contain diagnostic cells which are unavailable for sampling.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nSmears and thin layer preparations are examined microscopically using the Pap stain method.\n\nCell block specimens prepared and stained using Hematoxylin & Eosin (H & E) stain method.\n\nSpecial stains and special studies (IHC, ISH, molecular, etc.), if needed.\n\nCrystal analysis upon request.\n\nCell count with differential available upon request.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nInformation is also available on the SEPA website under Resources – Directory of Services.\n\nPlease call laboratory if you have questions."
