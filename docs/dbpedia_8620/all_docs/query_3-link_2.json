        "text": "Body fluids are the liquids found within and around the human body. These fluids play a crucial role in maintaining the health and function of the body, including regulating body temperature, transporting nutrients and oxygen, and removing waste products.\n\nThere are several types of body fluids, including blood, lymph, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, sweat, and digestive juices. Each of these fluids has a unique composition and function within the body.\n\nBlood is a vital body fluid that is responsible for transporting oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues and organs.\n\nLymph is a clear fluid that helps to remove waste products and excess fluids from the body's tissues.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, providing cushioning and protection.\n\nUrine is a waste product that is produced by the kidneys and excreted from the body through the urinary system.\n\nSweat is produced by sweat glands and helps to regulate body temperature by evaporating from the skin's surface.\n\nDigestive juices, including saliva, gastric juices, and pancreatic juices, aid in the digestion and absorption of nutrients from the foods we eat."
