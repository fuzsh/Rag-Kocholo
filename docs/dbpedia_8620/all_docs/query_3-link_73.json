        "text": "The Importance of Hydration\n\nOptimal Function\n\nYour body needs to be hydrated in order to function at its optimal level. If there isnât enough liquid in your body, essential functions like circulation donât go as smoothly as they should. Your organs wonât get the nutrients they need, and your body will perform its job less efficiently.\n\nMood\n\nDehydration can also affect your mood. If you havenât been drinking enough water, you can feel tired, cranky or irritable. You might even imagine that youâre hungry, when what your body is actually craving is water.\n\nProductivity\n\nHydration is important for thinking clearly. If youâre dehydrated, your productivity may suffer. Itâs important to remember that your body loses water all day, and you should replace water continuously throughout the day..\n\nThe Role of Water in the Human Body Water is life, and our bodies need water more than they need food, sleep, or exercise. An important component of every bodily function, water is the major portion of our digestion and elimination systems. It also cushions and lubricates brain and joint tissue. Water also transports nutrients and carries waste away from the cells. And it helps regulate body temperature by distributing heat and cooling the body through perspiration. Our bodies are composed of water. The entire human body is about 66 percent water. Our bones are composed of 22 percent water, muscles are 76 percent and blood is 83 percent. Lungs are 90 percent, and our brains are actually 95 percent water.\n\nIt is easy to see why water and hydration play such a critical role in a healthful lifestyle. Hydration is the replacement of body fluids lost through sweating, exhaling, and elimination. Itâs just as important at the office or on the couch as it is in the gym. And proper hydration does more than just keep you from getting thirsty. It actually does the following for your health:"
