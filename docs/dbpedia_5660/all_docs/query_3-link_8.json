Because Faisal was only four years old, his maternal uncle ʿAbd al-Ilāh became regent. In April 1941, when the nationalist prime minister Rashid Ali al-Gaylani briefly seized power from ʿAbd al-Ilāh, Faisal was smuggled out of the country by his mother, Queen Aliyah, and was educated at Harrow School in England. After the queen’s death in 1950 ʿAbd al-Ilāh became Faisal’s sole guardian.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
