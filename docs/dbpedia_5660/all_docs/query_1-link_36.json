        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nBAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 26 - Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein has had enough of the riches, the servants, the palaces and living like a king. Now, he says, it's time to be one.\n\nMr. Hussein, a dapper 48-year-old former fund manager who was a first cousin of Iraq's last king, Faisal II, and claims direct lineage to the Prophet Muhammad, has jumped into the Iraqi elections not just to win a seat in the national assembly but to reclaim the throne.\n\nIt is a Cinderella campaign, but Mr. Hussein is palpably building momentum, positioning himself and his Iraqi Constitutional Monarchy Party as the unifying force that could end Iraq's bloodshed. He has built a network of supporters, from veterinarians in Baghdad to Basra sheiks in tents, and he now says even the men with masks are on his side.\n\n\"The insurgents have given us the green light,\" Mr. Hussein said. \"We go anywhere we want.\"\n\nBut there is one little problem.\n\nThere is another man who would be king.\n\nNot far away from Mr. Hussein's palace in central Baghdad, with its chirping birds and trickling fountains, is a dim office with mustard-colored leather couches. It is here that Sharif Mamoul Abdul Rahman al-Nissan, a businessman who also claims to be a descendant of the prophet, has formed the rival Hashemi Iraqi Monarchy Party. His ideas are similar to Mr. Hussein's, and his party's symbol, a golden shield topped by a crown, is suspiciously reminiscent of Mr. Hussein's, which is far better known.\n\n\"So our shields look similar,\" Mr. Nissan said, with a wave of the hand. \"So what? We are two branches of the same tree.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
