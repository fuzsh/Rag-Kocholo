        "text": "Abstract: Iran-backed terrorists and militias lost the 2021 elections in Iraq yet ended up picking the prime minister anyway and taking charge of the world’s fifth-largest oil producer. This remarkable reversal of fortunes in 2022 was not delivered via the barrel of a gun but rather a series of cool-headed and coordinated moves by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, by Iranian-groomed and militia-controlled judges, and by militia politicians. The country’s oil economy, its freedoms, and its intelligence services are being gutted by militias to ensure their rule is permanent. Yet unprecedented control has not moderated these militias: The Gaza war has shown that these armed factions are also still addicted to militant ‘resistance’ to the United States. The result is the emergence of a terrorist-run state with greater resources than any of Iran’s other proxy networks, hiding behind the façade of a sovereign country.\n\nThis study is the fifth in a series of CTC Sentinel articles since 2019 that have detailed the ongoing evolution—in times of triumph and near-defeat—of the self-styled, Tehran-backed resistance (muqawama) factions in Iraq. The first article in August 2019 focused on how the muqawama had achieved one element of state capture by establishing, formalizing, and assuring Iraqi government funding for the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), Iraq’s equivalent of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).1 A second CTC Sentinel analysis in January 2020 charted the setbacks then suffered by the muqawama: failure to evict U.S. forces despite the appointment of a muqawama-controlled Iraqi prime minister Adel Abdal-Mahdi from 2018-2019; the collapse of Abdal-Mahdi’s militia-run government; and then the U.S. killing of the two icons of the muqawama, Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, on January 3, 2020.2 A third piece in October 2020 focused on how Iran’s most-favored Iraqi armed group, Kata’ib Hezbollah (KH), might adjust to the loss of these leaders and the appointment of an anti-muqawama government under Prime Minister Mustafa Kadhimi.3\n\nThe authors’ fourth CTC Sentinel study in October 2021 leveraged the first eight months of synthetized open-source and interview-led intelligence processes operated by the new Militia Spotlight team at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.4 This very detailed analysis provided a complete chronology of the post-January 3, 2020, struggle by the IRGC-QF (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force) to restore intra-muqawama cohesion and (when needed) to recentralize control of local anti-U.S. militant cells.5 In the aftermath of the October 10, 2021, parliamentary elections in Iraq, the muqawama’s political coalition was shown to have been decisively outperformed by the rival Shi`a powerbase of Moqtada al-Sadr.6\n\nThis study will take forward the chronology of the evolution of the Tehran-backed muqawama factions in Iraq, drawing upon two more years’ worth of Militia Spotlight synthesized intelligence operationsa spanning from November 2021 to November 2023.7 Militia Spotlight’s online blog8 and group profiles9 were established to track this process in detail and produce evidentiary building blocks, using legal standards of proof and certainty.b The project collects militia statements in Arabic and other languages, archives evidence that risks being taken offline at a later point, and uses a data fusion process to synthesize information and analyze trends. Drawing on progressively larger networks of contacts, citizen journalism, and an enlarged analytic team, the online collection effort is strongly supplemented by the same kind of detailed interview process with U.S. and Iraqi subjects that underpinned the prior CTC Sentinel studies referenced above.10\n\nThe overarching theme of this analysis is, soberingly (in the view of the authors), one of an extraordinary turnaround in favor of the Tehran-backed muqawama in Iraq. In late 2021, following electoral defeat, the Tehran-backed Shi`a militias faced the real prospect of political marginalization for the first time since the introduction of democratic majority rule to Iraq.11 Since the first Iraqi elections in 2005, a sectarian majoritarian system was held in place because the Shi`a blocs, with encouragement by Iran’s government and Iraq’s Shi`a religious establishment, caucused together in selecting a (Shi`a) prime minister by consensus.12 In the aftermath of the 2021 elections, this arrangement changed for the first time since 2005, as one member of the pan-Shi`a body politic, Moqtada al-Sadr, broke with tradition and sought to form a government with Kurdish and Sunni allies, and without the Iran-backed Shi`a militia politicians.13\n\nAt this darkest of moments for the muqawama, it was not the armed groups (or fasa’il) that saved the Tehran-backed Shi`a militias but rather an IRGC-QF-managed combination of made-to-order judicial rulings; targeted political violence; and the cohesiveness of the Shi`a Coordination Framework (al-Etar al-Tansiqi al-Shi`a) that brought together Shi`a politicians like Nouri al-Maliki of the State of Law Alliance, Hadi al-Ameri of Badr Organization,14 and Qais al-Khazali,15 the leader of U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq (AAH).16 Through the resilience of the Shi`a Coordination Framework and the weaknesses of Moqtada al-Sadr’s effort, it was the losers of Iraq’s 2021 elections—the Shi`a Coordination Framework—that formed the Iraqi government under Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in October 2022.17\n\nThe bulk of this analysis looks at what the “muqawama government” (as the Shia Coordination Framework styles itself18) has done with its sudden, uncontested, and unprecedented control of the prime minister’s office (and thus, the security services and government agencies), plus the judiciary and the parliament—a full sweep of Iraq’s powerbases. The story is one of state capture by Tehran-backed terrorist groups and militias of the world’s fifth-largest oil producer,19 with a population and an economy seven times as large as the Lebanese Hezbollah-controlled Lebanese state.20 c\n\nThe first two sections of the article review the manner in which in 2021-2022 the IRGC-QF/muqawama partnership faced—and defeated—their most serious political challenge to date and took power in October 2022. The third section of the study then looks at the first thorny issue they faced in government: whether to evict U.S. forces or adopt a more pragmatic approach. This episode clarified an evolving division of labor between overlapping circles of state capture-focused muqawama and militancy-focused muqawama, with the latter accepting no immediate removal of U.S. forces in order to support broader state capture by Iran-backed factions. Ensuring that the Tehran-backed muqawama would never again face an existential threat was the next order of business, and the fourth section of this study will look at the skyrocketing terrorist and militia penetration of Iraq’s intelligence, military, judicial, media, and border agencies since 2022. The fifth section then looks at the greatly expanded economic opportunities now available to Tehran-backed terrorist and militia groups in Iraq as they attain unchecked control of all the organs of the state for the first time, with important implications for the future of counter-terrorism threat financing originating in Iraq. The sixth part of the study analyzes the changing balance of power (since October 2021) within the muqawama and also between the Iraqi factions and IRGC-QF. Early indicators from the Gaza war provide useful insights into the extensive overlap between state capture-focused and militancy-focused muqawama groups. Predictions, analytic lessons, and ideas for further study close out the article.\n\nPart One. Facing Disaster: Iran-Backed Militias after Iraq’s 2021 Elections\n\nAs the results from the October 2021 elections began to be tallied, the Tehran-backed militias in the main muqawama bloc, the Fateh Alliance (Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq (AAH), Badr, and Katai’b Hezbollah (KH)) quickly recognized that a disaster had befallen them.21 The failure was not mainly in terms of their own somewhat weak performance, but principally in the form of the very strong result achieved by their main Shi`a political rival, Moqtada al-Sadr, who had accurately understood how to arrange his campaign to win the maximum number of seats.d Of the 329 seats in parliament, al-Sadr’s Sairoon list had won 73, placing it far ahead of his Shi`a opponents.22 His closest challenger was former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki, with 37 seats, who was competing separately from the Fateh Alliance. Even when al-Maliki joined with the Fateh Alliance militias, they collectively could scrape together just 65 seats.e The Fateh Alliance dropped from 48 seats in the 2018 elections to around 20 in the 2021 results.f The muqawama faction that suffered the worst humiliation was Qais al-Khazali’s Sadiqoun list, part of the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq,23 which received just four seats in the October 2021 elections (down from 15 in 2018).24 This was a double-blow because the increasingly prominent al-Khazali had expected not only to grow his parliamentary representation but also to eclipse his Fateh Alliance partner, Hadi al-Ameri’s Badr Organization,25 yet the reverse occurred: Al-Khazali’s share of the Fateh bloc in parliament shrank from 31 percent in 2018 to 20 percent in 2021.g Kataib Hezbollah’s Harakat Hoquq (The Rights Movement) list only won one seat from the 32 races it ran in.26\n\nMore importantly, all of Moqtada al-Sadr’s Shi`a rivals grasped exactly how consequential this loss could be due to new and radical political doctrine espoused by al-Sadr.27 This was the concept of a cross-sectarian, multi-ethnic majority government that would marginalize or even exclude the Fateh Alliance and other Shi`a factions.28 In prior elections, the exact balance between the Shi`a factions was inconclusive because they agreed to collectively select a prime minister by consensus as a sectarian unit. Al-Sadr now threatened to change this equation in partnership with two other winners of the election, who al-Sadr’s political scientists had correctly predicted would also perform strongly under the electoral system used in 2021: Massoud Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Mohammed al-Halbousi’s Sunni Arab Taqadum (National Progress Party).29\n\nFrom the spring of 2021, Moqtada al-Sadr has begun to strengthen relations with these two players, which was so unsettling to Tehran-backed blocs and Iran itself that the Kurds received both warnings and regular drone attacks to discourage their full commitment to al-Sadr and the possibility that their example would draw in Sunnis in their wake.30 Al-Sadr openly stated that he intended to disassemble the muqawama’s powerbase within the PMF.h Thus, al-Sadr and anyone who allied with him credibly threatened to cross two red lines that had been clearly laid out by Tehran-backed blocs and Iran itself: dividing the Shi`a community in government formation and threatening their control of the PMF mechanism of state funding and legitimization for muqawama militias.i\n\nThe first muqawama reaction to the loss was deep shock and existential dread: At one of the first meetings of the Fateh Alliance following the election, Hadi al-Ameri baldly stated: “I will not wait to be slaughtered like a lamb.”j Militia Spotlight spent the last quarter of 2021 recording, in detail, the thrashing around of muqawama actors as they ineffectively tried to alter the electoral results. First, in mid-October 2021, Qais al-Khazali led the organization of mass street protests and tried to storm the government center, the International Zone, with an AAH member killed by the security forces.31 Muqawama conventional and social media boiled with explicit threats against parties accused of corrupting the electoral results: the United States, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates (who were seen by the muqawama as supporting an axis between al-Sadr and the (then) incumbent Prime Minister Mustafa Kadhimi).32 In late October and early November 2021, the muqawama began to issue death threats against Kadhimi, senior security officials,33 and undertook a rocket attack on the organization closest to him, the Iraqi National Intelligence Service.34\n\nOn November 7, 2021, two explosive drones were used to attack the house of Prime Minister Kadhimi.35 Though muqawama leaders denied culpability in the attack, available evidence suggests the drone attack was resourced and directly by an AAH-led, KH-supported consortia of disgruntled muqawama factionsk who did not perceive Iran as doing enough to help them in their moment of existential crisis.36 In November and December 2021, muqawama propaganda platforms like Sabereen News (affiliated with multiple fasa’il) and Unit 10,000 (affiliated with KH) repeatedly issued death threats against Kadhimi-linked intelligence officials and the Iraqi Security Forces protecting the International Zone, 37 followed by a rash of assassinations of security officers.38\n\nAt this moment, the IRGC-QF faced an institutional failure on a monumental scale. As the authors’ prior CTC Sentinel pieces noted, even under Soleimani, events in Iraq were slowly trending toward a nightmare scenario for the Iranian regime.39 A Tehran-backed premier, Prime Minister Adel Abdal-Mahdi, had resigned at the end of 2019 with less than two years in office due to mass protests in which Iranian diplomatic facilities in Iraq were repeatedly attacked and whose example spurred protests in Iran.l Then the two most senior IRGC-QF officers in Iraq, Soleimani and Muhandis, were killed;m the Iraqi muqawama was becoming unresponsive to Iranian direction at key moments;n Iraq’s most powerful Shi`a politician Moqtada al-Sadr and the new Sadr-Kurdish-Sunni tripartite bloc appeared intent on providing a full four-year term in office to Mustafa al-Kadhimi, a secular, Western-leaning premier who in his 2020-2021 administration had begun to arrest muqawama terrorists and generate significant intelligence on the weaknesses of the Tehran-based proxy networks in Iraq.40 For the IRGC-QF—still firmly in charge of Iranian policy in Iraq, based on Militia Spotlight’s researcho—the emerging outcome represented looming abject failure.41\n\nPart Two. Defeat into Victory: Lawfare, not Guns, Wins the Day\n\nMilitias Spotlight’s insights from winter of 2021-2022 strongly suggest that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the IRGC-QF commander Esmail Qaani “gripped” the muqawama issue in a decisive manner from December 2021 onwards. It is possible that Iran ceased at this point to try to replace Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis with one man,p but instead split up the rolesq he played between multiple muqawama leaders and factions, an idea explored by Militia Spotlight in a prescient January 2022 piece.42\n\nIn a very high-profile January 2022 BBC interview,43 Qais al-Khazali made half a dozen clearly critical statements about Iranian policy in Iraqr and finished by reflecting that since the deaths of Soleimani and al-Muhandis, “the way the [Iranian] organizations that are dealing with the Iraq case operate has changed dramatically.” He continued: “In my opinion maybe this change was correct and appropriate with this new situation. It’s not confidential that in most cases Mr. Qaani meets with the prime minister and other political figures from different groups and parties and has delivered the message that Iran won’t make decisions for Iraq. And decisions have to be taken by Iraqis. Iran doesn’t interfere. If help is requested by Iraq, Iran will take action. But it does not have a specific position on Iraq.”44\n\nThese comments contrast very interestingly with the starkly critical AAH public commentary on Iran in mid-November 2021,45 right after AAH played a key role in the drone attack on Kadhimi. Something changed appreciably at the start of 2022 in IRGC-QF relations with the Iraqi muqawama, with Esmail Qaani receiving a much better reception immediately afterwards.s Most likely, based on all the available small indicators and messages gathered at the time from interviews and social media spaces, the change came about because Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa—in the form of a letter—that sternly warned the muqawama players to cooperate with each other, with Qaani as his representative.46\n\nRole Division Among the Militias\n\nAnother strand of the recovery effort was Iran’s extension of a tight, controlling embrace of the military leaders of the fasa’il at the forefront of coordinating anti-U.S. actions. These were the same three leaders who had rushed first to meet with Soleimani’s deputy and successor, IRGC-QF commander Esmail Qaani, when he met Iraqi muqawama leaders for the first time as the new Quds Force chief in January 2020.47 One was Akram Kaabi of Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba (HaN, hereafter referred to as Nujaba);48 the second was Abu Alaa al-Wala’i of Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (KSS);49 and the third was Laith al-Khazali, Qais al-Khazali’s brother, in charge of AAH’s paramilitary operations at that point.t In November and December 2021, both were strengthened in Iraq. Abu Alaa al-Wala’i was boosted with a well-publicized KSS recruitment drive50 and an enhanced role for Abu Alaa’s relatives in the Sabereen News network.51 Ashab al-Kahf,52 a resistance brand that came under Kaabi’s control in late 2021, took over as the most prolific group claiming harassment attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq.53 In December 2021, in the most visible symbol of Kaabi’s symbolic leadership of anti-U.S. resistance operations, he gave a speech in front of the flags of the most prolific muqawama brands being used to claim kinetic attacks against U.S. targets in Iraq and Syria.u\n\nIn contrast, Katai’b Hezbollah lowered its profile at the same time and may have become more focused on covert operations, especially those against targets outside Iraq. In November 2021, KH claiming of roadside bomb attacks on U.S. supply convoys diminished,54 as did its involvement in the main muqawama media brand, Sabereen. Furthermore, KH’s Qassem al-Jabbarin brand used for claiming attacks became largely inactive.55 The only visible actions by KH were those undertaken openly by Abu Fadak (Abd’al-Aziz al-Mohammadawi, acting as the operational commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces since February 2020).56 When KH’s Special Operations wing next resurfaced, it was to use its Alwiyat al-Waad al-Haq brand to claim drone attacks on the UAE in February 2022, and on U.S. bases outside Iraq, such as a drone attack in August 2022 on Al-Tanf in Syria.57\n\nRecovery Through Lawfare and Political Warfare\n\nAfter restoring a modicum of cohesion and role differentiation to the muqawama, the next joint action by the IRGC-QF and the Shia Coordination Framework was ingenious—a novel and highly effective combination of lawfare with kinetic intimidation, intended to break the momentum of the Sadr-Kurdish-Sunni tripartite bloc. As Militia Spotlight has consistently warned, lawfare (“the strategy of using – or misusing – law as a substitute for traditional military means to achieve a warfighting objective”58) can be a highly-effective and economic tool of political warfare, especially in Iraq.v As noted in the October 2021 CTC Sentinel article: “Iran is well-versed in this kind of soft war (‘jang-e narm’ [Persian] or ‘harb na’ima’ [Arabic]) characterized by information warfare and the development of a network of covert and overt media actors.”59\n\nThe most important tool in the muqawama’s 2022 turnaround was Iraq’s most senior judge, the Iraqi Supreme Judicial Court’s Judge Faiq Zaydan,60 who (in February 2022) suddenly (and very unusually during a tense government formation interregnum)w issued a flurry of rulings in his subordinate Supreme Federal Court (FSC) that all, in some way, proved highly damaging to the tripartite bloc’s effort to form a government without the muqawama factions.61 Most importantly, the FSC altered the government formation rules so that the tripartite bloc’s simple (165-seat) majority was no longer sufficient to form a government and instead a two-thirds (218-seat) majority was needed, making the exclusion of Shi`a Coordination Framework players mathematically impossible due to the balance of seats.x In Militia Spotlight’s assessment, based on an extensive multi-year investigation, Zaydan is one of a number of judges groomed by the Iraqi muqawama, specifically by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis since around 2004. Zaydan was maneuvered by Muhandis to the apex of the Iraqi judicial system, whereupon Muhandis privately referred to him as “the guardian of the Shia project.”y Based on Militia Spotlight’s information, Zaydan remained in close contact with IRGC-QF officialsz and U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations such as KH and AAHaa throughout 2021-2022 on the government formation issue.62 Zaydan traded made-to-order judicial rulings in return for IRGC-QF and muqawama support for Zaydan’s continued leadership of the judicial system.63\n\nIn addition to rulings made to frustrate the filling of the key presidential role, and thus stall Moqtada al-Sadr’s government formation efforts, Zaydan and the FSC brought tremendous pressure against al-Sadr’s Kurdish partners. In February 2022, the FSC suddenly (and against usual custom) activated a 10-year old case against Kurdistan’s independent oil exports during government formation, with the intent to intimidate the Kurds into withdrawing from the tripartite effort.64 In parallel, from March to June 2022, both the muqawama fasa’il and Iran militarily attacked the Kurdistan Region, and particularly its energy sites with rocket and drone strikes (and in Iran’s case, directly and overtly with short-range ballistic missiles fired from inside Iran).65 Indeed, Nujaba issued its first Kurdish-language communique on March 16, 2022, three days after Iran’s ballistic missile strike on the Kurdistan capital of Erbil, warning the Kurds to abandon the tripartite bloc and efforts to “change the status quo.”66 This period of intense multifaceted harassment of the Kurdistan Region underlined just how effectively Iran and the muqawama could blend political warfare (including threatened regime change in Kurdistan) and lawfare, economic warfare, and kinetic attacks.\n\nThe net result was to expertly frustrate and goad Moqtada al-Sadr until he made a series of critical errors, most notably his June 2022 unilateral resignation of all 73 MPs of the Sairoon coalition from parliament, ceding their seats largely to the Shi`a Coordination Framework factions.ab Now armed with the ability to form a government due to the changed balance in the parliament, the Shi`a Coordination Framework immediately flipped to a pro-state, pro-system position, aligning with the security forces against a now (self-) excluded Sadrist street opposition.67 In August 2022, Moqtada al-Sadr’s ill-considered invasion and occupation of the International Zone was defeated decisively when the muqawama factions deftly provoked68 al-Sadr’s mobs to bombard the International Zone with small arms fire and rockets, and then enjoyed the spectacle of Iraq’s senior Shi`a cleric Ali al-Sistani ordering al-Sadr to withdraw his forces in disgrace.69 This cleared the way for al-Sadr’s retreat into reclusion; for the October 2022 formation of a muqawama-appointed premier, Prime Minister al-Sudani; and (see section 4) for an immediate and widespread purge of the pro-Western security officials that had gradually begun to assert themselves against the muqawama under Kadhimi.\n\nAll the muqawama players were winners in this unlikely reversal of fortunes, but the most visibly successful of them all were former premier Nouri al-Maliki and Qais al-Khazali.ac While Maliki’s utility is obvious—he won far more seats than the Fateh Alliance in the electionsad—al-Khazali’s comeback after his electoral wipeout is worth a closer look. He had been on an upswing in the yearsae before the elections, navigating the political environment with skill and energy,70 and perhaps exploiting the vacuum left by Soleimani and Muhandis’ killings and by KH’s infighting in 2020-2021.71 After the October 2021 elections, al-Khazali worked harder than any other player to reverse the outcome, perhaps because a Sadr-led government might have had especially disastrous consequences for al-Khazali.af As noted, al-Khazali was the first to put his own protestors in the firing line to protest the elections, and he played the key role in the November 7 drone attack on the then Prime Minister Kadhimi’s house, underlining to Iran the potential consequences of politically throwing him and other anti-Sadr factions under the bus.72 Al-Khazali was the most prominent of the Shi`a Coordination Framework “hawks” who argued for the need to abandon Iran’s long-held default approach—to always keep the Shi`a house united—and instead to defeat and exclude al-Sadr.ag In the summer of 2022, al-Khazali and al-Maliki held their nerve, outlasted al-Sadr, and then outplayed him in the International Zone crisis of August 2022.73\n\nAs important, al-Khazali then emerged as the initial backer of Iraq’s new “consensus” prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and thus the “earliest investor” in his appointment.ah Since then, al-Khazali has adopted a unique tone with al-Sudani and is the only Shi`a Coordination Framework leader with the chutzpah to publicly define and limit al-Sudani’s role, which al-Khazali described in a November 2022 television interview as that of a “general manager.” This appears to have been a calculated action to show al-Khazali’s power, by disparaging Iraq’s prime minister—the country’s highest executive and the commander-in-chief of the military—by comparing him to a low-ranking bureaucrat.74 Al-Khazali demanded that, in contrast to the Constitution’s provisions, “the prime minister must not monopolize the state’s decisions; rather, [he must] refer to the Coordination Framework … for strategic decisions, whether political, economic, or security. Organizing the government … is the prime minister’s business.”75 In January 2023, one of al-Khazali’s’ parliamentarians and a former AAH fighter, Ali Turki, referred to the Sudani government as “the muqawama government,” stating “the muqawama has come to represent the official view of Iraq, and it is the one running affairs today.”76 Al-Sudani’s Prime Minister’s Office has never issued a public rebuttal of either statement.\n\nPart Three. Militias in Charge: The Thorny Issue of U.S. Presence\n\nOnce ensconced in power following the October 2022 formation of al-Sudani’s government, the Shi`a Coordination Framework ran headfirst into one of the strategic decisions that they reserved for themselves rather than al-Sudani to make. This was the evergreen issue of U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq. Following a U.S.-Iraq Strategic Dialogue held by the Kadhimi government in the summer of 2021 in Washington, D.C., the muqawama had developed high expectations that a mutually agreed end to U.S. “combat operations” in Iraq on December 31, 2021, actually meant a withdrawal of all U.S. forces. The muqawama had already been asked by IRGC-QF to postpone their revenge for the killings of Soleimani and Muhandis in order to pass through the erratic end-days of the Trump administration at the end of 2020.77 Now, another muqawama-set deadline for U.S. withdrawal had passed without implementation during the government formation process at the end of 2021.\n\nWhen al-Sudani was appointed eight months later, Qais al-Khazali lost no time in stating in November 2022, with no rebuttal from al-Sudani or any other muqawama actor, that al-Sudani “will start a [process of] genuine negotiations. I emphasize it must be genuine and not nominal or deceptive—like what used to happen in the past … this is a matter we will never compromise on; [ending] the military presence of the United States is non-negotiable.”78 Yet, less than two months later, AAH79 (and KH80) reacted in a very restrained manner when al-Sudani announced on January 13, 2023, that the government would not seek the immediate removal of U.S. forces (as per the January 5, 2020, law to “expel all foreign troops from their country”81) but would instead “determine the missions, the numbers, and places [of U.S. troops in Iraq] and for a specific period of time.”82 AAH parliamentarian and fighter Ali Turki even told reporters on January 10, 2023, that “there is no problem to sit [negotiating] with the U.S. to exchange interests … The U.S. forces are in Iraq today to train Iraqi security forces … We are trying to make the relationship with the United States based on partnership and interests.”83\n\nWhat accounts for this new willingness in AAH and KH statements to equivocate regarding the extent and timing of U.S. withdrawal? The change of government from Kadhimi to al-Sudani was clearly one factor in the muqawama’s surprisingly relaxed view. As al-Khazali noted in November 2022: “In the past we had objections [because] the head of the previous government had ill intentions, so we stood against [his moves]. Right now, the prime minister is the prime minister of the Coordination Framework, therefore there is no suspicion about ill intentions.”84 Qais al-Khazali took note of the lack of strong U.S. reaction to the appointment of an AAH cabinet member, Minister of Higher Education Naim al-Aboudi, as a sign that dealing with the United States might be possible.ai\n\nMore broadly, the muqawama also seem to have rapidly recognized the need to placate the United States to at least a small degree. The first crisis of the al-Sudani era was the U.S. Treasury’s November 2022 limitations on dollar transactions with Iraq, which was a long-scheduled development that caught the new government by surprise and which underlined the need to treat the United States with care in order to maintain access to global financial systems and dollar transfers.85 The examples of the 2019 ouster of the muqawama-friendly Prime Minister Adel Abdal-Mahdi and the January 3, 2020, airstrikes on Soleimani and Muhandis were still fresh. The Iran-backedaj kidnap-murder on November 7, 2022, of U.S. citizen Stephen Troell in Baghdad86 ak was a new aggravating factor in relations. Overall, most of the muqawama leadership pragmatically accepted that al-Sudani could not, in the opening three months of his tenure, secure even a tentative timeline for the departure of U.S. forces.87 Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggests that al-Sudani made one demand of his political masters in the muqawama: that no attacks would be undertaken on U.S. diplomatic facilities during his tenure (a deal that was maintained from the beginning of al-Sudani’s term in October 2022 until an attack on U.S. Embassy Baghdad on December 8, 2023).88 al\n\nContinuing Violent Resistance under al-Sudani\n\nThe outlier in this apparently cozy arrangement was Akram al-Kaabi, who has remained the most trenchant public voice in the muqawama, a kind of semi-official spokesman for those in violent opposition to an ongoing U.S. military presence in Iraq, largely because he has no open interests in government to lose.am A week after al-Sudani signaled in mid-January 2023 that he had achieved no timeline for U.S. departure, three Iranian-made Qases-2K drones struck the U.S. point of presence in Al-Tanf, Syria,89 an attack claimed under the name of Al-Tashkil al-Waritheen,90 one of the brands whose flags hung behind al-Kaabi in his December 2021 speech.91 The Al-Tashkil al-Waritheen claim issued on January 21, 2023, noted: “No one can stop our operations in any way. We warned a lot against complacency with and kneeling in front of the American occupation in the region, and whoever does not listen to our voice demanding the expulsion of the occupiers will kneel before the bullets of our guns.”92\n\nUnder the al-Sudani government, anti-U.S. attacks never ceased. Kata’ib Hezbollah, Nujaba, AAH, and KSS began to undertake accelerated93 convoy, drone, and rocket attacks that assuaged the anger of muqawama supportersan at the non-withdrawal of U.S. forces, albeit without risking uncontrolled escalation and without overly embarrassing the new Iraqi government.94 The muqawama targeted Kurdistan infrastructure and government sites from March to May 2022;95 Turkish forces in Iraq in December 2021-August 2022;96 more remote U.S. bases in Iraq such as Al-Asad97 and U.S. bases in Syria such as Al-Tanf, Omar oilfield, and Hasakah98 (throughout January-August 2022 in both Iraq and Syria); and even made an unsuccessful effort to launch a Qasef-2K drone at the U.S. base at Ali al-Salem, Kuwait, in August 2022.99 These apparently disparate threat streams kept the fasa’il busy, and showed them to be addressing various enemies (the United States, Turkey, Kurdistan, and the Gulf Arabs).\n\nIn Militia Spotlight’s assessment, they were in no way coordinated by al-Kaabi,100 but were instead undertaken by a strata of kinetic cells drawn from Nujaba, AAH, KH, and KSS,101 with Qasef-2K attacks signifying special IRGC-QF interest in, and support of, a strike.ao The January 20, 2023, Qasef-2K attack on Al-Tanf (claimed under the Nujaba-linked brand Tashkil al-Waritheen) was followed by a March 23, 2023, triple-Qasef-2K strike on a U.S. base in Hasakah, Syria, which struck while U.S. defensive systems were deactivated and killed one U.S. contractor and injured six U.S. persons.102 The March 23 attack was claimed by a new brand, Liwa al-Ghaliboun (Brigade of the Victors), which Militia Spotlight assesses to be linked to Nujaba and very similar in its use as the Tashkil al-Waritheen brand.103\n\nFollowing a March 24, 2023, retaliatory U.S. strike104 on muqawama forces based in Syria (that killed around 11 persons), the Iraqi muqawama went relatively quiet from a kinetic perspective and instead spent the following six months needling the United States with rhetorical threats,ap largely related to the Ashab al-Kahf brand and Nujaba-related media channels. These acts included reminders of pre-2011 deadly attacks on helicopters in Iraq;aq a retrospective claim of an October 2017 killing of a U.S. soldier in Iraq;ar the announcement of new (and so far unused) group names for attacking U.S. targets;105 and then various protests106 and recruitment actions in urban areas (Baghdad, Karbala, and Basra).107\n\nOther Shi`a Coordination Framework parties (and indeed Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani) seem to have become weary of, and perhaps even concerned by, some of the Kaabi network’s antics in 2023, which may have been intended to outshine and embarrass them in front of muqawama supporters. When the Sudani government temporarily shut down access to the Telegram app in Iraq at the same time as Iraq’s defense minister visited the United States, the head of Nujaba’s political council, Ali al-Asadi, was quick to threaten the government, calling them “traitors.”as\n\nOf all the muqawama players, Kaabi, Nujaba, and the Nujaba-controlled Ashab al-Kahf brand have been uniquely hostile to U.S. targets and the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.at This is an interesting example of a faction with very close ties to IRGC-QF (Nujaba) being reined in by other IRGC-QF partners, with Iran apparently standing back or perhaps mediating very quietly behind the scenes.108 In such cases, the Shi`a Coordination Framework factions who control and milk the resources of the Iraqi state (see Section 5) appear to be Iran’s main (or “supported”) effort in Iraq: In other words, IRGC-QF and most of the Shi`a Coordination Framework benefit from U.S. economic partnership with Iraq and can tolerate the presence of U.S. forces, which pose no obstacle to the muqawama’s control of the country.109\n\nPart Four. Ensuring Regime Security: The Quest for Control\n\nWhile the Kaabi network stayed active and cosmetically harassed the U.S. military presence in Iraq, the other muqawama factions spent the opening months of the Sudani government seizing control of security agencies. The 30-month Kadhimi premiership had seen a steady cleansing of muqawama operators and agents from key security portfolios, largely unnoticed by casual observers of Iraq’s security scene.110 From October 2022 onward, the militias set about purging those promoted during the Kadhimi era and installing muqawama-friendly officials in key roles.111\n\nIn the case of the premier intelligence agency, the Iraqi National Intelligence Service (INIS), this effort went far beyond the “undoing” of Kadhimi-era counter-intelligence successes against Tehran-backed militia penetration of domestic intelligence agencies.112 Instead, for the first time, the INIS leadership moved to muqawama-adjacent officials, resulting in the downgrading and limitation of a host of sensitive and valuable liaison relationships with Western intelligence agencies.au To give concrete examples, the Shi`a Coordination Framework factions were careful not to openly install a militia-linked head of the service (and could not agree which faction would provide the candidate),av but unprecedentedly, the senior INIS directorates were split up between Shi`a Coordination Framework factions, albeit seemingly with care not to place known members of U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations (such as KH and AAH) in a position to control the “crown jewels” of the U.S.-built INIS organization (such as signals intelligence).113 Key changes included:\n\nThe INIS Director of Counterintelligence appointed in early 2023 is Faisal Ghazi al-Lami, a nephew of U.S.-designated human rights abuser PMF chairman Falah al-Fayyadh,aw and a long-term protégé of KSS leader Abu Alaa al-Wala’i. The Assistant Director of Counterintelligence, Ali Najim, was nominated by Nouri al-Maliki.114\n\nThe INIS Director of Internal Security Khalid Arab, appointed in early 2023, was nominated by Nouri al-Maliki. The new director’s brother is head of security for al-Maliki’s Daawa Party, a role that requires a high level of vetting within the muqawama and by IRGC-QF.115\n\nThe INIS Director of Surveillance is Wissam al-Mihyawi, nominated by Falah al-Fayyadh.116\n\nThe muqawama similarly moved quickly to penetrate and compromise Iraq’s most effective military force, the U.S.-built Counter-Terrorism Command (CTC).117 Though the force is slated to expand under al-Sudani’s military spending plans, it is opening its doors to muqawama recruits to an unprecedented extent. Militia Spotlight’s research suggests 2,400 of 2,900 new recruits in 2023 were nominated by Shi`a Coordination Framework players including U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations Kata’ib Hezbollah and Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq, and also by non-designated players like al-Maliki and Badr.118 A wide-ranging leadership reshuffle was underway in Iraq’s CTC at the time of publication.ax KH military units within the PMF have flaunted their seniority over the CTC and other Iraqi Security Forces since the formation of the Sudani government, engaging in at least two known firefights with military units in the first year of al-Sudani’s term.ay\n\nThe next agency to be transferred to muqawama control was the National Security Service (NSS), a domestic security service with the largest current authorized manpower of any Iraqi intelligence agency,az that has been strongly penetrated by muqawama operators since its inception.ba After al-Sudani was appointed as prime minister, leadership of NSS was given to Abu Ali al-Basri (Abdal-Karim Abd-Fadil Hussein), the legendary former head of the Falcons counterterrorism unit, and a Daawa member since the 1970s, with decades-spanning connections to the IRGC-QF and Iran’s intelligence services.bb Abu Ali al-Basri was dual-hatted with leadership also of a new Supreme Committee for Combating Corruption,bc which thus far has mainly focused on pursuing former Kadhimi team members under allegations of corruption.119 In partnership with the new Badr leadership of the Commission on Integrity,120 the Supreme Committee has shamelessly pinned the blame for the $2.5 billion Badr-runbd “heist of the century”be on the exact Kadhimi team members who exposed the fraud.121 Among the NSS director-level changes made under the Sudani government,bf the most significant is the appointment of AAH fighter Ahmed al-Tayyar as the deputy director of NSS in January 2023.122 Other important NSS roles—the director of operations and the head of Baghdad security operations—seem to have also fallen to AAH officials.123\n\nThe third major intelligence agency to be extensively restaffed by the muqawama was the Ministry of Interior’s Federal Information and Investigations Agency (FIIA), Iraq’s version of the U.S. FBI, another large agency where (like NSS) the Kadhimi-era effort to remove militiamen had only just begun when the Sudani government came in.124 Mohammed Atta, a new al-Sudani-appointed director of FIIA, was nominated by al-Maliki and agreed between all the Shi`a Coordination Framework senior leaders.125 The Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism (Abu Ali al-Basri’s old Falcons cell) was also placed under new al-Maliki-nominated leadership by the Sudani government, namely an al-Maliki ally called Ali Abdal-Rida, although the unit is actually commanded directly by an Iraqi IRGC-QF officer called Ammar al-Zirjawi, who previously worked directly with Qassem Soleimani.126 For old Iraq hands, this will stir up old memories of Abu Ali al-Basri’s Office of Intelligence and Security (OIS) in the early 2010s, which al-Maliki built up as a kind of coup-detection capability with advanced communications monitoring and human networks.bg\n\nAlongside intelligence agencies, the muqawama actors also quickly restaffed Iraq’s airport, port, border, and customs positions. These are vital roles for counter-intelligence and in the suppression of dissidents, ensuring the government knows exactly who and what is entering and leaving the country (even via the Kurdistan Region).bh First, INIS lost its longstanding primacy for security operations within Baghdad International Airport,127 with the role given to an AAH-controlled official called Mazin al-Shibli, who previously served as the Director of Iraq’s Civil Aviation Authority Operations.128 Control of Umm Qasr port and land points of entry have been split among Shi`a Coordination Framework actors from Badr, Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq, Kataib Jund al-Imam, and Ahmed al-Asadi’s PMF Brigade 6,129 with observers from the prime minister’s office in each area.bi\n\nA further aspect of regime security, reflecting the impact of protests between 2019 and 2022 on the psyches of both the muqawama and the Iranian regime, has been the controlling of public spaces, especially online communities.130 Under the Sudani government, this effort has been led by Iraq’s Communications and Media Commission (CMC),131 whose board was taken over by a majority group of Shi`a Coordination Framework officials after al-Sudani took office.132 The new CMC board includes officials from U.S.-designated terrorist group Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq133 bj and from Iraqi Radio and Television Union,134 an offshoot of Iran’s U.S.-sanctioned Islamic Radio and Television Union (IRTVU).bk\n\nOn March 16, 2023, a draft of a new CMC regulation policy on digital content (Regulation No. 1 of 2023 for Digital Content in Iraq)135 was leaked136 and quickly drew criticism from 12 international organizations for its threatened crackdown on freedom of expression and online dissent.137 CMC also serves a powerful defensive purpose for muqawama information operations. It controls the Iraqi internet domain (.iq)bl that many muqawama channels are forced to use due to international domain seizure and blocking actions against them.138 The CMC has also increased its efforts to block overseas content for Iraqi internet users and introduced a platform for citizens to denounce users or nominate candidate materials for blocking.139\n\nDeveloping the Parallel Military\n\nAlongside deepened intelligence community penetration and digital regulation by militias, the muqawama factions have also taken steps since October 2022 to bolster their key security powerbase, the PMF.140 Since the January 2020 death of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the role of acting operational commander of the PMF passed to Kata’ib Hezbollah’s Abu Fadak, a trustee of Qassem Soleimani and al-Muhandis.bm Abu Fadak fared quite well during the Kadhimi era, with the PMF being off-limits to Kadhimi’s security sector reform efforts and with internal chaos weakening Abu Fadak’s rivals inside KH.141 He spent much of 2021 and 2022 undermining potential future rivals for control of the PMF—the so-called “shrine militias” answering to the senior Shi`a cleric Ali al-Sistanibn—and trying (with limited success) to achieve greater personal control of KH-led elements of the PMF influenced by his rival Abu Hussein, such as the Central Security Directorate.bo\n\nUnder the Sudani government, with no fear about the future dissolution of the PMF, Abu Fadak appears to be executing the expansion and professionalization plans that al-Muhandis sketched out in his executive orders 237 and 331 (as PMF deputy chairman) in 2019.142 The greatly expanded three-year national budget passed by the Sudani government in June 2023143 included a near doubling of registered PMF fighters (from 122,000 to 238,000); the provision of long-term government benefits to these personnel; expansion of the PMF civil works and industrial base; and unprecedented intelligence-gathering arrangements that are excluded from civilian oversight.bp The PMF, and particularly Abu Fadak’s KH cadre in the PMF, have shown off increasingly sophisticated drone systems, including Iranian-provided Mohajer-6 unmanned combat aerial vehicles (as opposed simply to one-way loitering munitions).144\n\nThe first year of the al-Sudani government also saw authorization of a 50-fold increase in the number of PMF officer trainees put through Ministry of Defense academiesbq and the graduation of PMF general officers (including U.S.-designated terrorists and human rights abusers)br through Iraqi staff colleges.145 Based on Militia Spotlight’s multiple studies on these developments, the authors assess that PMF senior commanders are being groomed to command higher headquarters of the Iraqi military, including non-PMF army and federal police units, akin to the way officers in Iran’s IRGC can control units of the regular Iranian army, navy, and air forces.146 The use of Iraqi Ministry of Defense training and educational sites is likely a stop-gap measure until the PMF training directorate (intended by al-Muhandis to include six sub-directorates that included a PMF command and staff college and a junior officer academy) can be developed.147 An investigative report by Iraq Oil Report quoted one officer cadet describing the 2023 officer training as “the fruit that Hajj Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Qasem Soleimani … put in so much effort to achieve.”148 The overall objective of the muqawama is clearly to develop the PMF into a clone of the IRGC: a parallel military with greater political support than the conventional armed services, and (as the section below details) with its own economic conglomerates.\n\nPart Five. Sharing the Spoils: Militia Control of a Top-Five Oil Exporter\n\nMuqawama control of Iraq’s government—now without even a notional sharing of the spoils with Moqtada al-Sadr—puts the Iraqi militias into a league of their own as the economic powerhouse of Iran’s partner forces. Iran’s longest-serving proxy, Lebanese Hezbollah, and Iran’s newer Yemeni partner, the Houthi movement,149 are economic minnows compared to the Iraqi state. The Shi`a Coordination Framework-led government’s first budget is the largest in Iraq’s history: $152 billion in annual spending for three consecutive years, a roughly 50 percent increase from the last authorized Iraqi budget from 2021.150 In contrast, a bankrupt Lebanon’s expected spending was under $2 billion in 2022,151 and the country went $72 billion further into debt due to massive financial losses since 2021.152 The Houthi enclave in Yemen also has a measly budget of around $2 billion per year.153\n\nControlling the PM’s Office and “Special Grades”\n\nMuqawama control of the Iraqi prime minister’s office, and the parliament that sets budgets, and the judiciary that can be used to block spending, means that the Tehran-backed armed factions now have all the keys to the system and can accelerate their asset-stripping of the Iraqi state. In Iraq, control of ministries means control of jobs and contracts, and this control increasingly has less to do with openly appointingbs a minister and more to do with what share of “special grades” (director-generals, deputy director-generals, and general managers) in the ministry goes to one’s faction.154 No muqawama faction “owns” a whole ministry, top to bottom, and instead they spend an inordinate amount of time and energy competing over, blocking, negotiating, and eventually sharing economic opportunities generated through ministry spending.155 The appointment of “special grades” is an issue where the Shi`a Coordination Framework and al-Sudani’s prime minister’s office argued for a while before—as with control of INIS—al-Sudani gave way and let the factions begin a feeding frenzy of controlling and replacing mid-level ministry officials,156 bt emplacing militia bodyguards to watch them,bu and even engaging female officials in protective marriages to militiamen.bv\n\nThe process of horse-trading for “special grades” is arranged at the Prime Minister’s Office, with the Shi`a Coordination Framework factions sending representatives to deal with the “neutral” broker, Abdal-Karim al-Sudani, another relative of Prime Minister al-Sudani and his security advisor and personal office manager.157 To give an example, Abdal-Karim al-Sudani receives nominations and guidance regarding the hiring and firing of “special grades” allocated to U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization AAH in government formation or subsequent deals, and these nominations are delivered by U.S.-designated human rights abuser Laith al-Khazali (a senior AAH member and brother to its likewise designated terrorist leader, Qais al-Khazali).bw\n\nOverall, the large 1,200-strong Prime Minister’s Office (a formal entity, hence capitalized) is seeded with political appointees from the Shi`a Coordination Framework, many of whom were still in place after three years of attempted house-cleaning by Kadhimi. To give one high-profile example of a new appointee, al-Sudani’s head of communications is a young muqawama propagandist called Rabee Nader,158 who is the former head of news and current affairs at AAH’s al-Ahd TV159 and a former employee of KH’s al-Etejah TV. 160 Nader’s appointment received strong endorsement from muqawama platforms, particularly KH’s Hadaf Center for Strategic Studies,161 which referred to Nader as the “a son of the great mentor … al-Shayeb [an epithet referring to al-Muhandis].” 162 (Of note, Nader was one of four al-Sudani team members denied visas to the United States to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York in October 2023.)163\n\nMuqawama Milking of the Oil Industry\n\nTo gain a better understanding of how exactly the muqawama factions are monetizing state capture, one can look at Iraq’s Ministry of Oil (MoO), which is responsible for earning and collecting 85 percent of the government’s budget, and 42 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).164 Though Nouri al-Maliki was assigned first-among-equal status in the MoObx within the muqawama carve-up of ministries, even the wily former premier has struggled to achieve pre-notification or veto power over ministry-related actions and personnel changes initiated by other Shi`a Coordination Framework players (i.e., AAH, Badr). As an MoO employee explained to one of the authors (Knights): “Iraqi technocrats would like to be independent and get on with their jobs but that requires a boss who protects them. It wasn’t perfect under Kadhimi and the former minister [Ihsan Ismail], but it was much better and sometimes officials could appeal to them for protection. Now that’s all gone. The boss cannot protect them, so they seek a patron, to make their own top cover. The lesson we have all learned under al-Sudani is that you need a militia protector—all the way from minister to director-generals, commission managers, and department heads.”165 Another 2023 interviewee from MoO noted: “They look at every [director-general] and put them on probation. If they have a militia, they leave them alone, but if they don’t, they remove them.”166\n\nThis is not a new system but the scale is new, including a top-to-bottom review of all director-generals from October 2022 onward as a means of forcing technocrats to align with militias, most of all the dominant muqawama factions.167 Many MoO officials who previously looked to, for instance, cleric Ammar al-Hakim’s faction for political protection have now migrated toward more muscular militias such as Badr and, most frequently, AAH.168 Thus, the head of Iraq’s Petroleum Contracting and Licensing Directorate switched after October 2022 from Badr protection to AAH, sensing Qais al-Khazali’s growing power.by The most powerful individual in the MoO now is not the minister—a conflict-avoiding technocrat called Hayan Abdal-Ghani—but rather Bassim Khudair, an ambitious deputy minister whose power has been supercharged by support from Qais al-Khazali, Hadi al-Ameri, and the Iranian embassy in Baghdad.169\n\nIn a recent show of power, a highly qualified MoO technocrat was removed from his position for being “too pro-Western” and for criticizing Chinese and Russian oil reservoir management practices.170 Iran is now targeting Iraq as a major market for Iranian energy sector services and equipment, both of which are under-utilized in Iran due to U.S. sanctions, and directors are feeling increasing pressure to favor Iranian, Russian, and Chinese partnerships.bz Foreign nations are learning that the way to win business in Iraq is to work with muqawama partners.ca\n\nOil smuggling is a huge potential money-maker, and it is in the shared interest of all the Tehran-backed militias to ensure that malleable officials lead the State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) and the Basra Oil Company (BOC), which jointly oversee the export of around 3.4 million barrels per day of oil production, or three percent of global production).171 Under Kadhimi, efforts were made by enterprising SOMO and BOC officials, with cover from their minister and prime minister, to track and report illicit oil cargoes and ship-to-ship transfers moving in Basra and in Iraqi waters.172 This tracking and reporting is much less active now,cb spurring fearscc that illicit smuggling of Iraqi oil—often mixed with sanction-busting Iranian crude173 cd—will increase to the endemic levels last seen in the mid-2000s.174 Indeed, within the first year of al-Sudani’s term, the muqawama factions fought a sharp bureaucratic war over control of the Oil Products Distribution Company, a lucrative portfolio due to its potential abuse as a means of making oil volumes disappear within Iraq.ce\n\nIn particular, the muqawama’s growing post-October 2022 control of investment licenses (issued via provincial and ministry-level investment commissionscf) also grants a new unchecked capacity to divert subsidized straight-run fuel oil and heavy fuel oil to investment projects that do not exist (say, an asphalt plant or a brick factory), whereupon militias can sell the oil locally or export it.175 Oil traders are beginning to shun Iraqi exports of fuel oils because of worsening oversight of, and a post-October 2022 influx of militia-linked companies into, the Iraqi export system in Basra.176 Concern is focused on the illegal smuggling of stolen or fraudulently obtained Straight-Run Fuel Oil and Heavy Fuel Oil exported by muqawama-linked traders, and the related risk of co-mingled Iranian oil being added to such flows and presented to international buyers as Iraqi oil, thus disguising the smuggling of U.S.-sanctioned Iranian oil.177\n\nTerrorist Threat Financing via Investment Licenses\n\nWith relevance far beyond the oil sector, investment licensing is a prize that the muqawama were briefly denied during the Kadhimi era.cg This resulted in severe tensions between the Kadhimi team and the muqawama players.178 In one case, Badr’s Hadi al-Ameri and Kata’ib Hezbollah’s Abu Fadak179 tried multiple times to gain a license for a two million donum (494,000 acre) dairy and chicken farm in Samawa.180 To give a sense of why this project was fraudulent, it was a project 55 times larger than the largest dairy farm in Iraq, yet supported by almost no planning documents.181 ch This led the government to conclude that it was an effort to gain access to free land, duty-free exemption to import almost unlimited quantities of goods from Iran,182 ci and rubber-stamped visas to import low-cost foreign labor.183 When the license was refused, the investment official in charge was told by a Badr intermediary “you’ll leave [this job] on your back” (i.e., dead or injured).184 Similar land grabs were attempted with regard to extremely valuable Baghdad Airport or west Baghdad land parcels;185 cj with large blocks of units in the new city of Besmaya;186 ck and in agricultural projects in the fertile middle Euphrates.187 cl When the National Investment Council (NIC) head was offered to stay on under the Sudani government, they were told “you can stay, but your previous strategies will not work under this government. The [prime minister] cannot protect you.”188\n\nThe ultimate expression of the muqawama’s economic ambition is the repeated efforts that the militias have made to duplicate the model of IRGC’s Khatam al-Anbiya conglomerate. (This was the most successful state-owned company in Iran since 1990, receiving over $50 billion worth of contracts for the Revolutionary Guard since its formation in 1991 and sanctioned by the United States, the United Nations, and the European Union as a commercial extension of the IRGC.189) In each of the last two elections in Iraq, the front-running candidates for prime minister were asked by IRGC-QF and the muqawama whether they would support the creation of an Iraqi equivalent of Khatam al-Anbiya, and in both 2018 and 2022, the premiership went to the candidates who said yes.190 Though Adel Abdal-Mahdi was prevented from making good on this promise by strong warnings from the Trump administration against forming the company, in November 2022 al-Sudani announced the formation of “the Muhandis General Company for Construction, Engineering, and Mechanical, Agricultural, and Industrial Contracting” (or the Muhandis General Company, MGC, hereafter).191\n\nNamed after the late U.S.-designated terrorist Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis,cm the company is a unique commercial entity of a kind never before seen in Iraq. As shown in its articles of incorporation,192 the company is officially owned by the PMF. As its unwieldy full name implies, MGC can work in any sector. Uniquely for an Iraqi state company, MGC does not need cabinet or parliamentary approval to receive free land, state capital, or state-owned enterprises, or to undertake construction and demolition. In December 2022, the MGC received 1.2 million acres of government land along the Iraqi-Saudi border at no cost—an area half the size of Lebanon, and similar to prior mega-land grants pursued by muqawama actors such as Badr and KH.193 Even before MGC was formed, a PMF force had preemptively seized and cordoned off the Muthanna land parcel.cn The stretch of Muthanna province seized happens to be strategically located in an area where Iraqi militias have fired drones into Saudi Arabia and the UAE on multiple occasions since 2019.co\n\nAlthough the Sudani government has reacted to international alarm about the Muhandis General Company by trying to bury the story and slowing its growth,cp the history of the muqawama’s economic efforts in Iraq suggests that it will keep trying to make an Iraqi Khatam al-Anbiya, which it views as the spoils of war owed to the PMF, much like the IRGC saw Khatam al-Anbiya as its reward for fighting the Iran-Iraq War.194 The Muhandis General Company is itself not the first name used in Iraq since 2018 to pursue this dream: Once it was called the Motassim project, then the Al-Rashid,195 and it may change names again, hoping to avoid notice with a lower-profile approach or by being split into multiple companies.196 In the assessment of Militia Spotlight, a version of the Muhandis General Company is likely to recur because the idea has not been rejected by top Iraqi leaders. One al-Sudani government official quite candidly told one of the authors (Knights): “The idea is to keep them [the muqawama] busy so they do not attack anyone.”197\n\nPart Six. Defined by Resistance: The Future of Anti-U.S. and Anti-Israel Operations\n\nAn influential model introduced by Chatham House in February 2021 suggested that Iraqi militias can be categorized as “parochial”198 (militias focused primarily on political and economic activities such as Badr and AAH) or “vanguard”199 (militias focused primarily on resistance activities, such as KH, Nujaba, and KSS). As Militia Spotlight noted as long ago as the October 2021 CTC Sentinel article, those distinctions are much less apparent when Tehran-backed militias are investigated in detail.200 Most of the so-called “vanguard” are highly active in the “parochial” business of state capture and asset-stripping, including all the different wings of KH.201 Conversely, there are almost no purely “parochial” militias within the Shi`a Coordination Framework: As the authors noted in their October 2021 CTC Sentinel piece, AAH and even Badr sometimes act more as “drivers of rhetorical and kinetic escalation due to their domestic political and factional needs” as self-styled muqawama players.202\n\nSince the return of anti-U.S. militancy in Iraq between 2017cq and 2019,203 the “vanguard” forces in Iraq have been exceptionally compact, for operational security and because only a handful of small cells need to be ready at any moment to strike out at U.S. bases, Gulf States, or other shared enemies of the Iraqi muqawama and Iran.\n\nIn Militia Spotlight’s assessment, KH, AAH, Nujaba, and KSS all continue to undertake kinetic violence until the time of publication.204 Akram al-Kaabi may have been boosted as the most visible spokesman of the kinetic resistance factions since December 2021,205 but Militia Spotlight considers a substantive Kaabi leadership role to be very unlikely based on an accumulation of evidence that groups such as KH, AAH, or KSS would not place their kinetic attack cells under the control of an outsider and a rival, even if pressured to do so by IRGC-QF.206 It is much more likely that Kaabi, Nujaba, and Nujaba-linked media and brands (such as Ashab al-Kahf) are simply the most vocal and visible elements of the kinetic arm of the muqawama.207 Kaabi directly controls some very active kinetic cells, as does Laith al-Khazali and senior AAH fighters, and likewise Abu Hussein of KH and Abu Alaa al-Wala’i of KSS. None of these players are entirely “parochial.”208\n\nThe post-October 7 Gaza crisis provides some interesting new data on the issue of militant “vanguard” activities by all the muqawama factions, including Badr209 and AAH.210 An early analytic ‘cut’ of the greatly intensified kinetic attacks undertaken against U.S. sites in Iraq and Syria during the 2023 Gaza crisis provides further evidence of orchestration and cohesiveness. From October 7-17, the muqawama postured and prepared, but did not strike U.S. bases until October 17-18, 2023,211 the tempestuous night of the Al-Ahli Hospital explosion in Gaza. Militia Spotlight’s daily monitoring of the anti-U.S. attacks thereafter has picked out the following trends in the kinetic behavior of the muqawama factions:\n\nBadr: The Gaza crisis has even seen the most genuinely parochial militia, Badr, openly call for attacks on U.S. bases and U.S. persons if the United States actively participates in the conflict.212\n\nAAH: Qais al-Khazali has been very cautious to appear as the least kinetically focused muqawama leader, but also one with enough apparent independence to impudently preempt major speeches by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei or by Lebanese Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah.213 AAH’s military wing under Laith al-Khazali tends to operate wherever it wishes, working across the agreed boundaries, albeit with greater reticence to openly claim kinetic attacks, especially against diplomatic targets in its traditional area of operations in Baghdad.cr During the Gaza crisis in the fall of 2023, Qais al-Khazali and AAH have been openly mocked by other muqawama militants for not pulling their weight in anti-U.S. attacks.214\n\nNujaba and KSS: In contrast, Nujaba’s Akram al-Kaabi and KSS’ Abu Alaa al-Wala’i have shown great deference toward Iran and Hezbollah, and also with open commitment to kinetic operations: Indeed, both men made well-publicized visits to Lebanon after October 7, 2023, and Kaabi followed a Khamenei speech on November 1, 2023, with an open call to “liberate Iraq militarily” from the U.S. presence.215 Nujaba probably undertook one of the two attacks on the first night of intensified Gaza-related anti-U.S. strikes—the October 18 drone attack on the U.S. site at Harir, Iraq.216 KSS was added by the United States to the Specially Designated National list on November 17, 2023, because it “has planned and been involved in attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria.”217\n\nKH: The most interesting full-spectrum response has come from KH, which led its post-October 7 reaction with a rare public statement by KH Special Operations head Abu Hussein,218 but which also saw their Hoquq parliamentary bloc call for legislative efforts to remove U.S. forces,219 all while Abu Fadak placed the PMF on a wartime footing in case of an attack on Iraq by Israel, a stance that was then mirrored by the Sudani government and the non-PMF regular military. 220 KH is perhaps the only muqawama actor to balance being a key kinetic actor—striking the first blow (at the U.S. site at Al-Asad)221 of the Gaza-related attack series—with a role in political warfare and exploitation of the crisis for state capture purposes, by strengthening the PMF’s leadership of the security sector.222\n\nThough the various muqawama factions have jockeyed and tried in small ways to outshine each other, the strong overall impression since the Gaza crisis began is one of strenuous exertion to maintain cohesion and unity.223 This is probably a deliberate effort, led by IRGC-QF.224 The post-October 17 strikes on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria (numbering 117 at the time of writing on December 19) have mostly been claimed under a single new “purpose-made” online brand (i.e., a Telegram channel) that emerged on October 18 called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, or IRI (Al-Muqawama al-Islamiyah fi al-Iraq), linked to an IRGC-QF-chaired Al-Aqsa Flood Coordination Room in Baghdad, and intended to demonstrate intra-muqawama solidarity.225 The first time that Nujaba is assessed to have used the IRI brand, it also (erroneously it seems) co-claimed using the Tashkil al-Waritheen brand226 (which was previously used for Nujaba-linked attacks on U.S. bases in Kuwait and Syria227). Mostly, however, the use of the generic IRI “press release” for attacks has been impressively uniform, with practically no competing claims and a close correlation between claimed and proven attacks.cs In Militia Spotlight’s view, this is a strong indicator of both a “guiding hand” (i.e., IRGC-QF, which typically is involved in coordinated actions)228 and a high degree of intra-muqawama cohesion229—almost the opposite of the discord that was documented in the authors’ October 2021 CTC Sentinel article.ct\n\nThe anti-U.S. strikes since October 18, 2023, suggest an unchanged geographic division of labor when it comes to threatening U.S. forces since the October 2021 CTC Sentinel piece, a trend that has been sustained under the time of writing. In the October 2021 study, Militia Spotlight described the system of military committees in detail,230 and based on the authors’ information collection, the system remains active and largely unchanged.231 This means a leadership committee (now likely renamed the Al-Aqsa Flood Operations Room) chaired by Kata’ib Hezbollah, advised by an IRGC-QF “connection officer,” and attended by KH, Nujaba, KSS, AAH, and Badr. 232 In terms of geographic areas of responsibility, KH seems to strike the U.S. sites at Al-Asad and Tanf, south of the Euphrates,cu while Nujaba and KSS cover the U.S. targets north of that river, within Iraq and Syria.cv As in 2021, AAH may not be fully integrated into such deconfliction measures233 and may have been involved in strikes in October-December 2023 that occurred outside of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claim mechanism.cw\n\nA final and possibly controversial observation regarding muqawama strikes on U.S. sites during the Gaza crisis (at least until the time of writing on December 19) has been an apparent “casualty-limiting” intent witnessed across most strikes, whereby the intent usually appears performative but is mostly not optimized to cause U.S. fatalities (and thus trigger significant U.S. retaliation).234 Casualty-maximizing tactics—such as the ‘swarming’ of drones to overwhelm base air defenses—have been rarely (or arguably not at all)cx observed since October 17, 2023.cy Targeting has often been focused on emptier parts of bases or indeed on evacuated sites.cz Rockets have achieved uncommonly low numbers of hits within base complexes.da There have also been unusual indications of the repeated non-detonation of drone warheads.db In Militia Spotlight’s view, this is another strong indicator that the IRGC-QF have achieved enough control over tactical and technical choices that they once again have a more effective “safety catch” on the escalatory risks posed by Tehran-controlled militias in Iraq and Syria.235 This appears to have been especially common across attack cells.236 In the Nujaba or KSS areas, there is more of a question-mark, and it is notable that most U.S. retaliatory strikes have followed large rocket salvoes on U.S. bases assessed to be within the Nujaba and KSS areas of operation, suggesting greater risk acceptance by these groups to undertake less predictable attacks using unguided weapons.dc\n\nAnalytic Conclusions and Lessons\n\nThe Militia Spotlight team’s prior October 2021 analysis in CTC Sentinel described a loss of cohesion within the muqawama and between its factions and the new IRGC-QF commander Esmail Qaani during his first year in the job. At the point of writing that article, the muqawama had almost hit rock bottom, which occurred when their electoral defeat became clear. This near-death experience for the so-called post-2003 “Shi`a project”dd of Iran and the muqawama factions seems to have fostered realism and unified the various players against common enemies: Moqtada al-Sadr, the Barzani family leadership of the Kurdistan Region, Mohammed al-Halbousi’s leadership of the Sunnis, and the former Kadhimi government officials. The turnaround of muqawama fortunes in 2022 was not delivered via the barrel of a gun but rather by a series of cool-headed and coordinated moves by Qaani, Judge Faiq Zaydan, Hadi al-Ameri, Nouri al-Maliki, and Qais al-Khazali.\n\nWhile al-Khazali is dynamic and remarkably confident, the experienced heads like Hadi al-Ameri have also proven their value within an IRGC-QF-orchestrated effort and should not be overlooked as key players within the muqawama. Al-Ameri may be older than al-Khazali by 20 years (al-Ameri is 69 versus al-Khazali’s 49), but he has proven to be a wily old fox when it comes to the asset-stripping of the Iraqi state, drawing on a (literal) wealth of track record in illicit business activities,de most famously the so-called “Heist of the Century” in which Badr officials at Iraq’s Tax Authority methodically found ways to successfully empty $2.5 billion from the state’s coffers, even as Kadhimi-era officials tried numerous ways to block their efforts.df As a result, Badr still has a powerful war chest; significant paramilitary capabilities;dg and good relations with Iran. Able to work with anyonedh—and go toe-to-toe with anyone—Hadi al-Ameri has, for example, gained valuable director-general slots in the Ministry of Oil by allying with Qais al-Khazali and Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to outmaneuver al-Maliki in the first half of 2023.237\n\nKata’ib Hezbollah is also arguably in a much-improved position from its fractious state when the authors published their last CTC Sentinel article in October 2021. This is arguably because the role division within KH has become clearer after firm intervention from the office of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei:di there is a special operations wing under the strong family network of Abu Hussein, the KH Shura Council secretary general and head of KH-Iraq Special Operations.dj Abu Hussein’s wing of KH solidified after a period of post-Muhandis incoherence.dk Abu Hussein’s ally, PMF head of security Abu Zainab al-Lami, became a staff college graduate238 and a leading player in Baghdad real estate corruption.239 Another Abu Hussein trustee, Hossein Moanes Faraj al-Mohammadawi (also known as Abu Ali al-Askari), is now a prominent parliamentarian, able to live a relatively normal political life, out of the shadows, while still burnishing his resistance credentials using the online Abu Ali al-Askari persona.dl Other KH Shura Council and mid-level officials have been given prestigious and financially rewarding security roles.240\n\nThe other main wing of KH—the more favored and predictable PMF wing led by Abu Fadak—seems to have ceased feuding with Abu Hussein’s power base and instead focused on state capture and profiteering. Abu Fadak now has effective control of most of KH’s intelligence and military assets,dm and some of its international money-laundering networks.dn Within Iraq, he has tried, with Hadi al-Ameri’s active assistance, to push the development of numerous PMF-owned economic projects,do most notably the Muhandis General Company, and has further extended his (Abu Fadak’s) trustees into roles of strategic and economic value. Abu Fadak has thus presided over a period of stability, growth, and now professionalization of the PMF, and he now faces no challengers in this role.241\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nIn the opening year of the al-Sudani government, the “pie” of Iraq’s economy and government jobs was big enough to accommodate all the muqawama’s looters, and a three-year package of back-to-back record-spending budgets is intended to keep the factions satisfied.242 Completion within the muqawama seems muted at the moment: Badr and AAH are playing well, the wings of KH seem content with their role division and respective spoils, and the Nujaba and KSS cells are busy with anti-U.S. attacks. What could change this placid picture?\n\nThe December 2023 provincial elections are one potential divider. Demonstrating his trademark optimism, Qais al-Khazali is planning to compete the December 2023 provincial elections separately from Hadi’s Badr and Falah al-Fayyadh in Diyala province, the birthplace and tribal base of both Ameri and al-Fayyadh.243 This suggests a clear test of relative strength is imminent.244 Both al-Ameri and al-Fayyadh are older generation leaders from the “outside resistance” to Saddam and the new-school of former Sadrists (like Qais and Laith al-Khazali, and Akram al-Kaabi) are gunning for them, as are younger IRGC-QF trustees such as Abu Alaa al-Wala’i, Abu Hussein, and Abu Zainab al-Lami.245 This generational divide may be a future faultline, and the older tribal-backed veterans may prove more durable than expected, especially as they have a long track record with Iranian leaders. A change of Supreme Leader in Iran, when Khamenei passes, could tip the balance to the new generation.246 dp\n\nFor counterterrorism analysts, the effective loss of the Iraqi state to Tehran-backed terrorist groups and militias to an unprecedented degree is pregnant with implications, especially in the fields of counter-terrorism threat financing. In general, the intelligence resources dedicated to counter-threat financing in Iraq should be greatly boosted because of the order-of-magnitude increase in the funds that might increasingly be available to the Axis of Resistance due to the Iran-led bloc’s inheritance of uncontested control of a three-year program of $456 billion of approved government spending.dq\n\nAny major Iraqi company working in a key industry (such as oil exports) who has received significant contracts since October 2022 should be thoroughly investigated, especially if they previously had no track record in the sector where they have been awarded work by the al-Sudani government. Oil smuggling originating in, or passing through, Basra’s offshore areas requires very close monitoring by the United States, because (as noted earlier) the Iraqi government is no longer effectively keeping watch. The Iraqi Oil Tankers Company, the General Company for Ports in Iraq, and all companies involved in refining, oil transportation, vessel management, and ship-to-ship transfers in Iraqi waters.\n\nAnother necessary focus area is the project to build a Khatam al-Anbiya-type conglomerate, perhaps in component pieces initially and with efforts made to better hide its existence. Major company formation (especially when the PMF is involved), investment licenses, and land grants should all be closely watched by the U.S. Treasury, anti-corruption and anti-terrorist watchdogs, and citizen journalists. In particular, great attention should be paid to the development of PMF-owned or militia-owned complexes near Iraq’s borders—facing Saudi Arabia, in western Anbar, or elsewhere probably functioning as large free-trade zones or logistical transshipment sites but ideal for dual-use as advanced conventional munitions storage and launch locations.dr\n\nEngagement of Iraqi government organs should be much more carefully vetted due to extraordinary and accelerating penetration of these agencies by U.S.-designated terrorist organizations, U.S.-designated human rights abusers, and U.S.-designated corrupt actors. The most important is the need to pay more attention to the judiciary. Analysts should focus much more effort on Faiq Zaydan and other senior and mid-level judges, working on a smart assumption that al-Muhandis probably did not plant just one seed in the judiciary (Zaydan) but many. U.S. security assistance to Iraqi security forces must also be reassessed in light of the new and significant muqawama penetration of agencies such as INIS, CTC, and Baghdad International Airport.\n\nFrom a great power competition perspective, Iraq falling under the control of anti-U.S. forces should be an issue of great significant and growing interest. The most vocally anti-U.S. resistance leader in Iraq, Akram Kaabi, is now a welcomed visitor in Moscow since 2022,247 and the relationship between the Iraqi muqawama and Russia rapidly bloomed after the muqawama wholeheartedly supported the invasion of Ukraine.248 The Russian embassy in Baghdad has continually deepened these ties, particularly since the Gaza crisis began, providing opportunities to exploit Iraqi anger to weaken U.S. “soft power” in Iraqi society.249 The Iraqi muqawama’s role in supporting anti-U.S. operations in Syria is an obvious initial point of collaboration, and at least one effective anti-U.S. attack in Syria (at the Rmeilan Landing Zone in March 2023) has contained hints of Russian support for a lethal “offset action” to pay the United States back for its provision of lethal support to Ukraine.ds\n\nMore focused on economic fruits, China has also created deep inroads with the muqawama factions, receiving their support for China’s Belt and Road Initiative sub-projects in Iraq,250 for Chinese oil-for-infrastructure loans,251 and for preferential—often corrupt—Chinese access to energy contracts.dt\n\nAs Iran and its Axis of Resistance tighten their ties to Russia and China, an Iraq dominated by the muqawama is in danger of being drawn into this loose anti-Western coalition in the future.

Additionally, the project interviews officials and politicians with direct insight into the internal affairs of militia groups. The Militia Spotlight team undertakes large numbers of anonymized interviews on an ongoing basis. All the interviews were undertaken on deep background due to the severe physical security threat posed by militias, and great care was taken, and is needed in future, to ensure that such individuals are not exposed to intimidation for cooperating with research. The mechanics mainly involve a dense web of communications with Iraqi interviewees using secure messaging applications, amounting to hundreds of specific information requests to verify data and multi-source points of detail, as well as secure transfer of large tranches of data and imagery. The authors use their combined multi-decade track record of interviewing Iraqis to assess information. Militia Spotlight analysis is thus the product of a synthesized open-source intelligence process.\n\n[b] Militia Spotlight seeks to capture information from militia sources and compile it as a record of militias “in their own words” and “by their own actions.” The team attempts to lay out its findings with information supporting each step in the team’s conclusions’ logical chain. Militias Spotlight captures and saves this information, though the platform does not publish every item, name, or other element of information collected. As a baseline, Militia Spotlight aims to demonstrate linkages between militias to the equivalent of a common-law civil case standard of proof—that is, by a preponderance of the evidence that the facts alleged are true.\n\n[c] Iraq has an assessed population of 41,266,109 (2023 est.) and Lebanon has 5,331,203 (2023 est.) Iraq’s GDP is assessed at $390.165 billion (2021 est.) versus Lebanon’s $72.577 billion (2021 est.), and the gap between the two is widening constantly as Iraq reports record budgets and Lebanon’s economy collapses.\n\n[d] Sadr received 900,393 votes and won 73 seats, or 12,334 votes per seat. Fateh got 462,813 votes and 14/15 seats, or around 30,000 votes per seat. Thus, Sadrist efficiency was double that of Fateh.\n\n[e] This total is by the authors’ collective tally, something of an art form as opposed to a science because not all Iraqi parliamentarians openly declare their affiliations until they have won their seats.\n\n[f] Again, these figures come from detailed analysis by the authors of Iraqi parliamentarian political affiliations and performance, either openly admitted or otherwise.\n\n[g] Again, based on a combination of admitted and proven alignments ascertained by the authors, AAH dropped from 15 of 48 Fateh seats in 2018, to four of 20 in 2021.\n\n[h] On November 18, 2021, for instance, al-Sadr stated: “If you want to participate in the formation of the government you must do the following: disband all the fasail … and hand in their arms to al-Hashd al-Sha’abi [i.e., the Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF].” Quoted in Hamdi Malik and Michael Knights, “A Fake KSS Recruitment Drive,” Militia Spotlight, Washington Institute for Near East Policy, November 27, 2021.\n\n[i] In the authors’ collective assessment, publicly advocating the issue of PMF disestablishment was a key driver for the coherence of the post-electoral response to al-Sadr’s win.\n\n[j] This underlines the view of not only Fateh and al-Maliki but also Shi`a moderates like Hakim and Abadi. These actors fear a major unrestrained growth of Sadrist power, most having fought to restrain Sadrist militias in the past.

Of note, KH members secured the launch site. Author (Knights) interviews, multiple Iraqi contacts, 2021-2022; exact dates, names, and places withheld at request of the interviewees.

The Iranian consulate in Basra was burned in 2018 and again in 2019. See “Iraqi protesters set fire to Iranian consulate in Basra,” Al Jazeera, September 7, 2018, and “Protesters burn down Iranian consulate in southern Iraq,” Guardian, November 27, 2019.\n\n[m] The loss of both Soleimani and al-Muhandis, as well as the premiership, opened up space for anti-Iran dissent in 2020. See Ray Takeyh, “Iran is losing its grip on Iraq,” The Hill, February 1, 2020, and Namo Abdulla and Mehdi Jedinia, “New Poll: Iran Losing Support of Majority in Iraq,” Voice of America, June 16, 2020.\n\n[n] In the latter half of 2020, the IRGC-QF struggled to discipline muqawama cells about not poking the outgoing Trump administration too vigorously, even threatening to withdraw Iran-provided drones. See Michael Knights, Crispin Smith, and Hamdi Malik, “Discordance in the Iran Threat Network in Iraq: Militia Competition and Rivalry,” CTC Sentinel 14:8 (2021). By late 2021, following episodes such as the November 7, 2021, drone attack on Kadhimi, the sense of an IRGC-QF loss of control was becoming more mainstream. See Shawn Yuan, “Is Iran losing some of its grip on Shia militias in Iraq?” Al Jazeera, November 12, 2021.\n\n[o] Militia Spotlight investigated the issue of which Iranian agency led Iranian policy in Iraq, and concluded in the October 2021 CTC Sentinel article that “multiple interviewees in a position to know are unanimous that IRGC-QF still leads Iraq policy for Iran. IRGC-QF primacy in Iraq is still recognized by the Office of the Supreme Leader, Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), IRGC Intelligence Organization, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Lebanese Hezbollah.” See Knights, Smith, and Malik, “Discordance in the Iran Threat Network in Iraq.”\n\n[p] Based on interviews with Iraqi officials and politicians at the time, there is good evidence that Abu Fadak (Abd’al-Aziz al-Mohammadawi, acting as Popular Mobilization Forces operational commander since February 2020) was given the first chance to try to replicate Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis’ “grip” on the Iraqi muqawama but he failed during 2020 and 2021 to achieve this due to shortfalls in charisma, religious knowledge, or personal relationships. Author (Knights) interviews, multiple Iraqi contacts, 2020-2021; exact dates, names, and places withheld at request of the interviewees.\n\n[q] Arguably, al-Muhandis served two roles: as the head of the Popular Mobilization Forces and as the head of the anti-U.S. resistance in Iraq.\n\n[r] First, Qais al-Khazali openly named Iran as the party that caused the loss of the opportunity to evict U.S. forces in January 2020; then he rebuffed a question about Qaani’s influence by referring to anti-occupation strategy as an Iraqi decision; he stated the Iraqi muqawama’s ability to make its own drones without depending on Iran; and he noted “complications” in Iran’s relations with the muqawama. All of these are notable, and to come one after the other in a short interview was highly unusual for any muqawama faction leader. “A closer look at BBC Persian’s full interview with Asaib Ahl al-Haq leader Qais al-Khazali,” Middle East Center (MECRA), January 23, 2022.\n\n[s] Militia Spotlight noticed this in January 2022, though at the time, was unsure how to interpret it. Hamdi Malik and Michael Knights, “Militia Lionization of Esmail Qaani: Consolidation or Covering Embarrassment?” Militia Spotlight, Washington Institute for Near East Policy, January 24, 2022.\n\n[t] The AAH military commander, Laith al-Khazali had emerged by 2020 as the most muscular AAH leader, throwing his weight around to the extent that he even physically intimidated the head of the Shi`a religious endowment in Iraq and stole his house in the summer of 2019. This is described in Michael Knights, Hamdi Malik, and Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, “Honored, Not Contained: The Future of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces,” Washington Institute for Near East Policy, March 23, 2020. He was designated by the United States for serious human rights abuses later that year. “Treasury Sanctions Iran-Backed Militia Leaders Who Killed Innocent Demonstrators in Iraq,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, December 6, 2019.\n\n[u] The group flags were those of Nujaba, Ashab al-Kahf; Al-Muqawama al-Duwaliya; Liwa al-Thaireen; Liwa Thar Muhandis; Saraya Thawat al-Ashrin al-Thaniya; Rijal Allah; Liwa al-Qasim; and Al-Tashkil al-Waritheen. Crispin Smith and Michael Knights, “Akram Kaabi’s Revealing Speech,” Militia Spotlight, Washington Institute for Near East Policy, December 9, 2021.\n\n[v] In 2021, the authors noted: “The muqawama expend considerable time and effort broadcasting their interest in law and their role as its defenders, while using legal arguments and Iraqi institutions in an attempt to discredit military and political opponents. Lawfare efforts present the muqawama as legitimate upholders of Iraqi law and sovereignty (while discrediting and effectively constraining opponents). This helps maintain wider societal approval—a vital part in muqawama efforts to capture the Iraqi state. Militia Spotlight has documented the muqawama’s embrace of lawfare, and their fascination with the use of lawsuits and quasi-legal propaganda to achieve strategic ends. Militia Spotlight has also observed the militias’ fear of domestic and international law being used against them.” Knights, Smith, and Malik, “Discordance in the Iran Threat Network in Iraq.”\n\n[w] Though Iraq’s judiciary is theoretically independent of the executive and judicial branches under the constitutional separation of powers, it nonetheless historically takes the political context into account when considering the timing of important court rulings. Until 2022, it has been customary since democracy came to Iraq in 2005 to not reveal politically sensitive or impactful court rulings during government formation, even when the government formation process has stretched over many months. In Zaydan’s case, half a dozen highly impactful pro-muqawama verdicts were delivered in the first quarter of 2022. Crispin Smith and Michael Knights, “Remaking Iraq: How Iranian-Backed Militias Captured the Country,” Just Security, March 20, 2023.\n\n[x] To achieve a two-thirds majority of 218 seats, the tripartite bloc would have had to find another 50 seats, which could only have been pulled together by involving the Shi`a Coordination Framework parties. These figures come from detailed analysis by the authors of Iraqi parliamentarian political affiliations and performance, either openly admitted or otherwise.\n\n[y] The U.S.-designated terrorist Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis privately boasted on multiple occasions to Iraqi leaders that he groomed Zaydan and guided his career from 2004 onwards. Muhandis referred to Zaydan as “his project” and “his man,” stating on multiple occasions to Iraqi leaders that control of the Iraqi judiciary was his objective. Authors’ (Knights, Smith) interviews, multiple Iraqi contacts, 2021-2023; exact dates, names, and places withheld at request of the interviewees. For an analytic summary of Zaydan’s actions in the post-electoral period, see this article in the lawfare journal, Just Security, by Smith and Knights, “Remaking Iraq;” and Michael Knights, “Iraq’s Two Coups—And How the U.S. Should Respond,” Fikra Forum, Washington Institute for Near East Policy, August 2, 2022.\n\n[z] For instance, Zaydan was photographed praying at a gathering of IRGC and IRGC-QF commanders in Iran on December 26, 2018, sitting between Falah al-Fayyadh, the head of the Popular Mobilization Forces, and future prime minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Qassem Soleimani, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, and a number of muqawama leaders were also in attendance. See photographs published here at the Iranian Supreme Leader’s official website, available at https://www.leader.ir/ar/pictures/album/2132/grid (last accessed June 19, 2023). On other occasions, Zaydan has privately met with IRGC-QF officers such as Soleimani’s assistant Hajji Hamid Nasseri and IRGC-QF commander Esmail Qaani (both during government formation in Baghdad in 2022). These meetings took place at the houses of Hadi al-Ameri and U.S.-sanctioned Lebanese Hezbollah operative Mohammed al-Kawtharani. Zaydan also publicly refers to Soleimani and Muhandis by the Iranian and muqawama term “the leaders of victory” and Zaydan has a commemorative statue of Muhandis in his home. Authors (Knights, Smith) interviews, multiple Iraqi contacts, 2021-2023; exact dates, names, and places withheld at request of the interviewees.\n\n[aa] When Mohammed Shia al-Sudani was appointed prime minister on October 27, 2022, Zaydan was seated beside Qais al-Khazali, the U.S.-designated terrorist, with both heartily celebrating the appointment with laughs and smiles. See video and photos here: Hussein Khzali, “[A very cordial conversation between the trustworthy Sheikh Qais Al-Khazali and the President of the Federal Supreme Court … ],” X, October 27, 2022.\n\n[ab] Before the resignation, the Shi`a Coordination Framework could muster around 65 seats, but after (following the reallocation of Sadrist seats to second-placed candidates), the Framework could muster around 110. In combination with the collapse of resistance from Kurdish and Shiite tripartite bloc members, forming a two-thirds majority government became possible once again. This is the authors’ calculation, which is not precise due to the manner in which Iraqi MPs can informally caucus with each other, at will.\n\n[ac] Both al-Maliki and al-Khazali were among the most inveterate and determined opponents of the tripartite bloc because they were the most bitter adversaries of Moqtada al-Sadr, with no possibility of inclusion in an al-Sadr-led order and a high probability that both would have been undermined, prosecuted, or even driven out of Iraq. Author (Knights) interviews, multiple Iraqi contacts, 2022-2023; exact dates, names, and places withheld at request of the interviewees.\n\n[ad] Al-Maliki won 33 seats in the elections, versus 17 for Fateh. Even after the reallocation of Sadrist seats, Maliki had 37 seats to Fateh’s 29. Though Fateh can call on the support of many other smaller blocs of MPs, so can al-Maliki, and the 37 seats that Maliki holds are indispensable to the Shi`a Coordination Framework. Again, this is the authors’ calculation, taking into account the vagaries of Iraqi parliamentary caucusing.\n\n[ae] After winning a surprise 15 seats in the 2018 elections, Qais al-Khazali appeared to be the fastest-rising militia politician in Iraq. For a good example of the tenor of reporting on him, see Isabel Coles, Ali Nabhan, and Ghassan Adnan, “Iraqi Who Once Killed Americans Is a U.S. Dilemma as He Gains Political Power,” Wall Street Journal, December 11, 2018.\n\n[af] Originating in the same Sadrist current as al-Sadr, Qais al-Khazali was a favorite student of Moqtada’s father, Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and a bitter personal rival of Moqtada’s. Qais al-Khazali might have been placed under house arrest, driven into exile, or even killed if Moqtada al-Sadr had consolidated power in 2021-2022. This is Militia Spotlight’s assessment based on all the available evidence and the authors’ analytic processes.\n\n[ag] When outreach began from Moqtada al-Sadr to include Shi`a parties except al-Maliki and al-Khazali, Hadi al-Ameri and Iran considered swallowing the electoral result, which was disappointing but survivable for them both. Author (Knights) interviews, multiple Iraqi contacts, 2021-2023; exact dates, names, and places withheld at request of the interviewees.\n\n[ah] Above any other faction, Qais al-Khazali pushed al-Sudani’s candidacy, overcoming initial resistance within the Shi`a Coordination Framework toward al-Sudani. Author (Knights) interviews, multiple Iraqi contacts, 2022-2023; exact dates, names, and places withheld at request of the interviewees.\n\n[ai] Washington was not happy but at the same time did not warn Iraq to find another minister, as has happened many times in the past—most notably Hadi al-Ameri being blocked by a U.S. veto from the Ministry of Interior post in 2014. This assessment is based on multiple decades-worth of the team’s collective politics-watching across seven government formations since 2005. See also “The U.S. tells Iraq it won’t work with some Iraqi officials, Asa’ib Ahl Al-Haq responds,” Shafaq News, November 16, 2022.\n\n[aj] An Iranian national—Mohammed Ali Ridha Hussein—was charged with leading the operation that killed Troell. See Qassim Abdal-Zahra, “Iraq court sentences 5 people to life in prison in killing of US citizen, officials say,” Associated Press, August 31, 2023.\n\n[ak] Militia Spotlight assesses Nujaba and IRGC-QF to have been the executing parties in the attack, which was probably intended to kidnap Troell and present him as a spy.
