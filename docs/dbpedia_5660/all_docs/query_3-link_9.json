        "text": "Summary\n\nSaddam Hussein's record of brutally suppressing even mild dissent is well-known. When the March 1991 uprising confronted his regime with the most serious internal challenge it had ever faced, government forces responded with atrocities on a predictably massive scale. The human rights repercussions continue to be felt throughout the country.\n\nIn their attempts to retake cities, and after consolidating control, loyalist forces killed thousands of unarmed civilians by firing indiscriminately into residential areas; executing young people on the streets, in homes and in hospitals; rounding up suspects, especially young men, during house-to-house searches, and arresting them without charge or shooting them en masse; and using helicopters to attack unarmed civilians as they fled the cities.\n\nOne year later, the fate of thousands of Kurds and Shi'a who were seized during the suppression of the uprising remains unknown. While many are believed to be in detention, the government has provided little information about their location and legal status.\n\nThe rebels also committed gross abuses during the uprising, summarily executing suspected members of the security forces, including many who were in custody. Middle East Watch also condemns these abuses, though we note that they were not so systematic and sustained as those committed by the government.\n\nOver 100,000 Kurds and Shi'a who fled cities where the conflicts were particularly fierce remain displaced inside Iraq, and another 70,000 civilians are in refugee camps in Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran. Despite the harsh life they lead in these camps or as displaced persons in rebel-held northern Iraq or in the southern marshes, they have not gone home because they are afraid or because their homes have been destroyed.\n\nThe Shi'a holy cities of Karbala and al-Najaf, from which many of these Iraqis fled, are today under tight military control and largely closed to independent observers who could monitor rights conditions. Religious life is sharply restricted. Many Shi'a institutions were destroyed or badly damaged during the suppression of the uprising, or subsequently demolished on the pretext of \"modernizing\" the cities. Hundreds of clerics and their aides were arrested after the uprisings and have not been released. Religious activities at the remaining institutions have been curtailed by the state.\n\nOf all the Iraqis who have not returned to their cities since the uprising, the greatest number come from Kirkuk, a major oil-rich city that has been the subject of contention between Baghdad and the Kurds. There have been alarming reports that the homes of Kurds who fled the city following the uprising have been demolished or given to Arab families, as part of a long-standing government policy of promoting the settlement of Arabs in Kirkuk while reducing its Kurdish population. The extent of these measures has been difficult to confirm, partly because the government has kept the city under particularly tight control. Today, Kirkuk is the only city in Iraq for which Baghdad has refused a standing U.N. request to establish a humanitarian office, and few outsiders have been given the sort of access that would enable them to assess developments there.\n\nIn the remote marshes along the southern border with Iran, thousands of Shi'a who fled during the uprising lack adequate food, hygiene and medical care and are at risk of Iraqi military operations in the area. Their numbers include active rebels, army deserters and displaced persons afraid to go home. Iraqi troops have attempted to surround and impose a blockade on areas where there has been rebel activity. There were credible reports of intensified military activity in the area as recently as late April; Shi'a opposition sources have charged that past army attacks in the marshes, including a campaign during December and January, involved indiscriminate fire from helicopter gunships and heavy artillery, summary executions, and arrests of indigenous marsh dwellers suspected of assisting the rebels. Little is known with certainty about the numbers or magnitude of the military operations, due in part to Iraq's refusal to allow independent observers meaningful access to the area. There has been almost no international pressure for such access; unlike the Kurds, the indigenous and displaced population in the marshes has been virtually ignored by the world community.\n\nThe establishment of a rebel-held zone in northeast Iraq under some measure of Allied protection has put most of Iraq's Kurdish population temporarily beyond the reach of the Baath regime. The population of this zone currently includes at least 100,000 displaced civilians from south of the Iraqi-Kurdish front line and scores of thousands of Kurds who are rebuilding homes in ancestral villages that were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s by the Baath regime.\n\nAs Kurds celebrated the staging of their first free elections ever on May 19, gratification with their newfound political freedom is tempered by the continuing humanitarian crisis, sporadic violence, and uncertainty about the future. Shortages of food, fuel and medical supplies as a result of the U.N.-mandated embargo of Iraq and Baghdad's refusal to sell oil to purchase humanitarian goods on terms imposed by the U.N., have been exacerbated since October by an embargo imposed by the Iraqi government on the rebel-controlled area. Many of the displaced persons and returning villagers live in substandard, makeshift shelters, despite a massive effort by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and relief organizations to house them before last winter. Unmarked minefields continue to claim dozens of victims each month, and thousands of jittery civilians flee their homes each time Iraqi troops shell an area or clash with Kurdish rebel forces.\n\nAs the expiration dates approach for both the Allied Combined Task Force in Turkey and the United Nations presence in Iraq, Kurds are watching Iraq's military buildup near the front line with great wariness. The international presence in the area clearly has helped to deter Iraqi attacks on the Kurds. Many Kurds are convinced that if the Allied Combined Task Force withdraws from Turkey, Saddam will launch a major offensive to retake the rebel-held zone. This would almost surely prompt an exodus of Kurds similar to the one that occurred only one year ago.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn view of the enormous magnitude and continuing nature of human rights abuses in Iraq, Middle East Watch believes that the stationing of human rights monitors inside Iraq is an essential, though not sufficient, step for safeguarding the rights of civilians. So long as the government of Iraq obstructs the free inquiry into human rights conditions by local and foreign organizations, journalists, and others, an alternative means of human rights monitoring is needed.\n\nMEW calls on the international community to demand, and the government of Iraq to accept, a continuing presence of independent human rights observers inside Iraq. MEW endorses the recommendation of the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Iraq, Ambassador Max van der Stoel of the Netherlands, to send \"a team of human rights monitors who would remain in Iraq until the human rights situation had drastically improved and who should be able to: (i.) move freely in any part of Iraq; (ii.) investigate information concerning alleged violations of human rights; (iii.) visit, without prior notification and at the time of their choosing, places where persons are deprived of their liberty; and (iv.) observe trials and court proceedings.\"\n\nRegardless of whether such a monitoring system is implemented, the government of Iraq must comply with customary international law and the obligations it has undertaken in ratifying human rights conventions. To demonstrate its commitment to respecting human rights, Iraq should provide a public accounting of the location and legal status of every person taken into custody during or since the uprising, and allow access by family and counsel to these persons. Iraq should also release all those arrested during the uprising who, fifteen months later, have not yet been charged, or have been charged with nonviolent offenses of a political nature. Iraq should also make public all information at its disposal about the names of persons killed during the uprising and the circumstances of their death.\n\nMEW calls on the U.S. to take a leading role in marshalling world support for a human rights monitoring system in Iraq, such as the one proposed by the Special Rapporteur. The U.S. and the international community should make clear to the government of Iraq that they will not tolerate further indiscriminate attacks on civilians. MEW notes that a monitoring presence is especially needed in the remote southeastern marshes, a heavily militarized border area where there are frequent reports of army actions against suspected rebels, displaced civilians, deserters, and the indigenous residents.\n\nMEW calls on Iraq and members of the U.N. Security Council to step up the search for a solution to the impasse over the U.N.-imposed oil-for-food formula. The main victims of this stalemate are the Iraqi people, particularly the poor who cannot afford the high prices of staples. At the same time, MEW calls on Iraq to end its blockade of food, fuel and other goods going to the rebel-controlled zone in the north, which targets one segment of the Iraqi populace -- predominantly Kurds -- for punishment. Customary international law relating to both international and non-international armed conflicts, as codified in Protocols I and II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions (articles 54 and 14 respectively), prohibits starvation of civilians as a method of combat, including by attacking or removing for that purpose objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs.\n\nMEW also calls on Iraq to extend beyond June 30 the agreement permitting the U.N. to provide humanitarian aid to displaced persons wherever it is needed. MEW is concerned by the reduced presence in Iraq since April of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which has an explicit protection mandate. MEW urges the U.N. agencies remaining in Iraq to develop alternative means to provide protection to vulnerable populations.\n\nFinally, MEW calls on the political leadership of the Kurds to complete the stalled investigation into the October 1991 massacre, allegedly by Kurdish guerrillas, of some 60 Iraqi soldiers in custody in Suleimaniyya, and to punish those found to be responsible. As Kurds enhance the extent of their self-rule through parliamentary elections, the good-faith prosecution of those found responsible for this atrocity, with due-process protections for the accused, would send a strong signal of their leaders' commitment to a rule of law that is lacking in the rest of Iraq.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne year ago, towns and cities across northern and southern Iraq rose up in revolt against the government of President Saddam Hussein. In the weeks that followed, tens of thousands of civilians were killed as security forces crushed the most serious internal threat of Saddam's 12-year rule, and thousands more subsequently perished during one of the largest and most precipitous flights of refugees in modern times. This report details human rights abuses committed during the uprising and the human rights repercussions that continue until today.\n\nAs the late June deadlines approach for both the Allies' basing agreement in Turkey and the U.N. humanitarian presence in Iraq, the after-shocks of the uprising continue to be strongly felt throughout the country. About three million Iraqis, most of them Kurds, are living in the 16,000 square-mile zone of northeastern Iraq that is currently under Kurdish rebel control. While enjoying unprecedented freedom from the Baath regime, many are living in substandard conditions that are exacerbated by the eight-month-long Iraqi embargo on the rebel-held zone. Hundreds have been maimed or killed after stepping on mines that Iraqi forces planted in many areas. At least two recent bomb explosions and the suspected poisoning of two anti-regime activists indicate that Iraqi infiltrators may be active inside the rebel-held zone.\n\nThe population of the rebel-held zone continues to swell by the thousands every time government troops shell a town or skirmish with Kurdish rebels. Some 300,000 Kurds abandoned their homes in or near government-controlled areas between October and January, straining humanitarian efforts to shelter the thousands who had fled immediately after the uprising. An official of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told a reporter in January that even a minor attack on a major town would set off another mass exodus. \"We are preparing for 150,000 new refugees at any time but it's quite possible if there was another attack we'd have another 500,000 fleeing,\" he said. As recently as late March, some 40,000 Kurds fled their homes when Iraqi troops shelled towns near the Great Zab river, west of Irbil.\n\nIn the cities that rose up in rebellion last year that are now under government control, the repression is now harsher in many respects than before the uprising. In Kirkuk, the one Iraqi city for which a U.N. request to establish an office has been steadfastly refused since April 1991, the Baath regime seems to be profiting from the massive flight of refugees to accelerate its long-standing policy of reducing the Kurdish percentage of the city's population. Long the main sticking point in negotiations between Saddam and the Kurds, Kirkuk is now separated from the rebel-held zone by the heavily fortified positions of the Iraqi army. Between 70,000 and 100,000 Kirkukis have not returned home, by the UNHCR's count, and remain displaced in Kurdish-controlled towns such as Suleimaniyya; Kurdistan Democratic Party spokesman Hoshyar Zebari said the number was at least 150,000 (see Chapter One). Kurdish neighborhoods demolished around the time of the uprising remain in ruins, and Kurds charge that the government has been giving vacant Kurdish homes to Arab families who have moved north.\n\nIn the south, the plight of the Shi'a is no less dire, although less well-known because the area remains virtually closed to scrutiny by outside observers. Thousands of Shi'a, including hundreds of clerics, have been imprisoned without charge or have disappeared in state custody since the uprising; many Shi'a shrines and institutions in al-Najaf and Karbala were devastated during the rebellion or demolished by government forces in its aftermath.\n\nIn southeastern Iraq, thousands of Shi'a civilians, army deserters and rebels, primarily from the cities of Basra, al-Amara and al-Nasiriyya have sought precarious shelter in remote areas of the marshes that straddle the Iranian border. Iraq's security forces, unable to quell the low-level resistance emanating from this region, have reportedly shelled and launched military raids in the area in an indiscriminate fashion, wounding and killing unarmed civilians.\n\nMany observers believe that attacks by Baghdad on the Kurdish-held zone have been restrained to some extent by Saddam's fear that they would provoke the intervention of Allied forces. Since April 1991, the U.S. has publicly warned Iraqi troops not to fly any aircraft, including helicopters, north of the 36th parallel, to keep security forces from entering the Allies' self-declared security zone, and to refrain from attacking Kurdish civilians. As recently as April 14, an Iraqi military buildup near the front line in Kurdistan, including the emplacement of anti-aircraft batteries above the 36th parallel, prompted a warning by the U.S., Great Britain and France to reverse the buildup and to stop violating the rights of the Kurds and Shi'a.\n\nJune 28, however, is the expiration date for the Allies' accord with Turkey that allows the basing of the Combined Task Force in southeastern Turkey. The memorandum of understanding between the U.N. and Iraq is set to expire two days later. That agreement allows the U.N. to establish offices inside Iraq \"wherever such presence may be needed\" to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced persons and assist in their return. The agreement also allowed for the deployment of 500 lightly armed U.N. guards to protect U.N. installations, programs and personnel. Their presence reassures the populace to some extent, although their mandate does not explicitly include a protective function vis-à-vis civilians.\n\nKurds fear that if the credible military threat of the Allies' Combined Task Force is removed, Iraq will launch an offensive to recapture the areas of northeastern Iraq that have been under rebel control since last year, causing a new round of bloodshed and another exodus of refugees. Shi'a opposition sources in exile predict that repression in the south will also intensify as soon as Saddam feels that international scrutiny has eased.\n\nObstacles to Monitoring Human Rights in Iraq\n\nThis report relies heavily on the testimony of Iraqi refugees outside of Iraq, due to the difficulty of conducting human rights work inside the country. Since Middle East Watch was created in 1989, its requests to visit Iraq were repeatedly ignored or refused. In late 1991 Baghdad finally gave its approval in principle, but has not responded since to repeated MEW requests to provide a date when it would receive such a mission.\n\nOther international rights groups also face daunting obstacles. Since a visit in 1983, Amnesty International has not received permission to enter Iraq on terms that would enable it to conduct research in a satisfactory manner. MEW knows of no group working in government-controlled parts of Iraq in 1991 with an organizational mandate or agenda that includes the systematic documentation of human rights abuses committed by the Iraqi government. Nor are independent indigenous human-rights organizations tolerated in Iraq, and Iraqi dissidents in exile who have called attention to human rights abuses have risked murder or reprisal at the hands of Iraqi agents. While Iraq permitted access after the war to an unprecedented number of reporters and nongovernmental organizations, their freedom of movement was tightly controlled by, among other means, the official \"minders\" whose constant presence made frank conversations with ordinary Iraqis all but impossible.\n\nSuch obstacles have complicated the task of gathering accurate human rights information. For example, it is not possible to verify estimates of the numbers of persons who were killed, injured or detained during the uprising, how many were deliberately executed, how many were caught in cross-fire, or how many were unarmed civilians.\n\nThere are also many unanswered questions about the methods and arsenal used by the government troops. Refugees alleged that Iraqi helicopters dropped a variety of ordnance on civilians, including napalm and phosphorus bombs, chemical agents and sulfuric acid. Representatives of human rights and humanitarian organizations who saw refugees with burn injuries or photographs of such injuries were unable to confirm the source of the burns, although doctors who examined injured Iraqis said that some of the wounds were consistent with the use of napalm. The Iraqi government, for its part, denied using napalm, phosphorus or chemical weapons.\n\nWitnesses also gave conflicting information about which security forces were responsible for specific operations. They often identified military and security apparatuses, such as the Republican Guard, the Istikhbaraat (military intelligence), or \"Ali Hassan al-Majid's special units,\" in ways that suggested that they were unable to distinguish reliably among the myriad military and security bodies that operate in Iraq.\n\nWitnesses also accused fighters from the Iranian opposition organization Mojahedin-i-Khalq (People's Mojahedin of Iran) and Jordanian, Sudanese, Palestinian and Yemeni mercenaries of helping to suppress the uprising. They claimed to recognize the fighters' nationalities from their appearance or accents. While the testimony collected was persuasive that the Mojahedin-i-Khalq and foreign mercenaries helped Iraqi soldiers to crush the uprising, it was not possible to assess how important a role these various groups played.\n\nIn an effort to solicit comment on some of the allegations, MEW sent a letter on May 17, 1991 to Iraqi authorities asking about the types of weapons and ordnance used during the uprising, the numbers of civilians killed and wounded by government troops and by rebels, and the number of arrests after the uprising. The letter was not answered. However, statements by Iraqi officials in other contexts are quoted in this report, where pertinent.\n\nUnearthing Past Abuses\n\nPrior to the uprising, Iraqi state terror and controls on foreign visitors made it difficult to investigate human rights violations in Iraq. The uprising and its aftermath opened the floodgates on information about past abuses, and revealed that, if anything, the world community had underestimated the regime's brutality. The legacy of abuse also helped to explain the intensity and mass support of the uprising, as well as the speed and magnitude of the exodus when it collapsed.\n\nThe revelations began during the very first days of the revolt and have continued since. When rebels seized government buildings, they freed prisoners and captured huge amounts of documentary evidence of past abuses. Later, the flight of refugees beyond the reach of Saddam made it possible for an unprecedented number of Iraqis to speak publicly about past abuses. Since then, continuing rebel control over much of northeastern Iraq has enabled Kurds and foreigners to travel extensively through the Kurdish countryside for the first time since the Baghdad regime depopulated and sealed it off.\n\nHuman rights workers are only beginning to sift through the mounds of documents, videotapes and material evidence captured from Iraqi security agencies. Forensic experts are examining several mass graves that may finally provide answers to the fate of tens of thousands C Kurdish sources estimate the number at 182,000 C of Kurds who disappeared during the late 1980s in the so-called Anfal Operation, Saddam's campaign to depopulate the Kurdish countryside.\n\nThe refugees interviewed for this report provided ample testimony about past abuses. It was difficult to find a Kurd who had not lost one or more relatives during the Anfal. In the refugee camps in Iran, MEW also encountered survivors of the 1988 chemical gas attack on the border town of Halabja in which 5,000 persons are thought to have died. Many had fled from repression before, and a 35-year-old accountant interviewed by MEW was surely not the only three-time refugee: he fled in 1975 during clashes between Baghdad and Mullah Mustapha Barzani's pesh merga (Kurdish rebels), in 1988 when Iraqi jets dropped chemical gas on Halabja, and again in 1991 after the defeat of the uprising in Suleimaniyya.\n\nMany Shi'a refugees from southern Iraq testified about the forcible separation of their families during the early years of the Iran-Iraq war, when the Baath regime summarily deported tens of thousands of Shi'a to Iran on the grounds that they were of \"Iranian origin.\" Both Shi'a and Kurdish refugees, particularly young men, described being arrested in the past and tortured for suspected opposition activity; some still bore scars from ill-treatment.\n\nPrisons, including some whose location and existence had not been disclosed by Baghdad, were thrown open by rebels in both the north and the south. Accounts circulated widely about disoriented and filthy prisoners emerging from years in secret dungeons believing that Hassan Ahmad al-Bakr, Saddam's predecessor, was still president.\n\nFor many Iraqis who had been spared the harshest forms of repression, the sudden exposure of Saddam's past atrocities was a transformative experience. Even after the wrenching experience of the uprising and the exodus, many refugees were most eager to speak about the past that had finally been exposed to them. A poultry company manager from Suleimaniyya recounted how, shortly after the city was captured by rebels, he took his family to tour the once-dreaded security headquarters (Da'irat al-Amn). \"We saw cells that were 1 by 1.5 meters, cells with hooks high in the wall, for tying prisoners' hands behind their backs,\" he said. \"What we saw was indescribable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kurds in Irbil were crowding into the Ministry of Culture to view a hastily assembled exhibit of photographs showing the aftermath of the chemical-weapons attack on Halabja. The images, well-known in the West, had never been seen before in Kurdistan. \"It's something horrible, an Iraqi army deserter told a Wall Street Journal reporter. \"I\n\nChapter One\n\nThe Continuing Human Rights Repercussions of the Uprising\n\nDetentions and Disappearances during the Uprising\n\nThousands of Iraqis arrested by Iraqi security forces during the suppression of the uprising in March and April 1991 have not been released, and relatives have received little or no news about them. The bulk of the detained population is from southern Iraq, where a smaller percentage of the population fled their homes than in the north.\n\nIraq claimed last October that security forces had arrested a total of 15,105 persons for participating in the disturbances, of whom 14,005 had been amnestied and 1,100 were to be tried. While many were indeed released from detention, the numbers are not clear. No one has compiled a comprehensive list of Iraqis reported missing or detained since the uprising. No independent organization, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, has had access to Iraqis detained by the government since the uprising.\n\nThe partial lists that have been prepared by various groups suggest that the number of missing persons exceeds the government's figure of 1,100, although no reliable estimate is possible. As Gulf War Victims, a Teheran-based Iraqi relief group, put it, \"Everyone will tell you that in each city of the south, thousands of people disappeared after the entry of the army, either during the fighting or in the clean-up operations afterwards....But no reputable person will venture anything more specific than that.\"\n\nAmbassador Max van der Stoel, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Iraq, submitted to the government of Iraq a list of 78 persons reported to have disappeared during the uprising in the south. In October 1991, the government denied having any information about them:\n\nAfter a careful investigation, the competent authorities have ascertained that the persons named in the above-mentioned annex are not currently in Iraq and were probably either killed during the disturbances or fled to Iran, Saudi Arabia or other States with those who participated in the disturbances....\n\nThe Rapporteur rejected this explanation, saying it was \"somewhat difficult to believe that those who made these allegations would not be aware of either the death or escape to another country of the persons concerned.\" The Rapporteur went on to point out that Iraq has failed to provide information on numerous cases of disappearances over the past decade. MEW has also documented a pattern of evasive or misleading answers by the Iraqi government to such inquiries.\n\nThe March 1992 report of the U.N. Special Rapporteur contains the names of nearly 200 Kurds who are said to have disappeared since being taken into custody during or shortly after the uprising in the north. Since the publication of that report, the government of Iraq has issued no response to the list of cases. The office of the Rapporteur submitted details of these persons' identity documents to the U.N. Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. In its session of May 18-22, 1992 in New York, the Working Group agreed to submit these names, along with the names of 7,000 Iraqi Kurds who are said to have disappeared well before the uprising, to the government of Iraq.\n\nAlso missing to this day are an unknown number of Kurdish men who were among the several thousand rounded up from Kurdish neighborhoods of Kirkuk days before the outbreak of the uprising (see Chapter Two). While most of those arrested were released within five weeks, some have never reappeared. Baghdad refused to comment on their fate when the matter was raised by the Kurdish leadership during negotiations with Baghdad, Kurdish political sources said.\n\nThe post-uprising roundups were particularly sweeping in the Shi'a holy cities of Karbala and al-Najaf. Those taken include hundreds of clerics. Between March 19 and 23, 1991, authorities in al-Najaf arrested the 95-year-old Shi'a spiritual leader Grand Ayatollah Sayyid abu al-Qassem al-Khoei, and 105 persons from his family and his associates and their families, according to Yousif al-Khoei of the al-Khoei Foundation, a Shi'a benevolent society based in London. Those arrested included the Grand Ayatollah's son, the 89-year-old Ayatollah Murtaza Kazemi Khalkhali, and citizens of Lebanon, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bahrain.\n\nIn response to a preliminary inquiry from the U.N. Special Rapporteur about 62 of the Grand Ayatollah's associates who were reportedly arrested, the government addressed only four of the cases, claiming that Sayyid Mohammad Mehdi al-Kharsan, Sayyid Mohammad Ridha al-Kharsan, Sayyid Mohammad Ali Hadi al-Kharsan, Sheikh Ibrahim al-Naserawi \"were alive and enjoying full freedom.\" The government said it had no information about the other individuals.\n\nIn January 1992, the Special Rapporteur pressed again for information about the detainees, delivering in person to Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz an updated list of 105 associates of the Grand Ayatollah whom the al-Khoei Foundation says are detained or have disappeared since the uprising. Five months later, the Special Rapporteur has received no new information from the government.\n\nYousif al-Khoei confirmed Iraq's claim that four of the 62 persons named on the original list were at liberty. However, he said that these names had been mistakenly placed on the list and that of the 105 associates of the Grand Ayatollah on the corrected list, only one, a Pakistani national, has been released. Some of the others are believed detained in Redhwaniyya detention center near Baghdad or other detention centers in Baghdad, he said, adding that their legal status was unknown.\n\nThe detained or disappeared associates of the Grand Ayatollah include two al-Hakims, the prominent Shi'a family that has been a target of severe repression in the past. The two al-Hakim clerics and eight other male members of the family, aged between 20 and 60, were arrested during or shortly after the uprising in al-Najaf, according to Dr. Saheb al-Hakim, a London-based relative. Only one of them has so far been released, he said.\n\nOther opposition sources in exile said they believed that large numbers of those arrested during the uprising were being held in Redhwaniyya. It is not known what proportion of them has been tried or executed.\n\nDisplaced Iraqis at Risk\n\nThe suppression of the uprising resulted in the exodus of over ten percent of the country's population. Iran received 1.4 million Iraqis, Turkey 450,000, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait received together some 35,000, while smaller numbers escaped to Syria and Jordan.\n\nToday, fewer than 100,000 of the Iraqis who fled across the borders in March and early April 1991 remain abroad. Some 45,000 are in Iran, 22,000 in Saudi Arabia, and 8,000 in Turkey, according to the UNHCR. Kurds, who constituted more than 90 percent of those who fled, now account for less than a quarter of those remaining abroad. The chief factor in the repatriation of Kurds is the existence of a zone inside Iraq that is controlled by Kurdish rebels and enjoys a measure of Allied military protection. Shi'a refugees, lacking any comparable safe haven in the south, are less eager to reenter Iraq.\n\nIn the early summer of 1991, the center of the humanitarian crisis shifted from Iran and Turkey back into Iraq, where hundreds of thousands of persons remained displaced in tent camps or in the rubble of demolished villages in the rebel-held north, and in the marshes along the southeastern border. The number of persons still displaced in northern Iraq as of April 1992 was estimated at 600,000 by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights; that number has fluctuated as people filter home or flee new outbreaks of fighting or shelling.\n\nApproximately three-quarters of Iraq's Kurds are now living in the rebel-controlled zone. These include Kurds who have gone back to the cities they fled in March, as well as over 100,000 who are from or near the Iraqi-controlled part of their traditional homeland who are afraid to return home or whose homes have been destroyed.\n\nA somewhat similar situation exists in the south. Although no area is firmly under rebel control or watched over by nearby Allied troops, the relatively inaccessible marshes near the Iranian border have become shelter to thousands of Shi'a who are afraid to return home. Most of the displaced Shi'a are from the three major urban areas in the area, al-Nasiriyya, al-Amara, and Basra. They include some active rebels and army deserters, as well as their families. Estimates of the number of displaced persons in the marshes run as high as 250,000. However, some observers question whether the inhospitable terrain can support a quarter of a million residents and estimate the population at well below 50,000.\n\nBaghdad's policies toward the marshes and the rebel-held north have certain similarities. Since the uprising, frequent military incursions in both areas have inflicted civilian casualties and displaced more people. Baghdad, itself squeezed by the U.N. embargo, has in turn blockaded deliveries of food, fuel, and other goods to rebel-held Kurdistan since October, while reportedly sealing off parts of the marshes and blockading food and supplies to its inhabitants. Recent reports of a government initiative to relocate part of the marsh population have prompted comparisons with Baghdad's depopulation of the Kurdish-inhabited area near the northeastern border at the end of the Iran-Iraq war.\n\nA factor contributing to the reluctance of refugees and displaced persons to return home is their distrust of the amnesty declared in April 1991 by Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council, pardoning citizens for all offenses except premeditated murder, violations of honor and theft. While some of those who refuse to return might fear being legitimately charged with such offenses, a sizeable percentage of Iraqis have good reason to distrust any offer of amnesty from Baghdad. As the U.N. Special Rapporteur pointed out, \"[A]llegations remain that the amnesties are...used as a means for rounding up members of opposition groups, and that the terms of the amnesties are frequently violated by government agents who arrest certain persons returning out of places of hiding....Several reports allege that persons already detained, as with several of those arrested during (and in violation of) amnesties, rather than being released have actually <disappeared= in the custody of the government.\" The Special Rapporteur noted significant and repeated allegations regarding Kurds from Irbil who had returned under the April 1991 amnesty and \"were detained...taken to the city stadium, subjected to punishments or executed, or have subsequently disappeared.\"\n\nSeveral refugees interviewed in Iran by MEW said they knew of Kurds who returned to Iraq in 1988 under an amnesty then in effect and were promptly arrested. A Kurdish schoolteacher from Suleimaniyya described why he did not intend to accept an amnesty this time:\n\nIn 1988, I lived in Halabja. During the chemical weapons attacks I hid in a shelter. One hundred and eighty-two of my relatives were killed. Afterward, I fled to Iran and stayed there for six months. When Saddam offered the Kurds an amnesty during the month of September, I decided to go home. But when I reached the border, the Iraqi authorities told me that I could not return to Halabja. They sent me instead to a place named Kurdechal in Irbil province, near the old village of the same name. About 6,000 of the returning Kurds were taken there. There was no housing for us at Kurdechal. I spent 25 days there sleeping under a nylon sheet. I asked to leave, but they refused. Eventually I built a lean-to, then a little house, out of mud. For one year I could not leave the place. Finally, in the second year, they allowed me to go out, but I needed permission each time. Finally, they said I could move out. I asked if I could go back to Halabja. They said I could go anywhere but Halabja, so in July 1990, I moved to Suleimaniyya.\n\nThe following month Iraq invaded Kuwait, and eight months later the schoolteacher found himself living again in a tent in a refugee camp in Iran.\n\nRebel-held Northern Iraq\n\nKurdish rebels control a 16,000-square-mile area, roughly one-tenth of Iraq and four-fifths of the land claimed by Iraqi Kurds as their ancestral homeland. The zone includes two of Iraq's governorates (Suleimaniyya and Dahuk), and much of a third (Irbil). Its current population of about three million inhabitants is almost entirely Kurdish, with small numbers of Turkmans and Christians (Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Armenians). The area encompasses both the \"security zone\" demarcated by the Allies in April 1991 and a far larger area, including the cities of Suleimaniyya, Irbil and Dahuk, that extends south and east from the security zone. Until the May 19 elections, the area was governed by the Iraqi Kurdistan Front, a coalition of eight parties formed in 1988.\n\nThe current boundaries of the zone have been relatively stable since October, when Iraqi forces established a fortified military line running northwest to southeast through the lowlands. However, incidents of shelling by Iraqi troops since then have sent scores of thousands of refugees living near the fortified line fleeing into the rebel-controlled region.\n\nThe population of the rebel-controlled zone falls into four basic categories:\n\n1. persons who remained in or returned to the homes they were inhabiting just prior to the March 1991 uprising;\n\n2. persons who took advantage of the withdrawal of Iraqi forces in order to return to villages and towns from which they had been evicted during Saddam's campaign in the 1970s and 1980s to depopulate the Kurdish countryside;\n\n3. persons who fled from areas that are currently under Iraqi control or near the front line, and are either prevented from returning, afraid to return, or have little to return to because their homes have been destroyed; and\n\n4. persons -- mostly women and children -- who move between homes in the areas under Iraqi control and temporary quarters inside the rebel-held zone, where they maintain their access to humanitarian assistance, including shelter, in the event that they are displaced again.\n\nCompared to the marshes, inhabitants of the rebel-held north enjoy a relative measure of protection, not to mention an unprecedented degree of political autonomy. The presence of Allied troops and fighter planes in neighboring Turkey, with their regular overflights of northern Iraq, have helped to reassure Kurds by offering the prospect of a swift military response should Saddam launch an offensive. The Kurds are also better off than the marsh dwellers in terms of the level of humanitarian assistance they receive and the larger presence in their midst of staff from the U.N. and relief organizations.\n\nThe Kurds still face considerable danger and adversity: harsh winters, unmarked minefields, Iraqi shelling along the front line, embargo-related shortages of affordable food, fuel and medicine, and apparent acts of sabotage by Iraqi infiltrators. None of these hardships, however, looms as large as the Kurds' fear of what Saddam may do if the Allied forces retreat at the end of their current basing agreement with Turkey on June 28.\n\nThe group facing the harshest conditions are the more than 100,000 displaced persons, most of them from Kirkuk, who cannot or will not return to homes in Iraqi-controlled areas, and are now living in tent camps, in abandoned government buildings, in makeshift shelters, or in houses in government-built \"model villages\" (see below) that were abandoned by Kurds returning to their villages.\n\nAccording to U.N. officials working in the region who asked not to be named, Iraqi checkpoints on the front line are, in general, no longer blocking the return of refugees from the rebel-held zone, as they did in the months following the March uprising. The obstruction now occurs mainly in the other direction, when civilians crossing into the rebel-held zone are searched for items deemed to violate Iraq's blockade of the zone. Soldiers routinely siphon off \"excess\" gasoline from civilian cars, and seize goods that appear to be newly bought.\n\nFear, rather than physical barriers, is the main impediment to the return home of Kurds who are displaced from towns inside or near Iraqi-held areas. Those who live near the front line are scared of shelling by Iraqi troops or skirmishes between Iraqi and Kurdish forces. According to one U.N. official, many of the Kirkukis who are not returning are young men who fear arrest as suspected pesh merga, army deserters, or uprising activists. Another U.N. official said Kurds are also deterred from returning by the heavy military presence in Kirkuk and other areas under government control, and reports of problems with local food distribution and harassment of civilians by troops. \"They just feel safer in the mountainous areas,\" he said.\n\nCivilians in the rebel-held zone who are trying to rebuild their lives in demolished villages face a distinct set of hardships. Of the some 4,000 Kurdish villages that Kurds say were demolished by the Baath regime during the Anfal (see Introduction), a total of 1,762 are currently under reconstruction, according to Iraqi Kurdistan Front figures. The UNHCR put the figure at 1,500 in April 1992.\n\nMany who are returning to ancestral villages are Kurds who had been confined for years in \"model villages\" that were built by the regime to house Kurds from demolished villages. According to a U.S. Senate staff report, these villages \"were poorly constructed, had minimal sanitation and water, and provided few employment opportunities for the residents. Some, if not most, were surrounded by barbed wire, and Kurds could enter or leave only with difficulty.\"\n\nIn the rebel-controlled zone, Kurds rebuilding homes in demolished villages probably outnumber the displaced population that cannot return to homes in or near Iraqi-controlled territory. While the UNHCR does not classify the returning villagers as \"displaced,\" they continue to face many refugee-like difficulties, especially in a period of shortages and embargoes. Le Monde's Françoise Chipaux observed during a visit in late May 1992, \"In reality, everything remains to be done, from basic restoration to the rebuilding of schools, clinics, and water and irrigation systems, along with the distribution of seeds and fertilizer to all of these peasants who for so long have been kept off their lands, which now lie fallow.\"\n\nLiving in tents or flimsy huts on the ruins of demolished homes, many spent the winter with inadequate heat and plumbing, far from medical care and regular food supplies. Some sought sturdier shelter in the cities during the winter, and returned to their villages only after the spring thaw.\n\nThe returning villagers are among those at highest risk of stepping on mines laid by Iraq both along the border with Iran as well as deeper inside Iraq to hinder the pesh merga as well as Kurdish civilians who might try to return to the sites of their razed towns and villages. A representative of MEW was told by a medical staff member at Suleimaniyya hospital on September 11 that since March, the hospital had treated 1,652 landmine patients, including 397 who had undergone traumatic or surgical amputation. A New York Times reporter who visited the area in April 1992 wrote:\n\nNo figures are available on the total mine casualties in the last year, Kurdish and relief agency medical officials said. But Dr. Delshad Kamal of the Suleimaniyya Teaching Hospital, one of three surgical hospitals in the Kurdish-controlled area, said the hospital treated about 15 new mine explosion casualties each week.\n\nDespite all of the villagers' day-to-day difficulties, the overriding concern for many is that government troops will return to the area and demolish their villages once again. \"[The Iraqi forces] want to come back,\" one villager told The New York Times. \"Everybody is always saying maybe they'll attack today or tomorrow. We're hoping they're afraid to move forward because of the Western coalition forces.\"\n\nPost-Uprising Order and Disorder\n\nThe contours of the post-uprising order in northern Iraq were established shortly after the uprising. On April 5, 1991, two days after Iraqi troops recaptured the last city under Kurdish control, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 688, which demanded that Iraq \"immediately end\" the repression of its civilian population, and allow \"immediate access by international humanitarian organizations to all those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq.\" The same day, President Bush announced that U.S. Air Force transport planes would begin flying over northern Iraq to drop supplies of food, blankets, clothing, tents, and other relief-related items near concentrations of displaced persons.\n\nBut the surging exodus and Turkey's reluctance to host a massive influx of Kurdish refugees pressured the Allies to act more decisively. On April 16, President Bush announced that a \"security zone\" would be established near the Turkish border and administered by U.S., French and British troops. The area would contain temporary tent camps to lure refugees back from Turkey and the perilous mountain areas near the border. To further reassure Kurds, President Bush ordered Iraqi troops to evacuate the \"security zone\" and to retreat at least 25 miles south of the Turkish border, and declared all of Iraq north of the 36th parallel to be off-limits to Iraqi aircraft.\n\nOther developments in April enhanced Kurdish hopes for their future security. First, Kurdish leaders and Baghdad agreed on a tentative cease-fire and resumed long-stalled negotiations on limited autonomy. Second, Baghdad agreed to an extensive U.N. relief operation inside Iraq. Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed on April 18, 1991 by Iraq and Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the Secretary General's executive delegate for humanitarian affairs in Iraq, the U.N. was permitted to establish offices inside Iraq \"wherever such presence may be needed\" to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced persons and assist in their return. The memorandum, which has been renewed and now expires on June 30, essentially restates in more consensual language the terms of Security Council Resolution 688.\n\nThe U.N. rapidly opened humanitarian offices in both government-controlled and Kurdish-controlled areas. It also deployed 500 lightly armed guards whose mandate was to protect U.N. property, services and personnel, but whose presence also enhanced the sense of security among Iraqi civilians. The majority of these guards were stationed in the Kurdish cities of Suleimaniyya, Dahuk and Irbil; relatively few were sent to the south of the country.\n\nIn June, the Allies began withdrawing from their \"security zone\" and turning over relief operations to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Allies announced that they would keep a \"residual force\" in Turkey and a monitoring team in the town of Zakho in the \"security zone.\" The residual force, based with Turkey's approval at Incirlik airbase near the city of Adana, included attack planes and battalions of air-transportable infantry.\n\nAccording to Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, the mission of the force at Incirlik was \"to stand by in the area in case there were problems in northern Iraq that required military action.\" Though cautioning that the United States \"cannot solve long-term...long-standing problems in the region between the Kurds and the Iraqis, between the Shi'a and the Iraqis,\" Williams stated that there would be \"very clear markers laid down to the Iraqis\" about their expected behavior.\n\nWhatever the markers that the Allies laid down, their military pullback coincided with a general deterioration in the security situation, following two months of relative calm and the return of over one million refugees from Iran and Turkey. With the negotiations in Baghdad bogging down and Kurds nervous about the Allied withdrawal, tensions began to mount. On June 3, four Kurds and two Iraqi officials were killed when a demonstration turned violent in Dahuk, a city outside the security zone.\n\nMajor clashes between Iraqi troops and Kurdish rebels erupted six weeks later around Suleimaniyya and Irbil. The fighting drove about 30,000 civilians in the Suleimaniyya region toward the Iranian border, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which said on July 22 that it had treated 660 wounded persons in area hospitals.\n\nFollowing the clashes, the army ceded control of Suleimaniyya and Irbil to the Kurds and pulled its forces back to the cities' outskirts. Both cities have since remained in Kurdish hands.\n\nThe July clashes, like the ones that were to follow during the summer and fall, took place well below the Allies' \"security zone,\" and provoked no military response from them.\n\nDuring the second week of September, several dozen persons were killed or wounded in clashes around the city of Chamchamal, which lies near the front line between Iraqi and Kurdish forces, halfway between Suleimaniyya and Kirkuk. It is not known what portion of the victims were civilians. Col. Richard Naab, commander of the Allies' Military Coordination Center in Zakho, was quoted as saying that the clashes were not caused by any Iraqi provocation. However, they erupted in a context of rising tension, as Iraqis were moving troops into the area and Kirkuk residents were demonstrating in Suleimaniyya to demand that Iraq permit them to return home. The Kirkukis were reportedly preparing to organize a march toward their city, confronting the Iraqi checkpoints along the route.\n\nIn October, the front-line towns of Chamchamal, Kifri and Kalar came under Iraqi shelling. The operation clarified Baghdad's general strategy in the north. Advancing in these locations while retreating in others (such as from Suleimaniyya in July), the army was fine-tuning a fortified military line to make it strategically strong and effective in sealing off the rebel-controlled area from the rest of the country. The line bisected Iraqi Kurdistan from the Turkish border in the northwest to the Iranian border in the southeast. All of Iraq's known oil fields remained on the Iraqi side of the line, although large sections of the key oil-export trunkline, from Iraq to Turkey's Mediterranean coast, are in rebel hands.\n\nThe shelling in October and subsequent clashes between Iraqi and Kurdish forces drove at least 200,000 civilians from their homes, according to the UNHCR, straining the agency's efforts to provide winterized shelter for up to 350,000 of those already displaced. The shelling killed at least 36 persons in the Suleimaniyya area, according to the U.N. Suleimaniyya residents later told MEW that heavy artillery shells landed mostly in heavily populated areas and did not appear aimed at specific military targets.\n\nThe Massacre of Iraqi Soldiers in Suleimaniyya\n\nOn October 7, Kurdish guerrillas engaged in what was easily their worst atrocity since the uprising, executing at least 60 Iraqi army troops who had been captured during hand-to-hand fighting in Suleimaniyya. Reuters correspondent Kurt Schork, who witnessed the killings, said the men were shot at point-blank range while they were kneeling. The Kurdistan Democratic Party, whose fighters were accused by some of responsibility, condemned the incident, announced an investigation, and invited Amnesty International to observe the trials when they took place.\n\nAs of May 25, 1992, the Kurdish leadership had conducted three investigations, but not one person had yet been charged or taken into custody in connection with the killings, according to KDP spokesman Hoshyar Zebari. Judging by the investigation findings to date, Zebari said, the incident was less clear-cut than indicated by initial press reports. He said that the killings seem to have occurred only moments after a fierce battle, and not after the victims had been in custody for any length of time. He said that the investigators' next step would be to locate all the rebels who were present at the buildings where the killings had taken place.\n\nRegrettably, the pursuit of justice in the case has fallen victim to foot-dragging and finger-pointing among the Kurdish parties. Whatever the mitigating circumstances that may surround the incident, it is evident that an atrocity took place and that the Kurdish leadership has failed to respond in a manner that sends a signal that abusive conduct by their fighters will be punished in a timely fashion. Neither the absence of a fully operational judiciary nor the considerable hardships that the Kurds have faced since the uprising can justify this feeble response.\n\nZebari, speaking to MEW on May 25, expressed optimism that the investigation would move forward now that the elections have been held. MEW urges the Kurdish leadership to show its commitment to the rule of law by completing its investigations into this important case and granting a fair and open trial to those who are charged with responsibility.\n\nRed Cross Visits to Iraqi soldiers captured by Kurdish rebels\n\nThe pesh merga have captured large numbers of Iraqi soldiers during the clashes that have occurred since the uprising. The various Kurdish groups holding Iraqi soldiers have generally permitted the prisoners to be seen regularly by delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The ICRC said it began visiting imprisoned Iraqi servicemen on July 18, when it had access to 1,500 prisoners taken during clashes that month. It visited 814 soldiers taken in September, and 4,040 captured between October and December. Visits are continuing until the present, the ICRC said, adding that the prisoners tend to be released relatively soon after their capture. As of mid-May 1992, fewer than one hundred soldiers, most of them officers, were believed by the ICRC to be in custody.\n\nBaghdad's Economic Blockade of the Rebel-Controlled Zone\n\nIn October, Baghdad imposed an embargo on goods entering the rebel-controlled zone, enforcing it at checkpoints along the military line. The government, itself squeezed by continuing U.N. economic sanctions, cut deliveries of food and fuel, including subsidized goods that the government was rationing, and ordered civil servants to relocate to cities under government control or face dismissal. At checkpoints, soldiers confiscated food and fuel from the few cars they let through to the rebel-held zone. The embargo caused prices to soar for food, fuel, and agricultural products such as seeds and fertilizer.\n\nThe termination of salaries to state employees affected an estimated 200,000 heads of households. Most, however, remained at their posts, and schools continued to function as the Kurdish leadership tried to cover salaries by using the revenues from duties they levied on trucks passing rebel-controlled checkpoints at the Iraqi-Turkish border.\n\nThe embargo, which made an unusually cold winter that much worse, continues to be felt, as a Le Monde correspondent observed on a recent visit:\n\nIn addition to the cutoff in rations, the embargo imposed by Baghdad is felt most acutely in terms of fuel, gasoline and gas, which are being delivered at about one tenth the pre-embargo levels. Gasoline is also available for purchase, thanks to smuggling, at fifty times the Iraqi price, and natural gas canisters, which cost less than one dinar in Mosul, sell for 16 dinars in Irbil.\n\nIf the embargo was intended to pressure the Kurds to reach a political settlement with Baghdad, it did not succeed. In some respects, it had something of the opposite effect, forcing the Kurds to take on such attributes of government as rationing staples and operating schools and hospitals.\n\nWith economic pressure failing to yield quick results, Baghdad stepped up the military pressure. In late March, the army shelled towns near the Great Zab river, west of Irbil, driving 40,000 villagers from their homes. Most have since returned, according to a U.N. official. The army launched another operation near the city of Chamchamal, apparently in order to tighten the embargo by cutting off a rebel-controlled supply route between Irbil and Suleimaniyya.\n\nIn early April, a buildup of Iraqi ground forces between Irbil and Mosul and the activation of anti-aircraft batteries north of the 36th parallel prompted stern warnings from the Allies. Iraqis backed down on the anti-aircraft batteries, but an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 soldiers remained along the front, backed by tanks and heavy artillery, according to Kurdish military officials.\n\nU.N.'s Uncertain Future in Iraq Adds to Kurds' Anxiety\n\nThe military buildup is not the only cause of jitteriness one year after the failed uprising. The future of the U.N. presence inside Iraq remains in doubt. With the agreement between Iraq and the U.N. expiring on June 30, the government has reportedly increased its harassment of U.N. relief workers, imposed new restrictions on the movement of U.N. vehicles delivering humanitarian aid, and held up issuing or renewing visas for foreign relief workers. An official with the U.N. humanitarian office for Iraq commented that the government dislikes the presence of so many U.N. and relief workers but feels it must tolerate them if it is to have the U.N.-imposed sanctions removed.\n\nIf the U.N. succeeds in extending its memorandum of understanding with Iraq, it remains to be seen whether and how the U.N. will maintain the protection functions that until now the UNHCR has been performing. That agency has been scaling back its presence in Iraq since April 1, 1992, while the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has taken on a supervisory role among U.N. agencies in the field. This development is troubling from a human-rights standpoint, since UNICEF, in contrast to the UNHCR, has no explicit protection mandate. The UNHCR field staff in Iraq included \"protection officers\" whose job was to help displaced persons to return to where they wished to go, and to intervene with authorities to ensure that conditions of safety and dignity were maintained.\n\nA plan to fill the void is being considered by the U.N.'s inter-agency Department of Humanitarian Affairs, directed by Undersecretary General Jan Eliasson of Sweden. Michael Stopford, the New York representative of the department's Iraq program, told MEW on May 13 that the department hoped to assign field representatives \"to assume some of the coordinating, monitoring, and reporting functions that until now have been performed by the UNHCR.\" He warned, however, that the plan was contingent on funding C and, of course, on the extension of the U.N. agreement with Iraq to operate inside its territory.\n\nCar Bombs, Apparent Poisonings Raise Fears of Infiltrators from Baghdad\n\nSince March 1992, Kurdish fears of saboteurs have been heightened by an apparent poisoning incident and two fatal car-bomb explosions. In past years, the Saddam regime has been accused of poisoning a number of dissidents both in Iraq and abroad; several cases are described in MEW's Human Rights in Iraq. The two most recent victims were Sunni Muslim members of the Iraqi opposition who had taken sanctuary in the rebel-controlled north. The two, identified by the pseudonyms Abdallah Abdelatif and Abd al-Karim al-Masdiwi, reportedly fell ill after drinking tea at the home of an unidentified Kurd in Shaqlawa on March 24, 1992. According to London-based Iraqi dissidents, the two had received a warning a month earlier from Qusai Hussein, one of Saddam's sons, to cease their activities and leave Iraq.\n\nAfter their health deteriorated, the two were moved from Iraq to Damascus. Samples of their blood, hair and urine were sent to a London hospital for tests. On the strength of the test results, visas were secured and the two men flew to London, where they were treated for thallium poisoning. Both were recovering in May and were expected to survive.\n\nThere have been other incidents of sabotage in northern Iraq that cannot be reliably linked to the regime. Responsibility was neither claimed nor determined for a car bomb that exploded outside a Kurdish political office in central Suleimaniyya on March 6, 1992, killing twelve persons; or for another bomb that exploded in a market in Irbil on March 16, reportedly killing three people and injuring some 25. The second blast came after a succession of warnings from officials and media in Baghdad to the opposition Iraqi Kurdistan Front not to ally itself with foreign powers. On May 14, 1992, a small car bomb exploded outside a Dahuk hotel frequented by foreign journalists, who were covering the election campaign in the rebel-controlled zone. Other explosive devices have been discovered and prevented from detonating.\n\nSuch incidents heighten the sense of vulnerability among people living in the rebel-held zone. Iraq's continuing embargo and military buildup, the periodic shelling and skirmishes along the front line, the uncertain future of the Allied and U.N. presence, the harassment of U.N. workers and apparent acts by saboteurs have all helped to keep hundreds of thousands of Kurds ready to take flight at a moment's notice.\n\nThe Marshes\n\nSince last June, Iraqi opposition groups abroad have accused the Iraqi army of launching major offensives in the vast marsh areas located near the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in the triangle formed by the cities of al-Nasiriyya, al-Amara and Basra. The victims are said to include rebels, displaced families, and the indigenous semi-nomadic marsh dwellers (sometimes referred to as \"Marsh Arabs\"). According to these reports, villages have been demolished and unarmed civilians have been punished on suspicion of aiding the rebels.\n\nMost recently, the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI), a Shi'a opposition group based in Teheran, charged that on April 21 the regime launched a tank, artillery, and air assault on three fronts in the marshes, attacking the northern marshes of Basra, the northern marshes of al-Amara, and the eastern al-Nasiriyya marshes. The reports prompted an expression of concern by the British government on April 24. On May 19, SAIRI issued a statement warning that the army was amassing heavy weaponry in the area for a new onslaught.\n\nThe magnitude of the operations and the extent of casualties have been difficult to confirm, since few independent observers have been permitted to penetrate the marshes from inside Iraq, and few have taken the perilous trip by boat with rebels infiltrating from Iran.\n\nNor is the population of the marshes known with any precision. In the 1950s they were home to an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 persons, but many were displaced during the Iran-Iraq war by drainage projects and military operations. Aid officials told an Independent reporter recently that the local population was down to 50,000.\n\nHarsh conditions prevail in the marshes. Water pollution has reduced the supply of fish, a staple for the indigenous population, and clean water, food and medical care are scarce. Various mosquito-borne diseases are present.\n\nBecause of their terrain and proximity to Iran, the marshes have served for decades as a sanctuary for criminals and others hiding from the central authorities. Armed bandits continue to rob vehicles on the main roads, making it inadvisable to travel after dark. During the Iran-Iraq war, deserting soldiers fled to the marshes, prompting the army to send in helicopter gunships to hunt them down.\n\nToday, the marshes evidently contain the largest concentration of active resistance fighters in southern Iraq. Rebel commanders recently claimed to have 10,000 fighters operating in the area, although journalists and aid workers who recently spent time near the marshes said the number seemed inflated, adding that the rebels have mounted little more than sporadic hit-and-run attacks in the area.\n\nOne reporter who entered the marshes with the rebels in March found them to be poorly equipped despite Iranian backing:\n\nProvided with sanctuary and support by Iran, the rebels operate out of small base camps along the border with Iraq and deep inside the marshes....Their AK-47 assault rifles are often rusty, few have boots or uniforms, and there is little medicine to ward off the festering sores, fevers and malaria bred by the swamp. Sick and wounded fighters often die before they can complete the three- or four-day journey to Iran for treatment.\n\nDespite the low level of rebel activity, the government seems determined to eliminate resistance in the region. In addition to the reported military operations mentioned above, the government appears to be employing a combination of coercion and incentives to resettle marsh dwellers in more accessible locations outside the marshes or on their periphery. Rebels also alleged that the Iraqi army was draining the swamps and building roads through them so that its tanks and heavy artillery could operate more effectively in the area.\n\nReports by opposition sources abroad about military action in the marshes have been difficult to substantiate partly because the government has systematically obstructed scrutiny of its operations in the marshes. The area is encircled by army troops and dotted with checkpoints.\n\nLast July the government delayed, and then attempted to dupe the U.N. Secretary General's special delegate, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, when he conducted the first major attempt by the U.N. to assess humanitarian needs in the marshes. (A U.N. team visiting the area one month earlier had cited a deployment of troops along roads in parts of the marshes and expressed concern about the estimated 40,000 people who were hiding there. ) Upon reaching the Hammar region of the marshes, between al-Nasiriyya and Basra, Sadruddin was told by local residents that troops had just completed a withdrawal from the area, apparently in an effort to deceive the mission into concluding that there was no military pressure on area residents. As soon as they departed, the army went back in, prompting a protest from Prince Sadruddin. \"....I learned from unimpeachable sources that as soon as our mission left the area, and in particular on the 12th and 13th of July, a heavy military presence was redeployed to take up the same positions which had obviously been vacated mainly for the duration of our visit,\" he wrote to the Iraqi foreign minister on July 15.\n\nPrince Sadruddin tried to establish a permanent U.N. presence in the area, but his plan was thwarted only days after his departure from the area when Iraqi authorities ordered out U.N. staff who had remained behind. Since then only a skeletal U.N. staff has been permitted to work in cities near the marshes.\n\nIraq has also kept the presence of NGOs in the marsh region to a minimum, issuing few travel permits to the area. A representative of the French medical relief group Medecins du Monde who was granted access in order to assess health needs in late 1991 found her trip tightly controlled by her government escorts. MDM proposals for projects in the area subsequently went unanswered by the government.\n\nIn late 1991, Iraq authorized a small German nongovernmental organization, Aktion Direkte Hilfe (Action Direct Assistance), to staff a small office in al-Nasiriyya and make daily deliveries under Iraqi Red Crescent supervision of food and water to the marsh town of Chubaish, 60 miles to the south. This made ADH the only foreign NGO with a base in the south that was distributing goods directly to marsh residents. In April 1992, however, the government expelled ADH from Iraq without providing any official explanation, and also asked the U.N.'s World Food Program (WFP) to close its office in al-Nasiriyya.\n\nSince the departure of ADH, the WFP has managed to remain in al-Nasiriyya, and deliveries of food and water to Chubaish have been performed by the Baghdad-based staff of the Catholic Relief Services. Nevertheless, the Iraqi government has kept the presence and freedom of movement of U.N. and NGO workers to an absolute minimum in marshes region.\n\nBecause of these restrictions, the presence of foreign workers provides the area's population with virtually no protection from government abuse. An official with the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs' Iraq program told MEW in May 1992 that U.N. staff travel only on routes between their offices and their distribution points, and have no mandate to perform any other work in the marshes. Asked about reports during mid-April of stepped up military operations in the area, the official replied in a manner indicative of the near-impossibility of obtaining information: he said he could only confirm that shelling had been heard in the area, but did not know what towns or sites had been affected.\n\nADH's coordinator in Iraq, Falah Wajdi, told MEW that the staff of his organization also stuck closely to their scheduled rounds and were unable to observe government or military policies toward inhabitants of the marshes. He did say, however, that in the area of the marshes between al-Nasiriyya and Chubaish, where ADH staff traveled daily, he saw no signs of intense military activity. \"Army checkpoints were manned by three or four soldiers only, with no heavy weapons,\" he commented. \"I did not see any tanks or helicopter gunships or heavy artillery.\" As for the reported army blockade on goods entering the marshes, Wajdi said he saw no evidence of an embargo in Chubaish. \"There is food for sale in the town markets, and the prices are the same as in al-Nasiriyya. The problem is that people can't afford the market prices.\"\n\nEven if the government of Iraq permits NGOs and the U.N. to maintain their modest presence along certain routes in the marsh region, there is an urgent need to increase monitoring of the highly dispersed local population. The marshes remain more closed than other parts of Iraq to the outside world, and more vulnerable to government abuses being perpetrated without any scrutiny. MEW urges the international community to highlight this region in its effort to improve human rights monitoring and protection within Iraq.\n\nCities Targeted for Repression\n\nKirkuk: Exploiting the Exodus\n\nKirkuk is an oil-rich city about 160 miles north of Baghdad with an ethnically mixed population of between 500,000 and one million. It has long been fiercely contested by the Kurds, who demand its incorporation into the Kurdish Autonomous Region, and the Baathist regime, which has since the 1970s sought to solidify its control of the city by colonizing it with Arabs from cities to the south.\n\nIn the first few months following the uprising, security forces blocked the return of Kirkukis who had fled; others were too afraid to return. A New York Times reporter who visited the city in early June 1991 observed that few Kurds had returned. Two months later, a Libération correspondent found much the same thing, noting that in the Kurdish neighborhood of Teppe only one refugee in two had returned. One U.N. official based in Suleimaniyya, where many of the displaced reside, told MEW in May 1992 that the only Kirkukis he observed shuttling between the two cities were women and children going to visit relatives.\n\nThe UNHCR estimated the number of Kirkukis displaced within Iraq at 70,000 to 100,000 in May 1992; the same month, Hoshyar Zebari of the KDP told MEW that the number was at least 150,000.\n\nAlthough soldiers at checkpoints appear to have since eased the policy of turning back Kurds who wish to return to Kirkuk, reports of a heavy military presence in the city and the repression of the remaining Kurdish population deter those who remain displaced. It comes as no surprise that Kirkukis constitute the lion's share of Kurds who have not returned home since the uprising, given the recent history of the city and its current condition.\n\nThe government of Iraq has denied that any of its actions during or since the uprising have targeted the Kurds as a people:\n\nNo operations were conducted with a view to driving out the Kurds; on the contrary, we note that their departure was influenced by the external intervention. The serious intention of the Iraqi Government to encourage those citizens to return is evident from the signing of the memorandum of understanding with the United Nations and the promulgation of...general amnesty decrees.\n\nThe government failed to explain, however, why Kirkuk is the only city for which it has refused a standing request from the U.N. to open a humanitarian office. The presence of such an office would likely encourage the return home of at least some of the displaced Kirkukis.\n\nWithout a U.N. presence in Kirkuk, serious allegations about Iraqi conduct there have been difficult to assess. Kurdish political leaders have charged that the government has exploited the exodus of Kurds to accelerate the Arabization program in the city. According to these allegations, Kurdish homes were reportedly either demolished after the uprising or given to Arabs brought in from cities to the south. Kurdish leaders claimed to be in possession of a leaked official document dated August 4, 1991 authorizing the distribution of property in Kirkuk to Arab settlers, and ordering the construction of houses for 2,726 families. This claim could not be confirmed.\n\nDr. Najmaldin O. Karim, President of the Kurdish National Congress in the U.S., told MEW that following the uprising, Iraqi troops went into predominantly Kurdish neighborhoods in the city and its northern and eastern suburbs and bulldozed or dynamited 4,000 vacant homes. Patrick Cockburn of The Independent, who visited Kirkuk in early May 1992, told MEW that he saw a Kurdish neighborhood near the Air Force base that had been systematically demolished. He was unable to inspect the damage closely because he was accompanied by two government officials.\n\nSuleimaniyya-based U.N. officials who are in daily contact with displaced Kirkukis, cautioned that some reports of the destruction of Kurdish Kirkuk may be exaggerated. The true extent and chronology of the damage cannot be confirmed so long as Iraq bars free access by U.N. officials, journalists, and rights monitors.\n\nAl-Najaf and Karbala: Punishing the Shi'a\n\nPost-uprising repression has been particularly harsh in the two holy Shi'a holy cities of al-Najaf and Karbala. Since the uprising, religious institutions and prominent clerical families have been targeted in a campaign to subdue Shi'a opposition, which Saddam is thought to view as the greatest potential popular threat to his rule. Unlike the Kurds, whose political aspirations mainly concern the region in which they are in the majority, the Shi'a opposition movements have long sought to install an Islamic government in Baghdad. The Shi'a account for an estimated 55 percent of Iraq's population.\n\nRepresentatives of Iraq's Shi'a community have charged that since the uprising the Iraqi regime has targeted Shi'a cultural and nonpolitical institutions in an attempt to destroy the fabric of Shi'a society. These attacks were part of what they called a campaign of \"revenge on a massive scale\" in southern Iraq.\n\nMany of the Shi'a shrines, sites and institutions of al-Najaf and Karbala were damaged by shelling during the uprising. Several were later demolished or closed. A London Times correspondent visiting Karbala in late April 1991 found a demolition program in full swing around the shrines of Hussein and Abbas, designed to create \"a sanitary zone of concrete\" around two of the holiest shrines of the Shi'a faith:\n\nEntire buildings flanking a central boulevard linking the two mosques had been reduced to mounds of rubble since I had visited ten days earlier....The official explanation is that the area is being upgraded and will be turned into a plaza flanked by high-rise buildings and shops.\n\nWhen El País correspondent Angeles Espinosa toured the ruins around the two shrines one month later, journalists disingenuously asked officials whether the damage had occurred during the Allied bombing or the uprising:\n\n\"No, this zone was dynamited by the government in order to renovate it,\" the official accompanying us replied without a trace of shame.\n\nThe three official reasons for this massive demolition of buildings is that they were very old, they were damaged during the recent revolt, and there is a plan under way to give the city a facelift. However, when this reporter visited Karbala last year, neither the broad pedestrian mall that connects the two shrines, nor what surrounded it, were in ruins.\n\nNor does it seem that the beautification of the heart of Shi'a Islam would be an urgent necessity at a moment when the country was going through grave economic difficulties.\n\nThe impression is that...the army has knocked down the buildings to crush the resistance.\n\nOne year later, the damage inflicted during the uprising to the shrines of Abbas and Hussein has been repaired, but, as Patrick Cockburn wrote during a recent visit, \"the hasty restoration only emphasizes the extent of the damage.\" The rubble that surrounded the shrines after the uprising has been cleared away, but the marketplace has not been rebuilt and the shrines stand in a vast \"waste ground.\"\n\nCompared to Karbala, the program of demolition in al-Najaf was, according to Yousif al-Khoei of the al-Khoei Foundation, \"relatively confined to religious centers, acres of Shi'a cemeteries in Wadi al-Salaam, and homes of people suspected to have taken part in the uprising.\" The Imam Ali, Baqee'a, Morad, Sami Kirmasha, Imam Sadiq, and Kuwait mosques are among the religious buildings in al-Najaf that the government has demolished since the uprising, al-Khoei said.\n\nThe U.N. Special Rapporteur visited al-Najaf in January 1992 and noted that in the Wadi al-Salaam cemetery,\n\nwhere Shi'a pilgrims from as far away as India and Afghanistan have been buried for over one thousand years,...a highway is being constructed over the graves in what is alleged to be an act of deliberate desecration; leaders of the community have not been consulted. In addition, the thousand-year-old Houza, the Shi'a university, was closed along with many other schools, private as well as religious, at al-Najaf, while libraries with manuscripts that constituted part of the Islamic tradition were destroyed.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur also stated that\n\nthe number of clergy at al-Najaf had been reduced from eight or nine thousand twenty years ago to two thousand 10 years later, and 800 before the uprisings of 1991. It is alleged that virtually all of them are now under arrest or disappeared, as the Baath regime is seeking to destroy Shi'a culture by wiping out its traditional leaders of the ulema [learned] class.\n\nAmong those reportedly arrested in March during the suppression of the uprising were some 105 relatives, staff, religious students and some senior clerics associated with the Grand Ayatollah al-Khoei. Except for one individual who was released, their fate remains unknown to this day (see above, first section of this chapter).\n\nAs in Kirkuk, monitoring the ongoing repression in Karbala or al-Najaf is difficult. The U.N. has no office in either city, and the few foreigners who have been able to visit are closely watched by the government and unable to converse freely with local residents.\n\nChapter Two\n\nThe March 1991 Uprisings: Introduction\n\nThe 1991 uprising was the most serious internal challenge Saddam Hussein has had to face during his twelve years in power. Every major city in the north and south of the country except Mosul fell into the hands of rebels and their sympathizers. Iraqi soldiers, confronted with a popular uprising immediately after being routed in the Gulf war, deserted or defected by the thousands. The survival of the regime was very much in doubt for about two weeks until loyalist troops, led by the elite Republican Guard, began finally to extinguish the insurrection city by city. By the time it was over, thousands of civilians and government forces had been killed and countless atrocities had been committed by both sides.\n\nThree northern and three southern cities that rose up in rebellion are the focus of this report. Testimony gathered from residents of other cities suggests that the abuses documented here are representative of what took place elsewhere, although the magnitude of the abuses and the level of casualties varied considerably. Among the cities covered in this report, al-Najaf, Karbala, and Kirkuk were particularly devastated by the uprising and government counter-offensive.\n\nThe turmoil began in Basra on March 1, one day after the Gulf war cease-fire, and spread within days to Karbala, Najaf, Hilla, al-Nasiriyya, al-Amara, Samawa, Kut, and Diwaniyya C that is, to all of the largest cities of southern Iraq. Smaller cities, such as Suq al-Shuyoukh near al-Nasiriyya, and al-Zubayr near Basra, were also swept up in the revolt.\n\nThe rebellion in the north erupted on or about March 4 in the town of Rania, northwest of Suleimaniyya. Within ten days, the Kurds controlled every city in the north except Kirkuk and Mosul. Their greatest triumph C the capture of Kirkuk C came on about April 20.\n\nThe Kurdish uprising collapsed even more quickly than it began. After ousting the pesh merga from Kirkuk on March 28 and 29, the Iraqi army rolled into Dahuk and Irbil on March 30, Zakho on April 1, and Suleimaniyya, the last important town held by the rebels, over the next two days.\n\nIn the south, the government had quelled all but scattered resistance by the end of March. On April 5, Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) announced \"the complete crushing of acts of sedition, sabotage, and rioting in all towns of Iraq.\"\n\nThe Pattern of the Uprisings\n\nThe uprisings in the north and south of Iraq are often labelled respectively as Kurdish and Shi'a uprisings. While the north is mostly Kurdish and the south is mostly Shi'a, the uprisings' participants included small numbers of other groups. Available data on Iraq's ethnic makeup is neither detailed nor highly reliable, especially with regard to cities like Kirkuk that are the subject of political contention. The predominantly Kurdish cities of the north are also home to minorities of Chaldean, Armenian, and Assyrian Christians, Arab Muslims, and Turkmans (Turkic Muslims). In the South can be found minorities of Christians and Sunni Muslims, particularly in Basra and its environs. Also scattered throughout Iraq at the time were workers from Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab countries.\n\nThe revolts of March 1991 followed a general pattern. On the day that a city rebelled, masses of unarmed or lightly armed civilians and small contingents of rebels converged in the streets. Shouting anti-regime slogans, they descended on government buildings, especially offices of the security forces. These were then attacked, usually with considerable bloodshed on both sides. Government forces fought back, but then were either killed or captured, or allowed to flee. Once in control, the rebels flung open the regime's prisons and interrogation centers, and seized small caches of weapons.\n\nThe outpouring of popular support for the uprising was largely spontaneous, although some long-term planning had taken place, particularly in the north. The revolt was fueled by a perception that Iraqi security forces were uniquely vulnerable at the time, and by long-smoldering anger at government repression and the devastation wrought by two wars in a decade.\n\nWhen asked by MEW to describe the uprising, Kurdish refugees often began by recounting past government persecution: arbitrary arrest and torture, disappearances, eviction from the countryside, the destruction of villages, and the use of chemical weapons against Kurdish civilians in 1987 and 1988. The Shi'a of the south also spoke of arbitrary arrests, torture and disappearances, and about the expulsion of thousands of Shi'a to Iran in the early years of the Iran-Iraq war.\n\nOnce under way, the March 1991 uprising gathered momentum as soldiers either switched sides or deserted. The army, which is said to have grown from 140,000 in 1977 to around 1 million at the time of the invasion of Kuwait, contained substantial anti-government elements; Shi'a Arabs accounted for 80 percent of the fighting ranks and about 20 percent of the officers. In the north, the defection of much of the government-recruited Kurdish militia, who vastly outnumbered the pesh merga, gave considerable force to the revolt. Journalists reported that their defection was the fruit of months of planning and psychological warfare by Kurdish rebel leaders.\n\nUnlike the pesh merga, the Shi'a resistance lacked an organized fighting force, although it maintained cells and had carried out armed operations on occasion. The Shi'a opposition has long enjoyed sanctuary and support from the Iranian regime, although Teheran does not appear to have furnished significant material or logistical assistance during the March 1991 uprising.\n\nOnce the loyalist troops regrouped and mounted their counteroffensive, only massive foreign assistance or intervention could have saved the ill-equipped and inexperienced rebels. With little more than Kalashnikovs, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, and a few captured tanks and artillery pieces, the Shi'a and Kurdish rebels were almost defenseless against helicopter gunships and indiscriminate mortar and artillery barrages. They had few anti-tank weapons and even fewer surface-to-air missiles.\n\nThe civilian toll was high throughout the country. Thousands of unarmed civilians were killed by indiscriminate fire from loyalist tanks, artillery cannons and helicopters; and later, when security forces rolled into a city and executed persons on the streets, in homes and in hospitals. The violence was heaviest in the south, where a smaller portion of the local population had fled than in Kurdish areas, owing partly to the danger of escaping through the south's flat, exposed terrain. Those who remained in the south were at the mercy of advancing government troops, who went through neighborhoods, summarily executing hundreds of young men and rounding up thousands of others.\n\nThere were variations to this general pattern. Basra was the scene of chaotic, pitched battles for several days, but never fell completely into rebel hands. In other cities, the rebels ousted the security forces with little difficulty. The army later recaptured some cities, such as Karbala and al-Najaf, only after bitter fighting, but swept into others, such as Suleimaniyya, with little resistance.\n\nJust as the experience of years of repression fed the fury of the uprising, it fueled the terrified exodus as soon as the rebellion began to falter. During March and early April, nearly two million Iraqis escaped from strife-torn cities to the mountains along the northern borders, into the southern marshes, and into Turkey and Iran. Their exodus was sudden and chaotic, with thousands fleeing on foot, on donkeys, or crammed onto open-backed trucks and tractors. In the south, many fled into or through the maze of marshes that straddle the Iranian border. Thousands, many of them children, are thought to have died or suffered injury along the way, primarily from adverse weather, unhygienic conditions and insufficient food and medical care. Some were killed by army helicopters, which deliberately strafed columns of fleeing civilians in a number of incidents in both the north and south. Others were injured when they stepped on mines planted by Iraqi troops near the eastern border during the war with Iran. The environmental organization Greenpeace has estimated that the death rate among Kurdish and Shi'a refugees and displaced persons averaged 1,000 daily during April, May and June 1991.\n\nThe Legal Context of the Uprising\n\nThe international law applicable to the conduct of both government and rebel forces during the Iraqi uprising depends on the way that the conflict is characterized, a question that is open to some debate. Nevertheless, the applicable legal restraints on conduct are largely the same.\n\nIn MEW's view, the uprising may plausibly be considered either a Geneva Convention Common Article 3 situation, i.e. armed conflict of a non-international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties; or a situation of \"internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature,\" to which general human rights provisions apply. The uprising does not meet the criteria of an international conflict, despite Iraqi efforts to blame foreign elements for fomenting and supporting it.\n\nMEW endorses the finding of the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Iraq that the conflict reached the threshold of applicability of Common Article 3.\n\nThe provisions of Common Article 3 are binding upon the government of Iraq, which has ratified the 1949 Geneva Conventions. It requires both parties to an internal conflict to treat humanely all noncombatants, \"including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause.\" Common Article 3 prohibits both parties to the conflict from subjecting noncombatants to:\n\n(a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;\n\n(b) taking of hostages;\n\n(c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;\n\n(d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\n\nIn addition to Common Article 3, the Second Additional Protocol of 1977 (\"Protocol II\") to the 1949 Geneva Conventions codifies a series of principles for the treatment of civilians in noninternational armed conflicts. Although Iraq has not ratified Protocol II, many of its provisions are binding as a matter of customary international law. These include:\n\nAttacks on medical facilities and personnel are prohibited. (Articles 9 to 11.)\n\n\"The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations.\" (Article 13(1).)\n\n\"The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.\" (Article 13(2).)\n\nBy inference, the civilian population is also protected from indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks, such as:\n\nattacks not directed at a specific military objective;\n\nattacks employing a method or means of combat that cannot be directed at a specific military objective;\n\nattacks that treat as a single military objective a number of clearly separate and distinct military objectives in an area populated by civilians;\n\nattacks that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or any combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete military advantage anticipated.\n\nAs this report makes clear, these humanitarian precepts were violated by government forces during the uprising in a systematic and wholesale manner. In putting down the insurrection, troops fired indiscriminately at civilians and often targeted them for attack. They summarily executed suspected rebels and others, invading hospitals and attacking both medical personnel and the wounded. Civilians were taken hostage on several occasions to shield advancing troops from attack.\n\nLess evidence was collected about abuses by the rebels (see below), but it is clear that in many cities they executed suspected members of the security forces and the Baath party in their custody, after improper trials or no trials whatsoever, in violation of Common Article 3 and customary international law.\n\nIn this regard it is important to stress that each party to a conflict has an independent obligation to comply with the rules of armed conflict. Neither side's abuses may be used to justify abuses by the other side.\n\nIn defense of its handling of the uprising, the Iraqi government has stressed that the uprising was an \"armed rebellion\" that could \"under no circumstances be regarded as an intifada, the Arabic term for uprising most often associated with the Palestinian revolt in the Israeli-occupied territories. Replying to the U.N. Human Rights Committee, the government characterized the Iraqi uprising as a state of insurrection and extreme lawlessness, to which it had responded legitimately and proportionately. The \"rioters,\" the government charged,\n\ncompleted the destruction of those targets which had not been destroyed by coalition air raids. The rioters committed mass murder and rape, looting and burning schools, hospitals, shops, Government buildings, banks and courts. They stole public and private property, and fomented ethnic and sectarian conflict. All these acts are punishable by law. In spite of the extremely difficult conditions and the interruption of communications as a result of deliberate air raids, the State authorities, represented by the armed forces, did their duty and restored State control, putting an end to the riots and at last restoring peace on 5 April 1991.\n\nWhen the State restored its authority in the governorates where riots had occurred, the rioters fled the country and induced groups of the population to go with them to neighbouring countries, particularly Turkey and Iran, by spreading untrue allegations about the action which the Government of Iraq might take against them. The idea was to use them as a human shield and for propaganda purposes holding them in the areas occupied by foreign troops and preventing them from returning home....\n\n[M]ilitary operations by the Iraqi armed forces to restore State control in the governorates where riots occurred led to the deaths of rioters and members of the Iraqi armed forces alike in the exchanges of fire between the two sides. Such deaths could not be avoided in the circumstances.\n\nThe state's response to the mayhem and disorder caused by the rebels and their supporters was brutal in the extreme. It exceeded all bounds of proportionality and violated elemental rights, both of civilians and suspected rebels, that must be respected at all times as part of the customary law of human rights. These include protection against the arbitrary deprivation of life, protection from torture and mutilation, and protection against summary punishment.\n\nHuman Rights Abuses by the Rebels\n\nRebels and their sympathizers in both the north and south of Iraq openly took credit for executing personnel of the security forces and intelligence agencies during the uprising. While many were killed in the heat of battle, hundreds, and perhaps thousands, were executed while in custody or after summary trials. MEW is not in a position to determine the scale of these abuses, although they were clearly widespread. The environmental organization Greenpeace estimated that 5,000 members of the security forces were killed as a result of the clashes and executions.\n\nAccording to the Iraqi government,\n\ngangs of subversives and perfidious traitors, instigated by hostile political bodies which took their orders from leaders outside the country, turned religious centres into bases for resistance against the government authorities. These bases were also used for purposes of torture, trials and executions by those same gangs. The Government has all the evidence needed to prove this.\n\nBaghdad claims that the rebels carried out more than 2,500 summary executions, but the government has not made available the evidence in a manner that would allow independent observers to judge the accuracy of its allegations. It claims to have discovered mass graves of victims of the rebels, including in Suleimaniyya (bodies of 370 \"citizens\"), Kut Sawadi (150 bodies of \"persons who had been killed by the groups participating in the disturbances\") and Kushk al-Basri (fifty bodies). In most cases, outside observers have not visited these alleged gravesites; in one case where access was granted, a journalist reported that it had been impossible to verify the Iraqi military's account of how the victims had died (see Chapter Three, section on Basra).\n\nVerifying accounts of abuses by the rebels and their sympathizers was difficult, in light of the denial to MEW of access to Iraq. Testimony collected from Kurdish and Shi'a refugees tended to be somewhat unreliable: many seemed to embellish their accounts of the vengeance taken on security force officials, while others appeared to minimize them, claiming that suspected agents of the security forces were well-treated, urged to repent, or punished only after a fair trial.\n\nThis report includes only those accounts of abuses by rebels and their sympathizers that appeared credible and were consistent with other testimony collected. It is also worth noting that abuses by rebel forces did not end with the suppression of the uprising. The gravest atrocity perpetrated by the pesh merga since the end of the uprising, a massacre of soldiers in their custody, is described in Chapter One.\n\nLooting by Both Sides\n\nIraqi authorities have long encouraged soldiers to keep goods they seize during their operations. Officers tell their subordinates, \"The heads of the people are for me, their property, for you,\" (\"Ru'ous al-nas ilayya, wa'amwaalihum ilayka\") according to a 22-year-old Kurd from Sayyid Saddiq. Whether apocryphal or not, this motto seemed to have inspired soldiers in much of post-uprising Iraq. Their plundering of stores and homes was likened by several refugees to the looting of Kuwaiti private property by Iraqi soldiers during the early days of the occupation of that country.\n\nBoth Kurds and Shi'a knew what to expect. The confiscation of the property of uprooted Kurdish villagers was an integral part of the Anfal campaign (see Introduction). This has been confirmed by the testimony of Kurds who survived the Anfal, as well as by official documents relating to the Anfal that fell into the hands of Kurdish rebels. In the south, the summary expulsion in the early 1980s of Iraqi Shi'a accused of being \"of Persian ancestry\" was also accompanied by the confiscation of their personal property and homes.\n\nIt is not possible, however, to ascertain the extent of the looting during the uprising, or who were the principal perpetrators or victims. While many refugees who fled late in the exodus or who later returned to their homes reported seeing evidence of widespread looting, few had actually witnessed the looting in progress. One who did was Idris Haadi, a Kurdish engineer from Irbi"
