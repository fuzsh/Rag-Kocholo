The legacy of articles, poems and correspondence left by Joan Maragall have inspired Josep Maria Jaumà to create an intimate, up-close production based on the works of the modernist poet and intellectual - one that manages to convey an overall perspective on his ideology.

The production stars Jep Barceló in the role of a poet and seeker of the living word who enters into dialogue with a series of voices, thereby breathing life into the poet’s letters to his father, his wife Clara, Josep Pijoan and the newspaper “El Correo Catalán” for which he wrote. The backdrop to the production is contemporary, however, as the poet’s reflections revolve around subjects such as the relationship between Catalonia and Spain, progressive thinking and the role of art and culture in society.

The project began in 2011 in celebration of “Maragall Year” and the response has been such that, not only has the production been continued, but it has been extended to include a guided tour of the house following the performance. The action takes place in the dining room of the poet’s house in Sant Gervasi, which also serves as the Joan Maragall Archive Museum and contains all the available documentation pertaining to the poet, including his uniquely personal notebooks. While Maragall is remembered above all for these notebooks and for his poetry, his work as a translator should not be overlooked as he was the first to introduce German literature into Catalonia through his translations of the works of Goethe, Nietzsche and Novalis.

The performance is open to group bookings.
