Tributes to this national heroine can be found all over France. There are literally countless statues, streets and restaurants named after her and many sites dedicated to her life. However, despite widespread social and mechanical reproduction and cultural naming in relation to the Maid of OrlÃ©ans, there is no official network or integrated signage in France to promote cultural heritage tourism to the numerous Joan of Arc sites and festivals, even though her life and death, by any measure, were seminal events in the countryâs history. Unfortunately, the pilgrim who wants to follow or intersect with Joan of Arcâs trail through France, for cultural, historical or religious reasons, must do so without much help. Using Actor Network Theory and Site Sacralization Theory as framing devices, this paper explores human actors and tangible and intangible non-human factors that may have contributed to the lack of a unified tourism product despite the existence of an adequate Joan of Arc tourismscape. Insights gleaned from this research include Joanâs conflicted status as both/either saint and/or patriot, the existence of no cooperation or linkage between Joan of Arc sites, and cautious French tourism development policies. Several possible scenarios are suggested as suitable means to help implement or foster the creation of an on-the-ground or virtual Joan of Arc trail or tour.\n\nVastab Joan Baixas / Joan Baixas ; intervjueerinud, tÃµlkinud ja litereerinud Vahur Keller\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nBaixas, Joan, 1946-\n\n2010-01-01\n\nMaalikunstnik, nÃ¤itekirjanik, lavastaja, ÃµppejÃµud Barcelona Teatriinstituudis ja Barcelona Rahvusvahelise nukuteatrifestivali kunstiline juht J.

The risk factors and mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this accident have been widely reported. Management is twofold: resuscitation procedures and specific medical or even surgical treatment. We report a case of pulmonary artery rupture occurring during Swan-Ganz catheterization that was treated by coil embolization. This technique, which is quick and simple to use, would appear to be very promising. This is the first case of successful emergency treatment of pulmonary artery rupture using an endovascular technique\n\nPercutaneous untying of a knot in a retained Swan-Ganz catheter\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBhatti, Waqar A.; Sinha, Sankar; Rowlands, Peter\n\n2000-01-01\n\nA patient was referred to us with a tightly knotted Swan-Ganz catheter.

Il suo lavoro Ã¨ caratterizzato da una forte inclinazione per chiari Â argomenti ben ragionati che non lasciavano spazio per Â sciatte abitudini Â di pensiero . La portata ampia e la quantitÃ di scritti di Robinson rendono difficile presentare una valutazione critica dei suoi contributi nel contesto anche di un documento lungo . Quella attuale si concentra sui suoi scritti in cinque aree principali : (i l'economia della concorrenza imperfetta ; ( ii la teoria del rapporto di lavoro ; ( iii la teoria di accumulazione nel lungo periodo ; ( iv il concetto di capitale e la funzione di produzione ; e ( v il problema del tempo in economia che si riflette nei suoi scritti sulla storia tema contro equilibrio .Joan Robinsonâs interest in the question of the distribution of income and her disdain for what she considered to be theories that tried to justify existing distributions of income never flagged. Her work is marked by a strong inclination for clear, well reasoned arguments that left no room for sloppy habits of thought. The wide scope and quantity of Robinsonâs writings make it difficult to present a critical evaluation of her contributions within the context of even a lengthy paper. The present one concentrates on her writings in five main areas: (i the economics of imperfect competition; (ii the theory of employment; (iii the theory of accumulation in the long run; (iv the concept of capital and the production function; and (v the problem of time in economics as reflected in her writings on the theme history versus equilibrium.Â JEL:Â B31, E24\n\nCarta a Joan Olmos (1984)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nJaÃ©n i Urban, Gaspar\n\n1984-01-01\n\nEn este Ã­tem se presentan dos documentos originales del autor: 1 - Las notas manuscritas para una conferencia impartida en la Facultad de FilosofÃ­a de Valencia sobre poesÃ­a y poÃ©ticas el 27 de enero de 1984. 2 â El mecanoscrito de una carta dirigida a Joan Olmos (en aquellos momentos director general de carreteras de la Generalitat Valenciana) lamentando la tala de unos Ã¡rboles centenarios.

Many can be managed by conventional pulmonary care which includes positioning, suctioning, chest physiotherapy, gentle conventional ventilation and high-frequency ventilation. Some may need invasive procedures such as lung puncture, pleurotomies and excisional surgery. This is the group in which single-lung ventilation may be beneficial and circumvent the need for an invasive procedure. We describe the technique of single-lung ventilation using a Swan-Ganz catheter to block the main stem bronchus on the diseased side in air-leak syndromes. A retrospective chart review was done on 17 newborns undergoing single-lung ventilation using this technique at the Children's Hospital of New York, Columbia University, from 1986 to 2000. The technique was successful in the management of severe, neonatal unilateral lung disease not responsive to conventional modes of therapy in all but two neonates as seen by a significant improvement in pH and a decrease in PaCO 2 levels. In one neonate malpositioning of the Swan-Ganz catheter balloon could have contributed to the development of pneumothorax. The described technique of single-lung ventilation provides a safe, minimally invasive and economically feasible method of management of unilateral giant PIE in newborns not responsive to conventional modes of therapy with minimal complications.

(orig.)\n\nA retrospective diagnosis of epilepsy in three historical figures: St Paul, Joan of Arc and Socrates.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMuhammed, Louwai\n\n2013-11-01\n\nIt has been suggested that undiagnosed epilepsy profoundly influenced the lives of several key figures in history. Historical sources recounting strange voices and visions may in fact have been describing manifestations of epileptic seizures rather than more supernatural phenomena. Well-documented accounts of such experiences exist for three individuals in particular: Socrates, St Paul and Joan of Arc. The great philosopher Socrates described a 'daimonion' that would visit him throughout his life. This daimonion may have represented recurrent simple partial seizures, while the peculiar periods of motionlessness for which Socrates was well known may have been the result of co-existing complex partial seizures. St Paul's religious conversion on the Road to Damascus may have followed a temporal lobe seizure which would account for the lights, voices, blindness and even the religious ecstasy he described. Finally, Joan of Arc gave a detailed narrative on the voices she heard from childhood during her Trial of Condemnation. Her auditory hallucinations appear to follow sudden acoustic stimuli in a way reminiscent of idiopathic partial epilepsy with auditory features. By analysing passages from historical texts, it is possible to argue that Socrates, St Paul and Joan of Arc each had epilepsy.\n\nJoan of Arc: Sanctity, witchcraft or epilepsy?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNicastro, Nicolas; Picard, Fabienne\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe objective of this article is to describe whether Joan of Arc had epilepsy and how that may have influenced her sense of mission and ability to encourage thousands of people to help her to chase the English out of France. Documentation of her Trial of Condemnation in 1431 provides a description of her episodes of experienced voices and visions. From the age of thirteen, Joan of Arc experienced frequent episodes of auditory hallucinations associated with elementary or complex visual hallucinations (e.g., a great light or human faces). These had sudden onset, lasting seconds or minutes at most, and occurred when awake or during sleep, arousing her. Some could be triggered by an auditory stimulus. She had no disorganized thought between the episodes. The semiology of the episodes is very suggestive of epileptic seizures, which have been considered as ecstatic by some authors or as partial epilepsy with auditory features by others, which seems more concordant with the ictal symptoms. The auditory and visual hallucinations could have had a religious content because during her childhood and adolescence, she was brought up in a religious environment, insomuch as this content first undefined only appeared after a few seizures. We can suppose that such hallucinations, without the knowledge of their medical origin, gave her a sense of divine mission, hence, a real strength to try to accomplish the orders she heard during the episodes. Her role during the Hundred Years' War and her narration of her strange episodes led her to be burned for heresy at the age of nineteen, yet rehabilitated 25 years later and to be canonized for her achievements in 1920.

In this case report, we are presenting a 30 years old female patient with past history of stroke who underwent redo mitral valve replacement developed polyuria. The diagnosis of hypovolemia was made with the help of swan ganz catheter. The patient responded to desmopressin and completely recovered seven days after surgery. It is possible that transient cerebral ischemia given her history of Stroke resulted in the dysfunction of osmotic receptors in the hypothalamus or hypothalamus - pituitary axis during Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB). Therefore, we concluded that central DI is a probable cause of polyuria after CPB.

The translation is based on the only known manuscript (BNFms Nat. lat. 8756, edited by Evencio Beltran. The likelihood of the perfect union between bodyand soul and the complete accord between two friends is the basic analogy of the text and guidesthe composition of a historical and philosophical introduction that precedes the translation. Weanalyze its main sources, namely, Cicero and Pseudo-Augustine. Moreover, we reveal the dual organizationof the text, which devotes odd chapters to natural philosophy and to the union betweenbody and soul, while even chapters to ethics and to the absolute accord between virtuous friends.Keywords: JoanSerra, Cicero, Pseudo-Augustine, moral philosophy of friendship, Valencian humanism\n\nOrigin of the mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) and their host granitoids from the Tagong pluton in Songpan-Ganze terrane: An igneous response to the closure of the Paleo-Tethys ocean\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, Qiong; Sun, Min; Zhao, Guochun; Yang, Fengli; Long, Xiaoping; Li, Jianhua; Wang, Jun; Yu, Yang\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe Songpan-Ganze terrane is mainly composed of a Triassic sedimentary sequence and late Triassic-Jurassic igneous rocks. A large number of plutons were emplaced as a result of tectono-magmatic activity related to the late stages of Paleo-Tethys ocean closure and ensuing collision. Granitoids and their hosted mafic enclaves can provide important constraints on the crust-mantle interaction and continental crustal growth. Mesozoic magmatism of Songpan-Ganze remains enigmatic with regard to their magma generation and geodynamic evolution. The Tagong pluton (209 Ma), in the eastern part of the Songpan-Ganze terrane, consists mainly of monzogranite and granodiorite with abundant coeval mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) (ca. 208-209 Ma). The pluton comprises I-type granitoid that possesses intermediate to acidic compositions (SiO2 = 61.6-65.8 wt.%), high potassium (K2O = 3.2-4.1 wt.%), and high Mg# (51-54). They are also characterized by arc-type enrichment of LREEs and LILEs, depletion of HFSEs (e.g. Nb, Ta, Ti) and moderate Eu depletions (Eu/Eu* = 0.46-0.63). Their evolved zircon Hf and whole-rock Nd isotopic compositions indicate that their precursor magmas were likely generated by melting of old lower continental crust. Comparatively, the MMEs have lower SiO2 (53.4-58.2 wt.%), higher Mg# (54-67) and show covariation of major and trace elements, coupled with field and petrographic observations, such as the disequilibrium textures of plagioclase and amphibole, indicating that the MMEs and host granitoids were originated from different magma sources but underwent mafic-felsic magma mixing process. Geochemical and isotopic data further suggest that the precursor magma of the MMEs was formed in the continental arc setting, mainly derived from an ancient metasomatized lithospheric mantle wedge. The Triassic granitoids from the Songpan-Ganze terrane show remarkable temporal-spatial-petrogenetic affinities to the counterparts of subduction zones in the Yidun and Kunlun arc\n\nAnÃ¡lisis del duelo en la literatura de Joan Didion\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nEscobar Rovira, Marina\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEl treball present es basa en lâanÃ lisi del dol dins la literatura de Joan Didion, novelÂ·lista i periodista dâEstats Units.

In late 2003, while her only child lay critically ill, her husband, John, died suddenly. Theirs was a marriage of great intimacy and love. Grief enveloped her. Eventually she began to write an account of the first 12 months of her bereavement and the vigil for her child: The year of magical thinking. Raw, insightful and challenging, it is a rich, generous and graceful document. Didion draws on the literature of grief, personal and professional. Here, those readings are examined and reflections are made on the singular, unique grief of the author in the context of current theories on bereavement.\n\nJoan Maragall: un aristocrÃ tic platÃ²nic preocupat per la democrÃ cia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJordi Mir Garcia\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available El creixement de les idees i les reivindicacions democrÃ tiques preocupen Joan Maragall.

The drawing, until now known only through the black and white photograph, could be thoroughly analysed for the first time. In the context of information thus obtained, the historical context of creating the sketch transpired as an equally important matter, including the hypothetical role that may have been played in its creation by Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc.\n\nCan Joan of Arc Serve as an Enduring Model of Empowerment for Women With a Cancer Diagnosis?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRoseman, Janet Lynn\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMany research studies have shown that arts-based medicine is a viable and effective medical strategy to help people with cancer improve the quality of their lives. The use of arts-based strategies that employ a figure from history as a source of support to help improve the quality of life has not been documented. The current limited study allowed the author the ability to use the materials in her book, If Joan of Arc Had Cancer: Finding Courage, Faith, and Healing From History's Most Inspirational Woman Warrior, to provide support to women who were cancer survivors and to see if the use of Joan of Arc as a healing guide would be relevant. The primary intention was to find out how the book would be received by women with cancer and also to have the opportunity to determine what was helpful and what was not useful for them. The study was a pilot study. The study took place at the Gilda's Club, a national support community for people with cancer and their families, in Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA, one of the satellite programs sponsored by the Wellness Community. Participants were 10 female survivors of cancer who were members of the Gilda's Club. Participants took part in a 6-wk workshop. The workshop included arts-based medicine and meditations, based on a book written by the current author. Participants completed surveys both pre- and postintervention. The program had 10 participants, but only 3 women finished the 6-wk program and completed the postintervention survey. After the workshop, the 3 participants indicated in a survey that they were feeling less anxiety and fear and noted that they felt that they had an improved quality of life and felt more empowered with respect to their psychological frames of mind. In addition, when asked on the survey about the effectiveness of their communications with their physicians (ie, their ability to express and discuss their psychosocial and physical needs combined), they also indicated that they felt that their communications\n\nExperimental study of a closed-chest pulmonary embolism-reperfusion injury canine model by means of Swan-Ganz catheter\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBao Na; Zhai Renyou Jiang Tao; Wang Yajie; Zheng Juan; Wang Chen\n\n2007-01-01\n\nObjective: To establish a closed-chest pulmonary embolism-reperfusion animal model by Swan-Ganz catheter and to explore the mechanisms of pulmonary embolism (PE)-reperfusion injury (RI). Methods: Experiments were made on 14 mongrel dogs, ranging in weight from 15 to 18 kg, anesthetized with 3% pentobarbital sodium. The dogs were intubated with I. D. 7 endotracheal tubes. Under sterile conditions, a 7 F Swan-Ganz catheter via the external jugular vein was positioned in the unilateral pulmonary diaphragmatic lobe (DL) artery. Occlusion/reperfusion of the DL artery was controlled with 1.2 ml diluted contrast agent filled into/drawn from the balloon. After the 24 h PE, the balloon was deflated to result in 4 h reperfusion of the DL. Measurements of blood gases and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±)were made at normal condition, at 24 h PE and at 4 h reperfusion. Thin-section CT scans were performed at normal condition, 24 h PE, 30 rain, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h reperfusion, respectively. At the end of each experiment, tissue specimens of bilateral diaphragmatic lobes were obtained for both wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio and for pathological study. Results: Reperfusion pulmonary edema (RPE) was an acute, mixed, noncardiogenic edema that was observed in all 14 dogs who had been successfully established as PE/RI animal models. RPE demonstrated heterogeneous ground-glass opacifications that predominated in the areas distal to the recanalized vessels. It manifested pathologically as an edematous lung infihrated by inflammatory cells. The mean of PaO 2 and TNF-Î± of 4 h reperfusion was (81 Â± 4) mm Hg( 1 mm Hg =0.133 kPa) and (16.0 Â± 2.5)pg/ml, which were significantly different (P<0.05) from normal value [(96 Â± 6)mm Hg and (13.9 Â± 2.0) pg/ml]. The W/D of the injured lung (6.3 Â± 1.2) was significantly greater (P<0.01) than that of the contralateral lung (4.5 Â± 1.2), suggesting that the increase in the lung water was due to reperfusion injury.

The subversion coated a distinctly anticlerical, with many churches and convents burned and were killed three priests. Joan Maragall wrote three articles disagreeing from the harsh crackdown of the government, backed by the general opinion. In first article Maragall censured the Catalan bourgeoisie by his little love for the poor. In the second asked that no longer apply the death penalty, but not published it. In the third and most famous explained his experience of a Mass celebrated in a church burned by the revolutionaries, which was what the Church should be, free of state protection and of the rich, and celebrated in the language of people.

Despite the fact that the original purpose of the building was to be used a warehouse of the port, the needs of the local government forced it to extend its functions turning it into a palace receiving prominent figures and being the emplacement of many ceremonies and banquets. The importance of the House of the Dockyards can be appreciated in its dimensions, as we can see in the engravings and landscapes illustrations of El Grao, and in the work produced by Joan del Poyo after returning from Barcelona, where he served the king Martin I, probably in the Royal Palace of the city.\n\nLa construcciÃ³n de la Casa de las Atarazanas en la lÃ­nea litoral de la urbe por parte del gobierno municipal se debiÃ³ tanto a la polÃ­tica urbanÃ­stica emprendida por el patriciado urbano centrada en mostrar una imagen de belleza y decoro en todos sus frentes, como a la influencia que pudo haber ejercido MartÃ­n I en el reino de Valencia, y su deseo no satisfecho de edificar en Barcelona un palacio cercano a la costa.

A defining attribute of this work is the use of objective, biomechanical measures as the basis from which a fuller understanding of all factors affecting worker performance can be obtained, and how such performance should be measured and evaluated. The central objectives and conclusions of Dr. Stevenson's research programs spanning the years from 1985 through 2012 are summarized and discussed in terms of an overall research trajectory. The guiding principle of Dr. Stevenson's work is to reduce the potential harm to which workers are exposed through the development of bona fide occupational standards, a better understanding of risk factors leading to low back pain, and the establishment of an enhanced objective design process for functional load-bearing clothing and equipment.\n\nâI, the Implacable Iâ: lâopera di Joan Didion negli anni settanta\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCinzia Scarpino\n\n2012-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This essay attempts to read Joan Didionâs work in the 1970s (Play It As It Lays, A Book of Common Prayer and The White Album as resulting from an increasingly sharp aesthetic awareness of the modes, limits and possibilities of literature as personal and political testimony. Claiming a sceptical attitude towards any given ideology, Didion places her two novels (Play It As It Lays, A Book of Common Prayer and non-fiction book (The White Album within the history of that decade as filtered through an overtly autobiographical and idiosyncratic story. Out of a personal experience and understanding of that decade â of its collective imagination, its shared or unshared events and symbols â as one dominated by a sense of loss Didion creates women characters who survive both the âabjectâ of their female bodies and the irreversible impoverishment of the last (and lost frontiers in which their stories are set. Late-modern versions of a long-abiding and well-established American literary tradition, the character-narrators of Play It As It Lays, A Book of Common Prayer and the witness-persona of The White Album respond to Didionâs aesthetic insight into the testimonial mode, its limits and potentialities, and a narratological strategy which, not unlike the postmodern narratives of the same decade, moves toward the dissolution, scattering, and reassembling of narrative functions (author, narrator, character, and reader.\n\nApplication of the index WQI-CCME with data aggregation per monitoring campaign and per section of the river: case study-Joanes River, Brazil.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nde Almeida, Geane Silva; de Oliveira, Iara BrandÃ£o\n\n2018-03-07\n\nThis work applied the Water Quality Index developed by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (WQI-CCME), to communicate the water quality per section of the Joanes River basin, State of Bahia, Brazil. WQI-CCME is a statistical procedure that originally requires the execution of at least four monitoring campaigns per monitoring location and the measurement of at least four parameters. This paper presents a new aggregation method to calculate the WQI-CCME because, to apply the original method in Joanes River, a huge loss of information would occur, by the fact that, the number of analyzed parameters varied between the monitoring campaigns developed by the Government Monitoring Program. This work modified the original aggregation method replacing it by a data aggregation for a single monitoring campaign, in a minimum of four monitoring locations per section of the river and a minimum of four parameters per monitoring location. Comparison between the calculation of WQI-CCME for river sections, with the index, WQI-CETESB, developed by the Brazilian Environmental Sanitation and Technology Company-CETESB, proved the applicability of the new aggregation method. The WQI-CETESB has it bases on the WQI from the National Sanitation Foundation and uses nine fixed parameters. As WQI-CCME uses the totality of the analyzed parameters without restrictions, it is more flexible, and the results seem more adequate to indicate the real river water quality. However, the WQI-CCME has a more stringent water quality scale in comparison with the WQI-CETESB, resulting in inferior water quality information. In conclusion, the WQI-CCME with a new aggregation method is adequate for communicating the water quality at a given time, per section of a river, respecting the minimum number of four analyses and four monitoring points. As a result, without a need to wait for other campaigns, it reduces the cost of a monitoring program and the period to communicate the water quality.

In the analysis of the five first scenes of the film, the focus will be on the notion of scenic- and human- beauty that is at once arresting and foreboding, and the various contrasting and parallel spaces that characterise the structure of book and film. The article will draw from a number of additional secondary sources, including various cultural readings which offer alternative methodological approaches to the works analysed, and recorded 1970s interviews with the author and the filmmaker.\n\nâA good deal about California does not, on its own preferred terms, add upâ: Joan Didion between Dawning Apocalypse and Retrogressive Utopia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEva-Sabine Zehelein\n\n2011-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Joan Didionâs depiction of the American West and California is colored by an idiosyncratic sensitivity to her surroundings, intertwined with a sentimental-retrogressive image of the nature, history, character, and meaning of the West as a cultural topos. Her New Journalism-like observations of California are always closely linked to her own self and psyche, are seismographs of her own confusions, of moments of disorientation, insecurity, and loss. Didion is therefore one of those exceptional writers, who, in her fictionalized reportages, comments on American reality, ideas, and her own predicament. Identity and landscape fuse into an auto-psychoanalysis, which at the same time reveals a great deal about the American condition, its constantly strained relationship between rhetoric or auto-mythology and lived reality. This article draws primarily on Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968 and Where I Was From (2003, but also on After Henry (1992 and The White Album (1979, to illustrate these points.\n\nDatascapes o los paisajes visuales de la globalizaciÃ³n: Googlegrams de Joan Fontcuberta y Technophobia de Gordon Cheung\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHidalgo, Emilse\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available [es] Este artÃ­culo explora los collages de Gordon Cheung y Joan Fontcuberta para debatir lo que Arjun Appadurai ha identificado como los paisajes mediÃ¡ticos, Ã©tnicos, ideolÃ³gicos y financieros de la globalizaciÃ³n. El argumento principal se centra en cÃ³mo sus obras exploran los medios tecnolÃ³gicos en el campo de la cultura sin abandonar la funciÃ³n polÃ­tica del arte, entendida aquÃ­ como crÃ­tica reflexiva. La obra de Cheung es interpretada desde los espacios neoliberales contemporÃ¡neos urbanos, segÃºn los teorizan David Harvey y Marc AugÃ©. Obras como Technophobia, de Cheung, evocan, por un lado, los âno-lugaresâ de la sobremodernidad, y la omnipresencia del capitalismo financiero neoliberal, por otro. Los collages foto-mediÃ¡ticos de Fontcuberta son analizados desde las controversias que los binomios verdad/ objetividad/ referencialidad vs falacia/ manipulaciÃ³n/ construcciÃ³n aÃºn despiertan en el fotoperiodismo y el documentalismo en la era de la reproducciÃ³n digital. La funciÃ³n polÃ­tica de estos collages es rescatada como una forma no sÃ³lo de evitar la banalizaciÃ³n de la cultura de masas, de la reproduciÃ³n ad infinitum de imÃ¡genes, y de la muerte de la originalidad, la autorÃ­a, y la primacÃ­a de la copia, el recorte, la imitaciÃ³n y el ensamble de materiales reciclados, sino tambiÃ©n como una forma de estimular una reflexividad crÃ­tica polÃ­tica y social. [en] This paper looks into the collages of Gordon Cheung and Joan Fontcuberta to discuss what Arjun Appadurai has identified as the ethno-/finance-/media-/and ideological-scapes of modernity and globalization. On the main, the argument focuses on how their work explores the technological media in the field of culture without abandoning the political function of art, understood here as a critical reflexivity. Cheungâs work is interpreted from the perspective of its representation of contemporary neoliberal spaces, as theorised by David Harvey and Marc AugÃ©.

Herein, we examine if a single intratracheal instillation of CeO2 nanoparticles is associated with systemic toxicity in male Sprague-Dawley rats.Methods and results: Compared with control animals, CeO2 nanoparticle exposure was associated with increased liver ceria levels, elevations in serum alanine transaminase levels, reduced albumin levels, a diminished sodium-potassium ratio, and decreased serum triglyceride levels (P < 0.05. Consistent with these data, rats exposed to CeO2 nanoparticles also exhibited reductions in liver weight (P < 0.05 and dose-dependent hydropic degeneration, hepatocyte enlargement, sinusoidal dilatation, and accumulation of granular material. No histopathological alterations were observed in the kidney, spleen, and heart.

The evaluation used criteria formulated for the National Uranium Resource Evaluation program. Evidence for the evaluation was based on surface studies, hydrogeochemical and stream-sediment reconnaissance, and aerial radiometric surveys. The quadrangle encompasses parts of three physiographic provinces: the Colorado Plateau, the transition zone, and the Basin and Range. The one environment determined, during the present study, to be favorable for uranium deposits is the Whitewater Creek member of the Cooney tuff, which is favorable for magmatic-hydrothermal uranium deposits on the west side of the Bursum caldera. No other areas were favorable for uranium deposits in sandstone, limestone, volcanogenic, igneous, or metamorphic environments.

In this paper, we present some unpublished rules issued by the Visitador Joan Ubach op, dated in 1778, which aspired to govern everyday life â personal and convent- of the Dominicans -friar and nun- five provinces of Spanish America (Santiago de Mexico, Santos Angeles de Puebla, San HipÃ³lito MÃ¡rtir de Oaxaca, San Vicente de Chiapa y Guatemala, and Santa Cruz de las Indias.

Mujeriego\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFull Text Available A preliminary assessment of incidental potable water reuse (IPR in the Llobregat River basin has been conducted by estimating the dilution factor of treated effluent discharges upstream of six river flow measurement sections. IPR in the Llobregat River basin is an everyday occurrence, because of the systematic discharge of treated effluents upstream of river sections used as drinking water sources. Average river flows at the Sant Joan DespÃ­ measurement section increased from 400,000 m3/d (2007 to 864,000 m3/d (2008 and to 931,000 m3/d (2013, while treated effluent discharges upstream of that section ranged from 109,000 m3/d to 114,000 m3/d in those years. The highest degree of IPR occurs downstream of the Abrera and Sant Joan DespÃ­ flow measurement sections, from where about half of the drinking water supplied to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area is abstracted. Based on average annual flows, the likelihood that drinking water produced from that river stretch contained treated effluent varied from 25% (2007 to 13% (2008 and to 12% (2013. Water agencies and drinking water production utilities have strived for decades to ensure that drinking water production satisfies applicable quality requirements and provides the required public health protection.\n\nUnderstanding the Role of TSC1/2 in Cerebellar Purkinje Neurons\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2017-09-01\n\nGrants Officer whenever there are significant changes in the project or its direction.
