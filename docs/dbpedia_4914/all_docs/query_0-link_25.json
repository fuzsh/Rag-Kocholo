        "text": "Life\n\nMaragall's upper-class family was dedicated to the flourishing textile industry in Barcelona, and after finishing school, Joan Maragall took on his father's job. Having never liked his family's trade, he decided to go to university instead, where he studied law to his father's great disappointment.\n\nHowever, he dropped out of school and married Clara Noble with whom he had 13 children. In 1904 he won all three prizes awarded by the Jocs Florals in Barcelona, and was proclaimed Mestre en Gai Saber. His private home in Sant Gervasi was bought by the Biblioteca de Catalunya and can be visited.\n\nHis grandson, Pasqual Maragall, would become mayor of Barcelona and then President of Catalonia.\n\nWork\n\nMaragall's poetry was based on themes drawn from human life and nature. Highly influenced by German-language authors such as Nietzsche, Novalis and Goethe, all of which he translated into Catalan, his poetry went through decadentist and vitalist periods. He is best known for his 'theory of the living word', or teoria de la paraula viva, which advocated Nietzschean vitalism and spontaneous or even imperfect writing over colder and over-thought poetry.\n\nIn addition to his poetry writing, Maragall published journalism in avant-garde magazines of the time--including [L'Avenç]], Catalònia and Luz--where he became the leading proponent of Catalan modernisme.\n\nMaragall supported Iberian Federalism.\n\nPoetic works\n\nPoesies (1895)\n\nVisions i Cants (1900)\n\nLes Disperses (1904)\n\nEnllà (1906)\n\nSeqüències (1911)\n\nincludes the poem La fageda d'en Jordà\n\nDigitized works\n\nDigitization is available through the portal El món de Joan Maragall: Col·lecció visual de la vida i l'obra de l'autor or directly at Memòria Digital de Catalunya"
