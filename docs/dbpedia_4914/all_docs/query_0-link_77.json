She wonders why Rama, the husband to whom she is so devoted, has deserted her and not come to her rescue, and how she has survived without her beloved lord. Sita’s lamenting is turned inward.

No one but an idiot would offer a poet his comments in terms of spondees and trochees; why must the painter daily suffer the indignity?

She loosens, parts, and spreads in ruin o'er the tide.\n\nShipwreckSource\n\n• William Falconer, Shipwreck (1762), Canto III, line 642.\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Shipwreck\" (Sourced)\n\nTragedy occurs when a human soul awakes and seeks, in suffering and pain, to free itself from crime, violence, infamy, even at the cost of life. The struggle is the tragedy - not defeat or death. That is why the spectacle of tragedy has always filled men, not with despair, but with a sense of hope and exaltation.

Whereas I'm not at all convinced that's the case. In fact, if anything, I'm convinced that it's the opposite.\n\nErrol MorrisSource\n\nThere is something that happens to the mind in moments of terror. Perhaps we figure it's the last we'll ever have and we record it for the rest of our long journey. We take perfect snapshots, an album to despair over. We trim the edges and place them in plastic. We tuck the scrapbook away to take out in our ruined times.\n\nColum McCannSource\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Colum McCann\" (Quotes, Let the Great World Spin (2009), Book One: A Fear of Love)\n\nThe Serpent's Egg - \" set in Berlin between November 3rd and November 11th in 1923...There has never been another director who yielded to despair in his movies as often as Bergman does, but generally he has had enough theatricality to pull the audience along...This time, his theatricality fails him, and his misery sits on the screen like a dull, dark ache.\"\n\nWhen the Lights Go Down (book)Source\n\nYou may burn my body to ashes, and scatter them to the winds of heaven; you may drag my soul down to the regions of darkness and despair to be tormented forever; but you will never get me to support a measure which I believe to be wrong, although by doing so I may accomplish that which I believe to be right.\n\nRight and wrongSource\n\n• Attributed to Abraham Lincoln. Ida M. Tarbell, The Life of Abraham Lincoln (1900), vol. 1, p. 139. This book is based on the reminiscences of contemporaries of Lincoln's. General T. H. Henderson of Illinois related this story—told by his father, who had served with Lincoln in the Illinois legislature—which \"illustrates his character for integrity and his firmness in maintaining what he regarded as right in his public acts\". This incident is supposed to have occurred during the session of 1836–1837, when efforts were made to move the capital of Illinois to Springfield; a bill to that effect was coupled with another measure that Lincoln did not approve of. \"Finally, after midnight … Mr. Lincoln rose amid the silence and solemnity which prevailed, and, my father said, made one of the most eloquent and powerful speeches to which he had ever listened. He concluded his remarks\" with the words above (pp. 138–39).\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Right and wrong\" (Quotes)\n\nThe effect of these researches has been, a persuasion, that we need not despair of seeing, even in our own time, a renovation of sound philosophy, directed by the light which the History of Science sheds.

A mechanical description of the act tells us nothing, any more than a scientifically accurate account of mastication will convey the flavour of roast duck.\n\nAnthony BurgessSource\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Anthony Burgess\" (Non-Fiction, Flame Into Being: The Life and Work of D. H. Lawrence (1985))\n\nThere's an inherent limit to the stress that any material can bear. Water has its boiling point, metals their melting points. The elements of the spirit behave the same way. Happiness can reach a pitch so great that any further happiness can't be felt. Pain, despair, humiliation, disgust, and fear are no different. Once the vessel is full, the world can't add to it.\n\nStefan ZweigSource\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Stefan Zweig\" (Quotes, The Post Office Girl (1982))\n\nValmiki's Sanskrit poem Is filled with lyrical descriptions of Nature. Rama and Lakshmana are tricked into leaving Sita unprotected in the forest and when they return they find her vanished. She has been kidnapped by Ravana.

This is a very despairing outlook, in its way as black as Augustine's original sin, for it supposes that original goodness will in all likelihood be defiled…It surrenders the attempt to represent virtue in a mature phase.\n\nMarina WarnerSource\n\n• Joan of Arc (Harmondsworth, Penguin, [1981] 1983) p. 262.\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Marina Warner\" (Sourced)\n\nThe death of God left the angels in a strange position. They were overtaken suddenly by a fundamental question. One can attempt to imagine the moment. How did they look at the instant the question invaded them, flooding the angelic consciousness, taking hold with terrifying force?

But his cry was unheard; in the wild melée he was not seen, or his fate was uncared for. I saw on the dark face the sickly hue of despair.

In his view, viable images of futures were the key to real progress. And, it is true, that the latter half of that century was dominated by Dystopian views. Many of Polak’s detailed observations remain pertinent. But it is not the case that the ability to envisage different and better futures has vanished forever.

We came not into this life by exile, but we came as innocent creatures of God, to learn how to [[worship] the holy and eternal spirit and seek the hidden secrets within ourselves from the beauty of life. This is the truth which I have learned from the teachings of the Nazarene.\n\nKhalil GibranSource\n\n• Khalil in Spirits Rebellious (1908) \"Khalil The Heretic\" Part 3\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Khalil Gibran\" (Quotes)\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\n\nTimesSource\n\n• Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities, chapter 1, opening paragraph, p. 3 (1958). Originally published in 1859.\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Times\" (Quotes)\n\nIf I ask myself who in history I might like to have been, I find that all the men I most admire were by most standards deeply unhappy. They knew despair. But their lives were worthwhile — I only wish mine equaled theirs in this respect and I have no doubt that they were glad to die. As one deserves a good night's sleep, one also deserves to die, Why should I hope to wake again? To do what I have not done in the time I've had? All of us have so much more time than we use well. How many hours in a life are spent in a way of which one might be proud, looking back?\n\nWalter Kaufmann (philosopher)Source\n\n• \"Death\", p. 372\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)\" (Quotes, The Faith of a Heretic (1959))\n\nWhereas logic and objectivity are usually the predominant features of a man's outer attitude, or are at least regarded as ideals, in the case of a woman it is feeling. But in the soul it is the other way round: inwardly it is the man who feels, and the woman who reflects. Hence a man's greater liability to total despair, while a woman can always find comfort and hope; accordingly a man is more likely to put an end to himself than a woman. However much a victim of social circumstances a woman may be, as a prostitute for instance, a man is no less a victim of impulses from the unconscious, taking the form of alcoholism and other vices.\n\nCarl JungSource\n\n• Psychological Types (1921).

P.805\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Carl Jung\" (Quotes)\n\nFrom where I stand, I do not see the lost people of the South Seas, the defeated and the despairing, shrunken shadows of those who went before. What I observe are the proud descendants of some of the most remarkable explorers and settlers who ever lived. We carry the cultural and historical inheritance of ocean navigators of peerless skill and their courageous kin who crossed vast distances before the tribes of Europe had ventured forth from their small part of the earth. Our forebearers populated islands scattered over the world's greatest stretch of water, covering a fifth of the planet's surface. It was one of the most amazing migrations in history, a triumphant testimony to human endurance, fortitude and achievement.\n\nKamisese MaraSource\n\nThank God for the iron in the blood of our fathers, the men who upheld the wisdom of Lincoln, and bore sword or rifle in the armies of Grant! Let us, the children of the men who proved themselves equal to the mighty days, let us, the children of the men who carried the great Civil War to a triumphant conclusion, praise the God of our fathers that the ignoble counsels of peace were rejected; that the suffering and loss, the blackness of sorrow and despair, were unflinchingly faced, and the years of strife endured; for in the end the slave was freed, the Union restored, and the mighty American republic placed once more as a helmeted queen among nations.\n\nAbout Ulysses S. GrantSource\n\n• Theodore Roosevelt, The Strenuous Life (10 April 1899), Chicago, Illinois.\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Ulysses S. Grant\" (Quotes about Grant)\n\nThe Army of the Revolution is recruited by the Soldiers of Despair. Therefore, down with any Scheme which gives men Hope. In so far as it succeeds it curtails our recruiting ground and reinforces the ranks of our Enemies. Such opposition is to be counted upon, and to be utilised as the best of all tributes to the value of our work. Those who thus count upon violence and bloodshed are too few to hinder, and their opposition will merely add to the momentum with which I hope and believe this Scheme will ultimately be enabled to surmount all dissent, and achieve, with the blessing of God, that measure of success with which I verily believe it to be charged.\n\nWilliam BoothSource\n\n• In Darkest England : And The Way Out (1890), p. 81\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"William Booth\" (Quotes)\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\n\nOpening linesSource\n\n• A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens.\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Opening lines\" (T)\n\nAfter this the Fiend came again with his heat and with his stench, and gave me much ado, the stench was so vile and so painful, and also dreadful and travailous. Also I heard a bodily jangling, as if it had been of two persons; and both, to my thinking, jangled at one time as if they had holden a parliament with a great busy-ness; and all was soft muttering, so that I understood nought that they said. And all this was to stir me to despair, as methought, — seeming to me as they mocked at praying of prayers which are said boisterously with mouth, failing devout attending and wise diligence: the which we owe to God in our prayers.\n\nJulian of NorwichSource\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Julian of Norwich\" (The Sixteenth Revelation, Chapter 69)\n\nThere are no arguments. Can anyone who has reached the limit bother with arguments, causes, effects, moral considerations, and so forth? Of course not. For such a person there are only unmotivated motives for living. On the heights of despair, the passion for the absurd is the only thing that can still throw a demonic light on chaos. When all the current reasons—moral, esthetic, religious, social, and so on—no longer guide one's life, how can one sustain life without succumbing to nothingness? Only by a connection with the absurd, by love of absolute uselessness, loving something which does not have substance but which simulates an illusion of life. I live because the mountains do not laugh and the worms do not sing.\n\nEmil CioranSource\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Emil Cioran\" (Quotes, On the Heights of Despair (1934): Romanian title: Pe culmile disperării)\n\nAnd I wanted to say something before I go — I told you guys it's been a bad year — when you have these kind of moments when you are in despair, I just want to remind you that God does not take a break — he does not clock out, he doesn't get caught off-guard — there is nothing that goes on that he is not allowing. So everything is as it should be, no matter how wrong, or scary, or sad, or angry, or afraid, or any of it — everything is as it should be. And we need to remember that, and that we love Him and He loves us. Whatever we're feeling, we need to remember the truth.\n\nYsabella BraveSource\n\n• Quote from video posted a day after both her YouTube channels were suspended (have been reinstated), two days after being laid off, and about a month after the cause of her worsening chronic pain was diagnosed as fibromyalgia (no cure or e"
