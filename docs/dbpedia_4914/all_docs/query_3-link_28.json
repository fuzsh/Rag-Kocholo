        "text": "For one of the distortions that often afflict the regular course of scholarship, Thoreau’s magnum opus, Walden; or Life in the Woods, once acquired in literature the status of a quintessential American Transcendentalist text, has for long come to preclude any systematic reassessment of the philosophical significance of Thoreau’s post-1850s, empirically informed, naturalistic writings, and of his overall figure beyond Emerson’s haunting shadow. In accordance with the most recent strands of scholarship, the present investigation thus intends to contribute to the debunking of the critical myth of Thoreau’s ‘post-Walden philosophical decline’, by redefying his 1850s transition towards empirical naturalism as an anticipation of a proto-pragmatist, more specifically proto-Deweyan, relational epistemology – of a conception of knowledge as a ‘mode of participation’, as opposed to the passive and dispassionate ‘spectator theory of knowledge’ Dewey ascribes to traditional philosophical and scientific doctrines. In particular, findings its inception in a shortcoming of contemporary literature, namely, the hitherto ignored task of restoring an evolutionary continuity, or discontinuity, between Thoreau the later proto-pragmatist, empirical naturalist vis-à-vis the former Transcendentalist, the present inquiry intends to identify genealogically the specific philosophical traits his natural philosophy acquired, or conversely abandoned, during his troubled post-1850s emancipatory movement from his mentor, and that allowed him to formalize, at the time of his intellectual maturity, a proto-pragmatist epistemology. It is my contention that this pragmatist conception of knowledge Thoreau articulated in later years is actually rooted in two main traits his philosophy acquired throughout his 1850s transition, and that would successively become pivotal in Dewey’s empirical naturalism as presented in his Experience and Nature. First, a naturalistic metaphysics based upon the acceptance of the irreducibly contingent character of the kosmos, as emerged from Thoreau early understanding, and, to a certain degree, anticipation, of the evolutionary principles underpinning Darwin’s developmental theory. Second, a fundamentally non-dualistic conception of human experience, in which subject and object, fact and value intertwine, and its fundamental interrelatedness with nature. In conclusion, what the present investigation will offer, as suggested by its title, is a genealogy of the proto-pragmatist epistemology Thoreau developed in his later years. A constitutively moral, epistemological paradigm I take Thoreau to have envisioned early on in his life as grounding in men’s interest in the natural world, in their being ‘in-between’ nature (inter- ‘between’; esse ‘to be’). Not simply science, but a ‘con-science’, namely, the morally invested, ‘practical growth’ of the modes through which human and nonhuman nature interact.\n\nOne of Henry David Thoreau’s great accomplishments was to develop a form of rhetoric that combined elements of both transcendentalism and empiricism for the purpose of bridging the divide between mind and body, culture and nature, and poetry and science. Content neither with eulogizing Spirit nor categorizing Nature, Thoreau saw science as a poetic art whose function was to reveal the ways in which the human spirit is an interconnected part of the natural environment. Initially a follower of Emerson who saw in Nature evidence of the romantic sublime, Thoreau eventually came to value natural inquiry for its aesthetic and pragmatic consequences. The focus on his essay, however, is how this attitude also produced rhetorical consequences. Specifically, I show how Thoreau developed what I call the rhetoric of Transcendental Ecology that employs the language of science and poetry to make possible the anticipation of beauty so that the audience recognizes, values, and preserves their vital connection with Nature.\n\nThis paper explores the contribution that the German mystic and scientist, Georg von Hardenberg (Novalis), made to our understanding of nature, and our relation to it through language. Though largely unexamined in the modern era, his writings offer real insights into how we should regard nature as being a 'mystical body', rather than an adjunct to utilitarianism. Coming from a scientific background, he nonetheless possessed a deep understanding of man 'in' nature, rather than somehow objective to it. I explore his thought through the prism of his little-known work 'The Novices of Sais', a visionary text of its time. Novalis's thought is key to changing our approach to agribusiness, environmental depredation, climate change and our alienation from nature itself.\n\nThe point of this paper is to foster an awareness of the varied uses to which scholars are putting the term 'ecocriticism' in varied perspectives today. Thoreau's Walden is such indisputable literary monument on environmental literature to explore, upkeep and strengthen interest in establishing pragmatic relationship between the human and natural worlds. Thoreau lived simply without \" modern improvements \" which he called \" improved means to unimproved ends. \" This displays how one places oneself in the nature world, understands nature, and the environmental aspects to cast-off materialism. Thoreau rejects what is profane and superficial but pleads nature as the storehouse of sincerity and impartiality. He proves that society creates loneliness and fear, which can be dispelled by content with Nature. A man is never alone if he is aware of his non-human relationships. The paper perhaps is a seminal attempt to make some evolution toward fostering and legitimizing the sweats of ecocritics in ecocriticism (across) milieu. It sufficiently accounts for the personal connection and sense of responsibility towards self, society, literary studies and nature. Thoreau's Walden elevates the concept of ecocriticism further to have interdisciplinary impact beyond prejudice to create a 'universal discipline' to discuss, innovate and create healthy literature-environment anthology to live in for progenies. This convinces intellectuals to pursue an interest in ecology while enduring literary professionals. Thoreau's belief in nature sets new tenets that address the major ecological concerns to see it 'greening' to prevent 'The Endangered Earth-a virulent veracity' tomorrow.\n\n\"Considered as the self-evident alternative to human society, Nature has always been the other place where the subject - the narrative subject in our case - tries to re-position itself in order to gain a new point of view on its life, on its relations, and on the society he/she used to belong to, in the attempt to negotiate a new existence. A new existence supposed to be more real, pure, authentic, sincere, paradoxically even more human, than the one he/she used to live among human beings. A new positioning supposed to give the subject a better view on the society and the self, a new connection with the roots of life and a less conditioned voice. A better way for human cognitive processes. The paper will take into account H. D. Thoreau’s 'Walden' (1854), Italo Calvino’s 'Il barone rampante' (1957) and the movie 'In to the wild' (Sean Penn, USA 2007, from the novel by Jon Krakauer, 1996), in order to understand how the displacement of the subject is carried out. It will also try to trace a development of the 'nature alternative' from Thoreau’s short-timed experience of a new possibility of existence, through the fantastic model of the Barone rampante’s one-man revolution, to the tragic, extreme ending of 'In to the wild'. From the middle of the XIX century to our days something is changed in our relationship with the 'otherness' of Nature and in the reasons to choose that 'otherness' against human society, the paper will outline the changes in Western culture which lie behind the differences shown in these three works.\""
