        "text": "9-10 September 2024, San José, Costa Rica\n\nThe 19th Meeting of the Committee on Tourism and Sustainability will discuss the main subjects of the global sustainability agenda. The presence of leading international experts and stakeholders will facilitate an enriching and guiding discussion to advance our goals of sustainable and resilient tourism development.\n\nRegister Here\n\nPreliminary Programme\n\n9 September 2024, Hotel Marriot Hacienda Belén\n\n9:00 - 10:00 WELCOME SESSION\n\nOpening Ceremony\n\nWelcoming Remarks\n\nCultural Performance\n\n10:00 - 11:00 THEMATIC SESSION 1: The future of tourism and desired development\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving world, the tourism sector is at a crucial crossroads, balancing growth, and sustainability. This thematic session will explore the promising future of tourism and the desired pathways for its development. At its core, tourism serves as an important source of well-being and prosperity for local communities, fostering economic growth and cultural enrichment. With the world more than ever driven by a growing middle class and an increasingly mobile population, tourism is expected to see more than 35 billion domestic, same-day and international visitors annually by 2030. This session will reflect on the approach to advancing destination management using the Social Progress Index, with a particular focus on Costa Rica's historical context and achievements. By inspiring commitment and delivering impactful results, this discussion aims to chart a course for a more inclusive, responsible and vibrant tourism sector.\n\n11:00 - 11:30 Coffee Break\n\n11:30 - 12:30 THEMATIC SESSION 2: Redefining the limits of acceptable change\n\nAs global mobility increases and tourism continues to expand, the need to redefine the limits of acceptable change in tourist destinations becomes more critical. This thematic session will address the pressing questions of how to determine these acceptable limits, how to avoid saturation in popular destinations and how to reduce the undesirable footprint of tourism activities. By examining success stories and strategies, we aim to identify effective methods for achieving resilience and promoting inclusivity within the tourism sector. The session will also explore the importance of fostering a symbiotic partnership between environmental and tourism authorities, aligning their efforts to create sustainable and thriving destinations. Through this inclusive dialogue, we aim to pave the way for a balanced and forward-looking approach to tourism management.\n\n12:30 - 13:30 Lunch\n\n13:30 - 14:30 THEMATIC SESSION 3: Nature Positive Tourism - what are key enablers\n\nTravel and Tourism stand at a critical juncture where their influence can redefine global practices, embracing a path towards a net positive impact on biodiversity. By adopting a Nature Positive approach, the industry commits to halting and reversing detrimental impacts on nature, fostering an environment where biodiversity thrives. This shift is not just a moral imperative but a strategic one, as over 80% of the industry's value hinges on the integrity of natural ecosystems (Nature Positive Travel & Tourism, WTTC, September 22). From sourcing raw materials to the allure of nature-based tourism, every facet of Travel and Tourism is intertwined with biodiversity. Wilderness restoration in tourism, as promoted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2021), focuses on rewilding, which restores ecosystems by allowing wildlife to reclaim areas without human intervention. This process revitalizes landscapes, restores biodiversity and creates exciting new opportunities for sustainable tourism.\n\n14:30 - 15:30 THEMATIC SESSION 4: Climate Action and circularity\n\nThe significant impact of climate change on the tourism sector, the sector's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the important role the sector can play in both mitigation and adaptation, requires a more active participation of national governments (tourism administrations and organisations) in the Glasgow Declaration. This will lead to the adoption of Tourism Climate Action Plans that address the strategic pathways: measure, decarbonise, regenerate, collaborate and finance. As we move towards the submission of the next NDCs report in 2025, UN Tourism is committed to better supporting tourism policymakers in addressing this important gap. While an impressive 850 signatories have committed to the Glasgow Declaration, which aims to halve tourism emissions by 2030, the entire sector needs to be more proactive in climate action to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Climate action in the tourism sector still lags behind the high ambitions called for at COP25. The commitment of leading actors shows that strong climate action is possible and often triggers systemic change across the value chain, leading to circular economy approaches that in turn drive transformative change in destinations and businesses. This session will discuss the key enablers needed to further catalyse these changes and guide the transformation of the sector and prepare for the inaugural inclusion of tourism within the thematic program for COP29 by the host country Azerbaijan.\n\n15:30 - 16:00 Coffee Break\n\n16:00 - 16:30 CLOSING REMARKS\n\n17:00 Cocktail Costa Rica Hotel Marriott Hacienda Belén\n\n19:00 Dinner by your own\n\n10 September 2024:\n\n9:00 Open coffee station\n\n9:30 - 10:00 WELCOME REMARKS\n\n10:00 - 11:00 THEMATIC SESSION 5: Green Claims and the evolution of certifications in the tourism sector\n\nThe tourism sector is increasingly embracing sustainability, and labels and certifications play an important role in the sector's efforts to promote sustainability throughout the value chain. This brings both challenges and opportunities. Driven by the European Commission's Green Claims Directive, these discussions have recently intensified as the sector will be heavily impacted by these changes. This session aims to discuss and reflect on the possible impacts and guide policy makers in this process to ensure that tourism activities have a positive impact on the environment, local communities and economies.\n\n11:00 - 12:00 CTS Members - CLOSING REMARKS"
