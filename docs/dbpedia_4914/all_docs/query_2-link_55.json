        "text": "The Biblioteca Sant Gervasi Joan Maragall designed by BCQ Arquitectes has this year been awarded with first prize in the Architecture and Urbanism category of the Ciudad de Barcelona Awards. In order to mark the occasion we are delighted to publish our article from B-Guided #59 with our review of the building which we first published online back in June of last year. Congratulations to David Baena and Toni Casamor.\n\nBarcelona’s latest public library is a modest but nonetheless compelling building that integrates perfectly with its landscaped setting within the grounds of the Vil.la Florida Civic Centre in the Sant Gervasi neighbourhood. The library burrows into one side of the site becoming an inhabited retaining wall and substrate for the overhead garden which surrounds the villa. Occupying almost two city blocks the landscaped gardens straddle a change in street level between C/ Muntaner and C/ Sant Gervasi de Cassoles providing a valuable green resource within this densely built-up part of Barcelona. The two storey library building volume is fractured in order to create a series of intimate human scale interior spaces which are organised around three courtyards that bring light deep into the basement area. The book storage and administrative areas are located at the rear of the building at the interface with the retaining wall. A new external stair gives additional public access to the civic centre and gardens. The building envelope is expressed by a zig-zag arrangement of thick battered rendered walls, only two built volumes are legible within the gardens, one providing access and the other accommodating a rooflight over the children’s library below."
