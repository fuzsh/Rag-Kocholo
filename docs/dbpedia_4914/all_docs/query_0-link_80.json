This is somewhat surprising given the disrepute into which Nietzscheanism fell during and immediately following World War II. Something in his writing strikes a sympathetic—or antipathetic—chord in many, so no doubt the interest will survive well into the 21st century and beyond. This Historical Dictionary of Nietzscheanism explores Nietzsche the man as well as Nietzsche the philosopher, describing both his career and his thought. It also presents earlier thinkers who influenced Nietzsche’s philosophy, contemporaries who both agreed and disagreed with him, and others who interpreted (or misinterpreted) his philosophy for later generations. It contains a chronology, a general introduction, a dictionary containing numerous concise entries, and an extensive bibliography. This expanded edition, like the first, is written by Carol Diethe. A graduate of London University, Dr. Diethe has researched, written, and lectured on Nietzsche for many years. During her career, she composed and taught undergraduate and graduate courses on the affect of Nietzsche’s thought on European cultural history. Her publications include Nietzsche’s Women: Beyond the Whip and a translation of Nietzsche’s On the Genealogy of Morality. Her biography of Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, Nietzsche’s Sister and the Will to Power, was published in 2003.

His paternal grandmother in particular had mixed in high circles. His young mother, Franziska Nietzsche—just 17 when she married his father and 19 when she gave birth to Friedrich—came from a pastor’s family that was not only slightly lower on the social scale but also much more zealously evangelical in outlook, belonging to the neo-Pietist persuasion in contrast to the rational Lutheranism of the Nietzsches. Nietzsche’s father died when Nietzsche was almost five and his sister, Elisabeth (later to become Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche), was four, forcing the whole family, consisting of Nietzsche himself, his grandmother Erdmuthe, her two unmarried daughters, Auguste and Rosalie, Franziska, Elisabeth, and an elderly female maid, to decamp to Naumburg, Erdmuthe’s former home. Eventually, Franziska was able to have her own household in which the devotional atmosphere continued unabated. Nietzsche entered the village school at Röcken on 15 October 1849, his fifth birthday. When the family moved to Naumburg, he attended the elementary school for three years before spending the two years 1853– 1855 at the private establishment of Carl Moritz Weber. He proceeded to the Cathedral Grammar School (Domgymnasium) in Naumburg for three years and from thence to the prestigious boarding school at Schulpforta, not far from Jena, where he studied for six years (1858–1864). This was the period when he conceived his profound love for Greek literature and philosophy. He enrolled as a theology student in 1864 at Bonn, where, for a year, he studied philology as his second subject until making this his primary subject at Easter 1865, prior to moving to Leipzig University later that year. ix\n\nx •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt was only when Nietzsche entered Bonn University that he began to question his religious certainties. By the time he was appointed professor of philology at Basel University at the phenomenally young age of 24, he had lost his belief in God, although he still gravitated toward neo-Pietists in Basel, such as Jacob Burckhardt and Johann Jakob Bachofen. At that time, Basel was an important evangelical center. Among the early Nietzscheans, a focal point of debate was the iconoclasm of Nietzsche’s declaration, in The Gay Science (1882), that God is dead (GS, III: 125). One position commonly adopted was that Nietzsche had simply not meant what he had said and must have retained his Christian beliefs. After 10 years of university teaching, Nietzsche was forced to retire early on grounds of ill health. He received a pension from Basel University that remained his chief source of income until his death, though by that point the administration of the pension had passed through the hands of his friend Franz Overbeck, his mother, and his sister (by now the widow of the anti-Semitic high school teacher Bernard Förster). Nietzsche would remain a helpless invalid from his mental collapse in Turin in 1889 until he died in Weimar in 1900. The Basel years (1869–1879) were the years when Nietzsche mixed in society. He had already met Richard Wagner in Leipzig in 1868 and remained for some years a fervent admirer of Wagner’s genius, spending Christmas with the Wagners in 1869 and 1870 and visiting them when they moved to Bayreuth, having attended the ceremonial laying of the foundation stone for the Festspielhaus in 1872. Nietzsche was entranced by Tristan und Isolde (1865), but when he attended rehearsals of The Ring at Bayreuth in 1876, he realized that the gulf between himself and the Wagners was unbridgeable: this gulf was made deeper by Wagner’s religious theme in Parsifal (1882). Although it has been speculated that Nietzsche was inordinately fond of Cosima Wagner, it is likely to have been because she was a motherly woman, the type of woman toward whom he habitually gravitated. When Nietzsche first met her at the idyllic “Tribschen” (villa beside Lake Lucerne), she was surrounded by children and animals and indeed was heavily pregnant with Siegfried at that time. Another motherly woman in the Wagner circle, Malwida von Meysenbug, became his close friend and sponsor. During his teaching career, Nietzsche contemplated marriage on several occasions, though possibly the only woman\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xi\n\nhe would have viewed as really suitable was Lou Andreas-Salomé, whom he met in 1882. Their friendship never became the close collaboration that Nietzsche had hoped it would, and Lou Salomé’s suspicion that Nietzsche wanted more than just friendship angered her sufficiently for her to break off all further personal contact with him. Once Nietzsche had retired, his illness, which manifested itself in migraine, stomach trouble, and sleeplessness and might or might not have been syphilis (this has never been satisfactorily determined), meant that Nietzsche would be essentially alone for the rest of his life. He set about discovering the most congenial spots in Europe and settled on Sils Maria in the Swiss Engadine for the summer and (latterly) Turin in Italy for the winter. He loved the mountains and the sea and went for long walks. When his weak eyes permitted, he read and wrote. All his major works, apart from The Birth of Tragedy (1872), Untimely Meditations (1873–1875), and the first volume of Human, All Too Human, are the products of these nomadic, lonely years, although he wrote many letters. Indeed, Nietzsche was never short of friends until the last few months of his life, when he appears to have been bent on upsetting his correspondents in a succession of vitriolic missives. Surprisingly, in view of some of his misogynist pronouncements, which were inspired by his deep suspicion of nascent feminism, some of his closest friends were women, and, indeed, some of these were active campaigners for women’s emancipation, such as Meta von Salis-Marschlins. The reason for this apparent paradox was that many intelligent women thought Nietzsche’s ideas were so liberating for the individual—of either sex—that his defamatory remarks on campaigners for female rights could be brushed aside. Since Nietzsche had alienated himself from many of his friends in the period before his collapse in Turin, he was to all intents and purposes alone in the city when he collapsed in January 1989 and had to be fetched back to Germany by Overbeck. He was treated in a Jena asylum until it was realized that no improvement was in sight. From 1893 on, Franziska, aided by her daughter, looked after Nietzsche at her home in Naumburg. After Franziska Nietzsche’s death in 1897, Elisabeth moved with her brother to Weimar, where she would go on to found a veritable “Nietzsche industry” in the Nietzsche-Archiv. Sometimes Nietzsche was virtually “put on show” to special guests who visited the house. Until Elisabeth’s death in 1935, this commodious house was virtually a\n\nxii •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nplace of pilgrimage for Nietzsche enthusiasts of every stamp, although Nietzsche himself had died on 25 August 1900.\n\nNIETZSCHE THE PHILOSOPHER Nietzsche’s publications fall into three natural categories: the early works, 1872–1876, the works of a middle period when Nietzsche was successfully fighting off the shackles of paid employment at Basel, and the final period prior to his mental collapse. Phase 1: 1872–1876 In the early work The Birth of Tragedy (1872), Nietzsche puts forward a metaphysical conception of music derived from Arthur Schopenhauer, but whereas the latter’s pessimism offered only renunciation as an escape from the pain of existence, Nietzsche honed his ideas into an affirmative metaphysic. He argued that reality is divided into a world of appearances that we perceive and inhabit—which Nietzsche dubs “the Apollinian”—and an underlying timeless, undifferentiated ground of being corresponding to what Nietzsche terms “the Dionysian.” The apparent order in the Apollinian world is balanced by the chaos, contradictions, and flux of Dionysianism. The two Greek gods represent human qualities and are manifest in our human instincts. Nietzsche’s fondness for the figure of Dionysus was such that he later abandoned the mythical dimension and in The Gay Science applied the term to “he who suffers from a superabundance of life” (GS: V, 370). Here, the distinction between aestheticism and the suffering individual no longer applies, since a person who creates his own life is both an artist and a tragic hero. Just before he went insane, Nietzsche conflated the figure of Dionysus with that of Christ and became the apotheosis of his own metaphysics when he signed himself “Dionysus the crucified.” Nietzsche’s next work, Untimely Meditations (1873–1875), was less innovative than The Birth of Tragedy. Arranged in four essays and at first published separately under the titles “David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer” (1873), “On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life” (1874), “Schopenhauer as Educator” (1874), and “Richard Wag-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xiii\n\nner in Bayreuth” (1876), it contained a good deal of scorching critique, not always directed at the right target. The praise of Wagner in the last essay had to be shaken off, and the abuse heaped on David Strauss in the first essay masks the fact that Nietzsche had much in common with his skeptic views. Thus, Nietzsche’s bitter attack on Strauss’s Der alte und neue Glaube, 1872 (The Old Faith and the New, 1873) targeted its author’s intellectual complacency and bad style. In the second essay, “On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life,” Nietzsche conceded that every person and every nation needs some knowledge of the past, but this should not force the individual to forfeit the capacity to live a full life. Nietzsche recommended the power of forgetting so that an individual can act in a way that is not motivated by the clutter of an indirect knowledge of history, but from direct experience: “Forgetting is essential to action of any kind” (UM, II: “On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life,” 1). At this stage in his career, Nietzsche was still complimentary toward Schopenhauer and Wagner, so that the previously mentioned essays on both men are little short of hymns of praise, but this situation would change radically: Nietzsche soon came to see Schopenhauer’s pessimism as life denying and Wagner’s sultry romanticism as decadent. Phase 2: 1877–1881 In Nietzsche’s second book, Human, All Too Human (I: 1878, II: 1880), there is no theme as such, though his observations are organized in sections, a principle he followed in his next works, Daybreak (1881) and The Gay Science (1882). Human, All Too Human was written in an aphoristic style that Nietzsche would subsequently discover best suited his train of thought. It contains a broad range of themes, but the dominant one is a scornful rejection of Christianity. Nietzsche suggests that those who profess a belief in the Christian religion would cease to do so if only they could overcome the “aberration of reason and imagination” (HH, I, iii: 135) that makes them seek redemption from being themselves. He declares that the Christian flock has been duped by the (ascetic) priest into a feeling of guilt that weakens the individual and the whole of society. Subtitled A Book for Free Spirits, Human, All Too Human is exactly that: an invitation to the free and enquiring mind to subject prejudices, customs, and beliefs to scrutiny.\n\nxiv •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNietzsche’s next work, Daybreak, is even less coherently organized than its predecessor, in spite of its apparently tidy division into preface and five books. The critique of morality is a theme continued from Human, All Too Human. Society is at a watershed; children do not obey their parents (D, III: 176), and the state encourages intelligent people to neglect their talents by keeping abreast of current affairs, thus stifling their creativity: “Our age may talk about economy but it is in fact a squanderer: it squanders the most precious thing there is, the spirit” (D, III: 179). The great and the good (Immanuel Kant, Martin Luther, and many others) are systematically picked off as targets for Nietzsche’s critique. As a sequel to its “free spirit” precursor, Daybreak stands as a compendium of Nietzsche’s objections to the Zeitgeist and is intended to invigorate debate rather than arouse belief. In fact, Daybreak “presents its dominant and recurring subjects in as higgeldy-piggeldy a way as he [Nietzsche] could contrive” (Michael Tanner, Daybreak, introduction). In The Gay Science (1882), his third book written in the style of aphorisms, Nietzsche raises his central topic of the death of God, which he sees as a cheerful and liberating prospect for mankind. Rejecting the pessimism of Schopenhauer when faced with nihilism, Nietzsche set himself against both the pretensions of contemporary science and the teachings of transcendentalism represented by Christianity. In declaring that God is dead and that man is therefore free from the repressive restraint manifested by conventional moral strictures, Nietzsche cautioned that man should not run headlong into the straitjacket provided by scientific reason (a popular escape route for many skeptics of his generation). Science could only provide biased answers based on logic: and since man is only partially logical, Nietzsche believed that the answers would necessarily be inadequate. The book records Nietzsche’s search for the value of truth and engages with his belief in European decadence, both themes he would cover exhaustively—and no longer in aphorisms—in Beyond Good and Evil and On the Genealogy of Morality. Book 5 of The Gay Science was added to the original four in the second edition of 1887. Nietzsche started on Thus Spoke Zarathustra early in 1883, immediately after finishing book 4 of The Gay Science. This explains why his two major preoccupations in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, eternal return and Zarathustra, make their first appearance at the end\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xv\n\nof book 4 of The Gay Science (1882) as an apparent afterthought but in fact are intended as a trailblazer for his next book. The unscheduled addition of book 5 of The Gay Science takes the thunder out of the first hint of eternal return (GS, IV: 341) and dilutes the entrée of Zarathustra (GS, IV: 342), which now appear randomly “sandwiched.” The fourth book of The Gay Science also introduced the concept of self-creativity, of “becoming who we are” (GS, IV: 335), which became a Leitmotif in Nietzsche’s thought, reaching its apotheosis in the concept of the Übermensch. Phase 3: 1882–1889 What Nietzsche brought to Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883–1885) was a difference in tone as well as philosophical content. The work is written in a dithyrambic style quite unlike the pithy irony of his earlier works. Having suffered the loss of Lou Andreas-Salomé’s friendship in the fall of 1882, Nietzsche included some bitter jibes about women in the first two parts of Thus Spoke Zarathustra (begun in January 1883), most notoriously in the old woman’s advice to Zarathustra if visiting women: “do not forget the whip!” (Za I: “Of Old and Young Women”). Although interpretations of this famous passage vary, Nietzsche was canny in placing these words in the mouth of an old woman. That said, most commentators are forced to concede that Nietzsche was virulently antifeminist, if not misogynist; he hated the very idea of scholarly women. This has not necessarily put women off his philosophy. Many early campaigners for women’s emancipation realized that the concept of the Übermensch, discussed later, could apply to women just as well as to men and decided to ignore Nietzsche’s antifeminist barbs. Thus Spoke Zarathustra introduces the concepts of the Übermensch and the will to power for the first time. It also elaborates on the theme of eternal return that was touched on in The Gay Science, where Zarathustra also made a brief appearance. The mention of eternal return in The Gay Science is actually a potted version of what Zarathustra will need several attempts to explain. In The Gay Science, the demon’s bleak view is as follows: What if a demon crept after you one day or night in your loneliest solitude and said to you: “this life, as you live it now and have lived it, you will have to live again and again, times without number” . . . the question in\n\nxvi •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nall and every thing: “do you want this again and again, times without number?” would lie as the heaviest burden upon all your actions. (GS, IV: 341)\n\nThe first mention of eternal return in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, part 3, 1884 (found in the section “Of the Vision and the Riddle”), sees Zarathustra struggling to explain the concept to the dwarf (his alter ego); the dwarf declares that time is a circle, but Nietzsche/Zarathustra’s view appears to see time as infinitely linear. The cosmological physics break down, but the notion of eternal return is rescued by Nietzsche’s invention of the will to power as the driving force in all life (to which he also applies a measure of physics); we learn that eternal return demands a readiness to will the return of every detail of our lives (already mooted in the passage from The Gay Science): “Alas, man recurs eternally! The little man recurs eternally” (Za, III: “The Convalescent”). The affirmative person must will the eternal return of everything, however disgusting: “The greatest all too small!—that was my disgust at man! And eternal recurrence even for the smallest! that was my disgust at all existence!” (Za, III: “The Convalescent”). Nietzsche elaborates on this when Zarathustra tells the Higher Men, “If you ever wanted one moment twice, if you ever said: ‘you please me, happiness, instant, moment!’ then you wanted everything to return!” (Za, IV: “The Intoxicated Song,” 10). Everything—even the little man. Since Nietzsche’s works continued to be met with bland indifference, in 1885 he had to pay for the publication of the fourth part of Thus Spoke Zarathustra himself. It is ironic in view of the subsequent notoriety of the key concept introduced in the work: the will to power. The will to power represented Nietzsche’s method of expressing a form of nonmetaphysical transcendence. He postulated that it operated through all living things, reaching its summation in one man’s exercise of power over another. At best, Nietzsche anticipated that this type of power could be sublimated, so that man would exercise control over himself rather than others. This Selbstüberwindung, or self-overcoming, involves suffering and self-control, the type of hardness he believed the ancient Greeks had possessed before Socratic reasoning emasculated their culture. The person able to redirect the will to power in this manner would be the Übermensch. The Übermensch rather than eternal return was the concept that made Zarathustra a cult book at the turn of the century.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xvii\n\nIn directing the will to power onto himself, the Übermensch wills all things in their totality and for eternity. Thus, the notion of eternal return comes into play as well as the central premise of the Übermensch: life affirmation. This affirmation extends to loving one’s destiny, whatever it may bring, and is encapsulated in the term amor fati. The Übermensch will recognize the Dionysian man within himself and will establish his own value system without recourse to outmoded value systems that are dependent on sterile moral judgments no longer applicable to modern man. (Nietzsche was always keen to stress his modernity.) The Übermensch will also recognize that his value system belongs to his personal perspective since truth as such is an illusion. Hence the stress on action, on the deed itself, and hence also the stress on the decisive and masterful nature of the Higher Man, who questions the validity of scientific truths and recognizes the will to power as the key value of life. The joyful Higher Man of Thus Spoke Zarathustra is invited to laugh and dance when he understands these strictures. Stepping away from the herd and rejecting the complacency of the Last Man, he forms the raw material for the future emergence of the Übermensch. In the works written after Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche elaborated on his theories of morality. For him, morality as such had become defunct. In an age in which science pretended to have solutions to problems, even moral problems, since it purported to provide “the truth,” Nietzsche obstinately posed the question why we need a morality at all and challenged the notion that there can ever be an absolute truth. Truth will always depend, to a certain degree, on the perspective of the observer. By the same token, we can never have absolute certainty since knowledge, too, depends on relative perspectives and acts as a brake on activity. Instead of merely echoing the Delphic oracle, “man, know thyself,” Nietzsche places the emphasis on activity and advises, “Become who you are.” Self-knowledge is an essential prerequisite in this act of becoming. Beyond Good and Evil (1886) provided a new sobriety for Nietzsche after the enraptured heights of Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Many of his established themes, such as the dichotomy between appearance and reality, as well as his new theory of the will to power, are taken up again at a different level. He firmly believed that Europe had reached a state of cultural crisis, much exacerbated by such manifestations as democracy and nascent feminism. It has been suggested that Nietzsche’s antifemi-\n\nxviii •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nnist remarks in this work are simply a deliberate, masked challenge to provoke debate, and, indeed, the statement on the relativism of truth with which the preface of Beyond Good and Evil begins—“Supposing truth to be a woman . . .”—has become a virtual mantra for adherents of the “New Nietzsche.” Are we to take this to mean that truth is as unreliable as woman or that the meaning is deeply hidden? The theory of deconstruction put forward by Jacques Derrida makes much of the strategic, marginal positions that can tease out meanings from behind a veil or mask. This is not the place to discuss the political correctness of a theory that equates the fluidity of “truth” with the elusiveness of “woman.” Suffice it to say that given Nietzsche’s general point that truth is unreliable and his warning that he is simply stating “my truths” about “woman as such” (BGE, VII: 231), it is remarkable both that his tone should be so dogmatic and that deconstructionists should have made so much of his riddle. It is clear that in Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche felt a missionary zeal to warn people against blind acceptance of concepts such as “good” and “evil,” as they are based on outdated values originally introduced by the ruling group. Using the example of cruelty, Nietzsche points out that we are superficially horrified at the idea, but he then demonstrates how “even the man of knowledge” is constantly (if unconsciously) cruel to himself “—by saying No, that is, when he would like to affirm” (BGE, VII: 229), every time he compels his “spirit of knowledge” to run counter to his natural inclination. Sigmund Freud would later develop these ideas into psychoanalytical theories (sublimation, masochism, and so on), quite independently of Nietzsche thought. In his next work, On the Genealogy of Morality (1887), arguably his greatest and certainly the most systematic of all his works, Nietzsche provides his explanation of how man came to internalize warped values and accept them as relevant to him. He does this by tracing the descent of value judgments insofar as they are bound up with morality, which is a good deal of the time. Any idea that forces others to consider the weak or vulnerable in an altruistic way is fair game for Nietzsche’s contempt. Aptly subtitled A Polemic, On the Genealogy of Morality proceeds with such ferocity that Nietzsche has little time for complicated asides on historicism, feminism, nationalism, or other pestilential agents weakening German culture. The burden of his complaint is that Judeo-Christianity has encouraged a slave morality to replace the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xix\n\nmaster morality that superseded it, in which aristocratic values and the pathos of distance dictated the moral code. Thus, Nietzsche holds that the strong “blond beast at the centre of every noble race” is preferable to the “teeming mass of worms” that is today’s “tame man” (OGM, I: 26). Forcing us to consider the virtue of power and the weakness of conformity, Nietzsche presses on with his polemic until nothing short of the value of values is under attack. There are things that set us apart from the animals, such as the right to make promises, which ought to be part of our value system. Instead, suffering is glorified, and natural pleasures are pronounced sinful. Throughout On the Genealogy of Morality, Nietzsche’s dislike of the fawning ressentiment inculcated by Christianity explodes in vitriolic forays against the ascetic priest, who has taught man to hate his own body and to mistrust his instincts. Only man can free himself by “killing” God. Then and only then will he be free to make his own morality. The anxiety engendered by this freedom was destined to become the central insight informing existentialism, though in the hands of Jean-Paul Sartre the connection with Nietzsche’s thought became blurred through Sartre’s adoption of a left-wing political stance that would have been anathema to Nietzsche. Furthermore, Nietzsche’s blithe pronouncement that we can construct our own morality, coupled with his overt support for master morality, made him a hostage beyond the grave to National Socialist ideologues. Of course, the latter were more concerned to bury the individualistic Übermensch than praise his visionary creator. Nietzsche’s attacks on Christianity continue in his last works, Twilight of the Idols (1889) and The Antichrist (1895), where the tone is so rebarbative that some critics have suggested that Nietzsche was already of unsound mind when writing these and the other four short books he worked on in 1888: The Case of Wagner, Nietzsche contra Wagner, Dithyrambs of Dionysus, and Ecce Homo. Richard Wagner had died in 1883, but in The Case of Wagner, Nietzsche not only declares him sick but also holds him responsible for the cultural sickness in Europe. What is clear is that he could not let go of the Wagners. In Nietzsche Contra Wagner, the familiar message that Wagner is decadent is more measured, indeed lyrical, in tone, while in the Dithyrambs of Dionysus, Nietzsche has Cosima Wagner in mind when he alters a poem written earlier, “Ariadne’s Complaint.” In Ecce Homo, Nietzsche is game-\n\nxx •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nkeeper turned poacher in the sense that he provides a critique of all his published works, as well as repeating many ideas in the works already discussed here. The date of publication of the last three works became problematic when Nietzsche suddenly became insane. The Dithyrambs of Dionysus appeared in print in 1891. The Anti-Christ was published in 1895, just at the point when Nietzsche’s reputation as a philosopher had begun to flourish (a phenomenon his sister was keen to exploit in publishing the manuscript of The Anti-Christ, though Franziska Nietzsche would have preferred to burn it). In contrast to the fate of The Anti-Christ, Nietzsche had been able to supervise the publication of Twilight of the Idols in person, but Ecce Homo would not be published until 1908. At one level, Twilight of the Idols is a romp through Nietzsche’s pet aversions, constituting the people and ideas he most dislikes. A salient feature of this work is its pace: Nietzsche does not tarry to describe how morality has come about but proceeds to deal what he hopes will be knockout blows to established idols who have founded morality, from Socrates through Kant to the denizens of contemporary Germany, where even skeptics fall back on the ingrained but degenerate principles of Christianity. At another level, Nietzsche tests his readers to the full by representing seemingly contrary positions, for example, on the nature of happiness: “Man does not strive after happiness; only the Englishman does that” (TI, “Maxims and Arrows,” 12). Here, Nietzsche seeks to establish that happiness is not something that can reward belief, as Utilitarianism, redolent with Christian morality, purports, but a natural and original state. The pursuit of happiness has the contrary effect of blemishing man’s natural state. Nietzsche deliberately delayed publication of The Anti-Christ, although it was completed by the fall of 1888, in order for it to have a greater effect when published. Here, we find further proof of Nietzsche’s disgust at man’s capacity for décadence: a weakened state brought on by a slavish addiction to Christian morality even in the absence of a belief in God (or Christ). In The Anti-Christ, Nietzsche decides there are so many versions of Christianity that he will take us back to basics: “The word ‘Christianity’ is already a misunderstanding—in reality there has only been one Christian, and he died on the cross” (AC: 39). Nietzsche stresses that Jesus was a Jew; indeed, his analysis of the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxi\n\norigins of Christianity as a Jewish phenomenon is a central theme in The Anti-Christ. What is surprising is his tone of admiration; Nietzsche has plenty of time for Christ but none for Christianity, the reason for that being the monopoly gained by the ascetic priest. All six late works of Nietzsche’s last year of sanity betray his inflated sense of selfimportance, much mitigated by a style of delivery that is frequently so bombastic as to be pungently funny. As R. J. Hollingdale has pointed out, “The philosopher has not lost his grip on his material, he has tightened it; the notion that there is some defect of intelligence in these last works, that they contain ‘nonsense,’ is quite false” (R. J. Hollingdale, Nietzsche: The Man and His Philosophy, 1999). It should be mentioned that although Nietzsche declared at the close of On the Genealogy of Morality that he was busy planning a book, “The Will to Power: Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values” (OGM, III: 27), he never wrote such a work. The text compiled by his sister contains a fund of material from Nietzsche’s notebooks that expands on the themes outlined here; the problem is that Nietzsche himself did not see the work into print; indeed, he actually crossed out scores of passages that have subsequently found their way into print and are taken by the unsuspecting reader to be bona fide “text.” Such considerations invalidate the very idea that there can be a definitive text of The Will to Power. Readers should consult the bibliographical note on The Will to Power at the end of section 1 of the bibliography. However attractive the call for the self-mastery and self-creativity of the Übermensch sounds now—and did sound for each branch of international Nietzscheanism discussed later—we should note that Nietzsche had no scruples about the legitimacy of power as executed by the “born organizers” or species of “blond beast” who represented master morality, the antidote to slave morality (OGM: II, 17). Such pronouncements provided an open invitation for fascists in general and for Adolf Hitler and the ideologues of National Socialism in particular to co-opt Nietzsche’s theory of power for their own agenda. More recent interpretations have leaned toward Nietzsche’s general critique of modernity as a fruitful source of inspiration, agreeing with him that the nihilism of modernism is hollow and meaningless unless new values can be found and acted on. The current trend to stress Nietzsche’s approval of naturalism and to put the body center stage is a case in point.\n\nxxii •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNIETZSCHEANISM IN GERMANY Apart from the scurrilous attack from Ulrich von WilamowitzMöllendorff occasioned by the publication of The Birth of Tragedy in 1872, the reception of Nietzsche’s works during his most productive years was characteristically lukewarm. As Nietzsche himself commented shortly before his mental collapse in 1889, he had appreciative readers only abroad (he was thinking in particular of Georg Brandes and August Strindberg). All this would soon change, so that by the mid-1890s Nietzsche’s name was becoming familiar in literary and artistic circles. Among philosophers, however, he was frowned on for his lack of a system: indeed, many university departments of philosophy regard Nietzsche as something of an upstart even today. Since Nietzsche deliberately eschewed systems and thought with his pen, a chronological account of his works simultaneously provides a description of the development of his ideas. As Hollingdale has stated, “Nietzsche’s philosophy is not a series of conclusions but essentially a developing body of thought.” Hollingdale further comments on the necessity of bearing the chronological order of Nietzsche’s works in mind with regard to the development of his style, a feature of his work that can be said to underpin literary postmodernism, now on the decline in favor of a “natural” Nietzsche whose interest in natural science has until recently been neglected. Nietzsche’s ideas would have taken root even without his sister’s efforts. Georg Brandes has traditionally been seen as the initiator of Nietzscheanism in Germany with the publication of his article Radikaler Aristokratismus in 1890, but there were even earlier reactions to Nietzsche’s works: 10 reviews of Beyond Good and Evil appeared between September 1886 and December 1887, more than for any of Nietzsche’s other works at that time. Hermann Conradi encountered Nietzsche’s ideas as a student in Leipzig; his novel Phrasen, in which the protagonist speaks of “we Nietzscheans,” appeared in 1887. In 1888, Carl Spitteler made an early attempt to provide a brief (two-page) overview of all Nietzsche’s work published to date in a piece for the first issue of Der Bund. By 1888, Carl and Gerhart Hauptmann were early if unappreciative readers of Nietzsche. Ola Hansson and Leo Berg, both fervent Nietzscheans who regarded themselves as pioneers (which they were), wrote appreciations of Twilight of the Idols when it appeared in January 1889, just after Nietzsche’s collapse in Turin.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxiii\n\nThus, when Brandes’s famous review appeared in 1890, there were already a host of Nietzschean enthusiasts in Germany: Detlev von Liliencron, Rudolf Steiner, Arno Holz (though not his cofounder of the Naturalist Movement, Johannes Schlaf, who disapproved of Nietzsche), Julius Langbehn, and Max Halbe. Within four years, the ranks had swelled to include Frank Wedekind, Max Dauthendey, Gabriele Reuter, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Kurt Eisner, Bruno Wille, Stanislaus Przybyszewski, Maximilian Harden, Emil Gött, and Ricarda Huch, though Huch subsequently denied that Nietzsche’s influence on her had been strong. Nietzsche was a central topic in the cluster round the sensuous poet Richard Dehmel, and he was also discussed in the circle around the composer Conrad Ansorge in Weimar 1894–1897. Later, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche did her best to make her Saturday salon the intellectual center for Nietzsche debate in Weimar. Nietzsche had plenty of detractors, too, including Paul Ernst, Hermann Sudermann, Eduard von Hartmann, Wilhelm Bölsche, Franz Mehring, and Hermann Bahr. From 1890 on, Nietzsche entered into mainstream German culture, in spite of the vicious attack on Nietzsche’s thought in Max Nordau’s Entartung, 1893 (Degeneration, 1895). This work severely hampered Nietzscheanism, though only temporarily, since there soon appeared a wealth of reviews of Nietzsche’s works, his sister having begun to publish the first volumes of a collected edition from 1892 under the editorship of Peter Gast. In 1894, Gast was sacked in favor of Fritz Koegel, who took over the editorship of what would become known as the Grossoktavausgabe in 1894. In the same year appeared Lou AndreasSalomé’s quirkily psychological reading of Nietzsche “in his works,” Friedrich Nietzsche in seinen Werken (1894). The reviewers now started to take the secondary works into account: Bölsche welcomed Salomé’s interpretation, whereas Fritz Koegel found it a “dangerous book” that sought to sensationalize biographical details in order to invalidate Nietzsche’s philosophy through “neurotic female psychology.” Heinrich Romundt then sprang to Salomé’s defense. From the first, Nietzsche’s enemies showed a high degree of Schadenfreude by dismissing his writings as the work of a madman: in 1891, Hermann Türck in Friedrich Nietzsche und seine pathologischen Irrwege (Friedrich Nietzsche and His Pathologically Wrong Paths) wrote about Nietzsche’s warped moral strictures as a reflection of his perverted instinct.\n\nxxiv •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDuring the mid-1890s, Nietzschean themes became commonplace in German literature, as in the novel In purpurner Finsterniß (In Purple Darkness, 1895) by Michael Georg Conrad and the play Sozialaristokraten (1896) by Arno Holz; one should also mention Leo Berg’s critical work Der Übermensch in der modernen Literatur (1897), which draws on works from European literature such as August Strindberg’s I Havsbandet, 1890 (By the Open Sea, 1984) as well as from the German Naturalist Movement. Nietzsche also influenced the worlds of art and music: Gustav Mahler was so enthralled by Nietzsche’s ideas that he almost called his Third Symphony (1896) “The Gay Science” (Die fröhliche Wissenschaft), while that same year Richard Strauss conducted the first performance of his composition Also sprach Zarathustra. Julius Langbehn, author of the hugely successful nationalistic Rembrandt als Erzieher (Rembrandt as Educator, 1890), which was written before his encounter with Nietzsche’s thought, was so struck by Nietzsche’s predicament that in 1889 he actually made an ill-judged and unsuccessful bid to “adopt” Nietzsche, to try to cure him. It should be said that in artistic communities such as Worpswede near Bremen, Langbehn exerted as strong an influence as that of Nietzsche; indeed, Nietzsche’s influence was seldom unadulterated, especially after the turn of the century, when the ideas of Sigmund Freud became current. Likewise, the Hart brothers in Berlin used Nietzschean concepts selectively when it suited their notion of a new mysticism as propounded in Der neue Gott (1899) by Julius Hart. Hart’s liberal circle in Berlin at the turn of the century attracted a variety of left-wing intellectuals such as Gustav Landauer, who took issue with Hart over his criticism of Nietzsche in Der neue Gott, rightly pointing out the debt Hart owed to Nietzsche. Nothing better illustrates the divided nature of Nietzsche reception than two works published in 1899. Arthur Moeller van den Bruck’s Tschandala Nietzsche (1899) was a brief appreciation of Nietzsche’s thought, with special reference to the poetic tone of Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Here, Nietzsche is hailed as the first to see the direction of European culture with “visionary clarity.” Otto Henne am Rhyn’s scathing polemic Anti-Zarathustra appeared in the same year. This examined Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, On the Genealogy of Morality, and Twilight of the Idols. Thus Spoke Zarathustra is damned as full of “trivialities, blasphemies, vulgarities and ambiguities as well as untruths, false assertions, displacements\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxv\n\n(Entstellungen) of historical facts and meaningless utterances.” Critics of Nietzsche at this time were particularly inclined to dismiss eternal return. Around the turn of the century, the ranks of confirmed Nietzscheans included Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, Martin Buber, Paul Heyse, Christian Morgenstern, Georg Simmel, Carl Gustav Jung, Robert Musil, Hermann Hesse, and Rainer Maria Rilke as well as Karl Kraus, Margarete Susman, Emil Ludwig, Albert Schweitzer, and Max Brod, though not all remained under Nietzsche’s spell: Morgenstern, for example, went over to Steiner’s theosophy. The members of the fin de siècle artistic intelligentsia who were most eager to claim Nietzsche as progenitor were die Kosmiker (“the cosmics”), writers and dilettantes who grouped themselves around the poet Stefan George between 1897 and 1904 and included Karl Wolfskehl, Ludwig Klages, Alfred Schuler, Ernst Bertram, and Franziska zu Reventlow. Die Kosmiker claimed Nietzsche as their central source of inspiration, though Klages and Schuler in particular sought to develop a Dionysian ethic along the lines they thought they detected in Bachofen’s Das Mutterrecht (Mother Right, 1861). The work suggests that “mother right” must have preceded patriarchy during a period when orgiastic pagan rites were presided over by women. (The painter and dramatist Oskar Kokoschka also paid more attention to Bachofen than Nietzsche.) Rudolf Pannwitz, who existed on the fringe of the George circle, saw Nietzsche’s Übermensch as “cosmic man,” by which he meant the mythical summation of man in religious terms and the apotheosis of the German in nationalistic terms, while Klages went on to develop his theory of Lebensphilosophie in the light of Nietzsche’s philosophy. Bertram’s Nietzsche. Versuch einer Mythologie (Nietzsche: Attempt at a Mythology, 1918) became a key work in Nietzsche interpretation, placing Nietzsche firmly within a tradition of völkisch right-wing German ideology. A strong Nietzschean current could be detected in the journals Die Zukunft, Jugend, Die freie Bühne, Neue deutsche Rundschau, Das Magazin für Litteratur, Die Insel, and Pan. In the latter, the illustrations of Hugo Hoeppener (Fidus) were characteristically Zarathustran as, for example, the illustration for “Before Sunrise,” a beautifully atmospheric section in part 3. Fidus depicts figures reaching out to the sun, though these same figures often expressed a freedom through nudity that was\n\nxxvi •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nmore a fashion than it was Nietzschean. The monthly journal Charon, published from 1904 to 1914 by Otto zur Linde and (until 1906) Rudolf Pannwitz, attracted poets with a mystical tendency such as Dauthendey and Morgenstern, while the illustrated weekly Jugend attracted literary criticism from Nietzsche fanatics such as Dehmel. The influence of Nietzsche, especially his call for the liberation of the instincts, continued to be present in the focal periodical of German expressionism, Der Sturm, founded in 1910 by Herwarth Walden. The illustrations in Der Sturm, such as those of Ludwig Kirchner and Emil Nolde from the groups known as Die Brücke and Der blaue Reiter, reflect the growing fascination for Nietzschean-inspired hedonistic dance. If the music of Arnold Schönberg and his pupil Alban Berg definitively broke away from Wagner under the influence of Nietzsche, a generation of young poets such as Georg Heym and Georg Trakl were likewise inspired by Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra to write a new form of poetry, molding the German language into pleonasms and pruning it for shock effect. Although the most prominent expressionist poet, Gottfried Benn, survived both world wars, many other expressionist poets, such as Alfred Lichtenstein, were killed in World War I; subsequently, drama rather than poetry became the preferred genre of expressionism. Although the new wave of expressionist dramatists such as Frank Wedekind and Georg Kaiser continued to pay homage to both Nietzsche and Freud, by the early 1920s, the influence of Karl Marx was also a factor, as in the dramatic work of Ernst Toller. Franz Kafka’s nightmare world depicts the kind of moral jungle where the figure of authority—alias the ascetic priest—crushes the individual. Nietzsche’s invitation to visionary creation is perhaps at its most extreme in the work of the architect Bruno Taut, who had a postwar missionary zeal to renew mankind through architecture. Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche’s good name is tarnished through her collaboration with the National Socialists in the early 1930s; nevertheless, she must be given due credit for her single-minded energy and determination in establishing the Nietzsche-Archiv in Weimar, even though, as Rudolf Steiner observed after he had given her a series of tutorials on Nietzsche’s philosophy in 1896, she was just about the last person to be able to understand the subtleties of her brother’s thought. Nevertheless, her pioneering work in writing Nietzsche’s biography (Das Leben Friedrich Nietzsches, I: 1895, IIi: 1897, IIii: 1904), which\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxvii\n\ndrew attention to Nietzsche, should be recognized. Largely because of the success of this biography, early Nietzscheanism in Germany in the mid-1890s was characterized by an interest in Nietzsche the man as well as the philosopher; by the turn of the century, when Thus Spoke Zarathustra had become a pathbreaking book for the avant-garde, it was common for the names of Nietzsche and Zarathustra to be regarded as interchangeable. By this time, Nietzsche’s impact on early modernism was immense. While a sick Nietzsche languished in Naumburg, a steady stream of admirers found their way to the town, Rudolf Steiner and the novelist Gabriele Reuter among them. Harry Graf Kessler, who became a staunch supporter of the Nietzsche-Archiv, visited Elisabeth in Naumburg in 1895, and the visits became almost a stampede when Elisabeth moved to Weimar in 1897. Henri Lichtenberger was just one of the crowd who visited Elisabeth in Weimar in 1898. Thus, the first few years of the new century were Elisabeth’s belle epoque, in spite of (or possibly because of) the death of Nietzsche in 1900. The following year, Henry van de Velde came to Weimar and was enlisted by Elisabeth to refurbish the Nietzsche-Archiv. Other visitors included André Gide in 1903 and Ernst Thiel in 1905. Thiel would become a vital financial backer. Without his help, Elisabeth would not have gained permission from the Grand Duchy of Sachsen-Weimar for the foundation of the Stiftung Nietzsche-Archiv in May 1908. Nietzsche’s works sold well in the years before the war as well as during and immediately after the war, but it is not true that every soldier was issued with a copy of Thus Spoke Zarathustra in his rucksack, though it is true that cheap copies were available. From the first, unscrupulous writers like Julius Langbehn and Paul Lagarde had linked Nietzsche’s name with nationalism for their own agenda. During and after World War I, his name was energetically co-opted into the nationalist cause by Elisabeth, but she was by no means alone; Oswald Spengler, who visited the Nietzsche-Archiv in Weimar for the first time in July 1920, praised Nietzsche’s spirit as typically German, something that would help Germany (at that time bruisingly defeated) to win through in the end. His comments in Der Untergang des Abendlandes (I: 1918, II: 1923) (The Decline of the West, 1934) marked the acceleration of the coupling of Nietzsche’s name with that of the German Volk, a coupling Nietzsche himself would have resisted.\n\nxxviii •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNietzsche prided himself on being a good European and was often disgusted by German chauvinism. This did not deter Elisabeth from collaborating with the fascists both out of financial expediency and conviction. Although she admired Benito Mussolini more than Adolf Hitler, Elisabeth gratefully accepted the logistic help offered by the National Socialists; Hitler even helped her from his private purse. The symbiotic relationship ensured that Elisabeth felt important and flattered, and the National Socialists made propaganda by claiming Nietzsche as a protofascist. It was also good publicity for Hitler to be photographed beside an endearing little old lady who, though she was childless, seemed to represent German motherhood, casting Hitler as dutiful son. When she died in 1935, the whole administration of the Nietzsche-Archiv, headed by Max Oehler, was firmly in support of the Third Reich. Hitler and a host of party dignitaries attended Elisabeth’s funeral. The chief National Socialist Nietzschean was Alfred Baeumler, whose principal work on Nietzsche was Nietzsche, der Philosoph und Politiker (1931). Alfred Rosenberg enlisted Nietzsche as a protofascist in his iconic Der Mythos des Zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts (The Myth of the Twentieth Century, 1930), a work second only to Hitler’s Mein Kampf (1925–1927) as iconic Nazi text. Heinrich Haertle in Nietzsche und der Nationalsozialismus (1937) argued that Nietzsche hated the Jews, but not all National Socialists wanted to claim Nietzsche as one of their own. The principal interpreter of Nietzsche at that time was the right-wing philosopher Martin Heidegger, whose existentialist critique inspired important rejoinders from Karl Jaspers and Karl Löwith. If Heidegger stood to the right in German politics, there was a group of philosophers who stood very much to the left and who gravitated toward the Marxist Max Horkheimer, a philosopher in Frankfurt, to the extent that they are now referred to as the Frankfurt School, even though most of them were obliged to emigrate to America during the 1930s. The Frankfurt School contained a number of radical Nietzscheans, notably Theodor Adorno, Ernst Bloch, and Herbert Marcuse. Walter Benjamin kept himself at a respectful distance from this debate, though he had fallen under Nietzsche’s spell when, as a young man, he visited Nietzsche in Sils Maria. The Marxist critic Georg Lukács was, however, virulently opposed to Nietzsche’s influence, which he viewed as a factor in the fascination of Germans for fascism. He makes this argument in Die Zerstörung der Vernunft, 1954 (The Destruction of Reason, 1981).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxix\n\nConservative thinkers such as Jürgen Habermas criticized the views of the Frankfurt School and queried Lukács’ dogmatic approach. Jörg Salaquarda, Wolfgang Müller-Lauter, and Volker Gerhart have been the most prominent recent German-speaking Nietzsche scholars.\n\nNIETZSCHEANISM IN FRANCE Nietzsche’s enthusiasm for French culture expressed itself in his desire for a French readership; he was overjoyed that Hippolyte Taine had become interested in his work (or such was the construction he placed on the notes of acknowledgment Taine sent to him in 1888 in gratitude for the four complimentary copies of Nietzsche’s works he had received). Gabriel Monod, who knew Nietzsche personally (Monod had married Malwida von Meysenbug’s adoptive daughter, Olga Herzen), made attempts to awaken interest in Nietzsche in France during the early 1890s, but at that time, the only text in French translation was the third Untimely Meditation, “Richard Wagner à Bayreuth,” translated by Marie Baumgartner while Nietzsche was still in Basel and published in 1877. Jean Bourdeau was the first to write an article on Nietzsche in French in 1888. In spite of the publication of articles and translated extracts in various journals, notably the Mercure de France, Nietzsche was not widely read until the turn of the century, though he already had a devoted following among enthusiasts, including André Gide, who could read German. Henri Lichtenberger’s monograph of Nietzsche, La Philosophie de Nietzsche, which had appeared in 1898 and was the result of a series of public lectures given at the University of Nancy, soon became vital for the dissemination of Nietzsche’s ideas in France among academics, writers, and literary and political critics. At the same time, translations of Nietzsche’s works started to appear: Henri Albert’s translation of Ainsi parlait Zarathoustra was published in 1898. Par delà le Bien et le Mal (translated by L. Weiscopf and G. Art) appeared in the same year. In 1899, there followed another publication by Albert containing, in one volume, his translation of Le Crépuscule des Idoles and Nietzsche contra Wagner as well as Le Cas Wagner (already translated by Daniel Halévy and Robert Dreyfus in 1892) and L’ Antichrist. Aphorismes et Fragments, translated by Henri Lichtenberger. Also in 1899 appeared A.-M. Desrousseaux’s translation of\n\nxxx •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHumain, trop humain (Le Voyageur et son Ombre, translated by Henri Albert, appeared in 1902). Henri Albert’s translation of the Généalogie de la Morale appeared in 1900 and the following year Le Gai Savoir and Aurore. However, the most significant text to appear in translation, for many French Nietzscheans, was L’Origine de la Tragédie (1901), translated by J. Marnold and J. Morland. By 1901, when Der Wille zur Macht appeared in Germany, the French “Nietzschéens” had practically caught up with the Germans, and, indeed, a translation of La Volonté de Puissance duly appeared in 1903, translated by the indefatigable Henri Albert. As in Germany, it was common for Nietzsche’s name to be linked with that of Max Stirner. Henri Albert contributed translations of Stirner to the Mercure de France, and in 1904, Albert Lévy brought out his study Stirner et Nietzsche. In general, Nietzsche appealed to the left-wing writers and thinkers in France: Albert and Halévy were socialists, and Desrousseaux was politically active as a socialist deputy. There were also right-wing French Nietzscheans from the very beginning as well, such as the leading members of the nationalistic Action française movement, and later in the person of Drieu la Rochelle. Charles Maurras, the leader of Action française who cultivated his own brand of paganism, was encouraged to read Nietzsche by Pierre Lasserre and Hugues Rebell. The latter was one of the earliest appreciators of Nietzsche in France, publishing an article on the plans for a collection of translations of Nietzsche into French in the Mercure de France as early as 1885. Maurras found in Nietzsche much to counteract the decadence that his nationalistic movement sought to overturn. Lasserre’s 1902 publication La Morale de Nietzsche was in general well received; he had already published an article, “Nietzsche et l’Anarchisme,” in the first volume of the periodical Action française in 1900. Both Rebell and Lasserre were bowled over by their first contact with Nietzsche, while Maurras had to overcome initial reservations. Young hotheads like Paul Valéry needed no second invitation (though he later distanced himself from Nietzsche’s thought). Initially a prose writer, Valéry did not establish himself as a poet until he was in his forties. Although Nietzsche’s attack on Christianity was his chief asset or main stumbling block, depending on the point of view of the writer or critic, his work was treated with caution by established philosophers. Only Jules de Gaultier in De Kant à Nietzsche (1900) and Eugène de\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxi\n\nRoberty in Frédéric Nietzsche (1902) were prepared to take Nietzsche’s philosophy seriously. Both put their own interpretation on Nietzsche’s work, with Gaultier judging Nietzsche’s thought to be a continuation of that of Immanuel Kant and Roberty hailing it as “a sumptuous social philosophy,” as though Nietzsche had intended his elitist ideas, which are, one must remember, directed primarily at the strong individual, to bring about a sociological revolution. It is understandable that socialist critics of Nietzsche should find his comments on aristocratic values a challenge to their interpretations. They were inclined to see Nietzschean elitism as a metaphor for the inner man, a standpoint they could glean from Thus Spoke Zarathustra rather than from On the Genealogy of Morality. Lichtenberger had set the tone for Nietzsche in La Philosophie de Nietzsche by stressing the importance of Nietzsche the man, and, indeed, he advised readers in his introduction to approach Nietzsche’s work as “a confession . . . as a sort of intimate diary.” Lichtenberger’s study was followed by numerous analytic works on Nietzsche in French, most notably Daniel Halévy’s biography La Vie de Fréderic Nietzsche in 1909 (the same year that Albert’s translation of Ecce Homo appeared). Nearly all praised Nietzsche’s theory of the superman and his bold attempt to revalue values; an exception was V. de Pallarès’s Le Crépuscule d’une Idole. Nietzsche, Nietzschéisme, Nietzschéens (1910), a work in which he attacked Nietzsche and his “disciples,” though he refused to give names, in spite of the title of the book. Nevertheless, the argument suggests hostility to the work of men such as Georges Sorel, whose Réflexions sur la Violence, written in 1907, had become something of an international cult book. Sorel viewed “the Yankees” as the new supermen in the realm of commerce and industry and thought the antidote to their power would be to verse the masses in organized violence. Sorel tended to appeal to extremists of any stamp: to the extreme right in France (Action française) as well as to the extreme left (communism). Pallarès is scathing about “les surhommes,” whom he saw as “essentiellement volonté de puissance” with, so to speak, war in their blood. In the literature of the French avant-garde, the influence of Nietzsche was already manifest in the absurdist plays of Alfred Jarry, notably Ubu Roi (1898). Members of the avant-garde such as Jarry and later Dadaists like Guillaume Apollinaire were receptive to Nietzsche’s iconoclasm, though as the century progressed, the influence of Sigmund Freud\n\nxxxii •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwould subsequently coincide with the emergence of cubism, inspiring artistic manifestations in surreal art that owe more to Freud than to Nietzsche. The surrealists included André Breton, Louis Aragon, Luis Buñuel, Salvador Dali, and originally Georges Bataille. Nietzsche’s influence continued to be felt in the work of modernist writers such as Jean Cocteau and Antonin Artaud. The split amongst the surrealists over which direction the movement should take led to the founding of Breton’s Association and Bataille’s La Critique Sociale. With Nietzscheanism “in the air” in France from the turn of the century on, there can be scarcely a writer or artist who remained completely outside the realm of his influence, though not all were as selfconsciously (or distortedly) Nietzschean as Daniel Lesueur (pseudonym for Jeanne Lapauze-Loiseau) in her Nietzschéenne (1908) or Mme Anne de Nouailles in, for example, her La nouvelle Espérance (1903). La Comtesse de Nouailles was particularly taken by Nietzsche’s appreciation of Greek aesthetics, especially all that was Dionysian. Nietzschean slogans like “courage,” “energy,” and “life” abound in her stories alongside wholly un-Nietzschean scenes of torrid passion. Paul Adam spiced his Le Serpent noir (1905) with Nietzschean allusions. A generation of writers who were adolescents in these years, including Alain Fournier and Jacques Rivière, were exposed to the climate of Nietzscheanism. A fuller list of French writers influenced by Nietzsche in the 20th century would include writers and thinkers such as Jean Giraudoux, François Mauriac, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Gaston Bachelard, Drieu la Rochelle, Hans Wahl, Gabriel Marcel, André Malraux, and Georges Bataille, though there was wide divergence in the extent to which they were prepared to acknowledge their debt. As with the essayists, sociologists, and thinkers, their political stance varied greatly. A radical lessening of interest in Nietzsche occurred as a result of World War I. As in Britain, Nietzsche was held partly responsible for the outbreak of hostilities. Julien Benda in La Trahison des Clercs (1927) held Nietzsche, together with Henri Bergson and Georges Sorel, responsible for the culture of belligerence that had made World War I inevitable. Others made attempts to reestablish Nietzsche’s reputation in France, notably Geneviève Bianquis (Nietzsche en France, 1929), but the name of one Nietzschean stands out: that of Charles Andler, who wrote a variety of works on Nietzsche before his definitive biography, Nietzsche. Sa vie et sa pensée (1920–1931). Andler’s left-wing stance\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxiii\n\nwent as far as to see in Nietzsche’s thought a socialism that envisaged the emergence of the working class of Europe as a class of masters. Another work that dealt with an aspect of Nietzsche’s biography—his sojourns in Italy, especially in relation to Wagner—is Nietzsche en Italie (1929) by the Wagner enthusiast Guy de Pourtalès. The work of Bernard Groethysen, especially his Introduction à la philosophie allemande depuis Nietzsche (1926), acted as intermediary between the German and French ways of thought. Groethysen, who had studied under Wilhelm Dilthey, introduced the French to a new variant of vitalist thought that rejected scientific facts and paved the way for an anti-intellectualism among the French philosophical establishment that would have farreaching consequences. During the 1930s, the shift that occurred in philosophy from the theory of knowledge toward protoexistentialism meant that Nietzsche’s reputation remained relatively unscathed in France, even though it was clear that the National Socialists were hijacking his philosophy for their own purposes. French commentators felt they had acquitted themselves well if they simply voiced disapproval of such tactics. The work of Andler and that of his “disciple” Bianquis was crucial in maintaining Nietzsche’s reputation untarnished. In 1937, Georges Bataille argued, in Acéphale, that Nietzsche was a sovereign thinker whose hostility to pan-German militarism guaranteed that he would have been hostile to the National Socialists. Two other notable French works of criticism that denied the link between Nietzsche’s thought and Nazism were De Nietzsche à Hitler by Marius P. Nicolas (1936) and Nietzsche by the Marxist Henri Lefebvre (1939). Nietzscheanism in France fluctuated with the reception of Bergsonism during the two decades 1930–1950. Although Bergson’s philosophy seemed to offer much that would suit the trend away from intellectualism in France, if one considers his insistence on lived experience coupled with intuition within a moral context, interest in his Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion (1932) was swiftly (if temporarily) superseded by renewed interest in Nietzsche among writers, if not academic philosophers, in the wake of Karl Jaspers’s immensely influential interpretation of Nietzsche. Hans Wahl, a professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne, cautiously taught his students an appreciation of Nietzsche through a study of Jaspers’s text. Possible rivals in terms of irrational philosophy, such as Martin Heidegger and Max Scheler,\n\nxxxiv •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nremained little known in France during the 1930s, but there was a strong revival in interest in Nietzsche as a forerunner of existentialism during the 1940s, when Albert Camus, André Malraux, and Jean-Paul Sartre (albeit though the prism of André Gide) looked beyond Jaspers and his praise of Søren Kierkegaard to the source of the essential starting point for existentialism, the death of God: and that source was Nietzsche. Sartre had his own agenda to pursue, which would evolve an ethic of authenticity in which Nietzschean ideas on individualism are displaced. Writers such as Maurice Blanchot, Georges Bataille, and Pierre Klossowski maintained interest in Nietzsche during the 1940s, while Geneviève Bianquis founded the Societé française d’études nietzschéennes in 1946, with its own Bulletin as companion publication. This was expanded to the Études nietzschéennes, which first appeared in 1948, but this appears to have become defunct, so that a new Bulletin de la Societé d’Études Nietzschéennes makes its appearance in 1959 and in a “new series” in 1961. Throughout the 1950s, Nietzsche continued to be largely ignored by philosophy departments in French universities, where the professors were more interested in teaching Henri Bergson and Edmund Husserl than Nietzsche, in spite of the efforts of individuals such as Hans Wahl, who in the late 1950s held courses on Nietzsche. His Nietzsche. Introduction à sa philosophie appeared in 1950. In addition, Bataille’s notoriety made sure that Nietzsche’s name never sank into oblivion, and in 1966, Jean Granier’s substantial Le problème de la vérité dans la philosophie de Nietzsche appeared. It was precisely at that moment that a new generation of young philosophers and writers were undertaking research on Nietzsche, among them Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Serres. The event that renewed French passion for Nietzsche and that stands out as a landmark in European Nietzscheanism was the conference held in Royeaumont, near Paris, in 1964. A second conference of great consequence for Nietzsche studies was held in Cérisy-la-Salle in 1972. The proceedings of this conference were gathered into the substantial Nietzsche aujourd’hui (1973); the list of contributors provides a “Who’s Who” of the New Nietzsche, sometimes also referred to as the “French Nietzsche.” Besides Derrida and Foucault, the list includes Gilles Deleuze, Sarah Kofman, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Eric Blondel, and Jean-François Lyotard. By the end of the 20th century, the experimental\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxv\n\ntheories of “the French Nietzsche” had come to dominate Nietzsche scholarship not just in France but also in the English-speaking world, though not to the exclusion of other interpretations. Nevertheless, in France, the overwhelming pattern for at least two decades was for novelists and writers to be inspired by both deconstructive theories and by the postmodern ethos of the New Nietzsche; practitioners included Marguerite Duras and Michel Tournier, though the influence of Marx, Freud, and Jacques Lacan must be taken into account at all times. Lacan’s pupil Luce Irigaray has engaged with Nietzsche at the level of feminist psychoanalysis. In France, in particular, Nietzscheanism is seldom “unadulterated.” Current French Nietzsche scholars are looking to new fields, as in Laurent Cherlonneix’s aesthetic interpretation Nietzsche: santé et maladie, l’art (2003), and critiques of individual works have recently appeared, such as Isabelle Wienand’s Significations de la Mort de Dieu chez Nietzsche d “Humain, trop humain” à “Ainsi parlait Zarathoustra” (2006).\n\nNIETZSCHEANISM IN GREAT BRITAIN In Great Britain, Nietzsche was first mentioned by a woman, Mary Bright, alias George Egerton, who brought in Nietzsche’s name to support a claim for women to have sexual emancipation in her collection of short stories, Keynotes, published in 1893. The first writer to actually use Nietzsche’s ideas was the Scottish poet John Davidson in his Sentences and Paragraphs (1893), though it is likely that the poet George Moore, who was a neighbor and friend of Daniel Halévy during the late 1880s, had already heard about Nietzsche by the early 1890s. Halévy published on Nietzsche in French from 1892 on, though Moore did not use Nietzschean ideas in his work until Evelyn Innes (1898), where he paraphrases a passage from Nietzsche’s The Gay Science. Interest in what was, at the time, termed “Nietzscheism” strengthened with the publication of the first translations of Nietzsche’s works: in 1896, the publishing company Henry and Co brought out Thus spake Zarathustra. A Book for All and None, translated by Alexander Tille, and in the same year, in one volume, Thomas Common’s translations of The Case of Wagner, Nietzsche contra Wagner, Twilight of the Idols, and The Antichrist.\n\nxxxvi •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt is significant that the first English translation of Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation had appeared only a decade earlier, in 1886. Several writers, like George Gissing, owed more to Arthur Schopenhauer than to Nietzsche. Fisher-Unwin used the translations by Tille and Common as the material for volumes 2 and 3, respectively, of their ambitiously named project The Works of Friedrich Nietzsche, which appeared between 1899 and 1903. Volume 1 contained The Genealogy of Morals and a collection of poems, translated by William Hausmann and John Gray, and volume 4 consisted of Johanna Volz’s translation of The Dawn of Day. Helen Zimmern’s translation of Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future was printed by “The Good European Society” (i.e., Thomas Common) with Darien Press in Edinburgh in 1907 and was then incorporated (as volume 5) into Oscar Levy’s pathbreaking 18-volume edition The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche, which appeared from 1909 to 1913. This edition, published by T. N. Foulis and still the only complete edition of Nietzsche’s work in English, was instrumental in making the works of Nietzsche known throughout the English-speaking world, including countries of the empire such as Australia, where the writer William Baylebridge became a convinced Nietzschean. The previously mentioned translations, which were widely reviewed in such journals as The Savoy, started off a veritable Nietzsche craze in Britain, and by the turn of the century there were two journals openly sympathetic to Nietzscheanism: The Eagle and the Serpent, edited by Erwin McCall (1898–1902), and Notes for Good Europeans, edited by Thomas Common (1903–1909). Although Nietzsche was certainly not a household name in Britain at large, among the intelligentsia there was a renewed spate of interest in him from 1902 until the outbreak of World War I. Alfred Orage’s The New Age, established in 1907, was the only journal not to turn against Nietzsche in 1914. Articles on Nietzsche were especially fecund in The New Age from 1907 to 1910; most of the translators of Nietzsche contributed pieces, including James Kennedy, Anthony Ludovici, and Oscar Levy. Most of the previously mentioned went on to publish hagiographical works on Nietzsche if they had not already done so: Thomas Common’s Nietzsche as Critic, Philosopher and Poet: Choice Selections from His Works had appeared in 1901. Orage, who had brought out an appreciation of Nietzsche in 1906 with the title Friedrich Nietzsche: The Dionysian Spirit of the Age, published\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxvii\n\nNietzsche in Outline and Aphorism in 1907, and Kennedy published The Quintessence of Nietzsche in 1909, followed by Nietzsche: His Maxims of Life in 1913. In 1908, Maximilian Mügge’s Friedrich Nietzsche: His Life and Work appeared, and in 1909, Ludovici published Who Is to Be Master of the World? An Introduction to the Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, which was followed by Nietzsche: His Life and Works in 1910, Nietzsche and Art in 1911, and a translation of Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche’s The Young Nietzsche in 1912. The right-wing Ludovici clung to his extremist views until his death in 1971. In Great Britain, as in France, Nietzscheans were at first more prominent on the left than on the right, and distinctions also have to be made between critics and creative writers, since the latter often refused to acknowledge their debt to Nietzsche. Among the critical enthusiasts, the political spectrum went from the socialist Orage on the left to Kennedy on the far right. Among writers, a similar spectrum can be traced from George Bernard Shaw to D. H. Lawrence. A writer such as Wyndham Lewis was probably more influenced by Nietzsche than he admitted, though he set himself up as critic of “the execrable Neech.” James Joyce was probably not much influenced by Nietzscheanism, but a number of Fabians were, among them H. G. Wells, Rupert Brooke, Eric Gill, and Shaw, though the latter played down any direct debt, notwithstanding the Nietzschean title of his play Man and Superman (1903). Nietzsche’s impact was understood to be in the realm of morals and aesthetics rather than politics. The overriding appeal of the myth of the Übermensch remained the central point of interest for British Nietzscheans: it was not for nothing that Kennedy translated Lichtenberger’s La philosophie de Nietzsche as The Gospel of Superman in 1910. Although the terms “overman” (Alexander Tille), “superman” (G. B. Shaw), or “upperman” (George Meredith) were bandied about and, indeed, treated seriously, as with H. G. Wells, Nietzsche’s call for a revaluation of values was central in making his name renowned among the prewar intelligentsia in Britain. Nietzsche’s rejection of Christianity through the figure of Zarathustra was accepted as iconoclastic by every Nietzsche enthusiast, though John Cowper Powys was not alone in highlighting a contradiction within Nietzsche himself when he declared that Nietzsche’s soul was “riddled with religion” (Visions and Revisions, 1915): Lou Andreas-Salomé in Friedrich Nietzsche in seinen Werken said exactly the same thing. Powys, like many other early Brit-\n\nxxxviii •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nish Nietzscheans, including W. B. Yeats, made a comparison between Nietzsche and William Blake as visionary prophets, and Arthur Symons made this comparison in his William Blake (1907). Yeats was also the most perceptive British interpreter of the doctrine of eternal return. Incidentally, Symons wrote a play titled Superwoman in 1908, but as this was not published, it is not possible to make a comparison between it and Daniel Lesueur’s Nietzschéenne. The first British novel to have a Nietzschean hero was W. H. Mallock’s The Veil of the Temple (1904). Another important field for discussion among British Nietzscheans was the dichotomy between Apollo and Dionysus. The (muchsimplified) distinction was usually made between Dionysus, the god of passion, and Apollo, the god of restraint. Most writers or critics who approached the topic did so from the angle of art: it was not always stressed that both gods represent man’s instinctual life. Apollo was seen as the god of reason and intellect; Dionysus was linked with pagan abandonment. Sometimes a Southern setting indicated a Dionysian dimension, as with Yeats’s poem “The Statues,” which includes the geographical dimension of “Asiatic vague immensities.” D. H. Lawrence also profiled the elements of a Southern climate such as Africa when describing the unreflecting instinctual life of the native in Women in Love (1914), drawing a contrast with the unhealthy inhibitions of the Northerner. Discussions of Nietzsche in the many articles on him prior to World War I show the characteristic variety of viewpoints so typical of Nietzscheanism: either Nietzsche (often not distinguished from Zarathustra) was deplored as heralding cruelty, or his liberation of the body was ecstatically applauded; his antidemocratic stance tended to be explained away as an aesthetic ploy. Convinced “Nietzscheites” of the period included Havelock Ellis, Aubrey Beardsley, Edward Garnett, Lascelles Abercrombie, T. E. Lawrence, and George Barker. After Yeats, the writer who was most completely under Nietzsche’s spell to an almost pathological extent in 1912 was Edwin Muir. His We Moderns (1918), a book of aphorisms that were taken to be a Nietzschean pastiche, deals with Nietzsche passim. Muir, a socialist and Christian, found the contradictions in being a Nietzschean too hard to sustain, and he subsequently repudiated his fanatical Nietzsche phase. Clearly, it can never be said that Nietzsche appealed either to the left wing or the right wing exclusively, nor should one forget that there were also plenty of detractors who had no time for Nietzsche’s ideas, among them the fanatical Dar-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxix\n\nwinist T. E. Hulme, G. K. Chesterton, Thomas Hardy, Arnold Bennett, George Meredith, and Aldous Huxley, though it could be argued that the Nietzschean current in Britain during the years 1896–1914 was so strong that few writers could really claim to have remained unaffected. World War I was a complicating factor in European Nietzsche reception; nowhere did his reputation suffer more than in Britain, though the “scapegoating” of Nietzsche, which from August 1914 became widespread, was for most people in the general public the first they had heard of the errant philosopher. Robert Bridges and Thomas Hardy were swift to blame the war on Nietzsche, and Oscar Levy labored in vain to convince the British that Nietzsche had no connection with German belligerence. After the war, triumphalism in Britain often combined with anti-Nietzschean pronouncements: in 1921, Nietzsche was relegated to the rank of “shilling shocker” by a correspondent for the Times. During the 1920s, the interest among avant-garde intellectuals shifted away from Nietzsche, whose name was now tarnished, to Karl Marx. By the 1930s, Nietzsche’s name had become so discredited in Great Britain that even firm Nietzscheans such as Herbert Read felt obliged to make defensive remarks about his works. A. H. J. Knight’s book on Nietzsche, published in 1933 under the title Some Aspects of the Life and Work of Nietzsche, breaks the silence that otherwise surrounds the topic of Nietzsche during the 1930s and, moreover, lacks polemical content: a remarkable fact in view of the date of publication. Unlike their French counterparts, British Nietzscheans made no attempt to rescue Nietzsche’s reputation by explaining the extent of the Nazi misappropriation. Father Copleston was alone in his attempt to render Nietzsche theologically harmless; his Friedrich Nietzsche, Philosopher of Culture (1942) and St. Thomas and Nietzsche (1944) echoed the many similar attempts of French theologians—who were usually Catholic. The silence on Nietzsche in Britain was finally broken with the publication of F. A. Lea’s The Tragic Philosopher (1957). The sympathetic tone was maintained in R. J. Hollingdale’s Nietzsche: The Man and His Philosophy (1965), reprinted in 1999, followed by sympathetic philosophical discussions by Eric Heller, J. P. Stern, David Cooper, and Michael Tanner, all of whom were pioneers in the then hostile climate of the British ivory tower. Hollingdale was the undisputed sage of Nietzsche studies in Britain until his death (28 September 2001). The prolific translator and critic of Nietzsche’s works, he was the first presi-\n\nxl •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndent of the Friedrich Nietzsche Society and so venerated that another president has yet to be elected. In the contemporary field of literature, Sebastian Barker has written a long poem, The Dream of Intelligence (1992), portraying Nietzsche’s mind on the night of his collapse, and Lavinia Murray’s radio play Nietzsche’s Horse (1997) reproduces Nietzsche’s (alleged) conversation with the now legendary beaten horse a few moments before his mental collapse. The play satirically surveys all the horses that could possibly relate to Nietzsche. An author today often makes a casual reference to Nietzsche, expecting the general public to know chapter and verse. British philosophers today such as Keith Ansell-Pearson and David Owen have tended to support the principles of the New Nietzsche, as did Germanists like Duncan Large, though Paul Bishop and Nicholas Martin (both Germanists) have held firmly to a classical interpretation. The trend among British scholars now, spearheaded by Ansell-Pearson, is to stress Nietzsche’s confrontation with the natural sciences (especially Charles Darwin and lesser-known figures like Ruggero Boscovich). The general public has at last been weaned from the lingering impression that Nietzsche was a protofascist. Perhaps the 1995 TV film of Ben Macintyre’s book Forgotten Fatherland: The Search for Elisabeth Nietzsche (1992) has done more to clear Nietzsche’s name than anything else by showing the extent of Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche’s manipulation of her brother’s work.\n\nNIETZSCHEANISM IN THE UNITED STATES Although Nietzsche himself admired Ralph Waldo Emerson, he almost certainly did not know about Walt Whitman, whose vitalism became a cult phenomenon in Germany in 1889, only months before Nietzsche lapsed into insanity. By the same token, he probably did not know much, if anything, about Henry James, his contemporary, nor indeed did Henry James have any direct contact with Nietzsche’s work, although Stephen Donadio in Nietzsche, Henry James, and the Artistic Will (1978) has suggested that there are parallels in the thought of both on art, indicating influences in common. As in Great Britain and France, so too in the United States, Nietzsche’s impact made itself felt through critics and creative writers rather than\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xli\n\nthrough philosophers; however, much damage was done to Nietzsche’s reputation by the early appearance in America of Degeneration (1895), the English translation of Max Nordau’s Entartung (1893). Equally hostile were the reviews of Nietzsche’s works that appeared in America during 1896. A shift toward appreciation of Nietzsche then took place: the works of James G. Huneker and Henry L. Mencken are milestones in Nietzsche reception. Huneker’s Overtones: A Book of Temperaments (1904) contained an essay on Nietzsche, and so did his Egoists: A Book of Supermen (1909). Huneker and Percival Pollard attempted to make Nietzsche popular in America by stressing the theme of art in his work. Huneker in turn introduced Mencken to Nietzsche. Mencken, “journalist and jazz-age guru of the American intelligentsia” (Hays Steilberg), was by 1908 busy challenging what he saw as blinkered American puritanical prejudices. Mencken was heavily influenced by Nietzsche’s thought, stressing the “Dionysian” premise that “art is not a matter of morality” (Patrick Bridgwater); he also saw the Übermensch in terms of a success-seeking materialist. Mencken was in turn responsible for introducing the novelist Theodore Dreiser to Nietzsche’s work. Dreiser’s The Titan came out in 1914 and Hey, Rub-A-Dub-Dub! in 1920. Mencken’s influential The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche had appeared in 1908. The only serious philosophical challenge to Nietzsche’s thought was delivered by the Spanish-born George (originally Jorge) Santayana, whose time at Harvard had made him an “honorary”American. In his wartime publication Egotism in German Philosophy (1916), written in England, Santayana—who strongly supported the Allies—held that Nietzsche’s moral code was partly responsible for the outbreak of hostilities, though he had formerly held many of Nietzsche’s views on aesthetics. Mencken influenced two other Nietzscheans, George Jean Nathan and Benjamin de Casseres. Casseres published The Superman in America in 1929 and I Dance with Nietzsche (privately) in 1936. Casseres was responsible for introducing Eugene O’Neill to Nietzsche’s work. Mencken published three plays by Eugene O’Neill in The Smart Set in 1917–1918. The editorial committee of The Smart Set consisted of Nathan, Mencken, and another Nietzschean, Willard H. Wright, whose What Nietzsche Taught came out in 1915. Mencken was also editor of the American Mercury, which not surprisingly printed enthusiastic material on Nietzsche such as that by the essayist and\n\nxlii •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\njournalist Randolph Bourne, who shared Mencken’s antipathy toward the American puritanical mind-set. Bourne attempted to expand Nietzsche’s notion of the “good European” to encompass a pan-American nationalism. His reading of Nietzsche was highly selective: he tended to ignore inconvenient aspects of Nietzsche’s thought, such as his antidemocratic stance. Bourne’s early death in 1918 at the age of only 32 denied his deliberations on the political aspects of Nietzsche’s thought the chance to fully mature. The reaction of Jack London to Nietzsche’s works when he first read them was that he “ate them up” with what must have been an intoxication similar to that experienced by Edwin Muir. The idea of the Superman was what he found most appealing and what he used for his character portrayals in The Sea Wolf (1903–1904), The Iron Heel (1908), Martin Eden (1910) and Burning Daylight (1910), but none of these approach the archetypal mythic quality of Call of the Wild (1903) and White Fang (1906). Nietzsche’s influence can also be traced in works of second-rank writers such as Floyd Dell’s The Moon-Calf (1920) and Ben Hecht’s Erik Dorn (1921) and Humpty Dumpty (1924). The poet John Gould Fletcher was swayed by an enthusiasm for Nietzschean ideas from 1915 on, when he had witnessed the Dionysianism of Vaslav Nijinsky’s dancing, itself inspired by Nietzsche. Fletcher’s Parables of 1925 owes much to Nietzsche’s works. In particular, Fletcher here worked out his own religious struggle with the death of God. For O’Neill, too, Nietzsche’s programmatic atheism was decisive. During the 1930s, America received a large number of refugees from Germany who went on to contribute to the intellectual life of the nation. The roll call of writers and thinkers such as Thomas Mann, Hannah Arendt, Karl Löwith, Theodor Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse forces one to reflect on the loss to Germany of such luminaries. All had read Nietzsche and had something relevant (if not always complimentary) to say about his thought. Culturally, too, refugees such as the artist Max Beckmann provided a fulcrum for new trends. Beckmann had already experienced the full force of the enthusiastic Nietzscheanism of German Expressionism. American interest in Nietzsche-inspired dancing in the wake of the expressive techniques pioneered in the United States by Isadora Duncan, herself a Nietzschean, ensured that Beckmann redoubled his interest in painting hedonistic dance scenes, though what\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xliii\n\nNietzsche would have made of Beckmann’s palpable enthusiasm for jazz remains a moot point. Nietzsche scholarship took a nosedive during the 1940s; it was politically incorrect to have anything to do with a writer suspected of fascist tendencies. An exception was Crane Brinton’s Nietzsche (1941). Nietzsche was not really rehabilitated until Walter Kaufmann published his Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist in 1950. Kaufmann would become a tireless promoter of Nietzsche through a series of translations of his works. Another major investigation was Arthur Danto’s Nietzsche as Philosopher (1965), swiftly followed by Peter Heller’s Dialectics and Nihilism (1966). There followed the work of Sander Gilman, Frederick Love, Herbert Reichert, and Joan Stambaugh. The pursuit of Nietzsche studies was greatly furthered when Bernd Magnus and Kaufmann founded the North American Nietzsche Society in 1980. In America today, Nietzsche’s work is accepted into the canon of philosophy in a way that it is not in most other countries, including his native Germany. Richard Rorty has investigated irony in connection with Nietzsche, asserting that for Nietzsche, the ironical stance was a way of pursuing theoretical metaphysical discourse. The adoption of the ironic mask and “play” in the metaphorical sense became favored terms in Nietzsche critique. Although Allan Bloom was been critical of Nietzsche’s elitism, postmodern philosophers downplayed this aspect of his thought, adopting wholesale the style and methods of the New Nietzsche. This French import has produced awkward linguistic formulations in English, such as “always already” to translate “toujours déjà,” the term used by Jacques Derrida to create his own perspectivism, which no doubt endeared him to postmodern theorists intent on pressing Nietzsche’s perspectivism. Until the new millennium, which brought with it a new direction in Nietzscheanism—away from an insistence on metaphor and toward an attempt to place Nietzsche’s thought within the context of natural science—the favored text was universally the suspect Will to Power, and the strategic intention was to use deconstruction in order to show that there is never “one truth”; there is no such thing as “the self.” Ted Sadler has set himself up in opposition to such practices, arguing that Nietzsche’s belief in order of rank overrules his interest in perspectivism. Although the trend in America has been for a wholesale acceptance of the New Nietzsche, a number of scholars held to the more\n\nxliv •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n“orthodox” line of Bernd Magnus and Richard Schacht—Kathleen Higgins, Robert Solomon, Ernst Behler, Tracy Strong, and Christa Acampora, for example. In contrast, Alexander Nehemas, Mark Warren, Gary Shapiro, and Alan Schrift were experimental in their interpretation of Nietzsche’s perspectivism. A generation of American feminists, among them Ofelia Schutte and Debra Berghoffen, inspired by Lacanian precepts on feminine desire and Derridean suggestions on woman’s veiling techniques (purportedly à la Nietzsche), incorporated a new methodology into feminist academic discourse and applied this to their Nietzsche critique. As Daniel Conway put it, “Nietzsche’s perspectivism . . . provides a promising epistemological model for feminist theories.” For a while during the 1990s, Nietzsche’s name was used repeatedly within a feminist context with seldom a mention of his strong resistance to feminism. Babette Babich has provided an astonishingly eclectic entrepreneurial approach in her Nietzsche critique, ranging from music to science, and has done much to promote the examination of the “natural Nietzsche.” John Richardson, in Nietzsche’s New Darwinism (2004), states that Nietzsche was more of a Darwinian than he thought. Eternal return— which, true to its name, comes in and out of fashion—is once again a priority topic, this time with the focus on physics, with the real risk that Nietzsche criticism might become as bogged down in pseudoscience as it did in French feminist terminology. The trend is still to cull passages on eternal return from The Will to Power, though Nietzsche had said all he wanted to say in print on the matter in Thus Spoke Zarathustra.\n\nNIETZSCHEANISM IN ITALY Like Germany, Italy achieved unification during Nietzsche’s lifetime: in 1861, it was constituted as a single state, while Germany was unified in 1871. This colored much of the early Nietzsche reception in both countries. In Italy, the prime disseminator of Nietzsche’s ideas, Gabriele D’Annunzio, was an almost fanatical patriot. The new “radical irrationalism” that D’Annunzio inspired also laid claim to the work of Søren Kierkegaard and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Partly because of D’Annunzio’s lack of academic credentials and partly because no work of Nietzsche was translated into Italian until Al di là del bene e del male appeared in\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xlv\n\n1898, followed by Così parlò Zarathustra in 1899, the Italian scholarly world at first held aloof from Nietzsche’s philosophy. Ettore Zoccoli’s reserve was typical. Since he could read Nietzsche in German, he had a head start over his compatriots, publishing the first monograph in Italian on Nietzsche in 1898 (Federico Nietzsche, La filosofia religiosa—la morale—L’estetica). As professor of moral philosophy in Rome, he had difficulty in accepting Nietzsche’s premises and compared Nietzsche’s “dilettantish” thought unfavorably with the systems of Kant and Hegel. The second Italian philosopher to deal with Nietzsche’s works was Francesco Orestano. His enthusiasm was probably more damaging than Zoccoli’s reserve since he insisted, in Le idee fondamentali di Federico Nietzsche nel loro progressivo svolgimento. Esposizione e critica (The Basic Thought of Friedrich Nietzsche and Its Development: Discussion and Critique, 1903), on an idiosyncratic and distorted categorization of Nietzsche’s works whereby he argued that Nietzsche’s thought was a continuation of the Kantian method (rather than a breach with it). As a reaction to this kind of attempt to force Nietzsche to fit into a pattern, the writer and thinker Giovanni Papini announced that a new type of philosophy had been born, yet in Un uomo finito (1912), he too used Nietzsche for his own purposes. Prior to his religious conversion, Papini was also instrumental in bringing the ideas of Henri Bergson into Italy through translations of his work. Bergson’s élan"
