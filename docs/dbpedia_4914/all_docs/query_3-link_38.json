Information which should be as full as possible, should be sent to the secretary, 39, Old Queen Street, Storey's Gate, S.W., and will receive the prompt and careful attention of the committee. COMMITTEE NOTES. ON the 1st of July the last meeting of the committee before the vacation was held at the offices of the society. The election of members was the first business undertaken, and sixteen members and associates were elected. The number of elections for the year up to the present date is 132, which is one more than in July of last year, and three behind the number elected in the corresponding period of 1 905. The average, therefore, is still well main- tained. The resignations numbered six. The next business before the committee was to sanction the affixing of the seal of the society to a form authorising the payment of dividends on stock held by the society to the society's bank. The secretary then laid before the committee an agreement from one of the largest publishing houses in London. The committee sanctioned the publication of the agreement, with the name of the publisher, and the secretary's comments, in one of the future issues of The Author. Authority was given to the chairman to act on behalf of the committee during the vacation, in matters of urgency. Readers of The Author will remember that the last statement of the committee's work contained a reference to the opinion of counsel, which the committee had sanctioned, in order to ascertain what course, if any, the society should follow for the fuller protection of the property of one of its members. This opinion was laid before the com- mittee ; while endorsing the course of action hitherto taken by the society, counsel was unable to advise further action for the present. The committee directed that the opinion should be communicated to the member whose interests were in question. Readers may also remember that the case of E. Nesbit and The Yorkshire Pout was printed in the July issue. The secretary reported -that this had been done under the sanction of the chairman and committee, and that, in accordance with their instructions, a letter had been sent to the Institute of Journalists, of which the following is a copy : — June 2f,t/i, 1907. The Secretary, The Institute of Journalists. DEAD SIB, — At the request of the committee of the Society of Authors I enclose copy of a statement of a case which we are printing in the next issue of Th? Author. I am informed that the question was laid before the Institute of Journalists, but that no notice was taken of it. When I say \"no notice was taken of it,\" I understand that the secretary called upon E. Xesbit and suggested she should see Mr. 1'hillips, but as she refused to do so the matter dropped. I shall be obliged if you will look into the matter. I remain, Yours truly, HERBERT THRIXG. The secretary laid before the committee the reply to that letter, which ran as follows :— 27th Ji/iif, 11107. DEAR SIR,— Your letter of June 26th is received : and has my attention. For the present, all that I need say, I think, is position of the Institute in reference to the matter is evidently misunderstood, as it appears from your letter. I am, Dear Sir. Yours very truly, (Signed) HERBERT CORNISH, Sec. 'AUTHOR. 3 Owing to the pressure of business the report of the dramatic sub-committee was adjourned till the Autumn meeting, when the work the sub- committee have undertaken during the past year will be duly considered and dealt with. Mr. Francis Storr was elected treasurer of the society to fill the vacancy caused by the regretted death of Mr. J. M. Lely, who had held- the position since the office was created. One or two other cases of minor importance were considered, and the committee advised the authors involved as to the course they should adopt. There were also one or two letters submitted to the committee for consideration. II. - A SPECIAL meeting of the committee was held on Monday, July 22nd, at 4 P.M., to consider an invitation from the Association Litteraire et Artis- tique Internationale to the Authors' Society to send a representative to the meeting at Neufchatel this year. The Association Litteraire et Artistique has now been in existence for many years. It was the first to give an impetus to the nations to gather together at Berne when the Berne Convention was settled. Every year a meeting is held at some important centre on the Continent, in order to discuss questions dealing with literary property and allied matters. The committee, in addition, had before them a letter from Mr. George Meredith, the president of the society, asking that the matter should be care- fully considered. The whole position was debated, and finally, after considerable discussion, it was thought best not to send a delegate to the meeting for the current year. It was pointed out that it had not hitherto been the practice for the Society of Authors to be represented at these meetings, and that the present occasion was not a favourable one to depart from the practice hitherto adhered to, inasmuch as the present position of the copy- right question in England did not afford the prospect that any substantial alterations in the domestic law could be carried into effect in the near future. The secretary was, accordingly, instructed to express the committee's regret to the president and secretary of the Association Internationale at their inability to send a representative. The case of E. Nesbit and the Yorkshire Post incidentally came up for discussion, as it chanced that a letter had been received from Mr. Phillips prior to the meeting. A full statement appears in another column. There were three applications for re-election placed before the committee, as the applicants desired immediate advice. The ordinary elections were postponed till October, as is usual during the vacation. As the, committee have to give special attention to appli- cations for re-election, these three applications were dealt with at once, and after the committee had considered the various circumstances inci- dental to each case, the members were re-elected.. The names are set out in another column. THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE. In the July issue of The Author a report of the1 meeting of the Council was given. The six members elected at that meeting met at the offices of the society, 39, Old Queen Street, Storey's Gate, S.W., on \"July 1st, and chose six members of the society according to the decision of the Council. The following were elected, and have consented to undertake the duties : Maurice Hewlett, Sir Alfred Lyall, Miss S. Macnaughton, G. W. Prothero, Mrs. Steel and Sidney Webb. The committee then decided to call a meeting on November llth, when the business would be \" to consider the constitution of the society.\" Cases: DURING the past three months, that is, during July, August and September, the secretary of the society has had thirty-five cases to deal with. Thirteen of these referred to non-payment of money to members. Six have terminated successfully on the secretary's application only, four had to be placed in the hands of the society's solicitors — of these, three have been terminated without going into court, and one has been put down for trial and will come on in October. The other three have only recently come into the secretary's hands, and there has not, as yet, been time to determine the issue. In eight cases the secretary has had to demand the return of MSS. Six of these have been successful, one is only recently to hand The last referred to the detention of a MS. by an agent. In spite of the opinion of the solicitors to the society that the MS. had been wrongfully detained, the agent has refused to deliver the MS. to the member unless he is paid a certain sum. There have been two cases of general disputes on contracts. In one the secretary was obliged to advise the member to go no further. The other was placed with the society's solicitors to defend in the event of the publisher commencing proceed- ings, which he had threatened to do. One question arose touching the infringement of dramatic rights. The opinion of the society's solicitors in this case was opposed to the author's contention, and, accordingly, the case was withdrawn. Publishers TH& AUTHOR. having failed to deliver accounts, members have in eight cases been forced to refer the matter to the secretary. Four of these have been brought to a successful conclusion. The other four have only recently come into the office. Of two questions referring to the withholding of accounts and money, one has been placed with the solicitors, the other has only recently come to the office. One case has occurred touching the infringement of an author's right to a title, by the publication of another book under a title identical with that used by the member involved. This matter has been satisfactorily adjusted between the parties. Outside these cases, there have been three cases placed in the hands of the society's solicitors, on •which action has been taken, but little has been done during the vacation, and the result of the actions will be reported in one of the coming issues of The Author, when the Courts begin to sit again.

The former has been issued in book form in America. A \" Study of English Children in the Olden Time,\" by Elizabeth Godfrey, has been recently published by Messrs. Methuen.

Everett are publishing early this month a novel by Derek Vane. It is called \" The Secret Door,\" a title taken from the following quotation on the first page : — \" In how many lives is there a Secret Door, of which the Warders are Fear and Anguish ? \" Mr. Henry Frowde has forwarded us two new •volumes of \"The World's Classics\" series: — Fielding's \"Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon,\" edited, with introduction and notes, by Mr. Austin Dobson ; and .Smollett's \" Travels Through France and Italy,\" with an introduction by Mr. T. Seccombe. •' The Lover of Queen Elizabeth,\" being the story •ot the life of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, by Mrs. Aubrey Richardson, has been published by Mr. Werner Laurie. The aim of the writer has been to discover fresh facts about the \" Complect Favourite,\" to discern his true character, and to -determine his real designs. Mr. Arnold publishes this month a novel by Mr.. Frank Savile, entitled, \"The Desert Venture,\" of which the scene is set in Morocco.

Knight, lately published by Greening & Cc., is a novel of the present day dealing with the love stories of several characters in widely different stations of life, the threads of whose destinies are curiously inter- woven. Cases of mistaken identity, of kidnapping and poisoning, accidents and rescues, produce a com- bination of adventurous situations, from which the characters are not extricated till the final chapter. The same writer has contributed an account of a motor-drive round the Lake of Geneva to the summer number of The Car Illustrated. \" Purple Heather,\" Alan St. Anbyn's new novel, published by Mr. John Long, deals with life on Exrnoor under its various aspects and conditions, more especially with the Dooue Valley and the country that Blackmore has already made famous.

Sir Isaac Pitman's Sons are publishing next month a new book by Father Robert Hugh Benson, entitled \" Lord of the World,\" a forecast of Society 100 years hence. Father Benson has also in prospect, with a collaborator, an historical novel dealing with St. Thomas a Becket. Mr. J. Blonndelle - Burton's new novel, \"A Woman from the Sea,\" will shortly be published by Mr. Eveleigh Nash. In it the author returns to the French Revolutionary period, as in the case of \" The Year One \" and \" The Fate of Valsec,\" but the scene is laid partly in England and partly amidst the workings of the Revolution in provincial districts, a phase of the sanguinary outbreak less known but equally as exciting as that of the Capital. Through the romance there runs also the question of whom the \" Woman from the Sea \" is, and in what way she is doomed to influence the fortunes of the hero and heroine. Mr. Arthur Machen has just completed a new romance in which he endeavours to show how the modern world struck a boy who was nourished iu the Celtic Dream. The writer who contributes to the Temperance Chronicle under the nom de plume \" Medicus Abstinens \" is about to bring out in book form a selection from his weekly articles under the title of \" Sidelights on Alcohol.\" The Church of England Temperance Society will publish the book, which deals from a medico-temperance point of view with thirst, the fluid equilibrium of the body, the skin, alcohol and bodily temperature, alcohol and the arteries, Bright's disease, alcohol in the hospital and the treatment of inebriety, with special refer- ence to patent cures for inebriety. \" Children of the New Century ; or, Physiology made Easy,\" is the title of a book comprising twelve readings by Miss Rose Harrison.

The vindication of trypsin, the new remedy for cancer, is the object of Dr. C. W. Saleeby's book, \"The Cure for Cancer,\" published by Messrs. Chiipmau. The book is so written as to make the subject readily comprehensible to thegeneral public, as well as to the medical profession.

Sir Oliver Lodge contributes to science a revised and enlarged edition of \" Modern Views of Electricity,\" and politics are represented by \" England and Germany,\" by Austin Harrison, being a reprint of the series of articles, somewhat enlarged, which appeared in the Observer. Messrs. Hutchinson are publishing a new romance by Mr. Rider Haggard, entitled \" Fair Margaret,\" which deals with the period of Henry VII. in England, and of Ferdinand and Isabella in Spain.

Hutchinson have also a novel by Mr. Charles Garvice, \" The Gold in the Gutter,'\" and will publish in November a sixpenny edition of the same author's \" Heart for Heart.\" Mr. Garvice is starting, on October 1, on his fourth Lecture- Recital Tour in the north of England and Scotland.. His subject is \" Some Humourists Grave and Gay,\" and consists of brief, critical and biographical sketches of some of the humourists, English and American, and the recital of extracts from their works. In \" The Story of Insect Life,\" Mr. W. Percival Westell deals in a popular manner with the com- mon species of British insects. The style of treat- ment is intended to encourage the intelligent life-study of insects by our younger folk and to discourage collecting. The book, which is fully illustrated with photographs and coloured plates, is published by Mr. Robert Cully. A new book by Mr. W. Hope Hodgson is being published by Messrs. Chapman & Hall, entitled '• The Boats of the ' Glen Carrig.' \" \"The Weavers,\" by Sir Gilbert Parker, M.P., contrasts the glow and glamour of the Orient witli pictures of English social and political life. Having appeared serially in Harjicr's Mn/jazini-, it has now been simultaneously published in England and America by Messrs. Heinemann and Messrs. Harper & Bros, respectively. \" Triumphant : the Embodiment of an Ideal,\" is the title of a new short novel from the pen of May Evans (\"A Welsh Spinster'''). The scene of the story is laid chiefly in South Wales, and is redolent of the atmosphere of that romantic country. In telling the life-story of the heroine, Margaret Allen, a beautiful character of superior mind, Miss Evans gives pictures of many of the fast-dying habits and customs of South \\Vales — among others, a \" riding \" wedding. Mrs. Hubert Bland, whose story for children,. \"The Enchanted Castle,\" which has been running in the Strand, Mr. T. Fisher Uuwin will publish this winter, is completing a novel of life among London art students. Her poem, \" Inasmuch As I Did it Not,\" which appeared iu the Daily AY;/1*. will shortly be issued as a booklet, probably with illustrations by Mr. Spenser Prysc. \" The Last Empress of the French,\" being thfr AUTHOR. 9 life of the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III., by Philip W.

The book is, naturally, full of illustrations. Miss Beatrice Harraden has for some time past been engaged on a long novel, which is now approaching completion. The scene of the story is •laid entirely in London. Messrs. Methuen & Co. announce the publication of a work by M. Sturge Henderson, \" George Meredith, Novelist, Poet, Reformer.\" The book is a careful study of the novels in chronological order, and of the consistent ideas underlying Meredith's work as novelist, poet, critic, and essayist. These ideas, as far as possible, are set forth not as abstractions but in relation to character and dialogue. \"Five Nights,\" the new book by Victoria Cross, be issued by Mr. John Long in April next. It will be somewhat different in scheme and con- struction from the author's previous works. Of her last book, \" Life's Shop Window,\" 10,000 copies were sold before publication. The scene of •\"Five Nights\" is laid in Alaska, England, and Mexico, and is largely an exposition of the artist's temperament and view of life. On Tuesday, August 27, Mr. Henry Arthur Jones's play, \" The Hypocrites,\" which had had a successful run in America, was produced for the first time in England at the Hicks Theatre. The plot turns on the efforts of a family to marry their son to the daughter of a wealthy baronet, in the face of the opposition of a curate, who is champion- ing a girl the son has betrayed. The cast included Miss Marion Terry, Miss Doris Keane, Mr. Leslie Faber, and Mr. J. H. Barnes. \" Fiander's Widow,\" a comedy in three acts, by Sydney Valentine and M.E. Francis (Mrs. Blundell), was produced at the Garrick Theatre on August 28. The comedy is a dramatised version of Mrs. Blundell's novel of the same name, that appeared some years ago, and breathes the atmosphere of rural Dorsetshire. In the cast are Miss Miriam -Clements, Mrs. Charles Calvert, and Mr. Sydney Valentine. A new version of Mr. Hall Caine's play, \" The Christian,\" was presented at the Lyceum on August 31. It is frankly a play with a purpose, and, while the central theme is the physical relation- ship of the sexes, the rescue of the outcasts of Society is the object aimed at and dealt with by the author. Miss Keith Lytton, Miss Alice Craw- ford, Mr. Matheson Lang, and Mr. A. B. Imeson .are included in ths cast. \" Her Son,\" the four-aat play by Mr. H. A. Vachell, which originally appeared in a series of matinees at the Playhouse some months ago, has been revised, and was produced at the New Theatre on September 2, with Miss Winifred Emery, Miss Suzanne Sheldon, Mr. Kenneth Douglas, and Master Bobby Andrews in the principal roles. Mr. Lawrence Binyon's tragedy in four acts, \"Attila,\" was produced at His Majesty's Theatre on September 4, with Mr. Oscar Asche in the title- r61e, supported by Miss Lily Brayton, Miss Mary Eorke, Mr. H. R. Hignett, and Mr. J. Fisher White. The incidental music was composed by Sir Charles Villiers Stanford. We understand that Mr. John Murray is publishing the play in book form. At the Lyric Theatre, on September 10, Mr. H. V. Esmond produced a romantic play, \" Under the Greenwood Tree.\" The heroine, a wealthy orphan, deserts her house in Park Lane for a gipsy caravan in the New Forest; and on her subsequent adventures the play turns. The leading characters are in the hands of Miss Maxine Elliott, Miss Mary Jerrold, Mr. Charley Cherry and Mr. Eric Maturin. PARIS NOTES. FRANCE has lost in Sully Prudhomme one of her greatest poets. His works could never be popular, for they are too delicate and too full of thought to be read by the masses, but all lovers of Shelley would appreciate the rare and exquisite quality of the poems contained in the volumes entitled \"VainesTendresses,\" \"Epreuves,\" and \" Solitudes.\" Sully Prudhomme was born in 1839. He first studied for the Ecole Polytechnique, and later on law, but on coming into a small legacy he was able to devote himself entirely to literary work. His first volume was published in 1865 ; \" Stances et Poemes.\" Le Vase brise, which appeared in this collection, attracted great attention, and it is by this poem that Sully Prudhomme is now known throughout the world. Hia other works were \"Epreuves,\" \"Solitudes,\" \"Impressions de Guerre\" (1870), \" Destins,\" \"Vaines Tendresses,\" \"La Justice,\" \" Le Bonheur,\" \" La Revolte des Fleurs,\" \" Le Prisme,\" and his prose works are entitled \" De 1'Expression dans les Beaux- Arts,\" \" Reflexions sur 1'Art des Vers.\" His last volume was on Pascal. In 1881 Sully Prudhomme was elected a member of the French Academy, and in 1901 he was awarded the Nobel prize. With this money he THE AUTHOR. founded an annual'prize for encouraging young poets. For the last few years Sully Prudhomme bad been living very quietly in the country, as his delicate health made it necessary that he should leave Paris. Only a few months ago a delegation of Academicians and poets paid him a visit and presented him with a medal by Chaplain in com- memoration of his twenty-five years' membership of the French Academy. His death is universally deplored. He was a member of the Lyons Academy of Science and Art, of the Belgian Academy of Science and Art, and of the Hungarian Academy of Science. He also had various Orders, which had been conferred on him by Russia and Roumania. His funeral, with military honours, took place at the Madeleine, and he is buried at Pei'e Lachaise. Hector Malot, the well-known French novelist, died in July. He was born in 1830 and came to Paris when quite a young man to study law, with the idea of succeeding to his father's practice, but a literary career tempted him, and his first novels had great success. The list of his works is too long to give in full. \" Sans Famille\" is the novel which won for him world-wide fame. \" La Petite Sceur,\" \"Le Sang bleu,\" \"Seduction,\" \" Mon- daine,\" \"Mariage riche,\" \"Justice \" and \"Mere \" are also well known. He was a prominent member of the Societc des yens de leftres for over thirty years. Hector Malot gave up writing in 1895 and retired, with his family, to Fontenay-sous-Bois, where he died at the age of seventy-three. The \"Souvenirs de General Lacretelle,\" edited by Jacques de La Faye, is a most interesting volume of memoirs treating of the Second Empire and the first twenty years of the Republic. General Lacretelle was the son of an officer of the First Empire, who fought valiantly in Spain. On leaving the military school of St. Cyr, Lacre- telle asked to be enrolled in the Legion etrangere, as he was eager for active service. He tells of his life in Africa, of conflicts with the Arabs, of the overthrow of Louis Philippe, and of the reign of Napoleon III. On the declaration of war with Russia he again asked to be sent to the front. There are some extremely interesting episodes relating to this period of his life. General Lacre- telle was an excellent correspondent, BO that, thanks to the letters to his various friends, as well as to his own written account of the forty-seven years spent in the service of his country, we are taken on in this volume through the war of 1870 and the years that followed. During the latter part of his life General Lacretelle devoted much time to politics, and represented Maine-et-Loire in the Chamber of Deputies. The whole book is written in a lively, interesting way, and it contains biographical notices of other military celebrities of the same epoch, among others of Admiral Courbet, General de Sonis, General de Laveaucoupet and General de Ladmirault. \" Une petite niece de Lauzun,\" by M. de Coynart, is an interesting account of Henrietta, daughter of the Comte de Nogent, and of the times in which she lived. \"Temoins de jours passes\" is the title of » volume by M. Etienne Lamy. It consists of four studies, the first of which is on the Souvenirs ol\" Comte de la Ferronays. In the second and third of these sketches, devoted to the last days of the Empire, M. Lamy treats of the death of the Due d'Enghien, and of the qualities and mistakes- of Napoleon. The last of these four studies is written on the \" Journal de Charles de Lacombe.\"' It is on the period from 1871 to 1873, and thero/< of the National Assembly and that of M. Thiers. In \"Reines de 1'emigration,\" by the Vicomte de Reisct, the author gives us a charming sketch of Louise d'Esparbes. yomtesse de Polastron. In \" La Fille de Louis XVI.,\" M. Lenutre's- y latest volume of \" Memoirs et Souvenirs sur la Revolution et I'Empire,\" the memoirs written by Marie Therese-Charlotte herself, about the captivity of her parents up to the time of the death of her brother in 1795, are most interesting. \" Correspondance, lettres de jeunesse,\" by Emile Zola, is the first volume of the correspondence of the French novelist, and contains letters written to his intimate friends describing all his straggles, moral and material, from the time he came to seek his fortune in Paris. \" La Rhodesia,\" by E. de Renty, is a book which •will probably interest English readers more than French ones. It is a study of the organization and administration of the company founded by Cecil Rhodes, and contains chapters on the agri- culture, the commerce, mines, and public works of the country. \"Le Seuil,\" by Pierre de Beaupre, is a novel by' ' a Frenchman, in which a certain class of English society is studied. The author seems to be well acquainted with the people he describes. The question raised, although not put into actual words, seems to be whether the boasted freedom of the English girl, exaggerated as it undoubtedly is at present, is altogether satisfactory. We [see in this novel a family of extreme individualists, a daughter left free to follow her own devices ; we see her as a guest at a house-party, and we have a picture of modern English entertainment, and of manners and customs which we can easily understand must have amazed a Frenchman, accustomed as he is to the care and forethought of French parents, even in the working classes, for their daughters. The book has been much discussed, and the general T//B AUTHOR. 11 opinion seems to be that it is not an exaggeration, but a picture drawn from the every-day life of a large class of modern society in England. \"Calvaire de femme,\" by Madame Daniel Lesueur, consists of two books : \" Le fils de •1'amant\" and \"Madame I'Ainbassadrice.\" Both volumes are dramatic, and full of episodes dear to the heart of readers of feuilhtons. \" L'Ecran brise,\" by Henry Bordeaux, is the title •of a volume containing four novelettes: L'Ecran ln-isi', La JIaisoti niHiidite, La jeunne fills aux •oiseaiu: and La Visionnaire. Among the recent novels are \" Le mariage d'Asnes\" by Jules Claretie, \" Le Grief secret \" by H. Kabnsson, \" Tu ne tueras pas\" by Marguerite Holland, \"Femmes\" by Marcel Prevost, \"Sybaris\" •by Jean Bertheroy, \"Centre le sort\" by J.-H. Rosny, \"Quand j'etais homuie \" by Camille Lemonnier. The Comedie Franchise has just produced the new play by MM. Guiches et Gheusi, entitled •\" Chacun sa Vie.\" The Odeon opened with \" Le Roi Lear.\" The classical matinees are to commence on the 31st of •October with \" Tartuffe,\" preceded by a lecture on the play by M. Alfred Capus, and the first new ipiece is to be \" Les Plumes du paon.\" The Theatre Rejane has an interesting pro- gramme for the winter. The first pieces are \" La Tirnbale\" by MM. P. Vande>em and G. Lenotre, •\" Vieil Homme,\" a five-act comedy by M. G. de Porto-Riehe, \" Madame Mouton \" by MM. Sylvane and Monezy-Eon, \"Qui perd gagne\" by Alfred •Capus. Plays are also announced by Anatole France and by M. Oudinot. M. Henry Bernstein is writing a play, the subject of which is taken from M. Binet-Valmer's •curious novel \" Les Mcseques.\" Sardou has just finished a five-act historical play, entitled \" L'Affaire des poisons,\" which will be produced at the Porte St. Martin Theatre after .M. Aicard's play. ALYS HALLAKD. SPANISH NOTES. GAL I CIA,\" by Manuel Murguia, is an admirable work on this most interesting province of the north-west of Spain, for it treats of the history, monuments, geography and traditions of the region. The book is a well illustrated quarto volume of 1,188 pages, and not \"illy does the author write with the authority of a number of the Academy of History of Spain, and president of the Academy of Galicia, but his references to its traditions and superstitions are made in the poetic spirit of one who is steeped in the love of the land. The work opens with an able disquisition on the early invasions of the district. The indubitable traces of the Celts are well touched upon ; and the influences of Rome and Gaul on the religion and customs of the people are ably set forth. Those interested in the connection of England with Spain during the past millenium will find that Galicia was the seat of many points of contact between the two countries, especially after the Black Prince came hither to support Peter the Cruel against Henry of Trastamar. The records of Santiago and Corunna form indeed quite a history of the many circumstances in which the two countries were mutually concerned. Manuel Murguia, moreover, knows how to interest the archaeologist ; for his scientific treatment of the monoliths are an interesting feature of Galicia ; and from the province of science he passes to that of poetry in his disquisitions on the troubadour- literature of the region which is so closely related with that of the south of France, and in which one can still see the same spirit as that which animated Alphonso the Wise in 1255. This book on Galicia is published by Daniel Cortezo in Barcelona, and certainly forms a most instructive companion to a visitor to this beautiful part of the Peninsula. It is from the pen of this same historian that the Temporada (the weekly organ of Mondariz) publishes an interesting record of the island of Cortegada at the mouth of the river Arosa, which has recently been presented to the King of Spain as the site of a new summer palace. The gift of this Island was an especial attention of the Galicians to their English Queen, as it is opposite Villagarcia where the British ships are familiar sights, and near Vigo, the point of touch with England. \" La literatura gallega en el xix siglo \" by Eugenio Carre Aldao, is a most useful work to those who care to pursue their studies iu Galician literature. Manuel Curros Enriquez takes an important place in the book, and the work forms a key to many problems of the connection of Provencal lore with that of Galicia by pointing to the characteristics of of the chief poets of past ages. As a poet of the present day, Rosalia Castro de Murguia, the late wife of the historian, has a very warm place in the hearts of her compatriots ; for the verses in which she voiced the feelings and the suffering of the poor peasants of the region were the fruit of her own strong, independent sym- pathetic nature. As a student of Heine she emerged from the grandiose style of ordinary Spanish poetry to the more simple German form which was so suited to her nature. It is from her pen that Spain has a powerful expression of the feeling 12 AUTHOR. which is aroused by the tomb of Sir John Moore at Coruuna. To pass from Galicia to Asturias we must note a poet whose works have already been notified in the book called \" El Mundo literario Americano \" by the Baronesa de Wilson, i.e., Martin Gonzalez del Valle, Marques de la Vega de Anzo. To read such poems as \"Fragments of a Letter,\" \"Spring,\" \"Remember,\" etc., is to see how adequate is the Spanish language to express feelings which are sincere enough to be echoed by every one who has been acquainted with grief. The verse in which the poet exclaims that \"Heaven is the land of those who suffer, weep, hope and love,\" is only one of the many which may be termed international, so independent are they of any difference of clime or religion. The Marques de la Vega Anzo's bread! h of study aud sympathy has also made its mark in the realm of prose, for it is from his pen that a complete compendium of the poets of Cuba has been pub- lished under the title of \" La Pcesia lirica en Cuba.\" To those who are not acquainted with Cuban literature the introduction to the various poets of the Island, with specimens of their styles, is replete with interest. \" Ocios de un estudiante \" (Idle hours of a stud- ent) is a readable little volume of essays by the son of the above-mentioned author, who writes under the pseudonym of Vicente de Castaiiedo. The dissertation on \" Idearmn Espanol \" is certainly the most erudite of the studies. For he gives a survey of the opinions of such leading writers of the day as Unamuno and Navarre y Ledesmauponthe author of the book, which is so popular in the Peninsula, before he passes to his own opinion of Gavinet, who has cer- tainly been successful in putting metaphysical truths in a form simple enough to be read by those who Ciinnot boast of much deep learning. The fact of the \"Idearum\" being only a book of 163 pages shows that the Andalusian author has known how to impart knowledge in small and pleasant doses. The essay on Mosen Verdaguer shows Vicente de Castanedo's acquaintance with poets of other lands, and this enables him to give a fairer criticism of his subject. Those interested in bright and clever Spanish plays will be glad to hear of those of Senor don Jose Fernandez Bremon. In \" La Pasion de un viejo,\" the Viejo (old man) is so loyal and charm- ing that one does not wonder that the young heroine is sufficiently captivated by his true and unselfish devotion to claim her right to return it when he is prostrated by paralysis brought on by indignation at the injustice with which she is treated. \"El Elixir de la Vida,\" from the pen of the same Senor Bremon, is a clever skit on the equivoques natural to a circle where this elixir is supposed to be possessed. At the recent fete given in honour of the visit of the Bishop of Madrid-Alcala at the Hydropathic Establishment of Mondariz, the aula saw not only a very good representation of a dramatic nature and a musical performance, but it was also the occasion for the declamation of some of his own poems by the Portuguese poet, Jos6 de Faria Machado, who is attache to the Legation of Portugal at Stockholm. This diplomat has written various volumes of verse, and his \" Eterna Fabula,'* \" El Sol de Maio,\" and \" Alimete da Rainha,\" have all been performed with great success at the Theatre Amelia in Lisbon. Kafael Fuembuena, who is well known at Vigo for his literary work, has now published a pretty little booklet called \" Apuntes\" (Notes), and as these notes bear upon various phases of society and are presented in a very dramatic form, one only regrets that they are so short and that the glimpses which they give of life do not widen into a broader stream where the author's evident talent would be seen to better advantage. El Feminal, the new monthly review of Bar- celona, is gallantly progressing, and the editress, Senora Dona Cormen Karr Lasarte, is to be con- gratulated on the able way she is conducting this review for the help and edification of her Cataloniaa sisters. Speaking of Catalonia reminds me of the valiant new newspaper Solidaridad) started in Bar- celona for the express purpose of showing that the recent solidarity for the suffrage which has been so successful must not be confounded with any idea of separatism from the rest of Spain. And as reference has sometimes been made in The Autltor to the patriotic eifoi t of Colonel Figuerola Ferretti to obtain a true suffrage in his country by petition- ing the King to use his prerogative for forming a Provisional Government to secure this national boon, it is interesting to see that the Catalonian writer Defes devotes a whole article to an able disquisition on this movement of 1902, which was calculated to base the solidarity of Spain on gratitude to the King for its protection ; and, as Defes shows, such a solidarity for the suffrage would always be superior to that of any particular region under those who may not be so loyal to the Dynasty. The indefatigable Percy Galdos has published a new historical novel about Isabel II. under the title \" La de les tristes Destines,\" and in my next notes I hope to speak fully on Unamuno's new book called \" The Life of Don Quixote and Sancho.'\" RACHEL CHALLICE. AUTHOR. 13 COPYRIGHT AND PLAYRIGHT. RECEXT CASES. Philip v. Pennell. THIS was an action brought by Miss Philip, the sole executrix of the late Mr. J. A. McNeil Whistler, to restrain Mr. and Mrs. Pennell, art critics, and Mr. Heinemann, pub- lisher, from publishing letters written by the deceased artist. Mr. and Mrs. Pennell, who were writing a biography of Mr. Whistler, which Mr. Heinemann proposed to publish, obtained posses- sion of original letters and documents written by Mr. Whistler, or copies of them, and claimed the right to use information as to his life and work which the letters contained. Certain issues of fact were tried before Mr. Justice Kekewich, who decided that Mr. and Mrs. Pennell were authorised by Mr. Whistler to write his biography ; and that, although the authority did not extend to the publication of letters or information contained in them, they were entitled, without such authority, to make use of the infor- mation for the purpose of describing the life and character of the artist. The defendants had no intention of publishing the letters or any extracts or paraphrases from them. The injunction, there- fore, was refused, and the action was dismissed with costs. The case, which on first impression had the appearance of raising an issue upon a question of copyright, has resulted in an important decision upon the limitation of confidential relations arising out of private correspondence. It has been fre- quently laid clown that the writer of a letter has a proprietary right and can restrain its publication ; but publication in such a case does not mean communicating the contents, but making a copy of the document by printing or otherwise. Apart from publication — in the copyright sense — a lawful use may be made of a letter without infringing the proprietary right of the author. For instance, if a letter does not appear on the face of it to be confidential, the receiver of the letter is entitled to communicate its contents. \" I adopt the pro- position of the defendants,\" said his Lordship, in delivering judgment, \"that a man writing a letter, not marked or appearing on the face of it to be confidential, to a member of a family, necessarily contemplates, and must be taken to permit, that the contents of the letter shall be communicated, or the letter iteelf read to the family assembled round the breakfast-table, and that permission must, I think, extend to common friends gathering at a club or elsewhere.\" Although it was not in issue in the case, an important question of copyright is unfortunately alluded to in the judgment, owing to certain admissions made by the defendants. In the pleadings the plaintiff claimed the right to re- strain publication of the letters ; and as the defen- dants did not intend to publish the letters, bub only information contained in them, it was no part of their case to dispute this claim of the plaintiff. Their admissions, however, appear to have led the judge into assuming that, as a matter of law, the personal representative of a deceased author has the right to restrain publication of his posthumous writings. His Lordship says : — \" Mr. and Mrs. Pennell agree that they are not at liberty to publish, in the sense of printing, or otherwise multiplying copies of, any letters or documents written by Mr. Whistler, and they further agree that the law ivhich forbids their doiwj this extends to extracts from and paraphrases of letters.\" And, \" Mr. and Mrs. Pennell have frankly admitted the proprietary right of tlieplaiit- tiff to prohibit the publication of letters.\" These oliter dicta certainly imply that the plain- tiff as personal representative — not the owner of the author's manuscript — had a proprietary right to restrain publication of the author's posthumous writings. Such a right appears to have been assumed in Lylton v. Devey, but in that case sec. 3 of the Copyright Act was not referred to ; and the recent case of Macmittan v. Dent suggests that the provisions of the statute as to unpublished works of a deceased author had not been fully appre- ciated. In the later case, it may be pointed out, the letters had been published, and the dispute was as to the \" copyright,\" which is distinct from the right to restrain publication ; but the question is, can the personal representative of a deceased author restrain the publication of posthumous works. It has often been stated, with an emphasis almost misleading, that copyright does not exist before publication. No doubt publication marks the commencement of the statutory term ; and the interest of an author in 'his unpublished writings is called a common law right ; but the latter so closely resembles copyright — and this is not generally appreciated — as to be hardly distinguish- able from it. For instance, the right of an author before publication is a sole and exclusive right ; he is at liberty to publish his writings, and he can restrain anyone else from publishing them. More- over, he enjoys an assignable interest. Exclusive- ness and assignability, for a limited period, are the characteristics of statutory copyright. Such is the proprietary right of the author in his unpublished works during his lifetime. But when the author dies, to whom does this right belong — to his personal representatives, or to the owner ot the author's manuscript ? 14 TUB AUTHOR. In Jfacminan v. Dent it was decided that the Copyright Act divested the author's personal repre- sentatives of the copyright in writings first published after the author's death. The copy- right belongs to the owner of the author's manuscript from which the work is first published. Is it suggested that until a posthumous work is actually published the author's personal repre- sentatives can restrain publication ? In other words, that he can prevent the owner of the author's manuscript from acquiring copyright, which the statute expressly takes away from the personal representative and confers upon the owner of the manuscript ? In the judgment of Mr. Justice Kekewich the suggestion seems to be accepted as if it was the law. The words of Lord Justice Vaughan Williams in JIacmiHan v. Denf are important upon this point. He says:: — \"They (i.e., Mr. and Mrs. Steeds, •owners of the author's manuscript), had not any copyright, but in my view, although they had no copyright, they had documents which, if they were the proprietors of them, gave them the right to acquire copyright.\" And then, referring to the agreement or assignment, he says, \" I think there was an intention to transfer that inchoate right.\" If the owner of the author's manuscript, there- fore, has an inchoate right in the posthumous work, which is assignable for a valuable considera- tion to a publisher, it seems unreasonable to assume that the personal representative has a proprietary right to restrain publication, and can render the assignment valueless. The real effect of the Copyright Act appears to be to divest the author's personal representative of all proprietary rights in posthumous works, unless he is the owner of the author's manuscript. It is beyond dispute that the owner of the author's manuscript from which the work is first published acquires the ^' copyright.'1 It is also clear that he has an \" inchoate right \" before publication. On the other hand, it is not clear that the personal representative •has any proprietary right in the author's unpublished works, or that he can defeat the rights of the owner •of the manuscript by restraining publication. Tale v. Fullbroolce. In this action Mr. Harry Tate, comedian, sought torestrain Mr. William Pullbrooke from performing & music hall sketch entitled \" Astronomy,\" on the ground that it was a colourable imitation of his •own sketch \" Motoring,\" and infringed his play- right. It was admitted that the dialogue in both .sketches was not the same, and that the literary •composition in the defendant's manuscript was not an infringement of the plaintiff's copyright. With regard to the playright, however, the evidence showed that the defendant, who had played in \"Motoring\" with the plaintiff, used the same \"make-up\" as the plaintiff, and imitated him during a part of the performance, and introduced into his sketch certain characters and incidents of stage business which were employed in the sketch of the plaintiff. Mr. Justice Phillimore held that although there was a great deal of dissimilarity between the two entertainments, there was a substantial similarity, and therefore a great deal of the defendant's entertainment would have to be restrained. It had been contended that the plaintiff's entertain- ment was not entitled to protection as a dramatic piece, being merely \" a collection of nonsensical remarks calculated to please vacant minds.\" His Lordship said that he was of opinion that the plaintiff's sketch was a dramatic entertainment within the Act, and that the plaintiff was the author. He thought that a dramatic piece could exist without any words at all, and even a mimetic sketch was entitled to protection. An idea or plot accompanied by gestures might be a dramatic piece or entertainment within the meaning of the statute. He gave judgment for the plaintiff for 40s. damages and costs, and granted an injunction to restrain the defendant from performing \"Astronomy\" in such a manner as to infringe the plaintiff' s rights. A stay of execution was applied for — but not granted — upon the ground that there was no precedent of an injunction to restrain a person from imitating another. The case is interesting as showing that play- right in situations, incidents, and stage business in a dramatic sketch — apart from the words — is entitled to protection ; and the judge's observa- tions support the opinion* that English law in this respect is analogous to the law in America, where it has been held that there may be playright even in a dance, if it contains a story with dramatic action and incidents. Moreover, it is a significant instance of an author successfully maintaining an action for the infringement of his playright in a \" stage-play,\" performed at a music hall not licensed for the performance of stage-plays under the Theatres Act. It has been pointed outf that although the performance of a \" stage-play \" is prohibited by English law at a music hall or any other place of entertainment not duly licensed for the perfor- mance of stage-plays, this does not in any way affect the playright of the author or his assignee. The author is entitled to the same remedies for enforcing his playright as if the piece had been examined by the Lord Chamberlain and performed at a duly licensed theatre.

THIS agreement made this clay of , between (the author), on behalf of himself, his executors, administrators, ami assigns, of the one part, and (the publishers) on behalf of themselves, their successors and assigns, of the other part, whereby it is mutually agreed as follows : — 1. The said (publishers) shall publish at their own risk and expense a volume by the said (author). 2. The copyright in this work, under existing or future Acts or Treaties, shall be the property of the said (pub- lishers), subject to the payment to the said (author) of a royalty of ten per cent, on the published price of the first thousand copies sold, fifteen per cent, on all sold between one thousand and two thousand copies, and twenty per cent, on the published price of all copies of the English edition sold beyond the first two thousand copies, and one half of any profits that may be realised from the rights of translation and reproduction, or any other imperial, colonial, or foreign rights which now, or during the con- tinuance of the legal term of copyright, shall be or become appurtenant to the proprietorof the copyright of the work, or from the sale of early sheets or stereotype plates of the said work to the United States or elsewhere. Provided that should it be thought advisable to dispose of copies of the said work as a remainder at a reduced price, either in England or abroad, which is left to the judgment and discretion of the said (publishers) the royalty to be paid to the said (author) is to be calculated on the amount of such sales, instead of on the published price of the book. 3. The general management of the production, publica- tion, reprinting, and sale of the work shall be left to the judgment and discretion of the said (publishers), including the power of making, on such terms as they may think advisable, or of declining arrangements with reference to the production, publication, translation and sale of the work, and translations thereof in India, the colonies, America and other foreign countries. 4. Corrections above ten shillings per sheet of thirty-two pages on the average to be charged to the said (author) and deducted from any royalties that may become due to the said (author). 5. The said (author) guarantees to the said publishers that the said work is in no way whatever a violation of any copyright belonging to any other party, and that he and his legal representatives shall and will hold harmless the said (publishers) from all suits and all manner of claims and proceedings which may be taken on the ground that the said work is such violation or contains anything libellous. 6.

In the case of books first published between Decem- 1 y, and. June 1, accounts shall be made up annually to June 1, and rendered as soon as practicable after that time, and the balance due shall be paid on the following 14th November ; and in the case of books first published between June 1, and December 19, accounts shall be made up annually to December 19, and rendered as soon as practi- cable after that time, and the balance due shall be paid on the following 14th May. • COMMENTS. The agreement printed above was placed before an author by the well-known firm of Messrs. Long- mans & Co., about a year ago. Changes may, of course, have been made in the last twelve months, without their coming to our notice. The contract, however, offers a fair text for comment to show what even the best houses sometimes offer to authors and what the latter ought to avoid. The usual methods of the firm of Messrs. Long- mans & Co. in the conduct of their business leaves nothing to be desired. They are always ready to give to authors the fullest details as to their accounts and to supply them, without hesitation, with printers' vouchers for the number of copies printed; but all this cannot excuse the form of agreement printed above, though forms just as bad were approved by the Publishers' Association in solemn conclave assembled as equitable between author and pub- lisher. Now the Publishers' Association contains all the best firms as members. No doubt the taint of the united action clings to the individual. For an explanation of those agreements and an elucidation of their equity members should refer to the pamphlet issued by the society with the secretary's notes. The following detailed comments are submitted, as they carry objections not only against the clauses which are manifestly inequitable from the author's point of view, but demonstrate how many points may be omitted and overlooked, which alone would give to the author the widest control of his property. First, the agreement (mould not be with the successors and assigns of the publisher as in the description of the parties to the present agreement. The contract for publication should be kept a per sonal contract. This is the best safeguard an author can have ; otherwise it is impossible for him to tell into whose hands the publication of his book may fall in the event of a firm breaking up or any alteration being made in its constitution. Here it may be as well to state as emphatically as possible that the publisher is an agent for the publication of the work in book form ; he is not a literary agent to handle the other outside rights, nor is he a principal to deprive the author of his copyright. Any agreement, therefore, contraven- ing these principles should not receive an author's signature. 16 TUB AUTHOR* To the first clause as it stands little exception can be taken, save that the author should limit the publication to a fixed price in book form, and that the publisher should agree to publish the book on or before a fixed date. In the same clause it is essential that the publisher should be limited as to the number of copies comprising the first edition. This is particularly important in the case of technical books which require re-editing from time to time. An example came before the society not very long ago in which an author in his \" salad days \" had transferred the copyright of his book, dealing with an exceedingly technical subject, to a publisher. Continuing his researches in connection with his particular subject, in the course of some ten years he acquired a large amount of additional material of great value and importance, and during these ten years obtained a reputation as one of the greatest authorities on his subject in England. It was to him of vital importance that he should issue another, and amended edition of his book, but when he came to bargain with the publisher, the latter refused to accept the alterations save on the under- standing that the author entered into a contract which was clearly disadvantageous, not only from pecuniary, but from other points of view. The author could not produce his new edition without infringing, to some extent, the copyright of the old which he had transferred to the publisher. As a result he was forced to re-purchase the copyright of his old book at the publisher's own valuation, in order that his reputation as one of the highest authorities on his subject might remain unimpaired. This may serve to indicate one reason for limiting the publisher to the publication of a fixed number of copies, the author retaining the right, if the book is a technical one, to re-edit after the sale of that number, and this right must be wholly with the author. This same point maybe carried further in regard to clause 2, and it may be stated that nothing could be more disastrous than for an author to convey the copyright of his work to a publisher. The disastrous results which may follow such a transfer have been intensified by a recent decision given in the Courts, which places an author in peril of losing, in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation of the firm, all the benefits of his agreement. The publisher should have merely a licence to publish the author's work in book form, as already stated, at a fixed price. Again, it is quite outside a publisher's business to deal with the rights of translation and reproduction in foreign countries, though it is at times advantageous to an author to allow the publisher to control the colonial edition, and, in exceptional cases, the management of the United States issue. In no circumstances, however, should the other rights be in the hands of the pub- lisher, e pecially as in some countries copyright in the book carries dramatic rights with it. To some authors these rights are of enormous importance. If the author desires to market them he can do so much better through the means of a literary agent, or by his own efforts. In the case of the sale of remainders contained in the proviso to the same clause, it is desirable that the author should have some control, and that the publisher should not be at liberty to \" remainder \" at his own will and pleasure, which, very often, is not the author's. The author should have the option of purchase at \"remainder\" prices, and it should be understood further — the publisher holding a licence to publish in book form — that, after the sale of the remainder, the contract should be at an end and all rights should return to the author. If the publisher held the copyright he would be in the proud position of preventing the author from re-publishing the book should he so desire, unless he re-purchased his rights at the publisher's valuation. Clause 3 is another difficult and dangerous clause. In regard to the production in England, this should be left in the hands of the publisher after he has been limited as above stated, but if he holds the extra rights which he claims in clause 2, he should not be allowed to accept or to decline arrangements at his own free will, for it might suit the publisher to accept a contract which was unsatisfactory to the author. If the publisher deals with these rights he should deal with them merely as an agent. He should not have the exclusive right of placing them ; but if he succeeds in obtaining an offer for them then the contract might be accepted or rejected by the author, as the latter thinks fit, and if accepted, the publisher should receive the usual agency fee for the work. The clause referring to corrections does not give the author a very wide margin, and it ought distinctly to be understood at the same time that only author's corrections are charged for, and not printer's errors. Clause 5. It is only fair that the publisher should be protected against any violation of copy- right, as in most cases it is impossible for him to come to any judgment on a question of this kind. Clause 6 we have already dealt with. The power to demand the re-editing of the book should not lie with the publisher. In connection with clause 7, it is only right to state, that in regard to any agreement with Messrs. Longmans & Co., who have an American house of their own, it may be to the advantage of the author to leave the American publication in their hands, but they should undertake in the agreement to secure the American copyright for the author, and it should not be left to their option. TUB AUTHOR. 17 Clause 8 is a dangerous clause as it stands, and is better deleted, with the exception of the first few words. The account clause is not satisfactory. Accounts at any rate during the first two or three years of a a book's existence, should be rendered semi- annually. Afoer thsit time an annual rendering might be sufficient. Payments should be made at an earlier date. Finally, it should be clearly stated once again, that in no circumstances should the contract with the publisher be other than a personal contract, nor should the author convey the copyright and •other exclusive rights in his work to the publisher. If he grants to the publisher an exclusive license, •as is sometimes the case when books are not of a technical nature, then a clause should be added providing for the termination of the agreement if the book is not kept on the market, or is allowed to rnn out of print. In every agreement there should be some arrangement by which the author can regain control of the licence to publish in these circumstances. Although we have gone into the strictures on this agreement in great detail, we feel sure that, •even from the publisher's point of view, Messrs. Longmans will see that some of the suggestions put forward are worthy of their consideration. It is to be hoped that in the near future we may see agreements of a more equitable nature issued from this old established and trustworthy firm. F. T. GRANT RICHARDS' BANKRUPTCY. T FINAL STATEMENT.

It is often the case that bald statements like the foregoing are liable to be misleading, and we are requested by Mr. H. A. Moncrieff, the trustee of the property, in justice to Mr. Richards, the com- mittee of inspection and himself, to add to it a little explanation. 18 TUB AUTHOR. The first meeting of the creditors was held on November 10th, 1904, and a receiver was appointed on the 12th by Mr. Ames, or by him in conjunction with Messrs. Dent. This receiver did not retire until April, 1905, and in the interval nearly £8,000 was absorbed in the first secured claim of £3,000, the costs and the expenses connected with carrying on the business. In the second place, creditors held various securities which they valued at £13,775, and, with the exception of the lease held by Messrs. Dent, none of these securities have ever reached the trustee's hands. Lastly, the trustee lost over £3,000 by the failure of Mr. Moring to complete his contract for the purchase of the stock and publishing contracts on the terms agreed. The trustee is of opinion that the estate has really produced about £40,000, but, as the greater part was held by creditors claiming to hold assets as security, only about one-third, and that subject to costs, became available for the unsecured creditors he represented. This, he says, is the cause of the small amount distributed by way of dividends. Such then is the .statement and the trustee's explanation, yet in both there would seem to be matters, or rather the omission of matters, that afford fitly an occasion of fair comment. We learn that a receiver was appointed on November 12th, 1905, how it is not clear, as the receiving order is dated January 17th, 1905. At any rate, when the receiver retired in April, 1905, he had spent £8,000, of which £3,000 is stated to be a secured claim. Of the remaining £5,000 no actual details are furnished. In fact details and dates in the statement are sadly lacking. Surely ,an account should be shown of the secured and unsecured creditors, and the amounts due to each. The deposit, also, presumably paid by Mr. Moring, and forfeited on his failure to complete, should appear as an asset. Perhaps no deposit was made. One wonders why. No statement is made as to when Mr. Moncrieff was appointed trustee in bankruptcy, but we infer that he was appointed on the retirement of the receiver in April, 1905. Mr. Richards' estimate of the value of the stock- in-trade and copyrights and publishing rights is amazing in view of the receipts, of else the receipts were insufficient. On this point, of course, one cannot be sure, but the value of the lease of 8, Smart's Buildings, could easily have been definitely ascertained. It is estimated at £700, but as no receipt on this asset appears the presumption is that it is valueless. Again, where does the £3,000, stated to have been lost owing to Mr. Moring's failure on the contract, appear in the statement ? We have no doubt that all these things can be fully explained ; at the same time it would have been more satisfactory had they been set out on this statement. Evidently in carrying on the business and also, it is possible, in accepting the debtor's estimate of value, lies the trustee's failure to produce better results. PRINTING AND PUBLISHING IN THE UNITED STATES IN 1905. [Reprinted from the United States Publisher*' Weekly.'] THE United States Bureau of the Census announces the publication of Bulletin 7'.). presenting the detailed statistics of the printing and publishing industry at the census of manufactures in 1905. The bulletin was prepared by William S. Kossiter, chief clerk of the census. The printing industry possesses an importance which cannot be measured by capital invested or by the volume and value of product. Analysis of the printer's calling has become to a noteworthy degree an analysis of the general prosperity of the nation. Therefore, interest in the progress and prosperity of printing is not confined to those who are connected with the industry, as is frequently the case with other callings, but is shared by the entire community. The total number of establishments in the printing industry in 1905 was 26,422, a number larger than was reported for any other industry. The increase reported from 1900 to 1905 forms a striking exception to the. prevailing tendency towards consolidation, for it was proportionately greater than from 1890 to 1900. Hence the pro- duct of this industry continues to be contributed by a great number of small establishments, accom- plishing noteworthy results with a small capital,, operated by men of independent thought and action, and contributing materially to the intel- lectual and financial growth of the country. The capital required in 1905 to conduct the printing and publishing business was $385,008, 604. It was approximately double that required in 1890, and it was doubtless due to a considerable degree to mechanical changes which have taken place in this industry during the past ten or fifteen years. The total value of products reported in 1905' was $496,061,357. During the brief period from 1900 to 1905 the increase in value of products was nearly double that from 1890 to 1900, or in absolute figures, $149,006,927 compared with $71,601,915. Had the per ca/nta value of products been the same in 1905 as in 1850, the entire value- of products of the industry would have been but 19 $52,007,588. On the other hand, had the per <api/«?production in 1850 been the same as it was in 11)05, the total value of products of the industry at the earlier census would have amounted to §141,470,444, or almost ten times as much as the actual amount recorded. Among the ten industries having value of pro- ducts in 11)05 exceeding $320,000,000, printing and publishing rank seventh, having advanced to that position from tenth in 1880. Printing and publishing reports one establishment to every 3,076 inhabitants, while at the opposite extreme is iron and steel, which contributes but one establish- ment to every 134,000 inhabitants. Of the total number of establishments in the entire industry, about one-third were exclusively book and job establishments, one-sixth exclusively newspapers and periodical establishments, and over one-half were combination establishments — that is, producing both book and job printing and news- papers and periodicals.
