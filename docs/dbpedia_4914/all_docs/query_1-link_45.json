S. A. by the University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles\n\nAll rights reserved PRINTED IN SPAIN FOR THE DOLPHIN BOOK CO. LTD., OXFORD, BY TIPOGRAFlA MODERNA, VALENCIA\n\nINTRODUCTION I:\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nFundamental\n\nconsiderations\n\nTHE field of Catalan lyric poetry is wide and varied, and its history has been a long one. This particular anthology was compiled in order to bring together its essentials rather than to provide a representative selection; my criterion was personal throughout, my choice being based upon my own reactions to the poems I read. When any poem succeeded in imposing its self-sufficiency upon me, then I felt that it had proved the perpetuation of its motive force. A poem at rest contains, just like a stone or a metal, latent energy which can be freed by the intervention of the reader. Once this has been released, its static framework should vanish, and its essence become as alive as it was when the poem was first composed. If any poem is to continue to be valid \"poetry\", then its powers of enchantment must persist in just that way. When properly approached such poems can resurrect their poets and revive a world which had seemed lost. A passion, a sorrow, silence —or a darting glance— come back into existence as they were at the moment when the poet abstracted them from reality to endow them with another, more enduring, life. That transfiguration was what I sought when making my selection, be[VII]\n\nINTRODUCTION cause I felt that no poem could lack it and still be effective poetry today. I therefore excluded such whole periods and genres as could make no contribution to the essential message which any poetry contains for all mankind, in so far as it is the synthesis of any people's personality. Much that I omitted was by no means lacking in poetic merit nor, still less, in art; but I was concerned with something else, and it was essential that nothing should be allowed to confuse the issue. This anthology became more homogeneous as a result of my approach. It gained, indeed, a certain timelessness, for a living community of experience became apparent in poems from every age. Arbitrary divisions into epochs had to -disappear because they seemed absurd, and all that was left was a subtle process of internal evolution, embodied —with all its surprises, its sorrows, its feelings, and its disillusionments— by successive schools of style. One gains a composite vision of Man-upon-Earth at the heart of it all, an Adam growing up and growing older with Mankind; when centuries in the life of a people are seen as though they were decades in the life of this single Man, his growth is slow but steady, devoid of any seemingly abrupt upheavals. T h e poetry which I have brought together constitutes a synthesis of man's experience, and seeks to present the reader with nothing more nor less than the history of humankind in Catalonia at its deepest, at its most significant, and at its least refutable. When used to designate the area where Catalan is spoken, \"Catalonia\" reaches from the French plains at the foot of the Pyrenees down to the coastal plains on the South-Eastern edge of the Iberian Pe[VIII\n\n]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nninsula. It is a narrow and a hilly land, which pivots upon the Balearic Isles, and has been bountiful throughout its history. The Greeks barely touched upon its shores, nor did the Carthaginians leave much impression, but Catalonia was drawn into the Roman empire when this was at the height of its glory. After the Romans left, the latinised inhabitants had to resist Barbarian incursions from the North, and later they succumbed before the Moors, yet these left little trace north of the Ebro. Levantine traders were also amongst the diverse elements which formed the Catalan race, whilst Goths and Franks —who had come to raid but stayed to be assimilated— linked Catalonia firmly to Carolingian Europe as the centre of culture withdrew from Rome towards the North and West to make the continent which we now know. The Catalan people and their language assumed their personality together. The greatest civilising force was the Church, which sponsored the first attempts at literature and dominated all the decorative arts; the growing splendour of the monasteries led, in its own way, towards the growth of the courtly institutions which evolved around the earldoms of which Catalonia was composed. Catalonia faced the sea, with islands and coast protecting it against the Moorish corsairs. Landwards it was linked to Aragon, in whose expanse the force of kingdoms which evolved upon the central tableland was spent before it could impinge upon the Catalans. T h e y held both sides of the P y renees, which enabled them to contribute to the diffusion of Provençal culture, and they fought a losing battle to incorporate the entire heritage of [IX]\n\nINTRODUCTION all the \"langue d'Oc\". When they were obliged to give up this attempt b y the death of King Pere \"the Catholic\" at the battle of Muret, in 1 2 1 3 the Catalans turned their attention to the sea. T h e y made the Mediterranean their fief b y unremitting conquests which led them to Greece, island by island, during the course of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries. Landwards, however, the relentless pressure of the Peninsula weighed heavily on Aragon, and the Catalans were unable to dissociate themselves from Castile after royal marriage had linked them together in 1469. T h e people of this land, which had been so rich in its own being, so noble and firm in its laws, became a silent, sullen folk. T h e y punctuated their prolonged subjection by fierce revolts, often provoked by very minor aggravations of their lot when greater ones had been ingenuously accepted; once up in arms they proved tenacious in resistance, however hopeless their case might seem to be. B y the time the full Renaissance came, the Catalans were too spent to recognise the changes afoot in Europe. T h e y had been ousted from the Mediterranean by the Ottoman power, and denied free access to the N e w World beyond the ocean by Castile. T h e great nations were formed without their participation, and Catalonia's art and speech •—its very being— lay dormant. Only the humbler folk stood by their language, keeping its spirit alive. Once the Bourbon monarchy was on the wane, the Catalan tongue rediscovered its tradition and its soul. Catalonia had regained free access to sea trade, commerce flourished, and as the Catalans found their rightful place amongst progressive peoples\n\n[x]\n\nINTRODUCTION great men were born amongst them once again, men of genius and of action, law-givers, and poets with a message to convey. It took less than a century for Catalonia to regain all the vigour it had had before the decadence began, three centuries before. Poetry, voice as always of a people's soul, has revealed this reawakening far more fully than tangible achievements, and more truly than the fluctuations of Catalonia's freedom and material prosperity. Such is the matter of this book, which also deals with the birth, life, death, and resurrection, of a literature whose history has been distinct in several ways from that of all the other Romance languages. Rarely has a country's decadence involved its literature to such a great extent, and yet the Renaixenga has been one of the most remarkable revivals in literary history. This vitality can only be explained by the latent persistence of essential values, precisely those things which had been involved in the apparent disappearance of Catalan personality. T h e language proved stronger than the circumstances which had brought it so near to annihilation. All this can most clearly be seen when studying the lyric poetry of Catalonia, which is the purest and most transcendental embodiment of its tongue. Language\n\nand\n\nthemes\n\nCatalonia's poets have always tended towards theocentric humanism, appealing constantly to a standard of values which, being high above the surface turmoil of events, enabled them to view this in perspective. At times they have been well in advance of their day, groping towards future truths which [XI]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthey could not know they were prefiguring; at other moments they have looked backwards, spanning a gap of centuries to re-evoke tradition. During those dark years anonymous bards had kept that flame of poetry alive, embodying their bitterness in songs which had an inner, vital meaning for the folk who treasured them. The poets have consistently exemplified that Catalan ability to bring order out of strange, dispersed, conflicting elements —the best defence for such a frontier people—, but in this they have merely played their part in the collective task of keeping a firm foothold in space and in time. Their theocentric humanism, their vision and their genius were merely facets of the national soul. They were facets which assisted its survival, by furthering Catalonia's capacity for a constant and organic evolution in which essentials have been renewed, but never lost, because it has always proved adaptable without becoming subject to distortion. This constant \"Humanism\" has always been the most decisive mark of the Catalan poetic outlook; it is a force which has moved the people as much as it has moved creative artists, although it may have moved them in different ways when for a time the two pursued two separate paths. Catalonia's culture is wholly Mediterranean; it is due in part to the natural reactions of a people confronted with such a country, robust yet delicate, and infinitely varied even in the immediacy of its appeal. Whenever her poets have endeavoured to convey this landscape directly —without confusing its reality by intellectualising it away— they have been moved so deeply by it that they transformed it into a very real constituent part of life. Man has [XII]\n\nINTRODUCTION always been their protagonist, yet they have found him as much in the fullness of surrounding nature —in its sober elegance and clear-cut knowledge of the Golden Mean— as in Mankind itself. Both the form and content of Catalan poetry have constantly been marked by these same traits, and the precious approach has been as rare as the wilfully capricious one, or as the pursuit of intricate elaboration as an end in itself. There has always been something virginal about the Catalan tongue, something of a wholly artistic rapture which has sought to create a poetic language not to be applied to mundane ends. It is perhaps true to say, of course, that no tongue save Ancient Greek has ever had such a natural predisposition towards poetry, and it is as a consequence of this that Catalan poets have generally remained unhampered by any formal rhetoric, since, they never required one in order to achieve a \"poetic\" form of expression. Furthermore, its banishment from all official usage, and lack of cultivation by uninspired professionals of verse for centuries, preserved it from that standardisation of topics, phrases and clìchés to which both those employments lead. This demanded a constancy of the creative urge from which poets might otherwise have been exempt but it did so without obliging them to seek the recondite, since words in daily use had never been devalued by professional abuse. The possession of such a vehicle —a vital and a vivifying tongue moulded by an alert and intelligent people— has meant that Catalan poets have never been under any need to seek individualisation through the mere differentiation of technique. Instead, they have tended to cultivate a very limited gamut of poetic [XIII ]\n\nINTRODUCTION forms throughout long periods of their creative lives, if not throughout a whole career. T h e y would achieve perfection in these forms quite early, but rather than change them, they would constantly repeat them, without remission, because they wished to stress the message and not some novelty in their technique. Form and content have always been kept in equilibrium, and a constant stress upon the need to justify the former by the latter has avoided the superficiality which attends upon the exaltation of words for their own sake. These three characteristics, extreme economy in use of words, sobriety, and simplicity of structure, have persisted in Catalan poetry down to the present day. A constant impulse towards universality of appeal has also been at work alongside those three deep-rooted stylistic aspects of the tongue; it corresponds to other facets of the organic growth of Catalan. Complete romanisation served not merely to contribute towards the amalgam which became a national temperament, but also to pave the w a y for the appearance of Christianity and to intensify the fervour with which it was welcomed when it came. Religious sentiments are a theme which broadens the appeal of poets, and since there has rarely been a land in which Christianity became so deeply part of a people's soul, religious inspiration has been responsible for much poetry in Catalonia. T h e devotion of the poets has been, at heart, that of the people as a whole, a healthy and a popular devotion, realistic, resilient and full of hope. Theirs is a Franciscan vision of Christianity, whose devotion is part source and part product of a loving communion with nature, and of a frank admiration for the beauty of [xiv ]\n\nINTRODUCTION a world which has endeared itself to them from childhood. A graceful and a noble piety, part of their Latin heritage, becomes apparent in every aspect of their life. F e w of the major poets have failed to turn to G o d ; they have sought His aid when confronted b y the mysteries of existence, turning to Him as much f o r an explanation of phenomena as for help when troubled by doubt. Yet they have rarely risen to mystic heights; they seem bound down b y their humility, and by a certain restraint which is almost a sense of shame. Far from seeking G o d b y the abstruse paths of metaphysical speculation, or by turning their imagination inward, they have sought Him in the Beauty and in the Reason of N a ture. Seen in divine tranquillity, the world is very beautiful; and the loveliness of their own land led them to prayer. Llull ( i 2 3 3 ? - i 3 1 5 ? ) and Verdaguer (1845-1902), both Catalans, were two of the greatest religious poets of the Western World. Although six centuries apart, they spoke with G o d in the same tongue, not just with the selfsame G o d but in the selfsame w a y . Theirs was no abstract mysticism, because their preoccupation with humanity linked them too closely to the earth f o r them to forget their own condition. This tense limitation on transcendence underlies all their most significant poems. Religious inspiration has also led the Catalans to meditate on death, and to write much poetry about its transcendental aspect; they have never seen it as an event which ends with itself. Because of the vital urge of their communion with external nature, death proved the most painful of all subjects; yet their sincerity, and the realism of their cult of life, prevented lapses into mock heroics or vain evasions [xv]\n\nINTRODUCTION of the issue. T h e elegiac mood, with all the grave loveliness contained in that nostalgic sentiment, was born of this conflict, and grew with it. T h e r e was also human love under its many aspects. Conjugal and paternal love, and patriotism, proved sources of valid poetic inspiration thanks to the simplicity with which they were expressed and the intensity with which the poet viewed his feelings. This intensity made their formulation strangely intimate, as intimate as that of lovers' love itself. T h e great poets of the Middle Ages phrased that sentiment with violence, as though their verses were the outcome of some sombre and heart-rending progress of the soul. T h e i r protest was majestic, full of grandeur, devoid of pettiness, magnificent in an autonomous nobility which already held something of the Renaissance. T h e y sought no sublimation of their feelings b y theology or b y romanticism, but endeavoured to convey the impact of their passion b y the fullest possible assertion of the Beloved. She was always a very real person, loved for her defects as much as for her virtues, because the mediaeval lyricist knew no cleavage between his ideal and a woman of flesh and blood such as marks the passion of the modern Catalan poet. Modern love lyrics may be coloured b y the physical or b y the spiritual aspect of love, but have never handled both these aspects of the Beloved at once since the romantic period began. Nevertheless, W o m a n exerts an even deeper influence today than in the Middle Ages. It is a subtler one, less explicitly confessed, responsible for a strange purposiveness within the poet, which seems to disquiet him obscurely at every level on which his vision moves. Modern Catalan lyricism\n\n[xvi ]\n\nINTRODUCTION holds an element of mystery which it had lacked before, and which derives from this fresh consciousness of woman. T h e troubling immanence of death in life, apprehended in those partial glimpses of Truth which form the total vision of the poet, now overshadows love with a sense of doom. T h e modern Catalan poet is also confronted by fresh problems. Poets elsewhere have met them, but perhaps they assail the Catalan with even greater force as a result of the peculiar history which poetry has had in Catalonia. T h e answers to these problems are generally implicit in the questions they pose, but the answers themselves are such that the problems cannot be resolved in spite of this. There is a basic conflict between the poet and society, at every level —from that of the family to that of mankind as a whole. This conflict cannot be understood without analysing the modern poet's vision. This is coloured by a far clearer sense of personal solitude in the face of Creation than ever there was amongst the mediaeval poets, which may be the result of the lack of any stable sense of values or of the materialistic w a y in which Western civilisation has recently developed. A clear-cut consciousness, reasoned as much as intuitive, of what the poet's aims should be, and of conflict between these and the tangible frustrations he encounters, have intensified the anguish of such solitude. Poets will often soliloquise as though there was no-one to hear, tending more and more to escape into the lyrical joys of sheer word-magic and the suggestiveness of images and moods. Yet this holds none of that Northern fancy which fills its dreams with metaphysical figures conjured up from its imagination. [ xvii\n\n] 2\n\nINTRODUCTION The Catalan poet's creative experience results from the impact of the concrete world upon his sensibility; still impeding ascent to heights of mysticism, it pervades him whenever he encounters love or senses that immanence of death in life. Far from conflicting with the older modes of vision, this new perspective has joined the earlier themes as though it were their complementary. This violent reaction against solitude has created a new, but parallel, poetic attitude which blends life and poetry together. It is the attitude of a poet moving subjectively, in a world of dreams within his mind, striving to understand himself as much as external reality. Modern Catalan poetry is very conscious of the discovery of this additional dimension in the poet's world. Foreign\n\ninfluences\n\nOne can, in part, explain Catalan poetic development in terms of foreign influence. Whenever free, Catalonia proved the channel whereby this entered the Peninsula. Whenever subject to Castile, however, the schools of thought and movements of opinion which flourished in the rest of Europe could produce none save a very delayed reaction. The various phases through which this poetry has passed thus correspond to the changing circumstances of Catalan history. Of the three major influences before the Renaixença, the first and most powerful was that of Provence, the second that of Italy, and the third, the Castilian which coincided with the decadence. Catalan poetry was evoked by Provençal; the earliest verses written in Catalonia were in proven[ xvi11]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nçalised Romance, and in two centuries approximately thirty salient poets born in Catalonia wrote only in Provençal. This was, for them, an artificial language, but they considered it to be the poetic tongue par excellence because it had been evolved as« a poetic medium by a great school of poets. Other fashions from the North —from France— were blended with the Provençal by these Catalans, who made important contributions to the splendour of the greatest school of poetry which Europe had know since Virgil and Horace. The political influence which Catalonia exerted on Provence was as great as the linguistic influence of Provençal on Catalan, so that when Provence was destroyed by Simon de Montfort the lands were firmly linked not merely by their poetry and by the kinship between their languages but also by strong ties of blood and of tradition. As a result of this, the influence of the troubadours persisted longer in Catalonia than in any other literature which had encountered it, although Provençal had become almost as much a universal tongue in poetry as Latin was for every other purpose, reaching as far afield as England when at the height of its power. All except the religious genres of Catalan poetry were once wholly subject to Provence. Italian influence reigned as supreme, in its turn, but this did not inhibit individuality in any way. Italian trends displaced the Provençal with the coming of the Renaissance, ending the dull traffic which mediocre poets made out of a dead tradition, and Petrarchan Humanism was the first renaissance current to be felt. It also left the deepest mark upon the Catalans, influencing all the greatest fifteenth century poets. [xix]\n\nINTRODUCTION T h e y displayed so vigorous a personality in their developments that they themselves influenced the whole Peninsula and Western European culture. These outstanding figures were the men from V a lencia, in the South. They were the best exponents of their innovations, and the influence of Italy which they incorporated and transformed died only with the decadence of Catalonia. The Castilian influence, which first began to be generally felt in literature at about that time, was an effect of that decadence, not a fresh source of inspiration. It met no resistance, it brought no new vitality, and its results are of no value now whether they be viewed from Catalonia or Castile. Matters would have been quite different had the case been similar to that of Provençal, and had poets writing in Castilian formed a school which could contribute to Castilian literature, but this time a foreign influence led to virtual silence. The impact of another language on the mere remnants of a literature proved overwhelming, and the Catalans made no valid use of the new medium. Poetry only survived amongst the humbler people, who always wrote in Catalan. Apart from the anonymous ballads, whose corpus forms the Cançoner, no truly great poem was written by a Catalan from the end of the Italian phase until the influence of Castilian had begun to recede: Aribau's La pàtria (1833), in Catalan once more, heralded the Renaixença. This was to be the consequence of many interacting factors, some of which came into being when Catalan autonomy was first suppressed. The movement really began when Barcelona surrendered to the French and Spanish armies in- 1714, after a lengthy siege; subjection gave Ca[xx]\n\nINTRODUCTION talonia that strength which those who have been wronged and humbled can derive from their suffering. Although these feelings are reflected in the ballads, they had to wait for full poetic expression until the Renaixenga, in the Nineteenth Century. The weakening of the central power, improved economic conditions which enriched Catalonia, the impact of Romanticism, and the encyclopaedic tendencies of learned thought, all helped to renew the vitality of a language preserved by the people and the Church. Combining with that sense of community in suffering, these produced the Renaixenga itself. The reappearance of poetry gave the Renaixenga its self-confidence, becoming the very symbol of its strength. The poets of the new Catalan renaissance were influenced by Sir Walter Scott, by French Romantics like Chateaubriand, and by such Italians as Manzoni, Alfieri and Fascolo, and subsequently by Carducci and Leopardi. All these were apt sources for a romantic cult of the past which fostered Catalonia's longing for a return to freedom and past greatness. The Castilian influence was soon eliminated, because the substitution of Catalan for Spanish was the first requirement of this new poetry, but it did exert a certain braking effect upon development during the early years. Even so, the last few major figures to write in Castilian contributed towards the preparation for the Renaixenga in other ways; some of them were men of great personality, like Cabanyes, and not even the use of a foreign medium could mask the wholly Catalan orientation of what they had to say. Although this fact may earn them praise as true precursors of the Renaixenga, it redu[xxi ]\n\nINTRODUCTION ced the intrinsic merit of their works ; these no longer lay within the true channel of Castilian development but yet belong to Castilian literature by virtue of their medium. Had these men but lived a few years later and written in Catalan, their works would then have gained them the fame which their abilities deserved. Although Provençal was re-asserting its own independence, it had little influence on the Renaixença because the movement of the Felibrige lagged behind. French and Italian influences on the other hand continued to be fruitful sources of inspiration throughout the first phase, and do still play their part in Catalan development today. Once the revival had achieved stability,7 then individuals were able to examine foreign literature with a more critical approach. The major German poets were then discovered one by one, and each made his own contribution towards the growth of the new Catalan poetic consciousness. The first to be read were Nietzsche and Novalis, and then Goethe. The latter's influence was to remain, even after the first two had been superseded by Rilke, and Rilke, in turn, by a deepening interest in Hôlderlin. A complementary of this Germanic trend was a revived interest in the Classical World, which wove Horatian and Virgilian themes and attitudes into the reborn humanism of the Catalans. Greece came into prominence more recently, but stirred the poets far more deeply. The vigour of this Hellenism, and its fruitfulness as a source of modern poetic inspiration, appears to be a unique phenomenon today; at no time since the original New Learning of the Renaissance has such a clas[ XXIi ]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsical phase proved so stimulating. Modern Catalan poetry required such a phase of classicism after its romantic period, although restraint is so instinctive to the Catalan that one can perceive a certain innate classicism of form throughout romanticism. The Hellenistic influence was indirect at first, being drawn from Italy; but the next steps were easy and one found romantic content being gradually canalised by an increasingly classical logic of thought and form. The best productions of this phase are far from dead or second-hand; their Hellenism is less a matter of details than an atmosphere which filters through and in between the more characteristic features of modern verse without distorting them or minimising their significance, and it has thus proved to be one of the most beneficial influences which Catalan poetry has ever undergone. There is still something virginal and serene about Catalan poetry today which is a direct fruit of this interaction of the Greek and the Germanic during the Nineteenth Century; Goethe, for whom the Mediterranean held so romantic an appeal, had led the w a y with Winckelmann towards this rediscover y of the Greek world—although the Catalans were a Southern people they yet had to view their sea through Northern eyes before they could apprehend its full poetic message. Once the new poets had found some self-reliance and reincorporated the classical heritage, they began to return to their own Catalan predecessors, the poets of the Middle Ages and the Fifteenth Century. They were most deeply influenced by these in their love lyrics and in the forms and general tone of their verse, but the religious and mystical production of the Middle Ages [\n\nXXIII]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nhas also played a considerable part in the development of modern religious poetry. The popular ballads have had more influence upon the form of modern verse than on its content. As the perspective shortens so does the scene become less easy to portray with clarity. Stabilisation of the new Catalan poetic vision has given it a greater capacity for understanding foreign movements and making an apt choice amongst them, bringing very diverse reactions. This was only to be expected in a land which had always been sensitive to foreign influences; but its result has been a bewildering eclecticism whose major sources have included not only modern English poetry but Shakespeare, Keats, and Pater, the more recent Castilians like Jorge Guillén and Federico Garcia Lorca, and all the French schools of poetry since Mallarmé. Germanic and Hellenic influences have not, however, ceased to play their part. It must also be borne in mind that none of these latest fashions has had so marked an effect as any of those which were felt in the course of the Nineteenth Century, or during the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Decadence. There is less of a communal subservience to fashion than of a series of personal debts to individual foreign poets, and specific poems have had a greater impact than specific abstract doctrines. Each modern Catalan has come under influences which he has made his own and has contributed towards the general vision of his day. Modern Catalan poetry has shown sufficient vitality to maintain its independence, selecting such elements as it found meaningful and incorporating these without degenerating into a mere reflection of some foreign source. It also displays certain marked[ xxiv ]\n\nINTRODUCTION ly national characteristics which have survived in spite of wars and centuries of decadence, and all the major facets of the earlier poetry are still to be discerned. There is that same sincerity and humanising zeal, that same economy of words, that same classical —yet intimate— austerity which moulds the poet's thought and is the secret of that magical Catalan poetic atmosphere. The survival of these qualities is a tribute to the vitality of the language. Exiled from official usage for whole centuries, often persecuted, it has nevertheless maintained its unity and its linguistic area, if one includes Valencian and Majorcan. Writers and grammarians could take up the language as they found it and adapt it to meet all modern needs, including the translation of Greek, Latin and Biblical texts and foreign literatures. T h e y gave it an elegance, a solidity and yet a flexibility which have made it as fine a vehicle for all forms of literary expression as any other language of today. Thanks to the survival of the medium employed, Catalan poetry was able to regain continuity despite the decadence. II:\n\nT H E MIDDLE AGES A N D\n\nTHE\n\nRENAISSANCE The Catalan\n\nTroubadours of the• Joes\n\nand the School\n\nFlorals\n\nTHE first Catalan lyric was written almost nine hundred years ago. Based upon a Latin poem which had itself been written in Catalonia, the Cango de Santa Fe was composed between 1054 and 1076 in a language still so primitive and fluid that critics long [ xxv ]\n\nINTRODUCTION held it to be Provençal. T h e y have n o w adjudged it Catalan, however rudimentary the differentiation of the t w o m a y have been, but the f a c t that such a controversy could arise shows h o w closely Catalan poetry was related to that of the tongues b e y o n d the Pyrenees f r o m its inception. T h e religious nature of the subject marks the first appearance of one of the major streams of Catalan poetic inspiration. T h i s poem displays a remarkable degree of perfection in both f o r m and content, y e t it probably antedates the Castilian Cantar del Mío Cid b y a century at least. If certain obscure references are accepted, then the first Catalan troubadours also belonged to the second half of the Eleventh Century, but w h a t we n o w k n o w as the Catalan School of T r o u b a d o u r Poetry can be m o r e accurately said t o have begun towards the end of the T w e l f t h . S o m e thirty notew o r t h y poets of v e r y varied character and genius w r o t e in Provençal, but the stream of anonymous poems on popular and on religious themes continued to develop in the vernacular amongst the people. H a d the case been one of two neighbouring tongues which differed w i d e l y and had developed side b y side, then this peculiar position could never have come about, but —strange though this dichotomy m a y seem— it can be explained b y the close kinship between Catalan and Provençal. T h e latter was bound to exert a strong influence over the cultured poets of the other land in view of its more advanced development as a medium of civilised expression. Such samples of popular and religious p o e t r y as have survived, and they are very f e w and far between, are hard to date precisely. T h e r e is a charming straight[ xxvi ]\n\nINTRODUCTION forwardness about the timidity with which these anonymous poets sought to express their emotions in such works as the Plany de la Verge, the Plant de Sant Esteve and the Balada de la Verge Maria, and in the more vigorous and forceful Virolai de Montserrat (or de Madona Santa Maria). About the beginning of the Fourteenth Century this popular religious genre came under the influence of the troubadours, most notably that of Cerveri de Girona, and its pristine sincerity succumbed to an excessive cultivation of the artificialities of troubadour technique during the transitional stage between the decadence of Provençal and the birth of a truly national literature in Catalonia. Not merely the host of anonymous poets but also such figures as Dalmau de Castellnou, Pere de Vilademany, Fra Ugo (the Prior of Ripoll), King Jaume II, Jofre de Foixà, the Chaplain of Bolquera and Queen Constança of Mallorca, displayed a certain vacillation in their style which marked the uneasy gropings of Catalan in search of lyrical autonomy. There were two major influences in this phase : the religious strain of popular verse on the one hand, and the markedly profane inspiration of the troubadours on the other. Many of the Catalan courtiers who wrote their verse in Provençal right up to the end of the Thirteenth Century, although with an ever increasing number of Catalan elements intruding as the years went by, were highly vigorous and vital personalities. They made their own original contributions to poetry throughout the uninterrupted progress from pure Provençal towards a language which was Provençal only in so far as certain terms and words were still part of the Catalan poetic lexicon. [ xxvn ]\n\nINTRODUCTION A t one time or another the Catalan troubadours employed the whole range of metres invented by those of Provence, but they displayed a greater tendency towards uniformity of pattern, coupled with a more natural approach to content and a more marked desire to be sincere. T h e y preferred the trobar plan, a clear uncomplicated style derived from common usage, to that cultivation of obscurantist exclusive ness which was embodied in the trobar clus, and they were also distinguished by a deeper preoccupation with the meaning of what they wrote. Furthermore, they first made patriotism as important as religion in their poetry. Although they cannot be numbered amongst the Catalan poets because they wrote in Provençal, there are some who should be mentioned here because they stood out amongst the finest of the troubadours, such as Count Ramon Berenguer V of Barcelona (King of Aragon as Alfons II), who lived in the second half of the Twelfth Century, his contemporaries Guillem de Cabestany and Guerau de Cabrera, Guillem de Bergadà, who probably died at the beginning of the Thirteenth Century, Arnau the Catalan, Pere the Great, and Cerveri de Girona. Guillem de Bergadà was one of the most popular of troubadours, yet one of the most Catalan of those who wrote in Provençal. The death of Cerveri de Girona in 1280 marked the beginning of the decay of Provençal as a poetic medium in Catalonia. North of the Pyrenees, this decay had begun more than half a century before with the death of King Pere, the Catholic, w h o had been both an ardent Catalan and a poet in his own right. The influence of Provence and France gained a [ xxvi11]\n\nINTRODUCTION fresh lease of life during the Fourteenth Century as a result of the foundation of the \"Sobregaia Companyia dels Set T r o b a d o r s \" at Toulouse. A group of Catalans who frequently competed at its J o e s Florals gathered round King Pere the Ceremonious to foster a similar but autonomous movement in Catalonia. This achieved its own expression in the Floral Games of Barcelona, modelled upon those of Toulouse, but the school of poets which grew up around these did not produce much work of great poetic merit. T h e historical importance of these J o e s Florals is considerable, because they kept Catalan poetry alive during the fifty years preceeding the Italian influence of the Renaissance. Religious in their inception, the Games soon became no more than a tourney of poetic art whose rich prizes (jewels, set in the shape of flowers) provoked an intensive cultivation of technique without evoking much true inspiration. T h e J o e s Florals also established the linguistic autonomy of Catalan as a poetic medium so securely that even translations from the Provençal were sometimes made. T h e refinement of technique may have been gained at the expense of sincerity, but at least it had attained a high degree of polish before the influence of Italy reached Catalonia. T o w a r d s the end of this period the poetic influence of the French provided a bridge between Provence and Italy which greatly helped Catalan comprehension of the new Italian measures, and it was these which were to be the primary factor in the next phase of Catalan poetic evolution. T h e charter authorising the institution of the Games had been signed by Joan I, who earned the title of Patron of Courtliness — Amador de la Genti[ xxix ]\n\nINTRODUCTION lésa— b y this act, and he had granted it to Jaume March ( 1 3 3 5 ? - ! 4 . . . ? ) . Already past the prime of life Jaume was to share the tasks of Master and Maintainer of the Games with another nobleman of note, but he continued as Maintainer well into the reign of Marti the Humane. His own poetry was almost completely impersonal —little more than a series of technical exercises upon the standard themes of Provençal tradition— and as much can be said of almost everything written b y this school. T h e works of his cousin Pere March ( 1 3 3 8 - 1 4 1 3 ? ) reveal a forceful mind, but he valued reasoning more highly than poetic qualities, and the bulk of what he wrote is only poetry because in verse, and only lends itself to formal criticism. Guillem de Masdovelles was also one of a family of poets. He himself belonged completely to the schools of Barcelona and Toulouse, but his nephew Joan Berenguer de Masdovelles (14...-1467?) was already a man of the Renaissanc e ; uncle and nephew held prolonged discussions upon literary topics. Another interesting figure of the period was Llorenç Mallol, of the Tolosan School, because one of the religious poems which he presented at Toulouse bears an apparently remarkable resemblance to a love lyric b y Petrarch. Both Catalan and Italian owed debts to a common source, a poem by the troubadour Bertran de B o r n ; but Mallol's poem is nonetheless the first sign of the passing of an age, in spite of Provençal sensuality and its lack of Petrarchan subtlety. In the course of time, French influence displaced the Provençal in the Joes Florals. This can be clearly seen from the works of Lluis de Vilarrasa and Arnau March (who was either an uncle or a\n\n[ xxx ]\n\nINTRODUCTION cousin of Ausiás), both deeply indebted to Guillem de Machaut. Their poetry became more agile in consequence, and a little more sincere; Lluís de Vilarrasa introduced the ballade and employed it with heightened lyricism, whilst Arnau March gained a new sense of variety by introducing lines of different length into a single poem. Grave at all times, but at his gravest in religious verse, the latter always burnished his lines to perfection. These two were the last poets of note belonging to that Northern school which had persisted, under one form or another, from the first inception of literary Catalan well into the Fifteenth Century; with the Renaissance the centre of cultural activity shifted Southwards to Valencia. In the meantime the popular cultivation of poetry had continued, still chiefly on religious themes. It was more closely related to the growth of other literary genres in the vernacular than the cultured poetry of the J o e s Florals could ever be because the men who produced it had obtained their direct experience of \"literature\" through attendance at the Mystery Plays, through social satires and political invective, songs of every kind, and the gay or solemn chants of the liturgical calendar, and through their cultivation of the art of story-telling. This art preserved poems, legends and fables, transmitting its vitality to all prose-writers, most especially to those who cultivated the popular genres. T h e Catalan poetry which we can study is chiefly that of cultured circles, due to the problems of transmission and survival; this continued to evolve apart from popular taste and unaffected by its fluctuations, but the forcefulness and rich variety of prose written [ xxxi ]\n\nINTRODUCTION with a popular appeal proves how deeply the life of the people was affected by mediaeval literature. Poetry grew from the people and gave them a means of self-expression, whilst clergy and aristocracy alike participated in the tempestuous interplay of passions which marked the later Middle Ages. As much literature was written in this troubled atmosphere as in the tranquillity of cloistered cells or by ascetic Scholars. Ramon\n\nLlull\n\nRamon Llull ( i z 3 3 ? - i 3 i 5 ? ) does not fit into this picture. H e is an isolated figure who must be considered on his own, with just the bare framework of ideas needed to fit him into the pattern of his age. Outstanding in every way, he cannot be placed in that strict line which leads uninterruptedly from the first troubadour to the last poet of the decadence, and yet he is perhaps the finest example of that fusion between literature and populace characteristic of the Catalan genius. The decline of Provence had already begun in Ramon Llull's d a y ; Jaume I had abandoned the rights of his line to Languedoc and to Provence itself, and had turned instead to strengthen Catalonia by the reconquest of Mallorca and Valencia from the Moors. T h e Occitanian phase of Catalan foreign policy was over and the literary influence of Provençal was on the wane; Catalan nationalism produced its own literature, and this grew up around the Chronicles and around the works of Ramon Llull himself. Llull's isolation enhances the merits of his w o r k ; he neither followed nor founded a school, although he began his poetic [ xxxii]\n\nINTRODUCTION career as a courtier in Mallorca, cultivating verse as a mere exercise of wit. After his conversion he destroyed his earlier work, to use poetry as a medium for passionate self-expression; his subsequent works (and none of the earlier ones survives) are all so personal and so bound up with his immediate aims that all he wrote or did came from within himself. Such influences as can be traced in his works do not represent the results of conscious selection but the inescapable climate of opinion in which he lived, imposed upon him in the same way as the history and actual climate of the land where he was born. T h e y were all facts not his to choose or to disown, but he was forceful in his adaptation of them to further his own ends. T h e insignificance of the influence which he exerted compared with the vastness of his output and the universality of all his aims is probably due to this very individualism; his legacy was never treated as it deserved to be, and although echoes of his philosophic thought can be distinguished up to the present day, his influence has always been a partial one, and only indirectly apprehended. Subsequent thinkers have never faced up to the full import of his reasoning, neither to refute it nor to take it further, almost as though they shrank away from the fieriness of all he did or wrote. H e has two claims to poetic greatness. Firstly, unpoetic though this may seem, having made effective use of poetry to further his own high aims. Secondly, having served the ends of poetry although such was not his purpose. Poetry sums up both these complementary facets of his grandeur, synthesizing a vital unity by its transcendence of the paradox. [\n\nx x x i i i ] 3\n\nINTRODUCTION T o state this is to affirm that Ramon Llull was a true and valid poet, small though the quantity of verse may be within the huge accumulation of his writings and in spite of the fact that his poetry remains quite on one side of the normal Catalan poetic evolution. T h e works of Ausias March (that other great mediaeval poet) and even those of certain secondary figures, on the other hand, represent definite stages in that evolution which cannot be ignored if it is to be understood. In his own day, Ramon Llull was never viewed as a poet, and this may have something to do with the neglect which his verse was accorded; vastly talented, he seemed an intruder into literary fields because he was the complete antithesis of the poetic academicians, with all their \"laws\" and treatises and formal gatherings, fashions and rigid schools. This unconventional freedom which he displayed sprang from the immense vitality behind his life and works, a dynamism which enabled him to remain untrammelled by shackles which would have fettered any normal writer. T h e quality of his verse demands a greater emphasis than merely quantitative assessment of the place it holds amongst his works would gain for it. T h e division between his lyrical and his didactic writings is far from being a clear and simple one. Neither branch of his production can be readily defined in terms of a neat and orderly series of characteristics, because all aspects of his life appear inextricably mixed in every part of his work. His poetry preserves its spontaneity, however dry the subject may occasionally be, thanks to the fact that his feeling for problems which are normally solved by reason alone was largely intuitive. Even in logic he [ xxxiv ]\n\nINTRODUCTION was less a scholar using a technique than a vehicle f o r this poetic intuition of reality. Lacking in artistry because he lacked the artist's concentration upon art, his complex genius lacked nothing essential to the poet. His internal conflict led him into reasoned folly, and he could curse as well as love ; he hated himself, as man, because he loved mankind. He was as much the poet in this as was Ausiàs March when inspired b y Woman or a woman, or Verdaguer inspired b y the poet's lyre or the priest's chalice. Llull felt himself marked out b y the finger of G o d from the time of his visions of Jesus on the Cross, which led to his conversion and remained without parallel even in his long and turbulent and holy life ; marked out by God, and henceforth unable to be a man just like any other. Nothing else could matter any more, and not even such external circumstances as lay at the heart of his age or formed the very framework of his life could move him greatly, and when all is said and done his place in time left very little mark on him. Granted that the influence of Provence was already declining, in politics and in the realm of poetry, but Ramon Llull was nonetheless contemporaneous with Cerveri de Girona ; no poet other than Llull was to be free from France or Provence f o r a further century after his death in 1 3 1 5 . N o r does it matter very much that his verse-forms and style, and even much of the conventional poetic imagery which he employed, were Provençal, nor even that provençalisms do at times appear in the language he employed f o r verse, because Llull not only enriched the forms he used but put them to very different ends, and used them in a greater variety than any\n\n[ xxxv ]\n\nINTRODUCTION other poet prior to the Renaixença. Provençalism of form had no effect upon the content of his verse, he was merely employing the only metres which had yet been elaborated in any Romance tongue. His use of Catalan, on the other hand, was a remarkable innovation ; the Catalan he used for verse was very often wholly free from Provençal contamination thanks to the very precise use which he had learnt to make of it in prose. He transposed the whole world of poetic imagery which he derived from Provence into another key, to use it on the plane of mysticism. This was, perhaps, a seemingly simple transposition, but it was a work of genius which left its mark upon all subsequent mystical writing in the Iberian Peninsula. Paradoxical though it may seem, such writings do thus owe a significant, if an indirect, debt to that world of courtly gallantry and overwrought profane frivolity for which the troubadours had written. Llull's best poetry was embodied in the three hundred and fifty-six versicles of which his Llibre d'amie e amat consists. Produced when he was at the height of his powers, this book was written during one of the periods in which he felt himself to be in closest touch with God; influences derived from Moslem Sufi mystics, from the Hebrew Song of Songs and from the Courtly Love of the Provençal troubadours, are fused into one transcendent paean upon this divine communion. Terms and images derived from these varied sources gained a new meaning and a fresh validity when they had been transfigured by his \"folly of love\", and he achieved that almost naive simplicity which marks the highest reaches of religious poetry. His lyricism transcended the specific [ xxxvi ]\n\nINTRODUCTION climate of belief within which he wrote because its magic was derived from eternal and undenominational poetic values, and he produced a work of universal import. His Christian inspiration was closely akin to that of St Francis of Assisi, and in being the first great Catalan exponent of Franciscanism, Ramon Llull was introducing a theme whose cultivation by Catalan poets was to grow progressively more fruitful. Its background was a landscape as ingenuous, as simple and as enchanting as his theme, and as pure as the Garden of Eden before the Fall. H e succeeded in infusing the sentiment of Nature with a fresh and vibrant life which truly anticipated the vitality of the renaissance vision of the world. N a ture is neither a background nor an allegory here, but has its own perspective, and the characters — G o d and the Soul— move inside it, not in front of it. T h e dramatic intensity of his desire for clear and perfect union with G o d produced a work whose deep sincerity has never been surpassed. Every thought appears to have been refined b y his love before it reached the surface, to be embodied in phrases whose words are, for the most part, very short but which become extraordinarily effective in their context. T h e y are blent into simple rhythms such as require to be learnt by heart, and once these had reached the paper his poet's task was done, and universal poetry achieved. But Llull himself took further agonising years in dying, torn by the anguish of his desire to save and to be saved whilst in this world. H e died without knowing that what would save him here on earth would be the supreme poetry which he had written. [ XXXVII ]\n\nINTRODUCTION Jordi de Sant Jordi and Ausias\n\nMarch\n\nThere was no figure comparable to that of Ramon Llull in all the period from the Eleventh to the Fifteenth Centuries; neither the schools of Toulouse and Barcelona nor even the school of Catalan troubadours produced a single poet of his stature. When a great prose-writer, Bernat Metge (1350?1412), wrote the first truly Renaissance work in Catalonia, Lo somni, at the very end of the Fourteenth Century, the works of Ramon Llull were fittingly amongst its many sources. Bernat Metge was a humanist, and the humanism of Italy which he introduced brought with it a renovation of old forms and a fresh vitality which proved so powerful that the transition from the poetry of the Joes Florals to the school of Dante and of Petrarch took very f e w years. Andreu Febrer and the Valencians Jordi de Sant Jordi (1395?-i43o?) and Ausias March (1397-1459) were courtiers and soldiers, and Andreu Febrer's translation of the Commedia (which preserves the terza rima) was written in intervals between the wars in which they fought. Between them they created what is now known as the Renaissance School, the last —but by far the most important— of the schools of poetry before the decadence, and one which yet owed much to its native predecessors in spite of its italianising. Somewhat later came Roig de Corella (142.-1500) whose noble gravity marked the last important facet of the period ; he too was a Valencian. Jordi de Sant Jordi's varied but scanty poems survive in the anthologies which he compiled. Their [ xxxvi 1 1 ]\n\nINTRODUCTION universal appeal is due to the delicacy of his restraint and to the subtle way in which his language blended the distant with the passionate in his lovelyrics. He was the first great poet to come decisively under the influence of the Petrarchan mode of thought—until lately scholars had even maintained that the debt was one of Petrarch to Jordi de Sant Jordi. The power of his personality and his own intellectual stature combined to save him both from the danger of being dwarfed by the greatness of his master and from being the residuary legatee of the decaying Provençal school, although he still employed much which was in the manner of the earlier fashions. He was far from being servile in his imitations, and took the troubadour Montaudon for model in his Ennigs with a deliberate maliciousness which was extremely humanistic in its freedom. He similarly modified the lines he borrowed for his Passio d'amor to fit them better to his purpose, avoiding naming sources which erudite readers would be expected to perceive. This particular work attests once again to the importance of the Provençal tradition by the way in which it draws upon the fund of troubadour poetry as though upon the classics ; this did indeed then take the place the classics held in other European literatures, and Jordi de Sant Jordi neither rejected it nor succumbed to it. Both the form and content of his poems embodied things which were new to Catalonia. Much of his technique was Petrarchan, and he was a Petrarchan in the way in which he derived from his own experience all the poetry which it might hold. The sequence of his few remaining poems gives one an abstract of his life and the love-lyrics dedicated [ xxxix ]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nto Isabel are indeed amongst the most moving and sincere of the genre. He tells us little about her —only such details as emerge from the few references made to the ideal which she embodied for him— because he never attempted to record the vision which he always carried in his mind. Yet this figure of a woman is not an abstraction but a very concrete point of reference to which he related all he had to say, an ideal whose presence permeates his poetry as though foreshadowing some imminent revelation. His deliberate self-effacement has an underlying violence which makes each rigidly controlled avowal peal through the grave atmosphere in which his poems move. They are free from worn philosophies, drawing their strength instead both from eternal themes —which he expressed with classical simplicity— and from the matter of his daily life: the anguish of love, farewells, absence and longing, the chastening realities of circumstance, and the intrusiveness of death. When he addressed the king from an Italian prison to which the war had brought him, he did so in a spirit of high chivalry which enabled him to draw comfort from his very sufferings—but none from the prospect of becoming reconciled to Catalan defeat. He also wrote his Estramps to his beloved there, basing one of the richest and most moving of all Catalan poems on an appeal to past experience shared, exalting love until his personal emotions attained not only dignity and greatness but truly universal meaning. He wrote in lines whose clarity would half delude one into thinking it simplicity but which were always polished until their definitive form appears inevitably just; he had a technique of ennobling words [XL]\n\nINTRODUCTION by isolating them in order to employ the fullness of their meaning, placing them where that would be driven home by the measures of his verse. Its tone was grave in its warmth and vehemence, endowing the very pauses it imposed between the lines with vibrant life until the whole seems elegiac in its stateliness. One would take Jordi de Sant Jordi for a forerunner of Ausias March rather than for his contemporary because of the way in which the latter's genius makes his poetry stand out. Ausias March is not only the most renowned Catalan lyric poet but also the one whose works have most deeply influenced the moderns. The most important element in his poetry is thought. He reached a point at which, as he says himself, he seemed to have been stripped of every other human faculty and left as mere stark naked intellect; all the vigour of his humanity and his poetic genius, all the strength of his passion, became canalised with frightening intensity into sheer intellection. T h e vigour and fecundity of the thought he embodied in patterns inherited from a monotonous tradition served to transfigure them. His learning, his temperament, and his experience blended together, and he became a tragic poet whose Cants form one vast but single work. Its clarity is fired with the ardour of a mystic's passion, and it is one of the strangest and finest poems which any man has ever written. Ausias March drew upon his wide and varied reading for themes, patterns, and allusions, but the strength of his personality was such that there was no subservience in this. Not only did he derive fresh poetry from old subjects and time-honoured [xli ]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsituations, but he was sufficiently eclectic to avoid submission to the Renaissance trends of the age in which he lived, though without denying the values which it had discovered. His intellection fitted within that framework thanks to his instinctive taste for such harmonious concord, but one could not strictly describe him as a \"man of his age\". He never subscribed to its fullness, although he did adapt himself to live in it, remaining instead a solitary genius whose life and vision transcended his environment. The past of Christendom weighed upon him with all its Aristotelian scholasticism; his intimate sense of sin awakened his intellect and transmuted it into conscience. His poetic conflict lay in the doubts surrounding eternal life—salvation or damnation. One might almost call him a Mediaeval poet conscious of having sinned with the Renaissance, vividly ashamed of this as converts always are of sin. His analysis has a renaissance subtlety in which the influence of Petrarch gives an anguished chiaroscuro to the poet's world. Yet he owed even more to Dante than to Petrarch: traces of Dante can be found throughout his work, although received as part of the full current of his Christian heritage, whereas he is Petrarchan only in his intellectual processes, not in his attitude. The most intense conflict with which this world confronted him was produced by a love worthy of his genius, as strange and powerful in its dominion as his own poetic vision of the world. He had to formulate all this in verse. This experience brought him face to face with death, in giving him the most intense desire for life, and if he had never had this love the poet in him would have been obliged to forge it. The [ xlii ]\n\nINTRODUCTION mental processes which it involved were very similar to those of Petrarch, but there was less of the literary impulse about Ausias March, less of the conscious desire to achieve artistic creativity. T h e y were two totally different men, and since they were both sincere as poets their poetry remains just as essentially different, in spite of all the things their works have in common. x\\usias March owed as much of his technique to the troubadours as he did to Petrarch; he was deeply acquainted with their poetry but saw them in sufficient perspective to avoid their defects and to be able to reject their language and vocabulary almost completely, whilst still employing the metres they had used. H e even has something of their thought and of their courtly world, although there is more which is Italianate about him. This is largely because his career as a soldier took him to Italy, as it took Jordi de Sant Jordi and Andreu Febrer, for he was a courtier and a warrior of the old nobility, a man of culture and great learning whose patrons were the dukes and kings he served. H e first saw his lady, Teresa, at church in Lent. T h a t perspective of an anguished populace oppressed b y grief and darkened walls was suddenly foreshortened till nothing was left in focus except a woman standing bv a crucifix. T h e poet in Ausias March fell on his knees before them, and never ceased to worship that twin image of God who loved him and the W o m a n whom he loved, whom he had found intent in meditation on that same God's passion. These two symbols were to haunt him all his life, and he had time for pondering upon them when travelling back and forth to the Court [ XLIII ]\n\nINTRODUCTION of Aragon at Naples, or in the tedious intervals which punctuate campaigning. T h e conflict between them gradually matured, to be projected into a poetry which was shot through and through with doubts, sorrow and passion. His humanistic learning had given him access to the wisdom of previous thinkers; themes and doctrines culled from poets, theologians, saints, philosophers, and mediaeval theorists on love were daringly fused into the substance of his personal experience. His poetry soon became widely known and gained him a great reputation even in his lifetime; he too, like Jordi de Sant Jordi, was long erroneously thought to have influenced Petrarch, but his influence upon Peninsular poetry is undeniable. It was recognised by Castilians of the stature of the Marqués de Santillana, Garcilaso de la Vega, Gutierre de Cetina, and Herrera, whilst he became the avowed model for the later Catalan poets of the Fifteenth Century and decadence. H e has also influenced a number of salient modern poets, but he is even more important for his own achievements than as the creator of a school; his love poetry stands far above that of all previous mediaeval lyricists. Ausiàs March's originality lay less in the substance of his thought or the technique of its formulation, or even in his imagery, than in the gravity and the intensity which he displayed in self-analysis and in the subtlety with which he expounded and anatomised all the facets of his intellectual progress. Life had given him everything required to make him a poet. H e had been born with a gift for the apt choice of words and structure, unmarred bv any innate love of artifice, and with a mind capable [ XLIV ]\n\nINTRODUCTION of piercing every aspect of human nature, dissecting both body and soul. He was granted Teresa, completely human in the blend of good and evil which he found in her, and then she died early—thus becoming yet more deeply and less forgettably his. The rest of his rich and varied life by land and sea was spent in ceaseless pondering upon salvation, an issue which her death brought home to him. Moved throughout by ardent, very human passions, his voice gained from their depth something of the power of choral chant, to beat into his poems with full solemnity and vigour. The Cants d'amor were his earliest poems and the finest, perhaps because they came the closest to experience; those which mourned Teresa, styled by posterity the Cants de mort, were their inevitable sequel; then face to face with the imminence of his own death, he wrote the Cants morals, which led up to his final Cant espiritual — a general confession, a prayer and a lament. Looked at in their entirety his writings form a balanced, architectonic whole based upon the poetry of love. When death had intervened, the poet built another storey out of his perplexed and agonised remorse. This was a pain which could only be resolved in God, in God's good time and through His grace and love; Ausiás March's life and works drew to their close as these were finally attained. His last confession stands on the summit of that edifice, and it is a prayer for death because he was weak and feared not death but sin. He had unravelled and shed, line by line, that intricate web of living and loving, of doing good and doing evil, which had grown more intricate and more intense throughout his life. There was nothing left to shed [xlv]\n\nINTRODUCTION save life itself; he begged f o r deliverance in that one final poem which crowns his works sublimely, gaining him eternity as a great poet where all he had sought was to achieve a man's eternal life, through God's great mercy. The Valencian School in the Fifteenth\n\nCentury\n\nDante's translator, Andreu Febrer, was a contemporary of Ausiàs March and Jordi de Sant Jordi, but he was more deeply influenced by France and by Provence than by the Italians; even in his frequent imitations of Petrarch there is much that is Provençal. A poet of passionate love, he tended towards an undue artificiality in its expression. Lleonard de Sors was a subtler man, of the same period and the same court ; his lyrics are denser and more difficult, highly intellectualised, and sometimes didactic in their aim. Joan Berenguer de Masdovelles (14...-1467?), on the other hand, was a poet of rare and vivacious charm, although his verses reflect the political preoccupations of his day. Instinct with the spirit of his age, they form a larger body of poetry than has survived from any of his contemporaries. He was the most prominent member of a whole family of minor poets of his name, and was in his work a follower of Jordi de Sant Jordi. Hug Bernât de Rocaberti is more important ; Andreu Febrer and he were the two Catalans most influenced by Dante, and he was heir to all that was Italian in his century. Although his technique was refinedly literary, his La comèdia de la gloria d'amor contains some truly lyrical passages. He, too, was a soldier, and a typical example of the courtly warriors of [ xlvi ]\n\nINTRODUCTION the Renaissance, well-read, refined, agreeable, and a man of good taste with a taste f o r good living. Febrer's friend, Pere Torroella, brought up abroad, marked the beginnings of an annihilatory transition by writing both in Catalan and in Castilian. This bilingualism appears to have been associated with the general southwards shift of Catalan poetry and literature corresponding to the shifting of emphasis away from Provence, towards Italian culture. Although the Renaissance had begun at Barcelona, with Bernat Metge, it flowered more fully in Valencia; since Valencia was less Catalan, this flowering could suffer a swifter although less spectacular transition from splendour to decay under the impact of Castile. T h e second half of the Fifteenth Century witnessed that transition. It was a gradual process; in the case of Romeu Llull, who died at Barcelona in 1484, the Catalan portion of his work remained the vital one — writing in Castilian and Italian was merely a pastime. A man of parts —he was the Governor of Barcelona when he died, and one of the most influential men of his day— Romeu Llull was the last poet of that city before the decadence set in. His poems have survived in £ manuscript called the Jardinet tforats (Orchard of Fools), which also incorporates the work of Joan Roi§ de Corella (142.—1500). T h e latter was the third great Valencian lyricist of the period, and it is interesting to observe that even after Romeu Llull had died at Barcelona, Valencia could produce a major poet, and that there was indeed still time for a whole school to grow up around him before the decadence overwhelmed Valencia too. Many of its works are to be found in that [ xlvi1 ]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsame manuscript, and a number of anonymous poems amongst them assist in the definition of this final phase by showing that the debt to the troubadours was still a fundamental one even after the full flowering of the Valencian Renaissance. Joan Roi£ de Corella was the poetic successor of Ausias March and Jordi de Sant Jordi, but as a prose-writer he stands in the direct line of two great humanists, Bernat Metge and Antoni Canals, the Valencian (d. 1419). The final phase before decay was thus dominated by a humanist, as it had been begun by one a hundred years or so before. He died, as far as we know, during the first year of the Sixteenth Century. Aragon, which had been the most powerful maritime state in the Mediterranean, warden of the Pyrenees and feared in the heart of the Peninsula, had ceased to be an independent kingdom. The Aragonese prince who had married the heiress to Castile now ruled his territories from the latter kingdom, in a way which responded to other needs than those of his inheritance. Coming at this time, the works of Roi5 de Corella were the last flickering of a dying torch, not a flame to lead the way to greater glory, despite their brilliance and their clarity. A great and a subtle poet, brutal at times yet verging upon manneristic artifice at others, he owed a greater debt to the Renaissance than any of his predecessors or contemporaries. He possessed a very personal mode of feeling, marked by that spontaneous irony which has come to be associated with Valencian poetry of this and later, modern, phases. His works move in an atmosphere of solemn artistry and almost ritual decoration, with occasional [ xlvi 1 1 ]\n\nINTRODUCTION flashes of bright light. Although his most important works are perhaps his religious lyrics, he was also inspired by love for a lady called Caldesa. Scholar, courtier and theologian, the major characteristics of his life can all be argued from the evidence of his surviving works, although his personality is blurred in history by the confusion amongst a number of men of his name who lived at that time. The early Tragèdia de Caldesa, a work in prose and verse, already displayed the vigour of his artistry and of his knowledge of formal rhetoric; in it he analysed the alternate adoration and repulsion which he felt for a woman in whom baseness and refinement seemed to blend. Although described with a certain affectation and an undue emphasis upon the ingenuities of wit, Caldesa almost attains the stature of a myth — but a myth very close to reality, never a symbol or a mere abstraction. All R0Ì5 de Corella's love poetry has an air of coming from a mundane cleric who adopts something of the preacher's tone when he mentions death; Valencia was very close to the Rome of the half-century before the Sack in 1525 just then. Ecclesiasticism appears in a purer form in his religious poetry, where he seemed to seek a liturgical embodiment for his aesthetic attitude towards existence. Most of it relates to Passiontide, and lays a highly coloured, vibrantly descriptive emphasis upon visualisation of the scene. In one great prayer to Our Lady, for instance, he requires that she be viewed as in a Pietà, with her dead Son's head in her lap ; Joan R0Ì9 de Corella painted such pictures as though he saw them in a richly ornate church, depicted boldly in stained glass transfigured by the rising sun, or wrought into an ornate [ XLIX ] 4\n\nINTRODUCTION and gilded reredos which has been struck into relief against the darkness by a single shaft of blinding, golden light. His imagery is full of the ornaments of ritual, incense and vestments, myrrh and perfumes, but his lines remain sincere in spite of being so eruditely wrought. Roig de Corella's apt use of polished rhetoric places him amongst the craftsmen of the Renaissance. His collaboration with other Valencians of his day leads one to a consideration of their independent works. Some of these already displayed a marked leaning towards Castilian. Bernat de Fenollar (i435?-i526?), Jaume Gagull, Joan Escriva, and Francesc de Castellvi are four of the most prominent of these, and Fenollar and Castellvi collaborated with yet another poet, Narcis de Vinyoles, in a curious work entitled the Escacs d'amor. Its very deft virtuosity and openly plebeian taste were the marks of this school. The lengthy anonymous Colloqui de dames, for instance, contains one of the most daring dialogues in any literature. A certain spritely and malicious joy led these Valencian poets to perform intricate verbal dances in their abundant satires. The sunlight and the vivid colours of their landscape have something of this same frank, shameless vivacity, but it is a quality which unfortunately limits the appeal of a great deal of their work. One can still read certain lively pieces by Jaume Gagull with pleasure, nonetheless, or the religious works and cobles upon the Passion by Escriva. These all died during the first quarter of the Sixteenth Century, and though Valencia was still to produce important writers they were to write in the alien Castilian tongue.\n\n[L]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe poets of the Decadence\n\nT h e first bilingual poet of note had died a little earlier in Barcelona. Pere Torroella ( i 4 3 0 ? - i 5 0 i ? ) was among the earliest Catalan nobles to be brought up in Castile and to live there. This Castilian environment was the decisive factor in his life; the transfer of the Court to Castile was to have a similar effect upon Catalan culture in general. He was an alert and cultured man, so well-schooled in the traditional techniques of poetry that he could write a poem in which several speakers expressed themselves in their own tongue and after their own manner, in Provençal, French, Castilian, Galician, and Catalan. He was also deeply influenced by Italy, as was natural f o r a man of his age, and he wrote one poem in sonnet form. His most obvious debt is to Ausiàs March; mainly derivative though his art may be, his own feelings sometimes glitter through his borrowings in his Catalan verses. These include a number of good lyrics, whereas his famous lines in Castilian against womankind display no more than a considerable virtuosity. As the Sixteenth Century opened out, Catalan literature almost ceased to exist. A general weakening of spirit had been leading towards decadence, and literature now merely held the mirror up to nature. N o further prose was written, except in the historical field. Valencian became an increasingly castilianised dialect, whilst Majorcan and Rosellonès drew apart from the mother tongue. Occasional Catalan poems continued to be written in Catalonia itself, but only five poets appeared in the course of [LI]\n\nINTRODUCTION three centuries; none was of great merit, and two, moreover, wrote only in Castilian. The first of these was Joan Bosca i Almogaver (i 500-1544), known as Boscan in Castile, who was a contemporary of Pere Torroella; the second, Manuel de Cabanyes (1808-1833), li y e d some three centuries later and was a contemporary of Aribau and Rubio i Ors, and witnessed the beginnings of the Renaixenga. The other three have achieved significance more for their isolation than for any virtues of their w o r k ; Pere Serafi and Joan Pujol (d. 1626) were chiefly influenced by Ausias March, whereas Francesc Vicen? Garcia (1582-1623) followed the Castilian school of Gongora. Pere Serafi, who was still alive about 1563, copied Bosca by using the Italian metres which he had introduced into Castile. His works are chiefly intellectual curiosities. His own life was peaceful and undisturbed and very limited in scope, and when he tried to write on themes which had moved Ausias March and in the latter's style, he was merel y performing a literary exercise which held no feeling whatsoever. He also wrote popular songs, modelled upon the works of the troubadours, whose facility gained him considerable fame in his own day. T h e y have a certain grace and charm, but their lyrical value is reduced by the artificiality and affectation of his style. Joan Pujol was more sincere, though less capable. He was another follower of Ausias March, whom he made the protagonist of the Visid de somni, using traditional metres in a courageous attempt to write an epic on the battle of Lepanto — largely won by the Catalan mariners who took part in it. [LII]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFrancesc Vicenç Garcia lived at the beginning of the Seventeenth Century, wrote copiously, and died young. He had fully assimilated the influences of Castile, and only the mere mechanics of his Catalan medium keep his work apart from Castilian literature. The Catalan he used was empty and spiritless, purely a form of speech. This may have been the reason w h y his superficial wit was so well thought of at the Court — his poetry would seem familiar there, or indeed anywhere in the Peninsula except in Catalonia. His conceits and affectations were those of the Castilian schools, and this subservience to their conventions marked the ultimate degradation of Catalan literature. Skilful versifier though he was — amongst the most skilful in Catalan—, Garcia failed completely in his attempt to adapt one language to another and to say in Catalan (but in Castilian metres) what other poets were then saying in the Castilian tongue. Had he followed the traditional simplicity of the language in which he chose to write he might have made a noble contribution to Catalan literature. His courtly pretensions, and the superficiality of his brilliance, led him to perpetrate a series of ridiculous and arid mannerisms which were essentially provincial in the intellectual context of the day. Francesc Fontanella, who followed Garcia, had even less of Catalan about him; he was no more than a Castilian poet writing in a Catalan dialect. W i t h his appearance, Catalan can be said to have vanished as a valid literary medium.\n\n[liii ]\n\nINTRODUCTION III: T H E RENAIXENGA AND T H E TWENTIETH CENTURY The\n\nCanfoner\n\nCatalan disappeared from literature for three centuries, it continued to be used by anonymous poets. They wrote in ballad-form, producing the Cangoner, but such ballads as survive are hard to date, and it is almost as hard to determine what part learned contributions played in their development. The realistic attitude of these anonymous poets attained an equilibrium between Castilian influence and the Catalan traditions such as the courtly poetasters never reached. The people continued to create a very vital form of poetry in spite of the lack of literary craftsmen. The corpus of ballads steadily increased, and was preserved by oral tradition until its presence was noted by the scholars of the Renaixenga, who were swift to collect and record what had survived. Apart from its undeniable lyrical importance, the persistence of this body of popular poetry constituted one of the major justifications of the Renaixenga; it attested both to the vigour of the instinctive urge for such autonomous survival and to the great achievements of which that urge was capable even under the most adverse circumstances. Any survey of Catalan lyric poetry must therefore pause to analyse and to evaluate these ballads. ALTHOUGH\n\nMany are very lyrical, having a nobility and grandeur which is all their own. The most popular have been preserved with innumerable variants, and [LIV]\n\nINTRODUCTION their origins lie many stages back f r o m the versions which survive, frequently belonging to the common fund of European folklore; one in a hundred proves to be a perfect poem. E v e n in this genre the metres became castilianised, yet the vigour of the national personality persisted in spite of this and of Castilian accretions to the lexicon. Passed on and bettered b y w o r d of mouth throughout the centuries of decadence, these songs became part of the daily life of cities, villages, and fields, and almost one with the cycle of the seasons. T h e y reflect the feelings of the people, and partially make up f o r the lack of epic poetry b y glorifying the courage of minor local heroes — bandits, rebels, or partisans. T h e y rarely deal with the old days of chivalry under the Counts and the Kings, or with major victories, defeats, or sieges, such as history records. T h e three chief characteristics of these poems are their dramatic intensity, an expressive but extremely brutal vocabulary, and themes in which love and death are tragically blended. T h e y have a direct and realistic vividness which leaves no room f o r m y s t e r y ; such marvels and fancies as they hold are ingenuous and naive. T h e y were songs which sprang f r o m the collective genius of a restrained but highly sensitive people, alive to every facet of the human tragedy in which they were involved.\n\nThe beginnings of the Renaixenfa T h e last poet of the decadence was the greatest Catalonia gave to Castile; Manuel de Cabanyes died in 1833, three centuries after Roi9 de Corella, and everything about his w o r k w a s Catalan except the [LV]\n\nINTRODUCTION language in which he wrote. His work foreshadowed the most fruitful sources of the early Renaixenga, drawing upon the Latin classics and contemporary Italian poets. Cabanyes sought to express the ideals of his land and its thirst for a return of glory, and wrote austere and robust verse untrammelled by artificialities or mannerisms. His high purpose represented a return to the direct line of Catalan tradition. It was due to this that his poetry, seemed out of place in the Castilian tongue and in Castile, and therefore gained him no fame nor approbation outside Catalonia. The year Cabanyes died, Bonaventura Carles Aribau (1798-1862) published his ode La Pàtria, which would still have been the best poem written in Catalan since the Fifteenth Century even if it had been devoid of any wider meaning. Its importance for us is even greater because it became the point of departure for the Renaixenga. When the humanistic zeal of Catalonia was revived by the impact of Romanticism, it sought expression in Catalan once more; even if Aribau's nostalgia is romantic, the stress he laid upon the significance of the mother tongue was classical in its appeal. La Pàtria, never meant to be more than a circumstantial ode, became the living revelation of the strength and potency of Catalan as a literary language. Its greatness lay in the brilliance with which Aribau phrased his appeal in a Catalan which had no direct antecedents. It appeared in a newspaper, fittingly so because it brought the first news of Catalan revival. Once under way, the Renaixenga was sponsored by the people, by the erudite, and by philologists alike. It drew on the literary past, the continuous [LVI]\n\nINTRODUCTION religious tradition of the goigs, sermons and catechisms in the vernacular, and on more recent Catalan translations of the Bible. There had been previous attempts to use the language again, failures such as the Càntics catalans (published at Perpignan in 1826), Lo Temple de la Gloria by Ignasi Puigblanch, which was probably written even earlier, or the décimes in the direct tradition of Garcia and Fontanella written by Josep Robreno, but Aribau's ha Pàtria was the decisive contribution. It is an attractive poem in its own right, its words well chosen and its phrases turned with a pleasant grace which reverted to an archaic alexandrine harmony of form. It had an elegiac note of mourning for the past, and it contained an uncompromising affirmation of loyalty to his mother tongue. This duality of subject, in which its humanistic and romantic sources intertwined, was the secret of its immense success as a source of inspiration for the Renaixença; this success immortalised it in a w a y which not even its intrinsic merits could have done. A whole literary movement soon came into being. Joan Cortada (1805-1868) and Miquel Anton Marti (d. 1864) were led by their desire for erudite divulgation to prepare a dictionary and to translate Grossi, Tasso and Costi. They were also creative poets, and published La noia fugitiva and Llàgrimes de la viudesa. The second of these exerted a strong influence upon Marti's contemporaries, including Rubio i Ors (1818-1899), the first significant figure of the Renaixença. Rubio was conscious of the importance of what he was doing, and proclaimed the literary independence of Catalan in a manifesto which appeared as the prologue to his first book of [lvii ]\n\nINTRODUCTION poems. A poetic school soon grew up around him ; his example had played a far more impressive part than the somewhat ingenuous poems of Lo gaiter del Llobregat ( 1 8 4 1 ) might lead one to expect, because they united the aspirations of the intellectuals with those of popular feeling. When these poems first appeared as a regular feature of a Barcelona newspaper, they caused a great sensation, provoking repercussions in Valencia and in Mallorca. Each district soon discovered its own bard, who sang of its river to the tune of whatever his chosen instrument might be, in imitation of Rubió's piper and his Llobregat. Although he had drawn upon the troubadours for his romantic inspiration, he had come under a far more direct influence from Pere Serafi and from Garcia, and his language and metres remained very Castilian. The Renaixenga might have been retarded had it not been for him, but certain aspects of the decadence would certainly have frustrated its vitality had it continued to follow his line, instead of that which Aribau had indicated in La Pàtria. Rubió i Ors also wrote an epic poem on the adventures of the Catalans in Greece. This gained him a prize from a learned society, establishing a precedent for such awards. In 1859, he organised the restoration of the Joes Florals, which were first presided over by a scholar who was to prove an extremely important figure in the Renaixenga:: Manuel Milà i Fontanals (1818-1884). Poets from Valencia and Mallorca also entered the lists at Barcelona, and poets from Provence (headed by Frederic Mistral) later paid homage to the institution. The wheel had turned full circle, but save for very rare exceptions, the poetry of the Joes Florals [ LVIII ]\n\nINTRODUCTION gave the clearest proof that such a return to the earliest source of inspiration was an error. That attitude fortunately changed to something more alive, and closer to the earth, after the first two anthologies Els trobadors nous and Els trobadors moderns appeared; their very titles had mirrored the eruditely picturesque approach of the fortyfour poets whose works they contained. The Valencian Tomas Villaroya (1812-1856) had begun to follow Aribau. His follower Teodor Llorente (18321 9 1 1 ) surpassed him in this vein, whilst a great Majorcan, Maria Aguilo (1825-1897), also joined the Renaixenga at about this time. Aguilo, however, was a scholar above all. The first true poet of the movement was Josep Lluis Pons i Gallarza (1823-1894), who came from Barcelona, but whilst Manuel Mila i Fontanels fostered it in Barcelona itself — acting as its doyen and writing erudite poetry which was highly classical yet popular in feeling—Pons i Gallarza lived and wrote in Mallorca. Such men continued the Renaixenga from the point to which it had been brought by Rubio i Ors, roughly grouped around the Joes Florals, but they returned to the inspiration of Aribau and Cabanyes. These had both credited poetry with a transcendent function, and had seen the poet as a man destined to interpret the inner meaning of things. Those who best fulfilled this ideal were the poets of the Majorcan School, and it was they who —together with that greater figure, Verdaguer— revivified Catalan poetry by getting right away from all the trends which had led to its decadence. Good poets continued to pass through the Joes Florals, bringing that institution into as high a repute as it had ever enjoyed in all [lix]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nits history, but as a school, the Joes Florals attained no plane of universal value. During the past ninety years it has taken on more and more of the status of a dignified society, and latterly its meetings have had to be held in different foreign capitals as a result of the Spanish Civil W a r . The expansion\n\nof the\n\nRenaixen$a\n\nThe past hundred years have witnessed one of the most interesting poetic revivals of European history. There has been no lack of Catalan lyric poets since Pons i Gallarza, Llorente and Verdaguer. Pons i Gallarza was responsible for the first important work, Volivera mallorquina, which perpetuated the depth, clarity, and easy sonorous flow of the alexandrines used b y Aribau. The appearance of such balanced and profound poetry after three and a half centuries of literary decadence is very striking, and one is tempted to attribute it to the resurgence of a whole people's spirit finding its embodiment through one man's mind. Pons i Gallarza, like all the Majorcan poets who succeeded him, was a classicist in the movement of his verse and the human w a y in which he saw the island landscape. He rediscovered those universal values which Catalan poetry needed, b y reflecting on an instinctive love of nature and mankind. T h e high level he reached was not unworthy of his models: Horace and Virgil. In Valencia, Teodor Llorente replaced the oversentimental affectations of Villaroya with delicatel y rendered songs which hold the exultant light of that warmer and more southerly land. Their grace[LX]\n\nINTRODUCTION fui images enter by the eyes, like the landscape he depicted. Unduly facile versification weakens his poetry, just as it had tended to mar that of the Sixteenth Century Valencian School. The most noteworthy of his contemporaries and successors have been Constanti Llombart (1848-1893), Vicen£ Boix (1812-1880) and —best of the three—, Vicen? Wenceslau Querol (1836-1889). This school has continued to develop up to the present day, and is now headed by Xavier Casp (b. 1915). The Renaixenga had spread to all the Catalanspeaking lands when Verdaguer (1845-1902) began to write the most important epic poem of modern times, some thirty years after the publication of La Pàtria. The Joes Florals sponsored much epic poetry. From the very beginning, there had been many long narrative poems, on subjects more or less heroic, starting with Lo Temple de la Glòria and Joan Gari, erniità de Montserrat —which extends to sixteen thousand lines. Rubió had written his Roudor, Damàs Calvet (1838-1891) his Mallorca cristiana, and there had been works of the same nature by Pelai Briz, Pico i Campamar, Bofarull, Balaguer, Aguiló, A4ilà, and Angel Guimerà— all of which were well known in their own day. It was by no means strange that Verdaguer should also write an epic, having had so many predecessors in the genre, but none possessed his dominion over the language in which he wrote. Even with the vigour of his Catalan inspiration it required great poetic genius to bridge the gap between his predecessors and his own high standards. Verdaguer's isolation amongst his own contemporaries is as great as that of Ausiàs March [lxi ]\n\nINTRODUCTION had been; his genius rose from the confusion of schools and movements with UAtlantida, in 1877. Born in 1845, he had chosen the priesthood as the result of a natural vocation, with no prior mental conflict. The fundamental crisis of his poetic life came after his ordination as a country cleric in 1870. His ecclesiastical training had attempted to tranquillise the violence of his poetic energy and to canalise it into a given stream, but whilst it taught him about God and gave him the rudiments of the humanities—which blended in with his own Catalan inheritance—it wrecked his health. From being a sturdy lad he became an ailing man with a precarious hold on life, and the sharp contrast between sickness and health resulted in a mental crisis in which he seemed to find himself faced with an agonising choice between his priesthood and his poetry. When he put poetry before his priesthood, as his life's primary vocation, he clutched at its blinding flame till he was burnt to a mere cinder of a man. Subjectively, his life from then onwards was a long struggle illuminated by the clear, hard light of poetry. Priesthood and environment denied him the use of his youthful vigour. His pride in physical strength became a pride in intellectual capacity which found its outlet in poetry. His inner life was in addition complicated by profound spiritual misgivings. Verdaguer was sure that he knew God directly, but the conviction of his worthlessness, when measured against an infinite divinity, was a very humbling one. A t times he tried to get closer to G o d than poetry could take him, and he found that he was far too near to the earth to be a mystic. As he grew older he [ LXI1 ]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nfound death more terrifying; although he believed in a future life he shrank away from it. W h e n his own death drew near, he renounced his attempt to rise to God unaided, clutching at human forgiveness in the hope that mankind itself held something of divinity. There is a constant and direct connection between his life and poems; through the poems one can find the man, with all his terrors and his anguish and his supernatural rejoicing. His works were richer and more varied than those of any other poet since Ramon Llull. He revived forgotten words, coined many himself, and created modern literary Catalan out of hardly anything at all. He treated the themes of popular poetry, using a more apt and subtle imagery than that of his predecessors. In his religious verse, which was the most important contribution to that genre for over five centuries, he concentrated the previously diffused Franciscan atmosphere to create a highly personal style of contemplation. His most original poems were those which came from his own tragedy, transfused with passion, surging with leashed strength, and some were truly magnificent creations. He gave free rein to his taste for grandeur and fantastic imagery in the Atldntida. Verdaguer was born on an age-old plain, which was torrid and intractable in summer, ashen and fey in misty wintry weather, enclosed by a great bend of a slow, meandering river whose waters sometimes rose to flood the lower ground, and the Pyrenees towered on the horizon. VAtldntida grew from childhood contemplation of that landscape and the folk-tales he had loved to hear, and from his reading during long Atlantic voyages undertaken on the [ lxiii]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\norders of his doctors. This had included Plato and the classical epics. His first major work is a strange medley, passages of very 'forceful poetry come between lines of inappropriate language or false rhetoric, and the plot is of scant importance. The real protagonist is abstract strength; Hercules becomes a Catalan hero, incarnating the warrior-spirit of the race. Verdaguer embodied the passions of the primitive inhabitants with a brutal energy, hankering after the days when the whole world was new and still to conquer. Just as Hercules was treated as a Catalan, so were the saints, angels and the Holy Family in his other works. He consistently identified himself with the Catalan people in his religious verse. Verdaguer wrote much poetry in the traditional Franciscan line of inspiration, following and guiding the religious feelings of the humble folk whom he admired. Jesus Infant, for instance, is one of the most moving and most \"popular\" books in Catalan literature. Some of the shorter poems are amazingly graceful, built up around very simple images of country life and the childhood of Christ, transfigured till there is nothing left save poetry. He was also indebted to Ramon Llull and to the Song of Songs. In his maturity Verdaguer wrote another major poem, which aimed as high as UAtlantida but in a different way. In Canigo he used a wholly Christian medium for patriotism. It represented a fresh phase in his cult of the Pyrenees, singing of a Catalonia in whose great hills the faith of the humble had found a refuge as calm and quiet as Bethlehem. Canigo is undoubtedly his most successful poem because of the depth of its psychological insight, the [ lxiv ]\n\nINTRODUCTION perfection of its varied forms and the dramatic energ y which animates it as a whole. The epic, the legendary, and the human, blend in a complex pattern endowed with multiple facets, relevances and validities. Love, one of its essential themes, is handled with great dramatic skill despite the lack of concrete images; it is present as tangibly when unexpressed as when explicit. Woman was a negative element in both his life and his work, felt rather through absence than through specific formulations. The hundreds of masterly stanzas of which Canigo consists are clear proof of Verdaguer's fondness for the panoramic view in landscape as in history. Verdaguer turned to sadder poems which embodied the conflict between pride and trammelling circumstance —the essence of his tragedy— towards the evening of his days. T h e y would not have gained him immortality; they mirror a spiritual surrender. That experiential vision of the world for which he became renowned, so personal and yet so universal in its alchemy, came from his earlier works. The full flowering of the Renaixenga\n\nCosta i Llobera (1854-1922) and Joan Alcover (1854-1926) were Verdaguer's contemporaries.These two Majorcans had continued in the classicising vein, influenced not merely by antiquity but also by the French Parnasse, by the Italians and —above all— by the clear light of their own island. Like Verdaguer, Costa i Llobera was in holy orders; his classical sense of harmony with nature fused into an intensely Christian longing for transfiguration of the soul. His was a mystique which strove f o r per[lxv]\n\n5\n\nINTRODUCTION fection within the contingent universe because it was too humble to ascend to God. His works have the vigour apparent in those of all the major poets of the Renaixenga, right through to Maragall, and he, too, displays that tendency to formulate the yearnings of his own people in prophetic visions or elegiac evocations of the past. In style and form, Costa i Llobera was a classicist from the first; his words were chosen with a view to their fullness of meaning and isolated to fulfil it. He was striving for a harmony through which he might realise himself; his polished, balanced lines, often modelled upon classical metres, are perfect examples of controlled intensity. Yet this harmonious aspect was never allowed to overlay the grav"
