        "text": "About Joan Maragall Gardens\n\nThe Montjuïc Joan Maragall Gardens, Jardins Joan Maragall is a captivating tranquil oasis of elegant landscaping that is little known by tourists and Barcelona residents because until about a year ago the gardens were permanently closed to the public. Today the gardens have limited weekend opening hours.\n\nThe gardens are arranged around Albéniz Palace, Palauet Albéniz, that was built as a royal pavilion for the 1929 International Exposition, being held in Montjuïc. Palauet Albéniz was built in a Neoclassical style by the architect Joan Moya. The gardens were designed by Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier.\n\nJardins Joan Maragall is named after the renowned Catalan poet, and is made up of broad lawns, several ponds, ornamental fountains, colourful flower beds during summer, numerous sculptures and plants with a layout inspired by French landscape gardening during the 20th century.\n\nPalauet Albéniz, along with Pedralbes Palace was one of the official residence's of Spain's royal family on their visits to Barcelona.\n\nGetting to Joan Maragall Gardens\n\nAddress: Avenida Estadi 69, Barcelona. 8038\n\nThe only entrance that is open on the weekends is that in Avenida Estadi 69 on the corner with Passeig de Santa Madrona which is opposite the Museu Olímpic i de l'Esport Joan Antoni Samaranch.\n\nThe nearest bus stop is the Olympic stadium stop on the 150 bus route from Plaça d'Espanya, However, I walked from Plaça d'Espanya to MNAC then along the side of the MNAC museum up the escalators to Avenida Estadi. Use a T-Casual or Hola-Barcelona travel card for bus and metro services."
