Both are effective case studies of how assuming power can bring about extensive change in the tactics and ideology of a national independence movement. Although the Mau Mau of Kenya, led by Jomo Kenyatta, committed many atrocities during the struggle for independence, it was not motivated by any real political ideology, like the communists who later fought the Portuguese in Angola and Mozambique, or would overthrow and kill Emperor Haile Selassie in Ethiopia. Kenyatta’s struggle for independence was a purely pragmatic one, and did not embrace communism or any other leftist ideology. Though constitutionally a oneparty state, Kenya conservatively planned its post-independence future under Kenyatta and his successor, Daniel arap Moi. According to the Kenyan government, “Kenya welcomed both private and government investment. Every farmer needed to be sure of his land rights, land consolidation, and land registration for title deeds. The government wanted to ensure that property was used in the mutual interest of the society and its mem-\n\nbers. Varying forms of ownership were introduced to avoid concentration of economic power and a progressive system of taxation introduced to ensure an equitable distribution of wealth and income.” Politically, however, Kenya sided clearly with the democracies against regional terrorism, which began after the Arab defeat in the Middle East war of 1967. As Gordon Thomas writes, it was the Israeli Mossad that enlisted Kenya in the battle against the attempt by the Chinese communists to subvert Africa. The Chinese communists formed a direct threat to the moderate Kenyan government, and the Mossad gave the Kenyans vital information. It was in gratitude for this that arap Moi let the Israelis use Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, as a refueling stop in the epic Operation Thunderbolt in July 1976, the rescue of the Jewish hostages held by Arab terrorists in Idi Amin’s anarchic Uganda. After its declaration as the Union of South Africa in 1961, the Boer government entered into a bloody struggle against the left-leaning African National Congress (ANC), in which its BOSS intelligence service would become the most rightist and feared organization on the continent. Anti-terrorism brought South Africa and Israel into a natural alliance, fostered by Israel’s Prime Minister Golda Meir. Both the ANC and the Palestine Liberation Organization (Israel’s enemy) were ideological kinsmen, and a further diplomatic demarche would occur between South Africa’s Prime 501\n\n502\n\nAfrica\n\nMinister P.W. Botha and Ezer Weizman that, according to Thomas, amounted to a mutual defense pact. In September 1981, South Africa’s Minister of Defense Magnus Malan asserted that “the onslaught here is communist-inspired, communist-planned, and communist-supported.” Israel gave South Africa much aid in return for uranium destined for the Israeli nuclear research facility at Dimona in the Negev Desert. However, once the ANC assumed power in 1994 under Nelson Mandela, its political coloration significantly changed. Executive Outcomes (EO) had been formed as a highly sophisticated rightist military organization by Eeben Barlow in 1989. This Outcomes group was recruited from former members of the South African Defense Force, or army, which was committed to battling the ANC. When Mandela became president in 1994, he did not disband Executive Outcomes. Instead, he used its soldiers to help bring stability to West Africa. With the help of EO, the Angolan government was able to defeat Jonas Savimbi’s UNITA force in 1993. Only two years later, EO seriously mauled the terrorist forces of Foday Sankoh in Sierra Leone. However, due to diplomatic confusion, Sankoh would still remain in power for years, to die in United Nations custody in 2003 after his fall from power in 2000. Mandela, rather than attempt to hold on to power as with many other African heads of state, voluntarily resigned from office in 1999 to be replaced as South African president by Thabo Mbeki. When widespread publicity focused on EO, it disbanded in 1999, but informed speculation holds that it has continued its mission under similar corporate entities like the Saracen or Lifeguard firms, and still is attempting to restore stability to post-independence Africa. RIGHTIST REACTIONS Much of the history of the right in Africa has to do with rightist reactions to leftist movements, whether legitimate (but Soviet-backed) independence movements or terrorist organizations. Moreover, during the 1960s, the newly emerging African states became increasingly embroiled in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. This was no more evident than in the Belgian Congo, which emerged as a free nation in June 1960. In October 1958, Patrice Lumumba had founded the Congolese National Movement (MNC), and became its first prime minister in June 1960. However, Lumumba began a flirtation with the Soviet Union, which threatened to bring the influence of the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev directly into the\n\nstrategic heart of Africa. Lumumba was captured in a coup led by Colonel Sese Seko Mobutu. Under circumstances still unclear, Lumumba was assassinated in Elizabethville in January 1961. Although CIA complicity has been alleged by leftists, no evidence has come to light except through the prism of communist propaganda. Lumumba’s death initiated a civil war that can stand as a microcosm of Africa’s experience in the 1960s. As a result of Lumumba’s Marxist flirtation, Moishe Tshombe and the diamond-rich Katanga province seceded from the Congo. Backed by the Belgian Union Miniere company, Tshombe was able to hire white mercenaries, whose fighting skills were superior to the Congolese Army, really an armed police force. Forced into exile, Tshombe returned to serve as prime minister in July 1964. General Mobutu staged another military coup in November 1965. In July 1967 Tshombe was kidnapped and taken to Algeria, and died in prison of a heart attack two years later. Mobutu brought stability to a country ravaged by war and, except for an insurrection in 1978, governed for nearly three decades. At the other end of the continent, another struggle became aggravated in South Africa. While it was the Union of South Africa, the dominant Afrikaans, or Boer, population, descended from 17th-century Dutch colonists, began to press for strict segregation of the races. The racism of the Boers had been the factor that set into motion one of the world’s great independence movements. When Mahatma Gandhi lived in South Africa during the early years of the 20th century, the effect so traumatized him that he went home to free his India from the British rule that had tolerated such racism in South Africa. As a result of apartheid segregation, the ANC was formed, with a strong communist coloration. Thus, the intense racist feeling of the Boers had brought into being a destabilizing communist movement in South Africa. The extreme right-wing National Party won in 1948, making apartheid the official policy of the country. The Union of South Africa became the Republic of South Africa on May 31, 1961, and left the British Commonwealth in the face of condemnation of its apartheid policies. For over 30 years, the struggle between the ANC and the apartheid regime would dominate South African life. The conflict was resolved relatively peacefully when apartheid was finally abolished when the ANC came to power in 1994. South Africa was not alone in its rightist apartheid regimes. When Tanzania was formed in the 1960s,\n\nAfrica Southern Rhodesia became the state of Rhodesia under Ian Smith, who followed the precedent of South Africa in creating a white-dominated African country. The History of Rhodesia recorded that Britain pushed for a constitutional reform of its colony that would grant the African population majority political representation. Ian Smith and the Southern Rhodesian parliament were unwilling to accept this and in 1965 unilaterally declared independence, the state now being called Rhodesia. Britain opposed this measure and negotiations continued; the Smith government drew support from South Africa’s apartheid regime. The negotiations with Britain failed in 1969, and the British Commonwealth decided to boycott Rhodesia; the country’s athletes could not participate in Olympic Games, and many nations refused to trade with Rhodesia. In 1970, Rhodesia proclaimed the republic. The ZANU (Shona, led by Robert Mugabe) and ZAPU (Ndebele, led by Joshua Nkomo) organizations began to hurt Rhodesia by guerrilla raids from bases in Mozambique (which became independent in 1975, under a socialist regime). The situation became more and more difficult. In 1980, the Rhodesian administration agreed to general elections with African participation; Robert Mugabe’s Zanu emerged victorious. The country was renamed Zimbabwe. Yet the 1960s also saw the rupture of the most promising country in West Africa, Nigeria. In May 1967, the secessionist Republic of Biafra was proclaimed, largely to protect the Igbos, many of whom were Christians. By the time the war ended, according to the U.S. Library of Congress, “Estimates in the former Eastern Region of the number of dead from hostilities, disease, and starvation during the 30-month civil war are estimated at between 1 million and 3 million. The end of the fighting found more than 3 million Igbo refugees crowded into a 2,500-square-kilometer enclave. Prospects for the survival of many of them and for the future of the region were dim.” While the Cold War served to be the dominant factor affecting African nationalism in the 1970s, the continuing struggle in the Middle East reached out as well. In 1971, President Milton Obote of Uganda was toppled by Idi Amin Dada, who had begun his military career in the colonial British King’s African Rifles (KAR), which had fought in the Mau Mau Emergency in Kenya. As the U.S. Library of Congress states, “presidents Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) initially refused to accept the legitimacy of the new military government. Nyerere, in\n\n503\n\nparticular, opposed Amin’s regime, and he offered hospitality to the exiled Obote, facilitating his attempts to raise a force and return to power.” The Amin regime, a return to the days when Ugandan (then Bugandan) kings persecuted Christians in the 19th century, would lead a reign of terror with his State Research Bureau (SRB) in which some 50,000 to 120,000 of his citizens may have perished. At the same time, he allied himself with the Palestinians, who had been fighting a war of terror against Israel since it defeated the Arab states in the Middle East war of June 1967. In this, he became allied with Colonel Muammar Quaddafi, who had seized power in Libya in 1962. On June 24, 1976, the Palestinian and German terrorists hijacked an Air France jet to Entebbe airport in Uganda, with Israeli citizens aboard, apparently with the help of Amin. Negotiations were begun, including talks directly with Amin by Israeli Colonel Baruch BarLev, who once had been a military adviser in Uganda. When the lives of the hostages seemed threatened, Israel launched Operation Thunderbolt, a daring rescue mission to save them. The success of the historic mission was helped by Kenya. Eventually, Amin’s rule became a barbaric embarrassment for the neighboring African countries, especially Tanzania. When Amin used Libyan troops to attack Tanzania, Nyerere launched a counterstrike in April 1979 which drove Amin out of Uganda. Amin died in exile in Saudi Arabia in August 2003. The Cold War, never far from the surface in Africa, became especially pointed in Somalia during the 1980s. Mohammed Siad Barre, dictator of Somalia, had launched in 1977 an invasion of the Ogaden Province in neighboring Ethiopia. The invasion would exacerbate a growing famine that plunged Somalia and Ethiopia into turmoil. Both the Soviet Union and the United States desired the Horn of Africa at Somalia because the nation that controlled the narrow Red Sea there would control the entire maritime traffic through the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea and beyond. Barre remained in power by carefully balancing Soviet and American aid, but fell in a coup in 1991. The coup led to an internecine war among the powerful clans of Somalis, in which Mohammed Aidid eventually emerged as the paramount warlord. DEMOCRACY OVER MARXISM A major turn to democracy and the end of Marxist influence in East Africa came in October 1992 when Mozambique celebrated its first democratic elections in\n\n504\n\nAgrarianism\n\nits history. With political stability came the hope of a free market economy to stimulate the hope of capitalist investment not only in Mozambique, but in the entire East African region. As the millennium dawned in 2000, it brought mixed hope for stability in the African continent. Tragically, the Christian and Muslim strife in Nigeria only grew worse. Yet, in the area of the worst slaughter, Rwanda in the 1990s, there had already been signs of the rule of law. In 1996, the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal in Rwanda began hearing from conspirators in the massive bloodshed. At the same time, intervention by the British Paratroop Regiment finally brought peace to Sierra Leone. Edward Harris reported in The Philadelphia Inquirer that “prosecutors opened the first UN-backed war-crimes trial yesterday in Sierra Leone’s vicious civil war, calling for a just accounting for the agony of 10 long years.” SEE ALSO Volume 1 Left: Africa; Egypt; Socialism; Uganda.

JOHN F. MURPHY, JR. AMERICAN MILITARY UNIVERSITY\n\nAgrarianism AGRARIANISM IS THE belief that true freedom belongs to the independent farmer who owns his or her own land. Only the yeoman farmer who can provide his own food from his own land remains truly independent\n\nand virtuous. Only the yeoman farmer truly has a stake in the land to defend it against attack in times of danger. Honest and incorruptible, independent farmers enjoy true freedom according to the agrarian view. Agrarianism also harkens back to a more stable, settled social order of reciprocal social bonds that existed before the rise of cities and machines. Sir Roger de Coverley, a character from The Spectator by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele, exemplifies the best kind of paternalistic and rural values envisioned by many agrarians. James Everett Kibler’s study of a South Carolina plantation, Our Fathers’ Fields, offers a historical portrait of a similar society and its devastating encounter with modernity in the Civil War. Thomas Jefferson is the foremost American exponent of agrarian ideals. Although Jefferson himself remained mired in debt for much of his adult life and relied upon slave labor, he wrote eloquently of the life of the yeoman farmer. In “Query XIX” of Notes on the State of Virginia, Jefferson wrote: “Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God ... whose breasts he has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue. Corruption of morals in the mass of cultivators is a phenomenon of which no age nor nation has furnished an example ... Dependence begets subservience and venality, suffocates the germ of virtue, and prepares fit tools for the designs of ambition.” Many of Jefferson’s political ideas grew from his agrarian views: in particular, his opposition to the commercial and political views of Alexander Hamilton. Hamiltonian attitudes would triumph in America with the defeat of the Confederacy in the Civil War. In the 1920s and 1930s, a group of southern writers and academics attempted to revive the agrarian ideal. Allen Tate, Andrew Nelson Lytle, Donald Davidson, and nine other southerners contributed to I’ll Take My Stand, which they termed an agrarian manifesto. They constructed an elegant appeal to America to return to a traditional economic and moral order, and wrote with a deeply felt love of history and tradition. Southern agrarians also harkened back to an idealized version of antebellum southern life. I’ll Take My Stand condemned both industrialism and socialism as soulless and equally destructive of freedom and Western civilization. In particular, I’ll Take My Stand attacked the idea of progress, especially the American idea of progress not toward a goal, but for its own sake. The kind of conservatism espoused by southern agrarians differs sharply from the conservatism of the Republican Party with its closeness to big business. Seven years after the publication of I’ll Take My Stand, some of the same authors reunited for\n\nAgrarianism\n\n505\n\nAgrarian ideals harkened back to the days unspoiled by progress and were especially espoused by Thomas Jefferson. Southern agrarians in the United States conservatively reacted against modernity’s social ills, such as poverty and alienation.\n\nWho Owns America?, a volume of essays that condemned both communism and capitalism as threats to freedom. At its core, southern agrarianism was a reaction against modernity and all of modernity’s attendant societal ills. In the last decade of the 20th century, Victor Davis Hanson emerged as a leading defender of agrarian values. Hanson, a classics professor in California and a successful popular military historian, became a leading agrarian writer. Unlike the southern agrarians, Hanson wrote from the perspective of one born and reared on a farm, who witnessed the decline of small farming in America. Hanson also differs from the southern agrarians in his distaste for the Confederate States of America, an attitude in full flower in some of his writings on military history. By the beginning of the 21st century, aspects of agrarianism appealed to elements on both the right and left of the American political spectrum. Although it\n\nshares with environmentalism a reverence for land, agrarianism differs from that movement in its reverence for a traditional political and moral order, and in its conservatism. Nowhere has it appeared as a practical political program with genuine support, nor is it likely to in a nation so comfortably wedded to machines and big government. Yet the agrarian life can still be appreciated through books, preferably read out-of-doors with a hound at one’s side, and lived by those untroubled by fighting for a lost cause.

MITCHELL MCNAYLOR OUR LADY OF THE LAKE COLLEGE\n\nAli, Noble Drew (1886–1929) NOBLE DREW ALI (born Timothy Drew), founder of the Moorish American Science Temple, was born in North Carolina. During the first decade of the 20th century, Ali migrated to Newark, New Jersey, where he preached the principles of a new black nationalism in homes and on the streets. Ali, a contemporary of Marcus Garvey, did not call for emigration to Africa by black Americans. Instead, he urged African Americans to become knowledgeable about their African heritage and to become Muslims to overcome racial oppression in the early 20th-century United States. According to the teachings of the Moorish Science Temple, Drew, before changing his name, embarked on a pilgrimage to North Africa where he was given a mission by the King of Morocco to bring the teaching of Islam to African Americans. In order to prove he was the prophet of Allah, Drew had to pass a test. Drew was dropped inside the pyramids of Egypt and had to find his way out, which he did successfully, proving that he was indeed the prophet of Allah, or God. In 1913, Drew organized the Moorish Science Temple in Newark as the prophet of Allah, Nobel Drew Ali.\n\nAli taught his followers that African Americans were Asiatics, and specifically Moors who came from Morocco. According to Drew Ali, African Americans were “descendents of the ancient Moabites who inhabited the northwestern and southwestern shores of Africa.” He believed that Islam was for people of African descent and Christianity was only for Europeans. He believed peace on earth would only come when each racial group had its own religion. Ali published his philosophy in a 64-page Holy Koran. The Moorish Science Temple Holy Koran combined Ali’s teachings with those of the Christian Bible, Garvey’s African nationalism, and the Islamic Quran. He taught that North America was an extension of the African continent because Africans were enslaved and brought to North America. African Americans, he said, must refuse to be called Negro, black, colored, or Ethiopian. Instead, they must call themselves Asiatics, Moors, or Moorish Americans. Members of the Moorish Science Temple pray facing the east three times a day, at sunset, noon, and sunrise. Members take the name El or Bey as their “free national name,” much the same way that members of the Nation of Islam replace their Christian name with “X.” They are also given a membership card, containing their name, which proclaims their honor for “the divine prophets, Jesus, Mohammad, Buddha, and Confucius,” and which concludes with the declaration: “I am a citizen of the USA.” Male members wear a red fez with a black tassel and are permitted to dress casually when not attending official functions. Female members wear long skirts or pants and a turban. The fez and turban are symbolic protection for the knowledge embodied by the membership. Marriages are monogamous and divorce is rarely permitted. In addition to organizing temples throughout the northern and eastern United States, most prominently in Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan, Ali established collectively owned small businesses. Some of Ali’s subordinates exploited these businesses for financial gain. When Ali attempted to intervene, a power struggle ensued. In 1929, a splinter faction leader, Sheik Claude Greene, was shot to death in Chicago. Although Ali was not in Chicago at the time of the shooting, he was arrested and charged with Greene’s murder. Ali was later released on bond. A few weeks after his release in 1929, Ali died of suspicious causes. Many believe he either died of injuries inflicted by the police or he was murdered by followers of Greene. After Ali’s death, John Givens El in Chicago, Illinois, and Master Fard Muhammad in Detroit, Michi-\n\nAmerican Civil War gan, claimed each to be Ali reincarnated. Those who followed John Givens El are present-day members of the Moorish American Science Temple. Those who followed Master Fard Muhammad, who disappeared in 1933, joined Elijah Muhammad, who founded the Nation of Islam in Chicago in 1934. Ali, like many other black nationalists in the United States, rejected the liberal doctrine of racial integration and sought to build a separate black identity. To the extent that his movement was social and political rather than religious, it can be said to fall in the category of a nationalistic doctrine, generally regarded as conservative or right-wing in nature. Although hostile to the exploitation of black Americans by U.S. institutions, Ali never offered a radical or left-wing challenge to those institutions.

JAMES WERTZ AMERICAN UNIVERSITY\n\nAmerican Civil War THE POLITICAL RIGHT during the Civil War was generally (and derisively) known as Copperheads. The origins of this political group stem from a variety of sources. With the start of the Civil War in 1861 and the election of the Republican Abraham Lincoln, many former Democrats and some Republicans believed that civil war and violent confrontation were unnecessary. In the days leading up to Fort Sumter (April 1861), tensions had escalated within the political realm. Lincoln had discussed at his inaugural address maintaining the status quo on the issue of slavery while also criticizing\n\n507\n\nthe seceded states, those that had left the Union to protest the election of an abolitionist Republican, for having committed an unconstitutional act. Lincoln had no alternative but to engage in military confrontation to restore the Union. Clearly, Lincoln was stuck between a rock and a hard place. As Lincoln sent relief supplies to Fort Sumter on that fateful April morning, the Copperheads criticized the president for provoking this phase of the war. To many Copperheads like Clement Vallandigham, Lincoln’s policies were leading the country to a violent war. Many believed that Lincoln should have done more in the early stages of the war. Thus the conservatives within the political spectrum were from the outset extremely critical of Lincoln’s provocatory policies. At the initiation of the war, their criticisms continued unabated. Vallandigham constantly derided the president as being an extreme radical who did not believe in peace. One of Lincoln’s greatest debacles for the right was his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. This writ essentially guaranteed those who are put in jail the opportunity to hear the charges against them within 48 hours. The goal of this writ was to limit the powers of the federal government in holding prisoners indefinitely. As a result of widespread political opposition, specifically, Maryland was the site in 1861 of pro-secessionist violence that had as its mark the president. After a legislature defeated Maryland’s secession, Lincoln suspended the writ to ensure the defeat of the anti-secessionist movement. In the fall of 1861, the proConfederate mayor of Baltimore and 19 state legislators were jailed and held indefinitely. This action angered many “peace Democrats” who believed that Lincoln had overstepped his political powers. Another issue that many on the right criticized Lincoln about was his view on emancipation. Lincoln was essentially a moderate on the issue of slavery. Like many Republicans, he viewed slavery as an evil but he did not want to eliminate it from the states where it already existed. His desire was not to allow the incoming states to enter the Union as slave states. Lincoln’s basic view was that the war was about maintaining the integrity of the Union. This view changed in 1862. Many slaves had escaped to the North. In March 1862, Congress passed a law that did not allow for the return of fugitive slaves. After the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln opted for emancipation, believing that this act would garner support in the North by putting the war on a moral footing. According to the Emancipation Proclamation, the states that did not return to the Union risked the emancipation of their slave labor force.\n\n508\n\nAmerican Conservative Union\n\nSoutherners denounced the policy as hypocritical because Lincoln could not free property or individuals that were not in his control. Copperheads viewed the Emancipation Proclamation as further proof that Lincoln’s aim was to free the slaves and he was willing to risk military conflict to achieve these aims. In the election of 1864, Lincoln’s popularity was extremely low, as many viewed the war at this point as unnecessary. The Democrats nominated former Union General George B. McClellan. McClellan, at the Democratic Convention in Chicago, pledged a peace platform that demanded the end of all hostilities and that the federal union be restored. McClellan, as a member of the Lincoln opposition, was out for revenge against the president, who had fired McClellan two years earlier. Democrats published specious cartoons, spreading rumors and semi-obscene poems suggesting that Lincoln possibly had black ancestry. In the end, Lincoln won the election, winning 55 percent of the vote with a triumph in the Electoral College by winning 212 to 21 over McClellan. In Congress, the Democratic right lost positions, including in the Senate. It was clear that the messages of the right, antiwar, and anti-Lincoln position simply did not resonate among the American electorate. As the Civil War ended in 1865, the Copperheads had been politically defeated and discredited. SEE ALSO\n\nVolume 1 Left: American Civil War; Lincoln, Abraham.

JAIME RAMÓN OLIVARES, PH.D. HOUSTON COMMUNITY COLLEGE, CENTRAL\n\nAmerican Conservative Union THE AMERICAN Conservative Union (ACU) organization began its career as the conservative watchdog for the nation in 1964 in response to the conservatives’ widespread loss of power in the national political arena.\n\nFounded in December 1964 by such figures as Frank S. Meyer, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Robert E. Bauman (organizer of the first meeting), the ACU sought to create a vehicle for the ideas and concepts of the conservative right. The mission of the new organization was (and is) threefold: “Consolidate the overall strength of the American conservative movement through unified leadership and action, mold public opinion, and stimulate and direct responsible political action.” During the first several meetings, the new group appointed a 50-member board of directors, including those from the first organizational meeting as well as Lammot Copeland, Peter O’Donnell, John A. Howard, Congressman Donald C. Bruce of Indiana (elected as the first chairman), and John Dos Passos. Within the month, the group had raised $350,000 as operating capital, decided on its first political actions, and announced itself to the media. Within nine months, the membership reached 7,000, and the new lobby group removed itself from other, more militant conservative groups such as the John Birch Society. Wanting the support of the conservative majority, the ACU stipulated in its bylaws that it welcomed the support of those willing to participate in only “responsible political action.” Over the next seven years, membership in ACU fluctuated but finally reached 45,000 by the end of 1972, and its political activity and affiliations were often front-page news. Among its affiliations, the ACU began establishing a network of local groups under the program Action Now. These groups, or clubs, promoted conservative political action by the members and soon led to state affiliates. This program and the state clubs are still a strong part of the ACU. Another affiliation the organization undertook in its first years, the merger with Public Action Incorporated, provided the impetus for its registration with the government as a lobbyist. Other landmark events at this time included the launch of the ACU’s first publication, the Republican Report, which covered the internal affairs of the Republican Party. By 1971, the Report had changed its name to Battleline, published in 2004 in electronic format. Once it had established its basic foundation and garnered national support, the ACU started making forays in the national political picture: passing resolutions to reject federal government nominees who did not follow their conservative platforms, sending representatives to the national Republican conventions where they influenced the party votes, and endorsing those political nominees who proposed a conservative agenda. These types of activities firmly established the ACU’s political influence\n\nAmerican Enterprise Institute and enabled it to create the Conservative Victory Fund, a fund used in contributing to the campaigns of many conservative electoral candidates. From these successful beginnings, the American Conservative Union has grown into one of the the most influential lobbying groups in the national government. ACU has worked diligently to fulfill its purpose to promote capitalism, educate the public on what it believes to be the founding fathers’ intent in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, instill confidence in the conservative ideal of moral values, and support a strong national defense. The ACU has worked to influence major national policy, including battling the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, opposing the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties, supporting anti-Marxist revolutionaries in foreign countries, and promoting the need for American deployment of its strategic defenses. As a lobbying organization, the ACU is known for its rating of members of Congress. Annually, the ACU publishes a list of all members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, rating each on his or her adherence to the principles of the conservative philosophy based on votes on all major issues. These ratings find their way into political campaigns and are frequently quoted in the media. Consistently upholding its original Statement of Principles, the American Conservative Union has taken a strong lead in American politics, supported by a nationwide membership and the strong financial backing of its members. With each new administration, the ACU establishes a relationship with the new president, either supporting or fighting presidential public policies. Presidents, senators, and representatives often find themselves caught in the scrutiny of this most conservative of organizations, and the ACU seems intent on maintaining that power.

HICKS UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING\n\n509\n\nAmerican Enterprise Institute THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE Institute for Public Policy Research is a very influential Washington, D.C.based think tank. Founded in 1943, the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) defines itself as a “private, nonpartisan research institution dedicated to the principle that the competition of ideas is fundamental to a free society.” Although the institute is nonpartisan in the sense that both Republicans and Democrats have served on its staff, participated in its programs, or used its resources, the institute consistently reflects a conservative perspective and proposes conservative solutions to policy questions. From its beginnings as a center for economic studies, AEI has broadened its research to include many of the critical political and social issues confronting U.S. society. In 2004, AEI defined itself as an organization “dedicated to preserving and strengthening the foundations of freedom—limited government, private enterprise, vital cultural and political institutions, and a strong foreign policy and national defense—through scholarly research, open debate, and publications.” One important goal of AEI is to influence the formulation of U.S. government policies, both domestic and foreign. To that end, the AEI conducts research and provides analysis and publications on topics that affect the American people and the U.S. global position. The subjects studied and discussed by the AEI cover a wide range. For example, in the 1980s, fellows at AEI debated questions such as “With the trade deficit of the United States growing and the less-developed countries of the world facing unprecedented debt, how should U.S. policy respond?” or “How can public policy help to achieve a balance between an ensured level of quality in the nation’s healthcare and an acceptable cost for providing it?” and “How has the increased power of the media influenced American society?” Under the stewardship of AEI President William J. Baroody, the think tank grew exponentially in the 1970s. Thanks in part to increased financial donations from U.S. corporations, the number of AEI scholars grew from 12 “resident thinkers” to 145 well-funded resident scholars, 80 adjunct scholars, and a large support staff. The ability of the AEI to influence public and government opinion increased as well. Over the years, AEI has established a variety of means to communicate its findings to the public and government officials. AEI research fellows publish their studies in books and pamphlets; they appear on talk shows; and they meet with and/or provide their analysis\n\n510\n\nAmerican Liberty League\n\nto members of Congress, government agencies, and the press. Between 1943 and 1983, AEI published roughly 1,000 titles; in 1983–84 alone, AEI published 78 titles. In 1972, 96 U.S. senators and 391 representatives received AEI publications. AEI has sponsored public debates on television, including the show Rational Debate, which began in 1966; 145 radio stations transmitted AEI debates in the 1970s. In the 1966–67 program, one debate was on “Law, Order and Civil Disobedience,” and featured the Reverend William Sloane Coffin and former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Charles E. Whittaker. In the 1971–72 program, Senator James L. Buckley and Paul Warnke debated “Strategic Sufficiency: Fact or Fiction?” AEI’s magazine, The American Enterprise, is available on the internet. The relationship between conservative sectors and individuals within the U.S. government and AEI is a close one; in fact, some individuals shuttle between the two bodies. President Gerald Ford was a distinguished fellow at AEI, and maintained an office there in the 1970s and 1980s. AEI fellow Jeanne Kirkpatrick distinguished totalitarian governments (the Soviet Union) from authoritarian ones (apartheid South Africa and the Pinochet regime in Chile), the former being unacceptable to the United States and the latter two being acceptable since they opposed communism. Kirkpatrick became President Ronald Reagan’s U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations in the 1980s. Richard Perle, former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy in the Reagan administration and a former member of the Defense Policy Board at the Department of Defense, became a resident fellow at AEI in 2004. Distinguished members of the academic community serve as advisers or work as researchers at AEI. For example, Milton Friedman, the eminent professor of economics at the University of Chicago, was on AEI’s Academic Advisory Board in the 1970s. AEI researchers possess expertise in their particular fields of research, publish prolifically, and frequently appear in public forums expressing their opinions. One reason why the AEI is so visible, productive, and influential is that it is very well funded. The AEI Board of Trustees is composed primarily of corporate executives, and many U.S. corporations have generously donated millions of dollars to support the work of the institute. According to a media watchdog group, between 1992 and 1994 AEI received almost $7 million to finance its work. By 2004 the number of scholars working at AEI had risen to close to 70. Among their numbers are\n\nLynne Cheney, wife of Vice President Dick Cheney; Newt Gingrich, former Republican representative from Georgia and Speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999; Jeanne Kirkpatrick; Michael Novak, who is also a member of the Board of the National Endowment for Democracy; and Christina Hoff Sommers, the anti-feminist author of Who Stole Feminism? and The War Against Boys. Many of AEI’s scholars are ideologically neoconservative and helped to develop the arguments that led to the George W. Bush administration’s 2003 attack on Iraq.

MARGARET POWER ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\n\nAmerican Liberty League THE AMERICAN Liberty League (ALL) existed a short six years, from 1934 until 1940, but still managed to find a place in the history books. The national depression of the 1930s gave rise to many types of organized groups, for example lobbyists, labor unions, coalitions, and cooperatives, all with the same general goal: relief from the effects of the depressed economic situation following the market crash of 1929. ALL was the one conservative group that lobbied for less government interference, less legislation, and less federal funding. Chartered on August 15, 1934, ALL largely consisted of a group of successful businessmen, ones who might have had the most to fear from Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal policies. Funded by the Du Pont family, Alfred P. Sloan (president of General Motors), and other powerful figures, the league could afford to offer no-fee memberships to the public and support activities often denied other groups whose membership lacked big-business support.\n\nAmerican Party In a speech given by Jouett Shouse on September 7, 1934, over national radio, ALL presented its principles, aims, and reasoning for its existence. First and foremost among the themes touted by the league was an opposition to government interference in business and the protection of individual liberties. Its principles were threefold: to “defend and uphold the constitution of the United States ... to teach the necessity of respect for the rights of persons and property as fundamental to every successful form of government ... teach the duty of government to encourage and protect individual and group initiative and enterprise, to foster the right to work, earn, save, and acquire property, and to preserve the ownership and lawful use of property when acquired.” ALL also proclaimed that it was not anti-Roosevelt, was nonpartisan, and was dedicated to helping the national administration guide the country back to economical stability. From the beginning, the American Liberty League utilized the popular press and radio for its educational programs and to lobby for and against proposed legislation and policies. Although self-proclaimed as nonpartisan, the league’s first officers were all opposed to the New Deal, and by the beginning of 1936, it was recognized as one of the most conservative groups in the nation. During the first two years of its existence, ALL became the spokesman for the floundering Republican Party, and the national press looked to it for a conservative and opposing view to New Deal policies. These first two years of its existence were not only the league’s most visual but also the most influential. Appealing to Congress numerous times to oppose those measures and policies that, in its estimation, threatened either the Constitution or property rights or both, ALL often provided the arguments that mitigated federal spending and New Deal legislation. In 1935, the league rallied around Al Smith when he decided to run against Roosevelt for the Democratic nomination. However, Smith refused the offer of such support, fearing that the reputation of ALL would hurt his chances, but his refusal didn’t help him attain the nomination. Roosevelt was the Democrats’ choice. The league turned to the Republican nominee for president, Alf Landon. However, ALL’s fervent and antagonistic attacks on Roosevelt and the New Deal became such an embarrassment that the recovering Republican Party refused the organization’s advocacy. But by this time, the American Liberty League had declared for Landon and publicized its anti-New Deal and anti-Roosevelt stance through propaganda, with claims of the unconstitutionality of much of the New Deal legislation. Many in the\n\n511\n\nRepublican Party, including Landon, felt that their devastating loss in the November election was due in large part to the league. In November 1936, Roosevelt carried all but two states, and the American Liberty League never recovered. Within four years, ALL disbanded. Many historians and analysts, searching for the reasons for the organization’s inability to do more damage to Roosevelt and his New Deal policies, believe that the league’s members and officers lacked a real understanding of the political and economic climate. Their belief in American rugged individualism and the platform of the “American dream” could not provide the relief or recovery the nation sorely needed.

GLORIA J. HICKS UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING\n\nAmerican Party THE AMERICAN PARTY, more commonly known as the Know-Nothings, was a nativist political party existing from 1853 to 1856. In that time, the party claimed 1.25 million members and was successful in electing many of its candidates to both state and national office. The party put forth Millard Fillmore as its presidential candidate in the election of 1856. Fillmore pulled in eight electoral votes and 874,534 popular votes. The party began as a secret society in 1850, known as the Order of the Star Spangled Banner (OSSB), founded in New York City, a hub of immigration. The society’s members took an oath of secrecy, agreeing to conceal the party’s existence. Members pledged to use their votes to remove political power from immigrants\n\n512\n\nAmerican Party\n\nand the politicians who courted them. By 1853, the society was no longer secret and became openly known as the Know-Nothings due to its members’ legendary claim that they knew nothing of such an organization. In 1855, due to internal disputes, many Know-Nothings left the party and joined the newly organized Republicans. Those who remained reorganized and became known as the American Party. At its inception, the original Know-Nothing Party organized against the boom of immigration. From 1845 to 1854, almost 3 million immigrants came into the United States, making up 14.5 percent of the total American population, the highest proportion in American history. Over 40 percent of these immigrants were Irish Catholic, a religion that many Americans considered at odds with the principles of liberty and equality. The Know-Nothings believed fiercely that Protestantism defined American society through its emphasis on individuality and democratic congregations. The system of hierarchy and autocracy within the Catholic Church seemed to challenge the very foundation of American government. Know-Nothings accused the Catholic Church of discouraging individuality and Bible reading, as well as the possibility of having a personal relationship with God, all of which were values they believed the founders held dear. They also believed that the Catholic system of intercession and hierarchy subverted the political system because priests held an enormous amount of power over their congregations in elections. This system, the Know-Nothings held, allowed a minority to wield disproportionate power. The party is best known for its opposition to immigrant voting power. Its best-known slogan was “Americans Must Rule America.” Know-Nothing ideology held that professional politicians actively pursued the votes of ignorant immigrants. These demagogues lacked the virtue of the founding fathers, putting party interests before those of the nation. The party structure needed to be dismantled in order to reestablish traditional political values. Specifically, the party proposed an extension of the naturalization period from five to 21 years and a permanent prohibition on the appointment of any foreign-born individual to political office. Know-Nothings also embraced temperance legislation, blaming alcohol consumption for immigrant immorality. Few Know-Nothings proposed a restriction or end to immigration. Most party leaders only wished to keep the immigrant population politically powerless until individuals were fully Americanized. Their fear was that the founders’ vision was being perverted due to party\n\nThe American Party, or Know-Nothings, ran conservative Millard Fillmore for president in the 1856 election.\n\ncorruption and immigration. Their conservatism rested on a desire to return to the country’s early days when political leaders valued virtue and true republicanism. Practical interests also motivated the nativism in the Know-Nothing Party. Immigrants, party members argued, stole jobs from native-born Americans because they worked for very low wages and glutted the job market. This issue gave the party urban appeal. The party also appealed to rural Americans because of its antislavery platform. Slavery, like Catholicism, was tyrannical and threatened the future of the United States. Both slaveholders and Catholics would never be satisfied with a stagnant existence. Both wished to expand until their interests dominated American society. Slavery, the party argued, disrupted the existence of individualism and economic opportunity. Because of this disruption, slavery could not be allowed to spread to new territories. Its anti-\n\nAmerican Revolution slavery platform allowed many members of the KnowNothing Party to be quietly absorbed by the Republican Party after 1855.

STEPHANIE R. ROLPH MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY\n\nAmerican Revolution THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, as an intellectual, social, political, and military event, can be understood as having begun in 1763 and ended with the inauguration of George Washington as the first president under the federal Constitution in 1789. Although it had extensive democratizing effects, those were largely unanticipated and unintended; the Revolution should be understood as essentially conservative in nature. In the main, the Revolution arose out of the British government’s attempts to govern its enormous empire more rationally, and to spread its burdens more equitably, after the Seven Years’ War. The British victory in that first world war, with the acquisition of an enormous amount of New World territory from France, came at a substantial price. From the point of view of cash-strapped Britons, one logical response loomed: to tax the colonists more. In addition, the newly won territories would be governed on liberal lines and an effort would be made to head off further difficulties with the American Indians. Colonists in 13 of Britain’s 26 New World colonies resisted and/or resented attempts to implement these new policies. Thus, for example, Pontiac’s Rebellion in 1763 led to the establishment of a western boundary to colonial expansion at the peaks of the Appalachian Mountains. Members of elites in all the mainland\n\n513\n\ncolonies, who had invested in land titles in areas now closed to them indefinitely, lamented this policy. Beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764, Parliament attempted to tax the colonists. From the beginning, colonists believed that the new vector of British policy deprived them of two of their most significant rights: the right to be taxed only by their own representatives and the right to trial by jury. In the same year, the Currency Act extended the prohibition on New England legislatures’ printing of legal tender notes to all of the North American colonies. Protests against these measures tended to stress Britons’ inherited rights, not to stake out some ideal argument for the perfection of society. James Otis’s 1764 pamphlet, The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved, typified colonial answers to the new departure of the British government in insisting that the colonists had brought with them to North America all of the rights of Englishmen. Patrick Henry, in his first term as a burgess, sponsored resolutions making similar claims through the Virginia General Assembly in 1765. These arguments against British policy were conservative in that they attempted to preserve the colonial assemblies’ traditional prerogatives. The potential explosiveness of colonial resistance to British policy received its first illustration in the wake of the Stamp Act, which Parliament adopted March 22, 1765. In that law, Parliament undertook to tax various types of products in the colonies, including legal paper, newsprint, playing cards, dice, and a number of other items and types of documents. Parliament dispatched paper to all of the colonies and named stamp agents throughout its New World empire, but the Stamp Act proved to be a revenue loser. Through physical intimidation by groups such as Samuel Adams’s Boston “Sons of Liberty,” the colonists forced stamp agents to resign in most colonies without the distribution of any stamped paper; the act’s costs far exceeded the revenue it yielded. In the end, Parliament saw the futility of its measure and repealed it. By the time it did so, however, it had adopted the Quartering Act, which required the colonists to provide various types of material to support the armed forces quartered in them. More on this score would follow. The push to repeal the Stamp Act yielded strident debate within and outside the House of Commons. Outside Parliament, Thomas Whately asserted in 1765 that while the colonists might not actually be represented in Parliament, they benefited from “virtual representation.” American colonists hooted this assertion down.\n\n514\n\nAmerican Revolution\n\nThe first official congress of representatives from the American colonies issued its declaration October 19, 1765. This Stamp Act Congress, with delegates from nine colonies, assigned the task of drafting a statement of its position to Pennsylvanian John Dickinson, who would stake out a position as a conservative defender of colonial liberties. The Stamp Act Congress began by avowing that it loved the royal dynasty and conceding that colonists owed all the duties owed by subjects in Great Britain; it then said that colonists insisted on all the rights of subjects in Great Britain, and noted that because of the distance separating North America from the mother country, the right not to be taxed without representation amounted to the right of colonists to be taxed only by the colonial assemblies. Within Parliament, opponents of repeal insisted that the principle of Parliament’s power to tax the colonists must not be surrendered. Thus, the act’s repeal came in tandem with adoption of the Declaratory Act of March 18, 1766, Parliament’s assertion of a right to legislate for the colonies “in all cases whatsoever.” While this debate went on, Sir William Blackstone published his Commentaries on the Laws of England, which was destined to become the foremost book in English legal history. There, Blackstone asserted that since Parliament was sovereign, Parliament’s decisions could not be appealed. In addition, he said that sovereignty was indivisible; this assertion would have great repercussions for America, because it meant that Parliament could not simultaneously adhere to Blackstone’s theory of sovereignty and concede that only the colonial legislatures could tax the colonists. BURGESS RICHARD BLAND Partially in response to Blackstone, Burgess Richard Bland of Virginia published his masterwork “An Enquiry into the Rights of the British Colonies” in 1766. Here, for the first time, Bland laid out the theory of colonial history that would underlie the Declaration of Independence 10 years later. According to Bland, the American colonists had come to North America in pursuit of their natural right to emigrate. Having done so, they had entered into a state of nature, and then had created new societies in the way described by John Locke in his Second Treatise: On Civil Government. Having created new societies, Bland said, the colonists were free to invite the English monarchs to be their monarchs too, which they did; having selected the English monarchs for their own purposes, the Americans then remained free to defy them\n\nanytime their performance of their role proved unsatisfactory. Bland’s account of colonial history, building on his and other Virginia pamphleteers’ earlier writings concerning the Old Dominion’s history, was by turns at variance with the standard British account, inconsistent with the actual histories of various of the British colonies, or both. It also provided a theoretical jumping-off point for independence. At the end of his life, Thomas Jefferson noted that Bland, whom he called the foremost constitutional authority he had ever known, had been the first to see the true situation of the Americans and put it into print. Virtually no one wanted independence in 1766, but Jefferson ultimately would base his argument of 1776 on Bland’s of a decade earlier. In 1765, New York’s assembly refused to comply with the Quartering Act lest it establish a precedent for indirect taxation of the colonists by Parliament. In 1767, still intent on extracting revenue from its North American possessions, Parliament adopted the Townshend Acts. Named for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, these acts placed new taxes on glass, tea, painter’s colors, various kinds of lead, and paper imported into the colonies. Colonial anger flared again. From 1767 to 1768, John Dickinson published his Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, in which he laid out a classic argument for American assemblies’ rights. Accepting the rationale of the New York assembly’s refusal to abide by the Quartering Act and finding that law’s effect congruent to the effect of the Stamp Act, Dickinson cautioned that “a dreadful stroke is aimed at the liberty of these colonies.” He insisted that all the colonies were affected, “for the cause of one is the cause of all.” The point at which Parliament could tax colonists without their consent, he said, would be the day they were unfree. “We are taxed without our own consent,” he argued. “We are therefore SLAVES.” In 1768, Parliament tried stationing troops in Boston to cow that most resistant of American cities. Americans, for their part, responded with nonimportation and petitions. Everybody of any consequence in England, from the king to the House of Lords, the House of Commons to various bishops, received public protests from the Americans in these days. When, in 1770, a detachment of British soldiers harassed by a Boston mob finally fired upon them, American propagandists dubbed the shootings “the Boston Massacre,” and word circulated that further outrages were contemplated. The ungovernable Americans continued to insist on receiving the benefits of empire free; the British author-\n\nAmerican Revolution ities persisted in wanting nothing of it. In 1773, Parliament adopted a Tea Act giving the East India Company trade privileges, and thus an enormous price advantage, in America. Massachusetts radicals said that Parliament’s motive was to coax Americans into paying a tax on the tea by offering them tea at a lower price; their answer to the Tea Act was the Boston Tea Party (1773), in which a large quantity of the valuable leaf was dumped into Boston Harbor. Boston’s radical leadership would not see any taxes paid to Britain, come hell or high water. Parliament, in a fit of ill-considered anger, overreacted to the Tea Party by adopting the Intolerable Acts. Here was the fulfillment of the nightmare long at the back of Puritan New England’s collective mind: the Massachusetts charter revised, the port of Boston closed, trials of British officials charged with murder to occur outside New England, and a new Quartering Act further burdening colonists with their own oppression. Again, the point of the resistance was colonists’ insistence on their inherited rights, coupled in the New England colonies with a sense that their societies’ historic mission was imperiled. This feeling gained reinvigoration when the colonies received word of the Quebec Act, a very reasonable measure adopted by Parliament to provide for the government of Britain’s French subjects in Québec. How could Catholics be allowed by a British king and Parliament to keep their Catholicism, and with tax support? How could the unrepublican political culture of Québec be left essentially intact? Solipsistic New England understood the Québec Act as part of Satan’s mission to expunge the True Religion (read: New England’s) from the earth. FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS In 1774, resistance leaders organized the first Continental Congress. Its majority remained decidedly moderate and monarchist, but here was a first step along the road to some kind of continental government. Thomas Jefferson, a young Virginian, rose to prominence with his proposed set of instructions to Virginia’s first congressmen, “A Summary View of the Rights of British America.” There, in language far more confrontational, he told King George the story of America’s founding first adumbrated by Bland in his “Enquiry” nearly a decade before. Congress did not go that far, but it did adopt a new Continental Association as an economic weapon, with nonconsumption and nonimportation of British goods to be implemented in that order and nonexportation to\n\n515\n\nfollow. There the matter lay when, on April 19, 1775, British forces and Massachusetts militiamen confronted each other at Lexington and Concord. Radicals in Congress, seeing the political need for it, selected Virginia’s George Washington to head what was at first a New England army, the Continental Army. That army and its commander became the symbols of American nationality, and they would remain so throughout the war; Congress, a mere assemblage of ambassadors, only coordinated policy. General Washington early recognized that his chief task was simply to keep an army in the field. Britain, recall, had initiated its imperial reforms because of its difficult financial position after the Seven Years’ War, and Washington judged it unlikely that Britain would be able to stomach an American war as long as Americans would. Still, it took over a year for the Americans to declare their independence. Many people, most notably Dickinson and New York’s John Jay, clung to hopes of a negotiated settlement. While the Parliament was not their parliament, in Bland’s argument, the king was their king. Finally, however, George III’s public refusal to consider their petitions, let alone intervene with Parliament, decided the matter for Americans; public opinion received a nudge, too, from Thomas Paine, whose “Common Sense” made independence seem inevitable. Why should an island 3,000 miles away govern a whole continent, he asked. What sense did monarchy make? Even if monarchy were sensible, why concede the majesty of that “royal brute,” George III? On July 2, 1776, Congress voted, on motion from Virginia’s Richard Henry Lee, to adopt a revised version of a declaration of independence drafted by Thomas Jefferson. The chief difference between Jefferson’s draft and the final declaration lay in the excision of Jefferson’s accusations against King George concerning slavery in the United States; some congressmen recognized that George was not responsible for American slavery, while others denied that slavery required any apology. The war effort received declining support from the civil population, and in the end it was only won through the substantial and timely financial, diplomatic, military, and naval assistance of Britain’s mighty rival, France. Congress in the war years repeatedly claimed that the United States’ cause was God’s cause, that British war tactics offended Providence, and that Americans’ duty to the almighty drove them to stand up in defense of rights God had given them. Their ministers supported them in their cause, and the colonial\n\n516\n\nAmerican Revolution\n\nelites (with localized exceptions, particularly in upcountry South Carolina) fell into line behind the Revolution to a degree that shocked British leaders. One of the first results of the Declaration of Independence was the elimination of the proclamation line of 1763, and thus the vindication of wealthy Americans’ substantial western land claims. (Leading investors included George Washington, George Mason, John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, the Morrises … a virtual who’s who of American society.) Indian rights be damned. The exigencies of the war, particularly the sudden creation of a slew of new offices in the state and federal governments, drew a new class of men into political life. Upset with the economic policies those men adopted and by their hesitance to provide adequate manpower and materiel to the Continental Army, reformers led by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and George Washington pushed for a new federal constitution. The Articles of Confederation, drafted by Congress in 1777 and ratified in 1781, dissatisfied them. In 1787, then, continental reformers met at Philadelphia. While the states had been told that this conclave would produce amendments to the Articles, its organizers’ actual goal was to substitute a new constitution for the old one. This new constitution, they believed, should create a congress dominated by the larger states and possessing power to tax and to raise armies without the states’ concurrence. In addition, Madison and his coadjutors desired federal constitutional provisions preventing the democratic state legislatures from passing tax and other laws favoring debtors and common men over creditors and the wealthy. The product of the Philadelphia Convention gave Federalists, as they called themselves, most of what they wanted. In place of highly democratic state legislatures dominated by men representing average farmers, a new, much smaller congress composed of far wealthier and better educated men who could “think continentally” would make America’s most significant policies. In addition, the federal Constitution banned some of the revolutionary era’s most popular forms of debtor relief. When Virginians George Mason and Edmund Randolph, joined by Massachusetts’s Elbridge Gerry, insisted that the draft constitution include a bill of rights, they were ignored. Mason, father of the first American bill of rights and constitution in Virginia in 1776, took this as an ill omen and a personal affront, and he vowed to marshal opposition to ratification in Virginia. Majorities in New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island opposed the new constitution, but Feder-\n\nalists’ skillful management of the ratification process led to those states’ grudging adoption of the Constitution. In Virginia, a close vote for ratification came only after Federalists promised both that a bill of rights would be added to the Constitution by amendment as soon as the first federal Congress met and that Congress would have only those powers it was “expressly delegated.” In other words, Federalists in the most populous, most prestigious state assured opponents led by Mason and Patrick Henry that the Constitution did not threaten home rule. On balance, then, while intended to be counterrevolutionary, the Constitution proved less so than its advocates had hoped. It did remove substantial power from the democratic state governments, but it left more to them than Federalists would have preferred. If the two issues of the Revolution were, then, home rule and who should rule at home, the colonial elites had their way in both regards. The Constitution deprived state governments of power over some questions, but only in those areas in which the continental leadership judged that the Revolution had proven them untrustworthy. The new Congress’s membership, as James Madison hopefully described it in The Federalist #10, would consist of men drawn from a more select group than the state legislatures, and thus more likely to make “wise” decisions. Lest the federal government run amok, however, its powers were narrowly limited. The Revolution, then, began for conservative reasons. It concluded with a conservative measure to rein in its worst (that is, its most democratic) excesses. With the federal Constitution, any possibility of enduring state “agrarianism” was blasted in the name of defending that most defenseless of minorities: the wealthy. Whatever unmanageable social forces it may have unleashed, then, the Revolution thus concluded on a conservative note, too.

GUTZMAN, J.D., PH.D. WESTERN CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY\n\nAnti-Abortion/Pro-Life BOTH THE PRACTICE OF artificially terminating a pregnancy and the debate about its morality are as old as human civilization. Even the Hippocratic Oath, composed in ancient Greece, refers to abortifacents as one of the things doctors were not to administer. But the abortion question became a major political issue in the United States after the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the state could not regulate first-trimester abortions, could only regulate for the woman’s health in the second trimester, and could only regulate on behalf of both woman and fetus in the third, after the fetus reached viability. The Supreme Court based its reasoning upon the principle of the right of privacy, in particular, that a woman’s body is her own business and that she alone should be the one to decide if she wishes to carry to term. Almost immediately after that decision legalized abortion on demand, there was strong opposition from conservative religious groups. In particular, the Roman Catholic Church had a firmly stated position that life begins at conception and that artificially terminating a pregnancy is impermissible, even to save the life of the mother. Thus, it was not surprising that many of the earliest leaders in the opposition to abortion came from the Catholic clergy and laity. Among these Catholic leaders were Joseph Scheidler and John O’Keefe. O’Keefe had been profoundly affected by his brother’s death in combat in Vietnam. He came to oppose violence on the grounds of the harm that killing did to the killer, not the victim, and ultimately became a pacifist. While performing alternative\n\n517\n\nservice as a conscientious objector, he had a lengthy discussion with a woman who had had an abortion. Until that time, he had paid little attention to the question of abortion, beyond knowing that the Catholic Church opposed the procedure on moral grounds. Noticing how the woman seemed obsessed with the need to justify her decision to him, even a year after the event, he concluded that she was still haunted by her choice and was using her self-justification as a substitute for mourning her lost child. This experience convinced O’Keefe that legalized abortion was a major social ill that needed to be dealt with. However, his experiences with existing anti-abortion organizations were unsatisfactory. He considered them little better than debating societies, reading and discussing existing arguments against abortion but never taking any greater action than writing letters to the editors of local newspapers. O’Keefe believed that a greater sacrifice was needed in response to a grave wrong, comparable to those of the civil rights movement and the protests against the Vietnam War. He organized nonviolent protests at abortion clinics in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was one of the first to consider his activities not merely in a symbolic sense, but as actually rescuing the unborn from death. He argued that a woman who went home when confronted with a clinic protest might subsequently choose to keep her baby instead of going to another clinic, and that the life thus saved justified the disruption brought about by the demonstration. By contrast, Scheidler led the movement’s militant wing, forging the first links between peaceful protest and violence. A big man who liked to carry a bullhorn during clinic protests, he was often characterized as a bully by his opponents. He was the first to obtain dead fetuses from a pathology department and use them as visual aids in protests. He argued that such shock tactics were necessary to break through people’s denial and force them to confront the reality of the fetus’s essential humanity. However, his severe claustrophobia made it impossible for him to risk arrest and imprisonment for his beliefs, which undercut Scheidler’s standing in the movement. However, abortion really became a major, divisive issue in American culture when it was brought to the attention of evangelical Protestant denominations. The key event for this shift was Francis Schaeffer’s 1979 book, Whatever Happened to the Human Race?, coauthored by future U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. In this book, Schaeffer and Koop laid out a detailed indictment of American culture for accepting abortion,\n\n518\n\nAnti-Abortion/Pro-Life\n\nand argued that it was not sufficient simply to abstain from having abortions oneself, since the mere acquiescence to the legality of abortion made one complicit in the problem. MORAL MAJORITY In that same year, Baptist minister Jerry Falwell, already well known for his Old Time Gospel Hour television program, created the Moral Majority. This organization was intended to mobilize a supposed silent majority of people in favor of traditional moral values who were being ignored by the media. The plan was to draw together various religious organizations who might not share particular theological views, but did share key moral values, in particular the sanctity of human life. Falwell made opposition to abortion a major part of the group’s agenda, and used the organization’s resources to reach out to other conservative Christian groups and mobilize them in the resistance to legalized abortion. The election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in 1980 gave abortion opponents hope that they would soon see favorable legislation. However, their hopes were quickly frustrated. Although Reagan did appoint Koop as Surgeon General, the desired legislation did not follow. Koop continued to hold his stated opposition to abortion, but he refused to distort facts to support the pro-life cause, particularly in relation to a study about post-abortion psychological problems that abortion opponents wanted to use to prove that abortion was in itself harmful to women’s mental health. Although the Reagan administration proved to be a disappointment for the pro-life movement on the political front, the years of Reagan’s presidency were years of growth for the pro-life movement. William Brennan’s Abortion Holocaust began the practice of comparing abortion to the Nazi genocide of Jews, Gypsies, the disabled, and other so-called undesirables. This imagery became increasingly popular in pro-life literature through the 1980s, until some Jewish organizations began to complain that they were actually ending up undermining people’s sense of the seriousness of the actual Holocaust. Another important document of the pro-life movement from this period was The Silent Scream, a video of an ultrasound taken during an abortion. It was used to show the fetus as a sentient being, responding to its environment and trying futilely to protect itself from the abortion instruments, right to the moment in which it was torn apart and sucked from the womb. However,\n\nabortion providers argued that the video footage had been heavily edited, and that the voice-over narration encouraged the projection of the viewer’s own feelings upon the fetus when in fact one was only seeing random responses of a very primitive sort. Protests at abortion clinics continued, with new tactics including John Ryan’s 1985 move to recruit children for prayer vigils and other appearances in anti-abortion demonstrations. His intent was to lead viewers to mentally connect the fetus to the cute children, but opponents argued that he was exploiting the children and placing them in harm’s way. OPERATION RESCUE It was only with the creation of Operation Rescue by Randall Terry that anti-abortion demonstrations became a mass movement. Terry originally organized Operation Rescue in 1986, but the group came to the forefront of public awareness in 1988 as Terry was able to mobilize thousands of protestors, flooding the entire area around an abortion clinic with human beings. His organization became so powerful that it was pushing the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), one of the leading anti-abortion groups of the time, onto the sidelines. The NRLC chairman, Jack Willke, then retaliated by completely ignoring Operation Rescue, a strategic mistake that effectively divided their forces. Operation Rescue’s first big event was the New York City protest of May 1988, which involved moving 600 protestors, many of them from other locales and unfamiliar with the big city, through the subways to an Upper East Side clinic. To outwit potential opposition, only key personnel were given the full directions or objective. Ordinary protestors were led sheeplike through the lengthy and circuitous route to the targeted clinic. In the narrow confines of some New York City streets, even a few hundred demonstrators could create an overwhelming impasse and effectively block access to the clinic. Buoyed by his success, Terry then organized a similar event in Atlanta, Georgia. However, things did not go so well, and the event was often referred to as the second siege of Atlanta. It was particularly noteworthy for the practice of arrested demonstrators refusing to properly identify themselves, instead giving their names only as “Baby Doe.” By doing this, they were supposed to be identifying with aborted babies, but to many people not already firmly committed to opposing abortion, they only succeeded in making themselves look somewhat ridiculous.\n\nAnti-Abortion/Pro-Life\n\n519\n\nAnti-abortion or pro-life activists often employ disarmingly cute or shockingly real images to drive home their point that a fetus is a bona fide human being. The above is a billboard produced by a Minnesota pro-life organization.\n\nFollowing the disaster of the Atlanta demonstrations, Operation Rescue began to fragment, breaking off into several regional splinter groups. Terry lost overall control of the organization, although he remained one of its important guiding lights. In 1991, the new leadership of Operation Rescue decided to organize another major event, this time in Wichita, Kansas. By moving away from the East Coast to the Midwest, they hoped to tap into a strong culture of traditional values. The targeted abortion clinics made one major tactical mistake in deciding to simply close during the week of the planned protest, then reopen for business as usual after riding out the storm. In doing so, they inadvertently gave encouragement to their opponents, and what had originally been intended as a relatively brief demonstration turned into a lengthy high-energy super-rally known as the Summer of Mercy. As the Operation Rescue demonstrators celebrated each additional day that passed with no abortions performed, the abortion providers grew steadily more desperate, since it was becoming clear that waiting them out indefinitely was not going to be an option. Finally, police were called to forcibly disperse the demonstrators. Although Operation Rescue held several other demonstrations later, none of them ever equaled the Summer of Mercy. There was less interest in participating in mass demonstrations, particularly as a number of\n\nsuccessive court cases were placing restrictions on abortion. To many abortion opponents, these cases looked like such significant progress that demonstration and the rescue movement no longer seemed necessary. CRITICAL LAW CASES One of the most critical of these cases was Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. In this 1989 case, the Supreme Court ruled that states may require viability testing after the 20th week of pregnancy, and allowed states to outlaw abortion in public hospitals and to forbid public employees from assisting in abortions. Since many poor women would not be able to afford the fees of private abortion clinics, this ruling was effectively a major restriction on the availability of abortion. The following year saw Rust v. Sullivan, which upheld federal regulations forbidding abortion counseling at federally funded clinics. Critics of the case saw it as yet another strike against poor women’s choices, since they often did not have the option of going to a private clinic that would not be constrained from including abortion among the options they would discuss for dealing with an unintended pregnancy. Another 1990 case required minors to obtain parental consent in order to obtain an abortion. However, in 1992, Planned Parenthood of Eastern Pennsylvania v. Casey upheld Roe v. Wade by a margin of\n\n520\n\nAnti-Abortion/Pro-Life\n\nfive to four. Although the Supreme Court did rule that states might require counseling or waiting periods before a woman could obtain an abortion, it left intact the principle that a woman should have the right to choose whether to terminate her pregnancy. The rescue movement took a major blow in 1994 with National Organization for Women v. Scheidler, which opened the door for prosecuting people who block access to abortion clinics under racketeering laws. Suddenly getting arrested in a clinic demonstration was no longer a trivial matter of spending a few days in jail and paying a small fine for misdemeanor trespassing or disturbing the peace. Instead, protestors could now face felony convictions that would mean years in jail. VIOLENT OPPOSITION However, even as the mass demonstrations of the rescue movement were dying down, a new and darker side of the anti-abortion movement was becoming prominent, namely the violent opposition. Most of the groups organized to oppose abortion, including the National Right to Life Committee and the Christian Coalition, disapproved of illegal acts. Even organizations such as Operation Rescue, which encouraged acts of civil disobedience, drew the line at violent crime. However, the outer fringes of anti-abortion activism were growing steadily convinced that any action was justified if it saved unborn lives, even to the point of taking born lives. These fringe activists often argued that the abortionists’ lives were already forfeit as shedders of innocent blood. The violent undercurrent to the anti-abortion movement had been present from its earliest days. Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who wrote the Roe v. Wade decision, had been the recipient of hate mail and even death threats for years, reaching a peak in 1985 when an unknown assailant shot at him. This was not long after the bombing of three clinics in Pensacola, Florida, on Christmas Day, 1984. Fortunately, the clinics were not open at the time and no one was hurt, although thousands of dollars of damage was done to equipment and physical plant, closing the clinics for significant periods of time. Michael Bray, an anti-abortion leader involved in these early abortion clinic bombings, developed theological arguments justifying violent action against abortion providers. Although he had argued that violent action was acceptable, even mandated by God, to save innocent unborn lives, he had always stopped short of saying that it was acceptable to kill in defense of the un-\n\nborn. With these justifications, the violent fringe began to coalesce into an amorphous organization calling itself the Army of God, and carried out a series of increasingly violent attacks on abortion clinics and even doctors and other employees. While the earliest acts of violence were often carefully timed to ensure that the targeted clinics were empty and only property would be destroyed, later attacks abandoned Bray’s caveat against the taking of lives and deliberately targeted clinic personnel. In one of the most notorious attacks, a sniper shot and killed abortion doctor David Gunn. The culprit, Michael Griffin, was later captured and ultimately sentenced to life in prison for his action. After Gunn was murdered, his job was taken over by Dr. John Bayard Britton, who was subsequently murdered by another anti-abortion activist, Paul Hill. This sequence of violent murders led many mainstream churches and anti-abortion organizations, which had previously given tacit approval to the violent fringe, to instead firmly condemn anyone who resorted to violence in the fight against abortion. Griffin and Hill would not become folk heroes of the anti-abortion movement, unlike the way John Brown had become a folk hero of the abolitionists after being sentenced to death for leading the raid upon the federal armory at Harper’s Ferry, Virginia. Some pro-lifers, completely disgusted by what they perceived as a betrayal of the sanctity of life by the very people who claimed to be protecting it, began forging links with pro-choice groups to create an organization known as the Common Ground Network for Life and Choice. Many hoped to thus find a way to balance the interests of both the woman and the unborn child, instead of subjugating one to the other, but these people were often regarded as suspect by members of their own organizations for compromising with the hard-line stance. During the second half of the 1990s, the tactics of mainstream anti-abortion organizations shifted away from trying to stop abortion altogether to nibbling away at one procedure after another. Their particular target was a technique they termed a “partial-birth abortion.” This technique, used for very late-term abortions, involved dilating the cervix enough to pull the body of the fetus through the birth canal, then aspirating the brain to collapse the skull enough to get it out. Pro-life leaders argued that this procedure was being used as a method of convenience for women who had carelessly delayed until the last possible minute, while pro-choice medical personnel argued that the procedure was al-\n\nApartheid most never used except in cases where a fetus with severe congenital defects could not be brought to term without undue risk to the mother. Even as anti-abortion activists were raising a furor about partial-birth abortions, the actual incidence of abortion in the United States was going down. Sociologists studying the phenomenon have concluded that this shift is not so much the result of anti-abortion activism but rather a function of contraception becoming more a part of mainstream life. However, anti-abortion activism left a permanent mark on the American political landscape. Opposition to abortion brought fundamentalist Christians back into worldly politics, and facilitated the creation of the religious right as a political force to be reckoned with. Although they were not able to achieve a victory against abortion, the experience had shown them that they could make a difference in secular society, and they soon saw other causes worthy of their attention.

More generally, apartheid can be used to describe any polity in which there is compulsory and legally sanctioned segregation of the races. Such a situation was prevalent in many parts of the American south up until the 1960s. The origins of apartheid in South Africa go back to the earliest European settlements. The early Dutch East Indian settlers, who settled Cape Town in 1652, classified their society according to race. Until 1834, Afrikaner society operated with slavery and almost all nonslave blacks were at the bottom of society. There was, in other words, an almost total overlap of race and social class in which those at the top were almost exclusively white. Despite this, as the 19th century progressed, there were gradually more egalitarian political developments. The nonracial franchise gave the right to vote to all moderate property holders. This included a few blacks as well as persons of mixed race. These developments were later reversed as the number of eligible blacks increased. Additionally, the late 19th century witnessed an increase in white supremacist laws and practices, including the introduction of poll taxes. An early version of apartheid segregation existed in Natal under the Shepstone System. Shepstone was the colonial supervisor of “native affairs” in 1846. The system established an early form of homelands for blacks. Further developments toward racial segregation existed in the Mines and Works Act (1911), which established racial segregation in employment; the Native Land Act (1913), which divided land ownership on the basis of race; and the Native (Urban Areas) Act (1923), which set up a system of urban racial segregation. From the 19th century on, blacks were subject to a series of pass laws. These laws controlled the mobility of nonwhites. THE PARTY SLOGAN\n\nLEIGH KIMMEL, PH.D. INDEPENDENT SCHOLAR\n\nApartheid IN A SPECIFIC SENSE, apartheid is a description of the political regime in South Africa from 1948 to 1990, in which there was state-sanctioned and enforced racial segregation. The word is an Afrikaner term that literally\n\nThe first widespread use of the term apartheid emerged as a slogan of the Gesuiwerde Nasionale Party (later the Herenigde Nasionale Party or HNP) in the mid-1930s. In this era, the prime minister, J.B.M. Hertzog, espoused a philosophy of territorial segregation and racial preference for whites that was essentially an apartheid vision. The Afrikaner nationalism that bolstered such views borrowed ideological elements and a range of invented folk traditions, symbols, and rituals from the Nazi ideology of Hitler’s Germany. While Afrikaner nationalism was uncomfortable with the violent excesses of the\n\n522\n\nApartheid\n\nNazi persecutions, it was comfortable with its social Darwinist and eugenicist racist belief systems, and in sympathy with its conceits of Nordic volk (folk) greatness. A small group of Afrikaner intellectuals founded a Suid-Afrikaanse Bond vir Rassestudie (South African League for Racial Studies) in 1935. Prominent among the intellectuals was Professor Gert Cronje, who published Regverdige Rasse-apartheid (Justifiable Racial Separation) in 1947. The HNP won the 1948 election and began systematically to implement the policy. In the 1940s and 1950s there were a series of new and important acts under the premierships of the Malan and H.F. Verwoerd National Party that established the framework of the apartheid state. The underlying principle was that of aparte ontwikkeling (separate development). The goal of Verwoerd was nothing less than the complete and unambiguous decoupling of white and black destinies in every sphere of existence. So determined was the government to achieve apartheid’s goals that it stacked the courts and the senate in order to manipulate the defeat of constitutional provisions that would have guaranteed certain rights to the colored (mixed-race) population. The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act (1949) and the so-called Immorality Act (1950) prohibited marriage and even consensual sexual relations between the races. The Population Registration Act (1950) classified people according to four designated races, white, colored (mixed race), “Asiatic,” and “Bantu” (black African). The Group Areas Act (1950) and other similar legislation compelled individuals of different races to be resident in distinct designated areas. The Reservation of Separate Amenities Act (1953) enforced apartheid in social and cultural settings, while the Bantu Education Act (1953) introduced a separate and distinctly unequal system of racialized educational provision. The Native Resettlement Act (1954) forcibly removed African residents from Johannesburg. Each of these acts was an ingenious contribution to the overall attempt to guarantee white minority dominance into the indefinite future. In this time period, white European variants of support for apartheid came to be referred to through the use of two Afrikaner terms, verligte (enlightened) and verkrampte (unenlightened). From the 1950s until the end of the apartheid regime, these terms defined the principal options available to white South Africans as they reflected on the future and stability of their regime. While both tendencies supported the regime in principle, the verkrampte voices supported the more reactionary "
