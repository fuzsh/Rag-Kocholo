Each entry provides a capsule summary of a group followed by an account of origins and early history, cultural life, and recent developments. Collectively, the entries highlight the dynamic process of ethnicity: ethnic groups may persist for centuries, but they change and often branch into new groups or merge into other populations. Driving this dynamism are a number of factors, among them migration, war, religion, and, especially since the 19th century and continuing to the present day, nationbuilding. While most individual entries chronicle the changing fortunes of single groups, the process of ethnicity is perhaps best seen in regional context. Readers are encouraged to peruse entries covering neighboring groups, such as the Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Greeks, for example, or the Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes, to gain an appreciation for the ways ethnic and national identities are constructed and contested. This introduction discusses the concept and practice of ethnicity (and nationalism), and then addresses historic and contemporary trends in Europe. The short essay on methodology that follows this essay explains the criteria for inclusion in the volume.\n\nEthnic Groups, Nations, and States It is tempting to regard ethnic groups as fixed and enduring. But ethnicity is better described as a process that combines two mutually reinforcing forms of identification. First, an ethnic group refers to a population that regards itself as a people bound by common origins, shared experience and culture, and quite possibly a distinct language and religious practice. Second, this act of self-identification is always made with reference to other groups with whom the ethnic population interacts or shares an area or both. The setting for interethnic interaction is usually a vii\n\nviii\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nsociety, an orbit of patterned social relations typically framed by the political boundaries of a kingdom, nation-state, or empire. Of course, to understand any ethnic group it is important to grasp the distinct cultural content of its identity. This content can and often does change over time. New expressions and forms enrich and alter languages, people take up new livelihoods as old industries fade, and the content and context of faith may change with the development of heresies and establishment of new orthodoxies. A passing acquaintance with English history, for example, demonstrates such changes. The English language gained thousands of new expressions and words with the 11th-century invasion of French-speaking Normans (themselves Frenchified Vikings), the English population adopted Protestantism when Henry the VIII broke with Rome, and a nation of farmers became factory workers with industrialization. Along each point in this historical arc, people in the country saw themselves as properly English—though of course more exclusive local identities or, later, the more inclusive British identity featured prominently in people’s lives too. Most of the entries in this volume demonstrate similar processes of change and continuity in ethnicity identity and experience. Anthropologists, who study ethnicity in contemporary cross-cultural contexts, have confirmed both the fluid nature of the cultural content of group identity and the tendency of people to regard identity as fixed and inviolate. Anthropology’s most powerful insight, however, has been the revelation of the signal importance of interaction, or boundary maintenance, in ethnicity. It is no exaggeration to say that ethnic categories persist precisely because of interaction; far from dissolving ethnic identity, interaction enacts it by publicly contrasting group membership. Distinctions between groups are frequently preserved through mutually exclusive definitions of group belonging, reinforced through prohibitions on intermarriage, for example, or restrictions on social interaction. Yet, even in the rare cases in which people routinely move from one group to another, distinct ethnic categories persist because new members adopt the appropriate code of behavior and selfidentification. It is worth stressing that a concern for one’s ethnicity is unevenly distributed. If a group is geographically concentrated in a homeland, members residing along ethnic borders are far more conscious of the requirements for publicly demonstrating adherence to their group. Likewise, individuals who frequently interact with other groups, such as traders or migrants or political leaders, are typically quite attentive to the needs of ethnic boundary maintenance. Finally, relations between groups strongly influence the tenor of interethnic relations, including the relative porosity of borders, group autonomy, and the extent and forms of interaction. A group may interact easily with others and live in mixed neighborhoods or regions, or they may interact rarely with others and only then hedged with restrictions. Economically, a group may enjoy more or less parity with others, or possess much less or more in the way of access to valued resources and livelihoods. Politically, a group\n\nIntroduction |\n\nmay enjoy autonomy in terms of decision making and dispute resolution, or it may participate on equal footing with other similar groups within the same society, or it may be plainly dominant or subordinate. The entries in this volume describe virtually every possible combination of social, economic, and political relations among ethnic groups in Europe. This volume adopts an inclusive definition of the term ethnic group. The entries to follow describe indigenous populations such as the Saami of Scandinavia, dispersed minorities such as Jews and Roma, distinct and regionally based populations such as the Avars and Dargins in Dagestan in the southern reaches of the Russian Federation, and nationalities such as Bulgarians and Norwegians. While populations such as the Saami, Roma, and Avars accord with the common usage of the term ethnic group as minority in a larger social system, the inclusion of nationalities under this general rubric requires explanation. As many commentators have noted, the principal difference between ethnic groups and nationalities is that the latter are defined by a political boundary, possess the institutional forms of a nation-state (or subsections thereof), and do not necessarily claim shared ancestry. The French, to take an oft-cited example, typically regard themselves as such by virtue of membership and participation in a republic defined by political boundaries and shared political process and democratic ideals. The French state does not recognize ethnicity (or the related category of race), and individual immigrants are expected to become French by adopting the laws and customs of the land. And yet some very influential French politicians do hold essentially an ethnic (some would say racial) view of the nation. Thus, ethnic nationalists such as Jean Marie Le Pen claim that certain kinds of immigrants (Muslim or dark-skinned or both) cannot become “real” French, even if they hold French citizenship. A number of other entries, for example those on successor states to the Soviet Union or the states emerging from the former Yugoslavia, also reveal the contemporary power of ethnic definitions of the nation. Indeed, the journal Nationalities Papers: The Journal of Nationalism and Ethnicity is devoted to just such questions with a geographical focus on Central Europe, the Balkans, the former Soviet Union, and Caucasus as well as the Turkic world and Central Asia. Nor is the relevance of ethnicity to nationality solely contemporary. The treatment of group history—a part of every entry—reveals the ethnic core of many of today’s nationalities, including those like the French that tend to stress their civic as opposed to ethnic nature. This is not to say that all nationalities stem from ethnic cores, nor to dismiss the very real distinctions between ethnicity and nationality, or between ethnic and civic forms of national identity. It is to argue, however, that treating these diverse forms of social organization between the covers of a single volume is merited, given similarities in the process of identity formation and in observable patterns of interaction. There are also educational and practical motives for this inclusive approach to ethnicity in Europe. This encyclopedia is one of several projected volumes designed to cover ethnic groups around the world; all volumes share the same four-part entry\n\nix\n\nx |\n\nIntroduction\n\ntemplate, the contents of which include nationalities as well as ethnic populations; and all are geared to a general readership in terms of language and presentation. Because the primary purpose of the project is educational, rather than advancing a theoretical argument for a specialist readership, nationalities are included along with more conventionally defined ethnicities. Moreover, the exclusion of nationalities would have entailed unbalanced geographical coverage, with a focus on the former Soviet Union, where there are countless recognized ethnicities, for reasons discussed at some length below. With this volume’s more inclusive approach, readers can appreciate the differences and similarities between nations and ethnic groups, as well as the contours and consequences of interactions between such populations.\n\nPatterns and Prospects The model and reality of the nation-state is the single most important context for understanding ethnic groups. In Europe, the model came to prominence in the 19th century, inspiring many peoples to demand independence; it was sanctified in the principle of the right to self-determination espoused by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and utilized in the Treaty of Versailles at the conclusion of World War I; and it is given tacit support by the criteria of admission (statehood) for highly influential supranational organizations such as the United Nations and the European Union. True, several notable multinational (or multiethnic) states exist, such as Spain and the United Kingdom, as do self-consciously civic nations with recognized linguistic diversity, such as Switzerland. And it could be persuasively argued that the pure nation-state is in fact a rarity. However, the notion that statehood is the ultimate legitimate form of political organization for a given people has inspired and continues to inspire ethnic groups seeking independence (sometimes referred to as ethno-national movements). Conversely, the conviction that states should represent the interests of a people united by common culture, not to mention the evident political dividends of cultivating common cause in an era of popular democracy, has been used to justify, at least until recent decades, the promotion of national cultures as well as the suppression of regional and ethnic diversity and autonomy. And of course dispersed populations without a state, such as Jews and Roma, are at a distinct disadvantage in such a world. These twin processes are clearly manifest in the realm of language use and policy. Because of its close association with group identity, language often acts as a key indicator of group membership. Where a dominant language exists, national elites have typically established academies to safeguard the purity of their tongue and celebrate its beauty, as in the case of the academies of Sweden and France. Where ambiguity resides, aspiring nationalists have turned to identifying the dialect(s) that can serve as the basis of a distinctive national language. In the 19th century, Norway\n\nIntroduction |\n\nwas under nominal Swedish control and much of its elite culture and written language (riksmål or bokmål) was essentially Danish, thanks to nearly 300 years of earlier Danish control. Such was the popular and political support for a distinctive Norwegian tongue that nynorsk, the creation of language reformer Ivar Aasen based on rural western dialects, became the second official language in 1885. To take a contemporary example, Montenegro, which had remained part of Serbia after the break-up of the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, declared independence from Serbia in 2006. While a slim majority of Montenegrins see themselves as distinct from Serbs, many regard themselves as Serbs and all acknowledge a shared history and culture, including language. Significantly, the 2007 constitution declared as the official language the Ijekavian variant of the Shtokavian dialect of SerboCroatian—just as the Croatian Constitution identifies Croatian as its official language and Serbia’s as Serbian. (The principle difference is that Croats use the Latin alphabet, Serbs the Cyrillic.) In most cases past and present, the official language is promoted above regional dialects or minority languages and is taught in schools, ensuring its dominance. Borders also play a signal role in relations between ethnic groups and states. If we are a nation within our own state, then the treatment of our cousins abroad can become a foreign policy issue. Such concern can take many forms. A state may officially recognize conationals abroad, as does Slovenia, and perhaps extend to conationals streamlined access to residency and eventual citizenship, as in the case of ethnic Germans (Aussiedler) welcomed home to Germany from Eastern Europe. Or a state may lay claim to ethnic minorities abroad in a bid for symbolic gains. For example, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece all claim kinship with the Slavic-speaking Muslim Pomaks, who reside in these respective countries as well as in Romania, Macedonia, and Albania. Bulgarians also say that Macedonians are really their own kinsmen, while Greeks insist that only they may accurately use the term Macedonian because they claim that the ancient Macedonians—most notably Alexander the Great—were Greek. Needless to say, Macedonians reject such claims and assert their own autonomy as the Macedonian people. War provides a dramatic and traumatic context for ethnic conflict. At the end of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), for example, some 2 million people were relocated in what was one of Europe’s largest population exchanges. Out of the ashes of the multiethnic Ottoman Empire, Turkey and Greece sought to establish themselves as nation-states, and consequently all Greek Orthodox believers in Turkish territory were sent to Greece and all Muslims in Greek territory were removed to Turkey. At the risk of engaging in sweeping generalization, it might be stated that within Europe far greater numbers of ethnic groups and perhaps a greater incidence of ethno-national claims are found in the Balkans and Central and Eastern Europe. In part, this is the result of timing, namely the earlier formation of nation-states\n\nxi\n\nxii\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nin Western Europe. In the days before widely acknowledged minority rights and identity politics, modernizing states to the west consciously eroded the material and symbolic supports of ethnic and regional populations. Language policies outlawing or restricting the use of local language exemplify this process. Breton was long forbidden in French schools in Brittany, for example, and students in 19th-century Ireland once wore around their necks tally sticks that recorded the punishable infractions of speaking Gaelic in school. Also important to the relative paucity of ethno-nationalism in the contemporary West is the widespread recognition of ethnic minority rights as well as, in a number of cases, forms of political autonomy. (These are described in more detail below.) To the east, ethnic groups and forms of nationalism seem to prevail, not least because of the longevity of multinational empires and, later, the policies of the former Soviet Union. The Russian Federation and other successor states to the Soviet Union represent enormous ethnic diversity—indeed, nearly a third of this volume’s 100-plus entries are devoted to ethnic and national groups in just the European sphere of the country. Considering the magnitude of such diversity, the Russian situation merits close attention. Current ethnic diversity there stems in large measure from the demographic legacy of the sprawling Russian Empire, most of the territories of which were reacquired by the Bolsheviks in the years immediately following the Russian Civil War. The Soviet Union’s self-consciously novel nationalities program, however, did much to promote—and sometimes destroy—ethnic and national identity. Lenin and Stalin, the architects of the plan, adopted the Wilsonian principle of the right to self-determination as a necessary step in the advance of international socialism. They had paid close attention to the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, noting the power of nationalism to inspire people as well as the economic development that appeared to accompany this powerful cross-class mobilization. By cultivating nationalism among the constituent peoples of the USSR, they hoped to harness this seemingly inevitable modernizing force. At the same time they were keenly aware of the historical animosity toward Russians harbored by many of the peoples formerly subjugated by the empire. By supporting the right to self-determination of non-Russians, Lenin and Stalin hoped to gain their allegiance to the socialist cause. The resulting program, often labeled “indigenization” (korenizatsiya), was initiated in the 1920s. Groups were granted what amounted to the forms and institutions of the nation-state, namely a homeland, national culture, and official language. Peoples were typically granted a territory in which they comprised the majority and could influence affairs. The size and type of territory varied, from Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs) for the most populous peoples like Ukrainians, to Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSRs) for regionally significant populations like the Kalmyks and Udmurts, to smaller units such as Autonomous Oblasts for peoples such as the Adygey and Chechens, to still smaller Autonomous Okrugs for\n\nIntroduction\n\npopulations such as the Komi. Whenever possible, the collectivization of agriculture and establishment of industry secured the economic base for socialist development. Indigenous elites were promoted to positions of leadership; by cultivating local power holders of proletarian origins, the Soviets aimed to avoid the plague of “bourgeois” nationalism by which capitalists endeavor to direct the currents of nationalism for their own ends. National cultures were documented and celebrated in folklore studies and enshrined in museums. National languages were also established. In cases of literate peoples such as Belarusians, the national tongue was standardized and indigenous literature supported. In the case of nonliterate peoples, of whom there were many in the southern, northern, and eastern reaches of the USSR, teams of linguists and ethnographers established written languages, typically using the Latin script rather than the Cyrillic, which would have recalled perhaps the heavy-handed Russification policies of the empire. In this fashion dozens of written languages were established by the mid-1930s and, together with the construction of a school system, secured significant gains in literacy rates among non-Russians. Local elites welcomed at least some of these developments and willingly accepted greater power within their territories. Overall, the indigenization campaign clearly demonstrates the power of the central state to set conditions for the maintenance and even creation (and destruction) of ethnic groups. For example, the Balkars and Karachay, two Turkic-speaking and Muslim populations in the central North Caucasus, were long considered a single people. The dialects upon which their written languages were based in the 1920s are virtually identical, and both groups have long histories as pastoralists. For census purposes, however, the groups were considered distinct. In the case of the Balkars, they were named after one of their five loosely affiliated tribes (the Malquar), and their official language was based on the dialect of two others (the Bakhsan and Chegem). In a similar fashion the closely related Adyghs and Kabards were deemed distinct, as were the Dargins and Avars in Dagestan. As Terry Martin describes in The Affirmative Action Empire, Soviet policy toward non-Russians ran on two tracks, sometimes reinforcing, sometimes contradictory. Soft-line institutions like the nationalities office entertained amicable relations with non-Russians and concerned themselves with folklore and language and museums, while hard-line institutions such as the secret police and Communist Party exercised vigilance over minorities and utilized violence, intimidation, and other measures in the name of socialism. The principle message was that non-Russian nationalism was not an end in itself, but rather a stage on the road to international socialism. By the late 1930s the program, never popular with the Russian-dominated Communist Party, was curtailed and a new era of Russification was begun, this time under the rubric “Friendship of Peoples.” Latin script was dropped in favor of Cyrillic to facilitate communication in Russian; nonRussian identity became suspect, especially for cross-border populations; and the\n\n|\n\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nhegemony of ethnic Russians in the organs of state and economy was all but assured. Following World War II, Stalin chose to punish peoples who had supposedly collaborated with Nazis. Whole populations, such as the Balkars, Chechens, Ingush, Kalmyks, and Karachays, were stripped of their property and banished to Central Asia. Only after Stalin’s death were these groups rehabilitated and allowed to return to their homelands. However, they often returned to find others, competing ethnic groups or Russians or both, in their houses and farms—a point of interethnic tension that remains raw even today. Subsequent to the breakup of the USSR, ethnicity has featured predictably and prominently in political conflict, both domestic and international. Within Russia itself, the nationalist agenda of Vladimir Putin’s administration has rolled back whatever gains for ethnic recognition emerged in the brief period of ethnic revival in the 1990s. In the key area of education, for example, Russian continues to dominate as the language of instruction while offerings in indigenous languages shrink. Thus few young Mari and Mordvin are proficient in the tongue of their grandparents, with deleterious effects on ethnic identity. Some groups, typically far from Moscow and keenly aware of past and present Russian attempts at dominance, have taken up arms in a quest for autonomy. The bloodiest such uprising has taken place in Chechnya, where some ethnic Chechens have been fighting Russian forces or their Chechen allies since 1994. Ethnicity has also figured in headline-grabbing clashes with former Soviet republics (SSRs). Take the case of the Ossetians, a population whose territory spans the Georgia-Russia border. Objecting to the invasion of the Georgian army (1990– 1992) after South Ossetia’s declaration of independence, Russia recognized South Ossetian autonomy in a move receiving virtually no support from the international community of states. For its part, Georgia decried Russia’s activities as a thinly veiled attempt to stoke an Ossetian independence movement within its borders and regarded Ossetians with suspicion. In 2008 the Russian army invaded Georgian territory and together with South Ossetian separatists established control over the disputed territory, which again declared its independence from Georgia. For the foreseeable future Ossetian ethnicity will be inextricably linked to the struggle between Georgia and Russia. In a number of former SSRs, elites have pursued an aggressive nationalist agenda and attempted to de-Russify their countries. In 1991, Estonia denied citizenship to nearly one-third of its population, on the grounds that they or their parents had entered during the USSR’s illegal annexation of the country (1940–1989). In response to the concerns of Western development organizations and especially the European Union, to which Estonia successfully sought admittance, Estonia was required to demonstrate attention to minority rights and a pathway to citizenship. Estonians, still smarting from half a century of Soviet domination, have made proficiency in Estonian the principal requirement for citizenship, a challenge that relatively few\n\nIntroduction\n\nethnic Russians have been able to accomplish. Given the presence of ethnic Russians in a number of former Soviet republics, ethnicity will continue to figure in domestic and international politics for some time. Current EU protections of ethnic minorities build on legislation initiated in the immediate post–World War II period. Revolted by the atrocities committed by the Nazis in their quest to establish a new racial order in Europe, a number of European countries repudiated racism and established prohibitions on expressions of racial ideology. The following decades would see additional prohibitions on other forms of discrimination, including those based on nationality and ethnicity. Notwithstanding these laws, ethnic discrimination and even violence has not disappeared, a sorry fact most clearly manifested in the mistreatment of the Roma, Europe’s largest and most dispersed ethnic minority. Also important to ethnic relations has been a trend in some countries toward decentralization. Rejecting the centralization of power and suppression of ethnic minorities characteristic of the Franco period, in the late 1970s Spaniards granted a significant measure of political autonomy to 17 autonomous regions. In Catalonia, the Basque area, and Galicia— the homelands of recognized historical nationalities—the Catalan, Basque, and\n\nEuropean Union Policy on Minorities Countries seeking admittance to the European Union (EU) must demonstrate respect for and protection of minority rights at legislative, institutional, and practical levels. The process of creating/amending national legislation to meet the antidiscrimination requirements, the so-called Copenhagen (1993) criteria adopted into EU primary law under the Amsterdam Treaty (1997), emphasizes the reduction of disadvantages and the assurance of equal opportunity for all citizens. Members of national minorities should be free to express, preserve, and develop their distinctive culture and practices, including their language, as long as democratic procedures, the rule of law, and the rights of others are respected. In practice, this policy concerns groups who self-identify on the basis of ethnic, linguistic, or religious criteria; such groups include peoples long resident as well as recent arrivals. European minority policy also draws support from the Council of Europe (an organization distinct from the EU), which issued the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (1995). The absence of common systematic monitoring of government policies and practices toward minorities, and the nonapplicability of Copenhagen criteria to EU member states, however, undermines postenlargement minority protection. Sergiu Gherghina\n\n|\n\nxv\n\nxvi |\n\nIntroduction\n\nGalician languages share co-official status with Castilian (Spanish). Out of this new political environment has emerged a sense of compatible, dual identities combining the national and the regional. Similar patterns of dual identification appear to be developing in the United Kingdom as well, another state that has adopted the devolution of political power. It is an open question whether some form of European identity will emerge out of the manifold cross-border interconnections supported by the European Union, and join regional and national forms of identification. If it does, it would surely be of such a civic quality that the term ethnic would scarcely apply—unless European Union politics takes an unlikely ethnic turn. No review of ethnicity in contemporary Europe would be complete without consideration of postwar immigration. In broad strokes, former colonial powers such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands drew on their (former) overseas territories to meet the labor demands of the economic boom of the 1960s and early 1970s. Countries without such an option, such as Germany and Switzerland, drew on countries along the Mediterranean. Policy makers envisioned such flows as temporary, but by the 1970s the many immigrants decided to settle, creating in effect new ethnic communities, often of non-European origins. Starting in the late 1980s, former labor exporters such as Italy and Spain became destinations for immigrants hailing from around the globe. Ethnic diversity has increased still more with the recent eastward expansion of the EU and the consequent increase in intra-European population flows. While hard times and a less than enthusiastic reception from the majority population have greeted many immigrant groups, as a rule it has been those of non-European origins who have endured the greatest hardship. Despite the fact that many are often born and raised in Europe, these groups face the highest unemployment, experience pronounced discrimination, and live in the most undesirable areas with the worst schools and other services. In the vocal opinion of the European ethnic nationalists who have gained increasing popular support across the continent, these immigrant-origins populations will remain forever foreign by virtue of their background and religion and therefore cannot and will not fit into European society. In some countries these ethnic nationalist forces have succeeded in passing restrictive citizenship laws that make very difficult the naturalization of legal immigrants and their children, a course of action that impedes the successful integration of newcomers. Some commentators prefer to describe the situation of non-European origins populations in terms of racism, a term that both acknowledges the colonial past of many even as it stresses the severity of their disadvantage and the essentialist claims of their detractors. Regrettably, this volume can offer only limited coverage of ethnicity as it relates to immigration. This limitation stems in large measure from the nature of the entry template described above, which privileges ethnic and national populations indigenous to Europe (recall that the title refers to ethnic groups of,\n\nIntroduction |\n\nnot in, Europe). Within this constraining framework, immigration is addressed in two ways. Short sidebars give key facts concerning such settled immigrant populations, for example regarding people of Turkish origins in Germany and Algerian origins in France. And, where appropriate, entries include information on immigration trends and the relation of immigrant identity to national identity. Recent scholarship on immigration issues has contributed especially to our understanding of citizenship and cognate issues of belonging and identity. Readers interested in learning more about these issues of signal importance to Europeans will find several relevant titles listed below. In sum, in Central and particularly Eastern Europe, ethnicity today tends to involve interaction among indigenous groups, interactions that range from harmonious coexistence to vigorous ethno-nationalist claims and even violence. Given the recognition of minority rights and the significant degree of political autonomy afforded many recognized indigenous ethnicities to the west, the term ethnicity there most commonly calls to mind populations, whether recent immigrant or settled, of non-European origins. In view of their origins, claims of an ethnonational stamp are simply not conceivable; rather their principle concern is the recognition of their civic and human rights (including, in some cases, the right to be different) and better prospects for advancement within their adopted societies and cultures.

Despite differences in scale and organization, in all cases there exists a group consciousness or identity grounded in shared experience and history as well as acknowledgment of group identity on the part of others, particularly the state. However, excluded from the list of entries are those populations that are not generally acknowledged to be ethnically distinct. For this reason the residents of Gibraltar, that polyglot and cosmopolitan British overseas territory, are not included, nor are the people of San Marino, a microstate that is essentially Italian in all but passport and tax code, nor are residents of the decidedly multiethnic microstate of Vatican City. As a rule, regional populations, who may in fact share important experiences and a dialect, have not been included unless acknowledged as distinct in some way, most commonly by the government of the country in which they live. Thus the Frisians and Friulians, whose languages are granted co-official status along with the national tongues in their respective regions, receive entries, whereas the Sicilians and Bavarians, whose dialects do not receive such status, have no separate entry. Starting with this inclusive approach, groups were selected on the basis of size and geography. As for size, the minimum population for inclusion was set at 20,000, a figure that ensured the volume would cover approximately 100 groups, in accordance with the publisher’s projections for the volume. Thus Monegasques, the 5,000 or so passport holders of tiny Monaco, do not receive an entry. Whenever possible, small groups receive mention in treatments of larger, related groups, as in the case of the Ramaniotes (Greek-speaking Jews) who were incorporated into Sephardic Jewish communities, or that of the Kaitags and Kubachins who are considered subgroups of the Dargins. Additionally, some sidebars highlight populations mentioned in larger entries, such as Irish Tinkers and Ulster Protestants, xix\n\nxx |\n\nMethodology\n\nor provide concise descriptions of distinctive border areas, such as Alsace and Tyrol. The final criterion for inclusion in the volume is that a group must have a historic homeland as well as a continued presence in Europe, as conventionally defined. Thus there is no treatment of the Ubykh, a Muslim people long resident in the northwest Caucasus who fled the advancing Russian Empire forces in 1864, settled mostly in western Turkey, took up farming in preference to their former nomadic existence, and adopted as their language Turkish or Circassian. Groups whose members are found both inside and beyond the borders of Europe are not described in this volume if the majority of their numbers currently reside outside of Europe. For this reason the Meskhetian Turks, a Georgian population exiled to Central Asia by Josef Stalin in the 1940s and still concentrated in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, will be treated in the volume on ethnic peoples of Asia.\n\nA the Abkhaz in search of meadows for their herds in the northern plains of the Caucasus Mountains. Some accounts say that they are a Black Sea people with strong ties to Asia Minor as well. Yet others consider the Abazin a separate ethnic group and explain the similarity of the Abazin and Abkhaz languages as the result of historical relations. Abazin dialects are understandable for Abkhaz speakers. On the eve of the Russian Empire’s campaign in the Caucasus, the numbers of Abazin were estimated at around 45,000; about 10,000 remained in Russian territory at the end of the 19th century. The Ashywua subgroup consists of six families: Loo, Bibard, Darykua, Kylych, Jantemir, and K’achua. The Ashkarywua subgroup consists of seven families: Bashylby, Barakey, Mysylbiy, Kyzylby, Shegerey, T’am, and Bagh. In the face of Russian forces most of the Ashkarywua fled to the Ottoman Empire in the second half of the 19th century. They are now found in different parts of Turkey, Syria, and Jordan. Abazin literature is predominantly oral, identified with the epic tradition of the Caucasus nations. The first written forms of Abazin literature were published by the famous Abazin literary figure Tobil Talustan in 1920s in the Soviet Union. The Abazin national movement tried to establish a homeland within the Karachaevo-Cherkessia Republic in 1991 but failed. Following a referendum in 2005,\n\nAbazin The Abazin live in the Northern Caucasus region, particularly in the Adygheya and Karachaevo-Cherkessia republics of the Russian Federation. They call themselves Abaza, Ashywua, or Ashkarywua, the latter two names referring to their two major tribes. Historically, the Abazin have practiced herding and some farming. They live on the northern parts of the Great Caucasus range, in the valleys of the Kuma and Great and Little Zelenchuk rivers. They also live on the northeastern shores of the Black Sea basin in a tier starting from Sochi down to the borders of contemporary Abkhazia. The most recent data show their numbers in the Russian Federation near 40,000; smaller numbers also live in Turkey, Syria, and Jordan. The Abazin language belongs to the West Caucasian subgroup of the North Caucasian language family, a subgroup consisting of Abazin (i.e., Abaza), Abkhaz, Adygh, Kabardinian, and Ubykh languages. The Abazin are Sunni Muslims. They are often confused with the Abkhaz (Apsywua), a related people now resident in Abkhazia. Some Circassians use the term Abazin for Abkhaz living outside of Abkhazia, but the two populations should be distinguished on the basis of the strong self-consciousness of the Abazin people about their identity. One theory says that in the distant past the Ashywua and Ashkarywua split from 1\n\n2 |\n\nAbkhaz\n\nan Abazin national district was formed in 2006. After a transitional period and reorganization of the administrative districts in northern Karachaevo-Cherkessia, in December 2007 elections were held to elect a 15-member parliament and a president of the Abazin national district. The population of the Abazin national district is estimated at 15,000. Its capital is the village of Psyzh. Hasan Ali Karasar Further Reading Danilova, E. N.

Less than 100,000 now live in Abkhazia, and the number of native Abkhaz speakers has dwindled during the last century through Russification. While Christianity, Islam,\n\nand paganism have coexisted among the Abkhaz for centuries, seven decades of Soviet rule has created a largely nonreligious people. In the 14th and 15th centuries, some Abkhazians moved to the North Caucasus, and their descendants became known as Abazinians. There is also a large diaspora in Turkey, mostly descendants of those expelled by the Russian empire in the late 19th century. At the end of the 8th century, following a dilution of Byzantine power, an Abkhazian kingdom emerged, which encompassed the whole of western Georgia with its capital in Kutaisi. The kingdom consolidated Abkhazian tribes and thrived for two centuries before being superseded in 978 by a new state, known as the Kingdom of Abkhazians and Kartvelians. Ruled by the Bagrationi family, the capital remained in Kutaisi until 1122, when the expulsion of the Arab emirate of Tbilist facilitated a move to that city. The kingdom succumbed to Mongol invasions in the 13th century, never to reappear, and was replaced by numerous smaller principalities, including Abkhazia, now ruled by the Chachba (Sharvashidze) family. The Abkhaz were in regular battle with the neighboring principality of Mingrelia, an ethnic Georgian region ruled by the Dadiani family. Extensive interaction with the Genoese in the 14th and 15th centuries was eclipsed by the rise of Ottoman power in the region. The Turks brought Islam, which gradually replaced Christianity as the dominant religion in Abkhazia, though traditional paganism remained influential. The Ottomans were dislodged in turn by an expanding Russian empire and in 1810 Abkhazia became an unruly\n\nAbkhaz |\n\nSvetlana and Anatoly Vosba paint a newspaper kiosk that is decorated with the Abkhaz flag in Sukhumi, the capital of the Georgian breakaway region of Abkhazia.

Sporadic attacks on Russian power through the decades culminated in large-scale rebellions in the 1860s and 1870s. These were ruthlessly suppressed and led to the forced resettlement of up to 200,000 Abkhaz to Turkey, an event known in Abkhaz folklore as amha’dzhyrra (exile). Leaderless and bereft of its indigenous people, Abkhazia came under direct Russian rule and was repopulated with Mingrelians and a host of other nationalities including Armenians, Russians, and Greeks. Famed for their food, wine, and dancing, the Abkhaz are influenced by their Black Sea location, which has exposed them to traders and invaders over many centuries.\n\nTheir proximity to the mountain peoples of the north Caucasus, neighboring Kartvelians, and the eclectic mix of peoples that have inhabited the republic have also left their mark. A fundamental part of Abkhaz national culture is ‘apswara, which is roughly translated as “Abkhaz-ness” or “Abkhaz world view.” A high premium is placed on personal and familial honor, and chastity is prized and expected of Abkhaz women. The culture is conservative, patriarchal, and clannish, with family, locality, and personal contacts as key features. People bearing the same surname are considered relatives. Abkhaz is a northwest Caucasian language, which, though ancient, was bereft\n\n3\n\n4 |\n\nAbkhaz\n\nof an alphabet until 1862 when an adaptation of Cyrillic was introduced. During the 1930s, a Georgian script for Abkhaz was imposed before Cyrillic was reintroduced following Soviet leader Joseph Stalin’s death in 1953. The Cyrillic alphabet continues to be used. The collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917 facilitated the emergence of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, incorporating a recalcitrant Abkhaz population that, in 1919, was granted autonomy within the new state. A completely new dispensation followed the consolidation of Bolshevik power in Russia. The Red Army invasion obliterated Georgian independence and, in February 1921, both Georgia and Abkhazia were made Soviet Socialist Republics within the Soviet Union. Amendments later that year and in 1925 diluted Abkhazia’s status until, in 1931, it was reduced to an autonomous republic within Georgia. A “Georgianization” policy was rigorously pursued during the 1930s and 1940s, accompanied by substantial Georgian migration to the region. The worst of the repression ended with the departure of Stalin and Lavrentiy Beria (both ethnic Georgians) in 1953 and, though conditions largely improved for the Abkhaz during the remainder of Soviet rule, there were popular demands for secession from Georgia in 1957, 1964, 1967, 1978, and 1989. As Soviet power declined and Georgian nationalists sought independence, the Abkhaz tried first to remain within the Soviet Union before opting for independence. The bitter Georgian-Abkhaz war of 1992– 1993 claimed about 10,000 lives, with Russian military support for the Abkhaz proving decisive. Approximately 250,000\n\nethnic Georgians (many of them Mingrelians) were expelled from Abkhazia. A ceasefire, which gave Russia a central role in the region, remained largely intact until 2008. Demography continues to challenge the Abkhaz; their dwindling numbers put them at risk of assimilation or being overwhelmed by other nationalities. Though renowned for their longevity, the last Soviet census in 1989 indicated that the Abkhaz constituted only 17.8 percent (93,267) of Abkhazia’s 525,061 residents. The Abkhaz government census of 2003 estimated there were 215,972 living in Abkhazia of whom 94,606 (43.8%) were ethnic Abkhaz. These figures are almost certainly inaccurate, not least because of a desire to inflate Abkhaz numbers at the expense of other nationalities. Abkhazia has adopted a presidential form of government. The first incumbent (1994–2005), war-hero Vladislav Ardzinba, enjoyed early popularity, though the later years of his presidency were marked first by increasing authoritarianism and then by very poor health. The task of ruling Abkhazia fell largely to Raul Khadjimba, a former KGB agent, popular with the Kremlin. A standoff developed during the 2004 presidential election, when Khadjimba refused to accept defeat at the hands of Sergei Bagapsh. The solution brokered, which saw the pair run on a unity ticket, with Khadjimba running as Bagapsh’s vice-presidential candidate, was overwhelmingly endorsed by the Abkhaz electorate. Though seats for the 35-member Peoples Assembly are hotly contested, the legislature plays a minor role in the republic’s political life.\n\nAdyghs\n\nOn August 26, 2009, following a brief war that primarily involved Russian and Georgian forces, the Kremlin issued a decree recognizing Abkhazia as an independent state. Only Nicaragua followed suit. The absence of recognition will do little to stop extensive Russian investment and influence in Abkhazia. While this Russian presence will bring economic dividends for those living in Abkhazia, it will also increase the risk of more intensive Russification. The position of Georgians expelled from Abkhazia as a result of the 1992–1993 and 2008 wars remains unresolved.

As of 2002, there are 108,100 Adyghs residing in the Republic of Adygheya, located between the Kuban and Laba rivers, with another 49,500 in the northern Karachaevo-Cherkessia Republic, both parts of the Russian Federation. Some 15,800 Adyghs live in the neighboring Krasnodar region. They speak Adygh,\n\na Caucasian language, and most practice Islam. The exonym Cherkesy (Circassian) also includes the closely related Abkhazians, Kabards, and Ubykhs. In the preSoviet period the Adyghs and Kabards were actually considered one people. With Russian conquest of the Adygh territories starting in 1864, many of the mountain people left and became refugees in the Ottoman Empire. Surviving Adyghs settled all over the Ottoman Empire and can therefore be found today in small diaspora settlements spread over a vast area, from the Balkans in the west to Anatolia in the east. A few hundred live in the Republic of Macedonia and in Bulgaria, while most of those living in Kosovo left in 1998, when they were repatriated to the Republic of Adygheya. There are still several Çerkez (Adygh) villages in the western and central Anatolian part of Turkey with a total population of about 700,000, but settlements can also be found numbering about 15,000 in Israel, 40,000 in Lebanon and Syria, about 20,000 in and around Amman in Jordan, and fewer numbers in Egypt and even Libya. Immigrant communities from Syria exist in New Jersey and other parts of the United States. Some have also arrived as guest workers from Turkey and live nowadays in Germany and the Netherlands. According to some estimates, the world population of Adyghs is between 800,000 and 1 million. The Adyghs are recognized in the sources since the 13th century, when they were dispersed over a much larger area around the Don River and the Caucasus Mountains. At that time and in the following centuries, they were dispersed by Mongols, several Turkic peoples, and Russians,\n\n|\n\n5\n\n6 |\n\nAdyghs\n\nand had to retreat to their contemporary mountainous homeland. The Adyghs lived and still live as pastoralists and farmers in the mountains. The Russian Empire’s war of conquest against the Caucasian peoples lasted for more than a century. The mountaineers put up fierce resistance, and the difficult conditions also contributed to the slow pace of the conquest. When their leader Shamil capitulated in 1859 and the Chechen-Dagestani resistance was broken, the Russians completed the conquest of the Adygh and other Circassian territories in 1864. The Circassians who survived the war and did not accept Russian rule left their mountains and sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire. Nearly half a million are said to have been deported or fled, and many died during the journey. One closely related Circassian group was the Ubykhs, who died in large numbers when escaping Russian troops. Only a few survived and they have now all disappeared; the last speaker of the Ubykh language died in 1992. After the revolutions in 1917–1918, the Adygh territory was established as an autonomous region (oblast) in 1922. It went through several administrative changes during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1937 Adygheya was incorporated into the Krasnodar region. Adygheya changed its status to that of a republic within the Russian Federation in 1991. In 2002, the Adyghs constituted only 24 percent of the population in Adygheya; Russians made up 64 percent, Armenians 3 percent, and Ukrainians 2 percent. Adygheya is now highly industrialized, especially in food production. The Adyghs\n\nremain a rather rural people, although many live in cities. Most Adyghs are Sunni Muslims belonging to the Hanafi School of jurisprudence. Popular religion includes many preIslamic elements. The Adygh language belongs, together with Ubykh and Kabardian, to the northwestern or AbkhazoAdyghean group of Caucasian languages. It is divided into several dialects: Abadzekh, Bzchedugh, Chemgwi, and Shapsug. A written Adygh language was developed in the 1920s, based on the Chemgwi dialect. It was written with Arabic script, which was replaced by the Latin alphabet in the late 1920s. However, at the end of the 1930s, Soviet authorities ordered the Adygh language to be written in the Cyrillic alphabet. Most Adyghs use their native language as their first language, although a majority of them are bilingual, also speaking Russian. There is an increasing interest in using the language in various domains, such as newspapers and for radio broadcasts. However, since Russian is the dominant language in Adygheya, the future of the local languages is under threat. Ingvar Svanberg\n\nFurther Reading Akiner, Shirin. Islamic Peoples of the Soviet Union.

More than 300,000 Ajarians live in an autonomous province in southwestern Georgia; others reside elsewhere in Georgia and in nearby Turkey. Largely known as “Georgian Muslims,” they call themselves Ach’areli (pl. Ach’arlebi). In 1926 Ajar, a derivative of this name (Acar in Turkish) was adopted formally. The local dialect of Georgian contains both Laz and Turkish influence, and the Ajars’ written language is Georgian. In “Marxism and the National Question” (1913), Josef Stalin, himself a Georgian by background and the leading Bolshevik expert in ethnicity, observed that they were a people “who speak the Georgian language but whose culture is Turkish and who profess the religion of Islam.” During antiquity, Ajaria was part of Colchis and Caucasian Iberia. Colonized by ancient Greeks in the 5th century BCE, the region fell under Roman control three centuries later. Local tribes, believed to be of Hun origin, adopted Christianity in the 4th century, to be replaced by Islam during Ottoman rule in the 17th through 19th centuries. As a part of the region of Egrisi, in the 9th century CE it was incorporated into the unified Georgian Kingdom. The Ottomans administrated the area from 1614, when conversion to Islam occurred, until being forced to cede area by the expanding Russian Empire in 1878. Vestiges of earlier Christian practice do remain, for example, in the crosses laid\n\ntraditionally on bread and cakes, and in the recurrent decorative crosses encircled with a vine leaf, found even in mosques. Remains of churches and monasteries are maintained with their Byzantine-style icons, and Christian graves are protected and cared for. Though a significant percentage of Ajarians remain Sunni Muslims, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and reestablishment of Georgia as an independent state, voluntary reconversion to Christianity has accelerated, especially among the young. Curiously enough, in the regional capital city of Batumi, there are now 14 Christian churches and only one mosque. In accordance with the terms of the Russo-Turkish Treaty of March 16, 1921, the city of Batumi on the Black Sea, after a brief British occupation, was ceded to Georgia along with lands to its north. A few months later, on July 16, 1921, the Soviet regime established the Ajarian Autonomous Republic, with a capital in Batumi and comprising 1,120 square miles in southwestern Georgia. Ajarians were spared the fate of the other neighboring Muslim peoples of the northern Caucasus—the Meskhians (also known as “Meskhetian Turks”), Hemshins (Islamicized Armenians), and others—who were deported by Stalin to Central Asia. According to the last reliable census (1989), 324,806 Ajarians reside in the Ajarian Autonomous Republic of Georgia, where they constitute 82.8 percent of its population. Ajarian settlements are also found in nearby Georgian provinces and parts of neighboring Turkey. During the turmoil that followed Georgia’s 1991 independence, their regional leader, Aslan\n\n|\n\n7\n\n8 |\n\nAlbanians\n\nAbashidze, turned Ajaria into a personal fiefdom, an undeclared but de facto independent state for more than a decade. By 2004, when Abashidze was compelled to flee, the region had been incorporated into the Republic of Georgia as an autonomous republic. Stephan E. Nikolov Further Reading Greene, T. The Forsaken People: Internal Displacement in the North Caucasus, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia. Washington, DC: The Brookings Institute, 1996.\n\nAlbanians Albanians inhabit parts of the Balkan Peninsula and are mostly concentrated in Albania, a country in southeastern Europe, where they make up about 95 percent of approximately 3.5 million inhabitants (Greeks, Vlachs, Roma, Macedonians, Serbs, and Bulgarians make up the remaining 5%). Unlike most other European countries, Albania is predominantly rural: according to the Albanian Institute for Statistics (INSTAT), about 42 percent of the population lived in urban centers in 2001. The capital city of Tirana boasts the greatest concentration of Albanians, and the next most densely populated cities include Elbasan in central Albania, Shkodër in the north, Korcë in the east, and Durrës and Vlorë on the Adriatic coast. Additional countries in the Balkans with significant numbers of Albanians include Kosovo (about 1.8 million or 90% of the population), the Republic of Macedonia (about\n\n500,000 or 25% of the population), and Montenegro (about 55,000 or 8% of the population). Albanian diasporic communities are found elsewhere in Europe (mainly Greece, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland) and also in Turkey, Egypt, and the United States. Albanians converse in the Albanian language. A distinctive branch of the IndoEuropean language family, Albanian is written in Latin script and spoken in two main and mutually intelligible dialects: Gheg (northern) and Tosk (southern). The geographical boundary between the two dialects is roughly marked by the Shkumbin River, which cuts across Albania. Tosk was pronounced the base for the standardized literary language in 1952, but nonetheless the use of Gheg remains widespread in Kosovo and Macedonia. With reference to religious identity, the Albanian constitution ensures freedom of religious belief and expression, but demographic figures regarding religious affiliation are currently unavailable because the most recent census, which took place in 2001, did not include any such questions. At present, there is a widespread tendency among Albanians in Albania to identify as Roman Catholic whereas Albanians in Kosovo and Macedonia are predominantly Muslim. Since the end of World War II, archaeological evidence has been deployed to support the hypothesis of the origin of Albanians from the Illyrians, who once inhabited parts of present-day Albanian territory. It is generally accepted that peoples who spoke a different language from Greek or Latin, and to whom the Greeks and Romans referred as Illyrians, inhabited\n\nAlbanians\n\nEthnic Albanians near the town of Domorovce in Kosovo Province wave Albanian national flags to protest Serbian roadblocks in August 2000. (Department of Defense)\n\nthe Balkan Peninsula by the seventh century BCE. Nonetheless, the hypothesis of the descent of Albanians from Illyrians remains somewhat controversial, especially with regard to the peoples who inhabit the wider coastal region of Epirus, stretching across northwestern Greece and southern Albania. Ptolemy of Alexandria, the notable astronomer, in the second century CE makes the first historical references to a free Illyrian tribe of the “Albanoi” and their town “Albanopolis,” which is located within present-day Albania. The term “Albanoi” derives from the Latin albus, which means “white,” and, according to some theories, translates into “people dressed in white.” Alternative theories assume that the term refers to the whiteness of the nearby mountains.\n\nThe area where present-day Albania lies was colonized by Greece in the 7th century BCE, was subjugated by the Roman Empire in the 2nd century BCE, and became part of the Byzantine Empire in the 4th century CE. Its rich history includes invasions and conquests by Huns, Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Slavs, Normans, and Venetians. Between 1334 and 1347, the area became part of the Great Serbian Empire under Stefan Dušan. Toward the end of the 14th century, the Venetians established themselves in what are now northern Albania and the Montenegrin coast (Albania Veneta in Italian, or “Venetian Albania”). In 1478, according to the provisions of a peace agreement that ended a multiyear war between the Venetians and the Ottoman Turks, and after more than two decades of successful armed resistance by Albania’s notable military leader and national hero Gjergj Kastioti (otherwise known as Skanderbeg; 1405–1468), the territory of present-day Albania became a Turkish province. Under Ottoman rule, Albanians were classified as Muslim and received education in the Turkish, not Albanian, language for an interesting reason: education in the Ottoman Empire had a religious character and schooling was provided in Turkish (for Muslims), Greek (for Orthodox Christians), and Italian (for Catholics). The years of Ottoman rule, especially the weakening of Ottoman power in the late 19th/early 20th centuries, were critical to the awakening of Albanian national consciousness and the development of modern Albanian identity. When the Roman Empire was divided in 395, Albania came under Constantinople’s administrative rule and Rome’s\n\n|\n\n9\n\n10 |\n\nAlbanians\n\necclesiastical jurisdiction. After the Great Schism of 1054, whereby the Eastern Orthodox Church was divided from the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, north Albania became Roman Catholic, the south Greek Orthodox. It is not certain whether the Catholic cause was furthered under Venetian rule, but it is certain that the Greek Orthodox religion was practiced by Albanians until the Ottoman conquest. Following the Ottoman invasion at the end of the 15th century, Islam gradually spread in Albania. From the mid-16th century onward, the Bektashi, a Shiite dervish order preaching tolerance toward all non-Muslim creeds, gained influence and popularity in Albania. Bektashi places of worship (tekkes) spread in the country, and the shrine of legendary warrior-saint Sari Saltik in Krujë became a center of worship. At the beginning of the 19th century additional tekkes were established in the towns of Gjirokaster, Tepelena, and Janina. Under Ottoman rule, Roman Catholicism in Albania suffered a severe blow. The Ottoman administration, however, recognized the patriarch of Constantinople as the spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians, and the Albanian Orthodox Church, founded by Bishop Fan Noli in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1908, was recognized as autocephalous by the patriarchate of Constantinople in 1937. Up to the end of World War II, 70 percent of Albanians in Albania were registered as Muslim (largely belonging to the Sunni branch of Islam and some to the Shiite order of Bektashi), 20 percent Eastern Orthodox (mostly in the south), and 10 percent Roman Catholic (mostly in the north). Starting in 1944, many religious leaders were imprisoned or\n\nexecuted and all religious groups were subject to persecution. During communist rule (1944–1989), the practice of religion was declared illegal (in 1967) and Albania was proclaimed an atheist state—the first in the world. Albanian folk culture was also suppressed under communist rule. Folk mythology and beliefs that have survived to this day are replete with references to taboos, vampires, witchcraft, dragons, and monsters such as the kulshedra. The Ghegs, who live in the northern mountainous regions, were traditionally herders and were organized around the exogamous, patrilineal clan (fis) whereby people claim descent from a common, sometimes fictitious, male ancestor. Until the 1950s, when the communist regime tried to eliminate clan rule, it was common for extended families, consisting of the nuclear families of many brothers, to live together in an extended household (shtëpi, which means “house”). Land was owned communally by the clan. Additionally, before Albania came under communist rule, everyday life among the Ghegs was regulated by the kanun, a code of customary laws that has been passed on orally from generation to generation in the form of proverbs and common sayings. There are numerous versions of the kanun that are named either after areas or after reputable agnatic clan rulers and ancestors, who allegedly created the kanun. The kanun of Lekë Dukagjin, an affluent Albanian clan chieftain (bajraktar) and contemporary of Skanderbeg, is the best-known and most widely practiced customary law; its adherents include Albanians in the North Albanian Alps, Shkodër, Dukagjin, western Kosovo, and Albanian populations in parts\n\nAlbanians\n\nof Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia. Consisting of 1,262 articles that are presented in 12 books, the kanun covers all aspects of everyday life such as work, marriage, gender roles, personal honor, family and economic organization, and land and livestock, and continues to regulate social status, especially with reference to blood feuds and conflict reconciliation. While the autonomous Gheg herders in the rugged mountains of northern Albania have traditionally regulated daily life using the laws of the kanun and shown strongwilled resistance to both Ottoman and Communist rule, the Tosks have led a different lifestyle because of the geographical specificities of the regions they inhabit. Living in the easily accessible southern lowland plains, the Tosks came under firm Ottoman control and were better integrated into the larger system of Ottoman governance. Traditionally, they were tenant farmers organized in a semifeudal system whereby the Muslim landowning nobility (beys), and not clan chiefs as was the case in the northern mountains, had political and economic control over the latifundia (çiftliks). Similarly to the clan chiefs, the beys in effect became autonomous rulers. This system of land tenure lasted well into the 20th century, albeit with some modifications. After 1946, however, the communist government expropriated farmland and distributed it among the farmers who were dependent on the landowners. Later, all land was nationalized, private ownership was abolished, and people were organized in cooperatives. A process of land privatization has begun since the collapse of socialism, accompanied with various challenges including the\n\n|\n\nestablishment of institutions for land and property management. Albania remains one of the poorest countries in Europe: according to the 2005 Living Standard Measurement Survey conducted by the INSTAT, 18 percent of Albanians live on less than U.S. $2 a day. In general, rural areas and the mountainous areas in the north continue to be poorer and less developed than urban areas and the lowlands in the south. Albanian epic songs and ballads, mostly preserved in northern Albania and Kosovo, are part of a rich Albanian oral tradition. The songs are commonly woven around such themes as warfare, sacrifice, and honor (besa). Albania also has an old tradition of embroidery, silver and gold filigree making, pottery making, and wood carving. Notable Albanian figures include nun and philanthropist Mother Teresa, painter Ibrahim Kodra, and writer Ismail Kadare. Also well known is the Franciscan missionary Shtjefën Gjeçov, who assembled the Albanian proverbs and sayings making up the kanun and codified them in paragraphs and articles in the 1920. With the weakening of the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century, Albanian intellectuals feared that Albanian-populated territories would be partitioned between Greece and Serbia. Therefore, they formed the League of Prizren in 1878 as a way of promoting the use of a unified Albanian language, hence strengthening Albanian national consciousness and preparing the ground for an independent Albanian state. Even though the Turks crushed the efforts of the League of Prizren three years later, attempts to achieve Albanian cultural recognition within the Ottoman Empire\n\n11\n\n12 |\n\nAlbanians\n\ncontinued. In 1908, when the Young Turks rose to power in Istanbul, Albanians were temporarily granted linguistic rights, and additional democratic reforms for Albania were discussed. The new Turkish government failed to carry out these reforms, however, and Albanians engaged in a new armed struggle between 1910 and 1912. Albania remained part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912 when the First Balkan War broke out. On November 28 of that year, Ismail Kemal, who is widely recognized as the father of Albanian independence, organized a national assembly at the city of Vlorë and became the president of a provisional government. The Great Powers recognized Albanian independence after the London Conference of July 1913. During World War I Albania was occupied by the Allies, and in 1924 became a monarchy under the tutelage of Italy. As a socialist republic led by Enver Hoxha, Albania was kept isolated from the rest of the world from 1946 until Hoxha’s death in 1985. Since the collapse of the communist regime in 1989, Albania has gradually developed into a democracy. The Democratic Party of Albania (PDS) won a decisive victory in the 1992 parliamentary elections, and its leader, Sali Berisha, became Albania’s first noncommunist president. In early 1997, however, the PDS bore the brunt of a severe financial crisis after several popular financial pyramid schemes collapsed. Many Albanians who had invested their life savings in the schemes took to the streets in protest and toppled the government. The country descended into anarchy after hundreds of thousands of weapons were looted from government armories and some 2,000 people were killed in uncontained rioting.\n\nPresident Berisha declared a state of emergency, and in March 1997 the United Nations Security Council endorsed a proposal by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to deploy a multinational protection force in Albania in order to help restore order and provide humanitarian aid. The presence of the multinational force provided the security needed for the organization of parliamentary elections that were held in June of that year and resulted in a clear victory of the Socialist Party of Albania (PSS), the reformed Communist Party. Thereafter the rule of law was gradually reestablished. Albania is a member of a number of international organizations, including the United Nations, the OSCE, and the World Trade Organization. The country became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 2008, and applied to join the European Union in April 2009. Before and after World War II, Greece asserted ownership of the southern part of Albania, arguing that its inhabitants are ethnically Greek. In 1987 Greece renounced any territorial claims against Albania, and a year later the two countries signed a cross-border trade agreement. Nonetheless, tense relations between Greece and Albania continued and gave rise to mutual recriminations through the mid-1990s. Also, before Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, attempts by the Serbian (and earlier, Yugoslav) authorities to keep the Albanian population in Kosovo under firm control significantly strained regional relations with Albania. The district of Mitrovica in northern Kosovo remains the apple of discord between Serbs and Albanians. Relations between\n\nAndorrans\n\nAlbania and neighboring Macedonia have also often been strained, mainly by Albania’s support of the requests for greater cultural and political rights made by the Albanian community in Macedonia (which amounts to about 25% of the Macedonian population). During the communist era and until 1991, when a strict pronatalist law in effect prohibited contraception and restricted abortion, the size of the population nearly tripled, rising from about 1.2 million in 1945 to about 2.9 million in 1985. Albania’s annual rate of population increase between World War II and the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 averaged about 2.5—the highest in Europe. The results of the most recent census in 2001 show that the population has declined since 1989, probably diminished by mass migration to Western Europe during the 1990s. Albania has the youngest population in Europe: in the mid-1990s the average age was 26 and more than a third of the total population was under 15 years of age. The U.S. Census Bureau figures in 2008 placed life expectancy at 78 years. Vasiliki Neofotistos Further Reading Durham, Edith. High Albania. Boston: Beacon Press, 1905. Jacques, Edwin E.

Within this small, mountainous homestead, Andorrans have negotiated cultural autonomy, economic autarky, and political distinction between France and Spanish Catalonia for more than a millennium. At the same time, they share pervasive Roman Catholicism; Catalan, the enclave’s official language; and many other cultural traits of food, family, and everyday life with these close neighbors. Yet, among contemporary residents, the actual citizens of Andorra constitute only 35.7 percent of the 76,874 residents, fewer than the resident Spanish population (37.4%). Beyond its history of cross-border exchanges, banking, shopping, and tourism have made contemporary Andorra a European crossroads in which cosmopolitan development challenges centuries of isolation. Andorra emerged as a separate polity within the Marca Hispanica, or Spanish March, that Charlemagne established in 795 along the Pyrenees as a border with\n\n13\n\n14 |\n\nAndorrans\n\nTwo Andorran women wearing contrasting clothing styles lean on stone wall. (B. Anthony Stewart/National Geographic Society/Corbis)\n\nIberian Muslims; the national anthem still refers to “Charlemagne, my father.” (The name Andorra may also reflect earlier Basque roots.) In 819, sovereignty was granted to the Count of Urgell in Catalonia, from whom it passed to the Bishop of Seu d’Urgell. Since the 13th century, this cleric has been titular coprince of Andorra with the Count of Foix, whose rights eventually accrued to the president of the French state. A new constitution establishing clear local control was promulgated in 1993. Andorra’s traditional economy depended for centuries on agriculture, herding, mining and ironwork, and textiles, supplemented by smuggling of goods and peoples across borders; by 1950, its population only\n\nnumbered 10,000, with the power of patriarchal stem families remaining strong. Traditional architecture remains visible in the slate-roof homes and churches of the countryside, some of which go back to Romanesque times. Festes majors (primary feasts), with traditional banquets and dances such as the marratxa, contrapàs, and sardana mark the lives of these settlements as well as the nation, in a calendar that shares major Catalan feasts like Sant Jordi (April 23) and Santa Llucia, before Christmas. In the last 50 years, increased connections by roads and communications technologies have led to intense growth and modernization. Andorra’s “offshore banking” has enriched the state, while 11 million tourists now seek its mountain resorts and shopping opportunities each year. Labor immigration and retirement have also diversified cities like Andorra la Vella and Escaldes-Engordany, which include Portuguese and Hindu communities. Nonetheless, while Andorrans now rank among the healthiest and longest-living people in the world, modernization and immigration have also stimulated new demands for what Joan Becat calls an “Andorrization of Andorra.” Gary Wray McDonogh Further Reading Becat, Joan. “Les portugais seront-ils les meilleurs Andorrans?” (Are the Portuguese the Best Andorrans?)

New York: Routledge, 2008.\n\nArbëreshë The Arbëreshë or Arbareschi (also known as the Albanians of Italy) live in southern Italy. They descend from Albanian migrants, follow the Greek Orthodox faith, and speak Arbërisht, a dialect that has developed in the course of over 500 years of residence in Italy. Arbëreshë was the term self-designation of Albanians before the Ottoman invasion of the 15th century; similar terms are used for Albanian origins populations living in Greece (“Arvanitika,” the Greek rendering of Arbëreshë) and Turkey (“Arnaut,” Turkish for the Greek term Arvanitika). The Arbëreshë process of settlement in Italy started in the 15th century and it continued through different migratory waves until the 18th century. Today, Arbëresh villages and communities can be found in several southern Italian regions (Abruzzo, Basilicata, Campania, Molise, Puglia, and Sicily), especially in Calabria. The estimated number of members of the Arbëresh community in Italy is about 100,000. The earliest known Albanian/Arbëresh presence in Calabria dates back to the 14th century, when, in order to repress a rebellion of the nobility, King Alfonso V of Aragon employed Albanian troops, who were then rewarded with land in the area around Catanzaro. Over the years, other Albanian troops were deployed in Sicily and Apulia\n\n|\n\nand similarly rewarded. Finally, the invasion of Greece by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century caused a massive flow of the Albanian communities residing there toward Sicily, especially Piana. In the 20th century, following a common pattern in southern Italy, some Arbëreshë left their villages and emigrated either to northern Italy or abroad (especially the United States). Today the Arbëreshë show a high level of insertion in Italian society, despite the fact that they often live in enclaves or areas that are ethnically homogenous. Traditional customs survive, especially during marriages and religious celebrations such as the epiphany, but their vitality varies between settlements. While several groups have promoted independent radio broadcasts and newspapers, and several university centers are devoted to the study and defense of the culture, recent research shows that linguistic competency in Arbërisht is shrinking among the youngest members of the community and that a growing number of insiders reject traditional culture. However, the Greek Orthodox religion is still observed by Arbëreshë. Arbëreshë have long contributed to Albanian culture, and many Arbëreshë intellectuals, who maintained throughout the centuries a profound attachment to their native country, played an important role in the emergence of Albanian nationalism. Although Arbëreshe literature developed of its own accord, it may be considered an integral part of Albanian culture. Wellknown intellectuals include Jeronim De Rada, Nicolò Brancato, Nicola Figlia di Munxifsi, Jul Variboba, and Nicola Chetta.\n\n15\n\n16 |\n\nAromanians\n\nUnder Italian law, Arbëreshë are a protected linguistic minority (under Law 482 of 1999). Their territories are considered bilingual by the state, and the Italian regions hosting Arbëreshë settlements and other minority groups, in agreement with the interested groups, must implement initiatives aimed at supporting the survival of the culture and the language.

John Benjamins, 2006.\n\nAromanians Aromanians (Romanian: Aromâni; Greek: Aρμávo ) inhabit the southern Balkans and are found in Greece, Albania, the Republic of Macedonia, Romania, and Bulgaria. They call themselves Aromanian (i.e., Romans, Armãnj, Rrãmenji, Rrãmãnji). Since they were usually concentrated in small isolated areas, in the past neighboring majority populations often called\n\nthem by place names: for example, frasheroti in Albania; muzakiri in the region of Muzakiya; Moglen, or Meglen Vlachs in Macedonia; and Gramusteni and Pindeni in Greece. Balkan neighbors also referred to them as “Vlachs,” a pejorative term for any outsider, especially a shepherd. (In a neutral and widespread sense, Vlach refers to southeastern European populations descending from Latinized pastoralists, the largest modern groups of which are Romanians and Aromanians.) Enumerating the Aromanian population is difficult because national censuses do not record them as a separate ethnic group and because the processes of assimilation into other groups and misidentification are ongoing. According to calculations of Aromanian NGOs, out of a total of 100,000–200,000, up to 100,000 Aromanians reside in Greece, 40,000–45,000 in Serbia, 26,000–30,000 in Romania, and around 10,000 each in Bulgaria and Macedonia—roughly onetenth the number at the beginning of the 20th century. Virtually all Aromanians are Eastern Orthodox Christians. They speak a Romance language related to the Romanian spoken in Romania. Aromanians use the Latin alphabet in Romania; the Cyrillic in Serbia, Bulgaria, and Macedonia; and Greek letters in Greece. Among the most polyglot of Balkan peoples, Aromanians are typically fluent in the official languages of the countries in which they reside as well as in Aromanian. In the absence of written records and other forms of evidence, the origins of the Aromanian language remain unknown. From CE 165–275 the Aromanian homeland was incorporated into the Roman Empire as Dacia Traiana. During this pe-\n\nAromanians\n\nriod roads and trade routes penetrated the inland hills more than ever, bringing herders from the hills into contact with Roman culture. It is not a coincidence that surviving Vlach communities are present in areas near the ancient Via Egnatia, the infamous Roman military and trade route connecting the Adriatic with the Aegean. A number of scholars suggest that Vlachs in fact descend from Roman colonists. However, these colonizers rarely came from Rome itself and did not speak Latin as a first language. Further, it is hard to believe that urbanized colonists would in such numbers turn to a nomadic way of life; it is much more likely that native peoples adopted a simplified form of Latin and other aspects of Roman culture. Other investigators posit a link with the non-Hellenic Balkan tribes such as Thracians and Illyrians, especially the Macedons, implying that in the 6th century CE Aromanians went down to the Pindus while Slavs massively settled into Illyria. It is believed that by about the 10th century the Aromanian language had differentiated itself from the northern Vlach language that would become modern Romanian. Romanian and especially Greek historians’ claims that their peoples are the lineal descendants of the Vlachs correspond with geopolitical claims. For instance, if Vlachs are in fact the hitherto unrecognized offspring of ancient Greeks, then Greece can justify further demands on historically disputed Balkan lands. From the 6th century CE on, written references to the Vlachs can be deduced from Latin place names. Bulgarian scriptures from the 10th century make reference to Vlachs and to areas designated as Great and Little Wallachia, which roughly\n\n|\n\ncorrespond to the location of present Vlach populations. About that time close connection among numerous Aromanian groups was probably broken, and they were exposed to various outside influences. By the mid-14th century Serbs occupied most of the Aromanian parishes. This was soon followed by five centuries of Ottoman rule, from when accounts of Vlachs are few and meager. Modernization, the introduction of multiple state borders, and animosity between Balkan states during most of the 20th century, together with the denial of a distinctive Aromanian culture and vigorous assimilation practices by dominant populations, shattered Aromanian specificity. According to fading Aromanian tradition, each step in human existence is the work of providence. Though they strictly observe Orthodox holidays, and practically submit their own seasonal activities to the prescribed calendar, they seldom attend church and do not require clergy to mark weddings, baptisms, funerals, or important life events. Their principal dedication is the pagan devotion to the fecundity of nature. Belief in life after death was deeply rooted, and elaborate funeral rites were observed; though prohibited by law, custom called for the reburial of the deceased 40 days after death, a possible vestige of Orphic culture. (Orphic funerary customs are thought to involve the actual or imitated dismemberment of the corpse believed to represent the Greek god Dionysus, who was then reborn. Orphic eschatology laid great emphasis on reward and punishment after death, when the soul was believed to be free to achieve its true life.) Communication with ancestors was practiced in\n\n17\n\n18 |\n\nAromanians\n\nmany circumstances and in various ways. Aromanians have created an abundant narrative popular culture, including ballads, epic and lyric songs, fairy tales, proverbs, and brainteasers, though such forms lack the imaginary creatures and occurrences common in so many traditions. Aromanians commonly heal with herbs and other mixtures. Traditional body tattoos distinguish some Vlach groups. Unique among all European peoples for the extent to which their culture amalgamates both Roman and Hellenic heritages, their customs have come under special protection of UNESCO and the Council of Europe. Traditionally, Aromanians were herders living in isolated areas. Their home bases were ample villages, with homes built of stone, located high in the mountains. Theirs was a mobile life. Within the Ottoman Empire, Aromanian muleteers and merchants enjoyed a virtual monopoly on redistributive and mercantile functions along the inland routes of the Balkans; some ventured as far north as Vienna, Odessa, Leipzig, and Warsaw. Until the beginning of 20th century, Aromanian shepherds would spend time from the Orthodox feasts of St. George’s Day (April 23, old style) to St. Cross Day (September 14) moving through main mountainous pastures before heading south for wintering close to the Aegean Sea. These seasonal migrations were made by communities of 50–100 people, comprising rich and poor families as well as servants. They kept horses and large flocks of sheep and fashioned cheeses such as the yellow cheese, kashkaval. Before the coming of the railway they furnished central markets with such primary products as meat, wool, and dairy products.\n\nAromanians have long been the targets of discrimination. Some authors, aiming apparently to minimize any contribution of the Aromanian to local culture, point to the absence of written laws and literature. In addition to their notable economic contribution, Aromanians seem to have respected, not ignored, Classical and Byzantine civilization, just as they did that of neighboring peoples. They played a not-insignificant role in the historical process in southeastern Europe. Culturally, the Aromanians remain the most Hellenophile among the Slav, Latin, Albanian, Turkic, Roma, and other minorities still living on Greek territory. Those Aromanians who had the opportunity to educate themselves distinguished themselves during the Ottoman epoch; in fact, Aromanians owned some of the first printing presses. Animosity from dominant populations was a constant preoccupation for Aromanians, however. For example, Turks and Arnaut (Albanian) hordes sacked the predominantly Aromanian center of Moskopolje in 1769 and again in the next century. Since the early 20th century, Romania has established schools catering to Aromanians inside Romanian as well as in neighboring countries. Aromanians were crucial in the establishment of the Philike Hetairea rebellion and in the eviction of Turks from Greece, as well as later in the Ilinden uprising in Macedonia. In 1923, the few who converted to Islam during Ottoman rule joined the retreating Turks and were further assimilated into Turkish society. Owing to anti-Vlach prejudice, many educated Aromainans have melded with the\n\nAshkenazic Jews\n\nsurrounding majority populations. With their remarkable ability for hard work and adaptation, Aromanians have made important contributions to the public life of the countries in which they reside. According to local Aromanian association sources, many prominent figures in the history of Balkan peoples have Aromanian backgrounds, although official histories do not accept this because it conflicts with national myths. Aromanians have never received any political representation, let alone statehood, with a rare exception in 1941 when Fascist Italy, invading Greece, tried to create the puppet Aromanian Pindic Principality. During the communist period their unique identity was officially denied. Even after recent democratic reforms, local nationalistic parties in Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Albania, and Greece, fearing a “menace to the national unity” and groups “serving alien interests,” have resisted the extension of any cultural rights or forms of self-government for Aromanians. Notwithstanding the efforts of Aromanian associations to sustain their language and traditions, permanent settlement in towns has eroded the pastoral life and with it their culture. Stephan E.

Ashkenaz appears as the name of a person, the son of Gomer, grandson of Japheth, and greatgrandson of Noah, in Genesis (10:3) and 1 Chronicles (1:6). Jeremiah (51:27–28) refers to Ashkenaz as a kingdom. These sources associate Ashkenaz with a region of ancient Assyria or Armenia, but by the 12th century, rabbinic writings, including those of Rabbi Shelomoh ben Yitshak Troyes (known as Rashi, 1040–1105 CE), used the term to refer specifically to “Germany” or “Germans.” Ashkenaz most usually refers to a geographic location but has also been used to refer to a culture and a people. The term now commonly refers to the area along the banks of the Rhine (especially near the towns of Mainz, Worms, and Speyer) where a distinct Jewish culture developed that was carried throughout the world, especially to Eastern Europe, by Jews who trace their roots to this region. Historians have yet to adequately explain how the term came to be preferred over other regional names such as Rhineland or Lotharingia/ Lorraine. While some scholars limit the term to describe the area of northwestern Europe and the German cultural areas of Central Europe where Jews resided, Ashkenaz is in wide use as a reference to the lands and culture of East European Jewry,\n\n19\n\n20 |\n\nAshkenazic Jews\n\nwhether that culture was developed in Europe or in lands to which European Jews migrated, especially the United States and Israel. The term denotes an origin group within the larger Jewish community and is used in contrast to Sepharad, a common Hebrew term for the Iberian Peninsula used to designate Jews (known as Sephardic Jews or Sephardim, with origins in Spain and Portugal before the expulsion of 1492). Jews from different origin groups display noticeable variations, especially in liturgical rites and the pronunciation of Hebrew. The diverse customs of Ashkenaz (minhag Ashkenaz) reflect the decentralized communal organization in France and Germany yet unite Ashkenazic Jews conceptually. While the total number of Ashkenazic Jews living in the small communities of Western Europe in the early Middle Ages has been difficult for historians to determine, it is known that approximately 200,000 Jews lived in France and the Holy Roman Empire in 1300 CE. Hebrew and Aramaic were the languages of the religious texts of the Jews of Ashkenaz, while Jewish dialects spoken during the period of early Ashkenaz in northwestern Europe developed into Yiddish, the distinct Jewish language spoken by approximately 11 million Ashkenazic Jews before World War II. Over time, however, Ashkenazic Jews throughout Europe also adopted the many non-Jewish vernaculars spoken by their Christian neighbors, sometimes to the detriment of their knowledge of Yiddish and Hebrew. Ashkenaz is often used in a broad sense to refer to the geographic areas where Yiddish-speaking Jews dominated Jewish popular culture in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nA group of Ashkenazim in Jerusalem, about 1876. (Library of Congress)\n\nMany historians describe early Ashkenaz as a Jewish society that adhered strictly to Jewish law as interpreted in rabbinic writings. The Talmudic commentator Rashi is a central figure of Ashkenaz; his writings remain standard texts of study for all students of Jewish religious learning.
