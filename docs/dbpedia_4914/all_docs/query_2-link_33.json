        "text": "In the wonderful Montjuïc mountains there are many hidden treasures. Many beautiful places to discover and where to get away from the noise of the city of Barcelona.\n\nThe Joan Maragall gardens are a small piece of paradise. Located right behind the National Museum of Art in Catalunya, this hidden spot of the unknown part of Barcelona is worth it. A haven of peace with bucolic places. Lovely views of Barcelona. I don't really like describing a spot entirely, I prefer if people find out themselves, and in this one there are beautiful surprises. Warning to visitors, there are opening hours.\n\nJust in front of the Laribal Gardens there are the Joan Moragall gardens. In the central area there is circular pond with a statue in the middle. Around the fountain there are some stone benches, perfect to admire the different green tones of the landscape.\n\nAround there are some arches of salmon pink color, giving more of an intimate atmosphere to the building. When I was a child I used to come with school on the day we dressed up, and we would play there until we were exhausted, but very happy. To me, it used to be a place you had to dress up like a lady to visit. With time this image"
