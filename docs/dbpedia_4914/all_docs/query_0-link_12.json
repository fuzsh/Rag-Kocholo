Threeappendices, an index ofplaytitles mentioned, another index ofnames andplaces, anda tableof contents conclude thebook.The introduction proceeds chronologically bylease period through thenearcentury-long operation oftheplayhouse, chronicling the expansion anddecline ofthe structure andits boxes anddependencies andreflecting theevents great andsmall, national andlocal,that impinged uponthelife andthe business ofthetheatre: theexpulsion ofthemoriscos, outbreaks ofdisease, the deathsofkings and princes, theimposition ofspecialtaxesforwar,and the recruitment ofsoldiers. The operation oftheplayhouse wasmodelled largely on thearrangements in placein Granada, withoccasional reference to practices developed elsewhere inthe Peninsula. Chronological appendices provided byGarcia Gomez onelisting the terms of lessees, another theacting companies andtheir performances inCordoba, anda third giving information onthe number ofperformances, from the account books of the orphanage that received a share ofthe receipts contribute significantly toour evolving picture ofthe business sideofthe comedia, such things asthe financial affiairs ofboth actors andlessees andtheroutes oftheacting companies that criss-crossed Spainatthetime. Moralandreligious opposition tothetheatre wasa recurring problem during the life ofthe corrales; Fray Pedro deTapia,Bishop ofCordoba from I649toI652,oncesaidthat LopedeVegahaddonemore harm inSpainwith his plays than Luther hadwith hisheresies inGermany (p.62),andintheautumn of I694,Fray Francisco dePosadas, inwhat seems tohavebeena surprise visit toa city council meeting, presented thecommisioners with a petition toclosethetheatre, alleging the immorality ofthe works presented andother standard arguments ofthe time, andadding that inCordoba theconstant attendance ofsomany city officials had leftthe streets without sufficient authoritative presence to assurecivic tranquility. Although voiceswereraisedin opposition, Posadaswas ultimately successful inhisdrive tosuspend operations, andtheplayhouse never reopened. GarciaGomez's second volume constitutes animportant substantive contribution tothegrowing body ofknowledge about theatrical life inGolden-Age Spain. UNIVERSITY OFKENTUCKY JOHN J.ALLEN Lapoesia deJoan Maragall. BYARTHUR TERRY.2ndedn. Barcelona: Quaderns Crema.I999. 267pp. 2,sooptas. On itsappearance in I963,Arthur Terry's study ofthepoetry ofJoanMaragall madeitsmark inseveral ways.Itwasseenas thevery first study ofitskindin Catalanletters, neither historical norencyclopaedic butinterpretative andgentle, yetdisplaying thehighest possible critical rigour andattention todetail. Furthermore , inthe repressive world ofFranco's Spain, the Catalans were greatly impressed byTerry's critical method, which usedelements both traditional andmodern, and regarded hischoice ofMaragall's poetry andthe fact that hewrote hisbookintheir suppressed language as confirmation ofthemuchsought 'normality' they had historically claimed for Catalan. Thecurrent edition doesnotaddanything totheoriginal other than a two-page 'Notaa la segonaedicio'whereTerry explains thathisoriginal approach to MLR,96.3,200 I 859 criticism, allowing the poemtospeak for itself andalsototell the critic when tostop, hasproven tobethe right onefor him throughout hiscareer. Thisapproach, which hesupplements with a great ability toplacethework ofanypoet, Maragall inthis case,in a truly European context, offiers a vision unlike anything produced in Catalonia eventoday. The bookcomprises ninechapters ofvarying length and approaches, someinformative, aiming tosetMaragall within a given socialand historical context, others devoted to specific works and,therefore, muchmore interpretative. Eveninthese, however, theanalysis ofstructure, literary influences ordominant themes isdoneina highly sympathetic fashion. Chapter I iS anintroduction tothe manandtohisearly collections: the formative years. Itlooks atMaragall's early themes: Beauty, LoveandthePassing ofTime. Chapter 2deals with Modernisme: Maragall's literary friends, Romanticism andother foreign influences, hisplacewithin themovement, hisfirst literary criticism andthe impact ofIbsenandMaeterlinck uponhiswork. Chapter 3 studies thetheme of Natureand analyses Maragall's techniques in thecontext ofRomanticism and subjective interpretation. This analysis is followed by a closecommentary of 'Pirenenques', 'Goigsa la verge deNuria', 'La vacacega','Vistes al mar'and'La cascadadeLutour'. Chapter 4 focuses onHeroism. Itstudies thegeneral meaning andtheoriginality oftheVisions andthecomplexity ofMaragall's treatment ofthis theme.Here Terrylooksat Nietzsche's influence uponMaragall'sviewson Patriotism andMorality. There follows a closereading ofpoems such as'Paternal', 'En la mort d'unjove','E1malcaSador JoanGari'and'La fide'nSerrallonga'. Chapter 5 isanappraisal oftheElogis. Initthepoints ofthediscussion arePoetry, Ethics, Universal Truths andthemethodology usedbyMaragall. Thisisfollowed bytheinterpretation ofthe'Elogidela paraula'and'Elogidela poesia'.Atthis stage Terry alsoevaluates thedifferences seenbyMaragall between theWord and Poetry andlooks atthepossible justification for hisviews. Chapter 6 isbuilt upon theanalysis of'ElComte Arnau'. HereTerry describes thecharacters inthe poem, identifies Niestzche andNovalis' influence, comments onthecollaboration that at thetime ofwriting Maragall hadwith Felip Pedrell, whowasgoing tostage it,and offiers a detailed analysis ofthethreeconstituent partsof'E1 ComteArnau'. Chapter 7 is devoted topoemsofa socialnature. Thisshort chapter takesus through a reading of'Els tres cantsde guerra', 'HimneIberic', thesocialissues present in 'La sirena..."
