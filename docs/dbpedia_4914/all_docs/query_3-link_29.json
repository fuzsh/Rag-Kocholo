The city provided all the elements necessary to develop a powerful, syncretic and personal style that made him one of the most important Spanish painters of the sixteenth century.\n\nReptielen in de heide : verslag veldwerkplaats Droog zandlandschap Hoge Veluwe, 23 juni 2009\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nStumpel, T.; Vogels, J.; Delft, J.; Leidekker, J.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nReptielen staan in Nederland onder druk.

Tributes to this national heroine can be found all over France. There are literally countless statues, streets and restaurants named after her and many sites dedicated to her life. However, despite widespread social and mechanical reproduction and cultural naming in relation to the Maid of OrlÃ©ans, there is no official network or integrated signage in France to promote cultural heritage tourism to the numerous Joan of Arc sites and festivals, even though her life and death, by any measure, were seminal events in the countryâs history. Unfortunately, the pilgrim who wants to follow or intersect with Joan of Arcâs trail through France, for cultural, historical or religious reasons, must do so without much help. Using Actor Network Theory and Site Sacralization Theory as framing devices, this paper explores human actors and tangible and intangible non-human factors that may have contributed to the lack of a unified tourism product despite the existence of an adequate Joan of Arc tourismscape. Insights gleaned from this research include Joanâs conflicted status as both/either saint and/or patriot, the existence of no cooperation or linkage between Joan of Arc sites, and cautious French tourism development policies. Several possible scenarios are suggested as suitable means to help implement or foster the creation of an on-the-ground or virtual Joan of Arc trail or tour.\n\nVastab Joan Baixas / Joan Baixas ; intervjueerinud, tÃµlkinud ja litereerinud Vahur Keller\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nBaixas, Joan, 1946-\n\n2010-01-01\n\nMaalikunstnik, nÃ¤itekirjanik, lavastaja, ÃµppejÃµud Barcelona Teatriinstituudis ja Barcelona Rahvusvahelise nukuteatrifestivali kunstiline juht J.

It was discovered in 1954 and mined in two phases for a total of twelve years between 1958 and 1982. In October 1982 operations at the site ceased with the deposit virtually exhausted and all contractual commitments completed. From the outset, a site specific approach was adopted in developing the rehabilitation plan. Other sites'experience was evaluated but was adopted only if appropriate for Mary Kathleen. As a result of this approach a conceptual solution was established for each area within the site. Each solution was then used as the basis for detailed planning for rehabilitation of that area. The rehabilitation program commenced in mid 1982 and was completed in late 1985. Results of monitoring provided a strong basis for confidence that the objectives of the plan have been met, and allowed for the relinquishment of all the remaining mining leases in August 1987\n\nThe 'relics of Joan of Arc'\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nCharlier, P.; Poupon, J.; Eb, A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nArchaeological remains can provide concrete cases, making it possible to develop, refine or validate medico-legal techniques.

(Joan Robinson and economic theory\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA. ASIMAKOPULOS\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available L'interesse di Joan Robinson nel problema della distribuzione del reddito e il suo disprezzo per quello che considera le teorie che hanno cercato di giustificare le distribuzioni esistenti di reddito mai segnalati . Il suo lavoro Ã¨ caratterizzato da una forte inclinazione per chiari Â argomenti ben ragionati che non lasciavano spazio per Â sciatte abitudini Â di pensiero . La portata ampia e la quantitÃ di scritti di Robinson rendono difficile presentare una valutazione critica dei suoi contributi nel contesto anche di un documento lungo . Quella attuale si concentra sui suoi scritti in cinque aree principali : (i l'economia della concorrenza imperfetta ; ( ii la teoria del rapporto di lavoro ; ( iii la teoria di accumulazione nel lungo periodo ; ( iv il concetto di capitale e la funzione di produzione ; e ( v il problema del tempo in economia che si riflette nei suoi scritti sulla storia tema contro equilibrio .Joan Robinsonâs interest in the question of the distribution of income and her disdain for what she considered to be theories that tried to justify existing distributions of income never flagged. Her work is marked by a strong inclination for clear, well reasoned arguments that left no room for sloppy habits of thought. The wide scope and quantity of Robinsonâs writings make it difficult to present a critical evaluation of her contributions within the context of even a lengthy paper. The present one concentrates on her writings in five main areas: (i the economics of imperfect competition; (ii the theory of employment; (iii the theory of accumulation in the long run; (iv the concept of capital and the production function; and (v the problem of time in economics as reflected in her writings on the theme history versus equilibrium.Â JEL:Â B31, E24\n\nCarta a Joan Olmos (1984)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nJaÃ©n i Urban, Gaspar\n\n1984-01-01\n\nEn este Ã­tem se presentan dos documentos originales del autor: 1 - Las notas manuscritas para una conferencia impartida en la Facultad de FilosofÃ­a de Valencia sobre poesÃ­a y poÃ©ticas el 27 de enero de 1984. 2 â El mecanoscrito de una carta dirigida a Joan Olmos (en aquellos momentos director general de carreteras de la Generalitat Valenciana) lamentando la tala de unos Ã¡rboles centenarios.

This paper describes some of the groundwater quality studies undertaken in support of the rehabilitation program including sampling within the tailings dam to determine the profile of radionuclides, accelerated leaching tests on tailings to estimate long-term release rates of radium, monitoring of piezometers to determine the rate of movement of contaminants, and disposal of acidic effluent by neutralization and ion exchange through infiltration trenches. From accelerated leaching tests, it is estimated that a maximum of 0.13% of 226 Ra will be leached from the tailings in the first 1,000 years. There is no evidence that uranium or any of its daughters is moving away from the waste disposal area. The movement of heavy metals, radionuclides and acidity is strongly retarded by the alkaline soils\n\nLa aportaciÃ³n bibliogrÃ¡fica de Joan Bardina a la EducaciÃ³n FÃ­sica moderna (1911-1939. // Joan Bardina's contribution to modern Physical Education.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nXavier Torrebadella Flix\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available (ES El pedagogo e higienista catalÃ¡n Joan Bardina Castara (Barcelona, 1877âValparaÃ­so, 1950 despuntÃ³ durante el primer tercio del siglo XX como uno de los principales propagadores de la educaciÃ³n fÃ­sica en EspaÃ±a.

Instead of a singular fixed identity, masculinity has now been claimed to be branching into several types â hegemonic masculinity, complicit masculinity, marginalized masculinity, and subordinated masculinity. By utilizing the notion of hegemonic masculinity, this paper observes the thoughts and decisions made by men in Kathleen Winterâs Annabel.

Several sections of the plant were modified or completely changed for the second operation. The most important change was the replacement of ion exchange with solvent extraction as the means of purifying and upgrading uranium rich solutions. Most of the problems experienced in the solvent extraction system originate from the leach liquor which has a strong tendency to form stable emulsions. This has been countered by some careful control of leaching conditions and by closer observation of operations in the solvent extraction area. Most problems have now been resolved and plant recoveries are quite satisfactory\n\nA retrospective diagnosis of epilepsy in three historical figures: St Paul, Joan of Arc and Socrates.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMuhammed, Louwai\n\n2013-11-01\n\nIt has been suggested that undiagnosed epilepsy profoundly influenced the lives of several key figures in history. Historical sources recounting strange voices and visions may in fact have been describing manifestations of epileptic seizures rather than more supernatural phenomena. Well-documented accounts of such experiences exist for three individuals in particular: Socrates, St Paul and Joan of Arc. The great philosopher Socrates described a 'daimonion' that would visit him throughout his life. This daimonion may have represented recurrent simple partial seizures, while the peculiar periods of motionlessness for which Socrates was well known may have been the result of co-existing complex partial seizures. St Paul's religious conversion on the Road to Damascus may have followed a temporal lobe seizure which would account for the lights, voices, blindness and even the religious ecstasy he described. Finally, Joan of Arc gave a detailed narrative on the voices she heard from childhood during her Trial of Condemnation. Her auditory hallucinations appear to follow sudden acoustic stimuli in a way reminiscent of idiopathic partial epilepsy with auditory features. By analysing passages from historical texts, it is possible to argue that Socrates, St Paul and Joan of Arc each had epilepsy.\n\nThe recommissioning of the treatment plant at Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nThomas, J.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThe recommissioning of the plant at Mary Kathleen involved several distinct phases. The previous plant process was modified significantly, the plant capacity was increased by the addition of new equipment and the existing equipment was in most cases overhauled. This equipment was either reused in its original duty or relocated. Maintenance requirements after the plant was commissioned were high because of the amount of modified equipment and also because some old items of equipment were deliberately not overhauled during recommissioning. The equipment that was overhauled has operated reliably. However some new equipment has not been as satisfactory\n\nJoan of Arc: Sanctity, witchcraft or epilepsy?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNicastro, Nicolas; Picard, Fabienne\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe objective of this article is to describe whether Joan of Arc had epilepsy and how that may have influenced her sense of mission and ability to encourage thousands of people to help her to chase the English out of France. Documentation of her Trial of Condemnation in 1431 provides a description of her episodes of experienced voices and visions. From the age of thirteen, Joan of Arc experienced frequent episodes of auditory hallucinations associated with elementary or complex visual hallucinations (e.g., a great light or human faces). These had sudden onset, lasting seconds or minutes at most, and occurred when awake or during sleep, arousing her. Some could be triggered by an auditory stimulus. She had no disorganized thought between the episodes. The semiology of the episodes is very suggestive of epileptic seizures, which have been considered as ecstatic by some authors or as partial epilepsy with auditory features by others, which seems more concordant with the ictal symptoms. The auditory and visual hallucinations could have had a religious content because during her childhood and adolescence, she was brought up in a religious environment, insomuch as this content first undefined only appeared after a few seizures. We can suppose that such hallucinations, without the knowledge of their medical origin, gave her a sense of divine mission, hence, a real strength to try to accomplish the orders she heard during the episodes. Her role during the Hundred Years' War and her narration of her strange episodes led her to be burned for heresy at the age of nineteen, yet rehabilitated 25 years later and to be canonized for her achievements in 1920.

The plan was based on three basic principles of: making all areas safe for public access; removing all structures which could deteriorate and become unsightly or unsafe with time; and encouraging natural revegetation on erosion resistant surfaces. The aim was to leave the site in a safe and satisfactory condition, consistent with future land use in the area, requiring no foreseeable ongoing maintenance and a minimum of precautionary monitoring. When the programme has been completed, the only constraint on future land use will be the need to control building construction in the tailings/ evaporation, dumps and mine areas as a precaution against possible exposure to radon daughters. Appropriate radiation and water quality monitoring programmes were incorporated in the plan\n\nEntrevista: Joan Martinez-Alier\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaria AmÃ©lia EnrÃ­quez\n\n2011-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Nesta seÃ§Ã£o de entrevistas da Revista âSustentabilidade em Debateâ nosso convidado especial Ã© Joan Martinez-Alier, um dos maiores expoentes da economia ecolÃ³gica.

The translation is based on the only known manuscript (BNFms Nat. lat. 8756, edited by Evencio Beltran. The likelihood of the perfect union between bodyand soul and the complete accord between two friends is the basic analogy of the text and guidesthe composition of a historical and philosophical introduction that precedes the translation.

The object of the plan is to make all areas safe, remove all non-permanent structures and encourage natural revegetation. The plan has been accepted by the Queensland Mines Department. The mine pit will be left stable, inaccessible to vehicles, and containing about 50 metres of water. Mine waste and borrow areas will be contoured, ripped and seeded to encourage revegetation. The treatment plant area will be cleared of all equipment and light structures, decontaminated and revegetated. The evaporation ponds will be dried out, precipitate and contaminated soil will be removed to the tailings dam, and the area will be contoured and revegetated. The tailings will be covered with one metre of waste rock and boreholes will be used to recover groundwater containing salts for storage in the pit\n\nAnÃ¡lisis del duelo en la literatura de Joan Didion\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nEscobar Rovira, Marina\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEl treball present es basa en lâanÃ lisi del dol dins la literatura de Joan Didion, novelÂ·lista i periodista dâEstats Units.

In late 2003, while her only child lay critically ill, her husband, John, died suddenly. Theirs was a marriage of great intimacy and love. Grief enveloped her. Eventually she began to write an account of the first 12 months of her bereavement and the vigil for her child: The year of magical thinking. Raw, insightful and challenging, it is a rich, generous and graceful document. Didion draws on the literature of grief, personal and professional. Here, those readings are examined and reflections are made on the singular, unique grief of the author in the context of current theories on bereavement.\n\nJoan Maragall: un aristocrÃ tic platÃ²nic preocupat per la democrÃ cia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJordi Mir Garcia\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available El creixement de les idees i les reivindicacions democrÃ tiques preocupen Joan Maragall.

This paper, based on material from the recently opened Dame Kathleen Lonsdale Papers, argues that Lonsdale's scientific career was shaped in particular ways by her identity not just as a woman, but as a married woman and a mother. When interacting with her scientific colleagues, Lonsdale frequently had to confront the assumption that married women should not pursue scientific careers, an attitude shaped by British concerns about reasserting traditional gender roles after the World Wars I and II. Furthermore, although Lonsdale's husband, Thomas, was an ardent supporter of her career, in the early 1930s Lonsdale left research temporarily to care for her small children. Her desire to work from home during this period led her to pursue one of her most significant scientific projects: the creation of crystallographic reference tables. Lonsdale's own experiences, and those of her female students, led her to focus on issues of marriage and family when she began speaking and writing about women in science during the late 1960s.\n\nThe Joan Wint Story: Biography of a Principal Whose Leadership for Social Justice Transformed a Rural Jamaican High School\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOram-Sterling, Jacqueline\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis dissertation is a biographical study of the life of a retired high school principal in Jamaica.

The drawing, until now known only through the black and white photograph, could be thoroughly analysed for the first time. In the context of information thus obtained, the historical context of creating the sketch transpired as an equally important matter, including the hypothetical role that may have been played in its creation by Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc.\n\nCan Joan of Arc Serve as an Enduring Model of Empowerment for Women With a Cancer Diagnosis?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRoseman, Janet Lynn\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMany research studies have shown that arts-based medicine is a viable and effective medical strategy to help people with cancer improve the quality of their lives. The use of arts-based strategies that employ a figure from history as a source of support to help improve the quality of life has not been documented. The current limited study allowed the author the ability to use the materials in her book, If Joan of Arc Had Cancer: Finding Courage, Faith, and Healing From History's Most Inspirational Woman Warrior, to provide support to women who were cancer survivors and to see if the use of Joan of Arc as a healing guide would be relevant. The primary intention was to find out how the book would be received by women with cancer and also to have the opportunity to determine what was helpful and what was not useful for them. The study was a pilot study. The study took place at the Gilda's Club, a national support community for people with cancer and their families, in Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA, one of the satellite programs sponsored by the Wellness Community. Participants were 10 female survivors of cancer who were members of the Gilda's Club. Participants took part in a 6-wk workshop. The workshop included arts-based medicine and meditations, based on a book written by the current author. Participants completed surveys both pre- and postintervention. The program had 10 participants, but only 3 women finished the 6-wk program and completed the postintervention survey. After the workshop, the 3 participants indicated in a survey that they were feeling less anxiety and fear and noted that they felt that they had an improved quality of life and felt more empowered with respect to their psychological frames of mind. In addition, when asked on the survey about the effectiveness of their communications with their physicians (ie, their ability to express and discuss their psychosocial and physical needs combined), they also indicated that they felt that their communications\n\nHegemonic Masculinity and the Position of Men in Kathleen Winterâs Annabel\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTay Lai Kit\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Emerging from the1980s, the concept of masculinity has slowly started to make its way towards social studies. Instead of a singular fixed identity, masculinity has now been claimed to be branching into several types â hegemonic masculinity, complicit masculinity, marginalized masculinity, and subordinated masculinity. By utilizing the notion of hegemonic masculinity, this paper observes the thoughts and decisions made by men in Kathleen Winterâs Annabel. This paper explores and re-examines the position of men in their society with reference to the effect of hegemonic masculinity, as proposed by Connell. It is also within the scope of the study to trace the position of men in the novel through a series of negotiations made within themselves. This study reveals the typical behavior of an alpha male of hegemonic masculinity in Annabel. For hegemony to pan out, all members of society should have respective social duties in order for the entire mechanism to function. The paper demonstrated that male characters of the novel exude the position of men in the hegemonic masculine setting by showcasing the firmness in making decisions, having knowledge on faith, religion, and monetary issues.

The subversion coated a distinctly anticlerical, with many churches and convents burned and were killed three priests. Joan Maragall wrote three articles disagreeing from the harsh crackdown of the government, backed by the general opinion. In first article Maragall censured the Catalan bourgeoisie by his little love for the poor. In the second asked that no longer apply the death penalty, but not published it. In the third and most famous explained his experience of a Mass celebrated in a church burned by the revolutionaries, which was what the Church should be, free of state protection and of the rich, and celebrated in the language of people.

Despite the fact that the original purpose of the building was to be used a warehouse of the port, the needs of the local government forced it to extend its functions turning it into a palace receiving prominent figures and being the emplacement of many ceremonies and banquets. The importance of the House of the Dockyards can be appreciated in its dimensions, as we can see in the engravings and landscapes illustrations of El Grao, and in the work produced by Joan del Poyo after returning from Barcelona, where he served the king Martin I, probably in the Royal Palace of the city.\n\nLa construcciÃ³n de la Casa de las Atarazanas en la lÃ­nea litoral de la urbe por parte del gobierno municipal se debiÃ³ tanto a la polÃ­tica urbanÃ­stica emprendida por el patriciado urbano centrada en mostrar una imagen de belleza y decoro en todos sus frentes, como a la influencia que pudo haber ejercido MartÃ­n I en el reino de Valencia, y su deseo no satisfecho de edificar en Barcelona un palacio cercano a la costa.

Rehabilitation of the site was completed in 1985 and the work won an award for environmental excellence. In 1999 gamma-ray data, plus stream sediment, soil, rock chip, mineral efflorescence, vegetation and water samples were collected from selected sites to assist in the examination of the current environmental status of the rehabilitated area. This paper presents preliminary results and interpretations. In the Mark Kathleen open pit, skarn type U-Th-REE mineralisation is hosted in amphibolite grade metamorphosed calc-silicate, mafic to intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks. Remnant ore zones are composed of medium to coarse grained garnet and clinopyroxene, with accessory allanite, plagioclase, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and uraninite. Later retrograde alteration to chlorite, calcite, sericite, epidote and scapolite occurs. Fine grained uraninite is enclosed in allanite, and is partly replaced by metamict products nd traces of galena. Elevated gamma-ray readings in the open pit correspond to exposed ore lenses, the former haul road and abandoned ore stockpiles (up to 16 mSv/year). Surficial oxidation of ore and adjacent sulphide-bearing calc-silicate rocks has led to contemporary precipitation of yellow, orange, green and white mineral efflorescences on the pit walls. Wallrock oxidation of reactive sulphides (mainly pyrrhotite breakdown) produces acidic solutions, however, buffering reactions of these fluids with gangue calc-silicates and carbonate phases prevent low pH conditions from developing. The open pit lake is approximately 40m deep and contains saline (0.15%) surface waters which are Ca-, SO 4 -rich with elevated Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, U and Zn at a pH of 6.11. Waste rock piles are up to 30m thick and have been covered by a thin veneer of benign waste.

A defining attribute of this work is the use of objective, biomechanical measures as the basis from which a fuller understanding of all factors affecting worker performance can be obtained, and how such performance should be measured and evaluated. The central objectives and conclusions of Dr. Stevenson's research programs spanning the years from 1985 through 2012 are summarized and discussed in terms of an overall research trajectory. The guiding principle of Dr. Stevenson's work is to reduce the potential harm to which workers are exposed through the development of bona fide occupational standards, a better understanding of risk factors leading to low back pain, and the establishment of an enhanced objective design process for functional load-bearing clothing and equipment.\n\nVideoblogit yhteiskunnallisina vaikuttajina\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMartin, Maria\n\n2016-01-01\n\nVideobloggaus on noussut suosituksi sosiaalisen median ilmiÃ¶ksi.

Claiming a sceptical attitude towards any given ideology, Didion places her two novels (Play It As It Lays, A Book of Common Prayer and non-fiction book (The White Album within the history of that decade as filtered through an overtly autobiographical and idiosyncratic story. Out of a personal experience and understanding of that decade â of its collective imagination, its shared or unshared events and symbols â as one dominated by a sense of loss Didion creates women characters who survive both the âabjectâ of their female bodies and the irreversible impoverishment of the last (and lost frontiers in which their stories are set. Late-modern versions of a long-abiding and well-established American literary tradition, the character-narrators of Play It As It Lays, A Book of Common Prayer and the witness-persona of The White Album respond to Didionâs aesthetic insight into the testimonial mode, its limits and potentialities, and a narratological strategy which, not unlike the postmodern narratives of the same decade, moves toward the dissolution, scattering, and reassembling of narrative functions (author, narrator, character, and reader.\n\nApplication of the index WQI-CCME with data aggregation per monitoring campaign and per section of the river: case study-Joanes River, Brazil.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nde Almeida, Geane Silva; de Oliveira, Iara BrandÃ£o\n\n2018-03-07\n\nThis work applied the Water Quality Index developed by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (WQI-CCME), to communicate the water quality per section of the Joanes River basin, State of Bahia, Brazil.

This paper presents a new aggregation method to calculate the WQI-CCME because, to apply the original method in Joanes River, a huge loss of information would occur, by the fact that, the number of analyzed parameters varied between the monitoring campaigns developed by the Government Monitoring Program. This work modified the original aggregation method replacing it by a data aggregation for a single monitoring campaign, in a minimum of four monitoring locations per section of the river and a minimum of four parameters per monitoring location. Comparison between the calculation of WQI-CCME for river sections, with the index, WQI-CETESB, developed by the Brazilian Environmental Sanitation and Technology Company-CETESB, proved the applicability of the new aggregation method. The WQI-CETESB has it bases on the WQI from the National Sanitation Foundation and uses nine fixed parameters. As WQI-CCME uses the totality of the analyzed parameters without restrictions, it is more flexible, and the results seem more adequate to indicate the real river water quality. However, the WQI-CCME has a more stringent water quality scale in comparison with the WQI-CETESB, resulting in inferior water quality information. In conclusion, the WQI-CCME with a new aggregation method is adequate for communicating the water quality at a given time, per section of a river, respecting the minimum number of four analyses and four monitoring points. As a result, without a need to wait for other campaigns, it reduces the cost of a monitoring program and the period to communicate the water quality.

In the analysis of the five first scenes of the film, the focus will be on the notion of scenic- and human- beauty that is at once arresting and foreboding, and the various contrasting and parallel spaces that characterise the structure of book and film. The article will draw from a number of additional secondary sources, including various cultural readings which offer alternative methodological approaches to the works analysed, and recorded 1970s interviews with the author and the filmmaker.\n\nâA good deal about California does not, on its own preferred terms, add upâ: Joan Didion between Dawning Apocalypse and Retrogressive Utopia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEva-Sabine Zehelein\n\n2011-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Joan Didionâs depiction of the American West and California is colored by an idiosyncratic sensitivity to her surroundings, intertwined with a sentimental-retrogressive image of the nature, history, character, and meaning of the West as a cultural topos. Her New Journalism-like observations of California are always closely linked to her own self and psyche, are seismographs of her own confusions, of moments of disorientation, insecurity, and loss. Didion is therefore one of those exceptional writers, who, in her fictionalized reportages, comments on American reality, ideas, and her own predicament. Identity and landscape fuse into an auto-psychoanalysis, which at the same time reveals a great deal about the American condition, its constantly strained relationship between rhetoric or auto-mythology and lived reality. This article draws primarily on Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968 and Where I Was From (2003, but also on After Henry (1992 and The White Album (1979, to illustrate these points.\n\nDatascapes o los paisajes visuales de la globalizaciÃ³n: Googlegrams de Joan Fontcuberta y Technophobia de Gordon Cheung\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHidalgo, Emilse\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available [es] Este artÃ­culo explora los collages de Gordon Cheung y Joan Fontcuberta para debatir lo que Arjun Appadurai ha identificado como los paisajes mediÃ¡ticos, Ã©tnicos, ideolÃ³gicos y financieros de la globalizaciÃ³n. El argumento principal se centra en cÃ³mo sus obras exploran los medios tecnolÃ³gicos en el campo de la cultura sin abandonar la funciÃ³n polÃ­tica del arte, entendida aquÃ­ como crÃ­tica reflexiva. La obra de Cheung es interpretada desde los espacios neoliberales contemporÃ¡neos urbanos, segÃºn los teorizan David Harvey y Marc AugÃ©. Obras como Technophobia, de Cheung, evocan, por un lado, los âno-lugaresâ de la sobremodernidad, y la omnipresencia del capitalismo financiero neoliberal, por otro. Los collages foto-mediÃ¡ticos de Fontcuberta son analizados desde las controversias que los binomios verdad/ objetividad/ referencialidad vs falacia/ manipulaciÃ³n/ construcciÃ³n aÃºn despiertan en el fotoperiodismo y el documentalismo en la era de la reproducciÃ³n digital. La funciÃ³n polÃ­tica de estos collages es rescatada como una forma no sÃ³lo de evitar la banalizaciÃ³n de la cultura de masas, de la reproduciÃ³n ad infinitum de imÃ¡genes, y de la muerte de la originalidad, la autorÃ­a, y la primacÃ­a de la copia, el recorte, la imitaciÃ³n y el ensamble de materiales reciclados, sino tambiÃ©n como una forma de estimular una reflexividad crÃ­tica polÃ­tica y social. [en] This paper looks into the collages of Gordon Cheung and Joan Fontcuberta to discuss what Arjun Appadurai has identified as the ethno-/finance-/media-/and ideological-scapes of modernity and globalization. On the main, the argument focuses on how their work explores the technological media in the field of culture without abandoning the political function of art, understood here as a critical reflexivity. Cheungâs work is interpreted from the perspective of its representation of contemporary neoliberal spaces, as theorised by David Harvey and Marc AugÃ©.

This book could be a breakthrough for teachers in the trenches who are interested in or need to know about quantitative literacy (QL. It is a resource providing 85 topical pieces, averaging 1.5 pages, in which a featured Web site is presented, described, and accompanied by 2-4 critical-thinking questions purposefully drawing on data from the Web site. The featured Web sites range from primary documents (e.g., All about California and the Inducements to Settle There, 1870 to modern databases (e.g., city-data.com. The 85 pieces are organized under three headings (Social Science Sites; U.S. History Sites; World History Sites following three chapters introducing QL, quantitative sources, and communicating with data. The QL skills in the questions are the usual suspects such as making comparisons, graph reading, table reading, and calculating and thinking about ratios. The author, the Head Librarian at the National Cathedral School (Washington DC, clearly aims the book at high school teachers who wish to comply with the Common Core Standards, which call for making communication with data a part of English Language Arts. The authors of this review believe the book will be of great value for college-level teachers too, whether they be interested in finding context (e.g., history and social science topics for their QL-math courses, or adding QL-type questions to their in-discipline courses. Moreover, we fervently wish that this book will inspire others to create and compile similar resources in such a way that, in the future, there will be a vast open-access library of such collections of QL questions coupled to data sources â with updated links â available on the\n\nRessenya a Alexandre Font Jaume, Gabriel Ensenyat Pujol, Ãngela MartÃ­ BorrÃ s, Mireia Mulet Mas, Josep Campillo GalmÃ©s (eds: Joan Baptista Binimelis: Sobre els vicis de les dones i el seu tarannÃ variable.

A case study from the 'Kolberger Heide' ammunition dump site (Baltic Sea, Germany)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKunde, Tina; Schneider von Deimling, Jens\n\n2016-04-01\n\nDumped ammunition in the sea is a matter of great concern in terms of safe navigation and environmental threads. Because corrosion of the dumped ammunition's hull is ongoing, future contamination of the ambient water by their toxic interior is likely to occur. The location of such dump sites is approximately known from historical research and ship log book analyses. Subsequent remote sensing of ammunition dumping sites (e.g. mines) on the seafloor is preferentially performed with hydro-acoustic methods such as high resolution towed side scan or by the sophisticated synthetic aperture sonar approach with autonomous underwater vehicles. However, these are time consuming and expensive procedures, while determining the precise position of individual mines remains a challenging task. To mitigate these shortcomings we suggest using ship-born high-frequency multibeam sonar in shallow water to address the task of mine detection and precise localization on the seabed. Multibeam sonar systems have improved their potential in regard to backscatter analyses significantly over the past years and nowadays present fast and accurate tools for shallow water surveying to (1) detect mines in multibeam snippet backscatter data (2) determine their precise location with high accuracy intertial navigation systems. A case study was performed at the prominent ammunition dumping site 'Kolberger Heide' (Baltic Sea, Germany) in the year 2014 using a modern hydro-acoustic multibeam echosounder system with 200-400 kHz (KONGSBERG EM2040c). With an average water depth of not even 20 m and the proximity to the shore line and dense waterways, this investigated area requires permanent navigational care. Previously, the study area was surveyed by the Navy with the very sophisticated HUGIN AUV equipped with a synthetic aperture sonar with best resolution by current technology. Following an evaluation of the collected data, various ammunition bodies on the sea floor could be clearly detected.

Two nurses from the department were present for hand-over, and three ambulance persons brought her in. Joan's condition appeared stable, as far as I could tell; her bed was at a ninety-degree angle and her oxygen-assisted breathing was very laboured, but she seemed aware of her immediate surroundings. Joan traveled on the helicopter trolley into the emergency ward, was transferred to an emergency bed, the necessary tubes and wires were re-organised, her hand-over was verbalised and the personal weekends of the treating team were discussed amongst themselves. To my increasing frustration, not one staff member looked Joan in the eye, said hello, or did anything to acknowledge her presence as anything other than another technical detail. This paper was inspired by this incident viewed as a nursing student in the emergency department. The clinical reflection that developed around this particular incident was how easily care by nurses could be limited to the physical needs of the patient. This paper is premised on the clinical reflection that engagement by nurses with patients is necessary for optimal patient care. The literature was reviewed, and the concept of 'engagement' was used to refer to the actual connection of one person to another via honest care and dedicated communication. I suggest, with literary support, that this lack of engagement extends from the inability of the nurse to provide sufficient care to fulfill the needs of the patient. The current mismatch between duty and ability for nurses is cited as being due to an increasing number of stressors. Major stressors include a lack of support from senior staff; insufficient staff; having too much work and too little time, and the inability to meet patients' needs (McNeely 1996). Accumulated stress has detrimental\n\nBird-strike of a Cinereous Vulture Aegypius monachus in the ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nCampbell Murn\n\nBird-strike of a Cinereous Vulture Aegypius monachus in the Balearic Islands, Spain.

Joan Henry lo traduce al inglÃ©s en 1998 y lo titula The Stories of Tata Mundo, transportando al campesino costarricense a la escena de habla inglesa. Se analizan las decisiones de la traductora sobre el tratamiento de las metÃ¡foras, teniendo en cuenta el lenguaje figurado como una herramienta empleada por el autor para caracterizar la vida rural del campesinado costarricense. Using traditional activities and regionalisms, FabiÃ¡n Dobles reconstructed the image of the Costa Rican country folk of the mid-twentieth century in his literary work Historias de Tata Mundo. Joan Henry translated it in 1998, with the title The Stories of Tata Mundo, transporting the local peasant to the English-speaking scenario. The translatorâs decisions are analyzedÂ here regarding the translation of metaphors, taking into account figurative speech as a tool used by the author to characterize and depict the rural life of Costa Rican country folk.\n\nPrejudicis i censures en la filologia catalana medieval\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJosep Guia\n\n2014-06-01\n\nFull Text Available A la vista de diverses publicacions recents, en les quals se citen treballs meus de forma incompleta i tergiversada, em veig en lâobligaciÃ³ dâesmenar les errades i de donar nous arguments a favor de la meua hipÃ²tesi sobre la producciÃ³ literÃ ria de Joan RoÃ­s de Corella.
