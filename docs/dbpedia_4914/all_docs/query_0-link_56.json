        "text": "Volume 2 of A Comparative History of Literatures in the Iberian Peninsula brings to an end this collective work that aims at surveying the network of interliterary relations in the Iberian Peninsula. No attempt at such a comparative history of literatures in the Iberian Peninsula has been made until now. In this volume, the focus is placed on images (Section 1), genres (Section 2), forms of mediation (Section 3), and cultural studies and literary repertoires (Section 4). To these four sections an epilogue is added, in which specialists in literatures in the Iberian Peninsula, as well as in the (sub)disciplines of comparative history and comparative literary history, search for links between Volumes 1 and 2 from the point of view of general contributions to the field of Iberian comparative studies, and assess the entire project that now reaches completion with contributions from almost one hundred scholars.\n\nThis course will be devoted to closely reading literary works of Spanish Medieval Literature, emphasising their relation (or lack of) with the canon of medieval Spanish literature. Texts from prose fiction and poetry will be carefully analyzed, and in studying them serious considerations will be given to matters of both content and structure. Because of this, the design of this course implies a focus on Critical Thinking through acquiring a blend of theoretical concepts and practical applications. Literary analysis is an activity for which skills, knowledge, and preparation are needed"
