About Joan Maragall Gardens

The Montjuïc Joan Maragall Gardens, Jardins Joan Maragall is a captivating tranquil oasis of elegant landscaping that is little known by tourists and Barcelona residents because until about a year ago the gardens were permanently closed to the public. Today the gardens have limited weekend opening hours.

The gardens are arranged around Albéniz Palace, Palauet Albéniz, that was built as a royal pavilion for the 1929 International Exposition, being held in Montjuïc. Palauet Albéniz was built in a Neoclassical style by the architect Joan Moya. The gardens were designed by Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier.

Jardins Joan Maragall is named after the renowned Catalan poet, and is made up of broad lawns, several ponds, ornamental fountains, colourful flower beds during summer, numerous sculptures and plants with a layout inspired by French landscape gardening during the 20th century.

Palauet Albéniz, along with Pedralbes Palace was one of the official residence's of Spain's royal family on their visits to Barcelona.
