Last month, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that gave American women the right to have an abortion, pop singer Pink took to social media to make it clear where she stands on the issue: “[I]f you believe the government belongs in a woman’s uterus…FUCK RIGHT OFF.” Perhaps inevitably, she received immediate pushback from Twitter trolls who instructed her to stay in her lane, calling the Grammy-winning, multiplatinum pop icon “irrelevant.”

Now, Pink has responded by releasing a protest anthem titled, naturally, “Irrelevant.” “As a woman with an opinion and the fearlessness to voice that opinion, it gets very tiring when the only retort is to tell me how irrelevant I am,” she says of the inspiration behind the song. “I am relevant because I exist, and because I am a human being. No one is irrelevant. And no one can take away my voice.”

The catchy pop-punk song channels the scrappy energy and brash outspokenness that helped make Pink a star and which was largely missing from the artist’s last couple of albums, including 2018’s Hurts 2B Human. “I’ll be your heretic, you fuckin’ hypocrite/I won’t think of you at all,” she sneers. Not to put too fine a point on it, the song reaches a climax with the repeated refrain, “Girls just wanna have rights/So why do we have to fight?”

Proceeds from “Irrelevant” will go to When We All Vote, the nonpartisan voting initiative created by former First Lady Michelle Obama. The advocacy group’s mission is to increase participation in each election cycle by helping to close race and age gaps by registering new voters.
