        "text": "The world-famous hit by American singer-songwriter Don McLean (b. 1945) is officially called ‘Vincent’, but is more often referred to by the opening line 'Starry, Starry Night'.\n\nMcLean says he was reading a biography of Vincent van Gogh when he stumbled upon the idea of composing a song about him. The song became an homage to the artist and his work.\n\nMcLean understands Vincent’s struggle. That he wasn’t crazy, but that he was afflicted by illness. 'Now I understand what you tried to say to me, and how you suffered for your sanity'.\n\nIf you listen carefully, you’ll hear that McLean not only sings about Starry Night, but also other paintings by Vincent."
