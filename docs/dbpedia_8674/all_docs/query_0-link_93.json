        "text": "Bio\n\nCountry superstar and 2x CMA Entertainer of the Year Luke Combs is a multi-platinum, award-winning artist from Asheville, NC.\n\nAdding to an already triumphant career, Combs’ new full-length album, Fathers & Sons, is out now on Columbia Nashville. The first album of its kind, Fathers & Sons features Combs most personal songwriting to date, as he reflects on his own experiences being a dad to his two sons and the unique bond between parents and their children. The record consists of 12 poignant tracks including “The Man He Sees In Me,” which recently debuted.\n\nA Grand Ole Opry-member and 11x CMA, 4x ACM, 6x Billboard Music Award-winner, Combs also recently released his new radio single, “Ain’t No Love in Oklahoma,” which will be featured on the soundtrack for the new Twisters movie (out July 19), is the subject of a new exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum opening July 11 and is in the midst of his record-breaking “Growin’ Up and Gettin’ Old” stadium tour. Upcoming stops include sold-out, back-to-back shows at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium, East Rutherford’s MetLife Stadium, Salt Lake City’s Rice-Eccles Stadium and Cincinnati’s Paycor Stadium among others.\n\nEarlier this year, Combs performed an unforgettable duet of “Fast Car” with Tracy Chapman during the 66th Annual GRAMMY Awards, which Rolling Stone called “one of the all-time best collaborative performances in Grammy history.” The performance added to a massive year for “Fast Car,” as Combs’ version of the song won Single of the Year at the 2024 ACM Awards and 2023 CMA Awards (with Chapman winning Song of the Year). It also spent five-consecutive weeks atop Billboard’s Country Airplay chart and reached #1 on the Hot AC chart, the first song by a male solo artist to ever top both. The 2x Platinum single, which has garnered over 1.1 billion global streams to date, also spent eighteen weeks in the top 5 of Billboard’s all-genre Hot 100 chart, eight of which were spent at #2."
