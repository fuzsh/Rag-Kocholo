        "text": "Country musician Josh Turner is making his way to the Ozarks next week for a show that coincides with the release of his upcoming album.\n\nTurner, known for hits like \"Your Man,\" \"Long Black Train\" and \"Why Don't We Just Dance,\" is performing at Black Oak Amphitheater in Lampe on Friday, Aug. 16. The concert is a part of Turner's ongoing \"The Greatest Hits Tour.\"\n\nTurner will be joined on stage next week by fellow country artist Tracy Lawrence, known for singles like \"Paint Me a Birmingham,\" \"Time Marches On\" and \"Sticks and Stones.\" Tickets are available on the Black Oak Amphitheater website, starting at $39.50.\n\nIn addition to the concert, Turner is hosting an album release signing with fans at the Branson Cracker Barrel at 10 a.m. Aug. 16. Entry is free. The Branson Cracker Barrel is located at 3765 W. Highway 76.\n\nTurner's new album, \"This Country Music Thing,\" will release early Aug. 16. The album features 11 tracks, three of which were written or co-written by Turner.\n\nSpeaking with the News-Leader on Wednesday, Turner said he began working on the album in late 2022.\n\n\"There's a lot of new, fresh sounding stuff on here, but it's also a very traditional country music record, so I think a lot of people will take away good things from this,\" Turner said.\n\nOne of the most notable tracks on the album is \"Down in Georgia,\" which Turner released earlier this year. Turner said the track was written by three men — Tyler Booth, Anthony Olympia and Brent Rupard — he doesn't know.\n\n\"They don't really know me, but I think they heard through the grapevine that I was in the process of actually moving to Georgia. That song, when I heard it, it was not public knowledge that I was moving, so it was like, 'Okay, have these guys been reading my mail?'\" Turner said with a chuckle. \"That kind of struck a personal chord with me and I loved what it said and I loved the way it sounded musically. It was something that I had never really had on any of my previous records, so it was a good way to lead the record off.\"\n\nTurner said he was introduced to the men's song by his brother, Matt Turner, who works in the publishing industry.\n\n\"He's been pitching me songs for years and this was finally the first one that I've ever recorded that he's pitched me,\" Turner said. \"He finally got to breathe a sigh of relief when I recorded that.\" Turner said as of Tuesday, he still hasn't met the three men.\n\nTurner, who released his first studio album \"Long Black Train\" in 2003, said \"This Country Music Thing\" is an ode to his over 20-year music career. Over two decades, Turner has witnessed the evolution of the country music genre.\n\n\"I've seen it chase a lot of trends, just chew some artists up and spit them out, unfortunately,\" Turner said. \"But it's allowed me to have a lot of success. I've been able to do things that I never thought were possible. I've spent the last several years doing passion projects of mine. Even in the midst of that ... my label still believed in me enough to go and offer me another deal to put out yet another mainstream country record.\"\n\nThese passion projects include three albums: \"King Size Manger,\" a Christmas record; \"I Serve a Savior,\" a Christian project; and \"Country State of Mind,\" a country influences album.\n\nWhen asked about his favorite part of the Ozarks, Turner said it's the fans.\n\n\"I've spent a good amount of time with other Missourians like Sara Evans and Rhonda Vincent and they're very proud of that region and that state,\" Turner said. \"I just always love going to that area because the fans are my kind of people and love what we do.\"\n\nMore: Route 66 Festival, Ozark Music Festival and more happening this August\n\nWhat's the track list for 'This Country Music Thing'?\n\n\"Down in Georgia\" (Tyler Booth, Anthony Olympia, Brent Rupard)\n\n\"If You Ain't With Me\" (Marv Green, Lance Miller, Jimmy Yeary)\n\n\"I Just Wanna Kiss You\" (Jeff Hyde, Jon Nite)\n\n\"Heatin' Things Up\" (Marv Green, Luke Laird, Brice Long)\n\n\"This Country Music Thing\" (Turner)\n\n\"My Side\" (Barton Davies, William Reames, Jeremy Spillman, Ryan Tyndell)\n\n\"Two Steppin' On The Moon\" (Matt Dragstrem, Chase McGill, John Pierce)\n\n\"Somewhere With Her\" (Rhett Atkins, Will Bundy, Josh Miller)\n\n\"Whirlwind\" (Turner, Mark Namore)\n\n\"Pretty Please\" (Wyatt McCubbin, Jon Randall, Gordie Sampson)\n\n\"Unsung Hero\" (Turner)"
