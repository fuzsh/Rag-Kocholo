        "text": "Back in the day, you know\n\nsort of talking a few hundred years ago,\n\npeople thought that an interval called\n\nthe tritone was very, very devilish and\n\nand this is what it sounds like. [Dramatic Piano Note]\n\nNo, I'm just joking, just joking.\n\nIt sounds like this. [Somber Piano Note]\n\nWhat's up, everybody,\n\nmy name is Jacob Collier and this,\n\nis music theory support.\n\nWe have a question from David Brown.\n\nI don't know the difference\n\nbetween pitch and timbre.\n\nPitch and timbre are\n\ntwo very different things.\n\nThe pitch of a note is how high\n\nor low the note is.\n\nSo here's a high note. [High Piano Note]\n\nThat's a C sharp and the pitch is quite high.\n\nAnd here, [Low Piano Note]\n\nthat's a very low note.\n\nThat's an E.\n\nTimbre is the kind of texture of a note\n\nor the, the quality a note has.\n\nSo I play a note right? [Piano Note]\n\nE-flat, and then I sing,\n\n[Sings Note] that's an E-flat\n\n[Piano Note]\n\n[Sings Note] they're the same note,\n\nthey're both E-flat,\n\nbut one has the timbre of a MIDI piano. [Piano Note]\n\nAnd then the other is [Sings Note],\n\nthat's a human voice.\n\nSo both very important variables.\n\nI'd highly recommend you explore them both.\n\nI love this question.\n\nMy name is Rachel Chop Suey.\n\nAnd the question is omgawd,\n\nlike what the hell is reharmonization?\n\nWell, reharmonization is when\n\nyou take a harmonization\n\nand you shuffle it up a bit.\n\nJust so you know,\n\nthere are infinite ways to harmonize everything.\n\nJust by way of example, let's take the song\n\nHey Jude, which you probably do know it.\n\nIf you don't know it, that's pretty tragic,\n\nI'm not going to lie.\n\nNow Hey Jude I think is in F major.\n\n[Simplistic Hey Jude]\n\nSo if I harmonize that melody,\n\nit's going to go something like this.\n\n[Harmonized Hey Jude]\n\nYeah.\n\nRight.\n\nSo when we think about reharmonization,\n\nwe take that melody and we think,\n\nhow else could we harmonize this melody?\n\n[Piano Notes Ring]\n\nFirstly, notice\n\n[Piano notes and Singing]\n\nRight?\n\nBut what other cords go with the note A?\n\nThis is the note A. [Piano Note]\n\nNow what other cords go with A?\n\nThere's tons of 'em, for example D.\n\n[Harmonized Piano Notes]\n\nWhoa that's cool, that's a\n\ncompletely different sound, so,\n\n[Piano Notes And Singing]\n\nCrazy, yeah? [Simple Piano Notes And Singing]\n\nSo E means C, that's what he meant.\n\nBut what other chords go with G?\n\nLike E-flat for example.\n\n[Harmonized Piano] Whoa.\n\nSo suddenly we've got\n\n♪ Hey Jude, don't be afraid ♪\n\nIt's like, what are you doing bro?\n\nAnd then,\n\n[Piano Notes And Singing]\n\nYeah?\n\n[Piano Notes And Singing]\n\nThey all have different feelings.\n\nThere's not really a right and a wrong.\n\nIt's just, what do you feel is good?\n\nWhat do you feel is right?\n\nThat, Rachel, is what reharmonization is.\n\nHere's an excellent question from Ethan.\n\nHi and Ethan, what's up?\n\nAnd the question reads as follows.\n\n[Takes Deep Breath]\n\nWhat would you call the second mode\n\nof the major pentatonic scale?\n\nIn C, it's the notes C, D, F, G, and B flat.\n\nI've seen suspended, Dorian pentatonic,\n\nsome other terms.\n\nI love the scale and use it a lot\n\nbut I'm not sure what to call it.\n\nSuggestions? [Labored Breathing]\n\nWell, this is the sound of it,\n\n[Piano Scale Plays]\n\nso I guess that's what it's called, really.\n\n[Piano Scale Plays]\n\nThis is a question from Scott Jasnow.\n\nIt's a short question.\n\nVery simple, very important.\n\nIt's what is middle C?\n\nMiddle C is\n\n[Sings Note]\n\nis the note\n\nthat's kind of in the middle of the piano,\n\nkind of, kind of,\n\nbecause you've got C [High Piano Note Plinks],\n\nyou've got C [Low Piano Note Plays],\n\nyou've got C [Mid-Range Piano Note Plays],\n\nyou've got C, [Mid-Range Piano Note Plays]\n\nyou've got C, [Mid-Range Piano Note Plays]\n\nyou've got C, [Mid-Range Piano Note Plays],\n\nand then in the middle, you got this one.\n\n[Double Glissando]\n\nBut yeah, what's called C4.\n\nIt's like the fourth C on the piano.\n\nAnd I guess it's like the most accessible C,\n\nwhich is itself the most accessible key.\n\nHere's a question from Ralph.\n\nQuestion, is it ever too late\n\nto learn piano/keyboard?\n\nI'm about to enter my fourth decade of existence\n\nand I told myself this year\n\nfor my learn something new,\n\nit would be piano/keyboard.\n\nRalph, it's never too late to learn anything in life.\n\nAnd I would highly recommend\n\nyou learn the piano/keyboard.\n\nThere is bottomless, discovery\n\nand creation and storytelling\n\nand enjoyment to be found.\n\nIt doesn't matter how old you are.\n\nThere's, there is no cap\n\non how relevant music can be in one's life,\n\nso I highly recommend you do it\n\nand I'll hold you to it.\n\nI'll give you a call Ralph,\n\nin about two years' time.\n\nNext up, the question from Roy Wol,\n\nthe question goes,\n\nwhy does music theory sound good to our ears?\n\nIs it science?\n\nSomeone, please answer.\n\nI guess, first of all, music theory\n\ndoesn't really sound like anything.\n\nMusic theory sounds like parchment.\n\nMusic sounds like stuff though.\n\nAnd I guess the honest truth of the matter is\n\nno one really knows.\n\nIt's a bit of a mystery.\n\nNext up, here's a question from trivia mafia.\n\nWhat's the saddest key in music?\n\nThere is no answer to this question.\n\nThere's not one objectively saddest key.\n\nSome people tend to, well opine,\n\nthe minor chords,\n\nand major chords tend to\n\nreflect certain moods\n\nwhich I think to a certain point they do.\n\nSo we've taken an E flat minor\n\n[Somber Piano Chord]\n\nversus E-flat major\n\n[Slow Piano Chord]\n\nOne, perhaps is slightly brighter\n\nthan the other, yeah?\n\nNow, I personally think what makes a chord sad,\n\nis not necessarily whether it's major or minor,\n\nbut the context within which you hear the chord.\n\nSo say I'm in A flat minor, for example\n\nsometimes I'm in A flat minor.\n\n[Melancholy Piano Music]\n\nRight?\n\nIf I go, [Sings With Piano Music]\n\nSay I did that, most of those chords\n\nare major chords.\n\nThat last chord for example,\n\nis B major.\n\nBut if I go,\n\n[Piano Chords Play]\n\nNow that's really sad to me.\n\nThe context of B major coming from A flat minor\n\nis what makes that sad.\n\nFirst of all, I have to commend this username.\n\nHuman equivalent of arson.\n\nAnd the question is,\n\ncan someone explain the circle of fifths\n\nto me because it's gibberish rn.\n\nAnd rn means right now, I've come to realize.\n\nCircle of fifths.\n\nWell, there are 12 notes on the piano, right?\n\nHere they all are.\n\n[Discordant Piano Tone]\n\nOne of the best ways to display\n\nthese notes is in a circle.\n\nSo this is a circle,\n\nand the circle of fifths goes C\n\n[Hums Note],\n\nand then it goes G\n\n[Hums Note],\n\nand then\n\n♪ D, A, E, B, F sharp ♪\n\nis at the bottom, six o'clock.\n\nThen it goes\n\n♪ C sharp, ♪\n\n♪ A flat, E flat, B flat, F, C. ♪\n\nThat's the circle of fifths.\n\n[Hums Notes]\n\nI find this a really useful resource,\n\nbecause keys that are close\n\nto each other,\n\nlive in a kind of similar space.\n\nAnd chords that are far away\n\nfrom each other, have a very\n\ndifferent relationship,\n\nbut you can see some\n\nof those patterns very clearly\n\nEvery note is a fifth apart\n\nwhich is also, as you may have learned earlier,\n\na fourth, is the same thing.\n\nIt goes to say, it's a circle\n\nof fourths for all I care.\n\nHere's a very good question\n\nfrom Anthony Rice music.\n\nWhat's a music theory concept\n\nthat you find interesting?\n\n#music, #musictheory.\n\nOne music theory\n\nconcept that I find interesting\n\nthat I haven't already mentioned,\n\nswing percentage.\n\nIf you take a groove or a rhythm\n\n[Imitates Drumbeat]\n\nThen that is not swinging.\n\nIf I go\n\n[Imitates Rhythmic Drumming]\n\nthen that is swinging a little bit.\n\nIf I go\n\n[Imitates Rhythmic Drumming]\n\nthat's really swinging,\n\nthat's swinging really hard.\n\nSo there you go.\n\nThere's a music theory concept that I find interesting.\n\nAnd you may not find interesting.\n\nAnd I don't mind.\n\nHere's an absolute classic question\n\nfrom Janet Brooks.\n\nWhat's up Janet?\n\nwhat is the devil's interval,\n\nand why is it so evil?\n\nBack in the day, you know, sort of\n\ntalking a few hundred years ago, people thought\n\nthat an interval called the tritone\n\nwas very, very devilish and,\n\nand this is what it sounds like.\n\n[Dramatic Piano Note]\n\nNo, I'm just joking.\n\nIt sounds like this.\n\n[Somber Piano Note]\n\nHere's another one. [Somber Piano Note]\n\nHere's another one. [Somber Piano Note]\n\nHere's another one. [Somber Piano Note]\n\nHere's another one. [Somber Piano Note]\n\nAnother one. [Somber Piano Note]\n\nHere's one. [Series Of Somber Piano Notes]\n\nThe tritone, by nature is\n\nnot resolved at all.\n\nIt's very uncomfortable to stay here.\n\n[Series Of Somber Piano Notes]\n\nIt's called a tritone,\n\nbecause it's three tones added together.\n\nAnd in the USA, you would say it's a whole step,\n\nbut here in the UK, we would say a tone,\n\na tone is this distance.\n\nSo you've got tone, tone, and tone.\n\nThree tones added together,\n\nis a tritone.\n\nGoing back to say, you know, the 1500s or so,\n\nthere wasn't really a good use\n\nfor this interval because a lot\n\nof the music that was written there\n\nwas built out of fourths and fifths.\n\n[Piano Notes]\n\nRight?\n\nThe idea of doing this\n\n[Somber Piano Note]\n\nwas completely insane.\n\nAnd so it was such a dissonant sound\n\nwith no context that all people could say\n\nwas this must be Satan.\n\nThis is the devil speaking through music\n\nIn jazz, we like dissonance,\n\nand it's really interesting.\n\n[Jazzy Piano Music And Singing]\n\nDevil, devil, devil, devil,\n\ndevil, devil, devil, devil.\n\n[Jazzy Piano Music]\n\nHere's an excellent question from Janet Brooks,\n\nI think this is the second question from you, Janet.\n\nI'm glad you're asking so many good questions.\n\nHow do you change a C major chord\n\ninto a C minor chord?\n\nI've been there.\n\nLet me tell you, I've been there.\n\nWell, I think we've all been there.\n\nI've got a C major chord\n\n[Piano Chord Plays]\n\nI just think, I want this to be C minor.\n\nAnd it's a very, very simple equation to solve.\n\nYou take the E, and you weigh her down.\n\n[Piano Note Flattening]\n\nOne, two, three,\n\n[Piano Note Flattening]\n\nThat's a minor chord.\n\nJust make that third slightly flatter.\n\nPut some weights on it, you know,\n\ngive it some luggage or something. Yeah.\n\nHere is a more practical question from KK.\n\nWhat do the piano pedals do?\n\nA piano has normally three pedals.\n\nThe pedal on the right\n\nwhich is a bit like the sort of an accelerator.\n\nYou could say the gas pedal,\n\nthat one is called the sustain pedal.\n\nAnd so when I play lots of notes\n\n[Bright Individual Piano Notes]\n\nwith no pedals pressed down,\n\nthey are, what's called staccato.\n\n[Staccato Beatboxed Notes]\n\nthey're short.\n\n[Bright Staccato Piano Notes]\n\nIf I put the pedal down, so sustain pedal down,\n\n[Lengthened Piano Notes]\n\nthey sustain\n\n[Sustained Piano Notes]\n\nAnd I'm going to lift the pedal,\n\nthey cease sustaining.\n\nThat means I can go\n\n[Glissando]\n\nand all the notes ring,\n\nand when I released the pedal,\n\nthey all stop.\n\nIt's kind of like magic.\n\nSo then there's a pedal on the left of the three,\n\nis usually what's called a soft pedal.\n\nAnd what the soft pedal does,\n\nis it makes all the notes just slightly quieter.\n\nAnd this is good, say if you have like\n\nsensitive roommates,\n\nor it's just very late,\n\nor you're just not in the mood\n\nfor making loud noise.\n\nNow the pedal in the middle,\n\nI know of two uses of this pedal.\n\nOne is what's called the sostenuto pedal.\n\nI play a chord,\n\n[Plays Piano Chord]\n\nI hit the sostenuto pedal,\n\nand only those notes are sustained,\n\nand around those notes,\n\nI can actually still\n\nplay staccato notes, right,\n\nwhich is kind of fun because it means\n\nthat certain notes will sustain\n\nand certain notes won't sustain.\n\nAnd you can change that chord all the time.\n\nSo it's almost like a sort of halfway sustain pedal where\n\nyou choose which notes you would like to sustain.\n\nThe other use of the middle pedal,\n\nsometimes you have upright pianos\n\nlike the one that I have at home,\n\nis the mute pedal.\n\nAnd so I have a bit of felt\n\ninside of my piano at home.\n\nThat goes [Muffling Sound]\n\nwhen you put the middle pedal down,\n\nand when you lift it up, [Unmuffled Sound]\n\nthen it comes off.\n\nAnd that bit of felt, it makes it sound really,\n\nreally warm.\n\nIt's like you put a blanket over all the,\n\nwell you literally do put a blanket\n\nbetween the hammers and the strings.\n\nSo when you play, it goes\n\n[Mimics Playing Muffled Piano]\n\nInstead of\n\n[Mimics Loud Piano] It goes\n\n[Mimics Muffled Piano]\n\nand there's a really beautiful\n\nkind of softness about that sound.\n\nExcellent question here next up from Richard Jerrett,\n\nblue heart.\n\nWhat's the difference between three, four and\n\nsix, eight time?\n\nThere are different ways\n\nin which you can divide time and\n\nspace within music.\n\nNow, there's actually a lot in common\n\nbetween three, four and six, eight,\n\nbecause three, four, and six, eight\n\ntake up the same amount of time.\n\nIf you're good at maths\n\nyou would've already noticed that.\n\nThe main difference\n\nbetween these two time signatures is\n\nwhere the emphasis is.\n\nSo with three, four\n\nthere's an emphasis that happens thrice within that space.\n\nOne, two, three, one, two, three.\n\nAnd with six, eight, the emphasis happens twice.\n\n[Beatboxes In Six, Eight]\n\nWaltzes, right?\n\nAny fans of waltzes amongst the listeners?\n\nLeave a comment below.\n\nWaltzes are in three, four, famously.\n\nIf I go,\n\n[Sings And Plays Waltz Music On Piano]\n\nAnd what's a good example of six, eight?\n\nThere's a tune called my bonny lies over the ocean.\n\n♪ My bonny lies over the ocean, ♪\n\n♪ So bring back my bonny to me ♪\n\n♪ Bring back, bring back, oh bring back ♪\n\n♪ My bonny to me, to me, ♪\n\n[Beatboxed Notes]\n\nThat's six, eight, and it's like a cradle.\n\n[Imitates Drums]\n\nSo, thank you Lenny,\n\nand I hope that helps in your\n\nrhythmic quandary.\n\nHere's an interesting question from Nick Berry,\n\nwhy are the black and white keys\n\non a piano keyboard spread the way they are?\n\nI don't really know,\n\nI'm not exactly sure why.\n\nBut I guess I'd say that\n\nall of these notes are naturals.\n\nYou see, C natural, D natural, E natural,\n\nbut you got E flat, or D flat, or F sharp.\n\nThese are different versions\n\nof these natural notes\n\nand all the sharps and flats,\n\nthose are the black keys.\n\nSo you've got the naturals,\n\nand you've got the sharps and the flats,\n\nThe sharps and the flats are always\n\nthe most interesting notes\n\nbecause they really add stuff.\n\nThey add color, they add interest,\n\nthey add motion.\n\nSo, it's laid out where a tonality\n\nin its basic form is the white notes.\n\nAnd then the black notes are all\n\nof the kind of tributaries\n\nthat lead out of that tonality.\n\nHere's a question from Trak Doe,\n\nTrak Doe,\n\nand the question is,\n\ndoes music theory matter anymore?\n\nI would say the short answer\n\nto this question, does music matter anymore,\n\nis I don't know if it ever really mattered.\n\nI don't know if anything really matters, actually.\n\n[Chuckles]\n\nBut I think that as a musician,\n\nthe more options you have to intuit through or with,\n\nthe more interesting your pallette is.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing to be ashamed of,\n\nzoning into the things you like\n\nand trying to understand them in more detail.\n\nSo, yeah. Does music theory matter anymore?\n\nSure, it does, but nothing really matters.\n\nSo I wouldn't take it too seriously.\n\nHope you're having a good time.\n\n[Short Glissando]\n\nThis is a question from Joe Weisenthal.\n\nDo different keys,\n\npresuming the modes stay the same,\n\nhave distinct characteristics?\n\nLike, is there any other objective difference\n\nbetween A, C, F sharp, et cetera,\n\nbesides higher or lower?\n\nJoe, that's a great question.\n\nThe short answer is yes.\n\nEvery key has a different characteristic\n\nfrom every other key.\n\nOne of the joys of traversing\n\nthe world of music is changing keys.\n\nAt least that,\n\nso you can quote me on that,\n\nthat's one of my favorite things to do.\n\nIf you take a different frequency,\n\nyou know, take A,\n\n[Piano Harmony]\n\n♪ Somewhere over the rainbow ♪\n\n♪ Way up high ♪\n\nThat has a different feeling from,\n\n♪ Somewhere over the rainbow ♪\n\n♪ Way up high ♪\n\nYeah. It's different, different vibe.\n\nEvery key is a new world.\n\nAnd so the more ways you have\n\nof changing key and opening doors into new keys,\n\nthe more exciting it is\n\nto be a human on planet earth.\n\nLadies and gents, that concludes this session.\n\nThank you for such brilliant questions.\n\nI hope that I've been remotely helpful.\n\nIt's been wicked fun, answering them all,\n\nand it's made me think on my feet,\n\nwhich is great.\n\nThanks for sticking around.\n\nLet's do this again sometime.\n\nCatch you later."
