        "text": "Mustard Crashes Out While Talking Album Sales\n\nMustard then accused Drake of using bots to boost the streaming numbers of his Gordo songs. He even tied it back in to his insult about Malcolm X. \"These Drake bots are the Nation of drizzlam,\" the producer wrote. He also tagged Akademiks and Gordo to make sure they saw what he had to say. The tweets kept coming. \"The bots tryna fade me,\" Mustard tweeted. He then dug it in his heels and called Ak and the 6 God racists. \"Album sales are a form of white supremacy,\" he wrote. \"You n**gas racist.\" The sales that Mustard is referring to does, admittedly, favor Gordo. Gordo's album sold 20K during its first week, and Mustard's only pulled in 18K. Not a huge discrepancy, but enough for the L.A. producer to get heated.\n\nMustard's frustrations may have something to do with the personal nature of his album. He was clear about the fact that FAITH OF A MUSTARD SEED was his most revealing release yet. He even decided to rap on the outro, as a means of putting more of himself in the music than ever. I started feeling like the records were becoming more soulful-leaning,\" he told XXL. \"It just kind of reminded me of like, me being a kid and different parts of Los Angeles.\" We're going to assume he didn't like DIAMANTE based on his comments."
