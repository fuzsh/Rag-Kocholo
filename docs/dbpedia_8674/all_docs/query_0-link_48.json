The two rappers initially got together in 2018, and ended up calling it quits in March of 2021. The ex CB is referring to that Quavo slept with is most likely Chris' ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran. Quavo and her were dating each other in the past.\n\n\"You f**ked my ex-h*e/that's cool, I don't give no f**k, lil n***a,\" Chris Brown raps. \"’Cause I f**ked yo' ex when you were still with her, b***h/I'm up, lil n***a.\"\n\nAfter likely hearing the track, Saweetie posted a picture on X of social media personality Tim Bae smirking while holding a blunt. Next to the photo, the 30-year-old rapper typed \"let me go rewrite these nani verses.\" The tweet can be seen below.\n\nRead More: Read More: Chris Brown Disses Quavo on New Track\n\nChris Brown and Quavo Takes Lyrical Jabs at Each Other\n\nLast week, Chris Brown and Quavo took digs at each other in their latest songs.
