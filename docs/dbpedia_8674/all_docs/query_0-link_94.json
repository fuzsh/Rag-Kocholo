        "text": "Another day, another drama with our favorite celebrities! Cardi B recently has been getting dragged on X (Formerly known as Twitter) by online influencer Paradise Paris for not taking criticism on her work as an artist. As we all know, Cardi B never backs down from an opportunity to drag someone on social media (well, her and Nicki Minaj). She clapped back at Paris, starting this long Twitter war, going back and forth on whether Cardi is a failure of an artist who hasn't been putting out albums as much as she's been getting into drama for her ex-husband's cheating scandals.\n\nParis' Thoughts\n\nNobody is immune from criticism, whether you're a regular person on the street or Jeff Bezos. However, how you word that criticism and how you respond to it matters. The situation started when Joe Budden, an American media personality and broadcaster, predicted that Cardi would not release another album soon.\n\nCardi got mad and said, \"Bro I gave you a lap dance two times in Starlets. You was high as fk. High as fk on coke, nia… I don't give a fk when people talk sht about me. It's the fact you always talk sht about me, Joe Budden. Out of nowhere, you would think I did something to this nia. For the past two years, this nia has only talked bad things about me.\"\n\nThen she compared herself to other female artists, saying, \"Every five or six months you comparing another female rapper towards me, you compare new artists, old artists, every single fking artist with me, bro,\" she said. \"If you love these bies so much, why are you not talking about their album? You compare females to me that my worst records beat their best records. I don't give a fk about none of these bihes.\" Joe denied all the claims that Cardi made.\n\nPhoto by Williana Serve\n\nYou would think the drama would calm down after that right? Nope! The drama starts to heat up when Paris, the woman who's known for reading people to absolute filth tweets out this:\n\n(Disclaimer: The tweets from Cardi B have now been deleted on her side after being up for less than 24 hours. You can find them by looking on TikTok or other social media platforms from people who managed to screenshot the tweets before they were deleted.) Cardi responded, \"That's not what I said …. Fuk YOU AND YOUR 3 STOMACHS btch.\" Paris saw this tweet and stood ten toes down on business, ready to go into this argument with Cardi. She tweets this, attaching a video dragging Cardi for not having any records that can't even stay on the charts for more than 24 hours. She also proceeds to call her out on her martial trouble and how that's been affecting her music:\n\nCardi B Has Had Enough\n\nCardi B responded by saying, \"When I do surgery baby I don't do it for a nia. I do it cause I love the vixen look. I got my a and my soft a** tiies before I met set (aka Offset). The fact that you b*tches always wanna bring up a man for a drag because you can't drag nothing else is not a gag cause nias is line up on the DM…You spoke on me and now you mad cause your stomachs is layered like a WEDDING CAKE.\" She continued on by posting a photo of someone's hands grabbing her bare chest, saying, \"Talking bout hard a** tiies…it never gave HARD…They always in a mouth btch you shape like a gummy bear...You flinstone vitamin shape btch… You h*es love surgery. I'd rather die on a table than look like you.\" Paris responded with this:\n\nCardi said, \"Shape like a what? Baby since high school my body was skinny bitty it was always tea. Teeth was stacked like your 3 stomachs.\n\nThen you wanna talk about tongue like you don't have a heavy tongue yourself.\" Paris responded, \"And You look a mess still they look terrible. You tried to make it seem like my opinion [was] invalid cause of my looks. It wasn't about a nia. You sat there and tried to be funny and you mad cuz everybody keep critiquing you being a failure with a number 1 album.\" Cardi said, \"This is why you hes gotta bring my marriage as a drag cause how you sound a failure wit a number 1 album? 🤨 Yea the album that haven't been passed in 6 years by no female soo fuk YOU!!! Y'all can't talk bout [censored] else.\" Paris said in response:\n\nCardi B said, \"Let me make it very clear for you baby girl when you STILL GETTING OFFERS LIKE THIS in 2024 wit ONE ALBUM after 7 years I don't have to compare myself to my peers that's what a insecure bicha* that don't know they spot in the game. So get your feet done you know I hate it when you bummy.\" She proceeded to attach screenshots of text messages getting concert gigs and opportunities to do shows, then added a photo of Paris' feet from one of her previous posts for good measure. Paris said:\n\nCardi B responded again, saying, \"This coming from a bich name Paradise Paris that never been to a paradise or a paris …please. My relevancy is for a potential album?? Isn't that what I'm supposed to be relevant for? A album that EVERYBODY wants me to drop.\n\nThat's actually an amazing thing that biches would kill for. And \"according to analysis, \".. you mean billboard? The same ones that did a whole article about how I boost the sales for every record I get on? Cuz that's what THEY said not me. Talking about I got comfortable like you not comfortable settling working at Marshall's. And why you wanna keep bringing up my marriage ho ain't this you?\" Paris said:\n\nCardi finally finished this argument with “I lost?? Lost what?? Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up in my mansion with breakfast cooked by my chef, a career, and beautiful kids. You're gonna wake up with 3 pillows under your dress ready to clock in at Marshall's and being the highlight of your life. YOU LOST BTCH.” Paris continue responding to the public's opinion on the matter over the span of many retweets and replies, one of the notable ones being:\n\nWhat Does Everyone Think?\n\nNeedless to say, this war has been spanning across many tweets in only one to two days. Cardi B addressed her actions after deleting her tweets, saying, “I wanna say this to Bardi gang or anybody who’s just a fan of my music or even my craziness… I have my good days and my bad days, but you know what, whether it’s good or bad I couldn’t be happier with the obvious anticipation for my album..Sometimes I get a little aggressive because yall know I don’t like to be told what to do but I promise you it’s coming THIS YEAR. Thank you for the love and anticipation and always holding me down ❤️ I love yall.”\n\nParis was not having it, though, when she ended Cardi once and for all, saying, “This is such a pss poor way of lacking accountability because you could have addressed my initial tweet like this instead of trying to get a fake a** drag going body for body! You’re a nasty btch with a filthy moral standing and you better pray you can survive the media lashings of this upcoming album.” She also said, “Got a rap btch shook up cuz she dont know what to do with herself. Not my fault you dck riding and can’t maintain consistency.” and “ Waking up rich dont make you a winner. Crypto currency billionaire just committed sucide and Cardi done threatened it twice. What we doing?”\n\nThe overall consensus is that Paris clocked Cardi B so badly, and a lot of people are clowning Cardi for it. Some of these tweets say:\n\nAnd these are just some of tweets that talk about this whole situation… Let me know what you think about this whole thing in the comments!"
