        "text": "I feel your pain - I've had that happen too, on every music subscription service I've been on (which is basically ALL of them - Spotify, Rhapsody, Zune, Xbox Music Pass).\n\nBut there's really no way a company can legally \"stop letting artists and outhouse lawyers\" tell them what to do - Spotify doesn't own publishing rights on these songs, the artists and the publishing corporations who hire the lawyers do. If Spotify ignored legal requests to stop streaming music that they didn't have the right to stream, then Spotify would be sued out of existence in a week, and NONE of your playlists would work anymore.\n\nBUT: as @Mickey82 points out, sometimes the same material can be re-downloaded almost immediately; also, I've noticed (from having multiple overlapping music subscriptions at times) that sometimes, particular content won't be available on one service, but will be available on the others. These don't feel like publishing decisions to me (though I'm not a music publisher...) I can understand an artist/publisher saying \"No streaming at all!\" - many do. I can understand an artist/publisher making an exclusive streaming deal with one provider, and I'm sure some do.\n\nBut given the choice of (a) an artist explicitly deciding to allow his tunes to be streamed on all services EXCEPT one; or (b) a database error that makes it look like permissions changed, well, (b) seems way more likely.\n\nCLEARLY it's sometimes the result of an error - I've reported instances to all four services that I suspected were data bugs, and most of them got resolved, presumably by DBAs and not lawyers.\n\nAnd again, ALL the music subscription services have these issues - I have no idea how complicated it is to track the legal intricacies of millions of songs, but I bet it's WAY more complicated than I could imagine it to be. But the default way they all handle them (\"That's just the way subscription services work, publishers are whimsical and capricious\") is unfortunate. Admitting to a data bug might undermine customer confidence in the app or the service, but the default explanation undermines confidence in the entire business model, which is way worse. (When an airline has a crash, they don't just shrug and say \"Eh, air travel is inherently unsafe\" - they say, \"Here's what happened, here's why it happened, here's the steps we're taking so it will never happen again.\")\n\nMy fond wish for this (and maybe it's impossible, but I bet it's only hard) is that the subscription services would find a way to distinguish between a real publishing take-down request and a data bug - and surface that information to someone who could act on it. Maybe someday..."
