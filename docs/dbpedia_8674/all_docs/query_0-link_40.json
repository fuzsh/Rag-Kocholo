        "text": "The country music world has been hit hard by tragedy so far in 2024.\n\nWANT MORE COUNTRY MUSIC NEWS? CLICK HERE.\n\nFrom legendary performers such as Toby Keith to major players behind the scenes, the genre has lost some big-time names that won’t ever be replaced.\n\nCountry music legend’s wife fears for safety if fans learn value of his estate\n\nThese country music stars are saying farewell this year\n\nCountry music stars battling serious heart issues\n\nThe list of those gone in 2024 recently grew to 24. The following is a look at those that we have lost thus far this year:\n\nNorah Lee Allen\n\nIt has been an emotional year for The Oak Ridge Boys, and things took a particularly heartbreaking turn on Easter.\n\nAccording to Taste of Country, Norah Lee Allen, the wife of lead singer Duane Allen, died Sunday morning after battling an illness for “an extended period of time.” The site reported that she had been at Vanderbilt Hospital when she died.\n\nAllen reportedly shared the news on social media Sunday.\n\n“This morning, my wife of 54 years and 8 months took her last breath of air on planet Earth,” he wrote. “Norah Lee went to be with Jesus at 7:28 am, Easter morning. She had not been feeling well for some time. Her family all spent the night with her last night at Vanderbilt Hospital. We took time singing with and to her, telling her stories, and loving her every second that God let us share her here on this Earth.”\n\nThe Grand Ole Opry took time to remember Allen, too.\n\n“During (Wednesday’s show), we paused to remember a beloved member of our Opry family we lost earlier this week, Norah Lee Allen,” a post on the Opry’s X page, formerly Twitter, read. “For decades, Norah Lee added her voice to Opry performances as one of our background vocalists, our Opry Singers.\n\n“She was also a member of our family as the wife of Duane Allen of Opry group The Oak Ridge Boys,” the post continued. “She will be lovingly remembered by all who knew her and all who knew her voice here at the Grand Ole Opry.”\n\nJoe Bonsall\n\nThe country music world is sending its prayers to The Oak Ridge Boys after longtime member Joe Bonsall died in July.\n\nBonsall, who was 76, passed away due to complications from Amyotrophic Lateral Scleroris (ALS).\n\nThe band shared an obit post to its X, formerly Twitter, account announcing his death.\n\n“As a 50-year member of the American music group The Oak Ridge Boys, Joe was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and the prestigious Country Music Hall of Fame,” the post read.\n\nYou can see that post and the responses here.\n\nHeartbroken fans were quick to respond with prayers and well-wishes.\n\n“Sincerely so sorry to hear,” one person wrote. “Have seen the Oaks many times through the years, and Joe always gave an amazing performance. Was funny and engaged the audience. Seriously saddened by this. RIP and condolences to his family.”\n\n“My sincerest thoughts and prayers for the band and family he’ll surely be missed,” he continued. “We know he’s in heaven singing his heart out.”\n\n“My heart is broken,” another wrote. “Prayers for his family, brothers in music, and all of those that loved him. #RIPJoeBonsall.”\n\nBonsall retired from touring with the band in January.\n\n“I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road,” he reportedly said. “It has just gotten too difficult. It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys band crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I think you and ask for you to keep on praying.”\n\nHe returned to social media to address fans after that initial announcement.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the love shown to me this week,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I think I have heard from everyone I have ever known and many many more …. Thank you doesn’t seem adequate … but THANK YOU.”\n\nFran Boyd\n\nFran Boyd, a country music groundbreaker and champion of the genre, died earlier this month.\n\nShe was 84.\n\nBillboard wrote that she died on March 9. The site said that Boyd “played a key role in shaping and advancing the (Academy of Country Music) from its early years in California in the late 1960s, through the start of the millennium.”\n\nBoyd was reportedly the first paid employee of the ACM, coming onboard in 1968 as executive secretary. She worked her way all the way up to executive director. Per Billboard, she “oversaw nearly every aspect of the annual (ACM) awards” show.\n\nShe worked for the ACM for more than three decades before retiring in 2002.\n\nThe Academy of Country Music posted on X, formerly Twitter, regarding Boyd’s death.\n\nYou can see that post, here.\n\n“Fran Boyd played an essential part in the Academy’s history, stretching way back to the 1960s and steering the ship through decades of change, innovation, and growth, all while fostering an incredible passion for country music,” Gayle Holcomb, ACM Board Sergeant-At-Arms told Billboard. “Fran will always be remembered as a champion for our industry, its artists, and this organization. On behalf of the ACM Officers and Board of Directors, I send our gratitude, prayers and condolences to the Boyd family.”\n\nDon Cason\n\nSinger, hit songwriter, producer and author Buzz Cason died in June.\n\nHe was 84. No cause of death was reported.\n\n“Buzz Cason never concerned himself too much with musical boundaries,” Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum CEO Kyle Young said. “He just lived and breathed music. As a singer, songwriter, producer, and publisher, he helped shape and expand the sound of Nashville in countless ways across seven decades.”\n\nCason’s career in music began in the 1960s when he helped found The Casuals, known as Nashville’s first rock band. He then pursued a solo career and went on to sing backup vocals for the likes of Elvis Presley, Kenny Rogers, John Denver and Roy Orbison, according to Taste of Country.\n\nAs a songwriter and producer he combined with the likes of Dolly Parton, the Oak Ridge Boys, Martina McBride, Mel Tillis and Jimmy Buffett. His biggest hit song, “Everlasting Love,” was co-written with Mac Gayden. Taste of Country said that song is one of the few to make the Billboard Hot 100 in four consecutive decades.\n\nLarry Collins\n\nLarry Collins, a former country music child star turned legendary guitarist and song writer, died on Jan. 5.\n\nHe was 79. Per reports, Collins died of natural causes.\n\nHe first made his splash in country music alongside his older sister, Lorrie, when they formed the “The Collins Kids” duo when Larry was just 9 years old. They recorded a series of hits — “Hop, Skip and Kump,” “Hoy Hoy,” and “Beetle Bug Bop” — with music catering to children. The became regulars on “Town Hall Party” in 1954 and they performed together into the 60s.\n\nPer reports, Lorrie had her first child in 1961 and stepped away from music to focus on family. The duo did reunite years later in the 90s.\n\nWhile Lorrie, who died in 2018, focused on building her family, Larry moved on to a solo career where he made, perhaps, his biggest mark as a songwriter. He is credited as the co-writer for “Delta Dawn,” which became Tanya Tucker’s first hit song among other songs.\n\nAllison Cornell\n\nAllison Cornell died in February.\n\nShe was a part of Shania Twain’s band for years.\n\n“Allison Cornell was such a talented and wonderful person,” Twain wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “It was a privilege, as an artist, to have her on stage with me through a lot of my touring career. Feeling very sad. Allison’s memory will live on but sadly another beautiful human has gone too soon. Rest in Peace (heart emoji).”\n\nA post on Cornell’s artist management page also addressed her death.\n\n“It is with great sadness that we say farewell to Allison Shropshire Cornell,” the post began. “Rest in Peace. Heaven has opened up its gates to an incredible talent!”\n\nGene Elders\n\nGene Elders, a longtime fiddle player in Country Music Hall of Famer George Strait’s legendary Ace in the Hole Band, has died.\n\nNo cause of death has been reported.\n\nIt was the second heartbreaking death to rock Strait in a day’s time after his manager, Erv Woolsey, also passed away.\n\n“Hard to believe we lost two of our music family members on the same day,” Strait posted on X, formerly Twitter. “Our Ace in the Hole treasured band member Gene Elders passed away yesterday afternoon shortly after we lost Erv. All of our prayers go out to both families. We loved him so much.”\n\nElders’ website said he played in Strait’s band since 1984. It said he also played in Lyle Lovett’s Large Band for 11 years, and also played on recordings for Joan Baez, Lucinda Williams and Dan Fogelberg.\n\nFans took to social media following the news to remember Elders.\n\n“I’ve been fortunate enough to watch Gene Elders play that haunting fiddle outro on ‘Amarillo By Morning’ live several times,” one person wrote. “The arena goes dark except for a long spotlight on Gene, it sends chills every time. RIP Gene Elders.”\n\n“Today was a devastating day for the Strait camp,” another person wrote. “Our hearts are hurting. Rest in Peace Gene Elders. Rest in Peace Erv Woolsey. We will miss you both.”\n\nTom Foote\n\nGeorge Strait revealed in may that a member of his operation had died for the third time this year.\n\nThe latest death was Tom Foote, a former drummer for Strait’s Ace in the Hole band and the singer’s longtime road manager.\n\nThe singer announced the death on Tuesday on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“We lost another one of our good friends and a huge part of our musical journey yesterday,” Strait wrote. “Tom Foote, our one-time drummer and long-time road manager for around 48 years, suddenly passed away at his home after our rehearsal. The band and I were with him most of the afternoon, and he was great. Just doing what he loved to do which was making sure we were taken care of. 2024 is taking its toll on the Ace in the Hole group. We’re all heartbroken to say the least. Rest in peace brother Tom. You will be hugely missed. I’ll see you down the road amigo.”\n\nFoote was reportedly the drummer for a band that hired Strait to be its new singer back in 1975. That band eventually became the Ace in hte Hole Band. He reportedly stayed on as drummer through 1983 when he moved into his role as road manager.\n\n“So sorry to hear this,” one person responded to Strait. “Prayers for peace and comfort!”\n\n“My prayers for his family and yours,” another wrote.\n\n“I’m so sorry about your (loss),” another wrote. “This year has really been a trying year for you and your group king George. My prayers are with you all. Hold on … keeping playing that true country music. Your long time fans love it. Prayers going up.”\n\nAnd there were plenty more responses like that. You can see them here.\n\nFoote’s death comes after Gene Elders, a longtime fiddle player in Strait’s Ace in the Hole Band, and Erv Woolsey, his manager, both died within a day of one another back in March.\n\nKinky Friedman\n\nKinky Friedman was a legend, and if you don’t believe it, just check the headlines.\n\nFriedman, 79, died Thursday. He had reportedly been battling Parkinson’s disease for years.\n\nHe was a country music singer. He ran to be the governor of Texas. He wrote books. He wrote songs. He was a satirist. One story described him as a “rabble rouser.”\n\nAnd his name … well, the guy was unique.\n\n“Kinky Friedman stepped on a rainbow at his beloved Echo Hill surrounded by family & friends,” a post to his X, formerly Twitter account, said on Thursday. “Kinkster endured tremendous pain and unthinkable loss in recent years but he never lost his fighting spirit and quick wit. Kinky will live on as his books are read and his songs are sung.”\n\nA close friend of Friedman’s, Kent Perkins, told The Associated Press that he “died peacefully.”\n\n“He smoked a cigar, went to bed and never woke up,” he said.\n\nPerkins called Friedman “the last free person on earth.”\n\n“He had an irreverence about him,” he said. “He was a fearless writer.”\n\nAs a performer he toured with the likes of Bob Dylan.\n\nHe put out 18 albums, the first coming in 1973 and the last dropping in 2018.\n\nWilliam “Rusty” Golden\n\nWilliam “Rusty” Golden, the son of legendary Oak Ridge Boys performer William Lee Golden, died on July 1.\n\nHe was 65.\n\nHe died at his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, according to a press release shared by the band.\n\n“This is the hardest thing ever for a father to have to face,” William Lee Golden said in the release. “I love my family more than anything. Rusty was a great musician, a talented songwriter, and a wonderful son. We appreciate your thoughts and prayers for the days ahead. I love you, son.”\n\nRusty Golden followed in his father’s footsteps as a musician, singer and songwriter. He even earned an RIAA Gold record as a songwriter on The Oak Ridge Boys’ Bobbie Sue album.\n\nHe moved into gospel music later in life after undergoing a quadruple bypass.\n\nWilliam Lee Golden also posted on his X account, formerly Twitter, about his son’s death.\n\n“We thank you all for your love and support of Rusty over the years and kindly ask for privacy for our family during this difficult time,” he wrote.\n\nYou can read more about his life and accolades here.\n\nWayland Holyfield\n\nWayland Holyfield might not be a name that most country music fans know, but that probably should not be the case.\n\nBecause the guy was an icon.\n\nHolyfield died on Monday, according to multiple reports. He was 82.\n\nSo, what made Holyfield so iconic in the country music world?\n\nWell, the guy was one of the greatest songwriters the genre has ever seen. Holyfield helped write 14 No. 1 hits and had more than 40 songs reach the Top 10 during his time, according to Taste of Country.\n\nThe site said Holyfield wrote songs for some of country music’s most legendary performers including George Strait, George Jones, the Judds, Brooks & Dunn, Randy Travis, Reba McEntire, Waylon Jennings, Conway Twitty “and many more.”\n\n“Wayland Holyfield — who died May 6 — wrote sons of unflagging devotion, including the Don Williams hit “You’re My Best Friend” and Anne Murray’s “Could I Have this Dance,” the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “Holyfield was devoted to his wife, to the craft of songwriting, and to advocating for the rights of his peers.”\n\nMark James\n\nMark James, a legendary songwriter and hitmaker, died on June 8.\n\nHe was 83.\n\nJames, who was a Houston native, died on June 8 at his home in Nashville.\n\nJames won a pair of Grammys in 1983 for his “Always on My Mind,” which was performed by Willie Nelson. He also wrote the hits, “Hooked on a Feeling,” and “Suspicious Minds.” He is a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\n“Mark’s legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him; and through his timeless lyrics and melodies that have been the soundtrack of lovers for generations,” his family said according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAlong with being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, he was also named by BMI as one of the Songwriters of the Century for 2000. He is also a member of the Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame, the New York Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, according to the Hollywood Observer.\n\nAlong with Nelson, James wrote hits for the likes of Elvis Presley, B.J. Thomas and Brenda Lee.\n\nToby Keith\n\nToby Keith died on Feb. 5 following a battle with stomach cancer.\n\nHe was 62.\n\nIt was tragic news, especially, for a man who battled so bravely such a horrible disease, but if there’s any solace to be found for his fans, it could be in some of his final words. Because, in his final days, Keith sat down with News 9 in Oklahoma to talk about his journey.\n\nHe was noticeably thinner as he talked about battling cancer, gave his thoughts on dying and, yes, even talked about death.\n\nHe called cancer a “long dark hallway,” but he also approached the subject in a way that only a man at complete peace could. And that is something he pinned on faith.\n\n“You take it for granted on the days that things are good, and you lean on it when days are bad,” he said. “It has taught me to lean on it a little more every day.”\n\nAnd that is when Keith talked about thinking about, at times, the possibility that he might die.\n\n“I was going through all the chemo, radiation, surgery, and I got to the point where I was comfortable with whatever happened,” he said. “I had my brain wrapped around it, and I was in a good spot either way.”\n\nThat, he said, was a point that people with faith are not able to so easily get to.\n\nSo, if there is any comfort in news like this, perhaps it is that Keith had faith. And, mentally, he was prepared and comforted by his faith.\n\nDave Loggins\n\nDave Loggins, a Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter who wrote songs for some of the biggest names in music, died in July.\n\nHe was 76. No cause of death has been reported.\n\nAs a singer, Loggins was best known for his 1974 hit, “Please Come to Boston,” which reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 that year. It was the first of his four Grammy nominations.\n\nHe is also known for “Augusta,” which is the theme song for the Masters golf tournament.\n\nWhile he was a talented singer, Billboard called him “one of the most prolific songwriters of his generation.”\n\nThe site noted that Loggins wrote for the likes of Johnny Cash, Roby Keith, Wynonna Judd, Ray Charles, Smokey Robinson, Reba McEntire, Tanya Tucker, Kenny Rogers and Willie Nelson.\n\n“I just heard about the passing of Dave Loggins,” Lee Greenwood wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Dave was an incredible singer, guitar player, and a writer. It was his music that drew me to Nashville, Tennessee in 1979. Dave was from Bristol, TN, but he made the world know who he was by the songs he wrote and sang. We will miss his great talent, but his songs will live forever. We send prayers of healing and comfort to the Loggins family. I’m the number one fan of the man from Tennessee.”\n\nMary Martin\n\nMary Martin might not be a name that the average country music fan would know, but it should be because she had a major influence on the industry.\n\nThe manager and executive, who helped create stars in the genre, died on July 4.\n\nShe was 85.\n\nTime and again, Mary Martin spotted great talents and elevated their careers,” Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum CEO Kyle Young said in a statement posted to Instagram. “Early on, she connected Bob Dylan to her friends the Hawks, who became the Band. She managed Leonard Cohen in his first musical outings, the guided the budding solo careers of Van Morrison, Rodney Crowell, and Vince Gill. At Warner Bros., she signed future Country Music Hall of Fame member Emmylou Harris, at RCA she helped sign and develop Clint Black and Lorrie Morgan, and she encouraged a young Keith Urban to move from Australia to Nashville. Mary’s unerring feel for songs and performers was legendary, and she was a fierce ally for the artists she represented.”\n\n“The greatest lady in music you probably never heard about,” one person responded. “Half of the people represented in my music collection probably benefited from her insight, intelligence and uncanny musical sense.”\n\nMojo Nixon\n\nThe headline in Rolling Stone called Mojo Nixon an “unabashed outlaw cult hero,” and if you dig into the story you quickly find out that’s just about a perfect way to sum the guy up.\n\nNixon was one heckuva interesting guy.\n\nHe died on Feb. 7 at the age of 66, and even how he went was out of the ordinary. He was a host aboard the Outlaw Country Cruise and his family said he suffered a “cardiac event,” that took his life.\n\n“How you should live is how you should die,” the family told Rolling Stone. “Mojo Nixon was full-tilt, wide-open rock hard, root hog, corner on two wheels + on fire. Passing after a blazing show, a raging night, closing the bar, taking no prisoners + a good breakfast with bandmates and friends.\n\n“A cardiac event on the Outlaw Country Cruise is about right… & that’s just how he did it, Mojo has left the building,” they added. “Since Elvis is everywhere, we know he was waiting for him in the alley out back. Heaven help us all.”\n\nRolling Stone wrote that Nixon “enjoyed a supremely weird yet singular career.”\n\nHis big break came in 1987 with his hit novelty song “Elvis is Everywhere,” that became a regular on MTV.\n\nHe put out six albums alongside Skid Roper, and five more solo projects. He also served as a DJ for SiriusXM’s Outlaw Country for years, too.\n\nSandy Posey\n\nBeloved country music and pop singer Sandy Posey died in July.\n\nShe was 80.\n\nShe reportedly died at her home on Saturday in Tennessee after a battle with dementia.\n\nHer husband, Wade Cummins, told TMZ that she had “a slow decline over the past seven years.”\n\nHe told the site she was the love of his life.\n\nPosey was born in 1944 in Jasper, Alabama, and she began her career in 1965. She quickly turned out a string of hits including “Born a Woman” and “Single Girl.”\n\n“Born a Woman” reached the 12-spot on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1966 and sold over a million copies. “Single Girl” also reached the 12-spot on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1967.\n\nShe also recorded hits “What a Woman in Love Won’t Do,” “I Take It Back” and “Can’t Get Used to Sleeping Without You.”\n\nShe also did session work for Elvia Pressley and recorded with famed producer Billy Sherrill, according to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.\n\nJoe Scaife\n\nLegendary country music hitmaker Joe Scaife died in June, according to The Tennessean.\n\nHe was 68. No cause of death was given.\n\nAccording to Taste of Country, Scaife produced such hits as “Redneck Woman” by Gretchen Wilson, and Billy Ray Cyrus’ mega-hit, “Achy Breaky Heart.” The site said he also helped K.T. Oslin, Montgomery Gentry, Shania Twain and Toby Keith, among others, deliver hits.\n\nThe Tennessean said he helped deliver records that sold more than 80 million copies.\n\n“You were the coolest hang there ever was,” his daughter, Jaela Scaife Harris, wrote on Facebook. “Anyone who knows me know that there is no one in the world I love more than Joe Scaife. Words will never do him justice. He was the absolute coolest, most down to earth, incredible dad I could have ever asked for. I don’t know how I am going to make it without him, but I know he is going wide open on his boat in heaven. I love you so much daddy and I can’t wait to see you again. Happy first Father’s Day in Heaven.”\n\nYou can see her post here.\n\nIn a separate post she thanked everyone “who has helped us through this difficult time.”\n\n“There will be a celebration of life at a later date on Music Row,” she added.\n\nMargo Smith\n\nMargo Smith might not be a name that most young country music fans know, but if you Google her you will see “legend” right there next to her name.\n\nSadly, the headlines will also mention that she has died at the age of 84. According to multiple reports, Smith actually passed away on Tuesday, Jan. 23. A cause of death has not been reported.\n\nSmith was reportedly a kindergarten teacher in Ohio for around a decade before her career took off.\n\nKnown as “The Tennessee Yodeler,” she then churned out 18 studio albums between 1971 and 2005.\n\nSmith was named ASACP Country Artist of the Year in 1979 and won the CCMA Living Legend Award in 2001.\n\nThe Academy of Country Music tweeted Monday about her death.\n\n“Please join the Academy in mourning the passing of Country star Margo Smith,” it said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter. “Nominated for ACM Most Promising Female Vocalist in 1976, she had two #1 hits in the 1970s: “Don’t Break the Heart That Loves You” and “It Only Hurts for a Little While.” Boasting a show-stopping talent for yodeling, she was known as “The Tennessee Yodeler.” We send our love and healing to her family, friends and fans.”\n\nJo-El Sonnier\n\nJo-El Sonnier might not be a name that most fans of modern country music would know well but read up and it doesn’t take long to realize the guy was a legend.\n\nCheck out the videos of performances and it becomes obvious, too, that seeing him perform in person was a high-energy affair.\n\nHe put his heart and soul into a show, and apparently, he did that right up until the end. Sonnier died back on Jan. 13, and now new details are being reported and it turns out he actually died after a performance.\n\nLouisiana Music Hall of Fame Executive Director Mike Shepard told WWL Radio New Orleans that the 77-year-old Sonnier “died doing what he loved.”\n\n“Jo-EL’s death on stage after a successful encore is actually the only way a musician should go out,” he said.\n\nThe station reported that Sonnier, a singer/songwriter who played the accordion, had a long list of accolades that included a Grammy in 2015 and an ACM Male Vocalist of the Year nomination. He was reportedly inducted into seven different Music Hall of Fames and worked as a studio musician for a long list of stars including Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash.\n\n“He loved the idea of being honored for his music,” Shepard told WWL, “being honored for what he loved to do, pure as his heart.”\n\nRoni Stoneman\n\nCountry music legend Roni Stoneman died on Feb. 22.\n\nShe was 85. No cause of death was given.\n\nWhile her name may not be familiar to modern-day country music fans, Stoneman was known as the “first lady of the banjo,” and was a popular performer on the hit TV show, “Hee Haw.”\n\nStoneman was a native of Washington, D.C.\n\nShe was the daughter of Ernest “Pop” Stoneman, who was reportedly one of the first performers to make a career of recording country music.\n\nCountry Music Hall of Fame and Museum and CEO Kyle Young said country music was “a birthright and her life’s work.”\n\n“The second youngest of 23 children born to Hattie and Ernest ‘Pop” stoneman, Roni was an integral part of a bedrock country music family, who were longtime fixtures in the country music scene of Washington D.C.” Young said. “For 18 years on ‘Hee Haw,’ she stole scenes as both a skillful banjo player and as a comical, gap-toothed country character. She was a great talent and a strong woman.”\n\nBanjo News said Stoneman said she glued picks to her fingers so she could play the banjo faster.\n\nJeremy Tepper\n\nJeremy Tepper, a legend in the country music world, has died on June 14.\n\nHe was 60.\n\nTepper reportedly suffered a heart attack.

Most notably, he was the long-time manager of Country Music Hall of Famer George Strait, as well as stars Lee Ann Womack, Dierks Bentley, Ronnie Milsap and Clay Walker.\n\nStrait posted about Woolsey on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday.\n\n“My manager for around 45 years and most importantly my friend for even longer, Erv Woolsey, passed away this morning,” he wrote. “He had complications from surgery and just couldn’t overcome it. He was a very tough man, and fought hard, but sadly it was just too much. We will miss him so very much and will never forget all the time we had together. Won’t ever be the same without him.”\n\nAccording to a Billboard report, Woolsey worked for several labels before moving to Nashville in 1973 and become the head of promotions for ABC Records. The site said that Woolsey helped guide the careers of several top artists there, but it was during his time as the owner of The Prairie Rose, a club in Texas, that he first met Strait and began to book him for regular shows at there.\n\nBillboard said Woolsey worked for MCA in the 1980s and helped artists such as Loretta Lynn, Tanya Tucker, Conway Twitty and the Oak Ridge Boys find radio success. And, then in 1981, he reportedly got MCA records to sign Strait.\n\nHe wasn’t just a manager, though.\n\nPer Billboard, Woolsey did write “I Too Deep” for Strait and also had a hot country chart topper that he wrote, “I Can Still Make Cheyenne.”\n\nArch Yancey\n\nArch Yancey, a Country Radio Hall of Famer, died in March.\n\nHe was 88.
