        "text": "If you thought you were Chappell Roan's earliest fan, think again because Troye Sivan might have beaten you to it a whole decade ago. Multiple tweets pointing out the two stars' relationship have gone viral across social media, and people cannot believe how back they go.\n\nOn April 20, one day after Chappell Roan's set at weekend two of Coachella 2024, X user @subwaymademecry took to the social app to post screengrabs of multiple occasions during which Troye Sivan had professed his love for Chappell Roan, then still known professionally by her real name Kayleigh Rose. ‚Äúknow your gay history !!!‚Äù @subwaymademecry captioned the post, which has accumulated almost four million views at the time of writing.\n\nThe first screenshot included in the post was of a 2014 tweet by Sivan, in which he wrote: ‚ÄúI've had [this] 16-year-old girl on repeat for 2 months. you HAVE to listen to this, guys ‚Äî go send some love.‚Äù Sivan included a YouTube link promoting Roan's original song ‚ÄúDie Young,\" which has since been made private.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, also captured in @subwaymademecry's recap, Sivan wrote: ‚ÄúLET'S BLOW KAYLEIGH UP BC I HAVEN'T HEARD A VOICE LIKE THIS SINCE ADELE, NO EXAGGERATION.‚Äù Connor Franta, Sivan's boyfriend at the time, commented below, adding: ‚ÄúYESSSSS GIVE THAT VOCALLY BLESSED GODDESS HER WELL DESERVED PROMO.‚Äù\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n@subwaymademecry's tweet made other users also want to take a walk down memory lane, unearthing a picture of Connor Franta, Chappell Roan, and Troye Sivan together from almost a decade ago. ‚Äúunblocked memory: Troye Sivan and Chappell Roan in 2015,‚Äù @skyferrori posted sharing the picture.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nOf course, for some fans, the tweets are a new discovery, and they are rightfully sending then into a spiral. ‚ÄúCHAPPELL ROAN IS TRONNOR'S DAUGHTER???????‚Äù a user quipped after seeing the original post. ‚ÄúNOT MY TWO WORLDS COLLIDING AS WELL??? TROYE AND CHAPPELL PRE HSITORIC TIMES,‚Äù a second one wrote. ‚Äúno way tronnor knew chappell before she was chappell,‚Äù a third one added.\n\nFor others, however, the news isn't as much of a discovery, but they just needed the push to put two and two together. ‚ÄúCHAPPELL ROAN IS KAYLEIGH ROSE???? is that why I always thought she looked familiar wtf,‚Äù a user realized. ‚ÄúI just connected some dots bro,‚Äù someone else pointed out, echoing the sentiment. ‚ÄúI was like why does she look familiar this is insaneüò≠,‚Äù a third user commented.\n\n‚ÄúThis is how I originally discovered Chapell [sic] Roan!! I've been listening to her literally since 2014 because of that Troye tweet, and I'm so glad she's finally getting the appreciation she deserves,‚Äù a fan also wrote. Did you know about Chappell Roan and Troye Sivan's lost connection?"
