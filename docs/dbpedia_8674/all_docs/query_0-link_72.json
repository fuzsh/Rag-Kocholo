Porter will host the television event. The concert is by invitation only.\n\nPBS stations nationwide will premiere the concert — “Elton John & Bernie Taupin: The Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song” — at 8 p.m. ET on Monday, April 8 (check local listings), available via broadcast and streaming on PBS.org and the PBS App as part of the co-produced Emmy Award-winning music series. It will also be available to U.S. Department of Defense locations around the world via the American Forces Network.\n\nTaupin will also appear at the Library of Congress on Thursday, March 21, at 7 p.m. ET as part of the Live! at the Library series in conversation with Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. The event is open to the public. Register for tickets here.\n\nA once-in-a-lifetime meeting brought John, a young piano player, and lyricist Taupin together in 1967, and they have forged a songwriting partnership that continues after more than 50 years.\n\n“Your Song,” “Tiny Dancer,” “Rocket Man” “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” and “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” are just a few songs they wrote together that became timeless standards. Not to mention the fun they had with “Bennie and The Jets” and “Crocodile Rock,” which became their first No. 1 single in the U.S. in 1973.\n\n“Elton John and Bernie Taupin have written some of the most memorable songs of our lives. Their careers stand out for the quality and broad appeal of their music and their influence on their fellow artists,” Hayden said. “More than 50 years ago, they came from across the pond to win over Americans and audiences worldwide with their beautiful songs and rock anthems. We’re proud to honor Elton and Bernie with the Gershwin Prize for their incredible impact on generations of music lovers.”\n\nAbout the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song\n\nBestowed in recognition of the legendary songwriting team of George and Ira Gershwin, the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song is the nation’s highest award for influence, impact and achievement in popular music.
