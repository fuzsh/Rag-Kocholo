When someone complained about his performance on Strictly\n\nIn November the 47-year-old recently appeared on the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing where he sang a stripped back version of his hit Goodbye, My Lover.\n\nAlthough many people were touched by the performance not everyone was a fan. One viewer tweeted: “James Blunt voice goes right through me #pressesmute @bbcstrictly”.\n\nBlunt’s witty reply was to say: “Coz you’re so hollow, baby.”\n\nSign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter\n\n2. When someone asked him if he had sex in a hotel bed\n\n3. When someone said his songs made them vomit\n\n4. When he called a random Twitter user his ‘Mum’\n\n5. When he admitted that his own music is ‘s**t’\n\n6. When he trolled someone for having sex to his music\n\n7. When he trolled someone who claimed that everyone would forget about him if it wasn’t for his Twitter\n\n8. When someone complained about having to listen to one of his songs at work\n\n9. When someone complained about Radio 2 playing his songs too much\n\n10. When he waded into a spat between Piers Morgan and Olly Murs\n\n11. When he swore at Jeremy Hunt without actually swearing\n\n12. When he announced the bad news that he was releasing an album on the same day as Adele\n\n13. When he trolled his biggest song...\n\n14. ...and did it again\n\n15. When he admitted that he would only go to his own concert if he was paid.\n\n16. When he trolled the people who think that ‘he’s beautiful’"
