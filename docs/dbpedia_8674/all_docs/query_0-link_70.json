        "text": "Topline\n\nUniversal Music Group announced it will stop licensing its songs to TikTok starting Wednesday due to issues like pay disagreements and AI concerns, meaning millions of TikTok videos using these songs will be muted.\n\nKey Facts\n\nWhat Will Happen To Users’ Videos?\n\nTikTok stores songs in its music library, which users have access to and use in their videos. When UMG pulls its song catalog from TikTok, millions of videos will be affected. A great deal of songs made by UMG artists have sparked viral trends on TikTok, like Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer,” which has been used in almost 2.5 million videos, and The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights,” which has been used in 1.8 million posts. Even UMG artists like SZA who don’t have TikTok accounts have trending sounds. When songs and sounds are removed from the platform, the videos they were used in are muted, not deleted. This means the videos themselves will remain on users’ accounts, just without sound.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe use of AI-generated songs has been a growing concern within the music industry. A TikTok video using Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Ye’s (formerly known as Kanye West) voices to create an AI-generated song went viral last year, leaving users questioning whether it was real. Another extremely popular video featuring Drake and the Weeknd singing a fake song called “Heart on My Sleeve” raked up millions of views on streaming platforms like TikTok, Youtube, Apple and Spotify before it was removed. UMG reportedly sent a letter to streaming services asking them to prevent AI platforms from using songs on their services to train AI models. However, TikTok may be embracing AI-generated music as it began testing a feature earlier this month called “AI Songs,” which lets users enter text prompts that then generate songs. AI Songs uses Bloom—a large language model—to help make lyrics based on the entered prompts, and users can select which genre they want the songs to fall into.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nSongs By Top Artists—Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny—Could Disappear From TikTok Today.
