        "text": "James Blake has shared his thoughts on the monetisation of music on streaming platforms, claiming the current climate has led consumers to think \"music is free.\"\n\nThe British producer responded to a post on Twitter yesterday (March 3), that quoted him discussing how he and Frank Ocean \"never made a cent\" from the viral success of their track 'Godspeed' on TikTok — due to the track being listed as \"original sound\" in the majority of clips.\n\n\"It’s worth noting this is just an example I used in a post talking about the wider effect of TikTok on music,\" his repost reads. \"Just seeing this part makes it seem navel-gazing but I’m speaking on a thing that’s affecting artists all over the world.\"\n\nBlake then posted another Tweet, expanding the subject to discuss how the current streaming industry has created a climate of consumers not valuing music as a product: \"Something I keep seeing is ‘if you’re lucky enough to go viral, just use the exposure to generate income some other way’. Musicians should be able to generate income via their music. Do you want good music or do you want what you paid for?\"\n\nRead this next: Moving forwards: James Blake's return to club music is focused on the future\n\n\"If we want quality music somebody is gonna have to pay for it,\" Blake adds. \"Streaming services don’t pay properly, labels want a bigger cut than ever and just sit and wait for you to go viral, TikTok doesn’t pay properly, and touring is getting prohibitively expensive for most artists.\""
