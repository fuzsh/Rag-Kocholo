        "text": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Murata Manufacturing's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\n\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 47% ownership\n\nalong with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business\n\nA look at the shareholders of Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. ( ) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 54% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Murata Manufacturing.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Murata Manufacturing?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nMurata Manufacturing already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Murata Manufacturing, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Murata Manufacturing is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 6.6% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 4.7% and 3.5% of the stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Murata Manufacturing\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own JPÂ¥42b of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 45% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Murata Manufacturing. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access .\n\nUltimately the future is most important. You can access this free .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
