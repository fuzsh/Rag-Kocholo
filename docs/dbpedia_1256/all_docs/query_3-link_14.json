        "text": "Murata Manufacturing (TSE:6981) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 13% over the last month. However, we wonder if the company's inconsistent financials would have any adverse impact on the current share price momentum. Specifically, we decided to study ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Murata Manufacturing is:\n\n7.1% = JP¥180b ÷ JP¥2.6t (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every ¥1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn ¥0.07 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nMurata Manufacturing's Earnings Growth And 7.1% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, Murata Manufacturing's ROE is not much to talk about. However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 7.7%, we may spare it some thought. On the other hand, Murata Manufacturing reported a fairly low 4.7% net income growth over the past five years. Bear in mind, the company's ROE is not very high . So this could also be one of the reasons behind the company's low growth in earnings.\n\nWe then compared Murata Manufacturing's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for 6981? You can find out in\n\nIs Murata Manufacturing Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nWhile Murata Manufacturing has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 27% (or a retention ratio of 73%), it has seen very little growth in earnings. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nAdditionally, Murata Manufacturing has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Murata Manufacturing's performance. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.
