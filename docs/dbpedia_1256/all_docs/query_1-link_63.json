        "text": "Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd. reported earnings per share of ¥428.09 in the six months to September, compared to ¥398.46 in the previous corresponding period, as revenues surged 10.3%.\n\nThe company's net sales in the quarter ended September gained 25.3% to ¥344.7 billion from ¥275.0 billion in the preceding quarter, as communication modules' sales posted the highest growth of 41.9% over the period.\n\nIn the half year to September, sales were up to ¥619.62 billion from ¥561.92 billion a year ago as demand for electronic components increased despite the negative impact of slow smartphone production recovery, Murata said.\n\nOperating income in the quarter to September gained 43.2% to ¥58.6 billion from ¥40.9 billion, while net income attributable to Murata surged 74.8% to ¥57.9 billion quarter on quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, in the half year to September, the operating income slipped 8.2% to ¥99.56 billion from ¥108.50 billion in the six months to September 2016 due to increases in depreciation, amortization and production capacity expansion investments, but net income rose 7.5% to ¥91.07 billion annually over the period.\n\nThe communication equipment manufacturer said that it is revising its earnings guidance for several reasons, including \"a less favorable product mix due [to] a lower demand for profitable products, and an increase in investments.\"\n\nTotal product sales are projected to grow 20% annually in full fiscal year 2017, as net sales grow to ¥1.362 trillion, compared with a ¥1.225 trillion forecast in April. Full-fiscal 2017 operating income forecast was revised down to ¥170.0 billion from April's ¥226.0 billion projection and net income attributable to Murata was now projected at ¥144.0 billion, compared to a ¥174.0 billion forecast previously."
