        "text": "Acquisition enhances Murata’s position as a world’s leading provider of RF system solutions\n\nKYOTO, Japan and SAN DIEGO—August 22, 2014 – Murata Electronics North America, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., (TSE/OSE 6981) and Peregrine Semiconductor Corporation (Peregrine) (NASDAQ: PSMI) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Murata will acquire all outstanding shares of Peregrine not owned by Murata, for $12.50 per share in cash, or a total transaction value of $471 million ($465 million excluding Murata’s existing holding). Peregrine is the founder of RF SOI (silicon on insulator) and pioneer of advanced Radio Frequency (RF) solutions and is a leading provider of RF front-end (RFFE) solutions for mobile and analog applications. Upon closing of the transaction, Peregrine will become part of Murata’s strategy to expand its core business. Peregrine will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Murata and continue with its current business model of solving the world’s toughest RF challenges.\n\n“This acquisition will combine Murata’s world-leading mobile RF module capabilities with Peregrine’s best-in-class RF front-end products. Peregrine has a team of talented RF engineers,” said Norio Nakajima, Executive Vice President, Director of Communication Business Unit of Murata. “Peregrine invented RF SOI, has led its development for 20 years, and accomplished a large number of industry firsts. We have worked closely with them for many years. Their innovation, including the Global 1 all-silicon integrated RF front-end, is a key strategic area for the mobile industry. This transaction will deepen our existing partnership and position us to meet the expanding opportunities in this field.”\n\n“Murata is the world’s leading RF module and filter provider, and we have benefited from our many years of partnership with them. The combination of Murata’s leading products with Peregrine’s leading-edge SOI products will position us to compete aggressively in our chosen markets,” said Jim Cable, PhD, Chairman and CEO of Peregrine Semiconductor. “As part of the Murata team, we will be able to expand our existing partnership and speed the industry’s transition to an integrated, all-CMOS RF front-end. We remain committed to providing leading solutions to customers in all our current markets. We have huge respect for Murata’s capabilities, and look forward to jointly accomplishing great things.”\n\nThe acquisition will deliver to Murata advanced RF Front-end capabilities and the world’s best Silicon on Insulator (SOI) process technology, key areas for the growing integration of mobile technologies. The radio requirements of smartphones and other wireless devices continue to grow more complex. This complexity can only be solved with silicon technology. Peregrine supplies many wireless markets, including: smartphones, test & measurement, automotive, public safety radio and wireless Infrastructure. Peregrine will also provide Murata with a strong portfolio of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) covering the entire RF SOI front-end.\n\nThe transaction, which has been approved by both companies’ boards of directors, is expected to close by the end of 2014 or early 2015, subject to Peregrine’s stockholders’ approval, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions.\n\nPeregrine Semiconductor – Solving the World’s Toughest RF Challenges\n\nPeregrine Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: PSMI) founder of RF SOI (silicon on insulator), is a leading fabless provider of high-performance, integrated RF solutions.
