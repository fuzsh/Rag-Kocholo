        "text": "Sony Corp. said Sept. 1that the Japanese consumer electronics giant had completed the transfer of its battery business to Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd., adding that the transaction should have little impact on its fiscal 2018 earnings.\n\nCompletion of the transfer had been delayed from its initial target of April due to a longer-than-expected approval process from regulators. The Tokyo-based maker of smartphones and televisions announced in October 2016 that it would sell its battery business to Murata for about Â¥17.5 billion.\n\nSony had been involved in the battery business since 1975, commercializing the world's first lithium-ion battery in 1991, and developing various batteries used mainly as electronics components. However, amid tough competition, Sony decided to hand off the battery business to Murata.\n\nKyoto-based Murata, which makes ceramic capacitors, has been a major supplier to major smartphone makers such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.\n\nUnder the definitive agreement, Sony decided to sell to Murata the battery business of its wholly owned subsidiary, Sony Energy Devices Corp., its battery-related manufacturing sites in China and Singapore, and assets related to the battery business at Sony's sales R&D sites in Japan and worldwide.\n\nSony said it expects to book additional losses following the completion of the transfer, but it does not anticipate any major impact on its earnings for the year ending March 31, 2018."
