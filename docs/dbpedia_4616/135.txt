This high-spirited film introduces a group of young actors with great potential and offers an original and entertaining take on a well-known celebrity. What's especially appealing about Shooting Stars is its focus on LeBron and friends as kids and teenagers. It's refreshing for a sports biopic not to try to glorify or romanticize its subjects. Beyond their special and hard-earned skills, LeBron and his buddies come across as regular kids with typical teen concerns, and the film gives them space to do that. Director Robinson relies on the charm and chemistry of his young cast, led by endearing newcomer Cook and a powerful McLaughlin (of Stranger Things' fame).

Robinson and cinematographer Karsten Gopinath throw in some flashy camerawork that feels distracting at first but later, especially during fast-paced games when the camera is on the floor following the players, it makes sense. Similarly, the soundtrack starts off with heavy-handed instrumental music that gives way to contemporary tunes the characters themselves listen to. In the switch, the music contributes to rather than distracts from the characterizations. It's the film's focus on friendship and identity that makes this combo sports and high school/male bonding movie a rewarding and enjoyable watch.
