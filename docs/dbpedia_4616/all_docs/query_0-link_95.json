        "text": "AURORA — A gunman slipped into a midnight premiere of the new Batman movie through an emergency exit early Friday, tossed two hissing gas canisters and then methodically, calmly walked up the aisle firing, killing 12 people and wounding 58.\n\nIt was among the worst mass shootings in American history.\n\nTerrorized moviegoers, some dragging bloodied bodies, spilled out of the Century Aurora 16 complex at Aurora Town Center trying to escape shortly after 12:30 a.m.\n\nColoradans woke up Friday to news of the tragedy, an eerie echo of a similar massacre 13 years ago in a different Denver suburb, at Columbine High School. Once again, a mass shooting in Colorado was recounted around the world.\n\n“Our hearts are broken,” Gov. John Hickenlooper said.\n\n“It is beyond the power of words to fully express our sorrow this morning. Coloradans have a remarkable ability to support one another in times of crisis. This is one of those times.”\n\nPresident Barack Obama spoke from Florida, saying he instantly thought about his daughters going to the movies. “We never understand what leads someone to terrorize their fellow human beings like this,” Obama said. “Life is very fragile, and it is precious.”\n\nJames Eagan Holmes, 24, bought a ticket to the show, “The Dark Knight Rises,” then left theater 9, propping the emergency exit open for his return, investigators said. About 15 minutes into the film, he appeared beside the screen with three guns, dressed in black and wearing a ballistic helmet, gas mask and body shields.\n\nHolmes surrendered to authorities, who found his north Aurora apartment booby-trapped with explosives, techno music blasting from his stereo. His building and five buildings around it were evacuated.\n\nThe names of the victims were not released, but they include aspiring sports journalist Jessica Ghawi; Alex Sullivan, who was celebrating his 27th birthday at the movie; 23-year-old Micayla Medek; Matt McQuinn, at the theater with his girlfriend and her brother; a U.S. Navy sailor; and a child. Families and friends of those unaccounted for gathered at Gateway High School in Aurora, holding up photos and awaiting news from the six hospitals that cared for victims.\n\nAurora police spent 90 minutes Friday afternoon with about 70 family members who had not heard from their loved ones since the shooting. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said he expected families of the dead would learn their fate Friday night.\n\nThe bodies of the 10 people who died in the theater were left there until about 5 p.m. as hundreds of police officers and FBI agents investigated the crime scene. Two other people died at hospitals, which were slammed with gun-wound surgeries. Most of the 58 injured had gunshot wounds, but a handful had other injuries resulting from the mayhem inside the dimly lit theater.\n\nOf the injured, 30 were still in the hospital Friday evening, 11 in critical condition.\n\nDifficulty coping\n\n“It was like something out of a movie,” said Jacob King, who was standing in the lobby when someone carried out a motionless little girl, covered in blood. “You don’t want to believe it’s real, but it is.”\n\nA police officer took the girl and set her in the back of his squad car, then sped away.\n\nOates, his voice choked with emotion during an evening news conference, said his officers will need help coping in the aftermath of the shootings.\n\n“Our cops went through a lot,” he said. “They were taking people out of that theater and into their own police cars.”\n\nAurora police began receiving a swath of calls at 12:39 a.m. and were at the theater within 90 seconds. Holmes was taken into custody behind the theater, near a white Hyundai.\n\nInvestigators found a 12-gauge shotgun, an AR-15 assault-style weapon and a .40-caliber Glock handgun. A second Glock was found in Holmes’ car, and authorities also removed a combat helmet, duffel bag, an ammunition magazine and a vest.\n\nThe guns were purchased legally from local stores, and Holmes bought more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition online, legally, the police chief said.\n\nA gas mask, a bloody jacket, popcorn and drinks were strewn on the pavement outside the theater. A reporter in a news helicopter saw bloody footprints.\n\nMany of the nearly 200 officers at the theater drove victims to hospitals, as ambulances were doubled up with casualties.\n\nThe Department of Defense confirmed a U.S. Navy sailor who was at the theater was unaccounted for. One other Navy sailor and two U.S. Air Force airmen were injured in the attack, according to the statement. The shooting suspect was never was a member of the military, federal officials said.\n\nOne of the victims died at Children’s Hospital in Aurora, but officials there would not say whether it was a child or an adult. The most seriously injured of the other five patients there had buckshot injuries to the back.\n\nTwo of the victims at Children’s were hit with a high-velocity rifle, perhaps from 60 to 80 feet away, emergency-room physician Dr. Guy Upshaw said.\n\nTheater filled with smoke\n\nJosh Kelly, 28, was watching the movie with his girlfriend of about four years. He lost her in the chaos.\n\nJosh called his father, Robert Kelly, from the theater and said: “I can’t find my girl.” In the darkness and the smoke, and people panicking and trampling one another, he “just lost track, and he couldn’t see,” the elder Kelly said. “My son is freaked out.”\n\nThe dark theater quickly filled with smoke that stung people’s eyes and throats after the gunman tossed gas canisters, witnesses said. Moviegoers dropped to the floor and crawled over one another to get out. Some dragged bloodied bodies to the lobby.\n\n“I ran. I pushed. I did whatever I had to do to get out,” said Resharee Goodlo, whose friend didn’t make it out of the theater and is feared dead.\n\nEmma Goos, 19, was separated from her friend, but they both made it out alive. She described “15 seconds of fire, fire, fire. He let off 20 rounds in 30 seconds.”\n\nGoos tried to go home and sleep, but her thoughts were too haunting:\n\nA man with soft tissue on his head, blood gushing down his arms, holding his head and asking, “Is there a hole? Is there a hole?” Children walking out, clutching people they had never met. A girl with shrapnel in her hips being trampled at the door. And “the gunman himself standing there with his feet spread apart as if he were the king of the world, like a video game or a movie scene,” Goos said.\n\nGunman “calm”\n\nJordan Crofter, 19, sneaked into theater 9 even though he had a ticket for the showing in the theater next door. He wanted to sit with his friends.\n\nCrofter said the gunman appeared lackadaisical, “as calm as can be,” and didn’t say a word. “He was sitting there like target practice. He was trying to shoot as many people as he could.”\n\nCrofter ran for his life and was the first to the lobby. He found out later that a friend in the first row had been shot and collapsed. He didn’t know Friday whether he lived.\n\nOne of the shots blasted through the wall into theater 8, hitting a person there.\n\nThe University of Colorado said Holmes was withdrawing from the university’s graduate program in neurosciences, after enrolling at the university in June 2011. Holmes graduated from the University of California, Riverside in 2010 with a degree in neuroscience, the university said.\n\nAuthorities saw jars of liquid and ammunition in Holmes’ apartment and said they would return Saturday with federal agents to clean it up. Neighbors were allowed to go home one at a time to collect medicines or other necessities but not stay the night.\n\nJackie Mitchell said he had drinks and talked football with Holmes a few nights ago at the Zephyr Lounge. Holmes was “geeky” and had a “swagger” to him, Mitchell said.\n\n“He just didn’t seem the type to go into a movie theater and shoot it up,” Mitchell said. “He seemed like a real smart dude.”\n\nWitnesses said police came running into the theater shouting at them to run out. Some of the officers carried or dragged victims to safety.\n\nTammi Stevens, whose 18-year-old son Jacob was inside theater 9, waited for him at Gateway High School.\n\n“You let your kids go to a late-night movie … you never think something like this would happen,” she said.\n\nAurora police provide security at the theater on weekends, but because the movie premiere was playing Friday just after midnight, they were not there. The police chief said his officers would provide extra security this weekend at four other Aurora theaters showing the Batman movie, as a precaution.\n\nSometime around 1 a.m., patients began arriving at the Medical Center of Aurora. A total of 15 patients — ranging from 16 to 31 years old — were sent to the medical center, 12 of them with gunshot wounds. An additional three patients arrived at the hospital Friday afternoon, the hospital said.\n\nTwo patients in critical condition were at Swedish Medical Center.\n\nDenver Health Medical Center treated six victims; three were released and three listed in fair condition, hospital officials said. The University of Colorado Hospital had 23 victims, nine in critical condition.\n\nMore than 100 FBI and 25 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents were deployed to Colorado to help local authorities in Aurora, U.S. Department of Justice officials said.\n\nThe president ordered all flags flown at half-staff in honor of the victims.\n\nThe Town Center Mall in Aurora was closed Friday but was to reopen Saturday. A prayer vigil was planned in Aurora for 6:30 p.m. Sunday.\n\nWarner Bros. studio canceled the red-carpet premiere event of “The Dark Knight Rises” in Paris, and the studio released a statement saying the company is “deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident.”\n\nLines from previous Batman movies were quoted online Friday as news of the shooting spread, including: “Some men aren’t looking for anything logical, like money. They can’t be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.”\n\nAurora police are asking anyone with information about the shootings to call Crime Stoppers at 720-913-7867. Families looking for information about loved ones should call 303-739-1862."
