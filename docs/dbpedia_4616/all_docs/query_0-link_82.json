        "text": "“The Rivals of Amziah King,” a new independent film starring Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey, remains in production despite the writers’ and actors’ strikes that have halted some Hollywood productions and press tours.\n\nVariety reports that SAG-AFTRA recently granted approval to 39 independent productions to shoot during its strike, after confirming that they are not tied to AMPTP companies, including the film currently filming in Alabama.\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA waiver document says the following: “As of 07/18/2023, this list includes productions that are signed to agreements within the scope of the strike order, but have signed Interim Agreements allowing them to resume. Members may work on these productions without being in violation of the strike order.”\n\nVariety says the union previously announced it would approve interim agreements, known as “waivers,” for independent films and TV productions. Read the full article. The piece explains that SAG-AFTRA launched its first strike against the film and TV companies in 43 years last week, citing artificial intelligence, streaming revenue sharing, and basic increases in minimums to keep pace with inflation among their chief concerns.\n\nFrom their website: SAG-AFTRA represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, DJs, news writers, news editors, program hosts, puppeteers, recording artists, singers, stunt performers, voiceover artists and other media professionals.\n\n“SAG-AFTRA members are the faces and voices that entertain and inform America and the world,” the site says. “With national offices in Los Angeles and New York, and local offices nationwide, SAG-AFTRA members work together to secure the strongest protections for media artists into the 21st century and beyond.”\n\nThe AMPTP is the entertainment industry’s official collective bargaining representative, negotiating 58 industry-wide collective bargaining agreements on behalf of hundreds of motion picture and television producers. Learn more.\n\nMcConaughey has spent part of his summer filming the new movie, “The Rivals of Amziah King,” in the Birmingham and Bessemer areas. The “A Time to Kill” and “Magic Mike” star was spotted filming at J&J Grocery and Deli in Bessemer and eating a meal at Frothy Monkey in downtown Birmingham early in the production.\n\nHe was also spotted in Pell City, where he filmed at a well-known steakhouse and was filmed throwing up the “Hook ‘em Horns’ hand signal in honor of his beloved Texas Longhorns. The actor raised a ruckus in Walker County as fans flocked to Frosty Mug in Jasper, with many earning a newfound respect for the hard-working actor as he traverses the state to complete the indie film.\n\nThe actor even made time to visit patients at Children’s of Alabama, a pediatric hospital in Birmingham during his stint here. “Our sincere thanks to Matthew McConaughey for bringing smiles to our patients at Children’s of Alabama,” the hospital said Friday on social media, posting photos of the actor’s visit on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\n\nThis isn’t McConaughey’s first visit to Alabama. He previously filmed scenes for 2006′s “Failure to Launch” in Cherokee and Etowah counties, according to a 2005 report by The Gadsden Times. The actor went rock climbing at Cherokee Rock Village in Leesburg and filmed a mountain-biking scene on a nearby ridge, a producer for the movie said. McConaughey also was spotted in Mobile in February 2015, around the time he filmed “Free State of Jones” in Louisiana.\n\nAlthough the movie is set in Oklahoma, locations in and around Birmingham have been used filming during a seven-week period in June and July. McConaughey was announced as the star of “The Rivals of Amziah King” on May 8 by Black Bear Pictures, an independent studio based in California and London. Reports at the time described the movie as a “deeply atmospheric, character-focused crime thriller set against the unique backdrop of remote Oklahoma.”\n\nMore on Matthew McConaughey in Alabama:\n\nMatthew McConaughey spotted at burger joint in Alabama as movie filming begins\n\nMatthew McConaughey spotted at downtown Birmingham cafe: ‘He was so nice’"
