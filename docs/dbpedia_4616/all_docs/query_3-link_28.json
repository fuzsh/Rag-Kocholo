        "text": "If Los Angeles is built on beautiful illusions (some might say lies), then call it a cosmic coincidence that the high point of intelligent Hollywood filmmaking—Roman Polanski’s staggeringly great neonoir—arrived in the service of exposing the city’s buried sins. Chinatown is as ingenious as screenwriting gets: Robert Towne’s 1930s detective tale seamlessly blends glamour and action with then-current paranoia, the Nixonian moment when “follow the money” was the phrase on all lips. In the film’s case, it’s “follow the water,” diverted from thirsty orange groves in the Valley to future suburban tracts. The crime is colossal in scope and based on true events; rakish detective Jack Nicholson (never better) is quickly in over his head. But no mere period piece—even one with luscious Faye Dunaway—could ever top our list on historicity alone. The lasting beauty of this cynical movie is obvious to any screenwriter who aspires to say something profound about their town, and to any Angeleno who wants to believe the truth is out there.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nA completely original musical vibrating with the spirit of France’s immortal The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (yet alive with the dreams of today’s Angelenos), writer-director Damien Chazelle's swirling masterpiece gave us a career-best performance from Emma Stone, heartbreaking in every shot. Chazelle was only 30 when he made this. Let that sink in. Fully shot on location, La La Land is a one-stop-shop of classic local landmarks, from Griffith Observatory and Hollywood’s “You Are the Star” mural, to the dearly departed Rialto Theatre and Hermosa Pier’s Lighthouse Café (where Seb saves jazz on a nightly basis). If you want to twirl in your yellow dress at that iconic valley view, you’ll have to drive up to Cathy’s Corner on Mt. Hollywood Drive. But anyone hoping to recreate the opening freeway number is invited to leave the city right now.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nThis isn’t your father’s Philip Marlowe: Robert Altman’s spectacular neonoir transplants Raymond Chandler’s cynical detective (Elliott Gould) into druggy 1970s California. He’s a man far outside his time, driving a 1948 Lincoln Continental and talking two-dimensional tough as if nothing had changed since the end of WWII. But beneath the pristine sands of the Malibu beaches and the glinting lights of the Hollywood Hills, something terrible lurks. And though Altman adheres to a number of mystery story standards, this is less a straightforward whodunit than a sharp, sarcastic existential quest. Never before had the moral rot of Los Angeles and its many self-obsessed denizens been so potently satirized.—Keith Uhlich\n\nHow many aspiring starlets have come to the entertainment capital of the world, only to have their dreams smashed? David Lynch’s hallucinatory tale of a perky blond ingenue (the extraordinary Naomi Watts) caught up in a mystery involving an amnesiac brunette (Laura Elena Harring) begins with a bone-crunching car accident on the eponymous roadway and basks in the city’s boozy, nightmarish atmosphere. But look beyond Lynch’s expectedly surreal sights (a demonic homeless man living behind a Gardena diner, a soothsaying albino cowboy, Billy Ray Cyrus) and you’ll witness one of the director’s most devastatingly emotional works—a mournful love poem to all those who have been chewed up and spit out by the Hollywood machine.—Keith Uhlich\n\nArguably Hollywood’s first zombie movie, Billy Wilder’s memento mori is a grotesquerie of Tinseltown decrepitude, populated with the walking waxworks of a bygone era. Desperate to keep his Plymouth from repossession, deadbeat screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) takes shelter at fictitious 10086 Sunset Boulevard, a mansion-turned-mausoleum that contains the silent-screen star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Hired to do a polish on her vanity revamp of Salomé, Gillis becomes a kept man, swathed in bespoke suits and smothered by self-loathing. No drama better epitomizes the film industry’s pathological nostalgia for past glories, manufacturing celebrities forever addicted to fickle adoration. Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, Cecil B. DeMille and Schwab’s Pharmacy all make appearances, but the best cameo is saved for Melrose Avenue’s poisoned dream factory, Paramount Pictures.—Stephen Garrett\n\nIf you know only the Lita Ford song, you’ve got some viewing to do. In this wonderfully seedy L.A. private-eye tale, the murder plot skips from pavement-bound criminality to the frightening reaches of apocalyptic doom, courtesy of a glowing, radioactive suitcase. (Quentin Tarantino’s a fan.) Our hero—the Mickey Spillane–created Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker)—is close to a thug himself, leading with his fists and smugness. But the real reason this mighty noir charts so high on our list is clear in nearly every background, from the soon-to-be-razed tenements of Bunker Hill to the Hollywood Athletic Club and a bopping jazz bar on Figueroa. Director Robert Aldrich would go on to huge budgets and studio luxuries (The Dirty Dozen), but he never eclipsed this movie’s pungent sense of place, a corruption seeping out of every bruised face and busted, dead-end apartment.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nRobert Altman masterfully skewered the Angeleno psyche in many of his pictures, but those shrewd observational tools were especially incisive (and damning) in his L.A. swan song, a tragicomic tapestry that stretches from lofty homes in the Hollywood Hills and the earthy hiking trails of Griffith Park, to the trailer-park lows of working-class Downey. A sprawling latticework based on the stories of Raymond Carver and transposed seamlessly from the writer’s native Pacific Northwest, Altman’s magnum opus of minor lives shimmers with a chronic anxiety aptly suited for a region haunted by earthquakes. Pool cleaner, limo driver, newscaster, doctor, artist, lounge singer, policeman—all hide emotional fault lines that vein throughout the city’s sprawl. As if this weren’t L.A. enough, check out the film’s Thomas Guide end credits.—Stephen Garrett\n\nWere it not for the title card and the familiar site of the Bonaventure Hotel’s towers peeking through the skyline in Blade Runner’s opening shot, you’d think you were looking at a Bosch painting instead of gliding over the City of Angels circa 2019. Flames shoot out of smokestacks and people are living on top of each other; if ever a movie deserved to have the overused phrase Hell-Ay applied to its aesthetic, it’s Ridley Scott’s dystopic noir. “Visual futurist” Syd Mead’s conception of a metropolitan nightmare recasts tomorrow’s Los Angeles as a glorious ruin, lovingly turning landmarks like the Union train station into a dirty police precinct and the Deco Bradbury Building into an acid-rain-soaked battleground. It’s no surprise that, when the director’s cut was released in 1992 at the Nuart Theatre, the lines were around the block. Angelenos know a dark valentine when they see it.—David Fear\n\nIn the years between Robert Altman’s seemingly uninterrupted string of ’70s studio masterpieces and this 1992 comeback, he didn’t really disappear so much as shift to a more intimate canvas. But when the revered director returned to make a definitive Hollywood satire, the town rose up to welcome him. Dozens of celebrities—from Cher and Julia Roberts to Malcolm McDowell and Buck Henry—happily contributed cameos, adding immeasurably to the film’s verisimilitude. But apart from backstabbing life on the lot, there are dynamic set pieces establishing a desperate city: A screenwriter is stalked and murdered at the legendary Rialto Theatre; the killer, a studio executive (Tim Robbins), escapes to an exclusive spa in Desert Hot Springs; finally, his crime closing in on him, he succumbs to the Pasadena police, a world away from his sphere of entitlement.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nEvery era gets the white knight it deserves; for Los Angeles in the early ’90s, that man was a shaggy-haired stoner who went by “The Dude.” Joel and Ethan Coen’s cult comedy riffs heavily on Raymond Chandler’s 1940 detective stories (it even borrows a famous line from the author’s classic Farewell, My Lovely), but the film’s skewed paradise of kooks and freaks is completely its own. Joel himself has claimed that the movie was a tribute to the “marginal Los Angeles” he encountered in Venice Beach, Pasadena and parts of the Valley, and the film works beautifully as a celebration of the city’s fringe dwellers: the hippie dreamers, ex-military nutjobs, far-out feminist artists and lonesome cowboys who call L.A. home.—David Fear\n\nFading screenwriter Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) gets accused of strangling a checkroom girl and throwing her body into Benedict Canyon. His alibi? Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame), a neighbor in his Beverly Hills apartment complex. Nicholas Ray’s tragedy is a deeply forlorn look at Los Angeles, where road rage is a matter of course and the most tender relationship often ends up being with your agent.—Stephen Garrett\n\nTerence Stamp plays a rugged Brit out of water, an ex-con come to L.A. to avenge his daughter’s death in Steven Soderbergh’s gloriously time-jumbled thriller. The urban environs are filmed like an existential playground, and costar Luis Guzmán hilariously sums up the town’s hazy climate: “You could see the sea out there, if you could see it.”—Keith Uhlich\n\nJulianne Moore is an affluent San Fernando Valley housewife who becomes allergic to her environment—literally and figuratively—in Todd Haynes’s unsettling character study. The threat of illness is everywhere for this silver-spoon suburbanite who seems to be adversely reacting to everything from the omnipresent Los Angeles smog to her own banal lifestyle. Haynes’s tour de force speaks brilliantly to L.A.’s anxiety-inducing influence.—Keith Uhlich\n\nBecause it’s made up almost entirely of clips from other movies, you’re never going to be able to rent or purchase this seminal study of the city’s onscreen presence (assembled by CalArts film theorist Thom Andersen). But if you ever hear of a public screening, clear your schedule: The connections are humorous, with nods to everything from Female (1933) to Swordfish (2001).—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nSet in an unglamorous stretch of Hollywood, with its sun-faded donut shops, mini-mall laundromats and fleabag motels, Sean Baker’s mesmerizing feature opens like a shot of indie adrenaline and doesn’t let up. Filmed completely on an iPhone, this day-in-the-life of two trans hustlers (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez’s fresh-out-of-jail firecracker, Mya Taylor’s voice of reason) is the kind of fresh modern story Tinseltown just doesn’t tell—even though it’s happening right in its backyard.—Tim Lowery\n\n“The more you drive, the less intelligent you are,” goes a line of wisdom: Alex Cox’s brilliantly bonkers debut is a punk-tinged riff on aliens, generic supermarket products, Scientology, G-men and jaded youth. Its Los Angeles is a town where the automobile is king, but car repossessors rule. The casual lunacy is intoxicating, with a blasé acceptance of anarchy that epitomizes L.A. cool.—Stephen Garrett\n\nBoth a gorgeous throwback to ’50s Hollywood tough guys and a piercing comment on the post–Rodney King ’90s, Curtis Hanson’s tightly wound cop drama runs on the tension between L.A.’s dream-factory mechanics and the sordid reality. It’s a place where one could run into a hooker at the Formosa Cafe who looks like Lana Turner—or into the real Turner herself.—David Fear\n\nAmy Heckerling’s totally awesome teen comedy is supposed to offer an investigative eye into youth culture at the dawn of the ’80s: writer Cameron Crowe famously went undercover at a high school to write the book that inspired the movie. But while its insights are universal (teenagers are horny and desperate to grow up!), the details are quintessentially Californian. Ridgemont High doesn’t exist, but the Sherman Oaks Galleria – the nucleus of Valley teen interaction – sure does. And while surfer burnout Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) may seem like a zonked-out cartoon character to outsiders, it’s fair to say he’s real, too. —Matthew Singer\n\nWhen Brian De Palma decided to update Rear Window, he went sky-high: to the Hollywood Hills’ octagonal Chemosphere, an icon of architectural Modernism. In addition to this ominous bachelor pad, the movie visits a surfeit of L.A. landmarks (many of them now gone), such as the beloved Tail o’ the Pup hot-dog stand, the swank Rodeo Collection mall and Tower Records.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nThe neighborhood of Watts has never been as poetically rendered as it is in Charles Burnett’s iconic indie. Though its shots of the area’s riot-scarred streets double as a historical document of the African-American district, it’s the way Burnett restores dignity to the community that gives this movie its staying power.—David Fear\n\nIn LA, if the Big One doesn’t get you, the traffic will. No other city could have provided the backdrop and the playground for Jan de Bont’s insanely fun bomb-on-a-bus flick. Where else is both sprawling and congested enough to make the concept of a city bus strapped with an explosive that will detonate if the odometer dips below 50mph instantly and consistently hair-raising? It’s the only place where a cop might look like Keanu Reeves and someone resembling Sandra Bullock might plausibly take public transport.—Matthew Singer\n\nThe short-lived swing revival of the late ’90s is one of those fads that seemed dorky upon arrival, but watching the era-defining indie comedy that preceded its national breakout, you get why it caught on: in LA, anyway, it looked like a totally hip scene, man. And it was: as the movie shows, retro-cool night spots like The Derby and The Dresden allowed the most struggling of actors to cosplay as the Rat Pack, even if they’d spent the earlier part of the night sitting around a shitty apartment eating pizza and making video-game Wayne Gretzky’s head bleed. —Matthew Singer\n\nDeceptively shallow but ultimately fascinating, Sofia Coppola’s crime drama doesn’t quite take the side of the real-life teen thieves who raided the Hollywood Hills homes of Paris Hilton, Megan Fox and others. But it doesn’t depict them as monsters, either—or anything worse than the nincompoops that bored kids can often be—and that’s provocative. Fun fact: Hilton let the crew shoot scenes at her actual pad on Clerendon Road.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nJohn McClane (Bruce Willis) is a New York City cop, so already he’s a fish out of water. But when his estranged wife and others are taken hostage at the top of the sleek “Nakatomi Plaza” building (the recently completed headquarters of Twentieth Century Fox), our hero springs into action with honed urban instincts. A classic Hollywood action picture, it also evokes the catty maelstrom of L.A. media.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nMany Paul Thomas Anderson movies are love letters to the greater Los Angeles area of his youth – five of them are on this list – but this is his Valentine’s Day card: a freewheeling romcom about kids running wild through the San Fernando Valley circa 1973. It’s positively giddy in its depiction of young love – or at least, youthful infatuation – and unabashed in its nostalgia: the movie is named after a defunct SoCal record store chain that never factors into the film itself. Look out for a demonically intense Bradley Cooper as LA scenester and movie producer Jon Peters, a personality as big as Laurel Canyon.—Matthew Singer\n\nA profoundly influential 1950s fear film, this is the one about giant radioactive ants laying waste to the human population. The gargantuan pests are spawned in New Mexico’s A-bomb deserts, but make their way to the sewers of L.A., where soldiers descend (via the Los Angeles River spillway) to do fiery battle.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nThe definitive record of a crucial moment in the city’s musical history, this doc puts you right where the action was, from the dingy church where X practiced to the mosh pit at a Germs show at the Masque. This is L.A. punk, year zero, in all its uncut glory—an ’80s time capsule that doubles as a note from the California underground.—David Fear"
