To understand both the roots and the evolution of the genre, films made in the United States and Great Britain from 1945-1955 will be screened and analyzed, as will Neo-Noir movies made by subsequent generations of filmmakers.\n\nFIM 3345\n\nBlack & White: Race and Image in American Cinema\n\n3 credits\n\nThis course consists of an examination of the depiction of African-Americans in American films from the industry's inception to present day, as well as an examination of films made by black filmmakers for the African-American audience, and ultimately, a global marketplace. The depiction of blacks in Hollywood films from 1914 until the late 1960s, and especially in culturally significant films such as Gone with the Wind, was marked by radical racial stereotyping and objectification into familiar cultural categories, such as the Big Buck, the Uncle Tom, the Mammy, the Hot Mama and Pickaninny Children. The search for authentic black expression of genuine black experience led to the first films by mainstream African-American filmmakers in the early 1970s, followed by the blaxploitation era and then the rise of African-American auteurs such as Spike Lee and Tyler Perry, who resonantly explore contemporary and historical black life.\n\nFIM 3346\n\nGroundbreaking 1970s Cinema\n\n3 credits\n\nAll too often, the decade of the 1970s is characterized by three films and three filmmakers: The Godfather and Francis Coppola, Jaws and Steven Spielberg, Star Wars and George Lucas. The 1970s as a distinct period represented a renaissance in American filmmaking, the rise of the \"New Hollywood,\" and the emergence of exciting directors such as Martin Scorsese, Terrence Malick, Brian DePalma, Gordon Parks, Jr., John Cassavetes, and Robert Altman, among others.

Students will learn how to use EP Budgeting & Scheduling software (the film and television industry standard) and actually budget and schedule a feature film screenplay as if they were line producing the feature themselves. This course will cover the unions (SAG, IATSE, WGA, DGA, FICA, Pension, Health & Welfare, Workers Comp, etc.), how they function, and how to incorporate that information into a budget with EP B&S software. This course will provide Year Three producing students with the skills needed to organize big-budget films with many shooting days and large crews that move around from location to location, all the while being clear about the end-product being created.\n\nFIM 3432\n\nMarketing and Distribution\n\n2 credits\n\nIn this Year Three producing class, you will learn about the purpose of a market research screening and how to organize one.

Student directors will hone their powers of script analysis and development of concepts. In order to help shape the filmmaker's approach to directing or rewriting someone else's material, it is important to know how to analyze that material, i.e., what questions to ask in order to define or clarify theme, tone and ultimately narrative elements of the story. This class will explore the craft elements of suspense, mystery and dramatic irony. The approach to storytelling taken in this course is not a law in every case, but it is a classic form and a touchstone from which one may stray; but of course one must first understand the form before one can depart from it, in an effort to evade an audience's expectations. Prerequisite(s): Enrollment by permission of instructor.\n\nFIM 3724\n\nWho the Devil Made it?\n\n3 credits\n\nTaught by Peter Bogdanovich and using Who the Devil Made it?, his seminal anthology of interviews with classic film directors as the text for the course, this class will entail screenings and close analysis of films by these various directors, their narrative concerns, aesthetic approaches, and practical methods from preproduction through post.\n\nFIM 3744\n\nNew Media\n\n2 credits\n\nAs the world of production and distribution adjusts to the new distribution and marketing avenues via the internet, this elective course will cover the concepts of making films for the shorter format, with an emphasis on using all the new tools available to the young filmmaker to attract an audience for those films.\n\nFIM 3745\n\nProducing the Genre Film\n\n2 credits\n\nThis course will demonstrate the tried and true rules of what makes a film in the horror/creature feature/thriller genre work.
