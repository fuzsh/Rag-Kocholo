        "text": "Credit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nAlec Baldwin Fatally Shoots Cinematographer on 'Rust' Set After Prop Gun Misfire: Everything to Know\n\nWhile filming his movie Rust on Thursday, October 21, 2021, Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun that injured the film's director, Joel Souza, and killed director of photography Halyna Hutchins. The incident occurred at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico. According to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department, the weapon was \"discharged\" by the 30 Rock alum and Deadline later reported that production on the Western was paused. Souza and Hutchins were rushed to receive medical attention after being struck. Hutchins was pronounced dead at University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. Deadline later reported that Souza was released from the hospital the day after the shooting. \"Mr. Baldwin came in voluntarily to speak with investigators,\" sheriff's office spokesman Juan Ríos noted in a statement, asserting that the situation would be treated like \"any other investigation.\" [sendtonews type=\"float\" key=\"LkoEeIvSGC-2834398-14453\"] Baldwin broke his silence on Hutchins' death one day after the shooting via X (formerly known as Twitter). \"There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours,\" he wrote. \"I'm fully cooperating with the police investigation to address how this tragedy occurred and I am in touch with her husband, offering my support to him and his family. My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna.\" Scroll down for the latest updates on the Rust shooting:\n\nCredit: James Gourley/Variety/Shutterstock\n\nWho Is Halyna Hutchins?\n\nUkraine native Hutchins was working as director of photography on Rust and was named one of American Cinematography's \"rising stars\" in the profession in 2019. She previously contributed to 2019's Darlin' and 2020's Blindfire, as well as AMC's The Walking Dead. She was pronounced dead on Thursday at University of New Mexico Hospital.\n\nWhile working on Rust, Hutchins often shared updates about the filming process with her Instagram followers. \"One of the perks of shooting a western is you get to ride horses on your day off:),\" she captioned a video of herself on Wednesday, October 20, as she joined a group on horseback.\n\nCredit: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nWhy Did Crew Members Walk Off Set Earlier That Day?\n\nThe LA Times reports that several crew members walked off set to protest working conditions hours ahead of the fatal accident. They accused the production of not properly following safety protocols, including gun inspections. The workers claimed that there were two accidental gun discharges on set before, with Baldwin’s stunt double allegedly firing a gun that was announced as “cold” only to find a live round in it.\n\n“There should have been an investigation into what happened,” a crew member alleged to the LA Times. “There were no safety meetings. There was no assurance that it wouldn’t happen again. All they wanted to do was rush, rush, rush.”\n\nCredit: Eric McCandless/ABC/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nHow Did Other Sets React?\n\nMany film and TV sets are taking action and vowing not to risk having “hot” or “live” — meaning loaded — weapons on set. ABC’s police drama The Rookie has officially banned live rounds.\n\n“As of today, it is now policy on The Rookie that all gunfire on set will be with Air Soft guns with CG muzzle flashes added in post,” showrunner Alexi Hawleywrote in a memo obtained by The Hollywood Reporter on Friday, October 22. “There will be no more ‘live’ weapons on the show. The safety of our cast and crew is too important.”\n\nAmazon Prime’s The Boys, which is known for its violent action sequences, will also forgo live rounds. Showrunner Eric Kripke, who worked with Rust cast member Jensen Ackles on Supernatural and The Boys, announced the news on Friday via Twitter. “In [Hutchins’] memory, a simple, easy pledge: no more guns with blanks on any of my sets ever. We'll use VFX muzzle flashes. Who's with me?” he wrote.\n\nCredit: Pressman/Most/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nHas It Happened Before?\n\nThis is not the first time a prop gun has led to fatalities on a film set. In 1993, the late Brandon Lee was killed during filming for The Crow after an improperly loaded prop gun was fired. His sister, Shannon Lee, reacted to the Rust incident on Thursday.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and to Joel Souza and all involved in the incident on 'Rust,'\" she tweeted via a memorial account set up for her brother. \"No one should ever be killed by a gun on a film set. Period.\"\n\nCredit: Kristina Bumphrey/StarPix/Shutterstock\n\nJoel Souza Reacts\n\n\"I am gutted by the loss of my friend and colleague, Halyna,\" Souza said in a statement. \"She was kind, vibrant, incredibly talented, fought for every inch and always pushed me to be better. My thoughts are with her family at this most difficult time. I am humbled and grateful by the outpouring of affection we have received from our filmmaking community, the people of Santa Fe, and the hundreds of strangers who have reached out. It will surely aid in my recovery.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Halyna Hutchins/Instagram\n\nThe ‘Last Photo’ of Halyna Hutchins\n\nOn October 22, a Rust crewmember named Serge Svetnoy shared a photo of Hutchins that he claimed was taken shortly before the fatal shooting. “This is the last photo with Halyna on set,” he wrote via Facebook.\n\nThe snapshot showed the cinematographer shooting a scene with Baldwin in a small church on the New Mexico set.\n\nTwo days later, Svetnoy shared an emotional post in which he revealed that he “was holding [Hutchins] in my arms while she was dying. Her blood was on my hands,” he wrote via Facebook on October 24.\n\nIn that same message, the electrician stated that, in his opinion, Hutchins’ death was “the fault of negligence and unprofessionalism.”\n\nCredit: Jae C Hong/AP/Shutterstock\n\nMore Information on Crew Member Who Handled Firearms\n\nHannah Gutierrez Reed was the armorer — or person in charge of firearms — on the set of Rust. During a September 2021 episode of the “Voices of West” podcast, the former model admitted “the best part” of her job was “just showing people who are normally kind of freaked out by guns how safe they can be and how they’re not really problematic unless put in the wrong hands.”\n\nReed is the daughter of longtime armorer Thell Reed, who was Brad Pitt’s shooting coach on the 2007 film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. However, the 24-year-old had only worked on one movie before landing the role of head armorer on Baldwin's western.\n\nThe Hollywood rookie noted she had “figured” out most of the job's requirements on “my own” and said that “loading blanks” is the “scariest thing to me.”\n\nCredit: Myung J Chun/Los Angeles Times/Shutterstock\n\nThe Armorer Says She 'Has No Idea' Why Live Rounds Were in the Gun\n\nGutierrez Reed's lawyers, Jason Bowles and Robert Gorence, released a statement to Us in October 2021.\n\n\"First Hannah would like to extend her deepest and most sincere condolences to the family and friends of Halyna,\" the statement read, referring to Hutchins as \"an inspirational woman in film who Hannah looked up to.\"\n\nThe statement went on to allege that she had been \"slandered\" in the aftermath of the shooting.\n\n\"Safety is Hannah’s number one priority on set. Ultimately this set would never have been compromised if live ammo were not introduced,\" the lawyers claimed on her behalf. \"Hannah has no idea where the live rounds came from. Hannah and the prop master gained control over the guns and she never witnessed anyone shoot live rounds with these guns and nor would she permit that. They were locked up every night and at lunch and there’s no way a single one of them was unaccounted for or being shot by crew members. Hannah still, to this day, has never had an accidental discharge.\"\n\nThough there have been reports that there were two accidental discharges in other situations on set, Gutierrez Reed's lawyers allege that others were at fault. \"The first one on this set was the prop master and the second was a stunt man after Hannah informed him his gun was hot with blanks,\" they alleged.\n\nCredit: Andres Leighton/AP/Shutterstock\n\nThe Armorer Wanted More Time to Prepare\n\nGutierrez Reed's lawyers suggested that the blame for the fatal accident lay with other filmmakers.\n\n\"Hannah was hired on two positions on this film, which made it extremely difficult to focus on her job as an armorer,\" they said in the October 2021 statement. \"She fought for training, days to maintain weapons, and proper time to prepare for gunfire but ultimately was overruled by production and her department. The whole production set became unsafe due to various factors, including lack of safety meetings. This was not the fault of Hannah.\"\n\nCredit: Andres Leighton/AP/Shutterstock\n\nBaldwin Talks to Hutchins' Family\n\nBaldwin explained that he met with Hutchins' husband as well as her son to offer support after the shooting.\n\n\"The guy is overwhelmed with grief,\" Baldwin said of Hutchins' husband in October 2021. \"There are incidental accidents on film sets from time to time but nothing like this. This is a one in a trillion event, and so he is in shock [and] has a 9-year-old son. We are in constant contact with him. We’re very worried about his family and his kid, and we’re eagerly awaiting for the sheriff’s department telling us what their investigation has yielded.”\n\nCredit: Jae C Hong/AP/Shutterstock\n\nAssistant Director Breaks His Silence\n\nHalls released a statement in which he praised his “friend” Hutchins. “I’m shocked and saddened by her death,” he said. “It’s my hope that this tragedy prompts the industry to reevaluate its values and practices to ensure no one is harmed through the creative process again.”\n\nHe continued, “My thoughts are with all who knew and loved Halyna.”\n\nHalls did not address the details of the incident or the reports that he was the one who handed Baldwin the gun involved in the shooting.\n\nCredit: Kristina Bumphrey/StarPix/Shutterstock\n\nCorrecting the Narrative?\n\nBaldwin reposted a thread from Terese Magpale Davis, who worked on Rust as a costume designer, outlining what they allege really happened on set. Davis’ post, which the actor shared via his Instagram account on November 2, claimed “the story being spun of us being overworked and surrounded by unsafe, chaotic conditions is bulls—t.”\n\nDavis stated that she “never worked more than a 12.5-hour shoot day,” saying that only happened once and “most days” were under the 12-hour mark. She recalled the day that Hutchins died, saying, “We had come off a 12-hour turnaround after an 11-hour shoot day,” noting they had a “56-hour weekend right before” the prolonged day. “No one was too tired to do their jobs,” she said.\n\nShe refuted claims that the producers on the film didn’t care about their crew, writing, “They were some of the most approachable and warm producers I’ve ever worked with.” Davis explained that “concerns were heard and addressed” by the producers. According to her, the crew had a union rep who told production “not to give in to the camera crew” demands because they were asking for things that “the union does not require.”\n\nDavis alleged that she has spoken with the producers on the project since the accident, and they told her they have chosen not to defend themselves against the “blatantly false accusations” because they want the “focus to be on Halyna” and they want to “grieve and recover.”\n\nCredit: Lumeimages/MEGA\n\nBaldwin's First Interview\n\nThe It's Complicated actor sat down for an in-depth interview with ABC News more than one month after the tragedy, opening up about the aftermath of the shooting. In a clip from the December 2021 special, Baldwin cried while reflecting on what went wrong on set.\n\n\"The trigger wasn't pulled. I didn't pull the trigger,\" he said. \"I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger at them. Never. I have no idea [how a bullet got in there]. Someone put a live bullet in a gun. A bullet that wasn't even supposed to be on the property.\"\n\nBaldwin went on to say the incident was the \"worst thing\" that's ever happened to him, explaining, \"Because I think back and I think, 'What could I have done?'\"\n\nCredit: ABC News\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nBaldwin confessed during his first sit-down interview about the incident that he didn't feel guilty, revealing, \"I might have killed myself if I felt that I was responsible. I don't say that lightly.\"\n\nHe continued to deny pulling the trigger, asserting that he was simply following Hutchins' directions on set. \"I've been told by people who are in the know, in terms of even inside the state, that it's highly unlikely that I would be charged with anything criminally,\" he added.\n\nCredit: imageSPACE/Shutterstock\n\nThe Letter\n\nBaldwin shared a two-page letter via Instagram in December 2021 that was written by the Rust crew, which defended the film’s production. The writers of the note clarified that the note had \"not been sanctioned or influenced in any way by the producers,” but was intended to \"express a more accurate account\" of their \"workplace tragedy.\"\n\nThe letter stated that Hutchins was the “heart of the production” and “losing her hurt every single one of us.\"\n\n\"We are hurting from the loss of our togetherness, our spirit, and the loss of our labor,” the message continued. “We are hurting for our friends that have been targeted by the public as they themselves grieve.\"\n\nWhile those who worked on the film said the production had its challenges, “the descriptions of Rust as a chaotic, dangerous, and exploitative workplace are false and distract from what matters the most: the memory of Halyna Hutchins, and the need to find modern alternatives to outdated industry firearm and safety practices.”\n\nCredit: John Sheene/Ace Pictures/Shutterstock\n\nThe Investigation Continues\n\nPolice sought a warrant to obtain the Boss Baby actor's cell phone in December 2021, according to Deadline, requesting the device to determine whether there might be \"any evidence relating to the death investigation of Halyna Hutchins.\" A judge signed off on the paperwork, which stated, \"Such information, if it exists, may be material and relevant to this investigation.\"\n\nAt the time, Baldwin's lawyer noted, \"We are confident that the evidence will show that Mr. Baldwin is not responsible civilly or criminally for what occurred on October 21, and he continues to cooperate with authorities.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Alec Baldwin/Instagram\n\nAlec's Christmas Message\n\nBaldwin took to Instagram on Christmas Eve 2021 to thank “all the people who sent me such kind words and best wishes and strength and hope and prayers, thoughts and lots of encouragement.”\n\nHe said in the December 24 video, ”I got hundreds, hundreds of emails from friends, family and colleagues and people I haven't heard from in quite a while to send me strength and good wishes and so forth. I'm really grateful to them.”\n\nThe actor then referenced the tragedy. “I’m looking forward to some aspects of this being behind me, of course. For everyone who is involved in this, it'll never be behind us because someone died so tragically,” he said. “I only care about my wife and my kids and moving forward with my life and trying to get through a tough time, a really tough time. Whatever holiday you're celebrating, happy holidays to everybody. I hope that you're as lucky as I am in one department, that you're home with your family; I'm home with my family.\"\n\nCredit: Gregory Pace/Shutterstock\n\nThe Financial Ramifications\n\nRust Movie Productions LLC was fined over $136,000 by New Mexico’s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau in April 2022, after safety officials claimed in a statement that the production company showed “plain indifference to the recognized hazards associated with the use of firearms on set that resulted in a fatality, severe injury, and unsafe working conditions.”\n\nEnvironment Cabinet Secretary James Kenney released a separate statement after announcing the fine.\n\n“The investigation found that this tragic incident never would have happened if Rust Movie Productions, LLC has followed national film industry standards for firearm safety,” he explained. “This is a complete failure of the employer to follow recognized national protocols that keep employees safe.”\n\nThe bureau confirmed that the “Willful-Serious” citation — and $136,793 fine — is the maximum permitted under New Mexico law.\n\nFor their part, Rust Movie Productions LLC plans to appeal the penalty.\n\n“While we appreciate OSHA’s time and effort in its investigation,” the company told CBS in an official statement, “we disagree with its findings and plan to appeal. Our thoughts and prayers remain with Halyna’s family.”\n\nCredit: AP/Shutterstock\n\nWhat Did the FBI Forensic Report of the Gun Find?\n\nBaldwin has stated that he believes he did not pull the trigger. However, an FBI forensic report obtained by ABC News in August 2022 reportedly stated that the gun Baldwin was using was evaluated in various positions.\n\nWith the hammer at various angles — including quarter-, half- and fully cocked positions — the gun \"could not be made to fire without a pull of the trigger while the working internal components were intact and functional,\" the report stated.\n\nWith the hammer de-cocked on a loaded chamber, the gun was able to detonate a primer \"without a pull of the trigger when the hammer was struck directly,\" which is normal for a Pietta .45 Colt type of revolver, the report stated.\n\nIn a bullet, the primer is the small explosive charge that ignites the propellant, which creates the chemical reaction that pushes the bullet core out.\n\nCredit: MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nHow Could the Gun Be Fired If Baldwin Didn't Pull the Trigger?\n\nIn an August 16 interview with Chris Cuomo, Baldwin doubled down on his stance that he did not pull the trigger.\n\n\"This did not come from me, this came from the D.A.'s Office themselves,\" the actor began. \"You're familiar with what fanning a gun is? Have you heard of that phrase, 'fanning the gun'? So, if you pull the hammer back, and you don’t lock the hammer ... if you pull the hammer back pretty far — in old Western movies you’d see someone fan the hammer of the gun — the hammer didn’t lock; you pulled it back to an extent where it would fire the bullet without you pulling the trigger, without you locking the hammer.\"\n\nHe further emphasized: \"The person who was the principal safety officer of the film declared, in front of the entire assemblage, 'This is a cold gun.'\"\n\nCredit: Larry Marano/Shutterstock\n\nWrongful Death Suit Settled\n\nIn October 2022, an undisclosed settlement was reached in a wrongful death suit filed against Baldwin and others by Hutchins' family.\n\n“We have reached a settlement, subject to court approval, for our wrongful death case against the producers of Rust, including Alec Baldwin and Rust Movie Productions, LLC. As part of that settlement, our case will be dismissed,” Hutchins’ widower, Matthew Hutchins, said in a statement to multiple outlets. He added that he had \"no interest in engaging in recriminations or attribution of blame (to the producers or Mr. Baldwin).\n\nBaldwin’s attorney, Luke Nikas, reacted to the settlement in a statement. “Throughout this difficult process, everyone has maintained the specific desire to do what is best for Halyna’s son. We are grateful to everyone who contributed to the resolution of this tragic and painful situation,” he said.\n\nProduction of Rust is set to resume in January 2023. Matthew will serve as an executive producer and receive a portion of the profits.\n\nCredit: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nThe Charges\n\nProsecutors announced in January 2023 that Baldwin and film armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed would each be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal Rust shooting.\n\n“After a thorough review of the evidence and the laws of the state of New Mexico, I have determined that there is sufficient evidence to file criminal charges against Alec Baldwin and other members of the ‘Rust’ film crew,” New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said in a statement to NBC News. “On my watch, no one is above the law, and everyone deserves justice.”\n\nCredit: Patrick Lewis/Starpix/Shutterstock\n\nBaldwin Fights Back\n\nIn February 2023, Baldwin asked the court to remove Andrea Reeb as the special prosecutor on his case because of her position in New Mexico House of Representatives. In court documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight, the actor's lawyers argued that Reeb cannot be both a state lawmaker and a special prosecutor because of the state constitution’s separation of powers provision.\n\n“Doing so vests two core powers of different branches — legislating and prosecuting — in the same person, and is thus barred by the plain language of Article III of the New Mexico Constitution,\" the motion argues before outlining what could allegedly happen in the future if Reeb is allowed to continue as the prosecutor. “Future District Attorneys could seek to curry favor with legislators who control their budgets by appointing them to high-profile cases. ... At the same time, allowing a single person to exercise both legislative and prosecutorial power could taint prosecutorial decision-making.\"\n\nCredit: Andrew H. Walker/Shutterstock\n\nWho Are Halyna Hutchins Parent’s Suing?\n\nHutchins' parents, Anatolii Androsovych and Olga Solovey, and sister Svetlana Zemko, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on February 8, 2023, against Baldwin, assistant director David Halls, armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and Rust Movie Productions, LLC, according to NBC News.\n\nThe allegations against the defendants included battery, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium. Attorney Gloria Allred described the lawsuit as a “claim which seeks to recover compensation for damages to certain relationships that are mutually dependent.”\n\nThe filing accused Baldwin of playing “Russian roulette with a loaded gun without checking it and without having the Armorer do so,” per NBC News. It also claimed that protocols on set were “ignored” and “actions that were taken were against all industry norms.”\n\nCredit: MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nFilming to Resume\n\nRust Movie Productions announced in February 2023 that Halyna's husband, Matthew, will join as an executive producer. A mix of new and old crewmembers will work on the film, and Bianca Cline will replace the late cinematographer. Cline will donate her salary to charity in Hutchins' name. No working weapons or ammunition will be allowed on set.Rust Movie Productions announced in February 2023 that Halyna's husband, Matthew, will join as an executive producer.

We are honored to play a role in the realization of her vision and to carry forward her inspiring legacy through championing this film.”\n\nCredit: Santa Fe County Sheriff/MEGA\n\n3 Crew Members Sue Baldwin\n\nIn February 2023, three Rust crew members filed a lawsuit against the It's Complicated actor and the film's other producers, claiming that the fatal shooting on set caused them physical and psychological damage. The complaint alleges that the three plaintiffs suffered \"blast injuries\" as a result of their proximity to Baldwin at the time of the incident. The crew members also claimed that they continue to suffer from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.\n\n\"These injuries were caused by Defendants' failure to follow industry safety rules,\" the lawsuit claims, according to People. \"Defendants cut corners; ignored reports of multiple, unscripted firearms discharges; and persisted, rushed and understaffed, to finish the film.\"\n\nCredit: John Lamparski/Getty Images\n\nA 2nd Indictment\n\nBaldwin was indicted for a second time on charges of involuntary manslaughter, five months after the weapon was retested, Us confirmed in January 2024. The actor could serve up to 18 months in prison if he is convicted.\n\n“We look forward to our day in court,” Baldwin’s attorneys, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, said in a statement to Us at the time."
