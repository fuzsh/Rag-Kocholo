It will also help you identify gaps in the existingliterature that you could fill with your documentary film.\n\nOnce you have a solid idea for your documentary, it's crucial to think about the documentary's form, format, and structure and how you will tell the story. Who is your target audience? Is your documentary subject great for a traditional talking-heads-style documentary, or will you incorporate animation, stock footage, archival footage, or other visual elements?\n\nWill it have a linear structure, or will it be more experimental? Will it have a feature film length, or will it be a short documentary? These are all critical questions to consider as you develop your idea further.\n\nFinally, it's important to remember that the process of coming up with great documentary ideas is an iterative one. You may come up with an interesting documentary idea that you initially think is great, only to find that it doesn't quite work once you start filming.\n\nThis is okay, and it's essential to be flexible and open to change as you move through the documentary filmmaking process. With creativity, research, and perseverance, you can create an excellent documentary that captivates audiences and leaves a lasting impact.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Making Documentaries (FAQs)\n\nWhat is a documentary?\n\nA documentary is a non-fiction film or video that presents a real-world subject or event and can be informative, educational, or persuasive.\n\nWhat are the different types of documentaries?\n\nThere are many different types of documentaries, including:\n\nObservational\n\nParticipatory\n\nExpository\n\nPoetic\n\nReflexive\n\nSome documentaries focus on a specific topic or subject, while others take a more general approach.\n\nWhat are some good ideas for a documentary?\n\nSome popular subjects for documentary filmmaking include current events, social issues, historical events, biographies, science and technology, and the environment.\n\nYou could also consider exploring a subculture or community you're interested in or telling the story of an individual who has achieved something remarkable.
