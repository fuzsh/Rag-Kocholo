        "text": "A woman has been arrested for the fatal shooting of Michael Latt, the founder of entertainment marketing firm Lead With Love.\n\nThe 33-year-old was shot in his Miracle Mile home on Monday night and died after being transported to a hospital. Latt was the son of Michelle Satter, the founding senior director at the Sundance Institute, and film producer David Latt. His brother, Franklin, is an agent at CAA.\n\n“Our beloved son Michael Latt fell victim to a tragic act of violence this week,” wrote Satter in a post on X (formerly Twitter). “Michael devoted his career to supporting artists, championing organizations that raised up artists of color and leveraged storytelling for enduring change. We celebrate his legacy, love and compassion.”\n\nOn Thursday, Jameelah Elena Michl was charged with the killing of Latt. She faces one count of murder and another count of first-degree residential burglary, with a maximum sentence of life in prison. Her arraignment is scheduled for Dec. 15. The prosecution is recommending that the 36-year-old Los Angeles resident be held on a $3 million bail.\n\n“Our hearts ache for the loss of a passionate advocate who believed in the principles of justice and equity within our criminal legal system,” L.A. District Attorney George Gascón said in a statement. “It is devastating to see a life cut short, especially one dedicated to fighting for a more just society.”\n\nThe filing of charges came a day after the L.A. Police Department put out a news release saying Michl had been arrested. She allegedly went to Latt’s house, forcing her way into the residence, after she targeted him for being friends with a woman she had been stalking, then shot Latt with a handgun.\n\nAn L.A. native who went to Chapman University, Latt founded Lead with Love with the focus on promoting the work of underrepresented creatives in entertainment. He worked with filmmakers Ryan Coogler, Barry Jenkins, Ava DuVernay and Raoul Peck, actor-musician Common and visual artist Glenn Kaino, with the Frieze Art Fair and the DGA and with such companies as Netflix and the Emerson Collective.\n\nLead to Love also worked on impact campaigns and with nonprofits that include Black Girls Rock and Vote to Live.\n\n“The moment I realized that I could use my skill set for social good, I decided to dedicate the rest of my career to helping others, empowering storytellers of color and fighting injustice wherever it stands,” Latt once said.\n\n“He dedicated his career to serving others, employing storytelling, art and various mediums to create enduring change and galvanizing communities with hope, love and inspiration,” reads a statement from the Sundance Institute. “Michael will never be forgotten and his legacy and work will carry on through his family, his friends and his colleagues.”\n\nHe also worked in marketing on films including Fruitvale Station (2013), I Am Not Your Negro (2016), Till (2022) and Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).\n\nFollowing the news of Latt’s death, those from the entertainment community posted tributes of social media. “I cannot even begin to express what we’ve lost with Michael Latt’s murder. He was the absolute best of us,” wrote Black List founder Franklin Leonard on X.\n\nSaid Franklin Latt in a statement: “Michael was my baby brother and best friend. We traveled the world together, spoke every day and were always looking toward what our next adventure would be. To know Michael was to understand that he lived his life with intention. The outpouring of love and support from all those he touched has been gratifying for our family beyond words.”\n\nSurvivors also include his grandmother, Helen, and his fiancée, Hannah. His family said that contributions in his memory to support his social justice work be made when they have set up his Legacy Fund. Details on memorial services will be available soon."
