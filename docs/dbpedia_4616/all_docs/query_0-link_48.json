        "text": "The gunman who carried out a series of shootings in California that left six people dead is Elliot Rodger, the son of a Hollywood film director, police have confirmed.\n\nWitnesses reported seeing a black BMW speeding through the streets and spraying bullets at people and other targets in the beachside community of Isla Vista, where many college students live, on Friday night (local time).\n\nSheriff Bill Brown confirmed that the 22-year-old Rodger - the son of The Hunger Games second unit director Peter Rodger - was the only suspect.\n\nRodger was a student of Santa Barbara City College and lived in Isla Vista.\n\nIn a video that was uploaded to the internet before the shootings, Rodger repeatedly complained of loneliness and rejection from women and outlined his plan for a \"day of retribution\".\n\nPolice said he killed three people in his apartment, apparently by stabbing them, before heading to the Alpha Phi sorority at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), where he fatally shot two women.\n\n\"Fortunately, no-one opened the door [at the sorority],\" Sheriff Brown said.\n\n\"Shortly afterwards witnesses reported seeing three young women who were standing outside in the vicinity shot by the suspect from across the street.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"Two of those victims were fatally wounded and one, thankfully, is still alive.\n\n\"The two victims who were killed were [Katie] Cooper, a 22-year-old, and Veronica Weiss, a 19-year-old.\"\n\nSheriff Brown said Rodger was armed with three handguns, which had been legally purchased, and 41 loaded magazines.\n\nHe shot dead Christopher Michael-Martinez, 20, who was a UCSB student, at a nearby delicatessen.\n\nHe then got into his car and drove around the area, shooting at a number of pedestrians and hitting two cyclists, police said.\n\n\"There were a total of seven fatalities - six innocent victims and one suspect,\" Sheriff Brown said.\n\n\"An additional 13 people were injured. Eight of those individuals sustained gunshot wounds.\"\n\nStephen Kaminski, the director of trauma services at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, said four of those injured had been treated and released from hospital.\n\n\"Seven injured victims were transported to our trauma centre at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital where they remain in our care,\" he said.\n\n\"Of those seven, two patients are in good condition, three patients are in fair condition and two patients are in serious condition.\"\n\nRodger was found dead inside his crashed car of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, Sheriff Brown said.\n\nGunman outlined plans in video, manifesto posted online\n\nIn a video uploaded to YouTube that has since been taken down, Rodger said he wanted to \"punish\" women for rejecting him.\n\n\"This is my last video, it all has to come to this,\" Rodger said in the video.\n\n\"Tomorrow is the day of retribution. The day on which I will have my revenge against humanity.\n\n\"I am 22 years old and I'm still a virgin. I've never even kissed a girl.\n\n\"I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. It's an injustice, a crime.\n\n\"I will take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you, you will finally see that I am the truthful superior one â€“ the true alpha male.\"\n\nIn a 140-page manifesto, My Twisted World - The Story of Elliot Rodger, which has been published online, he outlined his plans for the attack.\n\n\"My orchestration of the day of retribution is my attempt to do everything in my power to destroy everything I cannot have,\" the manifesto said.\n\n\"All of those beautiful girls I've desired so much in my life but can never have because they despise and loathe me, I will destroy.\n\n\"All of those popular people who live hedonistic lives of pleasure, I will destroy, because they never accepted me as one of them.\n\n\"I will kill them all and make them suffer, just as they have made me suffer. It is only fair.\"\n\nA lawyer representing his family said police were called weeks ago after Rodger posted alarming YouTube videos about murder and suicide.\n\n\"We offer our deepest, compassionate sympathy to the families involved in this terrible tragedy,\" lawyer Alan Shifman said on behalf of the family.\n\n\"We are experiencing the most inconceivable pain and our hearts go out to everyone involved.\"\n\nMr Shifman said Rodger had been diagnosed as being a highly functional Asperger's syndrome child and had been treated by multiple professionals.\n\n\"[The shootings are] obviously the work of a madman,\" Sheriff Brown said, later adding it was \"very, very apparent [Rodger] was severely mentally disturbed\".\n\nFather of victim slams lenient US gun laws\n\nHundreds of college students later staged a vigil in memory of the victims.\n\nThe killings have prompted Richard Martinez, the father of one of the victims, Christopher Martin-Martinez, to call for stricter gun controls.\n\n\"Our son Christopher and six others are dead. Our family has a message for every parent out there: you don't think it will happen to your child until it does,\" he said.\n\n\"Chris was a really great kid, ask anyone who knew him. His death has left our family lost and broken.\n\n\"Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA [National Rifle Association].\n\n\"They talk about gun rights - what about Chris's right to live?"
