        "text": "April 20th marks the 20th anniversary of the day that two young men killed 13 people at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, and then committed suicide. At the time, it was the deadliest school shooting in United States history, eliciting a national reckoning with the country's gun laws and the realities of teenage alienation and mental illness at American high schools. The country seemed united in mourning, if divided on how to address the problem. Since Columbine, three mass shootings on school grounds have exceeded its death toll: the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007 (32 people), Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 (27 people, including the gunman), and Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, in 2018 (17 people).\n\nThat fact alone makes Gus Van Sant's brilliant 2003 film Elephant, which was loosely based on the Columbine massacre, even more harrowing now than when it was first released. In 2003, the film read as a thoughtful meditation on a terrible event in the relatively recent past. Today, it reads as a harbinger of what would become, tragically, the new normal. It's not that mass school shootings have no impact anymore – they do, certainly – but they no longer register quite like Columbine did in 1999. At this point, they are, incredibly, something that just happens (though it's debatable that they happen with any greater frequency now than before Columbine).\n\nI first saw Elephant in the theater, and while I'd admired Gus Van Sant's work since I saw his 1989 film Drugstore Cowboy, when I was 14, I was skeptical of any dramatization of Columbine. Like 9/11 would two years later, Columbine left me shaken, but not scared or angry or even worried that something like it might happen again. It caused me to reflect on my own high school experience just a handful of years earlier, my own moments of teen angst and depression, and the kids I knew who, in retrospect, didn't seem that different from the Columbine shooters. I wondered if any of them might have fantasized about coming to school with an arsenal of weapons and exacting revenge on no one in particular, but rather the pain that high school had come to represent. It wasn't implausible. I was skeptical that anyone, even as skilled and sensitive a director as Van Sant, could capture such emotional gray area.\n\nI recently rewatched Elephant, after almost 16 years, and recalled that my skepticism was relieved from the opening shot. A car, seen from above, moves slowly, but erratically, through a quiet residential neighborhood. It's fall and the leaves are beginning to turn. Tracking the car from behind, the shot feels unhurried and foreboding, but also calm and oddly beautiful. It's a shot that will be replicated inside the high school when we meet Elephant's principal characters, a seemingly random assortment of suburban teenage archetypes: the artist, the jock, the popular girls, the outcast.\n\nA steadicam follows each of them from behind as they move through the halls, effectively putting them all, regardless of their status, on a neutral plane. It's at once familiar and mysterious, intimate and removed. The technique invites us in as detached observers, like ghosts with firsthand knowledge of every contour of that peculiar world, both psychic and physical. Van Sant introduces the two gunmen the same way. These aren't monsters; they're just kids, like the others.\n\nVan Sant borrowed both the title, Elephant, and the long tracking shots from a 1989 short film about killings that were being carried out in Northern Ireland by the IRA. Directed by Alan Clarke for the BBC Ireland, the film received critical acclaim for its minimalist style and unsparing depiction of the senseless violence taking place at the time, and for its refusal to suggest easy answers to the problem. \"[It] offers no justification or resolution for any of this, challenging viewers to find meaning in its domino chain of violence,\" wrote Rumsey Taylor of Clarke's film in 2017.\n\nThe same could be said of Van Sant's Elephant, whose title, the director has said, comes from the parable about three blind men and an elephant: Ask each of them to touch a different part of the elephant's body and then to describe what the animal looks like. Each will give a radically different account. It also refers to the proverbial \"elephant in the room,\" a problem that everyone sees but won't talk about.\n\nVan Sant initially planned to make a documentary about the Columbine massacre, but abandoned the idea in favor of a narrative film. It became the second installment in his so-called \"death trilogy,\" a series of films based on real events that began with 2002's Gerry and concluded with 2005's Last Days. He cast kids with no professional training in the main roles and, with cinematographer Harris Savides, shot the film in a suburb of Portland, Oregon, during the fall of 2002. It's damp, grey and muted. There is no formal structure or plot, the pacing is slow, and the action is mostly banal. Even scenes of the two gunmen planning the attack feel unremarkable. They eat pancakes, watch T.V. and research guns online. There's very little backstory, for any of the film's characters. We learn about them through their interactions and their context. They, like the cameras that track them, seem to float in a state of bored indifference. As the impending violence draws near, that tone barely changes. By the time the gunmen unleash their terror on the school, it feels almost ordinary.\n\nIn the years since Columbine, many myths about the shooters have been debunked. They weren't part of a \"trench coat mafia\" with a vendetta against school athletes and Christians. They weren't even, necessarily, the loners media reports made them out to be. \"Horrors like Columbine terrify us, and we need an explanation,\" said Dave Cullen, the author of a book about that event, in a 2015 New York Times Retro Report. \"So even if we don't have an answer, we find one. And we find it, really, too fast.\"\n\nGus Van Sant seems to have implicitly understood this, and that may be why Elephant still has such power. It doesn't rely on cheap tropes to milk emotions or reinforce easy narratives about the Columbine massacre. There are no villains, per se, but just kids. This is not to say the film isn't terrifying. Rather, it's terrifying precisely because it is so ordinary.\n\nPerhaps this is also why no mass shooting since Columbine, whether at a school or a church or a synagogue or a nightclub, has had quite the same collective impact. It's become routine, and we are no longer united in mourning, but divided by cacophony. There are protests and think pieces and counter-protests and political feuds, but no consensus on how to prevent the next one. Elephant offers a rare reprieve from all the noise. In 2003, it asked us to reflect on a singular and terrible event, and to reframe it as a national tragedy without a clear solution. Today, it reminds us that we may never find one."
