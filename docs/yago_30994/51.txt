Kronprinz Ludwig, later King Ludwig I, married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen on October 12, 1810.

The citizens of Munich were invited to attend the festivities held on the fields in front of the city gates to celebrate the royal event.

The fields were named Theresienwiese, meaning “Theresa's Meadow”, in honour of the Crown Princess.

The fields have kept that name ever since, although the locals have since abbreviated the name simply to the "Wiesn".

Since 1850, the parade has become an annual event and an important component of the Oktoberfest.

Nearly 10,000 people, mostly from Bavaria, dressed in traditional costumes and walk from Maximilian Street through the centre of Munich to the Oktoberfest grounds.

At the 100th anniversary of Oktoberfest in 1910, an estimated 120,000 litres of beer were consumed.

Three years later, the "Bräurosl" was founded, which at that time was the largest pavilion to have ever been built, accommodating approximately 12,000 people.
