        "text": "The recently opened Rosewood Munich has introduced five new residence-style accommodations: König Maximilian I House, Prinzessin Augusta House, Prinzregent Luitpold House, König Ludwig I House, and Prinzessin Ferdinande House.\n\nThe house names pay homage to the history of the Bavarian royal family, infusing the hotel with a touch of cultural heritage while offering exclusive spaces for overnight experiences and private events.\n\nDesigned by Tara Bernerd & Partners, who reimagined the entire property, each house features exquisite furnishings and works by local artists, and boasts personalized butler service.\n\nA curated collection of furniture and classical architectural elements recall a traditional Bavarian home, with materials like traditional Nymphenburg porcelain.\n\nSuites are also adorned with a selection of historical literature on the namesakes of the houses to provide guests with additional insight into the destination and history of Wittelsbach.\n\nKönig Maximilian I. House\n\nThe König Maximilian I. House is named for King Maximilian I. Joseph, the first king of Bavaria in 1806, and is the largest suite at Rosewood Munich. The signature suite features a bright, wood-paneled living area, fully equipped kitchen, inviting courtyard balcony, and large dining table that can accommodate up to 12.\n\nPrinzessin Augusta House\n\nPrincess Augusta Wilhelmine Marie, to whom the second-largest house is dedicated, was married to King Maximilian I. An elegant bedroom and Italian marble-adorned bathroom is complemented by a private rooftop terrace with views over Munich’s old town.\n\nPrinzregent Luitpold House\n\nPrince Regent Luitpold, son of King Ludwig I and Princess Therese, was born during a time of great cultural flourishing in Munich. The Prinzregent Luitpold House features a bedroom with a spacious walk-in closet along with a marble bathroom, fully equipped kitchenette, and intimate living area.\n\nPrinzessin Ferdinande House\n\nThe Prinzessin Ferdinande House pays tribute to Augusta Ferdinande, the Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Tuscany. A blend of modern elegance and urban luxury, the accommodation boasts a floating glass bridge that offers a view of Salvatorstraße.\n\nKönig Ludwig I House\n\nKönig Ludwig I. House is an ode to the start of the Oktoberfest tradition with the marriage of King Ludwig I of Bavaria and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen in 1810. The accommodation occupies the uppermost floor of Rosewood Munich, and features high ceilings and large windows, along with a cozy fireplace and an expansive outdoor terrace, which features two statues preserved from the building’s original façade."
