        "text": "Ludwig I (August 25, 1786 – February 29, 1868) was King of Bavaria from 1825 until the 1848 revolutions in the German states.\n\nCrown Prince\n\nBorn in the Zweibrücker Hof in Straßburg as Prince Ludwig Karl August of Pfalz-Birkenfeld-Zweibrücken, he was the son of Prince-Elector Maximilian IV Joseph of Zweibrücken (later King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria) by his first wife Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt, the fourth daughter and ninth child of Prince Georg Wilhelm of Hesse-Darmstadt (second son of Ludwig VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt) and Countess Maria Louise Albertine of Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg.\n\nAt the time of his birth, Prince Ludwig’s father was an officer in the French army stationed at Strasbourg. He was the godson and namesake of King Louis XVI of France and Navarre.\n\nOn April 1, 1795 his father succeeded Ludwig’s uncle, Charles II, as Duke of Zweibrücken, and on February 16, 1799 became Prince-Elector Maximilian IV Joseph of Bavaria and Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Arch-Steward of the Empire, and Duke of Berg on the extinction of the Sulzbach line with the death of the Prince-Elector Charles Theodore. His father assumed the title of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria on January 1, 1806.\n\nAs Crown Prince, Ludwig married on October 12, 1854, Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen (8 July 1792 – 26 October 1854; a daughter of Friedrich, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen and Duchess Charlotte Georgine of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, eldest daughter of Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nIn 1809, Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen was on the list of possible brides for Napoleon. The wedding between her and Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria was the occasion of the first ever Oktoberfest.\n\nWhen Ludwig was Crown Prince, he was involved in the Napoleonic Wars. As king Ludwig I of Bavaria, he encouraged Bavaria’s industrialization, initiating the Ludwig Canal between the rivers Main and the Danube. In 1835, the first German railway was constructed in his domain, between the cities of Fürth and Nuremberg, with his Bavaria joining the Zollverein economic union in 1834.\n\nAfter the July Revolution of 1830 in France, Ludwig’s previous liberal policy became increasingly repressive; in 1844, Ludwig was confronted during the Beer riots in Bavaria.\n\nDuring the revolutions of 1848 the King faced increasing protests and demonstrations by the students and the middle classes. The king had ordered to close the university in February, and on March 4, a large crowd assaulted the Armory to storm the Munich Residenz.\n\nLudwig’s brother Prince Charles managed to appease the protesters, but the royal family and the Cabinet now turned against Ludwig. He had to sign the so-called “March Proclamation” with substantial concessions. On March 16, 1848 it was followed by renewed unrest because Lola Montez had returned to Munich after a short exile.\n\nLudwig had to let her be searched by the police on March 17, which was the worst humiliation for him.\n\nNot willing to rule as a constitutional monarch, Ludwig abdicated on March 20, 1848 in favour of his eldest son, Maximilian. He became King Maximilian II of Bavaria.\n\nLudwig lived for another twenty years after his abdication and remained influential. An admirer of ancient Greece and the Italian Renaissance, Ludwig patronized the arts and commissioned several neoclassical buildings, especially in Munich. He was an avid collector of arts, amassing paintings from the Early German and Early Dutch periods as well as Graeco-Roman sculptures.\n\nAll living legitimate agnatic members of the House of Wittelsbach descend from him.\n\nCaroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach (March 1, 1683 – November 20, 1737) was Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and Princess-Electress of Hanover and Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg from June 11,1727 until her death in 1737 as the wife of King George II of Great Britain and Ireland and Prince-Elector of Hanover and Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg\n\nPrincess Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach was born on March 1, 1683 at Ansbach, the daughter of Margave Johann Friedrich Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach, (of the House of Hohenzollern) and his second wife, Princess Eleonore Erdmuthe of Saxe-Eisenach.\n\nHer father was the ruler of the Principality of Ansbach, one of the smallest German states of the Holy Roman Empire; he died of smallpox at the age of 32, when Princess Caroline was three years old.\n\nPrincess Caroline and her only full sibling, her younger brother Margrave Wilhelm Friedrich of Brandenburg-Ansbach, left Ansbach with their mother, who returned to her native Eisenach.\n\nIn 1692, Princess Caroline’s widowed mother was pushed into an unhappy marriage with Elector Johann Georg IV of Saxony, and she and her two children moved to the Saxon court at Dresden.\n\nThe union proved to be unsuccessful; Prince-Elector Johann Georg IV lived openly with his mistress, Magdalene Sibylle “Billa” of Neidschutz and she became the first ever Official Mistress of a Prince-Elector of Saxony;\n\nAfter Princess Caroline was orphaned at a young age, she moved to the enlightened court of her guardians, King Friedrich I in Prussia and his wife Princess Sophia Charlotte of Hanover, the only daughter of Prince-Elector Ernest August of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and his wife Princess Sophia of the Palatinate of the Rhine.\n\nPrincess Sophia Charlotte of Hanover was the sister of Prince-Elector Georg Ludwig of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, future King of Great Britain.\n\nAt the Prussian court, Princess Caroline’s previously limited education was widened and she adopted the liberal outlook possessed by Princess Sophia Charlotte, who became her good friend and whose views influenced Princess Caroline all her life.\n\nWhen she was a young woman, Princess Caroline was much sought-after as a bride. After rejecting the suit of Archduke Charles of Austria, a claimant to the Spanish throne and future Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI.\n\nPrincess Caroline eventually married Prince Georg August of Hanover who was third in line to the English throne (and subsequently the British throne) and heir apparent to the Electorate of Hanover.\n\nPrince Georg August of Hanover was the son of Prince-Elector Georg Ludwig of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and nephew of her friend Princess Sophia Charlotte of Hanover and Queen in Prussia.\n\nThey had eight children, seven of whom reached adulthood. Caroline moved to Britain permanently in 1714 when her husband became Prince of Wales. As Princess of Wales she joined Prince George Augustus, Prince of Wales, in rallying political opposition to his father, King George I.\n\nIn 1717, after a family row, Prince George Augustus, the Prince of Wales was expelled from court. Caroline came to be associated with Robert Walpole, an opposition politician who was a former government minister. Walpole rejoined the government in 1720, and Prince George Augustus reconciled publicly with his father on Walpole’s advice. Over the next few years Walpole rose to become the leading minister.\n\nUpon her husband’s accession in 1727, as King George II of Great Britain and Ireland, Caroline became Queen and Princess-Electress of Hanover, and her eldest son, Prince Frederick Louis, Duke of Edinburgh, became Prince of Wales.\n\nPrince Frederick Louis, the Prince of Wales, was a focus for the opposition, like his father before him, and Caroline’s relationship with him was strained.\n\nAs Princess and as Queen, Caroline was known for her political influence, which she exercised both through and for Walpole. Her tenure included four regencies, which occurred during King George II’s stays in Hanover; she is credited with strengthening the House of Hanover’s place in Britain during a period of political instability. After her death in 1737, Caroline was widely mourned by her political allies as well as by the King, who refused to remarry.\n\nHenry Frederick, Prince of Wales, KG (February 19, 1594 – November 6, 1612), was the eldest son and heir apparent of King James I-VI of England, Scotland and Ireland; and his wife Princess Anne of Denmark, the second daughter of King Frederik II of Denmark and Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nHis name derives from his grandfathers: Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley; and King Frederik II of Denmark. Prince Henry was widely seen as a bright and promising heir to his father’s thrones.\n\nPrince Henry was born at Stirling Castle, Scotland, and became Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland automatically on his birth.\n\nKing James VI worried that the mother’s tendency toward Catholicism might affect the son. The child’s removal to Stirling caused enormous tension between Anne and James, and Henry remained there under the care of Mar’s family until 1603.\n\nKing James VI wrote a note to the Earl of Mar in June 1595 instructing him, in the event of his death, not to deliver Prince Henry to Anne of Denmark or the Parliament of Scotland until he was 18 and gave the order himself.\n\nKing James VI of Scotland became King James I of England and Ireland in 1603 at the Union of the Crowns and his family moved south. Anne of Denmark came to Stirling to collect her son, and after an argument with the Prince’s keepers, Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar and the Master of Mar, was allowed to take Prince Henry to Edinburgh on May 28. On the following Sunday Anne took him to St Giles Kirk in her famous silver coach. Anne and Henry arrived in England, at the fortified town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, on June 1.\n\nWith his father’s accession to the throne of England in 1603, Prince Henry at once became Duke of Cornwall. In 1610 he was further invested as Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, thus for the first time uniting the six automatic and two traditional Scottish and English titles held by heirs-apparent to the two thrones.\n\nThe prince’s popularity rose so high that it threatened his father. Relations between the two could be tense, and on occasion surfaced in public. At one point, they were hunting near Royston when James criticised his son for lacking enthusiasm for the chase, and initially moved to strike his son with his cane, but Prince Henry rode off. Most of the hunting party then followed the son.\n\nPrince Henry is said to have disliked his younger brother, Prince Charles, and to have teased him, although this derives from only one anecdote: when Prince Charles was nine years of age, Prince Henry snatched the hat off a bishop and put it on the younger child’s head, then told his younger brother that when he became king he would make Prince Charles Archbishop of Canterbury, and then Prince Charles would have a long robe to hide his ugly rickety legs. Prince Charles stamped on the cap and had to be dragged off in tears.\n\nPrince Henry died from typhoid fever at the age of 18, during the celebrations that led up to his sister Elizabeth’s wedding to Prince-Elector Friedrich V of the Palatinate of the Rhine (The diagnosis can be made with reasonable certainty from written records of the post-mortem examination, which was ordered to be carried out in order to dispel rumours of poisoning.) It was reported that his last words were to ask for his sister Princess Elizabeth.\n\nAfter Henry’s death, the prince’s brother Charles fell ill, but he was the chief mourner at the funeral, which King James (who detested funerals) refused to attend. The body lay in state at St. James’s Palace for four weeks.\n\nOn December 17, over a thousand people walked in the mile-long cortège to Westminster Abbey to hear a two-hour sermon delivered by George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury. As Henry’s body was lowered into the ground, his chief servants broke their staves of office at the grave.\n\nPrince Henry’s death was widely regarded as a tragedy for the nation. According to Charles Carlton, “Few heirs to the English throne have been as widely and deeply mourned as Prince Henry.”\n\nHenry’s titles of Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay passed to Prince Charles, who until then had lived in Henry’s shadow. Four years later Prince Charles, by then 16 years old, was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.\n\nHad the Prince of Wales lived to succeed the thrones, he would have become King Henry IX of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nErich I, the Elder (February 16, 1470 – July 30, 1540) was Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg from 1495 and the first reigning Prince of Calenberg-Göttingen.\n\nAncestry\n\nErich I was born on February 16, 1470 in Neustadt am Rübenberge at the Castle of Rovenburg. Son of Wilhelm IV, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Princess Elizabeth of Stolberg-Wernigerode.\n\nErich I was the founder of the Calenberg line of the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg. His father, Duke Wilhelm IV, died in 1503, but had already divided his lands in 1495, between his sons, Heinrich and Erich.\n\nErich I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg was given the Principalities of Calenberg and Göttingen, whilst his elder brother, Heinrich IV, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg received the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Even as a boy, Erich had travelled as a pilgrim to Jerusalem and toured Italy before he entered the service of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nFirst marriage of Erich I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg was to Princess Catherine of Saxony, the eldest child of Duke Albrecht III of Saxony and his wife, the Bohemian princess Sidonie of Poděbrady.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Prince-Elector Friedrich III of Saxony and Archduchess Margaret of Austria, daughter of the Habsburg Duke Ernst the Iron. Her maternal grandparents were King George of Poděbrady and his first wife Kunigunde of Sternberg.\n\nAt the age of 16, in 1484 at the Innsbruck court, Princess Catherine of Saxony’s first marriage was as the second wife of Archduke Sigismund, who was already 56 years old and regarded as senile.\n\nThe Archduke Sigismund had previously been married to Princess Eleanor of Scotland, a daughter of King James I of Scotland and Joan Beaufort, a daughter of John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, a legitimised son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster (son of King Edward III of England) by his mistress (and later third wife) Katherine Swynford.\n\nPrincess Eleanor of Scotland left Archduke Sigismund no surviving children. Likewise, the marriage of Princess Catherine and Archduke Sigismund remained childless.\n\nArchduke Sigismund gave up his Tyrolean possessions to his cousin Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich III. With his resignation in 1490, his wife Catherine had significantly less income than before. In 1496 Sigismund died.\n\nSoon after the Archduke ‘s death, in 1496, Catherine married the Welf Duke Erich I of Brunswick-Lüneburg, ruler over the Principality of Calenberg-Göttingen. The marriage produced one short-lived daughter, Princess Anna Maria of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nAfter Princess Catherine’s death on July 7, 1525 the 55 year old Duke Erich I of Brunswick-Lüneburg married the 15-year-old Princess Elisabeth of Brandenburg, the third child and second daughter of the Prince-Elector Joachim I of Brandenburg and his wife Princess Elisabeth of Denmark. She was educated in a strictly religious and humanist fashion.\n\nFrom this marriage resulted his long-awaited successor Duke Eric II (1528–1584).\n\nWhen, in 1528, Elisabeth fell ill in bed when she was pregnant, she held the witchcraft of her husband’s mistress, Anna Rumschottel, responsible. She persuaded her husband to hold a trial. In the process, several women were burned to death, but Duke Erich I allowed his mistress to escape. She was however later burned to death in Hamelin.\n\nIn 1540, just under 23 years after the Martin Luther’s posting of his theses, Duchess Elisabeth had publicly allowed communion to be taken in both kinds in a church service. From then on she and her husband followed separate confessions: Duke Erich I remained Roman Catholic, the Duchess Elisabeth became Lutheran.\n\nDuke Eric I of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Prince of Calenberg-Göttingen died on July 30, 1540 at the Reichstag in Haguenau, Alsace.\n\nHis son, Duke Eric II of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Prince of Calenberg-Göttingen, was still a child, which is why his mother, the Duchess Elisabeth, took over the reign for five years as Regent.\n\nWhen Duke Eric I died he left behind large debts, estimated at 900,000 thalers, as well as two important buildings: the Erichsburg near Dassel and the rebuilt Calenberg Castle. His funeral took place in 1541 in Hann.\n\nMünden’s St. Blasius Church, after his body was released in Haguenau one year after his death on payment of his debts. This required every subject in his duchy to pay 16 pfennigs.\n\nLudwig III (January 23, 1378 – December 30, 1436), was a Prince-Elector Palatine of the Rhine from the House of Wittelsbach in 1410–1436.\n\nPrince-Elector Ludwig III was the third son of King Ruprecht of Germany and his wife Elisabeth of Nuremberg. During his father’s campaign in Italy 1401-1402 Louis served as imperial vicar.\n\nHe succeeded his father in 1410 as Prince-Elector Ludwig III of the Palatinate of the Rhine but did not run for the German crown. The Palatinate was divided between the four of Rupert’s surviving sons. As oldest surviving son and new Prince-Elector Ludwig III received the main part, Prince Johann received Palatinate-Neumarkt, Prince Stephen received Palatinate-Simmern and Prince Otto received Palatinate-Mosbach.\n\nPrince-Elector Ludwig III was a member of the Parakeet Society and of the League of Constance. Highly cultured and religious he was a patron of the Heidelberg University. Prince-Elector Ludwig III acted as vicar for Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor and was his bearer during the Council of Constance. As such Ludwig later also executed the sentences against Jan Hus and Jerome of Prague. He also arrested Antipope John XXIII in 1415.\n\nPrince-Elector Ludwig III returned very sick from a pilgrimage in 1427 into the Holy Land which he had organized after the death of his son Ruprecht. From 1430 onwards he was almost blind and in 1435 deprived of power by his wife and her advisors. In the following year he died, in Heidelberg, and was succeeded by his son as Prince-Elector Ludwig IV Palatine of the Rhine.\n\nFamily and children\n\nPrince-Elector Ludwig III was married twice. Firstly, he married on July 6, 1402 Blanche of England (1392 – 1409), daughter of King Henry IV of England and Mary de Bohun.\n\nThey had one son Prince Ruprecht (1406 –1426). This marriage brought the Palatine Crown into the hands of the Wittelsbach.\n\nSecondly, he married on November 30, 1417 Princess Matilda of Savoy, daughter of Prince Amadeo of Savoy, Prince of Achaea and his wife Princess Catherine of Geneva.\n\nLudwig and Matilda had the following five children:\n\n1. Mathilde (1419 – 1482), married:\n\nin 1434 to Count Ludwig I of Württemberg\n\nin 1452 to Duke Albrecht VI of Austria\n\n2. Ludwig IV, Prince-Elector Palatine (1424 – 1449)\n\n3. Friedrich I, Prince-Elector Palatine (1425 – 1476)\n\n4. Rupprecht (1427 – 1480), Prince-Elector Archbishop of Cologne\n\n5. Margarete (ca. 1428 – 1466), a nun at Liebenau monastery\n\nWilhelm I (March 22, 1797 – March 9, 1888) was King of Prussia from January 2, 1861 and German Emperor from January 18, 1871 until his death in 1888. A member of the House of Hohenzollern, he was the first Head of State of a united Germany.\n\nHe was de facto Head of State of Prussia from 1858, when he became Regent for his brother King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia. During the reign of his grandson German Emperor Wilhelm II, he was known as Wilhelm the Great.\n\nPrince Wilhelm was the second son of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the fourth daughter and sixth child of Duke Charles of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and his wife Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nPrincess Louise’s father, Duke Charles, was a brother of Queen Charlotte of Great Britain the wife of King George III of Great Britain and Prince-Elector of Hanover.\n\nIn 1825 Prince Wilhelm became romantically linked with his cousin, Polish noblewoman Elisa Radziwill. In 1826, Prince Wilhelm was forced to break off the relationship by his father, who deemed it an inappropriate match.\n\nIn 1829, Prince Wilhelm married Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the daughter of Grand Duke Charles Friedrich of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, the sister of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. Incidentally, Emperor Nicholas I of Russia married Prince Wilhelm’s sister, Princess Charlotte of Prussia.\n\nPrince Wilhelm of Prussia was not expected to ascend to the throne. His grandfather, King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia died the year he was born, and his father was crowned King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia.\n\nPrince Wilhelm of Prussia fought with distinction during the War of the Sixth Coalition, and afterwards became a prominent figure within the Prussian Army. In 1840, his childless elder brother became King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, making him heir presumptive.\n\nPrince Wilhelm of Prussia played a major role in crushing the Revolutions of 1848 in Germany, although he was briefly forced into exile in England. King Friedrich Wilhelm IV suffered a stroke in 1857 and was left incapacitated, and Prince Wilhelm was formally named Prince Regent a year later. In 1861, Prince Regent Wilhelm ascended to the Prussian throne on his elder brother’s death.\n\nUpon ascension, King Wilhelm I of Prussia immediately came into conflict with the liberal Landtag over his proposed military budget. In response, he appointed Otto von Bismarck to the post of Minister President in order to force through his proposals, beginning a partnership that would last for the rest of his life.\n\nOn the foreign front, King Wilhelm oversaw Prussian victories in the Second Schleswig War and the Austro-Prussian War, establishing Prussia as the leading German power. In 1871, through Bismarck’s maneuvers, the unification of Germany was achieved following the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nOn January 18, 1871 King Wilhelm I of Prussia is proclaimed German Emperor Wilhelm in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles (France) towards the end of the Franco-Prussian War. King Wilhelm already had the title of German Emperor since the constitution of January 1, 1871, but he had hesitated to accept the title.\n\nThe proclamation of King Wilhelm I of Prussia as German Emperor occurred on the 170th anniversary of the coronation of his Great-Great-Great-Great Grandfather, King Friedrich I in Prussia in Königsberg.\n\nEven though he had considerable power as German Emperor, Wilhelm largely left the affairs of the state to Bismarck. Later in life he was the target of multiple failed assassination attempts, which enabled Bismarck to push through a series of anti-socialist laws.\n\nIn 1888, which came to be known as the Year of the Three Emperors, German Emperor Wilhelm I died at the age of 90 after a short illness and was succeeded by his son Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, who became German Emperor Friedrich III, already suffering from cancer, died 99 days later and the throne passed to German Emperor Wilhelm II.\n\nPrince Friedrich of Brandenburg was the third son of Prince-Elector Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg by his father’s first marriage to Princess Louise Henrange-Nassau, eldest daughter of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange and Amalia of Solms-Braunfels. His maternal cousin was King William III-II of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nUpon the death of his father on April 29, 1688, Prince Friedrich of Brandenburg became Prince-Elector Friedrich III of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia.\n\nThe Hohenzollern state was then known as Brandenburg-Prussia. The family’s main possessions were the Margraviate of Brandenburg within the Holy Roman Empire and the Duchy of Prussia outside of the Empire, ruled as a personal union.\n\nAlthough he was the Margrave and Prince-Elector of Brandenburg and the Duke of Prussia, Friedrich desired the more prestigious title of king. However, according to Germanic law at that time, no kingdoms could exist within the Holy Roman Empire, with the exception of the Kingdom of Bohemia which belonged to the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nPrince-Elector Friedrich persuaded Emperor Leopold I to allow Prussia to be elevated to a kingdom by the Crown Treaty of November 16, 1700. This agreement was ostensibly given in exchange for an alliance against King Louis XIV of France and Navarre in the War of the Spanish Succession and the provision of 8,000 Prussian troops to Leopold’s service.\n\nPrince-Elector Friedrich III argued that Prussia had never been part of the Holy Roman Empire, and he ruled over it with full sovereignty. Therefore, he said, there was no legal or political barrier to letting him rule it as a kingdom. Prince-Elector Friedrich III was aided in the negotiations by Charles Ancillon.\n\nFriedrich crowned himself on January 18, 1701 in Königsberg. Although he did so with the Emperor’s consent, and also with formal acknowledgement from Augustus II the Strong, Prince-Elector of Saxony, who held the title of King of Poland, the Polish-Lithuanian Diet (Sejm) raised objections, and viewed the coronation as illegal.\n\nIn fact, according to the terms of the Treaty of Wehlau and Bromberg, the House of Hohenzollern’s sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia was not absolute but contingent on the continuation of the male line (in the absence of which the duchy would revert to the Polish crown). Therefore, out of deference to the region’s historic ties to the Polish Crown, Friedrich made the symbolic concession of calling himself “King in Prussia” instead of “King of Prussia”.\n\nHis royalty was, in any case, limited to Prussia and did not reduce the rights of the Emperor in the portions of his domains that were still part of the Holy Roman Empire. In other words, while he was a King in Prussia, he was still only an elector under the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Emperor in Brandenburg. Legally, the Hohenzollern state was still a personal union between Brandenburg and Prussia.\n\nHowever, by the time Friedrich crowned himself as king, the emperor’s authority over Brandenburg (and the rest of the empire) was only nominal, and in practice it soon came to be treated as part of the Prussian kingdom rather than as a separate entity. His grandson, Friedrich II the Great, was the first Prussian king formally to style himself “King of Prussia” (from 1772 onwards).\n\nFriedrich I, the Belligerent or the Warlike (April 11, 1370 – January 4, 1428), a member of the House of Wettin, ruled as Margrave Friedrich IV of Meissen from 1407 and Prince-Elector Friedrich of Saxony from 1423 until his death.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Landgrave Friedrich III of Thuringia, and Catherine of Henneberg, the second of four daughters of Count Heinrich IV of Henneberg-Schleusingen and his wife Judith of Brandenburg-Salzwedel.\n\nAfter the death of his uncle Margrave Wilhelm I of Meissen in 1407, he was made governor of the Margraviate of Meissen together with his brother Margrave Wilhelm II as well as with his cousin Landgrave Friedrich IV of Thuringia (son of Balthasar), until their possessions were divided in 1410 and 1415.\n\nIn the German town war of 1388, he assisted Burgrave Friedrich V of Nuremberg, of the House of Hohenzollern, and in 1391 did the same for the Teutonic Order against King Wladislaus II of Poland. He supported Prince-Elector Ruprecht III of the Palatine of the Rhine, in his struggle with King Wenceslaus for the German throne, probably because King Wenceslaus refused to fulfill a promise to give him his sister Anna in marriage.\n\nThe danger to Germany from the Hussites induced Friedrich to ally himself with Emperor Sigismund; and he took a leading part in the war against them, during the earlier years of which he met with considerable success. For his victory at the Battle of Brüx in 1421, Friedrich was granted the ranks of Duke and Prince-Elector of Saxony.\n\nIn the prosecution of this enterprise Prince-Elector Friedrich I spent large sums of money, for which he received various places in Bohemia and elsewhere in pledge from Emperor Sigismund, who further rewarded him on January 6, 1423 with the vacant electoral Duchy of Saxony-Wittenberg; and Friedrich’s formal investiture followed at Ofen on the August 1, 1425.\n\nThus ascended Margrave Friedrich IV, who called himself Prince-Elector Friedrich I now as Duke and Prince-Elector of Saxony. Thus spurred to renewed efforts against the Hussites, the elector was endeavouring to rouse the German princes to aid him in prosecuting this war when the Saxon army was almost annihilated at Aussig on the August 16, 1426.\n\nAfter the death of his brother Margrave Wilhelm II of Meissen, Prince-Elector Friedrich became the ruler over the entire possession of the House of Wettin except Thuringia.\n\nIn 1409, Friedrich and his brother Wilhelm founded the University of Leipzig, for the benefit of German students who had left the University of Prague after the events relating to the Western Schism.\n\nPrince-Elector Friedrich I died in 1428 at Altenburg. He was buried as the first Wettin in the centre of what is now known as the Princes Chapel in Meissen Cathedral. The cathedral is now accessible to the public for a small fee and the tomb is readily seen.\n\nFamily\n\nOn February 7, 1402 Prince-Elector Friedrich I married Catherine of Brunswick-Lüneburg (d. 1442), the only daughter and second child of the Duke Heinrich I of Brunswick-Lüneburg († 1416) from his first marriage to Sophie of Pomerania († June 1400).\n\nPrince-Elector Friedrich I was succeeded by his eldest son, Prince-Elector Friedrich II of Saxony.\n\nMaximilian III Joseph, (March 28, 1727 – December 30, 1777), was a Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire and Duke of Bavaria from 1745 to 1777. He was the last of the Bavarian Branch of the House of Wittelsbach and because of his death, the War of Bavarian Succession broke out.\n\nBorn in Munich, Prince Maximilian Joseph was the eldest son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII Albrecht and his wife, Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I Princess Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nArchduchess Maria Amalia of Austria’s older sister was Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria was the eldest child of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I and Princess Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg. She was named for her father. During the reign of her grandfather, Emperor Leopold I, Archduchess Maria Josepha’s father and uncle Archduke Charles of Austria, signed the Mutual Pact of Succession of 1703, which was issued by Emperor Leopold I, and effectively made Archduchess Maria Josepha the heir presumptive to the Hereditary Habsburg Lands.\n\nHowever, Emperor Charles VI’s Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 annulled the earlier Mutual Pact of Succession of 1703 and made his daughter Archduchess Maria Theresa his successor instead of Archduchess Maria Josepha.\n\nArchduchess Maria Theresa succeeded her father, Emperor Charles VI, 1740 and was ruler of the Habsburg Hereditary until her death in 1780, and she was the only woman to hold the position suo jure (in her own right). Archduchess Maria Theresa was the sovereign of Archduchess Austria, Queen of Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia. By her marriage to Duke Franz Stephen of Lorraine, she was Duchess of Lorraine, Grand Duchess of Tuscany.\n\nHowever, the Holy Roman Empire was governed by the Salic Law which barred women from the Imperial throne. That crown was not settled and the battle for that crown was part of the War of the Austrian Succession.\n\nDuring the War of the Austrian Succession, Prince-Elector Charles Albrecht of Bavaria (father of Maximilian Joseph) invaded Upper Austria in 1741 and planned to conquer Vienna, but his allied French troops under the Duc de Belle-Isle were instead redirected to Bohemia, and Prague was conquered in November 1741.\n\nThat meant that Prince-Elector Charles Albrecht was crowned King of Bohemia in Prague on December 19, 1741, (usurping Archduchess Maria Theresa) when the Habsburgs had not yet been defeated. Prince-Elector Charles Albrecht was unanimously elected King of Germany on January 24, 1742 and became Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII Albrecht upon his coronation on February 12, 1742.\n\nHis brother Prince Clement August of Bavaria, the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, generally sided with the Habsburg-Lorraine faction in the disputes over the Habsburg succession but instead cast his vote for his brother and personally crowned him Emperor at Frankfurt.\n\nEmperor Charles VII Albrecht’s reign was brief. Emperor Charles VII Albrecht was suffering severely from gout and died at Nymphenburg Palace on January 20, 1745. His brother Prince Clement August of Bavaria then leaned towards Austria, and Prince Maximilian Joseph became Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph of Bavaria but could not secure his election as Emperor.\n\nPrince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph inherited a country in the process of being invaded by Austrian armies as part of the War of the Austrian Succession.\n\nThe 18-year-old Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph wavered between the Peace-party, led by his mother Empress Maria Amalia and Army Commander Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff and the War-party, led by Foreign Minister General Ignaz Count of Törring and the French envoy Chavigny.\n\nAfter the decisive defeat in the Battle of Pfaffenhofen on April 15, 1745, Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph quickly abandoned his imperial pretenses and made peace with Empress Maria Theresa in the Treaty of Füssen, in which he agreed to support her husband, Grand Duke Franz Stephen of Tuscany, in the upcoming imperial election.\n\nArchduchess Maria Theresa secured her husband’s election as Emperor, which took place on September 13, 1745. Emperor Franz succeeded Charles VII Albrecht, and she made him co-regent of her hereditary dominions. As Consort to her husband, Emperor Franz, Maria Theresa was Empress Maria Theresa the title and name she is most known by.\n\nIn 1747, Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph married his first cousin, Princess Maria Anna Sophia of Saxony, but the marriage remained childless.\n\nMaria Anna Sophia of Saxony was a daughter of King Augustus III of Poland (also Prince-Elector Friedrich August II of Saxony) and his wife Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria who became Princess Electress of Bavaria by marriage to Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph of Bavaria.\n\nArchduchess Maria Josepha of Austria, as we have seen above, was the eldest child of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I and Princess Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nDuring the Seven Years’ War Bavarian forces then fought on the Habsburg side. Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph’s sister Princess Maria Josepha of Bavaria was married in 1765 to Empress Maria Theresa’s son Holy Emperor Joseph II. But long-term weakening of Prussia was not in the Bavarian interest, as that country offered the only counterweight to the Habsburg monarchy.\n\nPrince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph tried, as far as possible, to keep Bavaria out of the wars. Apart from militia troops, he sent only a small force of 4,000 men to join the Austrian army. In 1758/1759 (only a year and half into the war), he withdrew Bavarian auxiliary troops from Austrian service. Together with the Wittelsbach Prince-Elector Elector Charles Theodore of the Palatinate of the Rhine he enforced the neutrality of the Empire during the conflict.\n\nPrince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph was a progressive and enlightened ruler who did much to improve the development of his country. He encouraged agriculture, industry, and exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country, and abolished the Jesuit censorship of the press. In 1747 the Nymphenburg Porcelain Factory was established, while the Codex Maximilianeus bavaricus civilis was written in 1756. In 1759, he founded Munich’s first academic institution, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.\n\nDuring the severe famine in 1770 Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph sold some of the crown jewels to pay for grain imports to relieve hunger. In that year, he also issued an edict against the extravagant pomposity of the Church which contributed to the end of the era of Bavarian rococo. He also forbade the Oberammergau Passion Play. In 1771 the elector regulated general school attendance.\n\nIn December 1777 Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph rode in his carriage through Munich; on the ride, as he passed one of the tower clocks, the mechanism broke, and the clock struck 77 times. Commenting to the passengers, Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph decided this was an omen, and that his years had run out.\n\nWithin days, he was stricken with a strange disease. None of his 15 doctors could diagnose it, but by Christmas, it had become clear that it was a particularly virulent strain of smallpox, called “purple small pox” at the time.\n\nBy the last day of the month he was dead without leaving an heir. Prince-Elector Maximilian III Joseph is buried in the crypt of the Theatinerkirche in Munich.\n\nHis death sparked the War of the Bavarian Succession."
