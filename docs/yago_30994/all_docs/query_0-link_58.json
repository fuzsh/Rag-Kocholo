        "text": "Ludwig I (August 25, 1786 – February 29, 1868) was King of Bavaria from 1825 until the 1848 revolutions in the German states.\n\nCrown Prince\n\nBorn in the Zweibrücker Hof in Straßburg as Prince Ludwig Karl August of Pfalz-Birkenfeld-Zweibrücken, he was the son of Prince-Elector Maximilian IV Joseph of Zweibrücken (later King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria) by his first wife Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt, the fourth daughter and ninth child of Prince Georg Wilhelm of Hesse-Darmstadt (second son of Ludwig VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt) and Countess Maria Louise Albertine of Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg.\n\nAt the time of his birth, Prince Ludwig’s father was an officer in the French army stationed at Strasbourg. He was the godson and namesake of King Louis XVI of France and Navarre.\n\nOn April 1, 1795 his father succeeded Ludwig’s uncle, Charles II, as Duke of Zweibrücken, and on February 16, 1799 became Prince-Elector Maximilian IV Joseph of Bavaria and Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Arch-Steward of the Empire, and Duke of Berg on the extinction of the Sulzbach line with the death of the Prince-Elector Charles Theodore. His father assumed the title of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria on January 1, 1806.\n\nAs Crown Prince, Ludwig married on October 12, 1854, Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen (8 July 1792 – 26 October 1854; a daughter of Friedrich, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen and Duchess Charlotte Georgine of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, eldest daughter of Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nIn 1809, Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen was on the list of possible brides for Napoleon. The wedding between her and Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria was the occasion of the first ever Oktoberfest.\n\nWhen Ludwig was Crown Prince, he was involved in the Napoleonic Wars. As king Ludwig I of Bavaria, he encouraged Bavaria’s industrialization, initiating the Ludwig Canal between the rivers Main and the Danube. In 1835, the first German railway was constructed in his domain, between the cities of Fürth and Nuremberg, with his Bavaria joining the Zollverein economic union in 1834.\n\nAfter the July Revolution of 1830 in France, Ludwig’s previous liberal policy became increasingly repressive; in 1844, Ludwig was confronted during the Beer riots in Bavaria.\n\nDuring the revolutions of 1848 the King faced increasing protests and demonstrations by the students and the middle classes. The king had ordered to close the university in February, and on March 4, a large crowd assaulted the Armory to storm the Munich Residenz.\n\nLudwig’s brother Prince Charles managed to appease the protesters, but the royal family and the Cabinet now turned against Ludwig. He had to sign the so-called “March Proclamation” with substantial concessions. On March 16, 1848 it was followed by renewed unrest because Lola Montez had returned to Munich after a short exile.\n\nLudwig had to let her be searched by the police on March 17, which was the worst humiliation for him.\n\nNot willing to rule as a constitutional monarch, Ludwig abdicated on March 20, 1848 in favour of his eldest son, Maximilian. He became King Maximilian II of Bavaria.\n\nLudwig lived for another twenty years after his abdication and remained influential. An admirer of ancient Greece and the Italian Renaissance, Ludwig patronized the arts and commissioned several neoclassical buildings, especially in Munich. He was an avid collector of arts, amassing paintings from the Early German and Early Dutch periods as well as Graeco-Roman sculptures.\n\nAll living legitimate agnatic members of the House of Wittelsbach descend from him.\n\nDuchy of Brittany\n\nIn 1524, the Dauphin inherited the Duchy of Brittany on his mother’s death, becoming Duke François III, although the Duchy was actually ruled by officials of the French crown. In 1532, after much discourse with the Breton deputies, demands were laid before the French crown.\n\nThe Dauphin was to arrive at Rennes as Duke François III and owner of the duchy, King François I would be granted usufruct and management of it and, after the union with France, the Dauphin would sign an oath that respects the duchy’s rights and privileges.\n\nDuke François III agreed to these demand and passed an edict annexing the duchy of Brittany to France. On August 1532, 14, the Dauphin was crowned Duke François III in Rennes Cathedral.\n\nUpon King Henri II of France’s succession to the French throne in 1547, the Duchy and the crown were effectively merged, the Breton estates having already tied the succession of the Duchy to the French crown.\n\nThe Dauphin François died at the Château de Tournon on August 10, 1536, at the age of eighteen. The circumstances of his death seemed suspicious, and it is believed by many that he was poisoned. However, there is ample evidence that he died of natural causes, possibly tuberculosis.\n\nAfter playing a round of tennis at a jeu de paume court “pré[s] d’Ainay”, the Dauphin asked for a cup of water, which was brought to him by his secretary, Count Montecuccoli. After drinking it, François collapsed and died several days later.\n\nMontecuccoli, who was brought to the court by Catherine de’ Medici, was accused of being in the pay of Emperor Charles V, and when his quarters were searched a book on different types of poison was found. Catherine de’ Medici was well known to have an interest in poisons and the occult. Under torture, Montecuccoli confessed to poisoning the Dauphin and was executed.\n\nIn an age before forensic science, poison was usually suspected whenever a young healthy person died shortly after eating or drinking. There was no way to pinpoint and trace the substance after death; therefore, it was considered a quick, easy and untraceable form of homicide. There have been several other suspected cases of political murder by poison in the French royal family throughout the ages.\n\nFrançois III (February 28, 1518 – August 10, 1536) was Dauphin of France and, after 1524, Reigning Duke of Brittany.\n\nFrançois and his brother, Henri, were exchanged as hostages for their father, King François I of France, who had been captured at the Battle of Pavia. They would be hostages for three years. Made Duke of Brittany in 1532, this precipitated Brittany’s integration within the Kingdom of France. Prince François died August 10, 1536, possibly from tuberculosis.\n\nLife\n\nPrince François was the first son of King François I of France and Duchess Claude of Brittany, the eldest daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. Because of the Salic Law the throne of France went to Prince François, Count of Angoulême, the son of Prince Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed and father-in-law King Louis XII, who died without a legitimate son. Claudia inherited her mother’s Duchy upon her mother’s death.\n\nKing François I said of Prince François at birth, “a beautiful dauphin who is the most beautiful and strong child one could imagine and who will be the easiest to bring up.” His mother said, “tell the King that he is even more beautiful than himself.” The Dauphin was christened at Amboise on April 25, 1519. Leonardo da Vinci, who had been brought to Amboise by King François I, designed the decorations.\n\nOne of the most researched aspects of the Dauphin’s short life is the time he and his brother Prince Henri (later King Henri II of France) spent as hostages in Spain.\n\nThe king had been badly defeated and captured at the Battle of Pavia (1525) and became a prisoner of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (King Carlos I of Spain), initially in the Alcázar in Madrid. In order to ensure his release, the king signed the Treaty of Madrid (1526). However, in order to ensure that Francis abided by the treaty, Emperor Charles V demanded that the king’s two older sons take his place as hostages. King François agreed.\n\nOn March 15, 1526, the exchange took place at the border between Spain and France. King François almost immediately repudiated the treaty and the eight-year-old Dauphin and his younger brother Prince Henri spent the next three years as captives of Emperor Charles V, a period that scarred them for life.\n\nDuring his confinement in Spain, the Dauphin displayed a notably subdued demeanor compared to his more aggressive brother and seemed “to have accepted the rationale for his imprisonment reasonably well.” Nevertheless, the experience led him to become somewhat isolated, favoring black attire (like a Spaniard) and exhibiting a contemplative disposition seen as more Spanish than French.\n\nMarriage arrangements\n\nAs the first son and heir of the King of France, the Dauphin was a marriage pawn for his father. There were several betrothals to eligible princesses throughout the Dauphin’s life.\n\nThe first was when he was an infant, to the four-year-old Princess Mary of England (later Queen Mary I of England), daughter of Henry VIII of England and Infanta Catherine of Aragon; this arrangement was made as a surety for the Anglo-French alliance signed in October 1518, but abandoned around 1521 when Princess Mary was instead betrothed to Emperor Charles V.\n\nChristian I (February 1426 – May 21, 1481) was a German noble and Scandinavian monarch under the Kalmar Union. He was king of Denmark (1448–1481), Norway (1450–1481) and Sweden (1457–1464).\n\nFrom 1460 to 1481, he was also Duke of Schleswig (within Denmark) and Count (after 1474, Duke) of Holstein (within the Holy Roman Empire). He was the first King from the House of Oldenburg.\n\nKing Christian I was born in February 1426 in Oldenburg in Northern Germany as the eldest son of Count Dietrich of Oldenburg by his second wife, Helvig of Holstein (died 1436). Christian had two younger brothers, Maurice (1428–1464) and Gerhard (1430–1500), and one sister Adelheid.\n\nChristian’s mother, Helvig, was a daughter of Gerhard VI, Count of Holstein, and a sister of Adolphus, Duke of Schleswig.\n\nThrough his mother, Christian was also a cognatic descendant of King Eric V of Denmark through his second daughter Richeza (died 1308) and also a cognatic descendant of King Abel of Denmark through his daughter Sophie.\n\nThrough his father, Christian was a cognatic descendant of King Eric IV of Denmark through his daughter Sophia. Christian thus descended from the three surviving sons of Valdemar II and his second wife Infanta Berengaria of Portugal. He was also a cognatic descendant of King Magnus III of Sweden.\n\nIn January 1448, King Christopher III of Denmark, Sweden and Norway died suddenly and without natural heirs. His death resulted in the break-up of the union of the three kingdoms, as Denmark and Sweden went their separate ways and Norway’s affiliation was unclear.\n\nThe vacant Danish throne was first offered by the Council of the Realm to Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, being the most prominent feudal lord of Danish dominions. The duke declined and recommended his nephew, Count Christian of Oldenburg.\n\nBefore being elected, Christian had to promise to obey the Constitutio Valdemariana, a provision in the ascension promissory of King Valdemar III of Denmark, that promised that in the future, the same person could never be both ruler of the Duchy of Schleswig and Denmark simultaneously.\n\nThe council also demanded that Christian should marry dowager Queen Dorothea of Brandenburg (ca 1430–1495), widow of his predecessor King Christopher III.\n\nOn September 1, 1448, after signing his ascension promissory, Count Christian was elected to the Danish throne as King Christian I of Denmark at the assembly in Viborg.\n\nHis coronation was held on October 28, 1449, in the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen, at which occasion his marriage with dowager Queen Dorothea was also celebrated.\n\nSweden elected Carl Karl Knutsson King of Sweden with the intent to reestablish the Kalmar Union under a Swedish king.\n\nKing Carl VIII of Sweden was born in October 1408 or 1409, at Ekholmen Castle, the son of Knut Tordsson (Bonde), knight and member of the privy council (riksråd), and Margareta Karlsdotter (Sparre av Tofta), the only daughter and heiress of Carl Ulvsson, Lord of Tofta. Carl was elected King of Norway in the following year.\n\nRegnal name\n\nCarl Knutsson was the second Swedish king by the name of Carl. Carl VIII is a posthumous invention, counting backwards from Carl IX (r. 1604–1611) who adopted his numeral according to a fictitious history of Sweden. King Carl VIII was the first Swedish monarch of the name to actually use a regnal number as Carl II (later retrospectively renumbered VIII), on his wife’s tombstone (1451) at Vadstena.\n\nKing Christian I of Denmark subsequent accessions to the thrones of Norway (in 1450) and Sweden (in 1457) restored the unity of the Kalmar Union for a short period. In 1463, Sweden broke away from the union and Christian’s attempt at a reconquest resulted in his defeat by the Swedish regent Sten Sture the Elder at the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471.\n\nIn 1460, following the death of his uncle, Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, Count of Holstein, Christian also became Duke of Schleswig and Count of Holstein.\n\nIn 1474 Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich III elevated Christian I from Count of Holstein to Duke of Holstein, thus becoming an immediate imperial vassal of the Emperor.\n\nKing Christian died at Copenhagen Castle on May 21, 1481 at the age of 55. He was interred at the Chapel of the Magi at Roskilde Cathedral, a richly decorated chapel he and Queen Dorothea had erected to serve as a family sepulchral chapel for the House of Oldenburg.\n\nAlbrecht VI (February 26, 1584 – July 5, 1666) son of Duke Wilhelm V of Bavaria and Princess Renata of Lorraine, the second child and eldest daughter of Duke François I of Lorraine and his wife Princess Christina of Denmark, daughter of King Christian II of Denmark and Norway and Archduchess Isabella of Austria.\n\nPrince Albrecht was Regent of Bavaria from 1651–1654 for his young nephew Prince-Elector Ferdinand Maria of Bavaria.\n\nPrince-Elector Ferdinand Maria (October 31, 1636 – May 1679) was a Wittelsbach ruler of Bavaria and a Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire from 1651 to 1679.\n\nPrince-Elector Ferdinand Maria was born in Munich. He was the eldest son of Prince-Elector Maximilian I of Bavaria, Duke Albrecht VI ‘s older brother (whom he succeeded), and his second wife, Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II and Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria.\n\nBorn during the reign of his father, Ferdinand Maria was known as the Electoral Prince from birth. Through his mother, he was a first cousin of Queen Mariana of Spain (born an Archduchess of Austria, she married her uncle King Felipe IV of Spain) as well as Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.\n\nIn 1612 Duke Albrecht VI married Princess Mechthilde of Leuchtenberg (October 24, 1588 – June 1, 1634).\n\nThrough his wife Princess Mechthilde, Duke Albrecht VI came into possession of the Landgraviate of Leuchtenberg, which he exchanged in 1650 for the Reichsgrafschaft (county) Haag. After the death of his 3rd son Prince-Elector Maximilian Heinrich of Cologne, Haag reverted to Bavaria.\n\nDuke Albert VI’s successor in Leuchtenberg was his nephew Prince Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus of Bavaria, the second son of Prince-Elector Elector Maximilian I and his second wife, Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II and Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria. After Prince Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus’s death, Leuchtenberg was also united with Bavaria.\n\nLudwig IX (February 23, 1417 – January 18, 1479) was Duke of Bavaria-Landshut from 1450. He was a son of Duke Heinrich XVI the Rich of Bavaria-Landshut and Princess Margaret of Austria, daughter of Duke Albrecht IV of Austria and Princess Joanna Sophia of Bavaria.\n\nDuke Ludwig IX was the founder of the University of Ingolstadt (now the University of Munich).\n\nPrince Ludwig succeeded his father in 1450 as Duke Ludwig IX of Bavaria-Landshut. He was the second of the three famous rich dukes, who reigned in Bavaria-Landshut in the 15th century. Their residence was Trausnitz Castle in Landshut, a fortification which attained enormous dimensions.\n\nSince Duke Ludwig IX invaded the imperial free cities of Dinkelsbühl and Donauwörth in 1458 he disputed with Friedrich III, Holy Roman Emperor, until peace was made in Prague in 1463.\n\nIn 1462 Duke Ludwig IX defeated his enemy Margrave Albrecht III of Brandenburg, who tried to extend his influence in Franconia in the battle of Giengen. Duke Ludwig IX expelled all Jews who rejected baptism from his duchy.\n\nIn 1472 Duke Ludwig IX founded the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Ingolstadt, which was moved to Landshut in 1800 and finally to Munich.\n\nIn 1475 he organized the Landshut Wedding of his son Prince Georg with the Princess Hedwig Jagiellon, a daughter of King Casimir IV of Poland and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria.\n\nArchduchess Elisabeth of Austria was the daughter of King Albrecht II of the Romans-Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Princess Elizabeth of Luxembourg, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. The wedding was one of the most splendid festivals of the Middle Age.\n\nFamily and children\n\nOn March 21, 1452 Duke Ludwig IX was married to Princess Amalia of Saxony (April 4, 1436 – October 19, 1501), daughter of Prince-Elector Friedrich II of Saxony and Princess Margaret of Austria the eldest daughter of Duke Ernst the Iron of Inner Austria (1377–1424) and his second wife, the Piast princess Cymburgis of Masovia (1394/97–1429).\n\nThey had four children:\n\n1. Elisabeth (c. 1453 – 1457)\n\n2. Georg, Duke of Bavaria (1455 –1503)\n\n3. Margaret (1456 – 1501), married to Prince-Elector Philipp Palatine of the Rhine.\n\n4. Anna (c. 1462–1462)\n\nThe Earl of Warwick’s efforts to keep King Henry VI on the throne ultimately failed and the Earl of Warwick was killed at the battle of Barnet in April 1471. The re-instated King Edward IV restored his brother Prince George, the Duke of Clarence, to royal favour by making him Great Chamberlain of England.\n\nAs his father-in-law, the Earl of Warwick, had died, the Duke of Clarence became jure uxoris Earl of Warwick, but did not inherit the entire Warwick estate as his younger brother, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, had married (c. 1472) Anne Neville, the other daughter of Ralph Neville, the Earl of Warwick. Anne Neville, had been widowed in 1471, when her husband, Prince Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales and son of King Henry VI, was killed in battle.\n\nKing Edward IV intervened and eventually divided the estates between his brothers. The Duke of Clarence was created, Jure Uxoris (by right of his wife), first Earl of Warwick on March 25, 1472, and first Earl of Salisbury in a new creation.\n\nIn 1475 Clarence’s wife Isabel gave birth to a son, Edward Plantagenet, later Earl of Warwick. Isabel died on December 22, 1476, two months after giving birth to a short-lived son named Richard (October 5, 1476 – January 1, 1477). George and Isabel are buried together at Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire. Their surviving children, Margaret and Edward, were cared for by their aunt, Anne Neville, until she died in 1485 when Edward was 10 years old.\n\nDeath\n\nThough most historians now believe Isabel’s death was a result of either consumption or childbed fever, the Duke of Clarence was convinced she had been poisoned by one of her ladies-in-waiting, Ankarette Twynyho, whom, as a consequence, he had judicially murdered in April 1477, by summarily arresting her and bullying a jury at Warwick into convicting her of murder by poisoning.\n\nShe was hanged immediately after trial with John Thursby, a fellow defendant. She was posthumously pardoned in 1478 by King Edward IV. The Duke of Clarence’s mental state, never stable, deteriorated from that point and led to his involvement in yet another rebellion against his brother King Edward IV.\n\nIn 1477 the Duke of Clarence was again a suitor for the hand of Princess Mary, who had just become Duchess of Burgundy. King Edward IV objected to the match, and the Duke of Clarence left the court.\n\nThe arrest and committal to the Tower of London of one of the Duke of Clarence’s retainers, an Oxford astronomer named John Stacey, led to his confession under torture that he had “imagined and compassed” the death of the king, and used the black arts to accomplish this. He implicated one Thomas Burdett, and one Thomas Blake, a chaplain at Stacey’s college (Merton College, Oxford).\n\nAll three were tried for treason, convicted, and condemned to be drawn to Tyburn and hanged. Blake was saved at the eleventh hour by a plea for his life from James Goldwell, Bishop of Norwich, but the other two were put to death as ordered.\n\nThis was a clear warning to the Duke of Clarence, which he chose to ignore. He appointed John Goddard to burst into Parliament and regale the House of Commons with Burdett and Stacey’s declarations of innocence that they had made before their deaths.\n\nJohn Goddard was a very unwise choice, as he was an ex-Lancastrian who had expounded King Henry VI’s claim to the throne. King Edward IV summoned the Duke of Clarence to Windsor, severely upbraided him, accused him of treason, and ordered his immediate arrest and confinement.\n\nThe Duke of Clarence was imprisoned in the Tower of London and put on trial for treason against his brother King Edward IV. Clarence was not present – Edward himself prosecuted his brother, and demanded that Parliament pass a Bill of Attainder against his brother, declaring that he was guilty of “unnatural, loathly treasons” which were aggravated by the fact that the Duke of Clarence was his brother, who, if anyone did, owed him loyalty and love.\n\nFollowing his conviction and attainder, he was “privately executed” at the Tower on February 18, 1478, by tradition in the Bowyer Tower, and soon after the event, a false rumour spread that he had been drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine.\n\nGeorge Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence (October 21, 1449 – February 18, 1478), was the sixth child and third surviving son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville, and the brother of English kings Edward IV and Richard III.\n\nHe played an important role in the dynastic struggle between rival factions of the Plantagenets now known as the Wars of the Roses.\n\nIn 1460 the Act of Accord was issued which was an Act of the Parliament of England which was passed on October 25, 1460. Under the Act, King Henry VI of England was to retain the crown for life but Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and his heirs were to succeed him, excluding Henry’s son, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales. King Henry VI was forced to agree to the Act.\n\nThree weeks prior to the Act of Accord Prince Richard, Duke of York entered the Council Chamber and laid his hand on the empty throne.\n\nOn December 30, 1460, Prince Richard, 3rd Duke of York and his forces sortied from Sandal Castle. The larger Lancastrian force destroyed The Duke of York’s army in the resulting Battle of Wakefield. York was killed in the battle.\n\nThe precise nature of his end was variously reported; he was either unhorsed, wounded and overcome fighting to the death or captured, given a mocking crown of bulrushes and then beheaded.\n\nAfter defeating Lancastrian armies at Mortimer’s Cross and Towton in early 1461, the new Prince Edward, 4th Duke of York deposed King Henry VI and took the throne and became King of England and Lord of Ireland as King Edward IV and George was made Duke of Clarence. Despite his youth, he was appointed as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the same year.\n\nThe King’s unexpected marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464 led to conflict with his chief advisor, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, known as the “Kingmaker”.\n\nIn 1469 the Duke of Clarence married in Église Notre-Dame de Calais to Isabel Neville, the elder daughter and co-heiress of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (the Kingmaker of the Wars of the Roses), and Anne de Beauchamp, suo jure 16th Countess of Warwick.\n\nThe Duke of Clarence had actively supported his elder brother’s claim to the throne, but when his father-in-law, Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, deserted King Edward IV to ally with Princess Margaret of Anjou, Queen Consort of the deposed King Henry VI, the Duke of Clarence supported him and was deprived of his office as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.\n\nThe Duke of Clarence joined the Earl of Warwick in France, taking his pregnant wife. She gave birth to their first child, a girl, on April 16, 1470, in a ship off Calais. The child died shortly afterwards.\n\nKing Henry VI rewarded the Duke of Clarence by making him next in line to the throne after his own son, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, justifying the exclusion of King Edward IV both by Bill of Attainder for his treason against the House of Lancaster as well as his alleged illegitimacy.\n\nAllegations of illegitimacy were discounted at the time as politically inspired, and by later historians. Edward and his siblings George, Duke of Clarence, and Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy, were physically very similar, all three being tall and blonde, in contrast to their father, the Duke of York, who was short and dark. His youngest brother, who later became King Richard III, closely resembled their father.\n\nAfter a short time, the Duke of Clarence realized that his loyalty to his father-in-law was misplaced: the Earl of Warwick had his younger daughter, Anne Neville, the Duke of Clarence’s sister-in-law, marry King Henry VI’s so, Prince Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales in December 1470.\n\nThis demonstrated that his father-in-law was less interested in making him King than in serving his own interests and, since it now seemed unlikely that Warwick would replace King Edward IV with the Duke of Clarence, Clarence was secretly reconciled with Edward.\n\nErich I, the Elder (February 16, 1470 – July 30, 1540) was Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg from 1495 and the first reigning Prince of Calenberg-Göttingen.\n\nAncestry\n\nErich I was born on February 16, 1470 in Neustadt am Rübenberge at the Castle of Rovenburg. Son of Wilhelm IV, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Princess Elizabeth of Stolberg-Wernigerode.\n\nErich I was the founder of the Calenberg line of the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg. His father, Duke Wilhelm IV, died in 1503, but had already divided his lands in 1495, between his sons, Heinrich and Erich.\n\nErich I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg was given the Principalities of Calenberg and Göttingen, whilst his elder brother, Heinrich IV, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg received the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Even as a boy, Erich had travelled as a pilgrim to Jerusalem and toured Italy before he entered the service of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nFirst marriage of Erich I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg was to Princess Catherine of Saxony, the eldest child of Duke Albrecht III of Saxony and his wife, the Bohemian princess Sidonie of Poděbrady.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Prince-Elector Friedrich III of Saxony and Archduchess Margaret of Austria, daughter of the Habsburg Duke Ernst the Iron. Her maternal grandparents were King George of Poděbrady and his first wife Kunigunde of Sternberg.\n\nAt the age of 16, in 1484 at the Innsbruck court, Princess Catherine of Saxony’s first marriage was as the second wife of Archduke Sigismund, who was already 56 years old and regarded as senile.\n\nThe Archduke Sigismund had previously been married to Princess Eleanor of Scotland, a daughter of King James I of Scotland and Joan Beaufort, a daughter of John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, a legitimised son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster (son of King Edward III of England) by his mistress (and later third wife) Katherine Swynford.\n\nPrincess Eleanor of Scotland left Archduke Sigismund no surviving children. Likewise, the marriage of Princess Catherine and Archduke Sigismund remained childless.\n\nArchduke Sigismund gave up his Tyrolean possessions to his cousin Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich III. With his resignation in 1490, his wife Catherine had significantly less income than before. In 1496 Sigismund died.\n\nSoon after the Archduke ‘s death, in 1496, Catherine married the Welf Duke Erich I of Brunswick-Lüneburg, ruler over the Principality of Calenberg-Göttingen. The marriage produced one short-lived daughter, Princess Anna Maria of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nAfter Princess Catherine’s death on July 7, 1525 the 55 year old Duke Erich I of Brunswick-Lüneburg married the 15-year-old Princess Elisabeth of Brandenburg, the third child and second daughter of the Prince-Elector Joachim I of Brandenburg and his wife Princess Elisabeth of Denmark. She was educated in a strictly religious and humanist fashion.\n\nFrom this marriage resulted his long-awaited successor Duke Eric II (1528–1584).\n\nWhen, in 1528, Elisabeth fell ill in bed when she was pregnant, she held the witchcraft of her husband’s mistress, Anna Rumschottel, responsible. She persuaded her husband to hold a trial. In the process, several women were burned to death, but Duke Erich I allowed his mistress to escape. She was however later burned to death in Hamelin.\n\nIn 1540, just under 23 years after the Martin Luther’s posting of his theses, Duchess Elisabeth had publicly allowed communion to be taken in both kinds in a church service. From then on she and her husband followed separate confessions: Duke Erich I remained Roman Catholic, the Duchess Elisabeth became Lutheran.\n\nDuke Eric I of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Prince of Calenberg-Göttingen died on July 30, 1540 at the Reichstag in Haguenau, Alsace.\n\nHis son, Duke Eric II of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Prince of Calenberg-Göttingen, was still a child, which is why his mother, the Duchess Elisabeth, took over the reign for five years as Regent.\n\nWhen Duke Eric I died he left behind large debts, estimated at 900,000 thalers, as well as two important buildings: the Erichsburg near Dassel and the rebuilt Calenberg Castle. His funeral took place in 1541 in Hann.\n\nMünden’s St. Blasius Church, after his body was released in Haguenau one year after his death on payment of his debts. This required every subject in his duchy to pay 16 pfennigs.\n\nAugusta of Reuss-Ebersdorf (January 19, 1757 – November 16, 1831), was by marriage the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She was the grandmother and godmother of both Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the Prince Consort.\n\nPrincess Augusta was born on January 19, 1757, the second child of Heinrich XXIV, Count Reuss of Ebersdorf and Countess Caroline Ernestine of Erbach-Schönberg. Her birthplace, Ebersdorf, was a center of Pietism in Thuringia and Augusta’s grandparents were ardent admirers of this religious movement.\n\nAugusta’s grandaunt, Countess Erdmuthe Dorothea of Reuss-Ebersdorf, was married to Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf, leader of the revivalist Moravian Church. This background explains the deep religious feelings of Duchess Augusta in later years.\n\nMarriage\n\nHer father commissioned a portrait of Augusta as Artemisia by the painter Johann Heinrich Tischbein. Count Heinrich XXIV showed this painting during the Perpetual Diet so potential marriage candidates were aware of his beautiful daughter.\n\nIn Ebersdorf on June 13, 1777, Prince Augusta married Duke Franz of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, who previously acquired the Artemisia painting for four times the original price because he was deeply in love with Augusta, but he was already obliged to marry his relative Princess Sophie of Saxe-Hildburghausen.\n\nShe was the daughter of Duke Ernst Friedrich III of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1727–1780) and Princess Ernestine of Saxe-Weimar (1740–1786).\n\nOn March 6, 1776, Sophie married at the age of 16 (in Hildburghausen) the Hereditary Prince (and later Duke) Franz Friedrich Anton of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. At the time, Hereditary Prince Franz was already in love with his future wife Countess Augusta Reuss of Ebersdorf, but he was unable to break off his engagement with her.\n\nPrincess Sophie died of influenza just seven months later, on October 28, 1776. She remained childless. She was buried in the crypt of the St. Moritz Church in Coburg. Princess Sophie died 7 months after the wedding, so the young Duke Franz was free to wed again.\n\nDuring her marriage, Augusta bore her husband Franz 10 children, though only seven of them survived to adulthood; some of their children played important roles in European history: Victoria, Duchess of Kent, and King Leopold I of Belgium."
