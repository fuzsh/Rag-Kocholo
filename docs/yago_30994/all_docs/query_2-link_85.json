        "text": "The programmes and the account of the race, which was published in 1811, showed that Dall’Armi was not only concerned about the enjoyment of his fellow-citizens in Munich or about the royal family. Surely the horse race superficially revived older traditions, such as the Scharlachrennen (scarlet races), which had taken place in 1780-1786 during the Jacobidult (St. James’s Fair). In reality, what counted was the representation of the city and of its higher strata of society versus the royal family – and, to an extent, also the further success story of Dall’Armi himself.\n\nKing Max I Joseph probably did not dislike the initiative either. In 1810, Bavaria was a state jumbled together from old and new parts; it was by no means clear, whether it would be able to keep its territorial extension. After all, the borders of the young kingdom had been changed again only a few months previously. As king “by the grace of Napoleon” he ruled over people who had mostly not been born as Bavarians and still did not feel as Bavarians. Any chance to unite symbolically the new political entity was useful at such a time.\n\nAs site of the event, which was scheduled for 17 October 1810, served the open meadow outside the city gates. The slope of the Sendlinger Höhe (Sendlingen Heights; today Schwanthal Heights) provided an ideal, natural grandstand. The meadows in front were for the most part property of the families of Munich citizens, including that of Dall’Armi. From the royal collections, a huge Osman tent, which Elector Max Emanuel (1662-1726) had once captured, was used as the Königszelt (Royal Tent). Placed on a height, it offered enough space to the court society to watch the race."
