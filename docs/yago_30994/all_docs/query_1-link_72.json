        "text": "Bavarian Royalty: Prince Adalbert (1828-75)\n\nWe know very little about Prince Adalbert Wilhelm Georg Prinz von Bayern at this time. He was a member of the House of Wittelsbach--the youngest son of King Ludwig I. Thus he had the title Prinz von Bayern.He was born (1828). His mother was Therese Charlotte Luise Prinzessin von Sachsen-Hildburghausen. Prince Adalbert Amelia de Borbón, Infanta de España, daughter of Francisco de Paula de Borbón, Duque de Cádiz and Luisa Carlota di Borbone, Principessa delle Due Sicilie. They married in Madeid (1856). Prince Adalbert died at Nymphenburg, Germany (21875). He was only 47 years old. We do have an image of one of his grandsons.\n\nParents\n\nFather\n\nI had always thought that Ludwig II, Mad King Ludwig, was the most colorful monarch, on the Bavarian crown, but his grandfather Ludwig I achieved considerable notariety himself during his reign. King Ludwig I of Bavaria, Max Joseph's son, brought artists such as Klenze, Gärtner and Cornelius to Munich. He moved the University from Landshut to the city in 1826 and appointed renowned scientists, philosophers and historians to important positions. He built extensively and was responsible for the Feldherrnhalle, the Alte Pinakothek and the Ludwigsbrücke. Ludwig I was forced to agree to a democratic consitution as part of the revolutions sweeping Europe. Rather than rule in a democratic Bavaria, Ludwig I abdicated. There were also complications arising from his relationship with dancer Lola Montez. Interestingly, the world also owes Oktoberfest to the Bavarian family--the Wittelsbach dynasty. Oktoberfest began as a public celebration of the wedding in 1810 of the Crown Prince, who later became King Ludwig I, to Princess Theresia. The event was such success that it has been continued every year since.\n\nMother\n\nLudwig married Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, in Munich during 1810.\n\nSiblings\n\nThe Royal couple had nine children.\n\nMaximilian II (1811-64)\n\nTheir eldest son Maximillian succeeded his father as King Maximillian II of Bavaria. He was born in 1811. Bavaria was a center for anti-Prussian and anti-unification sentiment within the German Federation. Partly as a result of a heavily Catholic population it was a bulwark against socialism among the German states. Maximillian accepted the Crown after his father abdicated. He also had a large building program and brought many prominent scientists and artists to Munich. He was a reformer who overhauled the judicial system and introduced freedom of the press. A new road, Maximilianstraße, was built on his instructions. The Maximilianeum, at the eastern end of the road, is now the seat of the Bavarian parliament. Maximillian had two sons, Ludwig and Otto. He had excentric ideas about raising his children and his inflexible rule was probably the major cause of the mental instability of both boys. Eventually their uncle Luitpold, Maximillian's younger brother, had to serve as regent.\n\nMathilde (1813-62)\n\nMathilde was born in 1813 at Augsburg. She married Grand Duke Ludwig III von Hessen und bei Rhein (18??-1877), the son of Ludwig II, Grand Duke von Hessen und bei Rhein who reigned from 1830-1848 and Princess Wilhelmine von Baden (1806-77). The marriage took place in Munich during 1833. Ludwig III replaced his father as Grand Duke during the 1848 revolutions which swept Germany anfd the rest of Europe. Princess Mathilde died in 1862 at Darmstadt.\n\nFredrich Ludwig (1815- )\n\nFreferich Ludwig was born in 1815 at Salzburg. He married Duchess Amelie von Oldenburg (1818-75), daughter of Paul Friedrich August, Grand Duke von Oldenburg and Princess Adelheid von Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym. The marriage took place in Oldenburg during 1836. Frederich Ludwig accepted the throne offered him by the European powers and was crowned King Otto I of the Hellenes in 1832. Otto was only 17 years of age so a Bavarian regency was destablished to rule the war-devestated county. The Bavarians ruled imperiously, imposing high taxes and attempted to set up a centarlized bureacracy. Some of the German influence in Greece, such as in Greek art and academia, probably originate with the Bavarian monarchy. A bloodleess revolt occurred in 1843. Otto was compeled to dismiss his Bavarian advisers and accept a democratic constitution. His unpopularity inceased when in 1854 supported France and England when war broke out in the Crimea. An army revolt and subsequent national assembly deposed Otto in 1862. The Great Powers acquised. He returned to Bavaria and died at Bamberg in 1867.\n\nTheodolinde (1816-17)\n\nPrincess Theolinde died in infancy.\n\nLuitpold (1821-1912)\n\nPrince Luitpold was born in 1821 at Wuerzburg. He married Archduchess Auguste of Austria (1825-64), Princess of Tuscany, daughter of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Archduke of Austria and Princess Maria Anna of Saxony. The marriage took place at Firenze in 1844. Luitpold became Prince-Regent of Bavaria 1886. Prince Luitpold was the fourth child of King Ludwig I and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Mephews Ludwig and Otto reigned as kings. Prince Luitpold acted as regent (1886-1912) during the reign of Otto I. This was of some concern to Chancellor Bismark as Bavaria was part of the German Empire. Perhaps out of consideration of his brother, Prince Luitpold was never crowned and served as regent. Many commentators assume that Prince Luitpold instigated the conspiracy to declare Otto insane. The view is that Prince Luitpold usurpered the Bavarian Crown. Others argue that nothing could be further from the truth. The Prince in fact waited and considered matters for nearly 3 months before accepting the advise of Prime Minister Lutz and the Cabinet. The Prince married Archduchess Augusta of Tuscany (Habsburg-Lotharingen) in 1844. They had four children. The eldest was Ludwig (1845). After over 20 years as Regent, Prince Luitpold was finally succeeded by his son, Ludwig III in 1913. Bavaria while Ludwig II was still king was swept up in the War against France and the unification of German under the Crown of Prussia. Bavaria entered the North German Confederation by treaty on November 23, 1870, becoming a part of the German Empire.\n\nAdegunde (1823-1914)\n\nPrincess Adegunde was born in 1823 at Wuerzburg.

Isabella was the daughter of Ferdinand VII. His decission to suspend the Salic Law and to allow his infant daughter to succed him was disputed by his brother Charles.

The royal couple had three children: Ferdinand Msaria Ludwig Franz (1884-1958), Adalbert (1886-1970), and Maria del Pilar (1891-1987). Ludwig Ferdinand died in 1949 in Nymphenburg.
