        "text": "later Otto I. of Greece\n\nborn on June 1, 1815 in Salzburg, Austria\n\ndied on July 26, 1867 in Bamberg, Germany\n\nHe was King of Greece and the second-born son of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who also stayed at the Goldener Adler several times.\n\nMany German academics came to Greece under Otto I. University education is also very important in Innsbruck and we can call ourselves a university city with about 34,000 enrolled students.\n\nIn 1776 the buildings of today’s Faculty of Theology were opened as the first building of the University of Innsbruck.\n\nVisit this part of our city, also very worth seeing the Jesuit church there with its princely tombs in the crypt as well as the impressive 9200 kg “Schützenglocke”, one of the largest bells in Austria and certainly the largest free-swinging bell from the house of the Innsbruck bell foundry Grassmayr.\n\nLife and facts\n\nOtto I, King of Greece was the second-born son of King Ludwig I of Bavaria and Therese, Princess of Saxe-Hildburghausen.\n\nAfter the end of the Greek War of Independence in 1830, there was a chaos in power politics in Greece. After an intervention of the great powers (Great Britain, France and Russia), Greece was declared an independent kingdom by the London Protocol and the then 16-year-old Otto I. of Bavaria, was proclaimed king.\n\nOtto I. reigned in Greece from 1832 to 1862. He had his residence in Nafplio until the capital was moved to Athens in 1834.\n\nUnder his rule, many Germans came to Greece. Among them were craftsmen and academics. Their descendants are almost completely assimilated today.\n\nWell known are the numerous buildings that were built under Otto, often with the support of local patrons, e.g. the new city of Sparta. Far more significant, however, are the administrative foundations of modern Greece introduced by him and his government.\n\nThus, to this day, Greek legislation is based on German legislation (the Bavarian purity law was also once valid in Greece). However, his zeal was countered by a large mountain of debt at the end of his reign.\n\nHe married the Duchess Amalie of Oldenburg in Oldenburg on November 22, 1836.\n\nVarious mistakes during his reign eventually led to his deposition in 1862. He left Greece and returned with his wife to Bavaria, where they lived in Bamberg until her death.\n\nHe always remained very attached to Greece."
