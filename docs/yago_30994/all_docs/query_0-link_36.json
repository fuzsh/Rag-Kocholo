        "text": "This is her brief Wikipedia article, \"Therese Charlotte Luise of Saxony-Hildburghausen (Therese of Bavaria; 8 July 1792 in Seidingstadt, duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen - 26 October 1854 in Munich) was a queen of Bavaria. Therese was a daughter of Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg and Duchess Charlotte Georgine of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, eldest daughter Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nBiography - In 1809, she was on the list of possible brides for Napoleon. In 1810, she married the Bavarian crown prince Ludwig. Their wedding was the occasion of the first ever Oktoberfest. She became queen in 1825. During the numerous love affairs of her husband, Therese suffered but indulged the king. However, she did not refrain from demonstrating her disapproval in discreet ways; in 1831, she left town during one of his affairs. She strictly rejected associating with the mistresses. Therese often backed up Ludwig's office especially when he was absent from Munich during his numerous journeys, and she did have some political influence and participated in political issues. She was very popular and was considered to represent an ideal queen, wife, and mother. She was involved in a great number of charitable organizations for poor, widows and orphans. She was met with great sympathy during her husbands infidelity with Lola Montez, which caused him to abdicate 1848.\"\n\nHer children includedÂ Grand Duchess Mathilde Karoline of HesseÂ and Archduchess Hildegard.\n\nBeer drinkers of the world - have a cool one to celebrate that she married Ludwig I."
