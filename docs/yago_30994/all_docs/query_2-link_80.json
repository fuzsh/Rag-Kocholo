        "text": "Ludwig I was the King of Bavaria from 1825 until 1848. He was born to Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt in Zweibrucker Hof in Strassburg. His father was an important ally of the anti-Habsburg during the Thirty Years War.\n\nLudwig I was engaged in the Napoleonic Wars when he was still a Crown Prince. During his reign, the construction of the Ludwig Canal began, which started the industrialization of Bavaria.\n\nThis notgeld set that consists of 6 pieces of 50-pfennig notes from Treuenbrietzen in Brandenburg in 1921 includes a banknote that features Ludwig I handing over a document to citizens on the reverse design. Other predominant designs are the Mother of God sculpture, Luther preaching in front of the church, the St Marien Church, the town hall, and the St Nikolai Cathedral, and portraits of Lutheran Reformer Martin Chemnitz, German composer Fr. Heinr Himmel, and and lawyer Johanes Weinlob.\n\nLudwig I was an admirer of the arts, the Italian Renaissance, and Ancient Greece. The Greece 20 Drachmai Banknote from 1940 displays an ancient coin depicting Poseidon on its obverse while its reverse depicts the Parthenon in the Acropolis in Athens. This temple dedicated to Athena is one of the symbols that represent the culture of Ancient Greeks.\n\nKing Ludwig I and Oktoberfest\n\nOn October 12, 1810, Ludwig I was married to Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. To honor the newlyweds, the people of Munich were invited to this event and gathered at the Theresienwiese (Theresaâ€™s Meadow), which was named after the Crown Princess. This Royal wedding was the event of the first-ever Oktoberfest, the largest beer festival and traveling carnival in the world. This 16-day festival is celebrated from late September until the first Sunday of October.\n\nSources:\n\nThumbnail: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_I_of_Bavaria#/media/File:Joseph_Karl_Stieler_-King_Ludwig_I_in_his_Coronation_Robes-_WGA21796.jpg"
