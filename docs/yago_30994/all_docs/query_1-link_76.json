        "text": "Beer lovers who also like to travel no doubt include attending Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany, on their bucket lists. The annual festival in Munich begins in late September and lasts for 16 days, during which people from across the globe gather to celebrate Bavarian culture.\n\nA wildly popular folk festival held annually just outside the city center of Munich, Oktoberfest is a joyous celebration that includes food, dancing, music, parades and, of course, beer.\n\nSome observers may note that the Oktoberfest celebration, minus the parades, closely resembles a modern day wedding reception. And such an observation provides a clue as to the origins of Oktoberfest.\n\nOktoberfest includes so much tradition that some revelers may feel as though it must trace its origins back many centuries. However, according to History.com, the original Oktoberfest took place in 1810. That festival was actually a celebration of the marriage of Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria to Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen."
