        "text": "Ludwig I (August 25, 1786 – February 29, 1868) was King of Bavaria from 1825 until the 1848 revolutions in the German states.\n\nCrown Prince\n\nBorn in the Zweibrücker Hof in Straßburg as Prince Ludwig Karl August of Pfalz-Birkenfeld-Zweibrücken, he was the son of Prince-Elector Maximilian IV Joseph of Zweibrücken (later King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria) by his first wife Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt, the fourth daughter and ninth child of Prince Georg Wilhelm of Hesse-Darmstadt (second son of Ludwig VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt) and Countess Maria Louise Albertine of Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg.\n\nAt the time of his birth, Prince Ludwig’s father was an officer in the French army stationed at Strasbourg. He was the godson and namesake of King Louis XVI of France and Navarre.\n\nOn April 1, 1795 his father succeeded Ludwig’s uncle, Charles II, as Duke of Zweibrücken, and on February 16, 1799 became Prince-Elector Maximilian IV Joseph of Bavaria and Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Arch-Steward of the Empire, and Duke of Berg on the extinction of the Sulzbach line with the death of the Prince-Elector Charles Theodore. His father assumed the title of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria on January 1, 1806.\n\nAs Crown Prince, Ludwig married on October 12, 1854, Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen (8 July 1792 – 26 October 1854; a daughter of Friedrich, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen and Duchess Charlotte Georgine of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, eldest daughter of Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nIn 1809, Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen was on the list of possible brides for Napoleon. The wedding between her and Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria was the occasion of the first ever Oktoberfest.\n\nWhen Ludwig was Crown Prince, he was involved in the Napoleonic Wars. As king Ludwig I of Bavaria, he encouraged Bavaria’s industrialization, initiating the Ludwig Canal between the rivers Main and the Danube. In 1835, the first German railway was constructed in his domain, between the cities of Fürth and Nuremberg, with his Bavaria joining the Zollverein economic union in 1834.\n\nAfter the July Revolution of 1830 in France, Ludwig’s previous liberal policy became increasingly repressive; in 1844, Ludwig was confronted during the Beer riots in Bavaria.\n\nDuring the revolutions of 1848 the King faced increasing protests and demonstrations by the students and the middle classes. The king had ordered to close the university in February, and on March 4, a large crowd assaulted the Armory to storm the Munich Residenz.\n\nLudwig’s brother Prince Charles managed to appease the protesters, but the royal family and the Cabinet now turned against Ludwig. He had to sign the so-called “March Proclamation” with substantial concessions. On March 16, 1848 it was followed by renewed unrest because Lola Montez had returned to Munich after a short exile.\n\nLudwig had to let her be searched by the police on March 17, which was the worst humiliation for him.\n\nNot willing to rule as a constitutional monarch, Ludwig abdicated on March 20, 1848 in favour of his eldest son, Maximilian. He became King Maximilian II of Bavaria.\n\nLudwig lived for another twenty years after his abdication and remained influential. An admirer of ancient Greece and the Italian Renaissance, Ludwig patronized the arts and commissioned several neoclassical buildings, especially in Munich. He was an avid collector of arts, amassing paintings from the Early German and Early Dutch periods as well as Graeco-Roman sculptures.\n\nAll living legitimate agnatic members of the House of Wittelsbach descend from him.\n\nCarlos IV (November 11, 1748 – January 20, 1819) was King of Spain and ruler of the Spanish Empire from 1788 to 1808.\n\nEarly life\n\nCarlos IV was the second son of King Carlos III of Spain and his wife, Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony, the daughter of King Augustus III of Poland, (Prince-Elector Friedrich August II of Saxony) and Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria, herself daughter of Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor. Her mother was the first cousin of Empress Maria Theresa.\n\nInfante Carlos was born in Naples (November 11, 1748), while his father was King of Naples and Sicily. His elder brother, Don Felipe, was passed over for both thrones, due to his learning disabilities and epilepsy.\n\nHis father was also Duke of Parma and Piacenza, as Carlo I (1731–1735); King of Naples, as Carlo VII; and King of Sicily, as Carlo III (1735–1759). He was the fourth son of King Felipe V of Spain and the eldest son of Felipe’s second wife, Elisabeth Farnese.\n\nIn Naples and Sicily, Infante Carlos was referred to as the Prince of Taranto. He was called El Cazador (meaning “the Hunter”), due to his preference for sport and hunting, rather than dealing with affairs of the state. Carlos is considered by historian Stanley G. Payne as “good-hearted but weak and simple-minded.”\n\nIn 1762, Princess Maria Luisa of Parma became engaged to her cousin Infante Carlos, Prince of Asturias, later King Carlos IV of Spain. Maria Luisa of Parma the youngest daughter of Philip, Duke of Parma, the fourth son of King Felipe V of Spain, and Princess Louise Élisabeth of France, the eldest daughter of King Louis XV of France and Navarre and his Polish-born wife, Queen Marie Leczinska.\n\nWhen Princess Maria Luisa’s elder sister, Princess Isabella died in 1763, there were suggestions that Princess Maria Luisa marry her sister’s widower, Emperor Joseph II, but the proposal was refused and her engagement to the Infante Carlos, Prince of Asturias was confirmed. The wedding took place on September 4, 1765 in La Granja Palace.\n\nInfante Carlos succeeded to the Spanish throne in 1759 upon the death of his childless half-brother King Fernando VI. As King Carlos III of Spain, he made far-reaching reforms to increase the flow of funds to the crown and defend against foreign incursions on the empire.\n\nIn 1788, King Carlos III of Spain died and his second son, Infante Carlos, succeeded to the throne as King Carlos IV of and ruled for the next two decades. Even though he had a profound belief in the sanctity of the monarchy and kept up the appearance of an absolute, powerful king, Carlos IV never took more than a passive part in his own government.\n\nThe affairs of government were left to his wife, Maria Luisa, and the man he appointed first minister, Manuel de Godoy. Charles occupied himself with hunting in the period that saw the outbreak of the French Revolution, the executions of his Bourbon relative Louis XVI of France and his queen, Archduchess Marie Antoinette of Austria, and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nRiots, and a popular revolt at the winter palace Aranjuez, in 1808 forced the king to abdicate on March 19, in favor of his son. Infante Fernando, Prince of Asturias, took the throne as King Fernando VII of Spain, but was mistrusted by Napoleon, who had 100,000 soldiers stationed in Spain by that time due to the ongoing War of the Third Coalition.\n\nThe ousted King Carlos IV, having appealed to Napoleon for help in regaining his throne, was summoned before Napoleon in Bayonne, along with his son, in April 1808. Napoleon forced both King Carlos IV and his son, King Fernando VII to abdicate, declared the Bourbon dynasty of Spain deposed, and installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as King Joseph I of Spain, which began the Peninsular War.\n\nBy early 1917, in the midst of World War I, the Russia Empire was on the verge of total collapse of morale. An estimated 1.7 million Russian soldiers were killed in World War I.\n\nThe sense of failure and imminent disaster was everywhere. The army had taken 15 million men from the farms and food prices had soared. An egg cost four times what it had in 1914, butter five times as much. The severe winter dealt the railways, overburdened by emergency shipments of coal and supplies, a crippling blow.\n\nOn March 12, the Volinsky Regiment mutinied and was quickly followed by the Semenovsky, the Ismailovsky, the Litovsky Life Guards and even the legendary Preobrazhensky Regiment of the Imperial Guard, the oldest and staunchest regiment founded by Peter the Great.\n\nThe arsenal was pillaged and the Ministry of the Interior, Military Government building, police headquarters, Law Courts and a score of police buildings were set on fire. By noon, the Peter and Paul Fortress, with its heavy artillery, was in the hands of the insurgents. By nightfall, 60,000 soldiers had joined the revolution.\n\nOrder broke down and Prime Minister Nikolai Golitsyn resigned; members of the Duma and the Soviet formed a Provisional Government to try to restore order. They issued a demand that Nicholas must abdicate.\n\nFaced with this demand, which was echoed by his generals, deprived of loyal troops, with his family firmly in the hands of the Provisional Government, and fearful of unleashing civil war and opening the way for German conquest, Emperor Nicholas II had little choice but to submit.\n\nRevolution & Abdication (1917)\n\nEmperor Nicholas II had suffered a coronary occlusion only four days before his abdication. At the end of the “February Revolution”, Nicholas II chose to abdicate on March 15, 1917.\n\nHe first abdicated in favor of Tsarevich Alexei, but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that Tsarevich Alexei would not live long enough while separated from his parents, who would be forced into exile.\n\nEmperor Nicholas II thus abdicated on behalf of his son, and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother, Grand Duke Michael, as the next Emperor of all the Russias. He issued a statement but it was suppressed by the Provisional Government.\n\nGrand Duke Michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a Constituent Assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic. The abdication of Nicholas II and Grand Duke Michael’s deferment of accepting the throne brought three centuries of the Romanov dynasty’s rule to an end.\n\nThe fall of Tsarist autocracy brought joy to liberals and socialists in Britain and France. The United States was the first foreign government to recognize the Provisional government. In Russia, the announcement of the Emperor’s abdication was greeted with many emotions, including delight, relief, fear, anger and confusion.\n\nGustaf IV Adolph (November 1, 1778 – February 7, 1837) was King of Sweden from 1792 until he was deposed in a coup in 1809. He was also the last Swedish monarch to be the ruler of Finland.\n\nGustaf Adolph was born in Stockholm. He was the son of King Gustaf III of Sweden by his wife Princess Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, she was eldest daughter of King Frederik V of Denmark-Norway and his first wife Princess Louise of Great Britain, the youngest surviving daughter of King George II of Great Britain and Princess Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach.\n\nHis reign was ill-fated and was to end abruptly. In 1805, he joined the Third Coalition against Napoleon. His campaign went poorly and the French occupied Swedish Pomerania. When his ally, Russia, made peace and concluded an alliance with France at Tilsit in 1807, Sweden and Portugal were left as Great Britain’s only allies on the European continent.\n\nOn February 21, 1808, Russia invaded Finland, which was ruled by Sweden, on the pretext of compelling Sweden to join Napoleon’s Continental System. Denmark likewise declared war on Sweden. In just a few months, almost all of Finland was lost to Russia. As a result of the war, on September 17, 1809, in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, Sweden surrendered the eastern third of Sweden to Russia. Following which the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was established within Imperial Russia.\n\nCoup d’état and abdication\n\nOn March 7, 1809, lieutenant-colonel Georg Adlersparre, commander of a part of the so-called western army stationed in Värmland, triggered the Coup of 1809 by raising the flag of rebellion in Karlstad and starting to march upon Stockholm.\n\nTo prevent the King from joining loyal troops in Scania, on March 13, 1809 seven of the conspirators led by Carl Johan Adlercreutz broke into the royal apartments in the palace, seized the king, and imprisoned him and his family in Gripsholm Castle; the king’s uncle, Duke Carl, accepted the leadership of a provisional government, which was proclaimed the same day; and a diet, hastily summoned, solemnly approved of the revolution.\n\nOn March 29, King Gustaf IV Adolph, to save the crown for his son, Gustav, Prince of Vasa, he voluntarily abdicated; but on May 10, the Riksdag of the Estates, dominated by the army, declared that not merely Gustav but his whole family had forfeited the throne, perhaps an excuse to exclude his family from succession based on the rumours of his illegitimacy.\n\nA more likely cause, however, is that the revolutionaries feared that Gustaf Adolph’s son, if he inherited the throne, would avenge his father’s deposition when he came of age. On June 5, Gustav Adolf’s uncle was proclaimed King Carl XIII of Sweden after accepting a new liberal constitution, which was ratified by the diet the next day. In December, Gustaf Adolph and his family were transported to Germany. In 1812, he divorced his wife.\n\nIn exile Gustaf Adolph used several titles, including Count Gottorp and Duke of Holstein-Eutin, and finally settled at St. Gallen in Switzerland where he lived in a small hotel in great loneliness and indigence, under the name of Colonel Gustafsson. It was there that he suffered a stroke and died. He was buried in Moravia.\n\nAt the suggestion of King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway his body was finally brought to Sweden and interred in Riddarholm Church.\n\nGustaf Adolph was a great-grandfather of Princess Victoria of Baden, daughter of Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden, and Princess Louise of Prussia. Victoria of Baden was named after her aunt by marriage, Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia, daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.\n\nKing Oscar II’s new daughter-in-law at the time and eventually Queen of Sweden as consort to Oscar II’s son Gustaf V.\n\nFrom The Emperor’s Desk: I meant to post this yesterday but I took the day off. 😊👑\n\nConrad III (1093 or 1094 – February 15, 1152) of the Hohenstaufen Dynasty was from 1116 to 1120 Duke of Franconia, from 1127 to 1135 anti-king of the Romans of his predecessor Emperor Lothair III, and from March 7, 1138 until his death in 1152 he held the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHe was the son of Duke Friedrich I of Swabia and Agnes of Waiblingen, a daughter of the Salian Emperor Heinrich IV and Bertha of Savoy, a daughter of Otto, Count of Savoy and his wife Adelaide of Susa.\n\nConrad’s father took advantage of the conflict between Emperor Heinrich IV and the Swabian Duke Rudolph of Rheinfelden during the Investiture Controversy. When Rudolph had himself elected German anti-king at Forchheim in 1077, Friedrich of Hohenstaufen remained loyal to the royal crown and in 1079 was vested with the Duchy of Swabia by Emperor Heinrich IV, including an engagement with the king’s minor daughter Agnes.\n\nFriedrich of Hohenstaufen, Duke of Swabia died in 1105, leaving two sons, Conrad and his elder brother Duke Friedrich II of Swabia who inherited the Swabian ducal title. Their mother entered into a second marriage with Margrave Leopold III of Austria, of the House of Babenberg.\n\nIn 1105, Heinrich IV, Holy Roman Emperor since 1084, was overthrown and abdicated in favor of his by his son who became Emperor Heinrich V, and he was Conrad’s uncle.\n\nEmperor Heinrich V prepared for his second campaign to Italy upon the death of Margravine Matilda of Tuscany, and in 1116 he appointed Conrad as Duke of Franconia. Conrad was marked out to act as Regent for Germany, together with his elder brother, Duke Friedrich II of Swabia.\n\nAt the death of Heinrich V in 1125, Conrad unsuccessfully supported his younger brother Duke Friedrich II for the Kingship of the Romans-Germany. Duke Friedrich II was placed under a ban and Conrad was deprived of Franconia and the Kingdom of Burgundy, of which he was rector. With the support of the imperial cities, Swabia, and the Duchy of Austria, Conrad was elected anti-king of the Romans at Nuremberg in December 1127.\n\nConrad quickly crossed the Alps to be crowned King of Italy by Anselmo della Pusterla, Archbishop of Milan, in the village of Monza. Over the next two years, he failed to achieve anything in Italy, however, and returned to Germany in 1130, after Nuremberg and Speyer, two strong cities that supported him, fell to Emperor Lothair III in 1129.\n\nConrad continued in Emperor Lothair III’s opposition, but he and his brother, Duke Friedrich II were forced to acknowledge Lothair as Emperor in 1135, during which time Conrad relinquished his title as King of Italy. After this they were pardoned and could take again possession of their lands.\n\nQueen Ulrica Eleonora’s reign occurred just before the end of the Great Northern War. During the Russian Pillage of 1719–1721 in August of the summer of 1719, the Russian Fleet attacked the capital of Stockholm.\n\nDespite the ongoing attack, Queen Ulrica Eleonora forced her courtiers to attend a previously accepted reception at the British ambassador’s, “being so untouched as if there had been no enemies present for hundreds of miles”, which was considered to be an impressive act of courage.\n\nHer favorite courtier was Emerentia von Düben (1669–1743), her old nurse, who had been ennobled and made lady-in-waiting in 1707 and with whom she had a close relationship all her life.\n\nDüben acted as her advisor, her comfort and her support, and was said to not have abused her influence – they were described as sisters. During her short reign, to secure support for her rule, she ennobled many families.\n\nIn a period of fifteen months, she ennobled 181 people, more than any other monarch in Swedish history; one count, two barons and eight lesser noblemen every month. She had seven field marshals where her brother only ever had between three and five.\n\nQueen Ulrica Eleonora was in fact in favour of an absolute monarchy. She had agreed to the new Constitution only to secure the throne from her nephew, and her relations with the council were not good.\n\nShe came into conflict with the President of the Privy Council Arvid Horn, who resigned in protest, as well as with his successor Gustaf Cronhielm. Horn criticized her for discussing state affairs with her husband, pressed her as to whether she would respect the constitution and insulted her by making the remark that nothing better was to be expected “under the regiment of a female.” These conflicts had a deleterious effect on the war and state affairs.\n\nQueen Ulrica Eleonora supported the political ambitions of her consort, and from the beginning, she wished for him to become her co-monarch, in the fashion of King William III and Queen Mary II of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nHowever, this was not permitted by the Riksdag. One reason being that co-reigning had been forbidden in Sweden since the 15th century. There was also opposition in the Riksdag to the influence of Emerentia von Düben and her siblings over the affairs of state.\n\nHer difficulty in respecting the constitution and trouble in getting along with the Riksdag, as well as her way of continuously discussing state affairs with her husband, did however make the Riksdag willing to replace her with her husband Prince Friedrich as sole monarch if she abdicated, an idea that had the support of Prince Friedrich.\n\nOn February 29, 1720, after having again been denied a co-monarchy, Queen Ulrica Eleonora abdicated in favour of her husband on the condition that she should succeed him if he should die before her. This condition of her abdication in fact granted her place as the heir to the Swedish throne until her death.\n\nThis succession was confirmed by the Riksdag. She often spoke of the abdication as the greatest sacrifice of her life. Prince Friedrich succeeded her as King of Sweden on March 24, 1720.\n\nFrom The Emperor’s Desk: This entry discusses the brief reign and abdication of Queen Ulrica Eleonora of Sweden. There is more to the story that I find interesting therefore next week I’ll delve more into the topic.\n\nUlrica Eleanor (January 23, 1688 – November 24, 1741), known as Ulrica Eleonora the Younger, reigned as Queen of Sweden from December 5, 1718 until her abdication on February 29, 1720 in favour of her husband Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Cassel. Following her husband’s accession as King Friedrich I, Ulrica Eleonora served as his Queen Consort until her death in 1741.\n\nPrincess Ulrica Eleonora of Sweden was the youngest child of King Carl XI of Sweden and Princess Ulrica Eleonora the Elder of Denmark and was named after her mother.\n\nHer mother, Princess Ulrica Eleonora of Denmark, was the daughter of King Frederik III of Denmark-Norway and his spouse, Princess Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg. She was given a strict upbringing under the supervision of her mother: she was taught several different languages, and was reportedly a good student in drawing and painting.\n\nIn 1675 she was betrothed to King Carl XI of Sweden. The purpose of the match, though from the Swedish viewpoint, was to prevent Denmark from forming an alliance with the enemies of Sweden. Her brother, King Christian V of Denmark-Norway, was not enthusiastic about the match.\n\nIn 1715, Princess Ulrica Eleonora the Younger of Sweden married Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Cassel, the son of Landgrave Charles I of Hesse-Cassel, and Princess Maria Amalia of Courland.\n\nOn December 11,1718, Princess Ulrica Eleonora’s, King Carl XII in a war against Norway, was struck in the head by a projectile and killed. The shot struck the left side of his skull and exited from the right. He died instantly.\n\nAfter the death of her brother King Carl XII in 1718, Ulrika Eleonora claimed the throne. Her deceased older sister, Princess Hedvig Sophia, had left a son, Prince Charles Friedrich of Holstein-Gottorp, who had the better claim by primogeniture.\n\nPrincess Ulrika Eleonora asserted that she was the closest surviving relative of the late king (the idea of proximity of blood) and cited the precedent of Queen Christina.\n\nShe was recognized as successor by the Riksdag after she had agreed to renounce the powers of absolute monarchy established by her father. She abdicated in 1720, at which time her husband became king.\n\nShe was one of the rare Queens that served both as a Queen Regnant and a Queen Consort.\n\nKing James II-VII’s departure during the Glorious Revolution significantly shifted the balance of power in favour of Prince Willem III of Orange, who took control of the provisional government on December 28th. Elections were held in early January for a Convention Parliament, which assembled on January 29th.\n\nThe Whigs had a slight majority in the Commons and the Lords was dominated by the Tories, but both were led by moderates. Archbishop Sancroft and other Stuart loyalists wanted to preserve the line of succession; they recognised keeping King James II-VII on the throne was no longer possible, so they preferred Princess Mary either be appointed his regent or sole monarch.\n\nThe next two weeks were spent debating how to resolve this issue, much to the annoyance of Prince Willem III, who needed a swift resolution; the situation in Ireland was rapidly deteriorating, while the French had over-run large parts of the Rhineland and were preparing to attack the Dutch.\n\nAt a meeting with Danby and Halifax on February 3, he announced his intention to return home if the Convention did not appoint him joint monarch; Princes Mary let it be known she would only rule jointly with her husband.\n\nFaced with this ultimatum, on February 6, Parliament declared that in deserting his people King James II-VII had abdicated and thus vacated the Crown, which was therefore offered jointly to King William III and Queen Mary II and they were proclaimed joint monarchs on February 13, 1689.\n\nHistorian Tim Harris argues the most radical act of the 1688 Revolution was breaking the succession and establishing the idea of a “contract” between ruler and people, a fundamental rebuttal of the Stuart ideology of divine right.\n\nWhile this was a victory for the Whigs, other pieces of legislation were proposed by the Tories, often with moderate Whig support, designed to protect the Anglican establishment from being undermined by future monarchs, including the Calvinist King William III.\n\nThe Declaration of Right was a tactical compromise, setting out where James had failed and establishing the rights of English citizens, without agreeing their cause or offering solutions. In December 1689, this was incorporated into the Bill of Rights.\n\nQueen Mary I of Scotland was born on 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland, to King James V and his French second wife, Mary of Guise, the eldest daughter of Claude, Duke of Guise, head of the House of Guise, and his wife Antoinette of Bourbon, herself the daughter of François, Count of Vendome, and Marie de Luxembourg.\n\nMary was said to have been born prematurely and was the only legitimate child of James to survive him. She was the great-granddaughter of King Henry VII of England through her paternal grandmother, Margaret Tudor. Margaret was Henry VIII’s older sister so Mary was Henry VIII’s great-niece.\n\nOn December 1542, six days after her birth, she became Queen of Scotland when her father died, perhaps from the effects of a nervous collapse following the Battle of Solway Moss or from drinking contaminated water while on campaign.\n\nOn July 24, 1567, she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son, the infant King James VI of Scotland. After an unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne, she fled southward seeking the protection of her first cousin once removed, Queen Elizabeth I of England.\n\nAs a great-granddaughter of King Henry VII of England, Mary had once claimed Queen Elizabeth’s throne as her own and was considered the legitimate sovereign of England by many English Catholics, including participants in a rebellion known as the Rising of the North.\n\nPerceiving Mary as a threat, Elizabeth had her confined in captivity in various castles and manor houses in the interior of England for eighteen-and-a-half years.\n\nThe Babington Plot was a plan in 1586 to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I, a Protestant, and put Mary, Queen of Scots, her Catholic cousin, on the English throne.\n\nThe long-term goal of the plot was the invasion of England by the Spanish forces of King Philip II and the Catholic League in France, leading to the restoration of the old religion. The plot was discovered by Elizabeth’s spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham and used to entrap Mary for the purpose of removing her as a claimant to the English throne.\n\nThe chief conspirators were Anthony Babington and John Ballard. Babington, a young recusant, was recruited by Ballard, a Jesuit priest who hoped to rescue the Scottish queen.\n\nOn 7 July 1586, the only Babington letter that was sent to Mary was decoded by Phelippes. Mary responded in code on 17 July 1586 ordering the would-be rescuers to assassinate Queen Elizabeth.\n\nMary was clear in her support for the murder of Elizabeth if that would have led to her liberty and Catholic domination of England. In addition, Queen Mary supported in that letter, and in another one to Ambassador Mendoza, a Spanish invasion of England.\n\nThe letter was again intercepted and deciphered.\n\nJohn Ballard was arrested on August 4, 1586, and under torture he confessed and implicated Babington. Although Babington was able to receive the letter with the postscript, he was not able to reply with the names of the conspirators, as he was arrested.\n\nOthers were taken prisoner by August 15, 1586. Mary’s two secretaries, Claude Nau and Gilbert Curle, and a clerk Jérôme Pasquier were likewise taken into custody and interrogated.\n\nThe conspirators were sentenced to death for treason and conspiracy against the crown, and were to be hanged, drawn, and quartered.\n\nIn October 1586 Mary was sent to be tried at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire by 46 English lords, bishops and earls. She was not permitted legal counsel, not permitted to review the evidence against her, nor to call witnesses.\n\nQueen Mary I was convicted of treason against England. One English Lord voted not guilty. Queen Elizabeth reluctantly signed her cousin-once-removed’s death warrant, and on February 8, 1587, in front of 300 witnesses, Mary I, Queen of Scots, was executed by beheading.\n\nPrince Albert spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, Prince Edward, the heir apparent. Albert attended naval college as a teenager and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York.\n\nHe married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923. Lady Bowes-Lyon was the youngest daughter and the ninth of ten children of Claude Bowes-Lyon, the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in the Peerage of Scotland, and his wife, Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck.\n\nHer mother was descended from British Prime Minister William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, and Governor-General of India Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, who was the elder brother of another prime minister, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.\n\nThey had two daughters, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he engaged speech therapist Lionel Logue to treat his stammer, which he learned to manage to some degree.\n\nHis elder brother ascended the throne as King Edward VIII after their father died in 1936, but Edward abdicated later that year to marry the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. As heir presumptive to Edward VIII, Albert thereby became the third monarch of the House of Windsor, taking the regnal name George VI to show continuity within the Monarchy.\n\nIn September 1939, the British Empire and most Commonwealth countries—but not Ireland—declared war on Nazi Germany.
