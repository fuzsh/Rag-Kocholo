        "text": "When most people think of Oktoberfest they imagine crowds of people swigging beer from mugs as big as their heads with pretzels equally as immense. Most don’t know that the true meaning of this festival was a celebration of love dating back to the early 1800s. When King Ludwig I married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen in 1810 they extended wedding invitations to the people of Munich, who gathered in the fields before the city gates. It was a grand event with all the riches of a royal wedding combined with the time-honored tradition of an opulent horse race. The ceremony ended with singing from a student choir and thus the celebration of the royal love came to an end. However, the following year, the pageantry, celebration, horse races and grand nature of their celebration was repeated and this was the beginning of the Oktoberfest we all know and envision when we hear the word.\n\nIt is only fitting for a celebration of love to be treated as such all these years later. For those that can’t make the pilgrimage to Munich, here are a few great ways to celebrate at home with things we truly love — great beer and decadent food. Only beer brewed in accordance with the German purity law (water, malt, hops and yeast) and within the city limits of Munich can be featured at Oktoberfest, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t plenty of fantastic odes to this historic style. Here are a few of our favorites from near and far. Be sure to try some of our favorite food pairings for an Oktoberfest at your own home… Don’t forget the horse races!\n\nAugustiner Bräu – A classic German brewery with the distinction of being a true Oktoberfest brewery located in Munich. Augustiner also boasts the friendliest tent at Oktoberfest, where the “waiters/waitresses (almost) never forget to smile, regardless of how busy or hectic it gets.” Now that’s a selling point! Their beers are pure expressions of German tradition with a nutty malt profile and crisp bite of hops.\n\nAlthough their festival beer can only be had at the main event, they import 2 varieties of their classic lagers that are oh-so-refreshing. Edelstoff and Maximator are light and dark lagers respectively and showcase all the subtle beauty that goes into a world class German beer."
