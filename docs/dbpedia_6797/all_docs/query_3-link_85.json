Through a series of compelling interviews with authors, illustrators, and activists, viewers will gain a more comprehensive idea of the voices within the movement as well as the artists who visualize history into the pages of treasured books.\n\nIn conjunction with the exhibition, the Alliance Theatre at The Woodruff Arts Center, of which the High is also an arts partner, will present an animated edition of the world-premiere play Sit-In (October 2020) based on Andrea Pinkney’s book Sit-In: How Four Friends Stood Up by Sitting Down. The play is written by lauded author and playwright Pearl Cleage and features music by Eugene Russell IV. Visit www.alliancetheatre.org for details.\n\nContinue the Conversation\n\nPicture the Dream is an open invitation to start important discussions with children, friends, and family.
