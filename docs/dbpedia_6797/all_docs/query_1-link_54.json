        "text": "Coming in with a bold “fuck you” attitude, Dream Wife’s newest album Social Lubrication is a mutli-genere inspired rock album that is constantly punching at anything in its path while playing it cool. Caustic lyrics on top of steady instrumentals that burst at the choruses are a staple on this album and will leave the listener wanting more as they make their way through the 10 tracks.\n\nBlending punk, indie, and pop, with a sprinkle of grunge here and there, Social Lubrication is a great listen for fans of the femme punk and riot grrrl genres. The album takes a clear stance right off the jump in the lyrics, and Dream Wife do not hold back. They want you to know exactly how they feel, with lyrics that detail experiences many men won’t understand. It’s a great combination of musical prowess and engaging lyrics that are delivered in a combination of spoken-word and shouts to really drive the meaning through the skulls of whoever listens.\n\nSocial Lubrication opens on “Kick In The Teeth,” a song that sounds a bit like a surf punk song. Rakel Mjöll has stellar vocals on every track, but especially on the opener. Her vocals echo through the song, really expanding on the chorus where she yells It’s a real kick in the teeth, becoming more frantic with each delivery. The rest of the band proves to be capable musicians with Alice Go, the guitarist stealing the show at some places, evolving the song into something more complicated than what most bands would do. It’s a great opener for this awesome album, delivering what to expect throughout the rest of the album in the first three-minutes.\n\nThe other songs on Social Lubrication are super fun like “Curious” and “Orbit.” Both have awesome guitar work, with songwriting that proves that Dream Wife knows how to write a badass song. “Curious” has more of a pop rock feel that I think will be on people’s summer playlists. “Orbit” closes out the album, crafting a more indie rock song with that punk edge supporting it. Dream Wife is great at what they do, and Social Lubrication proves it.\n\nSocial Lubrication does a great job at delivering social conscious lyrics on top of pure rock jams. Catchy, riotous, and out for blood, every song is a lesson in craft and aesthetic, really bringing the listener into the world of Dream Wife. This is my first time hearing Dream Wife, and I’m a fan. They do a hell of a job on this album, and you should check it out as soon as you can.\n\nBe sure to check out Social Lubrication, out now on Lucky Number Music!"
