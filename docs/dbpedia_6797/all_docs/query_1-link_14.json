        "text": "Afterglow: How and when did Dream Wife form?\n\nAlice: Well, we were all studying various forms of art at the University of Brighton in the UK. Um, I mean, I dunno when that was, about a few years ago now.\n\nBella: Back in the times.\n\nAlice: Me and Bella… grew up in Somerset in the UK so we knew each other from [playing] in Battle of the Bands together.\n\nBella: Yeah, we met in the Midsummer Battle of the Bands.\n\nAlice: But then you lived with Rakel in Brighton. Yeah. Is that kinda how she got woven into the picture?\n\nBella: Initially it was just like a bit of a joke about wanting to travel, but feeling like you needed a purpose and we were like, “let's form a band and go on tour.” Rakel kind of wove it in with her [sic] uni stuff and yeah. It was only meant to be this really short-term kind of fixed period experiment, but it got a bit carried away. And now, the better part of a decade later here we are, on our way to album three, very much in love.\n\nSo how has the music evolved genre-wise? You know, it started off as a short term thing but now you’re onto your third album...\n\nAlice: I mean, like when we started out we used a drum machine. It was just like us three in a drum machine, and it was all very kind of DIY. But over the years –- well, I shouldn't say over the years – it became kind of apparent that maybe as a live act, real drums would be so much fun.\n\nBella: But we're a rock band, we're a heavy rock band, and it's hard to do that without a real drummer. So we're absolutely blessed with Alexander Pavley, our Wonder Boy. We settled quite quickly on this sort of fairly ferocious, but fairly pop, kind of fairly danceable rock music. That was where our first album landed and we circled back around to that. I think we've done a lot of distilling of what it is that is really exciting and vital and alive about the space in between us as a group. So I think this new collection of songs that we are releasing soon is really exemplary of that.\n\nAlice: Yeah. And I think it's been something that's become more and more apparent the longer we've played together. The live show is like the heart of the band and certainly with the new material, it's definitely been about encapsulating that live energy and that sense of fun and raucousness that comes with a Dream Wife live show. And it sounds like it should be super simple to get that down on record because it's kind of the raw ingredients, but actually it's kind of hard to get something that feels true to the live show. But I feel like with the last couple of songs we've released, that comes across more than in other stuff we've released before, and I think we're all really happy with the vibe and the sound coming through with the new material.\n\nBella: One of the ways we managed to do that was Alice producing the record. There's no one that knows what it is that we wanna do so intimately.\n\nAlice: Like we know that, we know the story of this is a live band and kind of getting that across on record, it felt like it had to come from us. So I think we're really proud with the way that's come about, and the new material.\n\nHow are you feeling about that?\n\nAlice: Really good! We're playing the British Music Embassy at midnight.\n\nBella: We've all been in bed by like 10 every day.\n\nAlice: We're gonna have to drink some energy drinks I think, to stay up for that one.\n\nAlice: It's been really fun to just enjoy the festival for the past couple of days. But I think to actually get down to playing shows, that's why we're here. And I think we're all really excited to get on stage and perform.\n\nBella: Yesterday we went to see Be Your Own Pet play, who we like. They were one of the first bands that we ever spoke about when we first met, when we were like 16. We've been literally waiting half our lives to go see them. So it felt really amazing to get to see them and hang out with them.\n\nAlice: It was a real moment.\n\nSo when people come to a Dream Wife concert, whether that's at midnight, at SXSW or on your next tour, what do you want them to get out of that performance?\n\nAlice: Certainly for us, even just for us playing live and sharing our music with everyone, there's always a sense of solidarity through live music. I think if people can feel part of that moment with us and with each other, that's a big thing that we always want people to feel at our shows. But generally with live music, that's what is so important about it, that coming together of people through music and sharing in that and kind of respecting each other through that. Yeah, I would say solidarity.\n\nBella: With heavier shows, there's opportunity for a real cathartic experience as well. I really hope people get to scream and jump around and shake their bodies and crash into each other… I grew up loving moshing, like I really love mosh pits. I got so much out of that, just bodies slamming against each other. The first mostly-women mosh pit that I was ever in was when we played with PINS. It was really, really amazing to be in a space that wasn't just bashing up against creepy guys. And so I think, hopefully, a kind of space to experience that mosh pit, sweaty, glammy vibe without feeling creeped on, to feel safe and embodied and wild and sweaty and sexy and silly. Then we get to do that together, and it's an honor to get to hold space for that stuff."
