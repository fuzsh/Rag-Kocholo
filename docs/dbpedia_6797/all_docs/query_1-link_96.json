Be sure to check out Part One.\n\nDAY 4 – Thursday, March 16th 2023\n\nThursday afternoon was a late start, beginning in the Red River District where we popped into The 13th Floor to catch Militarie Gun, an LA hardcore band that formed in 2020. Through their thrashes and screams comes a real sense of tenderness being conveyed by lead singer Ian Shelton.\n\nThe Plastic Picnic guys and I enjoyed some free hard seltzers at a random spot and then sought the promise of shade at Stubb’s, where Sunflower Bean was in the middle of their set. I realized the last time I saw them play was their EP release at Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn in 2015. At that time, I had no idea who they were yet, but the friend who brought me was pals with Julia Cummings and promised a good show. There was even a little mosh pit. On stage in Austin, Cummings was wearing what looked like a horse hair collar around her neck, the words “unsigned” emblazoned in black across it.\n\nUp next was a band I was unfamiliar with, but quickly learned were Austin darlings from the early aughts: Voxtrot. They are a five-piece indie band, somewhere between the sound of early Vampire Weekend and Arctic Monkeys, that had reformed not long before SXSW. After breaking up in 2010, their set at Stubb’s was part of the reunion they started last year with a short East Coast tour that hit NYC in September 2022 at Webster Hall.\n\nI next crossed over east to Low Down Lounge where my favorite identical twins were playing back to back sets with Die Spitz—a noise-punk match made in Hell.Venus Twins is comprised of only bass and drums, and Jake and Matt Derting are the only twins I know that lean into the whole telepathy thing. I first saw the two play at the Brooklyn DIY spot Rubulad just before the pandemic and have been hooked on their explosive music ever since. Their 2022 album RAXIS is a tight production but their live shows are a whole other beast. It makes sense that the brothers champion Venus, the hottest fucking planet in the solar system.\n\nA SXSW highlight for me was getting to see Die Spitz up front and personal. It’s thrilling to recognize the band you’re watching is fronting the next wave of Kathleen Hanna’s and Joan Jett’s in the post-pandemic era. For a relatively new band where the median age is 19, this group of four is catching fire in the local Austin scene. The lead singer has the face of an angel and the voice of Satan. The bassist looks ecstatically possessed. The guitarist and drummer swap instruments effortlessly. What is it about this band that makes me think of blood? Fresh meat up on the industry chopping block? Or in the teeth of the very youthful, very hungry?\n\nIn any case, when Cyndi said girls just wanna have fun, I’m pretty sure she imagined a Die Spitz live show.\n\nDAY 5 – Friday, March 17th 2023\n\nCheer Up Charlies made another easy day for me with their excellent line up of grunge, punk, and noise bands. Brooklyn-based Native Sun was a great way to start the day, these guys are notorious showmen and their midday set on the outside stage was jarringly loud—vicious for the hungover crowd. My eardrums have still never recovered from the last show I saw of theirs with my friend and fellow photographer Nico Potosme at The Dance before it closed for good in 2019. Watching frontman Danny Gomez lose it, you have to wonder what kind of toll it takes on someone to exorcise themselves over and over for their music. Of course shows like these are always the most fun to shoot; guitars being thrown, bodies rolling off stage…one man’s hazard is another man’s opportunity for a really exciting shot.\n\nModel/Actriz played the outdoor stage again and with their tour dates selling out the way they are, I wasn’t taking a free show for granted even if I had seen them earlier in the week. That grinding bass detune Aaron Shapiro does was especially good this set.\n\nEnumclaw was up next. A Tacoma band with excellent shoes and an honest sound, their tenderness caters to anyone with emo tendencies. You could feel the hometown angst dripping off their music and it kind of made me wish we were at a house show sipping warm beer from cans in the dark.\n\nI tried to catch Gargoyle, a friend’s new EBM/synthwave project, at Hotel Vegas but got confused and lined up for the wrong indoor stage. Instead I caught the tail end of another Miss Grit set, but the happy coincidence kept me from queuing in another long line. Sorry Gargoyle, next time!\n\nAvoiding said long line, I didn’t leave the room when the next band got on stage and ended up getting to see a really fun show by Le Couleur, a Montréal based band I hadn’t heard of before but belong side by side with French electro disco artist of a similar psychedelic caliber like L’Imperatrice and La Femme. The lead singer and keyboardist, Laurence Giroux-Do, had all the energy to match the Baltimore Ravens cheerleading outfit she was wearing and more. The crowd ate it up, welcoming the opportunity to finally get to dance like it was a proper nightclub, not a dive bar in the middle of SXSW. This was definitely the most fun show I saw outside of the punk/noise genre during the entire festival and it was a great way to end the night.\n\nDAY 6 – Saturday, March 18th 2023\n\nDawn of the final day of SXSW. I couldn’t call it a slog, it was too enjoyable and too full of good musical surprises to complain about, but it did feel way longer than it actually was. I was glad to be on Plastic Picnic’s show schedule for the last day because having three sets already booked removed a lot of waffling over what shows to see.\n\nFirst up, a twenty minute drive south to the Do512 Presents showcase at Far Out Lounge. While the band loaded their gear into the green room, I got to give my online friend Aarvi a big hug for the first time IRL. We connected over Instagram after realizing we had both been taking photos of Plastic Picnic at their 2019 show in the basement of the old Songbyrd Music House in Washington DC. After finding out we were both at SXSW earlier in the week we made a point to meet up at this show.\n\nAarvi was hyped for the band just about to play, an indie rock band called Personal Trainer from Amsterdam. I was impressed they managed to get all seven members on stage, let alone all the way from The Netherlands. Their music was somewhere between Cake’s kooky, Franz Ferdinand’s panache, and Pavement’s earnesty; the effect was an entertaining genre-bending whirlwind.\n\nPlastic Picnic has been together for several years now, all past and present members are PNW transplants that moved to Brooklyn for music. Their shimmery sound is surf-pop dreamy and consistently about love, loss, or more often both. Despite this, the average person has been known to sway, or even occasionally dance to, their self proclaimed sad songs. They’ve been compared to The 1975, Tame Impala, and Alvvays. I know these guys too well to feel comfortable writing about them more extensively but their Far Out Lounge show was a well played set to a full room.\n\nAfterwards I watched Sorry Mom, who have a ridiculously irreverent song called “I Fucked Yr Mom” that I was happy to finally see live. Their other tracks are more serious but still tongue in cheek, with a grittiness reminiscent of Le Tigre, GRLwood, and Destroy Boys. Their debut album babyface is being released May 12th of this year.\n\nBefore driving to Plastic’s next show in East Austin I caught the tail end of Dream Wife’s set outside. Classic, unapologetic femme punk at its finest.\n\nThe next stop was an outdoor show at Fair Market but the weather was weirdly cold and dreary at that point in the day. The venue was being sponsored by an energy drink called C4, most of which were too tooth achingly sweet to enjoy. Oh, and there was also no food, no alcohol, and no water available once inside the gates. The band had sound checked in the morning but to little effect; the sound engineer had seemingly deleted their settings. All these things led to a lukewarm showing for Plastic Picnic, but honestly, by no real fault of their own. Afterwards a few fans stopped by the stage to say hi and buy some merch before we were all quickly and unceremoniously kicked out of the space…but at least it was a paid gig.\n\nAfter getting to Seven Grand, the last venue of the night, we watched a band from Chicago called Free Range play an acoustic-forward, very mellow set. In the vein of Why Bonnie and Hand Habits, their music is something I’d put on after getting home from a long day; quiet, intimate, and reliable.\n\nPlastic Picnic played the last set of the night (and my SXSW experience) and it was a relief. The set went smoothly, there was a good crowd and I had fun shooting with a new filter. Our friend Nicole from NYC came to see the show and we all celebrated afterwards. I can’t remember how we all got home, but what matters is we did. The next day Plastic Picnic hit the road for Idaho’s Tree Fort Festival and I was left with a mild hangover and the gargantuan task of going through all 128 GBs of photos I had taken on my trip.\n\nIt was nice to end the marathon of bands I saw with some familiar faces. All in all, my first time in SXSW was great, if a little hectic. While I was grateful for the free badge, I don’t think having one is necessary. The unofficial shows are worth flying down for alone, especially if you have friends with you. I’m no stranger to going to shows solo, but after this I can really appreciate that the experience of live music Is better when sharing it with a buddy or two. After SXSW 2023, I now have a very long list of new music to listen to from different parts of the world, a roster of new friends, and a lot of photos I’m proud of to look back on. If you stuck around this long, thanks for reading!\n\nSingle Serve 030\n\nHi! Hello! Here we are with some bite sized goodies and a taste of a some new things that we dug that came out in the last week (ish), quick fire responses to some great new music we think you should check out. This week Chantal, Kate and Mike weighed in on some killer songs— give ’em a listen!\n\nAlgiers– 73%. The third single from the upcoming album, SHOOK, is as lithe as it is intense. You never quite know what you’re going to get from one song to the next with Algiers—each single from the album released so far has had a different feel/vibe—and I mean this as a supreme compliment as it is a direct reflection of their strength and skill as musicians and songwriters. Rare is the band that can do so much without getting lost along the way and be so impactful in the process. SHOOK is out 2/24 via Matador. They will next play NYC at Racket on 4/6. [KH]\n\nBartees Strange– Tisched Off/Keekee’in. feat. Daniel Kleederman. For Sub Pop’s singles series, the indie power house has released a pair of songs that deftly show the range of his songwriting. These songs come as a mini follow up of sorts to his second lauded second album, Farm To Table. On “Tisched Off” he shares: “As an up and coming musician, there’s a very special pain that comes with realizing a huge chunk of the artists you’re competing with have way more money and resources than you. This song takes little digs at them. It’s cute. Tisch is like the fashion school at NYU. When I was living in BK I ran into a bunch of young punk bands and experimental acts that rose quickly from that school. I remember feeling like damn—how do you compete with people like that? They’ve got some very real resources. Anywho—it’s just me making fun.” (Having known Strange since his DIY days and time in BK, and having dealt with many of the very same issues in the BK music community, I couldn’t help but chuckle—and agree!)\n\nAs for “Keekee’in” he shares “This song is extremely special to me. During our tour with Car Seat Headrest the band had Covid. I was bunkered down with my guitarist Dan at his family’s house in the basement. I figured it would be cool to write something using only the tools we had. All of the instrumentation was done with stuff from that room. Matchsticks, pillows for drums, very random keyboards, etc. I wrote this song to get some feelings out I had about some business people I was considering working with—they ended up being shady and I was feeling very betrayed. I was thinking about how valuable it is to have people you can really trust. And how few those people are.” [KH]\n\nBruise Control– Dead on Arrival. A nice slice of gritty, dancey post punk from the Manchester group who were one of our recent Bandcamp Friday picks. Their debut album, Useless For Something, will arrive this spring via TNS Records. [KH]\n\nCheater Slicks– Fear. This venerable band is in their 4th decade and still ripping tunes. We love to see punks keep at it! “Fear” features their classic garagey sound, still as immediate as ever, with a percussive trudge behind buzzing guitars. Their album Ill-Fated Cusses is out now on In the Red Records. [CW]\n\nThe Dog Indiana– Hydroxydramaqueen/Loaf. This noisy, sludgy stoner-ish noise trio from Vancouver recently came to my attention and I was immediately drawn to the pair of singles that have been released from their upcoming album, Burnt Ends. With heavy grunge overtones, these are two very solid noise punk rippers in the vein of some UK faves, Dead Arms and USA Nails. I loved what I heard and absolutely can’t wait for the album to release in full in April. In the meantime, I’ll be digging into their previous releases, 2018’s full length Fractured, Murky and Liquid (which based on its description on Bandcamp may or may not be a cheeky concept album, I still have to find out!), and the handful of singles they put out in 2020. Pre-orders for Burnt Ends are up now. [KH]\n\nBurnt Ends by The Dog Indiana\n\nBurnt Ends by The Dog Indiana\n\nDrahla– Lip Sync. The UK post punk band has released a new single, which follows last year’s “Under the Glass” and their 2019 debut full length, Useless Coordinates. No word yet if this is a stand alone or part of a larger body of work to come but the band shares the song “is a biographical social deflection. It explores the idea of syncing to social norms, conversation and expressions to converse without being fully present – taking on a converged guise to fit different interactions. Inspired by Bruce Nauman‘s ‘Lip Sync,’ 1969.” [KH]\n\nDream Wife– Hot (Don’t Date A Musician). The London grunge pop trio are set to release their third album in June, Social Lubrication, and have shared the second single which is a snarky and hilarious cautionary tale about dating musicians. Singer Rakel Mjöll minces no words when she says: “Dating musicians is a nightmare,” and goes on to say the song is about “Evoking imagery of late night make-outs with fuckboy/girl/ambiguously-gendered musicians on their mattress after being seduced by song-writing chat. The roles being equally reversed. Having a laugh together and being able to poke fun at ourselves is very much at the heart of this band. This song encapsulates our shared sense of humour. Sonically it is the lovechild of CSS and Motorhead. It has our hard, live, rock edge combined with cheeky and playful vocals.” [KH]\n\nFACS– When You Say. The Chicago post-punk art rockers have announced their 5th album, Still Life In Decay, and released the driving, hypnotic first single “When You Say.” Read more here. [KH]\n\nGodcaster– Vivian Heck. The latest single from the NYC band’s upcoming self titled album is an “ecstatic and hypnotic vision of romance, passion, and heartthrob.” As intense as it is indeed hypnotic, it hits an explosive high as the crescendo of the song kicks in just before the four minute mark. The album releases in full on 3/10. The band will soon embark on a tour to support the album and will play a release show at Union Pool on 4/1 with Venus Twins and Dirt Buyer. [KH]\n\nMiss Grit– Nothing’s Wrong. The final single from the upcoming album Follow The Cyborg (out 2/24 on Mute) is a slow, steady tune that builds consistently to the end under Margaret Sohn’s lilting voice and twining synths as they sing “it’s been too long / I’ll normalize what’s going on / so I won’t have to make things right / I’ll sing that song I didn’t write / nothing’s wrong.” Miss Grit will be at Baby’s All Right on Feb 22. [CW]\n\nNewski– Chemicals feat. Matthew Caws (Nada Surf). The opening scene of the accompanying music video for this song features footage of the day Ronald Reagan was shot which immediately grabbed my attention (I’ll let readers take a guess on my personal feelings about Ol Ronny Raygun) and the rest of the video continues on with vintage footage with the band playfully inserted overtop in a very comical way. The song itself is a bubbly indie pop rock song, complete with saccharine harmonies, fun sing-along “da da da da’s” throughout the first half of the song and features a guest appearance from Matthew Caws of Nada Surf. This is a catchy first taste of the new album, Friend Rock due out 4/7, and I’m ready for more. [KH]\n\nPile– Lowered Rainbow. The final single from the upcoming album, All Fiction, is a departure for the band, less a wall of noise and more an ethereal, delicate jazz fueled sound exploration. The album releases in full on 2/17 via Exploding In Sound and the band will play a pair of shows at TV Eye on 3/1 and 3/2. [KH]\n\nPoison Ruïn– Härvest. The lead single from Poison Ruïn’s upcoming album is also the title track, and it’s a hard-hitting noisy tale of a peasant revolt, juxtaposing the timeless story of workers rising up against a fantasy backdrop, with member Mac Kennedy saying “I’m all for protest songs, but with this band I’ve found that sometimes your message can reach a greater audience if you imbue it with a certain interactive, almost magical realist element.” Härvest is out on Relapse Records on April 14th. [CW]\n\nSamiam– Crystalized. Having been going strong as a band since 1988, Samiam is still swinging for the fences as the quintet continues to pump out melodic guitar driven bangers that faultlessly toe that line between emo and pop punk. Their latest single “Crystallized,” released ahead of their first album in 12 years and ninth overall, Stowaway (due out next month), is the perfect track to blast while showing your kids you can still kickflip with the best of them. [MB]\n\nScowl– Opening Night. The Santa Cruz hardcore band has just announced a brand new Will Yip produced EP, Psychic Dance Routine, and shared the first single which sees the band less in hardcore territory and veering more towards a cool alt-rock indie vibe. Read more and see the album art/tracklisting here. [KH]\n\nShalom– Soccer Mommy. The second single from Shalom’s upcoming debut full length, Sublimation, is a emo grunge twinged rocker and she shares: “This song is about a time in my life that I used to be very upset and embarrassed about, but now I’m like, wow, I feel so much better after writing this song. It’s called ‘Soccer Mommy’ because I got my driver’s license in late 2019 and spent my first year on the road listening to Color Theory and thinking about my 20-year-old self who didn’t deserve the things that happened to her. I love Soccer Mommy. I’m terrified of driving, but I always felt brave listening to ‘Circle The Drain’ on 287 south.” Sublimation is out 3/10 via Saddle-Creek. [KH]\n\nShonen Knife– Mujinto Rock. The Japanese punk and roll icons have been a band for more than 40 years and continue to pound out cool jams you’ll want to pogo all night to. They have a new album out on 2/15, Our Best Place, and have shared the opening track, “Mujinto Rock,” which comes paired with a really fun stop motion video. [KH]\n\nSquid– Swing (In A Dream). UK post punkers Squid have announced a brand new album, O Monolith, and released the first single which singer/drummer Ollie Judge says was inspired by a dream he had about the painting The Swing by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, “In my dream, I was in the painting but it was flooded and everything was floating away.” Read more and see the album art/tracklisting here. [KH]\n\nTruth Cult– Clearskin. A little psych punk, a little post hardcore, a lot late 80s early 90s Dischord. And you know that gets two hearty thumbs up from me! From the upcoming J. Robbins produced album, Walk The Wheel, due out 3/3 via Pop Wig. [KH]\n\nZulu– We’re More Than This. The esteeemed powerviolence band has released the latest single from their upcoming album, A New Tomorrow, and this one is not a powerviolence song or heavy at all rather a hip-hop song which features guitarist Dez Yusuf rhyming over relaxed, nimble jazz instrumentation. Yusef shares:\n\n“When we first started writing for the record Anaiah and I had bounced the idea of maybe doing some jazz or R&B songs and putting some raps on the record,” Yusuf commented. “I know Satchel and Anaiah had jammed out some different ideas that I hadn’t really been present for. We were actually ending our tour with Sasami when I first heard the music for ‘We’re More Than This’. We were in the van at a rest stop and Anaiah played it off a video of him and Satchel jamming. It just hit me all in an instant.\n\n“I didn’t think much beyond the lyrics of ‘must I only share my pain,’ which is a running theme throughout the album. But it’s ironic because I go forward with sharing glimpses of pain and trauma, but that’s really the setup to show the things I’ve (we’ve) become in spite of that pain. This is really a song of resilience and encouragement. Saying that we can still be more than the tropes that are Put on us. That we are more than commodified versions of our trauma.”\n\nThe album drops in full on 3/3 via Flatspot and they will head out on tour with Show Me The Body, Jesus Piece, Scowl, and TRiPP JONES. The tour hits Brooklyn Steel on 3/24. [KH]"
