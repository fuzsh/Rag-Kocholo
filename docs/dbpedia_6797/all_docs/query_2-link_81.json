We'll start with the main people in Marquess, and see where we end up.I see things in my head like a movie when I'm working, so it really helped to find people that looked like what I imagined my characters to. Then I could see them move and watch their facial expressions, and all that kinds of fun stuff. I know full well that this would never actually work for a movie cast, but that's why it's my dream cast, right? Right.I don't mean to destroy any images you have in your head of these characters, so please don't take this as gospel. This was just where my head was [and is!] as I worked on this. You don't have to agree with me. In fact, if you have other actors in mind, please comment and let me know!It should be noted right here and now that I do not own any of the photos you will see posted here, and none of the rights to them.So. Here we go.As the charming and witty Derek Chambers...\n\nPeter Facinelli\n\nAs his tyrannical and terrifying wife, Katherine....\n\nDagmara Dominczyk\n\nAs the imposing and demanding Duke of Ashcombe...\n\nSean Connery\n\nAs the well meaning and proper Duchess of Ashcombe...\n\nHelen Mirren\n\nAs Derek's stubborn and warm hearted sister, Diana, Lady Beckham...\n\nRachel Weisz\n\nAs Derek's charming and troublemaking brother David...\n\nAdam Levine\n\nSo that wraps up the Chambers family. But I think you want more, right? I'd want more. So here you go.\n\nAs the fiery and impudent Moira, Countess of Beverton...\n\nBryce Dallas Howard\n\nAs the kind and gentlemanly Nathan, Earl of Beverton...\n\nHugh Jackman\n\nAs the almost proper and close to perfect Geoffrey Harris...\n\nRupert Penry-Jones\n\nAs the large bodied and larger hearted Duncan Bray...\n\nGerard Butler\n\nAnd finally last, but not least, as the plucky comic relief, Colin Gerrard...\n\nTom Hiddleston\n\nSo there you go! Hope you enjoyed this fun little casting session! Look for more to come with future books!"
