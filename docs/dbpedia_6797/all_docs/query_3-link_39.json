I keep asking myself, wondering how I keep closing my eyes, but I can't block you out Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me Nobody else, so we can be free Nobody else, so we can be free All the things she said, all the things she said Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head Runnin' through my head All the things she said, all the things she said Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head All the things she said This is not enough This is not enough And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed They say it's my fault, but I want her so much Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain Come in over my face, wash away all the shame When they stop and stare, don't worry me What I'm feeling for her, what she's feeling for me I can try to pretend, I can try to forget But it's driving me mad, going out of my head All the things she said, all the things she said Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head Runnin' through my head All the things she said, all the things she said Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head All the things she said This is not enough This is not enough All the things All the things she said, all the things she said All the things she said, all the things she said Mother lookin' at me Tell me, \"What do you see?\" Yes, I've lost my mind Daddy lookin' at me Will I ever be free? Have I crossed the line? All the things she said, all the things she said Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head Runnin' through my head All the things she said, all the things she said Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head All the things she said This is not enough This is not enough All the things, she said Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head All the things, she said",

        "text": "To celebrate International Women’s Day, London-based trio Dream Wife – vocalist Rakel Mjöll (she/her), guitarist Alice Go (she/her) and bassist Bella Podpadec (they/them) – have shared their cover of t.A.T.u.’s “All The Things She Said”, recorded during the European leg of their Social Lubrication tour.\n\nOf the release the band says, “The legacy of ‘All The Things She Said’ is a total paradox – being both one of the most high profile examples of queerbaiting in pop culture and also one of the only positive depictions of same sex attraction us and our peers came across as youngsters. That and… it’s also an undeniable bop and everytime we play it live it absolutely pops off! We recorded our cover of All The Things She Said in a studio on the outskirts of Prague during our European headline tour. We had no idea what to expect from our first show in Prague and were thrilled to play to a room full of the most stylish lesbians (and lesbian adjacent people) we have ever seen. It felt cathartic, redemptive and very sexually charged to play this track live for such a receptive audience – as Queer people, for Queer people.”\n\nDream Wife - All The Things She Said (Audio)\n\nThe band have also announced more of their riotous live shows across the UK later this year, all dates and tickets links are on their website.\n\nDream Wife released their electrifying third album, Social Lubrication, earlier this Summer to critical acclaim. Known for their explosive live shows, Dream Wife go stateside later this week with a string of dates kicking off in NYC at Brooklyn Made. To celebrate their forthcoming run of live shows, they today share brand new track “Love You More”, recorded during the Social Lubrication album sessions. Drawing from the likes of Pixies and Hole for inspiration, the band says, “‘Love You More’ is not your typical love song, but a love song to the self and choosing to love perfectly imperfect bodies. It has a gritty underbelly, dealing with self-acceptance, body dysmorphia, disaster capitalism, climate collapse and depression. From the micro to the macro, the song explores the relationship between the self and both the body and the earth as experiences of home, as a vessel for feeling.”\n\nDream Wife - Love You More (Audio)\n\nThe band have also today announced a handful of new European shows and festival appearances, and five further UK headline dates for early 2024. This October and November they will be touring widely across the UK and Europe, including performing at Pitchfork Paris and their biggest London show to date, at Electric Brixton. See all their tour dates and get your tickets on their website here.\n\nDream Wife release their electrifying third album, Social Lubrication, this Friday, June 9th and today unveil the final single, the disco-leaning title track. “Social Lubrication” serves as a rally against the patriarchy as they call out unsolicited advice and gendered violence. “Exhausted. Done with being polite, done with sugar coating, placating, and pandering to patriarchal bullshit. Wanting to just exist, in this body without being pigeon-holed or judged for the bodies we exist in. Do the job well. Show up. Not play other people games. You can’t fix something rotten to the core – we need revolution not reform,” note the band on the track.\n\nThe single is out alongside a self-made music video with influences spanning from their album art to the Yellow Jackets opening sequence. Watch now below.\n\nDream Wife - Social Lubrication\n\nToday, Dream Wife take on capitalism and faux-activism with the latest single from their new album Social Lubrication. Titled “Who Do You Wanna Be?”, the track is “about running on the capitalist treadmill and falling face first on the pavement. Hollow slogans, social media activism without action, leftist infighting, monetising feminism, ‘girl boss’, all soul crushing nonsense. Capitalism consumes everything. We should tear down the unreachable anxiety filled idea of perfectionism and move from hyper individualised narrative to collective action to create hopeful, rebellious, collective, systems of care. This is a call to arms for change.”\n\nThe single releases alongside a performance video filmed in an abandoned leisure centre pool in East London, watch below now.\n\nDream Wife - Who Do You Wanna Be?\n\nLondon-based trio Dream Wife have today announced their brand new single “Orbit” and tour dates across UK, IE and US. “Orbit” follows the previously released singles “Leech” and “Hot (Don’t Date A Musician)”, and is taken from their highly anticipated third album, Social Lubrication, which will be released on June 9th.\n\nThe band explain, “Written through the joy of jamming together and locking into the groove like a multi limbed space age organism, ‘Orbit’ has a dance rock edge from the early noughties of bands like New Young Pony Club and Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Lyrically, it was inspired by post-lockdown London coming back to life and sharing a space through friendship and community. And how each day you never know what’s in store for you or how a stranger can become someone close to you -for a day, a heartbeat, a phase, or a lifetime.”\n\nWatch the Sophie Webster directed video for “Orbit” below:\n\nDream Wife - Orbit\n\nThe band’s autumn tour kicks off stateside in September for a number of shows before their UK/IE leg in October, which includes their biggest London show to date at Electric Brixton. Ahead of the tour, they’ll also be performing at a number of summer festivals and have just been announced as special guests at Le Tigre’s London show. All dates below and tickets on sale HERE."
