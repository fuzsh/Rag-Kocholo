        "text": "G4yBoy provided a very early set, then Dream Nails, a band who played the Bodega in December and I’ve seen many times, were on next, presently down a trio, but as strong and brilliantly militant as ever. They passionately believe in themselves and the DIY ethic, and encourage others to do the same. Their car had broken down earlier and they arrived very shortly before going straight on stage. Such determination! A storming set as ever, vocals shared between Anya and Mimi, with Lucy supporting with the inter song chat and providing drum sticks for anyone who wanted to form a band. “If you form a band we will come back here and support you on the bill,” she said.\n\nDouble dream night as Dream Wife returned to Nottingham for an intimate show, on Valentine’s Day in \"the city of love.” Tonight was dedicated to all the bad bitches but especially to Alice's mum watching at the back of the crowd. “Support your local bad bitch. We are all bad bitches and gender is a construct,\" says lead singer Rakel. Gracefully and with determination, she is the pivotal force on stage, behind which Alice and Bella chaotically smash the tunes out and jump about having the time of their lives.\n\n\"Are you feeling hot? said Rakel after only four songs, seductively asking Bella and Alice in turn. “Well, I'm kinda warm,” said Bella. Alice on the other hand said she was super hot and apologized for removing her jacket to her Nanna, who was also at the back of the venue. And straight into Hot (Don’t date a musician). Over the years Dream Wife have matured musically and the latest album produced by Alice which was delayed due to the pandemic really shows their strengths, but also their calmer side. Whilst everyone still wants to hear FUU, Hot, Somebody and Hey Heartbreaker, they also included songs like Hasta La Vista in the set.\n\nThe biggest cheer tonight went to Alice's Grandmother. Invited on stage, she showed that whatever your age, life is for living and make the most of it. The crowd were chanting “Bad Bitch, Bad Bitch!\" and she enjoyed every minute of the night, even posing for photos with fans and Rakel at the merch table later. We now know this bands motivation, power and joy is in their genes. “I am not my body I am somebody,” demanded Rakel with the crowd chanting it back at them.\n\nI’ve not felt the floor at the Bodega heaving so much from dancing for ages and it was a pure joy to be there with everyone dancing tonight. I missed their DJ set later unfortunately as I had to get home and prepare for seeing them again the next night in Sheffield. Tonight, take with you the generosity, the anger, the support and the joy, that all the bands gave you and as the posters around the venue said “the best way to support the band is to buy from a concert.” Support Dream Wife, live, because they are one of the best bands around at the moment."
