Unfortunately there seems to be too much business and not enough pleasure on the part of Effie. When Clemson meets Tarji, a princess trained in all the arts of pleasing men, he decides he wants an old fashioned girl. Princess Tarji's father is king of oil-rich Bukistan. Because of the oil situation and to maintain good political relations during the courtship between Clemson & Tarji, the State Department assigns a diplomat to maintain protocol until the wedding - Effie!",

        "text": "Definitely feels like this aimed for satire (has any movie hated the institution of marriage more than this one???) but the misogyny is too outsized to work (how it stripped Cary Grant of all his charm is wild to me), Kerr's feminism is pretty radical for a 1953 Hollywood film but is too often belittled by everyone else to keep its bite (especially when she chooses to stay with him even though all he does is be a piece of shit and whine about her job), and the overall Orientalism and paternalistic \"freeing\" of Tarji is just plain cringey.\n\nSo bad that Cary Grant temporarily retired and turned down Sabrina and A Star Is Born.\n\nDeborah Kerr is enchanting. The screenplay is not.\n\nNot worth it to laugh at how backwards racist and misogynist it is, even as it's trying (sort of?) to be forward thinking for its day about the topics.\n\nAlso not worth it as a hate watch.\n\nNot funny enough, intentionally or otherwise, and not broken and stupid enough to scream at.\n\nIt's just plain boring stupid, and the least likeable of all Cary Grant characters I've ever seen. Dude's a total pig, with nothing to redeem him, but of course he still gets a happy ending.\n\nGrant's still good, don't get me wrong, and Deborah Kerr is fantastic whenever she's on screen. Beginning to think Grant-Kerr is my favorite pairing for my favorite actor."
