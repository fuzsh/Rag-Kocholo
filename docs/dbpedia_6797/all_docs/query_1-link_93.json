        "text": "MGM Original One Sheet Poster (27x41) Folded Fine Plus to Very Fine Condition\n\nMGM Original One Sheet Poster (27x41) Folded. Cary Grant plays a businessman married to a diplomat. Their marriage is stressed and Cary tries to find true love with a princess from the fictional country of Bukistan. If this sounds silly, it is. And Cary is smoking from a hookah on the poster! After this film was made Cary Grant entered a period of self-imposed absence from films. It wasn't until Hitchcock persuaded him to make TO CATCH A THIEF that Grant was back on the screen. This poster is in very fine condition with only minimal signs of wear and some minor fold separation. MovieArt guarantees this poster to the be authentic one-sheet for this film. MovieArt Austin will sell NO reproductions.\n\nSIDNEY SHELDON - Director\n\nCary Grant - Actor\n\nDeborah Kerr - Actor\n\nWalter Pidgeon - Actor\n\nBruce Bennett - Actor"
