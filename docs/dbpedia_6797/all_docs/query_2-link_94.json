        "text": "The word Actor is a definition of a person who acts regardless of sex so this definition is for either a male or female actor. Actors indicate our emotional development and responsibilities in life.\n\nWas you an Actor or a viewer? this is extremely important as it the answer can indicate exactly what steps you need to take during your storybook of life.\n\nMaybe you have been feeling out of control in relation to your own destiny? If you dream of seeing an actor on stage then it is a sign that you need to be responsible for your own life and stop blaming others for your decisions. This dream can also indicate that your mind is often detracted from actual reality, therefore it is important that you can identify that at times you live in a fantasy world.\n\nIn your dream you may have\n\nWitnessed a drama or a play with actors.\n\nMet a famous actor or actress.\n\nSeen someone in motion pictures, on television or broadcasts.\n\nHad a relationship with an actor.\n\nDetailed dream interpretation\n\nDreaming about a famous actor or actress may be a wish fulfilling dream or it could hold important messages about ourselves. We admire celebrities and we may wish to have some of their characteristics. Consider the personality traits, or any other trait that attracts you to that person. By doing this you will figure out why you are dreaming about them. If you are dreaming that someone is acting, you may be dreaming about yourself. The dream could be pointing out some of the roles that you play in life.\n\nWe all have many different rolls, like: parent, spouse, lover, student and professional etc. We behave somewhat differently in each of those roles. The actor in your dreams could be showing you how well you \"play\" some of your roles in life, or how others perceive you. In life we sometimes have the ability to approach problems in different ways.\n\nEach and everything that you do means that it should be carefully thought out and then acted upon. Without this approach to life things become difficult. Therefore, in this dream it indicates that you need to think about your role in life and be careful you don't overdo it.\n\nIf you dream that you kissed an actor it means that you need to show the real person and asset yourself in social contexts. If you dream of being in a play then your sense of entitlement encourages your indolence approach to matters of the heart.\n\nIf you dream of acting on TV then you need to recognize your own accomplishments. If you dream of attending drama school then your mere existence justifies exceptional treatment. This means you are going to do something worth-while in the future. If you lack skills at drama school then sometimes you cannot be bothered with the minutia of obtaining professional training, or exams and it maybe worth-while to do so.\n\nIf the actor in your dream has arrogance and belief that he or she is superior to others then the dream demonstrates your ability to function in society. If you dream of an actress then a business opportunity will soon come into your life. It may mean that you need to recoil, bolt, or obstruct each and every stage of the negotiations or the transaction.\n\nA dream involving you acting in a play means you need to get to the bottom of a situation. If you are an actor on TV this shows the need to distance yourself from others, it may mean you are playing a part in the storybook of life which will clearly limit your development to be able to make firm and successful decisions.\n\nIf you are a man and dream an actor this suggests an unstable figure in authority (if the man is not an actor himself)\n\nIf a women dreams of being an actress then it shows that it is important that she has unrecognized parts to her character and her self - which must be discovered!\n\nFeelings that you may have encountered during a dream of an actor\n\nConfident, not confident, being on TV and being famous."
