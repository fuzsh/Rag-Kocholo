        "text": "Since they shared their debut single ‘Big Shouty‘ with us back in 2020, Problem Patterns have been lighting up our musical radar with their relatable, riotous anthems. The Belfast-based DIY punks have progressed from making music together as a hobby, to becoming a personal favourite of Riot Grrrl icon Kathleen Hanna, winning a Northern Irish Music prize, and supporting the likes of Le Tigre and Dream Wife on tour. These accomplishments are the product of sheer determination, authentic friendship and a shared defiance in the face of adversity.\n\nOn their debut album Blouse Club, Alanah Smith, Bethany Crooks, Beverley Boal and Ciara King use their collective talents to rage against misogyny, classism and homophobia in both societal and industry spheres. Not defined by traditional band structures, Problem Patterns routinely switch up instruments and mic duties for their songs, which makes for a refreshing take on the subject they’re tackling. This collective instinct, raw emotion and radical resilience permeates each of the twelve tracks on their debut full length record.\n\nPowerful opener ‘Y.A.W‘ – an acronym for ‘Yes All Women’, antagonising the social media hashtag ‘Not All Men’ – is a visceral rumination on the universal rage and despair that permeates our consciousness in the wake of public violence towards women, in particular, the misogynist killings of Sarah Everard and Aisling Murphy. It’s a vehement, necessary anthem for women and girls who have spoken out against violent misogyny only to be told they’re “just a bitch who can’t take a joke”.\n\nAs Alanah demands “Who do we call for help? / When the help seems like a threat to me?” her bandmates create a cathartic cacophony of relentless sound around her. ‘Y.A.W’ is such a direct moment of unleashed anguish that it sets the precedent perfectly for everything that follows on Blouse Club. The aptly titled ‘Big Shouty’ is based on the band’s own personal experiences of sexist bullshit, with each verse tackling some of the comments they’ve received during their time together. Problem Patterns’ ability to recycle this rage into hard-hitting, but hugely enjoyable anthems is what makes Blouse Club so compelling.\n\nWhether it’s Bev gleefully chanting “When the people are hungry / they’ll eat the rich!” on ‘Advertising Services’, Ciara screaming through the chorus on ‘A History Of Bad Men Part II’, or Alanah acknowledging the burnout that comes with chronic illness on ‘Picture Of Health’ (“I will never be the picture of health / I just wanna be better to my self!”) there’s always a palpable sense of relief when Problem Patterns unpack these unfiltered feelings and frustrations. Drummer Beth undoubtedly feels this in every cell of her body when she steps up to the mic to perform the excellently named ‘Lesbo 3000’. She directly calls out the homophobia experienced by queer women, with her extended screams of “Call me a Dyke!” making for a bold and empowering moment of reclamation.\n\nThe band serve listeners another vital dose of this empowerment on the seminal ‘TERFs Out’. Alanah rightfully highlights that “LGB is nothing if not for the T!”, as they tackle transphobic attitudes. The track reiterates all that Problem Patterns stand for and provides a vital statement of support for their trans friends and fans in the process. The anthemic ‘Letter Of Resignation’ flows in a similarly cathartic vein, as Bev steps forward to celebrate queer ally-ship and tear down those who discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, specifically in places of employment. “I’m standing up for who I believe in / you can’t fire me, I’m leaving!” she chants in playful defiance, surrounded by riotous riffs and marching beats.\n\nOn ‘Pity Bra‘ (which GIHE premiered ahead of the album’s official release!), Alanah tells the story of an important night that Problem Patterns spent watching Sleater-Kinney back in 2020, that strengthened the creative foundations of the band. It serves as an interlude on Blouse Club, but it’s transient moments like this that accurately reflect the importance of nurturing platonic bonds, as they can be just as passionate and fulfilling as other relationships.\n\nThe band provide further aural antidotes and release more pent up frustrations on ‘Who Do We Not Save?’ and ‘Poverty Tourist’. The latter calls out the appropriation of working class culture in the music industry, whilst the former takes aim at the incompetent Tory government and their continued attempts to privatise the NHS. Both are bursting with the group’s trademark empathy, anger and wit, helping to offset the anxiety of the uncertain times we’re currently living through.\n\nNamed after the unofficial speakeasies that were frequented by women in the wake of World War II when they were denied the right to drink in public bars, Blouse Club is the musical manifesto of four friends whose sound refuses to remain underground. Together, Problem Patterns use their collective talents to create riotous feminist punk anthems that provide comfort and catharsis in equal measure, and their debut album is a powerhouse example of these undeniable skills.\n\nFollow Problem Patterns on bandcamp, Spotify, Twitter (X), Instagram & Facebook\n\nPhoto Credit: Carrie Davenport\n\nKate Crudgington\n\n@KCBobCut\n\nHaving fallen in love with North Yorkshire festival Deer Shed when I attended for the first time last year, I was super glad I got to go again this year. Highlighting a real family focus, whilst hosting an incredible range of exciting new artists, it oozes the warmest of vibes and – being smaller in size than most other festivals – creates a space that feels comfortingly intimate; an inclusive safe haven for artists and fans of all genres and ages. Whilst providing a child-friendly environment (with an array of activities organised specifically for them), this does not take away from the quality and array of performances on offer for everyone to enjoy. Although I’d say I’m in the minority of attendees who does not have children (or isn’t a child themselves!), I in no way feel this to be hindrance – it is still very much an ‘adult’ festival, just one that happens to also be a safe and fun environment for kids to be in too! And, amongst those performing, a fantastic amount of female, non binary and queer performers are represented, which makes for a pretty dreamy time. I was lucky enough to catch lots of these over the weekend – a good balance of artists I already knew and loved, and those who I had not had the chance to see before.\n\nHaving settled into our pre-pitched tent (a revelation saving so much time and energy that I will be doing it at every festival going forwards!), our first taste of live music of the weekend comes from Bristol dancehall artist Grove. With an immense, swirling energy, they treat us to a unique fusion of “deep and dark” trip-hop with funk-fuelled UK Garage beats. From songs lusting after MILFs (“true pillars of society“) – a sentiment which goes down well with the child bearing crowd of Deer Shed – to raging anthems berating power-hungry landlords and the monarchy, Grove offers a perfectly riotous joy to kick off the weekend.\n\nBack at the In The Dock stage (though I feel they could well have headlined the main stage), Dream Wife are as dreamy as always. Blasting into action with a blistering rendition of the title track of their latest album, Social Lubrication, they follow this with some older favourites – “Hey, Deer Shed“, front woman Rakel greets us, before spinning into the joyous allure of ‘Hey Heartbreaker’. Although I’ve seen Dream Wife live at least three times before (the most recent time being just a few weeks ago supporting the legendary Le Tigre), this is the first time I’ve seen them perform to an audience filled with children, and it really is quite special. As predominantly young girls fill the first few rows, bopping up and down either on their own accord, or on the shoulders of their parents, the sense of awe and wonder is palpable; Dream Wife exude such a magnetising power and grace, and for these children to have a band of women/non binary/queer folk to look up to, dance along with and potentially aspire to be is something that’s truly inspiring and wonderful. Not that it should be a novelty or unusual, but – as Rakel reflects (prompted by 7 year old Erin whose tooth has just fallen out, just like it did seeing the band two years ago) – “I wish I’d had a band like this when I was growing up“. Attempting to make their set “PG” (with just a couple of endearing and necessary slip-ups!), Dream Wife hail all the “Bad Witches’ in the room, as they sing of wanting to “Freak you out” with an immense, fun-filled charisma, and deliver the poignant message of ‘Somebody’ with even more stirring magnitude than usual. A true force to be reckoned with, unifying and immersing audiences of all ages and genders with their trademark blissful charm and captivating majesty. And then, a fantastic set is made even more memorable as GIHE fave Straight Girl makes a special guest appearance, swirling across the stage and into the crowd with their unique fierce energy.\n\nSo, thank you Deer Shed for another gorgeous weekend, I’ll see you again next year (not even holding it against you that I came back with Covid…)! Stay tuned for photos of, and words about, of Days 2 & 3!\n\nWords: Mari Lane / @marimindles\n\nPhotos: Paul Dawes / @pauldawesart\n\n“Music isn’t the cure, it’s the remedy.”\n\nFollowing their 2018 self-titled debut LP, and 2020’s sophomore record, So When You Gonna…, London-based trio Dream Wife – consisting of Rakel Mjöll on lead vocals, Alice Go on guitar/backing vocals, and Bella Podpadec on bass/backing vocals – are set to release their highly anticipated, riotous third record, Social Lubrication on 9th June via Lucky Number; a collection of playful, political punk with a lust for life. Entirely self-written and self-produced by Dream Wife and mixed by legendary duo Alan Moulder (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Killers, Depeche Mode) and Caesar Edmunds (Wet Leg, Beach House), Social Lubrication perfectly channels their live wire intensity into ten tracks of raw truth.\n\nOpening with riot grrrl moxie, the infectious Bella bassline of ‘Kick in the Teeth’ (“I spent so much of this youth questioning my value / Lolita’s all grown up now, who knew?”) is followed by the scuzzy Alice Go Go Go riffs of ‘Who Do You Wanna Be?’. Rakel’s rebellious attitude screaming for increased collective action – away from soul-destroying “social media activism without action” – and decreased hyper-individualism. “Exhausted by the pressure to feel somewhat empowered / It’s only 8AM, and I haven’t even showered / Guess perseverance is the boldest thing one can do.”\n\n‘Hot (Don’t Date a Musician)’ evokes the playfulness of CSS and the rock and roll grit of Motörhead. “Don’t date a musician / They’ll think your competition / I was never competition / I was just… hot” Rakel states, her on-the-nose humour backed up by a refusal to be reduced or intimated for being a woman who makes music. Title track’Social Lubrication’ flows in a similar vein, as the trio, exhausted, refuse to pander to patriarchal bullshit. Rakel delivers her spoken word verses with urgency across distorted garage guitar: “What’s it like to be a woman in music, dear? / You’d never ask me that if you regarded me as your peer.”\n\n‘Mascara’ is a love letter to the mundane – but no less important – moments of life, and provides brief respite before Dream Wife are out for blood with ‘Leech’. Screaming for empathy and calling out double standards through frenetic fuzz (“Fuck those who call themselves a friend, but they don’t lift a finger! / Fuck that WhatsApp group where they got points for nailing a fresh-faced singer!”) before crescendo-ing into cathartic feedback. (“Nobody really wins in a patriarchal society. We all lose.”)\n\n‘I Want You’ and ‘Curious’ leave us lusting over Social Lubrication. the first is a filthy Be Your Own Pet-esque punk rocker, and the second is a hot bisexual/polyamorous anthem (“She loves you but she is curious about her love for me… / You’ll all be middle-aged men one day / And I’ll be a middle-aged Dream Wife”). Nostalgic for the early noughties, Dream Wife enter the stratosphere with the New Pony Club/Yeah Yeah Yeahs-inspired ‘Orbit’, closing Social Lubrication with a pulse-racing, disco-punk groove. It’s an unapologetic record that speaks to “systemic problems that cannot be glossed over by lube,” and that’s something we fully endorse at Get In Her Ears.\n\nPre-order your copy of Dream Wife’s new album Social Lubrication here\n\nFollow Dream Wife on bandcamp, Spotify, Twitter, Instagram & Facebook\n\nKen Wynne\n\n@Ken_Wynne\n\nPhoto Credit: Sophie Webster\n\nA bittersweet reflection on losing someone you love and as a result a part of yourself, Birmingham-based band Beorma have shared their latest single ‘Without You’. Mixing R&B and indie pop sensibilities with a smooth heartfelt vocal, the track is an unexpectedly upbeat listen, brimming with emotion and a melody that warmly rushes the senses.\n\nFormed of Ferns, Tom and Paul, Beorma performed separately in different bands before they began working together during lockdown in 2020. Sending ideas back and forth online, the band’s collaboration led to the creation of their debut EP Virtual Emotionality, which they released in early 2021. Following on from their previous single ‘Her’ – which captured the inner conflicts of desire and the need for distance when it comes to a breakup – on ‘Without You’ Beorma gently muse on the gap that’s often left by grief.\n\n“With a lot of our songs we like to touch on darker subjects and ‘Without You’ is exactly that,” Ferns explains. “It’s the dark side of loss; it’s about not only losing something/someone dear to you, but most importantly losing yourself and crying out for meaning and purpose in order to find your footing in this world again. I think it’s important for people to listen to it and let it speak to them in whatever way it does.”\n\nBeorma will be supporting Dream Wife on the Birmingham date of their UK tour at The Castle & Falcon on 24th March.\n\nListen to ‘Without You’ below.\n\nFollow Beorma on Spotify, Twitter, Instagram & Facebook\n\nKate Crudgington\n\nKCBobCut"
