        "text": "Single review by Julie Riley of I am HER\n\n‘Hasta la Vista’ opens with a riff fitting of a Blondie hit song which is then accompanied by a crystal clear pop vocal. I am reminded of Cyndi Lauper, Wendy James of Transvision Vamp and Sarah Nixey of Black Box Recorder, all at once – all of whom I love. This sound is different to the Dream Wife we knew before. It’s more electro punk pop. It has a simple, clean upbeat sound but there is a sanguine yearning about it that gives it depth and nods to grungier genres.\n\nDream Wife say of this song:\n\n“Hasta is one of the first songs we wrote after we completed our touring cycle for our debut album. We’d played over 200 shows in 18 months and had returned to London to discover that things around us had changed and so had we. Close relationships fell apart and others came together. This song is about accepting and embracing that change and being thankful to what that was and what it is today.”\n\nIt is certainly a song for this time as the personal resonates with our wider situation. The lyrics may sound like a goodbye but this track will stay with you.\n\nDream Wife’s new album is out 3 July and can be pre-ordered here."
