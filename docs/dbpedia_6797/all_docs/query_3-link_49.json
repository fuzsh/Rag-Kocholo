Some types of dreams can even impact your sleep quality. Dreams about former partners are not uncommon. Research suggests the occurrence of an ex in dreams depends on your relationship status at the time of the dream.\n\nSeeing people you know in a dream is quite common. In recalled dreams, people see an average of four characters. Who these characters are can vary. Studies show that both single people and those in relationships have dreams involving former partners. But if an ex appears in your dreams, it is understandable to wonder what it means.\n\nUnresolved Feelings About Your Ex\n\nOne interpretation of seeing your ex in a dream is that you have not fully moved on from the relationship. If you still have feelings for your ex, they may appear in your dreams because dreams can replicate reality. However, your real-world feelings toward your ex do not necessarily have to be romantic ones. You may also experience frustration, anger, sadness, or jealousy.\n\nPast Trauma\n\nA possible cause for dreaming about an ex may be past trauma from your relationship. Research shows that stressful emotions and trauma during waking hours can impact the subject matter of your dreams.\n\nTrauma can also come from the death of a partner or loved one. Dreaming about a deceased partner can be a method of managing grief Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . A trained therapist can help you explore the meanings of these dreams and assist in processing your grief and trauma.\n\nRecently Seeing Your Ex\n\nWhether by scrolling through social media or bumping into them at the grocery store, seeing your ex can trigger their appearance in your dreams. An ex showing up in your dreams may simply be part of memory consolidation Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information.

Research shows that dreams most frequently incorporate events one to seven days after Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source the event experience.\n\nSimilar Relationship Concerns\n\nSome studies have shown that elements of a relationship can manifest in dreams. For example, if you have been cheated on in your relationship, you are more likely to dream about infidelity than someone who has not. These types of dreams can occur even after you have broken up. Dreams of this nature may indicate a need for closure with an ex. They might also reflect concerns you have about infidelity in a new relationship.\n\nIn other cases, these types of dreams may represent parallels in your waking life. If you are questioning the honesty of your friends, you might dream about an ex cheating because the emotions are similar.\n\nYour Ex Symbolizes Something Else\n\nA dream about an ex might not be about your previous partner at all. Instead, your ex can represent another element in your life.\n\nIf you are wondering what seeing an ex in your dream means, consider how you feel about them and what memories you associate with them. Those emotions may be the more significant component of the dream rather than your ex. For example, if your ex brings feelings of stress or frustration, consider what in your current life is causing those same emotions. Keep in mind that major life changes, such as pregnancy or trauma, can also affect your dreams.\n\nWhat Does It Mean When You Dream About Someone?\n\nThe meaning you take away from any dream greatly depends on what dream theory or combination of theories you believe. Dreams may be directly related to daytime experiences and reveal meaningful information to the dreamer Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source , or they could provide a virtual reality model to practice for real-world interaction Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . There is also a theory that proposes that dreams come from stored memories.\n\nSome researchers propose that recognizing the emotional state or feelings in a dream is key to interpreting and understanding the dreamâ€™s meaning. In addition to the events of a dream, consider writing down the emotions you felt as well as your responses to those emotions. These feelings can help you gather a broader picture of your dream and help you identify if the dream is about your ex or something deeper.\n\nIf you want to be more aware that you are dreaming as a dream takes place, you can explore lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming may help you gain further insight into your emotions during the dream itself.\n\nIf you are curious about finding meaning in your dreams, consider keeping a dream journal. When you wake up, write down what you recall from your dream. If you regularly see your ex in your dreams, you can identify patterns among the different dreams."
