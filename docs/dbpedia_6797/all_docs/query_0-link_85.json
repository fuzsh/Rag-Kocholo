        "text": "Dream Scenario ending spoilers follow.\n\nEverybody is dreaming of Nicolas Cage in the excellent new satire Dream Scenario, which is out now in cinemas.\n\nThe movie sees unassuming academic Paul Matthews (Cage) start to appear in the dreams of people around the world, turning him into a viral star. Initially, it's all a bit of fun as Paul doesn't really do anything in the dreams, just stands around observing.\n\nHowever, when the dreams turn into nightmares where Paul does unspeakable things, Paul's life starts to crumble and his reality becomes a living nightmare as he's spurned by friends and colleagues.\n\nBut why Paul, why was he appearing in everybody's dreams? Let's dig into the ambiguous ending of Dream Scenario to try to explain.\n\nMajor spoilers ahead if you haven't yet seen the movie.\n\nDream Scenario ending: What happened to Paul?\n\nWhen the dreams turn into nightmares, it leads to Paul losing his job, as his students no longer want to attend his lectures. But it's not just his students – people are openly hostile to him in public, and one outburst from Paul in response goes viral.\n\nHe eventually has a nightmare where dream-Paul is trying to kill him, and he releases an apology video that doesn't go down well. \"Am I not the biggest victim here?\" he says, which doesn't exactly help.\n\nIt all comes to a head when he's told to stay away from his daughter's school play. Paul tries to force his way in, accidentally injuring a teacher.\n\nThe movie then cuts to some time later when Paul has disappeared from public view and, for whatever reason, the dreams have stopped. Meanwhile, a company has developed \"dream travel\" technology that allows companies to advertise within dreams.\n\nWhen we see Paul again, he's split from wife Janet (Julianne Nicholson) and he's finally written a book. It's about his experience but he finds out that his publishers renamed it I Am Your Nightmare rather than his suggested title Dream Scenario.\n\nIn the final moments, Paul tries out the dream-travel technology for himself, hoping to travel into Janet's dream. We see a recreation of a dream Janet spoke about earlier in the movie where Paul appeared in David Byrne's iconic oversized suit from Talking Heads' 1983 tour (and the Stop Making Sense documentary).\n\nAs he reaches Janet, Paul starts to float away and we hear Paul say, \"I wish this were real,\" leaving it ambiguous as to whether he's just imagining the dream he heard earlier or if he truly did travel into Janet's dream.\n\nDream Scenario explained: Why were the dreams happening?\n\nDream Scenario leaves it open to interpretation why the dreams were happening and doesn't seem too interested in explaining why. Even when they end, the only explanation is that \"people stopped having them\".\n\nEarly on in the movie, when Paul starts to appear in people's dreams, it's suggested that it's all a version of the Mandela Effect, where people misremember a significant event. It could be that a few people dreamed of Paul in a normal way, but then the more people spoke about it, and as Paul went viral, the more it happened – or people think it did.\n\nIf this was the case, Paul never really dream-travelled, but just happened to be in people's dreams because he was in the zeitgeist. And when some people had a darker version of Paul in their dream this also ended up rippling outwards into everybody's dreams.\n\nAssuming the dreams were real, though, an explanation for why they became nightmares could be linked to Paul's life. Originally, he's just a mild-mannered and dull individual, meaning that when he did appear in dreams, he did so in the same passive way he goes through his life.\n\nHowever, when Paul's former colleague published a book on the same idea he had when they were working together, Paul gets annoyed. This could have then led to the switch in dream-Paul's behaviour, which only got worse the more that people criticised him in real life.\n\nIt's up to you whether you believe that the dream technology at the end confirms that Paul really did travel into people's dreams or if it's just a sham from a tech company seeking to make a quick buck on a viral news story.\n\nThe same ambiguity applies to the very final scene of Dream Scenario. If you want to be positive about it, then Paul really did have an emotional reunion with Janet. But if you want to be negative, then he was just having an ordinary dream and didn't even get to see dream-Janet.\n\nWhatever really happened, Paul's life is definitely never the same again after the \"dream epidemic\", as one news reporter calls it. It had real consequences, whether it was all fake or not."
