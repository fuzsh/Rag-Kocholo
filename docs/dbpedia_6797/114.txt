1953’s Dream wife, co-starring Deborah Kerr, may not be one of Cary Grant’s best known films.

But its posters and lobby cards are very popular because they have that great title, and fun artwork of Cary (often in fez). They are also more affordable than many of his better known titles, and so present a good option for a gift on a birthday or anniversary.

This original US cinema Lobby Card has a scene with Cary and Deborah, as well as Betta St John.
