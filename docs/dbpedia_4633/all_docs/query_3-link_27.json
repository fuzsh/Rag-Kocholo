        "text": "As I stated in my previous posts, Honorifics, Navigating Genre and Navigating Media, I’m no Ein when it comes to anime/manga.\n\nSo when people started calling each other things like “Weeboo” and “Otaku,” I had no clue whether they were complimenting or offending each other. Before I busted out the phrase “No Waifu, No Laifu!” I decided to look up what these things meant. Since I am equivalent to all things amazing, I’m sharing with you what I learned over the last couple years in a series of posts called A Guide to Common Anime/Manga Lingo for Newbies.\n\nSo lets review some terms you may hear thrown around to describe people and characters. Enjoy!\n\nFan Based Lingo\n\nSometimes Japanese words will take on a new meaning when they are used to refer to anime/manga (and fans). Words have also been created over the years to explain various practices or sub-cultures in the anime/manga community.\n\nCosplay – short for “costume play.” Cosplay is the act of dressing up as an anime character; mostly during anime conventions\n\nExcellent Sebastian cosplay from Black Butler\n\nCanon – in reference to anime/manga, canon is a word used to represent the original work or story.\n\nUsed often in fan fiction to describe the official story/plot in which the fan fiction is based on.\n\nExample: “this fan fic story is pretty close to the canon material.”\n\nFandom – term used to describe the community that surrounds a show/game/book and (in this case) anime/manga.\n\nFangirls/Fanboys – a group who obsesses over a fictional character, actor/actress, series.\n\nGetting overly excited over hearing news or seeing your fave character/series, is known as “Fangirling” or “Fanboying”\n\nFan-Fiction/ Fan-fic – fiction written by a fan of, and featuring characters from, a particular series, manga, OVA, etc.\n\nFujioshi (pronounce) – a person (typically female) who has a passion for Yaoi and will ship the characters of the anime/manga.\n\nLaifu – a slang word for life; using a bad stereotypical Japanese accent.\n\nOtaku (pronounce) – this term can be used to describe someone who is obsessed with any kind of fandom.\n\nIn Japan, “Otaku” is a somewhat derogatory word that implies someone is so obsessed with something that they cease to be a functional person (ie: obsession interferes with work/school, hygiene, health, etc)\n\nIn Western culture, the word is used by fans to describe themselves as simply a hardcore fan of Japanese culture, anime, and/or manga.\n\nWeeaboo (or Weeb) (pronounce) – a derogatory English term used to describe a non-Japanese person obsessed with Japanese culture. This obsession may extend to emulating Japanese culture in everyday life.\n\nWaifu (pronounce)– a coined term by fans to mean wife (again using a bad Japanese accent to say wife). It is used to describe a fictional 2D character (from an anime/manga/video game, etc.) with whom one is attracted to.\n\nSome people take these “relationships” very seriously, considering the 2D character to be their significant others.\n\nA spin-off term, “Husbando“ represents those who feel this same love/commitment towards 2D male characters.\n\nOooh… someone’s Waifu had a birthday.\n\nIt wasn’t mine. I don’t have a Waifu or a Husbando.\n\nAlso, I now want cake.\n\nAnime & Manga Style\n\nThe words below often are used to refer to an anime/manga style being represented. For more information on various Anime genre, check out Navigating Genre!\n\nLolita (pronounce)– Japanese fashion style that depicts girls dressed up in Victorian-like outfits or “baby doll” dresses, to make them appear doll-like.\n\nChibi (pronounce) – Japanese slang word for “short/small” person. It is used in anime/manga to refer to the style of drawing characters with oversized heads.\n\nThis style is mostly used to enhance a cute/humorous moment in anime.\n\nMoe (pronounce) – typically refers to archetype of cute, innocent, vulnerable, and submissive.\n\nOften times, it is used in description of under-age girls in anime that are intended to attract male viewers.\n\nThe term is also used for items associated with “cute characters” such maid outfits, glasses, uniforms, etc.\n\nCommon Words to Describe Emotions & Personality Traits\n\nBishoujo (pronounce)– young, beautiful girl\n\nBishonen (pronounce)– attractive, perhaps effeminate boy\n\nKawaii (pronounce) cute; pretty\n\nKowai (pronounce) – to be scared; feel fear\n\nNotice the pronunciation difference between Kawaii and Kowai. Kawaii is pronounced like “Hawaii” and Kowai is pronounced “ko-why.”\n\nTsundere (pronounce) – a character who comes off as indifferent, cold, or even hostile. Gradually, these characters show a warmer side over time.\n\n“Tsun,” from the word “tsuntsun” means turn away in disgust.\n\n“Dere” from “deredere” in Japanese means become lovey/affectionate.\n\nTaiga from Toradora isn’t always so cheerful\n\nYandere (pronounce) – a character who is normally sweet and calm in demeanor. However, once they have decided they like someone (romantically), they’re personality changes to become stubborn, bossy, abusive, even violent.\n\nReady for a Challenge!?!\n\nHere are some Advanced Words to Describe Emotions & Personality Traits\n\nAtama ga ii (pronounce)– bright, intelligent\n\nAwateru (pronounce)– to panic\n\nFrom the word Awa, which means “disconcerted” or to “lose one’s head”\n\nAwateru is a verb and is often used with another word.\n\nDarui (pronounce)- describes that heavy, lethargic feeling.\n\nDarashinai (pronounce) – someone who is lazy; messy\n\nDoji/Dojikko (pronounce)– clumsy, clueless\n\nHansamu na (pronounce)– handsome; good looking\n\nHazukashii (pronounce) – embarrassing, shy\n\nKashikoi (pronounce)– wise, smart\n\nKibishii (pronounce)- severe, strict\n\nNamakemono (pronounce)– lazy\n\nShinsetsu (pronounce) – kindness, gentleness\n\nYabeeyo/Yabee (pronounce) – dangerous\n\nYorokobu (pronounce) – to be delighted, to be glad\n\nUreshii (pronounce) – happy, glad, pleasant\n\nSo, now you should all be aware just what a kawaii, ureshii, and slightly doji person I am.\n\nDid I miss something? Let me know. Did you learn anything? Comment below 🙂\n\nAlso, if my list is looking a bit too nice (because sometimes people are jerks), don’t worry. I’ll be telling you all about how to insult someone in Japanese soon!\n\n~ Kimmie Kawaii"
