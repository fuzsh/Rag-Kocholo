        "text": "So, after re-evaluating several parts of the manga, I've come to the conclusion that the character writing for its protagonist is a lot better than I previously gave him credit for, even for his commonly criticised portrayal in the Cell and Boo Arcs. I'll be using this thread to explain why rather than bumping the Character Analysis thread since this is going to be a long entry. Feel free to discuss the points I bring up along the way.\n\nAs an introduction, I'd like to bring up how character writing is treat by the fanbase and how its \"simplistic\" characters are treat. Yes, Dragon Ball's characters have somewhat simplistic personalities in terms of having clearly defined character traits and the series having a fairly simple good vs evil divide in its conflict. However, that's not to say DB's characters completely lack depth or complexity as both those attributes can be seen if a character responds to a situation realistically and have at least some level of conflict within their actions, of which can be seen in Goku and several other DB characters. Without further ado, onto the analysis.\n\nPart 1 - Dragon Ball/Part 1 Era\n\nIn his introduction, Goku is a fairly simplistic character, though that's not to say he's one-note. He has notable naivete when it comes to society and the sexes and despite having a clear set goal in mind, he isn't selfish like modern material and the fanbase like to paint his character as always being. This is probably seen best in him saving Umigame. Whilst he did have Umigame not looking tasty as a reason for sparing him, there was no need to make such a detour in the quest for the Dragon Balls if he was self-centred and expecting something in return. This selflessness also helps contrasts him with the other main characters, with the main cast in this arc being at the most selfish we'll see in the series as a collective. Despite that, he also has quite a simplistic moral compass when it comes to death as he has no problem killing all manner of wild beasts due to living in the wilderness. This trait is made retroactively better when getting to the Saiyan Arc and seeing how at his least developed, Goku's nature still had inklings of a Saiyan's savagery.\n\nThese traits continue to be established in the Red Ribbon Army Arc in which he chooses to save Jingle Village at the expense of putting his journey on-hold. Still, we see the simplicity expected of someone raised in the wildnerness for most of their life as it can be easily argued he may not have helped out had Suno and her mother not saved him from the cold. Along with that, his moral compass is simplistic enough in that he just needs to be told someone is an enemy in order to have no qualms beating them up.\n\nHe is still aware enough that killing without a valid reason is bad, however, when believing he killed Metallic. Despite that, he isn't too affected by it, showing just how his natural lifestyle on Mount Paozu has taught him that death is a natural part of conflict, as well as perhaps being evidence that his Saiyan instincts may have played a part in his early characterisation.\n\nAnother common misinterpretation of Goku's character is that he's dumb in all but battle. Whilst a lot of his ideas come about through battle, not all of them are ones conventional of martial arts. Instances such as pointing out Kuririn having no nose should mean Bacterian won't affect him, pouring tea down Murasaki's bamboo shoot or breaking the wall to freeze Buyon all require some level of critical thought (which again makes his portrayal in Super all the worse, but that's for another time).\n\nDespite not liking innocent people being harmed, Goku also isn't bothered if they wish to sacrifice themselves, as seen in his reaction to the village chief saying to beat White even if he has to die himself.\n\nGoing back to his morality at this point, we can also see he has no problem with killing those he considers bad if they are at the level where they'd hurt his friends, threatening to kill Blue and being pretty happy Taopaipai died.\n\nThis reinforces the idea that whilst Goku is selfless enough to help out strangers, he only actively seeks to kill people at this point if they personally affect him by harming his inner circle. This is soon seen again when, despite Black fleeing, Goku actively pursues and kills him for being the leader of the Red Ribbon Army.\n\nShifting gears to Goku's being pure-hearted in riding the Kinto'un and negating the Akkumite Beam, his actions still correspond with that. Baba even makes it apparent Goku's more animalistic upbringing could've been a factor in this.\n\nAnd as we'd see later on in the manga with Vegeta, being pure of heart doesn't really mean being a paragon of good.\n\nThat said, Goku being pure of heart has more to do with being pure and genuine in his motivations.\n\nNow, Goku's experiences in West City are quite interesting in showing his growth as he's able to quickly deduce those asking him for money aren't going to help him. When actually getting help, he simply gives the woman all the money he earned.\n\nThis is interesting not just in seeing how alien something like civilisation is to Goku, but also his perception of the world and various concepts. Whilst most will view money as a goal to strive towards in collecting it, Goku sees it as a means to an end and paper that has little value beyond what society places on it. In that respect, there's some surprising similarities between Kid Goku and an Ubermensch character like Conan the Barbarian (the novel version, not the movie one) - both being \"noble savages\" of sorts that create their own moral code rather than following societies. In fact, a lot of Saiyan attributes can be seen as somewhat Nietzschen, but more on that later.\n\nBeyond things such as his match with Kuririn showing the difference between Goku fighting a regular opponent and Goku fighting a friend, as well as some growth in his social awareness with him being able to deduce Upa is a boy without his trademark patting, there isn't much to add on Goku's character until we get to the Piccolo Daimao Arc. Against Tambourine, we see Goku at the angriest he's ever been as he'll do everything he can to kill Tambourine and avenge his best friend.\n\nAgain, Goku's friends (especially Kuririn) are extremely important to him, something Super seems to ignore. There's more to this than to a lot of other Shonen protagonists who get angry at their friends being in danger though, as you have to consider that until Bulma, Goku's only human contact was to Gohan who died when Goku was very young and left such a mark that Goku treasured his Four Star Ball as a form of contact. These bonds are something Goku went without experiencing fully for years and the severing of them offers far more impact because of this.\n\nWe further see this not only in his killing of Tambourine, but that of Drum and his threat to Piccolo Daimao when discovering the latter also killed Roshi.\n\nGoku was going in out for blood, a stark contrast from his later battles, though this will soon be elaborated on.\n\nAlso, take note of Goku's reaction upon finally defeating Piccolo. This will become important when I get on to covering the Freeza Arc.\n\nAfter beating Piccolo Daimao, Goku had become somewhat arrogant in believing he'd reached the top until Popo schooled him.\n\nThis goes quite a bit in explaining perhaps the biggest change in his character in the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai and one that would redefine his character for the rest of the series - sparing Piccolo. He explains this as due to not wanting to kill Kami, which makes sense when he's spent 3 years with him. However, he also makes it apparent he also doesn't want to lose the only other person who can challenge him at this point.\n\nThis decision makes sense when taking the previous part with Popo into account. Goku has been told by both Roshi and Popo that there is always a stronger fighter out there and to not get overconfident, yet where would he go after definitively proving he is the strongest in the world and if he were to let the only contestant for that title die?\n\nAlong with that, his increased value of life is explainable through his 3 years of training in which we see meditation as a part of it, an act meant to empty the mind and to avoid vices such as anger.\n\nOn top of what Popo and Kami may have taught him on the matter, we can deduce that Goku may have gained an extra understanding of the aftelife, as the idea of souls wandering for eternity due to their fate being one that definitely goes against the possible perception that all souls may end up where Gohan did. That said, I'd say we're given enough to piece together why Goku's change in mindset happened and how it is decent growth for his character.\n\nBefore wrapping up the DB material, one additional thing to point out is Goku's reaction to Kami offering him the title of God. Keep that in mind as we move onto the Saiyan Arc..\n\nBut that will have to wait for another post as this one has gone on long enough. Hope you found this first part interesting, at least.\n\nPart 2 - Saiyan/Freeza Arcs\n\nWith his opening appearance in the Saiyan Arc, we see the major change in Goku's maturity - having fully become a husband and father. Contrary to the meme of \"Goku is a bad father\" we see Goku doing a good parenting job with Gohan as he teaches his son what the objects and people around him are as a good parent does.\n\n[/spoiler]\n\nAlongside that, Goku still allows Chichi to have her way in raising Gohan, despite personally not liking it.\n\n[spoiler][img]https://mangabeast.com/manga/Dragon-Ball-Full-Color-Saiyan-Arc/0002-009.png\n\nMoving back to his response to Kami offering him Godhood, Goku wouldn't bother listening or staying with Chichi if he didn't enjoy her company. Contrary to how they're presented in Toei land, their marriage is pretty stable and Goku is now pretty open to compromise. Of course, there's also the motivation of him fighting Raditz being to rescue his son.\n\nContrary to how modern material paints him, Goku isn't always wanting a good fight beyond all else. He's actively scared by both Raditz and the idea of enemies stronger than him.\n\nAs for how Goku is more excited when facing later opponents, that will be explained shortly, though it's worth noting his fear for Raditz trumping that of many later foes far beyond his power would be due to this being the first time since becoming adept in sensing Ki that Goku has sensed someone so far above him.\n\nAlso, Goku is the one who comes up with the plan to take down Raditz in grabbing his tail. This reinforces the leader role and pedestal he's later placed on by his allies. It's not that Goku is often the strongest, but that he's the one who usually comes up with the plan to defeat a new enemy which is why his allies place their hopes on him.\n\nIn the Raditz meeting, we also see a major change in Goku's morality. Whilst before he only seemed concerned with those who personally interacted with him, he is now so attuned to civilisation and human morality that he'd rather die than kill innocent strangers.\n\nOne thing that tends to get looked over by a lot of people is Goku's reaction to hearing Raditz say that their parents are dead, contrasting it with his appearance in the previous page.\n\nGoku goes from standing tall defiantly to hunching back somewhat, Kuririn seemingly taking note of Goku's reaction. He may not have known them personally, but the confirmation his parents are dead troubles Goku nonetheless. This may be different if he was aware of how they acted as Saiyans (prior to the Minus retcon, anyway) though.\n\nMoving onto the Raditz fight, we have Goku infamously sparing Raditz and completely dropping the ball. This is pretty consistent with his previous sparing of Taopaipai when he begged or his later sparing of Freeza. When seeing the similarity between all these, it becomes less about Goku being naive or dumb and more to do with a consistent character flaw of his - Goku isn't the type of person to beat someone when they're down or kill them if they're begging for their life, regardless of how much he hates them (especially in the case of Freeza). This can be seen as something Gohan or Roshi may have taught him, or perhaps something that was further emphasised through Kami's training and value of life.\n\nOf course, we can't analyse Goku's character without talking about his first death. Despite knowing he would be revived, Goku is pretty calm for someone who just got pierced with a searing drill of energy, even cracking jokes as he dies.\n\nThis goes back to Goku's upbringing and his training with Kami, learning that death is something to be accepted in life.\n\nOne interesting part of Goku's character in this arc is him coming to terms with his heritage. At first, he's completely against the idea of being a Saiyan. Even if it's a fact, he wouldn't accept being associated with their lifestyle.\n\nAfter having months by himself and likely having some time to reflect internally, there is a clear change in Goku upon reaching Kaio's.\n\nGoku has completely accepted his heritage, even if he doesn't choose to follow it. It also makes sense for this change to occur without any sort of internal conflict arc as, like with accepting to marry Chichi, it doesn't take Goku too long to accept important events for what they are, which is pretty consistent with the Buddhist-esque teachings associated with actions such as meditation and increasing spirituality as Popo's training focused on, coming to accept mortal events for what they are.\n\nMoving onto Kaio's training, this interaction shows that Goku is quick to understanding the situation. Again, Goku isn't dumb as Super likes to paint him as.\n\nMoving onto the fight with Nappa and Vegeta, we have more instances of the original manga not lining up with Super's flanderisation in Goku putting his friends before himself. Him getting angry over their deaths and offering a hit to Nappa for each of the dead is obvious, but it's also worth noting how he chooses to give the Senzu to Gohan and Kuririn rather than saving any for himself, something he'd repeat on Namek.\n\nOnto the fight with Vegeta and we get a line that, for many, will come to define Goku's approach to battle for the rest of the series.\n\nIt's worth noting even Goku is surprised he's getting excited despite the situation. The Namek Arc will later somewhat explain this as a natural reaction due to his Saiyan blood.\n\nThis leads into a decision that, no matter the rationale, was selfish in his sparing of Vegeta due to how strong he was. This, however, is still consistent with his character for similar reasons to with Piccolo. After reaching what seemed to be the pinnacle of training, Goku still couldn't defeat Vegeta and, as we'll later see with Boo, the idea of not being able to defeat an enemy by himself is something that dissatisfies Goku when his journey thus far has been one of becoming stronger and proving himself in battle. He also says that he'd be sure to defeat Vegeta next time, which is reasonable when even if needing to resort to teamwork, the three remaining fighters would have enough time to formulate a more solid plan and wouldn't need to worry about Oozaru.\n\nSome would also cite this as inconsistent with his altruistic personality thus far, with even his sparing of Piccolo having a more benevolent excuse for it, but to say that would be to underestimate realism in his character. If the good guy is constantly being selfless 100% of the time then they are not only one-note, but far too unrealistic in their motivations. Goku's balance between self-centred and selfless actions are what help with the writing of his character and making it feel more realistic.\n\nGoing back a bit to Goku VS Oozaru Vegeta, one thing often overlooked is Goku's sadness in realising he was the one who killed Grandpa Gohan.\n\nAlong with hoping Gohan would forgive him, this is one of the few moments where we see Goku accept that the situation is hopeless for him and that he can't win. Once more, he's even accepting of a seemingly inevitable death.\n\nFinally for this arc, there's Goku's encouragement of Gohan.\n\nWhilst he does get sharp with him on the last page, that's after some kind encouragement of him. All that, plus seeing the man he cares for most hurt, is enough to send Gohan into a rage and face Vegeta alone. Compare that to Piccolo's strict teachings and insults at Gohan's weakness resulting in Gohan cowering from Nappa for most of the fight and it's safe to say the \"Piccolo is Gohan's dad\" meme isn't as accurate as we'd like to think.\n\nOnto the Freeza Arc, there isn't much to add for the earlier portions. It is worth noting Goku always having a plan remains consistent here.\n\nOther than that, just more confirmation of Goku caring for his son and friends during the battle with the Ginyu Tokusentai. Despite the idea that Goku always puts a good fight above everything else, he tries to remain true to his promise to Kaio and the warning he was given.\n\nAlso, his reaction to Vegeta needlessly killing those far weaker than him shows a striking difference between his adult and kid selves and an extra sense of maturity in life's value. Whilst Reacoom and Butta fit with Goku not liking the idea of killing a helpless enemy, Vegeta killing Jheese is a major change from back when he slaughtered Red Ribbon soldiers and Mazoku.\n\nThe main bulk of Goku's character moments in this arc, of course, come during the battle with Freeza. First, his words here show that regardless of the situation, Goku is diligent in upholding his promises, reinforcing him sticking by his word to Kaio until there was no other choice.\n\nGoing back to Goku being somewhat disturbed by the revelation of his parents' death, his resolve in defeating Freeza being strengthened by Vegeta's words reinforces this compassion, not to mention being moved by Vegeta stripping down all his layers and pleading to Goku to defeat Freeza. This respect for Vegeta's Saiyan pride and acceptance of his own are a nice little bit of character growth when contrasting it to how he was against Raditz.\n\nNow, the biggest major criticism to give to the Goku VS Freeza fight is the whole opening act being both parties warming up. From a pacing perspective, this is indeed a problem, though it makes sense for Goku's character. Back in the Saiyan Arc, he made note of trying not to use Kaioken unless necessary and even stayed at a resting state of 5k against the Ginyus, only using close to his full power in bursts. It makes sense for him to conserve his Ki until sure he'd need to use more. This also makes the battle fairly similar to the Piccolo Daimao fight, of which I'll touch on again soon...\n\nMoving onto the main event and Super Saiyan, we have Goku being fairly arrogant compared to usual, letting Freeza hit him and letting his enemy go 100%.\n\nHowever, that third and last pages justify his reason for acting this way. Due to the pain Freeza has caused him in killing Kuririn (seemingly permanently as far as Goku knew at that point), he doesn't want to just kill Freeza, but truly humiliate this person who has gone unchallenged his entire life. He wants to break both Freeza's body and spirit.\n\nBefore going into the conclusion on that, I'd like to rectify a point I used to make in that Goku declaring himself a Super Saiyan seemed quite a random choice when he had little to no knowledge of it beforehand. However, he clearly accepted the pride of the Saiyans as his own in this fight and, as we'd later learn in the following arc, the Super Saiyan form has its own unique Ki signature to separate its signal from base.\n\nChapter: 331 (DBZ 137), P13.3\n\nGohan: “It’s fa-father!!! It’s the same ki as father back then!!”\n\nNote: Gohan says it’s the ‘same ki’ (onaji ki), rather than the ‘same amount of ki’ (onaji gurai no ki).\n\nThat said, Goku deducing that this was indeed what Vegeta spoke of (as Gohan quickly did too) makes sense and lines up with Goku being quick to catch onto the situation.\n\nGoing back to the fight with Freeza, we get up to a major chance in Goku's motivation - quitting the fight. This does line up with Goku's motivation in fighting Freeza too that I already elaborated on, with Goku providing all that needs to be said here:\n\nAlso, the last panel lines up well with Goku's initial morality of mainly just caring for those who help him. Whilst Kami's teachings and eventual maturity would've had him value all sentient life, he still has enough realistic self-centredness to not be bothered sparing Freeza as long as he remains oblivious to his crimes. In other words, Goku's morality is far more interesting than a paragon of good, whilst far more selfless than the charicature of him only caring about fights.\n\nThe Freeza fight is in some ways similar to that against Piccolo Daimao, and not just in that they're the two best villains in the franchise. Both are villains that lead to the death of Kuririn and bring Goku's rage to new heights through this. The difference lies in the conclusion of these fights. Whilst Goku ends up bringing himself to the limit and being ecstatic at avenging his friends against Daimao, it's a far different situation against Freeza, all illustrated in this one, powerful expression.\n\nFreeza's desire to prove he couldn't be surpassed lead to him weakening himself, and putting him down long after Goku was satisfied in having proved himself was far from worth the build-up he'd been given to it. There's a lot of things to draw on this about Goku's characterisation, this exchange being another one leading up to it:\n\nIn maturing as an adult, Goku has fully learned the value of life and been able to sway two enemies thought irredeemable into at least some form of alliance. Him failing with Freeza can be seen as a reminder to him that some villains can't be talked out of their actions, something that creates a decent contrast when leading into Gohan VS Cell. It could also be that this moral code of not killing an enemy he perceived as helpless had to be broken here due to Freeza's inability to be reasoned with, leaving Gou dissatisfied with both the fight and himself.\n\nThat said, Goku's growth in these arcs, particularly his characterisation as a Super Saiyan, are a lot more interesting than I previously gave credit to. Next time, onto the Cell and Boo Arcs.\n\nKeedounan said:\n\nWho knows, maybe one day, we'll find out that Jiren was actually a good character after all.\n\nHis manga self is a masterfully written, thought provoking character....when stacked up against his anime incarnation at least.\n\nFantastische Hure said:\n\nYou know the weird thing is that despite Goku being good until the Cell saga, AT said Goku always viewed even his family as only \"companions\".\n\nWhilst Goku's family will be a major point in me tackling the Cell Arc, it makes sense for that to be how Goku viewed his family. Goku's only companionship prior to Bulma showing up was the OG Gohan and, going back to the first part of this analysis, this has affected Goku's personal relationships with others. As a person who never grew up with any concept of romantic love and had limited familial ties from whatever young age he decided to look at the full moon, his perception on the difference between his love for his friends and that of his family would be skewered, beyond the simple fact that one of them lives with him.\n\nFantastische Hure said:\n\ndespite Goku being good until the Cell saga\n\nAnd without further ado, time to defend his Cell Arc characterisation\n\n[youtube]KAHLwAxS7FI[/youtube]\n\nPart 3 - Cell Arc\n\nI'll start by jumping far ahead in serialisation to Trunks: The Story to point out an important thing about Goku's fatherhood, specifically Future Gohan's character.\n\nGohan loves and respects his father enough to dress like him and aim to be as strong as he was, with Gohan still judging himself as not measuring up to his father. This shows in a unique difference between Gohan and his father and a reason as to why Gohan had yet to surpass his father - patience. Like when Dodoria was slaughtering Namekians, Gohan is compelled to stop them harming innocents.\n\nOf course, Goku also doesn't take kindly to innocent people being killed but, unlike his teenage self, Goku by the time of the Cell Arc has matured enough to think with a level-head about rushing into a battle without a solid plan.\n\nRather than going in guns blazing, Goku waits until there's an opening to save his friends without directly confronting Cell in battle.\n\nMoving back to the start of the arc and we have one of the most difficult to defend moments for Goku's character in him deciding not to take out Gero early.\n\nI concede it would make more sense to have the Z-Warriors instead warn Gero, with his updated data making the Artificial Humans stronger in a far more convincing way than \"muh time travel changed everything\" but I'll also say the result we got is in line with Goku's character. Whilst they could have warned Gero, that would be assuming someone as pragmatic as Vegeta or Piccolo wouldn't seize the opportunity to just kill Gero and, as mentioned prior, Goku disdains killing helpless foes. It's also important to note Goku wasn't forcing his opinion on Bulma and was merely giving his rationale. I'd say this is far more reasonable than Tenshinhan being so obstinate as to fight without care for the results on the same page or Vegeta providing a pretty big threat to Bulma on the previous page:\n\nThat said, Goku's decision here is fine. Whilst he may always have a plan, it's reasonable that warning Gero didn't cross his mind or that he was worried about how Vegeta would react if they found Gero. Another major point would be that they still had far from definitive proof to determine whether Trunks' story was truth or a well thought out lie, so tracking down Gero and (seeing as it'd be the only option beyond killing him) keeping constant surveillance on him based on questionable leads is something a lot of people may be against.\n\nThis is important when comparing it to Trunks and Kuririn destroying Gero's underground lab and present Cell since that was after direct confirmation that things had truly escalated (not to mention the time traveller hell-bent on changing the future leading the charge).\n\nOne overlooked part of Goku's character for this arc is his relationship with Chichi. In a scene that is played off as a gag, we do see a decent interaction between them.\n\nChichi conceding to let Goku have his way and comparing that to the start of Z shows that whilst both can butt heads when it comes to their motivations for Gohan, they are both capable of compromising as is common in a stable relationship. The worry in Goku's face when putting the bandages on Chichi shows just how guilty he feels about hurting his wife too.\n\nMore on their relationship when moving onto the Boo Arc. For now, back to Goku and Gohan...is what I'll say when getting the stuff prior to the Rosat out of the way. First, more of Goku showing he cares for the lives of strangers that are lost due to his battles.\n\nThis (and a lot of the Cell Arc's) cases of civilian casualties is additionally potent when remembering that Goku and his friends ultimately decided their course of action in dealing with Gero and that Goku's character flaw in his mercy lead to this. It's easy to see why his expression of rage here is enough to match some of his previous bests when the blood is vicariously on his hands.\n\nHis reaction after waking up also shows this somewhat in the page's first panel, his expression seeming as sullen as you'd expect of someone who's been unable to help out, whilst the last panel also shows his ability to think of the bigger picture.\n\nNow, just before getting on to Goku and Gohan...Upon taking Gohan to train, Goku's reply to Kuririn's question is important in rationalising his mindset when it comes to practically every major villain he's fought since at least Vegeta.\n\nGoku may get excited fighting a powerful enemy, but his fear against Raditz wasn't some outlier. He can be both scared and excited facing off against a new threat, with his desire to fight for what he wishes to protect and to prove himself having been what's often had one outweigh the other. Getting a bit scientific, adrenaline and the fight or flight response are natural reactions when faced with fear, so Goku's response and mindset is pretty well grounded in reality.\n\nI will touch on Goku keeping promises later on, but going back to his mention of their promise on Namek, there's this exchange just before Goku enters the Rosat with Gohan.\n\nGoku says a lot to Vegeta without spelling the point out, with Vegeta's reaction saying it all. Whilst Goku would want to fight Cell, it's just as good (if not better) that an ally who he can soon test the limits of his training against proves himself strong enough to take care of Cell in the mean-time. Goku hasn't forgotten his promise to Vegeta and with Vegeta declaring he'll defeat Cell, Goku's looking forward to the potential of having their long-awaited rematch. Nice subtlety there, Toriyama .\n\nOnto the Rosat training:\n\nFirst off, it's pretty commendable Goku can remember these details about the room that he learned as a teenager. Kind of questionable he'd remember them and not the full details of Trunks' warning, but memories tend to be stronger depending on the experience and, as we'll soon see, it could be that Goku is better at long-term memories. Beyond that, him making it clear his aim is primarily on improving Gohan shows just how much he values his son's progress, somewhat foreshadowing what will happen at the Cell Game whilst also shown his role as a father. Not long after, we see just how he tutors Gohan in becoming a Super Saiyan:\n\nAs we'd later see, Goku's advice and positive encouragement would yield fruit in Gohan achieving what Goku set out to accomplish with him. Compare this approach to Piccolo's training method in the Saiyan Arc and I think it's safe to say who's training Gohan benefited more from. Also as a side note, I find Goku's reaction of \"Freeza then! I don't care\" nice in showing despite his mentor and father role, Goku is still as easy-going as always and doesn't get caught up on the minor details.\n\nOf course, in the training, we end up with Goku deducing it's best to master regular Super Saiyan and showing his ability to think both quick and looking at the bigger picture. One thing that doesn't get brought up much is how much of a good job Goku did in cutting Gohan's hair. Again, the idea of battle being his only use is debunked.\n\nSpeaking of Goku's mentor role, one thing I forgot to mention in the previous part was how Toriyama was pretty good at using visual storytelling to display the development and growth of Goku's journey as a martial artist. Starting with Z, his gi became a good way of displaying his mindset as a martial artist with how he previously left its Kame kanji intact and identified as a Kame Sennin student, later incorporating Kaio's kanji into it after being tutored by him. It makes sense he wouldn't have included Karin's or Popo's at any point when there was no time to add in the former's at the time and the latter had no real symbol (the Kami kanji would be fairly unnecessary when Kami didn't train Goku personally). Upon going to Namek and replacing both with the Go kanji, there's a lot to draw from this in that Goku has incorporated the teachings of all these masters and, believing this to be the peak as far as others could tutor him, considers himself and his accumulated experiences as his own teacher in martial arts. To quote one of the most badass and tragic villains in fiction, \"Now I am the Master\" (I swear that'll be the last Star Wars reference I make in this post).\n\nThis helps explain Goku's role in the narrative. Whilst I have problems with a conflict directly related to Goku and Trunks not being directly solved by them and by Gohan instead, it makes sense for Goku to pass the torch from a narrative perspective when he has become a mentor as Roshi once was and is reaching the peak that his character growth can go.\n\nBefore jumping fully into his main decision of the arc, we get to see Goku reaffirming his desire to keep promises, his good long term memory and his good paternal role in one single page:\n\nThe following page also has a lot to unpack:\n\nHere, we see Goku enacting and teaching the lesson once taught to him about not over-training, quite fitting for his role as the mentor in this arc.\n\n[youtube]bxU2eqZtYmc[/youtube]\n\nClearly Goku's better at keeping his promises than I am 2.\n\nHowever, this relaxed attitude can be seen as multi-faceted. Take into account Yamcha's premonition, as well as that of Freeza's:\n\nIt's established having premonitions for a crisis or impending death are a thing in DB, likely a sense of sort brought about through adept Ki control. That said, and looking back at things retroactively, we can infer Goku may have had a feeling that some tragedy awaited them, hence the \"probably\". Assuming he did have an inkling of his impending death, it may have been what motivated him to spend what days he had at peace with his family. Goku providing enough time to conceive Goten with Chichi in that timeframe as opposed to just a day of resting during the 3 year training would help support this too, him providing extra attention to his wife and her needs in case the worst may happen.\n\nThen we get to Goku's decision of throwing the fight and bringing Gohan in. Many criticise this as a \"Goku is a bad father\" moment, but that couldn't be further from the contrary. Firstly, Goku clearly states why he is doing this:\n\nIt's hard to argue with Goku's decision. Gohan had not only been trained for years to face this threat, but had kept up with or surpassed far more experienced friends and foes alike in the past, having also surpassed Goku here. Before Goku tells Gohan to save the world, he first asks Gohan whether or not he could keep up with that fight. Again, he talks clearly to his son and judges whether or not he's ready rather than flinging him into the fight unprepared.\n\nFurthermore, Gohan has done all this and surpassed the Goku who once saved the world against Piccolo Daimao in the past by a nigh-infinite degree, the reference to the Daimao Arc even being brought up prior:\n\nWhilst Piccolo Daimao is an ant at this point, back then he was the biggest threat imaginable and it was a child who beat him. Cell is no different in Goku's eyes, a foe who could be matched or defeated by a very special child and there was no other choice really beyond everyone attacking Cell at once.\n\nOf course, the elephant in the room when it comes to all this is Goku giving Cell a Senzu. I'd say this is one of the more difficult parts to justify beyond Goku's desire of a fair fight, but that alone sets the room up to do so. It's important to note that beyond Cell absorbing humans for nutrients (in effect, little different from his perspective to humans killing animals for the same purpose, something Goku's very accustomed to) and destroying an army that provoked him, Goku doesn't really have much of a reference to Cell's evil deeds when he was in the Rosat during him bombing the islands and his TV hijacking. As far as Goku's seen at the time, Cell may be the most reasonable villain he's faced in a long time, especially with him having enough of a warrior's pride to host a tournament. This would later be proven wrong with Cell having way too much Freeza in him, but based on what Goku knew, there seemed little to suggest Cell wasn't just an arrogant yet honourable fighter like Vegeta; especially when 3/5 of his genetic make-up include Goku and two villains he reformed.\n\nNow, Goku's decision to have Gohan jump in was shown to be flawed. There are many points on Gohan's character change being contrived I can agree with, though this is a dissection of Goku's character and not his son's. That said, Goku making a decision based on the limits of his knowledge and being shown to make a mistake is not only understandable, but realistic. There is absolutely no person alive who hasn't made one major mistake in their judgement based on a limitation in knowledge and for Goku to constantly make the right call would simply make him a Gary Stu impossible to connect with. It's not as if he brushes off his mistake either. Upon seeing he was proven wrong, his reaction says more than words can:\n\nEven before that, the last panel of this page paints clearly what I said before:\n\nGoku shows in his expression he doesn't like what he's putting Gohan through, but there's no other choice he can make.\n\nWe know the drill from there. Goku later sacrifices himself in a meaningful moment in which he realises he's the only one who can stop the current situation, even showing his regret at leaving Chichi behind.\n\nThen we get to his refusal to be brought back to life and...this is the one part of his character in this arc I can't defend. Firstly, the part about \"Bulma said I attract bad guys\" is wrong as far as I'm aware. Kaio tells Goku this when Goku wanted to go to New Namek. I think Bulma may have said something along those lines in the Red Ribbon Army Arc when they were facing General Blue, but I honestly can't find anything. Nitpicks aside, Goku's reason makes no sense considering past villains. Pilaf and the Red Ribbon Army would've searched for the Dragon Balls regardless of Goku, with the latter likely getting their wish. Goku is vicariously responsible for Piccolo Daimao in that Pilaf unsealed him, though I'd question the thought process of anyone who places the blame on not letting someone kill them and take over the world because they'd unseal a demon you had no knowledge of years later, the same going for Dr. Gero and his creations in this arc. The Saiyans did come to Earth because of Goku, but only because they brought him there in the first place, leaving Mecha Freeza the only villain who's appearance on Earth can be solely placed on Goku's actions and that didn't matter when Goku/Trunks quickly took care of him. Overall, this is one red flag in Goku's character that was just an excuse to solidify his arc of passing the torch to Gohan, despite their being far better alternatives such as explaining how him not stopping Gero when he could have lead to all this.\n\nNevertheless, I'd say the pros still outweigh the large con. Even with a questionable ending, Goku's character arc of being a mentor and father to Gohan as well as accepting his mistakes and fully passing the torch were very well done in this arc, even if his character was slightly less consistent than prior.\n\nThis went on far longer than I expected, so the Boo Arc will have to wait for now."
