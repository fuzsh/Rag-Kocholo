        "text": "A Dumbass\n\n1_ give Absolutely no shit about he second son\n\n2_used his one day on Earth to fight instead of spending it with his Family and friends\n\n3_ allowed Buu to get free and feed him energy because he feelt abit bad for Vegeta feeling despite Vegeta killing thousands a second pr\n\n4_Trusted the fate of the world on 2 kids he never met before despite him be Disappointment with their power\n\n5_ refused to kill fat Buu and throw the mess he created alongside Vegeta on the kids\n\n6_ Was very happy when Vegeta Crashed the Potara\n\n7_ understatemnt Kid buu only because of Size, somehow his years of training and Martial Arts and ki sense were thrown out the Window\n\nNo, Goku was a completely Dumbass in this Arc, I never liked goku after this shit\n\nSome of these are petty.\n\n1.) He did meet with and cheer for Goten in the Tournament. And even wanted to play with him later, til all hell broke loose with Babidi.\n\n2.) He came back for the Tournament period. It was supposed to be for fun. And when it was over, they would likely have spent the rest of their time together.\n\n3.) This one has more to do with them underestimating Buu and Goku underestimating Majin Vegeta. It went on longer than he expected and Buu was stronger than any of them expected too.\n\n4.) Goku had faith in the power from the Fusion Dance and he saw how strong the boys were at the tournament. This is just a bad gamble but I don't think it's a good reason to bash him for either. He was also expecting them to fight Fat Buu. Unpredictable stuff like Super Buu showing up later was something he couldn't have foreseen.\n\n5.) He was running out of time and a big attack might have drained him faster. That and like I said, the Boost from Fusion would have been more than enough. He was right in that Gotenks could defeat Majin Buu. But didn't expect there to be a Super Buu.\n\n6.) Not when they were inside Super Buu. But after, yeah, that was stupid of him and the first thing I agree on.\n\n7.) I don't think size is why he underestimated Kid Buu. Initially, it probably did feel like they could take him.\n\nOther than destroying the Potara during the final battle, Goku's mistakes were most based on Optimism and Unforeseen changes in the enemy. Things he couldn't possibly have known.\n\nBuu Saga was him at his most likeable tbh.\n\nSome of these are petty.\n\n1.) He did meet with and cheer for Goten in the Tournament. And even wanted to play with him later, til all hell broke loose with Babidi.\n\nMaybe in anime, in the manga he was simply thinking of his power and later show his Disappointment over it\n\n2.) He came back for the Tournament period. It was supposed to be for fun. And when it was over, they would likely have spent the rest of their time together.\n\nHe come to fight\n\n3.) This one has more to do with them underestimating Buu and Goku underestimating Majin Vegeta. It went on longer than he expected and Buu was stronger than any of them expected too.\n\nExpect Goku himself stating the opposit, he know that Buu was a threat and was aware his actions were not valid, yet still commit them with a smile\n\n4.) Goku had faith in the power from the Fusion Dance and he saw how strong the boys were at the tournament. This is just a bad gamble but I don't think it's a good reason to bash him for either. He was also expecting them to fight Fat Buu. Unpredictable stuff like Super Buu showing up later was something he couldn't have foreseen.\n\nExpect that it was two kids he didn't know or met before, even Gohan who he personally trained for 4 years still ended up fucking shit\n\n5.) He was running out of time and a big attack might have drained him faster. That and like I said, the Boost from Fusion would have been more than enough. He was right in that Gotenks could defeat Majin Buu. But didn't expect there to be a Super Buu.\n\nExpect Goku later state that wasn't the case\n\n6.) Not when they were inside Super Buu. But after, yeah, that was stupid of him and the first thing I agree on.\n\n7.) I don't think size is why he underestimated Kid Buu. Initially, it probably did feel like they could take him.\n\nThey Call him a shrump and smile\n\nOther than destroying the Potara during the final battle, Goku's mistakes were most based on Optimism and Unforeseen changes in the enemy. Things he couldn't possibly have known.\n\nBuu Saga was him at his most likeable tbh.\n\nIt was in stupidity and Blind faith\n\nMaybe in anime, in the manga he was simply thinking of his power and later show his Disappointment over it\n\nHe come to fight\n\nExpect Goku himself stating the opposit, he know that Buu was a threat and was aware his actions were not valid, yet still commit them with a smile\n\nExpect that it was two kids he didn't know or met before, even Gohan who he personally trained for 4 years still ended up fucking shit\n\nExpect Goku later state that wasn't the case\n\nThey Call him a shrump and smile\n\nIt was in stupidity and Blind faith\n\nQuestion.\n\nDo you know how to spell \"Except?\"\n\nAnd again, most of your gripes are petty, but you have a right to your opinion.\n\nOn the last bit, I can't call it \"blind faith\" because Goku knew how strong everyone at that time was. The boys, Fusion, and Majin Buu. What ruined this was Buu turning into Super Buu later. Something he could have never foreseen. It's unfair to blame him for that.\n\nStupidity and blind faith would have been if Goku had knowledge of none of the things listed. (As in, if he knew nothing about the boy's strength, Fusion boost, or Buu's PL.) THAT would be \"blind\" faith.\n\nWeird describes my opinion on Goku throughout the Buu arc. One minute the dudes basically the chessmaster, coming up with plans and ways for others to increase their power, trying to deal with Majin Vegeta as quickly as possible, telling Goten and Trunks to get their heads in the game and telling Vegeta off on letting his feelings get in the way of what they should do... then its revealed he was holding ss3 back for no reason against Vegeta and despite Goku calling out this shit earlier he crushes the potara so he and Vegeta could have a 1v1 with kid Buu until it became clear that he massively fucked up .\n\nA lot of that has to do with retcons and shit since Toriyamma still tried with Gohan as the lead and ss3 was 99% something he didn't think about at the start but still. Goku's brain was working in maximum overdrive before ss3 ."
