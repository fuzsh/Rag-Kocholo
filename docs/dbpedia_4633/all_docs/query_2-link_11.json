Lastly, and I think this gets overlooked... I think Vegeta degressed in character development when he transformed into Majin Vegeta. This leaves Goku as the only one I like during the Saga. Also, kid Goten and kid Trunks are the worst Z Fighters in the series, although I still like Teen Goten and Teen Trunks over Professor Gohan at the End Of Z.\n\nI like almost every major villain in the series...

It's been discussed multiple times in the past and fans have eventually come to the conclusion of ignoring that portion of the story as a whole when it comes to ridiculous implications like Base Saiyans > Piccolo.\n\nThese are just my thoughts on the subject.\n\nAll of this plus the original dub had pretty crappy acting during this arc. Sure Schemmel screamed so hard that he passed out, but everything else was pretty meh.\n\nOne reason why I think a lot of Amercian fans turned on it was because the Buu Saga re-introduced comedy back into the series in a pronounced manner, which I think was off-putting to many American fans who were only familiar with Z and not Dragon Ball, and this included me when I was younger. It didn't help that a lot of it came from Buu or Goten and Trunks, characters I use to find more annoying than funny. Like, Goten and Trunks turning into a Super Saiyan so young is essentially a joke, and that use to rub me the wrong way. Now, I just find it funny, and works as a nice nod to how easily Goku use to pick up on sacred techniques like the Kamehameha (besides, the Super Saiyan legend was already kinda tarnished with how many characters achieved it during Cell and I can believe that Super Saiyan semen makes it easier for the offspring to achieve it). When I was younger, I remember really being disappointed with the arc. I loved most of the beginning bits, but felt the arc peaked with Vegeta's sacrifice, and the rest was a disappointing follow up with some cool moments like Candy Vegito or Gohan's \"I'm here to kill you\", though Gohan's poor performance further sullied the arc for me. Which is another problem most people had with Buu, it fails to follow up the passing of the torch moment in the Cell arc.\n\nHaving earlier this year read the manga fully for the first time, I came away with a much stronger appreciation for Buu. I think it's probably thematically the strongest arc in Dragon Ball, most of the humour really did work for me, the end of the arc is great. And despite how neutered the cast was at this point, there were still little things I appreciated, like showing that Tien survived the attack the wiped out humanity or Piccolo's biding time for Goten and Trunks with Super Buu. But yeah, I did have an issue with how neutered the cast was, and I also had a problem with how back and forth the action got against Buu. The good guys would get a power up and start dominating, things would change and Buu would start dominating, then the good guys again, then Buu, it just become a slog where dramatic weight was meaningless because this deck was full of Uno Reverse cards.\n\nGohan went from being the next protagonist to a joke of himself with the whole \"GrEaT sAiYaNmAn\", and pretty much made any character development in the Cell Arc redundant. As well several other \"Z fighters\" just became no one like Yoshi mentioned. Vegeta became the super embodiment of Work Effect, and became a archetype of a stale character. Goten and Trunks I found annoying as hell and Gotenks wasn't any better. There is also SS3 which was intorduced in this arc, but I ain't even touching on that.\n\nBoo as a villain felt boring to me. He was just like Goku...a super powerful being with the mind of child. How I supposed to be more afraid of them compared to Cell, Frezia, Piccolo, etc? The different forms of Buu weren't anything special and in fact remind me of Jiren, who I hate a whole lot.\n\nI don't mind the fact it went back to its roots of comedy, but it was done badly and sort of felt force because of how serious the Cell saga it just didn't feel like a natural evolution. I could give more detail, but I haven't watched the Buu saga since it aired on Toonami way back in the day.\n\nGohan went from being the next protagonist to a joke of himself with the whole \"GrEaT sAiYaNmAn\", and pretty much made any character development in the Cell Arc redundant.

I really liked Veget'a character development in the Boo saga, particularly when he sacrificed everything to try and beat Boo. For me, there was nothing stale about him.\n\nGoten and Trunks I found annoying as hell and Gotenks wasn't any better.\n\nThe only thing that really annoyed me was that Gotenks inherited Vegeta's arrogance, but didn't have his cerebral capacity.\n\nThere is also SS3 which was intorduced in this arc, but I ain't even touching on that.\n\nYeah...not worth getting into\n\nBoo as a villain felt boring to me. He was just like Goku...a super powerful being with the mind of child.\n\nI actually liked him in the Dub version (and even more when I read the manga). It was playful and fun and had my kids and I laughing at times.\n\nHow I supposed to be more afraid of them compared to Cell, Frezia, Piccolo, etc?\n\nI think the thought of someone with that much power and a mind of a child can be terrifying. You can't always reason with a child and if they flip their lid, a melt down occurs. Then, his other forms made up for that with more strategy and finally, being pure evil and not caring about anyone or anything. But yeah, being pink didn't help.\n\nThe different forms of Buu weren't anything special and in fact remind me of Jiren, who I hate a whole lot.\n\nJust curious...w\n\nI don't mind the fact it went back to its roots of comedy, but it was done badly\n\nSome of it wasn't great...but I don't think all of it was done badly. But yeah, it certainly didn't feel like Dragon Ball.\n\nbecause of how serious the Cell saga it just didn't feel like a natural evolution\n\nThe Cell saga is hard to beat, IMO. I think the thing that was also kind of lacking in the Boo saga is that comparatively to Goku, Buu wasn't actually stronger...Goku said himself he could have beaten Fat Buu. Super Buu was more powerful, but he looked stupid with that banana on his head. I think Kid Buu lost a lot of power...but was pure evil, so I guess that makes a difference. He could destroy everything and survive and didn't mind doing that. He had nothing to prove.\n\nhy do you hate Jiren so much?\n\nNot sure what \"Work Effect\" means here.

The sacrificial part was about the only one thing that was interesting, honestly.\n\nI mean, that is fine. I just found him boring and annoying and not intimidating like how he \"supposed\" to be.\n\nUnless we are talking politics, a villain with a mind of child will never be terrifying to me.\n\nExplaining why I hate Jiren could be thread on its own."
