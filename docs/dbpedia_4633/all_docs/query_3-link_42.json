        "text": "The online world can sometimes feel alien to parents of teens with its unique words and acronyms. But anime – TV shows and movies inspired by Japanese animation – adds an extra layer of confusion as most anime slang terms are in a different language. In this article, we explain the most popular anime words used in plots and storylines.\n\nAt Game Quitters, members of our parent support group often ask questions about the terminology tweens and teens use online. That’s why we’re compiling a series of articles to decode the popular words, phrases, acronyms and hashtags that appear on social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, and video games such as Roblox.\n\nA-Z of anime terms\n\nThis A-Z list of common anime phrases is designed to help parents with kids who are fans of Japanese animation:\n\nAnime – An abbreviation of animation.
