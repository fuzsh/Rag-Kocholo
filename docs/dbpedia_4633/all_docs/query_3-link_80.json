        "text": "Hey Anon it’s Julie. Since Kai and I will probably have different opinions, we might answer it differently. Well, I’m going to go first. Personally I don’t think there’s enough of the mature Yandere personalities in media…It’s mostly kind of just students in high school or whatever. It would be nice to find more Older slice of life heterosexual male Yanderes without the school setting in webtoons, manga, and anime. ┐(￣ー￣)┌\n\nSometimes I also find myself just feeling meh about really anime-like stereotyical Yanderes. Again nothing wrong with that, but I want to experience more variety in Yandere flavors & scenarios that actually have decent stories. It could just be something really mundane for all I know, but still really interesting. I think just having more varieties of Yandere scenarios and adding a human aspect to these characters can make the audience feel more closer to them. Hmm…Probably even in horror too.\n\nActually I would go as far to say especially in horror because then a lot of philosophical questions might be raised due to the character study of the Yandere’s motives. This doesn’t happen a lot but for me it’s kind of more interesting when non-Yandere fans are able to see things from the Yandere’s perspective; side with the Yandere without fully being aware that Yandere fans even exists lol.\n\nHey anon. Kai here for my turn to answer this question.\n\nFor me, I want to see more good/heroic yanderes in media. More common than not, most of these stories are the basic plot of yandere vs. the mc. I want to see an actual yandere X the mc story. While some stories do try to sell their story as a “yandere X the mc”, it usually ends up with the two as a battle of wills till one of the sides fail. Either the yandere, where he dies, goes to jail, or the ominous “Ooo~ he’s still out there” open endings. Or the mc where she dies, gets locked up, or mind broken. Can’t we have a happy ending?\n\nAnother role I want to see yanderes in is anything but in these domineering job positions. All the time, if the yandere story isn’t a high school slice of life bs, the yandere is this ceo in an office work slice of life. The yandere is always this leadership or powerful role in these stories… like a prince or a king or the classic ceo. It would be nice to see a story where the yandere doesn’t have this cheat code to get the girl.\n\nTalking about domineering jobs, I just want the yandere to be less domineering in general. All the time, these yanderes are these domineering pieces of shit. Like, take a chill pill lmao. You don’t always have to be on top bro.\n\nBut in the end, I feel like this is all affected by the type of mc we got. If we got a useless mc, then no matter what flavor you give the yandere, the story would come out pretty bad. But hey! At least people would go, “Man, that story sucked. But at least the yandere was pretty good!”"
