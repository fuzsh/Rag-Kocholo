        "text": "Anime has a visual language that shorthands character emotions and states of mind. The visual language comes from manga and its efforts to clarify the inner world of characters without resorting to words. Visual language can be thought of as a vocabulary of adverbs and adjectives. They add more detail to a character’s behavior. To strain the metaphor, think of nouns as character and environment designs and verbs as how these behave within a story. Some visual words require more thought and exposure to understand. Luckily, these visual words are standard. Some anime use dialects to match the art style of the series. Visual words can be combined to show conflicting states of mind or emphasize one state. Many manga artists create their own visual words, which may become a part of the anime lexicon.\n\nMuch of anime’s visual language focuses on the eyes (the style of the eyes can be considered a noun). Anime uses large eyes because they allow for better emotional expression than small eyes. The face of characters acts as a canvas in addition to a likeness. This view gives animators freedom to change the likeness of a character in order to express the character’s thoughts and emotions in a situation.\n\nThis list isn’t exhaustive, but it covers the most common visual words you will see. It is in alphabetical order.\n\nAbstract Background Patterns\n\nAbstract background patterns explain the feelings of the moment. Fast animations or twirling spirals show how quickly the character’s mind is working, much like gears in a clock. Wavy lines show irritation or upset emotions. Colors such as bright red are used for anger. Darker colors like purples or blues are used to show the characters are feeling sick, upset, or depressed. Patterns vary but here are two of the most common.\n\nArrow Piercing\n\nBento Lunch\n\nBlank Face\n\nBlank White eyes\n\nBleeding nose\n\nCat Mouth/Fangs\n\nCensoring Steam\n\nChibi Deformation\n\nClothing Explosion\n\nCloud of Sparkles\n\nCrying Large Tear Drops\n\nDoll Anatomy\n\nDraining Color\n\nDramatic Spotlight\n\nDull Eyes\n\nElectric Lines\n\nEmpty Eyes\n\nEye Twinkle\n\nFalling Washtub\n\nFloored\n\nFreeze Frame\n\nGhost\n\nHummingbird\n\nGelatin Boobs\n\nKimono/Yukata\n\nLight Rays of Censorship\n\nLong Hair Censorship\n\nOld Man Face\n\nOrz\n\nPerverted Little Man\n\nPopping Vein\n\nPout\n\nPuffed Hair\n\nScare-deer\n\nSecondary Kiss\n\nShort Skirts\n\nSideburns\n\nSigh\n\nSnot Bubble\n\nSpeed Lines\n\nSpiral Eyes\n\nSweat Drop\n\nThigh Show Off\n\nTiny Dot Eyes\n\nAnime’s visual language expands beyond the words I cover here. The visual language varies from series to series, but all the words build off of anime’s simplified drawing style. The simplified style gives animators more freedom to play with visual language where more naturalism would not. The exaggeration of emotions allows anime to cross cultural boundaries. Anime’s visual language builds on common human expressions and behavior.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
