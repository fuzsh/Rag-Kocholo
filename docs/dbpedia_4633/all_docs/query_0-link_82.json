        "text": "A poem that reflects Tidus’ energetic and optimistic nature, his deepening love for Yuna, his inner conflict between saving her and realizing his fate, and finally his bittersweet acceptance as he fades away. It carries both the joy and sorrow of their love, as he cherishes his time with her, even as it comes to a tragic end.\n\nA poem that traces Yuna’s emotional evolution from a dutiful summoner resigned to her fate, to a woman who found love, joy, and hope in Tidus, despite the tragic end of their story. This piece reflects the deep connection between them, the beauty of their shared moments, and Yuna's strength in carrying on despite the loss.\n\nA poem about David's story of survival, love, and sacrifice. He starts as a young man trapped in the brutal streets of Night City, losing his mother and himself to the harsh realities of a cybernetic world. His love for Lucy becomes his driving force, even as he loses his body and mind to cybernetic enhancements. In the end, he gives everything to protect her, finding solace in knowing she is safe, even as the city claims him.\n\nIn this poetic piece, Lucy reflects on her journey with David in a city consumed by darkness. From their initial meeting, where she used him for her gain, to watching him lose his innocence and sacrifice everything for her, Lucy grapples with love, guilt, and loss. Her dream of going to the moon is finally fulfilled, but it is a hollow victory, as she longs for the man who once dreamed beside her, now lost to the city.\n\nThe story of Son Goku is very well known but how much would be different if Goku was a girl? More than you'd think, not as much as you'd hope. Join us as we explore that change and many others.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to get rid of the Great Saiyaman, new plans are made to hit him where it hits him the hardest. If they can't kill him, they will destroy him. A sequel to 'When a Hero Disappears'.\n\nConfused, he tried to make sense of what was happening. One moment he was laying on the ever-green grass in ‘Other World’, trying to clear his head as usual, and the other moment he was standing in a shower in the 'World of the Living’. What the heck was going on? And what did Bulma mean by ‘being already behind schedule’? [Loosely based on the Mirai timeline of RozenPhox's still ongoing fan manga ‘Temptation’]\n\nTwo weeks after the events of the Tournament of Power and Cell Max, Gohan, driven by a fervent desire to comprehend and harmonize the various facets of his life, embarks on an unexpected journey. Motivated by the profound impact these events had on him, he resolves to pen a book on Ki, exploring its spiritual and practical dimensions. As he delves into the intricacies of Ki, Gohan discovers that the process of writing becomes a transformative experience in itself. Fueled by a deep love for his family, the project catalyzes profound personal changes, taking him on a spiritual odyssey far beyond martial arts. Through introspection and exploration, Gohan not only unravels the mysteries of Ki but also unlocks the hidden potential within himself."
