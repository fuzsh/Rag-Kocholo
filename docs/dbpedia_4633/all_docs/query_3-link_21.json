Anime has given a different touch to masculinity as compared to western shows - where an attractive man is usually portrayed as a tall macho dude with 6 packs. However, the concept of an anime boy is generally someone with a soft, cute, lithe yet athletic and badass personality. These hardcore tough guys have feminine qualities which set them apart from the mainstream heartthrobs like Chris Evans as Captain America or Zac Efron as Matt Brody.\n\nAlso, the ideal Japanese male is also much different than a Western guy. Japanese donât desire strong, muscular, handsome Greek God-looking men. For them, the idea of an attractive man is a cool, laidback, charming, gentle guy with adorable looks and a goofy personality. Thus, a male anime character is a perfect combination of manly and sensitive - and women love that!Â\n\nCreate an Animation Video with Anireel\n\nIn simple words, Anireel is software that lets the creators create wonderfully animated videos by integrating fun elements and scenes into them.
