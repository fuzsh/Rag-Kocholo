        "text": "The shonen protagonist archetype is a character who has traits of a protagonist in shonen manga and anime.\n\nWhy This Trope Surpasses Its Limits\n\nThese kinds of heroes have to work hard to improve their capabilities.\n\nMany shonen heroes have grit, as they do not always win and have to push beyond their limits.\n\nNo matter how many odds are against them, they refuse to give up.\n\nThey fight for altruistic reasons, most notably to protect their friends.\n\nThey grow not only in terms of abilities but also in terms of strength of character, as they grow as people throughout their journeys.\n\nThey can be relatable characters, as they represent the fact that all people have their own goals in life, deal with obstacles and find ways to overcome them.\n\nTheir stories show that the destination is not what matters, but the journey and the experiences that are gained from it.\n\nThis is why, unlike traditional superheroes, shonen protagonists resonate with us.\n\nThey are charismatic, as they can turn their enemies and rivals into friends and allies.\n\nBad Qualities\n\nMany shonen heroes are known for being dimwitted, naive, reckless and/or impulsive.\n\nMost shonen heroes can be rebellious, mischievous, unruly and/or temperamental.\n\nThese characters tend to suffer some plot armor.\n\nLike Shojo heroines, many shonen heroes refuse to kill their pure evil and/or too dangerous villains. Most times this leads to half-baked redemptions no one asked for, and the hero never learns and/or accepts that mercy doesn't always work.\n\nQualifications\n\nIn order to fit the shonen protagonist archetype, a character must have at least 4 of the necessary traits.\n\nNecessary Qualities:\n\nHeroic/honorable\n\nCourageous/reckless\n\nEnergetic/Hot-Blooded\n\nPursues a big-end goal\n\nStubborn to a fault\n\nSimple-minded/naive/impulsive/goofy\n\nOptimistic\n\nHard-Working\n\nA determinator (A type of character who refuses to give up, no matter the obstacles)\n\nAdditional Qualities:\n\nBelieves in the Power of Friendship\n\nHas spiky/unnatural hair\n\nPossesses plot armor\n\nHas unnatural hair color\n\nBig Eater\n\nOblivious to love\n\nShort-tempered\n\nHas rivals/mentors\n\nMischievous\n\nRebellious\n\nHas a character they look up to\n\nHas a very tragic backstory\n\nIs an underdog/outcast\n\nIs a delinquent\n\nExamples\n\nAnime/Manga\n\nSon Goku (Dragon Ball): He is the Trope Codifier.
