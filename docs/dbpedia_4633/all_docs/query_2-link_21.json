        "text": "General Tactics\n\nMajin Buu is designed to win neutral and oppress and pressure the opponent. He has tools to function in a lot of different ways depending on the playstyle, but generally you want to stay back and wait for your opponent to make a mistake until you can safely get a hit. In neutral, his ki blasts are at great angles to pressure and poke from a distance, and whenever someone superdashes through them, even in the air the cartwheel is a threat because it can anti air and counter their superdash into a combo. His j.H and j.2H are great to stop approaches and jumping respectively, and if j.2H hits you can convert off it pretty easily. Use Fat throw whenever you can do it safely, as it allows you to dash in on anyone that has no beam to counter it. If you happen to land a stray hit into a combo your first concern should be getting that fat throw in a combo (236H), and once that's done all you have to worry about is what your mixup is going to be. If it doesn't work, strategically retreat back into neutral to do it all over again, and watch your opponent's sanity slowly being drained.\n\nTeam Building\n\nTeam Positioning\n\nTeam Positioning\n\n(Mid/Point > Anchor)\n\nPoint\n\nPoint is one of Buu's best spots. Having access to two assists makes him very scary in both neutral and when pressured, but its weakness is dependent on the team. Generally for a point Buu you need to have a neutral assist (like a beam) and one mixup assist (high blockstun etc), and one thing that remains constant as a weakness for point Buu is that his roundstart is not up to par with most of the top characters in the game.\n\nMid\n\nLikely Buu's best option, but is debatable with point. The idea here is that you get a character that likes Majin Buu's assist and can abuse assists a bit better (examples Kid Buu, Bardock, Videl etc) and has better roundstart options to make the team more threatening at the start of the game. When the momentum is gotten, switch Buu in and then abuse your other two assists, or whatever assist is remaining for the rest of the match.\n\nAnchor\n\nAnchor Buu is hard, but doable. With strong neutral tools, solo restand setups, very high and meter-efficient corner damage, and even higher damage ceilings in Sparking!, Majin Buu certainly has the tools to perform well by himself. However, he operates far better with assists behind him to enable his gameplan and cover his weaknesses. His assists, while great, are not valuable enough to warrant him as an anchor, either.\n\nTL;DR: Still a powerful character if he happens to be the last character on your team, but you generally don't want to use him as an anchor.\n\nPicking Teammates\n\nMajin Buu benefits most from assists that help him set up Fat Throw mix and aid in his neutral. The ideal team structure is one assist to aid neutral and another to aid mixups.\n\nNeutral assists, such as SSJ Goku A or Vegito A allows Buu to get in easily and solves most issues with his own neutral tools.\n\nAssists like Yamcha AGuardAllStartup19Recovery48Advantage+45 , Kid Buu AGuardAllStartup57RecoveryAdvantage+58 , Jiren BGuardAllStartup20RecoveryAdvantage+29 , and many others have a property that leaves the opponent grounded on hit. These assists are especially powerful, enabling Majin Buu's strongest Fat Throw resets.\n\nAssists with high blockstun (40+ frames) are good for Majin Buu in blockstring pressure since he can use them to get mixups off of 214H and enable some of Majin Buu's Fat Throw resets.\n\nRefer to the Fat Throw section for more details.\n\nMajin Buu has many strong partners to choose from, with many powerful assist synergies to enable certain playstyles and gameplans. Below is a \"tier list\" showcasing Majin Buu's strongest teams and unique synergies.\n\nDHC Synergy\n\nMajin Buu's Level 1 Super's huge active frames and fullscreen hitbox lets you DHC safely into other characters. This is especially useful as Majin Buu's Level 1 Super is a reversal, so you can safely switch out in case it gets baited. Below is a list of Sample DHC Synergies.\n\nLevel 1: Janemba, Tien, Krillin, Yamcha, Hit, DBS Broly*GuardAllStartup9+4Recovery37L; 44+7LAdvantage , Kid Buu**, Piccolo**\n\nLevel 2: Trunks, Ginyu\n\nLevel 3: Beerus, Android 16, Cooler, Goku, Trunks, GT Goku*GuardAllStartup12+1RecoveryAdvantage, SSB Goku, Bardock, SSJ Goku, Videl\n\n* Can only be done with this character's \"Teammate Down\" Alternate DHC.\n\n** Inconsistent against certain characters.\n\nCharacter names that are Bolded and Italicized are Plus On-Block after DHC.\n\nBlockstrings\n\nMajin Buu's blockstring structure is fairly basic, but he has many tricks and tools up his sleeve to keep his opponents guessing. Here are some example blockstring enders:\n\n...5H > 214L\n\nA great blockstring ender against most characters, as all of your other specials are either unsafe on block or have a gap that can be easily punished. While you're technically -7, the space 214L creates is big enough to be safe against most characters, save for Vegito. The special leaves you airborne, allowing you to create even more space by backdashing or to steal your turn back if the opponent is unaware, though it is generally unsafe to do the latter without an assist.\n\n...5H > 2H > 214M\n\nYou can purposefully delay the 2H to create a gap after 5H, then 214M to create another frametrap. 214M is also generally a safer option, as it creates more space and has only a 1f gap. The cartwheel will also anti-air Guard Cancels making this blockstring extremely scary to try and get out of, and allows assists to regenerate for longer.\n\n...214H > assist > 66 > ...\n\nGenerally only want to use this with a high blockstun assist, such as Labcoat A or Yamcha A, since they can't be superdashed through and hold the opponent in block for 40+ frames. This creates an unreactable High/Low mixup that is a true blockstring using those assists. Safe to Guard Cancel.\n\n...5H > 2H > 236L/M/H\n\nYour go to blockstring if you want to mix opponents up or catch defensive options. All versions of 236X are overheads, and 236M crosses up at close to mid range. The crossup \"splash\" hitbox has a tight window to confirm, and requires either Vanish or an assist to combo after it. 236L is able to stuff jump attempts, forcing them to air block, leaving you +4 at worst, while 236M is able to catch backdash attemps, hitting them with the \"splash\" hitbox in front of you. 236H is able to catch both options at the same time, making it a useful tool against people who like to try to weasel their way out of pressure. Do note that while grounded 236X is safe on block, even being ±0 at best, it is very easy to punish with 2H or other reversal options after Buu has left the ground, so it is best to use 236X sparingly in pressure.\n\n...5S > Vanish\n\n5S jails into vanish, leaving Buu +2 and able to safely keep pressure.\n\nNote that although 5S technically does jail, 5S > Vanish can sometimes lose to mashing reflect immediately after 5S due to it being a ki blast.\n\nOkizeme\n\nMajin Buu has strong okizeme options on Sliding Knockdown and on Level 3 Hard Knockdown. Here is a list of practical options:\n\nSKD\n\nIAD Safe Jump\n\nOff of 236L/M, just dash into the opponent and then quickly input IAD j.ML/j.H. Usually non applicable midscreen, but is useful to know off a vanish conversion. On j.H sliding knockdown you can do the same, but it's harder to time and can lose to uptech and delay tech often.\n\nFat Throw (214S)\n\nCan only be done in the corner. After 236L/M, simply throw it out. Off of j.H SKD, microdash forward and then input it. Covers all techs and leaves Buu safe from all delay tech timings. Majin Buu is +18 on backtech, +24 on uptech, and +23 if reflected after backtech. Fat Throw is active the whole time its out, so it can stuff any attempts at mashing, invincible reversals (aside from Level 3 Supers), and it outright locks them out of airdashing out of the corner. Generally a fantastic setup to use if you don't want to spend meter.\n\nLevel 3\n\nSuperjump IAD 50/50\n\nSuperjump and airdash, then hold up to float and do an overhead, or hold down to fast fall and then do a 2L low. Overhead option is a safejump and will auto block reversals. Most reliable oki option.\n\nIAD j.M 50/50\n\nDash up and IAD, then press jM. Depending on the timing of your IAD, you can either get a same-side jM, or a crossup jM off of the back of the hitbox. Midscreen only.\n\nVideo Example.\n\nMicrodash Autocombo 50/50\n\nMicrodash forward, then press 5LL and either hit the second hit, or purposefully whiff it and press L again for a throw. Loses to reversals and can be unreliable, but good to know either way. Works midscreen, but requires a deeper dash.\n\nSparking Bait\n\nAirdash M, then immediately backdash and 5H upon landing. If the opponent sparked without reacting to the hit, the 5H should punish them. If 5H is blocked use 214L to be safe on block. Obvious counterplay includes reflecting the 5H, jumping out, or even backdashing. Works anywhere, but the timing is much more strict outside of the corner.\n\nVanish Whiff\n\nUseful for the corner because it lets you steal the corner and enable crossups on wakeup. Mixups off this include:\n\n-Air Backdash jM (Corner Only)\n\n-Air Backdash jH\n\n-Crossup IAD jM / jH\n\n-Same-side / Crossup IAD j.214H\n\n\"The Forbidden Mix\"\n\n236M has a property which allows it to always steal the corner, no matter what. While this usually only makes combos enders whiff, it also allows for a particularly unique and absolutely cursed setup with an assist. To set it up, use an assist to send the opponent into the corner as you whiff 236M to steal it. Since Majin Buu's Level 3 hitbox extends slightly above his head, you are able to hit your opponent with it as they are flying towards the back of his head. This creates many strange situations, like being in the corner after your corner combo, letting you perform the same mixup options that the Vanish Whiff setup offers, without having to use the extra meter.\n\nWhat makes this setup truly cursed is that, as they are landing, you can simply choose to walk out of the corner, giving the opponent the corner back, Adding yet another layer to the mix. Do note that not all characters and assists can perform the setup.\n\nChoosing an Oki Route\n\nBecause Fat Throw is generally set up by spending half a bar, if you are in the corner and don't want to spend your meter on fat, you can use the Fat Throw SKD oki setup and retain a good amount of pressure. Other than that, if you're midscreen it's best to just go for a safejump or reset to neutral.\n\nFat Throw\n\n*Also commonly referred to as 'Gum' or 'Gum Throw'.\n\nFat Throw (214S) is essential to Majin Buu's gameplan, and is what allows Majin Buu to create terrifying Restand mixup situations. On hit, the projectile will trap the opponent in a cocoon of fat, leaving them locked down as they fall to the ground. The cocoon explodes after either some time passes or after you hit them with any attack, the former of which will let them tech nearly instantly once they are free. You are able to combo into Fat Throw off of any touch by using an assist after (j.)236L/M and manually using 214S, or most commonly by using j.[S] > j.236H in the air. If you hit the enemy with an attack that would normally leave them standing on hit (5L, 5LL, 5M, jM, etc.), They will be reset standing (otherwise known as a Restand), becoming actionable as soon as they are hit. This works similarly to Nappa's Restand mix with his Saibamen, instead trading Nappa's overall consistency for more creativity and freeform setups.\n\nWhile this sounds disadvantageous at first, Majin Buu's Restands really shine once he uses an assist, forcing the opponent to hold a mix without having to worry about things like delay tech timings. For example, by using an assist (eg. Yamcha A), Majin Buu can reset the opponent using rising jM while calling Yamcha out to force a 50/50 High/Low in the corner. Alternatively, since Yamcha A is also a Restand Assist, you can simply call it out and it will both reset them and keep them locked down, leaving you completely free to do whatever you want.\n\nStrong Fat Throw set ups can be hard to perform consistently, as they often require precise timing, can vary depending on your team, and can be reflected or even mashed on if the opponent is aware, but the reward they give in return for the time commitment is more than worth it, turning Buu into a reset train, oppressing the opponent with multiple ways to break their guard.\n\nSetups w/ Restand Assists\n\nSetups w/ Other Assists\n\nSolo Restands\n\nBy intentionally ending combos early to manage Hitstun Decay, Majin Buu can use H Dive Bomb set up 50/50s from anywhere on screen. By using 5LL to reset the opponent, you can immediately cancel into 2M, as it can hit during prejump frames and beat mashing, or you can cancel into delay 5LLL for a tick throw setup, which beats reflect and punishes players too scared to act.\n\nOki Options\n\nIf you land 214S, but you can't do a Restand setup for whatever reason, you can choose to end your combo with by timing a meaty j.DR as they naturally break out of Fat Throw, or by doing DR > 214S in the corner for meaty Gum oki.\n\nVideo Examples\n\nShadowsavant0's Okizeme guide\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsovKKKEo-U&t=797s\n\nShadowsavant0's Fat Throw guide\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrdgXbUc8e4\n\nTips and Tricks\n\nIn neutral, it's important to remember the spacing on his normals. With an IAD, j.H can overhead a grounded opponent from fullscreen. Sometimes you can just run and jump forward with it and catch people off guard as it's just a huge, high blockstun hitbox that can interrupt most character's other aerials. At about center stage, a j.2H will catch anyone that tries to jump, and if they didn't block it you can just superdash into a combo. Post snapback midscreen, you can j.2H and when or if they block, superdash and call assist. Then you can either IAD j.M or fall and 2M. His 5H can hit from roundstart as well as his ki blasts. If you're looking to open someone up but they won't approach you can surprise them with a quick 236H from fullscreen. It's hard to react to, but can be 2H'd. Throwing out fat throw at a bad time will leave you open for 31 frames but once the move actually comes out you're completely safe. Anyone who tries to superdash will be caught and you can combo them after.\n\nFighting Majin Buu\n\nThe name of the game when playing against Majin Buu is awareness. At nearly any point, a Majin can surprise you with an IAD j.H, Fat Throw or a random 236H. Buu likes you at a midscreen range so either get up close and corner him as much as possible or just refuse to approach. Try and snap in his teammates to save him for last, since a solo Majin Buu is near suicide. A smart Buu player might still give you a hard time anyway, but without assists he's not nearly as deadly.\n\nNavigation"
