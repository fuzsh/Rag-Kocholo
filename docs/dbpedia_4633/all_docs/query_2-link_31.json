        "text": "Akira Toriyama’s designs are very recognizable in the manga world, with a very personal style that he applies to all kinds of works, from his own stories like ‘Dragon Ball’ or ‘Dr. Slump’ to video games, movies, and more. And it is in ‘Dragon Ball’ that he has and will continue to use his creativity in terms of drawing and ideas. And so it was with Majin Buu, one of the most charismatic villains of ‘Dragon Ball Z’, who turned out to be much more powerful than expected. Now we have the original sketches of Majin Buu by the famous Mangaka, and they are very curious!\n\nThese were Toriyama’s first ideas for Majin Buu\n\nMajin Buu is one of the villains with more personality in the ‘Dragon Ball’ universe, both for his appearance and for his different versions and states, giving rise to a wide variety of designs according to the warriors that managed to absorb him in full battle. And thanks to Toriyama’s first sketches of this character, we understand where the author wanted to go in terms of design.\n\nFor example, publisher Shueisha shared Akira Toriyama’s work on Majin Buu in the 30th Anniversary of Dragon Ball: Super History Book some time ago, suggesting a number of variations for his appearance, though mostly keeping the chubby appearance of his original state.\n\nWe can even see what the pink demonic monster would look like without clothes, which is quite strange. What seemed to be very well-defined was his face - except for the doubt about his nose - although we can’t say the same about his outfit, of which Toriyama came up with numerous versions. He even came up with a super-muscular version of Majin Buu."
