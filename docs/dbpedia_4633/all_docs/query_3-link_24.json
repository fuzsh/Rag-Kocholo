        "text": "Common themes: Action, Adventure, Friendship, Coming of Age\n\nShonen manga often feature lots of action and comedy, and some sort of coming-of-age camaraderie between characters. The manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump and its American counterpart, Shonen Jump, have routinely published some of the most popular shonen manga series of the last 30 years including Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball, Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto, and Shonen Jump's most recent mega-hit, Kohei Horikoshi's My Hero Academia.\n\nTheir English-language imprints will usually bear the Shonen Jump logo. Covers for shonen series usually feature male protagonists in some sort of action pose.\n\nExamples of shonen manga (click on any cover for the NYPL catalog link)\n\nCommon Themes: Romance, Drama, Coming of Age\n\nThe focus here is less on action and more on drama, emotion, and, almost always, idealized romance. Like shonen manga, shojo manga usually feature the coming-of-age story of a young protagonist. You can usually identify shojo covers by their use of pretty pinks, flowers, or other cutesy images.\n\nThis is not to say that shojo manga consists only of cute, fun stories. Their narratives vary as much as any other genre. For instance, Ai Yazawa's Nana is technically classified as a shojo series because it was published in a shojo magazine, although the story follows two young women as they navigate their way through personal relationships, sexual relationships, and drug use on their way to fulfill their dreams. This is completely different from, say, CLAMP's Cardcaptor Sakura, which follows a ten-year-old girl with magical powers who has to save her city from monsters.\n\nNaoko Takeuchi's Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon, a.k.a. Sailor Moon,is probably the most famous example of a shojo series. It follows Usagi Tsukino, a normal 14-year-old girl who finds out she is the reincarnated form of the legendary Sailor Moon, a defender of love and justice from the now-destroyed Moon Kingdom. With her fellow Sailor Senshi (Sailor Scouts), she must defend the Earth from the forces of evil in the name of the Moon.\n\nExamples of shojo manga (click on any cover for the NYPL catalog link)\n\nCommon themes: Action, Violence, Sex, Adult themes\n\nJust like shonen manga, seinen manga features action and violence, but with a more serious or darker tone, as well as adult content such as sexual situations, graphic violence, or foul language. If a series does not fit into any other category such as Shonen or Shojo, then it will be put under seinen.\n\nWhereas shonen series often feature characters with an idealized, naive, or innocent view of the world, seinen series usually follow protagonists who must face a reality where the hero does not always save the day. Seinen covers are often dark and gritty, and feature male protagonists.\n\nKatsuhiro Otomo's Akira is probably one of the most recognizable seinen thanks in part to its epic anime adaptation that paved the way for Japanese animation's popularity in the west. Kentarō Miura's Berserk has been in publication since its debut in 1989. Whereas Akira is set in a post-apocalyptic future, Berserk takes place in a high fantasy world based loosely on European mythology, illustrating the wide variety of genre manga available.\n\nExamples of seinen manga (click on any cover for the NYPL catalog link)\n\nCommon themes: Romance, Sex, Drama\n\nJosei manga often features more mature narratives exploring romantic and personal relationships, told in greater depth than their shojo counterparts—but this is not always true. For the most part, josei manga are similar to American adult romance novels in that they include sexually explicit scenes that can range from tame to borderline pornographic.\n\nUnlike shojo manga, which almost always follows a female protagonist, josei manga often feature male and female protagonists. Female protagonists are almost always pursuing heterosexual relationships, while the male protagonists are, more often than not, involved in homoerotic or homosexual relationships—again, this is often, but not always, the case. Also, unlike shonen, shojo, or seinen manga, josei manga cannot always be quickly identified solely from its cover.\n\nYun Kouga's Loveless is probably one of the most well-known josei manga series. It follows 12-year-old Ritsuka, a character who must rely on a mysterious and older man named Soubi to find answers regarding his older brother's mysterious and brutal murder.\n\nExamples of josei manga (click on any cover for the NYPL catalog link)"
