        "text": "50. Soo-Won (Yona of the Dawn)\n\nSoo-Won is the king of the Kouka Kingdom. He avenges his father’s death, the General Yu-Hon by killing his uncle, Emperor II, who took his father down. He is tall, young, and has a really pretty face. His feminine appearance and his long dark blonder hair shouldn’t be taken lightly; he is fierce as a king and fills his roll properly.\n\nHe always wears the same hairstyle, middle parted bangs with loose strands framing his face. He keeps his long ponytail tied to the side with a delicate gold ornament.\n\nSoo-Won is a beautiful character, his blue eyes, height and delicate features are so dreamy, and who doesn’t love a king?\n\n49. Haku (Naruto)\n\nHaku is an orphan from the Land of Water. Under Zabuza Momochi’s tutelage, he becomes a shinobi, and then moves on to become a Mercenary Ninja.\n\nNaruto himself even called Haku beautiful. His shinobi outfit is trimmed in white with a brown sash and green haori. When not in combat, Haku wore his dark black hair loose down to his shoulders. This framed his beautiful, even delicate, features. When fighting his hair was tied back in a bun and his headband held back the loose bits.\n\nHe is fierce and accomplished, all for such a young, handsome character.\n\n48. Alucard (Hellsing Ultimate)\n\nAlucard is the most powerful weapon against vampires and other supernatural forces in the Hellsing Organization. He is the most powerful vampire alive, and who doesn’t love all that power.\n\nHe is a bad boy, for those who love the supernatural. His blood red eyes glow when he feels strong emotions and his hair length changes from short to long down to the knees. His charcoal suit and red cravat, covered by the red overcoat give him that sophistication only a super powerful vampire can have.\n\nHe is fierce, sometimes vicious and merciless, but now and then his humanity shines through, and that is what keeps us loving him!\n\n47. Levi (Attack on Titan)\n\nSquad captain of the Special Operations Squad, Levi Ackerman’s deceptively youthful face is framed by short, undercut hair and dull gray eyes that intimidate whoever they look upon, dark circles intensifying his looks further.\n\nHe is shorter than most, but his well-developed and muscular physique makes up for his height-shortfall. His brooding demeanour is quickly replaced with an expressionless look, and he is always calm and keeps his feelings hidden.\n\nHe offers up a great physique and a mysterious aura, something none of us can resist. Also he is considered the strongest soldier in Attack on Titan.\n\n46. Kakashi (Naruto)\n\nKakashi Hatake, despite his distaste for responsibility, is often sought after for his wisdom and leadership. His self-confidence and sometimes arrogance makes him all that more appealing.\n\nSpiky silver hair worn to the left frames his beautiful face when he isn’t wearing a mask. He has dark grey eyes, sometimes even appearing black, and a relaxed disposition. An injury left a vertical scar running down over his left eye, and it just adds to his badass attitude. During battle, he wears a forehead protector and mouth mask, keeps his face hidden. But when the masks come off, we are in for a treat!\n\n45. Sebastian (Black Butler)\n\nWho can resist a tall, dark and handsome man? Sebastian stands tall, has black hair, red eyes and pale skin. Often dressed as a butler, he wears black trousers, a double-breasted waist-coat and a grey vest. While this is a typical butler’s outfit, it makes him look oh so sophisticated. His white gloves, pocket watch and chained silver lapel add to this look and make him that much more attractive.\n\nFor a bit of an alternative look, he has black nail polish on his finger nails. His left hand bears that mark of his Faustian contract with Ciel Phantomhive.\n\n44. Rin Okumura (Blue Exorcist)\n\nBlack, messy hair sweeps down and falls on Rin’s beautifully pale skin. Rin isn’t your ordinary man however; there are hints of his demonic form that shine through his human appearance. Canine teeth and slightly pointed ears are less noticeable; the big giveaway is his long, black, fur tail.\n\nIn demon form he possesses two blue horn-like flames above his head, long ears and red slit pupils. Flames blaze around different areas of his body. From slightly demon to full on demonic form, Rin is for those who like something a little edgy. You can pick and choose between human and demon with Rin, a two for one deal.\n\n43. Yuri Katsuki (Yuri on Ice)\n\nYuri is not your dark, brooding Anime character. He is an ice figure skater, and a down-to-earth looking guy.\n\nHe has short, messy black hair and wears half-rimmed blue glasses. His hair is pushed back when skating, and his glasses are removed.\n\nRin puts on weight easily due to binge eating and often wears multiple layers to hide the weight gain. However; when he in full training, he has a sleek muscular body that is lovely to look at, paired with his soft, kind face.\n\nHe is a safe bet, and a good Anime character to start crushing on.\n\n42. Seiryuu Abi (Yona of the Dawn)\n\nThe first bearer of the Seiryuu’s power, Abi is one of the four dragon warriors, sworn to protect King Hiryuu.\n\nDespite his fierce title, Abi has a rather feminine look. Medium length blue hair with bangs falling to each side, frames his beautifully delicate face. His kimono-type attire is drawn at the waist with a pearl necklace. Being the first Seiryuu, he has deep golden eyes that are adorned with red signature marks below them.\n\nHis beautiful appearance however doesn’t cover up his foul-mouth and bad temper. He plays these traits down with a sensitivity and sense of quiet that only few get to see, and a fierce loyalty for his friends.\n\n41. Takashi Komuro (Highschool of the Dead)\n\nA second-year in high school and the leader of the Fujimi Academy of survivors, Takashi is confident and accomplished.\n\nTakashi is skilled in melee combat and is tutored to be extremely proficient in firearm skills.\n\nHe is averagely heighted and has brown eyes framed by spikey black hair. He is slender yet powerful, and he relies on his agility and muscular ability to see him through tough times. He typically wears his school uniform which consists of a black school uniform and a red undershirt. He may change to casual clothes here and there, but his school attire is primarily what he wears.\n\n40. William T. Spears (Black Butler)\n\nClean and neat, William is tall and well groomed. He has neatly combed brown hair and eyes that have a yellow-green hue. His rectangular shaped glasses have decorative lines on the frames and give him the look of sophistication and calmness.\n\nHe is calm, seemingly emotionless and incredibly loyal in his professional life. He sticks to the rules and doesn’t take kindly to those who do not.\n\nNot a fan of demons, he is often derogatory towards others. This is quite off-putting when it comes to the character, but it doesn’t mean we can’t appreciate his looks!\n\n39. Toga Yagari (Vampire Knight)\n\nToga Yagari is the top rated vampire hunter and is an excellent teacher as well. He is also the co-president of the Vampire Hunter Association – nice and accomplished!\n\nYagari wears an eye patch over his right eye, which he lost while saving Zero and Ichiru from his fiancé after she transformed into a vampire. He has a scar that is visible near his eye as well. He has long, jet-black wavy hair and blue eyes. He often wears a wide brimmed cowboy hat and a cigarette hanging from his mouth.\n\nHe is very tall and has an attractively muscular build.\n\n37. Kyo Sohma (Fruits Basket)\n\nKyo is cursed by the spirit of the cat of the zodiac. When he is under stress and being hugged by someone of the opposite gender, he transforms into an orange cat.\n\nHe has bright orange hair that hangs down over his eyes, which are a red and orange color. He is tall and muscular, breaking the stereotype of other orange haired people.\n\nThe bracelet on his wrist needs to stay on, if it is taken off, he turns into a monster that smells of rotting flesh. This is supposedly the cat’s vengeful spirit. His different coloring makes him interesting, and he is also just very attractive.\n\n36.
