        "text": "Toyble simply wanted to give Majin Buu a big part in this new story (which is nice, nothing bad with that) but it came at the expense of yet another unnecessary retcon. And one that is so poorly thought out it contradicts itself.\n\nFirst off, we find out that Dai Kaioshin used to be a lot stronger 10 million years prior, but he exhausted almost all of his godly power by sealing off Moro's magic, rendering him pathetically weak ever since that encounter.\n\n5 million years later Dai Kaioshin was so weak that he couldn‚Äôt take care of Kid Buu and ended up getting absorbed during his rampage in the Kaioshin world.\n\nAlmost a decade earlier, after Majin Buu is unleashed from his seal and eventually separates into his good and bad halves, we learn that Kid Buu took the most of what was left of the lingering god power gained from Dai Kaioshin. Thus, Good Buu inherited just a small bit of the already small amount of God ki that was left from Dai Kaioshin.\n\nYet, now in the current arc we see that Buu reawakening Dai Kaioshin's essence gave him a boost so large that it shot him up close to post-ToP SSB levels.\n\nAnd that was enough to not only brush off Moro's magic, but also give him the Loki treatment casually.\n\nLater, Moro regains his full magical power (from 10 million years prior) and completely turns the tables on the newly empowered Buu now that he's stronger.\n\nHowever, even this Moro (who is now on par with his prime self from 10 million years prior) is said to still be weaker than the SSBs aside from his magic shenanigans.\n\nSo what happened here?\n\n1. Prime Moro is weaker than an individual SSB power wise.\n\n2. After Dai Kaioshin exhausted almost all of his Godly power to seal away Moro's magic he was left very weak.\n\n3. So weak that he couldn‚Äôt even defeat Kid Buu\n\n4. That same weakened Dai Kaioshin later had most of his remaining power transfer over to Kid Buu.\n\n5. But the measly amount that was left in Good Buu is enough to skyrocket him close to SSB tiers of power?\n\nThis doesn't add up and it goes to show what happens when you try to mess with pre-established canon in order to shoehorn in a poorly thought up retcon in an attempt to justify a character's sudden power growth.\n\nMajin buu got a major power boost thanks to daikaioshin\n\nIt's like fat buu got his potential unlocked. I doubt fat buu without daikaioshin would be this strong. It's like they have fused and fusion is usually over powered.\n\nThis still makes more sense than frieza going from weaker than ssj to ssb level just by doing push ups\n\nGood Buu by himself is weaker than Buu Saga SSJ3. The gap between that and post-ToP SSB tier is absolutely crazy.\n\nPrime Moro himself is weaker than a post-ToP SSB.\n\nDai Kaioshin used 99% of his power to seal Prime Moro.\n\nFrom the 1% left, 0.9% went to Kid Buu while 0,1% went to Good Buu.\n\nSo how does Good Buu using the 0,1% left from Dai Kaioshin shoot up to post-ToP SSB tier?\n\nThat version of Moro wasnt very strong fighter wise and what made him dangerous was his magic which Buu was able to cancel out therefore it came down to just a battle of strength in which case Buu was stronger.\n\nI think, it doesn't really add up.\n\nThis that version of moro was weak as shit. It's around the time where a single ssblue could just fuck him up, the only thing he had for him was his magic and majin buu was immune to it. So he was fucked\n\nI never took it as buu was blue level.\n\nRemember that vegeta ssblue evolved literally One Shotted that version of moro.\n\nIf you read the fight vegeta turns evolved dodge all of moro's shit and actually one shot him. He wasnt that strong\n\nMajin buu became stronger by getting his potential awakened when he awakened the dai kaioshin. But its heavily implied the technique was never going to work because kid buu has all the god powers.\n\nI wonder what would happen if he awakened it\n\nGuess we will find out with uub\n\nHonestly DB suffers when you add unnecessary details. One of the reasons my favorite sagas, like Piccolo and Cell sagas, worked is because we see a very straightforward narrative wherein a bad guy shows up and upsets the status quo, the heroes do something easily understandable to become stronger, then the heroes prevail after a few back-and-forths and upsets. There's generally one final power boost near the end that pays off on the previous training or magic talisman/holy water consumption/whatever. That's the important part. The big reveal builds on something pre-established. Gohan goes SSJ2 after training to break the limits of SSJ. We're told all through the saga about a level beyond SSJ and we finally get to see it. It builds off the simple narrative of the Androids arc. He wasn't suddenly half Genie and therefore strong. Toyo could learn from this. He must learn from this if he's to be the successor, or this series is doomed.\n\nI think the problems are \"most\" of the daikaioshin's power being in kid buu, which seems to be a \"guess\" from Merus, though.\n\nThat can be easily fixed by saying each buu got arround half the daikaioshin's power.\n\nAlso, I think Buu's first fight with Moro wouldn't actually make him SSJB level. Goku and Vegeta seemed to have a clear advantage compared to the daikaioshin. Full Magic Moro was fighting him easily, but avoided a direct confrontation with the fully powered saiyans.\n\nSo I think that current Buu would be arround Ssj god level, but with his regen hax and immunity to Moro's magic, he was able to gain an advantage in that first fight.\n\nThe advantage of this idea is that it makes the kaioshin more powerful, so that we don't have such colossal difference between the kaioshin and the hakaishin. One of the reasons I want to see Beerus on earth is to interact with the daikaioshin (and with the elder kaioshin and shin). The kaioshin lore needs a better explanation.\n\nI think the problems are \"most\" of the daikaioshin's power being in kid buu, which seems to be a \"guess\" from Merus, though.\n\nThat can be easily fixed by saying each buu got arround half the daikaioshin's power.\n\nAlso, I think Buu's first fight with Moro wouldn't actually make him SSJB level.

Stop trying to defend bullshit."
