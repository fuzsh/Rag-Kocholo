        "text": "Watching the Dragon Ball anime series with all the movies and specials in chronological order can be tedious work! With a whopping 24 movies/specials on top of over 600 episodes in total, there is a lot of content to digest here. While most specials and movies are not considered canon nor is the entirety of GT, I am going to be including them in this list for the sake of watching as much Dragon Ball content as possible. Because the movies and specials aren’t part of the “true timeline” the stories won’t fit perfectly but according to ability and power-scaling, they will make sense. So if you are interested in watching everything in order, you have come to the right place!\n\nDragon Ball Episodes 1 - 43\n\nSon Goku, a fighter with a monkey tail, goes on a quest with an assortment of odd characters in search of the Dragon Balls, a set of crystals that can give its bearer anything they desire.\n\nMOVIE: Curse of the Blood Rubies\n\nEvil has spread throughout Gurumes’s kingdom, who is desperate to collect all the dragon balls. He sends out his men after Goku, when he learns that he owns one.\n\nDragon Ball Episodes 44 - 70\n\nSon Goku, a fighter with a monkey tail, goes on a quest with an assortment of odd characters in search of the Dragon Balls, a set of crystals that can give its bearer anything they desire.\n\nMOVIE: Sleeping Princess in Devil’s Castle\n\nGoku and Krillin want to be trained in the martial arts by the great Master Roshi. The only way he will agree to train them is if they go to Devil’s Castle to find the Sleeping Princess, who is being held prisoner by Count Lucifer, and bring her back to his island.\n\nDragon Ball Episodes 71 – 118\n\nSon Goku, a fighter with a monkey tail, goes on a quest with an assortment of odd characters in search of the Dragon Balls, a set of crystals that can give its bearer anything they desire.\n\nMOVIE: Mystical Adventure\n\nEmperor Chiaotzu’s wife has gone missing, and he is told by Master Shen that if he collects the seven dragon balls he can call upon the eternal dragon and wish for her return. Meanwhile, Goku and Krillin attend the World Martial Arts Tournament, which is hosted by the Emperor; Bora and his son Upa attempt to hide the dragon ball they found from the emperor’s forces, which are under the control of the evil Shen and General Tao; and Bulma conducts her own search for the dragon balls with the help of Yamcha, Puar, and Oolong.\n\nDragon Ball Episodes 119 – 153\n\nSon Goku, a fighter with a monkey tail, goes on a quest with an assortment of odd characters in search of the Dragon Balls, a set of crystals that can give its bearer anything they desire.\n\nMOVIE: Dead Zone\n\nGohan is kidnapped!

While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku through childhood into adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adulthood life, but at the same time parallels the maturation of his son, Gohan, as well as other characters from Dragon Ball and more. The separation between the series is also significant as the latter series takes on a more dramatic and serious tone. The anime also features characters, situations and back-stories not present in the original manga.\n\nMOVIE: The World’s Strongest\n\nDr Kochin resurrects Dr Wheelo who was presumed dead after an avalanche.

Instead, he was thrown back in time, to an age where the planet was still inhabited by strange creatures. There he met Freeza’s ancestor, the space pirate Chilled, and fought against him to protect the planet.\n\nDragon Ball Z Episodes 107 – 139\n\nDragon Ball Z follows the adventures of the adult Goku who, along with his companions, defends the earth against an assortment of villains ranging from intergalactic space fighters and conquerors, unnaturally powerful androids and near indestructible magical creatures.
