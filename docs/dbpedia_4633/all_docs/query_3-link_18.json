        "text": "Have you already noticed the different types of boys there are in so many animes?\n\nEven though every guy is different, you can still see the similarities between the characters in anime — let’s list some of them here:\n\n1. The Baby-Boy\n\nWe all know these anime boys, who are 17, but look like 12 — small with big eyes and a high voice. They look super cute, but it’s hard to distinguish them with the actual 12-year-olds xD\n\n2. The Motivator\n\nNatsu Dragneel, Naruto Uzumaki etc. etc. — those are the types who are always super motivated and never break a promise; they never ever give up no matter what they do. Not only do they motivate the other characters in the anime, but they also have a huge impact on us.\n\n3. The Loner\n\nThe ones, who aren’t that socially active and would rather spend the whole day thinking about God and the world than going to school and socializing with others — I call those the loners. They always look so cheerless, so sad and unhappy. But for some reason I find their way of thinking often pretty entertaining, especially when they hang out with the motivators or other loud characters.\n\n4. The Pervert\n\nAh yes, the perverts — we’ve all seen them in at least one anime. They can be very amusing for the majority of the audience, but I’m not one of these people who likes this type.\n\n5. The NEET\n\nAs you might already know, NEET stands for Not in Education, Employment or Training.\n\nSo, there’s not much more to say about this type, except that they are often the ultimate gamers or at least spend a lot of time in front of their computer.\n\nOf course those weren’t all the types of guys we know, there are many more — that’s why I want YOU to write down what other types you can think of in the comment section, so we can do a second part! (Click here for the second part!)\n\nDid you like this post? Let us know by visiting UNOTAKU!\n\nDaze ya later guys! ;D"
