        "text": "In the vast world of anime, it can certainly be hard to pick your favorite. It doesn’t help that there are so many new anime series to check out and so many old ones to catch up on, too. If you’re having a hard time choosing, then why not start by looking through this list of famous anime characters?\n\nFamous anime characters can vary in looks, personality, and age. One thing they have in common, however, is they appeal to many people in their own unique ways. Fan-favorites like Naruto, Ash Ketchum, and Kurapika have all earned the hearts of people from all over the world. Keep on reading to learn more about these famous anime characters and why they are so well-loved!\n\nWhat is anime?\n\nBefore anything else, it’s important to first define anime. The term, “anime”, comes from the word, “animation”. It refers to animated works from Japan. This includes traditional animations from hand-drawn images or computer animations from digital images.\n\nAnime differs from other types of animation by showcasing Japanese characters and culture. Furthermore, most animes are adaptations of famous mangas, which refer to Japanese comic books.\n\nYou’ll notice that anime also has distinct characteristics that set them apart from the animation of other countries. For instance, anime characters often have exaggerated features and proportions, such as gigantic eyes and unique hairstyles.\n\nOf course, anime shows still differ among themselves. This is because there are over 430 production companies in Japan, and many of them have their own style. One popular example is Studio Ghibli, which is also known internationally.\n\nWhat is the history of anime?\n\nThe anime industry didn’t start off with big companies like Studio Ghibli. In fact, anime had a rough start. With how successful anime is today, it’s only natural to think that anime already has a long history. However, anime is a relatively new art form since the first Japanese animations can be traced back to 1917.\n\nAnimators Ōten Shimokawa, Seitarō Kitayama, and Jun’ichi Kōuchi are filmmakers known to be the “Fathers of Anime.” They paved the way for Japanese animation to develop in the 1930s.\n\nAt the time, Japan’s animation industry faced great competition, such as Disney. It wasn’t until the 1960s that anime finally had a breakthrough. Osamu Tezuka was a manga artist and animator who produced some of the first successful anime series. One example is Astro Boy, which premiered in 1963.\n\nLater on, many of Tezuka’s animators established their own anime studios. This led to Japan’s animation industry flourishing. Japanese industries have continued to distribute anime through local and international television broadcasts. For international broadcasts, they added subtitles or used dubbing in the country’s language.\n\nToday, anime takes up over 60% of the animated television series in the world.\n\nWhy is anime so popular?\n\nFor starters, anime has a lot of loyal fans. Many of those who watched anime during their childhood or teenage years are still tuned into the many anime offerings today. A lot of anime series from years ago is still ongoing and remain popular as ever.\n\nWhile maintaining a loyal fanbase, many anime series also gather new fans. Netflix and other streaming sites have a wide selection of anime series, so new audiences can easily choose one and watch all the episodes.\n\nFurthermore, anime series often appeal to multiple age groups, so their reach and market are much bigger than other shows. Anime also has plenty of genres. There are shows for sports fans like Haikyu!! and shows for mystery fans like Detective Conan.\n\nAnother reason ‌anime is so popular is that they feature relatable characters. Animes often have a clumsy yet likable protagonist, and this makes audiences root for them to succeed. If audiences do not relate to the protagonist, there are other characters in the show that will appeal to them.\n\nWho are the most famous anime characters?\n\nAsh Ketchum\n\nFirst Appearance: 1997\n\nAnime: Pokémon\n\nOther appearances: Pokémon Puzzle League, Pokémon: Catch the Numbers!, and Pokémon Team Rocket Blast Off\n\nIf you’re familiar with the Pokémon franchise, then you’ve probably heard of Ash Ketchum. Pokémon is one of the most successful franchises in the world, so it only makes sense that its protagonist is on this list.\n\nAsh Ketchum is a 10-year-old boy who has Pikachu as his Pokémon companion. In the series, he catches and trains other Pokémon, with the dream to become the world’s greatest “Pokémon Master”. He tries to achieve this by competing in different leagues.\n\nLike most famous male anime characters, Ash has a distinct look. He wears a red snapback with a unique logo. His cap that tucks his spiky black hair helps fans immediately identify him.\n\nAstro Boy\n\nFirst Appearance: 1952\n\nAnime: Astro Boy\n\nOther appearances: The Original Astro Boy\n\nAside from being one of the most famous anime characters ever, Astro Boy is also the oldest anime character.

The manga’s original name in Japan is Mighty Atom, and the character is called Atom instead of Astro Boy.\n\nIn 1963, the Astro Boy TV series premiered and paved the way for what fans now know as the anime aesthetic. During its run, the show was incredibly successful, and around 40% of Japanese audiences watched the show.\n\nAs the show’s title suggests, Astro Boy is the main character of the Astro Boy franchise.

His most distinct features, however, are his prosthetic limbs. Advanced automail replaced his lost arm and leg, and this earned him the nickname “Fullmetal Alchemist.” As the titular character of the series, the story follows Edward and his brother, Alphonse, who also lost his whole body in the same ritual that took Edward’s limbs.

While his outfit might look funny to some, Hisoka is a skilled and powerful opponent.\n\nFrom the beginning, Hisoka is described as an eccentric serial killer who uses magic tricks to exact violence on his opponents. For him, there is no greater pleasure than battling strong opponents, to the point that he often feels sexually aroused by them. At times, Hisoka also lends a helping hand to the protagonist, Gon.

This includes enhanced speed, strength, and spiritual power.\n\nEven before becoming a Soul Reaper, however, Ichigo is already a trained martial artist. He is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, which comes in handy as he protects civilians from evil spirits and assists good spirits to the Soul Society.\n\nIchigo consistently ranks as the most popular character of the franchise.

They have a cat-and-mouse cerebral chase throughout the show, keeping viewers on their toes every episode.\n\nAt first glance, L won’t look like an esteemed detective. He wears a plain long-sleeved, white shirt and blue pants, and he often goes barefoot. However, L is highly intelligent and analytic and is also a skilled fighter.\n\nLelouch Lamperouge\n\nFirst Appearance: 2006\n\nAnime: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion\n\nOther appearances: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Re;surrection, Code Geass: Lost Colors, Another Century’s Episode: R, and Super Robot Wars\n\nLelouch vi Britannia, better known as his alias Lelouch Lamperouge, is the protagonist of the Code Geass franchise.
