        "text": "How does Demon Slayer and the MBTIÂ® intersect? Ever wondered which Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba character has your personality type? Today weâre going to dig into some of the most memorable characters from the Manga and anime series in order to figure out which personality types are represented.\n\nNot sure what your personality type is? Take our new personality questionnaire here. Or you can take the official MBTIÂ® here.\n\nEstimated reading time: 18 minutes\n\nWhat is Demon Slayer?\n\nDemon Slayer is an anime and manga series that is set in early 20th century Taisho-era Japan. In this world, man-eating demons roam the land each night, devouring innocent people in order to become stronger and more powerful. One cold winter morning, 13-year-old Tanjiro Kamado returns home to find his entire family murdered except for his sister Nezuko, who has turned into a demon. Tanjiro is determined to do whatever it takes to turn Nezuko back into a human and avenge the deaths of his family. In order to do this, he sets out on a journey to train for the Demon Slayer Corps and join other skilled fighters to protect humans from demons.\n\nDisclaimer: As much as I would like to, I canât really sit across from Tanjiro and perform an MBTIÂ® consultation and type clarification session. When typing fictional characters, thereâs limited information to go on based on whatâs shown in the series or mangas. I try to be as accurate as possible with my typings, but if you have alternate suggestions be sure to let me know in the comments!\n\nThe Myers-BriggsÂ® Types of the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Characters\n\nGenya Shinazugawa â ISFP\n\nâThink only about winning. I will not let my brother, or my master, or any of my comrades die.â â Genya Shinazugawa\n\nMany people type Genya as an ESTJ, but I believe this is due to not reading the mangas and only viewing his brief appearance in the first season of Demon Slayer. Genya has a deeply traumatic past that has mentally scarred him and caused him to form a tough outer shell around his psyche. He is, above all, loyal to his cause, anxious to change the world and avenge the deaths of his siblings. While he is a skilled gunfighter, his impulsiveness and fiery emotions often land him in conflicts with other demon slayers. While people may judge him for his brash exterior, his inner soul is much kinder and more wounded than many realize.\n\nJigoro Kuwajima â ESTJ\n\nâItâs alright to cry or go off by yourself. Just donât ever give up. Believe in yourself. You endured all that hellish training. Youâll be rewarded for that without question. Work to forge yourself like a tempered bladeâ¦and become the most resilient of all! Focus on what you do best!â â Jigoro Kuwajima\n\nStrict but devoted, Jigoro Kuwajima is the tough-love teacher that shows Zenitsu what heâs capable of. Like most ESTJs, Kuwajima believes that skills are learned through repetition and determination; fighting through the pain and discomfort to become masterful. Kuwajimaâs tough personality yet simultaneous devotion and loyalty are often hallmarks of the ESTJ personality type. Heâs practical, focused, and commanding â pushing his students hard, but caring for them deeply at the same time.\n\nSusamaru â ESTP\n\nâHow should we kill them, I wonder? Vindictively, of course!â â Susamaru\n\nI canât type too many of the demons because their personality characteristics are too shrouded by their demonic nature. That said, Susamaru is more than just a bloodthirsty demon. Both before and after her transition to demon, she was thrilled by excitement, action, and fun. She thirsts for a challenge, and even before becoming a demon was a skilled handball player. Beneath her vicious demon exterior is a young girl who simply wants to have fun and test her abilities. ESTPs, as Se-dominant types, are drawn to challenges, immersion with the environment, and physical activity that lets them respond to surprise incoming stimuli (like a punch being suddenly thrown out of nowhere). ESTPs also have tertiary Extraverted Feeling which enables them to have a certain charm and charisma, an ability to âreadâ people and sense where theyâre at emotionally. Susamaru seems to have all these qualities, even though sheâs a demon.\n\nSakonji Urokodaki â ISTJ\n\nâThis kid isnât going to cut it. Heâs too kind and canât make decisions. Heâs facing a demon, yet the scent of kindness remains. He has empathy even for a demon. Heâs never going to make it.â â Sakonji Urokodaki\n\nUrokodaki might seem stern and demanding on the outside, but on the inside heâs deeply caring and devoted. He knows that to train demon slayers he must test their limits and challenge them beyond their comfort zones. He gives no shortcuts to his students but he knows that this is essential in order for them to survive and make a difference in the world. His serious, logical demeanor and practical way of looking at life are characteristics that make ISTJs stand out.\n\nSabito â ISTJ\n\nâGo further! If youâre a man. If you call yourself a man! Thereâs no way to go but forward!â â Sabito\n\nFocused and determined, Sabito does whatever it takes to help Tanjiro hone his strengths as a demon slayer. Like his mentor Urokodaki, Sabito knows that tough love is often the way to lift people to their highest potential. While he might seem harsh and demeaning at the beginning of the series, when his mask is removed, his gentle smile reveals a softer, more sensitive side. In the manga you can see that he gave up his own life in order to save the other students from the hand demon. In what is common for ISTJs, Sabito doesnât exude emotion, but his values nonetheless guide him.\n\nMakomo â INFP\n\nâThere are other children besides us. Theyâre always watching you, Tanjiro.â â Makomo\n\nGentle and insightful, Makomo teaches Tanjiro how to correct his sword-fighting techniques as a demon slayer. Tanjiro quickly notices that Makomo tends to speak in an abstract and dreamy way, something INFPs are known for. Also like INFPs, she tends to be patient and unhurried, contrasting Sabitoâs harsh, more impatient manner of teaching. Makomoâs devoted, empathetic nature and reserved, imaginative way of expressing herself make me think INFP is the right type for her. That said, she is only in the series and the manga briefly, so Iâm having to type based off very limited information.\n\nTamayo â INFJ\n\nâYou still useâ¦the term âpersonââ¦to refer to even a transformed demon. And youâre trying to save him. Allow me, then, to lend you a hand.â â Tamayo\n\nInsightful and empathetic, Tamayo has the predictive capabilities that INFJs are famous for. She foresees very particular events coming to fruition, though I canât say what they are because of spoilers. She knows how to wield her blood demon art to manipulate people into revealing their most tightly-locked secrets. Quiet and intellectual, she yearns to find a way to help humans and demons co-exist and find healing. She even finds an unusual solution to needing blood to survive as a demon; buying blood from consenting donors in order to survive.\n\nYushiro â ISTJ\n\nâLetâs use those two as decoys and escapeâ¦..Iâm just kidding!â â Yushiro\n\nSerious and loyal, Yushiro will do whatever it takes to stay close to Tamayo and help her achieve her goals. He has a knack for taking in his surroundings and responding quickly, using mind control and sight manipulation to enact sneak attacks on his foes. Unfortunately, there isnât a wealth of information on Yushiro in the mangas or the TV series, other than his steadfast love for Tamayo. Because of that, this typing of him is based on very limited information.\n\nShinobu Kocho â INTJ\n\nâI once believed that the road of happiness continued forever and ever into the distance. When it was destroyed, I realized for the first time that it lies upon a thin sheet of glass.â â Shinobu Kocho\n\nShinobu was one of the hardest characters for me to type in this series. On the outside, she appears cheerful and empathic â always wearing a warm smile. But on the inside, sheâs quite ruthless and calculating. As you watch the series (or read the manga especially) you realize that her cheerful exterior is a faÃ§ade that she employs to be more like her sister who was murdered by demons. The real Shinobu is angry, strategic, and unforgiving. Sheâs absolutely driven by her inner vision, thinking big-picture and long-term about ways to dismantle demonic power in the world. She also knows how to put her personal feelings and the feelings of others aside when a tough decision has to be made.\n\nKyojuro Rengoku â ENFJ\n\nâGo ahead and live with your head held high. No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness, set your heart ablaze. Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.â â Kyojuro Rengoku\n\nCharismatic and principled, Kyojuro does whatever he can to live according to his code of ethics. In childhood, his mother instilled the belief in him that the strong should protect the weak. Because of this, he will steel himself against any foe that puts weaker beings in danger. He longs to be acknowledged, to protect, and also to inspire his younger brother to carry on his legacy. To the end, Kyojuro fights to protect others. His valiant, kind-hearted, generous nature are qualities that healthy ENFJs often emulate in daily life.\n\nGiyu Tomioka â ISTJ\n\nâFeel the rage. The powerful, pure rage of not being able to forgive will become your unswerving drive to take action!â â Giyu Tomioka\n\nGiyu is driven by a strong sense of justice and practicality. He thinks quickly on his feet, showing zero hesitation when faced with terrifying, powerful demons. Like most ISTJs, heâs a man of very few words, his feelings coming through in his internal thoughts more than his external expressions. In his first encounter with Tanjiro and Nezuko, he appears insulting and harsh on the outside while his inner words are soft and empathetic. This is something that ISTJs often relate to; their inner worlds are often more emotionally rich and nuanced than their outside expressions reveal. When it comes to his decisions, Tomioka tries to stay practical and logical unless enough physical evidence reveals that he should step outside the rules (as evidenced when Nezuko protects her brother rather than devouring him).\n\nInosuke Hashibira â ESFP\n\nâWeâre comradesâ¦and like brothers. So if someone starts to stray from the path, we all stop him. No matter how hard or painful it is, we walk the right path.â â Inosuke Hashibira\n\nIf I were to look purely at appearances, it would be easy to think that Inosuke is an ESTP. Heâs spontaneous, blunt, and quick to act. That said, when one looks closer at his motivations and convictions (particularly in the mangas) itâs easy to see more Introverted Feeling and Extraverted Thinking than Introverted Thinking and Extraverted Feeling (what youâd find with an ESTP). Inosuke has a fiery personality and, at the beginning of the series, is ready to pick a fight with just about anyone. This is to be expected since he was literally raised in the wild. Rather than the more detached, logical approach of the ESTP, Inosuke acts on his feelings, determined to live up to his internal views of himself as the strongest and best demon slayer of all. Fearless and strong, heâll do anything to prove himself to others â even when it hurts. For Inosuke, the goal is to be recognized for his individual skills and abilities while simultaneously fighting the demons who killed his mother.\n\nGyutaro â ISTP\n\nâWeâre just returning all the pain and suffering people did to us and collecting what they owe us. We have to pay our past misfortunes to those who are fortunate, or we canât break even. Thatâs how we lived our lives. And we killed every single person that had a single problem with that, man.â â Gyutaro\n\nAbused and mistreated, Gyutaroâs childhood is one filled with tragedy and pain. While he later becomes a vicious demon, his motives are to balance the scales of the persecuted and the fortunate. Like most ISTPs, heâs quick to take in his surroundings and decide on the best tactical approaches in battle. Also in typical ISTP fashion, he has an irreverent sense of humor and a detached, analytical perspective (except for when it comes to his sister, Daki). While there isnât an excess of information about Gyutaro in the mangas Iâve read, the closest fit I could theorize for him was ISTP.\n\nNezuko Kamado â ISFJ\n\nâHumans are to be protected and savedâ¦I will never hurt them.â â Nezuko Kamado\n\nGentle and caring, Nezuko has a habit of putting other peopleâs needs before her own. In typical ISFJ fashion, she seems to be practical â not wanting to spend too much money on herself so that her family can be provided for. To be fair, itâs difficult to type Nezuko as she nearly always has bamboo stuck in her mouth so her lines are limited. Iâm going with ISFJ off of very limited information, and mostly from what Tanjiro recalls about her more than her own thoughts and perspectives. That said, just from a surface level, ISFJ seems like a good fit.\n\nZenitsu Agatsuma â ISFP\n\nâDonât ever give up. Even if itâs painful, even if itâs agonizing. Donât try to take the easy way out.â â Zenitsu Agatsuma\n\nPeople seem to love or hate Zenitsu (Iâm firmly in the âloveâ camp) because of his hyper-reactive, sometimes cowardly nature. That said, Zenitsu has a huge amount of empathy and care for others. While he is indeed fearful, it is often because he has felt so alone in life and so undervalued. Even though heâs afraid he continues to fight, holding respect for his comrades and coming to their aid unexpectedly. In an ideal world, Zenitsu would have a loving family and thus feel capable of the inner strength heâs always desired. Yet even in his real life he manages to overcome his fear in the most unexpected moments. His speed, stamina, and endurance are astonishing. Like most Sensing-Perceivers, he has tactical intelligence and an ability to point out obvious solutions that others (even Tanijro) seem to be missing.\n\nTanjiro Kamado â ENFJ\n\nâThose who regretted their own actions. I would never trample over them. Because demons were once human too! Just like me, they were human too!â â Tanjiro Kamado\n\nTanjiroâs personality type stands out because heâs not only a feeling type, heâs also driven and knows how to be confrontational or comforting in order to help others. Selfless and driven, Tanjiro will stop at nothing to defend his sister against those who would harm her. He knows the future looks bleak and every obstacle will be in his path, but he wonât let that stop him from his vision. He believes that the âimpossibleâ can happen â that he will be able to find a cure that will change his sister from a demon into a human again. Tanjiroâs compassion, empathy, and patience with people (and demons) make his Extraverted Feeling side evident. Every decision he makes concerns the greater good and the needs of others. His ability to see past roadblocks and fight for his vision is evidence of his powerful intuition. Heâs even able to understand that demons used to be human and show respect and sorrow for even the most villainous creatures he has slain.\n\nKokushibo â IXTJ\n\nâBe thankful for the bloodâ¦You are not allowed to spill even a single drop on the groundâ¦for if you doâ¦your torso and head shall have a sorrowful parting.â â Kokushibo\n\nIâm inclined to lean towards INTJ for Kokushibo, but like many of the characters in this series, Iâm having to type based off of very limited information. Reserved and serious, Kokushibo is an adamant rule-follower who respects the hierarchy of the Twelve Kizuki. While heâs outwardly reserved, he can also be harshly direct, not sparing othersâ feelings and demanding total obedience. His inner feelings, as with most IxTJs, are often mysterious and deeply hidden. Yet this doesnât mean he doesnât care, as he mourns the death of his brother even when his outer actions might seem to show hatred or jealousy.\n\nKagaya Ubuyashiki â INFJ\n\nâI know what eternity is. Eternity is human feeling. Only human feelings are forever and are undying.â â Kagaya Ubuyashiki\n\nInsightful and devoted, Kagaya emulates some of the very best qualities of the INFJ type. Like most INFJs, he has a unique ability to foresee how events will play out, predicting various events that later come to fruition. He also is incredibly tactful and soothing, being able to put other people at ease almost instantly. Yet even though heâs kind, he naturally receives respect from others due to his dedication, intellect, and reason. He seems to be deeply in touch with his Introverted Intuition, Extraverted Feeling, and Introverted Thinking sides â showcasing what an INFJ can bring to the world when they are balanced and healthy.\n\nWhat Are Your Thoughts?\n\nDid you enjoy this article?
