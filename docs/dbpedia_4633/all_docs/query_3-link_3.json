        "text": "I'm asking because I've noticed quite a lot of trends with characters in anime, manga, mainstream comics as well as Tapastic comics, primarily falling under a category of either normal or exaggerated in design. Most work in my opinion, some borderline mary-sue characteristics, but I'm curious on what you guys think? Personally, I find the brown hair, green eyes, little sh*t character to pop up everywhere, heck, the main character of my comic here (Jim's Days, wink, wink, self promotion) is the same.\n\nOne of my least favorite stereotypical protagonist traits (for the females at least) is the oversized busts. Yes I know it can happen in real life, but it doesn't need to be almost EVERY single female protagonist (or protagonists love interest(for the male protagonists) or friend or you get what i mean) that's being created anymore. The athleticism (since most female protagonists are also athletic and/or good fighters) is lost when the bust gets too large proportionately to the girl. (and it's only fan service to an extent....which is another dislike of mine)\n\nIt's kind of a beef of mine being a female though (and it's not because I feel lacking in comparison). :/ I might have a problem with it personally but doesn't mean very many others agree.\n\nVery boring bland protagonists, ones that are nearly imperfect. Ones that you can't really feel anything towards because of how vanilla they are.\n\nAngry aloof protagonists that don't have any personality outside being annoyed or brusque and no motive for that behavior.\n\nAn asshole that gets no consequence for their actions, being an asshole also makes them complex because they're an asshole who cries and has some hamfisted backstory and you're suppose to relate to them. It ends up feeling like you're witnessing a relative you don't care much about go through turmoil or succeed at something and you're just like \"okay... great, whatever.\"\n\nPolitical protagonists. Oh my god those are the worst. The story ends up just being a very long PSA about some issue instead of a story and it's awful. Strawmen everywhere, no subtlety and depending where you stand on the issue you don't even care too much about it either because the protagonist is always right.\n\nI personally only notice big boobs when put into a comedic situation (I am easily humored), other than that, that's a good observation xD Personally, I don't like them either, only because they're kinda intimidating ^^\"\n\nInteresting insights Do you have some examples? ^^\"\n\nThe brave and strong hero in the end\n\nThe most common one I see for males are ADHD types who are a little dumb.\n\n(And I admit that my MC is one too)\n\nFor females, they are usually anti-socal, a little awkward, and a little nerdy/geeky.\n\nThere is a female stereotype that extend from that one which I sort of groan at. And it usually has the girl being very smart, she doesn't get along with other girls because \"she doesn't like preppy things\", plus preppy girl antagonist, and she has a love interest who is a boy who \"gets her\" (and is usually a male author's self insert or some perfect pretty boy)\n\nThe typical hotheaded (or purehearted) male protagonist with their typical cool headed but badass/mysterious rival male protagonist, who always seem to clash but secretly want to have each others' babies (ex. Naruto/Sasuke, Sora/Riku, Ippo/Mitaya, Hikaru/Akira, Mugen/Jin [well, maybe minus the babies part on the Mugen/Jin relationship]). I don't always hate them, but it IS extremely stereotypical. Also, when a set of protagonists all use a particular elemental as a power. Being the powers of fire, water, earth and air are really dull and uninspired. And you KNOW that the protagonist will pretty much always be FIRE because it's BADASS. For females, it's the typical damsel in distress while her male hero/heroes usually have to bail her out of most situations (like Kagame in Inuyasha or Hitomi in Escaflowne).\n\nOptimistic, pure-hearted, energetic, big eater, super loyal to ppl and will sacrifice self to PROTECT ALL THINGS and I MUST BECOME STRONGER SO I CAN PROTECT THEM and OH NO I WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH SO [BAD THING] HAPPENED IT'S ALL MY FAULT :'D sometimes a pacifist unless you push their berserk button (which would be.. hurting their friends. or maybe breaking a memento. or pointing out a flaw they're super self-conscious about).\n\nthat right there is about 70% of shounen protags lololol (disclaimer i have no real statistics)\n\nwill vary in degree of purity and intelligence. but these are usually idiots so their big heart/strength can be their endearing redeeming quality. an increase in intelligence usually balances out with a decrease in warmth.\n\nthe big eater quality seems to have started appearing much less? there's also The Wimp.\n\n..this made me remember and appreciate Deku from HeroAca again. he's an idiot only in terms of being a naive kid, but he's studious and smart otherwise, while also being the ultimate sweetheart haha\n\nThe character that doesn't have parents or family. They usually don't remember anything about their childhood or their past either. ^^; It's almost always the case where events in the story end up triggering distant memories for them that they would have otherwise forgotten about. I've noticed these qualities pretty much equally among male and female characters in anime/manga/movies/games.\n\nI recommend the hilarious Even A Monkey Can Draw Manga, by Aihara Koji and Takekuma Kentarou. Both are profoundly knowledgeable on the subject matter, but the book is a well-informed satire that is not only a scream to read, it's also a brilliant examination of Japanese comics and their best-known genres. This of course includes extensive analyses of protagonist traits done to death (which seem to sell regardless) and similarly overdone storytelling elements. Really brilliant look at comics that just about anyone can benefit from having read, although I must note it does have some decidedly not work-safe or \"family-friendly\" content, so don't whip it out at family dinner or anything.\n\nyou forgot Disney they love killing moms and dads off!\n\nLol oh right! xD The parentless characters of Disney!\n\ni have to say my big pet peeve about protagonist and/ or the characters around them is when the normal, boring, vanilla protag gets the stamp of \"pervert\" out of the blue because some little tramp decides \"hey I'm going to just flash my underwear or breast because \"I'M SEXY\" hey everyone looks at my body!\"\n\nas a female its kind of annoying that at times most female characters are reduce to up skirt shots or some out of the blue circumstance that magically takes their clothes off... its like (eye roll >_>)\n\nthat's a little why I'm not that much into anime as much as i was before these days.\n\nThe klutzy, awkward character. Unusual hobby. Dead or estranged family member for quick, no effort depth.\n\nYikes, sorry.\n\nThis is true, so much XD Where is everybody's parents?\n\nAlso the tsundere female protag, who pretends she doesn't love the guy by abusing him whenever she can.\n\nI think a trait that's really common and stereotypical is the wise cracking, smart aleck type of protagonist. The one who almost always can't take things seriously. The trait itself can be really charming or funny, but that type of character is almost always written the exact same way.\n\nHaha, it's fine. If that theme was in The Seventh Re:Set, I never really noticed it. I've noticed some spells like fire and ice, but I didn't remember anyone claiming to be the embodiment of those elements. I have nothing against characters using basic elements. I just find it really cheesy when four elemental users team up and go \"I am ______, the power of FIRE! I am ________, the power of EARTH!\", etc. And don't even get me started on the power of Heart. Or literal powers of Friendship and Love (which includes reviving people with tears of friendship/love). My eyes are rolling into the back of my head as I speak.\n\ncare bears will not be happy with this news\n\nas for the whole where is everybody's parents thing, there is a stage in life when you love your family but you want to just get as far away from them as possible ( this is what Christmas is for putting up with family for one week a year)"
