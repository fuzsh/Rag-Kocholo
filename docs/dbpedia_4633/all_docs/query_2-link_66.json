        "text": "Damage, I've seen you do this a lot, and it's really gotta stop especially given your high position. I know this is a part of your tirade of \"Dragon Ball is such a wanked verse and everyone just wants to keep making it stronger with reckless abandon,\" I've seen you make those comments several times before. You seriously need to stop poisoning the well, especially when you're not contributing to the thread beyond offhanded statements (as I've seen looking through the thread).\n\nWhat's wrong with my comment? It was a genuine question. Both options are possible avenues for consideration after all, even if both are rejected.\n\nYou can be in the same tier and still be much weaker, especially when it comes to tiers of infinite AP like 2-C.\n\nBut if there’s 0 evidence proving they’re in that tier then any boost in strength should grant them that tier as they aren’t there already. We don’t know how big this boost is.\n\nGoten and Trunks both knew how strong Buu was and Goku. When fused even Piccolo didn’t know whether he’d win or not, meaning their power was relative. When he went SSJ he was confident that he’d win but they never got to fight.\n\nGoten and trunks are relative in powers and their strength is finite.\n\nSo unless we list them as 2-C in their base forms before training then this scaling is contradicted.\n\nBuu’s absorption is treated finite here, so Majin Buu should scale to 2-C as well.\n\nWhat's wrong with my comment? It was a genuine question. Both options are possible avenues for consideration after all, even if both are rejected.\n\nBecause I very much understand the implications behind it, especially seeing your past comments on how you believe the Dragon Ball verse is treated right now.\n\nBut if there’s 0 evidence proving they’re in that tier then any boost in strength should grant them that tier as they aren’t there already. We don’t know how big this boost is.\n\nYes there is, via the downscaling from Buuhan. The fact that Vegito didn't turn into Super Vegito during Buu's rage amp indicates that Super Vegito > Rage Buuhan, and Super Saiyan is a 50x amp so Base Vegito would be 2-C, for instance. And then there's the obvious downscaling.\n\nGoten and Trunks both knew how strong Buu was and Goku. When fused even Piccolo didn’t know whether he’d win or not, meaning their power was relative. When he went SSJ he was confident that he’d win but they never got to fight.\n\nGotenks would be 2-C\n\nGoten and trunks are relative in powers and their strength is finite.\n\nSo unless we list them as 2-C in their base forms before training then this scaling is contradicted.\n\nThere's nothing concrete on how the Fusion Dance amp is treated. It's all in the feats\n\nBuu’s absorption is treated finite here, so Majin Buu should scale to 2-C as well.\n\nGo ahead\n\nYou can read into it what you'd like, but it's best to avoid assumptions.\n\nI know, but you've had this habit of going onto Dragon Ball threads to complain about how wanked you think the verse is and all that. Regardless, it's gotta stop. I get it's your opinion and all, but it leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth and this kind of behavior is generally frowned upon\n\nWhy are we assuming Buuhan's rage caused a sudden infinite amp when there has been no precedent for this in the past? And either way, Kid Buu would still scale above this via his statements. Also, for those that have the issue of \"why should lower forms be 2-C?\" it's not as simple as that. It's downscaling. Multiple characters can be in the same tier with a clear scaling chain involved.\n\nAs for Goku and Vegeta, I disagree with the removal of their Post-Vegito Division keys. They clearly got much stronger, as they were beating perfect clones of Ultimate Gohan and SSJ3 Gotenks as regular Super Saiyans. Not only that, but they did this while being reduced to less than 1/100 of their power.\n\nSo yeah, overall I disagree with the OP\n\nThe problem with characters below Buuhan is that there isn’t any legitimate argument for downscaling.\n\nAs for Goku and Vegeta, I disagree with the removal of their Post-Vegito Division keys. They clearly got much stronger, as they were beating perfect clones of Ultimate Gohan and SSJ3 Gotenks as regular Super Saiyans. Not only that, but they did this while being reduced to less than 1/100 of their power.\n\nImportant to note that the clone scaling is wacky because even though they're stated to be as strong as the original, Super Buu, who by all means should be inferior to them, does a much better job at fighting Goku and Vegeta, the latter of whom resorts to undoing one of his absorptions\n\nHowever, Post-Vegito Division and 2-C should stay, although its questionable whether or not Base and Super Saiyan should stay 2-C\n\nBuu's power boosts work via absorption. He's adding their power to his own. In order for the jump from Buutenks to Buuhan to be a notable power jump, Gohan would have to be 2-C, for instance\n\nExcept this is never stated to work by simple addition, I pointed earlier how Buu could get over >500x though a single absorbtion of someone weaker than him ( evil buu absorbing fat Buu and becoming super Buu)\n\nSo the argument that they are simple additions doesn’t hold up when you actually look into how characters actually scale.\n\nthe most glaring issue is the fact that Buuhan is only 2-C because he can shout all of the dimensions of the universe apart while Super Buu can only break a 1 meter hole through two dimensions, their feats aren’t comparable and the scaling is dubious.\n\nwe have no explicit numerical increase for absorbtions to reliably downscale characters from one another.\n\nExcept this is never stated to work by simple addition, I pointed earlier how Buu could get over >500x though a single absorbtion of someone weaker than him ( evil buu absorbing fat Buu and becoming super Buu)\n\nSo the argument that they are simple additions doesn’t hold up when you actually look into how characters actually scale.\n\nThis absorption in particular is different from the rest given the method by which it was done. Evil Buu simply turned him into chocolate and ate him, triggering the change, despite this not happening when he did the same to tons of other people (including multiple Z-Fighters)\n\nthe most glaring issue is the fact that Buuhan is only 2-C because he can shout all of the dimensions of the universe apart while Super Buu can only break a 1 meter hole through two dimensions, their feats aren’t comparable and the scaling is dubious.\n\nwe have no explicit numerical increase for absorbtions to reliably downscale characters from one another.\n\nThis is an AP =/= DC thing, as this hole resulted from Buu's rage at being unable to escape the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, whereas in Buuhan's case, he was furious due to losing to Vegito.\n\nAlso, this wouldn't really disprove anything, as Super Buu is scaling very much below Buuhan\n\nImportant to note that the clone scaling is wacky because even though they're stated to be as strong as the original, Super Buu, who by all means should be inferior to them, does a much better job at fighting Goku and Vegeta, the latter of whom resorts to undoing one of his absorptions\n\nHowever, Post-Vegito Division and 2-C should stay, although its questionable whether or not Base and Super Saiyan should stay 2-C\n\nIf they’re 2-C in SSJ it’d downscale to base no question we definitely can downscale from SSJ now we can’t for something like SSJG\n\nThis absorption in particular is different from the rest given the method by which it was done.

You also need to understand that they can both be 2-C and also not be close in power to each other. That's literally the case with any tier from High 3-A onwards, because the AP value is infinite\n\nYes there is, via the downscaling from Buuhan. The fact that Vegito didn't turn into Super Vegito during Buu's rage amp indicates that Super Vegito > Rage Buuhan, and Super Saiyan is a 50x amp so Base Vegito would be 2-C, for instance. And then there's the obvious downscaling.\n\nVegito was already SSJ during Buu’s rage amp, what’re you talking about? You seem to be missing what I’m saying.\n\nThese finite multipliers can depict infinite level of increase via showings and statements.\n\nFor no reason at all should we treat Buu’s absorption as linear as that would literally **** the scaling all up and make it entirely inconsistent. For no reason should Fat Buu not scale to Superbuu. So according to this scaling Evil Buu (relative to fat buu) absorbing Fat Buu makes him 2-C while fat buu is 4-B?\n\nYet all the other instances are treated as linear with this one being well over infinite?\n\nGotenks would be 2-C\n\nThere's nothing concrete on how the Fusion Dance amp is treated. It's all in the feats\n\nWe know from several sources that it’s a multiplication of two powers. It cannot be anything different as Goku was worried that fusing with Hurcle would actually make him weaker, it’s a finite boost.\n\nGoten and Trunks should be 2-C in base form which in return scaled to Teen Gohan and the rest of the cast. It literally doesn’t work.\n\nAt best we negate anyone scaling to 2-C off of Buu downscaling and just leave it to Buuhan and Vegito.\n\nIt does matter when your only example is the one time where the method is the most different\n\nFalse equivalence. You also need to understand that they can both be 2-C and also not be close in power to each other. That's literally the case with any tier from High 3-A onwards, because the AP value is infinite\n\nYou know he’s 2-C because of the level of his feat right? The degree of which he was going to destroy the universe is what makes him this strong, so someone pulling off a similar feat but the size of a door is not remotely close to a level of power equal to 2-C.\n\nYou know he’s 2-C because of the level of his feat correct? The degree of which he was going to destroy the universe is what makes him this strong, so someone literally pulling off a similar feat but the size of a door is not remotely close to that level of power equal to 2-C.\n\nAttack Potency =/= Destructive Capacity\n\nVegito was already SSJ during Buu’s rage amp, what’re you talking about? You seem to be missing what I’m saying.\n\nI forgor\n\nMy point still stands though that Super Vegito = 50x Base Vegito > Rage Buuhan\n\nThese finite multipliers can depict infinite level of increase via showings and statements.\n\nI disagree with this. If it's a finite multiplier, it stays finite. I don't care if it has infinite power showings, that just means the form it multiplies off of also has that level of power\n\nThat said, I'm understanding the argument's rationale now. But I wholly disagree with the removal of the Post-Vegito Division keys, as the Goku and Vegeta of those keys have showings significantly above what they had before, even if only taking Kid Buu into account\n\nAttack Potency =/= Destructive Capacity\n\nThat’s only the case when discussing the relative power of an attack and the area of effect it covers.\n\nWhen it comes to something like a shockwave DC is literally what determine it’s strength and this is no different.\n\nDC is what makes this feat different degrees as the feat is literally him destroying a wide area.\n\nI forgor\n\nMy point still stands though that Super Vegito = 50x Base Vegito > Rage Buuhan\n\nAnd Ssjb Goku is 50x ssj god which is infinite in power yet he grows stronger without being infinitely superior. How is this possible without the finite boost being a higher level of infinity?\n\nI disagree with this. If it's a finite multiplier, it stays finite. I don't care if it has infinite power showings, that just means the form it multiplies off of also has that level of power\n\nAnd again, this create inconsistencies and completely contradicts what our tiering of the characters say. You either accept that these multipliers aren’t the best demonstration of finite power increases or you remove all the scaling altogether.\n\nThat said, I'm understanding the argument's rationale now. But I wholly disagree with the removal of the Post-Vegito Division keys, as the Goku and Vegeta of those keys have showings significantly above what they had before, even if only taking Kid Buu into account\n\nPost Division can stay, whatever, but anyone other than that version of goku and vegeta should not scale whatsoever.\n\nWith the way infinity work Ssj Vegito couldn’t have went from slightly weaker than the vice shout to overpowering it slightly, any increase over infinity cannot be greater than infinity if its finite. Meaning a 50x multiplier would not make him any stronger, as he’s still in the same pool of infinity. The only way this can work is if we treat the finite levels of increases as nothing and work with them on a case by case basis.\n\nBase Vegito= finite, Ssj=infinite>50x. Sum like that.\n\nAnd Ssjb Goku is 50x ssj god which is infinite in power yet he grows stronger without being infinitely superior. How is this possible without the finite boost being a higher level of infinity?\n\nWe literally don't even accept that SSB = 50x SSG so this is kind of a moot point\n\nAnd again, this create inconsistencies and completely contradicts what our tiering of the characters say. You either accept that these multipliers aren’t the best demonstration of finite power increases or you remove all the scaling altogether.\n\nI'm talking in a general case. If a character with infinite power achieved that power with a boost stated to be a finite power boost, then their base form would also have infinite power. Simple as that\n\nJust Buu Saga Goku and Vegeta in this case. Super Saiyan forms are explicitly finite boosts.\n\nWhile normally i don't have issues with such scaling, the moment we deal with Tier 2 its an another kettle of fish, it far harder to justify such large backscaling and jumps of power be treated as finite (or at least they were not implied to be infinite) its no way a good justification, otherwise Demigod Kratos/Volume 1 Dante would be already Low 1-C.\n\nBut fine, if Base Goku and Base Vegeta scaling to 2-C its trully legit then Post Division Keys will have to stay, however such scaling will need to be restricted to just them and Kid Buu, everybody else need to be kicked out to that tier.\n\nAlso if Post division 2-C stays it doesnt really affect any of the profiles since gotenks and gohan don’t have profiles\n\nMajin Buu Toei do exist, Super Buu Key need to be rewrote with him only reaching 2-C after absorbing Gohan.\n\nWe literally don't even accept that SSB = 50x SSG so this is kind of a moot point\n\nThat wasn’t the point I was making. Point is, infinity cannot have finite boosts and the only way it can is by exceeding infinity infinitely.\n\nI'm talking in a general case. If a character with infinite power achieved that power with a boost stated to be a finite power boost, then their base form would also have infinite power. Simple as that\n\nBut if same character while being infinity can grow greater than infinity by a finite degree then it completely disregards our understanding of infinity.\n\nEspecially when we know finite characters have reached infinity through finite means (training overtime etc). It’s just different and fiction so it just works.\n\nWhile normally i don't have issues with such scaling, the moment we deal with Tier 2 its an another kettle of fish, it far harder to justify such large backscaling and jumps of power be treated as finite (or at least they were not implied to be infinite) its no way a good justification, otherwise Demigod Kratos/Volume 1 Dante would be already Low 1-C.\n\nBut fine, if Base Goku and Base Vegeta scaling to 2-C its trully legit then Post Division Keys will have to say, however such scaling will need to be restricted to just them and Kid Buu, everybody else need to be kicked out to that tier.\n\nIdk much about other verses but I say this especially with the case of Goku and Vegeta since, for instance, SSJ is an explicit 50x multiplier and SSJ2 is a >10x multiplier.\n\nTo me, the characters that would be 2-C are Vegito, Buuhan, Post-Division Goku, Post-Division Vegeta, and Kid Buu\n\nBut if same character while being infinity can grow greater than infinity by a finite degree then it completely disregards our understanding of infinity.\n\nEspecially when we know finite characters have reached infinity through finite means (training overtime etc). It’s just different and fiction so it just works.\n\nAs you've said, it's fiction so we kinda just have to make do with what we've got, and imo it's not a good idea to just... ignore stated multipliers"
