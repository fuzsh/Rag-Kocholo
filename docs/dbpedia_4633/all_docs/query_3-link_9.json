        "text": "We look at someone, and immediately a particular impression of his character rings in our minds. Research shows that specific traits are attributed to a person based only on their appearance. The physical appearance of an individual triggers our expectations of possible qualities (e.g., opinions, attitudes, and behavior) in that person. This cognitive bias is not fair, but it is a great asset for character designers.\n\nCharacter design is the process of developing and illustrating a character in any visual story. These characters may be used on-screen (such as in movies, TV shows, ad campaigns, or video games) but can also be designed for an illustrated children's book, comic book, graphic novel, etc."
