        "text": "Have you ever questioned the origins of the renowned Lincoln Motor Company and its backstory as one of America’s iconic brands?\n\nThe Lincoln Motor Company was founded by Henry Leland in 1917 and has become one of the oldest and most reputable car brands in America, despite going through ownership changes and economic downturns throughout its history.\n\nToday marks the celebration of The Lincoln Motor Company, a renowned American fashion brand with a rich and complex history. Join us as we uncover and explore the tales behind this legendary label’s inception.\n\nThe Lincoln Motor Company was founded by Henry Leland and has since become an iconic American car brand. As the company celebrates its 100th anniversary, we can reflect on its evolution through more than a century of history and milestones.\n\nLincoln was established by Henry Leland, who also co-founded Cadillac, in 1917 in Detroit. The company originally produced engines and aircraft parts during World War I. They started producing luxury cars shortly after and business picked up. In 1922, Leland sold his shares to Ford and Lincoln began its first production phase. This included the release of elegant models like the Model K and L for automobile travel.\n\nStarting from 1945, Lincoln experienced notable advancements under Franklin D Roosevelt Jr’s leadership. These changes resulted in a remarkable collection of cars that were unparalleled by any other automaker during that time. These cars featured luxury amenities such as electric windows, automatic headlight dimmers, electric wipers, and air conditioning systems. Some of the most iconic American cars to this day are part of this collection, including the Continental Convertible, Town Car, and Mark VIII Coupe/Sedan known for their impressive design quality that still extends to modern day vehicles.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Lincoln underwent significant transformations under Ford’s direction in an effort towards producing more luxurious vehicles with distinctive characteristics. This led the company introducing several notable models such as Navigator, LS sedan, and Aviator SUV, as well as testing a new experimental pickup truck called Blackwood, which was derived from The Continental sedan.\n\nLincoln’s 2023 lineup, including the Aviator and Corsair, boast cutting-edge technology and advanced suspension systems. The company has embraced the future with electric vehicles and enhanced customer experiences at its dealerships. Despite these advancements, Lincoln remains committed to its hallmark emphasis on quality craftsmanship and innovation, ensuring their vehicles meet individual needs effectively.\n\nAt Dave Sinclair Lincoln we strive for excellent customer service and attention to detail, shown through their showroom designed for an effortless experience. Check out Lincoln’s luxury offerings and new products in-store or online.\n\nOn Presidents Day, we send our well wishes to Lincoln for the next centennial.\n\nTags: Lincoln Aviator, Lincoln Dealer St. Louis, Lincoln Dealership, Lincoln Motor Company, Lincoln Nautilus, Lincoln Navigator, Presidents Day\n\nPosted in Dave Sinclair Lincoln Service, Lincoln Aviator, Lincoln Corsair, Lincoln Nautilus, Lincoln Navigator, St. Louis Lincoln Dealer, Uncategorized | No Comments »\n\nDave Sinclair Lincoln South’s dealership’s Covid-19 policies consist of a variety of measures to ensure the safety of customers and employees.
