        "text": "[Author here]\n\n> The developers of the QL may have had foresight as well, but thereâ€™s nothing in the QL to persuade me that they were able to deliver on it.\n\nAnd yet, and yet...\n\nThe thing is that the QL, as it shipped, was a fairly usable box. The Mac, as it shipped, really wasn't.\n\nYes, Microdrives were not great, but you got two of them. A Mac with dual drives was *way* more usable, as was an Amiga with two drives. Yes, the Microdrives only held 100kB on a good day, but the Mac shipped with single-sided drives, so they only held 400kB. When you only have 128kB of RAM, copying a file to another medium with one drive meant lots of swaps... but with 2 drives, it was easy, even if the OS only had a kilobyte free for buffering.\n\nSinclair's gamble was that two small cheap drives were better than one.\n\nI don't know if Sinclair knew that the Mac was coming, but I don't think it did. I don't think anyone did. I think a just-about-affordable GUI computer shocked the industry.\n\nYes, the QL was horribly flawed. Yes, it was overall a worse computer. No argument there.\n\nBut I had a ZX Spectrum because it was the only way I could get a home computer with sound and colour graphics for Â£80 (second hand) in 1983 or so.\n\nI knew quite a few people who had QLs because the machine was the only way you could get a multitasking 16-bit workstation-class computer for less than several thousand pounds -- until the Amiga and so on came along, and don't forget, the Amiga 1000 was 18 months later and at nearly $1,500.\n\n(The ST was one month earlier than the A1000, but didn't have multitasking until years later.)\n\nI am not trying to defend the QL or say is was better. It wasn't. But it was unique. There was nothing like it for a long time afterwards. It launched 7 months before the IBM PC AT, which the late great Guy Kewney called \"my first taste of Raw Computer Power\" (his capitals).\n\nAnd remember, the AT also didn't have multitasking. That only came much later, with SCO Xenix, because Intel removed a feature from the final version of the 80286 CPU which DR Concurrent DOS 286 needed to multitask DOS apps.\n\nThe fact that there were over a dozen QL compatibles says something too. The early ones were maxed-out QLs, with all the RAM it could take, proper floppy drives, and better keyboards... but they cost 3-4x as much. There was real genius in Sinclair's ability to make something viable for so little money, just as it did with the ZX80, ZX81 and ZX Spectrum.\n\nI think that's why even now, you can still buy a new QL compatible. I think that's amazing, and I think it says important things about staying power, about what it offered.\n\nSinclair bet wrongly. It bet that multitasking was key; it wasn't, that was the GUI. Sinclair bet that two small slow drives were better than a single bigger, faster, but more expensive one. That, in the end, was wrong: they were too small, too slow, too cheap, and most of all, too unreliable. Sinclair bet that getting into the expanding business market was more important than a better games computer. It was wrong, and Amstrad proved that by making money from the ZX Spectrum, something I believe Sinclair never did. (While the ZX81 was hugely profitable, the Spectrum wasn't until the +2 and +3.)\n\nBut it's not wrong or bad to have aspirations. Sinclair wanted to escape from the niche of unbeatably cheap games computers by making an unbeatably cheap business computer. That's a worthy aspiration.\n\nYes, the Amiga and ST were vastly better in every way, but they also came along a year or so _after_ the Mac and so they were informed by it. I think the ST was the machine the QL should have been: a cheap, commodity 68000 computer, with slightly-better-than-an-eight-bit graphics and, if I remember correctly, a variant of _the same_ sound chip as the ZX Spectrum 128. It was, as the saying goes, Just Barely Good Enough. A minimal viable 68000 computer, built as much as possible with ordinary off-the-shelf bits and an inspired adaptation of an off-the-shelf OS -- in ROM, so single-disk operation was tolerable.\n\nWhich, I think, is why the QL OS moved to the ST and only later back again.\n\nYes, the QL was horribly cheap and constrained by its price point... *But so was the original Mac, even though it cost 5x as much*... And at Â£400 the QL was *less* constrained than the 128k Mac at Â£1,840. That, looking back, is IMHO amazing and worthy of respect.\n\nThe QL did not save Sinclair. It was a bold try, though. Sinclair didn't to know the world was about to perform a massive technological pivot mere weeks later.\n\nBut the QL wasn't a flop. It inspired multiple ranges of compatible machines and a line of technological development on its OS that continued for over 20 years, a time span in which...\n\n1. The Mac moved to a new CPU family (the Power Macs)...\n\n2. Then moved to a whole new OS (OS X, that is, NeXTstep with a Mac-like facelift)...\n\n3. Then Apple launched Power Macs that couldn't boot the old OS, to nail the coffin lid shut...\n\n4. Then Apple moved that new OS to a new CPU family... killing the ability to run the old OS in a VM...\n\n5. Then removed support for legacy apps via emulation on the new OS.\n\nIn all that time, the last QL OS was still being developed.\n\nRe: In some regards the Macintosh almost feels like a Sinclair...???\n\nSingle video mode? Wrong.\n\nJust because you saw a 9 inch screen with square pixels actually meant nothing when it came to what the OS was doing. And could do.\n\nQuickdraw 1.0 allowed remarkable flexibility as to both resolutions, color etc. Which is why if you had gone to a Mac trade show in 1985 in the US (or UK) there were a bunch of companies showing various color monitors hanging off expansion cards for the Mac. Now Color Quickdraw in 1987 was the first to give us full component pixmaps but Quickdraw 1.0 was anything but single color single mode. Just like with the AT if you wanted color it would cost you. I even saw some pretty nice color hardcopy output from a CopyBits and some fancy QD footwork. Then the LaserWriter shipped in 1985 and the real fun started.\n\nThe Serial Mouse? All mice were hanging off serial ports until ADB came along. And later USB in PC-land. And the thing about the serial port is - sooner or later there is an interrupt - somewhere or other. To see where the little bastard has moved to now. If you had connected a mouse to a PC running Window 3.0 circa 1990 guess which port you connected it to. And guess what the mouse driver did on install. Register a serial port interrupt handler. Well the more responsive ones did. At least on the Mac with non ADB mice the most serious problem was a fluffy mouse ball. One of the great problems of life solved by optical mice.\n\nThe audio. Having PCM buffers as an option was a joy to work with even if the early Toolbox trap support was rather sparse. Took the PC world years to catch up. And the basic sound synthesizer types supported by the first driver was low stress to use. The reason why it was shoehorned in the way it was simply there is only so much you can do given the hardware you have to work with. Nothing unusual with that. You should see what some of the 16 bit / 32 bit game console hardware does. I've got both Sega Gen and PSX 1 stories.\n\nThe 3.5 floppy drive? Well there was that IWM chip on the logic board. The Integrated Woz Machine. That did most of the floppy drive heavy lifting. The only bit the CPU was really involved with could be found in SonyVars in the Low Memory Globals. Which was just feeding the IWM. To control a feature the Sony drives shipped with. The way that Sony told people to. I think I still have the Sony docs for that drive somewhere. Probably in MacWrite format.\n\nHave a look at the logic board schematics . There are quite a lot of chips on there. Not the just the CPU, the RAM, and the usual jelly bean 74LS chips tying it all together. And unlike the original Apple II motherboard schematics (from 1977) its actual pretty easy to work out what does what.\n\nIts a very efficient and very creative logic board design. Which is always the sign of a really first rate hardware designer."
