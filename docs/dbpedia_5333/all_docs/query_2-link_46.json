        "text": "30 July 1940 – 16 September 2021\n\nSir Clive Marles Sinclair passed away at home this morning, Thursday 16th September 2021.\n\nHe had been ill for some time.\n\nFor many of us, he had been a life-long hero. For me, it all started with the calculators and Black Watch back in my school days in the early 1970s, and eventually the computers in the early 1980s.\n\nHis career started as an assistant editor of a magazine, before founding Sinclair Radionics in 1961. Science Of Cambridge was founded in the 1970s, and took the name Sinclair Computers in 1980, and Sinclair Research Ltd in March 1981.\n\nHe was knighted in 1983 and went on to focus on electric transportation, starting with the Sinclair C5, with his company Sinclair Vehicles Ltd.\n\nHe was a member of British Mensa, and was Chair of the organisation from 1980 to 1997.\n\nSir Clive Sinclair is survived by his three children, Crispin, Bartholomew and Belinda."
