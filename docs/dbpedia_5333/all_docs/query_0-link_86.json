        "text": "This page does not require a rating on Wikipedia's content assessment scale.\n\nIt is of interest to the following WikiProjects:\n\nArchive 1 Archive 2 Archive 3 Archive 4\n\nI note that there are relatively few stub categories within the general Hawaiʻi stub space. I'm thinking of creating a history related stub, as I think that might help to identify where some of the history buffs could help contribute. There's already categories for geography, politicians, and radio stations. Perhaps we could add a few more categories of stubs, just to help organize them a bit. (Better yet, let's all expand them...but one thing at a time, yes?) I'll create the history stub, once I recall how that works. I'm going to first use it as a section stub on the Kauaʻi page, since it's history section is really just one paragraph. Feedback, as always, welcome. (By the way, would this be better placed here, or on the Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Hawaii/General page?) Davidlwilliamson (talk)\n\nHi. IMO, the stub project should have been disbanded a long time ago, as the WikiProject assessment and category system have all but replaced it with \"Stub-Class\" categories. I think you have made a good argument for beginning the process of splitting articles into work groups (also called \"task forces\"), in this case, a Hawaii history work group. This is easy to setup and makes a lot of sense. IIRC, by modifying the project template to allow for this option, we can place the articles in both a WikiProject Hawaii history work group and a WikiProject History work group category. Other projects can be added to the mix, such as the United States history work group. This is ideal, and allows us to collaborate across projects by coordinating a separate collaboration/work group page. Stub categories in the mainspace may have once been useful years ago, but at this point they are not very helpful. The first step would be to create Category:WikiProject Hawaii task forces, and then add Wikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Hawaii history task force or something similar. After we tag all of the articles with the history task force flag, we can create separate assessment statistics that lists the articles by quality and importance. We can make a bot request to start us off, merely by tagging all articles within Hawaii history-related categories. —Viriditas | Talk\n\nSo many standards to choose from. :-) I went ahead and created the relevant stub category and template, and then discovered there's a procedure for such things, which I entirely violated. I just finished proposing such a stub category, but you're arguments about the utility (or lack of) of stubs makes sense to me, and using the Wikiproject framework to help coordinate this sort of thing seems ideal. So...I think we should get started on organizing the task force bits, and I'll go ask for speedy deletion of the cruft I created this evening. (On a sad note, it's cold and rainy here in San José, which sucks compared to the beautiful weather I experienced this morning in Līhuʻe. Bummer.) Davidlwilliamson (talk)\n\nNo worries. One thing we have to do is get a rough estimate of how many history-related articles we are dealing with. I see 97 articles in Category:History of Hawaii and 11 subcategories. These articles represent an informal criteria for inclusion, but I suggest you come up with a rough one based on what we already have, or a modification that you think works better. Your criteria will then be used to sift through what we already have and to add new articles. As for creating the task force, that's the easy part. Do you have the time and the energy to take a leadership role here? I can help set it up, but somebody is going to have to maintain it. —Viriditas | Talk\n\nI might be up for that, as long as no one expects a lot of progress too quickly - my day job generally keeps me pretty busy. In terms of number of articles - the history category seems to have a nice start, but the individual island entries could certainly use some work and aren't in that category. I suspect that something like 150-200 articles are history related in some way. Hawaiʻi seems to also be one of those places where history and geogrpahy are intimately related, so many geographical pages may be relevant to history, too, which may increase the total article count. I'll make a point of thinking about inclusion criteria and see if I can some up with something useful. Davidlwilliamson (talk)\n\nGreat. Why don't you take some time to think about this? Check out Category:History_WikiProjects to see how some projects use task forces while others use separate WikiProjects. My preference would be to start with a task force, and if you can recruit enough people and interest in improving articles, then split it off into its own project. But please, make note of the inactive projects. One reason for keeping this as a task force for the time being, is to prevent the project from collapsing. —Viriditas | Talk\n\nOkay, I finally wrote a stub for this, please help! Mahalo, Chris (クリス • フィッチ) (talk)\n\nThomas George Thrum is still only a redirect to this page. We could use a bio. Viriditas (talk)\n\nAdded new link to online copy of Thrum's hosted by UH. Viriditas (talk)\n\nHi; not part of this WikiProject but I've worked on these two articles; I'm wondering if they should be part of your WP; Kanaka certainly I'd think, but in Owyhee's case it's to do with the legacy of Hawaiian workers/settlers in North America; it's currently a disambig but I think it shouldn't be, although it's still mostly only a list page, just one needing some discussion as to how the name came about. The particular Hawaiian the HBC mappers/explorers named the river for can probably be determined, by the way, from company logs; or the specific incident as to how it gots its name anyway.Skookum1 (talk)\n\nGood catch. We need to decide what to do here. Primary topic disambiguation, etc... Viriditas (talk)\n\nActually, as long as we're on the subject of revitalization, I've taken over the maintenance tasks on P:HI. Most of this work involved creating templates to ensure consistent formatting throughout the portal, particularly on the pictures and \"on this date\" features.\n\nI was hoping to have another couple of standardized items in place before asking for help, but now seems as good a time as any to expand the content. So, to that end, I'd be greatly appreciative if people could help flesh out the following areas:\n\nSelected anniversaries (current month)\n\nSelected biographies\n\nʻŌlelo\n\nQuotes\n\nThe formatting has been set for the selected anniversaries, and the biography/ʻŌlelo/quotes content should be fairly self-explanatory. I think we're more or less all right on pictures and articles, although it never hurts to add any good content that you may know of.\n\nMahalo! --jonny-mt\n\nHow do you feel about going for a more tropical color and floral scheme? —Viriditas | Talk\n\nIs there a good way to handle floating holidays like Malasada Day on the Selected anniversary page? —Viriditas | Talk\n\nI actually don't mind the current color scheme that much--it seems to be based on the Hawaiian flag--but if you want to try something out, feel free to go nuts! As far as floating holidays go, I don't think there's a good way to handle those using the magic word-based system that's currently in place, but I can check it out. --jonny-mt\n\nI would like to see a more tropical/floral scheme. The page looks great, and I realize they are colors of the Hawaiian flag, but it has more of a British feel than a Hawaiian feel, imo. If no one minds, I'd like to take a crack at it a few days yonder... : ) --MPerel\n\nBE BOLD!!! I just thought this was a better start for the design, because I didn't like that ghastly black bordered box. No offense to anybody involved in creating that, of course... – The Obento Musubi (Contributions)\n\nWe should collaborate with the Hawaiian Wikipedia to improve the design of that encyclopedia, because I, for one, am not satisfied with the main page. – Obento Musubi (C • G • S)\n\nI'm up for giving the main page a facelift as well, but it's protected and there are no active administrators available. As far as I know, Singularity, haw:User:Kamehameha, and myself are the only active editors. Kal (talk)\n\nI must have not been logged in last time, because I can now edit the main page. Odd. Kal (talk)\n\nWas fixing spelling errors and came across article Kahikikala. It like several (~45) Hawaiian-topic articles use the word 'chiefess', and sometimes 'chiefly', in ways I now believe are unique or most closely associated with Hawaiian history. Among other places I looked up the word at Wiktionary but was dissatisfied with what I found there. I left comments to that affect on the wikt page's talk page, mentioning a nice reference for the unique usages. There is no article here at en:WP for the word, and I don't suppose there should be (entry should be expanded at wikt). Is there some page here which talks about Hawaiian terms, including 'chiefess' and 'chiefly'? Shenme (talk)\n\n\"Chiefly\" should be unproblematic: it's just a normal English word meaning \"of or pertaining a chief or to to the office of chief\", analogous to \"presidential\".\n\n\"Chiefess\" seems weird to me. We don't use \"authoress\" or \"aviatrix\"; why not just use \"chief\" even when the chief is a woman? - Jmabel | Talk\n\nTo me it is the other way 'round. I find \"Chiefly\" strange, since it is a normal English adjective or adverb, not used as a title. I do not mind the word \"Chiefess\", since Hawaiian names can often be used for both sexes, and it helps me keep track of which one of the couple is the mother etc. I just created an article using the word in its title: Chiefess Kapiʻolani to distinguish from the Queen. There is a school in Hilo officially called \"Chiefess Kapiʻolani\". Some aricles just call them \"Aliʻi\", but that is not an English word so should be used sparingly in my opinion, and gives no clue of sex either. For Wikpedia precedent, notice we talk about Louis XIV as \"King Louis XIV of France\", not \"Le Roi Louis Quatorze\". Sometimes they are \"High Chief\" too, but since a person's title can change through life (as the previous Aliʻi Nui passes away, etc.) That is also problematic. Some articles also used \"Chieftess\" but those are mostly gone. The Aliʻi article once said the title would be translated as \"Lord\" or \"Lady\" but I have never seen them used. \"Noble\" would be another reasonable term, since there was a \"House of Nobles\" for example in the Kingdom. Perhaps the \"Aliʻi\" article could be expanded. As usual, sources would be nice! W Nowicki (talk)\n\nI'm way outside of my areas of expertise here and seeking help. Seems to me like the article Akahi Nui is hostile to its subject (which reminds me of an old joke: \"But the King is not a 'subject'!\"). I made a few edits to tone that down, but I don't know enough about the topic to do much more. For an example of an article bringing a much more neutral tone to a similar topic, see Quentin Kawānanakoa.\n\nI left a note several days ago at Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard‎ but it doesn't seem to have produced any response.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. - Jmabel | Talk\n\nAt the urging of Viriditas, I've followed-up on a question posed in the first issue of the WPHawaiʻi newsletter and reexamined some old disputes related to eight significant articles. I've put my comments below in the hopes of getting some wider feedback.\n\nTalk:Apology Resolution#Dispute - Resolved with this edit; accepted as a resolution here.\n\nTalk:Evan Dobelle#Dispute - Resolved with a semi-protect that was lifted here. User:FisherQueen's advice to properly source the claims was taken to heart, and it seems to be standing today.\n\nTalk:Hawaii#Dispute - Don't see any indication that the dispute over okina and other diacritics is still ongoing, but I don't think this will ever be fully solved until MOS:HAWAII reaches a solid consensus.\n\nTalk:Kingdom of Hawaii/Archive 1#Dispute - Although the dispute is no longer ongoing in User:JereKrischel's absence, I don't think the NPOV issues are smoothed out enough in the section on the overthrow to warrant removing the tag. Specifically, a number of claims in the section are written for the other party in the dispute rather than for a general audience--claims are led with \"Russ says\" or \"Kizner wrote\" which, while not bad in and of itself, serves to place more of an emphasis on presenting specific, verifiable points of view about rather than creating a neutrally-toned encyclopedic overview. I'd leave this one on for the time being.\n\nTalk:Legal status of Hawaii#Dispute - Doesn't seem to be ongoing; the article has remained in place since the initial dispute.\n\nTalk:Liliuokalani/Archive 1#Dispute - Although the initial dispute seems to have more or less died down, it seems that some of the issues related to the overthrow are still percolating in this article. While it could probably do without the dispute tag, it might be a good idea to get some more eyeballs on it.\n\nTalk:Morgan Report#Dispute - This one also seems more or less settled, and the POV tag has been removed.\n\nTalk:Overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy#Dispute - Although the original dispute has more or less died down, given the events of recent months I think more work is needed here to obtain a neutral balance.\n\nMahalo! --jonny-mt\n\nRe 3: This is effectively resolved at the MOS, at least for the text, in favor of using diacritics. WP:UE says diacritics are neither encouraged nor discouraged, while WP:MOS cites the Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Ireland-related articles) as a good example of diacritic guidelines, which would mean they should be used for all Hawaiian language words. The remaining debate is with WP:NAME. In this case, diacritics are expressly discouraged, but 1) they're already widely used, and 2) the Irish MOS uses them in titles. Anybody who would like to weigh in on this, please do so on the, because I'd like to see the MOS finalized; I think doing so would prevent individual page disputes like those at Hawaii and Iao Valley from repeatedly breaking out. Personally I prefer to leave them out because I dislike having garbage characters in the address bar, but I think it's far less important than the general usage issue. KarlM (talk)\n\nCan someone please find for me, in the Hawaii Revised Statutes, a citation for local government format (i.e. counties have all the power, no cities except Honolulu) that's used in Hawaii?

See Google Ling.Nut (WP:3IAR)\n\nThis ecoregion has been listed on the project for years as needing creation under the standard name. See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Hawaii/Article_requests if you want to help out or just place a new request. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI may work on some of those, but before I do, where did those \"standard names\" come from? Are they to make the names standard across Wikipedia? In Hawaii the elevational terms are \"montane\" and \"lowland\", rather than \"high\" and \"low\" (the latter are ambiguous, as it could refer to the height of the plants). I'm pretty sure those are in standard scientific usage across other regions as well.

These were chosen from the articles with this project's talk page tag, based on the rated importance and quality. If there are any specific articles that should be removed, please let us know at Wikipedia talk:Version 0.7. You can also nominate additional articles for release, following the procedure at Wikipedia:Release Version Nominations.\n\nA list of selected articles with cleanup tags, sorted by project, is available. The list is automatically updated each hour when it is loaded. Please try to fix any urgent problems in the selected articles. A team of copyeditors has agreed to help with copyediting requests, although you should try to fix simple issues on your own if possible.\n\nWe would also appreciate your help in identifying the version of each article that you think we should use, to help avoid vandalism or POV issues. These versions can be recorded at this project's subpage of User:SelectionBot/0.7. We are planning to release the selection for the holiday season, so we ask you to select the revisions before October 20. At that time, we will use an automatic process to identify which version of each article to release, if no version has been manually selected. Thanks!

Also, while I honor and love Auntie Nona Beamer (I never heard her associated with the word until I read the page -- very interesting!), the word \"Hawaiiana\" has come to be seen as a little 1)dated, and 2)representative of an incomplete view of Hawai'i, as it is often associated with entities like Bishop Museum, which are generally viewed by Kanaka Maoli scholars as purporting viewpoints without a full understanding of their subject matter. Mahalo! --Laualoha 10:49, 3 October 2008 (UTC)\n\nI sympathize with you, but the Bishop Museum has been nothing but a positive force for Hawaii and her people. We need more, not less of their work.

Viriditas (talk)\n\nI think I could help while running a one-man show at haw-wiki. Was there any specific template you thought of basing WP Hawaiʻi's template on? —Kal (talk)\n\nHeh, you've got quite the wit about you. Touche. The best way you can help is with your input. And, you know what? Let's put a link to haw-wiki in there, too. :) Viriditas (talk)\n\nAny wit that may have slipped in was not intentional. :P Anyway, I'll try to take a look at some of the templates tomorrow and give some input. —Kal (talk)\n\nThanks. Viriditas (talk)\n\nSounds great! I'd be glad to help. – Obento Musubi (C • G • S)\n\nI'm creating it now. It is at Wikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Invite. I figured it would clutter up the template namespace, so I should just keep it within our Wikiproject. – Obento Musubi (C • G • S)\n\nWow, that looks great :) Very appealing to potential members. —Kal (talk)\n\n0 articles in Category:Hawaii articles missing geocoordinate data do not have geographic coordinates. Coords are useful for making the article appear on Google Maps & many other mapping services; and they allow our users to click through to see the article subject location on a map. There's a short guide to on how to add geocodes to articles ... it really is very easy to do. I hope you'll take some time to ensure that Hawaii is as well represented as it can be on wikipedia by fixing up the listed articles. thanks --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nFather Damien is in need of in-line citations. Any help would be most welcome. -- Secisek (talk)\n\nIn progress. I will be updating the bibliography after Friday, January 2, 2009. I will also be helping to bring this article to GA status and encourage other to participate. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI have requested help over at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Hiking_Trails#Collaboration_request. Please add any trails to Category:Hiking trails in Hawaii. Thanks. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI am pleased to announce that the French WikiProject Hawaii (called \"Projet Hawaï\" in French) has been launched. Please see this to join! All Francophones are wanted! So, if you speak French, please join us! We need help! Merci beaucoup ! obentomusubi\n\nGood work. I would like to know how we on the English Wikipedia can help facilitate the translation process. Viriditas (talk)\n\nAny Francophones who know English can informally translate, or we can collaborate with the translating team to formally translate from French to English by having outsiders translate the article impartially. If you create a page on the French Wikipedia, don't forget to add the template {{WikiProjet Hawaii|avancement=XX|importance=XX}} on the talk page, replacing XX with the class and importance, respectively. Thanks, obentomusubi\n\nIt's probably obvious, but I recommend starting with the FA/GA articles on en. Viriditas (talk)\n\nGood idea. There are currently two FA (in French AdQ, article de qualité) articles on the French Wikipedia that may contain information that could be added to WP Hawaii (Ukulélé and Mauna Loa). obentomusubi\n\nI thought this WikiProject might be interested. Ping me with any specific queries or leave them on the page linked to above.

I'd like to draw your attention to the new WikiProject coordinators' working group, an effort to bring both official and unofficial WikiProject coordinators together so that the projects can more easily develop consensus and collaborate. This group has been created after discussion regarding possible changes to the A-Class review system, and that may be one of the first things discussed by interested coordinators.\n\nAll designated project coordinators are invited to join this working group. If your project hasn't formally designated any editors as coordinators, but you are someone who regularly deals with coordination tasks in the project, please feel free to join as well. — Delievered by §hepBot (Disable) on behalf of the WikiProject coordinators' working group at\n\nI'm interested in creating a workgroup for Volcanism of Hawaii, based here. I'de like to tackle the topic, but I can't do it all by myself! So far this is only a proposal. Also going out to WP:VOLCANO. Cheers, ResMar\n\nCoordination and update needed. Viriditas (talk)\n\nThe lede of Aloha Tower claims that it is a lighthouse. All evidence from NOAA and the USCG indicates that this isn't the case and probably never was the case. If someone can come up with a good cite, OK, but in the meantime I don't know that I can edit the lede to remove this without destroying it. As it is, it's rather puffy anyway. I'm also posting this at WP:NRHP. Mangoe (talk)\n\nAccording to this historic lighthouse article it appears to have been designed to be an \"observation tower with a beacon\":\n\nAn article in the May 30, 1926 edition of the Honolulu Advertiser provided a detailed description of the tower, including the following lines on its beacon. “On top of the tower the harbor light, which is now located on Sand Island, is to be installed, and the light on Sand Island done away with. The light will be known as Honolulu Light, and will be visible to ships at sea for many miles.\"\n\nSo, the intro appears to be somewhat accurate. We could add some of this to the article with cite for good measure. --Travis Thurston+\n\nThat's not the same thing as a lighthouse though. I think it would be more accurate to say that the light on the tower is used as a beacon by ships, than to say that the tower is a lighthouse. The latter implies that it was designed for the purpose of housing the light, rather than that the light was put there because it's a tall building that happens to be near the ocean (which seems to be what happened). KarlM (talk)\n\nHow about \"The Aloha Tower is an observation building and monument considered to be one of the premier landmarks...\" Its reference as a \"guiding beacon\" is stated in the second sentence. more ref material --Travis Thurston+\n\nI've been pointed to some material that indicates that it did function as a lighthouse for a period. I think maybe the best approach might be a slight rewrite which makes it a bit clearer what the various functions were. We have a couple of other similar cases nationwide. Mangoe (talk)\n\nI am having a hard time explaining to a fellow about how okina is appropriate for references in to Kapaʻau in article Kapaau, Hawaii. The same guy seems to think that Census stats are more significant than its status as birthplace of Kamehameha. If anyone wants to straighten me out re Okina within articles on Hawaii places, or take a crack at persuading him, please see Talk:Kapaau, Hawaii#Okina in name. -J JMesserly (talk)\n\nLeft my comment there. Not deriding anyone in particular at all, but the mindset of treating Hawaiʻi English polished spelling as \"foreign\" spelling and not \"correct\" English strikes me as uptight arrogance from a grammatical ivory tower, divorced from the reality of valid regional variation of Standard English. It becomes exhausting after so long. - Gilgamesh (talk)\n\nIt will take time. To her dying day, my grandmother from texas pronounced it Hawaiya, no matter how many times we corrected her. And what she did to spanish was much worse... I never understood why because she lived in a border town. The parochialism is not limited of course. Interestingly, the Russians don't have a letter for a soft h sound, but instead of substitutiting their hard H, they use G. So Hollywood sounds like Goellywvood, and then there is Goenoelulu, Gahvai, and so on. I'm not making this up. Anyway, long term- in english, given the globalization of the language it makes sense to upgrade it at some point to add a few more glyphs, like the gargly \"h\" sound the Jewish toast \"lechaim\"- it occurs in Russian and northern african languages. It's shear conjecture and it may take several decades, but it makes sense. -J JMesserly (talk)\n\nWe don't need the header, the project name should appear first, not a flower, and there needs to be more information located towards the top rather than falling towards the bottom. Viriditas (talk)\n\nNo offense, but your project page is a total mess. I endevoured to try and fix it in my sandbox, but it was uneedingly complex and unyeilding to no end...ResMar\n\nIt seems to be getting worse as the days go by. It needs a complete overhaul. I can barely read anything and the image on top is driving me nuts. Viriditas (talk)\n\nWould like to see some suggestions on redoing the project page. Viriditas (talk)\n\nThis message is being sent to WikiProjects with GAs under their scope. Since August 2007, WikiProject Good Articles has been participating in GA sweeps. The process helps to ensure that articles that have passed a nomination before that date meet the GA criteria. After nearly two years, the running total has just passed the 50% mark. In order to expediate the reviewing, several changes have been made to the process. A new worklist has been created, detailing which articles are left to review. Instead of reviewing by topic, editors can consider picking and choosing whichever articles they are interested in.\n\nWe are always looking for new members to assist with reviewing the remaining articles, and since this project has GAs under its scope, it would be beneficial if any of its members could review a few articles (perhaps your project's articles). Your project's members are likely to be more knowledgeable about your topic GAs then an outside reviewer. As a result, reviewing your project's articles would improve the quality of the review in ensuring that the article meets your project's concerns on sourcing, content, and guidelines. However, members can also review any other article in the worklist to ensure it meets the GA criteria.\n\nIf any members are interested, please visit the GA sweeps page for further details and instructions in initiating a review. If you'd like to join the process, please add your name to the running total page. In addition, for every member that reviews 100 articles from the worklist or has a significant impact on the process, s/he will get an award when they reach that threshold. With ~1,300 articles left to review, we would appreciate any editors that could contribute in helping to uphold the quality of GAs. If you have any questions about the process, reviewing, or need help with a particular article, please contact me or OhanaUnited and we'll be happy to help. --Happy editing! Nehrams2020 (talk • contrib)\n\nWould someone mind photographing the Hawaiian Airlines headquarters? They are at 3375 Koapaka Street, G-350, by Honolulu Airport. Thanks WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nThis discussion initially took place at Talk:Kahoolawe --BlueMoonlet (t/c)\n\nAn editor recently added a fact tag to the \"Target Isle\" name in the article. I am unclear as to why the tag was added, as this is an accepted, common name for the island, still in use by the media.[2] While it is true that the island is no longer used for this purpose, the naming convention in the infobox is accurate. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI am concerned that Wikipedia may play a role in conferring \"official status\" on a nickname. This is especially true when the nickname is listed in the infobox, rather than the text. In some cases, (e.g., the Big Island), the nickname is clearly so predominant that WP is simply affirming what is already true. But I am somewhat suspicious that every Hawaiian island has a nickname in its infobox. Why must each island have a nickname? Every U.S. state has a nickname, but those are semi-official. Is there some authority conferring at least semi-official status on one (and only one!) nickname for each Hawaiian island? If not, then I contend that at least some of these nicknames should be taken out of the infoboxes. --BlueMoonlet (t/c)\n\nI should add that the answer to my question may well be \"yes\". I don't know a great deal about Hawaii in particular; my concern is on general principle. --BlueMoonlet (t/c)\n\nBlueMoonlet, are you aware that in the United States, each state has a nickname? I'm assuming that you are. You will also find it in the infobox on every article about a U.S. state. Perhaps our Hawaiian Island infoboxes could use a similar format (smaller font) rather than the large font currently in use. Would that begin to address your concern? Viriditas (talk)\n\nYes, I am aware of that, which is why I mentioned it in my last post above. As I said, those nicknames are semi-official. Are you saying that the same is true of the nicknames for the Hawaiian islands? If so, you should be able to provide a much stronger reference than some journalist saying it was once called that. --BlueMoonlet (t/c)\n\nLet me see if I can address your concerns. You said that you were worried that Wikipedia was conferring some kind of official status on the nickname. Can you tell me, on what evidence do you base these concerns? Viriditas (talk)\n\nIt is well known that the general public gives way too much credence to what is written in Wikipedia. If something is only partly true or even completely untrue, its credibility can be greatly enhanced in the public mind if it is listed as true on Wikipedia. This enhances the importance of citing reliable sources for any piece of information that is significant and/or questionable. --BlueMoonlet (t/c)\n\nHere's a reference from a 1966 book hosted by the State of Hawaii Department of Transportation, Airports Division.[3] I'm still open to modifying the infobox or the article. However, the 1998 edition of the Atlas of Hawaii does not recognize the \"Target Isle\" as a name.[4] For the encyclopedia's sake, I think it is safe to add formerly next to \"Target Isle\" until we have a better solution in place. My guess it that the nickname hasn't been current since 1993. Viriditas (talk)\n\nThis is much more the kind of reference I was looking for. The table below compares the nicknames in these two editions of the Atlas with the nicknames currently given on WP pages. I think the 1998 atlas should be cited for the current nicknames of the five islands where they agree. Perversely, the most popularly known nickname (the \"Big Island\") is not given in the 1998 atlas. For Hawaii and Lanai, it appears that multiple nicknames are current, while we now seem to agree that Kahoolawe no longer has a nickname though its former nickname should probably be listed. Given these ambiguities, it might be best to move these nicknames down to an entry in the infoboxes, rather than below the name. Thoughts? --BlueMoonlet (t/c)\n\nIsland 1966 Atlas 1998 Atlas Wikipedia Hawaii Big Island The Orchid Isle The Big Island Kahoolawe Target Isle none The Target Isle Kauai Garden Isle The Garden Isle The Garden Isle Lanai none The Private Isle The Pineapple Isle or The Secluded Isle Maui Valley Isle The Valley Isle The Valley Isle Molokai Friendly Isle (formerly Lonely Isle) The Friendly Isle The Friendly Isle Niihau Island of Yesteryear The Forbidden Isle The Forbidden Isle Oahu none The Gathering Place The Gathering Place\n\nThe 1966 ref isn't to an atlas. It's just to a book on a historical aviation site maintained by the state. I agree with redesigning the infobox template and moving the nicknames down. I was planning to do it myself sometime ago, but got too busy with other things. With your permission, I would like to move this entire discussion (copy and paste) to WT:HAWAII so that the project members understand what we are doing and can comment if they so desire. Viriditas (talk)\n\nThat would be fine. --BlueMoonlet (t/c)\n\nDiscussion placed here for notification of impending changes to the infobox, and/or for continuing discussion on the subject. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI was asked to come here and write something about the islands of Hawaii and the countries of Hawaii. I maintain that the US State of Hawaii is composed of the counties of Hawaii. Each county has a government and has elections. Each county consists of land, in this case, one or more islands or parts of islands. It is NOT the other way around: the state of Hawaii composed of islands, which are composed of counties. These islands do not have government and elections. This information can be found in the government of Hawaii and government of each county articles. We need not look elsewhere to 'prove' this. Hmains (talk)\n\nCan you provide some context? I can't quite tell what the dispute is here. Politically, the state is divided into five counties (two of which consist of a single island); geographically, it's composed of islands. Maui County consists of Maui, Lānaʻi, and most of Molokaʻi; Kauaʻi County includes Niʻihau; and Kalawao County consists only of Kalaupapa and adjacent valleys. KarlM (talk)\n\nI made the previous comment before viewing your talk page; now I see what the issue is. Frankly, as I see it, categories are a complete waste of time for everyone concerned. I've never found them useful, in part because people make interminable numbers of levels (each of which often only has 10 or fewer articles). And there are enough people who are so thoroughly obsessed with creating them that it's pointless to fight them, so I've given up. If you want to make a grouping of articles useful, put it in a box at the bottom of the article (like the CDPs). KarlM (talk)\n\nCould someone go through Category:List-Class Hawaii articles and report back to the project on the best articles (most complete, ready or close to ready to be nominated for FL) they can find? Thanks. Viriditas (talk)\n\ncommons:Category:Hawaii needs sorters to go through each image and sort them into the appropriate categories. I'm currently working on just the Maui category, but we need lots of people to help complete the job for the other islands. Remember, many images aren't even found in the Hawaii categories, so if you focus on a specific area (Oahu for example) remember to also search for images outside the named categories. The advantage of sorting these images into the correct categories is that a {{Commonscat}} link can be added to each Wikipedia article, providing readers with a direct link to the topic-related images on Commons. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI've made a family tree of Hawaiian monarchs. It doesn't show much information, only how they are related to one another. If anyone could place it somewhere else and add links to it, that would be great.--Nathan M. Swan (talk)\n\nGood work, but it seems like Kaahumanu III is in a confusing place; the tree makes it look like she was the daughter of Kamehameha I, but according to her article she was his cousin, stepdaughter, and later wife; then later married Kamehameha II; and Lunalilo was her son by another marriage. Not sure how best to represent that on a tree! Seems like it would be best to put her as cousin, but that might add too many branches. KarlM (talk)\n\nWe could certainly use help on the monarch articles. It is a large effort. The problem is the graph is not even planar! For example, I am working on a Kepooʻkalani article: he is the double great-grandfather of the Kalakauas, not single as you note. An obvous issue with your simplified chart is that it does not distinguish men from women, showing only one parent. Also it confuses blood relationships with hanai (adoption), or ah, I see it hides the several Kaʻahumanus with easter-egg links. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nOK I published the Kepooʻkalani article. You are missing the generation of Kamanawa II -> Kapaʻakea for male line, or ʻAikanaka for female line. And as as KarlM says, the relationship of Lunalilo also is a bit more distant by blood. Her mother was one of the consorts of Kamehameha I but she was not his daguhter. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nA Military history WikiProject A-Class review for USS Hawaii (CB-3) is now open; all editors are invited to participate, and any input there would be appreciated! Thanks! —Ed (talk • majestic titan)\n\nIt would be a good idea to create a category on the Members of the Hawaii Territorial Legislature. The present categories involving the Hawaii State Legislature relate to the legislature since Hawaii was admitted to the union. Using these categories for a member of the Hawaiian Territorial Legislature would be inaccurate. I know Arizona has a category involving concerning the members of the Arizona Territorial Legislature. Thank you-RFD (talk)\n\nEspecially if you volunteer to put appropriate articles in the cat! Are there that many? You could make it a subcategory of Category:Members of the Hawaii Legislature perhaps. I have a similar problem with the Kingdom, right now they are just in a category Category:Hawaiian Kingdom politicians which might need refining. Similarly you could create a category \"Hawaii Territory politicians\" or something like that? Many overlap, e.g. territory and Kingdom, or territory and state, etc. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nI started a category for the Members of the Hawaii Territorial Legislature today. That will help. You still have the members of the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the Republic of Hawaii to do-Thank you=RFD (talk)\n\nI created a new template to list \"Hanai\" information in bioboxes. I noticed some had a paramter to the royalty infobox that was not used. I think it is important enough to put there. It probably begs for an article explaing more about hanai, and perhaps a list of notable ones. But one thing at a time. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nAt low resolutions they seem to find Oahu and Kauai, but the other islands nothing at all shows up for the \"topo\" views. For example, try with any of the topo choices and it is all blank. Does it work for anyone else? W Nowicki (talk)\n\nThe trails.com one works for that link, but it uses Topozone which is now a pay site, so it only gives you one chance to see a small portion of the map. KarlM (talk)\n\nFollow-up: after finally getting ni touch with someone from topozone, I got them to fix their topo maps. At least more of them work now. At various resolutions parts still disappear, but for free they are a decent resource.

Okip\n\nI thought that Charales Djou announced his intention in March \"2010\" to seek the office that Abercrombie has vacaated Cdauer (talk)\n\nIt states the the annexation of Hawaii was a victory but it was not. There are no annexation documents ever found up to present day. The congress had to vote to annex Hawaii but they did not ever receive enough votes to ofically annex Hawaii and today remains as land occupied by the United States and is not owned by the United States, but by the people of Hawaii. It also states that there were no casualties and only one wounded in the overthrowing of the kingdom which is definetly not true. Many natives lives were lost which led to the Queen surrendering in an act for peace and not to continue the violence. [comment above was added by User talk:Chasekale 09:36, 28 April 2010]\n\nThe situation is more subtle than that. See Newlands Resolution for example. That article could defintely use more beefing up with inline citations. It does gloss over the distinction between a \"treaty\" and \"resolution\". Not sure about the \"lives lost\"? Perhaps you mean during the counter-revolutions? Please provide reliable verifiable sources of course. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nI found this on Google Maps - Is this the headquarters of Hawaiian Airlines? WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nFYI, Advanced Technology Solar Telescope has been nominated for deletion. 76.66.193.224 (talk)\n\nThat's absurd. It has received a massive amount of media coverage.

Looking at the history, no one has bothered to expand it in the four years it's been there.Maile66 (talk)\n\nFile:Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Hawaii.svg\n\nI am confused as to why the coat of arms is not accurate. The Hawaiian warriors are depicted as cuacasion and the Kingly robes are missing to seemingly match the state seal (in my opinion...but who knows). Clearly the actual coat of arms as designed for the kingdom and placed all over the islands is not being ignored here is it? Can anyone help me out here?--Amadscientist (talk)\n\nMaybe you're looking at a fake. Hawaii Coat of Arms Maile66 (talk)\n\nIt is fake. The artwork the wikipedia article is using is wrong. That was my point. My link was to the proper and correct coat of arms. The same one you provided. My wording and link may have been badly worded. Here is the art work the current coat of arms is incorrectly derived from. [5]--Amadscientist (talk)\n\nThis talk page does not seem too active. Maybe you might want to take this up directly with a designated Administrator listed on Wikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Participants And when you do, it will be helpful if you insert the link of the Wikipedia page where this fake is located.\n\n--Maile66 (talk)\n\nWow....this incorrect coat of Arms appears to be linked directly to so many pages, listing one is not even neccesary. Also It is not needed to take this to an administrator. This is a simple matter to correct but will require a little looking to see where it may be properly used. This may be a simple matter of the incorrect image being used only because of the nice SVG. File. I am able to modify the SVG and have illustrated a coat of arms for another article from a different nation in SVG format. What I will do to start is look and see if the correct symbol is already on Wikimedia. If not I will create it and upload it to commons. Then, on an individual basis members here and in other projects or even individual editors will have the tools to work with. No rush, but it is something that needs to be addressed. Also, since the coat of Arms has been altered a number of times and the Kingdoms have differed in the long history of the nation....it may require a splitting of articles to indicate the seperate Kingdoms attributed to the different reigns and why and how they were seperate.--Amadscientist (talk)\n\nThanks for taking this on. Not sure what you mean by \"fake\" though? It is clearly a modern artist's reproduction, not provided by an official government nor a photo of a real historic coat of arms. The idea of an SVG file is that it scales down nicely (as well as up), so naturally has less detail than a photo would. Now if those 19th-century officials would jhave just used SVG for their emblems then we would be all set. :-) But now that you mention it, the caucasian features (and red beards?) are quite embarassing and do need to be fixed. And the text in the Seal of Hawaii of course needs to be fixed since it is not the 1843-era design that is being described. Looks like it is based on the ʻIolani Palace gates, e.g. File:Hawaiian Coat of Arms at Iolani Palace.jpg.\n\nI would vote for first having one good coat of arms to replace this one (probably based on the Kalakaua version which is best known), which would give a unifying look and feel. Then perhaps in an article discuss how it changed through the various reigns. And while you are at it, we have been talking about how confusing it is to have the same flag for the Kingdom as well as Territory and State used in the nav boxes. A \"royal standard\" type of image (e.g. a coat of arms, perhaps simplified in a flag-like aspect ratio) would work better to clearly illustrate the transition from Kingdom. And then another one for ancient Hawaii, e.g. just the crossed spears in the middle with green background or somesuch? W Nowicki (talk)\n\nI took the liberty of just adjusting the skin and hair colors to look less European. There are other issues too, like the Kapu sticks seem to be flowers, and the staff like a spear, in addition to the issues you point out. I am not an artist so hope someone else can do the hard work. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nFirst, thank you very much for the work. It is appreciated. \"Fake\" was used by another member that perhaps I had been looking at a \"Fake\" due the badly worded post I left. The \"fake\" I saw was the incorrectly illustrated coat of arms. The reason I would justify the very extreme description is that with the use her on wikipedia it is creating a \"fake\" search return....or incorrect. This is not an accusation that anyone did anything on purpose. LOL. No, simply that the various versions of the coat of arms and what few good images that may have been available when the image was first created probably contributed to the confusion. Not to mention the physical description in many references do not mention the robes but do go into great detail about the history of the emblem and all of it's meaning. Such as the two \"Chiefs\" that I believe were historical figures in Hawaiian history. Twins Kona Chiefs who had assisted Kamehameha I. Kame'eiamoku and Kamanawa.--Amadscientist (talk)\n\nI google the longest name in the world and discovered that there was a boy in Hawaii named Kananinoheaokuuhomeopuukaimanaalohilo, but I think Kualiilanipipililanioakaiakunuiakealuanuuokuiialiiikahalau is a longer name. I was wondering what is the meaning of the latter one and also is that actually an even longer Hawaiian name?--Queen Elizabeth II's Little Spy (talk)\n\nStarted the template {{Hawaiian Dictionaries}} for easy linking to http://wehewehe.org. --ThT (talk)\n\nThis was a very good idea. I have an expanded version of the template that handles a couple other databases I use for sources and gives full citations with links to authors and publishers. Unless anyone objects, I propose to merge in {{Hawaiian Dictionaries/sandbox}} soon. We can always tweak it later. One question is if it should really follow English language convention and use lower case for the second word, i.e. \"Hawaiian dictionaries\" or leave upper case since it is a \"title\" of a book? W Nowicki (talk)\n\n{{Hawaiian Dictionaries}} has been updated, and then I added some more tweaks and added much to the documentation. Time for more people to review, and please do give it a try. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nAloha, howzit? I've been looking for an article on the Hawaiian glyphs, like you see honu the turtle and triangular anthropomorphic glyph which decorate everything from jewelry to coffee mugs nowadays. I can't find anything, and there should be. I have tried everything under Hawaiian language I can find, does it have a peculiar name, am I missing it? I mean like the Rapa Nui Rongorongo script and so on. Help? Mahalo nui loa, Chris (クリス • フィッチ) (talk)\n\nThey are generally modern trademarks. Nobody has discovered a writing system for the ancient Hawaiian language (yet?). Many of the tourist logos are meant to look like petroglyphs, which ancient Hawaiians did leave. Their exact symbolism is being debated. Alas, much lost to history. American missionaries invented a writing system using a subset of the Latin alphabet plus two diacritical marks. That is why we should use the marks in the English Wikipedia: they are meant for English speakers. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nI got it, my father is a McKinley grad, I've been up on the language since I was little, and I didn't mention the diacritical marks (but thank you). I was really asking if we have an article on the glyphs here, and if not, let's jumpstart one.--Chris (クリス • フィッチ) (talk)\n\nI am stil not clear exactly what article you are proposing. Like any other, you need to have reliable third party sources. Just talking about your own observations will lead to deletion. Trademarks would run into copyright issues I would think. There is List of Hawaii state symbols which by its name implies only those endorsed officially by the government entity. The \"Live Aloha\" program might have some sources. Something like \"Petroglyphs of Hawaii\" would probably have some reliable sources, and be good, or start with some of the NRHP sites with petroglyphs. But something like \"Logos on Hawaii tourist souvenirs\" would be harder to justify. W Nowicki (talk)\n\npetroglyphs, which ancient Hawaiians did leave, as you said. Not the logos, though that may turn into a pesky \"in popular culture\" section.--Chris (クリス • フィッチ) (talk)\n\nI've been working hard on Mauna Kea for about a week now, and I've filled out the majority of the article ('xcept Summit observatories). However, I'm seeking confirmation here that I didn't miss anything. ResMar\n\nFYI, I have made the page List of Lepidoptera of Hawaii and most of the species. There are some species left to do, but most have an article. I would like to get it qualified for DYK, if someone is interested, the list needs some refs to qualify. I'm not very good at reffing, so any help would be appreciated. Thanks Ruigeroeland (talk)\n\nThanks, looks like you put in some good work on this. However, to qualify as DYK you also need 1500 characters of prose; the list entries do not count. As for references, listing the ones you actually used would be a good start. Or have you memorized this list? Aloha W Nowicki (talk)\n\nHmmm, 1500 would be hard, I will have a look at it later. Maybe I can pull some refs from the text I would need to add, because this whole list comes from two sources only, listed at the bottom with the external links. Anyway, thanks for your reply!

Articles were selected based on their assessed importance and quality, then article versions (revisionIDs) were chosen for trustworthiness (freedom from vandalism) using an adaptation of the WikiTrust algorithm.\n\nWe would like to ask you to review the Hawaii articles and revisionIDs we have chosen. Selected articles are marked with a diamond symbol (♦) to the right of each article, and this symbol links to the selected version of each article. If you believe we have included or excluded articles inappropriately, please contact us at Wikipedia talk:Version 0.8 with the details. You may wish to look at your WikiProject's articles with cleanup tags and try to improve any that need work; if you do, please give us the new revisionID at Wikipedia talk:Version 0.8. We would like to complete this consultation period by midnight UTC on Monday, October 11th.\n\nWe have greatly streamlined the process since the Version 0.7 release, so we aim to have the collection ready for distribution by the end of October, 2010. As a result, we are planning to distribute the collection much more widely, while continuing to work with groups such as One Laptop per Child and Wikipedia for Schools to extend the reach of Wikipedia worldwide. Please help us, with your WikiProject's feedback!\n\nFor the Wikipedia 1.0 editorial team, SelectionBot\n\nHi! I found:\n\nPark, Alice. \"Paradise Paradox: Why Life in Hawaii Leads to Early Death.\" TIME. September 22, 2010.\n\nThis is actually about mortality rates of Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians... WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nI am going to undertake cleaning up and code-ifying the front project page. Let's all admit it, it was a horrible mess =). I've only completed the front part at this point; more to come. Cheers, ResMar\n\nGreat idea long over due.Moxy (talk)\n\nSome time ago a fellow editor made a big improvement in changing the map on the Alaska article from an inset to one that shows Alaska's position in North America. Even though I suggested it, he did not change the one for Hawaii. If I had the expertise I would do it, but I don't. Maybe it can't be done? Here's the suggestion: why not change the map of Hawaii--the cream and red one at the upper right-hand side of the article that has Hawaii in the middle of Mexico--to one that shows Hawaii out in the Pacific, with the Pacific rim nations and states showing. --Yopienso (talk)\n\nI agree. I'll replace it with File:Hawaii Islands.PNG. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI tried, but {{Infobox U.S. state}} won't accept an imagewidth parameter. Looks like I'll have to shrink the image and upload a copy first. Viriditas (talk)\n\nOh, yay! Thanks for your efforts. Here's the diff from Alaska. All the states I checked have the same cream and red map, so the page may be set to accept only some variation of that? (I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about! It's astounding that I figured out how to edit text.) User:Weetoddid is still active if you care to confer with him. --Yopienso (talk)\n\nIt's the image width that's the problem. If you like Hawaii Islands.PNG as a replacement, it only needs to be shrunk to the same approximate width as the Alaska image, and it should be good to go. But to do that, you have to upload a new version under a new name. Viriditas (talk)\n\nAlas! I don't know what .PNG means and I don't know how to shrink anything but expensive wool sweaters. :P --Yopienso (talk)\n\nDone. No sweaters were harmed. : ) Viriditas (talk)\n\nNot done Reverted my own change. Scaled image looks like yuck. Viriditas (talk)\n\nThanks for trying! Maybe that's why Weetoddid didn't change it. --Yopienso (talk)\n\nUpdating the page for Neal Blaisdell. Scant information seems to be available online. So far, I find no online obituary on Neal Blaisdell, or anything to verify his accomplishments.\n\nPre-existing information on Mayor Blaisdell's Wiki page states he had a hall named after him at Punahou School. I am, at this point, unable to verify that. On Punahou's official web site, I do find a page on the Mayor's daughter Marilyn Blaisdell.\n\nI am particularly interested to find if his wife, Lucy Thurston, was a direct descendant of Hawaii missionaries Asa and Lucy Goodale Thurston.\n\nDoes anyone have any verifiable information to share on the Blaisdell page?\n\nMaile66 (talk)\n\nI added the link to his notable Hawaiian ancestor. Of course web searches turn up the sports venue, so you need to filter those out. People in this era are a bit hard: few current online sources, and not old enough to have off-copyright books. The family web site published a paragraph that I might add: http://www.blaisdell.org/BFNAFamousBlaisdellsNealS.Blaisdell7-27-2007.doc.pdf and see if I can at least tie the families together. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nThanks. I have noticed that when it comes to Hawaii, online resources are not as readily available as other geographical areas. I think part of what hinders a search is the merger of the Star-Bulletin and Advertiser, and the archives are not as easily accessed anymore. Along with the web itself, I had done searches on Google Books and Google News Archive - both are usually a bounty of ancient information. Like you say, Blaisdell Center is what shows up. As far as you know, is Lucy Thurston Blaisdell still alive? Maile66 (talk)\n\nThe problem is that these are not \"ancient\" people, so what I was trying to say is that the google books out of copyright from before 1923 are too early, and Internet-era sources are too late. I doubt Lucy is alive since according to \"Men and women of Hawaii: Volume 9\" snippet view on Google books, she was born in 1903 so would be 107 by now. It says her father was a Charles Henry Thurston, so not sure how he would connect to the other ones. I removed the stuff about a hall at Punahou, because it looks like it was being confused with the center where Punahou holds their graduation and some sporting events. Also added a few more sources that might help. Continue discussion on Talk:Neal Blaisdell W Nowicki (talk)\n\nSome ideas:\n\nIt's no longer clear whether or not the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands task force is still active. I don't think that a separate work-group for such a small area is really required, anyway.\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Assessment: The yellow box is super ugly =|\n\nWikipedia:Manual of Style (Hawaii-related articles) needs a copyedit, apparently.\n\nCe'd. Hope it helps. ResMar\n\nThere is overlap between Article requests and \"General\".\n\nGeneral was deleted, so complete. Viriditas (talk)\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/New articles - stale, again should also be merged into Article requests.\n\nRecommend striking this entry. New articles subpage is current with results provided by AlexNewArtBot. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI've stricken this entry as it is current (updated by a bot) and has nothing to do with article requests. New page patrol needs editors to review articles listed here on a weekly or daily basis and to assess as needed. I can help, but other editors should check this page daily if they have time. Viriditas (talk)\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Almanac - whould this not be better as a separate \"Outline of Hawaii\" article?\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Trivia - erm...maybe this should be posted onto the talk page instead? Kinda off topic.\n\nB-Class, FA-Class, NA-Class, etc. - what is this\n\nHawaii recent changes - last update was 2009.\n\nIn progress. Will strike when I'm done. Also need to add the recent changes feed to the bottom of the project page for easy viewing. Viriditas (talk)\n\nWatchlist update complete. Viriditas (talk)\n\nGeneology - almost certainly better as an article!\n\nPossibly, but this page is intended for use as a resource, along with a list of references, image help, etc. Viriditas (talk)\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Infoboxes - needs integration on the main page.\n\nList...categories - much better on the Portal.\n\nPossibly, I'll take a look, but again, this was intended as a resource page. If it duplicates the portal, then I agree we can delete it. Viriditas (talk)\n\nDistribution, News Bureau - put them together I think. Newsletter is at this point safely historical.\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Sandbox - basically a copy of the old page.\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/left panel, wow this looks old.\n\nBibliography - needs to get linked from the main page.\n\nAwards - does not need to be a separate page.\n\nYes, it could appear on just the outreach page. Is that what you mean? Viriditas (talk)\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Unreferenced BLPs - needs to be linked from the main page.\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Departments - never even used.\n\nOutline - should be a wiki article. See above also.\n\nCirculation list - no longer needed.\n\nIt's needed if AWB or a bot is going to deliver a newsletter again, so no need to delete. Viriditas (talk)\n\nRight Panel, Wikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/footer - no longer in use.\n\nI've marked several minimal, unused pages for deletion as well. Wow, what a mess. ResMar\n\nI was not sure of the history on many of those, but would certainly support a leaner set of pages that is more up to date. There already are articles on Outline of Hawaii and Index of Hawaii-related articles so the Outline and Trivia pages should just be deleted. Trivia seems to be unsourced from five years ago, so would need sourcing to go in today. Related is the Portal:Hawaii, which is also a bit out of date. For example, a while back I changed the portal to have only one list of DYKs in Portal:Hawaii/Did you know, not updated in six months, but there is another list here that is even more out of date. Maybe the list here should just be a link to that one, or transclusion in a scroll box or something. It is certainly misleading to talk about an assessment \"department\" since there are only a handful of editors on the project. I would call it an \"assessment guideline\" or something like that. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nIt's not a nomination or anything, so do feel free to strike things as you go. I certainly am too lazy to check back myself :) ResMar\n\nW Nowicki, your support is encouraging, but we need people to do the work. For example, since you enjoy DYK, maybe you could help monitor the new page bot feed and the assessment queue, and help identify Hawaii- related articles that would make good DYKs, and teach other editors how to do it. We currently have a backlog on both fronts. As for the name, it is not misleading. It's the standard name used by WikiProjects to provide a noticeboard where article assessment guidelines are located and where editors can go to request assessment. However, unless people are actively using these things, then you have a queue of articles building up needing assessment (new and tagged as unassessed) as we have now. We simply don't have the numbers to sustain a project, or enough editors willing to improve the set of articles that we have. DYK's are a great way to increase visibility, and to attract more editors, and are a good way to encourage stub expansion, but we have a core set of articles that need more attention, and they are anywhere from Start to B-Class, and probably not eligible for DYK due to their length. Right now, we need work on several fronts, including a resolution to the okina style guideline and a review of all the unresolved tasks on this page. Viriditas (talk)\n\nSo, whose going to be working on this? ResMar\n\nWe should sign off on them as we go. I'll start with my sig. Viriditas (talk)\n\nHere is a proposed addition to the WikiProject Hawaii image request page: \"In addition to requesting on here, elsewhere on the English Wikipedia, and on the Wikimedia Commons (Commons:Commons:Picture_requests/Requests/Asia#Japan), please also request one on the Japanese Wikipedia; because many Japanese are tourists in Hawaii, it may help to duplicate your request on the Japanese Wikipedia. If you know Japanese, state your request at ja:Wikipedia:画像提供依頼. If you do not know Japanese, state your request at ja:Wikipedia:Chatsubo and ask the participants for help on adding it to the Japanese Wikipedia's image request page. Members will help you with your requests.\"vv\n\nWhisperToMe (talk)\n\nIs there an image request page? The \"requests\" link goes to a page with only article requests; there's a category for image requests but no page. KarlM (talk)\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii has the link \"Requests—Article and image requests.\" under departments. There, it links to Wikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Article requests - There's also an outstanding photo request at Wikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii under \"Project tasks.\" WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nWhy don't set up something like this instead? Find good government and private copyleft/PD sites, make a list of ones to check, work this into a real section. I absolutely hate cluttered pages. ResMar\n\nSure thing! I'm happy to set a separate page like that. Here's a draft at User:WhisperToMe/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Hawaii/Images WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nBut those are all volcanics sites =) ResMar\n\nI removed ones that have no Hawaii related content. However, I agree that it is kind of volcano heavy. :) We need some more comprehensive links and/or links that have to do with Hawaii.\n\nLemme see if I can find any other repositories.\n\nWhisperToMe (talk)\n\nIt seems somewhat difficult to find large expansive PD photo collections of Hawaii.\n\nOf the photo links, which ones should be kept? Which ones should not be?\n\nAnd should I move the page from my user space to the Wikipedia space?\n\nWhisperToMe (talk)\n\nDo you have hawaii.gov? ResMar\n\nWell, does it have a public domain photo collection? If it does, I would be happy to include it.\n\nMost states copyright the contents of their websites, while the federal government does not.\n\nFor instance http://www.ehawaii.gov/dakine/docs/terms.html says:\n\n\"Duplication or use of any content from this WEB SITE for commercial purposes or in any manner likely to give the impression of official approval by the State of Hawai`i is prohibited. The WEB SITE Copyright © 1995-2010 State of Hawai`i.\"\n\nWhisperToMe (talk)\n\nWhich is why it's a pain in the ass so often. I like the \"image exchange\" idea, because with state projects, if you click around and contact the right members, they might just have photos they can put up. With more topical projects, it's decidedly harder. ResMar\n\nI have an idea - I'll add another entry to the \"Requests\" page: \"In addition, look through Category:Wikipedians in Hawaii and perhaps individually contact some editors who live on the island where your request is, and see if they are willing to photograph it\" WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nI moved the draft to Wikipedia:WikiProject Hawaii/Images WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nI found Kama'aina - If you guys don't think that it can be expanded into a real article, then it should be moved to the Wiktionary. WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nWell, it's a Hawaiian phrase. I'm not decided on this one (or even qualified to decide =) ) ResMar\n\nUser:MelanieN beefed up the article, so it's no longer a dicdef. WhisperToMe (talk)\n\n--Kumioko (talk)\n\nI have created together with Smallman12q a toolserver tool that shows a weekly-updated list of cleanup categories for WikiProjects, that can be used as a replacement for WolterBot and this WikiProject is among those that are already included (because it is a member of Category:WolterBot cleanup listing subscriptions). See the tool's wiki page, this project's listing in one big table or by categories and the index of WikiProjects. Svick (talk)\n\nI have started a conversation here about the possibility of combining some of the United States related WikiProject Banners into {{WikiProject United States}}. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions please take a moment and let me know. --Kumioko (talk)\n\nPosted a reply there. KarlM (talk)\n\nThank you I just responded. --Kumioko (talk)\n\nOn the page listing Wikipedia:WikiProject_Hawaii/Article requests, I notice a requested article for \"Elizabeth McHutcheson Sinclair\" On the Niihau page, it's spelled \"McHutchison\", including in the family tree template. In researching for possibly creating the requested page, I find it spelled both ways. Please advise which spelling is correct. Maile66 (talk)\n\nIt's a good question. You (or anyone else) are welcome to use the content and references located at User:Viriditas/Elizabeth McHutcheson Sinclair for guidance. FYI...I could use some help uploading her photograph. The only reason I didn't do it, was because I couldn't verify the provenance of the photograph. I discussed this some time ago at Wikipedia:Media copyright questions/Archive/2008/May#Public domain? so there is more information on the topic if anyone is interested. Viriditas (talk)\n\nThe link you had to the photo is now a dead link. I did find this Eliz-Sinclair Family album, which appears to be part of an online album of Sinclair family photos.Maile66 (talk)\n\nAlso look at the Aubrey Robinson page of course. I found both spellings, and the convention is to not decide which one is \"correct\" (unless there is a consensus, see Wilder article below) but mention both in the body. I would say title the article something like Elizabeth Sinclair or even Liza Sinclair if that is the most common name in reliable sources. Ithink she was not as notable before getting married, so change the name in the template too if it makes sense. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nsee Requested move. --ThT (talk)\n\nSamuel G. Wilder's middle name was Gardner, not Garner, therefore the article Samuel Garner Wilder is named improperly. Reference #2 (The Hawaiian Gazette: p. 6. July 31, 1888) plainly reads \"The Honorable Samuel Gardner Wilder died Saturday morning, July 28th...\" Patsobest (talk)\n\nOops, you are right. Not only that one but most of the other sources use the Gardner spelling. I found one or two dropping the \"d\" but went ahead and moved the article since those seem less reliable. Of course it needed to be spelled consistently in the body too. And the other articles that refer to him. No wonder he usually went by the middle initial—in hindsight, the article title probably should have been Samuel G. Wilder, but I do not have the power to do that move. Spelling in the body is more important IMO since the redirect will allow either one to be used in a search or link. Thanks for the good eyes. W Nowicki (talk)\n\nThere might be something strange (a technical problem?) left: Samuel Garner Wilder is a redirect to Samuel Gardner Wilder, but the page title shows still Samuel Garner Wilder (without the d). The talk page Talk:Samuel Gardner Wilder shows the right spelling instead. In the HTML source text of the article the spelling without d can be seen in the tags\n\n<title>\n\n<h1 id=\"firstHeading\" class=\"firstHeading\">\n\n<h2><span class=\"editsection\">\n\nand in other places as well. The [edit]-links are therefore not working. Maybe this should be reported to the technical staff, because the parsing is one of the core functions in MediaWiki as far as I know. --ThT (talk)\n\nSee Wikipedia:Reference desk/Computing#Article title shows wrong spelling. --ThT (talk)\n\nCasliber recently posted a suggestion on the talk page for WikiProject United States about getting the US Wikipedians Collaboration page going again in an effort to build up articles for GA through FA class. See Wikipedia:U.S. Wikipedians' notice board/USCOTM. After several days of work from him the page is up and ready for action. A few candidates have already been added for you to vote on or you can submit one using the directions provided.

Viriditas (talk)\n\nThe article Mahalo (linguistics) has been proposed for deletion because of the following concern:\n\nWP:NAD, and while the lead-section text hints at conditions that might make an article notable (as an example of a socially recognized concept lacking a corresponding word), that source of notability, if explicitly stated would be OR and supported, in the spirit of the quack-Hopi-linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf, only by inadmissible references, apparently attributable to amateur anthropologists & amateur linguists. In the other section, the uncategorized dump job list of \"Pop culture\" refs is useless trivia, not even distinguishing use in a setting-specific cultural context from idiosyncratic or show-off mannerisms, and probably should be completely removed even it the lead section managed to be improved to the point of establishing notability.\n\nWhile all contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, content or articles may be deleted for any of several reasons.\n\nYou may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your edit summary or on the article's talk page.\n\nPlease consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Removing {{proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the proposed deletion process, but other deletion processes exist. The speedy deletion process can result in deletion without discussion, and articles for deletion allows discussion to reach consensus for deletion.

This WikiProject aligns closely with the work of the GLAM-Wiki initiative (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums), a global community of volunteers who assist cultural institutions with sharing resources with Wikimedia. GLAM-Wiki US is a new community initiative focused on organizing cultural collaborations within the United States. GLAM organizations are diverse and span numerous topics, from libraries and art museums to science centers and historic sites. We currently have a backlog of interested institutions- and we need your help!\n\nAre you interested in helping with current or future GLAM projects? Join→ Online Volunteers\n\nWe hope you'll join the growing GLAM-Wiki community in the US. Thank you!\n\n-Lori Phillips (Talk), US Cultural Partnerships Coordinator\n\nFor more information visit→ The GLAM:US portal or GLAM-Wiki on Outreach\n\nWe currently have interest from the Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaii to begin a Wikipedia partnership and implement QRpedia codes. Please let me know if you are interested in assisting with this cooperation, either online or on-site. LoriLee (talk)\n\nIs there any interest in a 2012 Wiknic on Oahu?\n\nThis could take one of three forms: just a picnic, a picnic combined with an edit-a-thon, or a Wikipedia:Meetup.\n\nIf we do just a picnic, than an park or beach park could do. If we do a Wiknic / edit-a-thon combo, I suggest that we use one of our Hawaiʻi State Public Library System (HSPLS) branches that have a meeting room available on a Saturday and either are adjacent to a park or might have grounds that would accommodate a picnic if the branch would allow it. According to the \"HSPLS Home Page\" . Free wireless Internet access will be available in public libraries statewide beginning on Monday, April 2.\n\nBelow is information on the Oahu branches that have Saturday hours, meeting rooms / lanais, and possible picnic spots nearby:\n\nOahu branch Saturday hours Phone # Location Notes Aiea 10:00am - 5:00pm 483-7333 99-143 Moanalua Rd.

They all need work. -- Alan Liefting (talk - contribs)\n\nHello guys, I've made strides on Kīlauea, but it's an enormous pain in the tush to find references for. Sort of the reverse of what I'm used to, the pipeline seems to consist of either very detailed scientific reports, or very irrelevant tourist information. I've stuck to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory so far, but they don't cover recreation nor ecology, both of which are going to need to be added to the article. So, to make a long story short, could any of you guys help me out a bit with the sourcing? The really good French article uses the Atlas of Hawaii extensively for its ecology section, so if someone has that book on hand it would be really helpful. Thanks in advance! Hopefully.

I'm working on improving the article on Tulsi Gabbard, who's just been elected as Representative for Hawaii's second Congressional district. I am requesting your help sourcing more information about her political views, important dates in her life, analysis of why she won the Democratic primary over Hanneman, her small business, her religious practice, and a few other details. I don't live in Hawaii so I'm not as familiar with local media. More details are on the Tulsi Gabbard talk page. Any help you can give is appreciated. Thanks!

I thought that after that experience, I would relate that te stadards fr a FL are now harder and as such, I hve started to look at all county lists in the US. Can ANYONE here look at the List of counties in Hawaii and HELP me find a resource, a book, etc etc that would tell me more about how counties in Hawaii were named. Aditionally, looking at the founding dates, Honolulu is indeed 1907, BUT it was originally founded as another name in 1905. Can we add data that would communicate that on this list? I would be willing to help in any way possible. Thanks Coal town guy (talk)\n\nKawena Pukui, Mary; Elbert, Samuel H; Mookini, Esther T (1984) [1974]. Place names of Hawaii.

A recent discovery in my own family prompted an explosion of research by me on a number of figures. While doing this research it became apparent that some of our articles have a number of errors and are cutting themselves short by disregarding information available in, not only many other sources, but the sources that are being used already. I feel there is not enough balance in a number of articles and also seem to treat some information as absolute fact when the sources themselves do not. A recent discussion of title and styles of royalty has been very helpful and while many of the figures in Hawaiian history seem to be referred to as Prince, Princess etc., it seems that some explanation is in order to clarify the information. Seriously...one \"Princess\" was only called that as an honor by her supporters and while we can use such a title in the lead and article, it is showing bias and a lack of balance not to mention that they never received the title and style in any known decree.\n\nAnyway, while many of the people referred to with such titles and styles may not have been official, the consensus of the general community is that the title may b included if supported by a reliable source. I just believe that when the RS states that there is or were contradicting information, that should be included. This is not to re-write any history, but make sure such history is not being re-written out of a confusion of the facts.--Mark Miller (talk)\n\nThe takeover by the Committee of Safety in 1893 is most commonly referred to as the \"Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii\" Not the Revolution of 1893. This is a matter of the most common name which is the title of the article. For this reason I have altered a template. The only place I see this referred to as a \"revolution\" is by U.S. Special Commisioner James Blount in his interviews of important businessmen after the situation almost leading them to conclude this was a revolution inspired by sugar prices and the wrong doing of others that the Committee of Safety was acting to protect against.\n\n--Mark Miller (talk)\n\nJohn Mahiʻai Kāneakua. --Mark Miller (talk)\n\nI am starting a Honolulu Wikipedia Meetup group.
