        "text": "\"We're in the middle of a campaign!\"\n\nThis article or section is currently under construction, being reformatted, or undergoing a vast revision.\n\n“ I ... I didn't really know Patrick, so it was easy to just look the other way, I guess. But I did know you. And I'm sorry I wasn't there ... I see you now. I see you. ”\n\nLucas Charles Sinclair,[1] portrayed by Caleb McLaughlin, is a main character in Stranger Things. He is the best friend of Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, Will Byers, and Eleven. He is also the older brother of Erica Sinclair as well as the on-and-off boyfriend of Max Mayfield. He is a member of \"the Party\" and the Hellfire Club, and is a former player for the Hawkins Tigers.\n\nIn 1983, Lucas's best friend, Will, mysteriously went missing, he and his other friends, Mike and Dustin, made it their mission to find him. However, while searching for Will, they stumbled upon a mysterious girl named Eleven instead. Lucas was suspicious of Eleven's behavior and actions, and believed she was taking advantage of Mike's hospitality; he also doubted the apparent supernatural circumstances behind Will's disappearance. A rift grew between the kids, prompting Lucas to investigate Hawkins National Laboratory on his own; however, this only made Lucas realize that Eleven was trying to protect him and his friends from the threat of government agents, and the dangers that lurked within Hawkins Lab. Lucas reconciled with Eleven, Mike and Dustin, and helped his friends battle the Demogorgon. In the end, Lucas was reunited with Will and celebrated Christmas with his friends.\n\nIn 1984, Lucas and his friends became intrigued by Max Mayfield after her arrival in Hawkins; however, the group became more concerned about Will’s wellbeing after he started behaving unusually. While investigating the Upside Down’s incursion into Hawkins, Lucas and Max eventually developed feelings for each other, despite the threatening behavior of Max’s erratic stepbrother, Billy. Ultimately, Lucas, Max, Steve, Dustin, and Mike assisted in the Mind Flayer's defeat by burning a core part of the Upside Down's hive mind. One month later, Lucas attended Hawkins Middle's Snow Ball with his friends and began a romantic relationship with Max, as they danced and shared a kiss.\n\nBy the summer of 1985, Lucas and Max had gone through various cycles of dating, breaking up and getting back together again; in late June, Max ditched Lucas to hang out with Eleven instead, forcing the group to split up.[3][4] However, the Party's attention soon shifted to Max's stepbrother, Billy, who was noted to be acting unusually. The group later discovered that Billy and various other Hawkins residents were possessed by an incarnation of the Mind Flayer, prompting the Party and their allies to band together to defeat them. Lucas came up with the idea to use fireworks against the creature, which wounded the beast and distracted it long enough to prevent Eleven’s death. Three months later, Lucas said goodbye to Will and Eleven as they moved away from Hawkins, and agreed with Dustin to hand their Dungeons & Dragons set to Lucas's younger sister, Erica.\n\nBy the spring of 1986, Lucas had joined the Hawkins High basketball team, and his busy schedule got in the way of his time at the Hellfire Club, much to Dustin and Mike's frustration. Tired of being bullied, Lucas hoped that joining the basketball team would make him more popular. His relationship with Max had also fallen apart due to her social withdrawal following Billy's death, leaving Lucas worried about her, but she refused to open up to him.[4]\n\nAfter Jason Carver's girlfriend and various other students were mysteriously killed, Lucas slowly realized he had been hanging with the wrong crowd, unnerved by Jason’s scapegoating of Eddie and the Hellfire Club. Reuniting with his friends, Lucas learned an entity from the Upside Down named Vecna was responsible for the murders, and was using the psychic connection with his victims to open a series of new gates. While trying to stop Vecna, Lucas ended up in a deadly scuffle with Jason, who had tracked him and his friends to the Creel House. Though he ultimately overpowered Jason, he was powerless to stop Vecna’s psychic attack on Max, and the cataclysmic opening of four gigantic gates converging in downtown Hawkins. Max would ultimately survive Vecna's attack due to an intervention by Eleven; though Max remained comatose, Lucas deemed Eleven's actions to be \"a miracle\". In the days that followed, Lucas stayed by Max's side in hospital and read books to her. Later, Lucas and Erica watched in fear as the Upside Down's spores began falling across Hawkins.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWho portrays the character of Lucas Sinclair in Stranger Things?\n\nThe character of Lucas Sinclair in Stranger Things is portrayed by actor Caleb McLaughlin.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat is the relationship between Lucas Sinclair and Max Mayfield in Stranger Things?\n\nLucas Sinclair and Max Mayfield share a complex relationship in Stranger Things.

In 1975, Lucas' younger sister Erica was born. In 1976, Lucas befriended Mike Wheeler and Will Byers at kindergarten; the boys started playing Dungeons & Dragons together and formed \"the Party\".\n\nIn fourth grade, the boys befriended a new student named Dustin Henderson. Upon starting middle school, the three boys became the targets of bullies Troy Walsh and James Dante. The kids would soon form a great relationship with their science teacher, Scott Clarke, joining the AV Club he ran and taking part in the annual science fair. The boys won almost every year, except in 1982, which Mr. Clarke told the boys was \"totally political\".\n\n1983[]\n\nNovember[]\n\nThe campaign and Will's disappearance[]\n\nOn the evening of November 6, 1983, Lucas, Dustin, Mike, and Will played Dungeons & Dragons in Mike's basement. Mike, acting as Dungeon Master, summoned a Demogorgon, which ultimately defeated Will's character. While they looked for missing dice, Mike's mother Karen insisted it was time for his friends to leave; shortly after this, Lucas, Dustin and Will cycled home.\n\nThe next day, Will did not show up to school, which perplexed Lucas, Mike and Dustin. As they played with Mr. Clarke's newly delivered Heathkit, they were summoned by Principal Coleman to talk with Police Chief Hopper. Hopper confirmed to the boys that Will was missing, and asked about Will's way home the previous night.\n\nThe boys investigated their friend's disappearance that evening and accidentally encountered the escaped Eleven. Despite Lucas and Dustin's apprehension, Mike allowed the girl to stay in the Wheeler basement, making a pillow fort for her to sleep in.\n\nThe next day, Lucas and Dustin noticed Mike wasn't at school, since he was at home to accommodate El. After school, Dustin and Lucas came to Mike's house, discussing Eleven and what could have happened to Will. Lucas said that they should tell Karen about Eleven, but El used her telekinesis to prevent him from opening the door to leave. Later that evening, El attempted to explain Will's situation; she flipped their Dungeons & Dragons board upside down, on top of which she placed Will's player piece and then the Demogorgon piece. This gave Lucas, Mike and Dustin a vital clue as they continued to theorize about what happened to Will.\n\nLucas, Mike, Dustin, and El commenced \"Operation Mirkwood\", where El led them through the woods to find evidence relating to Will. They eventually arrived outside the Byers household, where El said Will was hiding. This statement confused the three boys. After seeing police cars race by, they followed in pursuit on their bikes. They saw what appeared to be Will's corpse being dragged out of the local quarry; this lead the boys to feel distraught and angry with Eleven, who they believed was lying.\n\nHowever, after El tampered with Mike's radio to project the sound of Will quietly singing, Mike decided to show this to Lucas and Dustin. Lucas angrily insisted that Will was dead, though Dustin half-entertained Mike's suggestion, and wondered if Will had become a ghost. After further discussion, the boys decided to bring El to the Heathkit to communicate with Will, which was much more powerful than the boy's Supercoms.\n\nAfter dressing Eleven in a pink dress and blonde wig, the boys brought her to the Middle School. Mr. Clarke told the group that they had to attend an assembly for Will's death before they could use the radio. During the assembly, the bully Troy made crude jokes about Will, which enraged Mike and lead him to shove him down after the assembly. Troy attempted to hit Mike back, but Eleven froze him in place and made him urinate on himself using biokinesis, much to the amusement of the boys and their classmates. They continued to the Heathkit. With El tapping into the device, they overheard Will talking to his mother through a temporary portal to the Upside Down - however the radio overheated and caught on fire. After returning to Mike's basement, the boys theorized that Will was stuck in the Vale of Shadows, a \"dark echo\" dimension of death and decay, which El labeled the Upside Down.\n\nAt Will's funeral, the boys discussed the possibility of alternate dimensions with Mr. Clarke. He described scientific ideas and concepts, utilizing the metaphor of the flea and the acrobat. He mentioned that a gate between dimensions would have adverse affects on the electromagnetic field in their dimension. Later that day, Dustin experimented with a compass, noticing that the needle did not point towards true north, and the boys guessed that there must be a gate nearby influencing the electromagnetic field, like Mr. Clarke had said.\n\nThe group followed their compasses, believing if they went \"North\", they would be lead to the Gate. However, Eleven was misdirecting the compasses for the boys' safety because she considered it too dangerous to enter the Upside Down. Upon circling back to the junkyard, the boys realized that El had been doing this, and argued about her; Mike was more sympathetic and trusted her, while Lucas was critical of her help. The two boys ended up fighting; Eleven used her powers to push Lucas off Mike and into the air, knocking him into a wall. This angered Mike and left El upset, who vanished from the scene.\n\nThe bad men[]\n\nA rift grew between Lucas and the two other boys, who continued to argue about Eleven. Lucas attempted to once again find the Gate while Mike and Dustin searched for El.\n\nLucas used his compass, following the needle. He eventually arrived at Hawkins National Laboratory; he was unable to pass the wire fence surrounding the laboratory. After climbing a tree, he used binoculars to watch over the laboratory grounds, and he saw that multiple vehicles were setting off towards the suburbs of Hawkins. Realizing Mike and Dustin could be endangered, Lucas informed his friends that \"the bad men are coming\". He climbed down from the tree and began to cycle as he continued to co-ordinate with his friends over radio, until they were cycling together through the suburbs. Eleven, who had been found by Mike and Dustin and riding on the back of Mike's bicycle, used her abilities to prevent them from harm.\n\nThe group returned to the junkyard, where Lucas, Mike and El reconciled. After they realized the laboratory was still looking for them, they hid in an abandoned bus. Chief Hopper found them, taking them to the Byers household to meet with Joyce, Jonathan and Nancy. Together they broke into the middle school, creating a makeshift sensory deprivation tank which El could use to enhance her psychic abilities. They learned that Will was alive, barely surviving in the Upside Down.\n\nWhile Hopper and Joyce infiltrated the laboratory and Nancy and Jonathan set a trap for the Monster, the four kids remained at the school.\n\nShowdown against the Monster[]\n\nAs part of an \"agreement\" with Dr. Brenner to gain passage through the Gate, Hopper revealed El and the boys' location to laboratory officials. Agents broke into the school, capturing El and the boys. Eleven killed most of the agents, crushing their brains and making them bleed to death, however, this \"drained\" her of energy and strength, causing her to collapse. Without her protection they were recaptured; but the Demogorgon, attracted by pools of blood spilling from dead bodies, burst through the school wall via a temporary portal.\n\nThe surviving agents were understandably distracted, releasing El and the boys, and they ran in panic to Mr Clarke's classroom with El to hide. Eventually, the Monster broke into the classroom and lumbered toward them. Lucas used his wrist rocket in a desperate attempt to fend it off, but then, El intervened, using biokinesis to pin the Monster against a wall, while also immobilizing Mike to prevent his intervention. El looked back at her friends, telling Mike goodbye before turning to face the Monster. She used her last remaining power to disintegrate the Monster, a process which appeared to make herself also disintegrate. The boys frantically looked for her in the classroom, but she was gone.\n\nLucas, Mike and Dustin were the first visitors aside from Jonathan and Joyce to see Will in hospital. They caught up with Will, telling him about the events which transpired in his absence.\n\nDecember[]\n\nOne month later, on Christmas Eve, the four boys once again played Dungeons & Dragons. This time, Mike summoned the Thessalhydra, but his friends' characters triumphed over the enemy.\n\n1984[]\n\nOctober[]\n\nMeeting Max[]\n\nOn October 29, Lucas, Dustin, Mike, and Will went to the Palace Arcade. When Dustin lost a game of Dragon's Lair, Lucas gloated about still having the top score. Dustin countered that he still had the top score in Centipede and Dig Dug, but Keith, an arcade employee, informed him that was no longer the case. Checking the scores, the boys discovered that an unknown person using the alias \"MADMAX\" had beaten Dustin's high scores. Keith stated he would tell them the identity of MADMAX in exchange for a date with Nancy, though Mike refused these conditions.\n\nIn Mr. Clarke's class the next morning, the boys witnessed a new student, named Max, arrive. Because of her name's similarity to the alias used at the arcade, they suspected she was MADMAX. As they were spying on her, they noticed her drop something in a trashcan. After retrieving the note, they discovered it had \"Stop spying on me creeps\" written on it, indicating she knew they were watching her. Lucas then watched Will get picked up by his mom to leave with his therapy sessions with the new head scientist of Hawkins Lab, Sam Owens while remarking how uncomfortable Will having to go there every time.\n\nAfter school, Dustin and Lucas waited in a parking lot near the arcade to see if Max would come and play at the arcade. With his binoculars, Lucas saw Max arrive at the arcade where she argued with somebody in the car before she gave the finger as the car drove off. Lucas and Dustin then followed her into the arcade and saw her playing a game at the arcade, coming to the conclusion that she was \"incredible\" and that she is \"MADMAX\".\n\nLater that night, as Lucas and Dustin rode their bikes home, Dustin tried to contact Mike that their suspicions about Max being \"MADMAX\", but Mike was not interested where he turned off his Supercom. When Dustin decided to invite Max into the Party, Lucas was worried about it as he knew Mike would not like the idea as he was still missing Eleven, but Lucas relented and said good night to Dustin.\n\nThe next day, the boys went to school dressed in their Ghostbusters costumes, only to discover that no one else had dressed up for Halloween. After debating on when to ask Max to go trick-or-treating with them, Lucas and Dustin decided to ask her after class. Once their class had ended, they approached and introduced themselves to Max. She wasn't pleased with the confrontation, calling them \"stalkers\", though they awkwardly attempted to reassure her they weren't stalking her. When they asked if she wanted to go trick-or-treating with them and invited her into the Party, she said it was very presumptuous of them to invite her. As Max walked away, Dustin informed her the time and location to meet them during Halloween while asking Lucas what the word \"presumptuous\" meant, but Lucas did not answer, thinking that Max had rejected their offer.\n\nLater, as Lucas rode his bike home with Dustin and Mike, Dustin had noticed a car speeding up towards them so Lucas and his friends tried to ride their bikes as fast they can until the car suddenly swerved to the other lane to avoid collision with the boys. As Lucas and his friends recovered, he and his friends saw that Max was in the car with her stepbrother, Billy Hargrove.\n\nThat night, as the boys were trick-or-treating, Max jumped out and scared them with her Michael Myers costume, making Lucas scream like a girl. She then joined them in their trick-or-treating, making Lucas overjoyed. As Lucas did trick-or-treating with Dustin and Max, Will suddenly had another \"episode\" of the Upside Down until he was found and lapsed out of it by Mike. As Lucas, Dustin, and Max rushed to see if Will was okay, they watched Mike take Will back to his house where Max asked Lucas and Dustin what was wrong with Will.\n\nNovember[]\n\nDustin's discovery[]\n\nThe next day at school, Lucas told Max the false story on how Will had gone missing in the woods and was believed to be dead last year due to a dead body of a boy that looked similar to Will being found in the Sattler Quarry. Though Max was not convinced of the story, Lucas assured her that it was true and told her to not ask Will about it as he is very sensitive about it, which Max agreed to.\n\nDuring Mr. Clarke's class, Dustin arrived late told Lucas, Mike, Will, and Max that they all have to meet at AV Club after class as he had something important to show them. When they all met at AV Club, Dustin showed a strange creature, which he had named D'Artagnan, or \"Dart\" for short. When Dustin handed Dart to Max, she was disgusted on how slimy he was that she handed the creature to Lucas, who described it to be a \"living booger.\" explained he had found it in his trashcan and that he believed the creature to be some sort of pollywog. Lucas thought Dart could be some kind of land pollywog when Dustin mentions that Dart does like water. When they noticed Dart starting to a strange growth where D'Artagnan shrieked upon being inspected under a lamp, Dustin also explains Dart hates the heat and concluded that he had discovered a new species. When the bell rang, Lucas suggested that he show the creature to Mr. Clarke.\n\nOnce school was over, Lucas joined Max and Dustin as the latter was about to present D'Artagnan to Mr. Clarke until Mike suddenly came in with Will, taking Dart, and told them that they needed to talk right now. The boys spoke in private in the AV Club room, locking Max outside as Mike and Will could not share what they had to reveal. Lucas and Dustin were surprised to hear Will had seen a creature that looked like Dart last year because he had vomited a slug sometime after he was rescued from the Upside Down last year and heard the same sound Dart makes last night during his episode. Mike proposed Will could have \"true sight,\" the ability to see into the ethereal plane, and theorized that Will's visions and episodes of the Upside Down could be real, leading Mike to reveal that Dart is in fact from the Upside Down. At this news, Lucas suggested they take Dart to Hopper, but Dustin rejected the idea as he refused to believe that Dart could be dangerous, despite coming from the Upside Down. When Dart started to screech demonically in Dustin's ghost trap, Lucas urged Dustin to open the trap where Dart came out and sprouted a pair of hind legs, horrifying and disgusting the boys. Mike then tried to attack Dart, but is stopped by Dustin, leading Dart escaped the room when Max unlocks and opens the door, prompting the group to split up to find Dart.\n\nAs the kids searched for Dart, Lucas kicked open a door to one classroom to see if Dart was inside, only to meet with a teacher. After making up an excuse of looking for study hall, Lucas continued his search for Dart. Lucas then received a transmission from Will, saying he found Dart in a bathroom, prompting Lucas, Dustin, Mike, and Max to head over to Will's location. When Lucas arrived to the bathroom with Mike and Max, they only saw Dustin who said he has not seen Dart, but they all manage to realize that Will has disappeared so they abandon the search for Dart and start looking around the school for Will. Lucas and Mike manage to find Will out on the P.E. field who's experiencing another \"episode\". Lucas watches in worry as Will's mom tries to wake him up until Will is suddenly brought back to reality. As Will and his mom, Joyce leave, Lucas and the others watched them go where Lucas noted that Will's \"episodes\" were getting worse.\n\nDivulging the truth[]\n\nThe following morning, Lucas, Mike, and Max – who had no knowledge of the creature's current location -- searched for Dart in a dumpster behind the school. Later, Mike explained to Dustin and Lucas that, on Halloween night, Will had a vision of a shadow-like creature. He then decided that they needed to catch Dart, since catching him could provide a vital clue on what was going on with Will.\n\nAfter school, Lucas approached Max at her locker, asking her if she's seen Dustin as they were suppose to meet after class, but to his surprise, Max ignored him and walked away. Lucas followed her as she started to leave the school, trying to recruit her in resuming the search for Dart, only to be coldly brushed off by her. When Lucas tried talking to Max, she angrily snapped at him where she revealed how she felt on being excluded from the Party due to them keeping secrets from her where they barely let her be a part of anything. Lucas told her he and his friends really do want her to be in the Party and though he could not tell her about last year's events, especially out in public, he tried to explain that there were reasons for their secretive behavior, saying it was keep Max safe. Though Max believed it was because her gender, Lucas denied that was the reason, but when Max asked if he and his friends kept secrets from Eleven, Lucas was shocked to hear Max knew a little bit about of Eleven. Despite this, he tried to reassure Max that the Party's involvement with Eleven was different without revealing more about her. However, Max's patience had reached its limit where she decided to quit being a member of the Party, leaving Lucas upset as he watched her angrily leave school. Once he saw Max leave, Lucas decided to head back to the school where he turned around to take one last look at Max, only to receive a glare from her stepbrother, Billy who had witnessed Lucas and Max's argument from the school parking lot.\n\nThe next day, while eating breakfast with his family, Lucas, thinking about his argument with Max, asked his father for advice, on how he makes up with his mother when she's mad at him. He responded that he first apologizes, then gets her whatever she wants. When Lucas asked his dad if he does that when his mom is wrong about something, his dad responds that his mom is never wrong about anything, which his mom agrees to. Realizing now how wrong he and his friends have been with keeping secrets from Max and excluding her on some stuff, Lucas decided to take his father's advice and make amends with Max. After excusing himself from the breakfast table, Lucas told his parents he's going to hang out with Dustin and rode on his bike, heading to the Palace Arcade as he knew Max would be there to play arcade games soon. Once he arrived at the arcade, he came up with a plan to speak to Max about last year's events in a private, safe place where no one could watch or listen to their conversation. Lucas enlisted Keith to help him by promising to get him a date which Keith agreed to.\n\nWith Keith's help, he made it so it appeared that the Dig Dug cabinet was out of order. Keith then led her to an employees only area, saying there was a functioning game there, but in reality it was part of Lucas's plan so they had a safe place to talk. Once Lucas was alone with Max, he told her he had decided to tell her what happened to him and his friends; thus giving the real reason why the Party was being secretive with her. After warning Max of the possibility of being arrested or killed if anyone found out what she learned, Lucas asked Max twice if she accepted those risks which she confirmed she did. With that said, Lucas confessed to Max everything that happened last year to him and his friends; from the true circumstances of Will's death to the Upside Down to the corruption of Hawkins Lab to the Demogorgon to Eleven and her powers before she disappeared.\n\nHowever, once Lucas finished his story, he discovered that Max did not believe him, thinking he was trying to impress her or was mentally insane, causing him to grow frustrated over the fact that he risked his life to explain top secret information, only for Max to think he was crazy. Following Max out of the arcade's back room, Lucas started to argue with Max, saying he had given her what she wanted, only for Max to dismiss it as a joke which he firmly stated he isn't joking with his story. When Max accused him of lying, Lucas countered there are rules within the Party where he stated the most important rule was that friends do not lie to each other no matter what. Unfortunately, Max did not buy it and revealed she knew that he tricked her into believing the Dig Dug was out of order. When Lucas defended his deception as a way to protect her, Max began blurting out everything Lucas told out loud in public. Lucas, fearing the agents from Hawkins Lab would be watching and listening to them, stopped Max from speaking any further and silently warned her to keep quiet as she could possibly get them both killed. This caused Max to realize that Lucas was being serious with his story, but when she asked for proof, Lucas sadly told her he can't show her any proof to confirm he was being truthful and that she just had to trust him. When Max's stepbrother arrived to pick her up, Lucas was warned by Max to not follow her out, but did not confirm to him if she believed his story or not. Once Max got into Billy's car and left, he watched her leave, feeling disappointed over Max still not believing him.\n\nThe creatures in the junkyard[]\n\nThe following day, when Lucas was retrieving one of the toys from his sister, he discovered that Dustin had been trying to contact him. He then contacted Dustin, who told him to meet him at the junkyard. Before heading there, he stopped by the Hargrove house to find Max, telling her he had proof that what he said was real. After sneaking out through her window, Max got on Lucas's bike and together they headed to the junkyard, meeting up with Dustin and Steve. Together, they fortified the abandoned bus and created a trap to lure in Dart.\n\nAs the group were waiting in the bus, they suddenly heard a screeching sound. The sound's source was revealed to\n\nbe Dart, who was joined by several other Demodogs. As the pack attacked the bus, they suddenly stopped, leaving the junkyard. Following the Demodogs, they realized they were heading to Hawkins Lab. Arriving at the lab, they discovered Nancy and Jonathan, who were looking for Mike and Will. They were all forced to wait outside the lab, due to the lab's power being out. Eventually, the power came back and the group was finally able to get passed the gates. They reunited with Joyce, Hopper, Mike, and Will, and together they all escaped the lab.\n\nAt the Byers' house, Lucas, Mike, Dustin, and Max speculated about the shadow monster's weakness. When they realized that the shadow monster controlled everything in a hive mind, they compared it to the Mind Flayer, a monster from Dungeons & Dragons that similarly controls the minds of its victims. They also speculated that, if they killed the Mind Flayer, they would kill everything it controlled. Mike then proposed that, in order to discover the Mind Flayer's weakness, they'd have to take Will someplace he couldn't recognize and try to get through to him. After making the backyard shed unrecognizable, they attempted to interrogate Will. While the Mind Flayer had taken over a majority of Will's mind and body, a part of Will managed to subconsciously signal to them in Morse code. Deciphering his message, they discovered the way to stop the Mind Flayer: closing the Gate. Soon after, the phone in the Byers' kitchen rang, giving away their location.\n\nReuniting with El and burning the tunnels[]\n\nAs the house was being surrounded by a pack of Demodogs, the group armed themselves with Lucas preparing his slingshot too. Before the pack could attack, however, Eleven, who was presumed to have been disintegrated, had surprisingly arrived and eradicated them. After some heartwarming reunion, together, the group came up with a plan: Joyce, Jonathan, and Nancy would exorcise the Mind Flayer from Will's body while Eleven and Hopper would go to the lab and close the gate.\n\nWhile waiting at the house, Lucas, Mike, Dustin, and Max decided they'd distract the Demodogs by burning the tunnels so Eleven and Hopper could safely reach the Gate. Before they could begin their plan, Billy arrived looking for Max. Billy attacks Lucas and threatens him to stay away from his stepsister, but Lucas fights back by kicking Billy in the groin. Before Billy could attack Lucas even further, Steve tries to intervene, but the two ended up in a fist fight, with Billy beating Steve repeatedly. With one of the syringes used to sedate Will, Max was able to puncture Billy's neck, making him lose consciousness. Using Billy's car, Max drove the group to the pumpkin patch where the entrance to the tunnels was located. Making their way to the hub, they doused the entire area in gasoline and set it ablaze. On their way out of the tunnels, the group encountered Dart. Recognizing Dustin, Dart did not attack and was easily distracted by Dustin giving it another Three Musketeers bar, allowing the group to escape. Lucas and his friends manage to escape the tunnels avoid the Demodogs who are proceeding to stop Eleven from closing the Gate. However, El manages to successfully close the Gate, causing light sources to glow extremely bright which Lucas and his friends witness when the headlights on Billy's car shine really bright.\n\nDecember[]\n\nThe Snow Ball[]\n\nOn December 15, Lucas was getting ready for the Snow Ball as he practiced on asking Max to dance with him in his bedroom in front of a mirror. Erica, who had been watching him, teased him which made an irritated Lucas close the door in her face. Lucas arrived at the Snow Ball along with Mike, Dustin, Will, and Max. There, he and Max shared a kiss as they danced.\n\nOn Christmas Day, at the Wheeler house, Lucas and Mike revealed they both told their parents that they would be spending Christmas at the Byers house without mentioning Eleven to them, with Mike saying his parents still believing El to be a Russian agent when they were interrogated by Dr. Brenner and his agents.\n\nThey were then picked up by Dustin and Steve and as they were on their ways to the Byers' house, they talked about Mike and Lucas's Christmas gifts to Max and El, with Lucas saying he had planned to meet with Max and give her his gift tomorrow. After insisting Max was not his girlfriend, Dustin suddenly freaked out and said he saw an unknown creature lurking in the woods, but Lucas, Mike, and Steve did not see anything so they decided to continue their route to the Byers' house.\n\nAfter arriving at the Byers' house, Lucas, Mike, and Dustin were met up with Hopper and El and were welcomed in by Joyce while Steve left as Joyce was mad at him for putting a dead Demodog in her refrigerator. Lucas, Mike, Will, and Dustin presented Eleven her present from all of them which was a walkie-talkie from Radio Shack that the gang had all saved their money for. Will and Jonathan then revealed that they had collected several Christmas specials in VCR form to help make Eleven's first Christmas celebration extra-special. The gang then took turns in explaining the plot of each VCR special to Eleven, with Lucas explaining the story of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Dustin then began to insist that there was a creature outside in the snow, referencing Dart, which left Eleven confused until Lucas and Will explained Dart and how Dustin kept him as a pet.\n\nEventually, Lucas and his friends decided to go out into the woods to find the creature. Shortly after, the gang found the creature which turned out to be a rabbit caught in a trap. After freeing the rabbit from the trap, Lucas and his friends decided to take it back to his house so they can help tend to his injuries. Once they got back to the house, Lucas and his friends watched Joyce attended to the rabbit and shortly after, they all sat down to watch the Christmas specials together.[5]\n\n1985[]\n\nAccording to one source, Lucas and the rest of the Party had an adventure in New York City in early 1985, where they encountered cyborg versions of Demodogs, the maniacial scientist Dr. Baxter Stockman and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nJune[]\n\nReuniting with Dustin[]\n\nOn the evening of June 28, 1985, Lucas, Max, and Will were waiting for Mike at the Starcourt Mall. When he finally arrived, the Party headed toward Scoops Ahoy where Lucas traded insults with his younger sister, Erica who was hanging out at the mall with her group of friends. When arriving at Scoops Ahoy, Steve helped them sneak into the cinema through the back doors to view an early screening of Day of the Dead. During the film, there was a sudden power outage across Hawkins, resulting in the entire mall losing power. The power then returned shortly after, allowing the Party to resume watching the film.\n\nRelationship Problems[]\n\nto be added\n\nJuly[]\n\nReturn of the Mind Flayer[]\n\nThe following morning, Lucas and Lucas were woken up by Will, dressed in his Will the Wise costume urging them to play a campaign of D&D where a baffled Lucas asked if he could take a shower. When they did not take the campaign seriously, Will became upset and stormed out. Lucas and Mike later followed him to the Byers house in order to apologize. When they finally found him next to the partially destroyed Castle Byers, Will announced that the Mind Flayer had returned.\n\nThe following morning, Lucas attempted to alert El and Max, but Max turned off her walkie-talkie, leaving Mike to call them by phone, urging them to head over due to a code red situation. Lucas tried to contact Dustin of the situation, but did not get any response from him Once the Party had assembled in the basement, Will proposed that the part of the Mind Flayer that had possessed him the year prior was still in their world and had attached itself to a new host. When El and Max relayed all that they had seen from Billy, they began to suspect he may be the new host. While spying on Billy at the Hawkins Community Pool, Mike came up with a plan to trap him in the sauna to confirm his status as a host. Lucas tried to apologize to Will for what had happened in Mike's basement but Will told him to forget about it as they should be more focused on Billy and the Mind Flayer.\n\nOnce the pool had closed and Billy was alone, the group enacted their plan, luring him into the sauna. Once he was trapped, the group looked on as Billy became more and more unstable due to the increasing heat and the Mind Flayer's influence. When Billy attacked Max after tricking into coming close to the sauna's door by crying and pleading for help, Lucas used his slingshot to stun Billy, saving Max. Once Billy was fully under the entity's control, he escaped the sauna and attacked Lucas and his friends. In the ensuing battle, El threw Billy through the wall, allowing his escape. After his escape, Lucas and his friends went to the Wheeler house to recover from their encounter with Billy.\n\nThe following day, Lucas, Max, Mike, El, and Will gathered in the Wheeler basement; they discovered that Hopper and Joyce were heading to Illinois through El’s abilities. When Nancy and Jonathan arrived and explained Doris Driscoll had exhibited behavior identical to Will’s when he had been possessed by the Mind Flayer at the same time as Billy’s sauna test, they concluded that Doris had also become \"Flayed\"-- a host to the Mind Flayer -- and suspected there were potentially several more. This led to the realization that Heather and her parents had also become hosts.\n\nArriving at the Holloway residence, they found nobody home, the atmosphere of the house to be cold, and that the inhabitants had consumed several household chemicals. After Will reminded everyone that he did not eat any chemicals when he was possessed last year, Lucas, along with Will and Mike, recounted a science lesson they learned from Mr. Clarke where chemicals could create new substances if mixed together. This to Mike believing that the Flayed could be making some kind of substance with the chemicals they were eating, but Max was doubtful as she knew chemicals could kill humans if they eat them, only for Lucas to note that the Flayed aren't dying from the chemicals due obviously not being human anymore. When they investigated further, they surmised that Heather’s parents had been attacked, tied up, and taken to an unknown location where they were flayed. Will then proposed that they use Driscoll to find the source--the location where the flaying was taking place.\n\nFinding the Flayed[]\n\nUpon arriving at Hawkins Memorial Hospital, Lucas and his friends were told only two visitors at a time were allowed to speak to Mrs. Driscoll, prompting Nancy and Jonathan to speak to the old woman first. While waiting for Nancy and Jonathan to speak to Mrs. Driscoll, Lucas and Mike tried to get some candy from a vending machine, only the machine to stop functioning, but El used her powers to help the boys get lots of candy. As they gather up the candy they received, Lucas proposed to Mike that they make up with their girlfriends, with him spending some time with Max while Mike spoke with El. Their approach worked as Lucas and Max played a game of catching M&Ms in the mouth while Mike and El sat together to make amends.\n\nHowever, as Lucas and his friends ate candy and read magazines, they noticed the lights in the hospital suddenly beginning to flicker where Will sensed that the Mind Flayer was at the hospital. This prompted Lucas and his friends to look for Nancy and Jonathan, using the stairs after finding the elevators don't work. Lucas and his friends were able to come to Nancy's rescue before she was killed by a monster made out of flesh and bone where El used her powers to fight it. When El pushed the creature out of a window, Lucas and his friends ran out of the hospital where they saw the creature's remains escape into a sewer.\n\nSeeing that the Mind Flayer was headed toward the cabin, on July 4, the group prepared for battle. In the assault, the Mind Flayer grabbed El by the leg with one of his tentacles. After Lucas freed El from the creature's grasp with an axe, El severed the Mind Flayer's head in half, temporarily incapacitating him and allowing the group to escape.\n\nThe group went to Bradley's Big Buy to dress El's wound and gather supplies. Lucas and Will went to look for a bowl at Max's request to fix El's wound, but could not find one. However, upon a firework display, Lucas and Will decided to take some fireworks in order to fight the creature, despite Max disagreeing with the idea. When Mike was contacted by Dustin, the group traveled to the mall where they arrived just in time to save the Scoops Troop from Russian soldiers. When El collapsed, it was revealed a piece of the Mind Flayer was still stuck under her skin. Using her powers, El managed to remove the piece. Just then, Hopper arrived along with Joyce and Murray.\n\nBattle of Starcourt Mall[]\n\nAfter Murray, Joyce and Hopper arrived, The Party explained the current situation to them and Scoops Troop, Lucas told Hopper that the Mind Flayer destroyed his cabin. Hopper subsequently instructed The Party, along with Nancy and Jonathan to drive to Murray's residence in Illinois, so they would be far away from all the commotion.\n\nAs they went to Nancy's car with Mike and Max carrying and injured and bleeding Eleven, Lucas realized the car would not start due to its missing ignition cable and then asked Nancy of the car's condition before he saw a Flayed Billy in his car, blockading their way out of the Mall's carpark. Because of this, the \"Griswold Family\" team were forced to retreat to the Mall where, then Mike attempted to contact the Scoops Troop for an emergency transportation, as they were trapped in the Mall's food court.\n\nLucas prepared himself and his wrist rocket, to fight Billy, and Nancy loaded the barrel of her Russian Makarov revolver before Jonathan realized, they could escape using the ignition cable from the car that Eleven telekinetically threw earlier. Lucas and the Griswold Family attempted to flip the car right side up, but to no avail. Eleven suggested she flip it with her powers, but Mike, who worried for her, as she lost a substantial quantity of blood and energy, said against it, but Eleven insisted that she could do it, however, her efforts were to no success as the car remained static, and so Mike suggested, they use \"physics\" to flip the car and successfully flipped the car and retrieved the ignition cable. Shortly after, Will neck-sensed the presence of the Mind Flayer. When Max, Mike and Eleven looked up to see the physical form of the Mind Flayer, Mike shouted to Nancy before he, Eleven and Max ran and hid behind a countertop, as Lucas and his allies hid behind the damaged car.\n\nWhen Dustin attempted to contact the Griswold family team through his SuperCom, the Mind Flayer grabbed it with its flesh thralls and roared loud into the walkie, before the creature threw it near Lucas, Will, Jonathan, and Nancy's hiding place with them hearing Dustin pleas for them to confirm their safety, and if they were en route to Murray's residence. However, when a noise was made near The Gap, it triggered the Mind Flayer to go there, thus, its attention was turned away from Lucas and the other three.\n\nWhen Lucas and Jonathan observed why the Mind Flayer was diverted to The Gap, they suspected Mike, El and Max grabbed its attention and were trapped, with the Mind Flayer using its spike-end tentacles, to search for the source of the noise. When Lucas saw this, he grabbed and loaded his wrist rocket with a rock before being inquired by Nancy of what he was doing to which Lucas responded \"Don't worry.\" to her and stood up, aimed and shot toward a balloon, which diverted the Mind Flayer's attention, saved the trio trapped in the Gap, and bought time for Mike, Eleven and Max to escape the Mall while Lucas and the other three fled back to Nancy's car through a back exit out of the Mall.\n\nLucas and Will entered in the car, while Jonathan inserted the new ignition cable into Nancy's car. While doing so, he, Nancy, Will, and Lucas saw that the Flayed Billy was revving the car and drove toward the car and Nancy who shot her revolver at Billy and tried to stop him, while Jonathan was trying to start the car's engine, but out of nowhere, Steve and Robin drove into and rammed the TODFTHR into Billy's car, changing his course and saving the Nancy and the trio, and saw Billy's car catching fire while Billy, himself remained unconscious.\n\nJonathan successfully started the car, drove them, Steve and Robin away from the Mall, and lured the Mind Flayer away from the Mall as well. The group, while being chased by the Mind Flayer and Lucas, overheard Dustin and Suzie Bingham singing \"Never Ending Story\", through SuperCom, before she told him the value of Planck's constant. However, the group noticed, the Mind Flayer has deviated its course, back to the Mall and Jonathan, which caused him to drive toward the Mind Flayer, and towards the Mall.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Mall's upper levels, they found Billy alive, awake and that Mind Flayer has captured and is attempting to kill Eleven. Before the Mind Flayer tried to kill her, Lucas threw a firework at it, and yelled at the Mind Flayer, \"Flay this, you ugly piece of shit!\", before he, Steve, Robin, Nancy, Jonathan and Will pelted it with the fireworks rockets which, Lucas had acquired at Bradley's Big Buy with Will.\n\nThe group rapidly pelting the creature with the firework rockets, until they ran out. After they ran out, the group saw Eleven, who empathized for Billy, who protected her from the Mind Flayer's sharp tentacle tongue, before he saw Billy being stabbed by Mind Flayer and then the Mind Flayer jerked uncontrollably, nearly hitting Steve and Robin before it collapsed to the ground and died. When medical and fire emergency services arrived, they secured Lucas and anyone else in Starcourt Mall.\n\nOctober[]\n\nFarewell to the Byers[]\n\nLucas helped the Byers pack their belongings and while doing so, he and Max, near a stack of cardboard boxes, mock-sing Dustin and Suzie's \"Never Ending Story\" song that they sang during the Battle of Starcourt Mall to Dustin, and when Max asks if they got a verse correct from the song, to which Dustin responded, \"Yeah, but you're butchering it, so could you please stop?\"\n\nThen Lucas said, \"So then join in, Dusty-bun.\", while blowing a mock air kiss to him to which Max supported, \"Yeah, come on, Dusty-bun, why don't you join us?\", and then Dustin says that, they are so funny, that they should be on Carson. Max pleaded that Dustin recite one verse, and Dustin, in a defensive manner, did not comply. This prompted Max and Lucas to continue imitating Never Ending Story before Dustin points and waves the middle finger at them.\n\nBefore the Byers left, Lucas hugged a crying Will, Joyce and Eleven before they were transported by U-Haul Trucks. Nancy, Mike, Dustin, Lucas and Max saw in sadness, as their friends were leaving Hawkins before they all departed to their homes by . Sometime later, Lucas and Dustin went to Erica's room where Dustin gave her the \"Donations\" box and opened it, showing a copy of Dungeons & Dragons Set 1: Basic Rules, sparking her interest in Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n1985-1986[]\n\nBy the season of autumn, Lucas entered high school with Mike, Dustin, and Max. Though Lucas joined the school's Dungeons & Dragons club, Hellfire Club led by repeated senior student, Eddie Munson, Lucas joined the school's basketball team as a benchwarmer due to his years of being bullied reached him to a point of desiring to be popular. Once he joined the team, he made friends with his fellow teammates such as Jason Carver and Patrick McKinney. Unfortunately, his decision to join the Hawkins High basketball team developed a strain on his friendships with Mike and Dustin as he could not participate in the Hellfire Club's campaigns as they sometimes interfered with his basketball games. In addition, Max broke up with him and isolated herself from him due to her still mourning for Billy's death, leaving Lucas concerned for her and her health.\n\n1986[]\n\nMarch[]\n\nA push for popularity[]\n\nAfter class, Lucas went to his locker where he spoke with his teammate, Patrick. As they talked, Lucas noticed Max walking by, listening to music on her walkman. The two shared a long meaningful stare, but did not say anything to each other as Max walked down to meet with the school counselor.\n\nLater, Lucas found Max, exiting out of Ms. Kelley's office and invited her to come watch the championship game by giving her a ticket. Knowing Max had never gone to any of his games, Lucas tried to convince to come to the championship game as it was important to him by stating she find something she \"find something she should care about.\" When his comment offended Max, Lucas eased it down by noting how isolated she had become now, comparing to her as a ghost. Lucas told Max he knew something was bothering her and denied their breakup was affecting her mental health. After Max simply stated she was now a different person, Lucas was given the ticket to the game back by Max, who wished him good luck before heading into the girls' restroom, leaving Lucas upset as he stood alone in the school's hallway.\n\nConflicting loyalties[]\n\nThe next morning, Lucas experienced his first hangover and puked in the bathroom of Benny's Burgers. When Jason checked up on him, Lucas told him he was good as he started to get better. When the police arrived, Lucas and his teammates waited outside while the new Police Chief Calvin Powell and his partner, Phil Callahan, questioned Jason inside. While waiting, Lucas grew worried as he believed the police would expose his teammates' hangout spot to his and their parents, but Patrick reassured him there was nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter waking up the next morning, Lucas noticed everyone at Benny's Burgers had left. When he walked outside, Lucas found Jason loading the back trunk of his car with Patrick and Andy's help. Asking his teammates what they were up to, Lucas grew nervous when Andy answered they were leaving to start hunting for Eddie. Lucas was gently reassured by Jason that they only wanted to find and talk with Eddie, getting him to admit his crime. Lucas was then told by Jason he did not have to join him in searching for Eddie while assuring he would still be considered a member of the basketball team whether he joined in on the search or not. However, Lucas, wanting to help Jason, decided to join his teammates in searching for Eddie anyway.\n\nLater that night, Lucas and his teammates arrived in the forest. Lucas heard Jason develop a plan to ambush Hopper's cabin, which had been abandoned since July 4th. Once they entered the cabin, Lucas watched his teammates start investigating the cabin and looking for Eddie. When Jason asked him if he was sure Eddie was hiding here, Lucas lied, saying he was positive. Once Jason, Patrick, and Andy decided to check the back of the cabin, Lucas stayed behind and immediately ran outside, leaving the cabin before starting to make his way to the high school.\n\nAfter biking for eight miles, an exhausted Lucas arrived at the school and met up with his friends as he had startled them once he had arrived at the school. Lucas apologized to his friends for scaring them and took a moment to catch his breath. When he was cooled off, Lucas informed his friends that they had a code red and told Dustin of his basketball teammates hunting for Eddie and were planning to go after him for knowing where Eddie was hiding. However, Dustin revealed they had bigger problems to worry about than Jason, turning his attention to Max. At this, Lucas learned that Eddie truly did not kill Chrissy as she was at his trailer buying drugs the night of death. Instead, she been murdered by an entity from the Upside Down known as \"Vecna\" and that he was now planning to kill Max as she had been suffering from symptoms of his curse for the past five days.\n\nDiscovering Vecna's Motives[]\n\nThe next morning, Lucas, Steve, and Robin were woken up by Nancy who told them they had to go to Victor Creel's house due to Max having drawn a picture of it as she had seen it in Vecna's minds cape while being cursed by the entity. Upon arriving at the abandoned Creel house, Lucas watched Steve and Nancy start removing the boarded up door with hammers they had brought. Unsure whether Vecna was inside the house or not, despite knowing it held some significance to Vecna, Lucas watched Steve and Nancy remove the board covering the front door before using a brick Robin had found to break the door's stained-glass window so they could get into the house.\n\nUpon entering the house, Lucas checked a nearby lamp to see if the electricity worked, only to find it didn't which left him and his friends to use flashlights in their investigation. At the start of their investigation, Lucas and his friends found an old grandfather clock in the hallway which Max recognized as the one she saw in her visions. When the gang decided to split up in groups of two, Lucas partnered himself with Max and joined her in searching the first floor of the house while Dustin, Steve, Nancy, and Robin investigated upstairs.\n\nThe next day, Lucas and his friends listened to the news of Patrick McKinney's murder at Lover's Lake, with Eddie once again accused of a crime that he did not commit. As they walked towards Skull Rock to reunite with the Hellfire Club leader, Lucas was saddened over Patrick's death where his gloomy expression was noticed by Max. He confessed of a day Patrick coming to practice with a black eye, only for him to lie about it. Lucas and Max understood Vecna selected his targets based on their emotional scars and Lucas began to profoundly apologize to his ex-girlfriend for not supporting her more as she grieved Billy's loss, only for Max to reassure him that she was the one who pulled away. At this, Lucas promised to remain by her side from that moment on.\n\nUpon finding Eddie at Skull Rock in the woods, he confirmed the time when Patrick was killed, which proved to be the exact same time when the flashlights in the Creel House exploded, allowing the group to realize Vecna was using the Upside Down version of the Creel mansion as his base of operations. With this information, Lucas proposed they kill Vecna by beheading him before Nancy pointed out they still do not have a way into the Upside Down. When Dustin's compass began going haywire, Lucas heard Dustin explain that strange electromagnetic activity was causing his compass to malfunction, which he revealed the possibility of a new gate being opened somewhere nearby. With this news, Lucas and the others started to venture deeper into the woods to find the gate.\n\nAfter the police took Lucas, Max, and Dustin to the Wheeler house, they were questioned what they were doing at Lover's Lake. The kids came up with a lie that they were going for a night swim at the lake and had just found out of the murder when they got there. When Mrs. Wheeler asked if Nancy was them, both Max and Dustin gave out different answers, causing them to say Nancy was with them, but left right when the police arrived. When Chief Powell asked if they had any contact with Eddie, Lucas, Max, and Dustin denied any involvement with Eddie. However, Erica saw through their lies and tried to expose, leaving things to get complicated between Max, Dustin, and Lucas, and their parents which Lucas tried to deny to his parents he was lying. As a result, Chief Powell decided to question the kids one at a time, starting with Max.\n\nIn the kitchen, Lucas and Dustin were brainstorming about finding a way to escape their parents and the authorities to rescue their allies in the Upside Down. The duo was caught by Erica, who demanded to know what was going on, threatening Lucas to tell Dustin about something really gross that she found under his bed. Reluctantly, they informed her of Vecna and his role in the recent series of murders before Lucas threatened Erica that he would smother her in her sleep if she dared to share this info with anyone, including their parents and especially her friend Tina. When Erica wondered how a gate was created in Lover's Lake, Dustin took the Sinclair siblings to an empty hall.\n\nDustin shared with the siblings that Vecna could be establishing psychic connections with each of his victims to create new gates to the Upside Down, similar to the connection created when Eleven made contact with the Demogorgon, which led to the opening of the \"Mothergate\". They deduced that Vecna had been using the Mind Flayer and the Demogorgon as his minions and he was the one who wanted to collide the two worlds.\n\nAs Dustin was wondering how they could reach Vecna's lair, Erica noticed the lights of the kitchen flickering on and off and wondered if it was coming from the monster. She and Dustin ultimately realized Nancy, Steve and the others were trying to communicate with them from the Upside Down and stole Holly's Lite-Brite to reach them. They agreed to meet in Eddie's trailer, where there was a gate that could be used for them to return to the real world. After Max was released from interrogation, the kids managed to escape their parents and the cops by taking the bikes stored in fhe Wheelers' garage.\n\nWhen both groups reached the Munson trailer in both the real world and the Upside Down, Lucas helped Dustin, Erica and Max in creating a rope by tying bed sheets together and all teenagers were surprised and awestruck when the rope proved to be able to hold itself. After Eddie and Robin successfully returned to the real world, Nancy became trapped in Vecna's curse. Despite their collective efforts, they were unable to find any kind of music to free Mike's older sister from the trance. Fortunately, Vecna elected to spare Nancy's life and gave her a disturbing message to deliver to her friends before sending her consciousness back to her body. Everyone retreated to the Mayfield family trailer and spent the night there.\n\nEarly in the morning, Lucas and the others were shocked to discover from Nancy that Vecna used to be Victor Creel's son Henry, who acquired psychokinetic abilities and used them to murder his mother and sister, leaving his father to be blamed for the murders, prior to becoming Martin Brenner's first child test subject as \"One\". Afterwards, Nancy divulged the details of the future the creature had in mind for Hawkins and the rest of the world, tearfully admitting seeing the lifeless bodies of her mother, her sister Holly and Mike. Steve attempted to comfort her and expressed his belief that those visions were fake but Nancy insisted those catastrophic events could still become reality and revealed that she had also witnessed four gates expanding throughout their hometown. Max and Lucas realized Vecna had been hinting at his plan to create four gates with his grandfather clock and the group realized the creature only needed one more victim to complete his plan.\n\nAfter their unsuccessful attempts to reach the Byers' home in California, Nancy insisted that the only way to ensure their safety and that of their loved ones was to return to the Upside Down to destroy Vecna. Lucas listened to Steve and Robin object to this, pointing out there was no way they could match Vecna in strength and power due to him being a test subject like Eleven. However, Lucas and Dustin deduced that like Eleven, the dark wizard's true body was vulnerable whenever he was attacking his victims in their minds and decided to attack him in the Creel House's attic within the Upside Down when he had placed his final victim under his curse. When Robin pointed out they could not predict who was going to be Vecna's final target, Max divulged that she still felt the creature's influence on her and offered herself as bait. Lucas became the first to oppose this idea and grew fearful for Max's life but she guaranteed that she would be alright as long as the others killed Vecna before he could kill her. Everyone was wary of this plan but they appeared to have no alternatives.\n\nEddie hot-wired his neighbors' van and allowed Steve to drive them to the War Zone, a store that contained all the weapons and equipment necessary to take down Vecna and his minions. During the trip, Lucas joined Max in the backseat and proposed returning to Ms. Kelley's office and check if any other student was experiencing symptoms of Vecna's curse but Max stopped him, insisting they would not put a random stranger at risk. She went on to reassure him that she was planning on hiding in her happiest memories, giving their friends enough time to find Vecna and attack his body. When Lucas asked if he was in the memory in which she was planning on hiding, Max smugly told him that it was possible that he was, allowing their relationship to experience another positive step.\n\nThough Nancy and the others were confronted by the increasingly-paranoid Jason and his basketball teammates, who were more determined than ever to kill Eddie, they managed to obtain all the supplies and drove off to an abandoned field, where they began preparing their weapons. Lucas and Erica were seen creating some spears and talked over Lucas' previous games, with Erica admitting that their parents forced her to watch his games, which did not convince Lucas as their parents could not force her to anything against her will. Erica told her brother that though he was a bench-riding loser, they were still family and she would always have his back. The Sinclair siblings finished the spears and briefly sparred with them until their friends completed their respective weapons.\n\nIn the sunset, Erica, Lucas and Max were dropped off at the Creel House and promptly entered it to begin their part of the plan to eliminate Vecna permanently.\n\nFighting Vecna and Jason[]\n\nThe Sinclair siblings and Max began searching for the creature's presence in the house in silence, using bug zappers to detect Vecna's presence and notepads to communicate. Erica managed to find him in the first floor and Lucas signaled that it was time to initiate Phase One, causing Erica to head to the playground outside. As they waited for Nancy, Steve and Robin to inform them that they had found the mansion in the Upside Down, Max expressed through her notepad that she was glad to have Lucas by her side, with the boy returning the feelings. He invited Max to the movies on Friday and much to his surprise, Max accepted by drawing herself and Lucas in the cinema. Shortly afterwards, they received Erica's flashlight signal that Nancy, Steve and Robin had reached the Upside Down Creel House. With Lucas signaling back, he communicated that he and Max were ready to initiate the second phase of the plan-- Max tricking Vecna into possessing her a second time. Though Max made herself vulnerable by removing her Walkman, the creature did not strike, leaving Max confused and increasingly frustrated. She and Lucas used the bug zapper to locate Vecna and it led them to the attic.\n\nRealizing her impatience was not helpful at all, Max decided to sit down and express her feelings and state of life since Billy's loss. She explained that Billy took advantage of any chance to humiliate her throughout their life together and confessed that there were certain times when she wished for him to die in a car accident. When he decided to make a change by protecting Eleven from the Mind Flayer's proxy form, Max admitted that she had felt uncertainty over whether he deserved to be saved and that was the reason why she did not try to save him. No matter how many times she tried, she could not forgive herself and admitted that there was a part of her that wanted to join Billy in death.\n\nWhen she was definitely and emotionally vulnerable, Lucas confronted her over wishing death upon her own stepbrother and ranted that perhaps it was for the greater good that she should be taken. However, Lucas quickly manifested Vecna's eyes and ominous voice, stating that he was glad that Max would be the final sacrifice that would break the world. It was quickly revealed that Vecna fell into the trap and placed Max under his curse once more. Upon confirming this, Lucas warned Erica that it was time to initiate Phase Three-- Dustin and Eddie would use the power of heavy metal to lure Vecna's Demobat minions away from the Creel House to ensure Nancy and the others could kill him without interference.\n\nA short while later, Lucas tried to signal Erica and became confused when he received no response. He heard footsteps behind him and discovered a confused Jason standing besides Max. Jason interrogated Lucas if he placed Max in this trance and if he, Eddie and the others had also done this to Chrissy. Jason held Lucas at gunpoint and forced him to empty his pockets before ordering him to wake Max up, to which Lucas refused as waking her up early could kill them all, which did not convince Jason. Lucas began explaining the existence of Vecna and the Upside Down and reassured Jason that Hellfire was not a cult. He inadvertently complicated things by bringing up Chrissy's willingness to buy drugs from Eddie, which greatly infuriated Jason. Despite Lucas' best efforts to explain that Chrissy and Patrick were affected by Vecna's curse, Jason believed his former teammate to be lying and adamantly insisted that Chrissy would have gone to him if she were having any issues. Jason expressed his regret over allowing Lucas join his team and the latter expressed his regret for knocking at the door in the first place, confessing that he joined the team to be popular like Jason. Much to his disappointment, Jason turned out to be a borderline psychopath, causing the basketball team's leader to reiterate his order of waking Max up. As he counted down from five, Lucas dodged a bullet and charged at him, causing a brawl between the two. Unfortunately, Jason accidentally crushes Max's Walkman under his foot, destroying Max's only lifeline to the real world, before giving Lucas a good beating.\n\nJason quickly gained the upperhand and pushed Lucas to a corner before beginning to strangle him. He was not aware that Max's body was levitating in the air and this sight gave Lucas the necessary strength to break free from Jason's hold and knock him out with a few blows to his face. Afterwards, Lucas could only watch in horror as Vecna broke Max's limbs one by one but just when everything seemed lost, Max suddenly dropped to the floor, only for Lucas to catch her in his arms. When Nancy, Steve and Robin attacked Vecna by setting him ablaze with Molotov cocktails and shooting him several times with a shotgun, his connection to his mindscape was broken, freeing Max from the trance, much to Lucas' relief and concern. A few minutes later, Erica managed to break through the lock of the attic's door and was horrified upon seeing her brother cradling Max's blind and mutilated body. Lucas begged his sister to call an ambulance and she bolted downstairs to do as she was told. Max expressed that she could not feel or see anything anymore and began sobbing that she was not ready to die. Lucas tried his best to comfort her and pleaded for her to remain with him, only for the pain to become too unbearable for Max and she finally succumbed to her injuries, leaving Lucas and Eleven, the latter of whom was standing by their side in the Void, heartbroken.\n\nTo make things worse, Max's demise completed Vecna's plan and a gate was soon created in the attic, forcing Lucas to drag Max's lifeless body away from the crack. The crack quickly gained momentum and expanded throughout the house, with Jason being bisected and killed by the dark energies of the crack, much to Lucas' horror. The gate continued moving forward and the other three gates from each murder site went through a similar process, causing vast amounts of death and destruction in Hawkins. The four gates eventually converged in Hawkins town square and the force of the collision created a powerful shockwave that knocked out the power in every residence. Lucas continued to hold his ex-girlfriend's lifeless body in silence until he heard her heart beating again. An ambulance arrived and Max was transported to the hospital, where she slipped into a comatose state.\n\nThe Beginning of the End[]\n\nNearly 48 hours later, Lucas was seen reading a story to Max until he received the visit of Mike, Will, Eleven, Nancy and Jonathan. Lucas embraced Mike, Will and Eleven, who tried to comfort him as they grieved over Max's current state. Sinclair admitted that the doctors were skeptical whether Max would ever wake up and believed it was a miracle she was still alive, despite her heart technically stopping for over a minute. Unbeknownst to him, Eleven had used her telekinesis to restart Max's heart. As Eleven held Max's hand, she secretly travelled to the Void in hopes of finding her best friend's consciousness, only to find nothing but emptiness, much to her horror. An hour or so later, Lucas and Erica saw through the window mysterious white spores descending from the sky, which enabled them to realize that Vecna and the rest of the Upside Down were beginning to take over their hometown, leaving them concerned.\n\nPersonality and Traits[]\n\nLucas kept his friend group grounded in the plausible and the pragmatic. Even during fantastical D&D campaigns, Lucas was hesitant when speculating about the more unlikely events and scenarios. He was initially wary of Eleven and her powers, which further displayed a hesitation towards the abnormal. His sustained realist approach, even during unfathomable situations, indicated that he took the task of finding Will incredibly seriously, and was determined to find him. Despite sometimes putting on a defensive and reactionary shell, Lucas was ultimately sweet-natured and had good interests at heart.\n\nIn 1984, Lucas's personality took much of a big change. He has come to accept the abnormal and what is different from others. Last year's events also seemed to have haunted Lucas such as when he explains it all to Max Mayfield, he feels those events happened yesterday and wished he wasn't serious about it. Lucas also became more open to others as he invited Max to join his circle of friends, told her of last year's events, and sympathized with her troubled family life.\n\nIn 1985, Lucas has grown to be more mature, especially when it comes to his relationship with Max. He's also able to admit his mistakes and make up for them. Lucas also is willing to give advice especially to Mike when the latter starts dealing in problems with his relationship with Eleven. When Lucas learned that Max and Eleven spied on him and Mike, Lucas, who was shocked and upset with this at first, quickly forgives the girls, showing his forgiving nature. Lucas is also shown to playfully tease his friends on their relationships with their girlfriends; teasing Mike on the time he spends with Eleven and mocking Dustin by singing \"NeverEnding Story\" which he heard when Dustin sang the song to his long-distant girlfriend, Suzie.\n\nIn 1986, when starting high school, Lucas desired to become popular due to enduring years of being bullied and treated like an outcast. This desire put a strain on his relationships with his friends and Max where he tried to offer them opportunities to become popular and come to his basketball games, even though they showed no interest in either of them. Lucas would even try to hide his nerdy habits from his basketball teammates in order to stay cool, which he would come to regret when he witnessed his team beat up the members of Corroded Coffin to reveal the location of Eddie Munson. Yet, despite being estranged from his friends, Lucas was still completely loyal to them as he tricked his basketball teammates by revealing the wrong location of Eddie's hideout in order to protect them. However, Lucas still considered his basketball teammates to be his friends where he was shocked and saddened by the death of Patrick McKinney and attempted to fruitlessly reason with Jason Carver before being horrified by the former's gruesome death. As Lucas helped the Party investigate and attempt to stop Vecna, Lucas reconciled with them and began to rekindle his relationship with Max where the two started to plan a date before Max was severely injured by Vecna, leaving Lucas devastated.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nSlingshot Proficiency: Lucas is shown to have skilled accuracy when using his Wrist-Rocket against treats and danger situations. When a Demogorgon came after him and his friends, Lucas tried using the slingshot against the Demogorgon, but it had no effect against the monster with three rocks being shot at it. After trapping Flayed Billy in the Sauna room, he quickly pulled out his slingshot and managed to hit him on the right side of the face point blank knocking him briefly unconscious to save his girlfriend, Max. He then shot at a Balloon to keep the Mind Flayer from finding and killing his friends which saved them from their doom.\n\nAxe Proficiency: He is able to wield an axe with great proficiency in brute power and destructive features to kill strong enemies, as he performed feats such as stopping large incoming objects to break through. He grabbed the axe Jonathan had to then use it to cut off the edge of the Mind Flayer’s tongue saving Eleven in the process.\n\nAthleticism: In his time of joining the basketball team, Lucas has possess great athletic skills that serve as a great not only on the field but also against threat or foes.\n\nPeak Physical Speed: Since becoming an athlete, his speed has demonstrated to allow him to move at above-average feats as he manages to outrun the team after misleading them to Hopper’s old Cabin and was able to quickly dodge a bullet at point-blank range.\n\nSkilled Hand-To-Hand Combat: While Lucas doesn’t know proficient fighting techniques, he is capable of holding against opponents with his own instincts in combat with his bare hands. As he wrestled with Mike before Eleven broke it up and kicked Billy in the gut after being pinned by him. He was even able to hold off Jason as when being held at gunpoint, Sinclair quickly dodges the gunshot to tackle him and deliver a couple of punches until he was briefly overpowered by him before getting strangled. Until watching Max being lifted by Vecna's curse, gave him the strength and advantage to obtain the upper hand escaping the choke and continue throwing repeated blows causing him scars to the point of getting knocked out.\n\nImmense Intelligence/Tactician Skills: As being the Ranger in the group, Lucas knows many ways of seeking enemy territories and obtaining knowledge to strategize to his friends of how to avoid the outcomes that treats could persuade them with. He followed his compass to Hawkins lab, climbed up a tree to use his binoculars to view company trucks and finds out that those who seemed like natural people around their neighborhood were government spies stalking them to get after Jane/Eleven but he warned Mike and Dustin to get on their bikes and escaped before they caught them. Then when he asked for advice from his father about how to calm a girl down, he choose to tell Max the truth about everything of the Upside Down, demogorgans, and the government spies in secret knowing that they wouldn’t allow them to live if they heard him spill it to which Max nearly did but managed to get away with it allowing both of them survival. Once Lucas and the others broke into the grocery store to help stitch up Eleven’s leg, Max ordered him to look for a bowl but instead found fireworks and Max doubted it and said that Eleven was the best solution to put a stop to the Mind Flayer, but Lucas himself pointed out that she would need backup in the case of her condition. When the Mind Flayer stop chasing the others in the car, it turned around to go after Eleven and attempted to have her killed until Lucas gathered all the explosives for him and the group to fire at the monster managing to weaken it along with saving her. Lucas is also able to understand how Vecna's gates opened during the events of 1986, himself and Dustin are two of many who were able to crack the code, outsmarting their older allies.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFamilial[]\n\nThanks to his father serving in the Vietnam War, Lucas learned a few tricks from his father about how to handle military gear, which he often brought with him to defend himself against any peril. Lucas also once secretly asked his father how to apologize to a girl, implying that Lucas and his father have a somewhat close relationship.\n\nLucas and his mother were shown to be very close, taking photos of him on the occasion of Halloween and the Snow Ball while also warning his sister not to make unpleasant remarks about him.\n\nLucas's sister Erica was a source of irritation to him as she constantly annoyed and mocked him, teasing his every action. In 1985, Lucas was shocked to see Erica at Starcourt Mall when coming to Dustin's rescue and that she had helped Dustin discover a secret Russian base, including the fact that Erica knows everything about the Upside Down and its monsters. Though Erica still annoyed Lucas, the two worked together in defeating the Mind Flayer and closing the Gate. Three months later, Lucas decided to give the Party's D&D set to Erica, which she gladly accepted, hinting that the two will form a better relationship in the future.\n\nIn 1986, Lucas had joined Hawkins Tigers' basketball team to gain a good reputation among his peers, which conflicted with his membership in the Hellfire Club and displeased its leader, Eddie Munson. Though Dungeons & Dragons was receiving a bad reputation for allegedly increasing Satanic worship, Erica agreed Mike and Dustin's request to fill in her brother's spot and ultimately won the game, just as Lucas had won the champiosnhip game. Erica was eventually filled in on Vecna and his murder spree throughout Hawkins and aided her brother and his friends in escaping from their parents and the authorities. She also joined Lucas in creating spears against Vecna and his fellow creatures from the Upside Down, telling her brother that though he was a \"bench-riding loser,\" they were still family and she was willing to help in whatever way possible. Lucas and Erica were confronted and attacked by a paranoid Jason Carver and his teammate Andy, preventing them from saving Max from Vecna's attack on her. Though they overpowered their opponents, the Sinclair siblings were devastated when Max passed away as a result of her injuries. Unbeknownst to them, Eleven used her abilities to restart Max's heart and the latter was transported to the hospital, where she remained in a coma. As they watched over Max, both Lucas and Erica witnessed the early stages of the Upside Down's incursion and looked at each other in concern.\n\nNon-Familial[]\n\nLucas and Mike lived next door to each other for their entire childhoods, quickly becoming best friends. However, this friendship was tested following the disappearance of Will and the arrival of Eleven. Mike was sympathetic towards Eleven and believed she could help find Will, while Lucas suspected that she was manipulating them in order to gain food and a bed. Mike and Lucas began to occasionally argue about Will and Eleven due to their differing opinions. This even broke out into a fully fledged fight, though Eleven brought the scuffle to an abrupt end. Mike and Lucas were on bad terms for a while, refusing to apologize to one another. Dustin suspected that Lucas was jealous that Mike's attention was primarily going towards Eleven. However, after Lucas realized that Eleven was only trying to protect them, he apologized and made up with both her and Mike.\n\nIn 1984, when playing at the Palace Arcade and trying to figure out the identity of \"MADMAX\", Lucas tried to urge Mike to give Keith a date with Nancy, which Mike refused. When Mike found out that Lucas, along with Dustin, had invited Max Mayfield (who was \"MADMAX\") into the Party without informing him, Mike was upset. However, he showed no hostility towards Lucas for it. When Mike worried for Eleven (after she revealed herself to alive) as she went with Hopper to close the Gate, Lucas tried his best to reassure him. When Billy Hargrove attacked Lucas, Mike was greatly concerned for him and once he was rescued by Steve, Mike embraced Lucas. After Max sedates Billy, Mike and Lucas, along with the rest of their friends, work together in burning the tunnels to distract the Demodogs.\n\nIn 1985, Mike and Lucas still remained close as both them now had girlfriends. However, after Jim Hopper complicated Mike's relationship with Eleven, Lucas gave Mike advice and sought to help him fix his relationship with Eleven. After Eleven broke up with Mike, Lucas did his best to comfort Mike. After discovering the Mind Flayer had returned and possessed Billy, Lucas wanted to burn the Mind Flayer out of Billy, but was told by Mike that they also needed to stop the Mind Flayer other than Billy. When Mike blurted out his love for Eleven, Lucas smiled at his friend's declaration of love. Both Lucas and Mike continued to work together in battling the Mind Flayer before the Gate was closed once again.\n\nIn 1986, the two remain close friends, but have to spend less time together as Lucas is on the basketball team. However, upon learning of Vecna's killing spree from Agents Ellen Stinson, Wallace, and Harmon, Mike grew worried for Lucas's safety and decided to return to Hawkins to save his friend. Upon returning to Hawkins, Mike and Lucas embraced and looked over a comatose Max together.\n\nLucas and Dustin generally get on well; they were sometimes unified in their doubt or disbelief when confronted with strange events and possibilities. However, due to their close friendship, they find no problem in making fun of one-another, but they know they'd be there for one another if needed. Dustin's antics would sometimes annoy Lucas. When both Lucas and Dustin developed crushes on Max Mayfield, they started competing for her affections. They both decided to invite Max into their Party, though Lucas, at first, knew that Mike was not going to like it. Their friendship started to grow colder when Dustin learned that Lucas told Max the events in 1983, despite agreeing to not tell her. When Lucas discovered that Dustin lied to him and the group about Dart and kept him, Lucas was angry with Dustin as the two got into a heated argument. However, they eventually made up and remained friends. When Lucas won Max's affections, Dustin showed no hostility towards Lucas.\n\nIn 1985, Lucas welcomed Dustin back from Camp Know Where, only to be sprayed by hairspray in the eyes by accident. When Lucas found out Dustin had a girlfriend, he was shocked, but did not believe in her existence. After coming to Dustin's rescue at Starcourt Mall, Lucas reconciled with Dustin as they and the rest of their friends shared a group hug. Later, Dustin was able to confirm his girlfriend's existence to Lucas during the final battle, as Lucas awkwardly listened to Dustin and his girlfriend Suzie singing \"Neverending Story\". However, three months later, Lucas, along with Max, would make fun of Dustin by singing the song much to Dustin's annoyance.\n\nIn 1986, the two remain close friends, but have to spend less time together as Lucas is on the basketball team. After Eddie became a likely suspect in the murder of Chrissy Cunningham, Lucas watched his teammates beat up the members of Corroded Coffin and became horrified when Gareth confessed Dustin might knew Eddie's location. Upon arriving at Dustin's house, Lucas managed to contact Dustin through Cerebro and was confused to hear that Eddie did not kill Chrissy, but was instead tried to save her. Despite his confusion, Lucas tricked his teammates into searching for Eddie at the wrong location before meeting Dustin and the rest of his allies at Hawkins High. Lucas warned Dustin of his teammates' manhunt for Eddie and the possible danger he was in, but Dustin was unconcerned, saying they had bigger problems to worry about. At this, Lucas learned that an entity known as \"Vecna\" was responsible for Chrissy's death and was now planning to kill Max. With this knowledge, Lucas and Dustin succeeded in saving Max and worked together in investigating Vecna. After discovering Vecna's true identity as Henry Creel and One, Lucas and Dustin used their knowledge and experience of Eleven's powers to formulate a plan to kill Vecna by attacking his physical body while he entered the mind of his next victim. Two days later, they both were sad with Max being in a state of comatose before witnessing the beginning of the Upside Down's invasion from their respective locations.\n\nAs with Mike, Will had met and become friends with Lucas from an early age. Like Dustin and Mike, Lucas was determined to find Will, but Lucas became tired of both Mike and Dustin's approaches to doing so. He saw Eleven's presence as a distraction from finding Will, and he did not accept Dustin's plea for them all to work together. He was devastated when he thought that Will was dead, but became determined to find him after Eleven revealed he was still alive. For a while, Lucas instead attempted to seek out Will on his own until he realize the dangers of the Upside Down and the corruptness of the Hawkins Lab agents. After Will had been rescued, Lucas, along with Mike and Dustin greeted Will and told him of what he missed while he was gone.\n\nIn 1984, after Will's rescue from the Upside Down, Lucas was always concerned for Will's well-being, which constantly annoyed him. When Will told Lucas of having visions in the Upside Down, Lucas was upset that Will did not tell him or Dustin earlier, but only told Mike. After Will was possessed by the Mind Flayer, he was saved when Lucas and the rest of their friends burned the underground tunnel system. A month later, Lucas and Will attended the Snow Ball and made fun of Dustin's hairstyle.\n\nA year later, in 1985, Will was upset that Lucas wanted to spend time with his girlfriend, Max. He tried to get Lucas and Mike to play a D&D campaign after the two started having relationship problems. But when the two showed they were still interested in reaching out to their girlfriends, instead of playing D&D, Will finally snapped and decided to leave, brushing Lucas off when he attempted to stop him. Lucas and Mike later went to Will's house and tried to apologize to him, only to find him outside Castle Byers, revealing the Mind Flayer's return. Lucas later tried to apologize again the next day as they prepared to test to see if Max's stepbrother, Billy Hargrove, was possessed by the Mind Flayer. However, Will brushed off Lucas's attempts, saying they should be more focused on Billy and the Mind Flayer. However, Lucas managed to reconcile with Will and the two exchanged smiles after hearing Mike confess his love for Eleven. Later, the two worked together in caring for an injured Eleven and battling the Mind Flayer with fireworks. After the Mind Flayer's defeat, three months later, Lucas says goodbye to Will before moving out of Hawkins.\n\nIn 1986, the two embraced when they are reunited in Hawkins and Will was saddened to find Max in a coma prior to hearing from Lucas that it was possible for Max to never wake up.\n\nLucas was initially suspicious of Eleven, dismissing her as a \"psycho\". Although Dustin and Mike made efforts to become friendlier, Lucas kept some distance from her, viewing her as a distraction from the search for Will. Eleven, lacking social skills and confidence, was unable to convince him that she was truly on their side. When Eleven was discovered to be manipulating the boys while they searched for the Gate, Lucas grew angry, accusing her of being traitorous. After Eleven ran away, Lucas had little interest in finding her. However, after Lucas realized that she was justified to keep the boys away from the dangerous forces at Hawkins Lab, his opinion of her changed. Following the kids' reunion, Eleven and Lucas apologized to one another, and remained friendly. A year after her apparent death, Lucas revealed that they reminisced about her when she was later found to be alive and reunited with them.\n\nIn 1985, Lucas and Eleven were shown to still be good friends with each other. The two would work together, along with their friends, in trying to stop the Mind Flayer who had returned to Hawkins. When Eleven was choked by Billy, Lucas was shocked and worried for her, showing he does care for her. After Lucas found out that Eleven and Max spied on him and Mike, Lucas was upset, but quickly forgave Eleven. During the fight at Hopper's Cabin, when the Mind Flayer grabbed Eleven by her leg, Lucas managed to save her by chopping off the Mind Flayer's tentacle with an axe. After retreating to Bradley's Big Buy, while taking care of Eleven, Lucas decided to steal some fireworks to help Eleven fight against the Mind Flayer's proxy. Lucas's decision proves to be good when he again manages to save Eleven by throwing the exploding fireworks at the Mind Flayer. After the Mind Flayer's defeat, three months later, Lucas said goodbye to Eleven as she left Hawkins with the Byers family.\n\nIn 1986, Eleven and Lucas embraced when they reunited in Hawkins and looked over a comatose Max in sadness and concern. Lucas remains oblivious of Eleven's role in Max's resurrection and believes that it was a miracle that brought Max back.\n\nLucas and his friends had a great relationship with their school science teacher, Mr. Clarke. He was more than willing to help the boys further their interest in science, even purchasing a ham radio for them.\n\nIn 1983, Lucas thought little of Steve, believing he was a douchebag and a bad influence on Mike's sister, Nancy Wheeler.\n\nIn 1984 Lucas was surprised when Dustin was working with Steve when no one else was around. Lucas Steve Dustin and Max all worked together in setting up a trap for Dart. Later Steve offered to look after Mike Lucas Max and Dustin but when Billy arrived and attacked Lucas Steve interfered and helped him before getting beat up by him. Later the crew went into the tunnels to draw the Demodog's away from Gate.\n\nIn 1985, Lucas and his friends went to Steve to help them sneak into the movies so they could watch Day of the Dead. Later, Lucas came to Steve's rescue before he, Dustin, Erica, and Robin before they along with the rest of the crew helped defeat The Mind Flayer at Starcourt Mall.\n\nIn 1986, Lucas and Steve were good friends as Steve attended Lucas's basketball game and cheers when he managed to shot a basket, allowing Hawkins High to win the national championship game. Later, while investigating Vecna, both Lucas and Steve shared the same confusion of how Vecna existed in the 1950s, along with questioning how and why Vecna attacked the Creel family and returned thirty years later to kill traumatized teenagers. After discovering Vecna's true identity and motives, Lucas and Steve, along with the rest of their friends, worked together to try and defeat Vecna and save Hawkins.\n\nWhen Lucas and his friends, along with his entire class, was introduced to Max Mayfield by Mr. Clarke, Lucas and his friends grew curious of her and her name as someone named \"MADMAX\" had beaten Dustin's high score on Dig Dug at the Palace Arcade. As Lucas and his friends watched her, Max had noticed them and left them a note saying \"Stop Spying On Me! Creeps!\" Later, Lucas and Dustin find Max being dropped off at the arcade and playing Dig Dug and realize that she is \"MADMAX.\" As a result, Lucas, along with Dustin, becomes infatuated with Max. Lucas and Dustin invite Max to come trick-or-treating with them without consulting Mike, but when it seems like Max doesn't accept their invitation, Lucas looks disappointed. However, when Max appears and joins in on trick-or-treating at Loch Nora, Lucas looked overjoyed. Despite agreeing with his friends to not tell Max about the events and the true circumstances of Will's disappearance in 1983, Lucas seemed bothered when they did not include her as they discussed the possibility of D'Artagnan being related to the Upside Down.\n\nAfter D'Artagnan escaped and Max confronted Mike about his behavior towards her, Lucas offered Max to help them for the creature, but she refused as she angrily told him how she was tired of being excluded from the party. Lucas tried to explain they didn't mean it and that there were secrets they couldn't tell her, but Max stormed off to meet her stepbrother.\n\nAfter secretly getting some advice from his father on how to apologize to a girl, Lucas decided to meet Max at the arcade and tell her all of last year's events, including the Demogorgon and Eleven. However, after Lucas told her, Max did not believe him and even when he stopped her from speaking about it out loud, she still didn't believe him, asking for proof which Lucas sadly says that he can't. Before leaving the arcade with her stepbrother, Max takes Lucas's hand and tells him not to follow as he asks if she does believe him and watches her go.\n\nLater, Lucas goes to pick up Max at her house to show her that what he told her was real after hearing from Dustin about D'Artagnan being an adolescent Demogorgon. As they waited in the junkyard, Max explained how's she's affected by her parent's divorce, her mother's remarriage, and her stepbrother's abuse as she apologizes to Lucas for her behavior. Lucas cheers her up by saying how he admires her, doesn't compare to Billy, and how he enjoys talking to her, which Max responds she enjoys talking to him as well. After seeing a Demogorgon in the fifth stage of its life cycle up close, Lucas and Max hold hands before letting go and Max apologizes to Lucas for not believing him.\n\nLater, when Billy finds Max at the Byers house, he attacks Lucas as Max watches in horror. As Billy beats up Steve, Max goes up to stand up to her brother as Lucas watches with worry, but he becomes shocked as she threatens and orders him to leave her and her friends alone. As they go to the pumpkin patch to burn the tunnels, Lucas helps Max on how to get there and they aid each other as they, along with their friends, burn the tunnels. A month later, on December 15, Lucas, Max, and their friends attend the Snow Ball. Lucas asks Max to dance with him which she accepts. As they dance, Lucas and Max share a kiss and embrace, thus beginning a romantic relationship with each other.\n\nDespite this, their relationship has been somewhat rocky, with Lucas claiming they have broken up and gotten back together at least five times by the summer of 1985. On June 30, Max, Lucas, Will, Mike, and El surprise Dustin, welcoming home from being a month away at camp. However, they unintentionally scare him into believing there are intruders in his home and Dustin accidentally sprays Lucas in the face with hairspray. While Max helps Lucas clean out his eyes, he comments on a new zit on her forehead, causing her to shove his face back into the sink and get water in his face. While hiking to get into contact with Dustin's girlfriend, Suzie, Max scolds Lucas for drinking all of their water. Later that evening, when Lucas comments that no girl is that perfect after hearing Dustin describing Suzie as \"hotter than Phoebe Cates\", Max annoyingly asks if that's so. He then nervously states that she is perfect, only for Max to say she's joking and she is \"obviously perfect\".\n\nWhen Max and El found Lucas with Mike at Starcourt Mall, Lucas supported Mike in lying to the girls, only for his relationship with Max to become rocky once again where he was silently dumped by her for helping Mike lie. Afterward, Lucas sought to make amends with Max and fix their relationship.\n\nHowever, she and El settle their differences and work together with Mike, Lucas, and Will to see if Billy has been Flayed. When Billy breaks the window to the sauna room with broken concrete, he lunges at Max, but Lucas uses his slingshot to rescue her and shields her when Billy breaks out of the sauna.\n\nAt the hospital, Lucas distracts Max in order for Mike to make amends with El. Lucas aims candy into Max's mouth as a game and two are heard laughing, possibly starting to reconcile. When Lucas found out that Max and El spied on him and Mike, Lucas was angry, but quickly forgave Max. While scavenging for supplies at Bradley's Big Buy, Max was less than supportive of Lucas' plan to stop the Mind Flayer using fireworks, much to his annoyance. Three months later, the two appear to be once again back together, teasing Dustin together by singing the theme song for \"The Neverending Story\". That afternoon, they lean on one another sadly as they watch El and the Byers move out of Hawkins.\n\nSometime in between 1986, Max broke up with Lucas, due to her being increasingly distant after the death of her stepbrother Billy Hargrove. Despite this, Lucas still had feelings for her while remaining friends with her, even though Max doesn't say much. Before spring break, Lucas gave Max a ticket to his basketball championship game, in the hopes she would come, despite her never showing any interest in watching his games. When Lucas pointed how reclusive Max has grown ever since Billy's death, he denied their breakup being the reason and listened to her just brush off that she is now a different person before she gave the game ticket back to him, leaving Lucas hurt. After learning of the true cause of a murder spree in Hawkins, Lucas expressed his worry for Max when she becomes targeted by Vecna. Max decided to write letters to everyone in her life, as a way of saying all the things she could never say out loud. When she gave Lucas his letter, he admitted that he does not want the letter, and that he was there for Max. He told her that he cared about her and wanted to talk to her about her traumas, but she just ignored him. When Max comes back from being cursed by Vecna, she cried in Lucas' arms and when he expressed how worried he was, she assured him that she was still with him.\n\nWhile continuing to investigate Vecna, Lucas and Max started to rebuild their relationship, showing they still had romantic feelings for one another. After the death of Lucas's basketball teammate Patrick McKinney, he was consoled by Max and when he tried to apologize for not helping her, she tried to assure him it was not his fault, but he insisted it was his fault for not being there for Max during her depression while he was becoming popular, causing Max to accept his apology.\n\nOnce the Party and their allies came up with a plan to take down Vecna once and for all, Lucas refused to allow Max be the bait but she reassured him that it was okay and she could survive the creature's curse once again. Before carrying out the plan while inside the Creel House, Lucas and Max told each other how happy they were to be in each other's presence and when Lucas asked if she wanted to go see a movie with him, Max accepted his invitation, showing the two restoring their relationship. However while Lucas was waiting to move forward with the plan, Jason Carver interrupted, fighting him. Shortly af"
