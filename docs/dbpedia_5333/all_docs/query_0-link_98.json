She has received various accolades, including an Academy Award, four BAFTA Awards, two Emmy Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards.\n\nA graduate of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, Colman's breakthrough came in the Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show (2003–2015).

Her other television credits include Les Misérables (2019), Landscapers (2021), and Heartstopper (2022–2023).\n\nFor her portrayal of Anne, Queen of Great Britain in the period black-comedy film The Favourite (2018), Colman won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She received further Academy Award nominations for her performances in the dramas The Father (2020) and The Lost Daughter (2021). Her other notable film credits include Tyrannosaur (2011), The Iron Lady (2011), Hyde Park on Hudson (2012), Locke (2013), The Lobster (2015), Empire of Light (2022), Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022), and Wonka (2023).\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nColman was born in Norwich on 30 January 1974,[4][5] the daughter of nurse Mary (née Leakey) and chartered surveyor Keith Colman.[6][7] Olivia's great-great-great-grandmother, Harriot Bazett was born in Kishanganj in India in 1807.[8][9][10]\n\nOlivia was privately educated at Norwich High School for Girls and Gresham's School in Holt, Norfolk. Colman's first role was Jean Brodie in a school production of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie at age 16.[11] She cites her mother's interrupted career as a ballet dancer as an inspiration to pursue acting professionally.[12] Colman spent a term studying primary education at Homerton College, Cambridge before studying drama at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, from which she graduated in 1999.[13] During her time at Cambridge, she appeared in the Channel 4 series The Word in 1995 under her nickname \"Colly\",[14] auditioned for the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club and met future co-stars David Mitchell and Robert Webb.[2][13][15][16]\n\nColman had to adopt a different stage name when she began working professionally because Equity (the UK actors' union) already had an actress named Sarah Colman. \"One of my best friends at university was called Olivia and I always loved her name,\" Colman told The Independent in 2013. \"I was never Sarah; I was always called by my nickname, Colly, so it didn't seem so awful not to be called Sarah.\"[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n2000s: Early work on television\n\n[edit]\n\nColman made her professional acting debut in 2000 at age 26 as part of the BBC Two comedy sketch show, Bruiser. She has appeared in a number of BBC, ITV and Channel 4 television series, such as People Like Us, Look Around You, Black Books, The Office and The Time of Your Life. Colman provided the voice-over for Channel 5's poll for Britain's Funniest Comedy Character.\n\nShe regularly appeared on BBC Radio 4 comedies, such as Concrete Cow, Think the Unthinkable, The House of Milton Jones and Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. Colman was the voice of Minka, the Polish secretary in the Radio 4 comedy Hut 33 set in a fictional code-breaking hut at Bletchley Park during World War II.[17] Colman appeared as Bev, with Mark Burdis as Kev, in a series of television advertisements for AA car insurance. She provided voices for the Andrex \"Be kind to your behind\" and Glade fragrance advertisements (playing a gorilla).\n\nOn several projects, Colman has worked with the comedians Mitchell and Webb.[16] She joined them in 2003 to play Sophie in the Channel 4 comedy Peep Show. Other joint ventures have included radio's That Mitchell and Webb Sound and its television version, That Mitchell and Webb Look. She decided to leave the programme after her agent suggested that she was becoming too closely associated with their work and needed to widen her horizons, a decision which was made \"with tears\".[18] Colman continued to appear on Peep Show less often until it ended in 2015.\n\nShe had a recurring role in the surrealist comedy Green Wing from 2004 to 2006. One of her earliest film credits is naturist Joanna Roberts in the 2006 mockumentary film Confetti, a role she has described as \"the worst experience of my life\".[16]\n\nIn 2007, Colman starred as Alice in the comedy film Grow Your Own and as PC Doris Thatcher in the action comedy film Hot Fuzz. She also played a lead role in Paddy Considine's short film Dog Altogether.

Colman made a guest appearance in the episode \"Naomi\" of the series Skins as Naomi's mother, Gina.

Colman appeared the following year in the BBC drama Exile, written by Danny Brocklehurst and starring John Simm and Jim Broadbent. From 2011 to 2012, she played Ian Fletcher's (Hugh Bonneville) lovelorn secretary Sally Owen in Twenty Twelve, a comedy series about planning for the 2012 Olympic Games in London.\n\nColman rejoined Considine in 2011 for his feature-film directorial debut, Tyrannosaur, receiving the BIFA Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a British Independent Film and the Empire Award for Best Actress.[20] She played Carol Thatcher that year in the Academy Award-winning drama The Iron Lady, with Meryl Streep and Jim Broadbent, for which she won the London Film Critics' Circle Award for British Actress of the Year.[21]\n\nIn 2013, Colman began playing DS Ellie Miller in ITV's Broadchurch.

Colman believes that \"the media industry has huge influence and with that comes a responsibility to contest the stigma that sadly still exists, through accurate representation\". She has spoken openly to the Big Issue about her experience of postnatal depression after the birth of her first child.[11]\n\nInspired by her research for the film Tyrannosaur, in 2014, Colman became the patron of the UK charity Tender, which uses theatre and the arts to educate young people about preventing violence and sexual abuse.
