        "text": "What I'm looking for is a two seater where both can pedal. Need bucket style seats. My better half has Narcolepsy with cataplexy, cataplexy being a temporary full body rag doll paralysis, hence the need for a bucket seat. I've looked at a hase pino but she doesn't want to sit up front. A hase kettelweis as a trailer - no, doesn't fancy being down in the exhaust fumes.\n\nHas anyone seen anything? She wants to pedal too, not just be a passenger.\n\nVan Raam Fun2Go, other types available, speciality bikes are their thing, prob not cheap tho.\n\n(Remember to claim any disabled discount available)\n\nFoldable fairing for Hase Kettweisel? View attachment 41321\n\nYes I thought about that - you certainly seem to know of many bikes! My design presently has two wheels at the front and one at the back, bit like a folding Tadpole (400 mile range!) \"Delivery time dependent upon order pipeline.\" It's delivered through a big thick pipeline extending from Denmark to outside your house, therefore a bargain at \"€5,780.00 Incl. 25% VAT\"\n\nVELOKS MK3 MID - Center Motor Drive, Unique - VELOKS\n\nVELOKS's full suspension electric Trike with extreme range. This \"classic\" version comes with rear wheel drive Mid-Drive motor. The reclined seat, the suspension on all wheels, the three wheels and the motor support, makes riding comfortable, easy and safe. The Trike is designed bottom up for...\n\nE-bikes are efficient, but nothing beats this 400 mile range electric recumbent trike\n\nWhen it comes to electric transportation, it’s hard to beat an electric bicycle on efficiency. They are lightweight, narrow and...\n\n...it's a bit wider at the front than the Hase Kettweisel... therefore a double umbrella unfolding arrangement perhaps?\n\nUmbrellas for Two , a Duo Twin Parasol from UMBRELLA HEAVEN\n\nWhen it comes to Umbrellas for Two, you can choose a large golf brolly... or perhaps consider this Umbrella for Two, designed for that very purpose? These rectangular shaped twin umbrellas are specifically designed to be big enough for two people!\n\nThe reason why I didn't attempt to craft such a double umbrella folding fairing, was because it'd do sod-all to protect the rider 's body when hit by a car, no matter what the material used was - I looked into geodesic dome-like variants but as yet haven't as yet made one (model) light and strong enough, which also folds small. Once I have solved the folding puzzle, I'll investigate how much weight 3D printed panels would save when printed in optimised microstructured layers, like they're doing for some 3D printed car body panels these days. My futile quest continues!\n\nView attachment 41396\n\nN55 XYZ system Tadpole Trike comes as a 3350euros ready assembled 2str +electric +alfine gears +disc brakes extra, or a \"plans with manual\" single str ( http://www.n55.dk/MANUALS/SPACEFRAMEVEHICLES/DIY.pdf) , but I think they leave out key info! :-/\n\nView attachment 41397\n\nOne version has 1 big clear polycarbonate sheet over whole machine, still no side protection.\n\nSee XYZCargo.com for details.\n\n(Google has a hazard triangle showing on that site) Hamburg citizens get a 33% discount, nice\n\nMaybe the 'Short' one is cheaper? 990euros +++!View attachment 41398\n\nVery nice! Lightweight too - many are 24-ish kg!\n\nI think I have an impact resistant folding canopy design! It's scale model time! When I have time. It's not an easy construction... it might have to wait till I retire at this rate. Then I'd have to crash test it. I'll need a volunteer rider - MikelBikel, are you available for impact test cycling? Mind you, I always have a new design for an impact resistant folding canopy, until it turns out that it doesn't fold small enough, or isn't safe."
