I had even made fun of him in the forums and felt like a total asshole, me and my big mouth. Reminds me that we should always be kind to each other because you never know what someone could be going through. If I had known and had a way to contact him, I would've done something to prevent it. I've had quite a few friends throughout the years that I stopped from making a terrible mistake and I would've been that kind of friend for him too. What a terrible way to die. Imagine if he was so depressed, what are the rest of us that aren't rich and in the same situation (or worse) supposed to do?\n\nTo all those that are gone but never forgotten:\n\nAt last the dark years of grieving come to an end\n\nOld haunts and habits invoking loved ones and friends\n\nThe graveyards forgotten, the churches are empty now\n\nI recall the times past and how much I miss you all\n\nWake up! Reborn! Join in and celebrate!\n\nMake noise! Wake up the great dead with reverence\n\nOn all hallow's eve\n\nEndless drumming; rituals to wake up the dead\n\nBring gifts and spirits, good wine- just cheese and some bread\n\nIncense of cigars and spices, pleasures we shared\n\nLight up the graveyards to show how much we all care\n\nWake up! Reborn! Join in and celebrate!\n\nMake noise! Wake up the great dead with reverence\n\nOn all hallow's eve\n\n​\n\nLike x 2\n\nLove it! x 2\n\nList"
