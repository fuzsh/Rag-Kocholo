        "text": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding the interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4R alpha) have been associated with IgE levels or clinical atopy in some populations. Two SNPs that encode S503P and Q576R in the intracytoplasmic domain of the receptor are associated with loss or gain of function, respectively. We investigated the frequency of these SNPs and their association with traits of allergic asthma in 36 unrelated subjects selected from a racially admixed, clinically ascertained study population with family histories of asthma. The frequency of the 1682 T to C substitution that encodes S503P was 0.11 (70 alleles analyzed, from 29 TT homozygotes and 6 TC heterozygotes). The frequency of the 1902 A to G substitution that encodes Q576R was 0.26 (68 alleles analyzed, from 20 AA homozygotes, 10 AG heterozygotes and 4 GG homozygotes). In this atopic admixed sample, no significant association was detected between the variant genotypes and serum IgE levels, perce...\n\nBackground and objectives: Allergic rhinitis has complex patterns of inheritance, and single nucleotide polymorphisms, a common genetic variation in a population, exert a significant role in allergic rhinitis pathology. The current study aimed to investigate the association of Interleukin-4 (IL-4) polymorphisms with allergic rhinitis. Materials and Methods: Our study included 158 patients with allergic rhinitis and 140 healthy controls from Jordan that were genotyped for IL-4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) C-589T (rs2243250) and T-2979G (rs2227284) using restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 software. Results: The results showed that the allelic frequency of the minor alleles was 0.19 and 0.67 for C-589T (rs2243250) and T-2979G (rs2227284) in the allergic rhinitis patients, respectively, while it was 0.18 for C-589T (rs2243250) and 0.64 T-2979G (rs2227284) in the control gro..."
