Achieving this concept depends on management’s awareness of customers comment and needs, assessment and utilization of marketing mix in order to achieve greater market share. Also firms know that, the after sales service has a great impact on customer’s loyalty and purchase repeat. Therefore the services should have their satisfaction. This research is done by questionnaire and randomized sampling related to measuring customer’s satisfaction of marketing mix factors in the terms of Asan Motor (Hyundai distributor) sales and after sales service. The researcher is eager to study and identify the marketing mix factors mix that have the greatest impact on attracting and retaining Hyundai customers, to identify, prioritize them and assist management in the field of marketing decisions. Therefore, in this research, sales and after sales services of Marketing mix factors are based on the 4p approach: Price, promotion, product (service) and place are determined. Sale Statistical test results show that the importance of price is greater than other factors and Product factor is more important than place and promotion. In the field of after sales service, product (service quality), has the greatest impact however the Price factor, has the least impact.\n\n[Mostafa Jafari, Mohammad mahdavi mazde, Amir Ahmadi.

Many children around the world have turned to computer games, and parents without worried about the destructive effects of this product \"commercial-thriller\" are accustomed to behavior of their children, and passively meet this condition. Although the computer games can have positive effects such as: development of personality and behavior, nurturing talent, creativity, focus and precision, increasing IQ, expanding worldviews, enhanced artistry, learning complex concepts, transmission of culture, but it is much more the harmful effects such as weakening the spirit of collectivism, loosening of family ties, impatience, irritability and aggression in children and adolescents. Computer games can increase aggressive behavior in children; also these games can be effective in causing anti-social behavior and conflict. In addition computer games have effects on anxiety, depression, and academic failure. A child that the long hours of your day sits on the computer lags behind from the other activities necessary for the growth, such as academic activities, and social communication.\n\n[Shahsavari M.

Antioxidants are the main defense factors against oxidative stress induced by free radicals. Vitamin E is believed to be the primary component of the antioxidant system of the spermatozoa and is one of the major membrane protectants against ROS and LPO attack. There is a relationship between activity of these antioxidant and function of sperm. Vitamins E and C which are belong to non-enzymatic antioxidant are used as a supplemented drug to improve sperm quality in male infertility. Material and methods: 16 adult male mice were divided equally into two groups each containing 8 mice. Mice of group 1 served as control fed on basal diet, group 2 received basal diet and vitamin E (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) for 35 days. Blood was taken for the determination of serum testosterone. Finally, right tail of epididymis was cut in Ham’s F10. Released sperm were used to analyze number, motility, morphology (Pap-staining) and viability (Eosin-Y staining) of the sperm and DNA integrity and chromatin condensation assessments were ready by standard cytochemical techniques including. (AOT): Acridine orange is a metachromatic fluorescence explore for the dimension of sperm nuclear DNA susceptibility to in situ acid-induced denaturation by distinctive between double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA. (AB): Aniline blue selectively stains lysine-rich histones and has been used for the purpose of those sperm chromatin condensation anomalies that are related to residual histones. (TB): Toluidine blue is a metachromatic dye which determines both the quality and the quantity of sperm nuclear chromatin. Result: In vitamin E mice, a significant increase was found in sperm number, sperm motility, sperm viability and sperm morphology compared to control group. A significant increase was also found in sperm AB+ (Mature sperm), TB- (normal) and Ao+ (double-stranded DNA) in vitamin E group compared to control group. The results suggest an increase in concentration testosterone in vitamin E mice compared to control mice, Conclusion: It was concluded, Vit.E not only is able to improvement the sperm parameters but also increases sperm chromatin quality in mice. Also vitamin E increases the level of testosterone hormone in mice.\n\n[Pourentezari M M.Sc, Talebi, AR Anvari M, Khalili MA, Mangoli E, M.Sc.

Obesity has been suggested as a major risk factor for this disease. This study aims to assess the relation between obesity and CAD in a selected group of Egyptian population. Other risk factors, including blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipids have also been investigated. The study included 80 patients with CAD (mean age: 47.86 years, males / females: 43/37), and 40 healthy controls (mean age: 46.15 years, males / females: 13/27). CAD patients were divided according to their body mass index (BMI) into 2 main groups: normal weigh group (BMI: 18.5–24.9, n=40) and abnormal weight group (BMI≥25, n= 40), the latter group was further sub-divided into overweight group (BMI: 25.0–29.9, n= 20) and obese group (BMI≥ 30, n= 20).The study revealed marked increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) among CAD patients compared to normal subjects. Significant increase in serum lipids [total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)] and glucose, as well as blood glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) % were also recorded. This goes in parallel with a reduction in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and NO level in all CAD patients. However, these changes together seemed to be more drastic in the obese patients comparing with control and CAD patients with normal and overweight profile. So, it can conclude that obesity confers independent risk factor for CAD, probably through influencing interaction with the traditional risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia.\n\n[Azza M.

El Kony and S. A. Saafan\n\nPhysics Department, Faculty of Science, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.\n\nsamiasaafan@yahoo.com\n\nAbstract: Dielectric properties and magnetic susceptibility were measured for four compositions of Mn Zn ferrites ( Mn1-x Znx Fe2O4; x = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.2).Then composites of these ferrites with SiO2 were prepared by mixing 25% weight of SiO2 powder with 75% weight of each composition of the ferrite powders. The dielectric properties and the magnetic susceptibility were measured again for the composite samples. The results are displayed as functions of temperature and frequency for the dielectric constant, loss tangent and AC conductivity, whereas for the magnetic susceptibility only results at room temperature are reported. The results show that adding silicon dioxide has significantly reduced the conductivity or in other words increased the resistivity while the magnetic susceptibility still have high values in the same order of magnitude. These findings may be useful in many applications that require the reduction of eddy currents while keeping the magnetic susceptibility in the same range.\n\n[D. El Kony and S. A. Saafan.

Early diagnosis, accurate preoperative staging and better adjuvant treatment remain a challenge. Abdominal ultrasound, abdominal CT, EUS and ERCP are common tools used for imaging of pancreatic cancer. Fine needle aspiration has made significant contribution to the diagnosis of cancer pancreas. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the role of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the diagnosis of pancreatic masses and in the differentiation of cancer pancreas from benign lesions. In addition to that, the level of serum CA19-9 was measured to assess its accuracy in differentiating cancerous from benign lesions. Methods: This cross section descriptive study included 40 patients with pancreatic lesions. They were subjected to full clinical examination, laboratory tests (including serum level CA19-9), abdominal ultrasound, percutaneous sonar guided FNAC of pancreatic lesions, endosonography and surgical interference (was done to 32 patients). Results: Thirty three patients proved to have pancreatic malignancy while seven patients proved to have pancreatitis. Ultrasonography (US) showed a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 86% and accuracy of 73% for malignancy detection. Adding CA19-9 to ultrasound raised to sensitivity to 94%, specificity remained 86% and accuracy to 93%. Adding FNAC to US raised the sensitivity to 85%, specificity remained 86% and accuracy to 91%. EUS showed a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 91%. Adding CA19-19 to EUS showed a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 91%. Adding FNAC to EUS showed a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 86% and accuracy of 97%. Conclusion: The combination of EUS, serum CA 19-9 level and Sonar guided fine needle aspiration showed accuracy of 97% in diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. These investigatory tools are cheap and available and thus may be an excellent alternative to EUS guided fine needle aspiration which is expensive and available in only few centers.\n\n[Ahmed A.

Farag *\n\n*Ophthalmology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Al Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt.\n\nMofarag2000@yahoo.com; Mofarag2000@hotmail.com\n\nAbstract: Purpose: To evaluate the effect of vitreo macular interface changes on serous macular detachment in diabetic macular edema (whether spongy-like or cystoid). Methods: This study involved 281 eyes with diabetic macular edema and serous macular detachment. Complete ophthalmic examination, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were done. Heidelberg Spectralis OCT was used to examine all eyes and scans were done on horizontal, vertical and twelve radial planes through the centre of the fovea. The height of serous macular detachment was measured with a caliper in all eyes & the state of vitreo macular interface was reported. Results: Of the 281 eyes with diabetic macular edema & serous macular detachment (SMD), spongy-like DME was reported in 213eyes (75.8%) and cystoid DME in 68 eyes (24.2%). With Spectralis OCT, serous macular detachment was shown as neuro-sensory retinal elevation over non-reflective cavity with minimal shadowing of the underlying structures. The height of serous macular detachment was measured with a caliper & the state of vitreo macular interface was reported. Conclusions :Spectral domain optical coherence tomography plays a major role in the diagnosis of DME with SMD & provides detailed description of the associated vitreo macular interface changes. In our reported cases vitreo macular interface changes did not play a major role in the pathogenesis of SMD with DME as 68.33% with DME & SMD had no VM interface tractional changes. Further study on a larger number of cases is recommended to determine the role of vitreomacular interface changes in the development of SMD in eyes with DME.\n\n[Mona Mohamad A Farag.

A good speaker identification system must have a high accuracy rate to avoid invalid identity. Despite of last few decades efforts, accuracy rate in speaker identification is still low. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach of unsupervised and supervised learning i.e. subtractive clustering and radial basis function(Sub-RBF).The proposed fused technique yields promising results because subtractive clustering is able to solve the initial guesses of cluster center and difficulty level to determine the number of cluster. Besides that, RBF has simple network structure and faster learning algorithm. In RBF input to output map uses the local approximations which will combine the linear approximations and causes the linear combinations with less weights. RBF neural network model uses subtractive clustering algorithm to select the hidden node centers for high training speed. In the meantime, the RBF network is trained with a regularization term so as to minimize the variances of the nodes in the hidden layer and to perform accurate prediction. Promising results are achieved to identify speaker using proposed fused approach.\n\n[Ann Y. T, Rahim M.S.M., Altameem A, Rehman A, Amin, I, M. Saba T.

Conventional casting techniques require considerable time, typically one hour for bench set (generally judged as the time taken for the investment to reach its maximum exothermic setting reaction temperature) for the investment and 1 to 2 hours for the wax elimination. It has been traditional either to cast invested wax patterns immediately after the investment has set or to store the invested patterns in a humidor for casting later. Sometimes, due to unexpected conditions, the bench set may extend to many hours. The purpose of this study was to evaluate different storage conditions effect and time before wax elimination on the marginal fit & surface adaptation (cement space) of base metal alloy crowns invested in phosphate-bonded investment material. This study compared the marginal fit, surface adaptation (cement space) of base metal alloy crowns to parent dyes after 1 hour following the setting of the investment in air, storage in a humidor for 12, 24 and36 hours, and storage in air for the same period of time before wax elimination. Material and Methods : A total of 35wax patterns were made simulating the artificial crown from the master dye (for investigation of surface adaptation and marginal accuracy), divided into three groups ; Group A (control group ; n=5) 1 hour bench set. Group B divided into 3 subgroups B1(n=5), B2(n=5) & B3(n=5), rings stored in a humidor for 12, 24 & 36 hours respectively. Group C divided into 3 subgroup C1(n=5), C2 (n=5), C3 (n=5) rings stored in air for 12,24 & 36 hours respectively. Wax burnout was carried out for all rings followed by casing using base metal alloy (Wiron Light) following the manufacturer instructions. Marginal discrepancy and surface adaptation of Groups A, B, and C were determined using measuring microscope. The obtained values of Groups A, B, and C were subjected to statistical analysis using student's \"t\" test. Results: The study showed that as regard to marginal discrepancy there were significant differences between the control group A and each of tested groups (at P<0.05). But for surface adaptation, the only significant difference were observed between point 2 in group A 138.8(±13.8), and point 2 in subgroup B2, 226,3 (±8.7). Also significant difference was observed between all measuring points in group A and that in all measuring points in subgroup B3. Conclusions: Increasing storage time of the invested wax pattern in humidor or air, adversely affects the marginal integrity. Invested wax patterns that had been stored for 36 hours in a humidor were demonstrated remarkable changes in surface adaptation in comparison with the control group especially at occlusal area. Storing the wax patterns in air for different periods had no statistical difference from control group.\n\n[Mostafa Gomaa and Ali Fahmy.

F. M. Ismail\n\nChemistry Department Faculty of Science, Al-Azhar University, Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt\n\nmamygg@rocketmail.com\n\nAbstract: Fe3+-doped TiO2 composite nanoparticles (Fe3+ = 0.01wt %) were successfully synthesized using an incipient wet impregnation method in order to prevent penetration of the dopant cation into the bulk of TiO2. The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by SEM, EDX, XRD and TEM. Results show that the size of Fe3+/TiO2 particles decreases on doping with Fe3+ and their XRD beaks are broaden. Doping Fe3+ can control the conversion of TiO2 from anatase to rutile. The photocatalytic degradation of Direct Yellow 50 was used as a model reaction to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 and Fe3+-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. The doping amount of Fe3+ remarkably affects the activity of the catalyst. The degradation of dye depends on several parameters such as pH, catalyst, substrate and H2O2 concentrations. Electrical energy per order (EE/O) was proposed to assess the relative performance of catalytic system used. The adsorption of direct yellow 50, onto TiO2 Degussa P25 from aqueous solution was investigated. The experimental data were analyzed by Langmuir and Freundlich models of adsorption. It was found that Langmuir equation fit better than Freundlich equation. The kinetics of the adsorption with respect to the initial dye concentration, were also investigated.\n\n[Mahmoud G.E.A. and L. F. M. Ismail.

Tammam1, Ahmed H. Abdellah1 and Mohamed Y. Abdel-Rahman2\n\nDepartments of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, South Valley University, Qena1, and Faculty of Medicine Sohag University2, Egypt. tamamkena@yahoo.com\n\nAbstract:Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel tourniquet in the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) during cesarean section. Design: Observational study Materials and Methods: This study was conducted in a tertiary university hospital between August 2010 and May 2012. Twenty one women with PPH (group 1) underwent a novel intra-cesarean tourniquet were compared to a well selected matched (21 patients) who developed PPH during cesarean section (group 2). A 16 or 18 French Foley’s catheter wasturned around the exteriorized uterus and the infundibuloplevic ligaments at the level of the uterosacral ligaments and tied 3 cm lower to the level of the CS incision. This tourniquet was applied to group 1 before attempting any surgical procedures while stepwise surgical interventions were performed in group 2 according to the hospital protocol. The outcome measures were the intra- and post-operative blood loss, need for blood transfusion, and maternal morbidities and mortalities. Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis when appropriate. Results: Intra-operative blood loss and the need for blood transfusion were significantly lower in group 1 compared to group 2 (P< 0.01). No significant difference between the two groups regarding pre- and post-operative hemoglobin or hematocrite value. Group 2 showed more frequent pyrexia (19% Vs 14%) and wound gapping (19% Vs 9%), however these differences were not significant (P = 0.50 and 0.33 respectively). No incidence of urinary injury in both groups. Cesarean hysterectomy wasindicated in 10 patients; 5 in each group. One case of maternal mortality and another case with lower limb deep venous thrombosis were recorded in group 2. Conclusion: This technique is an effective and safe intervention for controlling postpartum hemorrhage during cesarean section. It may be offered as a preliminary step to prevent massive bleeding and allow time for blood transfusion and further procedures.\n\n[Abdelaziz A. Tammam, Ahmed H. Abdellah and Mohamed Y.

Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) and multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) gel formulations composing of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cholesterol (CH) in the molar ratios of (7:2; 7:4 and 7:7) with or without stearylamine (SA) or dicetylphosphate (DP) were prepared using reversed-phase evaporation and lipid film hydration methods respectively. The prepared liposomal systems were evaluated for their entrapment efficiency, morphological characters, physical stability, particle size and drug release rate. LUVs entrapped greater amount of drug than MLVs. Drug loading was increased by increasing CH content as well as by inclusion of SA into the lipid bilayer. Drug release rate showed an order of negatively > neutral > positively charged liposomes, which is the reverse of results of drug loading efficiency. Physical stability study indicated that 92.56%, 84.11%, 76.41% and 91.1%, 82.19% and 75.54% of diclofenac sodium was retained in positive, negative, and neutral MLVs and LUVs respectively after storing for 120 days at refrigeration temperature. The in vivo anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using a thermal technique, results showed that the percentage of healed ulcers were 12.5%, 35%, 67.5%, 82.5%, 85%, 87.5% and 95% for negative control, positive control, 0.5% carbopol 934 gel, LUVs liposomes suspension, MLVs liposomes suspension, LUVs and MLVs gels, respectively.\n\n[Omaima A.

Hematological complications in brucellosis are common and can be multi-factorial due to the pathogen's tropism for central (bone marrow) and peripheral (spleen) organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Pancytopenia, although mainly reported in adults has also been described in children with brucellosis. This investigation was conducted to estimate the relative frequency of pancytopenia in children with brucellosis. The study was carried out in Al-Khafji region. All children suffering from fever of more than 5 days without clinically evident cause and associated with symptoms suggestive of brucellosis were screened by a rapid slide serum agglutination test for presence of brucellosis. Sixty patients who had tube agglutination titre > 1: 160 or had positive blood and/or bone marrow (BM) culture for brucellosis, were enrolled in the study. At enrollment, the following investigations were performed: CBC, blood culture and BM, aspiration was carried out in all patients with pancytopenia, to exclude malignancy. Obtained results revealed that: out of 60 children with brucellosis, 50 (83%) ingested raw animal milk and 45% had a positive family history of brucellosis. The commonly presenting symptoms and signs included; excessive sweating (68%), bone aches (62%), chills (55%), arthritis (32%), and hepatosplenomegaly. The most commonly detected hematological manifestations included; anemia (in 43%), leukopenia (in 38%) and leukocytosis (in 20%). Meanwhile, pancytopenia was detected in 11 patients (18%). Positive blood culture for brucella was seen in 38% (23 patients). melitensis from 21 patients was cultured in vitro.. Out of 9 BM cultures, 3 were positive for B. melitensis and 6 cultures were negative. Out of 11 patients with pancytopenia, 9 patients (82%) presented with bone aches and weakness, 7(64%) presented with sweating and chills, 6(55%) of patients had petechiea and purpura, 5 (46%) had splenomegaly and 5 (46%) had hepatomegaly. The majority of patients with brucella-induced pancytopenia had agglutination titres of > 1: 320 and all of them had positive blood culture for B. melitensis. In conclusion in a patient with fever, arthalgia, chills and hematological abnormalities such as anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia, brucellosis should be kept in mind, especially in geographical areas where the disease is still endemic, as in our region.\n\n[Mona Afify, Salha H Al-Zahrani, and Mohamad A El-Koumi.

It has also been shown that eradication ofH. pylori can increase platelet counts in patients with ITP. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence ofH. pylori infection in patients with ITP in Egypt, and the effect of bacterial eradication on their platelet counts. Subjects and methods: The study included 50 cases of ITP patients 28 females and 22 males with mean age of 33.24 ± 12.44years. 50 healthy individuals who are age and sex matched served as a control group. Testing for H pylori infection was done by serological testing for H.pylori serum antibodies and H.pylori stool antigen test. Results: H. pylori infection in patients with ITP was significantly higher than in control individuals (82.0% and 46.0%, respectively, p = 0.000), no statistical significant difference between H.pylori stool Ag and Abs positive and negative ITP patients regarding sex and age, no statistically significant difference between H.pylori infected and non infected ITP patients regarding age, sex and disease duration. ITP patients infected with H pylori were treated with H pylori eradication regimen, Thirty nine H. pylori infected ITP patients were successfully eradicated. Of them 26 patients (66.6%) showed complete or partial response regarding improvement of platelet counts, meanwhile 13 patients (33.3%) showed no response. No statistically significant difference between responders and non responders regarding age, sex, duration of disease and steroid treatment before and during the study. Conclusions: According to these results and others from different countries whereH. pylori infection rates are high, patients with ITP should be initially tested forH. pylori status, and if present, infection should be eradicated before initiating a drastic conventional ITP treatment. Larger controlled clinical trials are recommended to determine the predictors of response, response rate and durability and optimal time of therapy.\n\n[Hala M Fahmy, Nehad M Twfik, Ahmed Murad Hashem, Maha Gaafar.Eradication Therapy forHelicobacter Pylori in Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpra.

In the some direction this research do with the aim of investigation of aggression situation in Olympic athletes of contactable sport fields and non-Olympic, compare these fields with each other and compare with non-athletes. 96 number of elite athletes of different sport fields, taekwondo, judo, wrestling, boxing (as an athlete’s of Olympic sport fields), karate, wu shu, kickboxing and kung fu (as an athlete’s of non-Olympic sport fields) with having at least international place in his field, along with 96 non-athletes take part in this research. Findings of research shows significant difference in different components of aggression among research groups (p<0.001). Significant difference was seen among Olympic athletes in contactable sport fields and non-Olympic and also non-athletes, generally from an aggression point, and aggression components. Research Findings of research shows that Olympic athletes in sport fields has less aggression from non-Olympic athletes in sport fields, that this important shows great effects of Olympic movement purposes in sports and moral, mental and psychological characteristics of elite athletes of Olympic sport fields. Just as important purposes of Olympic movement, is promoting and developing moral and physical characteristics of individuals and education of youth through sport, according to results of this research and same researches find that Olympic games is something higher than holding a number of competitions every four years in part of a world. In fact, in depth of it, hidden moral, basic aims and education of Olympic movement and philosophy in international level.\n\n[Boostani MH, Boostani MA, Rezaei AM, Kohanpour MA.

The author has investigated such issue theoretically. From the feminists' viewpoint, domestic violence refers to the behavior influenced by patriarchal system of the society. From the second viewpoint (i.e. social learning), the violent men are always grown in the families in which the violence is a normal behavior. Based on the above discussion, the samples include some married women of Jahrom ranging between 16-70 years old. Most of the respondents were 20 – 25 year old. The 60 – 65 year old ones were those who answered the questions as little as possible. Moreover, about 0.1 of the respondents had high educational degrees and about. 49 was below diploma. From the results of this study, it becomes clear that about. 18 of the husbands of the respondents had 2500 thousands Rials income monthly, %45 had between 3500 – 5500 thousand Rials. In sum, their incomes ranged between 4000 – 9000 thousand Rials.\n\n[Mojtaba Hemayatkhah, Leila Nikpoor.

To increase efficiency ratio of equipments, the failure and disability of equipments should be decreased, which in turn results in increased reliability of equipments and machineries. This will be more important when equipments are utilized in the oil processing company as a vital continuous manufacturing industry of a country like Iran. In this survey the feasibility of implementing maintenance has been investigated based on four dimensions of maintenance management, reliability centered maintenance, project management and change management. The necessary data has been collected and analyzed by a questionnaire filled by maintenance experts of Esfahan Oil Refinery Company (EORC). Findings imply that the major hypothesis of survey has been approved, and among minor hypotheses, one has been rejected indicating that the level of maintenance management factors, reliability centered maintenance, and project management in EORC are higher than medium, while change management is less than medium.\n\n[Arash Shahin, Sara Rashidi, Amin Mahmoudi.

Metallothionein (MT) is a low molecular weight metal binding protein; it plays an important role in providing protection from cadmium toxic­ity. Vitamin C is one of the most important antioxidants that is used for prophylaxis and treatment of cadmium toxicity. The current study included 24 Albino rats and divided into four groups, each one includes six rats. First group was kept as controls (CON). The second one was given only vitamin C (VIC). The third was given only cadmium chloride Cdcl2 (CAD).The last group was given both vitamin C and Cdcl2 (VIC+CAD). Metallothionein 1 and 2 mRNA expressions were measured in liver and kidney tissues by SYBR green relative quantitative Real time PCR in all samples. The Cdcl2 increases the expression of both MT1 and MT2 mRNA in liver by 4.421 and 3.827 fold and in kidney tissues by 1.095 and 1.203 respectively. The study also demonstrates that vitamin C decreases the expression of MT1 and MT2 in kidney tissues by 0.214 and 0.191 fold respectively and has no significant effect on liver tissues. It was suggested that MT and MT2 mRNA act as biomarkers of cadmium toxicity. Vitamin C had a protective role against cadmium through its antioxidant effect and that appeared through decreasing the expression of both MT1 and MT2 in liver and kidney tissues.\n\n[Olla Adel Khalifa, Naglaa Fathy Alhusseini, Gamal A.

At the same time to predict patient prognosis and survival in each staging system. Material and methods: We retrospectively identified HCC patients from the database of the Hepato-biliary and liver transplantation Unit/General Surgery and Radiology departments, Al Zahraa University hospital, between April 2011 and July 2012. The patients included after confirmed pathology by radiologic criteria of tri-phasic CT and/or AFP level > 400 ng/ml. The data collected to stage all patients by CTP, Okuda and BCLC systems. It is included demographics, risk factors for developing HCC, performance status, cirrhosis clinical manifestations. Laboratory data, including coagulation profile, different cirrhosis parameters and AFP, were captured as well as bilirubin references. Tumor characteristics that were reported were number of lesions, diameter of largest lesion, and extent of disease, MVI and metastatic disease status. Results: We identified 56 patients with radiology and laboratory confirmed HCC. Their age ranged from 40 to 76 years and mean age is 56.6+ 6.73 years. There are 41(73%) males and 15(27%) females. All patents presented with cirrhosis, which is induced by hepatitis C virus in 49 patients, hepatitis B virus in 6 patients. One of these hepatitis B patents is addict and alcoholic. The patients divided into 3 groups. The first group included 35 patients who were treated with TACE/TAC. The second group included 17 who were treated with sequential TACE/RFA. The third group included 4 patients who were treated by symptomatic and oral chemotherapy. MVI was present in 10 (28%) patients of TACE group and the 4 (100%) patients of the oral chemotherapy group. The patients were followed for 1 year and the mean duration of follow-up in the study was 8.0 months. 19 (29.4%) patients in this study died during follow-up.

Different colchicine concentrations were applied to seeds and seedlings using two methods: immersion and sprinkling. Both methods were successful in polyploidy induction. Karyotyping of F1 seeds andtheir parents were examined for polyploidy. Chromosome number was determined in root-tip cells 2-3d old from seed sowing. Tetraploids were evident in all populations (2n= 4X=32), whereas diploid parents had (2n=2X=16) chromosomes. Interactions between genotypes and colchicine treatments recorded high significant differences of no. inflorescences plant-1, 1000-seed weight, no. floret inflorescence-1 and no. seeds floret-1 with significant differences of seed weight g m-2, seed setting% and mortality%. Higher variation in leaflet shape and number, inflorescence size and shape and floret size was viewed over all colchicine treatments in tetraploid plants compared with the control. High positive significant correlation coefficient between number of seeds per floret and number of florets plant-1 (r=0.853**) and seed setting% (r=0.943**), mortality% was negatively correlated with seed setting% (-0.795**). Positive significant correlation was found between 1000-seed weight and number of florets plant-1 (r=0.711*) and seed setting% (r=0.744*). Polyploidy induction resulted in taller plants, faster re-growth after cutting, increased tillering and branching plant-1, increases in 1000 seed weight and increased seed yield m-2. This methodology can be used in plant breeding programs to increase forage production efficiency and select for more superior adaptive genotypes.\n\n[Abd El-Naby, Zeinab, M, Nabila A.

Four cases are analyzed where, five, six, six and eight Raman pumping of special pumping powers are launched in the forward direction. The model equations are numerically handled and processed via specially cast software (Matlab). The gain is computed over the spectral optical wavelengths (1.45μm ≤ λ signal ≤ 1.65μm).\n\n[Fathy M.

Adel, Eslam Safwat, Hany Haroun\n\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University\n\ndr_hanyharoun@yahoo.com\n\nAbstract: Background: Gastric vascular ectasia (GVE) is a distinct vascular abnormality, including various subtypes. It is a well-known cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. Various endoscopic treatment modalities have been tried in this condition. Aim of the study: This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of argon plasma coagulation (APC) on various subtypes of GVE. Patients & methods: From November 2010 to October 2011, thirty patients with different forms of GVE were enrolled, divided into 3 subgroups: portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) (n=10), focal vascular ectasia (FVE) (n=10), and gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) (n=10). They were followed-up for 3 months with repeated sessions of APC. The APC settings were 30 to 40W and 1.5 to 2L/min of argon plasma flow. Efficacy of APC was evaluated on the basis of patient's symptoms, transfusion requirements, number of hospitalization, hemoglobin and haematocrit levels. Results: The mean number of APC sessions was 2.3±0.82, 2±0.81 and 1.9±0.87 in PHG, FVE and GAVE groups respectively. Patients with PHG were the most susceptible for re-bleeding (30%) after 1st APC session. The rise in haemoglobin was highly significant in all three groups (p=0.0001). A significant reduction in packed RBCs transfusion rates was also noted in the 3 groups (p=0.0001). No complications occurred. Conclusion: APC appears to be a simple, safe, and effective technique in the management of different forms gastric vascular ectasia lesions.\n\n[M. Malatawy, Hanan M. Badawy, Nanees A.

Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted at the Radiology Department of King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah, between September and October 2011. The machine settings, including the thermal index (TI) and mechanical index (MI) as well as scan times were recorded during obstetric ultrasound examinations. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Independent t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to compare continuous variables. Results: A total of 347 scans were studied. Most of them were performed in pulsed Doppler mode (n=176 ; 50.7%). Examination scan times varied between 1 to 27 minutes. The highest recorded TI value was 2.1, with mean ± SD of 0.81 ± 0.53 for examinations that lasted less than 15 minutes. The highest TI and MI values were observed during pulse Doppler. Conclusion: Thermal index values are within recommended safety guidelines. However, MI values sometimes exceed 1 and exposure times should be monitored to restrict the occurrence of any biologic effects due to ultrasound waves.\n\n[Sarah Kamal Hagi.

Murshid\n\nDivision of Orthodontics, Department of Preventive Dental Science, Faculty of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. zmurshid@kau.edu.sa\n\nAbstract: Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the pattern of arch form among patients with Angles Class I, II and III malocclusions. Materials and Methods: Sample consisted of 299 records of orthodontic patients who attended the clinic at the Faculty of Dentistry, King Aabdulaziz University. The mean age was 16.3 (±0.83) years. Patients were assigned into three groups according to their Classification; Class I, Class II and Class III. The lower arch form was assessed and categorized as ovoid, tapered, and square. Results: There was a significant difference in the pattern of lower arch form among the three groups (P >05); ovoid arch form being the most prevalent among Class I and Class II cases and square was the most prevalent among Class III cases for both genders. There was a significant trend in proportion among Class I cases where the percentage of ovoid shape was higher in males while taper arch shape was higher among females. Conclusions: The ovoid type of preformed arch wire with different sizes is recommended in orthodontic treatment for most of Class I, II malocclusions, and the square type is recommended in the treatment of most of Class III malocclusion. With the availability of different preformed shapes and sizes of arch wires, this study highlight the importance of selection of patients’ clinical arch form and customization of arch wire is usually necessary.\n\n[Zuhair A.

The main objectives of the study are to investigate the hydrodynamic impact of oriented groin existence in a stream bed. A 2-D laboratory flume model was used. About 30 runs were carried out for monitoring the impact of groin length, orientation angle, and the discharge on working length, and velocity components. 28 measuring points were used for velocity measurements distributed as 4 lines from A to D crossed by 7 cross sections. The study showed that the straight groin of 8cm (20% contraction ratio) has the longest working length, however the repelling groin of angle of 600 and 4cm length of (10% contraction ratio) presented the shortest working length. The velocity was decreased than the basic case at the nearest velocity line to groin installation; however the velocity increased than the basic case for the rest lines. The velocity was inversely proportional to groin length upstream and downstream groin location. The impact of groin orientation angle on velocity was exclusive at lines A and B; however the impact was vanished after that at lines C and D. Groin installation proved high efficiency in bank protection especially with high discharges.\n\n[Ibrahim M. M. Experimental Study to Investigate the Flow Pattern Associated to Angled Groins.

Recurrence of HCV post transplantation is one of the major challenges which is associated with poor graft and patient survival. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of clinical HCV recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) and identify possible factors affecting it. The study was conducted on 122 recipients of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) due to HCV related liver cirrhosis. Clinical HCV recurrence was diagnosed by elevated liver enzymes, increased viral load and confirmed by histopathology of liver biopsy. Several factors related to recipients, donors, operative and postoperative period were analyzed for their relation to recurrent HCV. Our results showed that the clinical HCV recurrence was diagnosed in 22.7 % (28 patients) of LDLT recip"
