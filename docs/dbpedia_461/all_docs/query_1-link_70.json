RESPONSIBILITIES OF AUTHORS e authors are entirel The Editors of the Annals of Saudi Medicine welcome contributions from our readers. The Annals will consider for publication manu- scripts from any part of the world, but most particularly manuscripts that would be of interest to readers in the Middle East. We publish scientific reports on human subjects in the form of original articles, brief reports, case reports and letters. We also accept review ar- ticles, special communications and editorials. All submissions are subject to review by the Editorial Board and by referees in appropri- ate specialties. SUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPTS Manuscripts are received with the understanding that they have not been published (in print or online) or are not under simultaneous consideration by another publication. If an abstract of the work has previously been published or if manuscripts using the same data- base or relating to the same topic have been published or submitted by any of the authors, this should be disclosed. Authors who violate these requirements will be subject to an extended publication ban. An abstract published prior to a full report is not regarded as a duplicate publication. Accepted manuscripts may not be published elsewhere without the Annals permission. Manuscripts should be submitted online (http://www.journalonweb.com/asm), but if you have difficulty with online submission you may mail us an electronic copy of the manuscript on floppy disk or CD. To ensure that peer review is double-blinded, there should be no title page in the file of the manuscript that is submitted online. The file name should not include the author's name or other identifying text. Portions of the submission (photographs, artwork, etc.) may be sent by mail if necessary, but we prefer that these be prepared in digital form and submitted online. If you have difficulty, contact us by e-mail at admin saudiannals.net MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION The format of the Annals of Saudi Medicine complies with \"Uni- form Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Jour- nals\" published by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (see http;//www.icmje.org). We encourage the use of re- porting guidelines such the CONSORT statement for randomized, controlled trials and the STROBE statement for observational stud- ies (see Attp://www.equator-network.org/). Manuscripts, including tables, references, and figure legends, must be prepared using a word processing program and submitted online (http://www. journalonweb.com/asm). Before submitting a manuscript, create an account on Medknow website. When you submit the manuscript res as necessary); ed on the findings, evidence A FROM THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF his issue of the Annals is the first of Volume 30, marking three decades of publication in service to the local and regional medical community. Initially intended as a vehicle for publishing the medi- cal experiences of physicians at King Faisal Specialist Hospital, the journal has grown to become one of the most important general medical journals, not only in the Middle East, but throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Asia, with manuscripts submitted from all over the world. Our new entry on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_Saudi_Medicine) tells more about the founding and history of the Annals. One of the most significant achievements was the remarkable increase in the Impact Factor, the most widely used measure of progress of a publication. For 2008, it nearly doubled again from the pre- vious year. The Annals now has by far the highest Impact Factor in the region. Since we have made no attempt to artificially increase the Impact Factor, we believe this increase is due solely to continuing improvement in the importance of articles we publish, which is a reflection of the efforts of all involved in the publication of the journal. Of the nearly 1000 manuscripts submitted to the Annals each year, about 13 to 15 percent pass the rigorous peer review process and are accepted for publication. Another important development in the past year is the conversion to use of a combination man- uscript management and electronic 0 publishing system using the services of Annals of Saudi Medicine Medknow Publications. We believe use ان اناف‎ of this system will help to streamline the peer review and production processes to speed up the time to first decision and 95|] time to publication. Our turnaround time continues to be comparable or even better than many reputable journals with a mean submission to first decision time of 31 days. 03 f At this juncture, | am planning to move for an extended period of time to anoth- er institution outside the country for aca- demic reasons. With this move, | have to pass the baton to another colleague 1 who will certainly lead the Annals to con- tinue its noble message. Dr. Mohammed | L ا‎ 4 Ahmed is an outstanding clinician/sci- 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 entist and an expert in endocrinology. I have no doubt that with his leadership and vision and with the support of a group of experts in the Editorial Board and the hard-working and competent editorial staff, the Annals will continue to flourish as the leading journal in this region of the world. ! would like to take this opportunity to thank the authors, the reviewers, the editorial board and staff who all contributed to make the Annals a pub- lication worth reading. It has been a wonderful challenge to be the Editor-in-Chief of the Annals and a pleasure to serve its readership. Ali S.

Male gender, large waist circumference, younger age and noninsulin use were associated with elevated ALT levels. MEDICAL GENETICS AND CARDIOLOGY Endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene Glu298Asp polymorphism in patients with coronary artery disease Salimi and colleagues investigated the association between NOS3 gene polymorphisms and coronary artery disease by comparing 241 CAD patients with 261 control subjects without CAD. Genotype frequencies differed significantly between the groups. The Glu298Asp polymorphism was an independent risk factor for CAD. INFECTIOUS DISEASE Pandemic influenza A H1N1 in Saudi Arabia: description of the first one hundred cases Memish and colleagues collected information on cases of influen- za caused by the pandemic H1N1 virus in Saudi Arabia between June 1 and July 3, 2009. Most (57%) of the cases occurred in pa- tients younger than 30 years of age, 47% of cases were imported, and the most common nationalities were Saudi and Filipino. The most common symptoms were fever, cough and sore throat. The authors recommend comprehensive and effective measures to control spread of the virus. Mother-to-child transmission of HIV: experience at a referral hospital in Saudi Arabia Of 39 infants born to HIV positive mothers at a tertiary care center in Riyadh between January 1994 and June 2006, Edathodu and colleagues found that all tested negative to HIV. Previously, a high rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV was reported for Saudi Arabia. All of the mothers were taking antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and delivery. SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION Analysis of complications in hepatic right lobe living donors Azzam and colleagues analyzed postoperative complications in right lobe liver donors from 311 liver transplantations performed between February 1998 and December 2003. Thirty percent of donors experienced one or more complications. Biliary complica- tions were most common, followed by persistent abdominal fluid collection. Remnant liver size and anatomical variations in the biliary tree are important risk factors for postoperative complica- tions. review The First Influenza Pandemic of the 21st Century Sami Al Hajjar, Kenneth McIntosh?

On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic level to the highest level, Phase 6, indicating widespread community transmission on at least two continents. The 2009 H1N1 vi- rus contains a unique combination of gene segments from human, swine and avian influenza A viruses. Children and young adults appear to be the most affected, perhaps reflecting protection in the elderly owing to exposure to H1N1 strains before 1957. Most clinical disease is relatively mild but complications leading to hospitalization, with the need for intensive care, can occur, especially in very young children, during pregnancy, in morbid obesity, and in those with underlying medical conditions such as chronic lung and cardiac diseases, diabetes, and immunosuppression. Bacterial co-infection has played a signifi- cant role in fatal cases. The case of fatality has been estimated at around 0.4%. Mathematical modeling suggests that the effect of novel influenza virus can be reduced by immunization, but the question remains: can we produce enough H1N1 vaccine to beat the pandemic? March, 2009: the rapid spread of a virus with novel anti- genic determinants; a change in pathogenicity with high death rates in younger age groups; successive pandemic waves; apparent higher transmissibility than that of the seasonal influenzas; and differences in impact in differ- ent geographic region.’ The overall mortality in the pre- vious century's three pandemics ranged from 1 million to more than 45 million deaths.*® In the three previous influenza pandemics, vaccines were not produced in time to have any substantial impact.’ Even though the technology of vaccine manufacture (production in em- bryonated eggs) has changed little since the 1930's, there is some hope that vaccines will be available to mitigate the force of later waves of the current epidemic. In ad- dition, several clinically useful antiviral drugs are now available, although there are still concerns about devel- opment of resistance.’ Influenza virus: Back to basics The viruses that cause influenza (influenza A, B, and C) belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, which is char- ith the emergence of the second wave of the 2009 influenza A (HINI) virus, there have been concerns that this pan- demic may rival those of 1957, 1968, and even 1918 in which not thousands, but millions of people around the world died from the disease (Table 1(.2 WHO is advising countries of the northern and southern hemi- spheres to prepare for a second wave of H1N1, in which large numbers of severely ill patients requiring more and more intensive care infrastructure are likely to be seen, creating pressures that could overwhelm hospitals and intensive care units and possibly disrupt the provision of care of other diseases. The newly developed H1N1 vaccine is expected to reduce the impact of the second wave of HINI influenza in the population, especially on high-risk groups, with diminished complications, hospitalization rates and mortality. On the other hand, previous HINI strains have developed antiviral resis- tance, and this, as well as mutation to greater virulence, remain concerns for the future. Past pandemics were characterized by several features that we have seen since Ann Saudi Med 30(1) January-February 2010 www.saudiannals.net H1N1 Table 1. Influenza pandemic of the 20th century. Three waves: A first, mild wave in the spring of 1918 was replaced by a second wave in September to November, 1918 that resulted in a mortality rate of over 2.5%. A third wave with equally high mortality rates swept around the world in 1919. The virus probably originated from the United States and then spread to Europe. Two waves: The virus originated in Southern China in February 1957 and spread over 3 months to Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan and in October 1957 reached the United Kingdom and United States. A second wave was detected in January 1958. Two waves in the winters of 1968-1969 and 1969-1970. The virus originated from Hong Kong in July 1968. 1918-1919 \" (Spanish Flu) H1N1 Over 50 million 1957-1958 5 (Asian Flu) H2N2 1-1.5 million 1968-1969 H3N2 — (Hong Kong Flu) circulating virus developed over 80% drift from the vi- rus that was used to make one of the three major vac- cine components that year ( Table 2). Further, marked changes in H, with or without similar changes in N, termed “antigenic shift\"! occur when new H or N gene segments are acquired by a process known as “reassort- ment.’ This may take place by the mixing of genetic seg- ments during dual infection of cells by a human and an animal virus. When such viruses containing reassorted gene segments are introduced into a population that has no pre-existing immunity, they may lead to a pandemic. This happened in 1957 and 1968.'^! Devastating pandemics take place when populations are exposed to a new viral subtype in the absence of pre- existing immunity. The infectious capabilities of a new virus that emerges in this way through reassortment are likely to be acquired from one or more of the human influenza gene segments. Conditions favorable for the emergence of an antigenic shift (reassortment) involve humans living in close proximity to domestic poultry and pigs.\" Pigs play an important role in interspecies transmission of influenza virus. Susceptible pig cells process receptors for both avian and human influenza strains which allow the pigs to serve as mixing vessels for the exchange of genetic material between human and avian viruses resulting in the appearance of novel subtypes. Analysis of the 1957 H2N2 pandemic strain found that the emergent virus resulted from the acqui- sition by previously circulating human H1N1 of three new gene segments of avian origin (the H2 gene, the N2 gene, and one other). Similarly, the 1968 pandemic H3N2 virus acquired two new genes from an avian vi- rus closely related to viruses isolated from ducks in Asia in 1963. In contrast, the 1918 HINI virus appears to Ann Saudi Med 30(1) January-February 2010 www.saudiannals.net acterized by a segmented minus-strand RNA genome. Influenza A and B viruses genomes consist of 8 separate segments. These include the following: three transcrip- tases (PB1, PB2, and PA), two surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutunin (H or HA) and neuramidase (N and NA), two matrix proteins (M1 and M2), and one nucleocapsid protein (NP). Epidemic disease is caused by influenza viruses type A and B. Type C influenza vi- ruses cause sporadic mild influenza-like illness in chil- dren. The focus of this article will be on influenza A virus, which may infect humans and birds and most im- portantly has the capability of developing into pandem- ic virus. Type A influenza has been divided into mul- tiple subtypes, and the natural host for most of these are various avian species. In addition, influenza A viruses of a few distinct subtypes have been isolated from pigs, horses, seals, whales and human beings. The genome of the virus codes for two important surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (H or HA) and the neuraminidase (N or NA). Based on both sequence and antigenic anal- ysis, sixteen distinct H (H1-H16) and nine distinct N (N1-N9) subtypes are now recognized in animal and avian influenza viruses, but only 3 H subtypes (H1, H2 and H3) and 2 N subtypes (N1, N2) have caused ex- tensive outbreaks in human beings.” The influenza virus has a poor ability to proofread its genetic material while replicating, which results in frequent errors in progeny genes, and thus frequent mutations. When such minor changes occur in the H and N proteins they result in “antigenic drift,’ the slow but significant change in anti- genicity that occurs over time in both influenza A and influenza B and that requires periodic changes in the yearly vaccine.” An example of such drift occurred dur- ing the 2003/2004 influenza season when the H3N2 Table 2. Antigenic drift and shift. Major change, new subtype Exchange of gene segments Occurs in A subtypes only May cause pandemic Example: H3N2 replaced H2N2 in 1968 Minor change within subtype Point mutations Occurs in A and B subtypes May cause epidemics Example: A/Fujian (H3N2) replaced A/ Panama (H3N2) in 2003-2004 Table 3.

HINI have been an avian-like influenza virus derived in toto from an unknown source. The currently circulating novel influenza H1N1 viruses that have been isolated around the globe during 2009 appear to have originated from two unrelated swine viruses, one of them a deriva- tive of the 1918 human virus. Evolution, zoonotic transmission and possible origin of 2009 H1N1 (Swine influenza) The 1918 H1N1 pandemic is believed to have also af- fected swine at that time. Its descendents have been enzootic in pigs up ever since (Table 3).^'^ The first influenza A isolated from diseased pigs in the United States (USA) was in 1930.\" These H1N1 swine virus- es are called the classical swine H1N1 viruses and have continued to circulate in pigs in the Americas, Asia and, until 1980, also in Europe, and they remain rela- tively antigenically stable.'* This swine H1N1 subtype has crossed over to humans periodically, including the Fort Dix outbreak in 1976,” resulting in infections that have been occasionally fatal, particularly in pregnant or immunocompromised persons, but not producing hu- man epidemics. Moreover, following the human pan- demic of the H3N2 subtype in 1968, H3N2 influenza virus infected pigs although such porcine strains have shown less antigenic drift in swine than in humans.” In 1998, H3N2 viruses with genes derived from hu- man, swine and avian genes of North America (“triple reassortant viruses”) were first isolated from pigs in the USA.” The triple reassortant H3N2 viruses also con- tinue to acquire other virus genes via reassortment to generate triple reassortant H1N2 or H1N1 viruses.” Swine viruses of subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 have been reported to cause occasional human infection during this time.? Between 1958 and 2005, 57 human swine-origin influenzas were reported. Twenty-two (5196) of these cases reported recent exposure to pigs. The overall fatality rate was 17%.” Prior to the current pandemic, but after December 2005, eleven sporadic cases of triple reassortant H1 viruses were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA, ten carrying H1N1 genes and one H1N2 genes. Some of the patients had close exposure to pigs. Possible limited human-to-human transmis- sion was reported in several situations.” Genetic analy- sis of 2009 H1N1 viruses isolated in North America, Europe and Asia revealed quadruple reassortant swine influenza A viruses that have not been recognized pre- viously in pigs or humans. The virus resulted from the reassortment of North American H3N2 and H1N2 swine viruses (triple reassortment viruses: avian/ swine/human with Eurasian swine viruses). 52628 Ann Saudi Med 30(1) January-February 2010 www.saudiannals.net H1N1 the pandemic alert from Phase 3 to Phase 4 and shortly after to Phase 5. On June 11, 2009, the WHO raised its pandemic to the highest level Phase 6, indicating widespread community transmission on at least two continents (Table 4).*°*? As of December 27, 2009, more than 208 countries and overseas territories/com- munities have each reported at least one laboratory- confirmed case of pandemic H1N1 influenza, with a total or more than 622000 laboratory confirmed cases and at least 12220 deaths. However, the num- ber of cases reported vastly underestimates the real number of cases: the WHO ceased regular reporting of case counts on July 16, 2009 because many coun- tries were having difficulty tracking their numbers, and the WHO judged that their time would be better spent on investigating severe cases and other excep- tional events. Most patients in the world with 2009 1112811 have been teenagers and young adults, with rates of hospitalization highest in very young chil- dren. Between 1% and 10% of clinical illness require hospitalization. Overall from 7% to1096 of all hospi- talized patients are pregnant women in their second or third trimester. Of the hospitalized patients from 10% to 25% have required admission to intensive care, and 296 to 996 have died.” Little is known about the level of pre-existing immunity to the 2009 HINI virus. Recent studies suggest that persons under the age of 30 years have little evidence of protective anti- bodies. However, a portion of older adults have pre- existing cross-reactive antibodies, presumably as a result of exposure to HINI strains circulating before 1957.738 Transmission of 2009 HINI virus from person to person is similar to that of other influenza viruses. The main route of transmission is respiratory through inhalation of large-particle respiratory drop- lets, and possibly via droplet nuclei. Transmission via large-particle droplets requires close contact because these droplets do not remain suspended in the air and generally travel only short distances (less than 2 me- ters). Contact with contaminated surfaces is another possible source of transmission. All respiratory secre- tions and bodily fluids (e.g. fomites, diarrheal stool) of infected persons should be considered potentially in- fectious.™™ The secondary attacks rate in households was estimated to be 27.396 and in school settings an infected school child was estimated to infect 2.4 other children within the school.” The estimated incuba- tion period could range from 1 to 7 days, but is most likely 1 to 4 days. Infected persons can be assumed to be shedding virus from one day prior to illness onset until resolution of symptoms (up to 7 days following illness onset). Children and immunocompromised or Ann Saudi Med 30(1) January-February 2010 www.saudiannals.net review Sequence analysis also suggests that PB2 and PA genes originated from American H3N2 avian virus; a PB1 originated from H3N2: HA, NP, and NS genes origi- nated from classical swine virus: and NA and M genes originated from Eurasian swine virus (Figure 1). One of swine genes of this new virus derived from the 1918 human virus, so the strain causing the 2009 pandemic is a fourth generation descendant of the 1918 virus. The 2009 H1N1 viruses are more pathogenic in mam- malian models than seasonal H1N1 viruses, showing the ability to replicate and cause appreciable pathology in the lungs of mice, ferrets and non-human primates. The pathologic changes seen were similar to those found in the lungs of animals infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus.” Epidemiology and impact Epidemiological data now indicate that the 2009 HINI influenza virus pandemic started as an out- break of influenza like illness in the Mexican town of La Gloria, Veracruz, in mid-February 2009. In mid- April the Center of Disease Control (CDC) identified swine origin HINI influenza virus in two specimens independently collected in southern California. By the end of April, international spread and human-to- human transmission prompted the WHO to increase Table 4. World Health Organization pandemic levels. No viruses circulating among animals have been reported to cause infections in humans. An animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat. An animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver, but the virus is not widely transmitted among humans. Verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human- animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause\" community-level outbreaks\". The risk of pandemic is significantly raised. Human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. The declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent The pandemic phase is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5.

Approximately 2% to 5% of laboratory- confirmed 2009 A (H1N1) influenza in Canada and in the United States as well as 896 in Mexico have required hospitalization.\" Nearly three-quarters of cases in the USA requiring hospitalization, as well as 21 (4696) of 45 fatal cases in Mexico, involved one or more underly- ing conditions including asthma, diabetes, heart or lung disease, neurologic disease, pregnancy, morbid obesity, autoimmune disorders and associated immunosup- 414647 Forty-five percent of patients pressive therapies. admitted to intensive care units in the USA series were children under the age of 18 years, and 596 were 65 years of age or older. Surveillance of pediatric deaths reported by CDC indicated that, of 36 children who died, seven (19%) were aged «5 years, and 24 (67%) had one or more high-risk medical conditions. Twenty-two (9296) of the 24 children with high-risk medical conditions had neurodevelopmental disabilities which included cerebral palsy, developmental delay, autism, congenital neurological disorders and other central nervous sys- tem disorders. Pneumonia is the most common and serious complication of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in- fluenza. The clinical course of 45 fatal cases in Mexico was characterized by severe pneumonia, hypoxemia with multifocal infiltrates including nodular alveolar, or basilar opacities on chest x-ray, and rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and re- nal or multi-organ failure. A similar experience was re- HINI immunosuppressed persons may be contagious for longer periods. The amount of virus shed is greatest during the first 2 to 3 days of infection and appears to correlate directly with the height of fever.? The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus is expected to come in waves, and we are now in the middle of the second wave. This wave may continue during winter, or there may be a third wave. As of today no increase of severity has been seen and genetic mutations have been minimal. Clinical features The clinical manifestations can vary from asymptom- atic infection to serious fatal illness that may include exacerbation of other underlying conditions or severe viral pneumonia with multi-organ failure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines cases as influenza-like illness (ILI) if there is a fever of »37.8'C (>100°F) plus cough and/or sore throat in the absence of a known cause other than influenza. In the outbreak of 2009 H1NI influenza pandemic in New York City, 9596 of virologically proven cases satis- fied the ILI definition.” Fever has been absent in some outpatients and in up to 1 in 6 surviving hospitalized patient. Vomiting and or diarrhea have occurred in up to 38% of outpatients in United States. \"^^ Young chil- dren may have atypical influenza illness with absence of fever and cough. Among 89 children with confirmed HINI who required hospitalization in Birmingham, UK, the most common symptoms were fever (8196), cough (73%), and diarrhea (6296). Infants may present with fever and lethargy. The CDC case definitions for confirmed, probable and suspected cases are presented in Table 5. Three categories of clinical presentations have been seen during the current pandemic:*°*° 1. Mild illness characterized by fever (some patients had no fever), cough, sore throat, diarrhea, myal- gias, headache. Other frequent findings have in- cluded chills and malaise. Vomiting and diarrhea have been reported in some patients, but no short- ness of breath, dyspnea, or severe dehydration. 2. Progressive illness characterized by mild illness in addition to signs or symptoms suggesting a pro- gressive illness, which include ( Table 6): a. Chest pain, tachypnea, or labored breathing in children b. Hypotension c. Confusion or altered mental status d. Severe dehydration or exacerbations of a chronic conditions (e.g. asthma, cardiovascular condi- tions) 3.

Under no circumstances should influenza diagnostic tests de- lay initiation of infection control practices or antiviral treatment if 2009 H1N1 pandemic disease is suspect- ed. Laboratory testing should be prioritized to include hospitalized patients; patients where a diagnosis of influenza will inform decisions regarding clinical care, infection control, or management of close contacts; and patients who have died of an acute illness in which in- fluenza was suspected. The gold standard for laboratory diagnosis of the 2009 HINI influenza is the real-time reverse tran- scriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test, using primer and detector sequences tailored to the specific detection of this virus. A number of other diag- nostic tests are available to detect the presence of 2009 HINI influenza in clinical specimens, but they differ in their sensitivity and specificity. Rapid influenza diag- nostic tests are based on various forms of antigen detec- tion and have high specificity (>95%) but variable sen- sitivity (10-70%). Preferred respiratory specimens include a nasopharyngeal swab with synthetic tip (e.g. polyester or dacron), nasal wash, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or endotracheal aspirate. Lower respiratory tract specimens have a higher yield in patients with pneumo- nia due to viral replication in the lower respiratory tract. Many experts advise the use of a combination of na- sopharyngeal swab with oropharyngeal swab. Isolation of HINI virus in cell culture or embryonated eggs is diagnostic for infection, but it may not a yield timely re- sults for clinical management; in addition a negative vi- ral culture does not exclude infection.” All diagnostic laboratory work on clinical sample from patients who are suspected cases of influenza H1N1 virus infection should be done in a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) labora- tory. Growth of H1N1 virus in cell culture or embryo- nated eggs should be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory 60 using BSL-3 practices. Management of 2009 H1N1 influenza The majority of individuals infected with the pandemic HINI influenza A virus can be treated with simple supportive care at home using antipyretics (e.g. acet- aminophen or ibuprofen). Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or aspirin-containing products (e.g. bismuth subsalicy- late, Pepto-Bismol) should not be used in children <18 years due to the risk of Reyes syndrome. Empiric antiviral therapy should be started as soon as possible for persons with suspected probable or con- firmed influenza and:*” Ann Saudi Med 30(1) January-February 2010 www.saudiannals.net Table 6.

Some patients who required intensive care required ad- vanced mechanical ventilation with high-frequency os- cillatory bilevel ventilation and mean airway pressures of 32 to 55 cm/H,O or veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.” Bacterial co-infections likely played a role in almost one-third of fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in the USA. The CDC investigators found evidence of concurrent bacterial infection in lung specimens from 22 of 77 patients (29%) with fatal pandemic H1N1 infection. A total of 10 cases were co-infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 with Streptococcus pyogenes, 7 with Staphylococcus aureus, 2 with Streptococcus mitis and 1 with Hemophilus influenza. Four of the fatal cases involved multiple pathogens. The age of patients ranged from 2 months to 56 years, with a median of 31 years.” Among other complications of pandemic HINI are acute neurologic syndromes reported in four patients aged 7 to 17 years who were admitted with signs of ILI and findings that included seizures or altered mental status in 2 children, encephalitis in 2, and ataxia in 1. Three of the four patients had abnormal electroenceph- alogram (EEG). In all patients pandemic H1N1 viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal specimens but not in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF). All recovered with- out sequelae. The overall case-fatality rate was 0.4% (compared with 2.4% for the 1918-1918 influenza pandemic) based on surveillance data from Mexico and mathematical modeling.” There was a documented underlying medical condition in at least 49% of global documented fatal cases.” Diagnosis When influenza viruses are known to be circulating in the community, patients presenting with mild in- fluenza can be diagnosed on clinical and epidemiologi- cal grounds alone. All patients should be instructed to - Difficult breathing or shortness of breath - Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen - Episodes of sudden dizziness - Severe or continuous vomiting - Influenza-like illness that improves but then returns with fever and cough - Confusion H1N1 Table 7.

However, low-dose steroids may be considered in patient with septic shock who require vasopressors, ^ 6465 Isolation of the hospitalized patient with 2009 H1N1 infection CDC recommends standard, droplet, and contact pre- cautions for care of patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 HINI influenza infection. Health care workers should use surgical masks for routine non-aerosolizing patient care and N95-respirators for aerosol-generating procedures. Isolation precautions should continue for 7 days after illness onset or until 24 hours after the resolu- tion of fever and respiratory symptoms. A longer period of isolation may be considered in the case of young chil- dren and severely immunocompromised patients.” 2009 H1N1 vaccine An effective vaccine is the best tool to prevent the un- predictable spread of the current influenza pandemic. The 2009 H1NI virus has the potential to cause severe disease, death, and potential socioeconomic dysfunc- tion, and mathematical modeling suggests that the ef- fect of the virus can be reduced by immunization. Two types of HINI vaccines which have been pre- pared and have received approval from the FDA or the European Medicine Agency (EMEA) for use in the prevention of influenza caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza A (HINI) virus. Both adjuvanted and un- adjuvanted vaccine formulations are available. An adju- vant is a substance that boosts the immune response. It is made up of naturally occurring oil, water and vi- tamin E. The unadjuvanted vaccine does not include this material. Vaccination campaigns are currently un- derway to protect populations from pandemic H1N1. Preliminary data indicate that both vaccines are safe and immunogenic.?\"' The Advisory Committee on Ann Saudi Med 30(1) January-February 2010 www.saudiannals.net with antiviral prophylaxis, and three had no history of exposure to oseltamivir. Resistance was associated with the common H275Y mutation with retention of zanamivir susceptibility.\" Antiviral therapy is most ef- fective when started within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms; however, evidence suggests that treat- ment“? may benefit patients with prolonged or severe illness even when started more than 48 hours after the onset of illness. Ihe recommended duration of treat- ment is 5 days. Hospitalized patients with severe in- fection might require longer antiviral courses. Some experts have advocated use of doubled doses of oselta- mivir in critically ill patient despite lack of published date about efficacy. Zanavimir inhaled formulation is not designed to be used in any nebulizer or mechani- cal ventilator”? as there is a risk that the lactose drug carrier can obstruct ventilator equipment. For patients who are unable to take oral medication or in whom oral medication appears to be ineffective, peramavir, an investigational neuraminidase inhibitor formu- lated for intravenous administration, can be requested from the CDC under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and emergency use authorization, although studies on efficacy and safety are limited. ^^ Symptomatic patients who have highly suspected or documented oseltamivir resistance should not be treated with peramivir because strains with the H275Y mutation have demonstrated reduced in vitro susceptibility to peramivir. These patients should be treated with intravenous zanamivir, which is an inves- tigational drug that can be requested from FDA for compassionate use.*^*' The CDC suggests limiting the use of antiviral chemoprophylaxis to specific groups. Antiviral doses recommended for treatment and pro- phylaxis of 2009 H1N1 influenza in adult and chil- dren are listed in Table 8. Clinicians should consider empiric treatment with antibacterial drugs if bacterial co-infections is suspected during or after influenza. Antibiotic selection should take into consideration local data regarding frequency of pathogens causing secondary infection and the pattern of drug resistance. When pneumonia is present, treatment with antibiot- To date, less than ten suspected cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported in people who have re- ceived vaccines. These numbers are in line with normal background rates of this illness as recently reported. All such cases are been investigated to determine whether these are randomly occurring events or whether they might be associated with vaccination.” WHO has re- ceived no reports of fatal outcome or confirmed cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome since the HIN1 vaccina- tion campaigns began. All cases have recovered. Intense active monitoring for rare adverse reactions of HIN1 vaccine is ongoing, but all data compiled to date indi- cate that pandemic H1N1 vaccines match the excellent safety profile of the seasonal influenza vaccines that has been used for more than 60 years.” HINI Immunization Practice (ACIP) recommends that vac- cination efforts should focus initially on persons in five target groups at high risk for influenza-related compli- cations (Table 9).” People who have had egg allergies should not receive the HINI vaccine without first consultation a physi- cian because the viruses for the vaccine are grown in chicken-egg-based cultures. On November 19, 2009, the WHO estimated that around 80 million doses of pandemic vaccine had been distributed globally and around 65 million people had been vaccinated. The side-effect profile of the HIN1 vaccine (adjuvanted and unadjuvanted) particularly the frequency and severity of solicited adverse events is consistent with previous experience with seasonal influenza vaccine. 33.

On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic alert level to phase 6, indicating a global pandemic. By December 2009, more than 208 countries and territories had reported swine flu cases. The descriptive epidemiology of the first reported 100 cases of this virus in Saudi Arabia are summarized in this report. METHODS: Data were collected from 1 June to 3 July, 2009 using a predesigned questionnaire. Questionnaires were filled by Field Epidemiology Training Program residents. Data for the first 100 complete cases of confirmed pandemic influenza A (H1N1) were compiled and analyzed. RESULTS: The age of reported cases was in the range of 1 to 56 years. The highest percentage of cases was in the age group of 20 to 30 years followed by the age group of 1 to 10 years. Females represented 55% of the cases; imported cases represented 47%, 58% of whom had come via the King Khaled Airport. The most common na- tionalities most were from Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. The main symptoms were fever (56%), cough (54%), and sore throat and the number of cases was seen to peak from the 27 to 29 June. CONCLUSION: Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) is still a threat to Saudi Arabia. Thus, comprehensive and effec- tive measures for surveillance and prevention of the disease are needed to control its spread. of late June, the WHO reported that pandemic influ- enza A (H1N1) had been confirmed in almost 60000 people in more than 100 countries, and 263 deaths were confirmed to have been caused by the disease. On June 11, 2009, the WHO raised the pandemic alert level to phase 6 (indicating a global pandemic). By December 2009, more than 208 countries and territories had re- ported swine flu cases. Symptoms of the 2009 “swine flu” pandemic influ- enza A (H1N1) virus in humans are similar to those of seasonal influenza and of influenza-like illness in general. They include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. However, the 2009 outbreak has shown an increased percentage of patients reporting diarrhea and vomiting.’ In children, signs of severe disease include apnea, tachypnea, dyspnea, cya- nosis, dehydration, altered mental status, and extreme irritability.” Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (swine flu) tends to cause high morbidity but low mortality rates (1-496). The most common cause of death is respiratory wine influenza during the 1918 flu pandemic infected one-third of the world's population (an estimated 500 million people) and caused ap- proximately 50 million deaths.’ In 1976, an outbreak of swine influenza occurred in New Jersey, USA, which involved more than 200 cases, some of them severe, re- sulting in one death.’ In 1988, another fatality was re- ported as a complication of swine influenza. From 2005 until January 2009, 12 human cases of swine flu were reported in the USA, but none were fatal.’ In 2009, cas- es of influenza-like illness were first reported in Mexico on March 18; the outbreak was subsequently confirmed as pandemic influenza A (HINI). Until early May, nearly 600 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) cases had been confirmed in Mexico, including 25 deaths.’ In late April, the WHO declared a “public health emergency of international concern” under the rules of the WHO's new International Health Regulations when the first few cases of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus were reported in the United States.” As Ann Saudi Med 30(1) January-February 2010 www.saudiannals.net 04 H1N1 IN SAUDI ARABIA METHODS Data were collected using a predesigned question- naire. The first 114 confirmed pandemic influenza A (HINI) cases were identified from the Ministry of Health (MOH) Infectious Diseases Department data- base during the period ranging from June 1 to July 3, 2009. Questionnaires with cover letters were sent to the designated hospitals for data collection. Patient medical records were the source of data. Questionnaires were filled by Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) residents in collaboration with medical colleagues from those hospitals. Data for the first 100 complete cases of confirmed pandemic influenza A (H1N1) were com- piled and analyzed using the Epi Info program. None of the first 100 cases were severe cases and there were no deaths. RESULTS We were able to complete a questionnaire for the first 100 cases of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) from dif- ferent hospitals. The age of the cases ranged between 1 and 56 years with a mean (SD) of 24.2 (14.4) years. Ihe highest percentage of cases were in the age group of 20 to 30 years (3596) followed by the age group of 1 to 10 years (22%). There were 45 males and 55 females (Table 1). Fifty-three percent of the cases had some history of contact with diseased persons inside Saudi Arabia while 4796 had traveled into Saudi Arabia. The most common national origins were Saudi Arabia and the Philippines (Figure 1). Ihe symptoms reported by the cases were fever (56%), cough (54%), sore throat (32%), rhinitis (17%), and difficulty breathing (8%) (Figure 2). The peak in the number of cases appeared between June 27 and 29. (Figure 3). Fifty-eight percent of the cases had entered the country through King Khalid Airport in Riyadh, 16% through King Fahad Airport in the Eastern region, and 14% through King Abdul Aziz Airport in Jeddah (Figure 4). DISCUSSION As of September 27, 2009, there have been more than 340 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic influ- enza A HINI 2009 worldwide and over 4100 deaths have been reported to the WHO. As many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly the milder illnesses, the case count is significantly lower than the actual number of cases that have occurred. Health authorities in Saudi Arabia kept a high level of alertness in monitoring the situation of pandemic in- Huenza A (H1N1) all over the world especially during Ann Saudi Med 30(1) January-February 2010 www.saudiannals.net original article Table 1.

The first 100 cases of pandemic influenza A (HINI) were mostly among youth aged less than 40 years. A characteristic feature of the pandemic influen- za A (HINI) is that it has mostly involved children and young adults. Similar results were observed in different 30 2 v E] nm S = o E] 2 3 3 z parts of the world: in Europe, the age of confirmed cas- m es ranged between 1 and 53 years with a median of 23 years.

We report the rate of such transmission among a co- hort of HIV-infected women enrolled in an HIV program at a tertiary care facility in Riyadh. METHODS: All HIV-infected women who became pregnant and delivered during their follow-up between January 1994 and June 2006 were included in this study. HIV viral load and CD4+ T-lymphocyte count near- term, the mode of delivery, and the HIV status of the newborn at 18 months were recorded. All women were counseled and managed according to the three-step PACTG 076 protocol. RESULTS: Of 68 HIV-infected women in the cohort, 31 had 40 pregnancies; one aborted at 13 weeks gestation. The mode of delivery was elective cesarean delivery in 28 pregnancies (7096) at 36 weeks gestation, and 11 (27.5%) had normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. The median CD4+ T-lymphocyte count near-term was 536 cells per cubic millimeter and the median viral load for 25 pregnancies was 1646 copies/mL, with only nine pregnancies (22.5%) having viral loads of more than 1000 copies/mL. Fourteen pregnancies (35%) had undetect- able HIV prior to delivery. All patients were taking antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and delivery. All 39 newborns tested negative for HIV infection at the age of 18 months; none of the newborns was breastfed. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous local experience, diagnosis, management, and antiretroviral therapy almost eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in our patient population. MTCT is reported to be 15% to 30 96.5 The Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) Protocol 076 demonstrated that a three-part regimen that included zidovudine, another nucleoside reverse transcriptase in- hibitor and a protease inhibitor could reduce the risk of MTCT of the HIV virus by nearly 7096.7? Data on the epidemiology of HIV-1 infection from the Middle East are limited. An 18-year surveillance of the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in Saudi Arabia showed 1285 citizens to be infected with the HIV vi- rus: 26.5% of them were women, mostly in the repro- ductive age group; 12.1% were children younger than 14 years old, and more than 5396 of infected children had acquired the virus from their mothers.\" In another report from Riyadh, perinatal transmission accounted for 63% of all HIV infections in children.\" Reports on pregnancy outcome in women who are HIV-infected other-to-child transmission (MTCT) of the M immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was noted very early in the history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).^ As the epi- demic of HIV/AIDS grew, women constituted 5096 of infected people, and up to 6096 in certain developing countries. Subsequently, MTCT now is the cause of al- most all pediatric HIV infections.” There is clinical and laboratory evidence to support several possible mecha- nisms for MTCT, including maternal disease state and viral load, fetal exposure to infected maternal body flu- ids during gestation and delivery, as well as breastfeed- ing. There is now sufficient evidence to suggest that transmission during late pregnancy and the intrapartum period contributes relatively more to the overall rate of vertical transmission than during the early intrauterine period.® In the absence of any intervention, the rate of Ann Saudi Med 30(1) January-February 2010 www.saudiannals.net MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION OF HIV Elective cesarean delivery was recommended until 2003 after which, vaginal delivery became the standard in mothers with viral load below 1000 copies/mL, unless the patient opted for cesarean delivery. RESULTS Thirty-one women with 40 pregnancies were identified as fitting the inclusion criteria for the study. One preg- nancy aborted at 13 weeks gestation, the patient had a viral load of 3607 at that time and she was treatment- naive. The reason for the abortion was unclear. The mode of delivery was elective cesarean delivery in 28 pregnan- cies (70%) at 36 weeks gestation; 11 (27.5%) had nor- mal spontaneous vaginal delivery. The median CD4+ T-lymphocyte count at about the time of delivery was 536 cells/mm? (mean 574, range 183-1142 cells/mm’), and the median viral load at about delivery time for 25 pregnancies was 1646 copies/mL (73-59071), with only 9 (22.5%) pregnancies having viral loads of more than 1000 copies/mL. Fourteen pregnancies (35%) were re- ceiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), had undetectable HIV prior to delivery. All were on anti- retroviral therapy during pregnancy and delivery. All the newborns were tested at the end of 18 months and tested negative for the HIV-1 screening and PCR assay. Breast feeding was strictly prohibited and complied with by the patients in the study. DISCUSSION In a study looking at horizontal versus vertical transmis- sion in 19 HIV-infected people and their contacts, Al Nozha et al found that all nine children born to HIV- infected mothers were HIV-infected. None of the mothers were aware of their serostatus, and none had received antiretroviral therapy, or avoided breast feeding. Our data in this study demonstrate reassuringly success- ful prevention methods for MTCT. While looking at the reasons for HIV testing in Saudi Arabia, Alrajhi et al^ showed that the majority of the women with HIV in- fection acquired the infection from their husbands. Both the natural instincts for motherhood and social pres- sures culminated in pregnancies in our Saudi popula- tion of HIV-infected women. Counseling for conception and childbirth is an essential component of healthcare provided to HIV-infected women. The majority of the pregnancies in our report were planned and coordinated with care providers to ensure tolerance, adherence, and response to antiretroviral therapy before conception. In our hospital, we follow the Public Health Service Task Force recommendations for the management of pregnant HIV-infected women. Our comprehensive care team Ann Saudi Med 30(1) January-February 2010 www.saudiannals.net original article from the region and from Saudi Arabia are limited. We present the data on pregnancy outcome for HIV- infected women who delivered at our facility. METHODS King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC) is one of the referral centers for HIV- infected individuals in Saudi Arabia. The HIV Service of the Section of Infectious Diseases follows more than 500 HIV-infected adults. The screening test was done using AxSYM\" HIV 1/2 gO MEIA (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA), is used to confirm the diagnosis of HIV infection. Abbot real-time PCR assay (Abbott RealTime M2000 rt, Abbott Laboratories, Abbort Park, Illinois, USA) is used used for the quantitation of HIV- 1 virus. The lower limit of HIV viral load with this assay is 40 copies/mL. CD4+ count is done by standard flow cytometry using FACSCalibur™ (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Data were available for 102 HIV-infected women who were registered in the clinic. Sixty-eight were married, 13 were single, 17 were widowed, and 4 were divorced at the time of the study. Women older than 55 years of age, and pregnancies and deliveries that occurred before referral to our institution were excluded from the study. Data on demographics, number of pregnancies between January 1994 and June 2006, abortions, and mode of de- livery were collected. Information was obtained about the use of zidovudine, viral load, and CD4+ T-lymphocyte count at about 36 weeks of gestation. Charts of the new- born were reviewed to collect data on the results of HIV antibody screening and HIV PCR at 18 months of age. All women included in this study had been managed according to the three-step PACTG 076 protocol.” The antenatal component consisted of 300 mg zidovudine orally twice daily, initiated between 14 and 34 weeks gestation (if not already on antiretroviral therapy"
