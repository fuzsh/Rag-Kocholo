        "text": "Geochemical and mineralogical analyses of bottom sediments collected from Al-Shuaiba (SHL) and Al-Mejarma (MJL) coastal lagoons, Red Sea were carried out. Mineralogically, the sediments consist mainly of carbonate minerals particularly aragonite, high and low Mg-calcite and traces of dolomite admixed with non-carbonate minerals including quartz, k-feldspars, plagioclase and traces of amphiboles, mica and clay minerals. The spatial distribution of major and trace elements at the bottom of the lagoons indicates two groups of elements. The first, less significant, is of terrigenous origin concentrates mainly in the shoreward direction. This group includes the silicates (Al2O3-Fe2O3-SiO2), Feldspars (K2O-Rb-Ba) and heavy minerals (V-Cr-Zr, TiO2-Y-Nb) related elements. The second most dominant group is the carbonate related elements (CaO-Sr) that concentrates in the seaward direction. The two lagoons are not affected by urbanization or anthropogenic impact, and hence the siliciclastic el...\n\nBottom sediments of Al-Kharrar Lagoon, Rabigh area, Saudi Arabia were analyzed for mineralogical (26 samples) and major oxides, minor, and trace elements (46 samples). The prime objective is to document the controlling factors of the mineralogical and chemical composition of the lagoon bottom sediments. Hierarchical cluster (HCA) and the principal component (PCA) analyses are used to disclose the degree of similarities among elements to distinguish them into statistically significant groups. Results clarified the interplay of terrestrial sediment influx through the temporarily active Wadi Rabigh, hydrological regime and the autochthonous biogenic sedimentation, and to a lesser extent rare anthropogenic influence that impacted the lagoon sediments. The spatial distribution of minerals shows a southward increase in the siliciclastic-related minerals (quartz, clay minerals, k-feldspars, and plagioclase along with traces of amphiboles), whereas carbonate minerals (high Mg-calcite and ar...\n\nA lack of understanding exists of the origin and textural characteristics of Saudi Arabian Red Sea coastal sediments. This paper concerns the southern coastline of Jizan on the Saudi Red Sea. It is some 160 km long characterised by either narrow rocky headlands with intermittent pocket beaches or wide low-lying beaches dissected by wadis. Granulometric testing of samples from 135 locations showed that beach sand size was mainly very fine to medium grained (Mz = 3.93 Ø), sorting ranged from 1.65 to 0.41 and skewness values from −051 to 0.39, being mainly negative; dune sands were medium to fine grained (Mz = 1.13 Ø; average sorting 2.8), while skewness variations within dune samples indicated symmetrical to fine skewed values (бΙ = 0.55 to 0.89). Most foreshore samples were derived from wadis. Wadi mud levels can be high, e.g. Baysh (84%), and wadi Samrah (90%) with mean grain size ranging from very fine to medium sand (Mz = 3.9 Ø), sorting being well to poor (0.45 to 1.52) due to sediment influxes. Sabkha had a wide range of sand/mud and significantly higher carbonate percentages than other environments. Sediment source differences and littoral reworking contributed to grain size variation. The carbonate content varied between 1.5 and 31.5% due to hinterland contributions, and spatial analysis showed increasing quantities of carbonate minerals towards the south. On the wider geographical front, findings from Jizan are similar to those of the Northern United Arab Emirates (UAE), including sabkhas, being composed of sand, skeletal carbonate, fine fluvial material and wind-blown silt and clay components of wadi origin. Further work on the northeastern Red Sea edge can hopefully confirm these findings."
