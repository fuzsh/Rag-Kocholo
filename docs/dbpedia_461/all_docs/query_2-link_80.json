        "text": "Introduction: Lambda-cyhalothrin is a type II pyrethroid insecticide and may cause liver damage. Solanum nigrum may act as hepatoprotective agent; therefore we aimed to study the effect of solanum nigrum (dried fruits or its ethanolic extract) against lambda cyhalothrin toxicity in rats. Materials and Methods: Thirty three male Sprague Dawlay rats were divided into 6 groups (G1: normal; G2 & 3: normal treated with ethanolic extract of the dried fruits, and dried fruits respectively; G4: normal rats intoxicated with Lambda cyhalothrin; G5 & 6: as G2 & 3 but intoxicated with lambda cyhalothrin. At the end of the experiment (6 weeks), the rats were sacrificed and blood was taken for the determination of AST, ALT, Alk Ph, LDH, Hb, Hct, MCH, MCHC and RBC count. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured in serum and brain. Results and Discusion: A significant decrease in body weight, Hb and Hct level was observed in G4 (Lambda cyhalothrin intoxicated rats). The intoxicated groups (G 5 & 6) treated with ethanolic extract or dried fruits of Solanum nigrum showed an improvement of body weight, Hb and Hct where a significant increase compared to G4 but still significantly lower than G1 was observed trying to return to normal or near normal level. A significant increase in AST, ALT and Alk Ph level was observed in G4. Group 5 & 6 showed an improvement of AST, ALT and Alk Ph level where a significant decrease compared to G4, but still significantly higher than G1, was observed trying to return to normal or near normal. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that S. nigrum fruits or alcoholic extract was able to reverse the pathological parameters and may be useful as an antioxidant and hepatoprotective agent.\n\nFormalin is a constituent from many item of daily use including foods, Thus this study aimed to evaluate the histological changes induced by formalin on the kidney of adult male mice and evaluating the possible ameliorative role of salvia officinalis. Healthy male albino mice 8-10 weeks old weighting 24 - 30 gm were divided equally into four groups (n = 15 per group). The first group was given only the standard diet and served as the control, the second group was treated orally with aqueous extract of S. officinalis leaves (120 mg/kg bw.) for 3 successive weeks , the third group was administered with formalin (2.4 ml/kg body weight ) in drinking water for 3 successive weeks and the fourth group was Co-treated with formalin and S. officinalis. The specimens of kidney were processed for histological study by light microscopy. Histological examinations revealed that administration of formalin only exhibited marked glomerular and tubular lesion included vacuolization and swelling the lining epithelium of tubules, inflammatory cells infiltration and hemorrhage in the interstitial tissue, necrotic or desquamation lining epithelium in the luminal tubules, intratubular esinophilic casts in some renal tubules, completely obscured or stenosis urinary space of renal corpuscles, shrinkage glomeruli of some renal corpuscles with widening urinary space, many glomeruli appeared with less cellularily, dilation and congestion blood vessels. In contrast administration of S. officinalis along with formalin induced ameliorating change in renal tissue of formalin intoxicated mice.\n\nIncreased use of pesticides all over the world is alarming and has attracted researchers due to the adverse effect on vital organs and reproduction. Cypermethrin is a synthetic Pyrethroid. The use of natural antioxidants in the reduction of oxidative stress and liver injury is gaining awareness because they are less expensive, readily available and exhibit no adverse effects. This research was thus undertaken to evaluate the hepatotoxicity of Cypermethrin and the inhibitory effect of Lycopene. All biomarkers in the group administered Cypermethrin only, showed significantly (p˂0.05) elevated levels of biomarkers, necrosis, degeneration of hepatocytes, infiltration of lymphocytes in the portal vein, indicating that Cypermethrin induced oxidative stress and liver injury in the exposed rats.A comparison of the trend in the levels of liver biomarkers and Histopathological micrographs of the other groups studied strongly suggests that processed Solanumlycopersicum possesses antioxidant capability , inhibits Cypermethrin – induced stress, provides a boost for healing of the liver injury via mitotic division of hepatocytes and its regeneration. lt is concluded that , full potential of antioxidant activity in fresh S.lycopersicum cannot be unlocked because mammals lack cellulase. Thus, its efficacy is highest in pure lycopene ˃processed˃fresh fruits.\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate the toxic influences of cyfluthrin pesticide and ameliorated their effects by Solenostemma argel as antioxidant agents on blood glucose, liver glycogen, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), and hexokinase (HK) activities as well as lactate and pyruvate contents of liver, brain and kidneys. The S. argel potency as antioxidant was determined by DPPH and ABTS in aqueous and methanolic extracts. Results showed that pesticide ingestion increased blood glucose but decreased liver glycogen. Activity of LDH was inhibited but HK and PK activities were stimulated also lactate and pyruvate content were reduced in all tissues. Treatments reduced these disturbances of the cyfluthrin effects on above glycolytic enzymes and metabolites in the all organs tissue. It can be concluded that S. argel methanolic extract treatments as antioxidant agent improved the disturbed carbohydrate metabolism induced by cyfluthrin than aqueous extract.\n\nSolanum nigrum belongs to family Solanaceae. Blacknightshade & Makoi are the common name for it. The chemical constituents commonly found in Solanum nigrum are glycoalkaloids, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, polyphenolic compounds such as gallic acid, cathechin, protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, epicatechin, rutin etc. Solanum nigrum has very much importance as a medicinal plant. Root, whole plant and leaves are used but fruits of black colour are not used as they possess toxicity, therefore they are not used for medicinal purposes. Reddish-brown coloured fruits are used for edible purpose. It has been also extensively used in traditional medicine In India and other parts of world to cure liver disorders, digestion, chronic skin ailments, inflammatory conditions, painful periods, fevers, diarrhoea, eye disease, hydrophobia etc. Extracts prepared with using spices condiments exhibited stomach disorders and also improved digestion activity as compared to other digestive pills.\n\nAims and objectives: 1 To evaluate the antidiabetic effect of polyherbal extract in comparison with Gliclazide 2 To evaluate the effect of polyherbal extract on serum creartinine, CRP levels and WBC counts in comparison with standard drug Gliclazide in alloxan induced diabetic Rats Materials and method: Rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, each comprising 6 rats. Group 1-Normal control distilled water, Group 2 – standard drug gliclazide 25mg/kg, Group 3 – Polyherbal extract (T1)– 300mg/kg, group 4 – Polyherbal extract (T2)– 400mg/kg, Group 5 – Polyherbal extract (T3)– 500mg/kg was administered orally for 45 days. The fasting blood glucose, HbA1c values, S.Creatinine, CRP levels and WBC counts were estimated in both normal and alloxan induced diabetic rats. Results: The percentage reduction in FBS after 45days of treatment in T1, T2, T3 and standard groups is 31.9%, 34.4%, 50.7% and 61.03% respectively, and difference between groups is statistically significant, P value <0.0001 ***. Regarding HbA1c levels, the percentage reduction in T1, T2, T3 & standard groups is 33.3%(P 0.0006 ***), 40.1%(P<0.0001 ***), 43.6%(P<0.0001 ***) & 45%(P<0.0001 ***) respectively, there is significant statistical difference between different groups before and after treatment. The percentage reduction in S. Creatinine values in T1, T2, T3 and standard groups is 41.5%, 57.4%, 68.32% & 69.5% respectively with statistically significant difference between study groups, P value <0.0001. *** Similarly in case of WBC counts, the percentage reduction in T1, T2, T3 & standard groups is 25.24%, 33.27%,37.83% & 39.17% respectively during the study period, and there is statistically significant difference between different study groups with P value 0.0007. *** With regard to serum CRP levels, the percentage reduction in T1, T2, T3 & standard groups is 42.7%(P 0.0015 **), 48.6%(P 0.0003 ***), 54.1%(P<0.0001 ***) and 53.1%(P<0.0001 ***) respectively with statistical significant difference in each group before and after treatment. Conclusion: The polyherbal extract showed excellent antidiabetic potential and its effect is comparable with Gliclazide in alloxan induced diabetic rats. Extract also showed significant reduction in S.Creatinine, CRP and WBC counts in diabetic rats after treatment.\n\nThe hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic andhypoch olesterolemia effects of the methanol extractsof leaf and stem bark of Bucholziacoriaceawere studied in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic male wister rats. The result of the phytochemical screening of the extracts revealed that the leaf contains tannins, saponins, terpenes and terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, balsam, phenols and resins. On the other hand, the stem bark contains alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, terpenes and terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, balsam, phenols and resins. The following biochemical parameters were determined in the serum using standard laboratory procedure, glucose, total protein, urea, creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were determined. Also, the serum electrolytes like sodium. Potassium, calcium, chloride, and bicarbonate were determined. The leaf and stem bark extracts were prepared in two concentrations of 150 and 250mg/kg body weight. Each sample with its respective concentrations were administered to diabetic groups intraperitoneally for 14 days. The results of the treatment of the diabetic groups at the different concentrations of the extracts shows significant decrease (p<0.05) in the elevated blood levels of glucose, urea, creatinine, cholesterol, triglyceride, haemoglobin, aspartate amino transferase and alanine transferase associated with streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. On the other hand, there were significant increase (p<0.05) in the levels of chloride, potassium and calcium levels when diabetic groups were treated at both concentrations of samples. From the study, the methanol leaf and stem bark extracts of Bucholziacoriacea have proven to be effective as hypoglycemic, hypocholestelaemic and hypotriglyceridaemic agent and therefore, may be used for the management of diabetes mellitus.\n\nCypermethrin is a type II synthetic pyrethroid prescribed for bed nets for neonates, infants and adults.This study aimed at evaluating its reproductive toxicity and therapeutic effect of co-administration of Lycopene on male rats. Histopathological evaluation of the testes revealed approximately 40% loss of germ cells including interstitial cells of Leydig and Sertoli cells. Luminal diameter increased with complete loss of spermatozoa indicating the inhibition of maturation and differentiation of secondary spermatocytes into mature spermatozoa. The seminiferous epithelium became sparsely populated due to mitotic inhibition. Animals co-administered Lycopene recovered as observed bythe regenerationof all spermatogenic elements. it is concluded that processed Solanum lycopersicum and its pure extract exhibited a therapeutic effect on Cypermethrin –induced reproductive toxicity. It is also worthy of note that fresh fruits of Solanum lycopersicum possess some form of lycopene but require further processing to make it bioavailable to mammals lacking Cellulase.\n\nIn the present investigation cytot-genoxicity of aqueous extracts of ten medicinal plants viz. Syzyum aromaticum (Clove), Oxalis corniculata, Solanum nigrum, Azadirachta indica, Bauhinia variegate, Coriander sativum, Anisomeles indica, Terminallia bellerica, Ocimum sanctum and Citrus sinensis was evaluated on newly growing Allium cepa roots at three different concentrations. The results revealed that the aqueous leaf extracts caused a significant inhibition in the number and growth rate of Allium cepa roots in comparison to negative and positive control. The aqueous leaf extracts caused strong inhibition of dividing cells and mitotic index (MI) values. The chromosomal breaks showed the clastogenic effect of aqueous leaf extracts. The occurrence of chromosome fragments showed statistically significant differences at various concentrations. The stickiness of metaphase chromosomes and polar deviations were observed. A statistically significant increase in total aberrant cells (P < .05) was observed in comparison to the negative control. The aqueous leaf extracts showed the strongest genotoxic effects in the root meristem cells. The appearance of sticky metaphase chromosomes reinforces the hypothesis of the toxic effect of leaf extracts. Metaphases with sticky chromosome loses their normal appearance, and with a sticky \"surface,\" they cause chromosome agglomeration."
