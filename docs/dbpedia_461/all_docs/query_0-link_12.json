        "text": "To read Duncan Irving’s play-by-play narration of the action from Jakarta — where Iraq won today’s Asian Cup final — written live, as it happened, click “read more” below. And stay tuned for further updates on the reaction from Iraq.\n\nFinal thoughts: Congratulations to Iraq. They made up for some callow defending with determination, heart and fitness — and these guys were scarily fit. They looked desperate at the back at times, but the Saudis, who kept their shape better, never really got out of first gear. Perhaps Al Qahtani was well below his best, but they really can’t argue with the outcome.\n\nThat’s it from me. Thanks for joining us today. If you want to catch a replay, Setanta is showing it at 3pm eastern. Their website has a venue finder (//www.setanta.com). You might just have bit more luck persuading a barkeep to change the channel at a more civilized hour. Cheerio.\n\n**************\n\nAnd now … a giant silver goblet is presented to Younis Mahmoud. The lights dim, the fireworks go off … and on comes Queen!!! It’s the same the world over isn’t it? “We Are The Champions.” The Iraqis leave the podium, place the trophy on the ground and dance around it in a circle, all while being besieged by photographers and two guys wielding confetti machines.\n\nMore pewter goblets, but this time with million-dollar smiles. They’re on the podium now, dancing away.\n\nThey’re collecting pewter goblets that look like they’ve been bought wholesale at Crate and Barrel. And here come the Iraqis …\n\nMore dancing and more awards — fair play goes to Japan, and those hometown Aussie announcers are gushing over Mark Shield, who’s getting his medal. At last …. the Saudis head on up.\n\nAl Qahtani picks up the golden boot award as top scorer with four goals. Hold on a minute, says Younis Mahmoud, who also ended with four. He gets on the dais, and his teammates are laughing at him. Younis Mahmoud picks up the tournament MVP honors and a $25,000 check.\n\nNow come the FIFA suits and the official handover to 2011 host Qatar. Under the rules of this competition, the top three finishers receive a bye to appearing at that tournament, which means that Iraq, Saudi Arabia and South Korea (who defeated Japan 6-5 on penalties yesterday after a 0-0 tie) will all be back.\n\nThe Iraqi players and staff hold hands and dance in a circle. Jassim Gholam stands in the middle waving a giant Iraqi flag.\n\nOn the field in Jakarta, Younis Mahmoud and Hawer Mohamed are locked in a long embrace in the center circle. They’re ready to pick up the trophy. And now they’re enjoying a group dance while they wait. Saudi players, who look absolutely gutted are waiting, too. They’re missing out on winning a fourth title here; this, of course, is the Iraqis’ first.\n\nAn update from Amman, Jordan: Our colleague Damien Cave has been watching with 300 Iraqis in a cafe in Amman; he reports pandemonium of cheering, hugging and weeping at the final whistle\n\n90+3 Final Score: Iraq 1, Saudi Arabia 0. The Iraqi players are heaped in the center circle weeping. At the far end, Iraqi fans are unfurling flags and screaming. Nashat is named man of the match amid all the chaos. The Iraqi players have a giant flag and are performing a lap of honor.\n\n90+2 Noor Abbas nearly gifts Saudi Arabia an equalizer, racing out to pick off a cross. He misses it and Al Hawsawi’s header bounces in front of an open goal and over the bar.\n\n90+1Iraq coach Yorvan Vieira is bouncing up and down on the sideline, trying to hold it together here. I don’t blame him — his defense is holding on (just) and his striker has nothing in the tank.\n\n90 There will be three minutes of stoppage time.\n\n90 Substitution Iraq: Mahdi Karim off; Ahmed Abid Ali on.\n\n89 Iraq’s Hawer Mohamed breaks again and shoots over. Iraq are enjoying acres on the counter, but Younis Mahmoud is doing the defense’s work for them.\n\n88 Free kick to Saudi Arabia and the Iraqis look vulnerable. Jassim’s headed clearance looks strong and Ali Abbas breaks, runs 60 yards, turns and hits a sublime ball to Younis Mahmoud. His first touch sends it squirting into the air and he tries to save face with the weakest of headers.\n\n87 Substitution Iraq: Bassim Abbas off; Ali Abbas on.\n\n83 Bassim Abbas goes down with a pulled hamstring and Iraq doesn’t have anyone ready. The defending is muddled but they scrap their way to clearing the ball.\n\n82 Younis Mahmoud, who’s bound for Lyon, gets in a wonderful space in the box but prefers to cut the ball back for Mahdi Karim who shoots wide.\n\n82 Substitution Saudi Arabia: Al Bahari off; Saad Al Harthi on. Saudi Arabia throws another forward into the mix.\n\n80 Substitution Iraq: Karrar Jassim off; Ahmed Mendajed on.\n\n78 Khaled Aziz takes a tumble in the box and demands a penalty. No dice.\n\n75 Younis Mahmoud should have put this one away here, going one on one with Al Mosailem, but he hits it at the keeper. The Iraqis try to put away the loose ball but the striker prefers to dive for a penalty — he doesn’t get it, though.\n\n73 Substitution Saudi Arabia: Taiseer Al Jassem off; Abdoh Autef on\n\n72 Yellow card Iraq: Ali Rehema on Khaled Aziz. Predictably, Saudi Arabia are stung into attack, and those desperate Iraqi challenges come flying in. Referee Shield lets a couple go, but can’t ignore this one.\n\n71 GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL!!!!!!! Saudi Arabia 0-1 Iraq. Oh dear, poor old goalie Al Mosailem flies out at the far post and completely misses the ball. Younis Mahmoud doesn’t, and he leaps high and thumps a free header into the back of the net.\n\n70 Corner Iraq after another quickie breakaway. It’s a corner and ….\n\n69 Has to be said that the Iraqis are very very fit. They ran the Koreans ragged in the semifinal. Then again, who needs fitness when you’ve got Ali Rehema to send in a near-suicidal backpass? Noor Sabri struggles but beats out Al Hawsawi.\n\n67 Malek Al Hawsawi breaks and puts one over the bar.\n\n65 Man, what a miss!! Hawar Mohamed completely flubs an open shot on goal, but recovers and puts the ball back in the Saudi box. Younis Mahmoud ghosts between two defenders and heads wide.\n\n62 Al Mosailem makes a pair of brilliant saves from Younis Mahmoud and Nashat Akram after an Iraqi counter. The counter was all of 70 yards. Corner Iraq. Headed on at the near post but Karrar Jassem is seconds too late at the far post to put the ball away.\n\n57 What a save by Noor Sabri!! Taiseer Al Jassam smacks in a dipping volley from about 35 yards that the Iraqi keeper palms wide.\n\n55 There’s a lot of midfield head tennis at the moment. It’s like a training exercise and not much fun to watch. But wait … here’s Iraq’s Younis Mahmoud haring into the box, takes on one, takes on two and lofts a really rubbish ball to the far post and out for a goal kick. What was that? A cross? A shot?\n\n49 Free kick to Iraq. It’s not a great one from Nashat but he gets the corner.\n\n48 Ali Mousa takes a lump out of Iraq’s Mahdi Karim, who makes a super meal of the challenge. He gets the free kick, and this time Al Mosailem makes a nice save.\n\n46 Nashat has a crack from all of 45 yards that sails over the bar. A good idea because Al Mosailem isn’t the surest keeper. As he immediately proves by bobbling a free kick.\n\n46 Substitution Saudi: Al Qahtani off, Al Mousa on.\n\nYou might like to take a look at notes assembled in Baghdad by the NYT’s bureau staff. They appear in a post below this one, or click on this link.\n\n45+3 Halftime Saudi Arabia 0-0 Iraq. Lots of honest endeavor by both teams here. The midfielders are pretty flimsy, which makes for heart-stopping counters and end to end stuff … but neither team looks capable of finishing.\n\n45+2 Iraq’s Karrar Jassim had made a promising breakaway that sort of ran out of gas, but Saudi’s Aziz crudely chops him down for a dangerous free kick. Iraq’s Nashet wastes this one and it flew toward the running track.\n\n45 There will be three minutes of stoppage time.\n\n44 Saudi’s Al Qahtani gets a good run in on goal, but then the self-styled sniper sees his shot balloon over the bar.\n\n43 Saudi Arabia’s Malek Al Hawsani makes a run on goal but runs into the Iraqi central defenders, who are a pretty imposing pair.\n\n42 Iraq’s Karrar Jassim shoots from long-range, but it goes very wide. That said, Iraq are finishing the first half on a high.\n\n41 Free kick Iraq. Nashat Akram sends it into the box. Younis Mahmoud gets in a strong header but can’t get it on target.\n\n40 Corner Iraq. Really hopeful long ball and Saudi’s Aziz puts it out even though there’s nobody within five yards of him. Khalal Jassim heads the corner at the far post and Saudi keeper Yaser Al Mosailem flubs the grab and the ball squirts behind for another corner … that’s cleared.\n\n38 Yellow card Iraq and Saudi Arabia: Younis Mahmoud for simulation; and Walid Jahdali. Just because … who knows, because the replay shows no contact.\n\n35 Saudi’s Walid Jahdali has clashed with Iraq’s Younis Mahmoud, and the Iraqi goes down clutching his face. I mention this because this has been a physical but clean game so far.\n\n30 This is pretty frenetic stuff here. Saudi Arabia look defensively quite solid but have nothing going on up front. Iraq, meanwhile, favors the last-ditch challenge and the scrappy breakaway. They don’t look overawed, but desperate in their play. If I were a betting man, I’d put my loot on the Saudis. But I wouldn’t bet the farm.\n\n29 Iraq’s Nashat breaks up a counter by hitting Al Qahtani in the solar plexus. The referee sees nothing wrong with this. He has kind of a loose interpretation of legal challenges.\n\n28 So close for Iraq. Jassim cuts in from the left and rides a pair of challenges close to the endline. His snapshot hits the keeper and goes out for a corner.\n\n26 Iraq’s Hawar Mohamed has a run down the left, but he’s finding Khaled Aziz a tough opposite number.\n\n25 Yellow card Iraq Iraq’s Karrar Jassan gets a yellow for tugging on Kharin’s shirt. The ball from Saudi’s Al-Qahtani pings around the box but is cleared. Iraq is gamely defending, but they’re being pushed back. It has a Keystone Cops quality to it, but the defenders are getting it done — for now.\n\n21 Younis Mahmoud makes a breakaway down the left, but the square ball across the box rolls into the keeper’s arms.\n\n19 Iraq’s Bassim Abbas fouls Saud Khariri. There’s a bit of afters in the box here. Al Khatani and Ali Rehena get a good telling off from referee Mark Shield. The free kick is saved easily. Saudi Arabia are beginning to impose a bit of rhythm on the game now.\n\n18 There’s a break in the action whule Iraqi keeper Sabri Noor gets treatment on his ankle. He’s up and just about mobile now.\n\n14 Saudi corner is cleared by the keeper.\n\n11 Yellow card Iraq Qusay Munir, for a two-footed challenge.\n\n8 Overhead kick by Younis goes just wide of the left post,\n\n3 Bright start by the Iraqis here. Good volley by Quasay Munir\n\nFrom 25 yards that blazes over.\n\nLineups\n\nIraq — Noor Sabri Abbas, Gholan, Abbas, Abdul Amer, Rehema, Akram, Mohammed, Karrar Jassim , Mahdi Karim, Quasay Munir, Younis Mahmoud (capt.).\n\nSaudi Arabia — Yassserr Al Mosale, O. Hawsawi, Al Mousa, Al Bahari, Jahdali, Khariri, Aziz, Al Jassam, A. Al Qahtani, Al Hawsawi, Y. Al Qahtani (capt.)\n\nNow the Saudi anthem. Not sure about the size of the crowd here, but organizers were banking on a South Korea-Japan final for a good turnout. It’s actually about half full.\n\nThe BBC reports that there’s a curfew in Iraq with an additional countrywide car ban for two hours during the match. Meanwhile, in Jakarta, Iraq’s national anthem is playing and the players are really belting it out. Fans in the stands hold a banner aloft that reads “Peace for Iraq.”\n\nHello everyone, and welcome to a GOAL blog special — coverage of today’s match between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Duncan Irving watching this one from Brooklyn. A technical note: this match is being transmitted on Setanta, and I believe with my ears that this is an Australian feed. Actually, I know this because they’ve had to wave the flag for the Socceroos, who were a bit of a disappointment. They won’t be cutting in until right before kickoff, which is scheduled for 8:35 eastern. So grab a cup of tea, and join us."
