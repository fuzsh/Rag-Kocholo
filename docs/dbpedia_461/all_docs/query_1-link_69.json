Nor would it have been possible without the efforts of those at the Associated Press, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights to force the US government to release the documents relating to the prisoners in Guantanamo that formed the basis of my research. It's a testament to the importance of the American legal system — and its beleaguered Constitution — that Freedom of Information legislation exists to compel an administration bent on unfettered executive power to release documents which, on close inspection, reveal the errors, ineptitude and cruelty underpinning the Guantanamo regime.

And finally, as with everything I do, this project would not have been possible without the support of my wife Dot and our son Tyler. I dedicate it to Tyler, in the hope that he will grow up to see a more just and less brutal world, to the children of those in Guantanamo, deprived of their fathers for so many years, and, of course, to the prisoners themselves, not only in Guantanamo but also in every other illegal prison established in the wake of 9/11. It's a sign of the current x THE CUANTANAMO FILES US administration's shameful dismissal of established legal principles that, after nearly six }'ears of imprisonment, a book like this is required to tell their stories.

William Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act I, Scene 5 On January 11, 2002, exactly four months after the terrible events of .9/11 , the first of 774 prisoners arrived at a hastily erected prison — Camp X-Ray — located on a US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 1 A territorial anomaly, leased from Cuba since 1903, Guantanamo was specifically chosen as a prison for those captured in the \"War on Terror,\" because it was presumed to be beyond the reach of the American courts. Until recently, it was impossible to tell the stories of these men. Held without charge, without trial, without access to their families, and, initially, without access to lawyers, they are part of a peculiarly lawless experiment conducted by the US administration, which has chosen to disregard both the Geneva Conventions and the established rules of war, holding the men not as criminals or as prisoners of war, but as \"illegal enemy combatants,\" a category of prisoner which is recognized only by the White House and the Pentagon. As the administration fashioned Guantanamo into what Lord Steyn, a British law lord, described as a \"legal black hole,\" 2 those in overall charge of the prison — President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld — maintained such a strict veil of secrecy that for four years they refused even to reveal the names of the prisoners. Although some reporters — in particular, teams at the Washington Post and the British-based website Cageprisoners, run by Muslim volunteers — built up partial lists of the prisoners, and a number of shocking stories were told by some of the 260 prisoners who were released during this period, it was not possible to provide a comprehensive overview of the prisoners and their stories until spring THE CUANTAnAMO FILES xiii 2006, when, in response to Freedom of Information legislation filed by the Associated Press, the Pentagon was forced to reveal the names and nationalities of all the prisoners held in Guantanamo, as well as 7,000 pages of transcripts of tribunals convened by the authorities to assess their status as \"enemy combatants.\" The tribunal process was, like everything else at Guantanamo, both illegal and deeply flawed. The prisoners were not allowed legal representation, and were prevented from seeing the classified evidence against them, which often consisted of allegations based on hearsay or torture, but they were at least allowed to tell their own stories, which were otherwise completely unknown. Through a careful study of these documents, as well as discussions with lawyers representing the prisoners, and an analysis of press reports, interviews with released prisoners and other reports compiled by human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, I have been able to put together the first detailed history of Guantanamo and its prisoners. Beginning with the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, the chapters that follow explain, in detail, the genesis of the prison, its counterparts in Afghanistan, its development from 2002 to the present day, its role as a prison devoted to interrogation and torture, the legal challenges that have been launched against the administration, and the network of secret prisons that underpins Guantanamo's brutal illegality. More importantly, they also tell the stories of the prisoners themselves, allowing them to explain who they are and where and when they were captured. In contrast to the administration's claims that the Guantanamo prisoners are the \"worst of the worst,\" 3 what the stories reveal most of all — filtered through the horrendous abuse to which they have been subjected — is that very few of them had anything to do with 9/11 or al-Qaeda, and the vast majority were either Taliban foot soldiers, recruited to fight an inter-Muslim civil war in Afghanistan that began long before 9/11, or humanitarian aid workers, religious teachers and economic migrants, who were, for the most part, sold to the Americans by their allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan. These findings are similar to the results of a statistical analysis by lawyers at the Seton Hall Law School, who published a ground-breaking report on the prisoners in 2006, but I hope, in xiv THE CUANTAnAMO FILES this book, to bring to life the stories behind these statistics, and to demonstrate the human cost of the administration's ill-conceived and violently executed \"War on Terror.\" 4 For updates on developments at Guantanamo, and additional information not included in this book, see my website <www. andyworthington.co.uk>. Andy Worthington, London, April 2007 1 \"Operation Enduring Freedom Osama Bin Laden: Wanted, Dead, or Alive Guantanamo was not even on the radar, when, on September 17, 2001, President Bush announced that Osama bin Laden was the \"prime suspect\" for the 9/11 operation. Instead, the rhetoric was pure vengeance. \"I want justice,\" the President said. \"And there's an old poster out West, I recall, that said, 'Wanted, Dead or Alive.'\" On September 20, he delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban, telling them to hand over the leaders of al-Qaeda, to close all \"terrorist training camps,\" and to \"hand over every terrorist and every person in their support structure, to appropriate authorities.\" \"The Taliban must act and act immediately,\" he added. \"They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate.\" Anticipating that the Taliban would not comply with these demands, Bush was briefed on the plans for \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" on the following day by General Tommy Franks, the US military commander, who told him that US Central Command \"would destroy the al-Qaeda network inside Afghanistan along with the illegitimate Taliban regime which was harbouring and protecting the terrorists.\" 1 From the beginning, therefore, the administration equated bin Laden with the Taliban, even though this was not an entirely valid assumption. When bin Laden returned to Afghanistan in 1996 (after four years in Sudan, where he had moved after the Saudis exiled him on his return from Afghanistan in 1992), he was regarded with suspicion by the Taliban's leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, who retained a parochial outlook and was, reportedly, furious when bin Laden announced a global jihad against the United States in 1998. 2 THE CUANTANAMO FILES Ironically, when al-Qaeda bombed the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania later that year, Omar was finally drawn into bin Lad en's orbit: he had been in the process of betraying bin Laden to the Saudis, but reneged on the deal after President Clinton ordered air strikes on al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan. Even so, it remained apparent to those who were studying Afghanistan closely that, at the time of \"Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the overlap between the Taliban and al-Qaeda was extremely small. According to a senior US intelligence official, \"In 1996 it was non-existent, and by 2001, no more than 50 people.\" 2 As the plan for the invasion of Afghanistan developed, the administration, anxious to avoid repeating the fate that befell the Soviet Union — losing 25,000 lives in a ten-year war that was ultimately unsuccessful — decided that the best way to \"destroy\" al-Qaeda and the Taliban was through a proxy war, in which a few hundred Special Forces operatives, backed up by substantial, targeted bombing raids, would work with the leaders of the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan (aka the Northern Alliance) to ensure the victory that the loose confederation of anti-Taliban warlords in the north of the country had been striving for over the previous seven years. Whatthis meant in practice was supporting Afghanistan's ethnic minorities — the Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras — against the Pashtun majority in the south and east, crushing the Taliban while attempting to ensure that moderate Pashtun leaders could be found to prevent the northern victors from exacting a terrible revenge on the Pashtun population and starting a whole new cycle of atrocious violence. 3 In order to intervene in Afghanistan's long-standing civil war, it was necessary for the US administration to indulge in a collective bout of amnesia: to forget that, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the US had, through a strategic intermediary — Pakistan's powerful intelligence service, the Inter Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI) — poured billions of dollars into the creation of the mujahideen, 4 a fighting force of tens of thousands of anti-Soviet Muslim warriors, primarily drawn from Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. Some of these — including Osama bin Laden — became so enamored with the notion of a holy war that they went on to form al-Qaeda (\"the base\"), a warrior corps devoted to pursuing \"holy war\" in other Muslim countries.'' \"OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM\" 3 It was also necessary to maintain a good relationship with America's oil-producing friends in Saudi Arabia (and to ignore its funding of the Taliban), and to embrace Uzbekistan's dictator, President Karimov, who had a reputation for boiling dissidents alive, to secure a military base that could be used until the Taliban had been driven from northern Afghanistan. Most important of all, however, was the need to form a strong alliance with Pakistan — until recently something of a pariah state, because of its nuclear program — and to overlook its role in funding and supporting the Taliban. In many ways, Pakistan was the most dubious of all America's new allies. In order to hold onto his position, President Musharraf, the military dictator who had seized power in 1999, was required to juggle a number of potentially lethal factions within Pakistani politics; in particular, the Pashtun sympathizers in the government, the ISI and the military, who, either by stealth or as a long-standing component of Pakistan's foreign policy, were pro-Taliban, and also the country's many militant Islamists, who had been providing the Taliban with a steady stream of foot soldiers through their madrassas (religious schools). Although it was easy for the US administration to threaten to bomb Musharraf \"back to the Stone Age\" if he did not support them, it was by no means clear that this support would be as dependable as they would have liked. b Almost as alarming as these dangerous exercises in realpolitik was the amnesia that was required in order to strike up relationships with the warlords who would fight America's proxy war. The military leader of the Northern Alliance, a charismatic Tajik called Ahmed Shah Massoud, had first encountered the Americans in 1984, when he was fighting the Soviet Union, although he was deprived of American financial assistance at the time because he was implacably opposed to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a warlord favored by the ISI. Gary Schroen, a senior Special Forces operative who directed operations in Afghanistan during the first three months of \"Operation Enduring Freedom,\" resumed contact with Massoud in 1.9%, and for the next five years he and others who were aware of the threats posed by the Taliban and bin Laden tried and failed to secure financial and military support for Massoud's struggle. During a CIA visit to his base in the Panjshir valley> north of Kabul, in October 1999, w'hen his help was sought in tracking down bin Laden, Massoud told the delegation that the US policy was \"doomed to fail,\" because they 4 THE CUANTANAMO FILES failed to see the bigger picture. \"What about the Taliban?\" he asked. \"What about the Taliban's supporters in Pakistani intelligence? What about its financiers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates?\" In November 2000, after al-Qaeda's bombing of the USS Cole, CIA officers drew up a wish list for Massoud — including weapons, trucks, helicopters and substantial amounts of money to bribe commanders and to compete with the Taliban's Arab-funded treasury — but President Clinton refused, and President Bush only approved the plan a week before 9/11, at which point the Taliban controlled 90 percent of the country and even Massoud was feeling the pressure. 7 Five days later — and just two days before 9/11 — Massoud was assassinated by two Tunisians, working on behalf of al-Qaeda and posing as journalists, in a mission that was clearly intended to destabilize the Northern Alliance in preparation for a final push on the remaining 10 percent of the country that was under their control. 8 While his death was a significant loss to the anti-Taliban Alliance, however, his legacy was secure. Through his meetings with the CIA over the previous five years, he had essentially set the conditions for \"Operation Enduring Freedom,\" and although the Americans were unfamiliar with his successor, General Mohammed Fahim, their relationship with Massoud provided an invaluable base on which to build a new relationship. Even more importantly, in the months before his death Massoud had strengthened the Alliance considerably, cementing relationships that would become crucial to the Americans: with General Rashid Dostum, the Uzbek warlord and former ruler of the strategically important northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, who had been encouraged by Massoud to return from self-imposed exile in Turkey in April 2001; with the Tajik Ismael Khan, the former governor of Herat, the relatively wealthy western province which straddled important trade routes to Iran and Turkmenistan; and with Hamid Karzai, a Pashtun from the prominent Popolzai tribe, which had 500,000 clan members in Uruzgan and Kandahar provinces, who had served as deputy foreign minister in the post-Soviet government, but had been forced into exile in Pakistan by the Taliban. 9 Where the amnesia kicked in for the Americans was in overlooking the Alliance's history over the previous nine years. When the Soviet- backed regime collapsed in 1992, three years after the Soviet withdrawal, General Dostum, who had been fighting with the Russians \"OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM\" 5 throughout the occupation, surrendered to Massoud's forces, allowing the Tajiks to take the capital. Although Massoud's ally Burhanuddin Rabbani subsequently became President, it was a fragile peace, and the country soon descended into civil war as Gulbuddm Hekmatyar, allied with the Hazaras, attempted to wrest power from Rabbani and Massoud. When Dostum changed sides again in 1994, allying himself with Hekmatyar, Kabul was all but destroyed as the various sides attempted to annihilate each other. Between 1992 and 1994, over 50,000 people lost their lives in the capital alone, and throughout the country human rights abuses were so widespread that in November 1994, when Kandahar was taken by a small group of Pashtun fighters — the Taliban, strict Islamists influenced by Saudi Arabia's ultra-orthodox Wahhabi doctrine — they were initially regarded as saviors. Over time, however, as they were infiltrated by the ISI and their facade of purity slipped to reveal a harrowing brutality, they became at least as reviled as their predecessors, but as they steadily took over the country in the years that followed , it was their world — a terrifying simulacrum of a medieval Islamic state, with added Kalashnikovs — that confronted the Americans as they prepared to embark on \"Operation Enduring Freedom.\" It was perhaps too easy to forget the carnage that had come before and the part that some of their new allies had played in it. 1[l \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" On the night of October 7, 2001, the American mission to \"destroy\" al-Qaeda and the Taliban commenced in a rain of bombs — on Taliban military facilities, and on 23 military training camps in the south and east of the country, which, in a sign of the hyperbole to come, were all alleged to belong to al-Qaeda. 11 The bombers then targeted locations frequented by bin Laden and Mullah Omar, although Omar himself had already been allowed to escape. On the first night of hostilities, he was identified, fleeing Kabul in a convoy of Taliban vehicles, by a remote-controlled Predator surveillance plane, but by the time the CIA went through the process of requesting permission to fire the Predator's Hellfire missiles — a request which had to be made through Central Command's headquarters in Florida — he had slipped away, never to be seen again. 12 € THE GUANTANAMO FILES For the next month, as US Special Forces hooked up with the commanders of their proxy army, the Taliban refused to buckle, and reports of widespread civilian casualties — some that were manufactured by the Taliban for propaganda purposes, but others that were all too real — threatened to derail the war. As the US began, for the first time, to drop cluster bombs on any convenient gathering of Taliban soldiers, the UN's Human Rights Commissioner, Mary Robinson, called for a pause in the bombing to allow aid agencies access to the millions of Afghans who were threatened with starvation, and who had not managed to take advantage of the millions of dollars' worth of MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) that the Americans had also dropped on the hapless population. As the progress of the war swayed in the balance, Musharraf weighed in, insisting that the US held back from the total destruction of the Taliban front lines. \"If a power vacuum was filled by the Northern Alliance,\" he declared, \"we would be thrust back to the anarchy and atrocities we saw in the past.\" Overlooking the Taliban's atrocities of the previous seven years, he neglected to mention how many Pakistani officers were advising the Taliban, how many Pakistani foot soldiers were already serving alongside the Taliban, and how many others were streaming over the border to join the fight. 13 It was not until a month into the war, when Musharraf's delaying tactics were overruled and US forces began dropping 15,000 pound \"daisy-cutter\" bombs on the Taliban lines, that the way was paved for what would be the war's pivotal moment, the capture of Mazar- e-Sharif on November 9. The size of a car, \"daisy-cutters\" incinerate everything within a radius of about .900 meters, and their effect on the Taliban was devastating, incinerating hundreds of soldiers and traumatizing the survivors. In a three-pronged attack, with Special Forces riding in with Dostum's men on horseback from the south and the Tajiks and Hazaras advancing separately from the west, Mazar fell rapidly. Although thousands of Taliban soldiers fled — mainly to the city of Kunduz, 150 km to the east — many more were massacred, and when a thousand stragglers were found in a madrassa, Special Forces called in bombers who scored four direct hits on the building, and Dostum's soldiers stormed the ruins to finish off the survivors. \"When the smoke cleared,\" Gary Berntsen wrote in his account of the war, \"Dostum's men counted 450 dead.\" \"OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM' 7 7 After the fall of Mazar, which allowed the Americans to reopen the \"Friendship Bridge\" to Uzbekistan and bring supplies in by road, the Taliban's collapse throughout northern Afghanistan was spectacular. Over the next few days, Ismael Khan recaptured Herat, and the Hazara recaptured Bamiyan in their central heartlands. Repeatedly hit by air strikes, the Taliban in the north-eastern city of Taloqan, which had been the Northern Alliance base until they captured it 14 months earlier, followed a long-standing Afghan tradition and changed sides, and dozens of other towns also capitulated or were captured. So swift was the fall of the Taliban that on November 13, after a number of significant defections and another will-sapping bombing campaign, in which, according to Berntsen, 2,000 soldiers were killed in 25 air strikes, the Taliban lines broke on the Shomali Plains, north of Kabul. Despite the Americans' insistence that the Alliance should hold back five miles from the capital until an anti-Taliban Pashtun leader was confirmed, to establish some kind of power balance, the Alliance commander, Bismullah Khan, was unwilling or unable to hold back his men, and they entered Kabul in triumph. Although there were a number of summary executions, there was no Mazar- style slaughter, probably because the Taliban, for the most part, had already left, after looting everything in sight, including $6 million from the national bank. 14 The last city to fall in the north — and the first where prisoners, in large numbers, would have to be dealt with — was Kunduz, where those who had fled the fall of the other cities joined an existing army of Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers. The exact numbers were unclear, although the Northern Alliance estimated that there were as many as 20,000 men holed up in the city, including 10,000 recent arrivals from Pakistan, and 2,000 foreign al-Qaeda fighters. \"Whether or not this was a reasonable estimate, the numbers were significantly reduced when, with the approval of the US administration, Musharraf was allowed to avoid political embarrassment by arranging for several planes to airlift Pakistani soldiers and intelligence operatives out of the city. According to a senior intelligence official, the operation \"slipped out of control\" and an unknown number of Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters also joined the exodus, which probably numbered several thousand people. 15 8 THE GUANTANAMO FILES Encircled by the Northern Alliance and relentlessly bombed by the Americans, three of the Taliban leaders — deputy defense minister Mullah Mohammed Fazil, his deputy Mullah Dadaullah and Mullah Noorullah Noon, the military commander in northern Afghanistan — arranged to negotiate a surrender with General Dostum in Qala-i- Janghi, a nineteenth-century fortress in Mazar-e-Sharif. In exchange for safe passage for his fighters, Fazil was prepared to surrender the city and all his heavy weapons, but left the fate of the foreign fighters for Dostum to decide. No one wanted to deal with al-Qaeda; neither the Northern Alliance, who were unwilling to face such a fanatical enemy — \"They don't care about life, only death,\" one Alliance soldier noted, incredulously — nor, it seemed, the Taliban. Civilians who escaped the city said that, after a thousand Taliban soldiers defected, an Arab al-Qaeda commander ordered the execution of 150 others who were trying to leave. 1 6 Remarkably, Mullah Fazil managed to persuade the foreign fighters to accept the terms of surrender, and on the night of Friday, November 24, a group of 450 foreign fighters set off to surrender to General Dostum in Mazar-e-Sharif. Like the many thousands of mainly Afghan and Pakistani Taliban fighters who surrendered near Kunduz over the next few days, they were to find that the terms of surrender were not as straightforward as they appeared. The first Guantanamo prisoners were drawn from these men, but, although Mullah Fazil had avoided a bloodbath in Kunduz } much more blood would be spilled before they arrived in Cuba. 2 The Qala-i-Janghi Massacre Trie \"Uprising\" On the morning of Saturday, November 24, in the desert near Mazar- e-Sharif, the 450 foreign fighters who had left Kunduz to surrender to General Dostum realized too late that they had been betrayed by Mullah Fazil, and that they were to be imprisoned rather than being allowed to return home. Disarmed after a tense stand-off, they were loaded onto trucks and taken to Mazar-e-Sharif, but Said Kamel, Dostum's security chief, neglected to search them all before they set off, and, after arriving at the fort, one of them detonated a hidden grenade, killing himself, Dostum's police chief Nader Ali, and a number of his fellow prisoners. Shocked by the attack, Amir Jan Naseri, an Alliance commander, ordered his men to tie up the prisoners' hands and put them in the basement, but it was clear that they had not all been disarmed. That night, fearing they were about to be murdered, eight more prisoners killed themselves with hidden grenades. 1 The following morning, two CIA agents — Johnny \"Mike\" Spann and an Uzbek speaker called Dave — turned up to interrogate the prisoners. Spann was filmed quizzing a truculent prisoner, dressed in a filthy black tunic and with long unkempt hair, whose case was to overshadow almost all other media reports about Qala-i-Janghi, when it was revealed that he was a 20-year-old American called John \"walker Lindh. \"He won't talk to me,\" Spann complained to Dave. \"I was explaining to the guy we just want to talk to him, find out what his story is.\" \"The problem is,\" Dave replied, \"he's got to decide if he wants to live or die and die here. We're just going to leave him, and he's going to fucking sit in prison the rest of his fucking short life. It's 10 THE GUANTANAMO FILES his decision, man. We can only help the guys who want to talk to us. We can only get. the Red Cross to help so many guys.\" 2 Soon after, while Spann was interrogating another prisoner, asking him, \"Why are you here?\" the man said, \"To kill you,\" and lunged at him. Spann shot the man but was immediately set upon by numerous other prisoners, who beat him to death. As Dave escaped to the parapet, where he called in air strikes, other prisoners overpowered their guards, seizing their weapons, breaking into Dostum's armory, and freeing the rest of their companions from their overnight prison. At least half the prisoners were killed by air strikes that afternoon, but a group of 50 fighters, holed up in the basement, held out for another day. Twenty-four hours later, when Special Forces operatives estimated that only three men were still alive, oil was poured into the house in which they had taken shelter, which was then ignited. As silence descended for the first time in three days, an Alliance commander encouraged his men to descend from the ramparts. Journalist Alex Perry noted that they were \"plainly spooked by the suicidal bravery of the Taliban, and had to be forced to break cover,\" but they soon overcame their fear and began looting the corpses, taking money, pens, cigarettes, copies of the Koran, and, in particular, the dead men's trainers. Two wounded prisoners were executed on the spot. One was \"shot to pieces,\" and another had a rock dropped on his head. 3 The day after, with the all-clear sounded, journalists poured into the fort, filing reports from the corpse-strewn compound and witnessing further looting, including one Alliance soldier prying gold fillings out of a dead prisoner's mouth. General Dostum also showed up, and brought Mullah Fazil and Mullah Noon with him. The Mullahs were silent, but Dostum was happy to talk. \"We tried to treat the Taliban humanely,\" he said. \"We could have tied their hands and their legs but we didn't.\" As he spoke, one of his soldiers kicked the body of a man to make sure that he was dead, and Justin Huggler noted, \"The body rolled over to reveal that the man's arms had been tied together behind his back.\" 4 The clean-up continued the following day, when it was announced that 175 corpses had been recovered. No one knew how many more were underground. After four shots rang out from the basement, and two rescue workers stumbled out, wounded, the Alliance and their THE QALA-J-JANGH1 MA5SACRE 11 American advisors came up with a plan to finish off the survivors: a water supply was diverted, and the whole of the basement was flooded. Astonishingly, despite being bombed, burned and flooded, not every Taliban prisoner had been killed. Thirteen survivors emerged from the basement on the evening of Saturday, December 1, and were detained overnight in a container. Luke Harding reported that there were twelve Pakistanis and one Afghan, and that one of the Pakistanis asked him, in perfect English, \"Could you ask them to bring us some tea? We are very hungry. We have had nothing to eat.\" As he peered into the container, glimpsing a man in the shadows \"with no face, whose nose and mouth had been blown away,\" the English-speaking prisoner told him, \"We wanted to surrender on Thursday. But there was a group of seven Arabs who wouldn't let us.\" 5 At 10 am, another group of 73 survivors emerged. As they limped forward, one by one, to be searched beneath a ruined avenue of pine trees, a guard called out their nationalities: \"Uzbekistan! Arab! Pakistan! Yemen! Chechnya!\" \"Where are you from?\" Matthew Campbell asked a man who stopped in front of him. \"I was born in America ,,, Baton Rouge, Louisiana — you know it, yeah?\" the man replied. Later revealed as 21 -year-old Yaser Hamdi, who retained his US citizenship despite moving back to Saudi Arabia with his family when he was a child, his case is discussed in Chapter 18. Luke Harding, meanwhile, spoke to Abdul Jabar, a Taliban volunteer from Uzbekistan, who explained, \"It was our commander who began the fighting.\" He was probably referring to Tahir Uldosh, the deputy leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), who was identified as one of the leaders of the uprising, and who presumably succeeded in his aim of choosing death over surrender. While Red Cross representatives handed out apples, bananas and pomegranates, feeding those who were too incapacitated to feed themselves, Harding spoke to another wounded survivor, a Pakistani teenager called Ijaz Latif, who told him, \"There were a lot of Pakistanis with me, but most of them are now dead. I didn't see who started the fighting. We just ran away and hid in the basement.\" 6 The Survivors' Stories Of the 86 survivors, at least 50 — including 21 Saudis, nine Yemenis > several prisoners from other Gulf countries and North Africa, 12 THE GUANTANAMO FILES and a dozen men from the countries bordering Afghanistan to the north — were subsequently transferred to Guantanamo, where their alleged participation in the \"uprising\" was used against them in their tribunals. It's far from clear, however, that the majority of them were anything more than Taliban foot soldiers, prepared to help the Taliban establish a \"pure Islamic state\" by fighting the Northern Alliance, but unprepared for 9/11, the US-led invasion, and a \"Global War on Terror\" in which they would come to be regarded as terrorists. The Saudis and Yemenis, for example, who were mostly aged between 16 and 25 at the time of their capture, were largely recruited through a fatwa issued by the octogenarian Saudi cleric Sheikh Hamoud al-Uqla, who was condemned by the US administration for condoning 9/11, encouraging jihad against Christians and Jews, and raising money for Osama bin Laden. In the fatwa that was responsible for sending large numbers of young men to Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban, al-Uqla praised the Taliban for creating \"the only country in the world in which there are no man-made laws and legislations,\" and explained that the jihad was \"ordained by the Sharia\" because it was \"against the Northern Alliance which is being funded by the forces of Disbelief like America, Britain, Russia and others who are calling for a broad-based government in Afghanistan established upon a western legislative system.\" On the ground in Afghanistan, what this actually meant — given Dostum's history in particular — was the Russians, and it was no surprise that many of those who made their way to Afghanistan thought that they were fighting the Russians. Mesh Arsad al-Rashid, a 21-year-old Saudi, said that he went to help Muslims fight Dostum and Massoud over a year \"before any problem happened in America,\" and pointed out that he \"didn't know of any alliance between America and Massoud\" and that \"all that was known in the world was that Massoud and Dostum were helping the Soviet Union.\" 7 With a few exceptions, the \"evidence\" against the Saudis and Yemenis consisted primarily of allegations that they were recruited in the Gulf, and that they trained and served with the Taliban. Very few of them, for example, were accused of training at al-Farouq, the camp established by the influential Afghan warlord and Islamic scholar Abdul Rasul Sayyaf in the early 1990s, which became closely linked to Osama bin Laden in the years before 9/11, and there were none of THE QALA-1-JANGH1 MA 5 SAC RE 13 the exotic allegations about purported connections to al-Qaeda and bin Laden himself that were to plague many of the other Guantanamo prisoners. This is not to say that there were no \"hard-core\" fighters amongst the survivors , but the tribunal transcripts contain few clues to their identities. The only remotely serious allegations were leveled against four of the Saudis: 30-year-old Bijad al-Atabi was accused of being an assistant commander in al-Qaeda's Arab Brigade, 23-year- old Fahed al-Harazi was accused of traveling to Afghanistan in March 2001 and — with remarkable speed — becoming a trainer in al-Farouq, and 34-year-old Abdullah ai-Yamani was accused of knowing both Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (the leader of \"al-Qaeda in Iraq,\" killed in 2006) and Abu Zubaydah (a senior al-Qaeda operative discussed in Chapter 13). Most astonishingly of all, 17-year-old Yasser al-Zahram (whose death in Guantanamo is discussed in Chapter 19) was accused of being \"a front line fighter for the Taliban who facilitated weapons purchases for offensives against US and coalition forces.\" While a few of these allegations seem to be self-evidently absurd (al-Yamani, for example, was released in 2006), it's worth noting that none of them are necessarily credible, as they were obtained through a long process of dubious interrogations and hearsay \"evidence\" that will be looked at in more detail in later chapters. 8 Although only a handful of the Saudi and Yemeni detainees spoke about their experiences, their recollections echoed those of Ijaz Latif. Most, were wounded — either by being shot or through shrapnel wounds — and several said that they were tied up before the shooting began. Abdul Aziz al-Oshan, a 22-year-old Saudi student who went to Afghanistan to rescue his brother, told his tribunal, \"You are talking about the uprising. They called it an uprising and it's not; it's some kind of massacre. I was even wounded while I was there.\" Ibrahim ai-Sehh, a 36-year-old Saudi, who worked as a guard for the Taliban (and was later diagnosed with dementia and released in 2006), said, \"They handcuffed us and put us in a court, a big open space, and there were explosions behind us. Shrapnel from that explosion hit me.\" Mesh Arsad al-Rashid, who was injured in his thigh and shoulder, asked, \"What uprising? We didn't do any uprising. We had given up our weapons, so how could we be part of an uprising? They [Dostum's troops] were the ones that had the weapons. We tried to defend ourselves but we couldn't, because they had all the weapons.\" 14 THE GUANTANAMO FILES He added that, accusing men who were tied up of using weapons was a sure sign of the \"betrayal\" that had taken place in the fort. Yusef al- Rabiesh, a 20-year-old Saudi, who also went to Afghanistan to rescue his brother (and was also released in 2006), said, \"we were taken out two by two. We were handcuffed and seated in a big field ... We sat there for about two to three hours. There was a demonstration and then the Northern Alliance started shooting at us .., We were handcuffed when the shooting started. The only people who had weapons were the Northern Alliance, and they were shooting at the detainees.\" He added, \"I got shot and lost consciousness and my brother was killed. He was handcuffed when he was killed.\" 9 The other prisoners from the Gulf and North Africa — Nasser al- Mutairi, a 24-year-old Kuwaiti (released in January 2005), Walid Ali, a 27-year-old from the Sudan, and Ali al-Tayeea, a 28-year-old Iraqi (cleared for release in 2007) — told similar stories. Al-Mutain, who admitted fighting with the Taliban, but insisted that he went to Afghanistan for rabat (preparation) rather than jihad, said that he and other prisoners were \"outside in the courtyard with our hands bound\" when the shooting started, and that he was shot as he tried to make his way back to the basement. Walid Ali and Ali al-Tayeea told the most complete stories of being caught in the crossfire and suffering in the basement. Like the Saudi quoted earlier, Walid All, who worked as a Taliban guard for a month, stated that he went to Afghanistan to fight the Russians, and was unable to understand how Dostum had become an ally of the United States. Describing what happened in the fort, he said: They handcuffed us so tightly that the circulation was cut off, and I became unconscious. [Then] they were firing bullets at us while we were handcuffed and American airplanes came and started firing at us and killed a lot of us. I was handcuffed and wounded in my back with a bullet and it went to my belly where it is now. And I feel the pain of it ... While I was on the ground an American airplane fired a bomb and shrapnel hit my head and it is still there in my head. And then I went unconscious and I did not feel anything until I woke up in a room underground ... Of course, they used all [kinds of] different weapons in order to kill us. They even used water and electricity. And they threw a bomb on us. And a lot of times they opened water on us to the point [that] we had water up to our necks. Of course, the wounded ones couldn J t stand up and they were killed in the water. 10 THE QALA-1-JANGH1 MA 5 SAC RE 15 Ali al-Tayeea explained what happened after he came out. of the basement on the day that the uprising began: Now, all the people were outside and we hear the bomb and someone from Dostum's army had a machine gun on his shoulder. He opened fire on people. People were yelling, \"please don't shoot\" and he opened fire ... There was nothing we could do. We were in the centre and fire came from everywhere. A lot of people died. I laid down because my hands were tied. I begged for someone to just open my hands because they had been tied for along time with wire and they were blue and cold. They opened my hands and I went inside the shelter. There was bombing and fire for the first three days. It was dark and you couldn't see who your neighbour was. Like, 70 people had died and it smelled bad. After explaining that some of those in the basement were still armed, he continued: I didn't fire because I'm not a jackass. I stayed inside. After three days, they opened the window and put fire inside the shelter and there was nothing we could do about it. Many people died in the fire and it smelled like steak. I looked and I was beside John Walker. After this they put water in through the window. John Walker was tall and he's beside my shoulder. Some of the detainees that were short were under water. 11 In addition to the Arabs, the survivors from Afghanistan's neighbors to the north also had stories to tell, although Abdul Jabar was not among them. Like numerous Pakistanis (some of whom were probably transferred to Guantanamo but then released in 2003 or 2004 without their stories being recorded), the fate of the eleven Uzbeks who survived the Qala-i-Janghi massacre is unknown, although the most alarming possibility is that they were among the dozens of Uzbeks who were transferred to the custody of President Karimov in exchange for services rendered. 12 Instead, there were a few Tajiks, a Kazakh, four \"Russian\" Muslims (two Balkars from Kabardino-Balkaria, north of Georgia, and two Tatars from Bashkortostan, north of Kazakhstan), and a handful of Uyghurs who had fled from poverty and oppression in East Turkistan, a largely Muslim country bordering Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, which was subjugated by the People's Republic of China and is now known as Xinjiang province. What's noticeable about these prisoners is that several were serving with far less enthusiasm than either Abdul Jabar or the majority of the Arabs, and others were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. 16 THE GUANTANAMO FILES One of the Uyghurs, 30-year-old Ahmad Tourson, who had been living in Kabul since arriving in Afghanistan with his family in 2000 , was accused of traveling from Kunduz to Mazar-e-Sharif to fight the Northern Alliance. In response, he said that he was arrested for no reason, after visiting Kunduz to find out if it was easier for Uyghurs to live with Uzbeks in the north of Afghanistan than it was in Kabul: \"Foreigners, bad people, good people, soldiers, fighters. Everybody walks through the street and I am passing through the road, then I am captured by General Dostum's troops. It does not explain that ail these people are al-Qaeda. It is kind of funny looking. Everybody walks in the street, everybody walks.\" Speaking of his time in Qala- i-Janghi, he said that a Uyghur friend of his was killed in the fortress, and added, \"I did not participate in the riot. They dropped bombs and I was injured. I was not a soldier. I have nothing against the Americans. Why would I participate in the riot? All Uyghurs have one enemy, the Chinese. We have no other enemies.\" 13 The rest of the prisoners were scarcely more fortunate, as they were mostly coerced into service by pro-Taliban forces in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Although the 28-year-old Balkar Ruslan Ogidov left home partly because he had been tortured by the Russian intelligence services in 1999, and his compatriot Rasul Kudayev, a 17-year-old former wrestling champion, left home to avoid military service, the Tatars Shamil Khazhiyev, a 30-year-old police lieutenant, and Ravil Gumarov, a 39-year-old businessman, fitted the profile of religious refugees who were coerced into military activity. Gumarov's father said that his son's desire to live under Islamic law grew so strong that, in 2000, he abandoned his wife, four children and elderly parents to travel to Afghanistan. \"W T hen I asked him what he would do abroad,\" his father said, \"Ravil said he was ready to tend sheep if he could live under the rule of Islam.\" Leonid Syukiainen, a Russian academic, drew parallels between the Russian prisoners and the idealistic Westerners who moved to the Soviet Union after the 1.917 Revolution to help build a socialist society. \"Of course, there had to be a combination of reasons for these people to flee to Afghanistan,\" he said, \"but I believe that their strongest motive was that they sincerely sought a fair Islamic society there.\" Igor Tkachyov, the head of a team of Russians who visited the prisoners at Guantanamo, made even more specific comments about what happened to the men. He said that they THE QALA-J-JANGH1 MA5SACRE 17 traveled via Tajikistan, where members of the Islamic opposition to President Rahmonov helped them get to Afghanistan, and added that once they were there they \"found themselves in a kind of totalitarian sect commanded by the Taliban ,,. They were not allowed to be alone and had to do everything together, obeying strict regulations that left no time for anything but prayers.\" 14 Ilkham Batayev, a 28-year-old from Kazakhstan (released in December 2006) told a similar story. After traveling to Tajikistan to sell apples, he was kidnapped by thugs working for the IMU, and transported to Kunduz, where he was forced to work as an assistant to a Taliban cook. In the chaos surrounding the fall of Kunduz, he saw his chance to escape, and hopped in a car with some other men who were hoping to escape to Iran, but was captured by Northern Alliance soldiers and taken to Qala-i-Janghi. Sick with malaria, and in pain from a recent operation to remove his wisdom teeth, he decided to leave the basement behind everybody else on the Sunday morning, but was injured by a grenade as soon as he emerged, and then crawled back underground, where he spent the next six days hallucinating because he had lost a large amount of blood. 15 On December 1, as a container truck arrived to take the survivors to General Dostum's prison at Sheberghan, human rights groups began calling for an investigation, suggesting that the Geneva Conventions could have been breached on two specific counts: the requirements that \"prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated,\" and that, if force were to be used against them, it had to be \"proportionate.\" With hindsight, and the knowledge that the US administration was preparing to discard the Geneva Conventions altogether, it's clear that no investigation was ever likely to take place, but it also remains apparent that there was some justification for the US administration's claim that \"they only bombed Qaia- i-Janghi because their own personnel were under threat.\" Having rioted this, however, \"proportionate\" is the last word that comes to mind to describe the colossal number of bombs that were dropped on the fort, and when it comes to other aspects of the operation the evidence of both inhumane treatment and a brutality that is far from proportionate becomes even more compelling. The summary execution of two wounded prisoners has already been mentioned above, but its callousness should not be overlooked or forgotten. 18 THE GUANTANAMO FILES Nor, too j should the attempts by both Dostum and the Americans to suggest that few of those who were killed were tied up at the time they were shot. Although various reporters were briefed that \"only\" eight prisoners had been bound before being shot after the uprising started, the estimate of 250, which was proposed by Luke Harding, is more credible for three reasons: first, because a photographer \"saw the bodies of up to SO Taliban fighters whose hands had been bound by scarves, laid out in a field in the southern part of the fort,\" and that he \"watched as Alliance fighters cut the scarves from the hands of the corpses\"; secondly, because Alex Perry noted, \"some of the dead had their hands bound, and Alliance soldiers used scissors to snip off the strings\"; and third, and no less significantly, because so many of the survivors — whose testimony was suppressed until the Pentagon released their tribunal transcripts in 2006 — also talked about being bound when the shooting started. 1 s 3 The Convoy of Death Yerghanek and Qala Zeini On Sunday, November 25 t 2001, as the uprising began in Qala-i-Janghi, a far larger group of Taliban soldiers — at least 4,500, but possibly as many as 7,000 — made their way from Kunduz to Yerghanek, five miles west of the city, where they surrendered to General Dostum. What no one either knew or cared about, however, was that among the surrendering soldiers were hundreds of civilians who had been caught, up in the chaos or who were fleeing the hard-core al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters making a last stand in Kunduz itself. One of the most vivid accounts of the surrender was provided by three young Britons who fell into this latter category. Twenty-four- year-old Shafiq Rasul, 20-year-old Asif Iqbal and 20-year-old Rhuhel Ahmed — childhood friends from Tipton in the West Midlands — had traveled to Pakistan in September 2001. Iqbal was making arrangements for his forthcoming marriage to a young woman in Pakistan, Ahmed was his best man, and Rasul was planning to do a computer course once the wedding was over, but soon after their arrival, when the invasion of Afghanistan began, they made the fateful decision that an exciting adventure awaited them over the border, just a short bus-ride away. Using the money they had brought with them, they planned to provide humanitarian aid to Afghan villagers, a mission that also involved the adrenaline rush of being in a war zone, and, they hoped, the opportunity to sample the Afghans' enormous naan breads. Up close, however, the war zone was more frightening than they had anticipated. At risk from both US bombing raids and the Taliban, who were deeply suspicious of young men wandering 19 20 THE CUANTANAMO FILES around without beards, they tried to return to Pakistan in a taxi, but were instead taken to Kunduz. As the first groups of Taliban soldiers began to surrender, they clambered onto a truck that was leaving the city, but the vehicle was immediately shelled, and almost everyone on board was killed. With nowhere else to turn, they surrendered to Alliance soldiers who took their money, their shoes and their warm clothes, and marched them to Yerghanek. 1 Very few of those who made their way to Yerghanek — 70 at most — were eventually transferred to Guantanamo. Of these, only a handful have spoken about their experiences, and none were in the first convoys that set off for Sheberghan on the Sunday. Overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people flooding out of the city, Dostum was obliged to keep thousands of them marooned in the desert while he arranged additional transportation over the next few days. As a result, neither the men from Tipton nor the others who ended up in Guantanamo — including Abdul Rahman, a 25-year-old shopkeeper from Kunduz, and Mohammed Saghir, a 49-year-old woodcutter from Pakistan's North West Frontier Province — had any inkling of the grisly fate that awaited them. While the vast crowds of fighters and civilians were disarmed, Dostum's men recruited drivers to go to Qala Zeini, an old fort on the road between Mazar-e-Sharif and Sheberghan, where those transported from Yerghanek were transferred into containers for the last stage of the journey to Sheberghan. One of the drivers, who was in the fort when a convoy of prisoners arrived that evening, said that, as soon as the Northern Alliance soldiers began stripping them of their turbans and vests, tying their hands behind their backs and transferring them to the containers, some of the prisoners — those who were familiar with recent Afghan history — realized that Dostum was planning to kill them. Since 1997, when a brutal Uzbek general had first seen the viability of containers as cheap and convenient killing machines, murdering 1,250 Taliban soldiers by leaving them in containers in the summer sun, they had become a familiar weapon of Afghan warfare. When the Taliban took Mazar-e-Sharif in 1998, they disposed of their conquered enemies in the same fashion. According to one of the drivers, a few hours after the convoy had set off from Qala Zeini, the prisoners started pounding on the sides of the containers, shouting, \"We're dying. Give us water! We are human, THE CONVOY OF DEATH 21 not animals.\" He said that he and other drivers punctured holes in the walls and passed through bottles of water, but added that those who were caught doing this were punished. Even these gestures, however, were not enough to prevent large numbers of the prisoners from suffocating as the convoy crawled towards Sheberghan. When the first trucks pulled up at the prison and the doors of the containers were opened, most were disturbingly silent. One of the drivers recalled, \"They opened the doors and the dead bodies spilled out like fish.\" 2 Back at Yerghanek, other prisoners had worries of their own. Abdul Rahman's life had been unsettled for some time. Originally from Zabul province, east of Kandahar, he moved to Kunduz, where he established a small general store, after rival tribesmen seized his family's land. When the US bombing campaign began, he was reassured that \"they were also dropping leaflets and telling on the radio they were coming, saying their fight was not with the public; it was only against the Taliban and al-Qaeda\"; but as he set off for home on the day of the Taliban surrender he found that Tajik soldiers of the Northern Alliance had blocked the roads, and were \"pinpointing Pas h tuns and taking them out of cars, taking their money and beating them up.\" W T hen some locals said that he and other merchants should seek US and Red Cross assistance at Yerghanek, they started making their way there, but were stopped by Dostum's men. \"They told us when we see you Pashtun people, we will tie you up and beat you up,\" he said. \"They did as promised, and a lot of Pashtun people in Afghanistan got beaten up.\" Abducted and taken to Yerghanek, Abdul Rahman watched in shock as several Taliban members bribed their captors to set them free, while he and the other captured shopkeepers were tied up for the night. He became even more fearful when he heard screams during the night. \"I think they buried about 50 people alive in the ground,\" he said. \"They kept on shouting and screaming, and they kept putting dirt on them.\" The following day, his nightmare began in earnest. He and his companions were taken to Qala Zeini, where container trucks were waiting to take them to Sheberghan. \"About 200-300 people were thrown in these trucks, and they closed the doors,\" he said. \"W T e did not see any light, and there was no air in it. Due to lack of air, a lot of people died there; I fainted somehow.\" When they finally arrived at Sheberghan, \"We were in bad shape, and they left the dead 22 THE CUANTANAMO FILES behind.\" Three years later, having been transported from Sheberghan to Kandahar and then to Guantanamo, Abdul Rahman's nightmare had still not come to an end. In his tribunal, repeating his story as he had so many times before, he was obliged to refute allegations that he had bought a car for the Taliban while wearing a Taliban-style turban, accompanied by his personal security force of four Taliban soldiers, explaining that this was a story that had been conjured up by the men who falsely imprisoned him in the first place. Finally, someone believed his story, and, after 40 months in detention, he was released in April 2005. 3 Mohammed Saghir faced a similar ordeal. The woodcutter was also a missionary with Jamaat-al-Tabhghi, a vast worldwide proselytizing organization whose annual gatherings in Pakistan and Bangladesh attract millions of followers. Over the years he had been involved in numerous preaching missions to Afghanistan, but on this occasion he and nine other missionaries were seized by Northern Alliance troops. Saghir was also held for a night at Yerghanek, where he \"witnessed wounded and injured men buried alive with the dead,\" and was then taken to Qala Zeim and herded into a container. \"The journey took five hours,\" he said. \"It was dark, hot and suffocating as there was not enough air in the container. Fifty out of the 250 prisoners died on [the] way.\" Unlike Abdul Rahman, however, it took Saghir less than a year to convince the Americans of his innocence. He was one of the first three prisoners to be freed, in November 2002, and was the first ex-Guantanamo prisoner to speak in detail not only about the horrors of detention in Afghanistan and Cuba, but also about the death convoys. 4 The three men from Tipton waited for another day until their transportation was arranged, and in their case the container lorries came at night, and the whole sordid spectacle was illuminated by spotlights operated by US Special Forces soldiers. Once the doors were shut, their ordeal followed a now familiar pattern. \"They'd herded maybe 300 of us into each container .., packed in so tightly our knees were against our chests,\" Asif Iqbal said, \"and almost immediately we started to suffocate.\" As with some of the previous journeys, ventilation was provided by Northern Alliance soldiers, who made sure that their humanitarian gesture was accompanied by more killing. \"We lived because someone made holes with a machine THE CONVOY OF DEATH 23 gun,\" Iqbal said, \"though they were shooting low and still more died from the bullets. The last thing I remember is that it got really hot, and everyone started screaming and banging. It was like someone had lit a fire beneath the containers. You could feel the moisture running off your body, and people were ripping off their clothes.\" When he finally awoke, he realized that he had not drunk anything for more than two days, and was seriously dehydrated. Using a cloth, he wiped the moisture off the wall and began sucking on it, until he realized he was drinking the blood of those who had died. \"We were like zombies,\" he said. \"We stank; we were covered in blood and the smell of death.\" 5 Sheberghan As the survivors spilled out of the container trucks at Sheberghan, they discovered that, although the mass executions were over, the conditions at Dostum's prison were almost unspeakably grim. Thirty- five hundred prisoners were crammed into a space that could only reasonably hold five hundred, and in order to sleep they took turns on the floor, squeezed together in four-hour shifts. Food was also a problem. Shafiq Rasul recalled that each prisoner received a quarter of a naan every day, and a small cup of water, and that sometimes prisoners fought over the food. Twenty-four-year-old Sulaiman Shah, an Afghan used car dealer, was another of the many innocents swept up by the Northern Alliance. On his release in March 2003, he mentioned his time at Sheberghan, where, he said, \"life was inhuman, all the prisoners had diarrhea, some had tuberculosis, there was no food for days at a time and we were subjected to beatings and torture.\" 6 Despite Shah's appraisal of the ill-health of the prisoners, medical attention was non-existent. Rasul recalled, \"There were people with horrific injuries — limbs that had been shot off and nothing was done. I'll never forget one Arab who was missing half his jaw. For ten days until his death he was screaming and crying continuously, begging to be killed.\" To make matters worse, reporters were swarming around Sheberghan, but for the most part they were blind to the suffering of the prisoners. \"All they seemed to be interested in,\" Rasul said, \"was if any of us knew the American Taliban John Walker Lindh.\" No one realized that Lindh was not even in Sheberghan. Instead, he 24 THE CUANTANAMO FILES and the other Qala-i-Janghi survivors were taken to a hospital in Mazar-e-Sharif, where they were discovered by Robert Young Pelton, an American writer who was staying with General Dostum. \"They were the most pathetic looking humans I had ever seen,\" he said, \"they were all freezing, hypothermic because they were wet and it was very cold that night.\" Pelton talked to Lindh as he was being treated, and noted that he was \"a very gentle, thoughtful, intellectual person,\" adding, \"If you've been around fighters and soldiers a lot, that's just the wrong kind of guy you put on the front lines.\" When Lindh recovered, Pelton arranged to take him back to Dostum's house, and, after cleaning him up, feeding him and giving him a chance to sleep, \"the next day he was blindfolded and taken to the Turkish schoolhouse where the Americans had a base.\" Ironically, while the Qala-i-Janghi survivors received medical treatment, the prisoners in Sheberghan continued to be deprived of even the most basic comforts. After ten days, Red Cross representatives were finally allowed to visit, but although they brought food supplies and water, several prisoners complained that it was confiscated by the guards. \"The Red Cross people asked Dostum's people to feed us,\" Abdul Rahman said, \"but they wouldn't. Those were dark nights for us.\" 7 Several weeks passed before the first of the prisoners in Sheberghan were transferred to US custody, but in the meantime, as news of the massacre began to seep out, human rights organizations again called for an investigation, focusing not only on the convoys, but also on claims that the dead and wounded had been buried in mass graves at Dasht-i-Leili, an expanse of wasteland on the outskirts of Sheberghan. The graves were subjected to intense scrutiny over the next few months, as representatives of Physicians for Human Rights, and Bill Hegland, a pioneer in the field of \"human rights archaeology,\" investigated them. Both confirmed that a massacre had taken place, but, as with Qala-i-Janghi, no official inquiry took place. Newsweek reported that the UN confirmed that the findings were \"sufficient to justify a fully- fledged criminal investigation,\" but also noted that advisors warned against proceeding with the case, citing its \"political sensitivity.\" 8 It was left, to film-maker Jamie Doran, in his documentary Afghan- Massacre: The Convoy of Death, to present a series of explosive claims, which remain unanswered. Doran, who concluded that up to three thousand men were killed in the convoys, sought out THE CONVOY OF DEATH 25 eyewitnesses to explain what had happened. While no one claimed that the Americans had any prior knowledge of the massacre, an Afghan soldier said that, when confronted with the corpses of several hundred men, \"The Americans told the Sheberghan people to get them outside the city before they were filmed by satellite.\" He also visited Dasht-i-Leih with a driver who said that he was accompanied by thirty to forty American soldiers when he brought wounded men to the site, who were then shot and buried, and spoke to other witnesses who said that the Americans were responsible for murders and disappearances at the prison. An Alliance soldier told him that a US soldier murdered a Taliban prisoner in order to frighten the others into talking, and explained, \"The Americans did whatever they wanted; we had no power to stop them. Everything was under the control of the American commander,\" and an Alliance general said he saw US soldiers stabbing prisoners in the leg and cutting their tongues. \"Sometimes, it looked as if they were doing it for pleasure. They would take a prisoner outside, beat him up and return him to the jail,\" he said. \"But sometimes, they were never returned and they disappeared.\" 9 While these were grave allegations, the Americans' conduct over the months and years to come would do nothing to dispel fears that torture, murder and disappearances had become acceptable tools in the \"War on Terror.\" 4 Tor a Bora Tora Bora On Saturday, November 10, 2001, Osama bin Laden addressed a meeting of a thousand tribal leaders and their followers at the Islamic Studies Centre in Jalalabad, telling them, \"The Americans had a plan to invade, but if we are united and believe in Allah, we'll teach them a lesson, the same one we taught the Russians,\" and that evening, at a lavish banquet, envelopes were handed out to the tribal leaders containing between $300 and $10,000, depending on the size and influence of the various clans. Three days later, bin Laden's convoy, consisting of several hundred vehicles loaded up with men, women and children, set off for the caves of Tora Bora, south-east of the city. First fortified during the war against the Soviet Union, using funds from the Saudis and the expertise of the ISI, the caves had been converted by Engineer Mahmoud, a commander serving under Maulvi Younis Khahs, an alim (Islamic scholar) and prominent Islamic leader, and the whole area was one that bin Laden knew well. He had fought nearby in his mujahideen days, when he had established his reputation as a warrior, and, while his speech in Jalalabad had focused on the forthcoming showdown with the Americans, he had specifically couched it in the context of the resistance to the Russians, promising a reprise of the guerrilla warfare that had been so successful in the 1980s. Tora Bora had also figured prominently in bin Laden's more recent history. In 1.9.96, when he returned to Afghanistan from Sudan, it was Khalis in particular who welcomed him in Jalalabad, and later allowed him to further adapt the caves, and a compound in the nearby Milawa valley, for use as a family home and as \"a command centre and logistics hub.\" 1 26 TORA BORA 27 As the Americans prepared to take on bin Laden in Tora Bora, they followed the pattern established in northern Afghanistan and recruited a proxy army, instead of risking the lives of their own men. Astonishingly, they first tried to recruit Khalis, seemingly oblivious to the fact that he was a friend of bin Laden, and had issued a call for jihad against US forces at the start of the invasion. When Khalis told them he was retired, they recruited two of his former commanders, who had both fought the Russians in Tora Bora and Jalalabad: Hazrat Ali, a semi-literate bruiser, who had flirted briefly with the Taliban before allying himself with Ahmed Shah Massoud, and Haji Zaman Ghamsharik, a wealthy, sophisticated drug smuggler, who had been living in France during the Taliban years, until he was lured back by American money. 2 While these alliances did not augur well for the success of the Tora Bora mission, the most grievous failure on the part of the Americans concerned their unwillingness to put troops on the ground to block the exit routes leading to Pakistan. Seduced by their own hyped -up fantasies about the scale and intensity of al-Qaeda's fanatical hordes, they failed to realize that, far from being \"Al-Qaeda's Last Stand,\" Tora Bora was actually hemorrhaging jihadi refugees at an alarming rate. The Afghans were astonished at this oversight, but the most vociferous complaints came from other Americans. Gary Berntsen, who directed the Tora Bora operation on the ground, attempted to persuade the military high command to use a battalion of S00 Rangers — the army's most highly -trained paratroops — to seal the border. Turned down by the Rangers' commander, for fear of \"alienating our Afghan allies,\" Berntsen shouted, \"I don't give a damn about offending our allies! All I care about is eliminating al-Qaeda and delivering bin Lad en's head in a box!\" 3 Compounding these failures, the situation was no better on the Pakistani side of the border, where the crossings were also unguarded. The only time the Pakistani government had sent troops into the remote and effectively autonomous Pas hum tribal areas bordering Afghanistan was to put down a revolt in 1973, and it was followed by a hideously violent 18-month struggle that no one in the government wanted to repeat. As a result, it took President Musharraf several weeks to negotiate a troop deployment with the tribal leaders, and by the time two brigades arrived at the border — around December 10 — it 28 THE CUANTANAMO FILES was too late for all but the last-minute mopping-up operations that are discussed in the next three chapters. According to Newsweek, the Tor a Bora fighters had actually been in full-scale retreat from November 16. That evening, €00 armed men, who had been led by a local guide on a seven-hour trek from Tora Bora, passed through a village near the Pakistani border. While some of the men rested, the villagers recognized several senior Taliban figures in a group that pressed on without pausing for food, including Maulvi Abdul Qabir, Mullah Omar's deputy. One local was so impressed that he decided to investigate how they had managed to escape without encountering any American bombing. He discovered that, although there were two routes out of Tora Bora — one leading down to Khost, and the other, which the fighters had taken, across the White Mountains — the Americans were only bombing the route to Khost. Working as a guide over the next month> he made five trips across the White Mountains, escorting around twenty men at a time and traveling at night along old smuggling paths. He added that one of the men told him that bin Laden and his son Abdullah had left Tora Bora on December 1 \"for an unknown place,\" and this was confirmed by Abu Jaffar, a Saudi al-Qaeda financier, who told the Christian Science Monitor that he had left in early December and had sent his son Salah Uddin to take his place. 4 By the time the ground offensive began, on December 3, the Americans' allies had managed to assemble an army of 2,500 men, vastly outnumbering their now-depleted enemy, but lacking the al- Qaeda fighters' command of the terrain, and the avowed fanaticism of those who had chosen not to flee. With the help of three dozen US Special Forces operatives, who called in targeted air strikes, they slowly gained the upper hand, but the US forces were unprepared when, realizing that the remaining fighters were still well-armed and committed to martyrs' deaths, Ghamshank established radio contact with one of the Tora Bora commanders on December 12 and attempted to negotiate a ceasefire. Responding that they would only surrender to the UN, the commander requested extra time to discuss the matter, and said that he would get back in contact the following morning. Unsurprisingly, the return call never materialized. The Americans were outraged, arguing that the negotiations were just a ploy to allow time for the rest of the fighters to escape. They were TOR A BORA 29 almost certainly right, but their claim that 800 fighters escaped that night was wildly exaggerated, considering quite how many people (1,500 at least) had slipped away over the previous month through American squeamishness and inertia. 5 The Survivors When the Afghans took the last of the Tora Bora caves on December 16, 200 corpses } scattered around the mountains, testified to some kind of a victory, but there were few survivors. News reports at the time gave the impression that the prisoners captured at Tora Bora were the last men standing in some kind of final bloody siege, but the majority of them were in a group of recent recruits and religious students who were passing through a valley on their way to Pakistan when they were targeted in a US bombing raid. Another dozen or so were captured in the days before and after the end of hostilities was declared on December 16, and of these around 15 were Afghans, while the foreigners — ten men who were paraded in front of the world's media on December 17, six who were taken to a hospital in Jalalabad, and around 14 others — were handed over to US forces after four to six weeks in Afghan custody. 6 Some of the prisoners were questioned by US Special Farces while in Afghan custody — specifically for information on bin Lad en's whereabouts. A cameraman who was present while they spent four hours interrogating prisoners in a compound near Tora Bora reported, \"From what I could see through the crack in the door, the Special Forces were asking hard questions in Arabic, but not mistreating the prisoners in any way.\" On the same day, the six severely wounded prisoners were transported to the hospital in Jalalabad, where they too were questioned. One of them, described as \"Fehmi, a 20-something Yemeni fighter,\" said, \"Osama was with us in Tora Bora, but he stayed high in the mountains and rarely made contact. I think he is still up there somewhere or maybe he has escaped,\" an insight, that was about as useful as Donald Rumsfeld's comment, on December 13, \"I have seen reports that people believe are from reasonably reliable sources that, in one case, suggest he's still in Afghanistan, in another case suggest he's out of Afghanistan.\" 7 30 THE CUANTANAMO FILES In truth, it was unlikely that any of those captured would have been able to provide more detailed information on bin Lad en's whereabouts. Like the majority of those captured in Tor a Bora, 24- year-oid Fehrm al-Assani was a recent recruit to the Taliban cause, a foot soldier in an inter-Muslim civil war that had suddenly gone global. He traveled to Afghanistan in the summer of 2001, trained briefly at al-Farouq and ended up in Tora Bora, but only, he said, because \"I was fleeing for my life with many other people to avoid the bombing that was imminent,\" and not, as was alleged, because he \"was assigned to augment Taliban and ai-Qaeda forces already in defensive positions in Tora Bora.\" He added that he was with a group of Pakistanis, trying to get to Pakistan, when they were bombed by US forces and he was \"the sole survivor.\" 8 The rest of the prisoners in the hospital in Jalalabad appear to have been wounded in the other bombing raid mentioned above. With a few exceptions — in particular, Ayman Batarfi, a charismatic, 31-year- old Egyptian-born Yemeni doctor, who was to assume increasing importance for the Americans over the coming months (as described in Chapter 14) — they too were recent arrivals in Afghanistan, and their role in the \"War on Terror\" seems to have been as minimal as that of al-Assani. Abdullah al-Anazi, a 21-year-old Saudi, who lost a leg in the bombing raid (and had his other leg amputated at Guantanamo), said that he went to Afghanistan to provide spiritual assistance to the Afghans, and Walid Zaid, a 23 -year-old Yemeni who was wounded in the left foot in the raid, denied that he went to Afghanistan for \"jihad readiness military training,\" as alleged, and said that he had just finished his final year studying Arabic literature at college, and went to Afghanistan a fortnight before .9/11 because he hoped to teach Arabic in an Afghan school. He admitted attending al-Farouq, but. said that he had only done so because some Afghan acquaintances said that Afghanistan \"was a country with a great deal of fighting,\" and suggested that he should get some training in self-defense. y A rather more expansive story was told by Ghanim al-Harbi, a 27-year-old Saudi, who said that he went to Afghanistan in summer 2001 because he \"felt the need to defend myself and my family.\" He explained that some of his family members had been imprisoned during the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein, and had subsequently moved to Saudi Arabia, and that, in 2000, when it TORA BORA 31 was felt that the Iraqi leader was causing problems again, he decided that he should learn to defend himself. When his attempts to join the Saudi Navy came to nothing, his quest led him to Afghanistan. He admitted training at al-Farouq, but added, \"I never completed my training because I became ill. Every week I had to travel to Kandahar to receive medical treatment or I was at the camp hospital.\" He also said that Osama bin Laden had spoken at the camp, but that he had not attended because \"it was voluntary, I was sick and it gave me a chance to sleep,\" and explained that bin Laden \"is a radical with radical thoughts and I didn't want to be influenced by him.\" While this infuriated the Presiding Officer of his tribunal, who insisted, \"Al-Farouq trained al-Qaeda to kill,\" al-Harbi replied, \"That wasn't written about it. All I know [is that] there were a lot of people in al-Farouq training. To my knowledge, Osama bin Laden was just a guest and he would give a speech and just leave.\" This conflicts with the received intelligence about al-Farouq as \"bin Laden's camp,\" but it perhaps explains what the situation was actually like in summer 2001, as unprecedented numbers of volunteers arrived in Afghanistan for training. After leaving al-Farouq, al-Harbi said that he went to Kabul and hired a guide to help him leave the country, but when the guide realized he was unable to help him cross the border, he took him to the Tora Bora mountains and turned him over to a group of 65 Arabs who were also trying to escape. He explained that he stayed with them for the month of Ramadan, and described them as civilians rather than fighters: \"Some of them were teachers, some of them were running away from the war and were just regular civilians who were trying to get back to the Pakistan embassy so they could get back to their homes.\" Around December 13, he said that the group finally managed to recruit two guides to take them to the Pakistani border, but, as they passed through a village, the whole area was targeted in a huge US bombing raid, in which 60 to 70 of the villagers died, and \"40 of the Arabs with me were killed and 20 were injured\"; al-Harbi suffered serious injuries to his stomach and one of his legs. 10 Also captured after the raid were a handful of mostly older prisoners from countries other than Saudi Arabia or the Yemen, including Ahcene Zemiri, a 34-year-old Algerian, Faiz al-Kandan, a 26-year-old Kuwaiti, Abdul Latif Nassir, a 36-year-old Moroccan, 32 THE CUANTANAMO FILES Tariq al-Sawah, a 26-year-old Egyptian, who had been living in Bosnia, and two Tunisians, 35-year-old Riyad Nasseri and 36-year- old Abdul Ourgy. Zemin, who had been living in Canada, said that he moved to Afghanistan in June 2001 with his Canadian wife — who was pregnant at the time — \"to immigrate, live and retire peacefully,\" primarily because he and other North Africans were kept under non- stop scrutiny by the Canadian intelligence services. After the US-led invasion began, his wife managed to return safely to Canada, but he was trapped in the mountains, where he sustained a broken arm and shrapnel wounds in the bombing raid. 11 Al-Kandari and Nassir were interviewed by the journalist Jon Lee Anderson in jail in Jalalabad, shortly after their capture. Al-Kandari explained, \"The international community is mistaken about Arabs in Afghanistan. Not all are here for Osama bin Laden.\" He said that he was a businessman, adding, \"I have a lot of money, and I came here to Afghanistan to help Muslims. I came to dig wells.\" When Jalalabad fell, he explained that he met some Arabs, who \"said I should go into the mountains with them, and so I did and that's when I was caught.\" This is the story he has maintained throughout his imprisonment by the Americans, but it was regarded as unbelievable from the beginning. Anderson told him, \"This is hardly credible,\" and noted that the interpreter laughed while translating his story, \"and put his hand on the Kuwaiti's shoulder in a matey kind of way.\" Nassir told a rather different story, explaining, \"I came to Afghanistan because of Afghanistan's strict Islamic rule, and because it was full of Islamic scholars.\" He said that he was in Kabul when it fell to the Northern Alliance, and then escaped to Jalalabad and fled to the mountains. 12 The Tunisians — who had both been living in Italy in the 1990s — were subjected to more serious allegations. Nasseri was accused of training at the Durunta camp near Jalalabad, which was established by the warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in the early 1990s, 13 and of fleeing Jalalabad for a cave in Tora Bora, where he was injured during the LIS bombing, and where he \"and others arranged their surrender.\" Ourgy, who was injured in the bombing raid, said that he had been a drug dealer until he met a man in Milan who revived his faith and encouraged him to attend a training camp in Afghanistan. He admitted training at Durunta in 1997, but said that he had since settled down, and had married in 2000. He added that, after the fall TORA BORA 11 of Jalalabad, when Arabs were being killed, his brother-in-law took his wife to safety in Pakistan, but he stayed behind to pack up the household goods and then volunteered to go through the mountains to Pakistan: \"I couldn't go through the main road because I am an Arab. That way, when he [the brother-in-law] entered Pakistan with all these household goods there would be no problem.\" 14 In the months that followed, as the Americans began mining the prisoners for intelligence, seeking out connections, drawing on developments elsewhere in the \"War on Terror,\" and eliciting confessions that were often obtained through coercion or bribery, all the men described above came under increasing scrutiny. Zemin was erroneously linked to Ahmed Ressam, who had planned to blow up Los Angeles airport in a \"Millennium Plot\" at the end of 1999 (Ressam only recanted his \"confession\" in January 2007), al-Kandari was mysteriously transformed into a spiritual leader of al-Qaeda, and the North Africans were linked to an alleged web of militants, scattered throughout Europe, that first began to be pieced together by interrogators working in the US prison at Kandahar airbase. While these will be discussed in the chapters that follow, it's worth noting that the only ones who admitted to any kind of sustained military involvement were Abdul Latif Nassir and Tariq al-Sawah. In his interview with Jon Lee Anderson, Nassir explained more about his presence in Afghanistan. He said that, although he had been a businessman, he decided to become a fighter in Afghanistan, and attended a Libyan training camp in Kabul. While Faiz al-Kandari was vague about al-Qaeda's presence in Tora Bora, telling Anderson, \"The al-Qaeda didn't keep their people with us. Al-Qaeda takes its people to a big secret place in the mountains. There are a lot of secret things in al-Qaeda,\" Nassir admitted that he had seen Osama bin Laden in the mountains. \"He was in Tora Bora for a long time and he was receiving a lot of visitors,\" he said, adding that bin Laden told them, \"Believe in us, believe in Allah, believe in me, in this jihad. We will win in the end.\" 15 In contrast to Nassir, al-Sawah's military commitment was specifically directed at the Northern Alliance. A former aid worker, he was married to a Bosnian woman and went to Afghanistan to see if it was a suitable place to take his family. Once there, he succumbed to the most virulent anti-Massoud propaganda, declaring, \"One time in a 34 THE CUANTANAMO FILES jihad > Massoud killed about 10,000 Muslims in an hour,\" and decided that it was his mission to support those who were being oppressed by the Northern Alliance. He insisted, \"There are no rules in the United States to prevent it if you want to fight for religion. There are no rules to direct me not to defend people,\" and also pointed out that he went to Afghanistan to fight the Northern Alliance before 9/11, when it was no business of the Americans: \"If Massoud and Dostum are American allies, they were not an alliance before September 11th, were they?\" Charged up with his new-found fervor, he became a trainer at a military camp, but denied engaging in hostilities against the US, saying, in a comment that cut to the heart of the proxy war, \"There was no fighting against Americans. If there were any American soldiers saying they were fighting in Afghanistan, bring them here to me and show the evidence.\" Mentioning a well-founded belief that numerous prisoners were sold for money (which is discussed in more detail in the next chapter), he explained that \"because the Americans offered $5,000 to anyone who captured us, they [the Northern Alliance! \"were fighting us and they kept us alive to get the $5,000.\" Injured in the bombing raid, after spending a month in the mountains, he gave a poignant description of his departure from Jalalabad, in which he emphasized that the war in Afghanistan and the fall of the Taliban had triggered an exodus of all kinds of people, not just al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters: \"We left, everything. We were moving through mountains and caves; there were hundreds of families, children, women and people were climbing through the mountains. What were we to do? Some people were escaping from other fronts, near Jalalabad and Kabul. There were too many people there.\" 16 The rest of those captured after the raid appear to be as inconsequential to the \"War on Terror\" as those detained in the hospital. Several claimed that they were in Afghanistan on a religious mission. The 27-year-old Saudi Sultan al-Anazi (released in 2006) traveled to Pakistan before .9/11 to study with Jamaat-al-Tabhghi, and then went to Jalalabad on a specific mission. After the collapse of the Taliban, he said that \"Afghanis would look for Arabs to hold as hostages or kill so they could take our money and possessions,\" and described how he fled with the other Tablighi members to a village near Tor a Bora, where they waited for an opportunity to escape that never came: \"When I was in the village ,.. it was bombed by the TORA BORA IS United States and I decided to give up because I didn't want to die. Many people were killed as a result of the bombing of the village and I didn't want to be next. The people from Jamaat-al-Tablighi that I fled with were killed by the airraids and I was injured.\" Mohammed Khusruf, a Yemeni who was caught after the bombing raid, said that he went to Afghanistan to teach the Koran, and asked, \"Is it really reasonable that al-Qaeda or the Taliban, in bad need of men to fight, have to go to Yemen to find men at 60 years old to fight? Is this logical?\" He admitted training at al-Farouq, but said that he only did so because the man who arranged his travel told him he needed to be able to defend himself. Saleh al-Zuba, a 46-year-old Yemeni (released in December 2006), also had a non-military explanation for being in Afghanistan. Accused of fighting in Tor a Bora, he said that he had coronary artery disease and went to Pakistan for medical treatment, and was only in Afghanistan because he did not have enough money for an operation, and was told that a charitable organization in Afghanistan might provide extra funding. 17 Only one of these prisoners — Sulaiman al-Nahdi, a 27-year-old Yemeni — admitted to any kind of presence in Tora Bora that could be construed as military, but his experience hardly marks him out as a member of al-Qaeda. Inspired by Sheikh al-Uqla's fatwa, he spent a month at al-Farouq, saw Osama bin Laden in Tora Bora, when he \"talked about the jihad for approximately one hour and then a senior al-Qaeda operative [identified as Ayman al-ZawahiriJ made a few comments,\" and then went into the mountains, where he took turns guarding a foxhole with 15 other people. Responding to an allegation that he \"may have fought in Tora Bora,\" he said, \"I never fired a weapon. I was only sitting,\" and, when asked if he would have shot at Americans, he echoed Tariq al-Sawah's comments: \"I did not see any Americans. If I had seen any Americans, I would not have shot at them. I would have only shot at them if they had shot at me first, to defend myself.\" 18 The stories of the remaining prisoners — with the exception of two men whose experiences are so emblematic of the catch-all definitions of \"enemy combatants\" that I'm using them to close this chapter — are riddled with the kind of anomalies that arise when prisoners are captured by proxy armies and the rule of law is brushed aside, to be replaced by a shadowy series of allegations and counter-allegations. 16 THE CUANTANAMO FILES Abdul Rahman Khowlan, a 29-year-old Saudi, denied allegations that he trained at al-Farouq and was captured in Tora Bora. He said that he was captured in Jalalabad, and explained that he went to Afghanistan to \"retrieve the clothing of the Prophet Mohammed from a shrine in Kandahar with financial backing from a prominent Saudi businessman,\" a mission which, if successful, would have made him \"more popular than Michael Jackson.\" (He was released in December 2006, which perhaps indicates that there was some truth in his fantastical story.) Yasin Ismail, a 19-year-old Yemeni, denied an allegation that he fought in Tora Bora. Although he admitted training at al-Farouq, he said that he was only in Tora Bora because he was forcibly taken to a house there after being kidnapped in a market place in Kabul while attempting to leave the country after 9/11. Tarek Dergoul, a 24-year-old Briton (released in March 2004), also insisted that he had not been in Tora Bora. A non-practicing Muslim, born to Moroccan parents in London's Mile End, he had been a mini-cab driver and a carer in an old people's home, and went to Pakistan for a holiday in July 2001, intrigued by descriptions of the country provided by British friends whose parents were from Pakistan. Speaking after his release, he said that, having decided, with two Pakistani friends, to invest in property in Afghanistan in the hope that they could sell it for a profit after the war, the three men were close to securing a deal, and were spending the night in an empty villa in Jalalabad, when it was hit by an American bomb. His friends were killed, and he was wounded and unable to walk, and only survived for a week — until he was discovered by Alliance soldiers — because a water tap was still working, and he had a few biscuits and raisins in his pockets. Although the soldiers treated him well, taking him to a hospital, where he had three operations on his left arm, which had been badly injured by shrapnel, they subsequently sold him to the Americans, who insisted that he had fought in Tora Bora and eventually forced a false confession out of him. 19 The last two prisoners to be discussed in connection with Tora Bora are Fouad al-Rabia, a 42-year-old Kuwaiti, and Mahrar al- Quwari, a 36-year-old Palestinian (who was cleared for release in 2007). Married with four children, al-Rabia, who had been working for Kuwait Airways as an engineer since he was 21, explained that he regularly did relief work in his spare time, and was approached TORA BORA 37 one day, at a health club that he part-owned, by a member who told him about Afghanistan's problems and asked him to visit to see for himself. Unaware that the young man, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, was a spokesman for al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, al-Rabia took a ten-day vacation from work in June 2001 and traveled to Afghanistan \"to see the refugees and to assist with their situation.\" He was accompanied by a religious student called Abu Muldah, who took him to meet Osama bin Laden in Kandahar, thinking that he might be an important symbolic figure in Islam, a shepherd-like leader who would guide the people to a higher calling, but explained that he was disappointed when he met him. \"Abu Muldah asked bin Laden his opinion about killing innocent people,\" al-Rabia said. \"I think Abu Muldah was referring to the [embassy] bombing [s] in Africa. Bin Laden replied, he did not order the bombing but was not shocked by it. Bin Laden cited words [in] Arabic stating, *I do not order massacres, but I do not object if I see them.'\" After this unpromising start, al-Rabia arranged meetings with the governor of Kandahar, where he also met representatives of the UN Commission for Refugees and the World Food Program, and with officials from the Ministries of Health and Public Works, and when he returned to Kuwait, he compiled a report and approached the head of the government-backed Kuwaiti Joint Relief Council, who \"was convinced from my research that Afghanistan was a genuine disaster area.\" He said that the charity decided that, although they would not work directly with the Taliban, they would reopen their office in Peshawar, and would appoint him as the head of the office. Having arranged for a year's leave, he set off on a further fact-finding mission to Afghanistan on October 3, 2001, arriving, with unfortunate timing, as \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" commenced in a blizzard of bombs. After spending a month traveling between Herat, Kandahar and Kabul, and finding that the situation for Arabs was becoming inhospitable in each of these cities, he ended up in Jalalabad, where hundreds of Arabs were escaping in mini-buses to a house on the edge of Jalalabad that belonged to a man called Abdul Qadus, who \"turned out to be a very big man in al-Qaeda\" (a Yemeni, Qadus was the military commander of the Tora Bora base). From there, the refugees made their way on foot into the mountains. Overweight and unable to manage the climb, al-Rabia was provided with a mule, and 38 THE CUANTANAMO FILES explained that when he reached the top of the mountain, he \"could see the chaos that was going on. They did not respect people. It was way above their heads. Everything there had collapsed. They were arguing over food and things like that.\" Qadus told him to look after the \"issue counter,\" where supplies were being handed out: \"He told me because of my age, no one would scream, shout or argue with me. So I would sit there and say, give this person a blanket, give this person rice, and so forth ,,. This lasted for a week.\" After another two weeks, in which he oversaw six or seven mules, which were used to collect water, he was allowed to leave, and Qadus arranged for him to travel down from the mountains. After staying in a village for a week, Alliance soldiers arrived in the village, \"took several people as hostages, and stated if they were not given the injured people from the village, the hostages would be killed. So, the remaining injured people were the prize — myself and the other injured gentleman that, was walking with me,\" 20 The \"injured gentleman\" was Mahrar al-Quwari, who, like al- Rabia, became involved with Abdul Qadus by accident. After traveling to Pakistan on a fruitless visit to get \"official identification\" for his family from the UN, he went to Afghanistan, found a job in Jalalabad, but fled the city \"when the coalition forces accused the Arabs of killing Massoud.\" He explained that he met Qadus while fleeing through the mountains, and helped him organize food for the other refugees, and Qadus then arranged for him to be taken to a village, where he was looked after by a family who were supposed to help him to get to Pakistan. Taking up the story after the hostage-taking scenario described by al-Rabia, he said that he was driven to Jalalabad, where he was sold at a checkpoint and taken to a prison. \"The next day,\" he said, \"the commander of the checkpoint told me they would get paid $5,000 for me. He said if I could pay him more than that he would release me. I didn't have any money. The next day vehicles came and they took me from Jalalabad to a Kabul prison,\" where the prison commander \"told me they got paid $10,000 for me,\" and where \"they tortured us for the month we were there.\" When asked if anyone was with him when he was captured, he replied, \"Fouad al- Rabia, he came down from the mountain with me. It was him, some Afghans and I. The same amount of money that was offered for me TORA BORA 39 was also offered for him. We were given to the Americans in Bagram and I haven't seen him since.\" 21 At the end of the Tor a Bora campaign, when the Americans had paid millions of dollars to their Afghan allies, and had spent untold amounts on the horrific bombs — including several \"daisy-cutters\" — that had laid waste to the mountains, the capture of the men described in this chapter was supposed to make up for the fact that the entire leadership of al-Qaeda escaped from under their noses. While Abdul Qadus was conducting military operations against the US in eastern Afghanistan in January 2002, al-Rabia and al-Quwari were just starting their nightmare in US custody, in which al-Rabia, despite his frank admissions of how he"
