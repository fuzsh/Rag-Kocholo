        "text": "5 - 5:50 PM\n\n\"Lost Child or Lost Fatherhood?: Confucian Structure of Feeling Reinterpreted in Contemporary Chinese Language Cinema\"\n\nJing Zhang, New College of Florida\n\nAbstract: Filial piety and the father-son relationship constitute the core of the “Confucian structure of feeling” in traditional China. While the last two decades saw a rapid economic growth and cultural globalization in China, they also witnessed a revival of traditional values, promoted through state propaganda and education, elite discourse, popular culture, and even legalization. It is in this context that I will discuss the theme of parental love in recent Chinese language films, examining it as an inversion or reinterpretation of filial sentiment pervasive in early modern Chinese literature. I will focus on two recent films of China and Hong Kong collaboration, Dearest (2014) and Lost and Love (2015), one made by the Hong Kong director Peter Chan and the other by novelist and television screenwriter Peng Sanyuan as her directorial debut. Both films base their stories in news reports of child abduction, focus on the parents’ relentless search for their lost kids, and dramatize the multilayered tension between parental relationship, morality, and law. I will also trace the motif of “looking for a lost child/father” back to the early Modern Chinese narratives and its reincarnations in several films made at critical historical moments.\n\n6 - 6:50 PM\n\n\"In Her Own Voice: History, Memory and Female Subjectivity in Greek Cinema\"\n\nVassiliki Rapti, Harvard University\n\nAbstract: Within the male-dominated Greek cinema, several pioneering women directors made their appearance in the 1980s and distinguished themselves to the point that we can talk about a feminine Greek cinematic vision. This talk will focus on the distinct features of this powerful yet little known cinematic vision, and tackle female subjectivity as caught up in between History and memory. By analyzing several path-breaking films such as The Price of Love (1984) and Crystal Nights (1992) by Tonia Marketaki, Love Wanders in the Night (1981) and The Years of the Big Heat (1991) by Frieda Liappa, and Hold Me (2006) and the documentary The Aegean in the Words of Poets (2003) by Loukia Rikaki, where the personal drama is conditioned by the larger circumstances, it will show how female subjectivity is shaped by desire nurtured by memory and agency against History.\n\n6:50 – 7:20 pm: Q and A and Discussion\n\nApril 1, 2016 Film Screenings at Angell Hall Auditorium B, 435 State Street\n\n6 pm : Dearest (2014). 130 min. Directed by Peter Chan\n\n8:10 pm : The Aegean in the Words of the Poets (2003). 61 min. Directed by Loukia Rikaki\n\nBiographies\n\nJing Zhang is Associate Professor of Chinese Language and Culture at New College of Florida. She holds a B.
