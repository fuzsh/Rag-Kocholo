        "text": "Does a modern audience expect a Greek play always to end in tragedy? This paper examines the reception of ancient drama in the Greek film industry of the 1960s. Two cinematic receptions of Sophocles and Euripides were produced within a period of less than three years: George Tzavellas' 'Antigone' (1961) and Michael Cacoyannis' 'Electra' (1962). The two directors took pains to emphasize the tragic aspects of their source texts even going so far as to make changes to them in order to meet this expectation. In my discussion I contextualize this phenomenon and investigate the high cultural value that the Greek state assigned to ancient drama.\n\nThis valuable anthology on Greek cinema edited by Lydia Papadimitriou and Yannis Tzioumakis – the first to be published in English as a book – makes a wide and twofold gesture towards international and Greek academia. It calls for the reevaluation of a vibrant, multivalent and fascinating, though marginal European film culture and also for a rethinking of the parameters for the study of Greek film. This gesture towards recognition and reassessment is particularly compelling since it occurs at a very critical but propitious moment: when Greek film, having crossed the borders to become a celebrated new voice on the international festival circuit, is marked by unusual extroversion; when – although nation-centric approaches have become less relevant in Film Studies – a growing focus on peripheral and small-nation cinemas has opened up a new space for neglected cinematic traditions; and finally, when the country’s precarious financial situation has brought about a renegotiation of Greek ...\n\nThis article is an updated and extended version of the introductory text that was written on the occasion of the tribute to Young Greek Cinema which was organized by the 45th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, in 2011. A shorter updated version was also published in Kinecko (Czech Republic), no. 16, 2013: 2-4.
