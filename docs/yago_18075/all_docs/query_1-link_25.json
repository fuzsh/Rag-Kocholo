        "text": "Welcome to WOW2 — Late-July!\n\nWOW2 is asister blog toThis Week in the War on Women.This edition covers women and events just from July 23 to July 31. Since I’ve broken the data limit on individual diaries, I’m trying splitting WOW2 into three posts this month.\n\nThis is an on-going, evolving project. So many women have been added to the lists over the past three years that even changing the posts from monthly to twice a month, the pages kept getting longer and more unwieldy – an astonishing and wonderful problem to have!\n\nThe purpose of WOW2 is to learn about and honor women of achievement, including many who’ve been ignored or marginalized in most of the history books, and to mark moments in women’s history. It also serves as a reference archive of women’s history.There are so many morephenomenal women than I ever dreamed of finding, and all too often their stories are almost unknown, even to feminists and scholars.\n\n_________________________________\n\nMany thanksto WOW2’s Assistant Editorlibera nos — not only for volunteering to be the proofreader for WOW2, but for also contributing to the research. Any remaining mistakes are either mine, or uncaught computer glitches in transferring the data from his emails to DK5.\n\n_________________________________\n\nFor theentire previous LATE JULY lists as of 2018,\n\nclick HERE: www.dailykos.com/...\n\nOtherwise, what you’re seeing on this LATE-JULY2019 pageare the newpeopleand events, or additional information and visuals,\n\nfound since last year.\n\nThese trailblazers have a lot to teach us about persistence in the face of overwhelming odds. I hope you will find reclaiming our past as much of an inspiration as I do.\n\nThis Week in the War on Women\n\nhas posted, so be sure to go there next to catch\n\nup on the latest dispatches from the frontlines:\n\nwww.dailykos.com/...\n\nLate-July’s Women Trailblazersand Events in Our History\n\nNote: All images and audios are belowthe person or event to which they refer\n\n_________________________________\n\nJuly 23, 1721 – Anna Dorothea Therbusch born in Germany, Polish Rococo painter; elected to the Stuttgart Academy of the Arts, the Bologna Academy, the Académie Royale in Paris, and the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.\n\nJuly 23, 1844 – Harriet Williams Russell Strong born, American agriculturist, inventor, and conservation activist; pioneer of innovations in water storage and flood control; music composer; a leader of the West Coast woman suffrage movement; first woman member of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.\n\nJuly 23, 1889 – Anna Akhmatova born, Ukrainian-Russian poet and author.\n\nJuly 23, 1892 – Icie Macy Hoobler born, biochemist and physiologist, first woman to head a local section of American Chemical Society and to serve as its national president; Director of the Research Laboratory funded by the Children’s Fund of Michigan. After receiving her Ph.D. from Yale, she started working at Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh as an assistant chemist. Hoobler was not allowed to eat in the dining hall for doctors, as all the other doctors were male, and she was not allowed to eat in the nurses' dining hall for bureaucratic reasons, so she ate with the hospital employees.The hospital only had restrooms for men, and Hoobler had to use a restroom in a public building a half-block down the street. Due to this, she limited her trips to the restroom, and after a few months she developed acute nephritis (kidney inflammation), and was urged to take a year's leave of absence. Upon expressing her dissatisfaction to the chief of the laboratory, she was told that she would soon get used to the conditions. Hoobler resigned. A day after her resignation, the board of trustees president asked her why she decided to resign and why she didn't attend the annual staff banquet, which the chief of the laboratory had not invited her to because he didn't think she would want to be with \"all those men.\" After the president chastised the chief of the laboratory, Hoobler's treatment at the hospital improved. In 1923, during her year’s leave to recuperate from nephritis, Hoobler taught at the University of California at Berkeley. She was offered the position of Director of the Nutrition Research Project of the Merril-Palmer School for Motherhood and Child Development, where she spent the next 31 years directing the laboratory and then served as a research consultant from 1954 to 1974. Under her direction, the laboratory published 300 journal articles and several books on subjects ranging from the metabolism of women during the reproductive cycle to the chemistry of the red blood cell.\n\nJuly 23, 1900 – Julia Davis Adams born, American author, social worker, journalist and playwright, known for historical and biographical novels, young adult books, and dramas; used the pen name F.

Rubin got her Master’s at Cornell, and her PhD at Georgetown, in spite of having to battle sexism at almost every step. When the men at the Palomar Observatory told her, ‘It’s a real problem because we don’t have a ladies room,’ she cut a piece of paper into a skirt and stuck it on the male figure on the door to one of the men’s restrooms. She said, ‘Look, now you have a ladies room.’ Rubin did the pioneering work on galaxy rotation rates, uncovering the discrepancy between the predicted angular motion of galaxies and the observed motion, by studying galactic rotation curves, which became known as the galaxy rotation problem, work that was compelling evidence of the existence of dark matter. Rubin’s results were met with great skepticism, but over subsequent decades, they were confirmed. She was a strong advocate and mentor of women in science; honored with numerous awards, including the Bruce Medal, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, and the National Medal of Science, but was never honored with a Nobel Prize.\n\nJuly 23, 1928 – Ruth Whitney born, pioneering editor of Glamour magazine for 31 years (1967 – 1998), among the first editors to introduce relevant social topics to a woman’s magazine, and the first to feature an African American, Katiti Kironde (then an undergraduate at Harvard), on the cover of the magazine’s August 1968 issue.\n\nJuly 23, 1931 – Te Arikinui (Paramount Chief) Dame Te Atairangikaahu born, Māori queen for 40 years, the longest reign of any Māori monarch; Te Atairangikaahu means ‘hawk of the morning sky’; in 1979, first Māori appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire; she was a strong supporter of Māori cultural events, and a spokesperson on indigenous issues.\n\nJuly 23, 1940 – Danielle Collobert born, French author, poet and journalist; she worked at the Galerie Hautefeuille, a major art photography gallery, in Paris in the early 1960s while writing what would become her novel, Meurtre (Murder), and her first published book, Chants des Guerres (War Songs).

In 2010, she was one of the performers in Channel 4’s Comedy Gala, a benefit for the Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital. She has written several books, including the novel The More You Ignore Me, which she adapted as a feature-film script. She was the presenter of The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice (2014-2017).\n\nJuly 23, 1959 – Nancy Savoca born, American film director, producer and screenwriter; noted for True Love (which won the Sundance Film Festival 1989 Grand Jury Prize), If These Walls Could Talk, and The 24-Hour Woman.\n\nJuly 23, 1970 – Thea Dorn born, German novelist and playwright; since 2004, also the TV host of Literatur im Foyer, a show featuring interviews with authors and book reviews.\n\nJuly 23, 1976 – Judit Polgár born, Hungarian Grandmaster in chess, considered the strongest woman player of all time; achieved the Grandmaster title at 15 years, 4 months, breaking the Youngest Grandmaster record previously held by World Champion Bobby Fischer; she was also the youngest player to break into the FIDE Top 100 players rating list, ranking #55 in the world at the age of 12; in 2005, she became the first, and to date, only woman to qualify for a World Championship Tournament, to surpass a 2700 Elo, reaching a career peak of 2735, and to reach a world ranking of #8; she held the title of #1 ranked woman in the world from 1989 to 2014, when she was briefly overtaken by Chinese player Hou Yifan, but regained her #1 ranking in 2015, shortly after announcing her retirement from competitive chess; she is the only woman to win a game against a reigning World Champion.

She returned to the Navy in 1924, where she was an early supporter of machine support to code cracking. Driscoll was a major player in breaking the Japanese Navy manual codes – the Red Book Code in 1926, and the Blue Book Code in 1930; early in 1935, she was a leading member of the team cracking the Japanese M-1 cipher machine used by the Japanese Navy for encrypting messages to their naval attachés in embassies around the world. In 1940, she was doing critical preliminary work on JN-25, the Japanese fleet’s operational code, before she was transferred to a U.S. team working on the German Enigma cipher, but their approach proved fruitless. She was reassigned in 1943 to a team already working on the Japanese Coral cipher; however, the code was broken by others shortly after her arrival. Driscoll was in the U.S. Navy contingent which joined the Armed Forces Security Agency in 1949, and then the National Security Agency in 1952. She retired in 1959.\n\nJuly 24, 1897 – Amelia Earhart born, American aviator; first woman pilot to fly solo across the American continent (1928) and across the Atlantic (1932); in 1931, became an official of the National Aeronautic Association, promoted the establishment of separate women’s records; member of the Ninety-Nines (named for the number of charter members), a women pilots organization which promoted women in aviation; her plane went missing in the Pacific en route to Howland Island during an attempt to fly around the world in 1937; there have been numerous searches and theories about what happened, but no trace of the plane, Earhart or her navigator Fred Noonan has been found.\n\nJuly 24, 1900 – Zelda Fitzgerald born, American author, poet and socialite; she and her husband F. Scott Fitzgerald became symbols of the Jazz Age in the 1920s. Her only published novel, the semi-autobiographical Save Me the Waltz (1932), was poorly received, but F. Scott Fitzgerald had insisted she make major alternations prior to publication, as much of what she had written overlapped events he was using in his as-yet unfinished novel Tender is the Night. It has since been reevaluated somewhat more favorably. She spent much of her life from the mid-1930s until her death in and out of sanitoriums. In 1948, she was locked in a room awaiting electroshock therapy when a fire engulfed the Highland Hospital’s main building in Asheville NC, killing her and eight other women.\n\nJuly 24, 1914 – Frances Oldham Kelsey born in Canada, Canadian-American pharmacologist and physician. She was hired in 1960 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, one of only seven full-time and four part-time physicians reviewing drugs for the FDA. One of her first assignments was to review an application by Richardson Merrell for the drug thalidomide (under the tradename Kevadon) as a tranquilizer and painkiller with specific indications to prescribe the drug to pregnant women for morning sickness. Even though it had already been approved in Canada and over 20 European and African countries, she refused to authorize thalidomide for market, and requested further studies. She resisted pressure from the drug manufacturer to approve the drug because of an unexplained nervous system side effect in an English study, and she insisted on a full testing of thalidomide. Her concerns proved justified when thalidomide began to be linked to serious birth defects in Europe. Kelsey’s insistence on full testing, backed by her FDA superiors, made headlines and helped to pass the 1962 Kefauver Harris Amendment to strengthen drug regulation, the same year she was honored with the President’s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service by President John F.

Though initially pilloried for her testimony, public opinion began to shift in her favor as time passed.

By 1992, harassment complaints to the EEOC were up by 50%. Private companies started training programs to deter sexual harassment. The manner in which the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee challenged and dismissed Hill's accusations of sexual harassment angered woman politicians, lawyers and feminists. According to D.C. Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, Hill's treatment by the panel was a contributing factor to the large number of women elected to Congress in 1992. \"Women clearly went to the polls with the notion in mind that you had to have more women in Congress,\" she said.
