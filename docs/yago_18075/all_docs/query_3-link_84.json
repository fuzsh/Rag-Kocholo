        "text": "Athens is loaded with museums. It seems like there are new museums and branches of old museums opening every week. You can check the Athens News for traveling exhibits and this page will give you information on the main museums that should not be missed. An excellent book to get is The Museums of Athens by Aristidis Michalopoulos which is the most complete guide to Athens Museums that I have found. It contains opening and closing hours, entrance fees, and maps and descriptions on how to get to museums in Athens and Pireaus, the suburbs and nearby islands. Be sure to visit my History of Greece which will make visiting these museums even more meaningful.\n\nNational Archaeological Museum\n\nThe National Archaeological Museum ranks among the top ten museums in the world. Its impressive collection is housed in a beautiful neoclassic building near the juncture of Alexandras Avenue on Patission Avenue. There is a gift shop, and a cafe in the sculpture garden. Children under 6 and EU students get in free. Be sure to see the Antikithira Device, an ancient computer that will change the way you think about the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe museum is a five minute walk from Victoria Station and a 10 minute walk from Omonia. The Trolly #'s 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,11,13, and 15 all stop there.\n\nHours:\n\nTue-Fri: 8am-7pm\n\nMon:12:30pm-7pm\n\nSat, Sun & Holidays:8:30am-3pm\n\nSee my Photo Tour of the National Museum of Archaeology\n\nThe Acropolis Museum\n\nThe new Acropolis Museum was designed to offer the best conditions for the exhibition of its exhibits. A walk through its galleries is a walk through history between the masterpieces of the Archaic and Classical periods, but also in the ancient neighborhoods of Athens whose city streets and buildings you can see below when you look through the glass floors of the museum. It was hoped that by building the Acropolis Museum, the British Museum would return the Elgin Marbles, but don't hold your breath. In the meantime there are copies of those pieces to go along with the thousands of ancient stones and statues that finally have a home, worthy of them. Don't miss this museum.\n\nGeneral admission fee: 5 euros.\n\nReduced admission fee: 3 euros.\n\nFree admission\n\n(Ask if you are entitled to free admission. You have to be a member of parliament, student from an EU country, a child under 5 and a few other types. If you are not allowed to get in free you may be able to get in for the reduced admission if you are a student from a non EU country or a senior citizen from an EU country).\n\nMuseum Hours:\n\nTuesday to Sunday: 8.00 a.m. to 8.00 p.m.\n\nLast admission: 7.30 p.m.\n\nGalleries cleared at 7.45 p.m.\n\nThe Museum is open every Friday until 10 p.m.\n\nMonday: Closed.\n\nClosed: 1 January, 25 March, Easter Sunday, 1 May, 25 December and 26 December.\n\nTo get here by metro just get off at the Acropolis stop on the red line. If you are walking it is right down from Dionysiou Areopagitou where it intersects with Makrianni Street on the south side of the Acropolis.\n\nThe Benaki Museum\n\nThough the National Archaeology Museum gets all the press, in my opinion it is the Benaki which is the best museum in Athens and certainly the most important in terms of the history of both ancient and modern Greece as well as art and culture. I would also suggest that it is every Greek-American, Greek-Canadian, Greek-Australian and anyone who is of Greek origin or has an interest in Greece to visit the Benaki for a better understanding of the country which is modern Greece. Starting at the bottom floor with the ancient stuff and going up through the various periods of Greek history, my favorite part is the third floor and the heroes of the Greek Revolution and the birth of the modern state of Hellas. Just walk up Vass Sophias from Syntagma with the National Gardens on your right. Then you reach the end of the Gardens look to your left and that is it. The Benaki has opened two more branches in the area around Psiri on Agios Asamaton Street and on Pireaos Street. They also have an excellent gift shop with historic prints, many of which are on display in my home in North Carolina.\n\nVassilisis Sofias and 1 Koumbari street (between Kolonaki Square and the National Gardens).\n\nTel 367-1000\n\nThe opening hours are:\n\nWeds - Friday - Saturday: 9.00 - 17.00\n\nMonday and Tuesday closed\n\nThursday: 9.00 - 22.00\n\nSunday: 9.00 - 15.00 Herakleidon Museum of Art\n\nMr. Paul Firos and his wife Anna-Belinda, collectors and art lovers, were inspired to create this new private museum by their love of neoclassic buildings and their commitment to preserve such buildings. This is combined with their desire to share with others their enthusiasm for the fine arts and thus contribute to the artistic life of Athens. The museum's mission is to introduce visitors to the art of the exhibited artist, to show how the artist has evolved through the various important periods in his or her career, to explain the various techniques used by the artist to express his or her vision, and to help the visitors connect to both the artist's life and work. To accomplish this, not only will works of the artist be on exhibit, but also preparatory sketches, drawings, photographs and personal items.\n\nSee Herakleidon Museum of Art\n\n16 Herakleidon St., Thissio\n\nTel.: 210 34 61 981\n\nFax: 210 34 58 225e-mail\n\nThe Hellenic Motor Museum\n\nThese cars are the collection of Theodore N. Charagionis and they are on display in a beautiful modern building just a couple blocks from the National Archaeological Museum. I may be criticized for saying this but if I had to choose one museum to visit this would be it. But after 45 years of looking at ancient artifacts I may be a bit jaded.\n\nThe Museum is open from Tuesday to Saturday from noon to 9pm and on Sunday from 11 to 6pm. The building that houses the museum, the Athenian Capitol complex, is a multi-activity center for the Athenian future, that combines retail, culture and leisure and is located strategically between the National Archaeological Museum and Victoria Station. The address is 3rd September, 33-35 Iouliannou & Patission Streets. If you are coming from the ArchaeologyMuseum turn to your right and walk down Patission Ave for 2 blocks and turn left on Iouliannou. If you are coming from the Victoria metro station, with the square behind you go right on 3rd of September Street and walk 4 short blocks.\n\nSee Hellenic Motor Museum (The car in the photo belonged to Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art\n\nThe Museum of Cycladic Art is dedicated to the study and promotion of ancient cultures of the Aegean and Cyprus, with special emphasis on Cycladic Art of the 3rd millennium BC.

Since then it has grown in size to accommodate new acquisitions, obtained either through direct purchases or through donations by important collectors and institutions.\n\nHours:\n\nMonday - Wednesday - Friday - Saturday: 10:00 - 17:00\n\nThursday: 10:00 - 20:00\n\nSunday: 11:00 - 17:00\n\nTuesday: closed\n\nOn Sunday May 6th, the Museum will remain closed due to the elections.\n\nPublic Holidays (museum is closed): 1 January, Easter, Easter Monday, Spirit Monday, 1 May, 25 December, 26 December, Shrove Monday, 25 March, 15 August.\n\n4 Neofytou Douka St, Koloniki\n\nTel 722-8321 or 722-8323\n\nKerameikos Museum\n\n148 Ermou\n\n346-3552\n\nTues-Sun:8:30 to 3\n\nClosed Monday\n\nThe ancient cemetery of Athens at the bottom of Ermou past the Monastiraki flea market has a nice little museum.

Open daily except Mondays from 10am to 2pm.\n\nJewish Museum\n\n39 Nikis street at Kydatheneon in the Plaka\n\nTel 323-1577\n\nBefore the Nazi occupation and the decimation of Greece's Jewish population, many of Greece's Jewish communities traced their roots back to the Spanish Inquisition and before to Classical Greece. Art and artifacts from Jewish communities through the ages, as well as documentation of the Holocaust makes this museum a cultural treasure. This museum was the creation of my 9th grade history teacher Nikos Stavrolakis. Opening hours: Daily 9.00-2.30, except Saturdays and Sundays 10.00-2.00\n\nSee Nikos Stavrolakis Short History of the Jews in Greece\n\nNational Gallery\n\n50 vas Konstandinou street (opposite the Hilton)\n\nTel 723-5937\n\nThe permanent collection of modern Greek painters and international contempory artists includes large-scale sculptures.

Open daily from 9am to 1:30pm. Closed Mondays. Free on Sunday.\n\nThe Gastronomy Museum\n\nIf you love food, (and who doesn't?) then this may be the museum for you. Located in a restored late-19th-century mansion off Athinas Street in Psiri, five minutes walk from the Central Market, the word museum does not tell the whole story since it is also a shop and a restaurant where you can have one of the most educational meals you have ever eaten.\n\nThe Gastronomy Museum is shut only one day a week, Monday, and serves coffee from 10 a.m., meals from noon to 9:00, and drinks until after midnight. Some of the activities planned include showings of films with a food theme, such as Babettes Feast or Politiki Kouzina (aka A Touch of Spice), cooking lessons for adults, food-related events for kids, talks and book presentations. They also plan to change exhibitions a couple of times a year, to highlight cooking from different periods or regions.\n\nAgiou Dimitriou 13, downtown Athens\n\nTelephone: +30 210 321 1311\n\nHours: 10am-late; kitchen open noon-9pm; closed Monday\n\nLalaounis Jewelry Museum\n\nThe Ilias Lalaounis Jewelry Museum is a unique museum devoted to the art of jewelry and the decorative arts.

This dreadnought cruiser is one of the few left on the planet. The Averof was launched on the 27th February 1910 and arrived at Faliro Bay on the 1st of September 1911, where the Greeks welcomed it with enthusiasm. The ship saw its first action in the First Balkan War of 1912 under the command of Admiral Pavlos Kontouriotis. The ship ruled the northeast Aegean and was an important part in the liberation of Mount Athos and the islands of Limnos, Thasos, Samothraki, Tenedos, Aghios Eustratios, Mitilini, and Chios. The power of this ship and the success in the Aegean kept the Turkish Sultan from challenging the Greek Navy and kept the Turkish Navy out of the Aegean.\n\nJune-Sept\n\nOpen M-F 9-13:00\n\nM-W-F 18:00-20:00\n\nS-S and Holidays 10-14:00 and 18:00-20:00\n\nOct-May\n\nM-F 9-13:00\n\nM-W-F 15:00-17:00\n\nS-S and Holidays 10:00-14:00\n\nNearby is the reconstructed ancient Greek Trireme Olympias built in 1987.

The whole complex is laid out in a way that showcases the Greek spirit in a unique fashion. In the contemporary part, one of the most important and representative collections of its kind in the world is exhibited, comprising paintings, installations and sculptures by leading Greek artists, displaying a Greek interpretation of most of the international artistic currents of the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe folk art section, is an extraordinary complex of 19th century buildings, courtyards and gardens or rather a re-adaptation and readjustment of traditional Greek architectural features housing antiquities, icons, ceramics, popular artifacts and objects used in daily Greek life centuries ago, in a manner, revealing their inherent beauty and their practical use.\n\nThe gardens, wild and consisting almost entirely of Mediterranean flora are an indispensable part.\n\nHours\n\nSaturday & Sunday: 10:00 - 14:00\n\nWeekdays by appointment only and for groups of twenty (20) persons or more.\n\n1 Parodos Diadochou Constantinou St.,\n\nPaiania, Attiki\n\nTel.
