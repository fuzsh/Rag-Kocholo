        "text": "The Crystal Fury is a subspecies of Night Furies that have evolved to blend in with caves with crystals in them.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nA typical Crystal Fury's fins, armour plates, and ear-like growths appear to be made of the same mineral as their eggs, as well as their claws. These are a special type of armour that will eventually grow across the entire Fury if given enough time. Most Crystal Furies have labradorescent, iridescent, or opalescent armour. A dwindling minority has quartzescent armour, as the example above.\n\nTheir bodies are usually black or a very dull colour, and are typically iridescent, shifting multiple colours in the light. Juveniles removed from the caves will never grow their armour, and when they are adults, they look little different from a normal Night Fury aside from their slimmer build, spikier growths, and iridescent or sparkling skin, which they are commonly hunted for as clothing or decor.\n\nSimilar to that of the Light Fury, many Crystal Furies are known to heat their armour to a reflective state with plasma blasts, helping to camouflage better within cave systems. However, usually many of these Crystal Furies are labradorescent, or iridescent types - the quartzescent and opalescent types, as having different scales, cannot heat them to a point of reflection. However, the quartzescent types are known to have facets upon their plates, which can give an automatic reflective sheen, and the opalescent types refract differently coloured rays of light.\n\nGenetic Structure[]\n\nIt is related to Night Furies and Light Furies, diverging from a mutual common ancestor about 300,000 years ago and adapting to their high mineral environment. This MCA is theorized to look generally like the common Night Fury of today, however it is theorized to have had subtle patterning not unlike that of a melanistic leopard or jaguar, about 30% bigger size with bulkier armour plates, and sabre teeth. It may have even had fur or feathers. The wingspan may have been up to 50% the size of what they are today. The Crystal Fury has retained a smaller size, but many Crystal Furies are known to grow irretractable sabre teeth, likely a vestigial trait. They can interbreed with Night Furies and Light Furies.\n\nIt has been suggested that the various types may be different ethnicities of Crystal Furies rather than one overarching superfamily, as between varieties there are subtle details that can affect studies and subsequently the information gathered within. It is shown that differing settlements, though similar, can have higher concentrations of certain varieties depending upon the breeding pairs and their gene pools. Genetic testing shows that the different types of scales are passed through families and many are partial to certain features as, faceting, shimmering, etc, by an inherited trait limited to that of their type, with iridescent types with shimmering being the most common over all and quartzescent with faceting being relatively rare. There are atypical and half-sequenced genetic traces that may originate from a now extinct previous Fury race which are reconstructed as having had aventurescent armour, with these aventurescent types possibly being the Furies depicted living harmoniously with humans upon the walls in the Finnish Caverns where the Crystal Furies were first discovered.\n\nHabitat[]\n\nThe majority of their home and food source are currently unknown and perhaps multiple colonies are hidden across the world, but using sonar blasts in the Finnish Caverns where they had been discovered, studies have shown that there are underground labyrinths with pools of freshwater. Animals taken from the area have a much higher mineral count. It is very likely that the reason for the vivid colouration in the Crystal Fury's jewel plates is because of their diet. Theories speculate that the Crystal Furies themselves created these cave systems like ants, but readings and tests show that these were not created by any dragon. There have been intricate carvings that show humans and dragons together on the walls that suggest an ancient, highly advanced but lost to time civilization created them for the Furies as refuge.\n\nSociability[]\n\nUsually a very friendly creature, they live in packs, and have a highly complicated hierarchy for their species, with one absolute ruler, a 'King' or 'Queen', who usually has five 'Royal Guards', who have their own 'Squadron Leaders', who have their 'Soldiers'.\n\nEggs[]\n\nTheir eggs are about the size of a full grown human male's head, and in the first few weeks, they are jet black in colouration. Compared to other dragons, a Crystal Fury's eggs are slow to hatch, and usually take more than a month, in which the mineral-rich shells act as a starter for small crystals to start growing on the gemstone. This is not intentional, but it works to both conceal and prevent predators from cracking open the egg. More than one time a sticky-handed thief with more greed than brains has snatched one or two eggs from the nests of a Crystal Fury, intent on cutting them up to sell them as precious gemstones and jewelry, and came out little more than a pile of smoking bones.\n\nStatistics[]\n\nStrength: Can fight off a Monstrous Nightmare with ease. 8/10.\n\nAgility: Pretty fast, but not as fast as a Night Fury. 6/10.\n\nCamouflage: You won't spot them coming if you're in a cave. 9/10.\n\nClimbing: If you're a tree dweller, you might want to move. 6/10.\n\nFiring: Their plasma blasts are like that of a Night Fury's, but are hotter than a Monstrous Nightmare on fire. 10/10.\n\nEcholocation: Can spot anything with sound, if it's not too far away or flying. 6/10.\n\nWeaknesses: Flashlights, anything that can emit light in a cave, Dragon Root, Dragon Nip, scratches on the chin, shiny things.\n\nNotes[]\n\nSometimes a Fury's crystals can grow on their tails, and they can shoot these at will, but have their own limit. It is debated if it should go into Sharp class rather than Mystery class.\n\nLike most Fury subspecies, they are incredibly curious creatures, and such curiosity can get the better of them.\n\nDepending on the minerals consumed, a Fury's crystals can be most any colour.\n\nThere have been no cases of an Alpha Crystal Fury yet, likely due to no competition in the past hundreds of years.\n\nKnown Crystal Furies:\n\nShimmer, Glimmer and Speckle (near adult juvenile male triplets who were stolen by thieves, confiscated, then grew up in a dragon park alongside Dire Strait and Tempestas, friendly to humans and other dragons, very sociable akin to dogs, examples of armour plates not growing in)\n\nDune (adult male, hostile towards humans but passive amongst own kind, downed by a slayer but saved by conservationists, example of the rare quartzescent type shown above)\n\nDire Strait (adult female, sociable, hatched into manmade crystal cavern / dragon park and fed with animals from the known Crystal Fury habitat, example of labradorescent type)\n\nTempestas (adult female, shy but friendly, hatched into an arena, confiscated and then placed in a healthy dragon park, example of opalescent type)\n\nVeritas (adult male, asocial, living within his own territory, example of iridescent type)\n\nKor (juvenile male, asocial, son of Veritas, example of iridescent type)"
