        "text": "In October 2021, a group of community members came together to form the Crystal Lake Parks Initiative Foundation. The purpose of the foundation is to raise funds to support efforts above and beyond the normal means of the Park District. Fundraising efforts will support projects and initiatives for Crystal Lake Park District parks. At this time, the Foundation has an application pending with the IRS to receive tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(3) organization. The Foundation was incorporated on October 13, 2021 and, when the IRS approves a timely filed exemption application, exempt status is recognized back to the date the organization was created.\n\nThe Crystal Lake Parks Initiative Foundation is dedicated to extending the scope of Crystal Lake Park district in its efforts to enhance the development of parks, open space, trails, and recreational activities. Our mission is to create safe, environmentally friendly, and highly accessible facilities that encourage social engagement, cultivate the adventurous spirit, promote positive self-worth, and celebrate life."
