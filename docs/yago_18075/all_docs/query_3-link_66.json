        "text": "Welcome to WOW2!\n\nWOW2is a thrice-monthly sister blog toThis Week in the War on Women. This edition covers women and events fromJuly 23 through July 31.\n\nThe nextWOW2, for Early August,\n\nwill post onSaturday, August 8.\n\nThe purpose of WOW2 is to learn about and honor women of achievement, including many who’ve been ignored or marginalized in most of the history books, and to mark moments in women’s history. It also serves as a reference archive of women’s history. There are so many more phenomenal women than I ever dreamed of finding, and all too often their stories are almost unknown, even to feminists and scholars.\n\nTHIS WEEK IN THE WAR ON WOMEN\n\nwill post shortly, so be sure to go there and catch up\n\non the latest dispatches from the frontlines.\n\nMany thanks to libera nos,intrepid Assistant Editor of WOW2. Any remaining mistakes are either mine, or uncaught computer glitches in transferring the data from his emails to DK5. And much thanks to wow2lib, WOW2’s Librarian Emeritus.\n\nThese trailblazers have a lot to teach us about persistence in the face of overwhelming odds. I hope you will find reclaiming our past as much of an inspiration as I do.\n\nLate July’sTrailblazing Women and Events inOurHistory\n\nNote: All images and audios are belowthe person or event to which they refer\n\n_________________________________\n\nJuly 23, 1721 – Anna Dorothea Therbusch born in Germany, Polish Rococo painter; elected to the Stuttgart Academy of the Arts, the Bologna Academy, the Académie Royale in Paris, and the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.\n\nJuly 23, 1844 – Harriet Williams Russell Strong born, American agriculturist, inventor, and conservation activist; pioneer of innovations in water storage and flood control; music composer; a leader of the West Coast woman suffrage movement; first woman member of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.\n\nJuly 23, 1889 – Anna Akhmatova born, Ukrainian-Russian poet and author; one of the most significant Russian poets of the 20th century.\n\nJuly 23, 1892 – Icie Hoobler born, biochemist and physiologist, first woman to head a local section of American Chemical Society and to serve as its national president, Director of the Research Laboratory of the Children’s Fund of Michigan.\n\nJuly 23, 1900 – Julia Davis Adams born, American author, social worker, journalist and playwright, known for historical and biographical novels, young adult books, and dramas; used the pen name F.

Rubin got her Master’s at Cornell, and her PhD at Georgetown, in spite of having to battle sexism at almost every step. When the men at the Palomar Observatory told her, ‘It’s a real problem because we don’t have a ladies room,’ she cut a piece of paper into a skirt and stuck it on the male figure on the door to one of the men’s restrooms. She said, ‘Look, now you have a ladies room.’ Rubin did the pioneering work on galaxy rotation rates, uncovering the discrepancy between the predicted angular motion of galaxies and the observed motion, by studying galactic rotation curves, which became known as the galaxy rotation problem, work that was compelling evidence of the existence of dark matter. Rubin’s results were met with great skepticism, but over subsequent decades, they were confirmed.

Since that launch the day has grown enormously, and it received UNESCO patronage in 2016. In 2017, National Women in Engineering Day officially became international.\n\nJuly 23, 2018 —Someone in the Fox News booking department mistakenly booked Massachusetts state Senator Barbara L’Italien on Fox & Friends First, instead of former Arizona Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, to talk about Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and L’Italien didn’t correct their error until she was on the air. “Good morning, I’m actually here to speak directly to Donald Trump. I’m a mother of four, and I believe that separating kids from their parents is illegal and inhumane.” She continued, “I’m actually Barbara L’Italien. I’m a state senator representing a large immigrant community and running for Congress in Massachusetts. We have to stop abducting children and ripping them from their parents’ arms, stop putting kids in cages, and stop making 3-year-olds defend themselves in court.” She rolled right over attempts by the confused hosts to point out that Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy had been stopped, but she was then cut off. Host Rob Schmitt told the audience, “That didn’t go as planned.” L’Italien finished her message on Twitter, “I've always fought for vulnerable people, and in Congress I will use every opportunity I have to make sure powerful people like @realDonaldTrump hear their voices. Here's the full statement I would've given @FoxNews if I hadn't been cut off. Stop hurting Latino children to score political points with your base,” she said. “Please reunite these families before you cause more trauma. I refuse to believe that our only two options are open borders or traumatizing children, and shame on you for pretending that they are.” L’Italien had decided to take advantage of the Fox News’ error in contacting her office, and use the opportunity to speak her mind to Donald Trump, who was known to be a regular viewer of Fox & Friends.\n\nJuly 23, 2018 —Jess Wade, a postdoctoral researcher at Imperial College London’s Blackett Laboratory, is adding biographical entries on women in science to Wikipedia every day. “I’ve done about 270 in the past year,” Wade said. “I kind of realized we can only really change things from the inside. Wikipedia is a really great way to engage people in this mission because the more you read about these sensational women, the more you get so motivated and inspired by their personal stories.” It was only as a PhD student that she was struck by how being in a minority can shape day-to-day experiences. “Being isolated is hard – this goes for all underrepresented groups,” she says. “Then there are all those challenges during your PhD that amplify that isolation. If you don’t have anyone you can really get on with around you it’s so, so hard.”\n\nJuly 23, 2020 – Sixty years after the first women were ordained as priests in the Church of Sweden, women are now 50.1% of the church’s priests, but they are paid less than their male colleagues. According to the church newspaper Kyrkans Tidning, the gender wage gap averages 2,200 Swedish kronor (£196 per month, about $250 USD). Cristina Grenholm, the secretary for the Church of Sweden, claimed the gap was due to more men being in senior positions. The Church of Sweden maintains its historic threefold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons, and has approximately 5,000 ordained clergy in total. There are thirteen dioceses, each headed by a bishop, who is elected by priests, deacons and some laity within the diocese. In 1982, Swedish legislators scrapped a “conscience clause” allowing members of the clergy to refuse to cooperate with a female colleague. The church separated from the Swedish state in 2000, and is the largest Lutheran denomination in Europe, with over 6 million members, but regular church attendance is down. The first woman bishop wasn’t elected until 1997, and Antje Jacklén became the church’s first woman archbishop in 2013. In 2017, the church urged clergy to use gender-neutral language, saying that God was “beyond our gender determinations.”\n\nJuly 23, 2020 – The House Hispanic Caucus called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy to publicly censure Representative Ted Yoho of Florida for his verbal assault of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on the steps of the nation’s capitol on July 20, and his denial on July 21, in an “apology” to her on the House floor, that he had called her a “f*cking bitch” even though it was said in front of a member of the press. Representative Ocasio-Cortez made her own powerful speech on July 23, “I am someone’s daughter too” – pointing out that verbal abuse and disrespect of women is a daily occurrence in America, and part of a much larger problem than this single incident.\n\n_________________________________\n\nJuly 24, 1868 — Marie Goegg-Pouchoulin founds the Association Internationale des Femmes, the first women’s organization in Switzerland, advocating for women’s rights and peace; she later leads a successful campaign for women’s admission to the University of Geneva in 1872.\n\nJuly 24, 1889 – Agnes Meyer Driscoll born, American cryptanalyst, mathematician and physicist, who was fluent in French, German, Latin, Japanese and English; she enlisted in the U.S. Navy during WWI as a chief yeoman (highest rank available to women then) in the Postal Cable and Censorship Office, then was reassigned to the Code and Signal section of the Director of Naval Communications, where she became a leading cryptanalyst, and stayed on as a civilian, except for a two year stint working for the Hebern Electric Code Company on developing an early cipher machine. She returned to the Navy in 1924, where she was an early supporter of machine support for code cracking. Driscoll was a major player in breaking the Japanese Navy manual codes – the Red Book Code in 1926, and the Blue Book Code in 1930; early in 1935, she was a leading member of the team cracking the Japanese M-1 cipher machine used by the Japanese Navy for encrypting messages to their naval attachés in embassies around the world. In 1940, she was doing critical preliminary work on JN-25, the Japanese fleet’s operational code, before she was transferred to a U.S. team working on the German Enigma cipher, but their approach proved fruitless. She was reassigned in 1943 to a team already working on the Japanese Coral cipher; however, the code was broken by others shortly after her arrival. Driscoll was in the U.S. Navy contingent which joined the Armed Forces Security Agency in 1949, and then the National Security Agency in 1952. She retired in 1959.\n\nJuly 24, 1892 – Alice Ball born, African American chemist who developed the first successful treatment for Hansen's disease (leprosy).

She died at age 24, after being exposed to chlorine while teaching. At the time, fume hoods were not mandatory in laboratories. She was not fully credited for her discoveries until decades after her death.\n\nJuly 24, 1897 – Amelia Earhart born, American aviator; first woman pilot to fly solo across the American continent (1928) and across the Atlantic (1932); in 1931, became an official of the National Aeronautic Association, promoted the establishment of separate women’s records; member of the Ninety-Nines (named for the number of charter members), a women pilots organization which promoted women in aviation; her plane went missing in the Pacific en route to Howland Island during an attempt to fly around the world in 1937; there have been numerous searches and theories about what happened, but no trace of the plane, Earhart or her navigator Fred Noonan has been found.\n\nJuly 24, 1900 – Zelda Fitzgerald born, American author, poet, and socialite; she and her husband F. Scott Fitzgerald became symbols of the Jazz Age in the 1920s. Her only published novel, the semi-autobiographical Save Me the Waltz (1932), was poorly received, but F. Scott Fitzgerald had insisted she make major alternations prior to publication, as much of what she had written overlapped events he was using in his as-yet unfinished novel Tender is the Night. It has since been reevaluated somewhat more favorably. She spent much of her life from the mid-1930s until her death in and out of sanitoriums. In 1948, she was locked in a room awaiting electroshock therapy when a fire engulfed the Highland Hospital’s main building in Asheville NC, killing her and eight other women.\n\nJuly 24, 1914 – Frances Oldham Kelsey born in Canada, Canadian-American pharmacologist and physician. She was hired in 1960 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, one of only seven full-time and four part-time physicians reviewing drugs for the FDA. One of her first assignments was to review an application by Richardson Merrell for the drug thalidomide (under the tradename Kevadon) as a tranquilizer and painkiller with specific indications to prescribe the drug to pregnant women for morning sickness. Even though it had already been approved in Canada and over 20 European and African countries, she refused to authorize thalidomide for market, and requested further studies. She resisted pressure from the drug manufacturer to approve the drug, because of an unexplained nervous system side effect in an English study, and she insisted on a full testing of thalidomide. Her concerns proved justified when thalidomide began to be linked to serious birth defects in Europe. Kelsey’s insistence on full testing, backed by her FDA superiors, made headlines and helped to pass the 1962 Kefauver Harris Amendment to strengthen drug regulation, the same year she was honored with the President’s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service by President John F. Kennedy. She was appointed by the FDA as deputy for scientific and medical affairs in 1995. In 2000, Kelsey was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame. She retired from the FDA in 2005, at the age of 90, after 45 years of service. In 2010, Dr. Kelsey was presented by the FDA with the inaugural ‘Dr. Frances O.

In 2009, she was returning from a trip to the U.S. when her passport was confiscated, and she was expelled by Morocco for refusing to state her nationality as “Moroccan” which a Moroccan official called an “act of treason.” She staged a hunger strike after being forced back to her previous stop, the airport in the Canary Islands. The UN, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International all called on Morocco to allow her to return to her home, resulting in global headlines. After over four weeks, she was near death, and Moroccan authorities finally allowed her return, but she was placed under house arrest, and blocked from speaking to journalists. A month later, she returned to Spain for medical treatment, and was found to still be in poor health. Amnesty International reported that Haidar and her family were under constant surveillance by Moroccan security forces and were being harassed and intimidated. She has continued her non-violent struggle for the rights of the Sharawi people in spite of death threats and even physical attacks on herself and members of her family, Recipient of the 2008 Robert F.

In 2011, she won the Directors Guild of America award for Outstanding Directing in a Dramatic Series for the pilot episode of the television crime drama The Killing. Variety reported in late 2017 that Patty Jenkins closed a deal to direct Wonder Woman 1984, and her paycheck is rumored to be in the $8 million dollar range, which would make her the highest-paid woman director in history. That is still less than half what A-list male directors make. She would also receive a substantial portion of box office grosses as part of her contract. The sequel's 2020 release date has been postponed due to Covid-19.\n\nJuly 24, 1973 – Amanda Stretton born, English racing driver, and broadcast journalist; the first woman driver to compete in the ASCAR Mintex Cup, which she finished in 6th place, and was on the first women’s team in the British GT championships, as well as the first woman to race in the FIA Championships.

When her father died in 1293, her brother was the heir, but when he too died in 1309, he designated Hawys as his heir, but she was still 17, so her four uncles became her guardians. They disputed her claim on the grounds that women could not inherit under Welsh law, and sought take the land for themselves, and force Hawys into a nunnery. She went to the Parliament of Shrewsbury to petition King Edward II of England in person, as an English subject loyal to the Crown. He asked her to nominate a champion of her rights, and she named John Charleton, who was one of Edward’s knights. Charleton led a company of English knights escorting her back to Powis Castle.

Eastman then joined with Alice Paul, Lucy Burns and others in founding the militant Congressional Union, which became the National Women’s Party.

She livestreamed the standoff after learning that the man would be dispatched on arrival in Istanbul to another plane bound for war-torn Afghanistan. The footage went viral and got over half a million hits. Struggling to maintain her composure, Ersson said, “I don’t want a man’s life to be taken away just because you don’t want to miss your flight. I am not going to sit down until the person is off the plane.” When asked by a steward to stop filming, she said emphatically, “I am doing what I can to save a person’s life. As long as a person is standing up the pilot cannot take off. All I want to do is stop the deportation and then I will comply with the rules here.

It is not right to send people to hell.” Some passengers applauded when the asylum seeker was taken off the plane. Ersson was also escorted off.

Between 1941 and 1942, her section was systematically destroyed by the Nazis, and numerous other underground activists were arrested.

Her husband arranged for a guard to be bribed to put her in a group of non-political prisoners being transported to the Majdanek concentration camp. A group of fighters dressed in Gestapo uniforms presented a falsified document claiming her for further interrogation in Warsaw. She moved from Lublin to Klarysek-Janówek, then returned to Warsaw to work with the Soviet intelligence network in Poland, while her husband was sent to London in 1943 as a representative of the National Armed Forces.

FGM survivor and activist Ifrah Ahmed, 26, said the declaration “had taken everyone by surprise.” Ahmed added, “It shows just how quickly things can move when there is political will.” Most girls in Somalia undergo the most severe form of circumcision between the ages of five and nine, during which external genitalia are removed or repositioned and the vaginal opening is sewn up, leaving only a small hole through which to pass menstrual blood.

She also called for reducing the authorities' reaction time in similar cases. On July 25th, Police took 19 hours to respond after the victim's first call saying she had been beaten and raped by a man who picked her up in his car as she was hitchhiking. They waited for a search warrant, even though it wasn’t legally required in a life-threatening emergency. She made three separate phone calls for help to the country's emergency hotline.

Hals settled by paying the fine, and keeping the student. Though her work was highly regarded during her lifetime, it was largely forgotten until 1893, when the Louvre purchased a much-admired painting, The Jolly Companions, purported for over a century to be a ‘Frans Hals’ which turned out to a Judith Leyster painting when the Louvre discovered Leyster’s distinctive monogram under the faked Hals signature.\n\nJuly 28, 1819 – Louise A.

It was during this time that she became involved with the woman’s suffrage movement after meeting the Pankhursts. She went to work for the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU – 1910-1912), and participated in organizing parades and demonstrations. She made numerous court appearances, charged with “disorderly conduct.” During one of her arrests in 1912, she met Alice Paul, also under arrest, at a London Police Station, and they decided to return to the U.S. and apply the tactics they had learned in England to the suffrage cause in America. Their partnership over the next eight years would make woman’s suffrage a national issue in the U.S., and pushed forward passage and ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920.

Only two of the 34 cases involving sexual harassment were brought by victims suing alleged harassers, and both of those cases were dismissed for lack of evidence. In fact, the majority of the 34 cases were brought by alleged harassers themselves, claiming breach of contract after they were dismissed by employers for sexual harassment, or for defamation-related reasons after accusations were made public by victims or employers. It’s not that sexual harassment isn’t a problem in China, as nearly 40% of women in China say they have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. The absence of court cases indicates instead the difficulties women face seeking legal redress for abuse. But the #MeToo movement is having some effect. In 2018, several university professors were accused on Chinese social media of sexually harassing female students, and a woman accused prominent anti-discrimination activist Lei Chuang of sexual assault. A slew of prominent journalists, intellectuals, and activists have since been accused on social media of sexual misconduct. Some of the accused made public apologies. One journalist, Shangguan Luan, wrote “given the lack of systemic redress,” China’s #MeToo movement is more about “easing depression” than “seeking accountability.” In a telling case, a woman said on July 25 after she reported to the police that prominent TV host Zhu Jun had sexually harassed her, police forced her to withdraw the complaint, claiming that Zhu, as host of the annual Spring Festive gala at the state media, had “enormous ‘positive influence’ on the society.” Soon after the exposé, posts about the case began to be removed from Chinese social media. Chinese law banning sexual harassment of women in the workplace doesn’t clearly define what is meant by sexual harassment, or make provisions creating a specific cause of action against harassment.\n\n_________________________________\n\nJuly 29, 1742 – Isabella Graham born in Scotland, American philanthropist and educator, leader in founding the Society for the Relief of Poor Widows, the Orphan Asylum Society, and the Society for Promoting Industry among the Poor.\n\nJuly 29, 1846 – Sophie Menter born, German pianist and composer; one of Franz Liszt’s favorite students, she was a piano virtuoso noted for her electrifying playing style.\n\nJuly 29, 1862 – Belle Boyd, Confederate spy, the ‘Siren of the Shenandoah,’ arrested after the Union officer that she had been vamping for information reported her.

Though initially pilloried for her testimony, public opinion began to shift in her favor as time passed. Congress passed a bill later in 1991 that gave harassment victims the right to seek federal damage awards, back pay, and reinstatement, signed into law by President George H W Bush. By 1992, harassment complaints to the EEOC were up by 50%. Private companies started training programs to deter sexual harassment. The manner in which the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee challenged and dismissed Hill's accusations of sexual harassment angered female politicians, lawyers and feminists. According to D.C. Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, Hill's treatment by the panel was a contributing factor to the large number of women elected to Congress in 1992. \"Women clearly went to the polls with the notion in mind that you had to have more women in Congress,\" she said. In their anthology, All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave, editors Gloria T.
