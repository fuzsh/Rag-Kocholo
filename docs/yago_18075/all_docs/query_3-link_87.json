        "text": "East Doc Platform 2018: Meeting Point with Interesting Guests\n\nMarch 3 – 9, accomplished professionals involved in documentary filmmaking and distribution will meet in Prague. In addition to traditional representatives of Europe’s key TV networks, sales agents and festivals, EDP will for the first time host representatives of international funds now open to films from Central and Eastern Europe, as well as consultants who connect film with international business. They will introduce new start-ups designed to support documentary filmmakers.\n\nDocumentary filmmaking has been going through dramatic changes in terms of funding and distribution. The traditional model of international collaboration with TV networks has become dysfunctional due to cuts in co-production funding, hence documentary professionals need to look elsewhere to find partners. Starting this year, the East Doc Platform is exploring uncharted waters with a line-up of attractive guests – international fund representatives as well as investors who connect film and private equity. For the first time in Prague, we have the pleasure of hosting, among others, Lucila Moctezuma of Chicken & Egg Pictures, a US fund that supports women nonfiction filmmakers; Lynn Nwokorie of Doc Society (formerly Britdoc) or Amy Hobby and Mridu Chandra of the Tribeca Film Institute that in partnership with the EDP hosts the inaugural IF/Then pitch for short documentary films. The event takes place on Wednesday, March 7 at 10 a.m., Cervantes Institute.\n\nOther guests include Jane Ray and Phoebe Hall of the Whicker’s World Foundation that supports young talent in authored documentary. On Wednesday, March 6, they will attend the panel “Catching a Second Wind” and, along with other fund representatives, explore new funding options from private sources. The panel will also be attended by Martijn te Pas of the IDFA Bertha Fund Europe and Juliane Schulze of peacefulfish, a consulting firm that has since 2000 been actively connecting film, media and gaming industry with business across Europe.\n\nThis year, the East Doc Platform will welcome two representatives of new start-ups. Jhava Chikli and Guillaume Renaud will present Archive Valley, a unique online platform for sharing archive footage sources worldwide. The current problem of festival decision makers who are often overloaded with work, could be alleviated using an online project pitch platform – Pitch the Doc that will be introduced by the founders Adam Papliński and Katarzyna Szarecka.\n\nThe East Doc Platform will for the first time welcome Sascha Bleuler of Semaine de la Critique Locarno, Julian Carrington of Hot Docs, Francesco Giai Via of the Venice Biennale, and Madeline Robert, a new programmer of Visions du Reél Nyon, who will be added to our very long list of other representatives of prestigious events.\n\nNew trends in interactive storytelling will be outlined by Liz Rosenthal, a curator of the world’s first festival VR competition that takes place as part of the Venice Biennale. Her presentation “How to Bring VR Projects to Life” takes place on Monday, March 5, 6 p.m., Cervantes Institute.\n\nPublic presentations and talks are FREE.\n\nAttachmentSizeEast_Doc_Platform.png531.83 KB\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nEast Doc Platform to Focus on “New Resistance”\n\nThe largest industry event dedicated to documentary filmmaking in Central and Eastern Europe reflects on the rise of populist regimes in the region and examines the options available for fighting efforts to suppress critical voices.\n\n“In the course of the year, we see dozens of Polish and Hungarian producers who, under various pretexts, suddenly lose funding for their projects. Yet in fact, it’s in reaction to their public expression of anti-regime opinions,” says Tereza Šimíková, East Doc Platform Manager. “Public media and free speech have come under attack, documentary filmmakers and journalists have been facing threats of censorship even in the Czech Republic. A bit of silver lining is that countries in the former Eastern bloc share a common history with regard to these issues. It is time to reopen the subject and find some lessons for the present.”\n\nThe theme “NEW RESISTANCE” implies the unwillingness of documentary filmmakers to suck up to populist voices in society. Their resistance is manifested as dogged persistence with which they pursue these issues while maintaining critical thinking. They are resistant to the dangers they report on and immune to suggestions their work might be undesirable.\n\nThe mission of the Institute of Documentary Film is to work on behalf of Central and East European documentary filmmakers, to be an “advocacy organization”. For 10 years, the East Doc Platform has been a meeting place for documentary filmmakers from post-communist countries; it is by no means just a closed industry event that highlights some of the best projects with international potential for TV, festival, fund and sales representatives from around the world. It is a true platform that annually hosts some 400 documentary professionals to discuss and tackle issues that trouble the entire community and that require a joint response.\n\nThis year’s EDP addresses the general public and invites people to participate in this important discussion. The panel “NEW RESISTANCE; Media, Film and Politics” takes place on Tuesday, March 6 at 4 p.m., Kino 35, French Institute in Prague with following invited guests: Max Tuula (The Trial: The State of Russia vs Oleg Sentsov), Filip Remunda (Czech Journal), Konrad Szołajski (The Battle with Satan) or Outriders, a platform for independent Polish journalism. The discussion will be hosted by Czech journalist Veronika Sedláčková and it will be translated into Czech.\n\nThe East Doc Platform (March 3 – 9, 2018) is organized by the Institute of Documentary Film in partnership with the One World International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival.\n\nMore details on the programme here.\n\nDownload our poster here!\n\nAttachmentSizeEDP2018_vizual.jpg40.6 KB\n\n↧\n\nCritical Documentary Filmmaking is Becoming a Risky Business\n\nThe EAST DOC PLATFORM, the largest event for documentary professionals in Central and Eastern Europe, takes place March 3-9, 2018. During the week-long event, Prague will host leading documentary professionals, distributors, TV and festival selectors from around the world. Filmmakers will pitch their documentary projects and compete for several prizes in the total amount of EUR 35,000. General audiences can attend a number of interesting talks by international professionals. Most events take place at the Cervantes Institute, entrance to talks is free.\n\nThe theme of the 7th EDP “New Resistance” addresses the rise of nationalism in the region of Central and Eastern Europe. “We hear more and more political voices today calling for the restriction of critical free press. Public media and free speech have come under attack, documentary filmmakers and journalists have been facing threats of censorship even in the Czech Republic. Countries in the former Eastern bloc share a common history with regard to these issues. It is time to reopen the subject and find some lessons for the present,” explains Tereza Šimíková, EDP Manager. What impact do these tendencies have on the life of documentary filmmakers? Is their stubborn unwillingness to turn a blind eye to current issues more important today than ever before? Get answers to these and other questions at a panel discussion with the invited guests: Max Tuula (The Trial: The State of Russia vs Oleg Sentsov), Filip Remunda (Czech Journal), Konrad Szołajski (The Battle with Satan) or Outriders, a platform for independent Polish journalism. The discussion will be hosted by Czech journalist Veronika Sedláčková and it will be translated into Czech. It takes place on Tuesday, March 6 at 4 p.m., Kino 35, French Institute in Prague.\n\nThis year’s EDP has a slate of inspiring talks for visitors. On Wednesday, March 7 at 5 p.m., we are proud to introduce Kim Longinotto, one of the most popular documentary filmmakers whose previous films include the Cannes IFF winner Sisters in Law and Rough Aunties, awarded at Sundance. Liz Rosenthal, a curator of the world’s first festival VR competition that takes place as part of the Venice Biennale, will deliver a talk entitled “How to Bring VR Projects to Life”. It takes place on Monday, March 5 at 6 p.m., Cervantes Institute.\n\nAnother attractive panel discussion will be dedicated to new funding opportunities. The traditional model of international collaboration with TV networks is in troubles due to cuts in co-production funding, and so the East Doc Platform has decided to invite an entirely new type of partners – international fund representatives and investors connecting film and private equity. For the first time in Prague, we have the pleasure of hosting representatives of Chicken & Egg Pictures, a US fund that supports women nonfiction filmmakers, Whicker’s World Foundation and the Tribeca Film Institute that in partnership with the EDP organizes a brand new short film pitch competition this year. The panel discussion takes place on Wednesday, March 7, at 3 p.m.\n\nFilmmakers who will pitch their documentary projects at the East Doc Platform will compete for one of several awards designed to aid further film development. Czech audiences will surely appreciate the fact that nearly one in three selected projects has a Czech director or (co-)producer. These and other projects will be carefully assessed by international festival selectors, including Martijn te Pas, Senior programmer at IDFA, who will be looking to find the best films in the region and set them on a successful path. An international jury consisting of Serge Gordey, Esther van Messel, Rada Šešić, Lejla Dedić and Lars Säfstrom will present the best project in development and production with the East Doc Platform Award that comes with EUR 7,500. Czech TV, EDP’s general media partner, will announce the Czech TV Co-production Award that comes with EUR 5,700. The best short project will receive USD 20,000, year-long mentoring service and distribution support from the Tribeca Film Institute. In addition, all projects selected for the 2018 East Doc Platform will compete for the HBO Europe Award and EUR 2,000 for project development. Current Time TV will support a selected filmmaker with EUR 1,500.\n\nEast Doc Platform will also hold the official opening of the fourth edition of the project KineDok, focused on alternative distribution of creative documentaries. It will start fashionably with a screening of Polish film Communion (Anna Zamecka, 2017), awarded the best European Documentary Award.

Luke is an impressive filmmaker who has brought out the best in everyone who worked on this film. The F/X and action sequences are so impressive, making the film a real treat for audiences not only in North America, but around the world.”\n\nAdditional sales for OCCUPATION include: United Kingdom - Altitude Films, Middle East - Falcon Films, Japan - Gaga and South Korea - Scene and Sound, and Germany – Ascot-Elite.\n\nThe production, written and directed by LUKE SPARKE (RED BILLABONG, YESTERDAY IS HISTORY) showcases a tremendous ensemble of actors as well as extraordinary postproduction and mind-blowing visual effects. The film stars DAN EWING (Home and Away), TEMUERA MORRISON (AQUAMAN, MOANA), RHIANNON FISH (emmy-nominated The 100) and BRUCE SPENCE (STAR WARS: EPISODE III).\n\nFilm Mode continues to rack up impressive sales across the board, as evident with this and other new titles, and the reputation of the Film Mode Entertainment team. The company continues to operate as a home for the elevated genre films and has been helping to pave the way for filmmakers of all kinds in this rapidly changing marketplace, where competition is at a peak. The company further strives to present a variety of commercially viable products that remain true to their key-messaging, continuously filling the hole in the market for films that “raise the genre-bar” and that audiences are yearning to see more of, as proven by recent box-office records, media attention, award shows and major film festivals.\n\nOCCUPATION unfolds after a devastating intergalactic attack on Earth, when the last surviving group of humans must band together for the sake of survival. As war looms, and the struggle to stay alive worsens, they realize the only way to save the human race is to stay one step ahead of their attackers and strike back.\n\nReeling from the success of INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOLUME 2 and ARRIVAL: COVENANT, the resurgence of the sci-fi genre is already evident across the global marketplace. The action-heavy film stars TEMUERA MORRISON whose fan base is ever-expanding from wowing audiences as Chief Tui in the Oscar-nominated MOANA and bringing his talent to the screen in next year’s AQUAMAN, and DAN EWING in his second collaboration with director LUKE SPARKE.\n\nSPARKE asserts, \"We're extremely excited to show OCCUPATION for the first time to buyers at EFM. The film has been put together by a team of passionate individuals and companies from Australia and around the world, and it really is a huge achievement from all. We believe the film takes the 'invasion' storyline in a new and exciting direction, while still giving action film junkies a fun experience I hope they will want to watch again and again. The cast involved are all absolutely wonderful and I can't wait for the audience at EFM to be taken on the roller coaster ride that is - OCCUPATION.\"\n\nOCCUPATION is produced by SparkeFilms, the team behind the 2016 monster flick RED BILLABONG. Producers include Carly Imrie and Carmel Imrie.\n\nThe deal was negotiated by Clay Epstein, President of Film Mode Entertainment and Jonathan Saban, Senior Vice President of Distribution, Sales & Marketing for Saban Films.\n\nSaban Films will release the film in North America, and Pinnacle Films will be releasing the film theatrically in Australia and New Zealand later this year. Additional territorial release dates will be forthcoming.\n\nFilm Mode Entertainment is representing worldwide rights on OCCUPATION.\n\nFilm Mode Entertainment is a leading worldwide sales agent, production entity and distribution company, focusing on commercially driven feature films of all genres and budget sizes. Film Mode represents projects at all stages of the filmmaking process, often as Executive Producer, with the aim of helping producers and distributors achieve maximum exposure for their films.

Almost too much to bear but the story had to be told, or rather retold on film after an overlong wait. Not exactly family fare.\n\nGerman actrice Marie Bäumer has an uncanny resemblance to Romy Schneider and portrays her with verve in Three Days in Quiberon\n\n6. Three days in Biberon. Romy Schneiders last interview as an unhappy aging star of 42 in 1981. In a rehab clinic on the coast in Brittany Romy Schneider gives her last no holds barred interview in 1981 to a sleaze seeking German Journalist and an enthralled photographer. The way the journalist plies her with embarrassing personal questions is truly disgusting but in the end even he succumbs to her disarming frankness and urge to shake off her sweetie teenage image as Sissy, the Austrian queen Germans clung to even after she became a French speaking megastar opposite Alain Delon in a string of megahits.\n\nActress Marie Bäumer is nearly a dead ringer for Romy at 42 and like Romy flits easily back and forth from German to French, but\n\nthe Pic wears out its welcome as it goes on too long belaboring viewers with wearying repetitions of her shattered private life and longing to be a real mother to 14 year old son who prefers to live away from her. Bottom line, informative and revealing but ultimately depressing with a bad aftertaste.

It actually had a director, a young woman whose main point of view seems to be voyeurism laced with bad taste and pseudopsychology 101.\n\n↧\n\nScreening February 26th - Fantasporto\n\nFEBRUARY 26\n\nGrand Auditorium\n\n14:00 - OFFICIAL COMPETITIVE SECTION OF FANTASTIC SHORTS-METHODS - 167 '\n\nReruns\n\nFace, 14'23 '', Hol / Fra / Bel\n\nCharon\n\nLuís Tinoco, 15'51 '', Esp\n\nCreature from the Lake\n\nRenata Antunez, Alexis Bédué, Léa Bresciani, Amandine Canville, Maria Castro Rodriguez, Logan Cluber, Nicolas Grangeaud, Capucine Rahmoun-Swierczynski, Victor Rouxel, Orianne Siccardi, Mallaury Simoes, 5'10 '', Fra\n\nAnd orange\n\nFrédéric Gaudin, Marceau Leger, Tanguy Lemonnier, Patrick Martini, Diana Nikitina, Flora Silve, 5'52 '', Fra\n\nAzdaja - The Dragon\n\nIvan Ramadan, 13 ', Bosnia Herzegovina\n\nThe End of Time\n\nMilcho Manchevski, 5'24 \", USA / Cuba\n\nSweet water\n\nDrew Casson, 20 ', UK\n\nIn the Dark, Dark Woods\n\nJason Bognacki, 4'30 '', USA\n\nMerry-Go-Round\n\nIhor Podolchak, 4'59 '', Ukraine / Pol\n\nBelle a Croquer\n\nAxel Courtière, 14'57 '', Fra\n\nBEC\n\nTony Morales, 12'17 '', Esp\n\nZarr-Dos\n\nBart Wasen, 6'34 '' Switzerland\n\nStorylines\n\nJuan Manuel Betancourt Calero, 17'50 '', Col.\n\nSalvatore\n\nMaarten Groen, 11'38 '', Hol\n\nA.L.\n\nCashell Horgan, 10'57 '', Ireland\n\n17:30 - Involution\n\nPavel Khvaleev - 87 '- Russ / Alem - Fantastic - Fantasy, Sci-fi - CF - v.o.leg english / leg port - WORLD ANTESTREIA\n\nThe earth has gone uncontrolled, affected by a cruel and inhumane mechanism that causes a regression of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution ...

Deleon\n\nby Alex C. Deleon\n\n1. Badly. \"Don't worry he won't get far on foot\" -- cause he's in a wheelchait ..gettit? -- Ordeal to sit through. Not even painful, just a draggg ...Joaquin Phoenix sits it out patiently in the latest Van Sant look at the miserable side of life.\n\n2. Eva. Not even Isabelle Huppert could save this limp melodrama. Ridiculous decadent French story about an ultra attractive middle aged hooker and one of her hapless half-her-age victims. Idiotic but Isabelle Huppert makes almost anything, even a complicated miscarriage like this, worth watching.\n\n3. Twarz (YMUG): Not so badly. Polish face transplant drama set in a Jesus freaking provincial town out in the Polish styxx. If you wish you had a better face, better give this painful ordeal a pass. (some say it was a comedy!) -- takes patience.\n\n4. Utaya 22: One harrowing view of the Norwegian island massacre of July 22, 2012, carried out by a right wing racist fanatic. Brutal reminder of that terrible day hanging by your thumbs with survivors from rocky caves on the edge if the island in a dingle long take. Meaningful and sincere but a real ordeal to sit through, or hang out with.\n\n5. Museo: Sucks Badly. Very shaggy dog long drawn out tale of a Mexican holiday museum heist with priceless loot too hot to handle on the black museum market. This one got a best scenario award. It must have gained a lot in German translation. One long yawn. Pointless Ordeal. La tuya en patines!\n\n6. in den Gangen (In the aisles). An almost love story that gets lost in supermarket back stage storage rooms. Not exactly an ordeal but pretty boring unless you're into the intimate details of learning how to forklift.\n\nFetching actress Sandra Huller will charm your sox off but she isn't in it long enough. I left before the end because breakfast hunger overcame my curiosity as to the final outcome.\n\n7. ElDorado. Italy is the promised land many Africans risk (and often lose) their lives to get across the Mediterranean from Libya only to find reception there not too warm. Obviously well meaning to arouse sympathy for these hapless refugees but -- an ordeal to sit through. I left when I'd had enough. About halfway through.\n\n8. Songwriter: Not even an ordeal. I bugged out after fifteen minutes when I realized this kind of Rockstar backstage creativity was not my cup of music or tea or anything else.\n\n9. Khook (Persian for \"Pig\") -- Unfunny screamer of a supposedly black comedy set in Teheran. An unknown serial killer is knocking off all the worst film directors in Iran. Will our shaggy screaming hero, himself a bad director, be next, or will his gun toting elderly mother get there in the nick of time? The only saving grace of this pointless Persian ordeal are the frequent glimpses of the hauntingly beautiful face of Iranian actress Leila Hatami.\n\n10. Dovlatov. Leningrad, 1971, where Sergei Dovlatov, a highly talented writer, can't get published because he refuses to toe the party line -- and also because he is Jewish. Another major figure is Jewish poet Joseph Brodsky who eventually emigrated to New York and won a Nobel prize. Handsome Serbian born actor Milan Maric looks like the next big Russian star but the film, which consists largely of poets reciting their banned poems to each other in flowery Russian loses just about everything in translation. Another well meaning Ordeal.\n\nNot quite an ordeal but still heavy going.\n\nThree days in Quiberon. The Brittany coastal resort where aging star Romy Schneider is drying out awash in champagne in 1981. At 42 she is still beautiful but her private life is a shambles as she painfully reveals to a mercilessly probing German reporter for major German weekly Stern.\n\nGerman actress Marie Bäumer, almost a Schneider clone physically, carries the drama with verve and aplomb beyond the point of historical comfort. Schneider died the next year at the peak of her popularity and personal pain. A painful worthwhile picture and unusual star portrait.\n\nFinally, The Berlin Golden Bear winner \" Touch me Not\", a pretentiously disgusting plunge into the psychology of warped people who cannot bear to be touched and have various other sexual problems. Main focus is on a middle aged woman who tries out various forms of therapy such as hiring a male prostitute to masturbate before her and an extremely phony \"therapist\" who is so revolting he makes her scream merely by touching her. One cannot help but getting the impression that this creep is merely using the therapy ploy as a means of trying to get laid. Populated from stem to stern with revolting people, one a buck toothed basket case (sorry about that but I was revolted!) and generally filmed in a shoddy manner reminiscent of a bad home movie. Needless to say this basket case of a film (directed by a Romanian woman artist) resulted in a walkout before the end, on the verge of regurgitation. As I walked out I noticed that most viewers seemed to be nailed to their seats like Christ on the Cross -- by this crucifying excuse for a film. That it won the Golden bear for Best Film did not surprise me as I suspected that this year's Berlin jury was ready to throw a whammy at the fans to remind them that there is no disputing Bad Taste. If theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli had seen this he would undoubtedly have characterized it as \"Not even bad!\"\n\nAlex, Hotel Alpert\n\nBerlin\n\n↧\n\nScreening February 27th - Fantasporto\n\nGrand Auditorium\n\n3:00 PM - The Charmer\n\nMilad Alami - 102 '- Denmark - Drama - SR - v.o.leg english / leg port ANTESTREIA\n\nThe drama of immigrant integration in Europe has several faces.
