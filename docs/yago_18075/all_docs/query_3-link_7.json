        "text": "46th Drama International Short Film Festival Awards\n\nNATIONAL COMPETITION PROGRAMME AWARDS 2023\n\nJURY\n\nLefteris Charitos (President), director, Alexia Roider, artistic director of the Cyprus Short Film Festival, Menos Deliotzakis, director, Alexandra Matthaiou, director/screenwriter, and Asimina Proedrou, director/screenwriter.\n\nGOLDEN DIONYSUS – BEST FILM AWARD\n\nto the film ‘Bearcave’, directed by Krysianna Papadakis and Stergios Dinopoulos\n\nAn independent film that stole our hearts by managing to touch upon important issues while remaining penetrating, authentic, and brave. Breaking away from the stereotypical documentations of rural Greece in a way we rarely see in Greek cinema, the film’s creators placed a big bet and won. A film full of daring stylistic contradictions, natural performances, and character complexity, whose two heroines keep us on our toes, despite the film’s long duration. Up until the credits roll, emotion is prevalent, through the reminder that cinema has always needed and will always need real and deeply human stories.\n\nThe award is accompanied by the following prizes: Finos Film offers a prize of 4,000 euro, the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) offers a prize of 3,000 euro, and the Greek Film Centre offers a prize of 2,500 euro.\n\nSILVER DIONYSUS – “TONIA MARKETAKI” BEST DIRECTION AWARD\n\nto Alexis Koukias-Pantelis, for the film ‘Aerolin’\n\nFor his exceptional guidance of the main actress, the tight rhythm and all other elements which effortlessly compose this film, we singled out a film which conveyed successfully and humorously the heroine’s struggle to survive in a modern urban environment, presenting on the big screen a character who ultimately represents a whole generation.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a prize of 3,500 euro offered by the Greek Film Centre, as well as by Post Production services worth 2,500 euro offered by Stefilm, original music composition for the creator’s next project offered by the company Musou, a Crew United Pass, and a 5-year free Premium Member subscription on Crew United’s platform.\n\nDOCUMENTARY AWARD\n\nto the film ‘Light of Light’, directed by Neritan Zinxhiria\n\nBy composing a deeply sacramental world through the use of archive material and daring cinematic choices, the director converses with the past, the present and the future, and expands time. We selected a deeply poetic and existential film for this award.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 3,500-euro prize offered by the Greek Film Centre and a 1,000-euro prize offered by the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT).\n\nBEST SCRIPT AWARD\n\nto Michalis Mathoudiakis and Alexis Koukias-Pantelis for the film ‘Aerolin’, directed by Alexis Koukias-Pantelis\n\nA script which handles the short film form masterfully and economically, while remaining consistent to the tone and dramatic development of its heroine.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a prize of 3,500 euro, offered by the Greek Film Centre.\n\nDRAMA QUEER AWARD\n\nto the film ‘Buffer Zone’, directed by Savvas Stavrou\n\nThe film reminded us that, beyond any man-made or other border, love will always prevail as the ultimate affirmation of life and hope.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a cash prize of 2,000 euro, offered by Onassis Culture.\n\nSPECIAL JURY AWARD\n\nto the film ‘The first setting sun of summer’, directed by Asteris Tziolas\n\nBEST MALE PERFORMANCE AWARD\n\nto Andreas Markou, for his performance in the film ‘Buffer Zone’, directed by Savvas Stavrou\n\nWe decided to present this award to a young actor who managed to convey the hero’s struggle in a sensitive, natural, and innocent way, in stark contrast to the toxic masculinity environment which surrounds him.\n\nBEST FEMALE PERFORMANCE AWARD\n\nto Chara Kyriazi, for her performance in the film ‘Bearcave’, directed by Stergios Dinopoulos\n\nTo the actress that moved us with a refreshingly authentic and realistic performance. Through a personal and austere performance, the actress makes us privy to the emotional state of a heroine who, even when remaining silent, manages to tell us everything.\n\nBEST SOUND DESIGN AWARD\n\nto Panagiotis Papagiannopoulos and Stelios Koupetoris for the film ‘Midnight Skin’, directed by Manolis Mavris\n\nFor the atmospheric building of an idiosyncratic dystopia which follows the viewer around throughout the duration of the film.\n\nBEST SOUND AWARD\n\nto Nikos Konstantinou for the film ‘Unorthodox’, directed by Konstantinos Antonopoulos\n\nFor its integral sound engineering in a highly demanding natural environment.\n\nSound design services and 5.1 surround mixing by Costas Chrysogelos & DIAL\n\nBEST EDITING AWARD\n\nto Marios Kleftakis, for the film ‘Arizones’, directed by Giorgos Iliopoulos\n\nFor its skilled, thorough, delicate and precise editing, which, through its paced rhythm manages to immerse the viewer into the hero’s subjective world.\n\nBEST PHOTOGRAPHY AWARD\n\nto Manu Tilinski for the film ‘Midnight Skin’, directed by Manolis Mavris\n\nHigh quality photography, both aesthetically and technically intact, which showcases the director’s particular aesthetic in every frame, and takes the viewer on a journey through a world which tiptoes between the realistic, the metaphysical, the dreamlike, and the subconscious.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a Crew United Pass, and a 5-year Premium Member membership on Crew United’s platform.\n\nORIGINAL MUSIC AWARD\n\nto Petros Sotiropoulos & The Aqua Barons for the film ‘Crossing’, directed by Aineias Tsamatis and Katerina Mavrogeorgi\n\nFor its distinct identity which plays a decisive part in the film’s universe.\n\n“IOULIA STAVRIDOU” COSTUME AWARD\n\nto Rectifier + Tzo for the film ‘Good Girls Club: A Virginity Odyssey’, directed by Lida Vartzioti and Dimitris Tsakaleas\n\nFor imaginatively combining the element of kitsch with the freshness of pop aesthetic, through a variety of outfit choices.\n\nSET DESIGN AWARD\n\nto Artemis Flessa for the film ‘Crossing’, directed by Aineias Tsamatis and Katerina Mavrogeorgi\n\nFor the excellent construction of a set which defines the film’s world in full and organic connection with the natural environment.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a Crew United Pass, and a 5-year free Premium Member membership on Crew United’s platform.\n\nSPECIAL EFFECTS AWARD\n\nto Kameleon Studio (Prosthetics) Morgan Hildebrand / Aurelia Monnier, for the film ‘Midnight Skin’, directed by Manolis Mavris\n\nFor the impressively masterful design of the film’s special effects, which are incorporated naturally in the transcendental universe of the film.\n\nMAKE-UP AND HAIR STYLING AWARD\n\nto Elina Trantou, for the film ‘Good Girls Club: A Virginity Odyssey’, directed by Lida Vartzioti and Dimitris Tsakaleas\n\nFor the consistency which is used to serve the overall aesthetic of the film.\n\nJURY REASONING\n\nAnother festival reaches its end; a week full of films, with both new and seasoned filmmakers gathering in the welcoming city of Drama, and, most of all, with cinemas full to capacity for every screening.\n\nAt the same time that Yorgos Lanthimos is honoured with the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival and Drama celebrates the short film form, our country is drowning from end to end and sees people use senseless and shocking violence against their fellow man. When we consider all these happenings, we cannot be celebrating anything.\n\nHowever, Art exists to bring us face to face with darkness and to ultimately lead us towards the light. And this is what the 35 films competing in the National Competition Programme did, in the midst of all this devastation.\n\nThe Jury of the National Competition Programme of the 46th Drama International Short Film Festival considers it its obligation to highlight certain positive elements, as well as certain problematic aspects.\n\nLet us start with the positives.\n\nWe were happy to note a plethora of subjects being addressed this year: Human relationships, childhood, the multiple forms of violence, the coming-of-age process, life in rural Greece, and many others. We watched noteworthy first filmmaking attempts by new artists, as well as works by seasoned creators of the Festival. This goes to show that short film can function as a standalone category and is not necessarily, as it was previously thought, a mere first step towards feature film.\n\nFurthermore, we saw many remarkable independent productions. This demonstrates the persistence of creators who will not wait for State aid in order to make their films. Despite the fact that the Greek Film Centre and the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation consistently support the creation of short films, independent production is intensified and firmly shows that there is an alternative way.\n\nFinally, we saw in improvement in both the artistic and the technical quality of production. Watching the beautiful short film of this year’s Festival, created by Artistic Director Yannis Sakaridis, we can see that quality is on a steady upward course. One can no longer discern a short film just by a still. Furthermore, the quality of costume, set, and sound design all function to masterfully serve the script.\n\nIn an effort to provide constructive criticism to new creators, we feel the need to mention a few points of concern.\n\nJudging by the level of this year’s film selection, we would like to encourage creators to experiment with more film genres and techniques. Additionally, with narrative films constituting the greater part of the selection, we suggest that creators further develop the dramaturgy, explore character depth, and incorporate authenticity and time economy, elements which will all lead to a more effective management of the short film form.\n\nWith this year’s achievement of inclusion in the list for the Oscars nominations, the Drama International Short Film Festival seems to be becoming one of the most important festivals in the world. This brings all of us participants face to face with a process of constant maturing, which cannot be overlooked. I am particularly happy that I shared the jury duty with many prominent and unique colleagues, and we all enjoyed talking passionately about film during the days of the Festival.\n\nI would like to personally thank the Festival’s Artistic Director Yannis Sakaridis, who honoured me with the position of Jury President, and to also wish that this institution will continue to grow and mature, as the years go by.\n\nLefteris Charitos, director\n\nPresident of the Jury of the National Competition Programme 2023\n\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITION PROGRAMME 2023 AWARDS\n\nJURY\n\nEva Stefani (President), director, Philip Ilson, Artistic Director of the London Film Festival, Marie-Pauline Mollaret, head of the short film selection at the Cannes Film Festival, cinema critic\n\nGRAND PRIX 2023\n\nto the film ‘AQUERONTE’, directed by Manuel Muñoz Rivas from Spain\n\nA film which presents the rare qualities of purely visual cinema: clarity, spirituality, the ability to perceive reality with eyes both open and closed, paired with masterful sound design. The film is also a reminder of the power of water, a force of the earth which can be equally vital and destructive, as we have witnessed in our country recently.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 4,000-euro prize, offered by the company Raycap.\n\nBEST DIRECTION AWARD\n\nto the film ‘THE OPEN HOUSE’, directed by Julieta Lasarte from Spain\n\nThrough archival material and family footage, the film offers a masterfully executed cinematic vision, while simultaneously maintaining a discreet approach to issues of personal memory, trauma, and loss. At the same time, the film is a discreet celebration of life.\n\nBEST SOUTHEASTERN EUROPEAN FILM AWARD\n\nto the film ‘UNORTHODOX’, directed by Konstantinos Antonopoulos from Greece\n\nA black comedic approach to history, which pokes fun on family and religion, making the viewer simultaneously laugh and question, through a clever undermining of these institutions.\n\nBEST PRODUCTION AWARD “TV5 MONDE”\n\nto the Ajabu Ajabu collective, for the film ‘APOSTLES OF CINEMA’ from Tanzania\n\nWe absolutely love this ode to the power of collective and popular cinema. The way people meet to experience strong images on the big screen and talk excitedly about everything they watched is what brings all of us here in Drama. At the same time, it is equally important to see this experience in the cities and villages of Tanzania, where the DJs breathe life into a film and the ‘bandas’ invite the communities to share into the magic of cinema.\n\nGRAND AWARD OF THE JURY\n\nto the film ‘MIDNIGHT SKIN’, directed by Manolis Mavris from Greece\n\nA film that astounds us with its masterful use of set design and photography direction. An ambitious and sophisticated film that depicts the tendency of dreams to progressively corrupt reality, exposing the desire hidden beneath the surface of habit.\n\nEFA CANDIDACY DRAMA – European Film Academy Award Nomination for Best Short Film\n\nTo the film AQUERONTE, directed by Manuel Muñoz Rivas. M astounds us with its masterful use of set design and photography direction.\n\nThe power of the image and the importance of sound are perfectly aligned in a film that confidently observes with a spiritual eye. Time and space is blurred as we see a myriad of people in this mysterious landscape framed by a misty early morning and across day and night as they silently travel to an unknown destiny.\n\nSPECIAL MENTION\n\nto Ian Capille for the film ‘THE RIVER AND THE LABYRINTH’ from Portugal and Brazil\n\nA story about friendships and relationships which were lost and found again unfolds through the recollections of two young Brazilian women living in Lisbon. The film eavesdrops on their personal conversations and spies on their private and special moments, in order to paint a moving portrait of the life of young people today.\n\nSPECIAL MENTION\n\nto the film ‘THE AGE OF INNOCENCE’ by Maximilian Bungarten from Germany\n\nWe would like to showcase a film which constantly surprised us with its unique narration and extremely personal tone.\n\nNATIONAL

DIRECTION AWARD\n\nto Nikos Kolioukos, for the film ‘The Chaos She Left Behind’\n\nFor its sturdy handling of the subject of father-daughter relationships, the exquisite direction of the actors, the

PHOTOGRAPHY AWARD\n\nto Giorgos Karavoulias, for the film ‘How to Light a Cigarette Without Burning Yourself’, directed by Konstantinos Spanoudakis\n\nFor his exemplary use of lighting, particularly

production of the photographer’s next film, courtesy of the Katsouridis family.\n\nThe award is also accompanied by a six-month contract for a paid internship at the Green Pixel company.\n\nEDITING AWARD\n\nto Antoine Flahaut, for the film ‘The Parade’, directed by Michalis Galanopoulos\n\nFor the exceptional rhythm which harmoniously combines various characters and situations, in order to

for the winner’s next film.\n\nThe company Telmaco offers its award-winning film and video editing software Avid Media Composer, provided by Avid Technology.\n\nBEST MALE PERFORMANCE AWARD\n\nto

PERFORMANCE AWARD\n\nto Marina Siotou for the film ‘The Chaos She Left Behind’, directed by Nikos Kolioukos\n\nFor its inwardness which works to transform anger into tenderness, as well as for the

company.\n\nSOUND DESIGN AWARD\n\nto Massimo Del Gaudio for the film ‘The Parade’, directed by Michalis Galanopoulos\n\nFor its complexity and masterful use of the sound band, which allows the co-existence of multiple stories and places both within and outside the frame, and which creates a rich audio world which enfolds the heroes, the places, the situations, and the viewers.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a six-month contract for a paid internship at Green Pixel.\n\nINTERNATIONAL STUDENT COMPETITION AWARDS 2023\n\nJURY\n\nFlorian Fernandez-Canto, coordinator of the Cannes Court Metrage Rendez-Vous industry, Anne Gaschutz, artistic director of the Film Festival in Dresden, Thanos Tokakis, director, actor\n\nGRAND PRIX STUDENT: Almost Famous\n\nto the film ‘Klette’ by Michael Abay from Belgium\n\nAchieving a delicate balance between youthful carefreeness and harsh reality, this coming-of-age film invades a seemingly carefree yet actually harsh life, with a penetrative gaze. For its powerful narration which makes us privy to the unbearable pressure of achieving success in the future, as well as for the exceptional portrayal by the main actress.\n\nThe film is accompanied by a 1,500-euro cash prize, offered by Metropolitan College.\n\nQueer Student Award “ Loud & Proud”\n\nto the film ‘Kokuryo: The Untold Story of bb. Undas 2019’ by Diokko Manuel Dionisio from the Philippines\n\nFor its raw approach to storytelling, lovingly portrayed characters and quick-witted humour. Friendship and loyalty are tested in this tale of two queer protagonists who venture into the night after a beauty pageant gone awry. Meandering between the farcical and hard-hitting reality, this film uses the element of the absurd to highlight the trials and discrimination transgender people face on a daily basis.\n\nSpecial Jury Award “Rising Star”\n\nto the film ‘PHALÈNE’ by Sarah–Anaïs Desbenoit from France\n\nThrough a particularly delicate aesthetic, and without being focused on the narration, this short stands out as a call for tenderness and care in a world stuck in repetition. When replicating gestures becomes a way of subjugation and leads to servitude, there is no other choice than to question if the latent calmness isn’t hiding the enslavement of the women we witness in this polished setup.\n\nDISTRIBUTION AWARD\n\nto the film ‘Sea Urchin’ by Alex Scholz from Greece\n\nThe Distribution Award is sponsored by Radiator IP Sales, and is presented to a Greek film of the programme. The award offers representation for the development of a comprehensive commercial strategy targeting buyers abroad (TV stations and platforms).\n\nSHORT AND GREEN AWARDS 2023\n\nJURY\n\nYorgos Gousis (President), director, Sofia Stavrianidou, director of the Greek Film Festival Berlin, Natasa Christia, curator, journalist, and educator in the field of artistic photography.\n\nDRAMA GREEN AWARD\n\nto the film ‘SEAGULLS SCREAM ON THE WEEKEND’, directed by Maria Stuut and Frederik Stuut from the Netherlands\n\nThe Drama Green Award is presented to a film that managed to successfully present a scientific research project with a poetic and cinematic gaze, through fictionally elevating a documentary-making convention in a soft, humorous, and emotional manner.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 4,000-euro prize, offered by CYCLOPS AMKE\n\nSPECIAL JURY AWARD\n\nto the film ‘TIME TO LIVE’, directed by Hawar Rahimi\n\nProduction: Iraqi Kurdistan, Islamic Republic of Iran\n\nThe Special Jury Award is presented to a film that, by focusing initially on a rural woman performing caregiving duties, manages to turn our gaze to the primordial and equal symbiosis of man and animal.\n\nINTERNATIONAL ANIMATION PROGRAMME 2023 AWARDS\n\nJURY\n\nJutta Wille, director of AGKurzFilm, producer, Alekos Papadatos, animator/director, Anthi Samartzidou, illustrator\n\nBEST ANIMATION FILM – ASIFA HELLAS YANNIS VASILEIADIS AWARD\n\nTo Alec Green and Finbar Watson for the film ‘TEACUPS’\n\nThe jury believes that this film combines a high artistic quality and an elevated production level with the element of compassion to the human soul, conveying, thus, its message masterfully and successfully. The directors do not try to manipulate the feelings of the audience by using the protagonist’s traumatic experience, but rather prefer to showcase his decision to act in this very personal way. The choice to employ animation to depict this non-fictional subject, as well as the use of the voice of the particular narrator, both contribute to the plausibility and perceptibility of the film. We particularly appreciate the directors, who managed to find the appropriate imagery to depict the thoughts and actions of the protagonist, which do not render exclusively the things described by the narrator.\n\nThe award includes a one-year free membership at ASIFA HELLAS, with the full privileges of a registered member (information, visibility, participation in animation extroversion missions at international forums and festivals, etc).\n\nSPECIAL JURY AWARD\n\nto the film ‘The Tornado Outside’, directed by Maria Tomazou\n\nProduction: United Kingdom\n\nA film that masterfully combines artistic quality and integrity in terms of production. The film relays its story with skill, humour, and intelligence. Many films of the animation programme have touched upon the notion of the fragility of the human soul, as we live in a chaotic, unknown, unbalanced and even evil world. The particular quality of this film hides in the compassion with which it approaches this difficult idea. On the one hand, it helps the viewer playfully connect with the problems and concerns of the protagonist, while on the other, it restores the feelings of safety, certainty, and balance through the course of the story, resulting in a relieving catharsis. We believe it to be a deeply human and emotional film.\n\nKIDDO AWARDS 2023\n\nJury\n\n*The jury of the KIDDO Programme is composed by children and teenagers between the ages of 11-18:\n\nPetros Georgiadis, Tatiana Mavridou, Anna Panagiotopoulou, Christos Sapanidis, Vasiliki Stefanidou\n\nBEST KIDDO FILM\n\nto the film ‘Crab Day’ by Ross Stringer from the United Kingdom\n\nA film that emotionally combines a simple artistic style with a straightforward yet deep meaning. The conception of the film shows us that we don’t need to follow the wrong ideas of a society in order to fit in. Instead, one must love and strive to be the best version of themselves. Love and compassion can transform us all into something good.\n\nSPECIAL MENTION\n\nto the film ‘Ativio, Pieces of Wood’ by Juliette Boucheny from France and Togo\n\nA film that renders its story with creativity, tenderness, humour, and emotion. The conception of this film shows us that we all naturally have an inner guide in our hearts, which protects us and helps us find ourselves. The support children get from people in their lives gives them the hope and encouragement to follow their dreams.\n\nDRAMA PITCHING LAB AWARDS 2023\n\nWe are delighted to be here for the tenth year in a row, and we have had the pleasure to once again welcome participants from all around the world, who felt it important to visit the festival taking place in this small city of Greece; this city which, thanks to this institution, has become so large, that it can embrace many different ideas, concerns, images, and talents from many different countries.\n\nFor our small team, comprised by myself, Georgina Kakoudaki, and John Stevens, the yearly reception of applications by new artists from all around the world is always a lesson; by receiving approximately 120 film drafts, we instantly get a taste of how the rest of the world is thinking at that moment. These are the themes we discovered this year: anxiety about survival, about people, cities, and the entire planet. We saw places we barely know, where people struggle to survive, something that we, the members of the privileged white race, cannot even imagine. We saw films that touched on subjects like trauma and memory of the past, personal and collective stories, compassion, reconciliation, and, ultimately, the highly coveted healing.\n\nThis is why we firmly believe that our workshop at the Pitching Lab is not only useful for the preparation of adequate drafts which will succeed in getting funding, but also for showcasing good ideas, so that they can be made into great films.\n\nBarbara Douka\n\nFINOS FILM AWARD\n\nto the project ‘The Station’ by Isidoros Rostadakis from Greece.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 2,000-euro prize offered by FINOS FILM.\n\nGREEK FILM CENTRE AWARD\n\nBest Pitching for Development\n\nto the film ‘My Tears, a Sea for Jakarta to Sink’, by Andrea Nirmala Widjajanto from Indonesia\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 2,000-euro prize offered by the Greek Film Centre.\n\nSTATHIS PARASKEVOPOULOS AWARD\n\nto the film ‘Heaven on Earth’ by Martin Vallejos from Chile\n\nand to the film ‘The Blind Man at the End of the World’ by Jake Muñoz Consing from the Philippines\n\nThe awards are accompanied by sessions for the further development and correction of scripts for selected drafts.\n\nWishing to honour the memory of our dear colleague and mentor Stathis Paraskevopoulos, the Drama International Short Film Festival and the Pitching Lab team have decided to rename the guidance and mentorship awards, so that they will bear his name: These are the Stathis Paraskevopoulos Awards.\n\n“HUMAN VALUES” AWARD BY THE HELLENIC PARLIAMENT\n\nto the film ‘Aqueronte’ by Manuel Muñoz Rivas from Spain\n\nAn exceptional cinematic allegory about life and death, inspired by Greek mythology.\n\nThe Hellenic Parliament presents the “Human Values” award to a film from the International Competition Programme.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 1,500-euro prize, offered by the Hellenic Parliament.\n\nDEVELOPMENT AWARD (ONASSIS FILM DEVELOPMENT GRANT)\n\nto the film ‘Super’ by Nikolas Kouloglou from Greece\n\nThe Onassis Award is presented to a film that touches upon the themes of chemistry, love, and the decay of human relationships in a modern world where everything is expendable, through a spontaneous, daring, and honest approach.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a prize of 10,000 euro for the development of the director’s first feature film.\n\nFILM SOCIETIES AWARDS 2023\n\nGreek Society of Cinematographers (G.S.C.)\n\nGSC 2023 Merit\n\nto Sotiris Tzatzakis for the film ‘The First Setting Sun of Summer’, directed by Asteris Tziolas\n\nFor its exceptional image, which remained consistently focused on the particular needs of the film’s script.\n\nJury\n\nGiorgos Valsamis, Konstantinos Koukoulios, Giorgos Frentzos\n\nREASONING\n\nThe Greek Society of Cinematographers is happy to be part of the National Competition Programme of the Drama International Short Film Festival for yet another year. We are following the development of visual narration in cinema with great interest, and particularly in festivals like the Drama International Short Film Festival, where both prominent and experienced colleagues are participating, as well as many new creators. And, once again this year, we are presenting our Best Filmmaking Award to a new creator.\n\nThe lens captures the warm light of summer, the rays and shadows of the sun, the vivid colours. It follows the film’s protagonists, the children, in their games both by the sea and inside it. Thanks to the use of the 4:3 frame, we experience nostalgia through the imagery and we travel back to a time of carefree childhood.\n\nThe award of the GSC is accompanied by a 2,000-euro prize, offered by the AN-MAP Film Lab image editing laboratory, for Colour Correction and DCP services to be used in the award-winning filmmaker’s next film.\n\nGreek Union of Film, Television and Audiovisual Technicians\n\n“Technical Integrity” Award\n\nto Mary Kolonia for the film ‘The Armchair on the Pavement”\n\nFor accomplishing a functionally structured result derived from the whole set of cinematic specialties.\n\nGreek Film Critics Association Award\n\nto the film ‘Crossing’ by Aineias Tsamatis and Katerina Mavrogeorgi\n\nFor its tender depiction of the co-existence of two incompatible characters, which is abruptly interrupted by unexpected love and the inevitability of death.\n\nThe Greek Film Critics Association is always present at the Drama International Short Film Festival, which is the most important institution for the promotion of new creators in our country. In the body of the 35 films competing in this year’s National Competition Programme, this one stood out for us.\n\nINTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF FILM CRITICS (FIPRESCI) AWARD\n\nto the film ‘The Silence of the Banana Trees’ By Eneos Carka\n\nProduction: Hungary, Portugal, Albania, Belgium\n\nFor its sensitive approach and its composition of observations (through the camera) and documentations of a real-life story.

At the same time, International Animation and Short & Green Competition Programmes continue their successful course, while last but not least is the innovative Cinematherapy Programme, which joined the schools again this year and travelled within and beyond the borders.\n\nThis year marks the launch of the new KIDDO competition programme with films for and by children and the Short Film Hub, which aspires to form ties between talented directors, screenwriters and producers with the international and domestic film industry –while there is an even stronger presence of the Greek Film Centre.\n\nThis year’s edition, with Yannis Sakaridis as artistic director and Yorgos Demertzis as president for the fourth year, will be held simultaneously in physical spaces and online. Through the platform the films will be accessible, with free admission, throughout Greece.\n\nThe 46th DISFF will take place at the Olympia Cinema and the Municipal Music School of Drama (Antonis Papadopoulos Hall), at the open-air cinema Alexandros, in the garden of the Cyclops Cultural Centre, and at the Eleftheria multi-purpose café (at the junction of Venizelos and Kountouriotou streets).\n\nIn the coming days, the festival will utilize the former Andrikakis military camp, which will be transformed into a state-of-the-art centre for audiovisual arts in Drama, while the modernisation of the infrastructure of the Municipal Music School and the Olympia Cinema is underway.\n\nThe Drama Festival collaborates with: Greek Film Centre (EKK), the National Centre of Audiovisual Media and Communication (EKOME), RAYCAP, CYCLOPS, Green Pixel, the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT), Cosmote TV, Onassis Culture and many other bodies, with the full support of the Ministry of Culture and Sports, the Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, the Hellenic Parliament, and of course the Municipality of Drama.\n\nHere you will find the daily programme of the festival:\n\n“INTERNAL – REFLECTION” – 46th DISFF OFFICIAL TRAILER\n\nThe Drama Festival honours the 46 years of the National Competition Section with a nostalgic short film that is this year’s official trailer.\n\nFour characters, 46 years old, representing their generation, reminisce, converse with themselves and other people in their lives, aspire and continue to dream, during a short personal journey, on foot, focused on a deeply internal reflection, as a film shot would be.\n\nThe film “INTERNAL – Reflection” makes a symbolic reference to all the Greek filmmakers, who in the long course of the Festival, took their first timid but crucial steps in Drama, evolved, returned or even flew even higher and further. 62 indicatively selected films from the first Festival, up to last year’s 45th Festival, which have been screened and competed, stand next to the 35 new films of this year’s National Competition, and together they become part of this story.\n\nThe Festival’s Artistic Director Yannis Sakaridis is the director and editor, while the script was written by Vasilis Terzopoulos. The four characters are voiced by, alphabetically: Phoebus Delivorias, Aris Dimokidis, Nadia Kontogeorgi, Denise Nikolakou. The music is composed by 10-year-old composer and piano soloist Stelios Kerasidis, and is kindly provided by the composer and Minos EMI, a Universal Music Company. The titles and post production were edited by I.M. Christodoulou. The Festival cordially thanks all the filmmakers who willingly provided their films. A production of the Cultural Organization –Drama’s Short Film Festival.\n\nYou can watch the film “INTERNAL – Reflection” at the following link:\n\nTHE FESTIVAL PLATFORM\n\nThose who wish to attend the 46th DISFF online, should visit the festival platform https://www.dramafilmfestival.gr/online-festival/ (they can also access it via the website https://www.dramafilmfestival.gr from the link online festival) and follow the instructions. The films will be available from 9/4.\n\nAdmission is FREE for all online festival content including the seven (7) competition sections. The award-winning films will remain available on the platform until September 11.\n\nGREEK COMPETITION\n\nThe National Competition Programme, with Yannis Sakaridis as head programmer, features 35 films directed by 26 men and 13 women. You will find the list here:\n\nhttps://www.dramafilmfestival.gr/festival/greek-competition/\n\nDozens of popular actors star in the films, which this year surprise with their theme and aesthetics. Indicatively we mention:\n\nAntonis Tsiotsiopoulos (with a record number of participations), Romanna Lobach, Efthalia Papakosta, Argyris Pandazaras, Homer Poulakis, Andreas Konstantinou, Elena Topalidou, Kostas Vassardanis, Vassilis Koutsogiannis, Sofia Kokkali, Haris Fragoulis, Penelope Tsilika, Yiannis Papadopoulos, Ivonni Maltezou, Sofia Seirli, Despina Kourti, Giannis Tsortekis, Karafil Shena, Christos Sugaris, Giannis Anastasakis, Dimitris Kapetanakos, Smaragda Smyrnaiou and Dimitra Vlagopoulou, who has just returned from Locarno after receiving the award for best acting performance in the film “Animal” by Sofia Exarchou.\n\nAlso appearing: Aris Servetalis, Nikolakis Zeginoglou, Alexandros Logothetis, Angeliki Papathemeli, Katerina Zisoudi, Thanos Tokakis, Aris Troupakis, Katerina Misichroni, Panagos Ioakeim and many others.\n\nNew directors, who are going to be discussed, are competing, as well as several festival’s familiar faces who have been distinguished in the past and have even won the Golden Dionysus -such as Neritan Zinxhiria and Manolis Mavris.\n\nThere is also a comeback to the genre of the short form by directors who have long since moved on to feature films, such as Alexandros Voulgaris (The Boy), Panagiotis Fafoutis and Giorgos Servetas.\n\nIn addition, this year, we will also see some young filmmakers who are following in the artistic footsteps of their fathers, forming however their own personal style (as Alexander Voulgaris has been doing from his first steps): from Nikolas Kouloglou and Antigoni Kapaka, to Phoebus Imellos and Nick J. Pelecanos, son of the famous writer George Pelecanos, who even co-wrote the script of his son’s English-language film.\n\nThere will also be some well-known directors who play or appear as actors: from Fotos Lambrinos (in a leading role), to Giannis Soldatos and Giorgos Fourtounis. But also actors making their debut as directors, such as Aeneas Tsamatis and Katerina Mavrogeorgis, or theatre directors, such as Martha Bouziouri.\n\nThe writer and screenwriter Kallia Papadaki also makes her debut as a director – and speaking of writers, we will see a film based on a short story by Giorgos Skabardonis, another one based on a screenplay by Konstantinos Tzamiotis, and another inspired by an article by Stathis Tsagarousianos.\n\nThe exploration of sexuality, erotic relationships between women, the “first time”, as well as separation, occupy an important part of this year’s films. Family relationships, especially the son-mother relationship, friendships that are tested, loss and coping with grief, childhood memories and childhood trauma continue to inspire short film directors once again; as do the burning social issues that plague modern Greece: racism, suicides, seas washing up the bodies of immigrants, women’s trafficking, femicide, police violence, obscurantism and bigotry, terrorism, prison. The Calvary of today’s young actors trying to survive is also present and period films, even of the Civil War era, are not absent, while comedies a la Greek remain scarce.\n\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITION\n\nThe Festival, which this year marks 29 years since its internationalisation, will screen 20 films from all over the world (from Canada to China, and from Australia to Tanzania).\n\nYou will find the full list here: https://www.dramafilmfestival.gr/festival/international-competition/\n\nThis year, the International Programme, with Yorgos Zois as head programmer, features five (5) Greek films that are worthy competitors of international festival highlights:\n\n*Light from Light, signed by Neritan Zinxhiria, is a film that premiered at the International Film Festival of Rotterdam and takes us on a journey to the mystical atmosphere of Mount Athos.\n\n*Nikolas Kouloglou’s Super is about a love with unexpected aspects, in a supermarket.\n\n*Unorthodox by Konstantinos Antonopoulos with the (anti-)hero being a heretic Forerunner, forgotten by the Byzantine authorities, who tries to survive by appealing to the kindness of strangers.\n\n*A satirical stop motion animation, Ready by Eirini Vianelli, which introduces us to the unknown world of the Greek Parliament and its employees.\n\n*And also Midnight Skin by award-winning director Manolis Mavris, with Romanna Lobach in a surprising role – a film that comes to us from the Cannes Film Festival Critics’ Week.\n\nSame Old, a Canadian realistic drama set in New York, is also coming from Cannes, while the French, disarmingly human drama Les chenilles – which won the Berlin Golden Bear – is coming from Berlinale.\n\nThe programme also includes an imaginative short documentary from Tanzania, Apostles of Cinema, which brings us into contact with the country’s unique film culture, as well as poetic documentaries from Spain, such as the International Film Festival of Rotterdam’s favourite Aqueronte, and some moving premieres such as Open House and Hold On For Dear Life.\n\nTHE OTHER FIVE COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMES:\n\nOn the Festival’s website https://www.dramafilmfestival.gr you will find all the films participating in the competitive sections of the Festival along with the texts accompanying them. Here you will get an idea:\n\nINTERNATIONAL STUDENT COMPETITION PROGRAMME\n\nhttps://www.dramafilmfestival.gr/festival/international-student-competition/\n\nFourteen (14) films will be screened, including two (2) Greek films, in which animals dominate this year: lizards, cows, fish, sea urchins, and their relationship with humans. Lots of love, but also violence. In addition, we will see films about the much-discussed diversity and human sexuality in its various manifestations. Other entries head down more timeless paths, subject wise, talking about burning political issues, while others are about human relationships and their difficulty.\n\nHead Programmer of the International Student Competition Programme: Thanasis Neofotistos\n\nNATIONAL STUDENT COMPETITION PROGRAMME\n\nhttps://www.dramafilmfestival.gr/national-student-competition/\n\nThe programme includes 25 films from eleven (11) educational institutions in Greece and abroad; public and private, of undergraduate and postgraduate education. Among them are fiction, documentary and animation films. They represent almost every technical and aesthetic approach to audiovisual storytelling, while they cover a particularly wide range of themes – stories of relationships, identity, inclusion and isolation, social criticism and self-criticism, trauma management, personal and social responsibility.\n\nThe film Justis by Aggelos Barai and Nikitas Sifonios, an interview with the father of Nikos Sambanis, who was shot dead after a police chase, will be screened out of competition, bringing to the fore the tragic consequences of prejudice and racism towards a vulnerable social group.\n\nHead Programmer: Panagiotis Iosifelis\n\nSHORT AND GREEN\n\nhttps://www.dramafilmfestival.gr/short–and–green/\n\nFifteen (15) films, which stood out from the total number of submissions to the Festival, constitute -each with its own form, visual perspective and approach to the thematic axis (environment) that intersects the specific programme- a chain of stimuli and concerns, attempting, not to wag a finger at the viewer, but to take the viewer on a less ordinary cinematic journey, and implant a small seed of redefining his or her relationship with the natural environment.\n\nThe Greek entry, Eirini Tzoulia’s Lumen, takes us to Mati, on 23 July 2018 – the site of the second deadliest fire in the history of the 21st century…\n\nHead Programmer: Vasilis Terzopoulos\n\nKIDDO\n\nhttps://www.dramafilmfestival.gr/festival/kiddo/\n\nKiddo, the new section of the festival, features fourteen (14) films – including two (2) Greek films made by young people and children. Films that address issues such as racism, diversity, life motivation in young people, animal rights and the environment. An ambitious programme that we hope and believe will flourish and develop into an important programme for the children competing and for the children of the city of Drama who will attend.\n\nHead Programmer: Elena Mavridou\n\nINTERNATIONAL ANIMATION COMPETITION PROGRAMME\n\nhttps://www.dramafilmfestival.gr/animation/\n\nSeventeen (17) animation films will be screened, including four (4) Greek ones, created with a variety of techniques and aesthetic trends, in genres ranging from fiction to experimental animation and documentary.

The platform, which is now available in Greek, will be giving out three awards and will be presented at the Short Film Hub on Friday, 8 September.\n\nSee the detailed programme of the SFH here:\n\nhttps://www.dramafilmfestival.gr/short-film-hub/\n\nCINEMATHERAPY\n\nThe Cinematherapy programme, inspired by the integrative psychotherapist Denis Nikolakou, continues, reinforced, at the 46th DISFF. Thematic axis of the Cinematherapy 2023 programme: “Human Relationships” (https://www.dramafilmfestival.gr/cinema-therapy/)\n\nAs Denis Nikolakou notes, “The Cinematherapy 2023 programme is centred upon the theme of Human Relations, their fluidity and rearrangement in the 21st century, as well as the various forms that assemble their structure. More specifically, the discussions of this year’s Cinematherapy edition will revolve around the very structure of human relations during these past years, both on a personal and family level. To what extent have our relations been affected by the economic crisis, the pandemic, and socio-political developments? In what ways are their form and our values being shaped in our days?”\n\nIn this context,\n\n*on Friday 8/9 (20:00) at open air cinema Alexandros the film “Womb” by Themos Skandamis will be screened. A middle-aged man (Antonis Tsiotsiopoulos), on a break from a typical day, is talking to his mother on the phone when a stranger (Aris Troupakis) appears and announces some unexpected and terrible news that will change him and his sense of reality comically and tragically.\n\n*On Saturday 9/9 (20:00) at the open-air cinema Alexandros the film “The Crossing” (Aeneas Tsamatis – Katerina Mavrogeorgis) will be presented. A railway crossing in the middle of nowhere. Two guards: solitary Yiannis who never leaves his post and cool Antonis who goes with the rhythm of the landscape. Every once in a while, a voice announces the passing of a train. The two guards manually lower the bars. Nothing seems to stir their daily routine until love charges in, crushing all certainties.\n\n*On Thursday 7/9 (20:30) at the Cyclops Cultural Centre, the opening of the “Cinematherapy for young people 18 to 30 years old” programme will take place along with the first meeting with Denis Nikolakou and the participants. The implementation of the programme is carried out under the auspices and funding of the Ministry of Culture. There is no financial burden for the participants. This new activity, addressed for the first time to this age group, aims to create 5 mixed groups, which will meet on a weekly basis.
