Information Systems Barry Mechanic Director, Corporale Research Kenneth Meltsner LETTERS Privates' Lives AT THE RISK OF BEING TAGGED AS \"EITHER deluded or disingenuous\" by |ohn Taylor, I think it is essential to clarify the distinc- tion between the remedies for illegal dis- crimination and the implementation of af- firmative-action quotas when it comes to allowing homosexuals into the armed services [\"The National Interest: Sex Isn't the Issue,\" November 30]. Taylor asserts perniciously that \"one leads to the other\" and cites as evidence of this the inevitabil- ity that gays denied promotions will seek relief in court. But the pursuit of redress in court — and getting it — is not, as Taylor seems to imply, affirmative action. Many states, including California, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, have some sort of em- ployment- or housing-based anti-discrimi- nation law regarding sexual orientation, but 1 defy Taylor to locate in any of these states a mandated quota program or re- cruitment apparatus for gays. Moreover, Taylor's statement that \"activists will de- mand the promotion of gay officers, the naming of a gay general, gay-sensitivity courses during boot camp\" is offensive. There are undoubtedly gay generals in the armed forces who have achieved their sta- tus on the basis of merit and would proba- bly bristle at the suggestion that anyone might advance a quota system to give as- piring gay generals extra push. If at every level gays in the military had legal protec- tion and therefore the possibility of even- tual acceptance, they would neither de- mand nor require affirmative action. Taylor thinks he has the inside track on what \"gay activists\" would \"demand.\" But activists as well as Taylor know that if discrimination ended, the composition of the military wouldn't change much — only the lying would. Drew Limsky Livingston, N.|. IN |OHN TAYLOR S COLUMN \"SEX ISN'T THE Issue,\" he writes that \"gay grievance groups will demand protections and privi- leges and freely resort to litigation when they feel frustrated.\" But doesn't every U.S. citizen have the right to do that? If a black person in the military gets beaten up because he or she is black, doesn't that person have the right to sue? Joseph Cosentino Manhattan )ohn Taylor's ignorance about the mili- tary's justice system is evident when he Letters for this department should be ad- dressed to Letters to the Editor, New York Magazine, 755 Second Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017-5998. Please include a daytime phone number. says that once gays are allowed into the military, \"it is virtually inevitable that an openly gay soldier passed over for a pro- motion will sue, claiming discrimination\" and there will be \"increased violence against gays by soldiers whose identity as straight warriors is threatened. ... In re- sponse, gay grievance groups will demand protections and privileges and freely re- sort to litigation when they feel frustrat- ed.\" The Uniform Code of Military )ustice does not have provisions allowing officers to sue the government for discrimination, harassment, or abuse. In the worst, prov- en cases, the officer is subject to court- martial and is sent to prison at Fort Leavenworth. Karen Kaye Captain, U.S. Air Force Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla. John Taylor replies: Captain Kaye is simply incorrect. According to the Penta- gon, members of the military can file dis- crimination complaints up through the chain of command, or with the equal-op- portunity offices that exist at virtually ev- ery military installation, or with the in- spector general. Furthermore, they can file lawsuits if they feel they've been un- fairly discharged and then have the courts reinstate them until the litigation is re- solved, as Petty Officer Keith Meinhold has done. Two Two Two Much I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT COMPELLED Gael Greene, in her December 7 review of Restaurant Two Two Two [\"The Insa- tiable Critic: Eminent Domani\"], to re- peat the following offensive remark her dining companion made about jews while observing a trio at another table debating the fate of Israel: \"That proves we're on the West Side. On the East Side, if you're Jewish, you discuss nursery schools or chintz.\" First, how did Greene's friend know the trio was Jewish? Comments like these do nothing but reinforce negative stereotypes of Jewish people — passionate, intellectual Jews on the West Side versus shallow, materialistic Jews on the East Side. Would Greene compare the values of African-Americans living in Harlem with those living in, let's say, Crown Heights or Bed-Stuy? You can bet your family jewels she wouldn't! R. Marlowe Manhattan Parish When It Sizzles I HAVE BEEN AN OCCASIONAL LISTENER TO Howard Stern for the past eight years and find him to be absolutely harmless [\"Bad Mouth,\" by Jeanie Kasindorf, November 23]. He is often amusing when he says those politically incorrect things that many of us would like to say but dare not (though it's true that he focuses too much on his genitals). Why doesn't the FCC raise its sights instead to the entertain- ment industry as a whole, which spews out films celebrating sex, violence, and dysfunctional families of one sort or an- other? Or what about MTV, which glories in explicit sex, or the publishing industry, which is responsible for binding pornog- raphy in the form of Madonna's recent picture book? Why pick on Howard Stern and ignore the real culprits in the issue of public morality? The Reverend Walter B. Funk The Valley Forge Presbyterian Church King of Prussia, Pa. HOW CAN SO MANY PEOPLE BE HOWARD Stern fans if he is so awful? Guests and friends of the show include Senator Al- fonse D'Amato, Mayor Ed Koch, Gover- nor James Florio, Arnold Schwarzeneg- ger, Sylvester Stallone, Sally Kirkland, Richard Simmons, and many, many more. Bridget Burke Queens Fall From Grade? |OHN TAYLOR IS TO BE COMMENDED FOR HIS most excellent and insightful column, \"The Politics of Grievance\" [\"The City Politic,\" December 7]. Persons lacking the necessary job skills too often get im- portant jobs because of the value politics places on image over substance. David Dinkins seems to be a nice man who wants to do the right thing, certainly not at the expense of Jews. The problem is that as a city administrator, he lacks the vision, organizational skills, balance, and perspective to accomplish this. Conse- quently, his judgments impact disastrous- ly on institutions, agencies, and citizens in general. Dinkins believes he can right past wrongs done to blacks and allows this to affect his judgment and administrative style. By indulging his prejudice, he fails to become bigger than the problem, again denies justice, and becomes benevolently guilty. A mayor chosen on the basis of qualifications and not as the lesser of two evils should ideally possess the manage- ment skills to maintain efficient and effec- tive operations, the ability to lead the city to his vision, and, finally, the confidence and capacity to relate to all his constitu- ents. Taylor summed it up perfectly when he said that Dinkins could not connect with Jewish rage and was therefore unable to defuse it. Marilyn Kurland Newark, N.J. IANUARY 25, 1993/NEW YORK 5 Children have become so sophisticated. Today's five-year-olds always want the next big thing— and it always has to be more and more complicated. They come along and they say, \"I gotta have.\" \"If I don't get, I will dieT They are our salespeople and their grandparents are our best customers 6i about how they grow up and what they play with. I think that's terrific. It makes for one world. I love to visit our stores and listen to our customers— just to find out what they want. I was on a trip last week and I probably spent $50 out of my pocket. Thaf s because Five-year olds make ruthl ss custo ers. They can refuse their child anything— they can refuse a grandchild nothing. We now sell virtually the same toys all over the world. So it stands to reason, if all these kids are playing with the same toys, how could they ever possibly fight with each other? There's a common thread everything works with the American Express® Card. Hotels, restaurants, car rentals— they all accept the Card. So I don't have to walk around with much money in my pocket. And ifs a great record of my trip.

Dustin Hoffman doesn't want to join all the president's men. The actor turned down an invitation to participate in Quincy lones's inaugural salute to President-elect Bill Clinton, says a Washington insider. \"Dustin is good friends with Quincy,\" says the source, adding that people are wondering if the notoriously crowd-shy actor may have wanted to avoid inaugural mobs. The free three-hour event, on January 1 7 at the Lincoln Me- morial, begins the week of inaugural events and is to feature Tony Bennett, Michael Bolton, Diana Ross, L.L. Cool |, and Aretha Franklin. Jack Nicholson is also scheduled to read \"his- toric passages\" along with Ted Danson, Whoopi Goldberg, Sid- ney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, and others. An inaugural-committee spokeswoman says, \"You have to take up why [Hoffman] didn't want to do it with his publicist.\" Hoffman's spokesman did not return calls. DUSTIN HOFFMAN QUAYLE TO HIT ROCKY VAIL TRAIL? Dan Quayle isn't listening to Hollywood. A source says the departing vice-president has been talking about buying a vacation home in Vail, Colora- do, and is undaunted by the celebrity call to boycott the state because of recent legisla- tion limiting gay rights. \"[Quayle] says that he thinks gays have enough rights, and that he believes Colorado made the right deci- sion with the amendment,\" says the source, who adds that the Quayles are avid skiers and have been vacationing in Vail for years. The White House didn't re- turn calls. THIS IS HIS LIFE: D'AMATO'S AUTOBIO Al D'Amato is betting that readers will pay to hear his side of the story. The controversial U.S. sen- ator — who was recently re- elected after a bitter battle with State Attorney General Robert Abrams — has been talking to publishers around town about writing a book. In a proposal, D'Amato says he would \"like to start off by re- calling the emotional ups and downs of the 1992 Senate campaign\" and also promises to \"explore the political charges leveled against me . . . and the personal price that my family and I have had to pay as a result.\" \"Originally, I wasn't that keen on the idea,\" says Carol Publishing's Steven Schragis, \"but we had a great three-and- a-half-hour lunch. I was im- pressed, and I'm bidding on it.\" \"It's both autobiographical and political — and, 1 expect, exciting and controversial,\" says agent Kay McCauley. \"I don't want to say much about it yet. 1 feel we're fairly close to doing something with it.\" THEY'RE LESS THAN ZEALOUS FOR ZUCKY Not everyone is eager to take the helm of Mort Zucker- man's newest ship. The real -estate mogul, who recently bought the belea- guered Daily News, tried to lure the editor of the Boston Herald to head up the New York tabloid. Ken Chandler, who worked as an editor at the New York Post from 1978 to 1 986, turned him down, says a source. \"I had a couple of meetings with Mr. Zucker- man,\" says Chandler. \"They were good meetings, but after | the second one, I decided I I GORDON LISH IANUARY 25, 1993/NEW YORK 9 Copyrigh MINIMALISM HOLDS NEW MEANING FOR LISH Gordon Lish's court victory isn't quite what it seemed. The Knopf editor sued Harper's Magazine for reprinting parts of a letter he had sent to students interested in his infa- mous fiction-writing course. Lish had argued in the highly pub- licized case that the letter was not meant for publication. Some members of the media were surprised last November when the judge ruled that Lish's copyright had been violated and ordered Harper's to pay him $2,000 in damages. Now the judge has amended his own ruling and decided that the Harper's excerpt didn't devalue the letter, and that the magazine doesn't have to fork over any money. \"This is very gratifying and exciting,\" says Harper's publisher John R. MacArthur. \"Not only for us, but for journalists and publishers in general.\" When asked if he was surprised by the move, Lish said, \"I've lived enough years to be surprised by nothing on the surface of this Earth. ... I think I must say this undertaking was never engaged for acquiring any kind of monetary punishment from Harper's but rather a public accounting of the wrongdoing they committed, and that indeed was accomplished.\" Much of the trial testimony con- cerned the way Harper's had edited down the lengthy Lish letter. associate: Jan Gelman Photographs: lop.

EDITORS' NOTES LARRY KRAMER LASHES OUT AT MACNEIL Larry Kramer has taken on Robert MacNeil. The aids activist and playwright, who wrote The Normal Heart and The Destiny of Me, sent a letter to the co-anchor of The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, accusing him and the show of slighting gay issues: \"I state — with- out any hesitation or equivocation or caveats — [your show] has the worst record on gay and aids coverage of any news program.\" Kramer went on to mention that MacNeil's son is openly gay. \"Are you that ashamed of him that you cannot bear for your program to deal with issues that remind you of him? Do you not ever worry that he might come down with aids? Or be fag bashed?\" \"[Co-anchor] Jim Lehrer and [correspondent] Judy Woodruff join me in saying that your letter is intemperate and insulting to a program that has been conscientious and responsible in covering gay and aids issues,\" MacNeil wrote back. \"I am also offended by your charge of hypocrisy regarding my son. ... I am very proud of him personally and professionally.\" MacNeil also included an ex- tensive list of segments that have dealt with aids and gay issues. TREACH, FROM NAUGHTY BY NATURE 10 NEW YORK/lANUARY 25, 1993 didn't want to pursue it any further.\" Chandler is rumored to be leaving for Fox Televi- sion, but he says, \"There are no moves contemplated.\" One source points out that Zuckerman has apparently nixed the increasingly popular idea of installing a British im- port to run the paper. Al- though Zuckerman had re- portedly considered hiring Martin Dunn from the British tabloid Today, everyone on his new \"shortlist\" has New York experience. Says the source, \"I guess he didn't want his editor to run into the newsroom next Christmas all excited because someone was putting up a big tree in Rocke- feller Center.\" Tabloid insiders are also buzzing that Zuckerman wants to woo Pete Hamill away from the New York Post — as a columnist or even as a top editor. A spokeswoman says Zuck- erman wouldn't comment un- til a decision had been made. Hamill didn't return calls. BEYOND THE VELVET ROPES AT CLUB USA Club USA [New York, January 18] was the death of the party recently. Bill Coleman, a dance-music coordinator for the Pow Wow record compa- ny and a manager for Deee- Lite, was invited to throw a party for his new compilation record at the West 47th Street club. But when the guests on his list arrived, many were turned away at the door. \"Here I was, going to have a good time on a Saturday night and support someone 1 work with,\" says a Pow Wow staffer. \"I came with a carload of peo- ple, and everyone got thrown out. Even the head of the label had trouble at the door, and the artists themselves couldn't get in, and they are part of the rec- ord. 1 don't know what the door policy is, but I think it is hell-bent on making everyone feel horrible.\" The club's promotions direc- tor says, \"There were a lot of young guys on that list that we felt didn't warrant complimen- tary entry on a Saturday night.\" WASHINGTON POST PONDERS 7MWARP Some top editors at the Wash- ington Post aren't impressed by the editing at Time. Post executive editor Leon- ard Downie Jr. and managing editor Robert Kaiser are among the journalists who wrote to Time in defense of former Post reporter Dusko Doder. In a De- cember 28 article. Time ques- tioned whether Doder had been recruited by the KGB. Time printed their letter, but Downie and Kaiser aren't pleased with what was deleted and have written another: \"We write to take issue with the way you altered, without any consultation with us, the substance of our letter. . . .

Hot rap artist Treach, who has been on the cover of Vibe and whose hits include \"O.P.P.,\" was unhappy with some of his co- workers at Tommy Boy, his Manhattan-based record label, headed up by Monica Lynch. \"He got upset and said they were all a bunch of rats and snakes,\" says one insider. \"And he came into the office with a cage full of rats and snakes and let them go.\" \"That's not quite what happened,\" says a spokeswoman for the company. \"He was just having fun. They weren't snakes and rats. They were just field mice and a little pet-store garter snake.\" There was no commotion, she added, and a posse was formed \"to round up the mice.\" Photographs: lop.

MARCHES ON 'ENFORCED DIVERSITY': Gay protesters at the 1992 St. Patrick's parade. THE MAYOR AND ST. PATRICK'S DAY THE PROPONENTS OF COLORADO'S NOTORI- OUS Amendment 2 insist that they do not want to discriminate against homosex- uals. Instead, they say, they are simply op- posed to the institutionalization of yet an- other special-interest group hoping to acquire privileged status and benefits. This argument has been dismissed by most people as an utterly transparent and cynical rationalization for a bill that will in fact legitimize the persecution of homo- sexuals. After all, discrimination and vio- lence against homosexuals occurs regular- ly — and who is arguing that homosexuals deserve special privileges? Unfortunately, that is in effect what Da- vid Dinkins has done in his dispute with the Ancient Order of Hibernians over the inclusion of the Irish Lesbian and Gay Or- ganization in the Saint Patrick's Day pa- rade. The mayor's constitutionally insup- portable exercise in political symbolism has alienated Irish Americans and Roman Catholics and threatened to ruin one of the city's most famous, if occasionally rambunctious, annual events. The flap over the Saint Patrick's Day parade is only the most recent example of the mayor's policy of \"enforced diversi- ty,\" to use the phrase of Cooper Union ur- ban-affairs professor Fred Siegel. As he did with the Children of the Rainbow cur- riculum (though he let schools chan- 12 NEW YORK/lANUARY 25. 1993 cellor )oseph Fernandez bear the brunt of criticism for it), Dinkins is trying to use his political office to impose on the citi- zenry social values about which the soci- ety at large is still ambivalent. The mayor's intentions are good — ev- eryone's in favor of greater tolerance — but the methods with which he pursues his doctrine of inclusion are authoritarian. As a result, they're also counterproduc- tive: Promoting tolerance, he incites an- ger. \"The intent may be inclusion, but the result is division,\" says Henry Stern, the president of the Citizens Union and the former parks commissioner. \"The mayor thinks he's bringing people together, but in truth he's driving them apart.\" For more than 150 years, the city has granted the Ancient Order of Hibernians — a fraternal organization founded in 1836 whose members must be male, of Irish de- scent, and practicing Catholics — a permit to hold the Saint Patrick's Day parade. But in early January, after Dinkins declared that he was in favor of giving the permit to sponsors who would allow the Irish Lesbi- an and Gay Organization to march with a banner, police commissioner Raymond Kel- ly awarded the permit to a new group — led by Paul O'Dwyer and Charles Hynes — formed for the express purpose of allowing fringe organizations to participate. The mayor's decision — virtually no one believes Kelly acted of his own volition — I seems to represent a blatant violation of the right to free association enshrined in the First Amendment. Cardinal O'Con- nor, always eager to inject himself into the political arena, denounced the mayor, asking during a Sunday talk if, by the same principle, parades held by Greeks, Turks, Poles, Germans, Hispanics, and blacks would \"be required to become open forums for political expression.\" But it's not just the Catholics who are up- set. The New York Civil Liberties Union has weighed in on the side of the Hiberni- ans, arguing, as nyclu director Norman Siegel put it in a letter to Dinkins, that \"city officials would clearly violate [the] neutral- ity principle if they were to deny a parade permit to an organization because they dis- agree with the group's views or beliefs, no matter how unpopular, controversial, or politically incorrect those beliefs may be.\" The outraged Hibernians are now threat- ening to discourage the countless Emerald societies and the 80 school bands (from around the country and as far away as Ire- land) from attending. \"If the Hibernians say, 'The hell with it all,' and the average citizen doesn't march, the parade will just have a tiny group of gay activists and IRA bomb throwers, and that will sound a very sour note about the city,\" says John Hale, a lawyer representing the Hibernians. To argue that the Hibernians should be deprived of their permit, City Hall has had to execute some rather complicated gym- nastics. As the Hibernians point out, the parade does not actually discriminate against homosexuals, who are free as indi- viduals to march with any group of which they are a part. Furthermore, they insist, they have the right to \"shape the mes- sage\" of their parade by excluding groups with whose agendas they disagree or to whom they do not want to give the semi- official seal of Irish-American approval that marching confers. The list of excluded groups is, in fact, rather extensive. The IRA has been re- fused permission to march on several oc- casions, even though many of the Hiberni- ans support independence for Northern Ireland. Anheuser-Busch's offer to lend its Budweiser Clydesdales to the parade was rejected. Both Bobby Kennedy and |immy Carter were denied permission to march when they were candidates for president because the organizers wanted to avoid the appearance of endorsing them. Most significant, the Hibernians rejected a re- quest by an anti-abortion group to march because, while virtually all Hibernians subscribe to the church's teachings against abortion, they did not want to give Photograph by lor Lcvy/Gamma-Liaison.

If the Hibernians are allowed to turn down these groups, why should they be forced to accept a gay group? Do gay groups have a special status that other organizations do not enjoy? To avoid ad- mitting that this is in essence their position, the mayor's aides have had to argue that the religious views that preclude the Hiberni- ans from giving their endorsement to a gay group are irrelevant because the parade is not a religious event. It is instead, as the city's Human Rights Commission declared in October, a \"secular . . . celebration of a broad range of values surrounding Irish heritage.\" Anyone, the report went on, who wanted to celebrate \"Irish heritage\" must be allowed to march. But the claim that the event is not reli- gious in character is patently disingenu- ous. While the drunken, raucous crowds it attracts are hardly models of piety and devotion, the parade is held on the Roman Catholic Church's feast day celebrating the saint who converted Ireland to Chris- tianity. It is preceded by a special mass for the leading participants at Saint Patrick's Cathedral. The cardinal reviews the pa- rade from the steps of the cathedral, and marching dignitaries stop to shake his hand or, if they're Catholic, kiss his ring. As it happens, the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization, in a lawsuit against the Police Department for permitting the pa- rade, described it in a brief last spring as an \"annual religious parade.\" And the city's own corporation counsel, in a re- sponding brief, argued that \"the police department has no control over who may or may not participate in the parades for which it issues permits, nor may it consti- tutionally exercise such control.\" That position seems to be diametrically opposed to the one the mayor now takes, only instead of dictating who can march in the Hibernians' parade, he has encour- aged his newly appointed police commis- sioner to issue the permit to an organiza- tion that will include the groups Dinkins wants to have included. Why go through this entire charade, embroiling the city in a prolonged dispute that most people find tedious and irrele- vant? No one can question that Dinkins is sincerely devoted to promoting social tol- erance. But a number of political analysts point out that he will also need the gay vote in virtual bloc form in the upcoming mayoral election, because the dispute over the Children of the Rainbow curriculum has alienated elements in the black and Hispanic communities, and his reaction to Crown Heights, both during the riot and after Lemrick Nelson's acquittal, did not exactly strengthen his support among lews. In other words, as is so often the case in such situations, the rhetoric of multiculturalism is in part a calculated po- litical tactic. ™ 14 NEW YORK/IANUARY 25, 1993 aterial c I -o c N H •J • to S g 0 c 5 E to C « 00 Z, 00 B U W U 0 0 — i/i c B y — a u FT! y a. is .S u a J I w 3 II to — c If ir\\ c (N -3 a q U u i - OJ — Q B — «J — (/5 • - Q > E r cx U * C U s I 4_i U 3 £ c u D 1 1 D.T3 < 3 _c rt T3 E c 3 rt C -c -a 5 U If < 1 1 S .2 — — I o E g oj a. -5 ni .9 _D 8 2 S 1 o 3 | & _c o (« u <u 3 >.

Last year, while the fashion industry was more hobbled than haute, Armani's revenues topped $700 million. Around the world, the upwardly mobile spent $1.4 billion on Armani's luxurious, un- derstated, slightly androgynous clothing and accessories. A med-school dropout, Armani was a department-store buyer in Milan before spending six years as an assistant designer to Nino Cerruti. He left to free-lance, and in 1974 teamed with longtime friend Ser- gio Galeotti to design under his own name. Armani tore apart the traditional men's suit, killed the padding, and made something soft and drapey. Then he tack- ARMANPS NEW FRAGRANCE HOW DOES DAVID LYNCH SELL PERFUME? Like everyone else in adland: with a sleek limousine, a star in dark glasses, and — yes — paparazzi. All for Gio, the hot new scent from Giorgio Armani. Lynch's spot, due soon, recalls the odd little dramas of Obsession, Society, and other women's fragrances. But here, the impresario of Twin Peaks and blue Velvet restrains him- self. Nothing grotesque or hallucinatory, lust haunting music, a touch of eccentrici- ty .. . and beautiful people. Gio, short for Giorgio and pronounced \"|oe,\" \"is the perfume expression of the principles that govern my life,\" Armani says. And, he adds, Lara Harris, the Isa- bella Rossellini look-alike who stars in the spot, has the \"charm, beauty, and risks\" Gio emits. And Lynch? Ar- mani had admired his brooding tone, his surrealism and sleepy pace. Not to mention the weird imagery and garish lighting. (Lynch has been called, among other things, a \"psy- chopathic Norman Rockwell\"; he pho- tographed Rossel- lini naked and bruised in Blue Vel- vet.) Besides, Ar- mani's two other candidates were CURIOUS GIORGIO: In the latest perfume psychodrumu, the look is Lynch. busy. The campaign is silent, so it can run globally. Lynch filmed it in a sixties style; it's another of his cryptic mood pieces. The heroine, unpredictably, glides through time and space — from a black-tie affair to a jazz club. This is Armani's second attempt at a women's perfume. Since 1982, the com- pany has marketed Armani for Women, but that fizzled here. And it sells a men's fragrance, Giorgio Armani for Men, which has been more successful. Though Cosmair — one of the world's largest fra- grance distributors — licensed the new product. Armani himself orchestrated every last detail. He chose the scent, the shape of the bottle, the parchment pack- aging, the display ads, and the sales led peacockish women's clothes, invent- ing a comfortable, self-assured, elegant look. When Galeotti died, in 1985, Ar- mani took over the business side of the company. Armani's philosophy is elitist; he will close boutiques that don't flourish. The most accessible line, Collezioni, sells in just 160 American stores. Even A/X, or Armani Exchange, where shoppers can stock up on jeans for $78 to $ 1 20 and T- shirts for $23 to $38, has but 32 branches — not exactly the Gap. Gio, however, will hit 500 stores by spring, a leap for Armani (but still less than half the number of outlets that usual- ly carry a new scent). That's Cosmair's doing. For years, the distributor urged Ar- mani to market a new woman's perfume. \"All our attention was concentrated on clothing,\" says Gabriella Forte, Ar- mani's second in command. \"Now we see the need to widen the net.\" His golden rules have been \"eliminat- ing the superfluous, emphasizing the comfortable, and acknowledging the ele- gance of the uncomplicated.\" \"Luxury,\" Armani has said, \"is knowing how to live in harmony with oneself and with others. The first step toward serenity and simplicity is to overcome the super- fluous.\" Adds Forte, \"We're following the traditional route of major fashion houses. Every fashion house must have a serious beauty business for longevity.\" (Another women's fragrance is set for 1995, to be fol- lowed by Armani cosmetics.) As for the TV spot, \"a lot of what's going on, viewers bring to the story,\" says Robert Cassou, general manager of Europe- an designer fra- grances at Cosmair. \"They put them- selves in the picture.\" And Cosmair is giving them ample opportunity, by spending at least $20 million to ad- vertise and pro- mote Gib. Print ads, from one-page teasers to seven- page inserts, will run in dozens of life-style and fashion magazines and daily newspapers. Bus shelters here will heighten the mystery. And if you live in New York or Southern Florida (the second-largest market for designer fragrances), you'll see plenty of the TV tale. Plus, you'll sample the scent, at Gio counters and from magazine strips galore. Prospective customers — affluent, sophisticated working women — will be invited to stores for a large trial gift. \"It's a carnival when you launch a fragance,\" says Cassou. Gio smells like hyacinth, orange blos- som, and tuberose. But in a world where what's in the bottle is less important than the bottle itself, it's likely the Armani im- 16 new york/ianuary 25, 1993 Co age will be what attracts buyers — just as Elizabeth Taylor's glamour first sold White Diamonds. Gio will appeal to \"Ar- mani loyalists as well as those curious about the legend,\" says Forte. \"Imagery will initially persuade. The 'juice' will bring them back.\" But there are obstacles. Over the past decade, some 30 new women's scents a year fought for a piece of the $3.5-billion market. Last year, according to Annette Green, president of the Fragrance Foun- dation, 28 women's fragrances were launched; in 1990, there were more than 40. And 1993 began with a bang: En route are Thierry Mugler Parfum's Angel, Giorgio Beverly Hills's Wings, Krizia's Krazy Krizia, Parfums Nina Ricci's La- lique, Shiseido's L'Eau D'lssey, and Ni- cole Miller's fragrance, which will bear her name. The journey from launch to success is perilous. Big companies routinely spend as much as $75 million to introduce a scent worldwide, says Cassou. \"Some 60 percent die in the first year, and perhaps 90 percent don't meet the aggressive goals set for them.\" Talk about aggressive: Cas- sou expects Gio to be among the top three fragrances in department stores, where it will be sold beside some 70 other scents. While Armani's marketing is usually low-key, Gid's launch won't be. A dinner and fashion show in New York on Febru- ary 4 for 500 customers, the press, and the fabulous should be a hot ticket. Even the reclusive billionaire will show up — Armani's first business appearance in America since 1990, when Made in Mi- lan, Martin Scorsese's documentary about him, premiered. (Scorsese filmed Ar- mani's earlier spots. And Lynch, it turns out, shot four — for Calvin Klein's Obses- sion. Armani claims he never saw the spots, set to quotes from F. Scott Fitzger- ald, Ernest Hemingway, D. H. Lawrence, and Gustave Flaubert.) Armani print ads have largely resem- bled the Gap's: Their black-and-white photos sell the models' serenity and con- fidence more than their clothes. The ex- ception: the literally nuts-and-bolts ads for Armani Exchange. Unlike most ads created by Armani and his in-house agency (run by his sister Rosanna), the A/X pieces were developed with Weiss, Whitten. Carroll. Stagliano. \"With Gio we have Armani's aspira- tional life-style and Cosmair's accessible price and distribution,\" says Cassou. (A half-ounce flacon of the perfume costs $150, while 1.7 ounces of the eau de parfum sells for $47.) \"We believe we have the right name, packaging, retail outlets, direct mail, advertising, and models,\" Cassou adds. \"Let's face it — this is a will-o'-the-wisp world. In the end, if we don't succeed, it can only be that there's something wrong with the scent.\" ™ Josef Hoffmann: Designs Selections from the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts (MAK), Vienna IBM Gallery of Science and Art Madison Avenue at 56th Street November 24 - January 23, 1993 Tuesday-Saturday, 1 lam -6pm Free Admission Support for the exhibition was provided by: Austrian Cultural Institute, New York Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Austria, Vienna The American Austrian Foundation.

Soon after Tina Brown became editor of The New Yorker last fall, the magazine ran a short item about the Shawcross book, then just out in London, claiming that Shawcross had perpetrated a piece of hagiography after being \"beguiled\" by the crafty press lord. Brown is married to Random House chief Harold Evans, fired by Murdoch as editor of The Times of London, who comes across in the Shaw- cross book as a less-than-competent exec- utive — and a bit of a fawner and whiner in the bargain. A great hoo-ha ensued. Novelist |ohn le Carre accused Brown of turning the once-revered New Yorker into a partisan sheet; Brown retorted that it was \"sexist\" to accuse her of banging \"some drum for my husband.\" Manicured hands were wrung and capped teeth grit- ted on both sides of the \"issue\" for a cou- ple of news cycles; then journalism's ever quavering attention span skipped on to the elections, Somalia, and Amy Fisher. Now American readers can judge for themselves whether Shawcross in fact conferred sainthood on Murdoch in Mur- doch (Simon & Schuster, $27.50). This is certainly the best biography yet written of the media magnate. Shawcross is no fawner; rather, he proves himself a thor- ough, clear-eyed, and exquisitely even- handed biographer. (Murdoch agreed to be interviewed, but when Shawcross sent him the finished manuscript to check on accuracy, Murdoch returned it with a \"no comment.\") Yet Shawcross falters where previous biographers also fell short: He never quite explains why Murdoch's News Corporation became such a dominant force in the new Information Age, and why Murdoch himself emerged as the sole indi- vidual to control one of the giants of international me- dia. There is no Rosebud here. The \"real\" Rupert Murdoch remains some- what elusive to Shawcross. Along the way, though, Shawcross takes readers on Murdoch's rollicking journey from schoolboy in the backwaters of Ade- laide, where his father, Sir Keith Murdoch, was a newspaper editor and man- HOME ALONE: Emperor of the airwaves. MAKING BOOK: Evenhanded. ager, to Citizen Rupert, lord of the media global village. Shawcross suggests, but doesn't really develop, the idea that being combative is part of Murdoch's nature. Wellborn himself, Murdoch constantly takes on establishments of all sorts. He's fought, at one time or another, the en- trenched media powers of Australia and England; the labor barons of the London newspaper unions (the battle of Wap- ping — his plant in East London — brought computer production to the English dai- lies, years after it had arrived everywhere else); senators Ted Kenne- dy and Fritz Hollings; and most recently, through his Fox TV and studio hold- ings, the three old-line net- works and the Hollywood entertainment hierarchy. \"My past,\" Murdoch told Shawcross, \"consists of a series of interlocking wars.\" As an Englishman, a lib- eral intellectual, and a critic of the irresponsible use of power — Shawcross demol- ished Nixon and Kissinger in Sideshow, his 1979 ac- count of American involve- ment in Cambodia — the au- thor might have been ex- pected to savage his sub- ject. Previous biographers attacked Murdoch for his Tory politics, his blatant slanting of the political coverage in some of his papers, and his uncom- moner's claims to under- stand what the common man wants. Shawcross's Murdoch, however, is an unmalign, even admirable, figure. His pursuit of pow- er has a natural symmetry: People want information and entertainment, and he intends to be their leading supplier, everywhere at once. At his worst, the Mur- doch of Murdoch moves through the pages as a predatory entrepreneur, constantly cruising — when the right opportunity ap- pears, he bites. Sometimes he gets bitten himself by other capitalist sharks. Re- flecting on the $3 billion he paid to Walter Annenberg for Triangle pub- lications, publisher of TV Guide, Murdoch told Shawcross. \"Maybe I was a bad buyer, too keen.\" His closest associates thought TV Guide was past its prime. More often, though, Shawcross's Mur- doch turns out to be the smartest of the capitalist sharks. In the spring of 1985, he ran into John Kluge, the owner of Metro- media, a group of independent TV sta- tions in major American markets, includ- ing New York, Chicago, and Washington. Kluge thought the era of over-the-air broadcasting was over, laid to rest by ca- ble, VCRs, and pay-per-view channels. Murdoch figured otherwise; he saw Me- tromedia as the core of a fourth U.S. net- work and a worldwide communications empire. Television, moreover, could be a prime outlet for the film library Murdoch had already acquired along with 20th Century Fox's studios. Murdoch didn't think a group of choice stations would come on the market again. He paid $1 .85 billion for Metromedia. His associate Barry Diller called the price ab- surd. Murdoch acknowledged he had paid a premium price, but \"it was the one time in life when wholesale is more important than retail.\" The rest is already media leg- end — The Simpsons, as well as Studs.

In 1988, Cond6 Nast fired Grace Mirabella, the longtime editor of Vogue. Murdoch asked her if she would like to start a new high-fashion magazine. She agreed, and Mirabella was born — without benefit of memos, planning com- mittees, or test issues. A Current Affair, the first of the tabloid TV shows, came about in the same just- do-it way. Murdoch called Maury Povich, host of a local Washington talk show, and told him Fox was going to produce a daily TV magazine, starting in the New York market and then proceeding to national syndication. A child of the old-think TV, Povich was astounded by the \"sheer au- dacity of it all.\" \"Good Rupert\" and \"Bad Rupert\" show up most conspicuously in Shaw- cross's accounting of the Murdoch years at the New York Post. Shawcross says Murdoch was \"besotted\" with the Post and with romantic New York, \"the hub of world media.\" But Murdoch didn't be- have like a man crazed by love. With cool, Fleet Street smarts, he boosted the Post's circulation above 900,000, printing as many as eight editions a day while offer- ing Wingo cash-prize games. \"Up yours\" headlines also helped: headless body in topless bar became a classic. Nonethe- less, the Post remained the third paper in a three-paper market; it was also a Repub- lican paper — the Post endorsed Ronald Reagan twice — in a Democratic town. Once again, Murdoch was cocking a snoot at the local establishment. Murdoch's downmarket approach didn't attract the readers he needed the most, in middle-class Queens and other neighborhoods where the Daily News was the tab habit. One of Murdoch's best edi- tors, Frank Devine, summed up the Post 's dilemma: \"Rupert was trying to run a lumpen proletarian paper in a country where there is no lumpen proletariat. He hid this from even himself, because he is such a good salesman.\" Yet when Murdoch acquired the Metro- media station in New York and the govern- ment's media cross-ownership rules meant he would have to relinquish the Post, he de- layed and delayed. He thought his Reagan- administration friends could find a way to exempt him from federal law; but Ted Ken- nedy and Fritz Hollings, in a bit of legisla- tive sleight of hand in the U.S. Senate, closed off that chance. Even then Murdoch tried to hold on. He mused about turning the Post into a national daily — the USA To- day he always wished he had started before Al Neuharth and Gannett did. None of Murdoch's associates, including his wife, Anna, believed he should keep the Post. When the paper was finally sold to Pe- ter Kalikow in March 1988, Murdoch went into a deep depression. So he embarked on what he called his \"expansionary lunge\": the Triangle acquisition, the start-up of a British satellite channel, and ventures into 22 NEW YORK/IANUARY 25, 1993 Co aterial the crumbling Communist bloc. It was a \"cure\" that almost cost him his empire when the worldwide recession hit. Mur- doch's creditors insisted that he sell olf some assets (among ihcm. New York, which he owned from 1977 to 1991, and eight other Murdoch magazines). Shawcross generally avoids the slippery slope of psycho-journalism. But the biog- rapher can't resist the game of Who Is Ru- pert Murdoch and Why Is He So Intent on Running Everything? Shawcross likens Murdoch to Richard Nixon (guarded and shy, restless, possessed of \"a global vi- sion . . . and ruthless in pursuit of it\") and, yes, to Bart Simpson (\"cantanker- ous, aggressive . . . with a charming side that could manipulate people\"). In the end, though, Rupert Murdoch is Sir Keith's son. He is also the grandson on his mother's side of Rupert Greene, a half- Irish gambling man, and on his father's side of the Reverend Patrick Murdoch, minister of the Free Church of Scotland. Punter and prelate, roisterer and estab- lishmentarian, \"Bad Rupert\" and \"Good Rupert.\" The analysis works to a point. Shaw- cross is on less firm ground when he tries to explain why Murdoch has been so suc- cessful. He argues that with the Evil Em- pire gone, the world is now entering the era of the Video Empire and Murdoch is uniquely positioned to benefit, with his hands on newspapers, TV stations, book publishers, satellite channels, movie stu- dios, and information services. But why Rupert? There are other charming, aggressive, disciplined vision- aries. One explanation might be that Mur- doch is smarter than eight out of ten of his fellow entrepreneurs. (Perhaps ten out of ten: TV Guide may be turning around, and Fox has become the fourth network.) Who wouldn't have an up-yours attitude toward establishments — as well as a taste for combat — if so many fights ended in victory? Also, Murdoch may be the right man for a right time: Capitalism won the Cold War, Western ideals about free- flowing information have prevailed. Mur- doch's business interests and his (genu- ine) conservative views go hand in hand, all the way to the bank. Murdoch is now 61. Running through Shawcross's book is the Murdoch litany: He doesn't want to lose control of News Corporation to public stockholders or to partners because he doesn't want to dilute the family holdings. But nowhere does Shawcross, or for that matter Murdoch, give any hint of a real succession. Murdoch is illustrated with sixteen pages of photographs. In the last plate, Rupert Murdoch looks straight at the camera, his brow furrowed, one hand thrust in his trouser pocket. He stands in front of a satellite dish, symbol of the new world media order.

Leslie Harris hung out on the streets, drew on her own inner-city childhood, and, naturally, rode a lot of subway. The end product: lust Another Girl on the IRT, which Harris wrote, directed, and co-produced, making her the first black American woman to release what is practically her own feature film. fust Another Girl follows Chantel, a smart and brassy 1 7-year-old whose plans to get out of the projects by becoming a doctor are wrecked when she gets Harris: Telling the story by any means necessary. pregnant. \"It's a story that needed to be told,\" says Harris. Hollywood wasn't so sure. When studio executives read the script, they wondered where all the violence, drugs, and guns were. That story, Harris insisted, had already been told. So she scrapped the advertising career that had lured her to New York and recruited such noteworthy backers as writer Nelson George, Roger & Me creator Michael Moore, and author Terry McMillan. Using rented equipment, which she stored in her Fort Greene apartment. Harris filmed for seventeen grueling, unpredictable days, facing threats, expulsions, even a fistfight. Like the project, its creator existed hand-to-mouth. \"I didn't have food in my fridge,\" Harris remembers, \"I had film canisters.\" The earliest screenings were held in her kitchen. But after three years of hustling, Harris has finally won an audience for her provocative, unsettling, and captivating tale: It is currently being shown at Robert Redford's Sundance Film Festival and opens in New York on February 26, with Miramax distributing. Harris gratefully recalls how hundreds of actors showed up for the casting call. \"I'm blessed to have had a chance to give young black actors an outlet,\" she says. One of them, a dancer and actress named Ariyan lohnson, came in with enough sass to take home the lead role. \"We were blown away by the talent out there,\" says co-producer Erwin Wilson. \"There isn't enough product for young black actresses right now.\" With filming done, it's time to wait for the reviews, which are hardly foremost in Harris's mind. \"I made this movie for young black women who haven't seen themselves represented on film,\" she says. \"I made a movie / wanted to see.\" Mark Healy GRUNGE WATCH RUBE CHIC FRIENDS VISITING FROM Paris wanted to go dancing to see for themselves the hip New York club scene I've bragged about.

Located just off the sixth- floor composing room in the News Building, the Rubber Room is yet another legend in the newspaper's protracted — and increasingly bloody — labor war. Long the domain of the New York Typographical Union No. 6, the room began life as an ordinary break lounge to which union men retreated from the grinding task of setting type in molten lead. In 1 974, the union won a contract guaranteeing lifetime employment, in exchange for which the News was allowed to automate. By the late seventies, computerized typesetting had eliminated many of the typographers' tasks, yielding countless idle hours. The Rubber Room was in its heyday. \"They called it the Rubber Room because guys used to bounce off the walls,\" says one former News reporter. (Others see bridge-pkying connotations in the name.) \"It was really Hoffa, full of all these united we stand WILD KINGDOM The Greatest Show on Earth SINCE 1975, IUMBO THE ELEPHANT'S ELEVEN- foot-tall skeleton has stood far from his adoring public, in a dark nook on the third floor of the Museum of Natural History's mammalogy department.

But in 1885, as )umbo climbed aboard his own railroad car, he was struck by a freight train and killed. His skeleton was preserved and exhibited by Barnum, who later presented it to jumbo in 1865 and today: As ambassadorial in death as he was in life. the shelves are neatly folded elephant and rhinoceros hides from the turn of the century. Now, jumbo, who was a star practically before there was such a thing, will travel downstairs for the biggest role of his life.

But he grew violent — perhaps, according to |umbo- ologists, because of an impacted wisdom tooth. Deemed unfit for zoo life, he was sold the museum. Now, he is being paraded once again. \"|umbo: The World Famous Elephant,\" the exhibit opening January 22, is about both a remarkable life and the need for conservation of the wild African elephant and other animals.

(Management says it did try some retraining but ditched the effort, fearing that employees would exercise their right to refuse a transfer.) One by one, union members accepted buyouts or retirement, their number dwindling from 937 in 1974 to 167. Then, last month, a three-judge appeals panel allowed Zuckerman to buy out 50 of the remaining typographers for now (he may ultimately trim to just 18). This left Zuckerman free to take over the paper and, as was widely feared, fire 1 70 additional News employees. The panel's ruling also rendered the Rubber Room officially obsolete. \"The room is still there, but it's empty,\" says one News reporter who was lucky enough to survive Zuckerman 's sword. \"Which is, I guess, a pretty good metaphor for this place.\" Alex Williams OVERHEARD )UST BEFORE CURTAIN TIME AT last Saturday's matinee of Someone Who'll Watch Over Me: first woman: Oh, this is the show with the Gershwin music. second woman: No, this is the show with the hostages in Lebanon.

IANUARY 25, I993/NEW YORK 25 FAST TRACK BOOKSHELF Getting to the Marrow THINKING ABOUT THE TEN years she devoted to her first novel, Bone, Fae Myenne Ng shakes her head. \"I never thought I'd finish it,\" she confesses, nursing a cup of cappuccino in a West Village cafe. \"It took a long, long time for it to fall into place.\" Ng, 36, recalls when, as a child in San Francisco, she helped her mother in a sweatshop. \"One of my duties was to write the little code number of my mother's sewing machine onto the laundering tabs. I used to sneak out on weekends and go to the department stores and look for the dresses she'd sewn. I never found her dresses, but somehow, finding my book in the bookstore was like that — finally finding something that belonged to me.\" An impressive addition to the growing list of novels by Asian-American women, Bone (Hyperion; $19.95) is a spare and moving portrait of a family in San Francisco's Chinatown coping with the suicide of the second of three daughters. Like Leila, the book's narrator, Ng is thoroughly rooted in Chinatown traditions. She, too, is the daughter of immigrants with whom she can't fully share her life; Ng's parents, in fact, will have to wait until Bone is translated to read it. \"This is a world 1 know very well, but it's important for me to respect personal lives,\" Ng offers, addressing the resemblance of Bone to her own life. \"My test as a fiction writer was to create a whole landscape — a place and people that express everything I learned growing up in that world.\" Ng, a passionate reader who names Tillie Olsen, Eudora Welty, and the Chinese poets she memorized as a child among her literary influences, completed her Novelist Ng: Making home wherever a writer, led an itinerant life, which included a trip to China in 1 985. A few years ago, they finally settled in their apartment on the edge of Park Slope. \"It wasn't easy leaving Chinatown,\" Ng admits. \"But to be home or to be a family is just a feeling. It's something I picked up from the old-timers. They made home wherever they were. Traveling a lot | the last few years really gave me a sense of how to live — taking everything with you that you needed.\" If writing Bone was a struggle, coming up with the title was easy. \"The whole ritual of sending the bones back to China was fascinating to me,\" Ng says, referring to the desire of many early she is. Chinese immigrants to be buried in their M.F.A. from Columbia in 1984. Supported by grants and various teaching and temporary jobs, she and her husband, Mark Coovelis, also homeland. \"Bone is what lasts.

And if that's still not enough raw science, well, the kindly staff at Liberty Science Center might even let their Hissing Madagascar cockroaches, about the size of playing cards, crawl up your arms. While the $67-million center may never rank with the world's most wonder-inducing science museums, it's certainly the best this area has ever seen. It opens lanuary 24 in New lersey's Liberty State Park (the center can be reached from Manhattan by path trains, which connect with Liberty Science Center: Hands on, please. shuttle buses; there are plans for a ferry.) Even the building's exterior — geometric shapes in white aluminum with red accents — is intriguing. Inside, the 250 hands-on exhibits avoid the most common science-museum plagues: chaos and pedantry. \"We want to present reality in all its complexity,\" says exhibits coordinator David Hupert, \"but not pretend it will lie down and play dead for us.\" The enigmas begin just beyond the front door: Every few seconds, an \"expanding globe\" by inventor Chuck Hoberman swells from a four-foot-wide ball of aluminum elbows to an eighteen-foot-wide lacy sphere, and then contracts again, like a moody sea anemone. Downstairs is the invention floor, with do-it- yourself truss bridges and a long tube of foam pellets, driven by sound waves, that jitter anxiously. Upstairs, there are floors focusing on the environment (aquariums, glow-in-the-dark rocks) and health (machines that inform patrons of worn-out reflexes). During previews, all this has gone over big with those harshest of critics — elementary-school students. In the museum's comments book, they have scrawled such lofty praise as \"max facanating\" [sic], \"impressing,\" and \"I like the cockroaches.\" Eve M.

THE BABY BUST Why More and More Obstetricians Are Refusing to Deliver WHEN THE PHONE RANG IN THE MIDDLE OF the night about two years ago, Dr. Zoe Kessler* rose from her warm bed and pre- pared, as she had so many times before, to leave for Mount Sinai Hospital to deliver a baby. \"You realize,\" said her groggy husband as she was dressing, \"you're getting up at two in the morning to go increase your chances of being sued.\" Kessler is now sleeping through the night. She and her part- ner, both in their early forties, have stopped delivering ba- bies, as has one out of every six obstetricians in New York State (up from one out of ten in 1990), according to the state chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. More than half of the obstetrics residents who train here are leaving to set up practice somewhere else, and more than 70 percent of all family practitioners are no longer delivering ba- bies, creating a near-crisis that acog and many in the field call a flight from obstetrics. Most of these doctors talk about wanting their own lives back, uninterrupted by middle-of-the-night beepers for patients in labor. But overwhelmingly they cite soaring malpractice-in- surance rates and an atmosphere of litigation as deterrents to practice. They blame a system that holds them accountable * Names and other identifying details have been changed. II c E ~ ^ '<> ri Jj Tt 2 S\"S ft - '._ >■ o C * ss -. BY AIMEE LEE BALL 2 & for delivering a perfect infant even in circumstances beyond their control, and they point out that many physical and mental disabilities in babies, so often the fodder for malpractice claims, result from congenital defects, not physicians' errors during la- bor and delivery. They criticize the proliferation of 1 -800-sue- docs numbers on television and on subway posters as a modern version of ambulance chasing, promoting \"contingency\" cases for lawyers, in which disgruntled patients risk nothing in bring- ing suit — sometimes many years after the child's birth. \"I know of an office where a woman called asking questions about her forceps delivery,\" relates one obstetrician, \"because her son was going to have his bar mitzvah and couldn't read Hebrew well. This is what we live with.\" The flight from obstetrics is a national crisis — during one campaign debate, even George Bush spoke of \"crazy lawsuits\" and doctors afraid to deliver babies, in between sound bites on the fall of Saddam Hussein and the Berlin wall — but New York- ers are particularly litigious. One third of all New York obstetri- cians have been sued four or more times — the highest ratio for any state. \"Almost all OBs have been involved in litigation. It's an occupational hazard,\" says Dr. Frank Chervenak, director of obstetrics at New York Hospital. In the past decade, the number of obstetrical lawsuits in New York has increased almost 400 percent. The size of jury awards here is three times the national average: In 1990, there were fifteen awards in excess of $1 mil- lion; the following year, there were twice as many. In the past two years, there have been a $15-million lawsuit against Mount Sinai and one for $90 million against New York Downtown Hospital. These staggering sums are often reduced on appeal, but malpractice-insurance premiums to cover this kind of liabil- ity have risen exponentially: In New York, obstetricians' premi- ums are now second only to those of neurosurgeons. The stan- dard for Manhattan obstetricians is $75,000 a year, and in Suffolk or Nassau County, premiums can top $ 1 00,000. \"The money is a red herring,\" insists one Manhattan OB/ GYN, whose premium started at $70,000 because he was \"a good driver\" and dropped to $50,000 when he stopped deliver- ing babies. \"My fee was $5,000, and I delivered about 140 ba- bies a year. The first four made up the difference in premiums. The next 1 35 went toward my office overhead, not to mention my children's orthodontia.\" Obstetricians simply don't want to go through the emotional trauma of lawsuits — even if they win, even though their legal costs are paid by their insurance compa- ny. One doctor recalled that, upon winning a protracted lawsuit, he first called not his wife but his gastroenterologist. Most OBs are hoping that this year, the state Legislature will pass a bill supported by Governor Cuomo that would do nothing less than dismantle the current tort system of law. Instead of a plaintiffs having to prove a doctor's negligence in order to be compensated, a government com- mission would review cases of newborns im- paired at birth and compensate their parents from a pool funded by medical professionals — no DR. HARRY MORROW* REMEMBERS EVERY DETAIL OF December 31, 1 98 1 : His own daughter was just a few months old, so he and his wife weren't plan- ning a big night out for New Year's Eve, and he offered to cover for one of the partners in his ob- stetrics practice. The day before, the partner had delivered a healthy baby by cesarean section to a 25-year-old woman, who specifically had wanted the baby born before January 1 so she could have the tax deduction. The baby got flying colors on the ten-point Ap- gar test administered after every birth, and the mother was resting comfortably when Morrow made rounds in the hospital. \"It was her second baby,\" he remembers, \"and everything was fine. Her blood pressure was fine, her temperature was fine, she was start- ing to take liquids, she was sitting up in bed. So I wrote out our standard postop day-one orders, which are basically to get the pa- tient out of bed, because early ambulation makes for better recov- ery, and to discontinue her IV later in the day if things were going well. Everything was routine — she was perfectly fine.\" A few hours later, while Morrow was assisting in surgery, he got an emergency page: The patient he'd just seen had collapsed on the floor and was turning blue. \"I went running over to the mater- nity floor,\" he recalls. \"She was acting confused, her eyes rolling back, her head rigid. Immediately I called an internist, a neurolo- gist, a respiratory therapist. 1 wanted a cardiogram and a portable chest X-ray. There were two different diagnoses going on in my head, and while 1 was treating her for one thing, I was working her up for another. 1 gave her some Valium to stop the seizure, but I ordered an arterial blood-gas because it became clear that she was having a pulmonary embolus. That's a clot that goes from a vein to the lung. The size of the clot is not significant, but it sets up a whole cascade of events . . . and she died. \"Here's a woman I saw in the morning, who gets out of bed and drops dead. She has a baby that's a day old in the nursery, and her family comes to visit her. It was a horrible thing. There was not a physician or nurse in the hospital who heard about it that was dry-ityed. For months I had nightmares. That's not why I went into obstetrics. You don't lose mothers. With babies, from time to time, we know there are problems. We're not God, we're not perfect. But healthy 25-year-old women do not die.\" That's what the woman's family said when they sued Morrow for $5 million. \"Originally, everybody in my practice was sued,\" he says, \"the internist, the neurologist, people who just showed up as Good Samaritans. As a gynecologist, I was basically stand- ing there observing what they were doing. But everybody was dropped from the suit except me. They made me look like lack the Ripper, like I had stood by and watched this woman die. I did extensive research, and in my review I saw again that this is a listed complication of cesarean section. But there are no ac- cepted complications anymore. You can't have a bad result anymore. People expect one result, and that is perfection. You're pregnant, you go to your obstetrician, and nine months later you walk out with a perfect pink, robust, Apgar-ten Expectant parents are left wondering who will deliver lawsuit involved. This kind of legislation has al- ready been passed in Texas, Maryland, and Mis- souri and has powerful advocates in New York, including the March of Dimes and the Children's Aid Society. Un- less the new legislation is passed, OBs predict profound changes for women having babies: more trouble finding an obstetrician from a dwindling pool, and diminished care and attention through the pregnancy. But the bill is vehemently opposed by trial lawyers and some patients '-rights groups, who contend that the tort sys- tem is the only way medical consumers can be compensated for pain and suffering at the hands of butchers and quacks. With doc- tors and lawyers calling one another scoundrels, expectant parents are left wondering who will deliver babies in the future if the cur- rent trend holds. Midwives? Cabdrivers? Guardian Angels? baby who's going to grow up and become president.\" The jury ruled in Morrow's favor, and his life returned to nor- mal, albeit with some changes in office procedures to protect him. \"Documentation was a big issue in the case,\" he says, \"al- though when somebody is dying, you don't say, 'Wait a minute; I want to take notes.' Nurses were writing on the patient's bed sheets. I was writing on my pants leg. But now my charts are significantly thicker. We've basically been told by our insurance company that the burden is on us.\" Two years ago, Morrow's lavyyer notified him that the case was being appealed. That appeal is still pending, eleven years after the incident. \"If you're on the verge of leaving obstetrics, this is the type of case to do it,\" says Morrow, who at 43 is nevertheless still in practice — and who has seen his insurance premiums rise from 30 NEW YORK/lANUARY 25, 1993 Photograph by Tohru Nakamura.

People want to go where they perceive there is less pressure.\" child's life expectancy — plus an additional $ 1 1 million for medical expenses and estimated lost earnings. The child was born in 1978, but the case came to trial last year; it is being appealed. \"I can tell you that it turned that hospital upside down,\" says Bruder. \"I'd talk to the attending physicians, how they're afraid they're going to get sued. They're pretty much worried every day, and it doesn't make you want to run out there and help people. These are doctors who love what they do. To put so □abies in the future if the current trend holds. Midwives? Cabbies? Dr. Karen Bruder is one of those people. Bruder recently com- pleted an OB/GYN residency at New York Downtown Hospital but has set up her practice in Virginia. As a member of AOOG's board of junior fellows, Bruder did a study that found that, like herself, half of all obstetrics residents in New York relocate out- side the state. \"The malpractice situation in other states is so much better that it's worth leaving,\" she says. \"It's cheaper, a lot cheap- er. The insurance my first year out will be $8,000, and as long as I practice in Virginia, the most I'll pay is $35,000.\" While Bruder was a resident, New York Downtown found itself on the business end of a $90-million lawsuit. A baby had been bom six weeks prematurely with cerebral palsy, and a jury ruled that there had been a failure to diagnose fetal distress. It awarded $79 million for pain and suffering—^ 1 million for each year of the much time and energy into it and then have to give it up is sad. It hurts everybody. It would break my heart if I couldn't do it.\" IN 1986, HARVARD UNIVERSITY CONDUCTED A LANDMARK study to determine how much negligence occurred in New York hospitals and how much compensation was provided through the tort system. The study found that only one out of fifteen injured infants ever receives an award in New York, that claims take an average of eight to ten years from start to finish, and that the victims get only about 30 cents on the dollar — the rest is absorbed by lawyers' fees, \"expert\" witnesses, and court costs. \"Listen, I went into OB/GYN because I enjoy delivering babies,\" says Dr. Albert M. Ellman, who assisted with the Photograph by Ted Hardin. IANUARY 25, 1993/NEW YORK 31 Co RISKY BUSINESS Number of suits filed in New York. Bronx, Kings. Queens. Richmond. Nassau. Suffolk.

There is malpractice out there, and the guilty guy has to be taken out of the system. But the cause of cerebral palsy is overwhelmingly unknown. In 93 to 97 percent of the cases, the physician did not cause that CP baby, regardless of what we do in labor and deliv- ery, so why should we be exposed to this lottery system?\" Almost one third of those who give up OB do so before the age of 45, well before the normal time for burnout in medicine. \"You get to a certain age, and you don't need this crap any- more,\" says Dr. Richard Blum, chairman of a committee that ing sued because it was a bad outcome.\" One local insurance company, Medical Pro- fessional Liability Agency in Bedford Hills, has prepared a videotape for clients facing lawsuits. Called \"Dealing With Malpractice: You Are Not Alone,\" it stars doctors, lawyers, and Edward Reading, a Catholic priest who runs the Litiga- tion Stress Support Group for the Medical Soci- ety of New lersey. The message Reading hears over and over makes it understandable why OBs are bailing out, especially if they face the pros- pect of four or five lawsuits over the course of their career, as their insurers now expect. From the day the process server walks into the doc- tor's waiting room to the day the verdict comes in, there is anger, pain, panic, depression, em- barrassment, helplessness, and guilt. Dr. Leo Cooper* knows this litany of distress. In November, Cooper, an OB/GYN at one of Manhattan's most prestigious hospitals, sat in a downtown courtroom as a jury heard about a child he had deliv- ered eight years before who was normal at birth but was diagnosed eight months later with a muscular weakness on one side of his body. Cooper was accused of having missed the symptoms of fetal distress — which he claims were not present — and therefore not having performed a cesarean section. After a three-week trial — with the young boy sitting in the courtroom, one arm hanging at his side— Cooper was found negligent. On the advice of counsel, he will not reveal his real name or the amount of the monetary award, because the verdict will be appealed. \"I'm 46,\" he says, \"and I'm very cynical. Nobody wants to deliv- er babies, because they feel that regardless of what they do and CEREBRAL PALSY. Jeffrey Dahmer killed seventeen people and ate them and was on reviews malpractice issues at the New York Medical Society. \"We teach doctors about the legal process. We don't teach them how to avoid malpractice anymore — you can't, especially if you're an obstetrician. Now we teach them what to do when it comes. In Nassau County, where I am, if you don't get a suit every three years it means they don't love you.\" Proceeding on the assumption that there is comfort in num- bers, Blum started a support group for doctors who are sued. \"I try to calm them down,\" he says. \"They feel that their families and their houses are going to be taken away, that everything they've worked for is going down the tubes. When they get sued, it's a personal affront and they really take it to heart, to the extent that one doctor killed himself. The other day 1 had an OB on the phone who was going to give up, leave medicine. I asked her, 'Looking back on the case, would you have done anything differently?' and she said no. But it's a tremendous stigma. You've done everything you can for this patient, and you're be- how they do it, they are judged by the outcome, and the judgment is by show: Who puts on the best show? At my trial, they had an OB for their side who's testified as a witness at least 200 times. I'd never been in a courtroom before, other than seeing L.A Law. You're not sure who to dislike more, the lawyers for putting on this show or the doctors who come and lie on the stand. Jeffrey Dahmer killed seventeen people and ate them and was on trial less than I was. Unbelievable. But that's the system.\" Cooper is still delivering babies — at least for now. \"The peo- ple I work with all happen to enjoy doing obstetrics,\" he says. \"You have the ability to do something positive and constructive, and it makes you feel very good about yourself. This stuff doesn't make you feel less good about yourself, but it makes you look at all your patients as potential adversaries. You come back to the office and see people sitting there smiling at you, and all you can see is the other people in the courtr"
