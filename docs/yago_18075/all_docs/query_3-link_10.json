        "text": "‘TONIA MARKETAKI’, Warehouse D\n\nOn October 13, 14, and 15, there will be live screenings of two two-hour sessions at Warehouse D in the Port.\n\nScreening times:\n\n17:00-19:00\n\n20:00-22:00\n\nTickets for screanings at Warehouse D:\n\nTwo screenings per day: €7\n\nOne screening per day: €5\n\nPurchase your ticket at the ticket booths at the entrance of the venue.\n\nΑ’\n\nWENDIGO\n\nFélix Bouffard-Dumas, Canada\n\n14′\n\nThrough an exploded mosaic, the film proposes an experimental interpretation between the Wendigo’s legend and the Quebecers’ insecurities of their identity.\n\nDirector Biography – Félix Bouffard-Dumas\n\n~\n\nFABRIK\n\nSverre Aune, Germany\n\n19′\n\nShot entirely in Digital Infrared, FABRIK follows a lone humanoid creature, fighting for survival in a forsaken world – living off oil-spills from self-operating factories. Her quest for oil takes her across the desert and into an unknown world of steam and machines.\n\nDirector Biography – Sverre Aune\n\nSverre Aune was born in Trondheim, Norway, in 1994.\n\nGrowing up in the Norwegian countryside, he started experimenting with film and video by himself at an early age, and at 19 he moved to Denmark to study at European Film College. A year later he moved to Berlin to finish a BA in Practical Filmmaking at MET Film School Berlin. He joined the German Film and Television Academy Berlin in 2017, where he’s currently studying Film Directing. As well as directing, Sverre works as an Editor, co-owns a film club, co-hosts a film podcast and writes most of his own scripts himself.~\n\nDEMI-GODDESSES\n\nMartin Gerigk, Germany\n\n7′\n\n‘Demi-Goddesses’ is the second essay about still dominant dark aspects of our modern society. It is conceived as a surreal anti-patriarchal thought experiment and raises important questions about gender, power, and social change, prompting us to reflect on how historical patterns of discrimination and oppression might be either repeated or overcome in a reversed gendered world. It challenges the viewer to confront their own assumptions and biases, and to consider the possibilities of a more equitable society.\n\nOverall, the intention of the film is that it will spark conversations and inspire the viewer to imagine a world where gender is not a limiting factor. At best, the audience will leave the theater with a greater awareness of the issues and a sense of possibility for a just future.\n\nDirector Biography – Martin Gerigk\n\n~\n\nI KILLED YOU A DOZEN TIMES\n\nKris De Meester, Belgium\n\n6′\n\nI killed you a dozen times, but you won’t go away. Maybe it’s because you’ve killed me first. Out in the cold, on a strange new globe.\n\n“I Killed You a Dozen Times” immerses viewers in a captivating exploration of the aftermath of a traumatic breakup. The protagonist, driven to erase the other person from their existence, finds themselves exiled to a chilling and unfamiliar realm. As they confront the relentless echoes of their pain, the boundaries between reality and imagination blur, creating a surreal and introspective experience.\n\n“I Killed You a Dozen Times utilizes its title as a refrain, spoken by the narrator, as they bemoan a fruitless relationship. The film plays with the audience’s senses, both audibly and visually, keeping them constantly on edge. The camera voyeuristically passes over partially clothed women, lying motionless on the floor. The women, exposed and fragile, are a visualization of the emotional toll endured by the narrator. Moreover, the soundtrack emits a constant whirr, creating a palpable tension that’s never broken. Again, this mirrors the narrator’s perpetual, unanswered inquiry into why. All in all, the film exhibits an equal parts disturbing and eye-opening look at the post-breakup healing process. The combination of violent imagery, poignant narration, and acute sound design construct a unique, tangible representation of one’s incorporeal inner struggle.”\n\nShane McKevitt – Venice Film Week\n\n“I Killed You a Dozen Times expertly uses the power of visual language and sound to communicate complex emotions and experiences. Through its striking imagery and sound design, together with the emotive poetry recited by the narrator, the film masterfully portrays the agony and emotional struggles stem from toxic relationships, a subject that is often challenging to express in words. The film’s ability to vividly visualize and depict such complex emotions is a testament to its remarkable use of audio-visual storytelling.”\n\nJane Ching – Sundance Film Festival Hong Kong, Hong Kong Arthouse Film Festival\n\nDirector Biography – Kris De Meester\n\n~\n\nSANAA, SEDUCTRESS OF STRANGERS\n\nJan Eilhardt, Germany\n\n3′\n\nDirector Biography – Jan Eilhardt\n\n~\n\nALL EFFORT OF MEN\n\nJean-Gabriel Périot, France\n\n13′\n\nBIRDS DON’T LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOWS\n\nEirini Tampasouli, Greece\n\n7′\n\nIf I was a bird, I would look through the windows of the flats all the time.
