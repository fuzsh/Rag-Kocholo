It delineates the development, problems, trends, and personalities, as well as the main films, in chronological order; attempting in the process to highlight commonalities and incongruities, similarities and differences, continuities and ruptures. As a narrative history, the book is not concerned with trying to follow the complex structural or ideological threads of a more or less anarchic industry; although it does attempt to construct an “intelligible” account of what happened. It also avoids structuring the narrative around particular issues, such as the questions of identity that have become extremely voguish during the last 30 years in discussions about all things Greek. The creation of specific cinematic works or groups of works has always been underpinned by a complex interplay of many factors; consequently, there can be no single way of interpreting such a multifaceted and unpredictable cultural activity without limiting its semantic complexity. The history here refers to such issues to the degree that they have had an impact on the experience of watching films in the country. It deals primarily with the perceptual experiences that films create for their viewers and, therefore, focuses on their formal analysis and their historical contextualization. It approaches movies as cultural artifacts and as specific responses to wider questions and problems—artifacts that are articulated through visual means at specific moments in time and as singular problematizations of social realities. Probably, this book should have been written 30 years ago when the construction of a grand narrative was still feasible within the area of film studies. Since such a narrative is absent, we try to formulate it today while simultaneously identifying the structural asymmetries, ideological irregularities, and heterogeneous incongruities hidden beneath the thrust of a linear exposition. The book thus needs a companion volume that would explore the history of Greek cinema through the prism of specific genres, periods, and formalist questions as well from the point of specific analytic approaches, like feminism, subaltern studies, Hollywood hegemony studies, postcolonial and queer readings.\n\nviii\n\nPreface Until such a volume is prepared, we focus here on the realities that defined cinematic experience as lived history at a macro-historical level, in an attempt to delineate a history of emotions in Greek society. At the most elementary level, however, our main purpose is to illustrate the political, aesthetic, and technical difficulties that film-makers confronted in order to make films in Greece, and from there to discuss the wider problems they faced and explain the solutions they formulated.\n\nII The history of Greek cinema is a rather obscure and unexamined affair. Greek cinema emerged slowly and then collapsed. For several years it struggled to reinvent itself as it dealt with the uncertainties of a colossal national defeat in 1922; then, while in the process of recovering, it produced its first mature works, then broke down completely and almost vanished. For a short time before the Second World War, it resurfaced outside Greece, in Turkey and Egypt. During the War, it re-established its distribution and technological infrastructure and after 1944 flourished wildly, despite the indifference and hostility of its most formidable enemy, the Greek state. It was then continuously muzzled by strict censorship and government interference. In brief periods of moderate liberalization it proliferated beyond its own financial viability, showing the keen interest of audiences in watching Greek films, even of the most questionable quality. Yet under the strict surveillance of the 1967 dictatorship, Greek cinema produced some of its greatest achievements. After 1974, it exploded with a creative energy that sustained it for a decade, during which it was suffocatingly embraced by the government, until the euphoria of state-funded freedom meant it lost touch with its audience and—under the bureaucratic organization of the state—vanished almost totally. In the mid-1990s, young film-makers severed their ties with the recent past and began to construct novel cultural representations, creating a renewed connection with the estranged public, through new iconographic motifs and formal “investigations” which continue today. Throughout the last ten decades, production has generally been uneven. From a total of about 4,000 surviving movies, most are of a generic nature, characterized by a lack of experimentation with the medium and an avoidance of direct depiction of the stark realities surrounding the screen. Yet these realities have always been present through the mere recording of the cityscape, the depopulated countryside, and the psychology of characters in specific moments of history. No modernist experimentation with form and storyline or radical breakdown of narrative and image can be found in Greek cinema until very late in its development. We cannot find a single theoretical work of\n\nix\n\nx\n\nPreface reflection on the experience of watching movies until the early 1970s, nor a sociological approach to the act of going to the cinema itself, which was and continues to be a major event of collective socialization and a rite of passage for adolescents. Most Greek films were made for the immediate consumption of local audiences and with commercial success in mind. The majority were slapstick comedies, boulevard skits, dramas of passion, sentimental war movies, colorful musicals, and patriotic melodramas. They still remain the most successful products of the industry—through their remakes and reincarnations. Few movies (almost always financial failures) raised questions about history, class, gender, identity or cultural memory in ways that would make them interesting to audiences outside the country. Some of these films interrogated the structure of Greek society and the power arrangements within the nation state against the backdrop of oppressive political censorship, heavy taxation, and controlled distribution. The films were mainly “political” in the sense that they produced an oppositional way of looking at established perceptions of reality, of framing the real and of representing conditions of Greek society at particular moments in history. During most of its history, cinema, both as an industry and as a culture, developed in opposition to the institutions of the Greek state and its policies. Successive governments saw cinema as an enemy of the state and enacted strict censorship laws to control the ideas and forms that film-makers created in their attempts to construct a cinematic representation of Greek reality. Consequently, most people involved in the production of films, even those with conservative ideology, expressed opposition—explicit or implicit— to the dominant official ideology of the state as it was imposed through education, army, police, news media, and the Christian Orthodox Church. Such oppositional aesthetics were brought to the fore in periods of historical crises and at times of political unrest, as, for example, after the Asia Minor Catastrophe of 1922, the Civil War of 1946 to 1949, and during the military dictatorship of 1967 to 1974. Until the state became the main sponsor of the industry in the late 1970s, film-making was made possible only through the persistent vision and moral strength of certain exceptional cinematographers, who managed to construct and consolidate an iconographic idiom capable of depicting the Greek experience in a formally coherent visual language (despite the absence of sufficient production funding and well-equipped studios). Throughout the ten decades of its existence, Greek cinema would struggle to construct a visual metaphor that, within the modes of its specific historical consciousness, would heighten the understanding of reality and offer an opening into the realm of the possible, and occasionally even the utopian. The interplay, rather than the antagonism, between commercial and art-house movies, between film industry and film culture, has been the\n\nPreface other battleground for the development of cinema in Greece—a country that joined the club of “developed” European countries in the late 1970s and the European Union in 1981. The development of Greek cinema has always been intimately associated with deep infrastructural problems in technology, material culture, and scientific know-how. For many decades, all film equipment had to be imported while exorbitant production costs never allowed for the democratization of the medium by giving access to new professionals. Only in the late 1950s and early 1960s did technological progress offer the opportunity for more people to get involved in the industry and to make their mark. Even after the major technological problem was solved, however, the question of the audience was immediately posed. As a small market with limited investment capital, Greece could neither sustain a developed and organized system of film production with international distribution and appeal nor, even more importantly, attract international funding through co-productions, something that would have given a wider scope to Greek films. Greek cinema could not even attract foreign actors (as could, for instance, Italian and more recently Spanish cinema) who would have given an international appeal to local films. Almost all Greek movies were made for domestic consumption, addressing local problems within the parameters of specific historical circumstances. This contextual specificity of these movies is both what redeems them and what marginalises them. Initially, Greek movie audiences were largely comprised of villagers who had moved to urban centers but who had maintained their rural mentality— cinema was introduced to Greece when urban culture was at its infancy and when populous cities such as Athens were still made up of distinct neighborhoods, or, as in Thessaloniki, of a mosaic of different groups. The mass of urban population was increased after 1922 with the influx of Anatolian refugees. After the Second World War and the Greek Civil War, mass migration towards urban centres completely transformed the demography of cities, thus creating the conditions for an urban and industrial culture. Only in the 1970s did the first generation with a truly urban upbringing and educated under a uniform education system become the target audience of film-makers. During the transition to the new urban mindset, the nouveaux riches of the lower middle class—the petit bourgeois—were the main viewers of Greek films. Consequently, their intellectual pretensions, “crass” sense of humor, and ideological fantasies shaped the dominant forms of representation for the largest part of film production. The tension between popular and creative cinema has always been and continues to be strong in Greek films, even though postmodernism has declared a convergence of high and popular artistic traditions through hybrid genres of representation based on the pastiche, the parodic and the interstitial.\n\nxi\n\nxii\n\nPreface Even in current times, with the permeation of everyday life by digital technology and the democratization of the film medium by the handheld camera, there is a distinct and almost deep cultural reluctance to proceed with a creative synthesis of both modes of production. For a prolonged period, the gap between the auteur and the director of popular movies only widened: a “good” movie remained a private vision while a “successful” one was considered a marketable generic commodity. Indeed, middle-ground movies attempting a synthesis of artistic risk and wide audience response were mostly absent. Because of the medium’s immense social effectiveness in a society tormented by political and institutional instability, the Greek state functioned either as the main sponsor of or the main obstacle to its development from its very inception. For decades, heavy taxation on the production of movies, a lack of protectionism, and the imposition of strict political control hindered the development of cinema as an independent and self-sufficient industry. From the late 1970s until the end of the 1980s, government took a friendlier, and ultimately more patronizing, approach to cinema. For almost 20 years, government seems to have functioned as the main or sole sponsor of all movies produced in the country—and the movies were spectacular failures with audiences, creating an unbridgeable gap between viewers and directors and finally, between filmgoers and the films themselves. It was a period that confirmed Paul Rotha’s adage that “the movie was rampant; the film was dormant!” After 1985, most Greek movies lost their commercial edge and became art-house films made exclusively for festivals and specialized venues. The old films, brimming with dazzling vivacity, passionate drama, and vernacular drollness, were either rejected or forgotten. A certain brand of elitism hijacked the dominant discourse of evaluating films, expressing through impenetrable and opaque idioms preconceived theories of vision, ideology, and film-making. Marxist, semiotic, and psychoanalytic approaches were used not for elucidating the submerged content of these “commercially successful” films but to exclude them from discussion and to isolate them in the oblivion of overspecialized academic studies. The obvious was the message, during this period of ideological frenzy, coinciding with Socialist Party rule. This state of affairs, however, could not have lasted for very long; the audiences simply disappeared and the system was no longer sustainable. Finally, the inevitable dominance of television gave the ultimate coup de grâce to the dying film industry. In the early 1990s, the practice of co-sponsorship came into operation. More recently, the practice of multiple sponsorships came into effect de facto and is still trying to find its institutional and legal framework within the state. During the last 20 years, international funding has been available, either through the European Union or through consortia with other European\n\nPreface or American companies, and has essentially liberated production from its imposed or self-imposed tutelage to the Greek state or the Greek media. The misadventure is not over yet, however. The ongoing financial meltdown has imposed heavy restrictions on new and emerging directors. In the early 1990s, such directors, after a traumatic act of emancipation, cut the umbilical cord with the great names of the auteur tradition, thereby reconfiguring a new visual idiom to depict a completely changed and radically reformed society. As Greece finds itself on the brink of financial collapse in 2011, many film-makers struggle hard to secure funding for their films and channels for their promotion—and the situation is still too fluid for any predictions to be made about the final outcome.\n\nIII During its century of life, Greek cinema has managed to produce both interesting and commercially viable works, some of which are of international significance and deserving of closer study. Unfortunately, few are known outside Greece and, on many occasions, Greek cinephiles, for various reasons. Still fewer studies have been dedicated to the exploration of its historical trajectory. Many articles, especially in electronic journals, have dealt mainly with specific Greek directors, the impact of their work, or more generally with the aesthetics of Greek cinematography. In English, there is only one brief history of Greek cinema—The Contemporary Greek Cinema by Mel Schuster—which was published in 1979 and which focuses on the New Greek Cinema as it was developing then. This history does not offer a thorough analysis of the presuppositions and historical circumstances underpinning the medium before that period. Although we must recognize the pioneering character of Schuster’s work, it is important to note that its historical scope gives a rather limited understanding of the evolution of cinema as an artistic and social medium in Greece. We must also mention the brief but extremely accurate observations by Mirella Georgiadou, in Peter Cowie’s A Concise History of Cinema (1971). Also important for mapping out approaches and new perspectives on Greek cinema is the special issue of the Journal of Modern Greek Studies, edited by Professor Stratos E. Constantinidis in 2000. A number of its contributors analyse different periods and important films, presenting a sophisticated and nuanced understanding of the problems of Greek cinema both as cinematic art and as social text. Dan Georgakas’ “Thumbnail History” of Greek cinema, as also his reviews of Greek movies in the journal Cineaste, is another valuable contribution to the discussion of Greek cinema history. With an international experience in mind, Georgakas evaluates Greek cinema in its interaction with society, industry, technology, audience, and, finally, in the context of\n\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\nPreface its specific contribution to the representation of Greek historical experience. Furthermore, he detects thematic threads and technical analogies that give to Greek movies artistic and ideological continuity in both style and storytelling. Recent studies by Lydia Papadimitriou have shed more light on a specific genre of Greek cinema: the musical, exploring it as a cultural product and emblem of specific social ideologies that was disseminated at particular historical moments. In Greek, the multi-volume History of Greek Cinema by Yannis Soldatos is invaluable because of its impressive command of the primary sources, hard-to-find reviews, and innumerable references, which bring together the most important discussions on the topic, showing the persistent themes that have dominated the production and appreciation of film in Greece. Soldatos’ history is a continuous labour of love, which, despite the somewhat intrusive passion of its writer, is of permanent importance. 100 Years of Greek and Foreign Cinema by Ninos Fenek-Mikelidis represents a more personal vision of Greek cinema by one of its most important reviewers. Also of particular interest is Marinos Kousoumidis’ Illustrated History of Greek Cinema, which ends in 1981 but which contains accurate information and a selection of crucial primary sources. The monumental two-volume edition Greek Cinema by Angelos Rouvas and Hristos Stathakopoulos is a solid and invaluable source of historical information. Finally, Aglaia Mitropoulou’s Greek Cinema, in spite of its very personal approach by one of the pioneers of film history, is extremely valuable for the detailed information it gives on many film-makers and the background of their work as well as for its aesthetic appraisals. Of all the Greek directors, the most popular among scholars has been Theo Angelopoulos, and the superb studies dedicated to him by Andrew Horton in particular, contain deep insights into the work of a film-maker whose significance has exceeded the limits of national cinema. Unfortunately, no studies in English have been made of other important Greek directors such as Michael Cacoyannis or Nikos Koundouros, or even of contemporaries who deserve international attention like Constantine Giannaris. Other brief histories in English, available mainly on the internet, are equally interesting, and indicative of specific approaches to the historical development of a peripheral European cinema. (The anonymous compiler of ‘History of Cinema in Greece’ at filmbirth.com should be commended for its succinctness and accuracy.) A serious shortcoming of histories written in Greek is that they tend to focus on detailed references to people and events of local interest, so the big picture of the evolution of cinema as art and social testimony is usually lost under particular circumstances and individual references, and sometimes even behind personal antipathy and bias.\n\nPreface For this book, I have endeavored to sift through material that is vast and still critically unexplored in order to present what reaches out, beyond the circumstantial or the episodic, to become (within the specificity of its historical situation) a symbol of a general trend, marking patterns of collective response. I have tried to locate the films that have directly or indirectly influenced the cultural and psychological topography of the country and to provide a brief commentary on their specific “social” value and formal structure—even when these movies were neither commercially successful nor seen by wide audiences. Given that this is a general survey, I have avoided detailed “cultural readings” based on the premises of academic film studies, as such approaches need to concentrate on specific movies, genres or individuals and through their very specificity to understand the wider cultural debates and political agendas that dominated the Greek public sphere in different moments of history. Having said this, there are also many occasions where I examine films’ implications, especially regarding gender, class, and cultural memory. I also try to emphasize the importance of foreigners, such as the founder of Greek cinema Josef Hepp, of women directors like Maria Plyta and of commercial directors like Yannis Dalianidis, who have been either forgotten or ignored. Finally, I have attempted to minimize my overall references, as most of these are in Greek and the bibliography in English quite limited. The issue of periodization is important. My initial intention was to divide the material into four periods: from the beginnings to 1944 with the liberation from German occupation, when the industry was reorganized and had established its own modes of production and exhibition; from 1945 to 1970 and the release of Theo Angelopoulos’ Reconstruction (1970), which reorientated cinematic practices, created new audiences and reinvented cinematic representation, marking the end of the Old Greek Cinema and the beginning of the New; from 1970 to 1995 when Angelopoulos released his monumental Balkan epic Ulysses’ Gaze (1995) as the breaking point of the Greek national cinema; and from 1995 to 2011, when a distinct new way of production, tentatively called the New Greek Current, started to emerge and produce its first works, which gained international recognition. In the end, however, I chose to break the history down decade by decade after 1945, as the immense number of films and the extensive debates surrounding them would have created an imbalance in narrative flow. This final arrangement accepts the establishment of the Thessaloniki Film Festival in 1960 and the election of the first Socialist Government in 1981 as equally important turning points in the history of Greek cinema. These two events reoriented production and promotion practices in the country and gave to this narrative the necessary temporal markers for a balanced chartering of the wider reconfigurations that occurred in film culture and the social realities surrounding them.\n\nxv\n\nxvi\n\nPreface Furthermore, since 1995 a wide variety of genres, diversified approaches and filmic representations has been made possible through the depiction not simply of the foreign immigrant, but also through the discovery of the perennial other that had existed within Greek society since its very establishment: the marginalized group, the religious other, the outcast, and the displaced or dissociative individual. During the last 20 years, new “cultural heroes,” such as the immigrant, the transvestite, and the masculinized feminine, have found representation—portrayals that indicate a deep crisis in the traditional values pertaining to masculinity, the vexed issue of “Greekness,” and women’s self-articulation. Certainly, we have to define what we mean exactly by “national Greek cinema.” As this history argues, Greek cinema and images about Greece were made by Greeks and non-Greeks alike; starting with the patriarch of local cinema, the Hungarian Josef Hepp and continuing after the war with the English Walter Lassally and the Italian Giovanni Varriano, it would be fairer to talk about the history of cinema in Greece instead of Greek cinema simply. The heterogeneity of the cinematic endeavor in the country provides a better understanding of the collective efforts to construct a local visual idiom and to create the perceptual strategies that connect it with the dominant traditions worldwide. Greek cinema was and still is a point of convergence, a space of colliding idioms, as expressed by Hollywood and European traditions. Being both at the same time, Greek audiences and critics alike love to hate Hollywood and hate to love European auteurism. Such a fundamental ambivalence can be seen throughout the development of Greek cinema, creating an emotional and intellectual tension which gives a distinct energy and power to many Greek films. On the other hand, “Greek cinema” and the expectations of international audiences were not determined by films made solely by directors of Greek origin or, indeed, for Greek audiences. The most internationally successful movies that defined the cinematic representation of Greece for public consumption were made by the American philhellene Jules Dassin. His Never on Sunday (1960) was particularly responsible for establishing the dominant international image of Greek cinema, a topic that deserves further exploration and discussion in separate studies. Even Michael Cacoyannis’ celebrated Zorba the Greek (1964) cannot really be seen as a purely “Greek movie.” The director notwithstanding, it is essentially an American movie, with an American production and distribution company, performed in English and with the international audience as its target. The main focus of this exploration is to foreground the cinematic works, the personalities and some of the discussions that critically reflected on how reality could or could not be depicted by the camera. It also addresses the question of whose reality is being depicted and for whom, since movie-making is a social event and an act of public intervention, involving\n\nPreface not isolated individuals but groups of people and mechanisms of industrial production—on many occasions, government-sponsored initiatives involving state apparatuses. Historical context is everywhere and sheds light on the production of each film. In this overview I try to outline the questions regarding history, cultural memory, and historical conscience implicitly depicted in each film by suggesting some provisional explanations about them within the wider context of local intellectual history and the history of ideas in Europe.\n\nIV Existing histories of Greek cinema, especially in Greek, tend to give a catalogue of titles in historical sequence. Yet, despite this concern with historical particulars, most fail to study the historicity of each movie within the cultural and aesthetic context of the intellectual milieu that produced it. Within their specific context, most movies are sites of cultural politics since they give form to the various historical contestations that dominate cultural or political debates. In some, the density of the filmic text is so complex that the films can be seen as indications not simply of a looming social crisis but as spaces of an unfolding visual crisis, as is clear for example between 1965 and 1967 and after 1984/85. In the most important films of Greek cinema, one can see precisely how negotiable the limits are between cinema as an artistic activity and cinema as a social institution. Many movies were made with both political and aesthetic concerns incorporated into their structure; and as the medium gained confidence in the late 1950s, an implicit dialogue commenced between the film-makers themselves in an attempt to consolidate a distinct cinematic idiom. It still remains to be discussed (though not in this book), if there is a distinctly Greek cinematic language or cinema that has never achieved full self-awareness and articulation. It is said that the most important film producer, Filopimin Finos, preferred to make a “good imitation of a Hollywood movie” rather than to produce a “bad Greek film.” Contemporary globalization brings such a dilemma to the fore again. Moreover, the intellectual establishment of the country had an ambivalent attitude towards the medium itself. Despite its popular appeal, many intellectuals were extremely reluctant, if not unwilling, to accept its artistic value—only in the late 1950s did intellectuals begin to articulate a positive appreciation of cinema, and always with many reservations. Cinema is one of the main arts of capitalist modernity and, as such, has presupposed on many occasions a radical break with the established practices of the past in terms of aesthetics, historical awareness, and self-articulation. Throughout its history, Greek culture has been a bookish tradition based on the word and the printed page rather than on the image and the\n\nxvii\n\nxviii\n\nPreface visual modality of perceiving reality. Many important intellectual Western texts were written in Greek and because of them (and the mythologies around their meanings), the Greek language is of cultural value and significance, something that has been emphasized by the ideology of the state. Language has been the most singularly important thread of continuity in Greek history from antiquity to today. The establishment of the Greek nation state in 1828 was based on the continuing memory that such privileged texts offered to the citizens of the new civil society who, after being socialized by the educational system, articulated their self-perception in terms of linguistic continuity with the culture of Homer, fifth-century Athens, and the Hellenistic, Byzantine, and Ottoman periods. Being Greek meant speaking Greek through a peculiar strategy of nation building, which was based on linguistic nationalism, consecrated by religious ceremonies or folkloric rituals and fiercely disseminated by the education system. However, cinema privileges the image and, even more so, the flowing images of the ephemeral and the temporary. The transition from a culture of the book to a culture of images, from a reading society to the society of the spectacle gives an extremely important anthropological content to cinematic art in Greece—something that could perhaps be extended to other countries of Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, such as Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey, or the Arab countries, which seem to have faced analogous cultural dilemmas regarding their past, identity, and contemporary physiognomy. This survey also addresses briefly some peculiarities of Greek cinema. For example, despite the internationally accepted image of Greece as the locus of an ancient Greek culture, Greek cinema has rarely dealt with its nation’s ancient past. We don’t have modern Greek cinematic representations of classical Greece. The main concern of most Greek movies has been the political question in contemporary Greek society. And the political question, of course, is associated with the history of the country and the ways in which Greek society dealt in times of war and peace with its own self-perception and cultural memory. The most important postulate for Greek film-makers has been the attempt to construct, invent, or compile an optical language that could visually articulate Greek society either as a coherent unity or as a palimpsest consisting of gaps, missing pages, and individual silences. Indeed, it took Greek film-makers a prolonged period of almost 30 years to piece together the morphemes for a visual grammar appropriate and equivalent to the complexities of Greek society. The transition from a non-perspectival culture—a culture outside the visual tradition of Western European art— to the modern visual regimes, based on space, volume, light, and shadow, generated not only technological but also stylistic problems. In the early years, cinema was a succession of tableaux vivants or a series of family portraits. Only after 1936 can we clearly see that Greek\n\nPreface cinematographers had abandoned the one-dimensional space of Byzantine iconography and had started exploring the potentialities of spatial depth, formal volume, and multiple stage arrangements. In the 1950s, a group of creative directors established an imaginative dialogue between the camera and the human form, thereby consolidating the visual language that permeates Greek cinematic representations to this day. It also took decades—not until after 1960—and many individual efforts and personal struggles for the Greek state to develop an interest in the industry, an interest undoubtedly encouraged by the fact that the ideological influence of cinema had by that stage become undeniable and its social impact uncontested. Cinema as an industry has served Greece as no other industry. For example, Cacoyannis’ Zorba the Greek has been the single most important trademark for exports, a “national” symbol that has instigated the local cultural industry through tourism and established “Greece” as a special place in the cultural imagination of the world. Cultural contextualization is crucial for the understanding of the development of Greek cinema. We must study the internal dialogue among directors, directors of photography, script writers, producers, actors, and, finally, of the audience itself in order to form a complete picture of the central physiognomy of Greek cinema. Some movies have generated more interest than others: as cultural artifacts, popular and generic movies are much more relevant to an understanding of the dominant taste, horizon of expectations, and collective pursuits than movies made by the singular vision or exclusive fascination of a particular individual. The old debate between genre and auteur is something that can be detected in Greece, as in many other cinematic traditions. When certain movies were screened, they elicited equally problematic emotions and reactions in their audience. Such films were either popular “soapies” based on the charisma of superstars such as Aliki Vouyouklaki, or works that expressed the artistic and political concerns of directors such as Nikos Koundouros, Takis Kanellopoulos, Theo Angelopoulos, Tonia Marketaki, and Stavros Tornes. The problem of representing the unstable realities of Greek society has been the pivotal point of departure for this account. Its main purpose is to explore and discuss the representation strategies established by a number of directors in order to depict the Greek experience and its cultural memory since the introduction of cinema into the country. We want to discuss the movies and artists who defined public taste, while at the same time connecting certain films with international trends, movements, and questions. Overall, this book focuses on films in which the depiction of Greek reality has assumed a special and even “irregular” form in an attempt to construct a visual pattern for the Greek experience—such films, regardless of their commercial success or failure, stand out by themselves.\n\nxix\n\nxx\n\nPreface This survey also briefly deals with the representations of “others” in Greek cinema (Roma, Jews, Americans, British, Turks, and so on), and finally examines movies that depict forms of sexual otherness and social marginalization as symbols of diversification and pluralism. While such movies were extremely rare in early periods of Greek cinema, they have proliferated recently as Greek society moves towards a more multinational and multicultural demography. Such films also chronicle the fluid and unstable realities that have emerged since 1991 and the influx of refugees from Balkan and Eastern European countries. On some occasions, I have attempted an anthropological conceptualization of Greek cinema, especially in relation to the modes of representation and the types of image it established in order to depict a society in constant fluidity and instability. Within such a society the issue of individual characterization has always remained crucial.With the exception of Theo Angelopoulos, who avoided any psychologization of individual existence, most film-makers tried to construct human types affected by the instability of their surrounding society, but have mostly failed in creating complete and believable characters. While commercial cinema depicted the stereotypical, conformist and adjustable “common man,” art cinema grappled with the psychological complexities and existential dilemmas of the internal exile and the social outcast, an enterprise that made such movies introspective, opaque, and, occasionally, self-indulgent. In its development, Greek cinema had to deal with the problem of constructing a visual language that would unlock the mystery of the human form and situate it within its historical local realities. The solution to this problem took decades to formulate and came about only after the creative imagination had succeeded in liberating itself from the traumas of historical experience. One can see the whole history of cinema in Greece as a visual antidote for the confusion and anxiety caused by such traumas; an attempt to bring balance and closure to the symptoms of post-traumatic helplessness that dominated a society in constant crisis over its present and future position in history.\n\nV Inevitably, in writing this history I have had to choose films which did not simply define Greek cinema history but which could also be of interest to an international audience. I have tried not to see Greek cinema as a battleground between commercial and art films but to present the formal complementarity of both modes of production. I have endeavored to talk about the merits and the problems that each genre depicts within its own context and, wherever possible, in reference to the artistic quest of their makers. There are chapters on what is called New Greek Cinema, as well as\n\nPreface chapters on propaganda, soft porn, or bad melodrama. They all illustrate the panorama of Greek film production and present through their own “gaze” different aspects of Greek history, culture, and society. Moreover, the fact that many “artistic” film-makers were involved in the production of commercial, popular culture films shows the implicit symbiotic relationship between high and popular culture and the invisible pathways of their convergence. In most cases, unfortunately, we do not have good digital copies of films produced between 1910 and 1980 (although recently a digitalization project has been inaugurated by the Greek Film Centre, EKK, and has been funded by the European Union and independent distributors). Still, many good films exist in bad prints and it would be of great assistance to the future historian of Greek cinema if the important task of digitalization were to be completed. Many films of the early period are considered lost; however, as recent research shows, many Greek films made between 1911 and 1945 have lain forgotten somewhere in the film archives of Berlin, Paris, London, and Moscow—for various reasons in each case. Let us hope that young researchers will try to salvage these lost treasures and reveal to contemporary viewers the difficulties that early Greek filmmakers confronted and so acclimatize the main art of modernity to the structures and mentalities of a traditional society on the periphery of Europe.\n\nA note on the transliteration of names and titles I followed the simplest phonetic transcription of Greek names as they are pronounced in the language: Yorgos instead of George (but Yeorgios for the archaic form of the name), Yannis instead of John. The translated titles of films in English are taken from Dimitris Koliodimos, The Greek Filmography: 1914 through 1996. I indicate wherever there is a difference of opinion. When a particular form of name has already been used in English (Theo Angelopoulos for example) I maintain that form. All translations from Greek are mine unless otherwise indicated. Sometimes, there are discrepant release dates for films. The screening season in Greece starts in October, so a film can be shown in the theaters in the following year, even if it was produced in the previous year. In most cases, I have followed the date given by Rouvas and Stathakopoulos, while in others I use the year of release.\n\nxxi\n\nAcknowledgments I a m deeply indebted to m any people for their assistance in the fruition of this project. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to my students of the Modern Greek Department at the University of Sydney for their personal response, unbiased approach, and “random” comments, which helped me to form a truly contemporary view, free of the allure of history and the sentimentalism of childhood experiences. Many thanks are also owed to my colleagues in the department: Dr. Anthony Dracopoulos for our inspiring and challenging conversations and Dr. Panayota Nazou for her encouragement and relentless criticism. A thank you must also go to my colleague in the European Cinema course, Professor Judith Keene, for her sensitivity and critical gaze. I am also indebted to my other colleagues at the University: Michelle Royer, Laleen Jayamanne, and Richard Smith, whose presence and ideas helped me to form my own approach to cinema. I am thankful to my friend Takis Katsabanis who insisted on being critical but always with love, since this is “our tradition.” To my sister Emily for her inspiring fighting spirit and my friend Ourania Lampsidou for her uncompromised modernity. Finally, to my friend and partner Robert Meader whose dislike of Theo Angelopoulos and the “auteur” tradition gave me a reality check. The support and encouragement from particular individuals who made a substantial contribution to the study of Greek cinema enabled me to access material and sources that were very hard to find; Nikos Theodosiou with his out-ofprint studies on the beginnings of Greek cinema and the culture surrounding the experience of going to the movies. My colleague Lydia Papadimitriou provided me with extremely helpful commentary after having read a draft of the first chapter. George Mitropoulos kindly sent to me from Greece books that are hard to obtain in the Antipodes. Dan Georgakas has been the single inspiring force behind the whole project, since the study of his work and political thinking gave me the capacity and strength to be lucid and unambiguous. I also feel a deep sense of gratitude to the anonymous seller of DVDs in a small shop in Piraeus who in two days found for me the rarest Greek movies, especially films made between 1930 and 1960, which I could not find in the most advanced research centers. There are no words to express my gratitude to Mr. Charles Humblet the educational designer of the School of Languages and Cultures at the University of Sydney. Without his technical assistance there would have been no photographs in this book, which, as we know, make every book worth reading.\n\nxxii\n\nAcknowledgments My colleague Cathy Cassis with her linguistic sensitivity edited the text so that it has a smooth narrative flow and a seamless structure of sentence. Cathy gave the text its necessary stylistic unity and expressive precision which in my own world of confused bilingualism never really exists. Finally, I am thankful to the editor of Continuum, Katie Gallof, who embraced the project with enthusiasm and humor from its very inception. This book is dedicated to the memory of my brother Nicholas who died unexpectedly several days after we were reconnected by an unexpected discussion on the significance of going to James Bond movies together.

The screenings took place nine months after the Lumière brothers officially patented their invention in Paris. At a central street in Athens and at a humble venue especially modified for the occasion, a strange inscription read: Cinematofotographe Edison. An anonymous reviewer wrote in the newspaper The City (To Asty): Carriages are travelling, horses are running, the sea is quietly moving, the wind is blowing, clothes are waving, trains are departing, Ms Loie Fuller is shaking and twisting like a colourful snake her paradoxical, unique and famous clothes, so that one thinks that they have before them living human beings, faces enlivened by blood, bodies pulsating with muscles. The illusion of life, in all its endless manifestations, parades in front of us. When it becomes possible to have a series of Greek images, of Athenian scenes and landscapes, the cintematofotograph will then excel, becoming an even more enjoyable spectacle. However, even as it stands, it presents one of the most astonishing inventions of science, one of the most fascinating discoveries; it is worth being watched by everybody and, certainly, they will all watch it and immerse themselves in its consummate phantasmagorias.1\n\nEvery day for a month, 16 screenings were offered until Alexandre Promio, the representative of the Lumière brothers, took the projector and the short films to Constantinople. All famous early films made by the Lumières were screened: L’ Arrivée d’un Train, La Sortie des Usines Lumière, Lyon les Cordeliers, Le goûter de bébé, and others. Despite their immense success, no special interest in film was shown in the Greek capital for over four years. Adverse and disastrous circumstances at the beginning of the following year quashed any curiosity or entrepreneurial interest in further exploring or 1\n\n2\n\nA History of Greek Cinema making use of the new invention. (The first screenings were organized in Thessaloniki, then under Ottoman rule, in July 1897; and, in July 1900, the first regular screenings were shown at the famous Orpheus theater on the thriving commercial island of Syros.) Indeed, the new art of cinema was the casualty of the political and social upheavals of Greek history. In order to establish itself and consolidate its presence, the medium needed political stability, social cohesion, and, of course, peace with other countries: essentially the preconditions for the establishment of technological infrastructure and the development of a sophisticated studio system that would allow for the emergence of film culture. Such preconditions were absent from Greek history until 1950. Prolonged periods of warfare (1912–1922), political instability (1922–1928 and 1932–1936), dictatorships, failed coups, and ultimately the German occupation followed by the Civil War (1946–1949) deferred for almost 50 years the smooth incorporation of the technological infrastructure and the conceptual framework that cinema as an industry and as an art needs to flourish. At the end of the nineteenth century, the nation state of Greece had a total population of about 2,500,000 people; another 3,000,000 Greeks lived outside the national borders, mainly in the Ottoman Empire, Russia and Egypt. Athens, the capital city, had an unremarkable population of 130,000 and competed with other established centers of Greek civilization, such as Constantinople, Smyrna, and Alexandria, for cultural and financial domination.2 The Greek economy was predominantly agricultural, although in the last decades of the century several programs of international investment were in place and the presence of the working class had become noticeable in the political and ideological debates of the country. In April 1896, Greece organized the first Olympic Games of the modern era. The success of the Games raised the hopes of the Greek people and the political establishment on many levels. However, by the end of 1897 the country experienced the effects of a humiliating bankruptcy, first announced in 1893 by the Prime Minister Charilaos Trikoupis (1832–1896) with one of the most memorable phrases of Greek political vocabulary: “Regretfully, we are bankrupt!” The bankruptcy was a long process and was the painful outcome of a combination of intense borrowing for infrastructure works, the systemic corruption of a state based on political clientelism, the organization of the Olympic Games, and, finally, of a humiliating military defeat by the Ottoman Empire in the so-called Black 1897 War. Nonetheless, against all odds, the movement for a social and political renaissance began during the first decade of the new century, when the country was forced to confront the dilemmas of modernity and proceed with its industrialization process, its rising working-class movement, and its unresolved territorial disputes with the collapsing Ottoman Empire (mainly in Crete and Macedonia). Programs of reform were gradually implemented by different\n\nEarly Greek Cinema: 1905–1945\n\ngovernments, starting in 1900 and culminating in the Goudi Uprising of 1908 when rebellious but ineffective officers demanded political concessions from the rather indolent and indifferent King George I of the Hellenes. In this political and social climate, the Psychoule Brothers from the city of Volos, Thessaly, introduced the first projection machine to Athens in 1899 at the Varieté theater behind what is today the site of the Old Parliament, screening short films, which they later took to the countryside. In 1900, other entrepreneurs, especially those from Smyrna or Alexandria, like Cleanthis Zahos and Apostolos Kontaratos, imported new projectors and installed them at the cafés surrounding Constitution Square between the Palace and the Parliament. Fierce competition broke out between the café proprietors for the premiere screening of the most recent French and Italian productions. The first movies, however, started being regularly screened at the industrial port of Piraeus by the Smyrnian businessman Yannis Synodinos. The initial session consisted of Edison’s The Battle of Mafeking and one of the great commercial successes of the day, Georges Méliès’ Cinderella. Other movies directed by Ferdinand Zecca and produced by Charles Pathé, such as Histoire d’un crime and Les Victimes de l’alcoolisme, became popular. Thanks to Pathé’s entrepreneurship, the tradition of Pathé-Journal with newsreels of actual events was to become the enduring legacy of early French cinema to Greek cinematography. After 1904, many cafés imported their own projectors, and the desire of their proprietors to attract greater audiences to their establishments only intensified the antagonism between them. A number of newsreels were taken during the Greek-Turkish war of 1897 by Frederic Villiers (1852–1922) and by Méliès himself (1861–1938)—these have to be the earliest film recordings on Greek territory3. An unknown American cameraman first filmed Athens in 1904. Later in the same year, an enigmatic French cameraman, named Leon (or Leons), who worked for Gaumont, Pathé’s great competitor, came to Athens to cover the mid-Olympiad of 1906 and filmed the games. His films were among the first existing visual records made on Greek territory. In 1907, an unknown cameraman made the first Greek journal, filming The Celebration of King George I. In 1908, a successful businessman from Smyrna, Evangelos Mavrodimakis, began to offer regular screenings of movies in the center of Athens, which had only just been supplied with electricity. On the central Stadiou Street he established the first movie theater, naming it the Theater of the World; he is considered to be the father of the Greek cinema venue. In these early days, each session usually consisted of a screening of eight short films, accompanied by a pianist, with improvised melodies, but later, whole orchestras were added together with popular singers. In early 1911, the first permanent cinema, Olympia (to be renamed later Capitole), was built in Piraeus by Yannis Synodinos, thereby inaugurating the material infrastructure for the expansion of cinema on Greek territory.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nA History of Greek Cinema It was not, however, until 1911/12, after the city of Athens was fully supplied with electricity, that three grand cinemas were specifically built to cater for the needs of the new art and its growing audience (Attikon, Pallas and Splendid). But open-air screenings retained their appeal for Athenian audiences, continuing the tradition of the open-air performances of the shadow theater of Karagiozis, which was for many decades the most popular form of public entertainment. In 1913, one of the most historic, almost legendary, cinemas opened in Athens, the Rosi-Clair, which was to screen the most popular films over a period of 50 years and which was finally closed down in 1969, under changed circumstances. In subsequent years, the famous Pantheon theater was established at the center of the city for the middle class, while the more humble Panorama was opened in a less-auspicious suburb for the underclass. By 1920, a network of six cinemas existed in the capital, together with open-air screenings that continued to be offered by a considerable number of cafés. Throughout the country, with the annexation of the city of Thessalonica in 1912 and the rest of Macedonia and the Aegean islands, an overall number of 80 cinemas were in operation by the end of the decade. During this period, due to the increasing demand for technological support, many foreigners were invited to Athens as cameramen, maintenance technicians, and projectionists. Some chose to stay. Among them, the German-Hungarian Josef Hepp (Giozef Chep, 1887–1968) worked relentlessly for decades to consolidate the new art form and should be recognized as one of the most prominent film-makers in the history of Greek cinema. Hepp was a man of artistic brilliance with a superb sense of style for mise-enscène, and his contribution is worthy of closer study. He arrived in Greece in early 1910, after an invitation from King George and bearing the conferred title of “Royal photographer and cinematographer.” His first film was the short journal From the Life of the Little Princes, which he shot in early 1911 with the King’s very many children and grandchildren. He later recollected: When I arrived in Greece, I fell in love with its lucid colors, its blue skies, the unembellished lines of its landscapes, but mostly with its people, their customs and way of living. I filmed them and I was the first who made images to represent Greece in other countries.4\n\nMeanwhile, in 1905 in Macedonia, the brothers Yannakis (Ioannis) (1878– 1954) and Miltiadis (1882–1964) Manaki recorded rural scenes from the life of ordinary villagers.5 They made a number of reels, which established the genre of ethnographic documentary in the Balkans, despite their disputed political agenda. Macedonia was a contested area that still belonged to the collapsing Ottoman Empire, but Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria aspired to annex it to their national territories. The Manaki brothers produced films that depicted the ethnic diversity of the region as well as the strange in-between minorities that had escaped\n\nEarly Greek Cinema: 1905–1945\n\nthe attention of the political rivals. These included work on the Aromanian Vlachs, Macedonian Slavs and the Romas. Christos Christodoulou has observed that, “The Manaki Brothers . . . recorded the Balkans at some of their most critical historical moments with both touching impartiality and a sense of documentary precision.”6 Within their work, films of special significance as the earliest visual records of an ethnographic nature from the region include Customs and Traditions of Macedonia (1906), The Visit of Sultan Mehmet V to Thessaloniki and Monastiri (1911), Turkish Prisoners (1912), Refugees (1916), and The Bombardment of Monastiri (1916). These early short reels are still very close to photographs; they are indeed moving pictures, and their photographic stillness can be detected in the decades to come as their enduring artistic legacy to Greek cinema. Miltos Manakis had some interesting ideas regarding photography: Photography is in essence an art form. We are artists/technicians of a sort, comparable to the painters of the past. They were not the only ones who could give beauty to what they painted; we do the same thing with our photographs. A good photograph depends on the play of light . . . And this is something only an artist can do, someone who knows what is attractive, divine and aesthetic . . .7\n\nManaki brothers, The Abvella Weavers (1905/6). Greek Film Archive Collection.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nA History of Greek Cinema Indeed, one can readily discern the continuity between still photographs and the cinematic representations in Greece and the Balkans at the time. Local artistic practices were based on the great, long, and venerable Byzantine tradition of religious iconography. The visual language of perspective that had dominated European painting since the Italian Renaissance was totally absent from the cultural optics of the country and, certainly, of the whole of Eastern Europe. The new tradition of painting, dominant in the late nineteenth century, was predominantly imported (it was even named the “Munich School”), and was still struggling to find its specific Greek expression and style. (It is interesting, however, that in his pioneer essay on cinema, Vachel Lindsay refers to the paintings of the main representative of the Munich School, Nickolas Gyzis, when he talks about “mood” in the cinematic image of Mary Pickford.)8 The face in Byzantine icons and frescos is self-illuminated, without shades or shadows; and space is depicted symbolically not “realistically” or “naturalistically.” That which interests the Byzantine tradition more is not the story but the “organization of space” and how the viewer experiences its “psychic content.” Its point of view is located within the iconographic space and through the special pictorial practice called “inverse perspective,” according to which the image and each of its components gaze at the viewer and not the viewer at the image.9 Similarly, the camera works with the interplay between light and dark, and with space, in a realistic, photographic sense by juxtaposing patterns, shapes, and forms in order to generate emotions through visual contrasts. The struggle to create depth, to explore natural space, and to understand perspective as the contrast between grades of black and white are visible throughout the early period of Greek cinema and were to be resolved only after the Second World War. Because of its specific iconographic sources and the prevailing visual cultures formed by shadow theater or folk painting, Greek cinema could not embark on the production of large historical epics as in Italy by Enrico Guazzone or Giovanni Pastrone. From its very beginnings, it focused on small-scale productions whose principal objective was to supplant the existing modes and genres of popular entertainment. The documentaries of the Maniaki Brothers do not belong to a single national cinema. They constitute the “primary foundational texts” of the whole cinematography that was to evolve with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. The lives of the two brothers are equally telling. One died poor and unknown in Thessalonica in 1954, while the other was celebrated as a national hero in Yugoslavia, with each of them opting for a different motherland, a different identity, and a different culture.10 In 1910/11, after the first recording camera was imported into the country, a number of short films on the lives of insects and reptiles were\n\nEarly Greek Cinema: 1905–1945\n\nmade by Harilaos Mavrodimakis, the first scientific documentaries to be produced in Greece. In 1912, Josef Hepp made two more short films on the life of the royal family, during the period of great optimism that followed the election of the new dynamic Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who was to play a crucial role in the development of cinema in the country, especially after 1928. Meanwhile, foreign films were extremely successful. Among them were The Crowning of the Tsar, Faust, The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ made by Louis Lumière; The Great Train Robbery by Edwin S. Porter; and Cinderella, The Dreyfus Affair and Journey to the Moon by Georges Méliès. These were so popular that they soon inspired local productions.\n\nProduction Begins In 1910, the first production company, Athene Films, made a number of slapstick comedies, which focused on the body of Spyros Dimitrakopoulos, aka, Spyridion, the owner of the company. His movies were filmed by imported technicians and were directed by the Italian Filippo Martelli. Spyridion modeled his acting on the American Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle and his film Ben’s Kid (1909), which Spyridion had watched in Paris. His cameraman was Erich Bumbach from Germany who was also to play a crucial role in the early period of Greek cinema. Spyridion himself was the scriptwriter, actor, producer and distributor. Spyridion, Quo Vadis (1911); Spyridion, Baby (1912); and Spyridion, Chameleon (1912) were comic skits based on the physical peculiarities of the actor, and his resemblance to the American comedian. They gained wide popularity throughout the country, since by then the number of cinemas had proliferated in many major cities, such as Piraeus, Patras, Volos, and Pyrgos. Unfortunately, none of these movies survive except in stills. Dimitrakopoulos himself was extremely aware of what he called the “demands of the screen.” In a sense, he was the pioneer of screen acting and managed to avoid one of the main disadvantages of most actors in the early period of Greek cinema: theatricality. In an interview in 1924, he recollected: I watched all movies and studied carefully the movements of screen actors, analyzing them, understanding their psychology and trying to find what I was missing, in order to add it. I also studied the ways in which directors arrange things on the screen and only when I became assured that I could pose in front of the camera, did I star in Quo Vadis and my other films.11\n\nDuring these early years, Josef Hepp was the dominant figure, having by then become the Palace’s favorite cinematographer and, at the same time, the highest-paid professional in the country. He documented the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), the entrance of the Greek army into Thessalonica,\n\n7\n\n8\n\nA History of Greek Cinema and the defeat of the Bulgarian army. Meanwhile, he mentored his first student, Gabriel Loggos (1885–?), who would later make the earliest existing documentary on the criminal world of Athens by hiding the camera in places where the underworld people met—this was also the first attempt at creative script-free film-making. In 1914/15, the folk-costume rural drama Golfo was produced by Costas Behatoros in collaboration with Filippo Martelli, as the first feature film made in the country. Golfo, at 79 minutes, was a costly production (100,000 drachmas, an immense amount for the time) and inaugurated the characteristic genre of bucolic fustanella dramas, which maintained its appeal for many decades through its idealization of rural space and the pre-urban time of communal village innocence. Its story was derived from a popular love idyll in traditional rhyming verse written for the theater by Spyridon Peresiadis in 1893. However, beyond the ethnographic appeal of the story’s setting, were the themes of forced marriage and the position of women in society, especially poor women, and always according to the prevailing patriarchal imaginary. Its tragic conclusion, although somewhat primitive, was quite an emphatic critique of class distinctions and masculine mentality, as it ends with the implied message that every man has sacrificed a woman for his position and success. Stylistically, because of Martelli, it was very close to Italian films of the period, particularly those before the historical epics, which revolved around folk heroes. The actors were all from the theater, with the most prominent among them being Virginia Diamante (1896–1948) and Olympia Damaskou (1878–?), and it seems that their very theatricality contributed to the film’s failure at the box office. Despite this failure, as Dan Georgakas has noted, “the storyline continually intrigued Greek film-makers. A 1932 remake would be the first Greek talking picture. In 1955, there would be three more remakes, one being extremely successful and in 1974, Angelopoulos would feature the play as a central theme in The Travelling Players.”12 Behatoros left for Paris in 1916 and was lost to Greek cinema, as it seems was his fortune, after the failure of the film. Unfortunately, as early as 1931 the film was considered lost. The political unrest of the period, starting with the Balkan Wars and culminating in the tragic National Division (1916–1917), created a precarious environment for the consolidation of the new art form. In 1915, the first attempt to adapt a novel to cinema came with Constantinos Hristomanos’ The Wax Doll (I Kerenia Koukla) by Mihael Glytsos, the second feature film in the country; despite the money invested in the film, it had no commercial success and received vitriolic reviews. However, it is worth pointing out that these early feature films established a gendered visual discourse and took the feminine predicament as the foundation of cinematic language. Golfo was set in the\n\nEarly Greek Cinema: 1905–1945\n\nvillage and The Wax Doll in the city, but in both cases the feminine presence was used as a gendered category, which, irrespective of space, embodied the socio-cultural tensions that prevailed in the public domain of the country. Screen adaptations of literary works caused quite a stir in the circles of an intelligentsia that privileged the culture of the word as the focal element of Greek tradition. On the basis of this film, a prominent intellectual of the period, Fotos Politis (1890–1934), denounced the new art as “a real plague, an artless wound, a superficial spectacle, not different from that of horse racing, which alienates people from the emotions of genuine art.”13 Politis changed his verdict much later, in the early 1930s, when sound was introduced and he saw cinema as potentially the “eighth art,” equal, if not superior, to theater. In 1916/17, Josef Hepp, with the financial assistance of supporters like Yorgos Prokopiou, established Asty Films but never completed their planned movie on The Passion of Jesus (O Aniforos tou Golgotha). Hepp introduced an important innovation then by devising a mechanism of his own to introduce inserts in Greek during a screening. He also managed to film one of the most notorious events in Greek history, the official “Anathema” of the Greek Orthodox Church against Prime Minister Venizelos in December 1916—this was the first political film ever made in the country and tainted Hepp’s reputation. The documentary was indeed just as extraordinary as the event itself—it didn’t escape the attention and reproach of the prominent British ethnographer Sir James George Frazer who saw in it “the indestructibility of superstition.” “In Europe,” he concluded, “such mummeries only contribute to the public hilarity, and bring the Church which parades them into contempt.”14 One year later, Dimos Vratsanos and Josef Hepp produced another drama, directed by Martelli, The Fate of Maroula (or, The Dowry of Annoula). Soon after, another company, the Anglo-Hellenic Company, which was established for the production and distribution of films owned by wealthy Greeks from Cape Town, South Africa, bought Hepp’s company following its huge financial losses. Yet their plans to build proper studios never materialized: the political instability of the period influenced Greek cinema production system in deeply adverse ways and compelled film-makers to make movies only in the open air and to shoot only on location. Meanwhile, Hepp’s films were confiscated and he was subsequently exiled to the islands of Skyros and Icaria for political reasons. (The government accused him of being a staunch royalist and pro-German, which he was.) His treatment prefigured what was to happen to other film-makers in the future. After King Constantine was deposed by French and British intervention in 1916/17, Greece, under the leadership of Eleftherios Venizelos, participated in the last phase of the First World War with the Allies; the war effort on many fronts was intense and film production ceased for two or three years,\n\n9\n\n10\n\nA History of Greek Cinema with the existing cameras used exclusively to record battles in Asia Minor, mainly, as we will see, by the Gaziadis brothers, whose father, Anastasios, was one of the greatest pioneers of art photography in the country.15 For its participation, Greece was rewarded at the Peace Conference in Paris (1919) with territorial gains in eastern Thrace and the area around Smyrna in Asia Minor. After the Conference, the pro-Western Prime Minister Venizelos proceeded with two controversial moves: first, he sent Greek troops to Smyrna, and second, he declared elections in order to renew his mandate by the people. Despite the celebrations after the landing of the Greek army in Smyrna, it soon became apparent that the situation was more complex than anticipated, with many international powers and interests involved. At the same time, the influence of Turkish nationalism and its charismatic leader Mustafa Kemal had been simplistically and fatally underestimated. Furthermore, in an extraordinary twist of history, Venizelos lost the September 1920 election. Consequently, the Western Allies abandoned Greece’s new royalist government which had sided with the Germans during the war and which had now restored the deposed King Constantine to power. After that, all Greek military involvement in Asia Minor was unsustainable and was indeed to end with a major catastrophe in August 1922. Smyrna—a city with a substantial Greek population for centuries—and the entire Asia Minor coastline were evacuated by all its Greek inhabitants in a forced exchange of populations that culminated in hundreds of thousands of casualties and more than 1,800,000 refugees. These displaced people flooded Greece and created a massive social problem that was to dominate the socio-political landscape of the country for many decades. Psychologically, the Asia Minor Catastrophe still remains the most traumatic event in modern Greek history. Its presence can be felt either implicitly or explicitly as the anxiety substratum of most Greek films, indeed of all cultural production, to this day. The fear of expulsion and of losing contact with one’s historic origins, imagined or real, can be detected in most Greek movies, and in most art forms of mainstream production, as a deep-seated anxiety, expressed on many occasions through a panic-stricken affirmation of national and personal identity. The only thing that remained intact after such great loss was the “unchanged” essence of “Greekness,” associated either with “racial” and “cultural” continuity or, in other instances, with the spirit of resistance and rebellion. Thematically, however, it was a trauma that was not effectively confronted and healed in the public arena for almost half a century; and consequently it caused a prolonged crisis of individual identity, confusion in cultural orientation, and finally, distrust towards the political system responsible for it. Even today, in order to affirm Greek identity and address the need for legitimacy and justification in contemporary adverse realities, most public\n\nEarly Greek Cinema: 1905–1945\n\nintellectuals revert to pre-Greek state notions, such as the “purity” of the Orthodox faith, the “authenticity” of pre-modern life in the villages, or the glory of classical Greece. It is undeniable that the whole political establishment of the country was involved in the erroneous planning and the delusory execution of the Asia Minor campaign. Yet no one from either the political powers that had supported the campaign or from the high military officers was ever held accountable for the Catastrophe. Six officials, among them the former prime minister, Dimitrios Younaris, and five of his ministers, were executed under the fabricated accusation of “national treason,” as scapegoats for the monumental disaster—an act that only exacerbated the public feeling that the ruling elite was covering up the whole affair. (It is interesting that in 2009, when one of the descendants of the executed officials requested a re-examination of the trial, the Supreme Court declared all six innocent in closed-door proceedings—to ensure that state secrets would still not be revealed 80 years later!) During this period of crisis and collapse, many important film-makers, like Yorgos Prokopiou (1876–1940) and Gabriel Loggos, were filming the Asia Minor campaign (and their reels remain unique visual testimonies of the war effort; these were to be used quite extensively by successive generations of Greek cinematographers as parts of their films or documentaries). Nonetheless, several films were made during the ensuing period of chaos. A personality of special significance also emerged, Dimos Vratsanos (1873– 1944). Vratsanos was one of the associates who had helped Hepp to establish Asty Films; and by 1920 he was the first intellectual to take cinema seriously, establishing a private school for cinema acting. Meanwhile, the first Greek film reviews were published in Illustrated (Eikonografimeni), a journal founded by Vratsanos in 1904 and which was published sporadically until 1936. Furthermore, Vratsanos was the producer and Hepp the director of the hilarious comedy Villar in the Women’s Baths of Faliron (O Bilar sta Ginaikeia Loutra tou Falirou, 1920), which introduced Villar as the most successful comedian of the day. (His real name was Nikolas Sfakianos or Sfakianakis.) Twenty-six whole minutes from his second film The Adventures of Villar (Oi Peripeteies tou Bilar, 1926) have survived and were restored recently, making it the first Greek feature film to exist almost in its entirety. Villar was influenced by the American musicals of the period but more obviously by the “King of Comedy,” Mack Sennett, and especially by his productions involving chase gags and bathing beauties—and he faithfully followed Sennett’s axiom: “We have no scenario . . . the chase is the essence of our comedy.” Yet, as he was running up and down central Athens, his film offered a distinct depiction of the city, its main roads, people and landscape. Also, its subtle humor and its attempt to create a “comedy of manners” make this early film worth watching to this day.\n\n11\n\n12\n\nA History of Greek Cinema Another comedian of the period, Michael Michael of Michael (1895– 1944), also became very popular; his unscripted and director-less films earned him the nickname of the Greek Charlie Chaplin, and his personality gave rise to the first form of “media star” in the country. Between 1923 and 1925, he released five movies with Hepp as his principal cameraman—very few scenes survive from The Wedding of Michael and Concetta (O Gamos tou Mihail kai tis Kontsetas, 1923), Michael is Completely Broke (O Mihail den Ehei Psila, 1923) and Michael’s Dream (To Oneiro tou Mihail, 1923). The commercial success of these films also helped to establish the career of another important comedian in this early period, Ahilleas Madras (1875– 1966), whose movies, despite their shortcomings, can be seen as major social documents in a changing society, as well as filmic texts within a new understanding of cinema as cultural industry. A cosmopolitan wanderer, Madras made a number of interesting movies in a heroic attempt to tell a continuous story while desperately struggling with the camera in new angles, frame devices and perspectives. Most of his films have no script, no stable sets, and feature actors who could not act—with Madras the most prominent among them. His documentary The Refugees of the War (Oi Prosfyges tou Polemou, 1920/21), however, was immensely successful in the Greek diaspora of the United States and brought him considerable profits, which he used to fund\n\nMichael Michael, The Marriage of Michael and Concetta (1923).

They were failed, sometimes ridiculous, but bold and creative experiments with the medium. Maria Pentagiotissa, which survives in two versions (silent and talking), is an extraordinary film that is totally inaccurate, completely improbable and, despite its dramatically patriotic nature, extremely funny. It was aptly advertised as: “Maria Pentagiotissa is not a colossus! Not a 42mm Canon! Not a super–colossus! Not the miracle of the century! Not a superproduction! Not the first Greek movie! Not a Superfilm! Not an experiment! It is LOCAL STUFF!” The scene in which Maria, the Greek Calamity Jane, is fighting against the enemies of the nation up in rugged mountains and in spectacularly high heels, has been parodied endlessly by subsequent comedians. In the talking version, Madras impersonates the priest who christens Maria, reading the archaic liturgical texts with a perfect French accent! Madras’ last movie, The Wizard of Athens, which was a re-edited version of his first, showed a distinct search for continuous parallel storylines with many improbable twists and turns, and is deserving of closer study. Despite\n\nAhilleas Madras, Maria Pentagiotissa (1928/9).

Despite their shortcomings, Madras’ films are interesting because they were constantly reworked by him in a way that makes the existing filmic text a palimpsest of different layers of stories, added progressively over each other, as the director improved his skills in representation, script and technical know-how. In 1923, Hepp released his poignant documentary The Exchange of Captives in Asia Minor, one of the most tragic documents of the Asia Minor Catastrophe. In the same year, Michael Dorizas, a visiting Greek-American professor from Philadelphia, produced his pioneering short documentary Meteora about the monasteries perched on tall rocks in the center of Greece. In 1924/25, Dimos Vratsanos filmed the sumptuous melodrama The Reject Child of Destiny (Tis Moiras to Apopaidi), which became so successful in Athens (it\n\nAhilleas Madras, The Magician of Athens (1931).

By then, other cities, such as Patras and Thessaloniki, had set up their own studios and produced movies such as the Revolution of 1821 (I Epanastasis tou 1821, 1926). Other cities followed. Three comedies were made in the city of Drama in Greek Macedonia. In 1927, the strange attempt to acclimatize Charlie Chaplin in Greece continued with Anastasios Kefalas’ Charlie Chaplin, Arch Bandit in Arachova (O Sarlo Arhilistis stin Arahova). The film starred Kimon Spathopoulos, (1903–1989), who had just arrived from Paris, and highlighted the fact that a creative dialogue between local industry and the Hollywood tradition had already been established. Stathopoulos would later become one of the most important make-up artists for many Greek movies until the 1980s.\n\nOrganization and Challenges A turning point in the history of early Greek cinema came in 1927 with the establishment of Dag Films, the first systematized production company. Dag Films was founded by the Gaziadis brothers, who carried on the tradition of their father Anastasios, one of the most brilliant and innovative artistic photographers of the previous decades. Initially, the company made documentaries and journals as it had been doing since 1923; it also functioned as a distribution agency for imported films. In 1927, the Gaziadis brothers decided to transform it into a production company for feature films. In 1928, Dag Films established its own cinema school in order to mentor new actors and directors. The brothers’ background in photojournalism gave a distinct character to their films, making them moving images with strong black and white contrasts, and some brownish with deep-blue nuances. The austere photographic immobility of the camera itself remained initially but as the brothers gained experience in filming, it became possible to dispense with it entirely and to transform the camera eye into an active and meaningful participant in the cinematic experience. The Gaziadis brothers, Dimitris (1897–1961), Kostas (1899–1970) and Mihalis (1905–?) became the D. W. Griffiths of Greece in their attempt to establish a distinctly “national” cinematic style of storytelling through a unified stylistic presentation. Dimitris usually served as director of their films, Mihalis as cinematographer, and Kostas as editor. The brothers thought that their desired “national” style of film-making could be achieved by intercutting clips of documentaries into the storyline of the film, which was shot on location. In their persistent attempts to construct a grand visual narrative for the nation, they favored prolonged shots of the Greek landscape, having as their main opponent the strong and anti-cinematic glare of the sun, which hindered the depiction of inner conflicts and implied\n\n15\n\n16\n\nA History of Greek Cinema emotions; instead, actors had to pantomime their role in order to make its feelings understood by the audience. Dimitris Gaziadis’ unrealized master work The Greek Miracle (To Elliniko Thauma, 1922) was envisaged as immortalizing the recapture of Asia Minor, although using an all-Russian cast. The film was never completed, except in fragmented reels from the actual battles, which Gaziadis himself had filmed, especially the battles at the Sangarios River and in the city of Smyrna shortly before its disastrous fire.17 The devastating defeat of the Greek army forced him to substitute triumphalist narratives and national myths of military and patriotic glory with short and private folk stories of consolation, in an effort to compensate for the trauma of actual events and the death of the “Great Idea” of restoring imperial Byzantium which had dominated Greek politics for a long period. Dag Films’ first foray towards a systematic production was The Delphic Celebrations (Oi Delfikes Eortes, 1927), a pioneering cinematic effort to film ancient Greek tragedy in its natural space and on location. The celebrations were organized by the renowned poet Angelos Sikelianos and his wealthy American wife Eva Palmer and attracted international attention as the first attempt after antiquity to revive tragedy in its traditional environment. The filming was made in collaboration with the brilliant director of photography Dimitris Meravidis (1895–?), who had studied with the Lumière brothers in Paris. Despite their meagre technical means, Meravidis and Gaziadis managed to move the camera horizontally and to create visual effects similar to those on ancient Greek vases—one-dimensional figures in stylized gestures moving in linear sequence and foregrounding the character of ancient tragedy as sacred initiation. Their camera moved between deep-focus photography, longmedium shots and close-ups, alternating with shots of the depthless landscape and stressing the timelessness of tragic performance, the ritualistic slowness of the chorus, and the expressionless neutrality of the dramatic mask. Dimitris Gaziadis had worked with Ernst Lubitsch and Fritz Lang in Germany while his brother Mihalis had worked in Hollywood with Lubitsch\n\nGaziadis and Meravidis, The Delphic Celebrations (1927).

In Dimitris’ most important works, we can clearly see both the influence of German expressionism and the allure of American narrative cinema in a successful fusion. The brothers tried to produce feature films with a continuous narrative story while using the camera to establish a single directorial point of view. Between 1927 and 1929 they produced three movies with uneven results and their final failure determined the fate of early Greek cinema and of silent movies in the country. Love and Waves (Eros kai Kymata, 1928) was a huge commercial success with 40,000 tickets sold in Athens alone. It was released in January 1928 and its unprecedented appeal raised hopes that good local productions were possible. Despite the negative response by critics, with this film Gaziadis introduced the visual grammar for popular movies that was to become dominant (especially in melodramas) for many decades. Importantantly for the period, Gaziadis used slow motion for the first time in order to enhance the emotive response of the audience. His second film, The Harbor of Tears (To Limani ton Dakrion, 1929) introduced actors who were to dominate the screen for the next 30 years. Both movies were honest, but essentially inadequate attempts to create continuous narrative cinema. The linear sequence of visual images in the second film was somehow slowed down. This slowness was deliberate, a means of concealing gaps in the script or disguising the extreme theatricality of the actors. The scenes followed the pattern of still photographs; they simply moved in succession since the actors remained still in front of a fixed camera. Furthermore, the actors were crammed together in the very confined space of a small studio, thus restricting their movement and making their performances self-conscious. Yet some spectacular shots by Gaziadis, especially of a storm around a lighthouse, were commended strongly by critics and were subsequently imitated by other cinematographers. The Harbor of Tears was about the Athenian underworld of smugglers, drug dealers, addicts, and petty thieves. It too was an immediate commercial success. The camera followed a number of characters without really creating a central story or identifying main protagonists. The critic Iris Skarabaiou pointed out that the movie was “a doubtful mixture of many episodes, and that confuses the plot asking for a deus ex machina to offer a favorable and yet improbable solution.”18 The movie also introduced a new representation of figures of the urban underworld as antiheroes, as victims of a social order beyond their grasp and control—a theme that was to dominate the melodramas of the 1950s and 1960s. In his next movie Astero (1929), Dimitris Gaziadis added dramatic intensity to the movement of the camera and made the audience “come into the movie itself.” For the first time, the camera seemed to change angle and follow the action, inviting the viewer to engage in a dialogue with what was happening on the screen. In this film, the camera empathizes with the actors and draws the viewer into the frame as an active participant rather than an\n\n17\n\n18\n\nA History of Greek Cinema indiscreet observer of an irrelevant story. Gaziadis seems to have understood that the camera is not simply the eye of the director, but the eye of the viewer. So, he moves along a horizontal axis, but in an ingenious and inventive way. There is an excellent scene where the camera rests on the head of a dog as it is barking over the dead body of its master: the camera rotates around the mountainous landscape, giving the audience the immediate sensation of an endless immensity of space and the human helplessness within it. The landscape acts as a megaphone to amplify the dog’s barking, as though nature is echoing the pain of human tragedy. In another scene, Gaziadis depicts the madness of Astero by shaking the camera and producing blurry, unstable, and indistinguishable pictures. Astero also introduced a new plot device—the happy ending—as the emotional closure to a story. Gaziadis’ movie consolidated the visual syntax and the framing devices that were to become an integral part of plot and representation in subsequent Greek cinema, especially in the genre of melodrama. The film could have been the first masterpiece of Greek cinema if Gaziadis had managed to work effectively with his actors: while the landscape and the story evoke an\n\nDimitris Gaziadis, Astero (1929). Greek Film Archive Collection.\n\nEarly Greek Cinema: 1905–1945\n\natmosphere of love and betrayal, most of the characters over-act and undermine the director’s attempts to create a distinct psychological aura around them. Also, Gaziadis avoided confronting or criticizing the patriarchal morality or the dominant conventions surrounding the representation of women. Set in the “innocent” landscape of a traditional village, which formed an organic continuity with the natural landscape, the film idealized an already lost way of living. Nevertheless, through the nostalgic recreation of an innocence lost and an authenticity sought after by the urban masses, Gaziadis implicitly criticized roles and institutions, which after the Asia Minor Catastrophe, had lost their legitimacy and moral authority. Greek “authentic” life was not a matter for the present but a thing of the past: Astero can be seen as a narrative of consolation set against the background of cities filled with refugees living in abject poverty. At the same time, Gaziadis constructed a gendered discourse for the nation, representing women as the most solid and steadfast core of moral probity, endurance, and stability. On this film, Gaziadis collaborated with Pavlos Nirvanas (1886–1937), one of the most well-known public intellectuals and popular writers of the period. Nirvanas wrote the scripts for both Astero and The Storm. In an interesting article which pointed out the urgent quest for good scripts, he noted that as screenwriter he had to obey conventions, write platitudes and satisfy the expectations of the audience by producing a movie “full of Greekness”: If it was successful, we would be able to prove that Greece was capable of establishing its own cinematic art and consequently a very significant national industry . . . Among so many concessions and compromises, I also had to deal with an art that follows convention, and my constant concern from the beginning till the end was: how the characters in the cine-drama were to be Greek, to feel Greek, to behave Greek, to speak Greek, even to fall in love—the great barrier of the screen—in a Greek way. Moreover, in moving within the environment of rural people, how was I to avoid the vulgarity into which there was always the danger of falling? I wanted to avoid vulgarity not by ennobling, through false devices, characters and situations, but by revealing in the depths of their souls genuine nobility, the same Greek nobility that found its most brilliant manifestation in our folk songs.19\n\nNirvanas’ testimony highlights another aspect of this project regarding the noble villager; its origins can be located in the cultural fantasies of the Athenian urban elite with respect to the countryside and its inhabitants. After the destruction of other cultural centers, Athens imposed a hegemonic view of Greek rural lands as a single homogeneous space with distinct ethical values, endurance, obedience, and respect for tradition by becoming the site which evaluated and privileged its “authentic” character. During Astero’s screening, songs were played on a gramophone in order to enhance the film’s emotional impact. Its achievement was extraordinary;\n\n19\n\n20\n\nA History of Greek Cinema 80,000 people saw it in the first week after its release. It was also screened regularly afterwards with such enormous success that a remake with sound was attempted in 1944.20 Although Gaziadis introduced the Hollywood practice of emotional empathy with the characters, he avoided introducing the star system that had started to dominate the studio system in the United States and which had to wait until the 1950s to be consolidated. Gaziadis achieved a more artistic effect with The Storm (I Bora, 1930). With occasional stylistic boldness reminiscent of German expressionism, he employed fading shots, intense close-ups, and soft focus to create an atmosphere of psychological tension and collective anxiety. In this strange film, he also entwined reels of the war in Asia Minor with scenes of a gripping human drama in order to reconstruct states of mind and to provide a continuous narrative sequence. But the film remained fragmented. Iris Skarabaiou notes that the actual reels were irrelevant to the story and were there simply because there was no script—which was only partly true. She also points out that, “the nightmare of the first shot” terrified most of the actors and so the film remained incomplete and disconnected.21 With Gaziadis’ movies, modern urban melodrama was born in Greece, while at the same time the predicament of refugees, of the poor and the dispossessed received its first visual representation. Despite technical difficulties, the Gaziadis brothers established the tradition in Greek cinema of intermingling actual events with fictional ones. After the failure of their artistic projects in 1932, however, the brothers produced only documentaries on current events, and here their camera recorded some of the most critical events of the 1930s. The success of the first organized film company gave birth to a competitor, Olympia Films (while Ahilleas Madras had established his own production company, Ajax Films, and another company Hellas Films appeared in 1930 with more being added during the 1930s, such as Nilo Films, Acropol Films, Astro Films, Foivos Films). The advent of talking pictures sparked intense competition between Dag Films and Olympia Films. Olympia Films produced its first film, Away from the World (Makria apo ton Kosmo, 1929), with the German cinematographer Erich Bumbach exploring the landscapes of Corfu and Mount Athos (unable as all companies were at the time to build their own studios). It was with this company that Josef Hepp made his first attempts to devise his own sound recording system, producing two short films in the process with a system of his own invention. Meanwhile, the challenges of the absence of organized studios and of confronting the rise of talking pictures were exacerbated by the policies adapted by the Greek state against the new medium. The historical context of this rivalry is very important to the development of cinema in Greece. The Asia Minor Catastrophe had been followed by the declaration of the\n\nEarly Greek Cinema: 1905–1945\n\nFirst Greek Republic in April 1924. The Republic, supported by liberal army officers and ambitious generals, did not last long. One of them, General Pangalos, introduced the first legislation restricting the freedom of film-makers. Beginning in 1927, every kind of filming of public events required special permission from the police; furthermore, permission was not granted unless there was a detailed account of how the material was to be used. At the same time, the first strict rules about public conduct at the cinema were passed by the national legislature. Specific guidelines were introduced regarding behavior, dress codes, and the exclusion of minors. The age limit was determined to be 15 (rather than 18 or 21 as in other European countries), especially as the legislation stipulated “if the screened films were depicting criminal or erotic representations with provocative scenes . . .” The suspicion towards the new medium was expressed through public denouncements on the grounds of its promoting criminality, corruption, promiscuity, and immorality. In 1930, legislation defined as “proper” all those films “that have as their content the elevation of virtues, family values, love, maternal affection, and which inspire activity, positive spirit, kindness, and courage.” One of the main elements in police character profiling for petty criminals at that time was that, “during the interrogation it was revealed that the suspect was frequenting popular cinemas.” Such suspicions were also extended to the film-makers themselves, imposing upon them strict instructions about the “moral content” of their work, while at the same time allowing a police officer to inspect behavior at the movie theater during the screening.
