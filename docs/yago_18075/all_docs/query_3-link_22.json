        "text": "‘White City’, Christian’s documentary commissioned by the Greek National Tourism Organisation, emphasises thebright sun and the bright marble so as to rebrand the Greek capital as a modern tourist utopia. The cinematic portrayal of modern Athens in touristic films offers a rich cultural database for drawing conclusions about film-induced tourism and city branding policies for the metropolis of the future. Investigating the processes involved in reinventing identities for historical cities, via the moving image, for the tourist, lies at the very heart of this paper’s aims. This analysis proposes a toolkit for tracing transformations that have to do with the shifting mentality of thetimes: moving from culture to recreation. Architecture portrayed in touristic films provides a familiar backdrop for the international audience and propagandises national continuity. Christian’s film is used advisedly as it proposes acritical reconsideration of policy-making for the branding of historic cities and mature destinations.\n\nThis article studies the representation of modern space and the evolution of cinematic narration within the narrow context of feature films produced in Greece in the 1920s and 1930s, in order to examine the construction of filmic narrative space and the influences, affinities and imitations between the Greek films and their international models. The purpose of this study is to describe and interpret the unstable, uneven, fragmented and sporadic expressions of cinematic depictions of modern urban space in Greece. This examination will focus on the mapping of the locations and the implications of urban space in the organisation of the narration in order to propose a typology of depictions of the Athenian modernity in the 1920s and 1930s, providing an introduction on the Athenian urbanism and describing the radical architectural and social mutations and the ideological reorientations that transformed the Athenian cityscape in terms of class, ethnicity, social mobility and geography. In this context, this essay attempts to answer the following questions: which of these transformations are visible in the feature films of the 1920s and 1930s? How specific film genres generate urban iconographies in this corpus? How do all these urban themes or spatial motifs reflect the passage from the amateur and non-professional production of the 1920s to the more canonical, stereotyped and, more or less, 'classical' narration, that follows the examples of mainstream cinema regarding city representations?"
