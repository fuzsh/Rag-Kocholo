It was meant to be an accessible and readable introduction to his life and work, updating Andrew Horton’s book and introducing global cinephiles to the full scope of Angelopoulos’ cinematic project. Mark was succeeded by generous and enthusiastic editors, who insisted on completing this book. I have to thank Chris Chappell, Soyolmaa Lkhagvadorj, Mykelin Higham and finally, and especially, Amanda Horn, whose persistence and dedication made this monograph possible despite a series of obstacles, including health problems and the restrictions of the pandemic. My deepest gratitude to my colleague Achilleas Dellis from Athens, who, during the prolonged period of lockdown, found and sent me rare material on the reception and the interpretation of Angelopoulos’ films. Also, deep thanks to my colleague Be y Kaklamanidou from the University of Thessaloniki for her graceful encouragement and help. Finally, my gratitude to Yannis Dramitinos for his assistance with the photographic snapshots. I would also like to thank Phoebe Economopoulou and Eleni Angelopoulou, for the permission to use a number of stills and photographs from Theo’s films: their enthusiasm has been invaluable. My thanks to Kiriaki Orphanos, David Po er and Sophia Sakellis for looking a er the textual editing at diﬀerent stages of its progress.

Sometimes direct equivalence is possible although phonetic transcription is employed (Giorgos or Yorgos: Giorgos Arvanitis, but Yorgos Lanthimos. Giannis or Yannis?). As a general rule, I followed the form found at the IMDb website. All translations from Greek are (mostly) by me.\n\nIntroduction\n\nProlegomena to Theo Angelopoulos’ Life and Filmmaking\n\nExploring the Oeuvre This monograph aims to present the Greek filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos as a global auteur by contextualising his life and work, delineating central elements of his cinematic language and analysing crucial motifs of the political, aesthetic and mythopoetic visual imagery embodied in his movies. It a empts a synoptic but thorough interpretation of his films and their poetics, pointing out continuities and discontinuities between them while interrogating the wider questions embedded in their narrative and visual structure. Overall, the book is about Angelopoulos the me eur en scène, the screenwriter and the image-maker, rather than the political thinker, le -wing ideologue or ambassador for a national culture. Despite the usual framing of his work as representing the epitome of political modernism in the European periphery, and of Angelopoulos as the symbol of a ‘national or local cinema’, I argue for the global and transnational significance of his oeuvre by unframing it from its ‘marginal’ or ‘peripheral’ character. My intention is to explore the cinematographic poetics of Angelopoulos’ visual idiom, his cinécriture, in the sense that Robert Bresson understood the term, as ‘writing with images in movement and with sounds’ (Bresson 1986 [1975]: 7). I will also discuss the various problematics Angelopoulos incorporated in his images, or indeed brought out with his images, with the intention of providing an alternative to the hegemonic regimes of occlusion that popular culture, and its cultural\n\n2\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nprivileging by postmodernism, imposed on cinematic production a er the mid-eighties. The book engages with Angelopoulos’ works in three main chapters, each one with a diﬀerent perspective and methodology. Each chapter presupposes and leads to the other, aiming to investigate the full scope of Angelopoulos’ creative output and critically address his overall achievement. Each chapter aspires to foreground what is determined by immediate historical context and what transcends it while discussing Angelopoulos’ conscious a empt to articulate a global language for cinematic representation by synthesising various genres, filmic discourses and heterogenous styles. Ultimately, of course, we are trying to be er understand the work and the life of Theo Angelopoulos, since, as Jean Cocteau would have stated, ‘a film, whatever it might be, is always its director’s portrait’ (Cocteau 1972: 77). Indeed, within the political and aesthetic form of his movies, a complex, contradictory and somehow tormented portrait of an ambitious artist emerges, one that asks for cautious and systematic analysis. Chapter 1 gives a summary of Angelopoulos’ life, situating him within the historical and social realities that formed his world from his early years until his sudden death in 2012. However, I am not presenting his films and life as commentaries on the upheavals of his native country. On the contrary, I examine them as the symbolic extensions in time of their social contexts and their implied subtexts. Nevertheless, I will draw on various contributing factors, including the biographical, that led to the formation of Angelopoulos’ cinematic language starting with his decision to become a filmmaker. To that end, I have consulted a variety of sources about his life, including interviews in Greek journals and newspapers and, especially a er 1990, on television. I have also si ed through various and, occasionally, contradictory statements, which were o en coloured by personal feuds, bi er frustrations and professional bias. Yet I have avoided any Freudian interpretation, since psychoanalytic biographism does not fully account for the many invisible texts we find emerging from Angelopoulos’ films and that cannot be explained by reductionist references to personal or contextual particulars. Within this loose biographical sketch, I have a empted to incorporate details about the production and reception of Angelopoulos’ films in a coherent narrative that could function as the hermeneutical background for certain aspects of his work in general. (A comprehensive account can be found in my previous book, A History of Greek Cinema (2012), and a more detailed analysis of his visual problematics in Realism in Post-War Greek Cinema (2016) with specific reference to his ‘ocular poetics’.) Perhaps, in another study, a more biographical and probably Freudian or even Laca-\n\nProlegomena to Theo Angelopoulos’ Life and Filmmaking\n\n3\n\nnian analysis of Angelopoulos’ films is needed in order to explore the psychological ‘mirrorings’ encoded in the structure of his cinematic language; the recurring themes of returning fathers, incestuous psychodynamics and maternal absence. Some of these aspects will be raised briefly while discussing Angelopoulos’ filmic texts during critical moments in his professional life and the external circumstances governing the reorientation of the film industry in Greece, such as, for example, the Restoration of the Republic, a er July 1974. Chapter 2, which is the longest, provides a systematic and chronological presentation of Angelopoulos’ works on their own terms and independently from the wider over-texts of their time. There are many detailed presentations of his films and their storylines: in Andrew Horton’s brilliant monograph (which unfortunately ends at 1998) or Acquarello’s1 lengthy article, for example, both of which I recommend. Furthermore, Artificial Eye has released a three-volume collector’s edition of Angelopoulos’ films without, however, any commentary or an accompanying booklet but that nevertheless gives the opportunity to study his films in their entirety. Since this monograph is wri en for an international audience, I have avoided including unnecessary references, reviews or articles in Greek. I make an exception for the essays by Vassilis Rafailidis (1934–2000), who followed the development of Angelopoulos’ work from the beginning as a friend, co-worker and intellectual comrade in arms until his death. Chapter 3 focuses on how Angelopoulos constructed his cinematic language by combining, inventing, or reinventing diﬀerent components from various genres in classical and experimental filmmaking. The central theme of this chapter is the constant transmutation of Angelopoulos’ visual vocabulary; a radical transmutation that reflected wider cultural revisions in the social dimensions of film production as well as in his personal ideological perspective and philosophical hermeneutics of cinematic representation. It also briefly addresses the various elements his filmic visuality is comprised of, like acting, sexuality, religion and ideology. Finally, it argues that in his perplexing evolution as a filmmaker, he aspired to explore and elaborate a new dimension in the field of cinematic visuality, which I would term as the cinematic sublime. Consciously or unconsciously, Angelopoulos was working towards the construction of the sublime as an aesthetic dimension within the moving images of cinema, and this is what his best films are about. My belief is that he did succeed in creating the sublime in his best films, although we find fragments and isolated elements of its presence in most of them. His cinematic sublime was the outcome of his constant struggle to expand the expressive potential of cinema so that as a filmmaker he could give the ‘audience the credit of being intelligent, to help them understand their\n\n4\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nown existence, to give them hope in a be er future, to teach them how to dream again’ (Fainaru 2001: 149).\n\nFollowing Angelopoulos’ Journeys Angelopoulos made thirteen films and a small number of shorts and documentaries. He started with a materialistic, Marxist understanding about the function of cinema in contemporary societies, which was dominant in the sixties through the work of the French structuralist Marxists Louis Althusser and Nicos Poulantzas. Coming out of the militant Marxist period of the Cahiers du Cinema between 1966 and 1969, he firmly believed in the revolutionary or liberational potential of cinema – through the principles of historical and dialectical materialism – as the only true public art in modern capitalist societies, characterised by the exploitation of the working class, the alienation of their social existence and the reification of their individual consciousnesses. This approach runs deep throughout Angelopoulos’ whole career. Even when he grew disappointed with the Le , as late as 2010 he still believed: ‘I remain le -wing emotionally, although I don’t know what to be Le -wing means anymore.’2 Furthermore, Angelopoulos’ early work was in a constant, implicitly agonistic, dialogue with Bertolt Brecht’s epic theatre, particularly in its anti-Aristotelian de-dramatisation, its relative independence from all conventions of realism, its unemotional picturing of the world, and in being able to shi the position of the spectator from empathy to detachment outside action, amongst other things (Brecht 1964: 35). However, his Brechtian period ended rather abruptly with his fourth film, never to be revisited except as self-quotation and self-parody. In the end, Aristotle returned triumphant, and his understanding of tragedy as ‘catharsis’ (Aristotle 1995: 46) through pity and fear (di’ eleou kai fovou) can be found at the heart of Angelopoulos’ most distinct contributions to filmmaking, avoiding all forms of referential or indeed mimetic fallacy that has framed the hermeneutics of Aristotle’s Poetics for centuries. Aristotle’s influence dialectically surpasses, in the Hegelian sense of au eben, all Brechtian elements in Angelopoulos’ work a er 1977 and o en even seems to resynthesise Brechtian performative stylisation through clsssical mythopoetic narratives. The changes in Angelopoulos’ cinematic language manifested a growing pessimism about the Le , pessimism, or melancholia, he gradually transferred, politically and psychologically, to the anti-realism of grand utopian quests while at the same time struggling to ‘visualise’ their specific formal poetics. Despite such disenchantment, Angelopoulos main-\n\nProlegomena to Theo Angelopoulos’ Life and Filmmaking\n\n5\n\ntained his fascination with the enduring political impact of cinema in the age of neoliberal, post-ideological and post-metaphysical consumer capitalism, when images became disposable commodities and the working class, which in the past he thought of as the central social force for revolutionary action, appeared to have all but lost its ‘revolutionary’ potential for political liberation and social emancipation. His disillusion with the organised parties of the Le , and his repudiation of them as bureaucratic managerialism, led Angelopoulos to explore but never quite endorse a certain aesthetic autonomy of art bespeaking the diachronic, if not perennial, ‘essence’ of cultural imaginary. The last chapter functions as a counterpoint to those that have preceded it. It aspires to unframe Angelopoulos from the heavy politicisation of his films and the constant a empts by critics to see them as visual notes, or indeed footnotes, on the political tragedies of contemporary Greece. For this purpose, it explores his films as a sustained autobiographical visual narrative, or a cinematic roman-fleuve in the form of mythobiography,3 by foregrounding the personal and sometimes personalist themes present in the works that are based on Angelopoulos’ own experiences, relationships and encounters (pragmatic details of which are given in the first chapter). On the other hand, Angelopoulos himself stated: ‘All my films are autobiographical. There is an internal and an external autobiography. Even in the Reconstruction one could find autobiographical elements.’4 Despite the dominant tropes in the interpretation of Angelopoulos’ work as a political director who was aﬄicted by mal-du-siècle melancholia a er the collapse of socialism in 1989–91, this study also explores certain existentialist themes embedded in his images, which address questions of freedom, personal identity, ethical choice, memory and subjectivity, together with a peculiar nostalgia for a lost absolute, sometimes full of religiosity but totally devoid of religion. Ultimately, a pa ern of evolution emerges that brings Angelopoulos’ intellectual and spiritual quest close to a reverse form, as it were, of Soren Kierkegaard’s stages of development; especially in the last two decades of his life, when the temptation of an aestheticised history became dominant in his thinking, confronting the nihilistic implosion of meaning pervading Europe a er 1989. A prevailing misconception about Angelopoulos’ work is that viewers need to know about Greek political history in order to understand it. Talking about The Travelling Players, David Thomson noted that ‘we know a er half an hour, that, as non-native watchers, we are always to be cut oﬀ from the roots of this extraordinary ritual [which became] a film’ (Thomson 2008: 910). This is not the case; no sensitive or responsive viewer can feel cut oﬀ from Angelopoulos’ films because of their historical subject ma er. Each film not only reconstructs history but also constructs its own\n\n6\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nhistory and both forms the expectations of its audience and is informed by them. Therefore, there is no need to read books on Greek politics before watching Angelopoulos. The film is itself the historical event, a spatiotemporal osmosis of collective and individual experiences through its images, a synergy between the formal intentions of the its director and the projections of its spectators, transforming it into a social encounter. With the belief that cinematic images provide both the text and context for their experience, this monograph minimises superfluous information about local politics regarding production, conflicts with other directors over funding, or personal squabbles with journalists and reviewers. The otherwise respected Greek film critic Dimitris Danikas, for example, loved poking malicious fun at all Angelopoulos’ films and has stirred considerable controversy about their reception. Such debates went on for long and were acrimonious, without ever elucidating or accounting for the visual dynamics of Angelopoulos’ overall achievement. The central point of my analysis is that there is no single ‘Angelopoulos’ cinematic language but rather four stages constituting the visual articulation of his work. The first is the period of political films, structured around Brechtian theatricality and a persistent tendency to demystify political power. The second is the period of delving into existentialist dilemmas through the discovery of introspective conscience in the individual psyche (a new parameter in his poetic vocabulary). In the third, Angelopoulos either assumes the mask of the cultural icon exploring collective myths across borderless regions or identifies with the archetypal poet of nationhood in times of crisis. Finally, in the fourth Angelopoulos oscillates between scepticism and nihilism; from the ideological enthusiasm that promised a new social and political life to the pulverisation of existence in modern cities inhabited by virtual realities, spectral presences and groundless ontologies. However, the ultimate question about visual temporality remains unanswered, as his last film, The Other Sea, in which he would have formulated a coherent presentation of the predicament of displaced refugees, as embodying the ontology of homelessness and deterritorialization, was le unrealised because of his violent death. Overall, Angelopoulos’ cinema is characterised by complex fluidity, an urgent quest for innovation, and the persistent search for what we might call visual historicity. The filmmaker was for him both historian and history, sometimes with the initial le er capitalised (which indeed might be problematic for his early historical materialism). His cinematic images were both res gestae and historia rerum gestarum, being themselves historical events that challenged and provoked viewers and invited them to think critically about the past and act radically in their present.\n\nProlegomena to Theo Angelopoulos’ Life and Filmmaking\n\n7\n\nThey were also images encapsulating a philosophy, a way of thinking, a specific form of life; this philosophy of image-breaking and imagemaking is at the heart of Angelopoulos’ visual project throughout his work. Images as collective histories are central to his iconographic legacy, constructing representations that do not simply epitomise the historical experience of the Greeks but also elucidate many frustrated or aborted projects of European modernity. My ultimate suggestion is that all these elements frame and point to a cinematic visualisation of the sublime, to the degree that cinema has been able to encapsulate and construct a specific, non-literary perception of sublimity as primarily a mental event, as a noumenon in the Kantian sense of the word. As Immanuel Kant would have stated: ‘a noumenon is not for our understanding a special [kind of] object, namely, an intelligible object; . . . For we cannot in the least represent to ourselves the possibility of an understanding which should know its object, not discursively through categories, but intuitively in a non-sensible intuition’ (Kant 1999: 273). Such intuited objects, which Kant aptly called ‘intellectual intuition’ (‘nicht sinnliche Anschauung’) (Kant 1999: 267), are expressed through concrete visual forms without being completely determined by them, presenting metonymically the emerging non-correspondence between the specific form and its meaning: the viewer intuits the surplus meaning that comes out of each image without being able to define its specific location. Aimilia Karali relates a story about Angelopoulos looking for locations for his film Alexander the Great/O Megalexandros (1980): he wanted to find a mountainous village with its buildings arranged in semi-circular order and a central square in the middle. They were looking for quite some time for such a village, but they couldn’t find it. But Angelopoulos insisted: ‘since I thought of it, it exists,’ he said to his associates. At a certain moment, one of them saw a documentary on television about the village Deskati, in Grevena. That was the village that Angelopoulos had thought.\n\nThe sublime in Angelopoulos is a mental event, a visionary transfiguration of the real, which he, simultaneously as the me eur en scène and the auteur, felt compelled to extract from his visual unconscious and bring out into the light of material existence. Angelopoulos’ sublime can be drawn out of what Hegel called ‘the flight beyond the determinateness of appearance that constitutes the general character of the sublime’ (Hegel 1975: 303), which accounts for the asymmetries between images and significations that proliferate in his most mature and accomplished films. The visual form of the sublime and its mental intuitive content are, despite their connection, at the same time in an entropic relationship: they materialise each other, but what is le out collides with its own realisation.\n\n8\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nAs Andre Bazin, a theorist whom Angelopoulos did not really appreciate much, suggested: ‘What is imaginary on the screen must have the spatial density of something real’ (Bazin 2005: 48). Such existence of the real, but not of the realistic, in his poetic imaginary, as expressed through his emblematic long take, provoked ambiguous emotions in his viewers and critics. Indeed, in Landscape in the Mist (1988), the broken finger of the colossal hand seen pointing at the viewer and yet lost on the closed horizon of modern architectural brutalism is probably one of the most sublime images conceived to illustrate the lost unity of a reality that may never have existed in post-war Europe, unless, perhaps, as a dream or an alibi. But it is precisely the thinkability of being in the realm of the beyond while experiencing reality through the confines of material necessity that makes Angelopoulos’ cinematic sublime so significant and so elusive. Furthermore, it is the imminent presence of the numinous within the material object that renders this specific image sublime in the Kantian sense. Such asymmetry between the real and the ideal expresses precisely the tragic character of sublimity that led Angelopoulos, unexpectedly and from the back door, to the empathic mimesis and catharsis of his renewed Aristotelianism. In stark contrast to the gigantic statue of Jesus Christ in Federico Fellini’s La Dolce Vita (1960) or Lenin’s statue in Wolfgang Becker’s Good Bye, Lenin! (2003), Angelopoulos’ broken hand is both numinous and ominous, framing the sublime through its absence but also foregrounding it by the enormity of the emptiness around its vestiges. Overall, Angelopoulos’ cinematic language was a systematic and persistent a empt to achieve the cinematic sublime: the sublime as immersion and emergence, the catalysts for ecstatic and oneiric experiences through filmic images.\n\nPreliminary Notes on the Auteur and His World I must point out that Angelopoulos is a diﬃcult director to watch; I could claim that he is consciously and deliberately a director’s director, an auteur’s auteur, and not a filmmaker courting large audiences. As with many post-war directors, like Robert Bresson, Satyajit Ray, Yussef Chahine, Miklós Jancsó and Glauber Rocha, and more recently Abbas Kiarostami, Milcho Manchevski, Apichatpong Weerasethakul and Nuri Bilge Ceylan, he never made films intended for amusement, escapism or entertainment. With a consciously contrarian a itude, he made films to cinematically explore the formless or more appropriately the ‘unfilmed’ – sometimes even the unfilmable – existential dynamics that he observed or intuited in the historical experience and the individual mind of his viewers.\n\nProlegomena to Theo Angelopoulos’ Life and Filmmaking\n\n9\n\nAs I argue here, Angelopoulos was both filmmaker and mythmaker, producing collective and personal ‘biomythographies’, emulating to a surprising degree, given the small market of Greek filmmaking, some of the greatest names in world cinema. Through his scripts, he was a veritable auteur, synthesising mise en scène, screenwriting and visual se ings in a uniquely personal (and impersonal) style. Furthermore, he placed his individual stamp on all the elements of his movies: music, colour patterns, acting style, location choice, camera movement and editing. So, the purpose of this study is to facilitate a sensitive yet critical and judicious understanding of the scope of Angelopoulos’ achievement with his films’ distinct styles, diverse perspectives and multiple imaginings. Being ‘diﬃcult’ to watch, Angelopoulos’ films have been scorned and rejected by many prominent film critics for their ‘pretentious’, ‘funereal’ or ‘self-indulgent’ style. Such facile reactions say more about the spectators (and the critics) than about the films. The reception of movies depends on many external factors that are not always about the unmediated or implicit relationship between audience, movie-production and filmmaker. It also changes according to new contextual realities, cultural reorientations and aesthetic revisions (or advertising promotions) from decade to decade, even from year to year. Indeed, forgo en, neglected or lost films are rediscovered, reinterpreted and gradually restored to the canon, where they sometimes achieve commercial prominence; like the neglected films of the late Orson Welles, for example, or the underrated melodramas of Douglas Sirk. The truth, however, is that Angelopoulos as a name or a brand never became part of the ‘film industry’, and his films could never have become sellable products for exports (as is the recent case with Yorgos Lanthimos). They existed within the ‘film culture’ as expressions of experimental marginality and creative inventiveness but were only peripheral in the realm of film as industry and production, although their contribution to establishing international co-production strategies should not be underestimated. The commercial success of a film might be purely circumstantial and not connected to any intrinsic qualities, especially in the current era of dizzying eclecticism and ‘imaginal politics’, in which, as observed by Chiara Bo ici: ‘images are no longer what mediate our doing politics but that which risks doing politics in our stead’ (Bo ici 2014: 178). Today, cinema is mostly dominated by digital eﬀects and computer-generated imagery, which totally erase narrative, plot, characterisation and, most importantly, any sense of a creative mythopoeic imaginary. In a sense, cinema has been transformed into post-cinema or non-cinema, which indicates a profound and radical problematisation of its nature and function as new media of virtual representation become more widespread.\n\n10\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nHow can an average viewer whose visual experience is saturated by digital eﬀects, celebrity icons and escapist extravaganzas watch an Angelopoulos film today? Perhaps the post-cinematic condition is a victory of technology over representation, in which, as Marshall McLuhan aptly summarised, ‘the medium is the message’. And if the current state of aﬀairs has proven anything, it is that there is nothing else beyond the medium. We pay more a ention to the ingenuity of the special eﬀects than the imagination of the director as the creator of films, the acting styles of their performers, or even the story of the collaborative synergies between the two. In a way, here we return to Francois Truﬀaut’s statement: ‘There are no good or bad films; only good or bad directors.’ In this study, I strongly defend the idea of the auteur director, the person whose singular vision of reality indicates a critical interpretation of the act and the art of filming, and in a telling gesture towards a particular way of reinterpreting the auteur approach, I draw on Andrew Sarris’ suggestion that we must put ‘. . . a greater emphasis on the tantalising mystery of style than on the romantic agony of the artists’ (Sarris 1996 [1968]: 272). The dynamic equivalence between the vision of filmmakers and the power of their style is essential for the understanding of the complexity or even the very structure of their films. This has nothing to do with directors as celebrities but instead with directors as culture-makers who construct mythopoetic narratives through which collectivities can recognise themselves or find traces of their own realities in the field of visuality – something that may contribute to their commercial success but of course does not depend on it. Their mythopoeia is essential for understanding the structural form of their films and the pa erns of cinematic ‘visual thinking’, since, as Rudolf Arnheim argued, eventually in an era dominated by images ‘. . . visual perception [becomes] a cognitive activity’ (Arnheim 1969: v). Ultimately, in the hypermodern temporality of today, commodified images define what is visible and what remains unvisualised. Yet instead of seeing images only as funereal monuments, or as monumentalising ‘gods that failed’, Angelopoulos also saw them as spaces of emancipation and topoi of existential rupture, leading to ‘an upsurge of individual autonomy and a lessening of people’s subjection to collective frameworks’ (Lipovetsky 2005: 76). However, even perceptive film critics are o en mistaken when it comes to Angelopoulos, such as when Geoﬀ Dyer accused Ulysses’ Gaze (1995) of being ‘another nail in the coﬃn of European art cinema’ (Dyer 2010: 12). Indeed, the link between directors and their audience (or film critics) has been totally severed by today’s blockbusters, screened in shopping malls and cinema multiplexes. Implicitly, the association between commercial\n\nProlegomena to Theo Angelopoulos’ Life and Filmmaking\n\n11\n\nsuccess and the quality of films remains strong even when the opposite is most obviously the case. The experience of going to the cinema and watching films of the recent past has been profoundly and perhaps permanently changed by the internet, new technologies and the privatised world of hypermodernity. In this study, we will address some of the radical ways of looking that Angelopoulos elaborated in his films in order to counteract the abnormal stimulation of the senses that commercial cinema employs to manipulate spectators and commodify the psychological impact of the cinematic experience. While, as Angelopoulos stated, ‘cinema is a disease’ (Fainaru 2001: 35), it can also be its own cure, and he addressed both diagnoses in his films, elaborating a unique philosophy of visuality that has been thus far underestimated. Angelopoulos was one of the first directors to oppose the new visual regimes of hyper-stimulation that characterise movies made since the late seventies. Undoubtedly, he is a transitional figure in a period marked by experimentation (the sixties and seventies) and then by the retreat from radicalism through the gradual re-emergence of the studio system and the commercial competition between cinema and television. The retreat from radical experimentalism coincided with the avoidance of what was called ‘slow or dead time’ or ‘long take’ and the replacement of its condensed temporality with fast jump-cuts, continuous action and digitised montage. Film culture, which co-evolved with the film industry, suddenly found itself trapped in the new managerialism of the studios, with films made by commi ees and targeting specific focus groups, and eﬀectively dispensing with the critical function of cinema and the personal vision of its auteurs. Many commercially successful movies, like Jaws, Star Wars, the Indiana Jones sagas or the Alien series, were being made at the same time Angelopoulos was producing his films. What made these films successful was the fact that they resembled extended fast-moving videos or television programmes through their condensation of visual time into ninety minutes of relentless action, sharp dialogue and constant camera movement. Angelopoulos, like many filmmakers from Europe, South America and Asia, responded with the discovery of energetic slowness as visual experience, which is one of his most important contributions to contemporary filmmaking. Not, of course, that we did not have ‘slow’ filmmakers before him: Michelangelo Antonioni, Glauber Rocha, Andrei Tarkovsky and even Stanley Kubrick are the direct antecedents of Angelopoulos’ style. Following on from the early Antonioni, for Angelopoulos slowness was a restorative method for visually embodying the complexities of the human psyche in an era of existential and political implosion. These complexities were unspoken and indeed unfilmed, but their visual vestiges in\n\n12\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nhis images allowed viewers to enter the dark territory of their own unconscious and unvisualised personal shadows. He called that ‘dark territory’ melancholia, which, in the late eighties, became the dominant mood of Angelopoulos’ films, expressing his ambivalence towards the cunning of history and its broken promises of emancipation, especially a er the collapse of the so-called socialist countries. Yet still upholding Hegel’s suggestion that ‘ultimately History fulfils its ulterior rational designs in an indirect and sly manner’ (Tucker 1956: 269), Angelopoulos nurtured the hope that the cinematic screen could still liberate a modern audience from its oppression, reaﬃrming rationality and ecstasy as existential realities at the same time. Such fusion of Enlightenment’s emancipation project and romanticism’s integrative perspective was for him the final frontier in order to combat ‘the powerful dynamic of individualization and pluralization within our societies’ (Lipovetsky 2005: 29). Cinematically, the slow movement indicated that the camera did not simply record or reflect; it mainly revealed and foregrounded unvisualised realities. Thus, Angelopoulos’ visual rhythm was in fact a method of uncovering ‘formal invariants’ under conflicting and antinomic layers of human interactions. In a personal note sent to Yve e Biro, Angelopoulos stated: A film’s rhythm is an inner rhythm, therefore a personal sense of time. In my films the rhythm resembles time dilation but in actual fact it is not. The ratio of filmic time to real time is 1:1, the fact that it appears like a time dilation of the sort that in music terms, we would call ritenuto or lento allows the viewers, if they let themselves, to savour or breathe time. (Biro 2008: 166)\n\nAngelopoulos used the term time dilation to describe his a empt to translate the inner temporality of his viewers into a structural element of cinematic visuality. As on many other occasions, he used the metaphor of diﬀerent movements in music: lento is mostly the tempo of his images, which might either expand into monumental cosmic symphonies or be transformed into intimate chamber music, or indeed into solo sonatas for piano or wind instruments. He persistently focused his eﬀorts on making slowness, which was for him ‘the real sense of time’, an organic element of cinematic experience. This meant that slowness was not simply an artificial delaying of action but the actual visualisation of a world’s inner temporality, one which is felt by viewers when they reflect on their own act of seeing and the sense of being. In a distinctly personal way, Angelopoulos equated unvisualised time with the oneiric structure of the unconscious. Susanne K. Langer observed that ‘cinema is “like dream’” in the mode of its presentation: it creates a virtual present, ‘an order of direct apparition. This is the mode of\n\nProlegomena to Theo Angelopoulos’ Life and Filmmaking\n\n13\n\ndream’ (Langer 1953: 412). Angelopoulos wanted his spectators to enter a dream-like or even daydreaming mode by depicting the equivalence between the sense of slowness in their mind and its active presence in their social world. The energetic slowness of Angelopoulos’ films aspired to transform all cinematic experience into an oneiric state of being, as in the works of Fellini, Tarkovsky, Chahine and Terrence Davies. Robert Eberwein suggests that the narrowing of the gap between viewer and director in cinema happens because films ‘replicate activities associated with oneiric experience’ (Eberwein 1984: 82). In that respect, Angelopoulos builds on and carries further the oneiric slowness of Tarkovsky’s Solaris (1972) and Stalker (1979), Federico Fellini’s Amarcord (1973), Ingmar Bergman’s Wild Strawberries (1957) and Antonioni’s L’ Eclisse (1962) and The Passenger (1975). He also builds on the chaotic temporal simultaneity of the unconscious mind in films by experimental directors like Stan Brakhage, Maya Deren and, especially, the early Alain Resnais. Oneiric yet energetic slowness is indeed the most significant formal invariant of Angelopoulos’ films, encapsulating his own philosophical and anthropological understanding of cinema. On the other hand, from his first film Angelopoulos understood that his cinema had to be diﬀerent from everyone else’s in his country. In an early discussion with the film critic Vasilis Rafailidis, to whom we will return frequently in this book, Angelopoulos stressed that he followed the ‘Brazilians of the cinema novo, [who made films] as if they had forgo en European cinema, looking for an expression almost national’. So, in other words, he was also looking ‘thematically, to make films that constituted testimonies about space’ (Rafailidis 2003 [1969]: 153). In order to achieve this, Angelopoulos wanted to totally discard any form of ‘picturesque’ image: that is, clichéd images and any other derivative representations. In his conversation with Rafailidis about his first film, Angelopoulos stated: ‘I have bypassed the danger of picturesqueness. The whole story is seen with so much abstraction, which makes it impossible to fall into picturesqueness’ (Rafailidis 2003 [1969]: 143). To the fast-moving, narratively exciting and thematically melodramatic films of the dominant cinematic genres, Angelopoulos developed an antithetical, almost oppositional style that was to completely re-envision and reorganise the cinematic language of his native tradition, and at the same time oﬀer a diﬀerential alternative to the hegemonic visual idioms of world cinema. Michel Ciment, who explicitly includes Angelopoulos in his list, contextualised such an approach in his well-known address about ‘slow cinema’, claiming that: ‘Facing this lack of patience and themselves made impatient by the bombardment of sound and image to which they\n\n14\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nare submi ed as TV or cinema spectators, a number of directors have reacted by a cinema of slowness, of contemplation, as if they wanted to live again the sensuous experience of a moment revealed in its authenticity.’5 The discovery of duration as the visual rhythm of cinema is probably one of Angelopoulos’ most interesting contributions to the temporal foregrounding of filmic images in the human mind. Visual duration was for Angelopoulos the translation into cinematic images ‘of pure temporality, of the lived consciousness, which is continuous and indivisible and can be only known through intuition’ (Bergson 2001: 75). His cinematic language aspired to visually ‘think in duration’ and create a cathectic sympathy between the viewer and the screen, thus intensifying their emotional responsiveness. In that respect, it is through cinema that Greece became his ‘imaginary homeland’, a place of the imagination and in the imagination. His material was primarily ‘Greek’, but its framing, visualisation and conceptualisation was transnational and universal, therefore purely cinematic. At the same time, we can infer from his work that Angelopoulos never felt he belonged to any periphery, or that he needed in any way to address himself to a hegemonic centre, whether in Europe or Hollywood. His cinematic ontology was founded on a universalising vision of polycentric visualities. In a strange way, Angelopoulos never reflected on his position agonistically or, even more, antagonistically to the presumed centres of cinematic culture. Even in his use of international film celebrities, like Marcelo Mastroianni, Jeanne Moreau, Harvey Keitel, Bruno Ganz, Willem Dafoe, Michel Piccoli, Irène Jacob and others, he seems to deliberately demythologise their cinematic personas by debunking their glamour and mystique yet elaborating forms of their cinematic anti-types. Angelopoulos tried in his movies to synthesise modes of representation and forms of presentation in which various problematics and experiences converged and diverged. He never had any dilemmas about belonging, or about the Greek position between East and West, the Balkans and the Mediterranean, or generally at the centre or the periphery of Europe. His main concern was with being as visually expressed, in an a empt to make cinematic images ‘the house of Being’ – a role that originally Martin Heidegger had a ributed to language (Heidegger 1998: 239). His camera was part of the continuum of life and history, not an external or detached observer and recorder. Being in Time and Being with Others as events born out of and through cinema were at the heart of Angelopoulos’ project. Furthermore, his cinematic eye was the catalyst for more interpersonal ways of seeing and being in society. In a way, his camera is at its best when it resides in the eye of the beholder, when it absorbs spectators in ways that do not annul their freedom but instead intensify their respon-\n\nProlegomena to Theo Angelopoulos’ Life and Filmmaking\n\n15\n\nsiveness to the exigencies of history, the impasses of their existence and the dilemmas of their creative imaginary – these were the focal points of his comprehensive visual project.\n\nSumming Up The present monograph reconceptualises the study of Angelopoulos’ films through the perspective of transnational cine-aesthetics, investigating the complex ways his films are linked with major post-war and postcommunist European cinematic exchanges, ethical anxieties and political projects. It argues that his early films deal not simply with Greek history but more significantly with political power as existential reality, with its mechanisms of oppression and domination and the various ways it was exercised by post-Enlightenment, pseudo-modernist elites in the European periphery. The films of his second period deal mainly with loss, absence and trauma through the representation of displaced individuals and their existential homelessness and broken interiority, indicating the crisis of authority and legitimacy that Angelopoulos observed taking place in European cultures. During his third period, which followed the collapse of ‘existing socialism’ and the end of the last utopian project of revolutionary enlightenment, Angelopoulos transgressed state borders and explored the proximity of otherness; although, strangely enough, in order to do so he had to invest himself with the mantle of the prophet, or the representative ‘poet’, of the nation and its language. In his final period, which coincides with the new millennium, his camera explored the rise of European nihilism together with the hegemony of a capitalist globalisation that homogenised cultural expressions and imposed strategies of surveillance and control, stripping the individual naked from their mystery and enigma, and, indeed, stripping them of their very freedom. His last film is a long, rather pessimistic elegy on the death of a whole world image, as the quest for ‘lost movies’ in which the gaze was innocent and young is replaced by death, suicide and the ‘dust of time’. If studied carefully and sensitively, Angelopoulos’ films have the potential to change cinematic thinking. Indeed, some of them were catalysts for wider and permanent reconsiderations of dominant practices. The fact that his films radically challenged visual thinking indicates that they also constitute historical events, ruptures in the horizon of conformist politics in a period of mediocracy, can still potentially challenge the dominant contemporary regimes of cinematic visuality. How Angelopoulos employed cinema and imagined the cinematic is essentially the ultimate\n\n16\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nquestion that emerges from his films. Despite the fact that he never elaborated a detailed or systematic theory about cinema, we can extract from his work itself a firm belief of the purposeful intentionality of visual images; through this, we can also examine his ideas not only on how to make cinematic images but about their telos within the historical world of their viewers. In a way, this study explores what Robert Sinnerbrink called Angelopoulos’ ‘cinematic ethics’, since, as he states when concluding his study: ‘Angelopoulos’ films, both early and late, serve as ethically and politically significant memorials to the (o en tragic) intersection of cinema and history over the previous century’ (Sinnerbrink 2015: 96). Ultimately, this study situates Angelopoulos within the macro-narratives that have dominated European cinematic production since the seventies. It argues that, whilst belonging to Greek society and expressing the specific elements of the Greek historical experience, Angelopoulos gradually transcended the barriers of his native culture and produced an oeuvre that was truly transnational, multidimensional and cosmopolitan. Dina Iordanova placed Angelopoulos’ films in their appropriate context and directorial perspective when she wrote: Angelopoulos’ Balkan films are also historical collages, raising issues of displacement and lost homelands, and trying to go beyond the geopolitical intricacies that dominate the approaches of other film-makers. His trademark atmosphere of lonely wandering through the mist prevails in all his films which deal with issues of universally distorted harmony, irrecoverable identities and fin-de-siecle sadness. He is the only one daring enough to claim that problems of universal identity lurk from within the peculiar Balkan universe. (Iordanova 2001: 107)\n\nAngelopoulos’ cinema is Greek, Balkan, Mediterranean, European and global; it belongs to what Kriss Rave o-Biagioli called ‘Mythopoetic Cinema’ (Rave o-Biagioli 2017: 64–123), although not solely focused on the ruins of European identity (in itself a Eurocentric perception) but on something wider and much more foundational: the uneasiness that permeates culture, as Sigmund Freud would have called it. His films are precisely about how such uneasiness impacts individuals and societies and seriously impairs their need to dream and the desire to be otherwise. Because of its profound anthropological concerns, Angelopoulos’ mythopoetic cinema belongs to, or indeed comes out of, the wider project of establishing a global culture of cinephilia, tentatively articulated by Thomas Elsaesser as that which ‘reverberates with nostalgia and dedication, with longings and discrimination and evokes, . . . more than a passion for going to the movies, and only a li le less, than an entire a itude towards life’ (Elsaesser 2005: 27). Cinephilia is a movement in which every local visual tradition contributes forms, pa erns and iconologies, constituting the grand mosaic\n\nProlegomena to Theo Angelopoulos’ Life and Filmmaking\n\n17\n\nof world cinema that we see being formed today: diverse, contradictory and palimpsestic. Angelopoulos’ contribution to the emerging global cinephilia constitutes an important chapter in its historical process, and the present study wants to elucidate certain aspects of his achievement. Furthermore, drawing again from Thomas Elsaesser, we can understand the complex intersection between local power structures and international institutional alliances that made Angelopoulos a global auteur, as he achieved ‘. . . a paradoxical kind of autonomy and agency that that has the potential to reinvent the cinema, not as an art form, nor as a life form, but as a form of philosophy . . .’ (Elsaesser 2017: 39). Indeed, Angelopoulos is a global auteur because he created and imagined an intricate, complex and challenging philosophy of visuality, one that needs more a ention and further exploration.\n\nNotes 1.

His father was a shopkeeper, and his mother stayed at home looking a er their children, Theodoros, Nikos, Paraskevoula and Anna. One of the most traumatic events in his life was the death of his sister Anna in an accident when she was eleven years old. Theodoros studied at the local schools and entered the Law Faculty of Athens University in 1953, but he never sat for the final exams. As a young man, he read voraciously, mainly Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, Stendhal, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Greek writers – particularly poets, like C.P. Cavafy, Yannis Ritsos and especially the modernist poet George Seferis (Nobel Prize winner 1963). Early in his life, Angelopoulos fell in love with the cinema. He watched all the Hollywood films that screened at the growing number of movie theatres in Athens during the post-war reconstruction. He was especially enthused by the films of John Huston, Howard Hawks, Abraham Polonsky, Raoul Walsh and Michael Curtiz, whose Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) had a permanent impact on his cinematic imagination. A er completing his military service in 1961, Angelopoulos moved to Paris where he initially enrolled at the Sorbonne for studies in French literature and cinema. He also a ended lectures on ethnology by Claude Lévi-Strauss, and those on film history by the Marxist historian of cinema Georges Sadoul and the phenomenologist Jean Mitry – the influence of these thinkers can be easily detected in Angelopoulos’ own understanding of the social function and aesthetic epistemology of cinematic images. Between 1962 and 1963, he studied at the famous L’Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques (IDHEC), the Institute for Advanced Cin-\n\nLife and Works\n\n19\n\nematographic Studies, which, under the leadership of Marcel L’Herbier, was the centre to which many aspiring directors from all over the world came to study (amongst them Glauber Rocha, Volker Schlöndorﬀ, Andrzej Żuławski, Nelson Pereira dos Santos and the Greek expatriates Costa-Gavras and Tonia Marketaki). In a legendary dispute, Angelopoulos fell out with one of the professors of filmmaking and terminated his studies there. However, he enrolled in special classes at the Muse de L’ Homme, where he studied under Jean Rouch, who was in charge of the Comité du Film Ethnographique. Rouch was one of the initiators of cinéma-vérité in France, following Alexander Astruc’s camera-stylo. Furthermore, with his famous and controversial film Moi, un Noir (Me, A Black, 1958), he used jump-cuts, non-professional actors and long continuous shots, all of which were to become dominant filmic practices a er the rise of Nouvelle Vague and the release of Jean-Luc Godard’s À bout de souﬄe (1960). Rouch’s Chronicle of a Summer (Chronique d’un été, 1960) can be seen as a background reference to Angelopoulos’ first short film The Broadcast (1968). Angelopoulos worked in Paris during the early heroic years of the French New Wave and watched most of the films by Jacques Rive e, Claude Chabrol and François Truﬀaut, the directors who expressed that ‘certain tendency of the French Cinema’, which was labelled as the auteur tradition. During this period, he made the short film Black and White for his exams, ‘the story of someone who is being chased all over Paris’ (Fainaru 2001: 129), but it was rejected by his film professor. This first foray into filmmaking exemplified the main characteristics of his later work: loose (or no) script, long takes, self-conscious acting and improvised movement of camera, minus découpage (editing). In 1964, Angelopoulos returned to Greece and together with Tonia Marketaki, who was to become one of the most important directors of the period, established the journal Democratic Change/Dimokratiki Allagi in which he wrote his early film reviews (its publication was banned in 1967 by the military dictatorship). In 1965, he started working on his first film, an urban road movie modelled on Richard Lester’s The Beatles mockumentary A Hard Day’s Night (1964), about the Greek pop group The Forminx. The producer did not like the spontaneity of the filming process and the total absence of a script, so Angelopoulos resigned from the project. The film was completed by Kostas Lychnaras and released under the title Adventures with the Forminx/Peripeteies me tous Forminx (1965) and still included scenes shot by Angelopoulos. A er his first eﬀort, Angelopoulos embarked on the production of a short film, The Broadcast/Ekpompi (1968), which received the Critic’s Prize at the Thessaloniki Film Festival, despite the strict censorship imposed by\n\n20\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nthe 1967 military junta. This film is an extremely interesting early example of his experimentation with cinematic form, especially camera movement, and his a empt to fuse the techniques of direct cinema with the new televisual modes of filming. In September 1969, in collaboration with his lifelong friend Vasilis Rafailidis (1934–2000), Angelopoulos established the journal Contemporary Cinema/Synchronos Kinimatografos as a project in which advanced theoretical reflection, applied film criticism and continuous dialogue on the ideology of the cinematic medium would be encouraged and conducted seriously. As a tribute to Rafailidis a er his death, Angelopoulos wrote: Rafailidis did all the work and the complete responsibility was with him. The journal was to become the central instrument of what was to be called New Greek Cinema, because it gathered all the new filmmakers of the period, the whole world of Greek cinema. In the middle of the Dictatorship, it was used as a place of coming together, resistance and rebellion towards both directions: political, in regard to the junta but also towards the quest for a substantially ‘other’ cinema – a new cinema which would go along – both thematically and ‘linguistically’– with the currents which were prevailing at that moment not only in Europe, but the whole world. And this was supported fanatically by Vasilis, until the day he handed over the journal to certain younger people and departed. Things, however, didn’t evolve as we expected them – neither with Greek cinema nor with politics. (in Rafailidis 2003 [1969]: 172–73)\n\nSome of the most important young cinematographers of what was later to be called the New Greek Cinema worked with them on the journal; George Korras, Yannis Smaragdis, Michel Dimopoulos, Takis Lykouresos, Kostas Sfikas, Lakis Papastathis, Hristos Vakalopoulos, Stavros Tornes, Demos Theos, Roula Mitropoulou, Pandelis Voulgaris and many others were involved in its production, editing or distribution. In its pages, we can find detailed critical writing about the work of many international directors like Michelangelo Antonioni, Pier-Paolo Pasolini, Jean-Luc Godard, the Taviani Brothers, Elia Kazan, Miklós Jancsó, Eric Rohmer and Nagisa Oshima, whose work was screened in selected art-house cinemas in Athens. At the same time, they published theoretical and critical articles problematising – or, rather, dismissing – established expectations and practices of the dominant, so-called Old Commercial Cinema of the studio era (dominated by Finos Film and James Paris Productions) while critically exploring the ideological, historical and aesthetic foundations of Greek cinema and its institutional and cultural specificities. For the first issue, Angelopoulos translated a short essay called ‘Goals of New Cinema’ by the otherwise unknown French writer Francois Liberet into Greek. The essay seems to encapsulate Angelopoulos’ own concerns about cinematic language and\n\nLife and Works\n\n21\n\n. . . a new view of the world, a view both critical and poetic at the same time. Critical because it doesn’t accept old traditional truths that were imposed on us since our birth, but questions and refutes them; Poetic because ‘crisis of conscience’ means choice, therefore art. The eﬀort to disseminate culture is meaningless unless it takes place together with a renewal of structures in all aspects. (Angelopoulos 1969: 11)\n\nIn the same issue, we also find articles on the ‘authenticity of new cinema’, the articulation of a new synergistic model of spectatorship, and a rather nervous interview between Angelopoulos and Lakis Papastathis, representing the journal, with Alexis Damianos, the director of the film Until the Ship/Mehri to Ploio, alternative title Cornerstone (1965), which can be considered a precursor to the ‘New Greek Cinema’ as advocated by Angelopoulos. The interviewers are critical of the organic cohesion, music and folklore elements in Damianos’ film while praising his choice of amateur actors. The journal, which defined the development of cinephilia in Greece, lasted until 1984 under diﬀerent editors and took on various ideological orientations over its lifespan, ranging from militant Marxist to ethnocentric, navel-gazing narrative quests for national identity. Angelopoulos le its editorial board rather early in 1971, a er having helped the journal articulate, mostly through his presence and his first film, a solid theoretical reflection on the nature and function of cinema, both aesthetically and politically. His dialogue with Rafailidis in the third issue (November 1969: 20–29) remains to this day the foundational declaration of what was to be called New Greek Cinema/Neos Ellinikos Kinimatografos and one of the few documents of cinematic self-reflexivity in the country. During this period of intense questioning of the studio system, Angelopoulos discovered his own independent and, to a certain degree, critical trajectory towards the politique des auteur approach, as expressed in the Cahiers Du Cinema. Despite the obsession with the visual representation of ‘Greekness’ that preoccupied some members of the original group, Angelopoulos initiated his own quest for a renewed understanding of history and historicity, as opposed to the ideological and sometimes defensive pursuit of an elusive national identity expressed in cinematic form. For him, what always preceded this quest was the special vision of the auteur, which translates as ‘creator’ or ‘poet’ in Greek; so, his films are the cinema of the creator or the poet who desires to reconstruct the pristine vision of his gaze in a unement with analogous visions of collective movements. In his discussion with Rafailidis, he called it ‘. . . a cinema that is culture, . . . a form of cinema that raises claims of influencing the intellectual evolution of Greeks . . .’ (Rafailidis 2003 [1969]: 135). A er 1973, due to a long dispute about a grant from the American Ford Foundation, which brought to the surface many personal feuds and antip-\n\n22\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nathies, the journal was unfortunately taken over by a group of ostensibly anti-American ‘radicals’, who denounced Rafailidis and, implicitly, Angelopoulos. ‘My Friend Theodore,’ Rafailidis wrote later, ‘Don’t be confused because, a er I resigned, they a acked you from the journal which we both established. Envious and dysfunctional people will always exist in this world. We did what we could. They did what they could and closed down the company and the journal Contemporary Cinema’ (Rafailidis 1992: 464). A er this incident, Angelopoulos followed a rather lonely path in Greek filmmaking and, on many occasions, his old comrades criticised not only his films for not being ‘Greek’ enough but later him personally for being either a formalist or pessimistic reactionary. In his problematisation of the cinematic past, Angelopoulos initiated a fusion of genres and styles, establishing gradually the foundations for a cinematic language that expressed a deep awareness of the technological and aesthetic potentialities of the medium. He also framed a new sense of temporality that emerged during the political oppression and consequent psychological repression a er the 1967 dictatorship. His work defined the aesthetic and stylistic parameters of the New Greek Cinema as a radical movement towards cultural revisionism. Angelopoulos’ first completed film The Broadcast/I Ekpompi (1968) – on which he worked with Nico Mastorakis, who was soon to become notorious for his collaboration with the dictatorship – showed his ability to use the cinematic medium in a novel and distinct manner. Through Angelopoulos’ discussion with Rafailidis, we come to understand the problems surrounding the production of his first feature film Reconstruction/Anaparastasis (1970), which received three major awards at the Thessaloniki Film Festival. This film brought Angelopoulos global a ention a er receiving the French award for best foreign film of the year. His second film Days of ’36/Meres tou ’36 (1972) explored the atmosphere of fear and oppression the Greek people endured a er 1967, drawing a historical parallel with the previous dictatorship of General Ioannis Metaxas. With his third film, The Travelling Players/O Thiasos (1974–75), Angelopoulos singlehandedly reshaped the landscape of filmic (re)presentation, constructing a ‘thick’ visual narrative of epic scope that was totally new in the small market of Greek cinema and linked more to the grand cinematic experiments elsewhere in the world in the sixties. The success of this extraordinary movie, which was awarded the Critics Prize at the Cannes Festival in 1975, essentially internationalised Angelopoulos and allowed for his exodus from both the restricted borders of Greek cinema and the oﬃcial policies of the Greek state. Despite the Restoration of the Republic in July 1974, the government withheld, indeed practically banned, all funding for his films and sabotaged his foreign\n\nLife and Works\n\n23\n\ndistribution. Yet ironically, the film’s success also brought about the internationalisation of Greek cinema, which until then was predominantly known for Michael Cacoyannis’ Zorba the Greek (1964) and Jules Dassin’s Never on Sunday (1960). With his next film, The Hunters/Oi Kiniyoi (1977), Angelopoulos secured producers from outside the country for the first time since Zorba the Greek. Most of his later major films were also produced or co-produced by centres like the Italian RAI, the German channel ZDF and the French Institut National de l’Audiovisuel through the funding bodies of the European Union, which Greece had joined in 1980. The Greek Film Centre, which was established as part of the Ministry for Industry by the dictatorship in 1970 and then reorganised within the Ministry of Culture in 1978, started partly funding Angelopoulos’ films only a er their recognition beyond Greece. In 1979, he met Phoebe Economopoulou, who was the production manager of Alexander the Great/ O Megalexandros (1980) and who became his lifelong partner. They had three daughters, Anna, Catherine and Heleni, names that recur in his scripts as evocative signs of Angelopoulos’ personal emotional landscapes. O Megalexandros marked a change in the style and the form of his filmmaking while paving the way for an international career unprecedented by any other Greek director. A er the Japanese release of this film, Akira Kurosawa invited Angelopoulos to Japan, where he stayed for three months. Kurosawa himself had wri en a short but succinct review of Angelopoulos’ film,1 and years later Angelopoulos appeared in Catherine Cadou’s documentary Kurosawa’s Way (1991) alongside ten other global filmmakers, praising the ‘multiplication of points of view’ that he detected in Kurosawa’s films as opposed to the usual Hollywood tradition of flashback, indirectly addressing the relationship between Rashomon and his first film Reconstruction. In 2001, Angelopoulos wrote a brief introduction, under the title ‘Three Meetings with Kurosawa’, to the Greek edition of Kurosawa’s Autobiography. He mentions Kurosawa’s comment about the quality of the colour black in the uniforms of the bandits in Megalexandros. Angelopoulos wrote: ‘For me the greatest Japanese director is Mizogushi. . . . Yet I was deeply impressed by the living encounter with Kurosawa. His finesse, his concern of the quality of what he did, manic and relentless . . .’ (in Kurosawa 2001: 6). During the eighties, especially a er the election of the Socialist government of PASOK in October 1981, Angelopoulos became more mainstream and was soon elevated to the status of a cultural icon, despite the fact that most of his films were not commercially successful. His presence in the media, and his ongoing debates with many film critics, made him a house-\n\n24\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nhold name. It was he who presented ‘Greece’ as a cinematic culture to the world, especially through the international film festival circuit. In 1984, he shared an apartment with Andrei Tarkovsky in Rome for several months before his death in 1986. Tarkovsky mentions in his diaries that Angelopoulos helped with the editing of a television film about him, where Angelopoulos mentions a colourful debate between the two of them about the origin of the word ‘nostalghia’ (Tarkovsky 2018: 298). There, Angelopoulos also met Michelangelo Antonioni and befriended Tonino Guera (Tarkovsky’s close friend and screenwriter), who would work with him and the writers Thanassis Valtinos and Petros Markaris on most of his subsequent scripts. Furthermore, his increasing use of international stars brought him global acclaim and paved the way for transcultural filmic modes of production, representation and distribution, since his films were no longer exclusively ‘Greek’. During this decade, Angelopoulos released four films, Voyage to Cythera/ Taxidi sta Kythera (1984), The Beekeeper/O Melissokomos (1986), Landscape in the Mist/Topio stin Omihli (1988) and The Suspended Step of the Stork/To Meteoro Vima tou Pelaryou (1991). They were all international productions and received awards at film festivals throughout the world. One has the impression that Angelopoulos tried to revive the force of the grand experiments of sixties cinema by using ambiguously the evocative star-power of actors like Giulio Brogi, Marcello Mastroianni, Serge Reggiani, Jeanne Moreau and later Jean Maria Volonte and Erland Josephson, whose presence can be seen as a symbolic gesture to Fellini, Antonioni, Visconti and Bergman, and an oblique delineation of his personal cinematic genealogy. A er the confused atmosphere of political disenchantment in Greece and Europe, the collapse of communist regimes, and the ‘end of history’ neoliberal optimism of the eighties, in the nineties Angelopoulos and his work came to represent the ‘lost spring’ of creative modernism, with its failed projects of political renewal, novel formal representations and fairer pa erns of sociability. His films of this decade, partly funded by his own production company, made him one of the best-known names at international art-film festivals, including in the Americas, Europe, Japan and later China, and a number of documentaries were made about him by directors from various countries. Two of his most important works, Ulysses’ Gaze/To Vlemma tou Odyssea (1995) and Eternity and a Day/Mia Aioniotita kai mia Mera (1998), were generally well-received and became landmarks of the new production realities in post-communist Europe. They indicated a remarkable renaissance in Balkan cinema, also seen in the work of Emir Kusturica, Cristi Puiu, Radoslav Spasov, Yilmaz Erdoğan and Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Exploring the European unification project, its shared past and tragic present, together with the possibilities oﬀered to directors of the periph-\n\nLife and Works\n\n25\n\nery, these films had a distinct impact at a European and global level. The use of the American superstar Harvey Keitel and the German cultural hero Bruno Ganz, who had starred in Wim Wenders’ film The Wings of Desire (1987), created another career for Angelopoulos in the United States, opening the American market and culture of film criticism to his work, with varied reactions and interpretations. The reviews of Angelopoulos’ films listed on the website Ro en Tomatoes website proliferated a er 1998, with wildly diﬀering critiques by, for example, Roger Ebert, Jonathan Rosenbaum and David Thomson. Angelopoulos received the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Festival in 1998 for Eternity and a Day, earning the unconditional praise of Martin Scorsese – whose subsequent film Gangs of New York (2002) was aesthetically permeated by an Angelopoulos-like mood. Scorsese’s recognition vindicated the persistence of an auteur’s cinematic style, despite the domination of commercial blockbusters. A er this point, many prominent film scholars like Andrew Horton, Dan Georgakas, David Bordwell, Fredric Jameson and David Thomson, amongst others, started studying Angelopoulos’ work in the first collective volume on his work (Horton 1997). Andrew Horton’s lengthy monograph under the title The Films of Theo Angelopoulos: A Cinema of Contemplation (1999 [1997]) gave international impetus to the promotion and understanding of his films, oﬀering a coherent and systematic framework for their contextualisation and appreciation. Furthermore, over three decades Dan Georgakas’ essays systematically explored, with clarity and empathy, the ideological subtexts of Angelopoulos’ films and their aﬃnity with major global cinematic movements. In Greece, his success at Cannes in 1998 made Angelopoulos a ‘national treasure’, to be revered and parodied simultaneously. At this point, we must stress the continuous political and aesthetic elucidation of Angelopoulos’ films by his friend and associate, the film critic and cultural theorist Vasilis Rafailidis, an essential source for the appreciation of his work. Until his unexpected death in 2000, Rafailidis defended Angelopoulos’ films belligerently against their many cultural despisers; however, because of their acerbic tone, his essays on Angelopoulos’ films are marred by an aggressive fanaticism, despite their perceptive and sensitive interpretations. Ιn 2002, Angelopoulos, as the President of the Thessaloniki Film Festival, awarded its special grand prize, known as Golden Alexander, to the most important director of the old ‘commercial’ cinema, the vernacular auteur Yannis Dalianidis: a gesture of reconnection and reconciliation with the past of Greek cinema, as well as an act of recognition for the contribution Dalianidis made to the development of film culture. Angelopoulos’ late films, The Weeping Meadow/To Livadi pou Dakryzei (2004) and The Dust of Time/I Skoni tou Hronou (2008), were made possible\n\n26\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nwith international collaborations and productions. The Dust of Time, in particular, was a multilingual production across many diﬀerent countries, with the American superstar Willem Dafoe cast as its central protagonist. However, the presence of actors like Michel Piccoli, Bruno Ganz and Irène Jacob, among others, made it a site of contested equivocations, rooted in an uneasy coexistence of diﬀering styles, cultures and genres. While this film on its release generated renewed interest in Angelopoulos’ complex and ambitious experimentation with visual temporality throughout his career and showcasing him to the wider audience of American cinephiles, most reviews were reserved, if not hostile. In the so-called ‘years of crisis’, which began in 2009/10, and with the rise of what was misleadingly called the ‘weird wave’,2 spearheaded by Yorgos Lanthimos and Athina Rachel Tsangari, Angelopoulos became one of the most recognizable voices in the Greek media: a prophet lamenting the future of culture, cinema, Greece and Europe. He talked unequivocally about himself, sometimes conveying a sense of despair or even sentimentalism, which caused considerable consternation but also implied a confession of powerlessness and surrender, and indeed gestured towards a sense of an ending. From 1999, Angelopoulos had already fallen into a state of melancholic self-examination. ‘I want to make a film in the colours of rust,’ he said, ‘because of the melancholy I feel. Such melancholy is one of the dominant elements of our times since they all talk about collapse. Melancholy before the end of the century’ (Soldatos 2015: 214). Angelopoulos died 24 January, 2012 in an accident while working on his final film, The Other Sea/I Alli Thalassa. He had been checking the lighting of a tunnel at night but neglected to wear a yellow safety vest (a frequent symbol and omen in some of his films) and was hit by a motorcycle. With his death came the recognition that an entire historical period in the cultural creativity of Greece had ended. It was the ultimate expression of the demise of a cinematic movement that had dominated film production for decades and given Greece and Europe some of their most enduring images and stories. Directors, cinematographers, actors and film critics praised Angelopoulos for being so unique and therefore so isolated; an artist determined to do pure cinema untrammelled by commercial concerns, and without pretending to represent anyone other than himself and his personal vision of the cinema. He was the ultimate model of an auteur filmmaker who never made concessions to the expectations of audience or producer. A er his death, a number of significant studies and serious testimonials about Angelopoulos’ life and work were published. In 2015, Angelos Koutsourakis and Mark Steven edited The Cinema of Theo Angelopoulos, bringing together various lines of research on his work, including two\n\n27\n\nLife and Works\n\nshort but powerful studies by Nagisa Oshima and a brief introduction by Alexander Kluge (Koutsourakis and Steven 2015: 39–45). Kluge stated: ‘In film history, there is one sentence that is for me irrefutably true: the nonfilmed criticises that which is filmed’ (Koutsourakis and Steven 2015: x). How Angelopoulos managed to talk about the unfilmed through what he filmed is probably one of the most important and unanswerable questions regarding his work. Angelopoulos knew all too well his precarious and ambiguous position in the history of the cinema in both his country and the rest of Europe. In 1982, a decisive year for both himself as director in the middle of his career and for his country, he wrote a cryptic poem about the destiny of his work, which he later incorporated into his film The Suspended Step of the Stork: I wish you health and happiness but I can’t take part in your voyage. I am just a visitor. Everything I touch hurts me deeply. And then it doesn’t belong to me. There is always someone to say: ‘That’s mine!’ I don’t have anything that is mine . . . I arrogantly said one day. Now I’ve learned that nothing . . . is nothing. That we don’t even have a name. And that each time we need to borrow one. Give me a place to look at. Forget me in the sea. I wish you health and happiness.3\n\nThis is a strange confession by a director whose camera transformed absence and loss into profound visual revelations about the human predicament in history.\n\nThe Contextual Webs of History Throughout Angelopoulos’ career, the history of his country and of various ideological, political and aesthetical trends intersected on the filmic texts and subtexts of his work. Indeed, within his films one can detect the collective and the personal converging and diverging in many intriguing ways, transforming them into symbolic spaces of contested histories, aesthetics and visualities. Angelopoulos was born during one of the most turbulent periods in Greek history. His work is sometimes unfortunately interpreted as the visual representation of this time, and there are good reasons for this. In 1936, General Ioannis Metaxas imposed a fascist dictatorship, inflicting extensive political oppression and persecution on those he considered enemies of the state, especially communists, liberals and social deviants. This decade was culturally dominated by the so-called Generation of the ’30s, a modernist movement focused on questions of national identity and its aesthetic form, unoﬃcially led by the poet George Seferis. Against the background of the Asia Minor Catastrophe of 1922 and the mass wave of\n\n28\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nrefugees that sought refuge in Greece, the Generation of the ’30s debated liberals and Marxists on the ambiguity and elusiveness of ‘Greekness’ and the quest for national identity in all forms of artistic production. Having grown up in a neighbourhood full of Anatolian refugees, the predicament of displaced people was a constant theme for Angelopoulos throughout his entire career. At the same time, cinema had become the most important event for the socialisation of the newly urbanised population and was rapidly transforming into a large-scale industry. The process of ‘commercially industrialising’ Greek cinema began with the production of the first feature films, such as the famous Astero (1929) by Dimitris Gaziades, Daphnis and Chloe (1931) by Orestis Laskos, Social Corruption/Koinoniki Sapila (1931) by Stelios Tatasopoulos and later the first talkies, which were mostly costume dramas about an idyllic past in the countryside. Ideal ‘Greekness’ resided mainly in the villages and rural areas outside the traumatic spaces of urban centres, which were inhabited by anonymous industrial workers and refugees. Angelopoulos’ references in The Travelling Players to the costume dramas of this period take on a political and subversive character, forming the great underlying mythos of what he called ‘the deep Greece’. The remote rural land was beyond and above history; there, the trauma of the Asia Minor Catastrophe had never taken place, and the peasants enjoyed a life of pure innocence, in mythological atemporality, unstained by the fall into the confusing realities of urban alienation, industrial exploitation and existential fragmentation. Among Greece’s early directors, the unwi ing pioneer of direct cinema, Stelios Tatasopoulos, paved the way for many innovations in the practices of filming both in feature movies and documentaries. In his first work, he filmed real-life scenes of the underworld of drug dealers and prostitutes, which were embedded in the story. In 1951, Tatasopoulos repeated the use of amateur actors and a documentary style in his impressive neorealist film Black Earth/Mavri Gi, made on an impoverished island with a script that changed in situ according to the circumstances (reminiscent of Giuseppe De Sanctis’ Bi er Rice (1949) and Bunuel’s Los Olivados (1950)). The industry gradually established itself through the enthusiasm and dedication of people like the producer Filopoimin Finos and started examining the ambiguities of national identity, making the screen the only space in which its contradictions, conflicts and flaws could consciously and aesthetically materialise. Because many people were unable to a end school, there was a high illiteracy rate during this period; cinema became the only place where the population could be educated and entertained at\n\nLife and Works\n\n29\n\nthe same time while also functioning as the main site for socialisation and even politicisation. Angelopoulos’ childhood was marred by the brutal force of history. Between 1936 and 1944, the Monarchy was restored and the Republic replaced by the Metaxas dictatorship (during which the Greek-Italian War was fought), and the Germans invaded. In the capital, the Angelopoulos family experienced the famine brought about by the Occupation. He later confided that the silence that permeates his films is an a empt to replicate the silence he ‘heard’ when the Germans entered an empty and silent Athens on Sunday 27 April 1941. The Occupation was merciless, with famine, executions and collective punishments, but the situation became worse when the Germans le Athens on 12 October 1944, as the first manifestations of a civil war between communist partisans and conservative pro-British forces were becoming obvious. The terrible events of 3 December 1944 in Athens, in which British forces killed peaceful demonstrators without warning or justification, and the retaliation by the communists, remained deeply embedded in Angelopoulos’ memory and are found in some of the most emblematic scenes in The Travelling Players. The Civil War that ensued (split between two periods, 1946 and 1947– 1949) was to become the central mythopoetic temporal and spatial background for many of Angelopoulos’ movies, both actual and inferred. The ethical ambiguities that came out during that fratricidal conflict remained with him as both the political and existential realities in his films, especially those produced a er 1984. The moving, and tragic, reconciliation of the old opponents in Voyage to Cythera indicated a kind of closure to Angelopoulos’ own inner conflict about those sha ering events, which fractured not only the country’s body politic but also its cultural imaginary. The conflict had a profound personal impact on Angelopoulos as a young boy. During this period, between 1944 and 1945, Angelopoulos’ father was abducted by his nephew and sentenced to death by the procommunist terrorist militia. ‘My cousin, who was a communist, arrested my father and sent him to be executed. . . . With my mother we started searching for his body. We went to Peristeri [a suburb in Athens] where open fields existed full of dead bodies and searched through them. We didn’t find him. This marked me more than anything else in my life and made me aware of the reality around me’ (Archimandritis 2013: 19). Angelopoulos described time and again how he felt as he searched with his mother for his father’s corpse in the mortuaries around Athens. The quest for a lost father, indeed for one violently abducted and presumed dead, is one of the most salient psychological undercurrents of his films.\n\n30\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nAngelopoulos returned to these early traumatic memories in many interviews, including in 2009: Three months later I was out in the street playing. Suddenly I saw someone in rags approaching. It was my father. He was not executed. They had taken him hostage to Thebes. There, he was liberated by English tanks and returned to Athens on foot. I called out for my mother. I remember her, dressed in black, running towards him. They met in the middle of the street. A er a moment of total immobility, they came close to us. We went back in and started having soup – the only food available. Emotions were so intense that no one could say anything. This family reunion is the first scene of Reconstruction, my first movie. (Archimanditis 2013: 19–20)\n\nThose formative years between 1946 and 1961 are crucial to understanding Angelopoulos’ work. At first, the liberation brought immense hope to the Greek people, but it was soon followed by complete disillusionment. Because of the ruthless censorship imposed on the population by the victorious anti-communist conservatives, the atmosphere of persecution, mutual suspicion and generalised fear could only be expressed indirectly in the cultural production of the period, culminating with the famous The Ogre of Athens/O Drakos by Nikos Koundouros (1956), the only other Greek film that Angelopoulos ever praised unreservedly. Angelopoulos made this atmosphere of dark foreboding a central element in his cinematic imaginary, cemented by his own experience in cinema a er watching Michael Curtiz’s Angels with Dirty Faces (1938). When he saw the film in 1946 or 1947, he was emotionally scarred by the final scene in which the protagonist, played by James Cagney, screams ‘I don’t want to die’ as he is taken away to be executed. Angelopoulos says that the scene ‘haunted his nights for a long time. Cinema came into my life with an expanding shadow on the wall and a scream’ (Fainaru 2001: 125). What cinema could achieve became the focus of his intellectual and aesthetic quest. Despite his anti-Hollywood and anti-illusionist beliefs, which he expressed in many of his reviews, Angelopoulos’ connection with the formal accomplishments of Hollywood storytelling was deep, and he returned to its pa erns frequently in the final decade of his life. The end of the Civil War in 1949 did not end the bi er divisions in Greek society. Most le -wing intellectuals were sent to remote, arid islands, which functioned as internment camps and places of torture, humiliation and execution. The image of the exile returning home a er leading a dreadful existence on one of these islands is present in almost all Angelopoulos’ films. Cinematically, these tumultuous experiences are also present in the way that Angelopoulos rejected the dominant images of Greece as a country of subliminal sunshine and Mediterranean euphoria, as perpetuated through a national cinema of entertainment and facile\n\nLife and Works\n\n31\n\ncomic relief. On the contrary, for him Greek islands, indeed the whole Greek territory, were ‘memorials of death and loss, and their images were trauma-scapes: symbols of oppression, violence and exile’ (Tumarkin 2005: 12–20). Angelopoulos lived in Paris from 1961 to 1964. There, he encountered the Nouvelle Vague in all its festive rejection and jocular assassination of the dominant cinema de qualité, or the cinema de papa, and everything it had achieved. Angelopoulos singled out Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless/À Bout de Souﬄe (1960) as the film that changed the way he understood cinema. In an interview, he claimed that he had watched the film while he was still in Athens, at a movie theatre frequented only by working-class people and, at that moment, decided to become a filmmaker. French cinema was indeed at the centre of radical changes in the understanding, appreciation and practice of filmmaking, introducing a profound theoretical problematisation of the role of the medium and of the practices employed to construct cinematic visuality. Angelopoulos watched films by Godard, Claude Chabrol, Éric Rohmer, François Truﬀaut, Alain Resnais, Agnès Varda and Jacques Rive e, amongst others. The origins of Angelopoulos’ distinct directorial presence with his characteristic compositional pa erns, lighting arrangements and acting styles can be detected in the epistemological conversations of French cineastes about the connection between images and ideology, especially those featured in the magazine Cahiers du Cinema between 1959 and 1969. During his time in France, where he worked at the Cinematheque, headed at the time by Henri Langlois, Angelopoulos was actively imagining his own cinematic language. There he had the opportunity to watch Japanese, Italian, Russian and German films, especially those of Michelangelo Antonioni, Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman, Yasujirō Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi, Miklós Jancsó, Francesco Rosi and Pier Paolo Pasolini, along with the early movies of Bernardo Bertolucci and the later works of Roberto Rossellini. In his short homage to the Japanese master, Angelopoulos talked about the impact that Kurosawa’s Rashomon had on his cinematic thinking with its ‘overlapping narratives’, its fusion of ceremonial theatricality and the grandeur of emotions ‘as in the Greek tragedy’. In the pages of Cahiers and in the work of these directors, Angelopoulos encountered the theory of the director as the auteur of a film, which was a rebellion not just against the cinema de papa but also against the restrictions of the bureaucratised studio system. Against such impersonal perceptions of filmic representation, Angelopoulos raised the idiosyncrasy and the specificity of the individual. At the same time, he tried to avoid the idea of the director as superstar, expressing the Hollywood illusionist dramatisation of individualism.\n\n32\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nThe central idea that ultimately an auteur’s films exhibit the tension between his personality and the cinematic material (Sarris 1968: 32) can be felt in much of Angelopoulos’ work, although his collaboration with director of photography Giorgos Arvanitis was essential for developing his own version of the auteur. Upon his return to Greece and the establishment of the journal Democratic Change, we can see Angelopoulos starting to develop his own critical approach to local and international cinema. Maria Chalkou systematically studied Angelopoulos’ early film criticism and concluded: ‘Characteristic of his critical texts was his purely cinéphilic and surprisingly apolitical perspective. His writing was not didactic and he did not discuss the films in ideological, moral or political terms (dominant practices among his fellow critics) but only made occasional and brief comments on socio-political issues and with li le relation to Marxist ideas’ (Chalkou 2015: 25). It is important to point out the pre-existing critical projects within Angelopoulos’ cinematic thinking, most dominant among them the idea of the poetic cinema of the auteur. It is also interesting to note that a er he started making his own movies Angelopoulos abandoned film criticism, following the Cahiers principle that ‘the only true criticism of a film is another film’ (Bickerton 2009: 31). A er 1970, most of his thinking on cinema was geared towards elucidating his own work and constructing the conceptual framework for its proper contextualisation. Meanwhile, the country entered a tumultuous period of political instability a er the first centre-le government, elected in 1963, was overthrown in July 1965 by an ‘apostasy’, leading to a prolonged period of unrest that culminated in the imposition of the 1967 dictatorship. We cannot understand the development and evolution of Angelopoulos’ cinematic language without reference to the contextual restrictions imposed by the dictatorship of the Colonels. The military Junta lasted from 1967 to 1974 and played a pivotal role in the structural opaqueness of his early work, and in the form of the coded language he employed to address the oppression and persecution, and indeed the lack of freedom in general, not only for political experiences but also existential realities. During that period, the split in the Greek Communist Party revealed the looming crisis within the ranks of the le -wing believers, artists and activists. This crisis can be traced back to the thirties and the conflict between ‘Orthodox’ communists, who were loyal to Stalin and defended the Soviet Union, and dissidents like Pandelis Pouliopoulos, Agis Stinas and Cornelius Castoriadis, who initially sided with Leo Trotsky and the Fourth International. The ri between the groups grew deeper during the Civil War, when the hard-line communists turned against the dissidents in a vicious campaign of terror and extermination, and became even more\n\nLife and Works\n\n33\n\nmarked a er 1956 with the denunciation of Stalin’s personality cult and the invasion of Hungary. In 1968, the Greek Communist Party split into two groups: the interior and the exterior. Eventually, the former became aligned with what would be called Euro-communism and the la er remained faithful to Moscow. Nevertheless, political oppression and ideological divisions are not sufficient to explain the scope and the ultimate achievement of Angelopoulos’ early films. He came gradually to see himself as a figure of common acceptance: a true believer of the Le , fighting for social equality and political liberation. Until the end of his life, he maintained a humanistic commitment to this vision, coming ever closer to marginal political and ideological formations that privileged utopian politics and the anti-statist ideals of perpetual resistance. An understanding of the complexities of the Greek film industry, with its pa erns of production, its star system, studio codes, mechanisms of distribution and dominant genres, is also fundamental to an appreciation of Angelopoulos’ intervention in its main practices. Between 1945 and 1970, the industry had developed robust production dynamics, with prominent filmmakers working in a variety of genres and a multiplicity of ideological orientations and formal achievements. It was mostly organised around big studios and producers, like Finos Films, Spentzos Films, Karayiannis-Karatzopoulos, James Paris and others, who vied for popularity and commercial success. Actors like Melina Mercouri, Aliki Vougiouklaki, Ellie Lambeti, Mary Hronopoulou, Irene Pappas and many more had become the local stars of a thriving studio system that was commodifying their images. Some of them succeeded in becoming known beyond Greece. Melina Mercouri, for example, gained visibility through Jules Dassin’s Never on Sunday (1960) and Phaedra (1962) and was for a period in the late sixties quite famous worldwide as an activist and fashion icon simultaneously. Popular composers like Manos Hatzidakis, Mikis Theodorakis, Nikos Mamangakis, Yannis Markopoulos, Mimis Plessas, Kostas Kapnisis and others brought new perspectives to the function of the film soundtrack, with music and songs becoming integral to its formal aesthetics. They influenced pa erns of spectatorship in the period while also contributing decisively to the symbolic imaginary of a rapidly industrialised society. Specific musical styles were associated with specific genres in Greek cinema, and one of Angelopoulos’ main projects in his films of the seventies was to fuse different components and a ributes from various genres into unexpected formal juxtapositions. At the same time, the transition from a culture of books privileging the historical continuity and prestige of the Greek language to a culture of\n\n34\n\nThe Cinematic Language of Theo Angelopoulos\n\nimages still in search of structural parameters and iconography was one of the seminal realities during the formative years of Angelopoulos’ cinema. An astounding 117 films were produced in 1968 a er which their numbers began to dwindle with the arrival of television. The establishment of the Thessaloniki Film Festival in 1960 heralded a new era in the way the state promoted and simultaneously tried to control cinematic production. Accomplished directors like Yorgos Tzavellas, Gregoris Gregoriou, Michael Cacoyannis, Maria Plyta and Nikos Koundouros all constructed successful plot-structures with their own discursive identifications for general, and especially urban, spectatorship. The ‘plot-structure’ as a specific genre was mostly Aristotelian, keeping the unities of time, space and plot intact, and culminating, mostly, in happy endings. Actors also followed the Method Style as defined by the teaching of Konstantin Stanislavsky, Lee Strasberg and Elia Kazan, which asked for the total empathic identification between actors and their roles. However, even from the early sixties the first cracks in the system had started to show, and between 1965 and 1970 the dominant model was brought into question, particularly by Roviros Manthoulis and Alexis Damianos. Angelopoulos would dissociate himself completely from these models of production, screenwriting and acting style; consequently, it is easier to delineate his artistic genealogy outside the mainstream history of Greek cinema, and sometimes in opposition to it. As already mentioned, at the same time, going to the cinema created a vertical society, cu ing through all social classes, and the theatre itself became a place of socialisation and interaction between the old rivals of the Civil Wars throughout the country. Going to the movies, especially during the dictatorship, became not only a form of escapism but also an act of defiance and resistance, as all venues were under police surveillance. Subversive and anti-national films were only very rarely permi ed to be screened and even then people were ‘profiled’ for a ending. Overall, local film production was dominated by urban melodramas, technicolour musicals, gripping film noirs, derivative costume dramas and, soon, so porn. They were all based on linear, sequential narrative structures, oﬀering predominantly sentimental and feel-good escapism to an emerging middle class who were a empting to forget their peasant origins and cope with the traumas of immigration and urban anonymity. In in the early sixties, Takis Kanellopoulos, Manousos Manousakis, Dimos Theos and especially Roviros Manthoulis de-st"
