Every shot in every sequence of every film he has made bears his indelible artistic personality. A unique thematic pattern transcends his entire work. A short glance at any of the pictures he directed, at any point-beginning, middle, or end-is sufficient to reveal the identity of the author behind them. You may love his kind of cinema, admire it, and be fascinated by it, as many of us do. You may hate it, be annoyed by it, and find it boring, and there are as many-if not more-who feel that way about him. But whatever your opin­ ion of his work, you have to concede the presence of a distinct, determined, and precise guiding concept behind it all, both in form and content. While Angelopoulos remains a somewhat solitary figure in the world of film, his is one of the most significant voices in modern cinema. Born in Athens, Greece, in 1935, Theo Angelopoulos was a World War II child, growing up in a country constantly shaken by political turmoil, dicta­ torships, and civil wars which started before the war and went on long after it was officially finished. Many of these memories would eventually find their way into his films, particularly the disappearance of his father, arrested one day for no obvious reason, deported, and almost given up for dead be­ fore he returned home as suddenly as he had vanished. To fulfill the expecta­ tions of his middle class family, Angelopoulos dutifully entered the Athens Law School, but four years later, on the eve of graduation, he packed his suitcase and left for Paris to study cinema. After one rebellious year at the\n\nVIII\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nfamed IDHEC film school, he moved to the Musee de l'Homme to study with film ethnographer Jean Rouch, working at night as an usher at the French Cinematheque to support himself. A product of the idealistic sixties, he ab­ sorbed much of the insurgent spirit of the Paris student population, pre-1968. At the time, the radical left seemed to carry with it all the promises of a brave and better new world to come, once it defeated the old conservative spirit, and the duty of all good people was to struggle for its victory. The turmoil he found in Greece when he returned home only encouraged him to persist in this belief and to apply it to his own country. For a while, he wrote film reviews for a left-wing magazine, Democratic Change, until it was closed down by the regime. After one failed attempt to complete a first film, Forminx Story, and a short radio show satire, The Broadcast, he finally embarked in 1970 with a group of friends and no money to speak of on his first feature film, Recon­\n\nstruction. In a booklet published by the Greek Film Center for a 1998 London retro­ spective of his films, Angelopoulos, who divides his career into three distinct periods, describes the first as a time of \"historical, political films which coin­ cides with a more general ideological turmoil in Western Europe.\" Talking to the late German film critic Florian Hopf specifically about Reconstruction, he says that for him, \"the film . . . is an elegy for a land rotting away, abandoned by its inhabitants. It all started in 1962 when West German subsidies included the permission for Greek citizens to live and work in Germany. This issue was hotly debated at the time by both the right-wing and left-wing papers in Greece. Some claimed emigration is nothing less than a disaster; others be­ lieved it was rather positive, for if many workers went away, there would be no danger of an organized working class and therefore no resistance to the regime in power. The Colonels prefer, these days, to see all their opponents leave the country. All my friends, for instance, live abroad . . . unless they are in prison. It is for them that I made Reconstruction.\" Censorship was a major issue at the time; avoiding a direct confrontation with it, a major worry. In 1973, when The Days of '36 was screened by the Berlin Forum, Angelopoulos remarked to Ulrich Gregor, \"To tell you the truth, there is quite a bit of difference between the original script and the film, in its final form.\" He did not go much more into detail, for obvious reasons. However, to clarify the modern context of the film, he pointed out that \"our present political situation is not unlike the time when the King intervened in favor of [pre-World War II dictator General] Metaxas, after real-\n\nIX\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nizing the two leading parties were unable to reach an agreement on their own.\" He is proud to mention the film was made with the help of a rich acquaintance, who told him after the film: \"I don't care if I lose money on your film. The experience was worth it, through this film I learned a lot of things I did not know before.\" Unveiling historical truths for the eyes of the innocent is the role of political films, as far Angelopoulos is concerned. The culminating point of that first period was The Travelling Players, the perfect symbiosis of cinema art, innovative film language, history, politics, and elliptical statements. After its Cannes screening in a sidebar section, \"The Directors' Fortnight, \" Angelopoulos's international reputation was firmly established. The next time he visited Cannes, with The Hunters, he was already in the official competition, recognized as one of the new masters of the medium.\n\n. -\n\nAll through that period, the Brechtian influence, which has been an inte­ gral part of his personal vision since his stay in Paris, was pronounced in each of the films he made. Talking with Francesco Casetti about a specific shot in The Hunters, he explains: \"The . . . scene you mention is a long se­ quence shot showing two people making love, a group sitting around the table eating, the American woman walking in and offering to buy every­ thing, the politician undressing. By moving from one to the other in one sweeping camera movement, we reveal the many facets of one central situa­ tion and at the same time prevent the viewer from identifying with any of these facets, since he is j olted from one surprise to another. This way, we multiply one aspect while canceling another. This is what Brecht meant by alienation. \" A s time passed and the political conditions i n his own country and all over Europe changed, clear-cut notions of good vs. bad, right vs. wrong and particularly right vs. left, were invaded by vast areas of gray. Angelopoulos came to accept the fact that power corrupts not only on the right but on the left too. He made Megalexandros, he tells Sight and Sound in 1980, to show the danger threatening the transformation of any authority or power, regardless of how noble were its initial intentions, into despotism. Since that time, he implies again and again in many of his interviews that politics has become a cynical game and has turned its back on the commitments of the past. \"For a very long time we used to dream that politics was not a profession; it was a creed, a faith, an ideal. But in recent years, I have become convinced politics\n\nX\n\nI N T R O D U CT I O N\n\nis nothing more than just another profession, that's all, \" he tells Edna Fain­ aru in 1991, after the screening of The Suspended Step of the Stork. After completing Megalexandros Angelopoulos began to sense that his own role as an artist was about to change as well. Talking in 1985 about Voyage to\n\nCythera to Belgian critic Michel Grodent, he argues that the film is intended to \"offer the Greek audience a possibility to face the future without the trau­ mas of the past.\" His disenchantment with politics and its potential of doing any good becomes more pronounced. \"There is always a political interpreta­ tion to everything, but one shouldn't overdo it . . . . Since the normalization [in Greece] set in, we are looking for new approaches, and I have the feeling we are coming back to a kind of existentialism.\" And, just to show how Brecht is fading away, he adds: \"The world is a chessboard on which man is just another pawn and his chance of an impact on the proceedings, negli­ gible.\" In Angelopoulos's second period he retreats into personal histories, though always keeping the greater canvas of history in the offing. He notes that during this period \"history and politics move into the background . . . and the films focus more on the characters.\" Discussing The Beekeeper (1986) with Michel Ciment, he says: \"We are now living a major historical moment, waiting for the world to change but having no idea how and when this is going to happen.\" Explaining the transition from the general to the per­ sonal, he uses a phrase that he repeats often in later interviews: \"History is now silent. And we are all trying to find answers by digging into ourselves, for it is terribly difficult to live in silence.\" No wonder he sees in Voyage to\n\nCythera, The Beekeeper, and Landscape in the Mist a trilogy of silence-silence of history, silence of love, silence of God (see Gabrielle Schultz's interview for Die Zeit). To find the perfect visualization of this sentiment, one has to go deep into his third period, to a masterful sequence in Ulysses ' Gaze describing the ulti­ mate downfall of the communist dream in the grand funeral of a huge Lenin statue, tied down on a barge floating down the Danube. Peasants watching it from the shore uncover their heads and cross themselves-a clear indica­ tion that for them, communism and religion were not that different, what­ ever the official position of the party on that issue. Recently interviewed at home for this book, Angelopoulos said, \"For many years, there was a strong belief the world could and should be changed for the better, and violent means were often used on both sides in the attempt to put down those who\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nXI\n\ntried to bring about these changes.\" The annihilation of this dream is one of the sources for his bitterness. History was a disappointment. Those who be­ lieved in them, like himself, dearly paid for the ideals that could never come true. \"My generation was severely hurt by this violent conflict. We lived in Greece a civil war that left behind a country in ruins, both material and spiritual.\" The state of things today in Greece and in all the neighboring Balkan countries is the setting for the films of Angelopoulos's third period, which he describes as more existential, more centered on human fate. This period deals with borders, external and internal; exile, external and internal; the quest for a lost center-themes which recur like pieces of a great and painful elegy. In his last three films (The Suspended Step of the Stork, Ulysses' Gaze,\n\nEternity and a Day), he sees the fate of his protagonists and, through them, of Greece itself as inseparable from the rest of the region in which they live. \"Emigration and diaspora, refugees chased away from their own homeland, crossing borders and seeking shelter, these are among the most burning so­ cial issues of our time, \" he says. He may be referring to the catastrophes that have lately befallen this part of the world but which, he feels, are true on a universal basis. The title of the film The Suspended Step of the Stork refers to an officer who lifts one foot over the border and announces that if he puts it down on the other side, he will be shot dead. Borders are the evil to be abol­ ished. \"That was the real meaning of a united Europe, for me. The United States of Europe was our only hope to escape chauvinism and the hostility it breeds. Now it seems Europe is close to becoming one economic entity, but a united political entity seems very far away. And without it, it is very doubt­ ful that an economic union can survive.\" Politics, once a major driving force for his creative juices, is further losing its flavor. On the set of his last film,\n\nEternity and a Day, Angelopoulos tells Gideon Bachmann: \"If you were to talk to me about politics . . . I would have to tell you that I understand less all the time and in the end I understand nothing.\" The films of Angelopoulos are marked distinctively by his use of the se­ quence shot and by his obsession with cultural, historical, and political the­ matic matter. While these characteristics distinguish his films from those of his contemporaries, he has not emerged out of the blue. Angelopoulos often cites as inspiration the cinema of Michelangelo Antonioni. And, going fur­ ther back, he mentions Murnau, Mizoguchi, Welles, and Dreyer, who all fa­ vored the sequence shot as much as he does. But none of these filmmakers\n\nX II\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nhas been as consistent in visual and thematic choices, and none could claim, as Angelopoulos rightly does, that all his films are basically episodes in one single piece of work, each one engendering the next. For this reason, he says, not one of his films finishes with the classic closing, \"The End.\" And as long as he will continue to make films, the last word of each will be the first for the next. Angelopoulos's film language is based exclusively on the sequence shot, and he is a strong believer in the \"breathing shot,\" which should start a few seconds before the action it is supposed to depict and go on for a few more seconds after it is over. As he told Michel Demopoulos and Frida Liappas as early as 1974, while discussing Travelling Players: \"The basic principle govern­ ing all the film is the sequence shot, whether the camera is moving (which it is most of the time) or immobile. This way, the scenes gain much in depth and detail, with the editing being done inside the camera.\" He insists that the sequence shots allow him much more freedom of expression, though, he concedes, it doesn't make life very easy for the audience. Originally, he says, the sequence shot was an instinctive choice, the only way he felt he could make films. Recently, after being asked once again to elaborate, he explained that for him, cutting real time into small time pieces, reaching immediately for the climax of each scene and eliminating the breath at the beginning and the end of each shot, is a bit like raping the audience, forcing one's vision on it. His camera embarks on long, intricate, and elegant movements that go on and on, observing the characters and the landscape in which they live from all possible angles, but always from a respectable distance, and rarely indulg­ ing in anything even remotely similar to a close-up. \"I always fear those frames that practically scream 'Look at me! ' \" Another visual aspect of his films is the pervasive barren landscapes of northern Greece, dark skies, rain, cold weather. He has been known to stop shooting when the weather improves, postponing the entire shoot for the next winter if he does not manage to wrap it up before spring. Positifs Michel Ciment, one of his most ardent followers, suggested, when talking to him in 1987 about The Beekeeper, that this tendency reminds him of Antonioni's fas­ cination with the valley of the Po River in northern Italy. Angelopoulos him­ self provides many possible reasons for this choice of landscape (some you will find in the interviews selected for this book) but finally concedes: \"I have no explanation. I have often tried in the past to find one, but couldn't\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nXIII\n\nreally. Maybe one has to look far back. A psychoanalyst might unveil the real sources.\" Angelopoulos always shoots on real locations, never in a studio. In Greece there is not much of a tradition for studio work, and with his obsessive per­ fectionism, he does not even attempt it. But the actual locations, for him, are just a point of departure. \"I feel the need to transform a natural landscape into an internal landscape that I see in my imagination. I have houses re­ painted, sometimes even relocated; I build bridges that haven't been there before.\" The cutting in Angelopoulos's films baffles most traditional editors. Edit­ ing, as he has often pointed out, is done inside the camera, where the pace is established. The purpose of the editing table is just to check whether every­ thing went on as planned on the set. If not, the scissors won't help. The only solution is to shoot the whole thing all over again. The only real editing in Angelopulos's films is not for the image but for the sound, on which he lavishes enormous time and attention. \"The sound effects are never acciden­ tal; they follow a certain cadence in relation to each other. One could almost count the beats. Do you know, for instance, that the actors were indeed counting silently between one line and another?\" Usually one of the roles of the editing process is to put a degree of order in the film's narrative so that it is more accessible to the audience. But for Angelopoulos the things he will not say are as important as the ones he does. \"The ellipse is a tremendous option for the spectator to become the film­ maker's partner in the creative process.\" And for him, having the spectator as a partner is a condition sine qua non. \"It all depends on the spectator and to what extent he is willing to do his share of the work when he watches my film. The film supplies him with a certain amount of information, but it is only by completing it with his own input that he can hope to enjoy the film.\" As far as he is concerned, no concessions are acceptable. Discussing with the editors of Les Cahiers du Cinema the basic ingredients of Landscape\n\nin the Mist-two children on the road searching for their father-he almost fearfully remarks that \"differently shot and putting these qualities in evi­ dence, it could have been a tremendous commercial hit, \" an idea which evi­ dently does not appeal to him at all. Although the visual style is his most arresting feature, his thematic choices, his \"obsessions, \" as he has been known to call them himself, are as easily identifiable: the search for a father figure, the importance of his pres-\n\nXIV\n\nI N T R O D U CT I O N\n\nence or his absence, the father as a metaphorical concept and as a point of reference; the overwhelming importance of recent Greek and Balkan history and the way it affects the people who live in that part of the world, the attempt to recreate personal and historical truth out of fragments, little sto­ ries reflecting major historical events; the journeys all his characters embark on, the borders, the notion of exile, displaced persons searching for a place they can truly call home, and the trauma of the eternal return. The accents of these themes may change as time goes by, as the following interviews clearly show, but they are present throughout his work. \"All my obsessions enter and exit my films as the instruments of an orchestra do in a musical performance, they enter and exit, they fall silent only to re-emerge later. We are condemned to function with our obsessions. We make only one film. We write only one book. It's all variations and fugues on the same theme, \" he says in an interview made for the American press book of Eternity\n\nand a Day. A recurring element in almost every one of his films is the frequent refer­ ence to Greek mythology, notably the Odyssey, which has supplied the basic dramatic structure for many of his films. \"Greek people have grown up ca­ ressing dead stones. I've tried to bring mythology down from the heights and directly to the people\" he tells Tony Mitchell, discussing Megalexandros (which refers to the Oedipal myth) . Angelopoulos draws often from the Odys­ sey and from the myth of the Atrides, which was responsible for so much of the classic Greek tragedy. For instance, he has often mentioned that he sees the opening sequence of The Reconstruction as a modern replay of Ulysses coming home from his journeys. Voyage to Cythera is basically the story of Ulysses and Penelope, and of course, Ulysses' Gaze gives the mythological reference away in the title. The myth of the Atrides was used in The Travelling\n\nPlayers because it \"offered the option of a social unit that I could observe all through the period from 1939 and 1952.\" The analogy is there, but never forced. The only name from the actual myth that he uses in the film is the name of the son, Orestes. As for the rest of the characters, he concedes that their motivations are different and the circumstances are not the same. \"His­ tory affects them, changes and transforms them . . . this [the myth] helps me to define more accurately the historical space in which they are allowed to move.\" It is interesting to note that up until his fifth film ( Voyage to Cythera 1983), most interviewers focused on the purely intellectual aspects of his films.\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nXV\n\nThey discussed in detail aesthetic decisions, political opinions, historical background, but rarely entered into the personal life of the director. It was a kind of reticence which might be interpreted as an expression of respect for someone who was revolutionizing the basics of his art-something very few, if any, of his contemporaries could claim to do. From Voyage to Cythera on, as the films themselves became more personal, so were the questions. He often pointed out that the opening sequence of this film, showing the Ger­ man army marching into Athens, is based on an episode from his own child­ hood. Referring to the name of the father in the film, he tells Michel Grodent: \"Spyros was the name of my father. For me, it represents his entire generation. In the context of the film it does not have any significance, but I am very much attached to it. \" No significance, indeed? \"It is through the search for the father figure that we seek our way into the future and preserve our emotional balance,\" he says a bit later, in the course of the same inter­ view. And as time goes by, it becomes evident that his personal history is intimately intertwined with the films he makes. As already mentioned, one of his most traumatic childhood memories is the deportation of his father after the war. His return is the inspiration for the first scene of his first film,\n\nReconstruction. His leading characters often bear similarities to himself, as he will freely admit, and he sometimes reflects that \"maybe I am simply limited to my own experience, my traumas and my hopes, my own personal growth and evolution.\" Carrying the flag of the Greek cinema in the course of the last thirty years hasn't always been as pleasant an experience as one might imagine, particu­ larly for someone as outspoken as Angelopoulos is inclined to be. He has openly criticized various aspects of the Greek cinema (and not only cinema) . Many of his countrymen felt crushed under his personality and claimed he was obstructing their careers, leaving them no room to grow and develop on their own. Though at various times, the names of Cacoyannis, Kondouros, Voulgaris, and a few others gained a certain degree of notoriety, it is true that for the last thirty years, Angelopoulos has been practically the only one to consistently represent Greek cinema on the international scene. Naturally his long tenure at the top, over several generations, \"has generated some bitterness, not only among filmmakers but also among film critics, \" as he is quick to point out. But he wasn't always as philosophical about it as he is today. He once remarked rather bitterly to Tony Mitchell that the catch­ phrase of the 1979 Thessaloniki Film Festival was \"Death to Angelopoulos.\"\n\nXV I\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nAnd this \"love-hate relationship, \" as he calls it in the same interview, is not restricted to cinema only, for his criticism is directed at much larger Greek issues with similar results. Sometimes, he is exasperated enough to declare, as he did after The Suspended Step of the Stork: \"I'd like to act just like Mastroi­ anni in the film and announce that I am a political refugee in my home­ land.\" And indeed, two films later, in Eternity and a Day, his hero, a poet who bears an uncanny resemblance to Angelopoulos himself, says he has lived all his life in exile. But, on the other hand, Angelopoulos accepts that \"one can be critical of his own family without feeling the need to abandon it.\" From the interviews in this book, one easily sees that in the early stages of his career he considered himself a full member of the Greek film industry. But both he and his interviewers stop relating to him as such the better known he becomes internationally. At home, some of the bitterness toward him was generated by the feeling that he is crowding all the national prizes and state subsidies. Unfair, claimed some of his colleagues, less famous and often having to struggle to find the budget for their next films. However, the budgets for his films-though barely shoestring productions by Hollywood standards-have been, for many years, too expensive for the modest Greek industry, and since Megalexandros, they have all been co-produced by his own company with Western European partners. True, the Greek Film Center is always a major investor, but they could hardly find a better investment. His films, as difficult as they are, still attract specialized audiences abroad, and in Greece, audiences still make quite a fuss about each and every one of them. Most of the interviews for this volume were not originally published in En­ glish. Angelopoulos's insistence on film as art and resistance to the concept of film as entertainment has resulted in a very limited distribution of his films in Hollywood-controlled environments. In Europe, however, he is not only well known and appreciated; he is considered one of the pillars of mod­ ern cinema. This may explain why most of the interviews published here originated in countries that are familiar with his work and admire it, such as France, Italy, Germany or Israel, where most of his films since Megalexandros have had a commercial release. Everything you will read in the following pages has been translated at least once, more often twice. Since Angelopoulos himself speaks very little English, all his interviews are done either in Greek or in French, which he speaks perfectly. I realize the danger lurking behind\n\nI N T R O D U CT I O N\n\nXV I I\n\nthe old Italian saying traduttore-traditore (translator-traitor) . However, having known Angelopoulos for many years and having interviewed him quite often, I can say that it seems to me every single one of the interviews in­ cluded here does represent his thoughts. Two pieces of advice before you proceed to the interviews themselves. First, if you are just discovering Angelopoulos, you should probably start with the two Geoff Andrew contributions. Andrew is the senior film editor of the London TimeOut as well as a programmer of the National Film Theatre. Second piece of advise: these interviews shouldn't be read on their own. See the films, as many of them as possible, and you'll get so much more from the entire experience. Many people have helped this project come true. First and foremost, I thank Theo Angelopoulos and his spouse, Phoebe Economopoulou (also his producer), who opened their archives and allowed me to choose the most interesting material I could find there. Angelopoulos graciously took the time to grant me a very long interview and kept me updated on every subse­ quent one he made after that. I am no less indebted to the Greek Film Center and Voula Georgakakou, who were always willing to provide information and material; to Elly Petrides, who put together the Center's booklet accom­ panying the British retrospective of Angelopoulos's films; to Karin Mes­ slinger of the Berlin Forum, who gave me a hand with the translation of the Florian Hopf and Ulrich Gregor interviews; and to Gabrielle Schulz, who translated her own interview into English for my convenience. I would also like to thank my dear friend Alexis Grivas, who has been a source of informa­ tion and has lent a helping hand on every occasion, without my having to ask for it. Without their assistance, I doubt if this work would have been ever completed. And, of course, I would like to thank all of the original interviewers and publications that have graciously granted the permission to use their mate­ rial in the present volume. And I am especially grateful to my wife, Edna, who has covered Theo Angelopoulos and his films as extensively as I have, contributing one of the interviews and all the advice I needed in order to complete this book.\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n1935 1940\n\nBorn in Athens on April 27, to a family of merchants.

I had noticed several stories\n\nof this kind in the Greek papers dealing with women who had murdered their husbands. And in Epirus, the poorest and most backward region of our country, this seemed to be particularly frequent. I decided to go to the village in\n\nwhich a recent murder took place and investigate the case from the point\n\nof view of a journalist. I spoke with the inhabitants, with the family of the accomplice, with the children, and with the defendant's lawyer, who opened before us the minutes of the trial. This was the basis for my script, which used the murder as an excuse to portray life in a small Epirian village. Since\n\nI was not personally involved in the crime, not even as a witness-! was just a visitor from a big city in search of information-I felt it would be dishonest of me to turn it all into a fictional account. Something like Visconti's Ossessi­\n\none, which deals with a similar story. Reconstruction tries to approach the case on two different levels. The first offers as accurate a version as possible of the events, based on the testimonies I had collected myself and on the minutes of the trial; the second level is the police reconstruction with the participation of the guilty parties. The film functions, therefore, as a confron­ tation between the official version put together by the authorities and my version, presented in the form of a questioning. The plot moves constantly between these two elements in a manner that is quite different from a logical From the catalogue of the Intemationales Forum des Junges Films, Berlin 1971.\n\nc\n\n1971 by Inter­\n\nnationales Forum des Junges Films.

The simple truth is that the only money available there is the money sent home by the people who had emigrated to Germany. This film, for me, is an elegy for a land rotting away, abandoned by its inhabi­ tants. It all started in 1962 when West German subsidies included the permis­ sion for Greek citizens to live and work in Germany. This issue was hotly debated at the time by both the right-wing and left-wing papers in Greece. Some claimed emigration is nothing less than a disaster; others believed it was rather positive, for if many workers went away, there would be no danger of an organized working class and therefore no resistance to the regime in power. The Colonels prefer, these days, to see all their opponents leave the country. All my friends, for instance, live abroad . . . unless they are in prison. It is for them that I made Reconstruction. For all those who have already left and those who are about to. And there is something else. Epirus has a rich and very old history and culture, its roots going back to antiquity. It is terri­ bly sad and upsetting to watch impotently as so many people are leaving this land, for once they go away, a whole civilization ceases to exist. a :\n\nHow did they survive there before the wave of emigration.\n\nA :\n\nOf course it wasn't easy, but one way or another, they did it. In any case,\n\nGreeks are a nation of emigrants. At the turn of the century, half of them went to America. There are one and a half million Greeks in the U.S. There are already 30o,ooo in Germany. They are everywhere, and instead of con­ tributing to Greek economy at home, they are working for others. The Americans are coming into Greece now, claiming they wish to industrialize the country, but of course they will do it only if it is profitable for them. And\n\nF L O R I A N\n\nH O P F/ 1 9 7 1\n\n5\n\nGreece, for many, is now the fifty-first state of the Union. Five months ago, two Americans raped a sixteen-year-old Greek girl. They were acquitted when they came up with the perfect alibi: they were never in Greece, they badn't left the States at all. a:\n\nYou are implying Greece is a Third World country.\n\n,. : That is the way things are. The Third World is not limited to Africa and Latin America. If you ask me, it includes Greece and Turkey too. We do not belong to the West, we are not part of Eastern Europe-we live at the cross­ roads of modern civilization. However, we happen to occupy a strategic point in the Middle East; therefore, we are important to American politics. Had it not been the case, their attitude towards us would have been com­ pletely different. a\n\n:\n\nA :\n\nHow was Reconstruction produced? Like every other independent production in Greece. To begin with, the\n\nproducer is not really a producer; he is a film technician. He works for com­ mercial productions but is a socially conscious person. He worked, for a while, with the professional unions, but not any more. He wants to do some­ thing else. All we had, when we started Reconstruction, was a small invest­ ment, contributed by a cousin of his and another friend. Altogether, when we started shooting, the budget was on the order of something like 2,500 German marks, but before we finished, it went up to 46,ooo marks. a\n\n:\n\nA :\n\nAny previous experience as a director? I made a short that was highly praised by the critics, about the alienation\n\ncreated by radio, television (though we still don't have it in Greece), and publicity. But let's go back to Reconstruction. We started with a crew of five persons: the producer, the cameraman, an assistant cameraman, a produc­ tion manager who also filled in as script editor, and myself. There were only two actors, neither one of them professionals. One of them was a barman, the other, unemployed. He had been sent to j ail for political reasons and once released, after two years, couldn't find any work. We were the first to offer him a paying j ob. All the other people in the film are peasants we found on the spot. Even the woman who plays the lead is an amateur; in real life she is a seamstress. I chose her because she fit the part, not physically, but psychologically. She was great, but she couldn't either read or write.\n\n6\n\nT H EO\n\nA N G E LO P O U LO S :\n\nI N T E RV I EWS\n\nDid you write down the dialogue and have the actors learn them by heart or did you rely on improvisation? a :\n\nA\n\n:\n\nEverything was written beforehand, most of it before we started shoot­\n\ning, and then inserted into the script. There isn't one improvised line in the film. a\n\n: How did you manage on such a small budget?\n\nA :\n\nWell, it was like this. We had 9,ooo meters of raw material, and we had a\n\nsoundman who claimed he could manage without an assistant. Once he set up his equipment, he would handle the microphone and trust the tape re­ corder to work without supervision. We shot for twenty-five days, regardless of the weather. As a matter of fact, it was raining most of the time, so we didn't have much of a choice. We were invited to stay with the peasants in their homes, and we somehow managed to scramble some food. Lights, there were none. Only a handheld lamp, a soo kw transformer, two batteries, and a small, portable power generator rented for the occasion. We also had a small truck we used to move our equipment around and sometimes to sleep in. a : A :\n\nWhat are the conditions of Greek cinema today? My film has the lowest budget of any film produced in Greece. But it is\n\nnot one of a kind. There was a time when cooperatives were making films on very low budgets. In most cases, for this kind of film, the persons involved have to use their own money. There is no State subsidy and no producer who would be interested in a film like mine. And it's a pretty risky business, too. Whoever puts his own money in a film and doesn't get it back-as it is mostly the case-will never do another film. Three or four major companies control the Greek cinema and distribution, and they are not interested in this type of film. a :\n\nHow many films are annually produced by these companies?\n\nA :\n\nIt varies-from fifteen to a maximum of thirty for each of these compa­\n\nnies. These are pretty expensive productions, all of them featuring the Greek stars of the moment. a :\n\nHow many cinemas do you have in Greece?\n\nA :\n\nPlenty, because we still do not have television. There are some 200 cine­\n\nmas in Athens only, and close to 2,ooo all over the country.\n\nF L O R I A N\n\n:\n\na\n\nA :\n\nH O P F/ 1 9 7 1\n\n7\n\nHow was Reconstruction received in Greece? The press screenings were tremendously successful and everybody was\n\nconvinced that it would be a box-office success. But the trouble was that I couldn't find a cinema to show it in. The exhibitors had made up their minds to boycott it. a : A :\n\nWho are these exhibitors? All sorts of people, united in their common interests with the distribu­\n\ntors. They make a lot of money by keeping their screens available for the people who provide them with films all year long. a : Do you mean you have theater chains controlled by major producers, who are showing only the films made by these producers? A\n\n:\n\nTo find a distributor, someone like me would have to hand the film over\n\nto him. But since distributors realize that such a film would compete with their own productions, they prefer to forget it on the shelf. a\n\n:\n\nHow many films are made in Greece, altogether?\n\nA\n\n:\n\nOverall, we have an annual production of approximately 120 films. But\n\nmany of them are never released in Athens; they go into general release with­ out a proper first run. You have to keep in mind that Greece still has many analphabetics, people who cannot read subtitles. Also, in Greece the ent�re family goes to the movies, which means that any film restricted to adult audiences is automatically doomed to fail. Therefore, the only option is to make family pictures, where adults can go with their children. a:\n\nWhat did finally happen to Reconstruction?\n\nA:\n\nSome 6so,ooo people have seen it until now. To put it in perspective,\n\nfilms featuring our leading stars reach r.s million admissions.\n\nAnyway, your performance is quite remarkable. Do you believe it could have done even better? a:\n\nA :\n\nLet's consider a simple fact. I am showing my film in one cinema, not\n\nvery central, while the others are releasing their films on fifteen screens. Even\n\nif it is a flop, there will still be a few hundred people, living next to the dnema, who will come to see it. Doesn't seem to be very much, but it counts, nevertheless.\n\n8\n\nT H EO\n\nA N G E LO P O U L O S :\n\nI N T E RVI EWS\n\na : Do you mean that no distributor will accept the fact that a film he hasn 't produced could generate profits? A : I have screened Reconstruction for the biggest distributor in Greece. After\n\nten minutes, he stood up and said, \"I am not interested.\" He didn't even stay till the end. But it is quite possible I will find a big distributor for my next film, on one condition: that he believes there is a chance of selling it abroad. a :\n\nHow about censorship?\n\nA :\n\nWe were not sure that once the film was finished, it would be cleared by\n\nthe censors. As a matter of fact, we feared they would ban it. Therefore, I first screened the film for the critics. a :\n\nBefore the censors had seen it?\n\nA :\n\nExactly. The next day, they all wrote that they had seen a masterpiece.\n\nBecause of this enthusiasm, the censors had to let it go. They did not feel like running the risk of a public outcry in case they banned the film. a :\n\nA\n\n:\n\nDid they touch it at all? No, but we had quite an argument with the Ministry of Interior, who\n\nwanted to cut it.\n\nUnveiling the Patterns of Power:\n\nThe Days of '36 U L R I CH G R EGO R /1 9 7 3\n\na\n\n:\n\nA :\n\nWhat is the historical background of your film? It is based, more or less, on real facts. A convict used a gun to take hos­\n\ntage a right-wing Member of Parliament who visited him in his cell. Later it turned out the two knew each other for a long time, though the nature of their relations was less than clear. Was there some kind of agreement be­ tween him and the convict? Nobody knows. The convict writes to his friends: \"I am going to kill him and then kill myself; there are no documents proving they have ever arrested me.\" But since the hostage was a pretty well known personality, the case triggered a very complicated reaction. There was great anguish in the political circles, particularly in the right, since the hos­ tage was one of them. The government was directly concerned. I should mention that at the time, General Metaxas was ruling the country. He had acceded to power through the support of the right wing and center that had joined forces in his favor. Neither one of the two could rule the country on its own, since they had an equal number of votes, while Metaxas himself had only seven seats in the Parliament and the communists had fifteen. Since the two leading parties wanted to keep the communists out of the game, they agreed to let Metaxas take over. This Metaxas was a great admirer of Musso­ lini and had all sorts of shady dealings with Goebbels, who made a special trip to Greece just to visit him.

Translated by Dan Fainaru.\n\nT H E O\n\n1 0\n\nA N G E L O P O U L O S :\n\nI N T E RV I EWS\n\no :\n\nDid the murder of the union leader have anything to do with the case?\n\nA :\n\nNo. I introduced it into the story. That is, I put together a number of\n\nevents. The jail incident is a true one, and so is the murder of the union leader, though it happened a bit later. I put them together to give a better idea of the political climate during that period. The plot, however, is concen­ trated in the space of a few days only. o\n\n: A few but very significant days, they represent the entire period.\n\nA :\n\nExactly. It is perfectly clear I am dealing with a time in Greek history\n\nwhen the actions of the workers parties were beginning to become effective. Strikes and demonstrations were everyday occurrences. Briefly, the kind of climate that would be difficult to describe today, given our political situa­ tion. Going back to Metaxas, the two parties had enthroned him despite his being a real fascist, following in the tracks of earlier previous dictators. He did not make any effort to dissimulate his positions, and he had no scruples declaring that under his guidance, Greece would never face the risk of an­ other autocracy. The King (joining forces with Metaxas and the British) wanted stability at any price, even if this meant opening the door to a dic­ tator. o :\n\nAnd indeed, you have an Englishman in your film.\n\nA :\n\nYes, and he talks about dictators and interventionism. \"As far as I am\n\nconcerned, I am against any strong-arm intervention, \" he claims. Theoreti­ cally, maybe. For he adds: \"I have to agree however that there are certain situations . . . in a number of underdeveloped countries . . . , \" and he never finishes the sentence. But it is clear from his tone that he is in favor of inter­ vention.\n\nDo you think the Greek audience identifies the characters in your film? For instance, do they recognize Metaxas?\n\no :\n\nA\n\n:\n\nNo doubt about Metaxas. Also the Member of Parliament. The character\n\nin my film is very close to the real person. He is vaguely homosexual and that is how I portrayed him. He is very elegant, has a certain kind of body language . . . briefly, he is easy to identify. No wonder the real person, who is still very much alive, is furious. o : Given these elements, the audience may very well draw some up to date conclu­ sions?\n\nU L R I C H\n\nA\n\n:\n\nG R E G O R/ 1 9 7 3\n\n1 1\n\nIt is true that our present political situation is not unlike the time when\n\nthe King intervened in favor of Metaxas, after realizing the two leading par­ ties were unable to reach an agreement on their own. The kind of political situation that could lead to a takeover by a certain Mr. X, just like it was the case with Metaxas. a : A\n\n:\n\nHow did you manage to produce the film? One of my friends used to teach at the Greek Film School. He had a\n\nstudent whose husband-a rich man-was an admirer of Reconstruction. He said he would like to finance one of my films, and I took him up on the offer, that's it. We became friends and shared the same political opinions. His po­ litical awareness vastly changed as we were making the film. He told me later: \"I don't care if I lose money on your film. The experience was worth it, through this film I learned a lot of things I did not know before. \" He wasn't the type of producer who would say, \"Your film didn't make a penny. \" I used the same crew I had in Reconstruction, slightly larger since there was a bit more money. Some of the actors were professionals, the rest amateurs. a : Do the Greek censors read the script or do they only look at the finished product? A : Scripts are supposed to be checked by the censors, but we managed to\n\nslip it through. To tell you the truth, there is quite a bit of difference between the original script and the film in its final form. The scene of the Englishman was not in script, nor the murder of the union leader. As a matter of fact, there was no mention of a union leader, j ust of some person who had been murdered. a :\n\nOnce finished, did the film encounter any censorship problems?\n\nA :\n\nSome. I prefer not to go into details; it would be silly of me, since I have\n\nthe intention of continuing to make films in Greece. The main thing is that\n\nThe Days of '36 was released. a\n\n: I believe the first screening was at the Thessaloniki Film Festival.\n\nA :\n\nIndeed, and it was enthusiastically received by the audience and the left­\n\nwing parties. The ones who were really angry were the center parties. They felt my portrayal of the parliament at the time was embarrassingly suggestive of the present regime of the Colonels.\n\n1 2\n\na : A :\n\nT H EO\n\nANG E LO P O U L O S :\n\nI N T E RV I EWS\n\nWho are these people? Neither the liberals nor the center left. These are the people who lost all\n\ntheir privileges after the Colonels rose to power, and this includes some of the right-wing people. The parliamentary regime generated a certain number of social changes. People with vast fortunes have seen their profits curtailed and lost their place to others. Government officials are being paid the double of what they made before. The same for the police, whose condition before had seemed hopeless. Since many were forced to retire, there were plenty of possibilities to grab a government office. a :\n\nAre we talking about a class of bureaucrats?\n\nA :\n\nExactly.\n\na : I understand the screening of Reconstruction by the German television has been ofgreat help to you. A :\n\nTrue. And the same goes for the prize I was awarded in France. Also the\n\nscreening of the film by BBC in England. Greece is a small country; for them I am now an important person. Someone with an international reputation you can't throw arbitrarily into jail.\n\nDoes it mean there is a chance for artistic and cultural activity in Greece today?\n\na :\n\nA :\n\nIn any case, we're trying to work in this sense . . . . Take for instance\n\nSynchronos Kinematographos, a film magazine in which I am not personally involved. It could be easily defined as a para-marxist publication, at least it is evident to me.\n\nYour film 's style is very elliptical. There is always something the audience won 't find on the screen and will have to fill in on its own.\n\na :\n\nA :\n\nIt's one way to go beyond naturalism, as Dreyer used to say. The ellipse\n\nis a tremendous option for the spectator to become the filmmaker's partner in the creative process. It also offers a kind of \"Brechtian alienation\" that depends not only on the position of the camera, but also on the structure of the film. Every film is made up of a number of individual blocks that-to use Brecht's definition-are autonomous, but they all depend on each other. The point, evidently, is to follow an almost naturalistic course in order to better underline the realism of each sequence. For instance, by striking a certain\n\nU L R I C H\n\nG R E G O R/ 1 9 7 3\n\n1 3\n\npose, the character about to be murdered breaks through the apparent natu­ ralism of the moment and becomes realistic. a : This apparent naturalism is evident in the very careful way you draw each one ofyour characters. A : With an intentional pinch of irony. I tried to use satire for the portrait\n\nof this bunch of goons that were ruling the country. Also, I had to keep in mind the formula of political cinema that emerged after the films of Rosi and Costa Gavras. The Days of '36 is the opposite of Z. In Gavras's film there is a clear distinction between heroes and villains. The same goes for the situa­ tions. Everything is predictable, it fits in with the middle-class ideology. My films are trying to be more hybrid, without a beginning or an end. I attempt to introduce a sort of \"anti-suspense\" ritual, something of the kind Oshima created in Death by Hanging, recently released in Greece.\n\n: You mentioned earlier Dreyer, even quoted him. Have his films had any influ­ ence on your work? A : No. The only film of his I know is The Passion ofJeanne d'Arc. Dies Irae is a\n\nbeing released now in Greece but I haven't seen it yet. I read some of his declarations in the Greek press, and I was referring to them. If you are look­ ing for an affinity, it is more in the direction of Godard you should look. He had a certain influence on me . . . and on the other filmmakers of my genera­ tion. At the early stages, there was also a touch of Antonioni, and then Go­ dard.\n\n: I heard there is a new generation of cinephiles in Greece, and they are inter­ ested in modem cinema. A : True. We get to see now all the important new films, like Oshima's The Ceremony or Straub's Othon. It doesn't matter whether they like them or not, a\n\nthe main thing is that they discuss them. In a few days, we'll have a strike here, caused by the competition between cinema and television. The theaters are empty, and the strike will protest against the exorbitant taxation of the cinemas. These type of demonstrations are familiar in Western Europe, but in Greece they are just beginning.\n\nI'd like to go back to your film. What is the significance ofthe boys distributing leaflets?\n\na :\n\nT H E O\n\n1 4\n\nA\n\n:\n\nA N G E LO P O U LO S :\n\nI N T E RVI E W S\n\nIt's another reference to the political climate at the time. Since it was\n\nprohibited to distribute leaflets, they had to be given away like this. In the context of the film, it is supposed to mean that on the one hand there is a law, but on the other hand, there are young people willing to take the risk and challenge it. It's another way of underlining certain aspects of the re­ gime. o\n\n:\n\nThree government officials are shot in the last scene.\n\nA\n\n:\n\nExecutions were by hanging, before the dictatorship. But in practice,\n\nthey killed people any old way. Public opinion found this out only after the demise of Metaxas, during WW2. o\n\n:\n\nA\n\n:\n\nWhat about Pindar's text? Mussolini ransacked Roman classics for his fascist propaganda; in Greece\n\nfascists did the same with Greek classics. During Metaxas's stay in power, they used to refer to the three great civilizations. The antiquity, the Byzan­ tine era, and the Metaxas civilization. They quoted old texts that no one understood to justify their positions-it was all a mumble-jumble of mean­ ingless words, nothing more. : The film is often ambiguous. For instance, who is the murderer of the union leader?\n\no\n\nA\n\n:\n\nNo one knows. All we know is that the suspect was one of the persons\n\nwho shot at the people marching. The point was not to show who pulled the trigger but to indicate that he has done it together with many others who could be considered equally responsible. o : Your film does not offer a concrete analysis of the political facts, in the current sense of the word. There is a lot you left out, to be completed by the audience, and this adds to its ambiguity. A\n\n:\n\nIndeed, for, as I said before, what I was looking for was a certain climate.\n\nA reign of terror. People claim their innocence by accusing an innocent per­ son. No one achieves his purpose. The patterns of power are unveiled as they reach their inexorable conclusion-to kill. For me, this is shocking: the state eliminates a person without giving him the benefit of a court of law to prove his innocence. All means are acceptable-poison, for instance-as long as it terrifies the people.\n\nU L R I C H\n\nG R E G O R/ 1 9 7 3\n\n1 5\n\nThere is a certain similarity here with the American gangster movies. Some of the characters seem to be lifted out of them. a\n\n:\n\nA\n\n:\n\nTrue. The murderer is dressed just like the gangsters in the thirties. The\n\nreference is even clearer, because the person is a policeman but at the same time, he is one of the gangsters, known in the underworld as \"Valentino\" because of his resemblance to the movie star. In the picture, whoever tries to speak up is immediately wiped out. Only the diplomats are free to express themselves. The same goes for the mother of the MP, but then she is one of the rich and powerful. No one would touch her. a\n\n:\n\nClass struggle?\n\nA\n\n:\n\nI prefer to avoid this cliche. The film deals with a certain, specific class\n\nat a certain, specific point in history. The previous generations were freedom fighters, while their sons . . . . \" There are many families of this kind in Greece. After WW2, they married into money, bringing for their dowry the reputa­ tion of their name. Let's face it, the fate of Greece is decided by no more than 200 families. Onassis, for example, intended to put up a temple in the center of Athens in memory of his son, as if the city of Athens belonged to him . . . . a :\n\nA\n\n:\n\nWas The Days of '36 finally released commercially? Yes. Some so,ooo admissions in Athens and altogether I believe we'll\n\nreach Ioo,ooo in the entire country. For Greece, it isn't very much. a :\n\nA\n\n:\n\nDid you get any state subsidies? Not a penny. But they did not forget to collect the taxes, which in Greece\n\nare so% of the ticket price.\n\nA journey through Greek Landscape and History: The Travelling Players MI CHEL DEMOPOULOS FR I DA\n\nAND\n\nLIAPPAS /197 4\n\nWhen did you decide to shoot The Travelling Players, and what were the political circumstances at the time? a :\n\nA :\n\nWe launched the film during the so-called liberalization period of Mar­\n\nkensinis, that is on the eve of the Polytechnic events. In any case, since the film deals with the 1939-52 period and refers to all sorts of unmentionable historical episodes, the Papadopoulos censors wouldn't have been very likely to approve it. Nevertheless, we decided to go ahead and shoot the film. Shortly before we started, the Polytechnic incidents erupted in all their vio­ lence followed by the Ioannides putsch. At this point we wondered whether it was worth making a film that might very well never be shown in Greece. And what would be the sense of such a decision? We discussed the matter with the producer, and he agreed with us that even if the film was to be banned in Greece, it would achieve its purpose through the echoes of its screenings abroad. In january and February 1974, as the terror was reaching its peak, we decided to go ahead with the film. We were prepared to make our film disregarding any censorship threats whatsoever. a : A :\n\nWhat was the original idea? I first thought about a travelling company touring the smaller towns\n\naround the country. A j ourney through the Greek landscape and history, following a group of actors from one town square to the next.

I used an existing formula-father, son, mother, lover, their children . . . power . . . murder-which functions both as a myth and as a basis for the plot. It was a liberating decision, since I had made up my mind from the very beginning this was not supposed to be a lesson in history. The myth of the Atrides offered the option of a social unit that I could observe all through the period from 1939 to 1952. The Days of '36 revealed the portrait of a dictatorship. The Travelling Players is a kind of se­ quel, giving names and specifications to this portrait. It goes up only until\n\n1952, because I believe that year's massacres put an end to the civil war and consecrated the triumph of the right wing and the victory of Papagos. That is, the story covers the period between the overt dictatorship of a general to the veiled dictatorship of a field marshal, who was viewed by many Greeks, exhausted by all the catastrophies they had experienced before, as a liberator. There were a number of obstacles I had to overcome in order to achieve my purpose. First, to combine all these elements into one structure, but also to avoid conventional scenes of the kind you encounter so often in these cir­ cumstances: hunger, death, persecutions, etc. For this reason, the film begins in 1952 with Pagagos's election campaign. I wanted to portray the generation of the Resistance, the people who were against the Metaxas dictatorship, who fought in WW2, who joined the National Front of Liberation and retreated later into the mountains. All those who were forced by the events to take a stand and, finally, were considered the \" Resistance generation\" from the left­ ist point of view, naturally. Three persons represent this generation in the film : the older 1939 militant and two younger persons suspected of sympa­ thizing with this man and his opinions. All three of them j oin the Resistance and are arrested. One of them is deported and released in 1950 after signing an anti-communist declaration. The second is executed in 1951 for refusing to give up the armed struggle. The third falls ill in prison, is released for \"health reasons, \" and will carry with him the \"revolution trauma\" for the rest of his life. Time has stopped for him in 1944; he constantly projects the events of that year into the future. The entire picture bears the stamp of this trauma. All the characters suffer from it. Some have signed the declaration, others have died in prison or lost their minds.\n\nYou claim you used the myth of the Atrides to avoid the artificiality of a con­ ventional arbitrary form. Aren't you worried that such a myth, so deeply entrenched\n\na :\n\n1 8\n\nT H E O\n\nA N G E LO P O U LO S :\n\nI N T E RV I EWS\n\nin the cultural traditions of our civilization, would create an opposite effect, by imposing on the film an inexorable fatality? You obviously wish to use the myth as an historical model, but it could lead to the wrong conclusions. Some people might take the film as another interpretation of the myth. A :\n\nTo begin with, the presence of the myth is not that evident in the film.\n\nWe do not use names, there is no Agammemnon, no Electra, no Pylade, not even a Nikos or Pavlos. The onlr name in it is Orestes, who for me is a con­ cept more than a character: the concept of the revolution so many dream of. The affection many of the characters lavish on him represents their yearning for the ideal notion of the revolution. Orestes is the only one who remains faithful to himself and his goals, and is willing to die for them.\n\nIsn't there a risk in identifying your protagonists with the heroes of the myth (Electra, Orestes, Egistus, Agammemnon, Clitemnestra) and then placing them in a different historical context? a :\n\nA :\n\nThe motivations are different, the circumstances are not the same. His­\n\ntory affects them, changes and transforms them. All I did is sketch them, and this helps me to define more accurately the historical space in which they are allowed to move. In the film, Egistus is a militant for the August 4 party and finds himself involved in pseudo-collaboration with the Germans. The concept of power is revealed in him by his attitude to the other actors, after the death of Agammemnon. Attempting to analyze his personal motivation would lead to a psychological drama about the primal reasons that made Egistus what he is. And that does not interest me at all. What I was trying to achieve is a kind of Brechtian epic, where no psychological interpretation is necessary. a :\n\nHow did you put the script together? How did you use the myth in it?\n\nA :\n\nFirst of all, I tried to use the 1952 events as a point of departure. From\n\nthat point, I looked back, but not in the classical flashback tradition, because these are not personal recollections of one definite character, but collective memories, giving me the freedom to plant inside the 1952 sequence certain historical episodes from the past. The first scene takes place in 1952, the last in 1939. As you can see, I am progressing in the opposite direction. In the final scene we see all the characters who participate in the film. Some of them, we know, have been already killed in action; others are in j ail. The survivors are old by now; they have broken up, have been barely released\n\nM I C H E L\n\nD E M O P O U LO S\n\nA N D\n\nF R I DA\n\nL I A P PA S / 1 9 7 4\n\n1 9\n\nfrom prison. They walk towards each other, they stop in front of the camera, and we hear the text of the beginning: \"In the summer of 1939 we reached Aigion. We were exhausted, we hadn't slept for two nights. \" The only differ­ ence is the year-instead of 1952 in the opening scene it is now 1939. The characters here are still full of hope for the future, but we know what is in store for them. It's like an old family picture we look at, knowing only too well what is going to happen to each of the persons in it. a\n\n:\n\nA :\n\nHow did you select the historical events you wanted to show on screen? The choice of some dates and events is evident at first glance. The first\n\n\"historical fact\" we run into, in 1939, is the declaration of WW2. This \"fact\" affects everybody and is therefore introduced at a popular festivity, the actors and many other people being there at the same time. The German victory is represented by the capitulation of a small Greek garrison. The Liberation is seen through a popular revolt. Later, in December 1944, we have the mea­ sures against possession of weapons, the civil war, and the elections of 1952. Also, when selecting the events, I preferred those I found to be most repre­ sentative of Greek characteristics. For the 1944 events, it was the people in the street and the dimensions of their reaction I was concerned with, not the governmental decisions as such. The people consider December 1944 as their revolution, a revolution that was cut off in the middle, before it reached its natural conclusion. Why? My film does not offer a straightforward answer to the question, but there is plenty of evidence in it to find the answer. For instance, why didn't the ELAS [The Greek Popular Army of Liberation] reach Athens? And there are more events we all know are part of the historical background of that period. Everything is shown through the perspective of simple people-the same people who have to bear the effects of these events. The film is a popular epic much more than an analysis of recent Greek his­ tory. a\n\n:\n\nUnlike your first two films, the erotic element is of major importance in The\n\nTravelling Players. What is its significance in relation to the political elements in\n\nthe picture? A :\n\nThe sexual element is integrated in the characters. Clitemnestra's affair\n\nwith Egistus and Electra's reaction are all based on their respective personali­ ties. There is however a point when these relations stop being only personal, for Egistus is more than just the lover of the mother. He is also a traitor. He\n\n2 0\n\nT H E O\n\nA N G E L O P O U LO S :\n\nI N T E RV I EWS\n\nis killed not only because of his affair with Clitemnestra or because he has successfully ridded himself of Agammemnon, but for betraying Agammem­ non and his son to the Germans. Electra's rape is a political act as well. I believe that at the origins of every act of violence there is some kind of sexual impulse. Since Electra is raped in interrogation, the act becomes automati­ cally political. The film also introduces the concept of prostitution. Chryso­ temis is a prostitute who later marries an American soldier. This kind of marriage may solve a certain problem, but at the same time it represents the bankruptcy of moral values. The sexual element is therefore transferred to a political-ideological level.\n\na : What does the stage play Golfo the Shepherdess, produced by the players in your film all over Greece, mean to you?\n\nA\n\n:\n\nThe play functions on several levels. First, it is the means for these play­\n\ners to make a living. But it is also art, since they perform it on stage. Then there is the text they use and the myth of the Atrides. The text is always interrupted at some stage and never completed on screen. And finally, add­ ing the historical background, the play itself gains another dimension. Let's take, for example, one line from the play: \"Are we being watched?\" This doesn't have anything to do with the popular drama anymore; it refers to the fate of the actors themselves, the characters of the film.\n\nIt seems as ifGolfo is the only play they ever perform. And you have to agree that both thematically and dramatically this is a very conventional play. Politically speaking, it rather mystifies instead of clarifying the true antagonism between so­ cial classes. Don't you feel there is a contradiction between the distinct political position of the actors themselves and the reactionary ideology of the play they keep producing? A : Golfo in nothing more than a convention, a Greek version of Romeo and Juliet. The actors are not really conscious of the conflict between their per­ a :\n\nsonal politics and the ideology of the play. All they want is to make a living by offering their audience the kind of fare they like to see.\n\nWhat about the relations between theater and cinema? The stage sequences raise the question of realism, in the sense that an actor plays an actor who plays a role in a play, so what is real in all this? a :\n\nM I C H E L\n\nA\n\n:\n\nD E M O P O U LO S\n\nA N D\n\nF R I DA\n\nL I A P PAS/ 1 9 7 4\n\n2 1\n\nI have given a lot of thought to this matter. The actors play actors.\n\nMasks, costumes, sets, they are all extremely important elements. The change of costumes, for example. When the Englishman puts an actor's beret on his head and gives the actor another hat in exchange, he becomes an actor in the play as well. When the British perform on the improvised set or sing \"Tipperary, \" the actors are the audience. When Golfo is supposed to fall down, dead, a British soldier falls too, killed by a bullet, as if he, at this spe­ cific moment, was playing the part of Golfo. Certain acts and events are re­ peated all through the film and given more than one sense, and the performance of the play is never concluded because it is always interrupted by the political events taking place at the same time. a :\n\nDoes your film adhere to a clear esthetic concept established beforehand?\n\nA :\n\nDespite rumors that I have a definite esthetic concept with which I will\n\nstick through hell and high water, I would like to insist on the fact that I do improvise a lot. In the film there are a certain number of very dynamic scenes featuring a large variety of actions, and also static scenes, the three mono­ logues. Since I wanted to have one distinct esthetic approach, I tried to com­ pensate through camera movements in every possible instance, except for the theater production and the three tales. For these scenes, the camera stood still, facing the actors. The basic principle governing all the film is the se­ quence shot, whether the camera is moving (which it is most of the time) or immobile. This way, the scenes gain much in depth and detail, with the edit­ ing being done inside the camera. We never shot two scenes, if we had the option of doing it in one.\n\nYou feel much more comfortable with the sequence shot and prefer it to the traditional editing process.\n\na :\n\nA\n\n:\n\nIt is my own notion, possibly a very personal one. The sequence shot\n\noffers, as far as I am concerned, much more freedom, but it is true that the spectator needs to be more involved in it. There is another advantage I like\n\nin the sequence shot that you cannot have in traditional editing: the empty screen, when the action is implied, taking place elsewhere. a : We could say the sequence shot adopts the concept of montage but instead of using traditional editing, it combines together various elements in one scene, which, through the movement of the camera, stimulate the imagination ofyour spectators.\n\n2 2\n\nA :\n\nT H E O\n\nA N G E LO P O U LO S :\n\nI N T E RV I EWS\n\nIt is equally important to mention that through the sequence shot it is\n\npossible to preserve both unity of space and unity of time. The film does not acquire an artificial pace at the editing table. Also, once you change the frame, it is as if you're telling your audience to look elsewhere. By refusing to cut in the middle, I invite the spectator to better analyze the image I show him, and to focus, time and again, on the elements that he feels are the most significant in it. a :\n\nDid you encounter any difficulties during the production of the film?\n\nA :\n\nFirst of all, the weather. I was persecuted by beautiful weather. I needed\n\na clouded sky-I couldn't imagine the occupation under sunny skies. But Greece is well known for its magnificent weather and sunny sky, summer and winter alike. You can't imagine how much trouble this was! When you have scenes where the first part is shot in Athens and the second in Amfissa, you need to have similar meteorological conditions; the mood, the atmo­ sphere have to be as close as possible. And that is rarely evident in a film. On top of that, we went over budget, and worst of all, we were afraid of shooting this kind of film under the present conditions you are only too familiar with.\n\nRhythms of Silence to Better Underline the Scream: The Hunters FRAN CES CO\n\nCAS ETTI/1977\n\na :\n\nHow did you prepare for this film?\n\nA :\n\nTo begin with, we had a script that was barely more than a sketch, a kind\n\nof extended synopsis. Then I started searching for the right locations-I al­ ways choose them myself, even if this means travelling extensively all through Greece. In The Travelling Players it was somehow easier because the story itself kept moving from one location to another. In The Hunters every­ thing takes place in one spot, a hotel, which makes the choice much more difficult. Once I found it, I went ahead and wrote the shooting script, always leaving a margin for improvisation. Though there isn't much room for im­ provisation here. Once I started working on the set, we rehearsed every single scene for three full days and only then went ahead and shot it. We had some sequence shots of seven to eleven minutes each; consequently there was no room for errors or improvisations. The slightest mistake meant we had to start the shot all over again. And that takes a lot of time. The rehearsals were pretty systematic: first the actors, then the camera, then the sound . . . . a :\n\nThe camera set-ups were finalized beforehand or did you make up your mind were working on the scene?\n\nas you A :\n\nFor the camera movements, I usually followed the indications of the\n\nshooting script. But whenever I felt it was necessary, because of a conflict between them and the position of the actors, I did not hesitate to make the From Cinema e Cinema, no. 13, Oct.-Dec. 1977. permission. Translated by Dan Fainaru.\n\ne>\n\n1977 by Francesco Casetti. Reprinted by\n\n2 4\n\nT H E O\n\nA N G E L O P O U L O S :\n\nI N T E RV I EWS\n\nnecessary changes. To make it clearer: in early rehearsals, the actors were pretty free to choose the way they moved and then I corrected the things I was not comfortable with and condensed the action. My intention, from the very beginning, was to avoid at any cost a realist effect, to reach some kind of pure geography. That is, to stress the evidence of the film direction, its artificial side-the opposite of an opinion I heard, claiming the film is realis­ tic. Like the American musicals with their breaks between musical numbers and the plot, creating on purpose an artificial cinema by the way they were directed. Working with the actors, in this respect, was of maj or importance. Having to keep their distance from their roles, in the Brechtian tradition, doesn't make their job any easier. On the contrary. We had to insist on their penetrating under the skin of their characters, without showing it. We were trying to achieve a kind of minimalist effect in the spirit of the Japanese theatre which uses the rhythms of silence to better underline the scream. a\n\n:\n\nA :\n\nDoes it mean the performances had to be purged of any trace ofpathos? Yes, j ust like I did in certain passages of The Travelling Players. The three\n\nmonologues delivered directly into the camera, were \"dried out\" of emotions in order to achieve a kind of alienation that would have been ruined by realistic performances. In The Hunters I went one step further: this film is cold-at no point can the audience identify with the characters or does it wish to. The actors are not supposed to reflect a distinct personality; they should be like masks. Just like classic theatre that, next to the immobile masks, used the voice to express the emotions. I would like to add that I was also trying to achieve a kind of musicality-to give the script the form of a musical score. The sound effects are never accidental; they follow a certain cadence in relation to each other. One could almost count the beats. Do you know, for instance, that the actors were indeed counting silently between one line and another? The point of departure was realistic but from there on I let the rhythm dictate the procedure. The film acquired a musical structure.\n\nThat means the film is not really as \"cold\" as you suggested, it has its \"hot\" aspects.\n\na :\n\nA :\n\nIt all depends on the spectator and to what extent he is willing to do his\n\nshare of the work when he watches the film. The film supplies him with a certain amount of information, but it is only by completing it with his own input that he can hope to enjoy the film. The pleasure derived will not be\n\nFRAN C E S C O\n\nCAS E T T I / 1 9 7 7\n\n2 5\n\nthe result of its \"beauty\" only, but also of the feeling that what it shows is really \"intolerable. \" In this sense, the film is \"cold\" on the first level, but very hot on the second. This is a terribly sad film, an unpleasant film that rejects all relief stemming from easy hopes. It is a film about the present we live in, about how things seem to stay the same as if nothing had happened despite all the political changes taking place around us. My earlier films worked on several levels, too, but here I believe it is much clearer. The scene in which the girl makes love with the imaginary king, the father-king, the God-king, is drawn out to such length that it becomes unbearable and fasci­ nating at one and the same time. What I am trying to say is that fascination enters the picture here only on a second level, once the viewer has done his share. This film is not supposed to deliver all its secrets on first sight, it is only through your own dialogue with the screen that the picture is com­ pleted. a : In this sense, The Travelling Players could be defined a \"hot\" film on the first, immediate level. Also, it had a compact style throughout. In The Hunters, it seems as if every single moment has its own \"tone. \" A :\n\nFor instance?\n\nFor instance, you never before used a device like the clapboard preceding the scene of the actress-singer. Or the love scene that leads into a completely different direction. a\n\n:\n\nA\n\n:\n\nTrue, I used them to break into the rhythm and also into the thematics\n\nof the film. The second scene you mention is a long sequence shot showing two people making love, a group sitting around the table eating, the Ameri­ can woman walking in and offering to buy everything, the politician un­ dressing. By moving from one to the other in one sweeping camera movement, we reveal the many facets of one central situation and at the same time prevent the viewer from identifying with any of these facets, since he is jolted from one surprise to another. This way, we multiply one aspect while canceling another. This is what Brecht meant by alienation. I would also like to point out the way I matched shots-systematically using every possible variant from the classic visual matching through sound matches and interior/exterior matching of shots. The point was to deny these matches their natural function and to bring into the open all the artificial aspects of film direction. This is clearly a show put on for the benefit of the\n\n2 6\n\nT H E O\n\nA N G E LO P O U L O S :\n\nI N T E RVI EWS\n\naudience, there is no realistic excuse to explain it, like the theatre in The\n\nTravelling Players . . . . \" a\n\n:\n\nA\n\n:\n\nWhich unified the various levels of the picture. . . .\n\n\"\n\nHere the matching is far more violent to prevent any type of identifica­\n\ntion. In this respect, The Hunters is a much more materialistic film than The\n\nTravelling Players. The direction is far more evident. I would also like to draw the attention to the aggressive structure of the film which should j erk the audience out of its complacency.\n\nAnother thing. The empty screen, as it was used in The Travelling Players, was, for me, a moment of reflection, waiting for the character to complete his ac­ tion. a :\n\nA\n\n:\n\nIn a certain sense, you are right. But if we use once more the musical\n\nscore as a model, these dead moments are the equivalent of musical pauses. After the last note, there is a moment of silence, allowing the viewer to grasp the sense of the entire sequence. Normally, shots are cut when the action is over, or the last sound is heard. Emptiness, the dead moment, is the impres­ sion you have when there is nothing more to show or to hear. a : It's like pauses used in certain types of modem jazz. Not just a moment of suspense, but a device whose purpose is to underline the rules of the game. A :\n\nTrue.\n\na : Recently, I had the occasion to see again The Days of '36 and found there a similar approach. A : Some of my films are \"hot, \" others are \"cold. \" The hot ones are Recon­ struction and The Travelling Players. The cold ones are The Days of '36 and The Hunters.\n\nTwo final questions about your narrative approach. First, I was amazed by the lack of chronological references in The Hunters. A : In The Travelling Players, the chronology of the film relies on important a\n\n:\n\nhistorical events, familiar to most people. Here, however, the various periods are introduced through aspects of internal Greek politics that non-Greeks will find difficult to identity. But in any case, it is true that I do not pay much atte"
