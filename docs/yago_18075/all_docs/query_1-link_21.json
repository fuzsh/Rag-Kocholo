She was spotted by Itzhak Perlman when she was about thirteen, and he brought her from Thessaloniki, Greece to study with him. Dr. Lenhart is a UM and Juilliard graduate. Come enjoy these wonderful musicians. We would love to see you and your loved ones and friends there. The lovers of classical music or everything Greek will not be disappointed.\n\nThe Modern Greek Program was pleased to co-sponsor this Greek cultural event, organized by Iambus Music, a non-profit serving Hellenic music and Greek classical musicians by increasing their exposure in the USA and the world.\n\nPoster\n\nHistory and Culture in Chinese and Greek Film\n\nPresenters: Jing Zhang, New College of Florida & Vassiliki Rapti, Harvard University\n\nThursday, March 31, 2016\n\nThe U-M Confucius Institute and Modern Greek Program at the Department of Classical Studies present its fourth joint exploration of modern Chinese and Greek cultures, comparing these two countries' rich cultures and histories in the global context. This unique collaboration is to compare the ways contemporary Chinese and Greeks engage with their respective histories, cultures, performing arts, and films. This year \"History and Culture in Chinese and Greek Film\" will be discussed via two lectures and two film screenings on March 31 and April 1 respectively.\n\n5 - 5:50 pm: \"Lost Child or Lost Fatherhood?: Confucian Structure of Feeling Reinterpreted in Contemporary Chinese Language Cinema\" by Jing Zhang\n\nFilial piety and the father-son relationship constitute the core of the \"Confucian structure of feeling\" in traditional China. While the last two decades saw a rapid economic growth and cultural globalization in China, they also witnessed a revival of traditional values, promoted through state propaganda and education, elite discourse, popular culture, and even legalization. It is in this context that I will discuss the theme of parental love in recent Chinese language films, examining it as an inversion or reinterpretation of filial sentiment pervasive in early modern Chinese literature. I will focus on two recent films of China and Hong Kong collaboration, Dearest (2014) and Lost and Love (2015), one made by the Hong Kong director Peter Chan and the other by novelist and television screenwriter Peng Sanyuan as her directorial debut. Both films base their stories in news reports of child abduction, focus on the parents' relentless search for their lost kids, and dramatize the multilayered tension between parental relationship, morality, and law. I will also trace the motif of \"looking for a lost child/father\" back to the early Modern Chinese narratives and its reincarnations in several films made at critical historical moments.\n\n6 - 6:50 pm: \"In Her Own Voice: History, Memory and Female Subjectivity in Greek Cinema\" by Vassiliki Rapti, Harvard University\n\nWithin the male-dominated Greek cinema, several pioneering women directors made their appearance in the 1980s and distinguished themselves to the point that we can talk about a feminine Greek cinematic vision. This talk will focus on the distinct features of this powerful yet little known cinematic vision, and tackle female subjectivity as caught up in between History and memory. By analyzing several path-breaking films such as The Price of Love (1984) and Crystal Nights (1992) by Tonia Marketaki, Love Wanders in the Night (1981) andThe Years of the Big Heat (1991) by Frieda Liappa, and Hold Me (2006) and the documentary The Aegean in the Words of Poets (2003) by Loukia Rikaki, where the personal drama is conditioned by the larger circumstances, it will show how female subjectivity is shaped by desire nurtured by memory and agency against History.\n\nWatch Rapti Lecture / Watch Zhang Lecture\n\nScreenings April 1, 2016 / History and Culture in Chinese and Greek Film\n\n6:00 - 8:10 pm : Dearest (2014)\n\nDirected by Peter Chen. 130 min.\n\nFollowing years of unrelenting search, Tian Wenjun and ex-wife Lu Xiaojuan finally locate their abducted son in a remote village. After the boy was violently taken away from the village, the abductor's widow Li Hongqin- the boy's foster mother - also loses her foster daughter to a state-owned orphanage in Shenzhen Heartbroken, Li goes on a lone but determined journey to get her daughter back. The movie was based on a real life story of a father who used social media to find his missing boy.

Images from most of the Aegean islands and the sea that links them. These texts blend poems and records of journeys from most of the writers who visited the Aegean over the centuries, and who felt compelled to share the emotions the archipelago inspired in them. We are confronted with vivid descriptions of those same emotions which the Aegean triggers in visitors today. Apart from their literary revelations, these texts weave a complex tissue of travellers' impressions of the Aegean over the centuries. Different opinions ,meanings and formats blend into a common experience of the archipelago through several languages.

Kalyvas, Yale University, Arnold Wolfers Professor of Political Science\n\nIn this lecture, Professor Kalyvas will review and discuss the various stages of the “Greek Crisis” from its eruption in 2009 to the present. He will consider its place in the broader context of Greek history and the process of European integration, both monetary and political, comparing and contrasting political and economic dynamics, as well as domestic, European, and international ones. This lecture will draw on the arguments of his recently published book, Modern Greece: What Everyone Needs to Know (Oxford University Press, 2015).\n\nStathis N.

University\n\nPanagiotis A. Agapitos, professor of Byzantine literature, University of Cyprus\n\nDespite the growing interest in medievalist (re)constructions of the Middle Ages (e.g. in film, theater, and fiction), the image of the “Middle Ages” in contemporary crime fiction has not been studied at all despite the immense popularity of this subgenre of crime writing. This talk will take a look at this production that, more or less, began in the late 1970s and has grown into a vibrant industry encompassing a variety of periods from the 7th to the 15th century, mostly placed in England, but also in France, Germany, and Italy. An attempt will be made to recognize the narrative mechanisms of “medieval mystery novels,” their literary models; their ideological approaches to various medieval societies; and their depiction of violence, sex, power, and friendship. A brief look will be offered to crime fiction dealing with cultures outside the conventional frame of the (Western) Middle Ages, such as, China, Japan, and Byzantium. Ultimately, it will be proposed that the “new” Middle Ages of contemporary crime fiction are an exotic locus of intertextual and intervisual fantasy, rather than an academic archeological recostrunction of a clearly defined medieval past.\n\nPanagiotis A. Agapitos is professor of Byzantine literature at the University of Cyprus. His research interests focus on textual and literary criticism, with an emphasis on Byzantine rhetoric and its performance, poetics, erotic fiction, and the representation of death in Byzantine literature. Beyond his scholarly papers, he has published Narrative Structure in the Byzantine Vernacular Romances (Munich 1991); Theodoros Metochites on Greek Philosophy and Ancient History (Gothenburg 1996); the first critical edition of the thirteenth-century verse romance Livistros and Rhodamne (Athens 2006); and, most recently, Between History and Fiction: Medieval Narratives between History and Fiction: From the Centre to the Periphery of Europe, 1100-1400 (Copenhagen 2012), edited with L. B. Mortensen. He is currently preparing an English translation with introduction and notes of Livistros and Rodamne for Translated Texts for Byzantinists (Liverpool University Press), and a study on the periodization of Byzantine literature. Parallel to his scholarly activities, he is a writer of historical crime fiction, having published sofar three novels set in 9th-century Byzantium.\n\nSponsors: CES, Department of Classical Studies, Department of Comparative Literature, Modern Greek Program\n\nWatch Lecture\n\nManos Hadjidakis -- A New Generation of Musicians Pay Tribute to the Composer\n\nApril 18, 2015\n\nKerrytown Concert House, 415 N. 4th Ave, Ann Arbor, MI, 48104\n\nA concert generously sponsored by the Modern Greek Program — University of Michigan\n\nThe Greek composer Manos Hadjidakis (1925 - 1994) is beloved worldwide for his compositions, which range from classical music to folk music to film music. His most famous composition, 1960’s Never On A Sunday, was composed for the film of the same title, and garnered him an Academy Award for Best Original Song. That song would go on to be his most famous, and would become the definitive sound of Greek music to an international audience for generations to come. But he wrote prolifically, both in Greece and in America, where he lived 1966 to 1972.\n\nHadjidakis was deeply influenced by the American culture he loved — the cities, the life, the music, the artists. In turn, American musicians performed, adapted, and popularized his music through movies, musicals, concerts, and records. Today, twenty years after his death, a new generation is re-discovering his work, approaching it in innovative and exciting ways. This special concert will present the new Hadjidakis of the 21st century, who is still inviting us all to go with him \"for a walk on the moon.”\n\nComposer, pianist, and improvising musician Michael Malis spearheaded this concert in a program that provided new adaptations of some of Hadjidakis’ best known compositions, as well as some of his lesser-known gems. Malis, who is of Greek-American descent, brought a unique perspective to this music. The program was diverse, featuring a range of instrumentations, from solo piano to chamber ensembles. Malis was joined by special guests, including flutist Ellie Falaris Ganelin, the founder of the Greek Chamber Music Project, as well as cellist Abby Alwin, an improvising musician with a deep affinity for Greek music.\n\nAlso featured on the program was Ann Arbor’s own OrnämatiK, a “Balkan funk band” featuring popular area musicians. Well known for their legendary festive performances around Ann Arbor, Southeastern Michigan, and across the Midwest, OrnämatiK consistently delights dancers and audiences alike.\n\nMore Information\n\nHow Greek was El Greco?\n\nJanuary 22, 2015, Michigan Union\n\n13th Annual Dimitris & Irmgard Pallas Modern Greek Lecture\n\nSpeaker: Andrew R. Casper, Miami University\n\nABSTRACT: Born in Crete around 1541, there is no doubt about the ethnic origins of the painter Domenikos Theotokopoulos, better known as “El Greco” (“The Greek”). And yet the issue becomes much more complex when we take into consideration the painter’s artistic output and the multicultural path that he followed throughout his career. For an artist whose career spanned Crete, Venice, Rome, and Toledo (Spain), the issue of his “Greekness” results in something of a conflict between his own self-conception and the expectations of his audiences. This paper will examine the diversity of El Greco’s painting styles as well as the communicative goals of his signatures to explore the fraught issues of his Greek identity in late sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe.\n\nBIO: Andrew Casper earned his Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania and is currently Assistant Professor of art history at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he specializes in Renaissance and Baroque art in southern Europe. He is the author of numerous articles on sixteenth-century icons and the religious paintings from El Greco’s Italian period. His book Art and the Religious Image in El Greco’s Italy (Penn State University Press, 2014) uses El Greco’s early paintings to advance new ideas concerning the conception of religious imagery after the Council of Trent. His current research examines the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century artistic conception of the Shroud of Turin as a divine painting. His research and publications have been supported by grants from the American Philosophical Society, Art History Publication Initiative, College Art Association, Fulbright, Italian Art Society, National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Newberry Library. Professor Casper is the winner of the 2014 Miami University Distinguished Teaching Award.\n\nProgram / Watch Lecture\n\nFact of Fiction: What More Do We Know about American Involvement in the 1967 Greek Military Coup?\n\n12th Annual Dimitris & Irmgard Pallas Modern Greek Lecture\n\nMarch 26, 2014, Michigan Union, Anderson Room\n\nSpeaker: Neovi Karakatsanis, Indiana University South Bend\n\nA lack of scholarly and journalistic objectivity has long been a stumbling block in our understanding of the Greek military dictatorship of 1967–74. In Greece, one of the most commonly held beliefs is that the United States was actively involved in launching and maintaining in power the Colonels’ regime. Given the close relationship between the U.S. government and the Greek right (including the Greek military establishment) during the 1940s–1960s, one can easily understand the origin and plausibility of this perception. However, despite the nearly universal Greek acceptance of U.S. involvement, little to no evidence has been provided in either the scholarly or popular literature to substantiate (or refute) this claim. This presentation will attempt to do just that: by calling attention to recently declassified State Department, U.S. Embassy and National Security Council files, as well as documents from the British Foreign Office, Karakatsanis will analyze and assess the U.S. perspective and its reaction to the Colonels’ coup of 1967. Highlighting the complex, contradictory nature of the U.S.-Greek relationship, this presentation sets forth a nuanced understanding of the actors, strategies and interests involved in the run up and immediate aftermath of the colonels’ 1967 coup.\n\nNeovi M. Karakatsanis is a Professor of Political Science at Indiana University South Bend, where she has taught since 1998. She has written on the Greek transition to democracy, the southern European welfare state, Greek unemployment, and the issue of women migrants and attitudes towards migration in Greece.\n\nPoster ° Photos"
