        "text": "1961\n\nWilliam M. \"Bill\" Black becomes president of the board through 1968.\n\n1962\n\nThe board launches second stock sale, $300,000 of additional Class A stock (at $5 5 per share instead of $50, but with the same lift privilege), $200,000 of which is slated to build the new Green Valley chair­lift in 1963.\n\nIn April, the Forest Service issues Crystal's \"Term Spe­cial Use Permit\" for a period of twenty years (later amended to thirty).\n\nSummer sees a hubbub of final construction. News­paper headlines trumpet \"Ski Area Is Readied at Crystal Mountain\" and \"Crews Rush Work at Crystal Mt. Ski Area.\"\n\nOn November 14, Governor Rosellini presides over \"Official Dedication\" and \"Crystal Mountain Pre­view\" at the junction of Highway 410 and the hard­won Crystal Mountain road, four miles of it complet­ed, with a single lane of gravel and dirt the rest of the way to the Day Lodge.\n\nOpening day is December 8. Crystal Mountain Ski Area starts operation with Miners Basin double (C-1), Iceberg Ridge double (C-2), seven rope tows, a T-bar on the Gold Hills slope, and the Day Lodge.\n\nJack Nagel moves ski school and racing program from Stevens Pass, setting up Crystal's resident ski school and ski shop with then-wife Donna and founding what would become the Crystal Mountain Alpine Club.\n\n1963\n\nGreen Valley double (C-3) comes online in December.\n\n1964\n\nSilver Skis Chalet opens in February, the first condo­minium development in Washington State.\n\nThe legendary Silver Skis race from Rainer's Camp Muir to Paradise is revived at Crystal as part of the Pacific Northwest Ski Association's downhill cham­pionships. Silver Skis races are subsequently held at Crystal 1965-69, with a weather cancellation in 1967 and format change to giant slalom in 1969.\n\nAlpine Inn and Snorting Elk open in early December.\n\nCrystal Inn and restaurant open in mid-December, along with the pool and Bullion House built by the same development group (C-M Inn Co.). Crystal Inn offers condo units and hotel accommodations.\n\nSummit House (a.k.a. \"warming hut\") opens at top of Iceberg Ridge lift (C-2).\n\n1965\n\nQuicksilver double (C-4) comes online in December.\n\nNational Collegiate Ski Championships event is held March 25-27.\n\nNational Alpine Championships and P-I Silver Skis International is held April 2-4.\n\n1966\n\nChapel is built in spring and summer.\n\nCrystal House (today's Quicksilver Lodge) is built.\n\nHoward \"Huck\" Paulsen is named Crystal's area su­perintendent, taking over from General Manager Mel Borgersen. Paulsen is superintendent through 1968. Frank Webb is shop supervisor.\n\n1967\n\nForest Service issues moratorium on condo develop­ment on federal land, which lasts until 1973. Silvers Skis and Crystal Chalets are two of only three condo­miniums on Forest Service land in the country.\n\nNight skiing comes to Crystal with the illumination of Quicksilver, \"one of the longest lighted ski runs in the world.\"\n\n1968\n\nNational Alpine Championships and 15th P-I Silver Skis Downhill event is held March 8-10.\n\nDay Lodge reconstruction in summer repairs damage from second-floor fire the previous February.\n\nH. E. \"Ed\" Link takes over from Huck Paulsen, becom­ing president of the company and general manager for a long tenure that lasts until 1981. Don Christianson is his area superintendent.\n\nTedrowe Watkins becomes chairman of the board through 1975."
