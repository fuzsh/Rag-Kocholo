It all began in Athens during the German occupation. A German woman, married to a Greek officer, falls in love with a young Jew who delivers ice. Forced by the supreme motive - that of winning the love of her life - the woman dies and is born again. In the course of her two lives, the world around her evolves. The story of the individual traverses history. A film on love. Potentially a thriller; since it lies on the borderline between imagination and terror. “Crystal Nights” (the film gets its title from the notorious “Crystal Nights”, the first systematic, mass attack by bands of Nazis on Jewish shop windows in Vienna, in 1938) is Marketakis’s most demanding film, in which she is balancing, without a safety net, on a daemonic line and where symbolism and realism are not just interchangeable; they become one.
