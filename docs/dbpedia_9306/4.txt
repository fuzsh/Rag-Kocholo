Ministry is an industrial metal band with a career spanning four decades. Front man Al Jourgensen is the only continuous member as the lead vocalist and guitarist, but the rest of the band’s line-up has shuffled members from metal music’s elite and other bands including Fear Factory. Ministry has stood together with the band Nine Inch Nails as one of the main groups representing industrial metal. Jourgensen started out with the new wave band Special Affect while attending college, then briefly played with the band The Carmichaels before forming Ministry after signing with the Wax Trax record label.

To date Ministry’s production includes fourteen studio albums, thirty singles, and twenty music videos, most notably the 1992 album “Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs,” which was certified platinum. The single “N.W.O.” from that album charted #11 on the Billboard US Alternative chart. Frequent Ministry collaborators include Jello Biafra of Dead Kennedys, and the Butthole Surfers. Ministry has also contributed to film soundtracks including “The Matrix.”
