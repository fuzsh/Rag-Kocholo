        "text": "Ministry mastermind Al Jourgensen has never been shy about speaking his mind on political issues in his song lyrics. And fans of the industrial trailblazers will be happy to know that on the band’s 16th studio effort overall, HOPIUMFORTHEMASSES, Jourgensen is as outspoken as ever – particularly on such tracks as “Goddamn White Trash” and “B.D.E.” (“Big Dick Energy”).\n\nAhead of the LP’s March 1st release date and Ministry’s upcoming headlining North American tour, Heavy Consequence caught up with Jourgensen to discuss the album and more.\n\nGet Ministry Tickets Here\n\n“As we all know, the ‘goddamn white trash’ has come out from under the rocks – thanks to the MAGA era,” Jourgensen told Heavy Consequence in the video interview above. “And it’s violent. And it’s bullshit, really. Because they’re just being conned because they’re uneducated. Because we’ve cut funding for education, because we cut everything with right wing governments – in my opinion. So, the thing is it’s been normalized – that kind of violent behavior. On ‘Big Dick Energy,’ our other video that’s come out, misogyny, violence, all this stuff has been normalized through this MAGA movement. Just speaking out on it and fighting it with the usual Ministry sarcasm.”\n\nAs for as the overall vibe of HOPIUMFORTHEMASSES, don’t expect an exact repeat of any past Ministry album. “Ministry…no album sounds alike,” Jourgensen insisted. “Actually, I say that with pride – over the 40 years. But there’s still an element there where you know it’s Ministry.”\n\n“We reached that fulcrum back in the ’90s, when we did Psalm 69, and the label basically wanted us to do Psalm 70. It’s like, ‘Do the same thing! Don’t fix it if it ain’t broke!’ And then we did Filth Pig, which inevitably got us dropped from Warner Bros., because they didn’t understand it. But what’s funny is about 10 years later, that was considered one of our finest pieces!”\n\nAlways politically-minded, Jourgensen also shared his thoughts about the presidential race being Biden vs. Trump again. “It was almost inevitable.,” remarked the industrial pioneer. “You could see it coming. I’m not surprised. I’m not happy, but you have to understand, people with the ideas either are shut out or bought out. And so, the system keeps running the way the system wants to run – which is basically, it doesn’t matter who’s president. Even if Trump were to win and he’s a loose cannon and senile, the people with the money that basically have bought the entire congress, senate, and presidency for that matter – the super PACs, the lobbyists and all that – if there’s no money in it, they’re not going to allow a nuclear war if there’s no money in it. And there’s no money in nuclear war.”"
