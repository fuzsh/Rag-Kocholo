        "text": "When asked whether Minstry influenced Big Black:\n\nIn th early 1980s there was a Chicago band called Stations that used both live drummers and drum machines. I was in this band briefly (1981) during a drum machine period, and it is definitely where I got the idea to play with a drum machine.\n\nBefore I joined, they had recorded a single with a drummer named Stevo, who was in Special Affect with Al Jourgensen, and later drummed for Ministry.\n\nAl also worked at Wax Trax, the incredible record store that was the epicenter of the Chicago punk scene at the time, and he almost certainly sold me records that influenced me tremendously. So thanks, Al.\n\nIn its earliest incarnation, Ministry sounded like the Cure, and I have heard the test pressing of an unreleased single that proves it. I don’t think it would be possible for anybody to have been influenced by this early eyelinier version of Minstry.\n\nI’ll leave it to others to decide who influenced whom, but I don’t think I have ever intentionally listened to a Ministry record, so that would be a tough case to make.\n\nAlbini fans on Ministry:\n\nhttp://www.electricalaudio.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=899&hilit=al+jourgensen\n\nAnother quote from Albini:\n\nUnrelentingly stupid music in every incarnation. It takes a worldview clouded by inexperience to get anything out of this crap. It’s phony and borrowed and dress-up and superficial on every level.\n\nDespite the involvement of a few great musicians over the years (Ion Barker and Bill Reiflin from the Blackouts, Martin Atkins, Rey Washam) I have always hated this shit, from its pretend-Classix Nouveaux beginnings, through its pretend-Killing Joke era to its pretend-Anthrax phase. Out of a civility instinct I suppressed my hatred at least verbally when in the company of the Wax Trax people I liked, but I still hated this music. It is as stupid and phony as anything on America’s Next whatever. Knowing that its auteur is apparently a complete piece of shit doesn’t make that better or worse, I suppose, but we know that, so there’s that too.\n\nSome chat about Special Affect from Albini:\n\nI wasn’t into them. I picked up their album from the Wax Trax dollar bin and only remember playing it once. Within the punk circles they were laughed at, unlike the Mentally Ill, the Imports, Tutu and the Pirates, Navastrau, Stations, Epicycle and most of the other proto-punk bands. Steve Bjorklund’s nickname for them, Specially Affected, took the mockery honors.\n\nTheir drummer Harry Rushakoff was pretty good as I recall. He played on the Stations single and I think ended up in Concrete Blonde or a similar high-profile band. Their singer Frankie Nardiello ended up a mainstay of the depressingly stupid Wax Trax drug&disco scene.\n\nI like this poster’s tale:\n\nI will say this about Al: I first met him when I went into the local record store to buy the first Pretenders album - he told me don’t bother, and sold me the first Clash album instead. Then when I went in to buy whatever else remained of the available Clash catalog, he told me don’t bother and sold me The Ramones. That blew my mind, so when I went in to buy the rest of the Ramones albums, he told me I should purchase Pink Flag by Wire instead - and why not Betrayal by Jah Wobble and Second Edition by Public Image, too? I think he also made me buy “Warm Leatherette” by The Normal. So anyway, the dude was pretty formative in shaping my musical taste!\n\nA year or so later, Steve started his radio show at WNUR, which proved equally formative, if not more so - weird how these two opposites kinda dovetailed when it came to my musical edumacation… I think my ears first encountered Killing Joke when Steve played “Requiem” on his show, and I’ve probably never been the same since… I often think about how weird it was that these were just two dudes that happened to be lingering around my hometown, and what effect it had on me.\n\nWow, after reading some of that shit on that forum I welcome a nuclear war. What a bunch of pretentious fuckheads. Are they for real or fucking around?\n\nThis is is one of the many examples of pretentiousness and stupidity that I cannot fathom:\n\nI voted crap because I am an adult.\n\nMinistry aren’t for adults, and thus I feel something of a killjoy.\n\nWhen I was 15 I thought Ministry was pretty damn good.\n\n“NOW LOOK MAN!..DOW-DE-DOW…NOW LOOK MAN!..DOW-DE-DOW…etc”\n\nUsed to love that.\n\nCRAP.\n\nThis guy sounds like he’d be a fucking blast at parties.\n\nI can totally understand them dissing current “Ministry”. And what pisses me off is that Al’s current shit music only helps some of their points. That’s a large part of what’s pissed me off about “Ministry” post-Barker. It’s embarassing to like and I have to go, “No, that’s not Ministry. Listen to this album or that one.” and explain. But after seeing the “99 Percenters” video do you think people are going to give anything else a fucking chance? Hell no.\n\nI completely agree with them bashing the shit “Ghouldiggers” and “99 Percenters” videos and lyrics and all the Bush Trilogy shit. But to bash the entire back catalog and shit on everything the band has done? Fuck them. I’m usually the one bashing Ministry but goddamn.\n\nCan you imagine a gathering with these people? Holy shit. Nothing is cool, everything is passé (they pronounce it “pawsaaay” and sound like they’re bored when saying it), and having fun is never acceptable.\n\nCan you imagine a gathering with these people? Holy shit. Nothing is cool, everything is passé (they pronounce it “pawsaaay” and sound like they’re bored when saying it), and having fun is never acceptable.\n\nI used to hang out with tools like that. I mean, real fucking music snobs. People here think I’m pretty uppity when it comes to what’s in and what’s not but I tell you, spend a week with these guys and soon enough Peligro seems like the most genenerous, open minded guy on earth.\n\nI remember playing a Secret Chiefs 3 (band formed by Trey Spruance of Mr Bungle/Faxed Head/Faith No More fame) album at a gathering once. I was sitting next to this guy who was more or less the ringleader of this particular group of intellectual purists. He was digging the album, thinking that it was early 70’s era Morricone. When I told him it wasn’t Ennio Morricone and that it was in fact an album made by an ex member of Mr Bungle, the guymore or less spat in my face, then launched into a 15 minute tirade against “corporate” bullshit and “music for the masses” and “crappy teenage angst music”. Which I found odd, seeing that Secret Chiefs are on Web Of Mimicry - a tiny independant label- and if I interviewed 1000 people even in an inner city, hipster, bohemian area, I’ll wager that maybe, just maybe, 2 or 3 people would have heard of them.\n\nThe guy then got up and sat next to someone else - probably to pontificate over his opinions on Stockhausen and La Monte Young. So there you go. These people are out there and they will probably die alone and poor. Poor because they are too anti establishment to do anything as “corporate” as even get a job (cos that’s only for mainstream types, right?) and alone because being so full of negative energy, like rats in a cage, they will always eventually turn on each other.\n\nIn regards to Albini and Jourgenson - I’ve always enjoyed the fruits of both their labours. Both Atomizer and Rape And Honey are brilliant slabs of wax that inspired a young enthusiastic Peligro to no end and if push came to shove I probably couldn’t pick a favorite.\n\nBut fuck Albini if he thinks that Ministry were faux anything. I think he’d be a complete bore to hang out with. I’d imagine he’s the sort you’d likely find masturbating to Glenn Branca’s Lesson No. 1 with his mate Richard Kern after a lengthy discussion over Kafka in a tiny New York slum apartment.\n\nHe probably lives on beans and rice too and refuses to buy a car for “moral” reasons. Hipster cock-knocker…\n\n[reply]\n\nCan you imagine a gathering with these people? Holy shit.

Because I’m checking it out right now (the first track, at least) and I can totally imagine some hipster, music snob thinking it’s Morricone and then being bummed when he finds out he’s wrong. I don’t understand how Ennio Morricone is less “corporate” or “music for the masses” than some indie band. I love his stuff. “L’arena” is one of my favorite pieces of music ever written. But still.\n\nMusic is important to me and all… it’s pretty much one of the most important things to me actually. But at the end of the day it’s still just music. These people that have to give fucking lectures about it and discuss trivial shit on end ruin it and take all the fun out of it. They listen to obscure bands that nobody else likes. Well, there’s sometimes a good reason why nobody likes them or has heard of them. It’s because they fucking blow.\n\nBut fuck Albini if he thinks that Ministry were faux anything. I think he’d be a complete bore to hang out with.

Hipster cock-knocker…\n\nAhahaha, that’s disturbingly accurate of some of the pretentious mouthbreathers I’ve encountered and how I imagine them spending their evenings.\n\nBanana bikes, mustaches, earth-tone colors, scarves, brightly colored Wayfarer knock-offs, trust funds, portable record players, sweater vests, ironic t-shirts, corduroys, etc."
