        "text": "KYIV: Ukraine has received a $3.9 billion grant from the United States via the World Bank, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday.\n\n“This is the first tranche of direct budget support from the United States in 2024. In total, Ukraine will receive $7.8 billion in direct budgetary assistance from the US this year, which will allow us to confidently pass this financial period,” Shmyhal said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nThe Ukrainian Finance Ministry, in a separate statement, said the funds would be directed toward wages for teachers, staff of the State Emergency Service and other public employees, as well as assistance for displaced persons, low-income families and people with disabilities. “The grant will help Ukraine to reimburse priority social and humanitarian expenditures without increasing the debt burden,” Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko said in a statement.\n\nThe ministry said that since February 2022, direct budget support from the US had reached almost $27 billion, the largest source of financial assistance to Ukraine. Marchenko said the grant was a part of a large $60 billion package of support for Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that Ukrainian pilots have started flying F-16s for operations within the nation, confirming the long-awaited arrival of the US-made fighter jets more than 29 months after Russia’s invasion. The Ukrainian leader announced the use of F-16s, which Kyiv has long lobbied for, as he met military pilots at an air base flanked by two of the jets, with two more flying overhead.\n\n“F-16s are in Ukraine. We did it. I am proud of our guys who are mastering these jets and have already started using them for our country,” Zelensky said.\n\nThe arrival of the jets is a milestone for Ukraine, though it remains unclear how many are available and how much of an impact they will have in enhancing air defenses and on the battlefield.\n\nNEW DELHI: Hundreds of doctors protested near India’s health ministry Monday as they demanded stringent laws to protect health care workers from violence and sought justice for their colleague who was raped and killed at a state-run hospital.\n\nThe protesting doctors — who were holding up placards like “Justice delayed is justice denied” — were stopped by the police as they tried to set up free outpatient services to patients outside the health ministry in New Delhi, part of demonstrations and rallies held for more than a week.\n\nDoctors and medics across India have held protests, candlelight marches and temporarily refused to see non-emergency patients after the rape and killing of the 31-year-old trainee doctor on Aug. 9 in the eastern city of Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal state.\n\nThe protesting doctors say the assault highlights the vulnerability of medics and health care workers in hospitals and medical campuses across India. They are demanding stronger laws to protect them from violence, including making any attack on on-duty medics an offense without the possibility of bail, increase in security at hospitals and safe spaces for them to rest.\n\nThe government has asked doctors to return to duty and said it will set up a committee to look into their demands.\n\nThe rape and killing of the trainee doctor at Kolkata city’s R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital has also focused rage on the chronic issue of violence against women and led to protests across India.\n\nA police volunteer working at the hospital has been arrested and charged with the crime, but the family of the victim alleges it was a gang rape and more people were involved. Federal investigators are handling the case.\n\nThousands of people, particularly women, have also marched in the streets of Kolkata demanding justice for the doctor, saying her killing has highlighted how women in India continue to face rising violence despite tough laws following the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012.\n\nThat attack had inspired lawmakers to order harsher penalties for such crimes, as well as the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases. The government also introduced the death penalty for repeat offenders.\n\nDespite tougher laws, sexual violence against women has remained a widespread problem in India.\n\nIn 2022, police recorded 31,516 reports of rape — a 20 percent jump from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.\n\nLONDON: The UK government “may be complicit in war crimes,” according to a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office official who has resigned over arms sales to Israel.\n\nMark Smith, who was based at the British Embassy in Dublin and worked on both arms export licenses and counterterrorism measures, told colleagues in an email seen by the BBC that he had raised concerns “at every level” in the FCDO but received only basic acknowledgments over his queries.\n\nIn the email, sent to hundreds of government officials, Smith said “each day” he and others involved in Middle East arms export licensing assessments were seeing “clear and unquestionable examples” of war crimes committed in Gaza by Israeli forces, and there was “no justification for the UK’s continued arms sales to Israel.”\n\nSmith described himself as “a subject matter expert in the domain of arms sales policy” after “a long career in the diplomatic service,” adding: “As a fully cleared officer raising serious concerns of illegality in this Department, to be disregarded in this way is deeply troubling. It is my duty as a public servant to raise this.”\n\nHe wrote: “Senior members of the Israeli government and military have expressed open genocidal intent, Israeli soldiers take videos deliberately burning, destroying and looting civilian property.”\n\nSmith added: “Whole streets and universities have been demolished, humanitarian aid is being blocked and civilians are regularly left with no safe quarter to flee to. Red Crescent ambulances have been attacked, schools and hospitals are regularly targeted. These are War Crimes.”\n\nThe email continued: “Ministers claim that the UK has one of the most ‘robust and transparent’ arms export licensing regimes in the world, however this is the opposite of the truth.”\n\nThe UK has granted arms export licenses worth £574 million ($727 million) to Israel since 2008, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade. The government recently said this was “relatively small,” worth just £42 million in 2022.\n\nThe licenses were placed under review by Foreign Secretary David Lammy “on day one in office,” according to the FCDO, after the Labour Party took power in the UK general election on July 4.\n\nThe BBC reported that dissent among British, US and EU officials over potential war crimes and breaches of international law by Israel had reached “unprecedented levels” since last October, but that resignations such as Smith’s remained “extremely rare for the British government.”\n\nIn May, the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor applied for arrest warrants to be issued for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over allegations of war crimes.\n\nThe FCDO declined to comment on Smith’s resignation. “This government is committed to upholding international law. We have made clear that we will not export items if they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violations of International Humanitarian Law,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“There is an ongoing review process to assess whether Israel is complying with International Humanitarian Law, which the Foreign Secretary initiated on day one in office. We will provide an update as soon as that review process has been completed.”\n\nLONDON: Britain will use an emergency measure to detain suspected criminals in police station cells until it can find space for them in its overcrowded prisons after police arrested hundreds over widespread rioting this month.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer’s government said on Monday the arrests of more than 1,100 suspects over the racist violence aimed at migrants and Muslims had worsened a prison capacity crisis, which has already forced ministers to say they will allow jails to release more prisoners early.\n\nThe new, temporary measure will mean suspects will be summoned to court only when it is confirmed that a cell is available in one of the more than 100 prisons across the country. Until then they will be held in a police station.\n\n“We inherited a justice system in crisis and exposed to shocks,” prisons minister James Timpson said in a statement. “As a result, we have been forced into making difficult but necessary decisions to keep it operating.”\n\nOvercrowded prisons have presented Starmer, who took office last month, with an early crisis, leaving his government with unpalatable and costly choices.\n\nBritain has western Europe’s highest rate of incarceration and prisoner numbers have risen sharply since the pandemic, due to longer sentences, court delays and a requirement for serious offenders to serve at least 65 percent of their sentences behind bars.\n\nUnder plans announced by Starmer last month, most prisoners will become eligible for release after serving 40 percent of their sentences behind bars, down from 50 percent previously.\n\nMonday’s measures are expected to tackle lower prison capacity in the north of England, a region affected by the recent rioting, which followed misinformation that the suspect in the murder of three young girls was an Islamist migrant.\n\nMARSEILLE: Two wildfires in southern France forced several thousand people to flee before the blazes were brought under control, officials said on Monday.\n\nSome 3,000 holiday makers were evacuated from a camping site to a municipal building in the coastal town of Canet-en-Roussillon, near the city of Perpignan, in the face of a fire fanned by strong winds, rescue services said in a statement.\n\nThe fire, which destroyed one mobile home and partially damaged five others, was brought under control, they said.\n\nFurther up the Mediterranean coast, a fire that forced dozens from their homes in the coastal town of Frontignan, near the city of Montpellier, was also quelled.\n\n“The fire has been under control for two and a half hours now,” a spokesman for the regional firefighters, Jerome Bonnafoux, told AFP shortly after sunrise.\n\n“We’re still working on it because there are several hot spots where the risk of it flaring are high,” he added.\n\nOf the 600 firefighters who rushed to put out the fire on Sunday, half were expected to keep working on the site throughout the day, he added.\n\nThe fire, which has destroyed at least 300 hectares (740 acres) of land, ignited near the A9 highway from Montpellier to the Spanish border.\n\nFirefighters emptied the swimming pools of private homeowners to tackle the blaze, the mayor’s cabinet director said.\n\nMOSCOW: Russia’s prosecutor general on Monday said it had banned a foundation started by US film star George Clooney and his human rights lawyer wife Amal.\n\n“The activities of The Clooney Foundation for Justice are declared undesirable on the territory of our country,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe organization “conducts extensive work aimed at discrediting Russia, actively supports false patriots and members of banned terrorist and extremist groups.”\n\n“Under the guise of humanitarian ideas, these ‘warriors for justice’... advance initiatives of criminal probes against the highest Russian authorities,” it said in the statement entitled “The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office Appreciates Hollywood Activists’ Acting Talent.”\n\nAfter Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Russian authorities have upped repression of dissent to levels not seen since the Soviet Union.\n\nIn July, the Clooney Foundation, along with several other non-governmental organizations, filed a case with the UN Human Rights Committee, accusing Russia of violating the human rights of Ukrainians killed in a 2022 missile attack on Vinnytsia.\n\nIn early August, Russia’s prosecutor general banned as “undesirable” German pro-democracy foundation Konrad Adenauer and in July did the same with the Moscow Times news outlet.\n\nThe “undesirable” status forces organizations to shut down in Russia and means Russians that work for, fund or collaborate with them can also be liable to prosecution."
