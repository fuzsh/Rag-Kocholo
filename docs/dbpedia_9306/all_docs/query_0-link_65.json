        "text": "BUNA—After serving in youth ministry almost a decade, Buna native Micah Tyler saw God provide opportunities and open doors to communicate the gospel creatively through songs.\n\nWhile Tyler maintains a busy schedule performing concerts and leading worship for ministry events around the country, he stays true to his Texas Baptist roots.\n\nGrowing up at Central Baptist Church in Buna, Tyler committed his life to Christ at age 10 during Vacation Bible School and soon became involved in various ministries.\n\n“I actually don’t have a strong musical background,” he said. “No one in my family sings or plays an instrument, aside from an aunt who plays a little piano. I started singing in our little children’s choir, and I played baritone in my junior high band in 7th grade.\n\n“By the time I got to high school, my real passion was youth ministry, and I surrendered to that calling just before my junior year. I became a youth pastor right out of high school at Friendship Baptist Church, a little church in my hometown. When I first started serving in student ministry, the youth group needed some music on Wednesday nights. I learned how to play guitar so I could lead with a few students.”\n\nTyler served in student ministry for nine years at two churches in the area.\n\nA ‘new, exciting and unknown adventure’\n\n“In 2011, Genesis Baptist Church in Buna, where I had been serving for six years, sent me out as a ‘music missionary’ after I sensed God calling me to step out into this new, exciting and unknown adventure,” he said.\n\nYears later, the opportunity to share the gospel through music has taken his ministry full circle, as Tyler now attends Central Baptist Church in Buna with his own family.\n\nWhile influencing audiences around the country with a musical style that he describes as “Southern Soul,” Tyler was recognized as the National Male Vocalist of the Year by the Gospel Music Association at the Immerse Conference in 2012.\n\nIn 2013, his first solo album, The Story I Tell, debuted at No. 3 on the iTunes Christian/Gospel charts and ranked No. 93 on the overall iTunes chart. The album also garnered the No. 2 spot on Billboard Magazine’s Heatseeker Chart for the South Central United States region —Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico—for all genres released that week.\n\nThe Kitchen Sink\n\nTyler recently released, The Kitchen Sink EP, which debuted at No. 2 on the iTunes Christian/Gospel Charts.\n\nThroughout the year, Tyler typically performs 150 to 200 shows with locations ranging from coffee shops to concert venues. In addition to performing concerts, Tyler leads worship for church services, youth camps, retreats, conferences and Disciple Now weekends.\n\nThis summer, Tyler will lead worship for youth camps around the state, including Alto Frio Baptist Encampment in Leakey and Pineywoods Baptist Encampment in Woodlake.\n\nWhatever the venue, his goal remains the same—to share the gospel through music.\n\n“Any time I get to share Christ with someone, one on one, is the most special experience for me,” Tyler said. “I love being a storyteller from a stage platform, and watching people connect to the message behind the music is what motivates me to keep pressing on towards the goal.”"
