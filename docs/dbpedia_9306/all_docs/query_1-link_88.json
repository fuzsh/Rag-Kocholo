        "text": "Frontman and creator of Ministry Al Jourgensen says, \"We never intended for Cleveland with NIN to be our last show this year. Due to circumstances beyond our control we had to cancel Europe but we didn't want to end 2022 without one last show, and this will be one for the books.\"\n\nTickets are on sale now and available only at HITKOR.com. LIVE tickets are $17.99 (to both stream live and watch on demand). ALL ACCESS passes are $19.99 and include the stream plus bonus, behind-the-scenes content prior to the main show, as well as an exclusive interview with Ministry.\n\nPurchase tickets at: https://www.hitkor.com/shows/ministry-industrial-strength\n\nMinistry is fresh off the road, appearing with Nine Inch Nails and Nitzer Ebb for a once-in-a-lifetime show in Cleveland as well as Louder Than Life festival in September. In April, the industrial stalwarts wrapped up the much-anticipated Industrial Strength Tour that celebrated the 30th anniversary of landmark album The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste, receiving some of the best reviews of their career.\n\n\"The Industrial Strength Tour … was nothing less than extraordinary, complete with an ode to their early tours\" –Outburn\n\n\"It's shows like this that restore faith in unadulterated music\" —The Vinyl District\n\n\"Out of all the incarnations of Ministry throughout the years, this could be the tightest unit musically in the band's illustrious career\" —Splice Magazine\n\n\"This was a show as unique as its frontman, shrugging off many conventions in favor of a performance that truly fit Ministry's legacy. …The hunger for this tour was evident, and made this unforgettable headlining set even stronger\" —Bravewords\n\n\"As someone who's seen Ministry many, many times in his life, I'll say this show was different. The classic tracks had a renewed feel and sound and worked really well. From the audience reaction, this was a good combination\" —In The Loop\n\n\"Ending with new material, it was clear the band hasn't lost its touch. The chugging, siren-sounding guitars, machinelike drumbeats, electronic noises and Jourgensen's raspy talk-box vocals seemed to embody the state of the world today as accurately as they did during the '90s\" —San Antonio Current\n\n\"These guys aren't going anywhere, and the music world's a better place because of it\" —Glide Magazine\n\nIn addition to creator and founder Al Jourgensen, Ministry's full band will appear in the livestream show, including drummer Roy Mayorga (Stone Sour, Soulfly, Nausea), guitarists Cesar Soto (Man The Mute) and Monte Pittman (Madonna, Prong), bassist Paul D'Amour (Tool, Feersum Ennjin), and keyboardist John Bechdel (Killing Joke, Fear Factory).\n\nAs well as classic hits, some of the night's set list will include material from Moral Hygiene, Ministry's 15th studio album that features some of the project's strongest and most inspired material to date. It's the creative masterwork of founder and creator Jourgensen who spent the pandemic pause ruminating on the new world we as a society have found ourselves in – while pondering just what we are going to do about it.\n\nThe 10 tracks are a societal manifesto and plea for civilization to get back to a set of standards that lives up to and embraces our humanity. Previous singles have included \"Alert Level\" (sounding the alarm on the state society is in), \"Good Trouble\" (a rallying cry to fight for human rights in homage to Civil Rights leader John Lewis), \"Disinformation\" (the dangers of consuming mass media without critical thinking) and \"Search And Destroy\" (the unique take on The Stooges classic). The latter features guitar virtuoso Billy Morrison (Billy Idol/Royal Machines) who is also heavily featured on a number of songs on the album.\n\nMoral Hygiene is available now through Nuclear Blast Records in CD, vinyl and digital download formats at the following links:\n\nRecord label store: https://label.nuclearblast.com/ministry-moralhygiene\n\nBand store: https://store.ministryband.com/collections/moral-hygiene\n\nStream Moral Hygiene here: http://nblast.de/MinistryMoralHygiene\n\nABOUT MINISTRY\n\nBorn in 1981 in Chicago, Ministry has been the lifetime passion project of founder Al Jourgensen, considered to be the pioneer of industrial music. In its early days, Ministry was identifiable by its heavy synth-pop material in line with the new sounds and technology that were being developed in the '80s. Ministry's output began with four 12\" singles on Wax Trax! Records in 1981 before the first LP With Sympathy in 1983 via Arista Records. As time progressed however, so did Ministry, quickly developing a harsher, and more stylized sound that the band soon became infamous for on seminal albums Twitch (1986), The Land of Rape and Honey (1988), and The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste (1989). With the release of Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and The Way to Suck Eggs (1992), Ministry hit an all-time high in the mainstream musical realm and received its first Grammy nomination. In total, Ministry has been nominated for a Grammy award six times. Eight more albums would follow before an indefinite break in 2013, only to be unearthed again in 2018 with AmeriKKKant, continuing to reflect Jourgensen's views on the frightening state of society and politics. The band's latest effort, Moral Hygiene, came out October 1, 2021 on Nuclear Blast Records, ahead of upcoming tours planned for 2022.\n\nFind Ministry Online\n\nWebsite: http://www.ministryband.com\n\nFacebook: http://www.Facebook.com/WeAreMinistry\n\nTwitter: http://www.Twitter.com/WeAreMinistry\n\nInstagram: http://www.Instagram.com/WeAreMinistry\n\nAbout HITKOR\n\nHITKOR, a division of Online Events, LLC, is a premium online LIVE entertainment event and production company based in Los Angeles.
