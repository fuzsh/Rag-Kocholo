        "text": "Personnel Bio\n\nMUC Cedric Mayfield\n\nA native of Houston, Texas, Chief Musician Cedric Mayfield, clarinet, joined the U.S. Coast Guard Band in July 2010. He is a graduate of Southern Methodist University and the University of Memphis.\n\nCedric has performed in a variety of musical settings. He came to the Coast Guard Band by way of the U.S. Air Force Band in Europe, where he toured extensively as a band member, leader, and soloist. Prior to being stationed in Europe, he was a member of the U.S. Air Force Band of the West, stationed in San Antonio. In 2008, he was part of a specially collected group of musicians who embarked upon a three month tour of the Middle East as part of a troop morale and social outreach program. In the Air Force, he performed in a variety of ensembles, including concert band and chamber music groups, as well as jazz, pop, and rock bands. As a civilian, he has also performed with a national tour of the Broadway musical The Music Man and spent four seasons with Galveston Island Musicals. Many of his compositions and arrangements were featured as a founding member of the acclaimed ensemble the S.A. Jazz Workshop. Though he expresses himself in many genres, classical music is Cedric’s first love. He has had the privilege of sharing the stage with Wynton Marsalis, Chick Corea, Kirk Whalum, Bill Mays, Marvin Stamm, Shelly Carol, B.B. King, the Village Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, and many others.\n\nWhen not performing, composing, or practicing, Cedric enjoys spending time with his wife, Tamatha, and their children Jasmine, Alexus, Emmanuel, and Malaylah. He works tirelessly with his church, the Miracle Temple Church, where he performs with the music ministry and leads a men’s bible study and fellowship group. He also enjoys working out daily, playing sports, and watching a variety of movies."
