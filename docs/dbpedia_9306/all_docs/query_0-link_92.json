        "text": "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field, but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. (Matt. 13:24-25)\n\nJesus paints a picture of a beautiful wheat field, which was spoiled by an enemy. Coming into the field, the enemy planted another kind of seed – weeds.\n\nNow, if you’re a farmer, and weeds are sprouting up in the middle of your maturing crop, you know you can’t just go and jerk out all the weeds. The weeds’ roots are entwined with the wheat’s. If you pull up the weeds, you’ll destroy your harvest!\n\nJesus tells us this same thing happened in our world. At creation, God placed and planted all that was needed for a good earth, but the evil one sowed seeds of corruption through Adam’s sin.\n\nWhen we question why God doesn’t just eradicate all sin from the earth now, Jesus’ response is that his harvest of souls is not ready. If all corruption were suddenly uprooted, there would be no sorrow for sin and no desperation of soul to turn us to our Savior. Additionally, if God were to weed the world now of all sin, then there would be no sinners like you and me left for God’s eternal harvest.\n\nGod is good. He allows the weeds among the spiritual wheat of the world until his harvest of souls is ready. Then, he will redeem all those who have turned to him by confessing they need him. In his divine timing and by his patient grace, God cultivates the earthly fields in which our hearts mature to secure our souls for his heavenly storehouse.\n\nPrayer:"
