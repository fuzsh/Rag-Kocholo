From 2016-2018 he was the dean of the CSI faculty.\n\nHe was active as a voice teacher and his former students sing in many of the leading opera houses of Europe. He also enjoys scriptwriting. His recent script was a quarterfinalist in the Academy Nicolls Fellowship in the Screenwriting Competition sponsored by the Academy Awards.\n\nTenor Timothy Bentch was raised on a farm in Missouri. His first singing experiences took place in the local Mennonite church. Practicing scales on the tractor and in the silo eventually led him to a master’s degree at the acclaimed Curtis Institute of Music. For twelve years he lived in Hungary where critics referred to him as “a treasure in today’s Hungarian musical life”, naming him the most significant “Hungarian” lyric tenor of this generation. He has sung at all the leading venues in this country appearing before presidents and prime ministers with many television appearances and radio broadcasts. At the Hungarian State Opera, he premiered new productions as Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni, Belmonte in The Abduction, Nencio in L’Infeldelta delusa by Haydn and the Evangelist in a semi-staged version of Bach’s Saint Matthew Passion.\n\nOther roles with the Hungarian State Opera include Ferrando in Cosi fan tutte, Tamino in The Magic Flute, Tito in La Clemenza di Tito, and Alfredo in La Traviata. His performed opera repertoire of over 40 roles also includes such roles as Mozart’s Mitridate, Nemorino in L’Elisir d’amore, Edguardo in Lucia, Almaviva in The Barber of Seville, Ismaele in Nabucco, Fenton in Falstaff, Tom Rakewell in The Rake’s Progress, four roles in operas by Benjamin Britten, and numerous baroque operas – Jupiter in Semele, Nero in The Coronation of Poppea, Monteverdi’s Ulyssis, and Orfeo – a performance that marked the opening of the new theater in the Hungarian National Palace of the Arts in 2005. His performances have taken him to many other countries including the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, France, Malta, Israel, Russia, the UK, and Germany.\n\nIn symphonic repertoire, he has performed the entire standard repertoire from renaissance and baroque to the large works of Mahler and Verdi. Highlights have included the Evangelists in the Bach Passions, the Dream of Geronius by Elgar, and Mahler’s 8th Symphony which he recorded for Naxos. This recording was lauded by critics winning the “Recording of the Month” by Sterophile Magazine. Bentch’s performance was described as “bright, confident, and heroic, and his \"Blicket auf!\" is stunning.” Another critic wrote, “Bentch's top B-flats and Bs are as heroic as his sweet singing is sweet. His \"Blicket auf,\" a moment that can cause fear and trembling, is stirring in all the right ways.” A recent review in the BBC Music Magazine praised Timothy Bentch’s “heroic tenor” as one of the saving graces of a recent recording of Janacek’s Glagolitic Mass with the Warsaw Philharmonic. He has sung with the philharmonic orchestras of Lille, Strasbourg, Avignon, Saint Petersburg, Sofia, Warsaw, the Israeli Chamber Orchestra, the Ars Nova Symphony in Chicago, and appears regularly with the Hungarian National Philharmonic. His most recent performance with the HNP of the Britten War Requiem was critically acclaimed and broadcast live on national radio. He has sung under the batons of Zoltán Kocsis, János Fürst, Ádám Fischer, Tamás Vásáry, János Kovács, John Nelson, Jean Claude Casadesus, Antoni Witt, György Vashegyi, and Valentin Radu.\n\nUta Mulenga\n\nProject leader\n\nUta Mulenga\n\nAs a student Uta Mulenga was part of many Crescendo projects.

She also enjoys performing with different ensembles and orchestras throughout the UK.\n\nShe aims to bring Christian musicians together, so that these may encourage each other and are a blessing to the world around them – this is much in line with the overall vision of Crescendo.\n\nUwe Steinmetz\n\nAdvisor\n\nUwe Steinmetz\n\nUwe Steinmetz is the co-founder of Crescendo Jazz and also the advisor in the leadership team of this ministry.\n\nThe saxophonist and composer Uwe Steinmetz was born in Bremervörde, a town in northern Germany, in 1975. He derives his musical influence mainly form the teachers he studied and performed with during his school years in Berlin, Bern, Madras and Boston: John Surman, Lako Awraam, members of The Art Ensemble of Chicago, Bob Mintzer, Michael Brecker, David Liebman, George Russell, Jerry Bergonzi and Ben Schwendener among many others. He has performed his own music on four continents and in more than thirty countries. He has received national and international awards for his artistic work. Thus far he has released 12 CD of his own music and has made appearances as a soloist on numerous jazz CDs.\n\nIn an ever more fragmented society, as a Christian, Uwe seeks to increase awareness surrounding music and other art forms as an aid to experience deep healing and reconciling with the truth. In his role as an artist, he takes part in projects that foster and encourage an intercultural dialogue and support civil peace-building efforts.\n\nHis belief: \"Music unifies mind and soul and brings us closer to the truth in ourselves, the world and beyond all things. Music challenges us as human beings on all levels of our existence and ultimately shines a fresh, healing light on our momentary fears and longings, our perishable happiness and unhappiness. Music is a wonderful revelation of a creative God inspiring us to be creative with passionate love.\"\n\nVerena Dietrich\n\nCountry leader\n\nVerena Dietrich\n\nVerena Dietrich is the team leader of Crescendo in France.\n\n​Olga Botschenka\n\nCity & project leader"
