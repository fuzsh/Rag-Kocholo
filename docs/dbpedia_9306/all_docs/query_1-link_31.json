        "text": "Kids, the number of musical artists King Crimson is connected with is astounding, and we continue King Crimson connections week with the Gothic/Industrial/Metal band out of Chicago - Ministry.\n\nOh, what a dark turn this blog is taking today. However, Ministry didn't start out so grim and disturbing. When founded in 1981 by Al Jourgensen, Ministry was more of a new wave synthpop dance band. But, as the 80s progressed, the band took on a more aggressive sound.\n\nIn 1988, Ministry set up what would be a future connection with King Crimson by bringing in Bill Rieflin as their drummer. (In 2013, Rieflin became one of the three drummers for; you guessed it, King Crimson. That's right. Three drummers.) They also released their third album The Land of Rape and Honey that year, which features today's song Stigmata.\n\nThere is a video for Stigmata, however, we felt some of the imagery in the video was a bit too provocative and opted to go with this video-less version…\n\nMinistry had some charting success on the American Dance and Alternative charts in the 80s, but they were never to be found on Top 40 radio stations. Their best album charting success in the States came in the '90s with their albums Psalm 69 (1992) and Filth Pig (1996).\n\nOver the years there were many, many line-up changes and, at times, Ministry was almost an Al Jourgensen solo project. In 2008, the band came to an end… But, then, reformed in 2011 and have since released two albums: Relapse (2012) and From Beer To Eternity (2013).\n\nJourgensen has announced that the band will continue to tour, but will not record any new material. The live concert bonus footage is an entire set from 1983, while Ministry was in their more synthpop stage, taken at the legendary Minneapolis nightclub, First Avenue.\n\n- Jim \"Dr. Dim\" Fitzsimons and Douglas Arthur"
