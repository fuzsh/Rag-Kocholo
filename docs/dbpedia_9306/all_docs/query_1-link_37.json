The book also features an introduction by Jello Biafra and exclusive quotes from Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins), Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top), Rick Nielson and Robin Zander (Cheap Trick), Arabian Prince (N.W.A.), Richie Ramone (Ramones), Charlie Clouser (Nine Inch Nails), Paul D'Amour (Tool), David Ellefson (Megadeth), Davey Havok (AFI), Dave Lombardo (Slayer), Perry Farrell and Dave Navarro (Jane’s Addiction), Till Lindemann (Rammstein), Wayne Coyne and Steven Drozd (The Flaming Lips), Mark Mothersbaugh (Devo), Gibby Haynes (Butthole Surfers), Ian MacKaye (Fugazi), Tony Campos (Static-X), Scott Ian and Danny Lilker (Anthrax), Sean Yseult (White Zombie), Zach Hill (Death Grips), David J (Bauhaus), Youth and Jaz Coleman (Killing Joke), Jeff Matz (High on Fire), The Berserker Blothar (GWAR), Alexander Hacke (Einstürzende Neubauten), Chris Connelly (Revolting Cocks), and many more!\n\nSEE INSIDE!\n\nOrders typically ship within 24 hours of being placed but no later than 2 business days.
