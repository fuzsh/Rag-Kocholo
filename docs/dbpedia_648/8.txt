Out of the Box – New Paintings By Amrit Rai

Kim Eagles-Smith Galley will exhibit its first solo show of the paintings and works on paper by Indian born Marin painter Amrit Rai.

Amrit Rai was born in Delhi and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area when she was six years old. After secondary school Rai studied painting and drawing at Parsons School of Design and the Art Students League in New York. After her studies she returned to San Francisco and began studio practice. In the mid 1980’s she moved to Mill Valley, where she continues to live and make art.

Of her art Rai states; “Color is a central concern in my work. I am a formal painter in that regard. I love playing in the field of visual dynamics of color, composition, line, shape, space and light.

The meaning in my work comes directly out of the making. I love accidental combinations and how one color impacts another by its proximity.”
