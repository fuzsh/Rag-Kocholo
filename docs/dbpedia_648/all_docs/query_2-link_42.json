        "meta_description": "This chapter describes the newspaper networks that sustained and influenced reporting of the subcontinent in London and how the editorial stance of individual papers coloured their coverage. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw an increased interchange of news and information between Fleet Street and the Indian press. The Fleet Street tapped a range of sources, within both India and Britain, in forming its coverage of the subcontinent. The Times was the most influential British newspaper on India, with the largest financial outlay and a host of specialist leader writers, including D. D. Braham, Valentine Chirol, J. W. Flanagan, Lovat Fraser and Edward Grigg. The Morning Post's foreign news coverage under Lord Glenesk reflected his predilection for aristocratie government and monarchy. Geoffrey Dawson's concern with empire and the Raj was constant and acute.",
