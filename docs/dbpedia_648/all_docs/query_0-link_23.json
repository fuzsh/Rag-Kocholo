        "text": "Munshi Prem Chand is one of the few litterateurs in India who is more popular in his nickname/ pseudonym than in his name, Dhanpat Rai Shrivastav, given by the family/ parents. He was one of the most illustrious writers in Urdu and Hindi in the early twentieth Century. He is accredited with being able to write on communalism, poverty, corruption and exploitation as well as on colonialism. At times he is compared with his contemporary Bengali litterateur Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay as both were concerned with the way of life of the rural men and women and wrote in the languages of the common people.\n\nDhanpat Rai Shrivastav was born to Ajaib Rai and Anandi Devi on 31st July, 1880 in Lamhi village near the city of Banares (Varanasi). His grandfather Guru Sahai Rai was a Patwari (land record keeper). His father Ajaib Rai was a clerk in post office. His mother Anandi Devi was from a well-to-do family of Karauni Village in Sirauli Gauspur Tehsil of Bara Banki district of Uttar Pradesh. His mother was considered to be the inspiration for characterizing Anandi in his story “Bade Ghar Ki Beti”. He got the nick name “Nawab” from his uncle Mahabir Rai and he used “Nawab Rai” for his first pen name. When he was only 8 years old, his mother passed away after a long illness and after some time his grandfather also died. His father, when posted at Gorakhpur, remarried and he did not have loving relations with step mother. His father passed away after a protracted illness in 1897.\n\nAt the age of seven, his education began and he started learning Urdu and Persian from a Maulabi at a Madrasa in Lalpur, near to his native village. He learnt English at a Missionary school. He was enrolled at the Queens College in Banares and passed Matriculation in second division. Due to his father’s death and no provision of fee concession for students with second division at the Queen’s College, he aspired to get admitted in the Central Hindu College but became unsuccessful owing poor arithmetic skill. So, he had to discontinue his study for several years. In 1919 he obtained B. A. degree from Allahabad University.\n\nPrem Chand was married at the age of 15 in the year 1895 when he was studying in class IX. His marriage was arranged by his maternal step-grandfather. His wife was from a rich landlord family and older than him. He found her ill-tempered and bad looking. She and his step-mother used to squabble frequently. Once he scolded his wife and she attempted to commit suicide. Being distressed she went to her father’s house. Prem Chand did not also\n\ntake any initiative to take her back. However, in 1906 he married a child widow Shivarani who was the daughter of a village landlord near Fatehpur. For marrying a widow, he was harshly criticized. The couple had two sons – Sripat Rai and Amrit Kumar Rai. After the death of Prem Chand, his wife Shivarani wrote a book “Prem Chand Ghar Mein” in his memory.\n\nPrem Chand had to face tremendous struggle to meet his ends. He took up the job of a tutor of an advocate’s son on a monthly amount of Rs.5/- of which Rs.3/- used to be sent to his home. He used to stay in mud-cell over the advocate’s stable. After being overburdened with debts, once in 1899 he went to a book shop to sell some books. There he met the headmaster of Mission school at Chunar and he offered the job of a teacher on monthly salary of Rs. 18/-. He joined the job and also gave tuition to a student at monthly amount of Rs.5/-.\n\nIn 1900, he became Assistant Teacher in the Government District school at Bahraich (now a district in Uttar Pradesh) on a monthly salary of Rs.20/-. After three months he was transferred to the District school at Pratapgarh, He stayed there at an Administrator’s bungalow and gave tuition to his son. He went from Pratapgarh to Allahabad for training and then posted in Kanpur from May 1905 to June, 1909. From Kanpur he was transferred to Mahoba (a district in Bundelkhand region of U.P). Later he became Sub-Deputy Inspector of School and posted at Jamirpur in Maharajganj district. In 1916 he was promoted and became Assistant Master at Normal High School in Gorakhpur. In 1921 he was promoted to the post of Deputy Inspector of schools.\n\nIn a meeting in Gorakhpur on 8th February 1921 he met Mahatma Gandhi who gave a call to the people to resign from Government job in support of non-cooperation movement against the British rule in India. In spite his financial obligation to support his wife and children he resigned from the government job with the consent of his wife after five days of the meeting. After resigning the job, he came back to Benares on 18th March, 1921. Needless to say, until his death in 1936 he had to bear the brunt of financial hardship for quitting the job.\n\nAlthough Prem Chand had discontinuity in his formal education, he was never away from reading books. When he lost his mother and grandfather at the childhood, he found consolation in reading story books and gradually developed knack for extensive reading. He took the job of selling books for a book wholesale and this gave him ample opportunity to read numerous books. During his study at the missionary school he read several English fictions including George W.H. Reynold’s “The Mysteries of the Court of London” (in 8 volumes). His reading habit inculcated in him the aptitude for writing fictions, novels and plays. During the stay with his father at Gorakhpur he wrote his first fiction which was never\n\npublished and eventually lost. His first short novel in Urdu “Asrar-e-Ma’abid”(Devasthan Rahasya) written under the pseudonym “Nawab Rai” was published in a series in Benares based Urdu weekly Awaz-e-Khalk” during 1903 and 1905. The novel depicted corruption among the temple priests and their sexual exploitation of poor women. In 1910 his collection of short-stories “Soz-e-Watan” was published and it was banned as a seditious work. He was reprimanded and on the order of the British District Magistrate of Jamirpur, his house was raided and 500 copies of the book was burnt.\n\nOn the advice of Munshi Daya Narain Nigam, editor of the magazine Zamana”, he started using the pseudonym “Prem Chand” in the place of “Nawab Rai”. Later “Munshi “was prefixed to Prem Chand as an honour. In 1914 he started writing in Hindi and his first Hindi story, “Saut” was published in the magazine “Saraswati” in December 1915 and his first short-story collection in Hindi “Sapta Saraj” published in 1917. His first Hindi novel “Seva Sadan” was published in 1919.\n\nIn order to overcome financial difficulty, he established a printing press and publishing house “Saraswati” in 1923. In 1930, he came up with political weekly “Hans” and in 1931 he worked as an editor of the magazine “Maryada”, and became headmaster of Kashi Vidyapith for some time. During the holidays of Kashi Vidyapith, he became the editor of the magazine “Madhuri” in Lucknow.\n\nTo try his luck in film industry he moved to Bombay (Mumbai) on May 31, 1934. He worked as a Script writer for the Ajanta Cinetone, a production house, on a yearly salary of Rs. 8000/-. His script for the film Mazdoor, depicting the plight of the labour class, was directed by Mohan Bhawnan. In the film he also worked as a leader of the labourers. The film could not be released in Bombay due to meddling of some influential business men. Though the film was released in Delhi and Lahore, it was banned soon due to the workers’ agitation against the mill owners. Incidentally, the workers of his Saraswati press in Benares also went on a strike for non-payment of their salary. By 1934-35, the Saraswati press was under the debt of about Rs. 4000/-. After completing the one-year contact with Ajanta Cinetone, he returned to Benares on April 4, 1935. The owner of Bombay Talkies Himanshu Roy also attempted to convince him to work in Bombay but without success.\n\nHe wanted to settle In Allahabad where his two sons were studying and also to publish the magazine “Hans” from there. But on account of ill-health and pecuniary difficulty he handed over the Hans to the Literary Council and came back to Benares. A few months before his death, he was nominated as the first President of the Progressive Writers’ Association in Lucknow in 1936. After some days of illness, he passed away on October 8, 1936 leaving behind immortal creative legacy.\n\nPrem Chand wrote over 300 hundred short-stories, 15 novels (one was incomplete), 6 plays, 4 books for children and many essays & letters. Many of his works were translated into English and Russian languages after his death. Among his works, Kafan and Godaan are highly acclaimed creations. Godaan is regarded as one of the finest novels in Hindi. Due to the absence of good translation of his works, he was not much appreciated outside India during his life time. However, some of his works such as Sadgati, Shatranj Ke Khilari, Kafan, Seva Sadan, Gaban etc have been made into films by renowned directors like satyajit Roy, Mrinal Sen and others.\n\nPrem Chand throughout his life had suffered from economic deficiency. But such deprivation could not deter him rather reinforced his boundless fortitude to pen the realistic social, economic and political relationship prevalent in the society. There is not even an iota of doubt that his creative and heart touching writings will continue to inspire all young literary writers in India for centuries."
