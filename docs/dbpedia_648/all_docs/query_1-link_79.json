        "text": "Read the following passage and answer the question that follows by choosing the correct option:\n\nPrem Chand was born at Lamahi, a village about four miles away from Banaras, on 31 st July 1880 . He descended from a family that owned some six bighas of land and ran a large family. Prem Chand's grandfather, Gur Sahai Lal, was a patwari. His father was Ajaib Lal, a clerk in the post office earning about twenty five rupees a month. His mother was Anandi Devi, a good natured and accomplished woman, reminiscent of 'Barhe Ghar ki Beti.' It is to be noted that the heroine of this story is called Anandi.\n\nThe childhood of Prem Chand was spent in the village. He was a sportive and a lively boy, very fond of playing about, stealing things from the fields. He had a sweet tooth and was particularly fond of raw sugar. At Lamahi, he had his early schooling and picked up some Urdu and Persian from a Maulvi Sahib. It is on record that he was severely punished for stealing a rupee. His story 'Kazaki', is based on his own childhood memories. Kazaki was a postal messenger who travelled long distance and always brought back something with him for the child Prem Chand. In the short story he brings a little deer for the child and is dismissed for dereliction of duty, because chasing the deer had entailed great delay in returning to the post office. Kazaki is a human figure, full of dignity and self-respect, with the milk of human kindness overflowing within him.\n\nIt may be noted here that Prem Chand was a pen-name adopted by the author later on in years. He was named Dhanpat Rai and when he started writing short stories as a government servant, the pen-name used by him was Nawab Rai. Many described him as a Nawab throughout his life. When the government proscribed his first collection of short stories, 'Soze Watan', Prem Chand discarded the pseudonym Nawab Rai and all his later work appeared under the pen-name, Prem Chand."
