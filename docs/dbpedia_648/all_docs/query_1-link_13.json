        "meta_description": "The younger son of Munshi Premchand, Amrit was an important writer, translator and biographer in his own right <br/> <br/> It is a sad truth that the sprawling North Indian region that entertains delusions of replacing English with Hindi in every sphere of life often fails to appreciate, honour or cherish those who make lasting contributions to its literature, music, art and culture. It has hubris of power but not much love for Hindi or pride in the creative accomplishments of its own people who make the language richer.<br/>How else does one explain the near-total indifference shown by the Hindi world towards as significant a writer as Amrit Rai whose centenary was on September 3? Although he was one of the leading lights of the All India Progressive Writers’ Association (AIPWA) and a prominent Left intellectual, no writers’ organisation cared to remember him and his very considerable and significant contribution. If literary quarterly Lamhi, edited by Vijay Rai, had not brought out its July-September 2021 special issue on him, the amnesia-afflicted Hindi literary world would not even have become aware of his centenary year. Amrit was the younger son of Munshi Premchand who even today remains internationally the best known Indian writer besides Rabindranath Tagore. Amrit was not daunted by the formidable reputation of his father and managed to emerge as an important fiction writer, translator, intellectual and biographer in his own right. Little wonder that Harishankar Parsai, satirist par excellence, paid tribute to his charming personality by calling him the ‘Raj Kapoor of Hindi literature’.<br/>   Amrit Rai’s scholarly book ‘A House Divided: The Origin and Development of Hindi / Hindavi’ (1984).   | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement   <br/>  <br/>When Premchand died in 1936, Amrit was a mere lad of 15 years. Yet, he took over Hans, a literary journal founded by Premchand, as its editor and performed the job with great elan for at least 10 years from 1942 to 1952. This was a tumultuous period in the country’s history as it witnessed the Quit India movement, departure of the British and Partition, and communal violence and exchange of population on an unprecedented scale. Amrit brought out an Anti-Repression Special Issue of Hans that put the government’s policies in the dock, and wrote a long editorial listing the instances of repression. The Nehru government responded by banning the magazine in September 1949.<br/> <br/>This was also the time when he started shaping up as a short story writer, a leading member of AIPWA, and a translator of great merit. He also had to cross swords with the likes of Marxist critic Ramvilas Sharma, known for his Stalinist literary methods and diktats, and Rahul Sankrityayana, the scholar extraordinaire.<br/>While Rekha Awasthi, who has written a book on the progressive writers’ movement, tells us in her article in Lamhi that Amrit’s first collection of short stories titled Jeevan ke Pahalu (Aspects of Life) was published as early as in 1937 and was followed by Lal Dharti (Red Earth) and Toofanon ke Beech (In the Midst of Storms), Amrit himself says that his first book of short stories came out only in 1950. In his foreword to Lal Dharti, well-known Urdu fiction writer Kishan Chander wrote that Amrit’s short stories reflected the different aspects of contemporary reality very well. Yet, he had to face the hostility of Marxist critics like Ramvilas Sharma and Namwar Singh all through his life, making a balanced and realistic assessment of his creative output simply impossible in progressive circles. The right-wing literary camp for obvious reasons completely ignored him.<br/>Undaunted, he went on to set new landmarks. Even today, Hindi is not very rich in terms of biographies of writers and one can imagine what the situation was like in 1957 when he took upon himself the most challenging task of writing his father’s biography. When Qalam ka Sipahi (Soldier of the Pen) came out in 1962, it was immediately recognised as a masterpiece. Only one other biography has so far been able to receive comparable acclaim and recognition — Sharat Chandra Chatterjee’s biography Awara Maseeha (The Tramp Messiah) written by Vishnu Prabhakar.<br/>   Amrit Rai’s biography of his father was titled ‘Qalam ka Sipahi’ (Soldier of the Pen).   | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement   <br/>However, writing an objective and dispassionate biography of one’s father is a task unlike any other, and in this respect, Amrit’s biography of Premchand can be compared only with historian Sarvepalli Gopal’s biography of his father Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the philosopher who became the first Vice-President and the second President of independent India. Little wonder that it fetched him the prestigious Sahitya Akademi award the very next year. Here one cannot but mention yet another biography, titled Mila Tej se Tej ( Glow met with Glow), that Amrit’s wife Sudha Chauhan wrote of her mother and legendary Hindi poet Subhadra Kumari Chauhan.<br/>Amrit did not only write fiction and critical essays — his oeuvre consists of at least half-a-dozen collections of short stories, novels and critical essays each — but also translated several literary works from English, Urdu and Bangla into Hindi. His translations of How the Steel was Tempered and Spartacus are considered to be benchmarks in this field. Carrying forward the Urdu-Hindi tradition of Premchand, he was very concerned about the way a crack had developed between the two languages. He dealt with this theme in his scholarly book A House Divided: The Origin and Development of Hindi / Hindavi, published by Oxford University Press in 1984.<br/>Lamhi is the name of the village where Premchand was born. The journal Lamhi has become worthy of its name by presenting material of archival value on Amrit to celebrate his birth centenary.<br/>The writer is a senior Hindi poet and journalist who writes on politics and culture. | Metaglossia: The Translation World",

        "text": "But, is it? The answer to this is nuanced. Google self-identifies as the “best” search engine on the market. Its role in society should not be understated; Google revolutionized how people find and learn information. But Google doesn’t give consumers a lot of freedom to use anything else – it signs large checks to ensure it is the first website that appears on Apple’s Safari, and strong-arms Android users into keeping Google as their main search application. Look, I’m friends with people because I want to be, not because I have to be. Judge Amit Mehta’s decision this week in US v. Google forces people to finally contend with the idea that Google cannot, and should not, force us to rely on it as the only tool for access to information.\n\nLet’s dive into the decision. The US Department of Justice filed this suit in 2020, claiming that the company had monopolized the search engine market as well as the market for general search advertising. The DC District Court largely sided with the government, stating that Google violated antitrust law for its conduct in general search, but more narrowly determined that Google’s conduct is unlawful in the search text advertising market, rather than general search advertising. Judge Mehta found that Google’s exclusive agreements with Apple to be the default search engine, and with Android to lock users into using Google Search, deprive competitors of the opportunity to scale their own businesses while disincentivizing Google from truly innovating. Additionally, Judge Mehta determined that Google leveraged its power in the search market to dominate the text advertising market, hiking up text ad prices to boost its own profits while producing poorer quality ads and limiting any rival’s ability to attract revenue and ad dollars.\n\nIt’s hard to predict how Judge Mehta will approach remedies. Given the decision’s focus on exclusionary conduct, it’s likely that Mehta will issue a series of injunctions, beginning with barring Google from making payments to Apple to be the default search engine on iOS. Furthermore, it’s highly likely that Mehta will also stop Google from requiring Android users to pre-install Google Search while simultaneously preventing the installation of rival search engines. Finally, we can expect Judge Mehta to also prevent Google from establishing distribution agreements for text ads due to their exclusionary nature.\n\nBut Google’s anticompetitive conduct does not exist in a vacuum; its outsized market power in the online search market led to outsized harm. In the short term, injunctions would prevent the aforementioned unlawful conduct from repeating. But in the long term, a breakup of Google would prevent it from finding other ways to cut off competition and prevent users from choosing another search engine. To address Google’s liability, Mehta should not only explore injunctions, but also structural separation (meaning a breakup of some of Google’s lines of business).\n\nFor example, a breakup could start with Google divesting its ownership of the Android OS, tipping the scales of competitive pressure off of Android users so that they can easily switch search engines on their devices. Whatever the configuration, this much is clear: Google’s almost 90 percent dominance in the search market allows it to suppress rivals, pigeonhole consumers into using its products, and dominate adjacent markets. A breakup is key to mitigate long-term harm. Moreover, to ensure a breakup’s effectiveness, Google’s conduct should be overseen by a body of technical experts that understand the industry and antitrust to ensure Google doesn’t continue to wield its power anticompetitively. This body could take the form of a sector-specific digital regulator, which would be equipped to check Big Tech’s behavior – not just Google’s – as artificial intelligence and other technologies emerge.\n\nThe online technology sector has become home to several titans of innovation – the downside being those same titans have seized overwhelming control of the online marketplace. With this decision being one of the first in a growing list of Big Tech consumer protection litigation (including the digital advertising case against Google, and the cases against Apple and Amazon), many have wondered what the impact will be. I am hopeful that this means the other litigation outcomes will be favorable. Throughout this case, the government was able to break down the mechanics of Google’s platform and apply antitrust law to identify where anticompetitive harm exists. Many tech companies have consistently told regulators and policymakers that applying antitrust law to the complexities of online platforms was incorrect, as the mechanics are simply too complex for comprehension. This week showed that this couldn’t be further from the truth – no tech company, however quickly evolving, should be above the law.\n\nAntitrust enforcement serves as a tool to encourage necessary competitive pressure so that people can benefit from innovation on the features and values that matter most to them. Absent healthy market competition, the public’s relationship with the internet cannot grow and improve. To do so, the tech industry must operate on a level playing field by eliminating the cost of exclusion and lowering the barriers to entry, giving innovators and market disruptors a fighting chance. Congress plays a role here, too: it must pass proactive antitrust legislation that strengthens the law and addresses sector-specific dynamics to stop anticompetitive harm before it happens.\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://www.techpolicy.press/google-is-your-friend-but-it-shouldnt-be-your-only-friend/\n\nCNN — Like many manufacturers, DS Smith sorely needed more workers in 2022.\n\nThe multinational packing company’s corrugated box plant in Lebanon, Indiana, tried billboards, yard signs, jobs fairs and flyers at churches and fast-food restaurants but found it still took an average of three months to fill roles. That meant existing employees had to put in a lot of overtime, including some Saturday shifts.\n\nThen, the facility’s human resources manager, Becky Gordon, had a novel idea. She had noticed that the plant, which opened in 2019, had to turn away a growing number of job candidates who spoke only Spanish because it did not have bilingual personnel to interview, train and manage them.\n\n“In order to diversify and bring in more talent, we needed to be able to speak with people whose first language is not English,” Gordon said, noting the growing communities of recent Venezuelan and Nicaraguan immigrants in the nearby cities of Indianapolis and Frankfort.\n\nSo she decided to hire a full-time interpreter, then added two more. That has enabled the plant to boost its Spanish-speaking workforce to 92, or 42% of its staff, up from eight people, or 6%, in 2022. The facility, which pays $20 an hour to start, can now fill jobs in less than half the time.\n\nDS Smith launched the interpreter program as manufacturers were coming under pressure from all sides. The pandemic-fueled spike in online deliveries boosted demand for cardboard boxes, but the tight labor market made it hard for companies to find enough employees. At the same time, an influx of asylum seekers, many from Spanish-speaking countries, were looking for work.\n\nThe interpreter program is largely responsible for allowing the plant to triple the number of boxes it now produces annually compared to three years ago, in part because it is able to fully staff a third shift.\n\nWhile US companies have long worked with interpreters and translators, not many employ them as full-time staffers, according to translation and human resource experts. Instead, businesses may use language service firms, hire contractors or rely on bilingual employees to communicate with job applicants and workers.\n\n“At least three quarters, if not more, of the translation and interpreting workforce in the United States are independent contractors,” said Ben Karl, spokesperson for the American Translators Association, the largest professional organization for translators and interpreters in North America, referencing several national studies. “There are actually very few staff interpreters in the United States, and most of them work for the courts or for health care systems.”\n\nOpening doors\n\nThe first interpreter DS Smith hired was Elissa Ramirez, 27, who was born in Los Angeles. Ramirez moved with her mom to Mexico when she was 5 years old, and returned to the United States eight years ago in search of better opportunities. Speaking little English at the time, she found work at meat processing companies — always responding “yes” to her supervisor, even though she didn’t understand what he was saying because she was afraid of losing her job.\n\nLooking to advance, Ramirez learned English and now helps to make sure DS Smith’s Spanish-speaking workers aren’t in the same position as she was not that long ago.\n\nRamirez sits in on job interviews and orientation and has helped translate documents — from benefits information to machine operating instructions to safety presentations — from English to Spanish. She works on the floor with trainers and supervisors to teach Spanish-speaking workers how to use the equipment. Currently, she’s working on adding Spanish subtitles to training videos. Some of the translated materials are being shared at several of the more than a dozen other facilities that DS Smith operates in North America.\n\nInterpreter Elissa Ramirez, right, helps supervisor Stacey Thomas, center, train machine operator Eduardo Vera at DS Smith's packaging facility in Lebanon, Indiana.\n\nBecky Gordon/DS Smith\n\nThe interpreters on the afternoon and overnight shifts, who hail from Mexico and Puerto Rico, primarily work on the production floor to facilitate communication between the supervisors and trainers and the Spanish-speaking employees.\n\n“It was opening the doors not just for me, it was opening the doors for everyone who doesn’t speak English,” Ramirez, who is exploring careers in human relations or communications, said of the interpreter program.\n\nAlready, some of the immigrant workers have been promoted, and several are leading crews of Spanish-speaking colleagues.\n\nEduardo Vera is one of those workers. He arrived in the United States from Venezuela in 2021 and joined DS Smith the following year after working as a hospital custodian. Vera, 29, has since been promoted twice and is now a machine operator, which he said he couldn’t have achieved had he not been able to turn to Ramirez for help while training.\n\n“Here in this company, I get goals that I didn’t have before,” said Vera, with Ramirez acting as a translator. “My goal is to one day be a supervisor to help my team.”\n\nHiring challenges continue\n\nHiring remains competitive in Boone County, said Molly Whitehead, CEO of the Boone Economic Development Corporation.\n\nThe jobless rate in the county, where DS Smith is one of five corrugated box manufacturers, has been in the 2% or 3% range since mid-2020.\n\nIn such a tight labor market, companies have to offer different amenities to make themselves the employer of choice, Whitehead said. But she’s not aware of any other business with a formal interpreter program like DS Smith’s.\n\nThat effort has allowed DS Smith to cast a wider net in recruiting in Lebanon, the largest of its North American facilities and the only one to employ interpreters, said Monica Anderton, the company’s chief human resources officer for North America. Now, its immigrant employees are referring friends and family for jobs — including Vera, who brought his brother to work at the plant.\n\n“It really tapped an underutilized labor workforce that was out there that we weren’t aware of until we put this in place,” Anderton said.\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/07/business/spanish-interpreters-ds-smith-plant/index.html\n\n\"30th got school meh it's a Sunday leh.\" If we asked an average American what this online message means and what they can discern about its author, they would likely be baffled.\n\nBut if we asked a local here in Singapore, or someone who has been living here for a while, they would easily identify this as Singlish, and explain that the person communicating is expressing skepticism that there would be school on the 30th because that day is a Sunday.\n\nThey might make an informed guess that the author is Singaporean, and that they are expressing themselves very casually to someone they are close to, maybe a friend. As for the gender of the author, they might hazard a guess that the writer is more likely to be male, based on the forceful tone conveyed by the message's wording.\n\nDespite the access we have today to global media and the internet, researchers in linguistics (the study of language) have observed that our language use in \"digital\" contexts, like social media and SMS communication, remains highly regional, and is quite similar to how we speak in face-to-face-interactions.\n\nIn the context of Singapore, this means that Singlish (or, as many linguists call it, \"Colloquial Singapore English\"), our local English that has been shaped over time by varieties of Chinese, Malay, and other local languages, is used by many individuals not only in spoken communication, but also in online written communication.\n\nThe rise of digital communication presents exciting opportunities for linguists, and particularly for sociolinguists, who study how language functions in society. For many decades, sociolinguists at NUS have investigated topics related to how language is used in Singapore, including how Singaporeans with different social backgrounds speak and write in various situations.\n\nOne of the most significant achievements of linguistics research in Singapore to date is the development of a collection of real texts and conversations in Singapore English within the larger International Corpus of English (ICE), a set of linguistic databases that collects examples of English from around the world.\n\nThis corpus has helped linguists identify some of the many impacts of other languages on Singlish—for example, NUS Professor Bao Zhiming has used the corpus to examine how the Chinese language has influenced the structure of Singlish sentences that describe conditions and outcomes, such as, \"You eat already you can die one.\"\n\nBut the ICE-Singapore corpus was developed more than 20 years ago—so, while it is a valuable source of data for how Singapore English was used historically, there is a need to collect newer data to understand how Singaporeans use English today.\n\nMy colleague Associate Professor Mie Hiramoto had this need for updated data on Singapore English in mind in 2016 when she developed a concept for a new corpus. \"The idea for the project began as an exercise for my undergraduate module on language contact,\" she explained.\n\n\"I wanted students to work with some simple language data that they had easy access to—so, I thought of asking them to use their existing chat logs from WhatsApp.\"\n\n\"From a practical perspective, the study of language patterns connects with a number of industry sectors—automatic speech recognition, machine translation, forensic linguistics, speech therapy, and language teaching, among others.\n\n\"In terms of scientific inquiry, the structure of language varieties like Singlish, which arise from contact between multiple languages, can tell us crucial things about how the brain processes information.\"\n\nAfter seeing the wealth of data students were able to collect, Hiramoto realized that this corpus had significant potential beyond the scope of a class exercise. With this in mind, she obtained ethics approval to compile the data for research purposes upon receiving consent from the chat participants.\n\nEach year, students in the course were invited to contribute their anonymized WhatsApp messages. Ultimately, Assoc Prof Hiramoto said, \"it grew into the corpus we have today, of nearly 10.6 million words.\"\n\nWorking with an international team of linguistics researchers, including Professor Jakob Leimgruber at the University of Regensburg, Dr. Wilkinson Gonzales at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Jun Jie Lim at the University of California San Diego, and Mohamed Hafiz at NUS, Assoc Prof Hiramoto processed this large corpus of language data, now titled the Corpus of Singapore English Messages (CoSEM), and in 2022 released it publicly for the benefit of other researchers.\n\nThe data includes background information about each chat contributor, including their age, gender, ethnicity, and nationality—this sort of information is crucial for sociolinguists, because it allows us to investigate patterns in Singapore English among different social groups.\n\nWhat kinds of information can we learn from CoSEM? Let's return to the intuitions of the local Singaporean above, who felt that the example message was likely from a male author. In 2020, the CoSEM research team released an article investigating patterns in the use of \"sentence-final particles,\" meaning the famous particles such as lah, leh, and meh that are typical of Singlish.\n\nIn their analysis, the authors found that many of these particles, including meh, are indeed used significantly more frequently by men in the corpus. Not only this, but there are also major ethnicity-based differences in who uses which particles—for example, Indian Singaporeans use lah more frequently than other groups, while Chinese Singaporeans are the most frequent users of bah, which is one of the only discourse particles that originates from Mandarin (rather than Hokkien or Cantonese).\n\nUsing CoSEM data, Hiramoto and the research team were also able to identify usage patterns of new particles entering Singlish, such as sia—these findings underscore that Singlish is not a static variety, but, like all language varieties, continues to evolve over time.\n\nWhile these patterns are interesting to read about, some might wonder, why do linguists want to study Singlish in the first place? From a practical perspective, the study of language patterns connects with a number of industry sectors—automatic speech recognition, machine translation, forensic linguistics, speech therapy, and language teaching, among others.\n\nIn terms of scientific inquiry, the structure of language varieties like Singlish, which arise from contact between multiple languages, can tell us crucial things about how the brain processes information. And in the study of public policy, investigating how Singlish has changed over time can help us understand the role of local languages as symbols of national identity.\n\nFor all of these reasons, and more, linguists including Assoc Prof Hiramoto and myself in the Department of English, Linguistics and Theater Studies are passionate about investigating how people use language—even when sending a simple WhatsApp message.\n\nMore information: The Corpus of Singapore English Messages (CoSEM). osf.io/2ghj9/\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://phys.org/news/2024-08-singlish-digital-singaporeans-infuse-distinctive.html\n\nAbout four billion years ago, Earth resembled the set of a summer sci-fi blockbuster. The planet’s surface was a harsh and barren landscape, recovering from hellish asteroid strikes, teeming with volcanic eruptions, and lacking enough nutrients to sustain even the simplest forms of life.\n\nThe atmosphere was composed predominantly of inert gases like nitrogen and carbon dioxide, meaning they did not easily engage in chemical reactions necessary to form the complex organic molecules that are the building blocks of life. Scientists have long sought to discover the key factors that enabled the planet’s chemistry to change enough to form and sustain life.\n\nNow, new research zeroes in on how lightning strikes may have served as a vital spark, transforming the atmosphere of early Earth into a hotbed of chemical activity. In the study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of Harvard scientists identified lightning-induced plasma electrochemistry as a potential source of reactive carbon and nitrogen compounds necessary for the emergence and survival of early life.\n\n“The origin of life is one of the great unanswered questions facing chemistry,” said George M. Whitesides, senior author and the Woodford L. and Ann A. Flowers University Research Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology. How the fundamental building blocks of “nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites emerged spontaneously remains unanswered.”\n\nOne of the most popular answers to this question is summarized in the so-called RNA World hypothesis, Whitesides said. That is the idea that available forms of the elements, such as water, soluble electrolytes, and common gases, formed the first biomolecules. In their study, the researchers found that lightning could provide accessible forms of nitrogen and carbon that led to the emergence and survival of biomolecules.\n\nResearchers designed a plasma electrochemical setup that allowed them to mimic conditions of the early Earth and study the role lightning strikes might have had on its chemistry. They were able to generate high-energy sparks between gas and liquid phases — akin to the cloud-to-ground lightning strikes that would have been common billions of years ago.\n\nThe scientists discovered that their simulated lightning strikes could transform stable gases like carbon dioxide and nitrogen into highly reactive compounds. They found that carbon dioxide could be reduced to carbon monoxide and formic acid, while nitrogen could be converted into nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium ions.\n\nThese reactions occurred most efficiently at the interfaces between gas, liquid, and solid phases — regions where lightning strikes would naturally concentrate these products. This suggests that lightning strikes could have locally generated high concentrations of these vital molecules, providing diverse raw materials for the earliest forms of life to develop and thrive.\n\n“Given what we’ve shown about interfacial lightning strikes, we are introducing different subsets of molecules, different concentrations, and different plausible pathways to life in the origin of life community,” said Thomas C. Underwood, co-lead author and Whitesides Lab postdoctoral fellow. “As opposed to saying that there’s one mechanism to create chemically reactive molecules and one key intermediate, we suggest that there is likely more than one reactive molecule that might have contributed to the pathway to life.”\n\nThe findings align with previous research suggesting that other energy sources, such as ultraviolet radiation, deep-sea vents, volcanoes, and asteroid impacts, could have also contributed to the formation of biologically relevant molecules. However, the unique advantage of cloud-to-ground lightning is its ability to drive high-voltage electrochemistry across different interfaces, connecting the atmosphere, oceans, and land.\n\nThe research adds a significant piece to the puzzle of life’s origins. By demonstrating how lightning could have contributed to the availability of essential nutrients, the study opens new avenues for understanding the chemical pathways that led to the emergence of life on Earth. As the research team continues to explore these reactions, they hope to uncover more about the early conditions that made life possible and to improve modern applications.\n\n“Building on our work, we are now experimentally looking at how plasma electrochemical reactions may influence nitrogen isotopes in products, which has a potential geological relevance,” said co-lead author Haihui Joy Jiang, a former Whitesides lab postdoctoral fellow. “We are also interested in this research from an energy-efficiency and environmentally friendly perspective on chemical production. We are studying plasma as a tool to develop new methods of making chemicals and to drive green chemical processes, such as producing fertilizer used today.”\n\nHarvard co-authors included Professor Dimitar D. Sasselov in the Department of Astronomy and Professor James G. Anderson in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, and the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.\n\nThe study not only sheds light on the past but also has implications for the search for life on other planets. Processes the researchers described could potentially contribute to the emergence of life beyond Earth.\n\n“Lightning has been observed on Jupiter and Saturn; plasmas and plasma-induced chemistry can exist beyond our solar system,” Jiang said. “Moving forward, our setup is useful for mimicking environmental conditions of different planets, as well as exploring reaction pathways triggered by lightning and its analogs.”\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/08/how-did-life-begin-on-earth-research-zeroes-in-on-lightning-strikes/"
