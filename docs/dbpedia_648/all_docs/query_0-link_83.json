        "text": "The Indian subcontinent is justly famous for its linguistic diversity, and yet a single word occupies my attention here: Hindu. The term “hindu” is ubiquitous today, rolling off tongues in dozens of languages in and beyond modern South Asia to denote a religious community. But what might seem semantically and conceptually unproblematic at first blush is, upon further investigation, complicated nearly beyond belief. After all, how do we define “hindu”? Scholars are often unsure, putting “Hindu” and “Hinduism” in scare quotes, to mark these broad-based identities as too fuzzy, too rigid, or anachronistic.Footnote 2 Practitioners, too, sometimes prefer to not call themselves “hindu,” instead seeking out alternatives, a point hinted at in the epigraph and to which I return at the end of this article. But try as some may, we cannot escape the term “hindu,” which permeates our speech and frames our thinking. In pursuit of better understanding the rich history of “hindu”—and usefully unsettling the term’s discursive power—I trace multiple strands of its elastic and wide-ranging meanings over 2,500 years.\n\nReaders might object to the need and purchase of analyzing uses of “hindu.” In 2000, Donald Lopez stated that everyone is familiar with this bit of history: “the story of Indus to Sindhu to Hind to Hindu to Hinduism is well known by now” (832). Taking a different tact, Robert Frykenberg has argued: “‘Hinduism’ (if not the word ‘Hindu’) is a concept so soft and slippery, so opaque and vague, that its use all but brings critical analysis to a halt and intellectual discourse to the verge of paralysis (if not futility)” (Reference Frykenberg, Sontheimer and Kulke1989: 87). I contend that both views are mistaken. Most scholars do not, in fact, know the contextual and semantic ranges of “hindu” in specific languages and historical moments, a story far richer than a basic etymological sketch. Moreover, “hindu” and “Hinduism” have never been empty signifiers, and I seek to recover their malleability in specific, not general, terms. In a way, my project is the opposite of a dictionary, where one collates commonly used words to distill knowledge (Lynch Reference Lynch2016: 11). Instead, I trace a single term to ground and sharpen our language and ideas through historical insights. In contrast to earlier scholars who have attempted akin projects, I draw upon a substantially more robust set of primary sources—in Old Persian, New Persian, Sanskrit, Prakrit, Hindi, Marathi, and more—that offers the kind of multilingual story needed to understand a term that cuts across languages in South Asia.Footnote 3 Also, I do not treat premodernity as a prelude but rather recognize it as the heart of this tale. Much of South Asian history—including over 2,000 years of using the term “hindu”—has been misconstrued by focusing narrowly on the British colonial period and later. I offer a deeper consideration of South Asian pasts that can equip us to think more fruitfully about the identities that order our contemporary conceptual universe.\n\nThe word “hindu” has long existed alongside a set of related terms, including hind, hindī, hunūd (a plural), hindūstān, hindūī, hindavī, and hindūstānī. In pursuit of a manageable project, I do not trace this cluster of words, although I acknowledge slippage in their meanings. In particular, “hindu” often serves as a geographical and, later, linguistic marker. Both meanings are easier to grasp if we think of “hindu” within this assemblage of terms used to describe Indian cultures and societies. I include various spellings of “hindu,” including hinduka, hindush, hindua, himdu, hindura, and (in English-language sources) hindoo. Especially in the fourteenth century and later, “hindu” and associated terms are neither exclusively exonyms nor endonyms, a division that scholars have found fuzzy in many corners of the world (Woodman Reference Woodman2012). Critically, part of the story of “hindu” is precisely its multiformity and usage by discrete communities. Toward the end of the article, I discuss the advent of the English term “Hinduism” around 1800 and the neo-Sanskrit term “Hindutva” around 1920 because these abstractions have informed how many now demarcate and deploy “hindu.” Helpful to know at the outset is that use of “hindu” to denote a religious community occurs relatively late (fifteenth century CE at the earliest), and its use to describe or project followers of the broad-based religious tradition dubbed “Hinduism” today is far more recent. And so, recovering the history of “hindu” is, in part, an exercise of defamiliarization that, like the literary and artistic technique known by that name, can prompt us to reconsider afresh our shared vocabulary and attendant assumptions (Shklovsky Reference Shklovsky, Rivkin and Ryan1998)."
