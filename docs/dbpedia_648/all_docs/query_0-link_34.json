        "text": "Ansel Adams is widely regarded as one of the most famous photographers of all time, particularly in reference to his striking images of the American wilderness. Adams placed great value upon technical mastery of his craft, carefully evaluating gradations of light in the image, manipulating degree of exposure, and constantly experimenting with new techniques. Along with contemporaries Imogen Cunningham and Edward Weston, Adams founded the group f/64, devoted to what they termed \"straight photography,\" as opposed to staged or embellished images. Adams was also pivotal in the establishment of the Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nAnsel Adams (1902-1984) was born in San Francisco four years before the great earthquake of 1906. An aftershock of the earthquake threw him to the ground, breaking his nose and marking him for life. Adams first visited Yosemite in 1916 -- only two years after John Muir's death and three months before the founding of the National Park Service -- and was transfixed by the beautiful valley. In 1919, at age 17, he had his first contact with the Sierra Club when he took a job as custodian of the Club's LeConte Memorial Lodge, the Club headquarters in Yosemite National Park.\n\nAdams's interest in photography grew and often brought him up to the mountains accompanied by a mule laden with photographic gear and supplies. He became known as both an artist and defender of Yosemite. In 1934, Adams was elected as a member of the Board of Directors of the Sierra Club, a role he maintained for 37 years\n\nIn 1968 Adams was awarded the Conservation Service Award, the Interior Department's highest civilian honor, \"in recognition of your many years of distinguished work as a photographer, artist, interpreter and conservationist, a role in which your efforts have been of profound importance in the conservation of our great natural resources.\" In 1980 Adams received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, for \"his efforts to preserve this country's wild and scenic areas, both on film and on earth. Drawn to the beauty of nature's monuments, he is regarded by environmentalists as a national institution.\"\n\nIsabelle Yasmine Adjani was born in Gennevilliers, Hauts-de-Seine, a suburb of Paris, to Emma Augusta \"Gusti\" (Schweinberger) and Mohammed Adjani. Her father was a Kabyle Algerian, from Iferhounène, and her mother was a Bavarian German. She grew up speaking German fluently. After winning a school recitation contest, she began acting in amateur theater by the age of twelve. At the age of 14, she starred in her first motion picture, Blacky - Abenteuer eines Ausreissers (1970). Adjani has appeared in 30 films since 1970. She holds the record for most César Award for Best Actress (5), which she won for Possession (1981), Ein mörderischer Sommer (1983) (aka \"One Deadly Summer\"), Camille Claudel (1988), Die Bartholomäusnacht (1994) (aka \"Queen Margot\") and Heute trage ich Rock! (2008) (aka \"Skirt Day\"). She was also given a double Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award in 1981. She also received two Academy Award nominations for Best Actress. She performs in French, English, Italian and German. Adjani was made a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in 2010.\n\nBorn of a prominent Irish journalist in Dublin, Ireland, Dave Allen started out working and touring through English theatres and night clubs. Only occasionally working on radio, he made his first TV appearance on the BBC's \"New Faces.\" He managed to tour with The Beatles while they were still starting out and soon managed to get an eight-month TV engagement called Tonight with Dave Allen (1967), which ended as still one of the most successful shows in Australia. During 1969, he turned from comedy to making documentaries, but then in 1971, he returned to BBC television for \"Die Dave Allen-Show\" (1971), another top-rated show. In 1972, he lived out a lifetime ambition to do plays, soon playing both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook in \"Peter Pan\" for the London Coliseum. He followed up with two more TV specials in Australia. Floating between stage, television, and more documentaries, he premiered in America in 1981 with \"An Evening With Dave Allen.\" He died suddenly in March 2005.\n\nAllende became the Socialist President of Chile--elected by popular vote--in 1970 who was replaced by the now notorious Augusto Pinochet. It has been reported that Allende committed suicide. But it has not been determined whether his death was the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or by fire caused by invading troops in the military coup designed to oust him from office. In retrospect, many believe that his eventual downfall was the result of conflicts between the Chilean political Left and Right. Chile's Left drew its support from the urban poor and working class. The Right was supported by a cohesive upper class that was able to galvanize its resources from agrarian and industrial interests. Additionally, the Right was able to persuade the middle class to join its ranks. The threat of Allende's Socialist policies inevitably left his administration vulnerable to the assault of a much larger and better financed political Right. Moreover, his administration had to endure the hostility of the United States during the Cold War era that saw his rise to power as a \"Socialist\" threat to American Democracy and capitalism. Many records confirm that the United States subsidized anti-Allende strikes and vowed its support of the military which was virulently against his administration. Unfortunately, Chile inherited Pinochet as a military dictator in 1973; at present Pinochet has been charged with war crimes for atrocities committed against opponents of his totalitarian regime. Allende's brief three years as President of Chile, beginning in 1970, are seen by his supporters and admirers as one man's efforts to neutralize the tyranny and economic hegemony of the upper classes and elites. His detractors view him as a man who threatened the Chilean economy with Socialist economic policy. His administration and his death will inevitably continue to be discussed and debated for years to come. It should be noted that many members of Allende's family were necessarily forced to leave Chile, but have nevertheless done quite well for themselves; the most notable and visible of his survivors is critically and popularly acclaimed author Isabel Allende, his niece.\n\nTheo Angelopoulos began to study law in Athens but broke up his studies to go to the Sorbonne in Paris in order to study literature. When he had finished his studies, he wanted to attend the School of Cinema at Paris but decided instead to go back to Greece. There he worked as a journalist and critic for the newspaper \"Demokratiki Allaghi\" until it was banned by the military after a coup d'état. Now unemployed, he decided to make his first movie, Rekonstruktion (1970). Internationally successful was his trilogy about the history of Greece from 1930 to 1970 consisting of Die Tage von 36 (1972), Die Wanderschauspieler (1975), and Die Jäger (1977). After the end of the dictatorship in Greece, Angelopoulos went to Italy, where he worked with RAI (and more money). His movies then became less political.\n\nFred Astaire was born in Omaha, Nebraska, to Johanna (Geilus) and Fritz Austerlitz, a brewer. Fred entered show business at age 5. He was successful both in vaudeville and on Broadway in partnership with his sister, Adele Astaire. After Adele retired to marry in 1932, Astaire headed to Hollywood. Signed to RKO, he was loaned to MGM to appear in Ich tanze nur für dich (1933) before starting work on RKO's Flying Down to Rio (1933). In the latter film, he began his highly successful partnership with Ginger Rogers, with whom he danced in 9 RKO pictures. During these years, he was also active in recording and radio. On film, Astaire later appeared opposite a number of partners through various studios. After a temporary retirement in 1945-7, during which he opened Fred Astaire Dance Studios, Astaire returned to film to star in more musicals through 1957. He subsequently performed a number of straight dramatic roles in film and TV.\n\nBorn 8 May 1926, the younger brother of actor Lord Richard Attenborough. He never expressed a wish to act and, instead, studied Natural Sciences at Cambridge University, graduating in 1947, the year he began his two years National Service in the Royal Navy. In 1952, he joined BBC Television at Alexandra Palace and, in 1954, began his famous \"Zoo Quest\" series. When not \"Zoo Questing\", he presented political broadcasts, archaeological quizzes, short stories, gardening and religious programmes.\n\n1964 saw the start of BBC2, Britain's third TV channel, with Michael Peacock as its Controller. A year later, Peacock was promoted to BBC1 and Attenborough became Controller of BBC2. As such, he was responsible for the introduction of colour television into Britain, and also for bringing Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969) to the world.\n\nIn 1969, he was appointed Director of Programmes with editorial responsibility for both the BBC's television networks. Eight years behind a desk was too much for him, and he resigned in 1973 to return to programme making. First came \"Eastwards with Attenborough\", a natural history series set in South East Asia, then The Tribal Eye (1975) , examining tribal art. In 1979, he wrote and presented all 13 parts of Planet Erde - Das Leben auf unserer Erde (1979) (then the most ambitious series ever produced by the BBC Natural History Unit). This became a trilogy, with Die Erde lebt (1984) and Spiele des Lebens (1990).\n\nHis services to television were recognised in 1985, and he was knighted to become Sir David Attenborough. The two shorter series, \"The First Eden\" and \"Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives\" were fitted around 1993's spectacular Life in the Freezer (1993), a celebration of Antarctica and 1995's epic The Private Life of Plants (1995), which he wrote and presented. Filming the beautiful birds of paradise for Attenborough in Paradise (1996) in 1996 fulfilled a lifelong ambition, putting him near his favourite bird. Entering his seventies, he narrated the award-winning Wildlife Specials (1995), marking 40 years of the BBC Natural History Unit. But, he was not slowing down, as he completed the epic 10-part series for the BBC, Das Leben der Vögel (1998) along with writing and presenting the three-part series State of the Planet (2000) as well as Das Leben der Säugetiere (2002). Once broadcast, he began planning his next projects.\n\nHe has received honorary degrees from many universities across the world, and is patron or supporter of many charitable organisations, including acting as Patron of the World Land Trust, which buys rain forest and other lands to preserve them and the animals that live there."
