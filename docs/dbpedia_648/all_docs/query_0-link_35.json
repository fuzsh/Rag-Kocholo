        "text": "1469 CE Birth of Guru Nanak\n\nGuru Nanak, the first Guru (prophet-teacher) of what would become the Sikh tradition, is born in the village of Talwandi in what today is Pakistan. After a Divine revelation he leaves his home accompanied by Mardana, a Muslim musician, to spread his message.\n\n1539 CE Succession of Guru Angad\n\nGuru selects as his successor not one of his own sons but a devout disciple whom he names Angad, “My Limb.”\n\n1552 CE Guru Amar Das\n\nThe third Sikh Guru was a strong social organizer and social reformer. It is said that the Emperor Akbar came to visit him and was asked to sit and eat langar with others, high and low, before he met with the Guru. Amar Das established twenty-two manjis, “dioceses,” each under the supervision of designated spiritual leaders, some of whom were women.\n\n1574 CE Guru Ram Das Founds Amritsar\n\nThe fourth Guru, Guru Ram Das, establishes the town of Ramdaspur (now known as Amritsar) in the Punjab. At the city’s center is the Lake of Nectar, a holy site and meeting place for the Sikhs.\n\n1581 CE Guru Arjan Builds the Darbar Sahib\n\nThe fifth Guru, Guru Arjan, completes the Darbar Sahib, the great gurdwara at Amritsar, which becomes known as the Golden Temple because of its gilded dome.\n\n1604 The Sikh Scripture Assembled\n\nGuru Arjan compiles the first version of what would be named the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh scripture, and places it in the Darbar Sahib.\n\n1606 CE Guru Hargobind\n\nDuring the reign of Guru Hargobind, the “two-sword” theory of Sikh leadership is developed: one sword for religious authority and one for temporal authority.\n\n1606 CE Akal Takhat: The Throne of the Almighty\n\nThe temporal role of the Guru is symbolized by the seat called “The Throne of the Almighty” where decisions are made. The Sikhs establish their own royal court, similar to the Mughal court of the time, with the Guru as the royal and spiritual head.\n\n1644 CE Guru Har Rai\n\nThe seventh Guru, Har Rai is known for his support of the liberal Mughal Prince Dara Shikoh against his brother Aurangzeb.\n\n1661 CE Guru Har Krishan\n\nGuru Har Rai decides to pass the Guruship over his eldest son, Ram Rai, because he misinterpreted the meaning of one of Guru Nanek’s hymns. Ram Rai then becomes a power pawn of Aurangzeb (who is now Mughal Emperor) in his challenges to the Sikhs.\n\n1664 CE Guru Tegh Bahadur\n\nTegh Bahadur becomes the ninth guru in 1664, but is beheaded by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1675.\n\n1675 CE Guru Gobind Singh\n\nGobind Singh becomes the tenth Guru at the age of nine and reigns for thirty-three years, during which he focuses on communication.\n\n1699 CE Creation of the Khalsa\n\nGuru Gobind Singh creates the Khalsa, bestowing a distinct identity to the Sikhs. All Sikhs are expected to join the Khalsa by a special initiation and to wear five symbols that identify them as Sikhs: a sword, a specific kind of undergarment, a hair-comb, a steel bracelet, and uncut hair.\n\n1708 CE Guruship Passes to the Guru Granth Sahib and the Khalsa Panth\n\nGuru Gobind Singh is attacked by assailants in 1708.

He decides that Sikhs would no longer have an individual Guru.\n\n1799 CE Ranjit Singh Rules in Punjab\n\nRanjit Singh, a young and brilliant leader, gains power in Lahore and consolidates the twelve Sikh confederacies into one Sikh kingdom in the Punjab.\n\n1849 CE The Annexation of the Punjab\n\nAfter several wars (collectively known as the Anglo-Sikh Wars) and inter-Sikh rivalries, the Sikhs lose control of the Sikh kingdom and the Punjab is annexed to British India.\n\n1783-1854 CE Baba Dayal and the Nirankaris\n\nBaba Dayal (1783 – 1854) creates a movement to restore the orthodoxy of the early Sikh community by not only relishing the words the Guru’s hymns, but heeding to their true meaning.\n\n1816-1884 CE Baba Ram Singh and the Namdharis\n\nRam Singh is a social reformer who seeks to eliminate non-Sikh practices such as purdah, child marriage, and dowry from the Sikh community. He and his followers, the Namdharis, also fight vigorously against British control of India.\n\n1892 CE Khalsa College founded in Amritsar\n\nThis college is the first effort to combine traditional Sikh education and Western education.\n\n1919 CE Amritsar Massacre\n\nA protest gathering, including a large number of Sikhs, takes place in the walled court of Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar. The crowd is sprayed with rifle fire by order of British General Dyer, and as many as 1,500 individuals die.\n\n1920 CE Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee\n\nThe Supreme Gurdwara Management Committee (SGPC) is created by the Sikh authorities in Amritsar to manage all gurdwaras. During the same year the Sikh political party Akali Dal is formed.\n\n1921 CE Nankana Massacre (the Jallianwala Bagh massacre)\n\nWorried that SGPC or Akali leaders would take control of his gurdwara, the local leader of the Nankana gurdwara orders his guards to open fire on a group of Akali visitors. After news of the massacre spreads, the local government concedes that the Akali leaders could control the gurdwara, but tensions between the government and the Sikh community continue.\n\n1925 CE Sikh Gurdwaras Act\n\nThis act of the British colonial government, through the Punjab legislative council, approves the SGPC and puts gurdwaras under their care.\n\n1947 CE India Is Divided\n\nMillions of Sikhs are displaced during the partition of India into India and Pakistan, which sliced through the Punjab. Among the most painful losses for the Sikhs are the gurdwaras left behind, which include Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak. Thousands of Punjabis are killed, fleeing in both directions.\n\n1950 CE Sikhs and the Indian Constitution\n\nThe Akali Dal, the main Sikh political party, refuses to sign the new Indian constitution, arguing that the distinctiveness of the Sikh tradition is not recognized and their demand for a Punjabi-speaking state has not been included.\n\n1966 CE Punjab a Sikh Majority State\n\nThe Indian Parliament and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi accept the demand for a Sikh majority state in the Punjab, and the old Punjab is divided into Punjab and Haryana.\n\n1973 CE Anandpur Sahib Resolution\n\nThis resolution, adopted by the Akali Dal, seeks greater autonomy for the Punjab but firmly renounces separatism.\n\n1984 CE Indian Army Attacks the Golden Temple\n\nIn 1984, on the pretext of flushing out militant separatists, the Indian Army attacks the Golden Temple on the martyrdom anniversary of the temple’s constructor, the fifth Guru Arjan. Over a period of 8 days, the Indian Army attacks thirty-eight shrines across northern India, which some estimate to have killed thousands of Sikh pilgrims.\n\n1984 CE Indira Gandhi Assassinated\n\nA few months after the attack at the Golden Temple, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards in retaliation for ordering the attack. Anti-Sikh riots followed, leading to the massacre of several thousand Sikhs in Delhi and other cities of India.\n\n1993 CE Sikhs Meet at the Parliament of the World’s Religions in Chicago\n\nMore than twenty-five Sikhs from around the world are invited by the Sikh Host Committee to attend the Parliament of the World’s Religions in Chicago.\n\n2004 First Annual Sikh Film Festival Held at Hofstra University\n\nSONY, in conjunction with the International Punjabi Society and Hofstra University, hosts the first annual Sikh Film Festival, the success of which leads to the creation of the Sikh Art & Film Foundation in 2006.\n\n2010 U.S. President Bypasses Golden Temple, Generates Criticism\n\nJust before his trip to India in November 2010, news breaks that U.S. President Barack Obama’s itinerary will not include a stop at the Golden Temple in Amritsar as previously planned. The President, then mired in accusations at home that he might be Muslim, declines to cover his head as is required within the Sikh tradition when entering a holy place, irking many who felt such a move further promoted ignorance about and intolerance of both Sikhs and Muslims.\n\n2012 Sikhs Petition American President\n\nOver 40,000 Sikhs petition American President Barack Obama to recognize the 1984 mass murder of Sikhs as a genocide, but the administration tables the petition.\n\n2017 Jagmeet Singh Elected\n\nJagmeet Singh becomes the first non-white leader of a major political party, the New Democratic Party, in Canada.\n\n1903 CE South Asian Immigration to North America Begins\n\nIn 1903, twenty South Asians immigrate to North America.

Some Sikhs flee into Canada, where 400 are arrested.\n\n1907 – 1910 CE Immigration through San Francisco\n\nThough immigration of Indians was not illegal, immigration officials scrutinized immigrants carefully, rejecting many on medical grounds. In 1910, 1,403 Indians entered the U.S. through San Francisco.\n\n1910 – 1920 CE Sikh Farmers Settle in California\n\nThe Punjabi immigrants, most of them Sikh but some Muslim, settle in the San Joachin Valley in Central California and the Imperial Valley in Southern California. Beginning as farm workers, some become successful enough to lease and then buy land.\n\n1912 CE Khalsa Diwan Society\n\nThe Pacific Coast Khalsa Diwan Society is established in Stockton, California to provide support for Indians facing discrimination in the U.S. and for those seeking to end British rule in India.\n\n1912 CE The First Gurdwara built in the United States\n\nIn 1912, the first gurdwara in the United States is established in Stockton, California. For over three decades, it remains the only Sikh worship facility in the U.S.\n\n1913 CE Alien Land Law Passed\n\nThe California legislature passes the Alien Land Law, barring those ineligible for citizenship from leasing or owning land in California. After the 1923 Thind decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which established Indians or “Hindus,” as ineligible for citizenship, the Alien Land Law threatens the livelihood of many Sikh farmers.\n\n1913 – 1918 CE The Ghadar Party and Indian Freedom\n\nThe Ghadar Party, a movement of Indians in California seeking to overthrow British rule of India, becomes an international phenomenon as a few California Sikhs return to India in hopes of an armed revolutionary uprising. The Ghadar Party’s activities lead to the San Francisco “Hindu Conspiracy” trial in 1917-18.\n\n1917 CE Immigration Act of 1917\n\nCongress passes the Immigration Act of 1917, called the “Barred Zone Act,” which prohibits immigration from certain areas, including India. Legal immigration comes virtually to a halt for thirty years.\n\n1918 Hindustani Welfare and Reform Society\n\nCo-founded by Asa Singh (a Sikh), Fazil Din (a Muslim), and Ram Chand (a Hindu), this organization offers mutual aid to farmers in the Imperial Valley of California.\n\n1920s CE Sikhs in the Imperial Valley\n\nBy 1920, Sikhs lease more than 32,000 acres in Southern California’s Imperial Valley. Unable to bring wives from India, many choose to marry Mexican wives, thereby creating a distinctive Mexican-Sikh community.\n\n1923 CE Bhagat Singh Thind Denied Citizenship\n\nBhagat Singh Thind comes to the United States in 1912 and serves in the U.S. Army during World War I.

This act is passed largely through the efforts of Jagjit Singh and Anup Singh of the India League of America. The quota is so small that it did does appreciably increase the Sikh community, but it helps to rebuild Sikh family life.\n\n1948 CE Gurdwara Opens in El Centro, California\n\nImperial Valley Sikhs had worshipped in homes for decades until purchasing the Japanese Buddhist Temple in El Centro in 1947, since few Japanese returned to El Centro after release from detention camps.
