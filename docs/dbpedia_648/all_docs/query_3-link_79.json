We have also later registered our marriage. On this occasion, I would like to thank all those who have stood by me through all the difficult times that I faced recently. Last one and a half years have been particularly stressful and traumatic. I was the victim of a cyber crime, but was treated as a criminal. I was trolled and abused in most derogatory language for no fault of mine. Those who themselves have no concept or belief in love and dignity tried to shame me on social media. But all during this period, I kept a dignified silence and went on with my work, believing in myself and my love for Digvijaya.”"
