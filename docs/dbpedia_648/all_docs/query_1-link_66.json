        "text": "Midwives Heather Martin, Amrit Rai, Samantha Smith-Bird, Caitlin Bridson-Pateman and Lauren Kitchener are so excited to offer their services out of our new Southwest Edmonton location!\n\nOur address is 3474 93 Street NW, Unit 207. (Please note: this is NOT our mailing address. All mail can be sent to our Stony Plain office.) Our fax number is (587) 689-2296.\n\nTo apply for care with our midwives at this office, select “Passages Midwifery: Southwest Edmonton” from the waitlist.\n\nI hail from a little bit of both of Canada’s coasts with a bit of the middle mixed in. I am so pleased to be working with the Passages midwives, partnered with Amrit Rai.\n\nI have long felt that health professions were the place for me and pursued a dual program major in Public Health and Geography (medical concentration) while competing as a division 1 athlete south of the border. But I soon found that I felt stymied in my ability to be useful without a clinical skill set. The flame for midwifery was lit during my first pregnancy. At that time I was fortunate to receive midwifery care, before a move to a smaller city necessitated a transfer of care to a physician as there were no midwives in that city. I went on two have more children and was increasingly frustrated by the lack of midwifery services in my area. My public health training could see the incredible value that midwives offered in their evidence-based, person-centered approach and I wanted to be one of them. I would often research midwifery programs in the dark hours of the night while nursing my babies. Finally, when my littlest was seven months old I bit the bullet and applied to the Ontario Midwifery Education Program and was accepted.\n\nMy final year of education was spent in Southern Ontario working at Canada’s only midwifery-led and staffed hospital unit. I am so pleased to now work with the skilled midwives at Passages and look forward to being involved in your care.\n\nWhen not in clinic, at home visits or in hospital, you’ll find me searching for local adventures and treasures with my three boys and husband, curled up with a book, rowing on the water, or hunting for the next travel deal.\n\nPronouns: she/her"
