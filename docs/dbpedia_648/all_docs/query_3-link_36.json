To request related services - Do you feel that your child may benefit from speech, OT PT, or counseling services? Then request a meeting in writing to discuss related services. As a refresher, related services, per the Department of Education, are \"transportation and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education\" - Sec. 300.34 Related Services 2. To request additional testing - have you noticed additional needs that may require evaluation, OT services, PT services, a need for assistive technology, or concerns regarding Dyslexia? You can request an IEP meeting, in writing, and for an evaluation by the Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapist, or Assistive Technology. 3. Needing more intensive support or services - Is there a need for more intensive support or services that are already being provided? An example can be a child receiving services in the classroom via a small group (push-in) and noticing that they may benefit from receiving one-on-one instruction outside of the classroom (pull-out, one-on-one instruction). Make a request in writing to discuss further. 4. Your child has mastered their goals and it is time for new ones - Since your child has an IEP you should receive progress reports that report specifically on the progress your child is making on their IEP goals. Let's say you receive the report and notice they have mastered their goals. Yay! Time for new ones. Remember your child's goals should change yearly because the goal is to continue to progress so make a request in writing to discuss IEP goals. 5. To evaluate behavioral supports in place - Are you receiving multiple phone calls, remind messages, suspensions, or notes at home regarding your child's behavior? Then it might be time to evaluate what behavior supports are in place and maybe even time to request a FBA, in writing. Notice a theme? Always make your request in writing! #Usn #Usarmy #Usaf #Usmc #Ussf #Coastguard #SpecialEducation #Efmp #IEPMeetingRequest\n\nA comprehensive article 1/2 on the student veterans' lived experience at Chapman University. Specifically, how military-connected students formed a collective action toward just change by voicing their concerns to key stakeholders and creating an orientation. These articles highlight the need for a larger veteran resource center (current size: 231 square feet) to respect the privacy of military-connected students' PPI and create a comfortable environment where military-connected students can form a community with those who understand them so they can quickly acclimate to their new environment. Furthermore, more support staff who understand and meet veterans' benefit concerns and mental health issues. These needs build off of the California Community College VRC requirements to continue the care and support from the community college level to a 4-year university.\n\nAre you a veteran or family member of a veteran? I reserve a few appointments to serve referrals from SBHP. You may be eligible for 7-12 sessions FREE to you (I accept reduced fee from SBHP). I didn't serve but I admire the heck out of the clients that do & did. I have completed Tier One training to help me get the context of military culture & differences. I don't specialize in military 411 but I do specialize in healing your mind, body, heart, spirit, & soul. I can see clients that live in Missouri or Arkansas relative to my state licensure. We meet virtually. My SBHP clients/Veterans tend to have #CPTSD. Their #PTSD is often undertreated & they don't realize that: CPTSD = CHILDHOOD TRAUMA + ADULT SECONDARY TRAUMA. Preparing for trauma healing takes some prep. 7-12 sessions is not enough in my opinion but it's a start. Many of my SBHP clients continue with me after their approved sessions end as they recognize the value I provide to them & their family. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you. Your service & sacrifice matter to me. Your values & integrity are stellar. Your commitment & responsibility is top notch. #resetwithrenee #veteransday #ptsd #cptsd #traumahealing #healingversuscoping #ifs #emdr #cpatp\n\nüéâToday we celebrate 48 years of IDEAüéâ ‚ú®1975‚ú® - Congress enacted the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (Public Law 94-142) (EHA) ‚ú®1986‚ú® - Reauthorization mandated that states provide services to families of children with disabilities from the time they were born (originally it was once the child was 3 years old) ‚ú®1990‚ú® - EH became IDEA (individuals with disabilities education act) - Reauthorization added Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Autism as disability eligibility categories - ITP (individual transition plan) was added to the IEP as part of the IEP to help prepare individuals with disabilities with transition to post-secondary life ‚ú®1997‚ú®- Amendments - Challenge issued to improve results for children with disabilities and their families - Emphasized access to the general curriculum - States were given the authority to expand the ‚Äúdevelopmental delay‚Äù definition to include students up to age 9 - Required parents to use mediation to resolve disputes with schools and LEAs (local education agencies) and created the process for parents to do that ‚ú®2004‚ú®- Reauthorization - Early Intervention - Greater accountability and improved educational outcomes - Raised standards for instructors who teach special education classes ‚ú®2006‚ú® - Required schools to use research-based interventions in the process of assisting students OR determining eligibility for special education.

The NYSC (National Youth Service Corps) uniform is a symbol of unity and equality among corps members, but introducing ranks to differentiate between BSc and HND holders could lead to unintended consequences. While it's understandable to want to acknowledge the difference in academic qualifications, introducing ranks could: 1. Create division and hierarchy among corps members 2. Foster a sense of superiority or inferiority complex 3. Undermine the spirit of unity and equality that NYSC aims to promote 4. Lead to discrimination or bias against HND holders Instead, NYSC could consider other ways to recognize and appreciate the unique strengths and skills of both BSc and HND holders, such as: 1. Specialized training or workshops 2. Leadership roles or responsibilities 3. Mentorship programs 4. Recognition awards or certificates Let's focus on promoting inclusivity and celebrating diversity within the NYSC program!"
