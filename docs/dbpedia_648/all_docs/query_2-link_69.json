        "text": "III. Annotatorâs Afterword\n\nSri Ramachandra Guha, Historian\n\n@Ram_Guha\n\nramachandraguha.in\n\nBengaluru, Karnataka\n\nDear Ram Bhai:\n\nYour latest book on Gandhi, covering the years that changed the world, has received so many rave reviews, such complimentary plaudits from so many noted scholars, my own fulsome praise can only be a drop in an overflowing bucket. The book is a truly fundamental work, exhaustively researched and beautifully written. It is a book for the ages.\n\nI began reading the book in October while traveling through India. It was my constant companion for several weeks. I remember sitting at a bar in Bengaluru, drinking a beer and reading your book intently with pen in hand. The bartender approached me and asked â\"âSir, are you a professor?â I'm sure I'm the only person who ever sat at that bar reading a 1,000 page book and I smiled and responded âNot anymore, but I am still a student. Are you?â We had a long discussion about your book, about Mahadev Desai, about Dr. Ambedkar and Sardar Patel and Tilak and Nehru, and of course about Gandhiji and his amazing connection with people.\n\nAs I read your book, I also read the footnotes very carefully and was struck by how many of your sources were already available on-line. Of course, your exhaustive research in archives around the world is not (at least yet) available for people to access without undertaking the research you have performed so ably over the course of so many years. Likewise, very few in this world have your unparalleled knowledge of Gandhiji and India, nor your sure grasp of the long arc of history.\n\nDespite that, it struck me that it might be useful for people making a careful study of your book to be able to click into those sources that are available and dig deeper. If you quote a post-prayer meeting speech that Gandhiji delivered, perhaps a reader might wish to click into the Collected Works to read the full speech, or to see what letters the Mahatma wrote that day, or what visits he made the next, or even perhaps to listen to the All India Radio recording of that speech.\n\nWith that thought in mind, as an experiment, I removed your footnotes from my dog-eared copy, scanned them, and ran them through Optical Character Recognition (OCR). After a week fixing the OCR, I tried linking the cites to the Collected Works which I had posted in my Hind Swaraj collection on the Internet Archive. Because the page number and volume number of each book had been made part of the Internet address, I was able to quickly add links to all 999 citations to the Collected Works in your footnotes. Let me add how astonished I was that you had 999 citations! This is truly a work of massive scholarship you have produced.\n\nOver the next weeks, I became obsessed with this project, buying and scanning books I didn't have that were out of copyright, looking for on-line sources, and carrying around a printout of your footnotes with me at all times.\n\nWhy might one undertake such a project? It is because I think it shows the vast potential of the Internet if we are somehow able to move beyond todayâs world of Twitter trolls, WhatsApp fake news, and all else that is wrong with our net today. If somebody say something and cites a source, would it not be nice to e able to easily go read that source? And, what better place to demonstrate place to demonstrate this than a work such as yours that so carefully documents the sources behind your narrative?\n\nI believe universal access to all human knowledge is the great unmet promise of our times, but we must try much harder if we are to realize that promise. Knowledge has become colonized, and all too often access to knowledge is a matter of access to money. We can do better.\n\nAccess to knowledge is crucial to our future. Only by educating ourselves, by becoming an informed citizenry, can we reassert ownership of our democracies and begin to address the great challenges facing our societies today. Environmental carnage, poverty, disease, bigotry, religious intolerance, growing economic inequality, access to justice only if you have access to money, these are all issues that faced India during the fight for liberation and they are all issues we face in India and the world today. Without knowledge we cannot become a better society, a more just democracy. We cannot realize the hope for a better world that fueled the fight for liberation and should fuel our struggles today.\n\nThat knowledge has become colonized is not an inevitable outcome, it didn't have to be like this. We can change that, but only with great effort, only with continuous struggle. The Internet was built on the end-to-end principle, a decentralized net where anybody could run a service on their computer or invent a new way of communicating. We do not have to depend on unfeeling centralized monoliths like Facebook who use us as a product and sell the details of our lives to the highest bidder, to those that wish to meddle in our elections. This is not the Internet that could be, nor the Internet that we wished for when we set out to build the Internet.\n\nWhen I say knowledge has been colonized, I mean more than the clouds and centralized services. I mean the very core of knowledge. Scientists should not have to depend on a few Western corporations (ironically enough, many of them based in England) to access the scientific knowledge that has been colonized by those modern-day East India Companies. Scientists have become the new Indigo farmers. Journals are the new railroads they use to ship their raw materials off to London, and are then forced to buy back absurdly-priced finished goods to sow their next crop of knowledge.\n\nDid you know that schools like Jawaharlal Nehru University spend far more on journal subscriptions than they do on support for all their graduate students? Many regional schools do not have access to even the basics a bright student would need to educate herself. Services like Sci-Hub are but unlicensed salt factories on the edge of the ocean of knowledge. Access to knowledge is as essential to salt for human life.\n\nLinking your book to the other books you cite is but a small demonstration of the potential before us. Perhaps it is a trivial exercise, but I view it as a symbolic act. But for me, it shows us the road ahead. Imagine if we set out to scan the vast resources in the libraries of India? What if we set ourselves a goal of scanning three million books a year to build a true Public Library of India within a decade, a library with three crore books in all the languages of India. Nobody else will do that for India, India must do it for itself or it will not happen.\n\nIf we build that library, what if we also set out to make access to the Internet a universal right throughout the country, in all the villages and to all the people? What if the right to education and the practice your profession and the right to live were coupled with the right to knowledge became a reality, not just aspirational goals? We should set off down that road, we should make that crooked path straight.\n\nI know that the footnotes to your books are not enough to reach that shining city on the hill, but perhaps they are a stepping stone. I did this project without disclosing it to you, only recently informing you what I was doing. Indeed, I did not ask your permission or authorization, but I dearly hope to have your blessing.\n\nThank you so much for writing your amazing book.\n\nWith best regards and great admiration,\n\nCarl Malamud\n\nNew Delhi\n\nDecember 22, 2018\n\nIV. Transformation of the Notes\n\nThe following steps were undertaken for this transformation:\n\nThe footnotes from the Indian (Penguin) edition were removed from the binding and scanned.\n\nThe document was deskewed and run through Optical Character Recognition.\n\nThe footnotes were put back into lists. Bad line breaks (hyphens) were manually examined.\n\nItalics were not detected during OCR, they were manually put back in.\n\nTypography (single quotes, double quotes, em dashes, en dashes) were manually examined and fixed.\n\nLinks were added to the Collected Works. Minor inconsistencies in formatting were fixed.\n\nAll internal links (e.g., YouTube, web sites) were checked. Links to periodicals without metadata were annotated.\n\nA number of books that were out of copyright were purchased and added to the Hind Swaraj collection.\n\nLinks to commercial sites that have permanent archives (such as Economic and Political Weekly, Time, and New York Times) were added.\n\nA number of books and journals were added to the Hind Swaraj collection from sources such as the Gandhi Heritage Portal.\n\nThe Public Library of India collection was mined to add links to many books and periodicals.\n\nLinks to Google Books were added for books still in copyright.\n\nFootnotes were made individual addressable by chapter and footnote in the following form: Chapter01_Note01.\n\nV. Gandhi Jayanti 150 Challenge\n\nOctober 2, 2019 will be Gandhi Jayanti 150, a celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mohandas K. Gandhi. Throughout the year from October 2, 2018 to October 2, 2019, people throughout India and the world will be conducting activities to celebrate the legacy and spirit of Gandhiji.\n\nWe have set ourselves the task for making as many more of the links in these Notes of Guha on Gandhi Annotated to be live links, allowing people throughout the world to research the underlying materials that Ramachandra Guha drew upon in creating his magesterial biography of the Mahatma.\n\nThe following materials not yet linked have been identified as being of particular importance:\n\nArchives from the Times of India, Bombay Chronicle, Hindustan Times and many other periodicals\n\nThe Printed Record of the Mahatma Gandhi Murder Case is available in the rare books collection of the U.S. Law Library of Congress, which has declined a request to digitize the work because of copyright worries. We believe this document has fallen out of copyright and would like a law student in India to help us appeal their decision and/or obtain appropriate permissions from governmental authorities to convince the Library of Congress that duplication would be authorized.\n\nThe series Nicholas Mansergh, editor, Constitutional Relations Between Britain and India: The Transfer of Power, 1942â47, is held by The National Archives of the United Kingdom. In addition, Hathi Trust has 10 of the volumes, but has not made them available because of copyright concerns. We believe a letter from Her Majestyâs Printer (which is part of The National Archives) would be sufficient to persuade the Hathi Trust to make these documents freely available and a request has been sent to The National Archives requesting as such.\n\nThe Honâble Sabarmati Ashram runs the acclaimed Gandhi Heritage Portal, which makes available a number of key texts. Unfortunately, the texts are made available only as low-resolution bitmaps with burnt in watermarks and copyright assertions. We have respectfully requested to the Sabarmati Ashram that policies be changed to make available high-resolution scans without watermarks and are hoping for their consideration of this request.\n\nA large number of government reports are cited that would be quite useful to have online. Many of them are only available by visits to archives. Indeed, should not all works of government be made available more broadly?\n\nA number of old books published by Navajivan Trust are no longer available in print and are unobtainable on the used book markets. We are seeking assistance to locate and digitize those materials to make them broadly available as part of the important historical record. An example is the 10 volumes of Sardar Patel's Correspondence, edited by Durga Das and published by the Navajivan Press from 1971 to 1974.\n\nThe Nehru Memorial Museum & Library has a large number of pertinent documents and we would be obliged for their forbearance so that we might be able to enter discussions with this august institution on any assistance we may be able to provide in efforts to digitize these materials.\n\nThere are a number of books listed in the preceding notes which are out of print but in copyright. We are requesting permission from publishers such as Rupa, Oxford, UC Berkleley and others in the hope they might permit us to purchase the books on the used market and post them for non-commercial use. We would be pleased to acknowledge their consideration on the item description and provide a link back for readers to purchase their other fine works of scholarship that are still in print.\n\nSome materials are available on-line today, bu the scans are so poor and the material so important that they must be redone. A good example are the issues of Young India, which provide an amazing example to todays âbloggersâ on how prolific and effective a communicator Gandhiji was.\n\nIn my travels throughout India over the last few years (as well as in several decades of such work in the United States), I have noticed a reluctance of keepers of archives to making them fully available for people to read. The reluctance seems to be based on fear, fear that bad people will do bad things by distorting the words of those historical figures for whom the archivists are the guardians. But, one cannot keep bad people from doing bad things, one can only set a better example by shining the bright light of truth. Holding back archives only gives those who to promulgate untruth the only microphone in the house. Building a better web site, making the full archives available, that is the only way to fix fake news. When somebody says something wrong, you can point to the full text in context, you can point to the full works, to all the photos, audio, and video. People are smart and when they see one bad quote on WhatsApp, but they know that the complete works are available from the authoritative source, they will believe the source. My hope in 2019 is to continue that dialogue with the gatekeepers of India and around the world to encourage them, in the words of John Adams, to set every sluice of knowledge a-flowing.\n\nVI.
