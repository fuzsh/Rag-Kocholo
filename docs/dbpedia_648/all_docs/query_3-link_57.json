        "text": "LinkedIn (or should I say, companies): If your team can keep your team thriving even when you're missing people, then promote them! Ok but real talk: Why do companies look externally first when they already have great internal talent? Think about it: if a company has systems to develop the skills of their internal talent and promote within, then employees wouldn't want to leave. And the sad part? Companies don't realize this until their employee says \"I have an offer from another company\". For us at Wonsulting, we continuously promote within; if you've exceeded expectations early, we don't have to wait a year to promote you. You deserve a promotion when you're doing great work, not due to when you reach a certain time period. That should be the same for all of you. What do you think? If your company isn't promoting you, let's help you here: https://bit.ly/3L1cl2b Words of wisdom by Matt Wallaert :) #JWoW #Wonsulting #JobTips #StudentVoices\n\nBeware of these kinds of messages. Of course, it won't affect iPhone users. But, I tried checking out the link, It basically downloads an APK file something like icici-abx4.apk. I decompiled the APK and went through the code drilling down for 10-15 min. What all it does 1. Opens with ICICI logo & requests permissions to gain access to SMS permissions (READ_SMS, RECEIVE_SMS) and potentially steal sensitive information such as OTPs 2. Then opens a view with the ICICI internet banking phishing page, Asking to log in via Phone or UserID. 3. Once done it shows, you are logged in and then asks to do KYC. During the process, it takes PAN card, DOB, and ATM card details. 4. After that it shows ‚ÄúKYC successful it takes some time to process bla bla‚Äù 5. Runs in the background & keeps sending data to an API. So once done, Scammer gets your Mobile number, PAN card, DOB, and ATM Card details. BOOM! Money flies üí∏ ( Find more screenshots in my first comment ) And the spam number from which I received the SMS was located in (Patna, Bihar). Scammers are becoming more advanced these days! Please make sure to warn your parents, and friends not to click these kinds of links with the panic of getting the bank account blocked As a responsible citizen please do comment & repost this in your network for awareness. Please look into it on Priority - CyberDost Already reported to Cybercell, And the ICICI care team is on it ‚úÖ but it is not just with ICICI. So keep spreading the information. #span #fakemessages #fraudprevention #bankfraud #kyc #icici"
