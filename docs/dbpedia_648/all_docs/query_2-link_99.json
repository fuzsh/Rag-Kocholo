        "text": "This is the slightly revised “Foreword” to Govert Schüller’s Krishnamurti and the World Teacher Project: Some Theosophical Perceptions (Theosophical History Occasional Papers, Vol. V). Fullerton: Theosophical History, 1997): i–xiii. My purpose was to summarize the life of Jiddu Krishnamurti, to highlight his dissolution of the Order of the Star and the impact it had on the Theosophical Society, Mr. Schüller's study of the reactions to JK's persona and philosophy; the impact of Radha Rajagopal Sloss's revelations detailed in her book, Lives in the Shadow with J. Krishnamurti; Theosophical reactions to Neo-Theosophy, to which the World Teacher Movement belonged, through both the \"Back to Blavatsky\" Movement and the Australian Theosophical Society Loyalty League; and finally the Gnostic origin of the Theosophical teachings concerning the World Teacher.] * * * Clueless we go; but I have heard thy voice, Divine Unreason! harping in the leaves, And grieve no more; for wisdom never grieves, And thou hast taught me wisdom; I rejoice. (Aldous Huxley, The Cicadas) On February 17, 1986, the life of one of the great teachers of the twentieth century, Jiddu Krishnamurti, came to an end. No teacher who claimed to give the Truth has done so in so unconventional a manner: so totally contrary to the expectations of his followers, so utterly confusing to his detractors. His was a life that approximated the mystique befitting the archetypal religious teacher. The story of his early life is now familiar to his followers: a portentous birth impressed by his psychic mother's premonition that he, her eighth child, was someone who was not to be like other children 1 ; the discovery of the adolescent by the clairvoyantly gifted Charles W. Leadbeater (1854-1934) who asserted that K. 2 was to be overshadowed by a great Spiritual force in the person of Lord Maitreya, the World Teacher 3 ; and the first hint of this Force manifesting itself, in Benares on the 28th of December (1911). Leadbeater described this occurrence in The Herald of the Star 4 as a tremendous power, which was so evidently flowing through Alcyone [K.] that the next member [in line] fell at his feet, overwhelmed by this marvellous rush of force. I have never seen or felt anything in the least like it; it reminded one irresistibly of the rushing, mighty wind, and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost.\n\nThis paper presents an overview of the different ways the Indian spiritual teacher J. Krishnamurti (1895-1986) has been perceived in the Theosophical movement in which milieu Krishnamurti grew up. The vast majority of these views can be differentiated according to a matrix determined by the way Theosophists answered two basic questions concerning Krishnamurti. The first question concerns the expectation of and preparation for the coming of a great spiritual teacher who would use the body of Krishnamurti as a vehicle to express his teachings. The important question for many Theosophists at the time was, and for some still is: Was this project genuine or not? The second question was and is perceived by Theosophists as even more important. Was the outcome of the project successful or not? The possible answers to these two questions generate the four following positions: 1) The project was perceived as genuine and successful; 2) The project was perceived as genuine, but failed; 3) The project was perceived as not genuine and failed (of course); and 4) The project was perceived as not genuine, but succeeded! The Theosophical commentators and ideas presented in this paper are classified accordingly. The article will close with four additional views of Krishnamurti, which are all important from an epistemological perspective."
