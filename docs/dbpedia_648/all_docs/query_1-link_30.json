He received many prestigious awards including Sahitya Akademi Award in 1963 for his excellent biography of Premchand, Qalam ka Sipahi. He has also received Soviet Land Nehru Award in 1971.\n\nSargam, Hathi ke Dant, Dhuan etc are well-known among several novels he wrote. He also translated Shakespeare’s Hamlet in Hindi. His acclaimed critical works include Nai Sameeksha and Vichardhara aur Sahitya. Amrit Rai’s book A House Divided: The Origin and Development of Hindi/Hindavi is considered one of the most significant works over the Hindi-Urdu debate.\n\nA HOUSE DIVIDED: INTRODUCTION\n\nAmrit Rai in his book A House Divided: The Origin and Development of Hindi/Hindavi has taken up the issue of Hindi and Urdu. “Introduction: A Conspectus” is the first chapter of this book (same chapter has been prescribed for yours syllabus). By “A House Divided” Amrit Rai suggests that Hindi and Urdu were one language and at an advanced level of development the two languages split off. And the listing of Urdu and Hindi as two separate languages in Indian Constitution should be seen as political matter rather than philological.\n\nAmrit Rai shows that the term Hindi was understood in a variety of ways at different stages in history. He tries to point out different factors that are responsible for creating Hindi and Urdu as two saparate languages whereas their origin is one. It is only from early twentieth century that Urdu and Hindi are two independent languages.\n\nA HOUSE DIVIDED: SUMMARY\n\nAmrit Rai in his book A House Divided attempts a serious and deep rooted study in the origin of Hindavi language and investigates the causes that led to its division into modern Hindi and modern Urdu. Rai says that Amir Khusrau uses the term Hindi in specific sense and refers to the language Muslims first came in contact with in Punjab and Delhi. Hindi and Hindavi have been referred to the same language, to prove this point Rai quotes Amir Khusrau and Mohammad Aufi about Masud Sad Salman, an earlier poet. Amrit Rai quotes Khusrau saying:\n\n“Masud Sad Salman too is credited with three divans, one each in Arabic, Persian and Hindavi.”\n\nRai again quotes this time from Mohammad Aufi:\n\n“He (Masud Sad Salman) has three big collections of poems— one in Arabic, another in Persian, and a third in Hindi”\n\nAmrit rai wants us to note that Khusrau and Aufi have referred to the same language as Hindi and Hindavi. But the word does not mean modern or standard Hindi.\n\nRai refuses to accept the view of Gilchrist(Sir John Gilchrist of Fort William College) that Hindi/Hindavi is the property of Hindus alone because some of the greatest poets of this language have been Muslims. Even this language was there before the Muslim invasion of India but Hindi/Hindavi continued to grow.\n\nAmrit Rai says that the book A House Divided is a book of research about the origin of Hindi/Hindavi from socio-linguistic point of view and a search for causes that led to its division into present day Hindi and Urdu.\n\nAt this stage Amrit Rai quotes Gyan Chand, a noted scholar of Urdu. Gyan Chand says:\n\n“It is absolutely clear that Urdu and Hindi are not two separate languages. To call them two is to belie all principles of linguistics…. Enumerating Urdu and Hindi as two languages in Indian Constitution, is political expediency, not a linguistic reality.”\n\nIt is true Urdu has more words from Persian and Arabic, and Hindi has more Sanskrit words. This does not mean individual words change a language into some other language. Before the partition, Punjabi Muslims wrote Punjabi in Urdu script, the Sikhs in Gurumukhi, and Hindus in Devnagari, this did not mean that they wrote three different languages. Ehtesham Hussain, noted scholar of Urdu says:\n\n“The truth is that from the standpoint of linguistics, it is not correct to say that Hindi and Urdu are two different languages. No linguist has expressed such opinion.”\n\nRam Bilas Sharma, noted scholar of Hindi says:\n\n“Hindi-Urdu are not two separate languages; they are basically one and the same.”\n\nLater Amrit Rai quotes Gopichand Narang and Abdul Haq, two well known Urdu scholars, both of whom argue that Urdu and Hindi has a common lexical (vocabulary, word) base.\n\nAmrit Rai has given a number of quotations and quoted a variety of sources to show the complexity of the relationship between Hindi and Urdu. It is difficult to imagine how these two languages with such similarity have drifted so apart in their standard modern forms. Amrit Rai asks how the two languages came to adopt Arabo-Persian purism on the one hand and Sanskrit purism on the other hand? And the answer is more likely to be contemporary social forces rather than philological development.\n\nAmrit Rai says that present scenario of language research is changing heroes of Hindi and Urdu languages into enemies. The study of relation between Urdu and Hindi is very important because it is creating a social tension and political activism.\n\nThen, Amrit Rai says that before starting any impartial research to defuse this tension between Urdu and Hindi, we must go back to British colonial policy of divide and rule. It was Sir John Gilchrist of Fort William College who made sure to run Dept of Urdu and Dept of Hindi parallel. So the first point to start is Fort William College—and what was its language policy.\n\nA HOUSE DIVIDED: ANALYSIS\n\nPolitics play a particular role in the context of several languages, for instance, between Bangla/Asamiya/Oriya, or Marathi/Konkani, or Tamil/Hindi, etc. Here Amrit Rai examines the politics of language in the context of Hindi and Urdu.\n\nHindi and Urdu developed from the same origin, a language that was spoken in India, especially north India, the then cultural hub. This language was called Hindavi. Hindavi later split into modern Hindi and modern Urdu.\n\nMany factors mainly political and social established the notion of Hindi and Urdu being two separate languages and an antagonistic relation was emerged between them. Hindi was associated with Hindus and Urdu was associated with Muslims. And the two cultures were associated with two respective languages.\n\nThere are contradictory views on the relationship between Hindi and Urdu. Few scholars view them one and the same language while the others view them completely different languages. Urdu derived its words from Arabic and Persian, and Hindi from Sanskrit. However, the grammatical rules are the same and a large number of words are found in both the languages.\n\nAfter the partition Hindi became the official language of India and Urdu became the official language of Pakistan. And within Indian Constitution Hindi and Urdu were counted as two separate languages.\n\nBut it is an inescapable fact that the origin of these two languages is the same, Hindavi. Hindi and Urdu shared a common heritage over nearly five centuries – from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century – that embraced writings by Amir Khusrau, Kabir, Mirabai, Malik Mohammad Jayasi, Tulsidas, Bulleh Shah, among many others.\n\nHowever, it is an unavoidable reality that Hindi and Urdu began to be perceived as two different languages somewhere in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, in the run up to independence and partition of the country, the language spoken by the majority in the northern region was divided; Hindi and Urdu fell prey to the politically charged debate and got associated with different communities.\n\nThe seed of this division lays in the language policy of Fort William College where the Dept of Urdu and Dept of Hindi ran parallel. Sir John Gilchrist, professor of oriental languages at Fort William College, considered Hindi as “exclusive property of Hindoos” and “old language of India” which prevailed before the Muslim invasion.\n\nThe reality is contradictory to Gilchrist’s view because some of the greatest poets of Hindi language have been Muslims and some of the greatest poets of Urdu have been Hindus. Furthermore, Hindi language continued to grow after Muslims invaded India and what existed as Khariboli or Braj Basha developed into standard Hindi.\n\nTherefore, the roots of this division between Hindi and Urdu are in the policies of British colonial principle of divide and rule."
