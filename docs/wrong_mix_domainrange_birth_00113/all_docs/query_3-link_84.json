Cook, D.D.\n\nPREFACE\n\nWilliam E. Gladstone was cosmopolitan. The Premier of the British Empire\n\nis ever a prominent personage, but he has stood above them all. For more\n\nthan half a century he has been the active advocate of liberty, morality\n\nand religion, and of movements that had for their object the prosperity,\n\nadvancement and happiness of men. In all this he has been upright,\n\ndisinterested and conscientious in word and deed. He has proved himself\n\nto be the world's champion of human rights. For these reasons he has\n\nendeared himself to all men wherever civilization has advanced to\n\nenlighten and to elevate in this wide world.\n\nWith the closing of the 19th century the world is approaching a crisis\n\nin which every nation is involved. For a time the map of the world\n\nmight as well be rolled up. Great questions that have agitated one or\n\nmore nations have convulsed the whole earth because steam and\n\nelectricity have annihilated time and space. Questions that have sprung\n\nup between England and Africa, France and Prussia, China and Japan,\n\nRussia and China, Turkey and Armenia, Greece and Turkey, Spain and\n\nAmerica have proved international and have moved all nations. The daily\n\nproceedings of Congress at Washington are discussed in Japan.\n\nIn these times of turning and overturning, of discontent and unrest, of\n\ngreed and war, when the needs of the nations most demand men of\n\nworld-wide renown, of great experience in government and diplomacy, and\n\nof firm hold upon the confidence of the people; such men as, for\n\nexample, Gladstone, Salisbury, Bismark, Crispi and Li Hung Chang, who\n\nhave led the mighty advance of civilization, are passing away. Upon\n\nyounger men falls the heavy burden of the world, and the solution of the\n\nmighty problems of this climax of the most momentous of all centuries.\n\nHowever, the Record of these illustrious lives remains to us for\n\nguidance and inspiration. History is the biography of great men. The\n\nlamp of history is the beacon light of many lives. The biography of\n\nWilliam E. Gladstone is the history, not only of the English\n\nParliament, but of the progress of civilization in the earth for the\n\nwhole period of his public life. With the life of Mr. Gladstone in his\n\nhand, the student of history or the young statesman has a light to guide\n\nhim and to help him solve those intricate problems now perplexing the\n\nnations, and upon the right solution of which depends Christian\n\ncivilization--the liberties, progress, prosperity and happiness of the\n\nhuman race.\n\nHence, the life and public services of the Grand Old Man cannot fail to\n\nbe of intense interest to all, particularly to the English, because he\n\nhas repeatedly occupied the highest position under the sovereign of\n\nEngland, to the Irish whether Protestant or Catholic, north or south,\n\nbecause of his advocacy of (Reforms) for Ireland; to the Scotch because\n\nof his Scottish descent; to the German because he reminds them of their\n\nown great chancellor, the Unifier of Germany, Prince Bismarck; and to\n\nthe American because he was ever the champion of freedom; and as there\n\nhas been erected in Westminster Abbey a tablet to the memory of Lord\n\nHowe, so will the American people enshrine in their hearts, among the\n\ngreatest of the great, the memory of William Ewart Gladstone.\n\n\"In youth a student and in eld a sage;\n\nLover of freedom; of mankind the friend;\n\nNoble in aim from childhood to the end;\n\nGreat is thy mark upon historic page.\"\n\nCONTENTS.\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nANCESTRY AND BIRTH\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAT ETON AND OXFORD\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nEARLY PARLIAMENTARY EXPERIENCES\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBOOK ON CHURCH AND STATE\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTRAVELS AND MARRIAGE\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nENTERS THE CABINET\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMEMBER FOR OXFORD\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE NEAPOLITAN PRISONS\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE FIRST BUDGET\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE CRIMEAN WAR\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nIN OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nHOMERIC STUDIES\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nGREAT BUDGETS\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nLIBERAL REFORMER AND PRIME MINISTER\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE GOLDEN AGE OF LIBERALISM\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE EASTERN QUESTION\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nMIDLOTHIAN AND THE SECOND PREMIERSHIP\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHIRD ADMINISTRATION AND HOME RULE\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nPRIME MINISTER THE FOURTH TIME\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nIN PRIVATE LIFE\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nCLOSING SCENES\n\n[Illustration: Gladstone entering Palace Yard, Westminster.]\n\n\"In thought, word and deed,\n\nHow throughout all thy warfare thou wast pure,\n\nI find it easy to believe.\"\n\n--ROBERT BROWNING\n\nList of Illustrations.\n\nWILLIAM E.

GLADSTONE, 1897\n\nINTRODUCTORY.\n\nThere are few, even among those who differed from him, who would deny to\n\nMr. Gladstone the title of a great statesman: and in order to appreciate\n\nhis wonderful career, it is necessary to realize the condition of the\n\nworld of thought, manners and works at the time when he entered\n\npublic life.\n\nIn medicine there was no chloroform; in art the sun had not been\n\nenlisted in portraiture; railways were just struggling into existence;\n\nthe electric telegraph was unknown; gas was an unfashionable light;\n\npostage was dear, and newspapers were taxed.\n\nIn literature, Scott had just died; Carlyle was awaiting the publication\n\nof his first characteristic book; Tennyson was regarded as worthy of\n\nhope because of his juvenile poems; Macaulay was simply a brilliant\n\nyoung man who had written some stirring verse and splendid prose; the\n\nBrontï¿½s were schoolgirls; Thackeray was dreaming of becoming an artist;\n\nDickens had not written a line of fiction; Browning and George Eliot\n\nwere yet to come.\n\nIn theology, Newman was just emerging from evangelicalism; Pusey was an\n\nOxford tutor; Samuel Wilberforce a village curate; Henry Manning a young\n\ngraduate; and Darwin was commencing that series of investigations which\n\nrevolutionized the popular conception of created things.\n\nPrincess, afterwards Queen Victoria, was a girl of thirteen; Cobden a\n\nyoung calico printer; Bright a younger cotton spinner; Palmerston was\n\nregarded as a man-about-town, and Disraeli as a brilliant and eccentric\n\nnovelist with parliamentary ambition. The future Marquis of Salisbury\n\nand Prime Minister of Great Britain was an infant scarcely out of arms;\n\nLord Rosebery, (Mr. Gladstone's successor in the Liberal Premiership),\n\nLord Spencer, Lord Herschell, Mr. John Morley, Mr. Campbell-Bannerman,\n\nMr. Asquith, Mr. Brice, Mr. Acland and Mr. Arnold Morley, or more than\n\nhalf the members of his latest cabinet remained to be born; as did also\n\nthe Duke of Devonshire, Mr. Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain, among those who\n\nwere his keenest opponents toward the end of his public career.\n\nAt last the end of Mr. Gladstone's public life arrived, but it had been\n\nextended to an age greater than that at which any English statesman had\n\never conducted the government of his country.\n\nOf the significance of the life of this great man, it would be\n\nsuperfluous to speak. The story will signally fail of its purpose if it\n\ndoes not carry its own moral with it. We can best conclude these\n\nintroductory remarks by applying to the subject of the following pages,\n\nsome words which he applied a generation ago to others:\n\nIn the sphere of common experience we see some human beings live and\n\ndie, and furnish by their life no special lessons visible to man, but\n\nonly that general teaching in elementary and simple forms which is\n\nderivable from every particle of human histories. Others there have\n\nbeen, who, from the times when their young lives first, as it were,\n\npeeped over the horizon, seemed at once to--\n\n\"'Flame in the forehead of the evening sky,'\"\n\n--Whose lengthening years have been but one growing\n\nsplendor, and who at last--\n\n\"------Leave a lofty name,\n\nA light, a landmark on the cliffs of fame.\"\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nANCESTRY AND BIRTH\n\nAll history, says Emerson, \"resolves itself into the biographies of a\n\nfew stout and earnest persons.\" These remarks find exemplification in\n\nthe life of William Ewart Gladstone, of whom they are pre-eminently\n\ntrue. His recorded life, from the early period of his graduation to his\n\nfourth premiership, would embrace in every important respect not only\n\nthe history of the British Empire, but very largely the international\n\nevents of every nation of the world for more than half a century.\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone, M.P., D.C.L., statesman, orator and scholar,\n\nwas born December 27, 1809, in Liverpool, England. The house in which he\n\nwas born, number 62 Rodney Street, a commodious and imposing\n\n\"double-fronted\" dwelling of red brick, is still standing. In the\n\nneighborhood of the Rodney Street house, and a few years before or after\n\nthe birth of William E. Gladstone, a number of distinguished persons\n\nwere born, among them William Roscoe, the writer and philanthropist,\n\nJohn Gibson, the sculptor, Doctor Bickersteth, the late Bishop of Ripon,\n\nMrs. Hemans, the poetess, and Doctor James Martineau, Professor of\n\nMental and Moral Philosophy in Manchester New College, and the brother\n\nof Harriet Martineau, the authoress.\n\nThe Gladstone family, or Gledstanes, which was the original family name,\n\nwas of Scottish origin. The derivation of the name is obvious enough to\n\nany one familiar with the ancestral home. A _gled_ is a hawk, and that\n\nfierce and beautiful bird would have found its natural refuge among the\n\n_stanes_, or rocks, of the craggy moorlands which surround the\n\n\"fortalice of gledstanes.\" As far back as 1296 Herbert de Gledstane\n\nfigures in the Ragman Roll as one of the lairds who swore fealty to\n\nEdward I. His descendants for generations held knightly rank, and bore\n\ntheir part in the adventurous life of the Border. The chief stock was\n\nsettled at Liberton, in the upper part of Clydesdale. It was a family of\n\nScottish lairds, holding large estates in the sixteenth century. The\n\nestate dwindled, and in the beginning of the seventeenth century passed\n\nout of their hands, except the adjacent property of Authurshiel, which\n\nremained in their possession for a hundred years longer. A younger\n\nbranch of the family--the son of the last of the Gledstanes of\n\nArthurshiel--after many generations, came to dwell at Biggar, in\n\nLanarkshire, where he conducted the business of a \"maltster,\" or\n\ngrain merchant.\n\nHere, and at about this time, the name was changed to Gladstones, and a\n\ngrandson of the maltster of Biggar, Thomas Gladstones, settled in Leith\n\nand there became a \"corn-merchant.\" He was born at Mid Toftcombs, in\n\n1732, and married Helen Neilson, of Springfield. His aptitude for\n\nbusiness was so great that he was enabled to make ample provision for a\n\nlarge family of sixteen children. His son, John Gladstone, was the\n\nfather of William E. Gladstone, the subject of our sketch.\n\nSome have ascribed to Mr. Gladstone an illustrious, even a royal\n\nancestry, through his father's marriage. He met and married a lovely,\n\ncultured and pious woman of Dingwall, in Orkney, the daughter of Andrew\n\nRobertson, Provost of Dingwall, named Ann Robertson, whom the\n\nunimpeachable Sir Bernard Burke supplied with a pedigree from Henry III,\n\nking of England, and Robert Bruce, of Bannockburn, king of Scotland, so\n\nthat it is royal English and Scottish blood that runs in the veins of\n\nMr. Gladstone.\n\n\"This alleged illustrious pedigree,\" says E.B. Smith, in his elaborate\n\nwork on William E. Gladstone, \"is thus traced: Lady Jane Beaufort, who\n\nwas a descendant of Henry III, married James I, of Scotland, who was a\n\ndescendant of Bruce. From this alliance it is said that the steps can be\n\nfollowed clearly down to the father of Miss Robertson. A Scottish writer\n\nupon genealogy, also referring to this matter, states that Mr. Gladstone\n\nis descended on the mother's side from the ancient Mackenzie of Kintail,\n\nthrough whom is introduced the blood of the Bruce, of the ancient Kings\n\nof Man, and of the Lords of the Isles and Earls of Ross; also from the\n\nMunros of Fowlis, and the Robertsons of Strowan and Athole. What was of\n\nmore consequence to the Gladstones of recent generations, however, than\n\nroyal blood, was the fact that by their energy and honorable enterprise\n\nthey carved their own fortunes, and rose to positions of public esteem\n\nand eminence.\" It has been their pride that they sprang from the ranks\n\nof the middle classes, from which have come so many of the great men of\n\nEngland eminent in political and military life.\n\nIn an address delivered at the Liverpool Collegiate Institute, December\n\n21, 1872, Sir John Gladstone said; \"I know not why the commerce of\n\nEngland should not have its old families rejoicing to be connected with\n\ncommerce from generation to generation. It has been so in other\n\ncountries; I trust it may be so in this country. I think it is a subject\n\nof sorrow, and almost of scandal, when those families who have either\n\nacquired or recovered wealth and station through commerce, turn their\n\nbacks upon it and seem to be ashamed of it. It certainly is not so with\n\nmy brother or with me. His sons are treading in his steps, and one of my\n\nsons, I rejoice to say, is treading in the steps of my father and\n\nmy brother.\"\n\nGeorge W.E. Russell, in his admirable biography of Mr. William E.\n\nGladstone, says, \"Sir John Gladstone was a pure Scotchman, a lowlander\n\nby birth and descent. Provost Robertson belonged to the Clan Donachie,\n\nand by this marriage the robust and business-like qualities of the\n\nLowlander were blended with the poetic imagination, the sensibility and\n\nfire of the Gael.\"\n\nAn interesting story is told, showing how Sir John Gladstone, the father\n\nof William E. Gladstone, came to live in Liverpool, and enter upon his\n\ngreat business career, and where he became a merchant prince. Born at\n\nLeith in 1763, he in due time entered his father's business, where he\n\nserved until he was twenty-one years old. At that time his father sent\n\nhim to Liverpool to dispose of a cargo of grain, belonging to him, which\n\nhad arrived at that port. His demeanor and business qualities so\n\nimpressed Mr. Corrie, a grain merchant of that place, that he urged his\n\nfather to let him settle there. Consent was obtained and young Gladstone\n\nentered the house of Corrie & Company as a clerk. His tact and\n\nshrewdness were soon manifest, and he was eventually taken into the firm\n\nas a partner, and the name of the house became Corrie, Gladstone\n\n& Bradshaw.\n\nJohn Gladstone on one occasion proved the temporary preserver of the\n\nfirm of which he had become a member. He was sent to America to buy\n\ngrain for the firm, in a time of great scarcity in Europe, owing to the\n\nfailure of the crops, but he found the condition of things the same in\n\nAmerica. There was no grain to be had. While in great perplexity as to\n\nwhat to do he received advices from Liverpool that twenty-four vessels\n\nhad been dispatched for the grain he was expected to purchase, to bring\n\nit to Europe. The prospect was that these vessels would have to return\n\nto Europe empty as they had come, and the house of Corrie & Company be\n\ninvolved thereby in ruin. It was then that John Gladstone rose to the\n\nemergency of the occasion, and by his enterprise and energy saved\n\nhimself and partners from financial failure, to the great surprise and\n\nadmiration of the merchants of Liverpool. It was in this way: He made a\n\nthorough examination of the American markets for articles of commerce\n\nthat could be sold in Europe to advantage, and filling his vessels with\n\nthem sent them home. This sagacious movement not only saved his house,\n\nbut gave him a name and place among the foremost merchants of his day.\n\nHis name was also a synonym for push and integrity, not only on the\n\nLiverpool exchange, but in London and throughout all England. The\n\nbusiness of the firm became very great and the wealth of its members\n\nvery large.\n\nDuring the war with Napoleon, on the continent, and the war of 1812 with\n\nthe United States, the commerce of England, as mistress of the seas, was\n\ninjured, and the Gladstone firm suffered greatly and was among the first\n\nto seek peace, for its own sake and in the interests of trade. In one\n\nyear the commerce of Liverpool declined to the amount of 140,000 tons,\n\nwhich was about one-fourth of the entire trade, and there was a decrease\n\nof more than $100,000 in the dock-dues of that port. John Gladstone was\n\namong those who successfully petitioned the British government for a\n\nchange of its suicidal policy towards the American States.\n\nAfter sixteen years of successful operations, during a part of which\n\ntime it had been government agent, the firm was dissolved and its\n\nbusiness was continued by John Gladstone. His six brothers having\n\nfollowed him from Leith to Liverpool, he took into partnership with him\n\nhis brother Robert. Their business became very extensive, having a large\n\ntrade with Russia, and as sugar importers and West India merchants. John\n\nGladstone was the chairman of the West India Association and took an\n\nactive part in the improvement and enlargement of the docks of\n\nLiverpool. In 1814, when the monopoly of the East India Company was\n\nbroken and the trade of India and China thrown open to competition, the\n\nfirm of John Gladstone & Company was the first to send a private vessel\n\nto Calcutta.\n\nJohn Gladstone was a public-spirited man and took great interest in the\n\nwelfare of his adopted city. He was ever ready to labor for its\n\nprosperity, and consequently endeared himself to the people of all\n\nclasses and conditions, and of every shade of political opinion.\n\nThe high estimation in which he was held by the citizens of Liverpool\n\nwas especially manifest October 18, 1824, when they presented him with a\n\ntestimonial, consisting of a magnificent service of plate, of\n\ntwenty-eight pieces, and bearing the following inscription: \"_To John\n\nGladstone, Esq., M.P., this service of plate was presented MDCCCXXIV, by\n\nhis fellow townsmen and friends, to mark their high sense of his\n\nsuccessful exertions for the promotion of trade and commerce, and in\n\nacknowledgment of his most important services rendered to the town of\n\nLiverpool_.\"\n\nJohn Gladstone, though devoted to commerce, had time for literary\n\npursuits. He wrote a pamphlet, \"On the Present State of Slavery in the\n\nBritish West Indies and in the United States of America; and on the\n\nImportation of Sugar from British Settlements in India.\" He also\n\npublished, in 1830, another pamphlet, containing a statement of facts\n\nconnected with the same general subject, \"in a letter addressed to Sir\n\nRobert Peel.\" In 1846 he published a pamphlet, entitled \"Plain facts\n\nintimately connected with the intended Repeal of the Corn Laws; or\n\nProbable Effects on the Public Revenue and the Prosperity of\n\nthe Country.\"\n\nFrom the subject discussed it can be readily and truly imagined that\n\nJohn Gladstone had given thought to political subjects. He was in favor\n\nof a qualified reform which, while affording a greater enfranchisement\n\nof the people, looked also to the interests of all. Having an opinion,\n\nand not being afraid to express it, he was frequently called upon to\n\naddress public meetings. The matters discussed by him were, however,\n\nrather national than municipal, rather humane than partisan. He was a\n\nstrong advocate for certain reforms at home in 1818, and in 1823 on the\n\nseas, and for Greek independence in 1824. \"On the 14th of February,\n\n1824, a public meeting was held in Liverpool Town Hall, 'for the purpose\n\nof considering the best means of assisting the Greeks in their present\n\nimportant struggle for independence.' Mr. Gladstone spoke impressively\n\nin favor of the cause which had already evoked great enthusiasm amongst\n\nthe people, and enlisted the sympathies and support of Lord Byron and\n\nother distinguished friends of freedom.\"\n\nIt was in 1818 that he addressed a meeting called \"to consider the\n\npropriety of petitioning Parliament to take into consideration the\n\nprogressive and alarming increase in the crimes of forging and uttering\n\nforged Bank of England notes.\" The penalties for these crimes were\n\nalready heavy, but their infliction did not deter men from committing\n\nthem, and these crimes increased at an enormous rate. Resolutions were\n\npassed at the Liverpool meeting, recommending the revision and amendment\n\nof existing laws.\n\nThen again, so late as the year 1823, the navigation between Liverpool\n\nand Dublin was in a lamentable condition, and human life was recklessly\n\nimperiled, and no one seemed willing to interfere and to interest\n\nhimself in the interests of humanity. It was then that he again came to\n\nthe front to advocate a just cause. To illustrate the dangers to vessels\n\nand passengers, the case of the sloop _Alert_ may be cited. It was\n\nwrecked off the Welsh coast, with between 100 and 140 persons on board,\n\nof whom only seventeen were saved. For the safety and rescue of all\n\nthose souls on board this packet-boat there was only one small shallop,\n\ntwelve feet long. Mr. Gladstone was impressed with the terrible nature\n\nof the existing evil, and obtained an amendment to the Steamboat Act,\n\nrequiring imperatively that every passenger vessel should be provided\n\nwith boats sufficient for every passenger it was licensed to carry. By\n\nthis wise and humane provision thousands of lives were doubtless saved\n\nthat would otherwise have been lost--the victims of reckless seamanship\n\nand commercial greed.\n\nJohn Gladstone, either through the influence of Mr. Canning, or from\n\nhaving imbibed some political taste, sat in the House of Commons nine\n\nyears, representing Lancaster in 1819, Woodstock from 1821 to 1826, and\n\nBerwick in 1827; but he never would consent to sit in Parliament for the\n\ncity of Liverpool, for he thought that so large and important a\n\nconstituency required peculiar representation such as he was\n\nunqualified to give.\n\nHe was the warm supporter and intimate friend of the celebrated Canning.\n\nAt first he was a Whig, but finally came to support Mr. Canning, and\n\nbecame a Liberal Conservative. In 1812 he presided over a meeting at\n\nLiverpool, which was called to invite Mr. Canning to represent the\n\nborough in Parliament. After the election the successful candidates were\n\nclaimed and carried in procession through the streets. The procession\n\nfinally halted at Mr. Gladstone's house, in Rodney Street, from the\n\nbalcony of which Mr. Canning addressed the populace. His election laid\n\nthe foundation of a deep and lasting friendship between Mr. Canning and\n\nMr. Gladstone. \"At this time the son of the latter was but three years\n\nof age. Shortly afterwards--that is, as soon as he was able to\n\nunderstand anything of public men, and public movements and\n\nevents\"--says G.B. Smith, \"the name of Canning began to exercise that\n\nstrange fascination over the mind of William Ewart Gladstone which has\n\nnever wholly passed away,\" and Mr. Gladstone himself acknowledged that\n\nhe was brought up \"under the shadow of the great name of Canning.\"\n\nJohn Gladstone presided at a farewell dinner given by the Liverpool\n\nCanning Club, in August, 1822, in honor of Mr. Canning, who had been\n\nGovernor-General of India. But Mr. Canning, instead of going to India,\n\nentered the British Cabinet, and in 1827 became Prime Minister, and John\n\nGladstone moved a congratulatory address to the king upon the formation\n\nof the Canning Ministry.\n\nIn 1845 John Gladstone was created a baronet by Sir Robert Peel, but he\n\nlived to enjoy his deserved honors but a short time, for he died in\n\n1851, at the advanced age of eighty-eight. His motto had ever been,\n\n\"Diligent in business.\" His enormous wealth enabled him to provide\n\nhandsomely for his family, not only after death, but during\n\nhis lifetime.\n\nAt the time of his father's death, William E. Gladstone was still an\n\nadherent of the Tory party, yet his steps indicated that he was\n\nadvancing towards Liberalism; and he had already reached distinction as\n\na statesman, both in Parliament and in the Cabinet, while as yet he was\n\nbut 42 years old, which was about half of his age when called for the\n\nfourth time to be Prime Minister of England.\n\nSir John Gladstone and his wife had six children--four sons, Thomas\n\nGladstone, afterwards baronet; John Gladstone, who became a captain, and\n\ndied in 1863; Robert Gladstone, brought up a merchant, who died in 1875,\n\nand two daughters, Annie McKenzie Gladstone, who died years ago, and\n\nHelen Jane Gladstone. William E. Gladstone was the fourth son. The\n\nfollowing is from the pen of the son, who says of his aged father, Sir\n\nJohn Gladstone: \"His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated; he\n\nwas full of bodily and mental vigor; whatsoever his hand found to do he\n\ndid it with his might; he could not understand or tolerate those who,\n\nperceiving an object to be good, did not at once and actively pursue it;\n\nand with all this energy he gained a corresponding warmth, and, so to\n\nspeak, eagerness of affection, a keen appreciation of humor, in which he\n\nfound a rest, and an indescribable frankness and simplicity of\n\ncharacter, which, crowning his other qualities, made him, I think, and I\n\nstrive to think impartially, nearly or quite the most interesting old\n\nman I ever knew.\"\n\nPersonally, Sir John Gladstone was a man of much intelligence and of\n\nsterling principle, of high moral and religious character, and his\n\nhouse consequently was a model home. \"His house was by all accounts a\n\nhome pre-eminently calculated to mould the thoughts and direct the\n\ncourse of an intelligent and receptive nature. There was a father's\n\nmasterful will and keen perception, the sweetness and piety of the\n\nmother, wealth with all its substantial advantages and few of its\n\nmischiefs, a strong sense of the value of money, a rigid avoidance of\n\nextravagance and excesses; everywhere a strenuous purpose in life,\n\nconstant employment, and concentrated ambition.\"\n\nMrs. John Gladstone, the wife and mother, is described by one who knew\n\nher intimately as \"a lady of very great accomplishments; of fascinating\n\nmanners, of commanding presence and high intellect; one to grace any\n\nhome and endear any heart.\"\n\nThe following picture of the everyday life of the family is interesting\n\nand instructive, on account of Sir John Gladstone, as well as on that of\n\nhis more distinguished son, and is from the pen of an eye-witness:\n\n\"Nothing was ever taken for granted between him and his sons. A\n\nsuccession of arguments on great topics and small topics\n\nalike--arguments conducted with perfect good humor, but also with the\n\nmost implicable logic--formed the staple of the family conversation. The\n\nchildren and their parents argued upon everything. They would debate as\n\nto whether a window should be opened, and whether it was likely to be\n\nfair or wet the next day. It was all perfectly good-humored, but curious\n\nto a stranger, because of the evident care which all the disputants took\n\nto advance no proposition, even as to the prospect of rain, rashly.\"\n\nIn such a home as this was William E. Gladstone in training as the great\n\nParliamentary debater and leader, and for the highest office under the\n\nBritish crown. This reminds us of a story of Burke. The king one day,\n\nunexpectedly entering the office of his minister, found the elder Burke\n\nsitting at his desk, with his eyes fixed upon his young son, who was\n\nstanding on his father's desk in the attitude of speaking. \"What are you\n\ndoing?\" asked the astonished king. \"I am making the greatest minister\n\nEngland ever saw,\" was the reply. And so in fact, and yet all\n\nunconsciously, was Sir John doing for his son, William.\n\nWilliam E. Gladstone \"was born,\" says his biographer, G.W.E. Russell,\n\n\"at a critical moment in the fortunes of England and of Europe. Abroad\n\nthe greatest genius that the world has ever seen was wading through\n\nslaughter to a universal throne, and no effectual resistance had as yet\n\nbeen offered to a progress which menaced the liberty of Europe and the\n\nexistence of its States. At home, a crazy king and a profligate\n\nheir-apparent presided over a social system in which all civil evils\n\nwere harmoniously combined. A despotic administration was supported by a\n\nparliamentary representation as corrupt as illusory; a church, in which\n\nspiritual religion was all but extinct, had sold herself as a bondslave\n\nto the governing classes. Rank and wealth and territorial ascendency\n\nwere divorced from public duty, and even learning had become the\n\nhandmaid of tyranny. The sacred name of justice was prostituted to\n\nsanction a system of legal murder. Commercial enterprise was paralyzed\n\nby prohibitive legislation; public credit was shaken to its base; the\n\nprime necessaries of life were ruinously dear. The pangs of poverty were\n\naggravated by the concurrent evils of war and famine, and the common\n\npeople, fast bound in misery and iron, were powerless to make their\n\nsufferings known or to seek redress, except by the desperate methods of\n\nconspiracy and insurrection. None of the elements of revolution were\n\nwanting, and the fates seemed to be hurrying England to the brink of a\n\ncivil catastrophe.\n\n\"The general sense of insecurity and apprehension, inseparable from such\n\na condition of affairs, produced its effect upon even the robust minds.\n\nSir John Gladstone was not a likely victim of panic, but he was a man\n\nwith a large stake in the country, the more precious because acquired by\n\nhis own exertion; he believed that the safeguards of property and order\n\nwere imperilled by foreign arms and domestic sedition; and he had seen\n\nwith indignation and disgust the excesses of a factious Whiggery, which\n\nwas not ashamed to exult in the triumph of the French over the English\n\nGovernment. Under the pressure of these influences Sir John Gladstone\n\ngradually separated himself from the Whigs, with whom in earlier life he\n\nhad acted, and became the close ally of Canning, whose return for\n\nLiverpool he actually promoted.\"\n\nWith such surroundings it is not to be wondered at that William E.\n\nGladstone entered political life a Tory, contending against the\n\nprinciples he afterwards espoused. His original bent, however, was not\n\ntowards politics, but the church; and it was only at the earnest desire\n\nof his father that he ultimately decided to enter Parliament, and serve\n\nhis country in the Legislature.\n\nHis subsequent life proved the wisdom of the choice. In the Legislature\n\nof his country was begun, carried on and consummated grandly, one of the\n\nmost remarkable careers in the annals of history for versatility,\n\nbrilliancy, solidity and long continuance. Rarely has there been\n\nexhibited so complete a combination of qualities in statesmanship. His\n\nintellectual endowments were almost without a parallel, and his\n\nachievements without a precedent. In him seemed to be centered a rich\n\ncollection of the highest gifts of genius, great learning and readiness\n\nin debate and discourse in the House of Commons, and extraordinary\n\nwisdom in the administration of the affairs of the nation. His financial\n\ntalent, his business aptitude, his classical attainments, and above all\n\nhis moral fervor, and religious spirit were conspicuous. Some men would\n\nhave been contented with political power, or classical learning, or\n\nliterary distinction, but he excelled in all these--not only as a\n\nstatesman, but as a man of letters and a classical scholar. Neither has\n\nheld him exclusively as its own--he belongs to all, or rather they\n\nbelong to him--for he explored and conquered them. His literary\n\nproductions equal in merit his papers of State, while his knowledge of\n\nthe classics would do credit to any scholar.\n\nHe possessed the unusual quality of throwing the light of his own mind\n\non the greatest questions of national and international importance, of\n\nbringing them down to the understanding and appreciation of the masses\n\nof the people, of infusing, by his earnestness, the fire of his own soul\n\nin the people, and of arousing in them the greatest enthusiasm.\n\nIn the biography of this wonderful person we propose to set before the\n\nreader the man himself--his words and his deeds. This method enables him\n\nto speak for himself, and thus the reader may study him and know him,\n\nand because thereof be lifted into a higher plane of nobler and better\n\nbeing. The acts and utterances of such a character are his best\n\nbiography, and especially for one differing so largely from all other\n\nmen as to have none to be compared with him.\n\nIn this record we simply spread before the reader his private life and\n\npublic services, connected together through many startling changes, from\n\nhome to school, from university to Parliament, from Tory follower to\n\nLiberal leader, from the early start in his political course to the\n\ngrand consummation of the statesman's success in his attainment to the\n\nfourth Premiership of this Grand Old Man, and the glorious end of an\n\neventful life.\n\nWe could not do better, in closing this chapter, than to reproduce a\n\npart of the character sketch of William E. Gladstone, from the pen of\n\nWilliam T. Stead, and published in the \"Review of Reviews:\"\n\n\"So much has been written about Mr. Gladstone that it was with some\n\nsinking of heart I ventured to select him as a subject for my next\n\ncharacter sketch. But I took heart of grace when I remembered that the\n\nobject of these sketches is to describe their subject as he appears to\n\nhimself at his best, and his countrymen. There are plenty of other\n\npeople ready to fill in the shadows. This paper claims in no way to be a\n\ncritical estimate or a judicial summing up of the merits and demerits\n\nof the most remarkable of all living Englishmen. It is merely an attempt\n\nto catch, as it were, the outline of the heroic figure which has\n\ndominated English politics for the lifetime of this generation, and\n\nthereby to explain something of the fascination which his personality\n\nhas exercised and still exercises over the men and women of his time. If\n\nhis enemies, and they are many, say that I have idealized a wily old\n\nopportunist out of all recognition, I answer that to the majority of his\n\nfellow-subjects my portrait is not overdrawn. The real Gladstone may be\n\nother than this, but this is probably more like the Gladstone for whom\n\nthe electors believe they are voting, than a picture of Gladstone,\n\n'warts and all,' would be. And when I am abused, as I know I shall be,\n\nfor printing such a sketch, I shall reply that there is at least one\n\nthing to be said in its favor. To those who know him best, in his own\n\nhousehold, and to those who only know him as a great name in history, my\n\nsketch will only appear faulty because it does not do full justice to\n\nthe character and genius of this extraordinary man.\"\n\nMr. Gladstone appeals to the men of to-day from the vantage point of\n\nextreme old age. Age is so frequently dotage, that when a veteran\n\nappears who preserves the heart of a boy and the happy audacity of\n\nyouth, under the 'lyart haffets wearing thin and bare' of aged manhood,\n\nit seems as if there is something supernatural about it, and all men\n\nfeel the fascination and the charm. Mr. Gladstone, as he gleefully\n\nremarked the other day, has broken the record. He has outlived Lord\n\nPalmerston, who died when eighty-one, and Thiers, who only lived to be\n\neighty. The blind old Dandolo in Byron's familiar verse--\n\nThe octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe,\n\nhad not more energy than the Liberal leader, who, now in his\n\neighty-third year, has more nerve and spring and go than any of his\n\nlieutenants, not excluding the youngest recruit. There is something\n\nimposing and even sublime in the long procession of years which bridge\n\nas with eighty-two arches the abyss of past time, and carry us back to\n\nthe days of Canning, and of Castlereagh, of Napoleon, and of Wellington.\n\nHis parliamentary career extends over sixty years--the lifetime of two\n\ngenerations. He is the custodian of all the traditions, the hero of the\n\nexperience of successive administrations, from a time dating back longer\n\nthan most of his colleagues can remember. For nearly forty years he has\n\nhad a leading part in making or unmaking of Cabinets; he has served his\n\nQueen and his country in almost every capacity in office and in\n\nopposition, and yet to-day, despite his prolonged sojourn in the malaria\n\nof political wire-pulling, his heart seems to be as the heart of a\n\nlittle child. If some who remember 'the old Parliamentary hand' should\n\nwhisper that innocence of the dove is sometimes compatible with the\n\nwisdom of the serpent, I make no dissent. It is easy to be a dove, and\n\nto be as silly as a dove. It is easy to be as wise as a serpent, and as\n\nwicked, let us say, as Mr. Governor Hill or Lord Beaconsfield. But it is\n\nthe combination that is difficult, and in Mr. Gladstone the combination\n\nis almost ideally complete.\n\n\"Mr. Gladstone is old enough to be the grandfather of the younger race\n\nof politicians, but still his courage, his faith, his versatility, put\n\nthe youngest of them to shame. It is this ebullience of youthful energy,\n\nthis inexhaustible vitality, which is the admiration and despair of his\n\ncontemporaries. Surely when a schoolboy at Eton he must somewhere have\n\ndiscovered the elixir of life, or have been bathed by some beneficent\n\nfairy in the well of perpetual youth. Gladly would many a man of fifty\n\nexchange physique with this hale and hearty octogenarian. Only in one\n\nrespect does he show any trace of advancing years. His hearing is not\n\nquite so good as it was, but still it is far better than that of\n\nCardinal Manning, who became very deaf in his closing years. Otherwise\n\nMr. Gladstone is hale and hearty. His eye is not dim, neither is his\n\nnatural force abated. A splendid physical frame, carefully preserved,\n\ngives every promise of a continuance of his green old age.\n\n\"His political opponents, who began this Parliament by confidently\n\ncalculating upon his death before the dissolution, are now beginning to\n\nadmit that it is by no means improbable that Mr. Gladstone may survive\n\nthe century. Nor was it quite so fantastic as it appears at first sight,\n\nwhen an ingenious disciple told him the other day that by the fitness of\n\nthings he ought to live for twenty years yet. 'For,' said this political\n\narithmetician, 'you have been twenty-six years a Tory, twenty-six years\n\na Whig Liberal, and you have been only six years a Radical Home Ruler.\n\nTo make the balance even you have twenty years still to serve.'\n\n\"Sir Provo Wallis, the Admiral of the Fleet, who died the other day at\n\nthe age of one hundred, had not a better constitution than Mr.\n\nGladstone, nor had it been more carefully preserved in the rough and\n\ntumble of our naval war. If the man who smelt powder in the famous fight\n\nbetween the Chesapeake and the Shannon lived to read the reports of the\n\npreparations for the exhibition at Chicago, it is not so incredible that\n\nMr. Gladstone may at least be in the foretop of the State at the dawn of\n\nthe twentieth century.\n\n\"The thought is enough to turn the Tories green with sickening despair,\n\nthat the chances of his life, from a life insurance office point of\n\nview, are probably much better than Lord Salisbury's. But that is one of\n\nthe attributes of Mr. Gladstone which endear him so much to his party.\n\nHe is always making his enemies sick with despairing jealousy. He is the\n\ngreat political evergreen, who seems, even in his political life, to\n\nhave borrowed something of immortality from the fame which he has won.\n\nHe has long been the Grand Old Man. If he lives much longer he bids fair\n\nto be known as the immortal old man in more senses than one.\"\n\n[Illustration: GLADSTONE'S BIRTHPLACE, RODNEY STREET, LIVERPOOL.]\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAT ETON AND OXFORD\n\nThere is very little recorded of the boyhood of some great men, and this\n\nis true of the childhood of William E. Gladstone, until he leaves the\n\nparental home for school, which he does in 1821, at the early age of\n\neleven. He was fortunate in his parentage, but no less so in his early\n\nassociations, both in and out of school. We refer particularly to his\n\nprivate preceptors, two of whom, the venerable Archdeacon Jones and the\n\nRev. William Rawson, first Vicar of Seaforth, a watering-place near\n\nLiverpool, were both men of high character and great ability. Mr.\n\nGladstone always highly esteemed Mr. Rawson, his earliest preceptor, and\n\nvisited him on his death-bed. Dr. Turner, afterwards Bishop of Calcutta,\n\nwas for two years young Gladstone's private tutor, beginning his\n\ninstruction when his pupil left Eton in 1827.\n\nBesides these associations of his early life there were Canning, a\n\nfrequent visitor, as has been mentioned, at his father's house, and\n\nHannah More--\"Holy Hannah,\" as Horace Walpole called her. She singled\n\nout \"Billy\" Gladstone for her especial pet out of the group of eleven\n\nchildren in whom her warm heart delighted, and it has been asked\n\nwonderingly if Miss More could preternaturally have lengthened her days\n\nuntil William E. Gladstone's present glory, whether she would have gone\n\non dubbing him \"Billy\" in undignified brevity until the end.\n\nWilliam E. Gladstone, when very young, gave such evidence of uncommon\n\nintellectual ability and promise of future greatness that his father\n\nresolved upon educating him in the best schools of England. There are\n\nfour or five great schools in England in which the English youth are\n\nprepared in four or five years for Cambridge or Oxford. \"Eton, the\n\nlargest and the most celebrated of the public schools of England, ranks\n\nas the second in point of antiquity, Winchester alone being older.\"\n\nAfter the preparation at home, under private teachers, to which we have\n\nreferred, William E. Gladstone was sent to Eton, in September, 1821. His\n\nbiographer, George W.E. Russell, writes, \"From a provincial town, from\n\nmercantile surroundings, from an atmosphere of money-making, from a\n\nstrictly regulated life, the impressible boy was transplanted, at the\n\nage of eleven, to the shadow of Windsor and the banks of the Thames, to\n\nan institution which belongs to history, to scenes haunted by the\n\nmemory of the most illustrious Englishmen, to a free and independent\n\nexistence among companions who were the very flower of English boyhood.\n\nA transition so violent and yet so delightful was bound to produce an\n\nimpression which lapse of time was powerless to efface, and no one who\n\nknows the man and the school can wonder that for seventy years Mr.\n\nGladstone has been the most enthusiastic of Etonians.\"\n\nEton of to-day is not in all respects the Eton of three-quarters of a\n\ncentury ago, and yet in some particulars it is as it was when young\n\n\"Billy\" Gladstone studied within its walls. The system of education and\n\ndiscipline pursued has undergone some modifications in recent\n\nyears--notably during the provostship of the Rev. Francis Hodgson; but\n\nradical defects are still alleged against it. It is not remarkable,\n\nhowever, that every Eton boy becomes deeply attached to the school,\n\nnotwithstanding the apprenticeship to hardships he may have been\n\ncompelled to undergo.\n\nThe \"hardships\" there must have been particularly great when young\n\nGladstone entered Eton, at the close of the summer holidays of 1821. The\n\nschool was under the head-mastership of \"the terrific Dr. Keate.\" He was\n\nnot the man to spare even the scholar who, upon the emphatic testimony\n\nof Sir Roderick Murchison, was \"the prettiest boy that ever went to\n\nEton,\" and who was as studious and well-behaved as he was good-looking.\n\nThe town of Eton, in which the school is located, about 22 miles from\n\nLondon, in Berkshire, is beautifully situated on the banks of the river\n\nThames, opposite Windsor Castle, the residence of the Queen of England.\n\nEton College is one of the most famous and best endowed educational\n\ninstitutions of learning in England. It was founded in 1440 by Henry VI.\n\nThe king was very solicitous that the work should be of a durable kind,\n\nand he provided for free scholarships. Eton of Mr. Gladstone's day,\n\naccording to a critic, was divided into two schools--the upper and the\n\nlower. It also had two kinds of scholars, namely, seventy called king's\n\nscholars or \"collegers,\" who are maintained gratuitously, sleep in the\n\ncollege, and wear a peculiar dress; and another class--the\n\nmajority--called \"oppidans,\" who live in the town. Between these two\n\nclasses of students there prevails perpetual hostility. At Cambridge,\n\nthere was founded, in connection with Eton, what is called King's\n\nCollege, to receive as fellows students from Eton, and to give them\n\ngratuitously an education. The ground on which students of Eton were\n\npromoted to King's College and these fellowships was, strangely to say,\n\nupon that of seniority, or long residence, and not of merit. Because\n\nthere was no competition, scholars who were deficient in education at\n\nEton were promoted to Cambridge, where they had no incentive to work,\n\nbeing exempt from the ordinary university examination.\n\nAt Eton \"no instruction was given in any branch of mathematical,\n\nphysical, metaphysical or moral science, nor in the evidences of\n\nChristianity. The only subjects which it professed to impart a knowledge\n\nof were the Greek and Latin languages; as much divinity as can be gained\n\nfrom construing the Greek Testament, and reading a portion of Tomline on\n\nthe Thirty-nine Articles, and a little ancient and modern geography.\" So\n\nmuch for the instruction imparted. As regards the hours of tuition,\n\nthere seems to have been fault there, in that they were too few and\n\ninsufficient, there being in all only eleven hours a week study. Then as\n\nto the manner of study, no time was given the scholar to study the style\n\nof an author; he was \"hurried from Herodotus to Thucydides, from\n\nThucydides to Xenophon, from Xenophon to Lucian, without being\n\nhabituated to the style of any one author--without gaining an interest\n\nin the history, or even catching the thread of the narrative; and when\n\nthe whole book is finished he has probably collected only a few vague\n\nideas about Darius crying over a great army, Abydos and Nicias and\n\nDemosthenes being routed with a great army near Syracuse, mixed up with\n\na recollection of the death of Cyrus and Socrates, some moral precept\n\nfrom Socrates, and some jokes against false philosophers and heathen\n\ngods.\" Hence the Eton student who goes to Cambridge finds he has done\n\nbut a little desultory reading, and that he must begin again. It was\n\ncharged that the system of education at Eton failed in every point. The\n\nmoral discipline of the school was also called in question. The number\n\nof scholars was so great that the proper control of them seemed\n\nimpossible under the management. Great laxity prevailed among the larger\n\nboys, while the younger and weaker students were exposed to the tyranny\n\nof the older and stronger ones without hope of redress. The result was\n\nthat the system of \"fagging,\" or the acting of some boys as drudges for\n\nthe others, flourished. \"The right\" of fagging depended upon the place\n\nin the school; all boys in the sixth and fifth forms had the power of\n\nordering--all below the latter form being bound to obey. This system of\n\nfagging has a very injurious effect upon most of the boys; \"it finds\n\nthem slaves and leaves them despots. A boy who has suffered himself,\n\ninsensibly learns to see no harm in making others suffer in turn. The\n\nwhole thing is wrong in principle, and engenders passions which should\n\nbe stifled and not encouraged.\" Why free and enlightened England should\n\ntolerate, even then, such barbarous slavery cannot be understood and\n\nyet there are outrageous customs prevailing among college students of\n\nour day in every civilized land that should be suppressed.\n\nFlogging was in vogue, too, at Eton, with all its degrading and\n\ndemoralizing effects, and was performed by the Head-Master himself. In\n\n1820, the year before Mr. Gladstone entered Eton, there were 280 upper\n\nstudents and 319 lower, a total of 612, and none were exempt.\n\nSome curious stories are told of flogging, which has ever existed at\n\nEton, and from which even the largest boys were not exempt. Mr. Lewis\n\nrelates how a young man of twenty, just upon the point of leaving\n\nschool, and engaged to be married to a lady at Windsor, was well and\n\nsoundly whipped by Dr. Goodford, for arriving one evening at his tutor's\n\nhouse after the specified time. And it is related that Arthur Wellesley,\n\nafterwards the Iron Duke of Wellington, was flogged at Eton for having\n\nbeen \"barred out.\" At the same time there were eighty boys who\n\nwere whipped.\n\nAnd the Eton of twenty years later was very little improved over its\n\ncondition in Mr. Gladstone's time there, or in 1845. John D. Lewis,\n\nspeaking of this period, says that after the boys reached the fifth\n\nform, then began \"some of the greatest anomalies and absurdities of the\n\nthen Etonian system.\" The student was now safe from the ordeal of\n\nexaminations, and that the higher classes, including ten senior\n\ncollegers and ten senior oppidans, contained some of the very worst\n\nscholars. \"A boy's place on the general roll was no more a criterion of\n\nhis acquirements and his industry than would be the 'year' of a young\n\nman at Oxford or Cambridge.\" The collegers, however, were required to\n\npass some kind of examination, in accordance with which their place on\n\nthe list for the King's college was fixed. But the evils regarding the\n\nhours of study and the nature of the studies were as bad. \"The regular\n\nholidays and Saints' days, two whole holidays in a week, and two\n\nhalf-holidays, were a matter of common occurrence.\"\n\nLord Morley, in his examination before the Commission on Public Schools,\n\nwas asked whether a boy would be looked down upon at Eton for being\n\nindustrious in his studies, replied, \"Not if he could do something else\n\nwell.\" And this seems to be the spirit of the Eton boy with whom a lack\n\nof scholarship is more than made up by skill in river or field sports.\n\nThis is true to-day; for a recent writer in the _Forum_, upon \"The\n\nTraining of Boys at Eton,\" says: \"Athletic prominence is in English\n\npublic schools almost synonymous with social prominence; many a boy\n\nwhose capacity and character commanded both respect and liking at the\n\nuniversities and in after life, is almost a nobody at a public school,\n\nbecause he has no special athletic gifts.... Great athletic capacity may\n\nco-exist with low moral and intellectual character.\"\n\nThere were few inducements to study and to excel in scholarship, and\n\nplenty to idleness and neglect, hence he who did so must study in hours\n\nand out of hours, in season and out of season. The curriculum is still\n\nstrictly classical, but French, German and mathematics are taught. The\n\ncollegers of recent years have done very fair work and carried off many\n\ndistinctions at Cambridge. With all these odds against them, and these\n\ndifficulties to surmount, yet there were Eton boys whose attainments\n\nwere deep and solid, and who became famous men, and one of these was\n\nWilliam E. Gladstone.\n\nWhen young Gladstone entered Eton his brothers, Thomas and Robertson\n\nGladstone, were already there, and the three boys boarded at Mrs.\n\nShurey's, whose house \"at the south end of the broad walk in front of\n\nthe schools and facing the chapel,\" was rather nearer the famous\n\n\"Christopher Inn\" than would be thought desirable nowadays. On the wall\n\nopposite the house the name of \"Gladstone\" is carved. Thomas Gladstone\n\nwas in the fifth form, and William was placed in the middle remove of\n\nthe fourth form, and became his eldest brother's \"fag.\" This doubtlessly\n\nsaved him much annoyance and suffering, and allowed him better to\n\npursue the studious bent of his indications.\n\nWilliam E. Gladstone was what Etonians called a \"sap\"--in other words, a\n\nstudent faithful in the discharge of every duty devolving upon him at\n\nschool--one who studied his lessons and was prepared for his recitations\n\nin the classroom. This agreeable fact has been immortalized in a famous\n\nline in Lord Lytton's \"New Timon.\" He worked hard at his classical\n\nstudies, as required by the rules of the school, and applied himself\n\ndiligently to the study of mathematics during the holidays.\n\nIt is said that his interest in the work of the school was first aroused\n\nby Mr. Hawtrey, who afterwards became Head-Master, who commended some of\n\nhis Latin verses, and \"sent him up for good.\" This led the young man to\n\nassociate intellectual work with the ideas of ambition and success.\n\nWhile he did not seem to be especially an apt scholar in the restricted\n\nsense for original versification in the classical languages, or for\n\nturning English into Greek or Latin, yet he seemed to seize the precise\n\nmeaning of the authors and to give the sense. \"His composition was\n\nstiff,\" but yet, says a classmate, \"when there were thrilling passages\n\nof Virgil or Homer, or difficult passages in 'Scriptores Graeci' to\n\ntranslate, he or Lord Arthur Hervey was generally called up to edify\n\nthe class with quotations or translations.\"\n\nHe had no prizes at Eton except what is called being sent up for good,\n\non account of verses, and he was honored on several occasions. Besides\n\nhe took deep interest in starting a college periodical, and with some of\n\nthe most intellectual of the students sustained it with his pen. The\n\nmore studious of Eton boys have on several occasions in the present\n\ncentury been in the habit of establishing periodicals for the purpose of\n\nventilating their opinions. In 1786 Mr. Canning and Mr. Hookham Frere\n\nestablished the _Microcosm_, whose essays and _jeux d'esprit_, while\n\nhaving reference primarily to Eton, demonstrated that the writers were\n\nnot insensible to what was going on in the great world without. It was\n\nfor this college paper that Canning wrote his \"Essay on the Epic of the\n\nQueen of Hearts,\" which, as a burlesque criticism, has been awarded a\n\nhigh place in English literature. Lord Henry Spencer, Hookham Frere,\n\nCapel Lofft, and Mr. Millish, were also contributors to the columns of\n\nthe _Microcosm_. In the year 1820 W. Mackworth Praed set on foot a\n\nmanuscript journal, entitled _Apis Matina_. This was in turn succeeded\n\nby the _Etonian_, to which Praed contributed some of his most brilliant\n\nproductions. John Moultrie, Henry Nelson Coleridge, Walter Blunt, and\n\nChauncy Hare Townshend were also among the writers for its papers, who\n\nhelped to make it of exceptional excellence. Its articles are of no\n\nordinary interest even now.\n\nIn the last year of William E. Gladstone's stay at Eton, in 1827, and\n\nseven years after Praed's venture, he was largely instrumental in\n\nlaunching the _Eton Miscellany_, professedly edited by Bartholomew\n\nBouverie, and Mr. Gladstone became a most frequent, voluminous and\n\nvaluable contributor to its pages. He wrote articles of every\n\nkind--prologues, epilogues, leaders, historical essays, satirical\n\nsketches, classical translations, humorous productions, poetry and\n\nprose. And among the principal contributors with him were Sir Francis\n\nDoyle, George Selwyn, James Colville, Arthur Hallam, John Haumer and\n\nJames Milnes-Gaskell. The introduction, written by and signed \"William\n\nEwart Gladstone\" for this magazine, contained the following interesting\n\nand singular passage, which probably fairly sets forth the hopes and\n\nfears that beset statesmen in maturer years, as well as Eton boys of\n\nonly seventeen years of age:\n\n\"In my present undertaking there is one gulf in which I fear to sink,\n\nand that gulf is Lethe. There is one stream which I dread my inability\n\nto stem--it is the tide of Popular Opinion. I have ventured, and no\n\ndoubt rashly ventured--\n\nLike little wanton boys that swim on bladders,\n\nTo try my fortune in a sea of glory,\n\nBut far beyond my depth.\"\n\nAt present it is hope alone that buoys me up; for more substantial\n\nsupport I must be indebted to my own exertions, well knowing that in\n\nthis land of literature merit never wants its reward. That such merit is\n\nmine I dare not presume to think; but still there is something within me\n\nthat bids me hope that I may be able to glide prosperously down the\n\nstream of public estimation; or, in the words of Virgil,\n\n'--Celerare viam rumore secundo.'\n\n\"I was surprised even to see some works with the names of Shakespeare\n\nand Milton on them sharing the common destiny, but on examination I\n\nfound that those of the latter were some political rhapsodies, which\n\nrichly deserved their fate; and that the former consisted of some\n\neditions of his works which had been burdened with notes and mangled\n\nwith emendations by his merciless commentators. In other places I\n\nperceived authors worked up into frenzy by seeing their own compositions\n\ndescending like the rest. Often did the infuriated scribes extend their\n\nhands, and make a plunge to endeavor to save their beloved offspring,\n\nbut in vain; I pitied the anguish of their disappointment, but with\n\nfeelings of the same commiseration as that which one feels for a\n\nmalefactor on beholding his death, being at the same time fully\n\nconscious how well he has deserved it.\"\n\nLittle did this diffident and youthful editor imagine that he was\n\nforecasting the future for himself by the aid of youth's most ardent\n\ndesires, and that he would live to become the Primate of all England and\n\nthe foremost statesman of his day.\n\nThere were two volumes of the _Miscellany_, dated June-July and\n\nOctober-November, respectively, and Mr. Gladstone contributed thirteen\n\narticles to the first volume. Among the contributions were an \"Ode to\n\nthe Shade of Watt Tyler,\" a vigorous rendering of a chorus from the\n\nHucuba of Euripides, and a letter under the name of \"Philophantasm,\"\n\ndetailing an encounter he had with the poet Virgil, in which the great\n\npoet appeared muttering something which did not sound like Latin to an\n\nEton boy, and complaining that he knew he was hated by the Eton boys\n\nbecause he was difficult to learn, and pleading to be as well received\n\nhenceforth as Horace.\n\nWe give a quotation from a poem, consisting of some two hundred and\n\nfifty lines, from his pen, which, appeared also in the _Miscellany_:\n\n\"Who foremost now the deadly spear to dart,\n\nAnd strike the javelin to the Moslem's heart?\n\nWho foremost now to climb the leaguered wall,\n\nThe first to triumph, or the first to fall?\n\nLo, where the Moslems rushing to the fight,\n\nBack bear their squadrons in inglorious flight.\n\nWith plumed helmet, and with glittering lance,\n\n'Tis Richard bids his steel-clad bands advance;\n\n'Tis Richard stalks along the blood-dyed plain,\n\nAnd views unmoved the slaying and the slain;\n\n'Tis Richard bathes his hands in Moslem blood,\n\nAnd tinges Jordan with the purple flood.\n\nYet where the timbrels ring, the trumpets sound,\n\nAnd tramp of horsemen shakes the solid ground,\n\nThough 'mid the deadly charge and rush of fight,\n\nNo thought be theirs of terror or of flight,--\n\nOfttimes a sigh will rise, a tear will flow,\n\nAnd youthful bosoms melt in silent woe;\n\nFor who of iron frame and harder heart\n\nCan bid the mem'ry of his home depart?\n\nTread the dark desert and the thirsty sand,\n\nNor give one thought to England's smiling land?\n\nTo scenes of bliss, and days of other years--\n\nThe Vale of Gladness and the Vale of Tears;\n\nThat, passed and vanish'd from their loving sight,\n\nThis 'neath their view, and wrapt in shades of night?\"\n\nAmong other writers who contributed to the first volume of the\n\n_Miscellany_ were Arthur Henry Hallam and Doyle, also G.A. Selwyn,\n\nafterwards Bishop Selwyn, the friend of Mr. Gladstone, and to whom he\n\nrecently paid the following tribute: \"Connected as tutor with families\n\nof rank and influence, universally popular from his frank, manly, and\n\nengaging character--and scarcely less so from his extraordinary rigor as\n\nan athlete--he was attached to Eton, where he resided, with a love\n\nsurpassing the love of Etonians. In himself he formed a large part of\n\nthe life of Eton, and Eton formed a large part of his life. To him is\n\ndue no small share of the beneficial movement in the direction of\n\nreligious earnestness which marked the Eton of forty years back, and\n\nwhich was not, in my opinion, sensibly affected by any influence\n\nextraneous to the place itself. At a moment's notice, upon the call of\n\nduty, he tore up the singularly deep roots which his life had struck\n\ndeep into the soil of England.\"\n\nBoth Mr. Gladstone and the future Bishop of Selwyn contributed humorous\n\nletters to \"The Postman,\" the correspondence department of the _Eton\n\nMiscellany_.\n\nIn the second volume of the _Eton Miscellany_ are articles of equal\n\ninterest to those that appeared in the first. Doyle, Jelf, Selwyn,\n\nShadwell and Arthur Henry Hallam were contributors, the latter having\n\nwritten \"The Battle of the Boyne,\" a parody upon Campbell's\n\n\"Hohenlinden.\" But here again Mr. Gladstone was the principal\n\ncontributor, having contributed to this even more largely than to the\n\nfirst, having written seventeen articles, besides the introductions to\n\nthe various numbers of the volume. Indeed one would think from his\n\ndevotion to these literary pursuits during his last year at Eton, that\n\nhe had very little leisure for those ordinary sports so necessary to\n\nEton boys. He seems to have begun his great literary activity. Among\n\nthem may be mentioned an \"Ode to the Shade of Watt Tyler,\" mentioned\n\nbefore, which is an example of his humorous style:\n\n\"Shade of him whose valiant tongue\n\nOn high the song of freedom sung;\n\nShade of him, whose mighty soul\n\nWould pay no taxes on his poll;\n\nThough, swift as lightning, civic sword\n\nDescended on thy fated head,\n\nThe blood of England's boldest poured,\n\nAnd numbered Tyler with the dead!\n\n\"Still may thy spirit flap its wings\n\nAt midnight o'er the couch of kings;\n\nAnd peer and prelate tremble, too,\n\nIn dread of mighty interview!\n\nWith patriot gesture of command,\n\nWith eyes that like thy forges gleam,\n\nLest Tyler's voice and Tyler's hand\n\nBe heard and seen in nightly dream.\n\n\"I hymn the gallant and the good\n\nFrom Tyler down to Thistlewood,\n\nMy muse the trophies grateful sings,\n\nThe deeds of Miller and of Ings;\n\nShe sings of all who, soon or late,\n\nHave burst Subjection's iron chain,\n\nHave seal'd the bloody despot's fate,\n\nOr cleft a peer or priest in twain.\n\n\"Shades, that soft Sedition woo,\n\nAround the haunts of Peterloo!\n\nThat hover o'er the meeting-halls,\n\nWhere many a voice stentorian bawls!\n\nStill flit the sacred choir around,\n\nWith 'Freedom' let the garrets ring,\n\nAnd vengeance soon in thunder sound\n\nOn Church, and constable, and king.\"\n\nIn a paper on \"Eloquence,\" in the same volume, he shows that even then\n\nhis young mind was impressed by the fame attached to successful oratory\n\nin Parliament. Visions of glory and honor open before the enraptured\n\nsight of those devoted to oratorical pursuits, and whose ardent and\n\naspiring minds are directed to the House of Commons. Evidently the young\n\nwriter himself \"had visions of parliamentary oratory, and of a\n\nsuccessful _debut_ in the House of Commons, with perhaps an offer from\n\nthe Minister, a Secretaryship of State, and even the Premiership itself\n\nin the distance.\" But then there are barriers to pass and ordeals to\n\nundergo. \"There are roars of coughing, as well as roars of cheering\"\n\nfrom the members of the House, \"and maiden speeches sometimes act more\n\nforcibly on the lungs of hearers than the most violent or most cutting\n\nof all the breezes which AEOLUS can boast.\" But the writer draws comfort\n\nfrom the fact that Lord Morfeth, Edward Geoffrey, Stanley and Lord\n\nCastlereagh who were all members of the Eton college debating society\n\nwere then among the most successful young speakers in Parliament. This\n\nsounds more like prophecy than dreams, for within a very few years after\n\nwriting this article the writer himself had passed the dreaded barrier\n\nand endured the ordeal, and had not only made his appearance in the\n\nHouse of Commons, but had been invited to fill an honorable place in the\n\nCabinet of the Ministry then in power.\n\nAnother contribution of Mr. Gladstone's to the _Miscellany_, and perhaps\n\nthe most meritorious of the youthful writer's productions, was\n\nentitled, \"Ancient and Modern Genius Compared,\" in which the young\n\nEtonian editor ardently and affectionately apostrophized the memory of\n\nCanning, his father's great friend and his own ideal man and statesman,\n\nwho had just then perished untimely and amid universal regret. In this\n\narticle he first takes the part of the moderns as against the ancients,\n\nthough he by no means deprecates the genius of the latter, and then\n\neloquently apostrophizes the object of his youthful hero-worship, the\n\nimmortal Canning, whose death he compares to that of the lamented Pitt.\n\nThe following are extracts from this production:\n\n\"It is for those who revered him in the plenitude of his meridian glory\n\nto mourn over him in the darkness of his premature extinction: to mourn\n\nover the hopes that are buried in his grave, and the evils that arise\n\nfrom his withdrawing from the scene of life. Surely if eloquence never\n\nexcelled and seldom equalled--if an expanded mind and judgment whose\n\nvigor was paralleled only by its soundness--if brilliant wit--if a\n\nglowing imagination--if a warm heart, and an unbending firmness--could\n\nhave strengthened the frail tenure, and prolonged the momentary duration\n\nof human existence, that man had been immortal! But nature could endure\n\nno longer. Thus has Providence ordained that inasmuch as the intellect\n\nis more brilliant, it shall be more short-lived; as its sphere is more\n\nexpanded, more swiftly is it summoned away. Lest we should give to man\n\nthe honor due to God--lest we should exalt the object of our admiration\n\ninto a divinity for our worship--He who calls the weary and the mourner\n\nto eternal rest hath been pleased to remove him from our eyes.\n\n\"The degrees of inscrutable wisdom are unknown to us; but if ever there\n\nwas a man for whose sake it was meet to indulge the kindly though frail\n\nfeelings of our nature--for whom the tear of sorrow was to us both\n\nprompted by affection and dictated by duty--that man was\n\nGeorge Canning.\"\n\nAfter Hallam, Selwyn and other contributors to the _Miscellany_ left\n\nEton, at midsummer, 1827, Mr. Gladstone still remained and became the\n\nmainstay of the magazine. \"Mr. Gladstone and I remained behind as its\n\nmain supporters,\" writes Sir Francis Doyle, \"or rather it would be more\n\nlike the truth if I said that Mr. Gladstone supported the whole burden\n\nupon his own shoulders. I was unpunctual and unmethodical, so were his\n\nother vassals; and the '_Miscellany_' would have fallen to the ground\n\nbut for Mr. Gladstone's untiring energy, pertinacity and tact.\"\n\nAlthough Mr. Gladstone labored in editorial work upon the _Miscellany_,\n\nyet he took time to bestow attention upon his duties in the Eton\n\nSociety of the College, learnedly called \"The Literati,\" and vulgarly\n\ncalled \"Pop,\" and took a leading part in the debates and in the private\n\nbusiness of the Society. The Eton Society of Gladstone's day was a\n\nbrilliant group of boys. He introduced desirable new members, moved for\n\nmore readable and instructive newspapers, proposing new rules for better\n\norder and more decorous conduct, moving fines on those guilty of\n\ndisorder or breaches of the rules, and paying a fine imposed upon\n\nhimself for putting down an illegal question. \"In debate he champions\n\nthe claims of metaphysics against those of mathematics, and defends\n\naristocracy against democracy;\" confesses innate feelings of dislike to\n\nthe French; protests against disarmament of the Highlanders as\n\ninexpedient and unjust; deplores the fate of Strafford and the action of\n\nthe House of Commons, which he claimed they should be able to \"revere as\n\nour glory and confide in as our protection.\" The meetings of the Eton\n\nSociety were held over Miss Hatton's \"sock-shop.\"\n\nIn politics its members were Tory--intensely so, and although current\n\npolitics were forbidden subjects, yet, political opinions were disclosed\n\nin discussions of historical or academical questions. \"The execution of\n\nStrafford and Charles I, the characters of Oliver Cromwell and Milton,\n\nthe 'Central Social' of Rousseau, and the events of the French\n\nRevolution, laid bare the speakers' political tendencies as effectually\n\nas if the conduct of Queen Caroline, the foreign policy of Lord\n\nCastlereagh, or the repeal of the Test and Corporation Act had been the\n\nsubject of debate.\"\n\nIt was October 15, 1825, when Gladstone was elected a member of the Eton\n\nSociety, and on the 29th of the same month made his maiden speech on the\n\nquestion \"Is the education of the poor on the whole beneficial?\" It is\n\nrecorded in the minutes of the meeting that \"Mr. Gladstone rose and\n\neloquently addressed the house.\" He spoke in favor of education; and one\n\nwho heard him says that his opening words were, \"Sir, in this age of\n\nincreased and increasing civilization.\" Says an eminent writer, by way\n\nof comment upon these words, \"It almost oppresses the imagination to\n\npicture the shoreless sea of eloquence which rolls between that exordium\n\nand the oratory to which we still are listening and hope to listen for\n\nyears to come.\"\n\n\"The peroration of his speech on the question whether Queen Anne's\n\nMinisters, in the last four years of her reign, deserved well of their\n\ncountry, is so characteristic, both in substance and in form,\" that we\n\nreproduce it here from Dr, Russell's work on Gladstone:\n\n\"Thus much, sir, I have said, as conceiving myself bound in fairness not\n\nto regard the names under which men have hidden their designs so much\n\nas the designs themselves. I am well aware that my prejudices and my\n\npredilections have long been enlisted on the side of Toryism (cheers)\n\nand that in a cause like this I am not likely to be influenced unfairly\n\nagainst men bearing that name and professing to act on the principles\n\nwhich I have always been accustomed to revere. But the good of my\n\ncountry must stand on a higher ground than distinctions like these. In\n\ncommon fairness and in common candor, I feel myself compelled to give my\n\ndecisive verdict against the conduct of men whose measures I firmly\n\nbelieve to have been hostile to British interests, destructive of\n\nBritish glory, and subversive of the splendid and, I trust, lasting\n\nfabric of the British constitution.\"\n\nThe following extracts from the diary of William Cowper, afterwards Lord\n\nMount-Temple, we also reproduce from the same author: \"On Saturday,\n\nOctober 27, 1827, the subject for debate was:\n\n\"'Whether the deposition of Richard II was justifiable or not.' Jelf\n\nopened; not a good speech. Doyle spoke _extempore_, made several\n\nmistakes, which were corrected by Jelf. Gladstone spoke well. The Whigs\n\nwere regularly floored; only four Whigs to eleven Tories, but they very\n\nnearly kept up with them in coughing and 'hear, hears,' Adjourned to\n\nMonday after 4.\n\n\"Monday, 29.--Gladstone finished his speech, and ended with a great deal\n\nof flattery of Doyle, saying that he was sure he would have courage\n\nenough to own that he was wrong. It succeeded. Doyle rose amidst\n\nreiterated cheers to own that he was convinced by the arguments of the\n\nother side. He had determined before to answer them and cut up\n\nGladstone!\n\n\"December 1.--Debate, 'Whether the Peerage Bill of 1719 was calculated\n\nto be beneficial or not.' Thanks voted to Doyle and Gladstone; the\n\nlatter spoke well; will be a great loss to the Society.\"\n\nThere were many boys at Eton--schoolfellows of Mr. Gladstone--who became\n\nmen of note in after days. Among them the Hallams, Charles Canning,\n\nafterwards Lord Canning and Governor-General of India; Walter Hamilton,\n\nBishop of Salisbury; Edward Hamilton, his brother, of Charters; James\n\nHope, afterwards Hope-Scott; James Bruce, afterwards Lord Elgin; James\n\nMilnes-Gaskell, M.P. for Wenlock; Henry Denison; Sir Francis Doyle;\n\nAlexander Kinglake; George Selwyn, Bishop of New Zealand and of\n\nLitchfield; Lord Arthur Hervey, Bishop of Bath and Wells; William\n\nCavendish, Duke of Devonshire; George Cornwallis Lewis; Frederic\n\nTennyson; Gerald Wellesley, Dean of Windsor; Spencer Walpole, Home\n\nSecretary; Frederic Rogers, Lord Blachford; James Colvile, Chief Justice\n\nat Calcutta, and others.\n\nBy universal acknowledgment the most remarkable youth at Eton in that\n\nday was Arthur Hallam, \"in mind and character not unworthy of the\n\nmagnificent eulogy of 'In Memoriam.'\" He was the most intimate friend of\n\nyoung Gladstone. They always took breakfast together, although they\n\nboarded apart in different houses, and during the separation of\n\nvacations they were diligent correspondents.\n\nThe father of William E. Gladstone, as we have seen, discovered\n\npremonitions of future greatness in his son, and we may well ask the\n\nquestion what impression was made by him upon his fellow school-mates at\n\nEton. Arthur Hallam wrote: \"Whatever may be our lot, I am confident that\n\n_he_ is a bud that will bloom with a richer fragrance than almost any\n\nwhose early promise I have witnessed.\"\n\nJames Milnes-Gaskell says: \"Gladstone is no ordinary individual; and\n\nperhaps if I were called on to select the individual I am intimate with\n\nto whom I should first turn in an emergency, and whom I thought in every\n\nway pre-eminently distinguished for high excellence, I think I should\n\nturn to Gladstone. If you finally decide in favor of Cambridge, my\n\nseparation from Gladstone will be a source of great sorrow to me.\" And\n\nthe explanation of this latter remark is that the writer's mother wanted\n\nhim to go to Cambridge, while he wished to go to Oxford, because\n\nGladstone was going there.\n\nSir Francis Doyle writes: \"I may as well remark that my father, a man of\n\ngreat ability, as well as of great experience of life, predicted\n\nGladstone's future eminence from the manner in which he handled this\n\nsomewhat tiresome business. [The editorial work and management of the\n\n_Eton Miscellany._] 'It is not' he remarked, 'that I think his papers\n\nbetter than yours or Hallam's--that is not my meaning at all; but the\n\nforce of character he has shown in managing his subordinates, and the\n\ncombination of ability and power that he has made evident, convince me\n\nthat such a young man cannot fail to distinguish himself hereafter.'\"\n\nThe recreations of young Gladstone were not in all respects like his\n\nschool-mates. He took no part in games, for he had no taste in that\n\ndirection, and while his companions were at play he was studiously\n\nemployed in his room. One of the boys afterwards declared, \"without\n\nchallenge or contradiction, that he was never seen to run.\" Yet he had\n\nhis diversions and was fond of sculling, and kept a \"lock-up,\" or\n\nprivate boat, for his own use. He liked walking for exercise, and walked\n\nfast and far. His chief amusement when not writing, reading or debating,\n\nwas to ramble among the delights of Windsor with a few intimate friends;\n\nand he had only a few whom he admitted to his inner circle. To others\n\nbeyond he was not known and was not generally popular. Gladstone,\n\nCharles Canning, Handley, Bruce, Hodgson, Lord Bruce and Milnes-Gaskell\n\nset up a Salt Hill Club. They met every whole holiday or half-holiday,\n\nas was convenient, after twelve, \"and went up to Salt Hill to bully the\n\nfat waiter, eat toasted cheese, and drink egg-wine.\" It is startling to\n\nhear from such an authority as James Milnes-Gaskell that \"in all our\n\nmeetings, as well as at almost every time, Gladstone went by the name of\n\nMr. Tipple.\"\n\n[Illustration: HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.]\n\nThe strongest testimony is borne to the moral character of young\n\nGladstone while at Eton. By common consent he was pre-eminently\n\nGod-fearing, orderly and conscientious. Bishop Hamilton, of Salisbury,\n\nwrites: \"At Eton I was a thoroughly idle boy; but I was saved from some\n\nworse things by getting to know Gladstone.\" This is the strong testimony\n\nof one school-boy after he has reached maturity and distinction for\n\nanother. \"To have exercised, while still a school-boy, an influence for\n\ngood upon one of the greatest of contemporary saints, is surely such a\n\ndistinction as few Prime Ministers ever attain.\"\n\nTwo stories are told of him while at Eton that go to show the moral\n\ndetermination of the boy to do right. On one occasion he turned his\n\nglass upside down and refused to drink a coarse toast proposed,\n\naccording to annual custom, at an election dinner at the \"Christopher\n\nInn.\" This shows the purity of his mind, but there is another\n\nillustrating the humane feeling in his heart. He came forth as the\n\nchampion of some miserable pigs which it was the inhumane custom to\n\ntorture at Eton Fair on Ash Wednesday, and when he was bantered by his\n\nschool-fellows for his humanity, he offered to write his reply \"in good\n\nround hand upon their faces.\"\n\nAt Christmas, 1827, Gladstone left Eton, and after that studied six\n\nmonths under private tutors, Dr. Turner, afterwards Bishop of Calcutta,\n\nbeing one. Of this Mr. Gladstone writes: \"I resided with Dr. Turner at\n\nWilmslow (in Cheshire) from January till a few months later. My\n\nresidence with him was cut off by his appointment to the Bishopric of\n\nCalcutta.... My companions were the present (1877) Bishop of Sodor and\n\nMan, and Sir C.A. Wood, Deputy-Chairman of the G.W. Railway. We employed\n\nour spare time in gymnastics, in turning, and in rambles. I remember\n\npaying a visit to Macclesfield. In a silk factory the owner showed us\n\nhis silk handkerchiefs, and complained much of Mr. Huskisson for having\n\nremoved the prohibition of the foreign article. The thought passed\n\nthrough my mind at the time: Why make laws to enable people to produce\n\narticles of such hideous pattern and indifferent quality as this?\n\nAlderly Edge was a favorite place of resort. We dined with Sir John\n\nStanley (at Alderly) on the day when the king's speech was received; and\n\nI recollect that he ridiculed (I think very justly) the epithet\n\n_untoward_, which was applied in it to the Battle of Navarino.\"\n\nIn 1828, and after two years as a private pupil of Dr. Turner, Mr.\n\nGladstone entered Christ Church College, Oxford and in the following\n\nyear was nominated to a studentship on the foundation. Although he had\n\nno prizes at Oxford of the highest class, unless honors in the schools\n\nbe so called--and in this respect he achieved a success which falls to\n\nthe lot of but few students. In the year 1831, when he went up for his\n\nfinal examination, he completed his academical education by attaining\n\nthe highest honors in the university--graduating double-first-class.\n\nOf the city of Oxford, where Oxford University is situated, Matthew\n\nArnold writes: \"Beautiful city! So venerable, so lovely, so unravaged by\n\nthe fierce intellectual life of our century, so serene! And yet, steeped\n\nin sentiment as she lies, spreading her gardens to the moonlight, or\n\nwhispering from her towers the last enchantments of the Middle Age, who\n\nwill deny that Oxford, by her ineffable charm, keeps ever calling us\n\nnear to the true goal of all of us, to the ideal, to perfection--to\n\nbeauty, in a word, which is only truth seen from another side.\"\n\nDescribing Christ Church College, a writer has said that there is no\n\nother College where a man has so great a choice of society, or a man\n\nentire freedom in choosing it.\n\nAs to the studies required, a greater stress was laid upon a knowledge\n\nof the Bible and of the evidences of Christianity than upon classical\n\nliterature; some proficiency was required also, either in mathematics or\n\nthe science of reasoning. The system of education accommodated itself to\n\nthe capacity and wants of the students, but the man of talent was at no\n\nloss as to a field for his exertions, or a reward for his industry. The\n\nhonors of the ministry were all within his reach. In the cultivation of\n\ntaste and general information Oxford afforded every opportunity, but the\n\nmodern languages were not taught.\n\nAn interesting fact is related of young Gladstone when he entered\n\nOxford, as to his studies at the university. He wrote his father that he\n\ndisliked mathematics, and that he intended to concentrate his time and\n\nattention upon the classics. This was a great blow to his father, who\n\nreplied that he did not think a man was a man unless he knew\n\nmathematics. The dutiful son yielded to his father's wishes, abandoned\n\nhis own plan, and applied himself with energy and success to the study\n\nof mathematics. But for this change of study he might not have become\n\nthe greatest of Chancellors of the Exchequer.\n\nGladstone's instructors at Oxford were men of reputation. Rev. Robert\n\nBiscoe, whose lectures on Aristotle attracted some of the best men to\n\nthe university, was his tutor; he attended the lectures of Dr. Burton on\n\nDivinity, and of Dr. Pusey on Hebrew, and read classics privately with\n\nBishop Wordsworth. He read steadily but not laboriously. Nothing was\n\never allowed to interfere with his morning's work. He read for four\n\nhours, and then took a walk. Though not averse to company and suppers,\n\nyet he always read for two or three hours before bedtime.\n\nAmong the undergraduates at Oxford then, who became conspicuous, were\n\nHenry Edward Manning, afterwards Cardinal Archbishop; Archibald Campbell\n\nTait, Archbishop of Canterbury; Sidney Herbert, Robert Lowe, Lord\n\nSherbrooke, and Lord Selborne. \"The man who _took_ me most,\" says a\n\nvisitor to Oxford in 1829, \"was the youngest Gladstone of Liverpool--I\n\nam sure a very superior person.\"\n\nGladstone's chosen friends were all steady and industrious men, and many\n\nof them were more distinctively religious than is generally found in the\n\nlife of undergraduates. And his choice of associates in this respect was\n\nthe subject of criticism on the part of a more secularly minded student\n\nwho wrote, \"Gladstone has mixed himself up with the St. Mary Hall and\n\nOriel set, who are really, for the most part, only fit to live with\n\nmaiden aunts and keep tame rabbits.\" And the question, Which was\n\nright--Gladstone or the student? may be answered by another, Which one\n\nbecame Prime Minister of England?\n\n\"Gladstone's first rooms were in the 'old library,' near the hall; but\n\nfor the greater part of his time he occupied the right-hand rooms on the\n\nfirst floor of the first staircase, on the right as the visitor enters\n\nCanterbury gate. He was, alike in study and in conduct, a model\n\nundergraduate, and the great influence of his character and talents was\n\nused with manly resolution against the riotous conduct of the 'Tufts,'\n\nwhose brutality caused the death of one of their number in 1831. We read\n\nthis note in the correspondence of a friend: 'I heard from Gladstone\n\nyesterday; he says that the number of gentlemen commoners has increased,\n\nis increasing, and ought to be diminished.' Every one who has\n\nexperienced the hubristic qualities of the Tufted race, and its\n\nsatellites, will cordially sympathize with this sentiment of an orderly\n\nand industrious undergraduate. He was conspicuously moderate in the use\n\nof wine. His good example in this respect affected not only his\n\ncontemporaries but also his successors at the university; men who\n\nfollowed him to Oxford ten years later found it still operative, and\n\ndeclare that undergraduates drank less in the forties, because Gladstone\n\nhad been courageously abstemious in the thirties.\"\n\nBut there were those who better estimated Gladstone's worth and looked\n\napprovingly upon his course, as \"the blameless schoolboy became the\n\nblameless undergraduate; diligent, sober, regular alike in study and\n\ndevotion, giving his whole energies to the duties of the place, and\n\nquietly abiding in the religious faith in which he had been trained.\n\nBishop Charles Wordsworth said that no man of his standing in the\n\nuniversity habitually read his Bible more or knew it better. Cardinal\n\nManning described him walking in the university with his 'Bible and\n\nPrayer-book tucked under his arm.' ... He quitted Oxford with a\n\nreligious belief still untinctured by Catholic theology. But the great\n\nchange was not far distant, and he had already formed some of the\n\nfriendships which, in their development were destined to effect so\n\nprofoundly the course of his religious thought.\"\n\nIn reference to the religious and political opinions and influences\n\nprevailing at Oxford, it may be remarked that the atmosphere of Oxford\n\nwas calculated to strengthen Mr. Gladstone's conservative views, and did\n\nhave this effect, and as English statesmen had not then learned to put\n\ntheir trust in the people, the cause of reform found few or no friends\n\nat the university, and he was among those hostile to it, and was known\n\nfor his pronounced Tory and High Church opinions.\n\nHe belonged to the famous debating society known as the Oxford Union,\n\nwas a brilliant debater, and in 1831 was its secretary, and later its\n\npresident. On various occasions he carried, by a majority of one only, a\n\nmotion that the Wellington Administration was undeserving of the\n\nconfidence of the country; he defended the results of the Catholic\n\nEmancipation; he opposed a motion for the removal of Jewish\n\ndisabilities, and he persuaded 94 students out of 130 to condemn Earl\n\nGrey's Reform Bill as a measure \"which threatened not only to change the\n\nform of government, but ultimately to break up the very foundation of\n\nsocial order.\" His last speech at Oxford was in support of his own\n\namendment to a motion for the immediate emancipation of the slaves in\n\nthe West Indies. On a certain occasion he entertained a party of\n\nstudents from Cambridge, consisting of Sir Francis Doyle, Monckton\n\nMilnes, Sunderland, and Arthur H. Hallam, who discussed among them the\n\nsuperiority of Shelley over Byron as a poet. The motion was opposed by\n\none Oxonion, the late Cardinal Manning, but Shelley received 90 votes to\n\n33 for Byron.\n\nOne who heard the debate on the Reform Bill says that \"it converted\n\nAlston, the son of the member in Parliament for Hertford, who\n\nimmediately on the conclusion of Gladstone's speech walked across from\n\nthe Whig to the Tory side of the house, amidst loud acclamations.\"\n\nAnother who was present writes, \"Most of the speakers rose, more or\n\nless, above their usual level, but when Mr. Gladstone sat down we all of\n\nus felt that an epoch in our lives had occurred. It certainly was the\n\nfinest speech of his that I ever heard.\" And Bishop Charles Wordsworth\n\nwrites his experience of Mr. Gladstone at this time, \"made me feel no\n\nless sure than of my own existence that Gladstone, our then\n\nChrist-Church undergraduate, would one day rise to be Prime Minister\n\nof England.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1832 Mr. Gladstone quitted Oxford. In summing up\n\nresults it may be said, in the language of Mr. Russell: \"Among the\n\npurely intellectual effects produced on Mr. Gladstone by the discipline\n\nof Oxford, it is obvious to reckon an almost excessive exactness in the\n\nstatement of propositions, a habit of rigorous definition, a microscopic\n\ncare in the choice of words, and a tendency to analyze every sentiment\n\nand every phrase, and to distinguish with intense precaution between\n\nstatements almost exactly similar. From Aristotle and Bishop Butler and\n\nEdmund Burke he learned the value of authority, the sacredness of law,\n\nthe danger of laying rash and inconsiderate hands upon the ark of State.\n\nIn the political atmosphere of Oxford he was taught to apply these\n\nprinciples to the civil events of his time, to dread innovation, to\n\nrespect existing institutions, and to regard the Church and the Throne\n\nas inseparably associated by Divine ordinance.\"\n\n[Illustration: Gladstone's London Home]\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nEARLY PARLIAMENTARY EXPERIENCES\n\nIt is customary for the sons of gentlemen who graduate at Cambridge and\n\nOxford to spend some time in travel on the continent upon the completion\n\nof their university studies. The custom was observed in Mr. Gladstone's\n\nearly days even more than at the present. In accordance then with the\n\nprevailing usage he went abroad after graduating at Oxford. In the\n\nspring of 1832 he started on his travels and spent nearly the whole of\n\nthe next six months in Italy, \"learning the language, studying the art,\n\nand revelling in the natural beauties of that glorious land.\" In the\n\nfollowing September, however, he was suddenly recalled to England to\n\nenter upon his first Parliamentary campaign.\n\nAt Oxford Toryism prevailed, and was of the old-fashioned type, far\n\nremoved from the utilitarian conservatism of the present day. Charles I\n\nwas a saint and a martyr, the claims of rank and birth were admitted\n\nwith a childlike simplicity, the high functions of government were the\n\nbirthright of the few, and the people had nothing to do with the laws,\n\nexcept to obey them. Mr. Gladstone was a Tory. The political views he\n\nheld upon leaving Oxford had much to do with his recall from abroad and\n\nhis running for a seat in the House of Commons. Of these opinions held\n\nby him then, and afterwards repudiated, he, in a speech delivered at the\n\nopening of the Palmerston Club, Oxford, in December, 1878, says: \"I\n\ntrace in the education of Oxford of my own time one great defect.\n\nPerhaps it was my own fault; but I must admit that I did not learn, when\n\nat Oxford, that which I have learned since, viz., to set a due value on\n\nthe imperishable and inestimable principles of human liberty. The temper\n\nwhich, I think, too much prevailed in academic circles, was that liberty\n\nwas regarded with jealousy and fear, which could not be wholly dispensed\n\nwith, but which was continually to be watched for fear of excess.... I\n\nthink that the principle of the Conservative party is jealousy of\n\nliberty and of the people, only qualified by fear; but I think the\n\npolicy of the Liberal party is trust in the people, only qualified by\n\nprudence. I can only assure you, gentlemen, that now I am in front of\n\nextended popular privileges. I have no fear of those enlargements of the\n\nConstitution that seem to be approaching. On the contrary, I hail them\n\nwith desire. I am not in the least degree conscious that I have less\n\nreverence for antiquity, for the beautiful, and good, and glorious\n\ncharges that our ancestors have handed down to us as a patrimony to our\n\nrace, than I had in other days when I held other political opinions. I\n\nhave learnt to set the true value upon human liberty, and in whatever I\n\nhave changed, there, and there only, has been the explanation of\n\nthe change.\"\n\nIt was Mr. Gladstone's Tory principles that led to an invitation from\n\nthe Duke of Newcastle, whose son, the Earl of Lincoln, afterwards a\n\nmember of Lord Aberdeen's Cabinet during the Crimean War, had been his\n\nschoolmate at Eton and Oxford, and his intimate friend; to return to\n\nEngland and to contest the representation of Newark in Parliament. In\n\naccordance with this summons he hurried home.\n\nLet us review the national situation. It was a time of general alarm and\n\nuncertainty, from political unrest, commercial stagnation, and\n\ndevastating pestilence. \"The terrors of the time begat a hundred forms\n\nof strange fanaticism; and among men who were not fanatics there was a\n\ndeep and wide conviction that national judgments were overtaking\n\nnational sins, and that the only hope of safety for England lay in a\n\nreturn to that practical recognition of religion in the political sphere\n\nat the proudest moments of English history. 'The beginning and the end\n\nof what is the matter with us in these days,' wrote Carlyle, 'is that we\n\nhave forgotten God.'\"\n\nEngland was in a condition of great political excitement and expectancy.\n\nOne of the greatest battles in Parliamentary history had just been\n\nfought and won by the people. The Reform Bill, which admitted large\n\nclasses, hitherto unrepresented, to the right of citizenship, had\n\npassed, after a long struggle, during which law and order were defied\n\nand riots prevailed in various parts of the kingdom.\n\nThe King clearly perceiving that the wish of the people could no longer\n\nbe disregarded with safety, and heedless of the advice of the\n\naristocracy, gave his assent to the measure. This bill, which became a\n\nlaw June 7, 1832, \"transformed the whole of the Electoral arrangements\n\nof the United Kingdom.\" It was demanded that the King be present in the\n\nHouse of Lords to witness the ceremony of the subjugation of his crown\n\nand peers, as it was deemed, but the King, feeling he had yielded enough\n\nto the popular will, refused. Walpole, in his history, writes: \"King and\n\nQueen sat sullenly apart in their palace. Peer and country gentleman\n\nmoodily awaited the ruin of their country and the destruction of their\n\nproperty. Fanaticism still raved at the wickedness of a people; the\n\npeople, clamoring for work, still succumbed before the mysterious\n\ndisease which was continually claiming more and more victims. But the\n\nnation cared not for the sullenness of the Court, the forebodings of the\n\nlanded classes, the ravings of the pulpit, or even the mysterious\n\noperations of a new plague. The deep gloom that had overshadowed the\n\nland had been relieved by one single ray. The victory had been won. The\n\nbill had become law.\"\n\nThe first reformed House of Commons, after the passage of the terrible\n\nReform Bill, met and was looked upon by some of the friends of Reform\n\nwith fond hopes and expectations, and by others, the Tories, with fear\n\nand apprehension. The poor looked upon the Reform Bill as a measure for\n\ntheir redemption, and the landed proprietors regarded it as the first\n\nsign of departed national greatness. Both classes were disappointed. It\n\nneither revived business nor despoiled owners. The result was a surprise\n\nto politicians of both parties. The Reformers did not, as was\n\nanticipated, carry their extreme measures, and the Tories did not\n\nrealize the great losses they expected. While the Ministry preserved its\n\npower and even obtained some victories in England and Scotland, it\n\nsustained serious defeats in Ireland. In England many earnest and\n\npopular friends of Reform were defeated in the election, and some\n\ncounties, among them Bristol, Stamford, Hertford, Norwich and Newark,\n\nwere pronounced against the Ministry.\n\nThe Duke of Newcastle, who was one of the chief potentates of the high\n\nTory party, and had lost his control of Newark in 1831, by the election\n\nof a Radical, was determined to regain it. He regarded it as his right\n\nto be represented in the House of Commons, or that Newark should elect\n\nwhom he nominated. And he had propounded the memorable political maxim,\n\n\"Have I not a right to do what I like with my own?\" The Duke wanted a\n\ncapable candidate to help him regain his ascendency. His son, Lord\n\nLincoln, here came to his aid. He had heard the remarkable speech of his\n\nfriend, Mr. Gladstone, in the Oxford Union, against the Reform Bill, and\n\nhad written home regarding him, that \"a man had uprisen in Israel.\" At\n\nhis suggestion the Duke invited the young graduate of Oxford to run as\n\nthe Tory candidate for a seat in Parliament from Newark. The wisdom of\n\nthis selection for the accomplishment of the purpose in view, was fully\n\ndemonstrated.\n\n[Illustration: The Lobby of the House of Commons]\n\nHis personal appearance at this time may be thus described: He was\n\nsomewhat robust. His youthful face bore none of those deep furrows which\n\nhave rendered his countenance so remarkable in maturer years. But there\n\nwas the same broad intellectual forehead, the massive nose, the same\n\nanxious eyes and the earnest enthusiasm of later years. His look was\n\nbright and thoughtful and his bearing attractive. He was handsome and\n\npossessed a most intelligent and expressive countenance. Says his\n\nbiographer, Mr. Russell: \"William Ewart Gladstone was now twenty-two\n\nyears old, with a physical constitution of unequalled vigor, the\n\nprospect of ample fortune, great and varied knowledge, and a natural\n\ntendency to political theorization, and an inexhaustible copiousness and\n\nreadiness of speech. In person he was striking and attractive, with\n\nstrongly marked features, a pale complexion, abundance of dark hair and\n\neyes of piercing lustre. People who judged only by his external aspect\n\nconsidered that he was delicate.\"\n\nYoung Gladstone found two opponents contesting with him to represent\n\nNewark in Parliament, W.F. Handley and Sergeant Wilde, afterwards Lord\n\nChancellor Truro. The latter was an advanced Liberal and had\n\nunsuccessfully contested the borough in 1829 and 1830, and had in\n\nconsideration of his defeat received from his sympathetic friends a\n\npiece of plate inscribed: \"By his ardent friends, the Blue electors of\n\nthe borough, who by their exertions and sufferings in the cause of\n\nindependence, largely conduced to awaken the attention of the nation to\n\nthe necessity of Reform in Parliament. Upon this humble token of respect\n\n(contributed in the hour of defeat) the Blue electors of Newark inscribe\n\ntheir sense of the splendid ability, unwearied perseverance, and\n\ndisinterested public spirit displayed by Sergeant Wilde in maintaining\n\nthe two contests of 1829 and 1830, in order to emancipate the borough\n\nfrom political thraldoms, and restore to its inhabitants the free\n\nexercise of their long-lost rights.\" But Sergeant Wilde was more\n\nsuccessful the following year, 1831, when the \"Reform fever\" was at its\n\nheight, and defeated the Duke of Newcastle's nominee and became member\n\nof the House of Commons for the borough. These facts made the coming\n\nelection, which followed the passage of the Reform Bill, of unusual\n\ninterest, to those concerned, and the struggle would be of a close and\n\ndetermined character.\n\nMr. Gladstone entered upon the contest with his experienced, able and\n\npopular antagonist, with much against him, for he was young, unknown and\n\nuntried; but his youth and personal appearance and manly bearing were in\n\nhis favor, and these, with his eloquence and ready wit, gained for him\n\nmany friends. His speeches demonstrated that he lacked neither\n\narguments, nor words wherewith to clothe them. He needed, however, to\n\ncall into requisition all his abilities, for Sergeant Wilde was a\n\npowerful antagonist, and had no thought of being displaced"
