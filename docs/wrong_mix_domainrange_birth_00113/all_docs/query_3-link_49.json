        "text": "Brock was born in Worcester, before moving to London in 1866 and working in John Henry Foley’s studio. He attended the Royal Academy Schools and inherited Foley’s unfinished commissions on his death in 1874.\n\nAt the same time, his friendship with the influential artist and President of the Royal Academy (from 1878), Frederic, Lord Leighton (1830-96) encouraged his involvement in the ‘New Sculpture’ movement, which included contemporaries such as Alfred Gilbert. This movement brought a fresh approach to sculptural naturalism, realism and close attention to surface detail, evident in the vitality of Brock’s works in Westminster Abbey. Brock was elected a Royal Academician in 1891 and was a founder member and first President of the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1905.\n\nBrock’s commemorative statues and busts demonstrate his skill as a portraitist. Consistent with the principles of the ‘New Sculpture’ movement, he paid attention to surface detail and was concerned with the finish and overall harmony of the work. He disliked collaborating with architects as he preferred to take complete responsibility for a monument. That way he could determine the exact positioning of each statue, its overall appearance from all angles and the height of the pedestal.\n\nSir Thomas Brock is perhaps best known for important works of public sculptureaway from the Abbey. These include the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace on the Mall.\n\nThis is the largest commemorative monument in the British Isles, which inspired King George V to knight the sculptor on the spot on its unveiling in 1911.\n\nThe Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 and the recent Platinum Jubilee events showed that this circular 24 foot-high monument to the seated Victoria still provides a popular public gathering place.\n\nThe Dean and Chapter of Westminster gave permission for the English admirers of American poet Henry Longfellow to install a marble bust in Poets’ Corner between the memorials to Geoffrey Chaucer and John Dryden.\n\nThe Chapter Book for 21 December 1882 notes:\n\n‘Ordered that the Fine required for placing a Monument in the Abbey to “Longfellow” be £200’.\n\nSir Thomas Brock was selected to carve the bust out of a ballot of sixteen sculptors. It was displayed in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1884 and then installed in Westminster Abbey. Brock shows the magnificently-bearded poet wearing the robes of a professor of Harvard University and demonstrates his gift for realistic and sympathetic portraiture with his depiction of the poet’s thoughtful eyes and wrinkled forehead.\n\nThe Subdean of Westminster unveiled the bust on 1 March 1884 in the presence of the Foreign Secretary, Earl Granville and the American Minister, James Russell Lowell, who was also a poet. The secretary of the memorial committee, Dr. W. Bennett, praised the work for its portrayal of the subject’s intellectual power and kindly nature and Longfellow’s daughters, who attended the unveiling, thanked Brock for ‘giving to the world such a perfect and beautiful likeness’.\n\nFind out more about Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\n\nParliament sometimes memorialised deceased Prime Ministers in Westminster Abbey, usually in the north transept, known as Statesmen’s Aisle. The day after Gladstone’s death on 20 May 1898, the House of Commons voted to erect a monument in the Abbey and later awarded the commission to Brock. The sculptor was also commissioned by The National Memorial Fund to execute a monument to Gladstone in his birthplace, Liverpool.\n\nBrock had never met Gladstone and he asked Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, for the precise measurements of the sitter’s head, which he then shared with fellow sculptor, Hamo Thornycroft. Thornycroft had also been commissioned to produce a memorial to Gladstone and Brock wrote to him on 15 June 1901:\n\n'I was aware that Gladstone had lost the first finger of his left hand, but the hand looked so queer without it that I thought I might be permitted in that particular to depart from the truth, especially as he himself did everything he could to prevent the disfigurement being noticed.'\n\nBrock asked Punch artist, the satirist Harry Furniss to comment on his working clay model for the statue. Instead of describing the politician’s demeanour, Furniss gave an impersonation of Gladstone. Brock immediately:\n\n'turned to the [clay] model, cut the throat across, thrust the head back; then seizing some clay raised both shoulders, after which he forced the elbows in – thus in the space of a few minutes completely altering the general appearance of the figure.'\n\nThe statue was exhibited in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1902, and was later installed in the north transept on 28 March 1903, between John Gibson’s, Sir Robert Peel and Edgar Boehm’s Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield.\n\nHis son, Herbert wrote to Brock on 31 March 1903:\n\n'I must write a line to thank you for your very fine statue of my father. I have looked at it from all points of view and in different lights, and in every way it is worthy of its place in the Abbey.'\n\nThe brief inscription was added to the pedestal later:\n\n‘Erected by Parliament. The Right Honourable William Ewart Gladstone.\n\nFour times Prime Minister. Born December 29 1809. Died May 19 1898.’\n\nFind out more about William Gladstone"
