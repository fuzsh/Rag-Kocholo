        "text": "In 1784 William took a long vacation to the French and Italian Rivieras with his mother and other members of his extended family.\n\nThe trip was around 1200 miles long. Two carriages were used. Wilberforce’s mother and the family members rode in one and Wilberforce and a guest rode in the other. Wilberforce paid for the travel expenses and he was careful about who shared his carriage for such a long ride.\n\nWilberforce’s close friend, Dr. William Burgh of York, was asked, but he couldn’t go. Later, at the Scarborough races, he ran into Isaac Milner, an old acquaintance from his days at Hull Grammar School.\n\nOn an impulse, he extended the offer to him. Isaac had achieved academic distinction. He was a Lucasian Professor at Cambridge and a very religious man. When Wilberforce discovered that, he was surprised and regretted that he had chosen Milner for a traveling companion. Milner turned out to be an affable traveling companion. He was cheerful and good natured, but he was an unapologetic Methodists.\n\nWhile in Nice, Wilberforce picked up a copy of Philip Doddridge’s classic work The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul. Doddridge was a Dissenting minister and hymnist of the early eighteenth century who had an informed and intellectual approach to genuine personal faith. Milner suggested that they read it on their return trip. By the time Wilberforce had reached London, his mind was racing.\n\nSubsequent discussions with Milner about Doddridge’s book helped propel Wilberforce to embrace evangelical Anglicanism. He reread the scriptures that Doddridge had cited which resulted in him giving up everything that he felt didn’t please God, including parties and gentlemen’s social clubs. The next question was whether to stay in politics. With his newfound spiritual leanings, he felt he couldn’t be effective in Parliament.\n\nWilberforce remembered the religious period of his youth when he’d met John Newton. He turned to him for guidance. He hadn’t seen John Newton in over a decade. Newton had been a slave trade captain who converted to the Christian faith. He was the foremost evangelical in London at the time. Wilberforce fully expected Newton to tell him to leave politics, but, to his surprise, Newton told him to stay in politics because God could use him.\n\nWhen Wilberforce left Newton, a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He wasn’t sure about his next move, but the scriptures were clear. His wealth, talents, and his time were not his. It belonged to God and had been given to him to use for God’s purposes and according to God’s will.\n\nWilberforce prayed and read scripture every day. He even memorized scripture. In twenty minutes, he could recite all 176 verses in Psalm 119, which focused on the truth of God’s word.\n\nAfter almost two years contemplating what he should do, Wilberforce decided that God had assigned him two objectives; the suppression of the slave trade and the reformation of manners. He recalled how at age fourteen he had written to a Yorkshire newspaper criticizing the slave trade, however, tackling the slave trade issue would be a courageous move and risky.\n\nSeveral abolitionists had approached him to champion their cause in Parliament. At first Wilberforce was noncommittal. He knew that courage flowed from wisdom, but, gradually, he came to believe that ending slavery was a moral cause and worth the risk.\n\nThe reformation of manners involved the morals and culture of Britain. A biblical worldview was foreign to the British culture. Wilberforce believed that this unbiblical view was central to why people used and abused others with impunity. Everywhere he looked, he saw misery and decay; the mistreatment of children, the excessive use of alcohol, and the use of teenage girls for sexual trafficking. He knew God had his back, but he would need the help of others.\n\nWilberforce befriended people who were theologically and politically on the same page as he. Most of these friends lived in Clapham, a village outside London, where he spent most of his time. They prayed and discussed every issue that confronted them. They became known as the Clapham Circle.\n\nIn 1797, eager to share his faith and to show the real difference between “real Christianity” and the phony “religious system” that prevailed, Wilberforce wrote a book, A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious System of Professed Christians, in the Higher and Middle Classes in This Country, Contrasted with Real Christianity. It was a best seller.\n\nStill, after taking stock of his life, he realized that there was a void and he didn’t want to be alone. In that same year, he met, fell in love, and married Barbara Spooner. Within ten years they had six children. She was a devoted wife."
