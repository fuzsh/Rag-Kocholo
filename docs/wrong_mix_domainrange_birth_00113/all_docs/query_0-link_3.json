        "text": "Mary Evans Picture Library Photo Prints and Wall Art\n\nWoodrow Wilson Writing\n\nWOODROW WILSON American president Date: 1856 - 1924\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 14109153\n\nÂ© Mary Evans Picture Library\n\n1856 Wilson Woodrow 1924\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nThis evocative photograph captures the introsive and thoughtful nature of Woodrow Wilson as he pens a letter or drafts an important document during his tenure as the 28th President of the United States. Born on December 28, 1856, in Staunton, Virginia, Wilson rose to prominence as a scholar and academic before entering politics. He served as the Governor of New Jersey and as a professor at Princeton University before being elected to the White House in 1912. Wilson's presidency was marked by significant achievements, including the passage of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which granted citizenship to African Americans, and the establishment of the Federal Reserve System. He also led the United States into World War I, with the hope of making the world \"safe for democracy.\" Despite these accomplishments, Wilson's presidency was also marred by controversy. His handling of the Russian Revolution and the Treaty of Versailles led to widespread criticism, and his health deteriorated during his second term. Wilson suffered a stroke in 1919, which left him partially paralyzed and unable to effectively govern. He remained in the White House until 1921, when he was succeeded by Calvin Coolidge. This image of Wilson writing at his desk offers a glimpse into the mind of a complex and visionary leader, who, despite his flaws, left an indelible mark on American history. The photograph is a poignant reminder of the power of the written word and the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nFREE COLORIZATION SERVICE\n\nYou can choose advanced AI Colorization for this picture at no extra charge!\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
