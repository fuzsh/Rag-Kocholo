He was above the average as a player, especially in his younger days, when, as Lord Cremorne, he at different times played with nearly all the great masters, including Morphy, Kolisch and Steinitz. With Blackburne he played only two games, on level terms, of which he won one and lost one. During the great London tournament of 1883 Lord Dartrey entertained a number of the competitors at dinner at his home in Curzon Street, Mayfair. His death will be generally regretted by all chess players who had the pleasure and honor of the late earl's acquaintance.\" Cunningham Delannoy, Alphonse born in Evreaux in 1806; part-conductor, in turn, of Le Palemède, La Régence, La Nouvelle Régence, and La Stratègie; prolific writer on chess matters not only in France but in England and the U. S.; He died in 1883. A caution must be given that not all of Delannoy's amusing reminiscences of Morphy can be treated as history. See B. C. M. vol. 1, where Mr. John Watkinson demolishes some of them. Devinck, François Charles born in 1801; a successful chocolate-maker; many times president of the Paris Chamber of Commerce; Deputy; died in 1878; the last survivor of the group watching the Staunton-St. Amant match in the picture published in 1844.

Her friendship for the lamented Pradier has passed into history, and her salons\" are the weekly resort of the most celebrated sculptors, painters, and authors of France....She would get Morphy opposite her, and St. Amant or Lequesne by her side to stop her when she was about making too serious a mistake, and would play game after game, making us all laugh the whole time with her charming anecdotes and jeux d'esprit.\"\n\nEdge also credits la Baronne with Saint Amant's comeback against Staunton in the 1843 match. He wrote \".... she had no easy task instilling courage into her countryman...\"\n\nFiske, Daniel Willard born in 1833 and died in 1904. He was a strong chess player who helped organize the First American Chess Congress. He was a Scandinavian scholar by profession, educated at Upsala and Copenhagen but was also editor of the Chess Monthly while Morphy worked as co-editor. He wrote several books about chess with insights into Morphy. His letters to Morphy, Maurian and to others concerning Morphy are also quite revealing. Forde, Dr. A.

He learned chess in college from Morphy himself and continued to play against Morphy until near the end of Morphy's life at ever decreasing odds. While he never played in any organized tournaments, he acquitted himself competently in even, casual games against some of the greatest players of the era: Mackenzie, Steinitz, Tchigorin, Zuckertort and many others. After Morphy left for Europe in 1858, Maurian was the strongest player in the New Orleans Chess Club.

He was a relatively unknown player at the time of the Congress but won second place, gave several blindfold demonstrations, and although having publicly proclaimed that he would in fact win the tournament, afterwards praised Morphy's skills as such he considered Morphy's challenge to play any American at odds of a pawn and a move reasonable, even against himself. Paulsen later became one of the strongest player's in the world and a leading theorist. He won second place in London, 1862 and first place at Leipzig, 1877. He also won two matches against Adolph Anderssen between 1876 and 1877. Perrin, Alphonse Perrin, Frederick secretary of the N.Y. Chess Club. Born in London in 1816.

[Sergeant]\n\nSlous wrote Stray Leaves from the Scrape-Book of an Awkward Man published first in 1844, revised and reprinted in 1881. According to Garrett Scott Bookseller:\n\nAn entertaining miscellany of verse, sketches and fiction from this man of letters who was president of the London Stock Exchange and (for a time) one of England's best chess players. The verses here include an account in heroic couplets of a chess game by Gioachino Greco (the seventeen moves are given in the footnotes--the game appears to this inexpert cataloguer a variation on the Giuoco Piano), as well as bald prose account of two postal chess games played between 1847 and 1849.

He felt he was superior to Saint-Amant and equal to Morphy. He was probably neither. Thompson often tried to win his games through intimidation both with unsound combinations and with verbal disparagements. He was considered an expert on the Evans Gambit. Thrupp, J. Tilghman, B. C. Walker, George Ware, G. P. G. Preston Ware, Jr. -born, Aug 12, 1821 in Wrentham, MA - died, Jan. 29, 1890 in Boston.
