        "text": "This article appeared in the May 2015 issue of Forbes Austria.\n\nA member of the Piech-Porsche clan, Louise Kiesling filled her uncle Ferdinand Piech’s vacant seat on Volkswagen Group’s Board of Directors, after he resigned as Chairman in the midst of a power struggle this past spring. One of Europe’s most powerful business women today, she has distanced herself from the prominent family’s inner conflicts to pursue her own path in textile manufacturing, with her newly acquired company, Backhausen.\n\n\"I find the events that have taken place during the last few days very regrettable. It is with great respect that I look on the accomplishments of my uncle, Prof. Dr. Ferdinand Piëch, and truly appreciate what he has done for the family\". This was Louise Kiesling's reaction to the resignation of the head of the VW Board of Directors and his wife, Ursula, at the end of April.\n\nOnly a few days later, she was asked to follow her uncle onto the Board of Directors. The second vacant seat on the board was taken by her cousin, Julia Kuhn-Piёch. Kiesling is now one of the most influential personalities in the global economy.\n\nIn her interview with Forbes Austria, however, Kiesling seems ambivalent toward shakeups on the carmaker’s Board. \"It simply happened\", she explained, \"It came somewhat unexpectedly.\" And: \"In view of the dynamics that presently prevail, I have to first of all take things as they come.\" We ask whether she feels prepared for the job. \"We'll see whether or not I have the necessary competencies.\" Above all, she thinks her main competencies are in automobile design and her \"enormous interest in future-oriented mobility themes.\"\n\nIt was at the end of April – at just about the peak of contention between the Porsche and Piëch families – that we had the opportunity to meet the 57 year-old businesswoman, the owner of the textile manufacturing company Backhausen.\n\nCordial Reception\n\nKiesling's creative assistant, Thomas Konzier, receives us in Backhausen's traditional weaving mill in Hoheneich in Lower Austria’s Waldviertel. Louise Kiesling appears a few minutes later.\n\n\"It’s not easy to always be associated only with the family. What bothered me most was that the newspapers wrote ‘Piëch Niece Buys Backhausen’”. In fact, Kiesling has her own independent, highly successful career to look back on, separate from the automobile world. Over the past 15 years, the “neo-Waldviertler” has lived mainly in London. About eight months ago, she swapped the hectic everyday life of the metropolis for a supposedly quieter one. She has finally fulfilled her dream of buying the 165 year-old traditional textile company, Backhausen.\n\nIt was a gamble, too, she says. The enterprise has already twice stood on the brink of economic ruin – it made headlines in 2012 with a declaration of bankruptcy, and Kiesling averted a second insolvency by purchasing the enterprise in September of 2014.\n\nGetting Down To The Nitty-Gritty\n\n\"At that time, the company was not doing as well as the papers had reported. You can quote me on that, Kiesling said. “The products did not measure up, and without a good product, nothing works.\" Her membership on Backhausen's Advisory Board, held since 2013, wasn't enough for her.\n\n\"It was clear to me that if I didn't take it over myself, then I couldn't change anything here.\" She doesn’t disclose her connection to the former owners, the circle of ex-chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer and the Hypo Niederösterreich. She is also silent about the purchase price.\n\nWe walk briskly through the weaving mill – she, I, her son and her assistant. When it’s time for photos, the assistant has to serve as Kiesling's bag holder. He does it routinely and with composure.\n\nOn our way through the facility, the businesswoman greets her employees who, in turn, treat her with enormous respect and politeness. \"We have a good spirit here\", she says. It’s certainly worlds away from VW and Porsche - two enterprises in which Kiesling herself might have shares. How much, she cloaks in secrecy. Her mother, Louise Daxer-Piëch, who died in 2006, presumably bundled her shares (ten percent each in the Porsche Holding and the Porsche AG) with those of Ferdinand Alexander Porsche and Gerhard Porsche. For insiders, this was a sign that she was closer to the Porsches than her brother Ferdinand was. Unlike her mother, Louise Kiesling maintains a good relationship with both branches of the family. She even values the notoriously despotic Ferdinand Piëch for his modesty and amenability.\n\nBut here too, she'd prefer not to comment.\n\n\"I'm extremely 'hands-on'. That's not everyone's cup of tea. I'm interested in design, but just as equally in the mill's finances.\"\n\nThe mother of a grown-up son would far rather speak about her \"baby\", Backhausen. At first, the staff was apprehensive about having yet another new owner. This uncertainty has now abated, possibly due to Kiesling's investment plans: \"We will bring the mill right up to snuff and modernize everything. We are currently evaluating the processes in the entire enterprise. Many looms will be replaced during the coming years.\" The basic staff of 75 will remain, and possibly even increase. The new owner has a lot of plans for Backhausen, which had a turnover of less than ten million Euro in 2013.\n\nAlthough one can hardly understand a word above the noise of the machines, Kiesling outlines the details of certain materials with great enthusiasm.\n\nOn 19 looms, complicated designs are woven centimeter by centimeter. Among them are the designs for which the company is well-known, such as those of Otto Wagner, a renowned Austrian architect. Woven goods for priests' robes are also manufactured here, ‘with gold thread woven into them’, explains the boss, full of enthusiasm.\n\nKiesling’s interest in fashion was aroused through her mother, Louise Daxer-Piëch. \"My mother always wore very beautiful clothes\", but the really creative one was her grandmother, Louise Porsche, daughter of the enterprise's founder, Ferdinand Porsche. \"My grandmother always took me along to drawing and painting classes.\" Her family's creativity already fascinated her as a child.\n\nPowerful Women\n\nKiesling has also always been devoted to technical design. \"Ferdinand Alexander Porsche influenced me enormously.\" She worked with the designer of the legendary Porsche 911 during her fashion studies at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. \"Sometimes we sat over an evening meal and thought about how things could function.\" Kiesling was able to integrate her many talents, and family know-how, into her studies: a PhD in automobile design at London's Royal College of Art followed her diploma in fashion studies.\n\nAlthough the businesswoman doesn't like to talk about it, the influence of her prominent family is obvious, including in matters of leadership. The women of the dynasty, such as Kiesling's grandmother and name giver, Louise, were both active in business administration, and on supervisory boards. In this respect, Kiesling's promotion to the VW Board of Directors was a logical continuation of the family tradition.\n\nHer enthusiasm for Austria as a business location is not surprising, in view of this context. \"Austria as a production location for textiles and their further processing has almost ceased to exist. It's important to me that our know-how doesn't disappear. Today, everything is produced in China and firms in India are always on the look-out for European firms that they can take over. They also have a good tradition - I don't want to badmouth that. But we can't submit ourselves to being put under such a yoke.\"\n\nAt any rate, Kiesling has come to stay. Company logistics, production and quality control are being actively analyzed and improved. \"I am extremely 'hands-on'. That's not everyone's cup of tea. I am interested in design, and also equally in finances, IT or the mill. Those people who are not arrogant but who demonstrate their presence through their talents”, impress me most, she says.\n\nIt's clear that this attitude towards achievement creates a challenging environment for the entire family. It is undeniable that their success is perennially rife with bitter disputes over money and power. These feuds have plagued the Porsche-Piëchs clan for decades. On the other hand, they also define their success over generations.\n\nFeuds And Family\n\nThe conflict peaked unexpectedly at the end of April. This last battle between Ferdinand Piëch and Wolfgang Porsche was won by the latter, who pushed the VW patriarch out of the Board of Directors. In the showdown initiated by Piëch regarding the dismissal of VW CEO Martin Winterkorn, Wolfgang Porsche backed Winterkorn.\n\nInsiders say that Piëch's disempowerment amounted to an almost unbearable public humiliation. But Piëch retained his seat on the Board of Directors of Porsche SE, and thus, part of his influence on VW.\n\nIn such moments, Louise Kiesling really wants to be seen as detached from her family and going her own way. \"I also try to communicate this to my children. It's not important where you come from, it's the individual achievement that counts.\" Backhausen is the project with which she hopes to prove this."
