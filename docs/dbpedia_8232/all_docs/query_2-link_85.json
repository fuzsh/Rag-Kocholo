        "text": "O-SIIs can pose a risk to a country’s financial system. Their systemic relevance and anticipation of bailout in the event of a crisis may cause moral hazard. O-SII buffers reduce the likelihood of bank failures and therefore (partly) offset the higher social costs that would result from the malfunctioning or failure of a credit institution.\n\nEuropean Banking Authority guidelines (EBA/GL/2014/10) establish a two-step process for identifying O-SIIs. In the first step, banks are given a score according to the following indicators: (1) size, (2) importance for the economy of the EU or of the relevant EU member state, (3) complexity/cross-border activity, and (4) interconnectedness of the institution or group with the financial system (see Article 23d Austrian Banking Act). In the second step, the national authorities use supervisory judgment, i.e. they draw on their expertise on the relevant banking sector to ensure that any further systemically important banks are identified as O-SIIs even if they were not identified as such in the first step.\n\nThe OeNB’s website provides details on the methodological approach underlying the O-SII buffer and legal and economic background information (German only). This information has been disclosed in 2023 to meet stakeholder requests for greater transparency.\n\nThe FMSB makes the following recommendations:\n\nThe FMSB confirms the list of identified O-SIIs and recommends continuing the phase-in period as decided in 2022 for the time being, while limiting the increase in the combined buffer requirement to 50 basis points against 2022 (Recommendation FMSB/5/2022).\n\nThis year, Steiermärkische Bank und Sparkasse AG was for the first time identified as an O-SII, based on the indicator “deposits guaranteed under deposit guarantee scheme” in accordance with Annex 2 of EBA/GL/2014/10. This additional indicator is used in Austria in accordance with Title III of EBA/GL/2014/10. Steiermärkische Bank und Sparkasse AG has exceeded the relevant threshold for a second year in a row. In line with the one-year observation period that is generally applied, Steiermärkische Bank und Sparkasse AG now has to be classified as an O-SII. Under the phase-in regime that is applicable until 2024 (buffers will be increased by a maximum of 0.25 percentage points per year in 2023 and 2024), Steiermärkische Bank und Sparkasse AG’s 2024 O-SII buffer rate will be limited to 0.25% for the time being.\n\nThe FMSB therefore recommends applying the following O-SII buffer rates at the consolidated and unconsolidated levels."
