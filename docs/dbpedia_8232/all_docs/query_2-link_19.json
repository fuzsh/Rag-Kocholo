This note assesses and makes recommendations regarding bank resolution and crisis management arrangements. The scope of the assessment includes the institutional arrangements for recovery, resolution, and crisis management; the supervision of banks’ recovery plans; the legal regime for bank bankruptcy and resolution; resolution planning by the authorities and addressing impediments to resolution; assuring funding to support resolution; the two deposit guarantee schemes; and the government authorities’ collective preparedness to deal with financial crisis. Recovery and resolution planning are well advanced. Key impediments to resolution have been identified and are being addressed, yet adequate means to ensure enough funding in resolution remains to be determined. The legal framework is sound, although additional flexibility could be provided in the bankruptcy regime. The authorities’ collective contingency planning for financial crisis and testing of plans should be intensified.",

        "text": "D. Recent Crisis Experience\n\n7. There are three instances of bank failures in Austria during and subsequent to the global financial crisis that were still undergoing resolution subsequent to the prior FSAP until the time of the current FSAP. These involved the failure and nationalization of Hypo Alpe Adria Bank International AG, the failure and nationalization of Kommunalkredit Austria AG, and the failure of the Austria Volksbanken AG and the ongoing restructuring of the VB sector. All three were subject to EC-approved restructuring and state aid programs. The remaining element of each of these cases is a wind-down entity established under provisions of the BaSAG and the GSA,17 respectively, not found in the BRRD, which allows an institution to apply to be converted into a wind-down entity.18 Each case is briefly summarized below.\n\n8. HETA Asset Resolution AG (HETA) is the wind-down entity ultimately resulting from the resolution of the failure of Hypo Alpe Adria Bank International AG (HB Intl). At the time of its nationalization by the government in December 2009, HB Intl operating in Austria owned banking or leasing subsidiaries in 11 Southeastern European (SEE) countries. A provisional State Aid decision was rendered by the EC that month and a final decision was rendered in September 2013. The final decision required the government to sell the Austrian and SEE operations of the group, among other restructuring measures. To facilitate the sales and restructuring, the group’s Italian bank subsidiary, shares in various nonfinancial companies, and bad assets from several group entities were segregated for wind-down. The government passed special legislation, the GSA, effective August 2014, to facilitate the wind-down. HETA became a wind-down entity under this legislation in October 2014 to hold the residual assets and liabilities.19 In February 2015, an asset quality review conducted by management determined that HETA had significant negative capital. The government, as 100 percent owner, decided not to provide further government support to HETA. The BRRD then rendered a “Fail or Likely to Fail” (FOLTF) decision20 on March 1, 2015 that HETA was not viable, and imposed a 15-month debt moratorium; both actions were taken under the newly enacted BaSAG. A preliminary decision on bailing-in creditors under the BaSAG was taken in April 2016. After a valuation process, as required under the law,21 and after hearing appeals provided for under administrative law, the bail-in decision was finalized in May 2017.22 Under this decision, the shareholder (the government), holders of other capital instruments, and subordinated debtholders were written off and other creditors were written down to 64 percent. Upon the writeoff of the shareholder, the FMA Board as the NRA took control of the wind-down entity. Bailed-in creditors have subsequently been written up to 86 percent, as the realization of value on assets has exceeded projections inherent in the valuation supporting the original bail-in decision.\n\n9. KA Finanz AG (KF) is the wind-down entity ultimately resulting from the resolution of the failure of Kommunalkredit Austria AG (KA). At the time of its nationalization by the government in November 2008, KA was the seventh largest Austrian bank, and 51 percent of its shares were owned by Österreichische Volksbanken AG (see next paragraph) and 49 percent by Dexia Crédit Local. In March 2011, the EC rendered a State Aid decision approving a restructuring plan proposed by the government that resulted in assets with strategic long-run value being held by KA, and non-strategic assets being held by KF. KA was to be sold. Under the terms of an amended State Aid decision of July 2013, which was required due to the inability to sell KA in the timeframe stipulated in the original decision, KA ceased undertaking new banking business and was to run down its operations while attempts to sell it, or its assets, continued. In September 2015, KA concluded the sale of some 40 percent of its assets, and the remaining assets were merged into KF, which still retained a banking license. In June 2017, KF made application to the FMA to convert into a wind-down entity. In September 2017, the application was approved.\n\n10. immigon is the wind-down entity ultimately resulting from the resolution of the failure of Österreichische Volksbanken AG (VBAG). VBAG was the central institution for the Volksbanken sector in Austria. The government had provided various public support to the bank. In September 2012, the EC rendered a State Aid decision approving the recapitalization and restructuring of VBAG.23 The ECB Comprehensive Assessment in 2014 determined there remained a significant shortfall in capital. In part as a means to address the shortfall, in May 2015 the shareholders resolved to split-up VBAG by transferring to Volksbanken Wien VBAG’s assets, liabilities, and functions associated with its role as the central institution for the Volksbanken sector and converting its remaining business into a wind-down entity.24 In May 2015, VBAG made application to the FMA for the conversion into a wind-down entity, which the FMA approved. An amended State Aid decision was rendered, and the transaction was affected, in July 2015.25 immigon completed the wind-down of its asset portfolio in January 2019. Its liabilities are expected be paid in full when due over the next several years.26\n\nA. Institutional Framework\n\n11. As in other members of the BU, the ECB, and the SRB play a significant role in bank supervision and resolution in Austria. The roles of the ECB under the Single Supervision Mechanism (SSM) and the SRB under the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) mainly fall into three categories: (i) the exercise of direct supervision powers by the ECB, and resolution planning and resolution decision-making powers by the SRB over the institutions under their respective remits27; (ii) the oversight of the National Competent (Supervisory) Authorities (NCAs) by the ECB and National Resolution Authorities (NRAs) by the SRB; and (iii) if deemed necessary, to ensure consistent application of supervisory and resolution standards, the direct exercise by the ECB and SRB of their respective powers for institutions under the purview of NCAs and NRAs. To date, the ECB and the SRB have not exercised such powers in Austria.\n\n12. The domestic financial authorities continue to play critical roles. The domestic authorities relevant to this Note are the FMA, the OeNB, and the MOF. The FMA is both Austria’s NCA and NRA. It contributes substantially to the work of the ECB and SRB with respect to Austrian banks by participating in ECB Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs) and SRB Internal Resolution Teams (IRTs). It is responsible for all banks/groups not under the remit of those two institutions. The FMA, as the NRA, is responsible also for executing all failure resolution actions, including those decided upon by the SRB,28 and for the monitoring of resolution entities.29 The OeNB is Austria’s national central bank (NCB) and contributes substantially to FMA’s supervisory and resolution functions. The OeNB, too, participates in JSTs and IRTs. Within the MOF, the Directorate General for Economic Policy, Financial Markets, and Customs Duties deals with economic and financial policy at the domestic and international level and has roles in dealing with bank failures and crises, particularly with respect to extraordinary funding needs.30\n\n13. The FMA’s organization arrangements ensure an adequate functional separation of its tasks as the NCA and the NRA, but ultimate decision making for supervisory and resolution matters is unified. The two-person FMA Executive Board (FMA Board) takes decisions on both supervisory and resolution matters. Its decisions relate to the HP-LSIs and LSIs under the FMA’s authority, and to the Austrian position on and input to matters relevant to SIs and other banks under the remit of the ECB or SRB. Operationally, the FMA’s Banking Supervision Department (BSD) reports directly to the FMA Board. It has five divisions whose duties include supervision of all banks and supervision of the Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGSs). The Banking Resolution Department (BRD), established for the purpose of performing the FMA’s tasks as Austria’s NRA, reports separately and directly to the FMA Board and is comprised of two teams, one for resolution planning and one for resolution execution.31 Neither department has automatic access to the files of the other, though when necessary to fulfill their respective roles, they receive access to relevant files for the most part.32 The FMA Board takes key resolution-related decisions; others are delegated to the BRD. Decisions taken by the FMA Board include, among others, approving resolution plans, the choice and application of resolution tools, appointment of valuation auditors, ordering banks to hold specific amounts of own fund, and liabilities eligible for bail-in, as well as significant decisions in ongoing resolution activities in a bank or other entities under resolution.\n\n14. Similarly, the OeNB’s supervisory and resolution functions are operationally separate. The Financial Stability, Banking Supervision and Statistics group, headed by a vice governor, includes the Department for the Supervision of SIs, the Department for Financial Stability and for the Supervision of LSIs, and the Statistics Department. The former two support the FMA as NCA. The Office for Specific Bank Resolution Matters (REFBA) of the Statistics Department engages with and supports the FMA as NRA.\n\n15. There is a high degree of cooperation within and between the FMA and the OeNB with respect to supervisory and resolution functions. Much of the cooperation derives from the requirements of the BRRD as transposed by means of the BaSAG. It is also a result of the significant workload and inter-agency cooperation over the past decade in dealing with the consequences of the global financial crisis for the Austrian financial system.\n\n16. The FMA and the MOF should consider separating ultimate decision making for supervisory and resolution matters in the FMA. The BRRD provides that Member States “may exceptionally provide for the resolution authority to be the competent authorities for supervision,”33 and, in this case, requires that structural arrangements be in place to ensure operational independence and avoid conflicts of interest. The operational separation of the BSD and the BRD goes far in meeting these requirements, and the FMA structure is in line with EC law and guidance, but unification of ultimate decision making at the FMA Board could give rise to potential conflicts of interest, and to the appearance of potential for conflicts. For example, a situation may arise where the supervisory function advocates for resolution of a failing LSI as a going-concern,34 whereas the resolution function advocates for use of bankruptcy proceedings. While under the BaSAG, the FMA Board as NRA is the decision maker in this case; the FMA Board is nonetheless placed in a conflict situation under the current arrangements. Similarly, under the BRRD the NRA serves in effect as a backstop in the event the NCA fails to take timely action to make a determination as to whether an LSI remains viable; in that event, the NRA can make the determination.35 This possibility of the NRA is set out in the Austrian transposition of the BRRD. The FMA as NRA applies the FOLTF policy of the SRB, highlighting cases where the RA shall on its own initiative initiate an FOLTF proceeding. However, these decisions are reserved in both instances for the FMA Board, acting as both NRA and NCA, and therefore no such backstop exists in Austria.36\n\n17. Deposit guarantee scheme (DGS) arrangements were reorganized on January 1, 2019. Four of the previous five sectoral DGSs were, in effect, merged into Einlagensicherung AUSTRIA Ges.m.b.H. (ESA), and the funds of those four schemes were transferred to ESA. The savings bank (Sparkassen) sector continues to operate its own separate DGS, the Sparkassen-Haftungs GmbH (S-Haftung), which is an institutional protection scheme (IPS) recognized by the FMA pursuant to the ESAEG as both an IPS and a DGS.37 Both ESA and S-Haftung are supervised by the FMA.\n\n18. The BRD is reasonably well resourced on an actual and contingent basis. The department currently has a permanent staff of 24. This includes the department head, 12 staff in the resolution planning team, 10 in the resolution execution team, and 1 support staff. Among resolution planning team staff, five are focused on resolution planning for SIs and seven for LSIs. Among other additional tasks, they examine the recovery plans for 140 Austrian banks with a view to identify options that potentially adversely impact the resolvability of the banks. Among resolution execution team staff, five are focused on supervision and monitoring of the three wind-down entities, and the others are involved in making preparations to be able to exercise resolution options and implement resolution tools, among other tasks. Further staff increases are not envisioned at this time. As noted, the BRD is supported by OeNB’s REFBA, which has a staff of six that work full-time on resolution matters and serve as the focal point of interaction between the BRD and other OeNB units.38 The REFBA prepares analyses for consideration by BRD’s staff by drafting resolution plans. The BRD regularly utilizes outside experts to support its work.39 It has entered into contingency contracts with five audit firms to undertake required valuations40 and other work, and five law firms to deal with the many legal issues that arise in resolution execution. It is considering contracting for investment banking expertise as well (e.g., merger and acquisition). In addition, appropriately skilled staff in other FMA departments who can be temporarily seconded to the BRD have been identified in advance.\n\n19. Legal protections for the staff of the FMA and OeNB are adequate, but the protections should be extended to other parties acting under the direction of the FMA Board as NRA. Under the FMABG, the FMA as well as its employees and bodies are not liable towards an injured party. If, under the provisions of the Public Liability Act, the Federal Government reimburses any damages awarded to injured parties it could demand reimbursement from the FMA’s bodies or employees. The bodies of the FMA would have to reimburse the Federal State if it was found that they acted with gross negligence. Under the BaSAG, reimbursement is further limited when administering tasks concerning banking resolution which can only be demanded from the FMA’s bodies or employees and from the bodies or employees of the OeNB if they have intentionally committed a breach of law. This also applies to seconded staff and external third-party experts if they are hired or working under the direction of the FMA, but does not apply to the managers of bridge institutions or asset management vehicles unless FMA staff fulfill these functions. Managers of bridge institutions and asset management vehicles may act to execute a resolution scheme directed by the FMA Board as NRA.41 The FMA should ensure that the managers benefit from protections comparable to those available to FMA staff.\n\n20. Summary of recommendations:\n\nThe MOF and the FMA should consider separating ultimate decision making for supervisory and resolution matters at the level of the FMA Board; and\n\nThe FMA should ensure that the managers of bridge institutions and asset management vehicles benefit from protections comparable to those available to FMA staff.\n\nC. Legal Regime for Bankruptcy and Resolution53\n\n32. The legal frameworks governing the failure of banks are those for bankruptcy proceedings and for resolution outside of bankruptcy when certain conditions are met, including that of being in the public interest. Banks that are non-systemic in failure are subject to bankruptcy proceedings as regulated by the Insolvency Code (IO) as modified by the BWG. Banks that are potentially systemic in failure are resolved using the powers in the BaSAG.\n\nBankruptcy Proceedings\n\n33. Bank bankruptcy proceedings are a court-led process. In the case of material insolvency of a bank, following an FOLTF assessment by the BSD and a determination by the FMA Board, as NRA, on the advice of BRD that use of resolution tools is not in the public interest (see details below), the FMA Board as NCA may petition the court to open bankruptcy proceedings.54 In general, material insolvency exists when a bank is unable to make payments or is over-indebted based on an evaluation of assets at liquidation value. If the court agrees to open bankruptcy proceedings, it appoints a bankruptcy administrator in consultation with the FMA. The bankruptcy administrator divests the bank’s assets with the aim of maximizing the creditors’ recovery.55 The opening of bankruptcy proceedings triggers a deposit payout and the relevant DGS, subrogating the claims of covered depositors, becomes a preferred creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings.56 The conditions of material insolvency are either illiquidity (the inability to pay deposits or debts) or over-indebtedness. A bank is considered over-indebted when its assets are insufficient to cover its liabilities. In bankruptcy proceedings, the FMA has the status of a party to the proceedings. The court must consult the FMA regarding the dismissal of the bankruptcy administrator. As a party to the proceedings, the FMA has all procedural rights (e.g., the right to appeal against court decisions, to attend hearings, and to have access to relevant documents).\n\n34. The creditor hierarchy in the IO has been modified in the case of banks by the BaSAG. The uncovered deposits of households and SMEs are given preference to a broad class of general creditors (which includes senior bond holders, uncovered corporate depositors, and claims of tax authorities, among other unsecured claims). Covered deposits have a higher ranking, as do the DGSs in subrogation of covered depositors in the case of a payout.\n\n35. There is no scope to transfer the covered deposits and sound assets of a failing bank to an acquirer under the bankruptcy regime. The DGSs can only pay out deposits57 and the assets can only be sold by the bankruptcy administrator. Compared to transactions involving both the purchase (of sound assets) and assumption (of covered deposits) by an acquirer (purchase and assumption (P&A) transaction), in a payout: (i) the realizable value of the failed bank’s assets will likely be diminished, particularly if sold piecemeal; (ii) the counterparts to the assets will be inconvenienced (particularly small businesses whose only or main banking relationship is with the failed bank) and will incur additional costs (establishing a banking relationship with a new bank); and (iii) the DGSs will have higher upfront cash outlays and, potentially, higher long-run costs.58 Under the current legal regime, a P&A transaction can only be executed under the BaSAG (using the sale of business tool—see below), the prerequisites for which few banks will meet (e.g., the “public interest” test). The MOF should consider recommending to the MOJ to provide explicitly for P&A transactions in the bankruptcy regime, thus making the tool available for use in all bank failures.59\n\nResolution Regime for Systemic Banks\n\n36. The BRD has available the tools and underlying resolution powers set out in the international standard60 and in the BRRD. These are: (i) the “bridge institution” tool (based on the power of the FMA to establish an institution temporarily owned by the government61 to acquire assets and liabilities62 from a bank in resolution in order to ensure continuity of functions deemed critical until a buyer can be found); (ii) the “sale of business” tool (the power to transfer assets and liabilities from a bank in resolution without shareholder or creditor consent to third parties or to a bridge institution); (iii) the “bail-in” tool (the power to write-down63 and/or convert into equity eligible liabilities to absorb losses and recapitalize a bank in resolution64) and; (iv) the “asset separation” tool (the power to transfer assets that were not transferred when using the sale of business tool, or not retained when undertaking a whole bank bail-in transaction, again without shareholder or creditor consent, to an asset management vehicle (AMV) established by the FMA for the purpose of managing and maximizing the value of the assets). The SRB can make use of these tools and powers, and its decision to do so is implemented directly by the FMA/BRD under procedures described below.\n\n37. The legal framework guiding the circumstances under which these resolution powers can be used is in place. In general, the powers are available for use when the use of bankruptcy proceedings is determined by the BRD, with input from the OeNB, likely to give rise to unacceptable financial or economic consequences.65 More specifically, the resolution powers may be used when (i) the bank is deemed to be FOLTF66; (ii) the BRD/SRB in consultation with the BSD/ECB determines that there are no reasonable prospects that sufficient and timely private sector measures will be taken; and (iii) use of the resolution powers is deemed by the BRD/SRB to be in the public interest. The FOLTF determination is the responsibility in the first instance of the BSD/ECB, but as a safeguard in the event they fail to act in a timely manner, the determination may be made by the BRD/SRB. The BSD’s or BRD’s judgement must be approved by the FMA board, acting respectively as NCA or NRA.67 The public interest determination is to be based on a judgment that the use of bankruptcy proceedings would not ensure that the objectives of resolution, namely ensuring continuity of the bank’s critical functions, maintaining financial stability, safeguarding public funds, protecting covered depositors and covered investors and protecting client funds and assets, will be met. When requested by the BRD in order to support its decision making, the OeNB will provide an opinion on the existence of a public interest in use of resolution powers. The BRD should routinely seek such an opinion.\n\n38. The BSD and the BRD have adopted internal procedures for coordination. But have not yet agreed on a policy on how to apply certain discretionary elements in the FOLTF determination. Important in this regard is determining when a bank no longer meets the requirements for continuing authorization in a manner that would justify the withdrawal of its authorization. The BSD and the BRD established a working group to address matters related to FOLTF determinations and should come to agreement on such a policy as soon as practical. One key objective should be to ensure that an FOLTF assessment is triggered well prior to balance sheet insolvency,68 in part so as to promote better outcomes for creditors in bankruptcy proceedings (where the public interest assessment following the FOLTF determination deems that use of resolution tools is not required).\n\n39. Procedures for use of resolution powers and tools are well established. The FMA Board as NRA, on the BRD’s advice, initiates resolution actions69 by means of an emergency administrative decision70 without a formal preceding investigation (i.e., no requirement for formal input—a right-to-be-heard—from the effected bank) and without a requirement for any ex ante action by the court. The decision is issued by means of an edict published on the FMA’s website. Upon publication, the decision is deemed effective towards the bank and all parties whose rights may be affected. The bank and other parties whose rights may be affected (e.g., shareholders, creditors) may challenge the decision within three months of publication. A challenge does not suspend the effects of the decision. Upon expiry of the three months, the BRD will officially initiate an investigation, will address any challenges against the emergency administrative decision, and the FMA Board as NRA will render a final decision by means of an administrative decision.71 This administrative decision, too, will be announced by means of an edict published on the FMA website. Affected parties then have the right to appeal in the Federal Court system. If a resolution decision is repealed or amended by a court, it generally will not remove the legal effect of the administrative decision. The removal of the legal effect is only possible if, among other conditions, it does not place the resolution objectives at risk and would not constitute a threat to the interests of third parties that require protection (such as purchasers of assets and liabilities of the bank in resolution). In the case that the legal effect cannot be removed, an affected party may pursue a claim against the federal government for compensation of any unlawfully caused disadvantages as a result of the administrative decisions issued by the FMA Board.\n\n40. SRB decisions are subject to challenge at the local level and also at the European level. Most decisions of the SRB relevant to Austria must be implemented by the FMA, as NRA, and are thus subject to challenge locally. Certain SRB decisions also are subject to challenge to the SRB’s Appeals Panel. Among the most relevant of these are SRB requirements that banks hold a required volume of own funds and liabilities for bail-in (so-called MREL, described in Section D, below) and that banks make extraordinary contributions to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF, described in Section E, below).72 However, all SRB decisions as well as those of the Appeals Panel are subject to challenge at the European Court of Justice (ECJ). There is legal uncertainty as to the interaction between the two jurisdictions of possible appeal by affected parties. It should be clarified in that either an appeal to the SRB Appeals Panel or the ECJ suspends the appeal period in the national courts until there is a final judgement by the European authorities, or that the national judicial proceedings should be stayed until the European authorities have rendered a ruling. In any case, SRB decisions implemented by the FMA should be given effect as any other FMA administrative decision and should not be suspended by virtue of an appeal.\n\n41. The FMA has the power to write down and convert capital instruments of a bank as a standalone tool, or in conjunction with taking resolution action. Under the BaSAG, a bank’s equity can be written down or off, and its additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments can be converted in equity or written down or off. The FMA Board, as NCA, on the BSD’s advice, can do so in order to ensure a bank’s viability. The FMA Board, as NRA, on the BRD’s advice, can do so prior to or simultaneously with taking resolution action (as described below), and must do so where extraordinary public support (also as described below) is required. Prior to exercising the power to write down and/or convert capital instruments, the BRD may obtain a professional third-party valuation to determine the extent of losses on assets, with a view to ensure that they are fully absorbed by existing capital instruments. In case this is not expedient, as may well be the case, the BRD can perform its own provisional valuation subject to adjustment73 based on an ex post third-party definitive valuation.\n\n42. In certain circumstances, the finance minister must provide consent prior to the FMA Board, as NRA, exercising resolution powers and also can provide extraordinary public support to a resolution. The FMA Board must seek the minister’s written approval prior to taking any actions that may have a direct fiscal impact or which have systemic implications. The BRD and MOF are working to an agreed interpretation of these requirements and should reach agreement as soon as possible. In addition, in the extraordinary circumstance in which the resolution tools prove inadequate, the minister may, in consultation with the OeNB and the FMA Board, acting as both NCA and NRA, direct the use of the so-called government stabilization tools involving equity support from the state and/or temporary public ownership.74,75 The MOF should formulate internal written policies and procedures as to when and how the government stabilization tools might be utilized.\n\n43. The legal safeguards for shareholders and creditors set out in the international standard are in place. Among these safeguards, shareholders and creditors are protected from incurring losses in the context of the use of resolution powers greater than they would have incurred under bankruptcy proceedings (the so-called “no-creditor-worse-off” (NCWO) principle). If left financially worse off, based on a professional third-party valuation,76 they are entitled to compensation from the SRF. While the resolution powers must be exercised in a manner that respects the hierarchy of claims set out in the BaSAG, the power to deviate from pari passu treatment of creditors under specifically defined and limited circumstances is in place, but explicitly so only when using the bail-in tool. The ability to depart from the pari passu treatment of creditors in a class should also be explicitly available when using the sale-of-business tool and the bridge-institution tool. This may be necessary, for example, to allow for the transfer of certain liabilities (e.g., uncovered corporate deposits), but not other liabilities within the same creditor class (e.g., senior unsecured bonds). The MOF should amend the BaSAG to make explicit the power to deviate from pari passu treatment of creditors when using any resolution tool, so as to reduce the potential that the lack of express authority gives rise to legal challenge.\n\n44. The legal framework provides the FMA Board, acting as NRA, with wide-ranging powers to seek to remedy impediments to resolution. It has adequate powers to require changes to enhance resolvability of banks and groups, including banks. These measures include, inter alia, requiring a bank to limit its maximum individual and aggregate exposures, divest specific assets, limit or cease specific activities, and change its legal or operational structure. These powers have not been exercised to date, as banks have made satisfactory progress to address impediments.\n\n45. The FMA Board, as NRA, has made use of certain of the BaSAG powers and tools. In the case of the HETA resolution, the FMA Board applied the bail-in tool after rendering an FOLTF determination. It also utilized a general resolution power that allows it to alter the maturity of debt instruments issued by the institution in resolution, in the HETA case in the form of a 15-month creditor moratorium.\n\n46. The HETA resolution highlighted a provision in the Austrian tax code that treats restructuring gains as taxable income. Such gains would arise, for example, when the liabilities of a bank in resolution are written down in bail-in. The GSA that was enacted for the purpose of the HETA resolution provided an exemption from this requirement. The MOF should explore the scope for making explicit in legislation that restructuring gains are not taxable.\n\n47. Summary of Recommendations:\n\nConsider providing for P&A transactions in the bankruptcy regime;\n\nThe BRD should routinely seek the opinion of OeNB on the existence of a public interest in the use of resolution powers;\n\nThe BSD and BRD should agree on a policy on how to apply the elements of the FOLTF determination;\n\nThe MOF should seek to clarify in the legal framework the interaction of potential simultaneous appeals of SRB decisions at the local and European levels;\n\nThe BRD and MOF should agree on a shared interpretation of the requirement that the BRD seek the minister’s written approval prior to taking any actions that may have a direct fiscal impact, or which have systemic implications;\n\nThe MOF should formulate internal written policies and procedures as to when and how the government stabilization tools might be utilized;\n\nThe MOF should amend the BaSAG to make explicit the power to deviate from pari passu treatment of creditors when using any resolution tool; and\n\nThe MOF should explore the scope for making explicit in legislation that restructuring gains are not taxable.\n\nD. Resolution Planning\n\n48. The SRB and the BRD are responsible for resolution planning. For the 11 banking groups under the SRB’s authority resolution plans are prepared by the SRB IRTs, with substantial support from BRD and OeNB staff.77 These include: (i) eight groups which are (or have) parent entities based in Austria78; and (ii) three subsidiaries of banks based in another BU countries. The BRD prepares the resolution plans for all other groups/banks. Resolution plans prepared by the BRD are submitted routinely to the BSD (and the ECB where relevant) and to the SRB for comment.79 Essential decisions concerning resolution planning are approved by the FMA Board as NRA (e.g., MREL setting—on which see more below). Every six months, the FMA Board is briefed on the progress of resolution planning by the BRD. As resolution planning takes place on an annual cycle, the FMA Board annually reviews and approves an annual and multi-year plan for resolution planning work proposed by the BRD.\n\n49. Resolution planning involves a number of essential components. One such component is to decide upon the preferred resolution strategy (PRS) for each group or bank. The PRS could specify the use of one or more of the resolution tools, or alternatively, the use of bankruptcy proceedings.80 In addition, fallback resolutions strategies need to be identified for the eventuality that the PRS is deemed not feasible at the time of resolution. Another essential component of resolution planning is to decide upon the most suitable approach to the points of resolution action. In most cases the decision is for a single point of entry (a so-called SPE approach) involving a single resolution group, whereas in some cases a multiple point of entry (MPE) approach involving multiple resolution groups (e.g., in different jurisdictions) is deemed more appropriate. Impediments to implementing resolution strategies are also identified as part of the planning process, in the form of formal resolvability assessments—see more below. The ultimate goal of resolution plans is that they be credible81 and feasible.82\n\n50. The BRD, supported by the OeNB, has grouped the banks under its remit into three categories for resolution planning purposes. For the 2019 planning cycle, the first category consists of 16 banks, including most HP-LSIs,83 for which “fully-fledged” resolution plans are prepared. Under EBA guidelines84 these banks are not eligible for simplified obligation and the BRD has determined that the use of bankruptcy proceedings for these banks would jeopardize the objectives of resolution set out in the BaSAG, in particular the maintenance of critical functions and the avoidance of significant adverse effects on the financial system. The second category consists of 12 “deposit-focused” banks, for which the BRD has judged that the use of bankruptcy proceedings may be credible and feasible in the case of idiosyncratic problem, but likely not in a time of broader financial instability or system-wide events. All banks in this category are eligible for simplified obligations, and the BRD produces proportionate resolution plans focusing on the sale-of-business tool as a resolution strategy in times of systemic distress.85 The banks were identified based on an analysis of the volume of their covered deposits in relation to certain estimates of the resources that would be available to the DGSs.86 The final category of banks consists of 404 “harmonized” banks for which use of bankruptcy proceedings is deemed credible and feasible, without putting in jeopardy any resolution objective. These banks receive a standardized resolution plan under which the resolution strategy is use of bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n51. Good progress is being made to agree upon PRSs and approaches to points of entry for those banks/groups likely to subject to resolution. These decisions are taken in close consultation with the groups. For most SIs and banks in the “fully-fledged” category, the PRS is recapitalization via bail-in under an SPE approach.87 For two groups with subsidiaries in multiple neighboring jurisdictions (some of which are significant banks in those jurisdictions), bail-in under an MPE approach involving multiple resolution groups (one per relevant jurisdiction) has been deemed more appropriate.88 These groups are characterized as operating on a relatively decentralized basis across jurisdictions, in part as a result of supervisory requirements imposed upon the groups during and subsequent to the global financial crisis. For two other groups, the PRS is a transfer strategy (using the sale of business tool) under an SPE approach. The determination of fallback resolution strategies for these banks is pending further analysis. For the “deposit-focused” category of banks, the PRS in the context of a systemic crisis envisions use of the sale of business tool with an acquiring institution, and the alternative resolution strategy is a transfer to a bridge institution.\n\n52. While progress has been good, particularly in recognition of the large number of plans that the BRD needs to prepare and update each year, resolution planning remains an ongoing task. The main focus in the 2019 planning cycle is on the plans for the 11 banks under the SRB’s remit and the 16 banks in the “fully-fledged” category. For the SRB banks, resolution plans were prepared starting in 2015 and are undergoing their fourth annual iteration as part of the SRB’s 2018/2019 cycle. Formal resolvability assessments under the PRS for these banks have identified barriers to resolution, though no formal designation of “substantive impediments” to resolution have yet been made (see following paragraphs for details.) The BRD initiated resolution planning for the largest banks in 2016. It created and extended planning to the “fully-fledged” category of banks in 2017. The second iteration of plans was prepared in the 2018 planning cycle. In 2019, the resolution plans for these banks would continue to be further elaborated, especially in terms of a more detailed analysis and specification of the PRSs, further assessment of resolvability under the PRSs, and determining and prioritizing the impediments that need to be addressed. For the “deposit-focused” category of banks, plans were first developed in the 2016 planning cycle and are being finalized, taking into account FMA and SRB comments. In 2019, the focus would be on developing more detailed strategies for being able to execute the PRS (sale of business). Further assessment of resolvability will take place subsequent to this work. The second iteration of the plans for the “harmonized” category of banks has been finalized and is considered largely complete, though some updating will be undertaken in 2019.\n\n53. Based on the PRS for each bank, a Minimum Requirement for Eligible Liabilities (MREL) is determined. The ultimate goal of MREL is to help ensure the existence of adequate loss-absorbing capacity and recapitalization funding to support the implementation of the PRS.89 This is particularly important for those banks where the PRS is bail-in. The process of setting MREL is ongoing and while most banks are already likely to the meet the eventual requirements, some will not, representing an impediment to resolution until their MREL is in place, required by January 1, 2024 at the latest. For banks under the SRB’s remit, binding MREL target at the consolidated group (parent) level and at the solo level for material group entities will be set for the first time in 2019.90 For banks in the “fully-fledged” category, a binding consolidated MREL requirement was set in 2019.91 Requirements for material entities in the groups (solo-level) will likely be set in 2020.92 All banks in the “harmonized” category (where the PRS is bankruptcy proceedings) were informed in the 2017 and 2018 resolution planning cycles that their MREL requirement will equal their capital requirements (including buffers).93 For “deposit-focused” banks, where the PRS is transfer strategy, the BRD likely would set indicative (nonbinding) MREL targets at consolidated group levels in 2019, with binding targets likely to be set in 2020 or 2021. Additional work would be undertaken in 2019 to determine potential subordination requirements associated with MREL, so as to increase the practicality of bail-in as a resolution tool.94 This will involve negotiations with the SRB, whose standard approach to subordination, if applied to central institutions of IPSs and some other banks in Austria, would lead to a requirement to issue substantial volumes of senior nonpreferred debt. The BRD is advocating a more tailored bank-by-bank approach to setting subordination requirements. The BRD should continue its efforts to fully articulate MREL and subordination requirements and strive to ensure all banks meet their MREL requirements as soon as possible.\n\n54. The envisioned MPE approach to bail-in for two Austrian groups gives rise to the need for subsidiaries in neighboring jurisdictions in which a resolution group has been designated to issue MREL into the local market. This may present a challenge to the local NRAs. Given the less-developed state of capital markets in some jurisdictions, there may be limited capacity to issue MREL-eligible debt. Given the small size of some of the banks, issuing into international markets may not be feasible. The SRB and BRD recognize this constraint and are considering assisting relevant local NRAs by providing a transitional period during which required MREL could be held by a group entity in Austria, with an agreed phase-out period during which internally issued MREL would be replaced by MREL instruments issued to third parties. In the meantime, the SRB and the BRD have taken account of potential contagion risks within the group.\n\n55. As noted, impediments to implementing resolution strategies are being identified as part of the resolution planning process, initially for banks under the SRB’s remit and for the fully-fledged banks under the BRD’s remit. Resolvability assessments undertaken for banks under the SRB’s remit95 have identified a number of potential barriers to resolution arising from characteristics of the groups. However, no such barriers have yet been determined to be “substantive impediments,”96 and, therefore, no barriers have been addressed as such thus far.97,98 For banks under the BRD’s remit, barriers also are already being identified, and none have yet been determined to be “substantive impediments.” As the details of strategies are further developed, work to identify impediments will sharpen in focus.\n\n56. Ensuring the ability to provide for adequate liquidity for a bank undergoing resolution remains perhaps the key likely impediment to resolution. Supplemental liquidity funding support beyond the banks own resources may be required prior and subsequent to resolution action, and therefore must be envisioned and prepared for as a contingency. The two last-resort sources of liquidity funding are emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) from the OeNB, particularly in the context of liquidity support prior to pending resolution action, and the Single Resolution Fund. With respect to ELA, notwithstanding the fact the resolution planners cannot assume access to ELA,99 the BRD (and banks) need to be as cognizant as possible of the OeNB’s ELA framework,100 so as to help ensure that a bank in resolution is able to meet the OeNB’s requirements in the event the OeNB Board deems the bank eligible for ELA at the time of resolution. The BRD should pursue discussions with the OeNB in this regard.101 With respect to the SRF as a source of liquidity funding concurrent and subsequent to resolution, the BRD has pursued discussions with the SRB. To date, there are no formal policies or procedures addressing the potential use of the SRF for this purpose. The BRD should continue to engage with the SRB on this matter.\n\n57. The feasibility and credibility of the bail-in tool can be constrained by compensation claims that can arise when departing from pari passu treatment of creditors. In bail-in, the BRD can depart from pari passu treatment of creditors in the same class under certain circumstances.102 Under the creditor hierarchy, uninsured depositors (with the exception of uninsured household and SME depositors) and senior unsecured bondholders rank in the same creditor class. With pari passu treatment in imposing losses in resolution, uninsured depositors would incur the same loss as would senior unsecured bondholders. Alternatively, protecting uninsured depositors but not senior unsecured bondholders would potentially give rise to the valid NCWO claims on the part of bondholders, who may be left worse off in resolution than they would have been had the bank been put into normal insolvency proceedings. NCWO claims must be paid by the SRF and the SRF access criteria give rise to further challenges that must be taken into consideration.103 The MREL subordination requirements cited above are intended to help reduce some of the challenges associated with NCWO risk.\n\n58. The use of a bridge institution can serve as an effective fallback solution where a suitable arrangement with a private-sector acquirer under a sale-of-business transaction cannot be achieved. For example, where the BRD is unable to conclude a private sale within the required timeframe or on acceptable terms, critical functions and related critical shared services could be transferred to a bridge bank or a bridge holding company104 and subsequently sold to the private sector. The SRB adopted a policy on the use of bridge institutions and prepared an operational manual. Following this, the BRD has been developing a national handbook that sets out the concrete steps to be taken when implementing the bridge institution tool in Austria. The BRD has been working with the MOF to agree on an approach to establishing in advance a shell bridge institution, which must address issues such as which entity would own the institution, how its governance would be put in place, and how it would be capitalized and funded. These discussions should be pursued, including with the objective that the government or some other government entity and not the FMA be the owner of a bridge institution.\n\n59. Preparations are also being made to operationalize an AMV to enable use of the asset transfer tool. The BRD initiated preparation of a national handbook and is in discussions with the MOF. As with bridge institutions, the BRD needs to define which entity will own a possible AMV and how its governance structures can be rapidly established in time of need. Here, too, one objective should be that the government, or government entity, and not the FMA be the owner of an AMV.\n\n60. The BRD engages adequately in cross-border cooperation. It does so by means of participation in SRB IRTs as described above, establishment of resolution colleges where it serves as the group-level resolution authority, support to the SRB in colleges for which it is the group-level resolution authority, and support to crisis management groups established for G-SIBs. As the group-level resolution authority, the BRD has established resolution colleges for two banks headquartered in Austria with operations in EU member states outside the banking union. It participates in four colleges for banks for which the SRB is the group-level resolution authority. Via its participation in SRB IRTs, it supports the work of three G-SIB crisis management groups.\n\n61. The BRD is developing a minimum standard for data to support resolution. Working with the BSD and the OeNB, it is developing a data template to readily provide information to support valuations and the implementation of the resolution tools. This should help reduce the potentially lengthy period of time required to implement a resolution decision, such as was experienced in the HETA case with the use of the bail-in tool. This is an important initiative that should be implemented. The intention is to have the minimum standard in place by mid-2020.\n\n62. The FMA needs to have the capacity to evaluate a bank’s financial condition for the purpose of making an FOLTF determination. Responsibility for making this determination falls in the first instance to the BSD (and, ultimately, to the Executive Board as NCA). While the BaSAG envisions that a third-party valuation can be used to support this determination,105 as a practical matter it is essential that the supervisory function is prepared to apply expert supervisory judgement in making this determination and does so well prior to balance sheet insolvency.106 The recommendations of the Technical Note on Banking Supervision, being prepared as part of this FSAP, are relevant in this respect.\n\n63. The FMA and the OeNB have established a Working Group to address the interrelationship between recovery plans and resolution plans. One key goal is to try to identify the consequences of recovery measures that likely would have been taken by a bank prior to an FOLTF determination, and to envision the financial situation of a bank at the time it might have to be resolved. Early work is focused on identifying those recovery measure that, if taken, would most impact resolvability. This important work should continue to be pursued.\n\n64. Summary of recommendations:\n\nThe BRD should continue its efforts to fully articulate MREL and subordination requirements, and strive to ensure all banks meet their MREL requirements as soon as possible;\n\nThe BRD should pursue discussions with the OeNB regarding the provision of ELA;\n\nThe BRD should continue to engage with the SRB regarding policies and procedures relating to potential use of the SRF as a source of liquidity funding in resolution;\n\nThe MOF and the FMA should consider establishing a shell bridge institution and a shell AMV, including with the objective that the government, or some other government entity and not the FMA, be the owner of bridge institutions and AMVs;\n\nThe BRD should continue to develop the minimum standard for data to support resolution;\n\nThe FMA should strengthen supervisory capacity to ensure the ability to make FOLTF determinations well prior to balance sheet insolvency; and\n\nThe BSD and the BRD should continue to pursue their efforts to identify and address the interactions between recovery measures and resolution planning.\n\nF. Deposit Protection\n\n76. The Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (DGSD) created a common EU framework. It introduced harmonized coverage of deposits at €100,000, a requirement for faster payout (seven days), and ex ante and ex post funding arrangements. The DGSD requires that banks’ contributions be risk-based and that each national scheme shall reach a target level of at least 0.8 percent of covered deposits by 2024.\n\n77. There are two deposit guarantee schemes (DGS) in Austria. Under the ESAEG, Einlagensicherung Austria GmbH (ESA) is the so-called “uniform DGS” for Austrian banks that are not members of the second DGS, the Sparkassen-Haftungs GmbH (S-Haftungs). ESA has a statutory mandate to perform the functions set out in the ESAEG. Both DGSs are organized as companies under private law. ESA is the result of the integration on January 1, 2019 of four pre-existing schemes associated with different Austrian banking sectors.118 It is owned by its 500 members.119 S-Haftungs is the DGS of the savings bank sector and is owned by HVG, the steering company in the Sparkassen IPS arrangement.120 It has 49 members. All Austrian banks are covered by one or the other of the two DGSs. The ESA has four executive directors121 and an additional 10 staff members. S-Haftung has two directors and four further staff members. Both DGSs are subject to the FMA’s supervision.\n\n78. The two DGSs offer uniform coverage of deposits at €100,000.122 They cover resident and nonresident depositors in banks licensed in Austria and their branches in the European Union and elsewhere. They do not cover deposits by other banks or investment firms, deposits by collective investment schemes or other investment funds, most deposits by pension and retirement funds,123 deposits of governments, and deposits held in non-EU countries. Covered deposits as of December 31, 2018, were €217 billion. Of these, €173 billion are covered by the ESA and €44 billion are covered by S-Haftungs.\n\n79. The DGSs are authorized to pay out covered deposits upon certain triggering events.124 Deposit payouts would generally be triggered when a court opens bankruptcy proceedings upon a petition filed by the FMA, or when the FMA directs a bank to cease making payments pending the FMA’s filing of a bankruptcy petition.125\n\n80. The DGSs are financed through ex ante contributions and potential extraordinary contributions. Under the ESAEG, ex ante contributions for both DGSs are set at a level so as to achieve the target fund balance of 0.8 percent of covered deposits by July 2024.126 Members of both funds are liable for contingent contributions in any year that amount up to 0.5 percent of their covered deposits.127 The method for determining ex ante contributions and extraordinary contributions were defined by the DGSs based upon guidelines issued by the EBA and were approved by the FMA after having obtained an OeNB opinion. The risk-based and extraordinary contributions are determined on the basis of covered deposits. S-Haftungs has a risk-based contribution framework in place, and the recently established ESA would have one, already approved by the FMA, operational before end-2019. While the government exercised the discretion available in the DGSD that up to 30 percent of ex ante contributions could be made in the form of payment commitments rather than cash, no members of either DGS have made use of this option. The assets of the DGS funds are held in cash in accounts at the OeNB and are thus readily available to fund a payout.\n\n81. Additional resources beyond ex ante and ex post contributions of members are available to both DGSs in the form of the resources of the other fund, and of the proceeds from borrowing. Under the ESAEG, the DGSs have the right to access the funds of the other DGS (including contingent contributions) should the available resources of the fund and the contingent contributions from its members prove insufficient in amount. The two DGSs maintain a joint Working Committee, which meets regularly to discuss issues and procedures, including the potential call by one DGS on the resources of the other.128 Both DGSs have, in addition, the authority to borrow, including from their own members or from third-parties, and both have begun discussions on potential access to borrowings from their members.129 The ESAEG provides that borrowings by the DGSs can be guaranteed by the MOF.130 No ex ante guarantee is in place and the MOF would need to table legislation to provide for it. The MOF believes such legislation could be approved within a matter of days in time of need. Nonetheless, it should consider securing ex ante standing authority to provide a guarantee to either DGS as a contingency.\n\n82. As of January 1, 2019, both DGSs had available resources of nearly 40 percent of their target fund balance. The ESA had a fund balance of €526 million and a target balance of €1.38 billion, while S-Haftungs had a fund balance of €138 million and a target balance of €366.64 million. Both funds could achieve their target balance by drawing on one year’s extraordinary contributions from their members.\n\n83. The DGSs are required to be able to make payouts within seven days. Both DGSs operate web-based platforms that allow covered depositors to specify the bank account into which they want their paid-out deposits to be transferred. Instructions for accessing the platform is sent by registered mail. The DGSs have arrangements with printing offices and the postal service to ensure timely communication to depositors. Those without internet access can take the letter to the local outlet of the failed bank and complete the procedure manually. The DGSs routinely test elements of these processes. Through these means, timely payouts could be achieved.\n\n84. Under the ESAEG, DGSs funds can be used to provide resources to the associated IPS arrangements, but in practice this is unlikely.131 The IPSs resources, including contingent resources from members’ extraordinary contributions, must be depleted before DGS funds can be used in this manner. However, the law sets out numerous conditions and requires numerous consultations, including with the FMA, the OeNB, and the EC, before DGS funds can be used in this manner. Thus, use of the DGSs funds for this purpose is deemed unlikely.\n\n85. As noted in Section C of Part 2 of this note, the DGSs do not have the power to finance the transfer of assets and liabilities in the context of bankruptcy proceedings. In undertaking a P&A transaction, a DGS would transfer covered deposits as well as sound assets to an acquiring bank. It would use DGS resources to compensate for any shortfall in the value of assets relative to covered deposits. Having this power would conserve the cash resources of the fund relative to a payout and would reduce reliance on the bankruptcy estate to recoup outlays. In effect, the DGS would have greater financial capacity and would be less likely to need to call upon extraordinary contributions from members. The DGS would need the operational capacity to affect such transfers and would need to work with the FMA and potential acquiring banks to build internally or outsource this capacity. The ability to undertake P&A transactions would be particularly relevant to the ESA, many of whose members do not benefit from IPS arrangements.132 As recommended in this note, should the ESAEG be amended to provide the ability for DGSs to undertake P&A transactions, the DGSs and the BRD should work together and with potential acquiring banks to develop the operational capacity to execute such transactions. This effort would leverage on the work the BRD already is undertaking to prepare for potential resolution of the deposit-focused group of banks using the sale of business tool.\n\n86. Under the BaSAG, the DGSs have the power and obligation to finance resolution actions in certain cases. In the context of bail-in, the DGSs are liable for the amount by which covered deposits would have been written down to absorb the losses in the bank, had covered deposits been included within the scope of a bail-in and been written down to the same extent as other creditors in the same creditor hierarchy class.133 The DGSs’ liability cannot exceed the net losses that would result under bankruptcy proceedings, and cannot exceed 50 percent of their available funds. Given the operational challenges in determining the actual liability of the DGSs in specific cases, and the cap of the amount of the liability, the BRD does not foresee DGS financing as a practical source funding. Nonetheless, as a contingency, the DGSs should work with the BRD to clarify in writing their interpretations of current law and to formulate relevant policies. An interpretation allowing the DGSs to finance resolution measures up to the amount they otherwise would have paid out to depositors under bankruptcy (rather than their net long-run cost), providing that it is reasonably expected to recover those funds to the same degree as in bankruptcy, would increase resolution funding options.134\n\n87. At present there are no Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) entered into between the FMA and the DGSs. While the FMA and DGSs work together on matters of mutual interest and cooperation between the organizations is reported to be good, there would be value in eventually formalizing cooperation and information-sharing arrangements in the form of a written MOU. This will help ensure that all parties are aware of shared expectations. To fully integrate the DGSs into the financial safety net framework, transforming the DGSs into public sector entities would help enable improved exchange of confidential information and the inclusion of the DGSs in national arrangements for contingency planning and crisis management.\n\n88. Summary of Recommendations:\n\nThe MOF should consider securing ex ante standing authority to provide a guarantee for the borrowings of either DGS;\n\nShould the ESAEG be amended to provide the ability for DGSs to undertake P&A transactions, the DGSs and the BRD should work together and with potential acquiring banks to develop the operational capacity to execute such transactions;\n\nThe DGSs and the BRD should consider working together to clarify their interpretations of current law regarding the amount of funding potentially available from the DGSs to support resolution funding and to formulate relevant policies;\n\nThe FMA and the DGSs should formalize cooperation and information sharing arrangements in the form of an MOU, subject to strong confidentiality arrangements to prevent sensitive bank information being shared with the owners of the DGS; and\n\nConsider transforming the DGSs into public sector entities, to ensure their full integration in crisis management and preparedness arrangements."
