The HYPO Niederösterreich product range

HYPO NOE combines the products awarded the Austrian Ecolabel under its Green Line, thus offering existing and new customers real sustainable added value. In addition to the Green Current Account, there is also the Green Power Account and the Green Time Deposit. With the Green Power Account, deposits are available daily, while the Green Time Deposit has a fixed term and a higher interest rate. The special thing about the green current account is that every month two euros of the account management fee go to one of two sustainable projects - the Noah's Ark fruit collection or the Schönbrunn Zoo's species protection project for polar bears. Deposits in the green power account or the green time deposit are used exclusively to finance projects that can be assigned to Sustainable Development Goals.

Contribution to the SDGs

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 17 goals formulated by the United Nations for the sustainable development of countries. HYPO Niederösterreich's current and fixed-term deposit products, which have now been certified, are aligned with some of these goals. For example, a contribution is to be made to goals 7 (sustainable and modern energy), 9 (resilient infrastructure and sustainable industrialisation), 11 (sustainable cities) and 13 (combating climate change). Financing in these areas actively contributes to the transformation of the economy.
