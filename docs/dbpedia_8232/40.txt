fwp provided advice and support to HYPO NOE Group regarding the upstream merger of HYPO NOE Landesbank AG into HYPO NOE Landesbank für Niederösterreich und Wien AG. The project was successfully completed on 23 September 2017.

fwp assisted in planning the project and provided advice and support regarding the implementation of the complex corporate and regulatory measures involved in the transaction. The objective of the consolidation was to ensure the reintegration of the retail and housing business into Lower Austria’s core bank and, consequently, to increase the banking group’s efficiency by reducing organisational complexity and leveraging operational synergies.

Having advised Austrian credit institutions and insurance companies in connection with reorganisations already in the past, fwp was able to draw on its expertise with the complex interaction of company law and regulatory law. ‘We are pleased that, with our competence in both company law and banking supervision law, we have again been able to successfully advise a long-standing client on such a complex project’, says fwp founding partner Markus Fellner.
