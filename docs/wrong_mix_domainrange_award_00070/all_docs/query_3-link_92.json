        "text": "NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS FROM NEW YORK CITY ------------------------------------ John Pazmino NYSkies Astronomy Inc nyskies@nyskies.org www.nyskies.org 2001 October 22\n\nIntroduction ---------- New York City has long been a fount of Nobel Prize winners almost from the its consolidation from the five boros in 1898. Its first Nobel laureate was Theodore Roosevelt, for the prize in peace in 1906. Since then laureates graced the City with their Nobel Prizes in every decade except the 1920s. 'City' means here any where within the five boros, even tho a person's first allegiance is to the boro more than to the City. I am a Brooklynite, for example. New York maintained the same geographical and political extent for the entire history of the Nobel Prizes. There was no adjustment needed for changes of territory or jurisdiction. The compilation is narrowly focused on the City. The NYSkies turf around New York produced many Nobel Prize winners. A specific search must be made to assemble a list comparable to the one here. The table here is based on a compilation by the NY Times on 2009 May 29. I updated it for omissions and newer laureates. The amendments come from other articles about City winners, lists from various City schools, and biographies of winners. The Times seems to include a laureate if he satisfies at least one of the following criteria:\n\n* born or raised within the City * Graduated from high school or college within the City * Did the Nobel-worthy work within the City\n\nI add a fourth qualification:\n\n* Continued Nobel-related work within the City since the award\n\nA laureate may be claimed by many towns because he may pass thru several towns during his life and career before earning the Nobel Prize. Expect duplicated among laureates from other towns. Here is the text of the Times article. It was written for the dedication of the Nobel Monument at the American Museum of Natural History. This granite pylon stands near the west entrance of the Museum at where 80th St crosses the campus. = = = = = May 29, 2009, 10:13 am New York and Its Nobel Laureates By JENNIFER 8. LEE"
