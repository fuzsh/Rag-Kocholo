        "text": "Robert Hofstadter won the 1961 Nobel prize in physics for his pioneering work in scattering 20 -GeV electrons from nuclei. (a) What is the \\(\\gamma\\) factor for a \\(20-\\mathrm{GeV}\\) electron, where \\(\\gamma=\\left(1-v^{2} / c^{2}\\right)^{-1 / 2} ?\\) What is the momentum of the electron in \\(\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}\\) ? (b) What is the wavelength of a \\(20-\\mathrm{GeV}\\) electron and how does it compare with the size of a nucleus?\n\nShort Answer\n\nExpert verified\n\nThe gamma factor for a 20-GeV electron is approximately infinity. The momentum of the electron is approximately \\(2.73 x 10^{-22} kg \\cdot m / s\\). The wavelength of a 20-GeV electron is \\(2.43 x 10^{-12} m\\), roughly the size of a nucleus.\n\nStep by step solution\n\n01\n\nCalculation of Gamma factor\n\nThe gamma factor \\(\\gamma\\) is given by the relation \\(\\gamma=\\left(1-v^{2} / c^{2}\\right)^{-1 / 2}\\), where 'v' is the velocity of the particle and 'c' is the speed of light. For a 20 GeV electron, since the energy is so high, the electron can be assumed to move at almost the speed of light, i.e., \\(v \\approx c\\). This makes \\(\\gamma \\approx \\left(1-1\\right)^{-1 / 2}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\gamma \\approx \\infty\\)\n\n02\n\nCalculation of Momentum\n\nThe momentum 'p' of a particle is given by the relation \\(p = \\gamma m v\\). Since an electron at 20GeV is highly relativistic (\\(\\gamma \\approx \\infty\\) and \\(v \\approx c\\)), the momentum \\(p = mc\\). The mass of an electron, \\(m = 9.1 x 10^{-31} kg\\), therefore the momentum \\(p = 9.1 x 10^{-31} kg * 3 x 10^{8} m/s = 2.73 x 10^{-22} kg m/s\\)\n\n03\n\nCalculation of De-Broglie Wavelength\n\nThe de-Broglie wave length is given by the equation \\(\\lambda = h / p\\) where \\(h = 6.63 x 10^{-34} Js\\) is the Planck's constant. Substituting \\(p = 2.73 x 10^{-22} kg m/s\\) from step 2, \\(\\lambda = 6.63 x 10^{-34} Js / 2.73 x 10^{-22} kg m/s = 2.43 x 10^{-12} m\\) which is approximately the size of a nucleus.\n\nKey Concepts\n\nThese are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question.\n\nGamma Factor Calculation\n\nThe gamma factor, often denoted as \\(\\gamma\\), is a crucial concept in relativistic physics, used to describe how time, space, and other physical quantities change for an object moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. In simpler terms, it's a measure that reflects the amount of time dilation, length contraction, and mass changes experienced by objects as they approach light speed. The equation for the gamma factor is \\(\\gamma = (1 - v^2 / c^2)^{-1/2}\\), where \\(v\\) is the object's velocity, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately \\(3 \\times 10^8\\) meters per second.\n\nWhen we talk about a 20-GeV electron, we're considering a particle moving extremely fast, so fast that its velocity is almost as quick as light. As a result, the \\(v\\) in the gamma factor equation is approximately equal to \\(c\\), leading to a situation where \\(\\gamma\\) approaches infinity. This mathematical expression implies that at such high energies, relativistic effects are significant, and traditional Newtonian mechanics no longer suffice.\n\nUnderstanding the gamma factor is not only a theoretical exercise but also a prerequisite for many practical applications in physics, including those involving particle accelerators and high-speed astrophysical phenomena. This knowledge also contributes to technology advancements in areas like GPS, where relativistic corrections are needed for accurate positioning.\n\nElectron Momentum in Physics\n\nIn physics, the concept of momentum is integral to understanding the motion and interaction of particles. For a non-relativistic particle, momentum is simply the product of mass and velocity (\\(p = mv\\)). However, as we consider particles moving at speeds close to that of light, such as an electron in a high-energy physics experiment, this definition no longer suffices.\n\nIn the realm of relativistic physics, the momentum of an object is influenced by its velocity as well as the relativistic effects encapsulated in the gamma factor. The relativistic momentum is then given by \\(p = \\gamma mv\\), where \\(m\\) is the rest mass of the particle and \\(\\gamma\\) is the gamma factor calculated from the expression \\(\\gamma = (1 - v^2 / c^2)^{-1/2}\\). For our 20-GeV electron, taking into account its relativistic speed (\\(v\\) approximating \\(c\\)), the momentum can be approximated by \\(p = mc\\), where \\(m\\) is the rest mass of the electron.\n\nIt is important to note that the momentum gained by electrons at these energies is massive compared to their rest mass momentum, leading to significantly shorter wavelengths of their wave-like characteristics, a phenomenon described by the de Broglie hypothesis. Such high-momentum electrons enable scientists to probe the very small scale structures, like the interior of atomic nuclei, contributing to our understanding of the fundamental constituents of matter.\n\nDe-Broglie Wavelength\n\nThe concept of the de-Broglie wavelength bridges the gap between our classical understanding of physics and the quirkier quantum world. Louis de Broglie proposed that particles could exhibit wave-like behavior, with a wavelength inversely proportional to their momentum. Mathematically, it's conveyed as \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is the de-Broglie wavelength, \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, roughly \\(6.63 \\times 10^{-34}\\) joule-seconds, and \\(p\\) is the particle's momentum.\n\nWhen dealing with relativistic electrons, like the 20-GeV electrons mentioned in our exercise, their de-Broglie wavelength is particularly small due to their large momentum. This implies that such electrons can be used in physics to explore structures that are on a similar scale to their wavelengths, such as atomic nuclei, whose size is in the range of femtometers (\\(10^{-15}\\m\\)). The calculation for a 20-GeV electron reveals its de-Broglie wavelength to be approximately \\(2.43 \\times 10^{-12}\\m\\), which, indeed, is comparable to the size of a nucleus.\n\nUnderstanding de-Broglie wavelengths is not just an abstract notion; it has practical implications, including the use of electron microscopy for imaging tiny structures with high resolution. It also plays a central role in quantum mechanics, helping explain phenomena like electron diffraction and the formation of electron orbitals in atoms."
