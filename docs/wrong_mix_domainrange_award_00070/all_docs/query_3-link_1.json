        "text": "According to Alfred Nobel's will, the Nobel Prize in Physics was to go to \"the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics.\" The prize has been awarded every year except for 1916, 1931, 1934, 1940, 1941 and 1942.\n\nHere is the full list of winners:\n\n2023: Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz, and Anne L’Huillier won the 2023 prize for devising a way to generate pulses of light measured in attoseconds — one quintillionth of a second. An attosecond is to a second what a second is to the age of the universe, a miniscule slice of time so short that it can be used to peer at the movements of electrons and molecules.\n\n2022: American physicist John Clauser, French physicist Alain Aspect and Austrian physicist Anton Zeilinger each shared the 2022 prize \"for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science,” according to the Nobel Prize organization. Their work demonstrated that what Einstein so famously dubbed \"spooky action at a distance\" is real and laid the groundwork for early quantum computers.\n\n2021: The 2021 Nobel prize went to three scientists whose work alerted the world to the dangers of climate change. The prize was awarded for \"for groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of complex physical systems.\" Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann shared one-half of the prize \"for the physical modeling of Earth’s climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming\" while Giorgio Parisi won the other half \"for the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales.\"\n\n2020: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2020 was divided amongst a trio of black hole researchers. One half of the award went to Roger Penrose, \"for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity\", while Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez jointly shared the other half \"for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy\"\n\n2019: Canadian-American James Peebles of Princeton University received one-half of the Nobel \"for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology,\" the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. The other half of the prize was awarded jointly to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, \"for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star,\" the Academy said. Mayor is a professor at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, and Queloz is at both the University of Geneva and the University of Cambridge in the U.K.\n\nTogether, the trio won the Nobel \"for contributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth’s place in the cosmos,\" the Academy said.\n\n2018: Arthur Ashkin was awarded one half of the prize, and the other half was awarded jointly to Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou, \"for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics.\" This was the first time in 55 years that a woman was part of the Nobel Prize in physics. [Read more about the 2018 prize and Nobel Laureates]\n\n2017: Half of the 9 million Swedish krona ($1.1 million) award went to Rainer Weiss of MIT. The other half was shared jointly to Barry Barish and Kip Thorne of Caltech. The prize honored the trio's \"decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves,\" according to Nobelprize.org. The three scientists were integral in the first detection of the ripples in space-time called gravitational waves. The waves in this case came from the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion years ago.\n\n2016: One half was awarded to David J. Thouless, of the University of Washington, Seattle, and the other half to F. Duncan M. Haldane, Princeton University, and J. Michael Kosterlitz, Brown University, Providence. Their theoretical discoveries opened the door to a weird world where matter can take on strange states. According to the Nobel Foundation: \"Thanks to their pioneering work, the hunt is now on for new and exotic phases of matter. Many people are hopeful of future applications in both materials science and electronics.\"\n\n2015: Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald for showing the metamorphosis of neutrinos, which revealed that the subatomic particles have mass and opened up a new realm in particle physics.\n\n2014: Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura for their invention of an energy-efficient light source: blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs).\n\n2013: Peter Higgs of the United Kingdom and François Englert of Belgium, two of the scientists who predicted the existence of the Higgs boson nearly 50 years ago. [Related: Higgs Boson Physicists Snag Nobel Prize]\n\n2012: French physicist Serge Haroche and American physicist David Wineland, for their pioneering research in quantum optics.\n\n2011: One half awarded to Saul Perlmutter, the other half jointly to Brian P.
