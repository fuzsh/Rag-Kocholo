        "text": "Profession: Computer Scientist\n\nBiography: Douglas Hofstadter is an American computer scientist best known for his influential book \"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid\" (1979).\n\nHofstadter was born in 1945 in New York City. His father was the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Robert Hofstadter. Douglas studied math at Stanford University and physics at the University of Oregon, where he discovered a famous fractal pattern called \"Hofstadter's butterfly.\"\n\nIn 1979, Hofstadter published his most famous book, \"Gödel, Escher, Bach.\" It won the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award. His 2007 book \"I Am a Strange Loop\" also received critical acclaim and significant accolades.\n\nSince 1988, Hofstadter has been a professor at Indiana University. There he leads a research group studying cognition and analogy-making. Together with Melanie Mitchell, he has made important contributions to computer models of perception and thinking.\n\nHofstadter believes consciousness emerges from complex brain activity involving self-reference or \"strange loops.\" He has also studied language, translated poetry, and made visual art. While interested in artificial intelligence, he is unsure about predictions of a technological singularity.\n\nBorn: February 15, 1945\n\nBirthplace: New York City, USA\n\nAge: 79 years old"
