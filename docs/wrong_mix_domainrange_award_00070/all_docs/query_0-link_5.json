        "text": "Born in 1915 and educated at the City College of New York and Princeton University, Robert Hofstadter left the Princeton faculty in 1950 to join the Stanford Department of Physics at the invitation of Leonard Schiff and Felix Bloch. He arrived at Stanford as the Mark III linear electron accelerator at the High Energy Physics Laboratory was being developed. In this oral history interview, Hofstadter describes some of his early experiments on electron scattering in atomic nuclei, the body of work that demonstrated that the proton and neutron possessed structure and for which Hofstadter was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1961.\n\nDepartment: Physics\n\nProject: Stanford Faculty Oral History Project\n\nInterviewer: Peter Galison\n\nInterview Year: 1985"
