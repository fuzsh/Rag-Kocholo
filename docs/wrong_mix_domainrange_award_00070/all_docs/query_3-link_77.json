        "text": "James Chadwick (born October 20, 1891, Manchester, England—died July 24, 1974, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire) was an English physicist who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1935 for the discovery of the neutron.\n\nChadwick was educated at the University of Manchester, where he worked under Ernest Rutherford and earned a master’s degree in 1913. He then studied under Hans Geiger at the Technische Hochschule, Berlin. When World War I broke out, he was imprisoned in a camp for civilians at Ruhleben. He spent the entire war there but nevertheless was able to accomplish some scientific work.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPhysics and Natural Law\n\nAfter the war ended, Chadwick returned to England to study under Rutherford at the University of Cambridge. He received a doctorate in 1921, and in 1923 he was appointed assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge. There he and Rutherford studied the transmutation of elements by bombarding them with alpha particles and investigated the nature of the atomic nucleus, identifying the proton, the nucleus of the hydrogen atom, as a constituent of the nuclei of other atoms.\n\nAfter the discovery of the proton, physicists had surmised that there were likely additional particles in the atomic nucleus. Elements heavier than hydrogen had a greater atomic mass than their atomic number (the number of protons). Theories for the additional particles included additional protons whose charge was shielded by electrons in the nucleus or an unknown neutral particle. In 1932 French physicists Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie bombarded beryllium with alpha particles and observed that an unknown radiation was released that in turn ejected protons from the nuclei of various substances. The Joliot-Curies hypothesized that this radiation was gamma-rays. Chadwick was convinced that alpha particles did not have enough energy to produce such powerful gamma-rays. He performed the beryllium bombardment experiments himself and interpreted that radiation as being composed of particles of mass approximately equal to that of the proton but without electrical charge—neutrons. That discovery provided a new tool for inducing atomic disintegration, since neutrons, being electrically uncharged, could penetrate undeflected into the atomic nucleus and led to a new model of the atomic nucleus being composed of protons and neutrons.\n\nIn 1935 Chadwick was appointed to a chair in physics at the University of Liverpool. In 1940 he was part of the MAUD Committee, which was to assess the feasibility of the atomic bomb. The committee concluded in 1941 that the 1940 memorandum of Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls was correct and that a critical mass of only about 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of uranium-235 was needed. Chadwick later said he realized “that a nuclear bomb was not only possible, it was inevitable. I had then to take sleeping pills. It was the only remedy.” The MAUD Committee’s results were influential in giving an impetus to the American atomic bomb program. He became head of the British delegation to the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico, U.S., in 1943 and formed a close rapport with its head, Gen. Leslie Groves."
