What should I do?\n\nHow do I change my home address on the portal?\n\nHow do I customize my view on the CUNY portal?\n\nCan I access my college's website through the portal?\n\nWhat browser works best with the CUNY portal?\n\nI wanted to view a PDF file, but I got an error message, what do I do?\n\nWhat is the difference between the CUNY portal and the CUNY website?\n\nThe CUNY Portal is the source of your private and secure information at CUNY (application status, financial aid info, etc...) as well as services that allow you to register for a course, access Blackboard and Degreeworks, and customize your \"My Page\".\n\nThe CUNY website or (cuny.edu) is the source of all public information at C UNY such as academic programs, the CUNY Newswire, admissions information, the library catalog, job postings, links to the college websites, etc..\n\nHow do I register/login on the CUNY portal?\n\nClick Here.\n\nIf you have previously registered on the CUNY portal, type in your Username and Password and click on the Log-in button.\n\nIf you have not registered on the CUNY portal, select the \"Register Now!\" link. A new page will display six categories for registration: student, faculty, staff, applicant, and alumni or visitor. Select the appropriate link. Students, faculty and staff must enter their last name, social security number and birth date in order to validate their connection with the university.\n\nWorried about submitting your social security number to register for our site?\n\nWithin the portal registration process, we ask for your Social Security Number (SSN) once and only once. By design, this number is transmitted to us under the widely recognized https security protocol the one and only time that you supply it, and it is not stored anywhere in the CUNY portal. Well behind the scenes, we use a complex mathematical abstraction process that allows us to verify that the SSN entered for you is correct. To provide further protection, our process is designed so that it is impossible to re-construct the original SSN once it has been sent to us on that single occasion when you register.\n\nI forgot my password and/or username. What should I do?\n\nClick Here. You can then either fill out a form to re-validate your account or have your current password sent to your registered email address.\n\nHow do I change my home address on the portal?\n\nTo change your home address on the portal:\n\n\"student\" - contact your registrar's office.\n\n\"faculty/staff\" - contact your HR department.\n\n\"visitor\" - login and go to your profile.\n\nFor \"applicants\":\n\nIf you have filled out the form with the correct information, you don't have to worry about the information you have in your profile.\n\nIf you have not submitted the form and don't mind filling out another online form, you may register for another \"applicant\" account.\n\nIf you fill out the application form with the wrong information and have submitted it, please contact the admission's office: aonline@mail.cuny.edu or call 212-997- CUNY (2869)\n\nHow do I customize my view on the CUNY portal?\n\nTo create your customized view you must register and login. A new tab will appear in the upper right hand corner. Click on \"My Page\" and select one of the \"edit\" buttons to add or change information.\n\nCan I access my college's website through the portal?\n\nYes. From the college dropdown box, you can select your college's website.\n\nWhat browser works best with the CUNY portal?\n\nThe portal is best viewed using Internet Explorer 5.x or higher, with Java enabled, and a resolution of 800x600 or greater.\n\nI wanted to view a PDF file, but I got an error message, what do I do?\n\nViewing PDF files requires a PDF Reader. Download the free Adobe Acrobat PDF Reader if needed. http://www.adobe.com.\n\nPortal \"My Page\" FAQs\n\n'My Page' on CUNY's Portal\n\nWhen you register with CUNY's portal and login, you are shown a default page ''My Page'' that displays several blank modules: bookmarks, text and tasks. You can edit these default modules, change the modules displayed or move the modules for a different display.\n\nEditing 'My Page' Modules\n\nAt the top right corner of the Bookmark and Text Pad modules are two 'buttons': 'edit' which allows you to the edit the content of the module, and 'x' which closes the module, removing it from 'My Page'. Don't be alarmed if you click on the 'x' by mistake. Although it immediately closes the module and removes it from 'My Page', you can open it again by clicking on the 'Edit Content' link at the top right of the page. All the information you created in the module is still there.\n\nBookmark: You can add any number of your favorite bookmarks here: Apple, CNN, NY Times, you name it! While you can only add three at a time, you can edit the list whenever you wish to add more of your favorite links. And of course you can delete or change these bookmarks at any time. You can also choose to have these links open a new browser window, or use the same window to display your link by clicking the checkbox at the bottom of the module while you are editing its content. When you make changes to your Bookmark module, be sure to click on the Update button at the bottom of the Edit view to save your changes.\n\nText Pad: Write anything you please, a note to yourself, phone numbers, whatever. You can even use simple HTML tags in the text pad. When you make changes to your Text Pad module, be sure to click on the Update button at the bottom of the Edit view to save your changes.\n\nTask List: This list allows you to create a to do list. You may want to use it to list tasks required for applying to CUNY, papers to write, appointments, or plans with friends. It's up to you. The Task List Options link allows you to control how many of your tasks are displayed by default upon login. You may want the default, which shows up to three tasks, and then use the View All link at the bottom of the module to see a complete list of your tasks. Or you can change the default number of tasks shown by clicking on the Options link and changing your preferences. When you make changes to your Task List module, be sure to click on the Save or Save & Update button at the bottom of the Edit view to save your changes.\n\nAdding and Changing Modules and Categories Displayed\n\nCUNY's portal hosts a tremendous amount of information related to your life at CUNY, whether you are a student, faculty or staff. When you click on the Edit Content link at the top right of My Page, you will see numerous categories, each with a list of links: Alumni and Visitors, Colleges and Programs, Current Students, Faculty and Staff and Prosepctive Students. Each of these categories has a number of links you will find helpful. Choose those most relevant to your current status. You can add and change these links at any time. No more roaming around for those critical connections!\n\nArranging the Layout of Modules ' Move Content\n\nMy Page uses the concept of modules for the different items you want displayed on your personalized page. As you add and change the modules on your page, you may want to rearrange the placement of these modules.\n\nClick on the Move Content link at the top right of My Page to move modules and use either of the interfaces to move your modules around:\n\nYou can use the default interface, which shows all modules and their placement on the page. Click the black arrows to move a particular module. Gray arrows indicate you cannot move a module in this direction.\n\nYou can also move items using the Panel-to-Panel Quick Move icon shown next to each module while in the Move Content view. A red dot indicates the current panel location of the module you've selected to move. Click on a panel, top or bottom, to quickly move the module. With this method, you cannot move the module to the middle of a column, use the default interface for that."
