        "text": "Part 1 – May 6, 2021\n\nZierler:\n\nOkay. This is David Zierler, Oral Historian for the American Institute of Physics. It's May 6th, 2021. I'm delighted to be here with Professor David G. Hitlin. Dave, it's great to see you. Thank you for joining me today.\n\nHitlin:\n\nI'm happy to do this. It will be interesting.\n\nZierler:\n\nDave, to start, would you please tell me your current title and institutional affiliation?\n\nHitlin:\n\nI'm Professor of Physics at California Institute of Technology.\n\nZierler:\n\nHow long have you been at Caltech?\n\nHitlin:\n\nSince '79.\n\nZierler:\n\nDave, a question we're all dealing with right now, how has your science been affected one way or the other in this year plus in the pandemic, being away from your colleagues, but also perhaps not commuting, not doing things where you're moving around all the time? In what ways has that given perhaps more bandwidth to work on problems you perhaps might otherwise not have?\n\nHitlin:\n\nWell, it's certainly been different. We've adapted as best we can. There have been protocols put in place about how often we can go into the lab, etc. I haven't been on the campus in more than a year because the older people were just banned. The younger people were allowed to come into the lab one person per so many square feet at a time. So, we've been able to get some work done in the laboratory. Of course, we haven't been able to go to the national labs, to Fermilab or SLAC or the places I would normally go to, and that has an impact. Conferences have turned into Zoom meetings, which sort of works, except that it sometimes means that the interesting talk is at 4 o'clock in the morning, so it's not an ideal situation. All of that will come back to life slowly, and hopefully soon.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd just as a snapshot in time, circa May 2021, what are you working on right now? What's been most compelling to you in recent weeks or months?\n\nHitlin:\n\nWell, I'm involved in two experiments. Well, really, three, but the big experiment we're doing at Fermilab is Mu2e, a search for muon converting into an electron without any compensating neutrinos in the field of an aluminum nucleus. This is a process which is basically forbidden in the Standard Model, but many other theories say we could be on the verge of seeing it, and that would be extremely interesting. So, that takes a fair amount of time. The other thing I've been doing quite a lot lately is we're trying to get approval for LDMX, a new experiment at SLAC to search for dark photons—a type of dark matter that exists in certain theories. I'm the technical coordinator of the experiment, responsible for making sure that we have the right sort of equipment with the right capabilities, and that they all fit together, and that we can afford it, and all this stuff. So, we have been given a small amount of seed money by DOE, and we're in the process now of trying to get the thing approved as a real proposal. So, that's taking quite a lot of time at the moment.\n\nZierler:\n\nIt's been fun in these past few weeks getting everyone's snap judgment on all of this excitement surrounding the g-2 muon anomaly at Fermilab. What's your perspective on this, and what are the chances that we're seeing new physics right now?\n\nHitlin:\n\nWell, we certainly don't have an explanation; what we learned from the new experiment is that the old experiment is right, so in some sense, it isn't news, but it's a very important confirmation. Unless we come up with some difference in one of the inputs to the theoretical calculation, it very likely is new physics, which is great. I don't think anybody really knows what the next step is.\n\nZierler:\n\nJust to go a little more broadly from that, what is your sense more generally in particle physics right now, with regard to the interplay between the guidance that theorists are providing, and where experimentation is based on that guidance?\n\nHitlin:\n\nWell, experimentalists don't just do random things. They do things because there's a theory to tell you to measure something, or that can be proved or disproved. There's always this interplay. It's always been that way since I've been in the field. What's different now is that it takes ten, or fifteen, or twenty years to do an experiment. You can start to design an experiment and get it approved in year one, and then in year twenty, you may have the answer and it may or may not still be pertinent.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd there's half a career right there in those twenty years.\n\nHitlin:\n\nThat’s right. I'll tell you a story. I worked at SLAC as a postdoc in the group of Mel Schwartz, who won the Nobel Prize in 1988 for discovering that there were two neutrinos. He was also my undergraduate advisor at Columbia, and then I was a postdoc in his group at SLAC. He was a very interesting person; he was always thinking about the next thing. The experimental thing that was going on now no longer interested him, even though everybody else in the group was engaged in it; he was on to the next thing. Mel liked to bounce ideas off me, and we actually had, in the corner of my blackboard, a list of things that we would be working on if we were only a little smarter. For example, we really didn't know how to find gravitational waves in 1970, but we knew it was important, so we had it on the list, along with other important questions. This was a conversation we had all the time. It was extremely interesting, and I learned a lot from it.\n\nOne day Mel came into my office, and he said, \"What if you thought of an experiment that was for something really important, but it would take a hundred years to get the answer? Would you do the experiment?\" That was amusing, so we discussed it for a while. My point is, we're actually now there. It doesn't have to be a hundred years; it just has to be a career's worth, or if you're 40, it has to be 25- or 30-years’ worth. And that's what major experiments take now. So, we are in a situation where you can say, \"I'm going to start this experiment, and I may or may not retire before there's an answer.\" But I think the ethos of the field is, well, if it's interesting, you do it. You start it, and you hope you live long enough to get the answer, or somebody else will get the answer. But that was quite a prescient concept that Mel had back in those days.\n\nZierler:\n\nDave, let's take it all the way back to the beginning. Let's start first with your parents. Tell me a little bit about them and where they're from.\n\nHitlin:\n\nMy father, whose name was Maxwell, was born in Brooklyn, and lived in New York his entire life. He had a master's degree in business administration from NYU, but got it during the Depression, in 1932, and never actually worked in that field. His hobby was amateur radio (W2GEN: he was proud of the early call sign), that he pursued his whole life. He managed to turn that into a career. He became an electronic engineer and worked for various electronic companies in the New York area for many years, and always had a little workshop in the basement with things that he would be building. He built our first three television sets. We had a five-inch television, which was interesting because it had electrostatic deflection; The screen was based on an oscilloscope, so it had electrostatic scanning of the raster, as opposed to magnetic scanning, which was the way most TV cathode-ray tubes work. He built that, and then he built a 7-inch version, and then he built an 11-inch one.\n\nSo, we were the first people to have TVs on the block. Kids used to come in to watch all the time. He never got around to putting any of them in cabinets, but they worked fine. My mother was from Louisville, Kentucky. Her name was Martha Lipetz. She had family in New York, so they somehow got together—I don't know exactly how. They were married in 1939, and then lived in New York and Brooklyn. So, that's where I grew up.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhere in Brooklyn?\n\nHitlin:\n\nA couple of places, but the place we lived the longest was in Crown Heights, which was quite close to Ebbets Field, where the Dodgers played when they were in Brooklyn. Perhaps ten blocks from Ebbets Field. I was a Yankee fan, so that was difficult, but I survived.\n\nZierler:\n\nWas Crown Heights mostly a Jewish neighborhood at that point?\n\nHitlin:\n\nLargely, yes, but it changed over time as these things do. So, my parents moved to Queens in the early ‘70s.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhich was probably considered a suburban move to some degree.\n\nHitlin:\n\nWell, not quite. They moved from a house into a condo. They were older, and they felt it was the right thing to do.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat schools did you go to growing up?\n\nHitlin:\n\nIf you're asking me, was it P.S. 57, or something, I don't remember. But I did have a somewhat unusual elementary school career in the following sense. In the 5th grade, I was sent to a school for which I had to take two buses, to a class that was called IGC, Intellectually Gifted Children. I don't think they would dare give a class that title anymore. But it was a very interesting class. It had about 24-25 students, not sitting in rows of desks, but with tables with two students at a table, which is not unusual now but was quite unusual then. The 5th and 6th grade were in the same class. The way it worked was that your time was basically free, except there would be lessons in which the teacher (Mrs. Wallendorf) would present a standard classroom lesson part of the time. Certain things had to go in a certain order; there was a math class for the 5th graders and then one for the 6th, but other things like history, were done together; you may have gotten units in reverse order which didn't really matter. The main point about it is that you were independent, and you had to “fulfill a contract.” Every week you had to turn in a lesson on a given subject, and it was your responsibility to just do it on your own time, whenever, and hand it in. There was a library in the back of the room, and if you wanted to read, you could go back there and read. There was a nature room across the hall with frogs and salamanders and things. I was in charge of the nature room. That was for the 5th and 6th grade.\n\nI then went to Halsey Junior High School, which also required a subway ride, and that had another unusual arrangement in which you did 7th, 8th, and 9th grades in two years. It was not mixed up the way 5th and 6th IGC class was, but you nonetheless did three years' work in two. I then went to Brooklyn Technical High School, which is one of the “elite” schools in New York where you take a test for admission, like Bronx Science, Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech, Music and Art, etc. That was also slightly unusual because I had done the 9th grade in junior high school—9th grade is normally part of high school, but Tech’s rules were that if you'd done the 9th grade in junior high school, then you had to take additional summer classes to make up for things that were part of their curriculum but were not part of the junior high school curriculum, or you could just stay an extra half year. Since I was younger than everybody, having done the three years in two, I just stayed an extra half year.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd that would be January of what year?\n\nHitlin:\n\n'59. Because I didn't go to summer school, I had this extra term to complete. So, I graduated in January, and applied to colleges. My mother insisted that I had to go to college in New York. So, I agreed.\n\nZierler:\n\nWould that include even Harvard? Sometimes I've heard Harvard would be the exception.\n\nHitlin:\n\nNo, that never came up. I didn't apply to Harvard because of that. I applied to Columbia, and I applied to Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. I don't know if that still exists. I think it's subsumed into some other—\n\nZierler:\n\nI believe NYU took it over, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nHitlin:\n\nCould be. I could get in there in February, but to matriculate at Columbia, I would have to wait until September. Brooklyn Polytech offered me full scholarship; they were handing me the whole store. But I decided I would wait and go to Columbia in September.\n\nZierler:\n\nDave, was it specifically physics that you were focused on as you were thinking about undergraduate, or you were still open at that point?\n\nHitlin:\n\nNo, I think I was pretty determined to do physics at that point. I mean, I hadn't—\n\nZierler:\n\nI wonder, also, in 1959, did you sense the impact of Sputnik, that this was creating new opportunities in science generally, and physics particularly?\n\nHitlin:\n\nAbsolutely. Sputnik made an enormous impact. It's hard to overestimate the impact it made on everything. In fact, I took Russian as an undergraduate because that was going to be the coming thing, of course. Before we go on, I'll tell you a story about Brooklyn Polytech. I spent ten years at SLAC, and there were three Nobel Prize winners on the faculty. One of them was Martin Perl, who discovered the tau lepton. One day, we were sitting around a lunch table, and I mentioned what I just told you about having had a choice of going to Brooklyn Polytech or going to Columbia, and I finished by saying that decision made an enormous difference in my life, which is true. And Martin just looked at me and said, \"I went to Brooklyn Polytech.\" So, he put me in my place.\n\nZierler:\n\nObviously, you don't have anything to compare it to, but is your sense that your education in math and the sciences at Brooklyn Tech was a step above what you would have gotten at a P.S.?\n\nHitlin:\n\nYes. Without a doubt. It was a good school. It was an interesting school in the sense that it had origins which I think went back to the '30s that had some relation to the German high school system where they track people into academic and technical areas, where you become a mechanic or technician, instead of going on to a four-year college. It had an aero course, an electrical engineering course, a mechanical course, and also a college preparatory course. Most people took the college preparatory course, but some took these other things; I don't think at that point that this meant they didn't go to college, but it was more of a concentration on technical things, and less on English, humanities and whatever, I suppose.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat were your initial impressions of the department of physics when you got to college?\n\nHitlin:\n\nWell, Columbia was the center of the world in physics at that point. It hasn't been for a while, but it certainly was then. It was great; I had a remarkable time there.\n\nZierler:\n\nWho were some of the luminaries that made you recognize immediately what a special place Columbia physics was?\n\nHitlin:\n\nWell, I remember the first lecture I ever had in freshman physics was taught by Leon Lederman. He wasn't the teacher in the class. That was Bill Havens, who did the rest of the term, but he was out of town that day, so Lederman did the first lecture, which I've never forgotten because he was great. He was funny, he was clear, he held your attention. There was just a feeling that things were going on, important things were happening. I always found that people were approachable. The rest of the students were really terrific. That was actually an adjustment, because I was used to being the best. When I graduated from Brooklyn Tech, I got a whole bunch of medals and awards. When I got to Columbia, it was clear that there were a lot of people who were smarter than I was. Which was fine as far I was concerned. It didn't bother me at all, but it was a different world, the big leagues.\n\nZierler:\n\nTo the extent that, from your vantage point as an undergraduate, hearing what the professors were talking about, what were some of the most exciting things that were happening in physics in the early 1960s?\n\nHitlin:\n\nOne of them was in fact the preparation of the two-neutrino experiment, which ran at Brookhaven in 1962, if I remember correctly. It was being built when I was an undergrad, so we would hear about it. It was a very big experiment at the time. It was the first accelerator neutrino experiment; that was one of its great innovations. Previously, neutrino experiments, of which there had not been many, had used neutrinos from reactors. So, that was interesting and exciting. Chien-Shiung Wu, who eventually became my thesis advisor, was doing an experiment to prove a theorem about the conserved vector current at the time. That turned out to be a very important result. There was just something happening all the time. You had to be interested and plugged in to understand that and to learn about it, but you could. One of the things that was quite important was coffee hour. I did this more when I was a grad student, but as an undergraduate sometimes, there was a coffee hour on the 8th floor of Pupin at 3:30 every day. It was just a big room with some tables and a few chairs and blackboards, and coffee and cookies. And everybody went every day. It was remarkable. All of these people, either who had Nobel Prizes, or were going to receive Nobel Prizes, were standing around talking about physics. It was an education in itself just to be in the room.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat were some of the laboratory experiences as an undergraduate that may have been formative for you?\n\nHitlin:\n\nI didn't do any research as an undergrad. I was working during the summer as a draftsman/illustrator to earn money for tuition. I had a scholarship, but I had to earn the rest of the money. I was able to get a job like that because drafting, at many levels, was part of the curriculum at Brooklyn Tech. We had mechanical drawing, different levels of sophistication, each year. So, I had a skill, and was able to get summer jobs as a draftsman and technical illustrator. For example, when I graduated in January '59 and was not going to be able to get into Columbia until September, I worked as a draftsman for Western Electric, which was the manufacturing arm of AT&T at the time. Their building was on West Street downtown, right near what became the World Trade Center. It was a rather interesting and intricate job because they were in the process of changing over from the old switchgear in their exchanges to new transistor-driven crossbar switches. The revisions had to be done on the fly, making changes without interrupting telephone service.\n\nWe had old drawings from the '20s, which were on vellum. I don't know if you know what vellum is. Modern vellum is paper, but this vellum was sheepskin, which was sized with starch, and then drawn on with India ink. We modified these old drawings to insert the new switchgear, using the old India ink technique. The way you would erase something would be to take a razor blade and scrape the ink off the vellum, and then you would draw the new items with India ink. That was an education; I did that for six months and earned some money too. I didn't do any research as an undergrad. The first time I was in a lab was between my senior year and first year of grad school. I can go back to that, but I decided to go to graduate school at Columbia, so in the summer of 1963 I worked in the lab of Sven Hartmann, who did nuclear magnetic resonance.\n\nZierler:\n\nDave, is this to say that as an undergraduate you were still open between theory and experimentation?\n\nHitlin:\n\nNo. I clearly knew I wanted to be an experimentalist. It's just that I basically didn't have the opportunity in the first couple of years, because I lived at home, and I had to take a long subway ride back and forth every day. As a junior I moved into a small room in an SRO because I needed the time to study, and I didn't have time to do any research in a lab. I worked for Sven Hartmann between senior year and first year of graduate school, which was interesting. The other student working in the lab with me at that time was Norman Christ, who is now a theorist at Columbia. He became a student of T.D. Lee and became a well-known theorist. But he worked in Hartmann’s lab with me, and it turned out he was a complete whiz in electronics. Something I wouldn't have guessed, but he was very good at it and very helpful.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid your mom's rule of staying in New York apply to graduate school also?\n\nHitlin:\n\nNo. I applied to various places—I got into Yale, Wisconsin, and Columbia. I couldn't decide between Yale and Columbia, so I flipped a coin, and it came up Yale, but I decided I wanted to stay at Columbia. And I'm glad I did. The situation was actually kind of interesting. The department always wanted to have a few undergrads stay on for graduate school. When they did the statistics, they found the number who stayed was shrinking. So, in that year they made quite a lot of attractive offers to the Columbia undergrads. You always have to admit more people than come in the end. I know that very well because I've been chairman of the graduate admissions committee at Caltech several times. So, you have to admit twice or three times as many people as are actually going to enroll; it's a bit of a crapshoot. They made a lot of attractive offers to the Columbia undergraduates, and basically all of them decided to stay at Columbia. It was something like ten, maybe a third of the class, which really surprised them.\n\nZierler:\n\nDave, as an undergraduate, did you have a good sense of who you wanted to work with, who would be your graduate advisor had you gone with the decision to stay at Columbia?\n\nHitlin:\n\nNot really. There was an interaction that in retrospect may have something to do with that. I took a nuclear physics course as a senior from Wu, and one of the requirements in the class was to write a term paper. I wasn't sure what to write about, so I discussed it with her, and she suggested that I write a paper about lithium-drifted germanium photon detectors. I was interested in electronics, and this was a hot new thing, so I wrote a paper delving into Ge detectors in some detail. It was actually a pretty good paper. And that was the end of that; it was just something I did in the course. Eventually, I wound up working for Wu, and building germanium lithium-drifted detectors for my thesis experiment. Perhaps she had cleverly set a trap.\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, let the record state, we're only capturing the audio, but the video demonstrates that Dave has the Madam Wu stamp as his Zoom background right now.\n\nHitlin:\n\nYes, that stamp was just issued in February, so it's a good Zoom background for a while.\n\nZierler:\n\nDave, what was Madam Wu like as a person?\n\nHitlin:\n\nInteresting. She had a rather fierce reputation, and over the years, I came to know some of her older students. She was rather demanding of them. They always kept in contact with her, but several of them felt that they had had a harrowing experience. I did not. I had just a wonderful experience with her. She was demanding; that was fine as far as I was concerned. She was a real model of how you do experimental physics. She was in her 50s when I was her student, so she was not in the lab day-to-day tinkering with oscilloscopes and that sort of business, but she was very incisive about what you should do, what you should check, what could be wrong, and very interested in the calculations that had to go into these things.\n\nHer standards were high. If you performed, which at least in my era, everybody in the group did, there were no controversies, and she was great. She was warm, she was friendly, we would go to Chinese restaurants with her, which was an interesting experience because she was a superstar in the Chinese community. It was like Elvis had walked into the restaurant. And there were parties at her apartment once in a while. When we were running experiments at the Nevis cyclotron, we would run in typically two- or three-week intervals, quite intensively, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and she would occasionally come to Nevis and bring us lunch.\n\nZierler:\n\nHow hands-on was she as a mentor? Would you work closely with her, or would it be weekly meetings? How did that play out?\n\nHitlin:\n\nI don't recall anything as formal as weekly meetings, but we had lots of interactions. She wanted to know what was going on. Either there was something that you needed or wanted her advice about, or she would ask you. So probably with weekly frequency or maybe even more than that. My office, on the thirteenth floor of Pupin, was actually an anteroom to her office; you had to go through my office to get to hers, so I met a lot of interesting people.\n\nZierler:\n\nHow closely was your research related to what she was working on at that point?\n\nHitlin:\n\nThis is what she was working on. She had many demands on her time, but she was doing two primary experiments at the time. One was my thesis experiment on muonic X-rays, which we can talk about in more detail. The other was a search for double beta decay in calcium-48, which was a hot topic at the time, and is still a hot topic because it's never been found. I can tell you a little aside about that. The Ca-48 experiment consists of looking for two electrons emitted in a very rare process. This was not my thesis, but other people in the lab right in the next lab from ours were doing this, so we had lots of back and forth about what was going on. The idea was to see whether there was a decay of calcium-48 that produced either a continuous or a monoenergetic electron spectrum. That would be the case depending on whether neutrinos were ordinary or Majorana, whether neutrinos were their own antiparticles.\n\nZierler:\n\nCan you explain that a little more, Majorana as the other option?\n\nHitlin:\n\nA Majorana neutrino is a neutrino that is its own antiparticle, which means if you write a Feynman diagram, you can wind up with a different final state than if the neutrinos are distinct. So, the signature is, again, whether you have monoenergetic electrons or a continuous electron spectrum in the final state. They (Jack Ullmann, Keith Bardin and Peter Gollon) were doing this experiment. They actually didn't finish it until a few years later. Eventually they took the experiment to a salt mine under Lake Erie in Cleveland to reduce cosmic ray backgrounds. There are about ten different isotopes that can undergo double beta decay. Wu had chosen calcium-48 to do the experiment. But there is another possible isotope, germanium-76, which is a major component of stable germanium. One day I was paging through Phys Rev Letters, and there was a paper by Fiorini, from Milan, about a new limit on double beta decay in germanium-76. I wanted to really kick myself because I was the maker of the best germanium detectors in the world, the largest most sensitive detectors. In the next room were the people doing double beta decay with calcium-48. I never made the connection that I could have done, with very little effort, an experiment more sensitive than what Fiorini did.\n\nZierler:\n\nWell, just to be fair, your neighbors didn't make that connection either. It wasn't just you.\n\nHitlin:\n\nYes, but I didn't blame them; I blamed myself. I remember to this day how I kicked myself at the time for not making that simple connection.\n\nZierler:\n\nWe should talk about muonic X-rays at this point.\n\nHitlin:\n\nMuonic X-rays were actually discovered at Columbia, at the Nevis cyclotron, by Val Fitch and James Rainwater in 1952. They were predicted in 1947 by John Wheeler. Both Fitch and Rainwater went on to win Nobel Prizes for other things; Rainwater for a theory paper, which is actually worth noting, and Fitch for the discovery of CP violation in kaon decay. Neither Nobel award had anything to do with muonic X-rays. The case of Rainwater was extremely interesting because the Nobel Prize in 1975 went to Bohr—that's Aage Bohr, Niels Bohr's son—Ben Mottelson, and Jim Rainwater. I would guess that Rainwater was the most surprised person on the planet when he got the Nobel Prize. But the reason is clear if you look in the literature. Bohr and Mottelson made a career out of working on the collective model of deformed nuclei, which was basically an adaptation of Maria Goeppert Mayer's shell model to a deformed potential. A lot of nuclei have permanent quadruple deformations, which determines many of their properties. They wrote two books about this and worked on it for their entire career. That's what the Nobel Prize was for.\n\nHowever, in the early '50s, Aage Bohr was a postdoc at Columbia, and he shared an office with Rainwater. Rainwater wrote a short paper, about a page long. This was before there was Phys Rev Letters; there was Physical Review Comments, which were short letters and comments in each issue of Phys. Rev. Rainwater’s paper said if you took the shell model and put it in a deformed potential, then you could learn a lot of interesting things. He showed a simple example calculation, and that was the end of it. He never did anything else in this area, because he was actually an experimentalist. But he had shared an office with Bohr, so Bohr knew about this. Bohr then took this idea and made a career out of it. The Nobel Prize committee did its homework and decided to give Rainwater a piece of the Nobel Prize, which was, I think, fair. He had the idea, and ideas are what they really give Nobel Prizes for.\n\nZierler:\n\nFor your own research, how did you know you had enough? When were you ready to defend?\n\nHitlin:\n\nMy thesis? That was actually unusual. Let's go on and then I'll get there. The muonic X-rays found by Fitch and Rainwater are gamma rays in the range of, typically, 1 to 6 or 8 MeV. The detector of choice for doing this kind of experiment was thallium-doped sodium iodide, a scintillating crystal; you view the scintillation light with a photomultiplier tube. It was the best way to do these experiments, but its resolution was not very good. If you were looking at something that's a narrow line, because of the poor resolution you saw a gaussian distributed over a large range of energy due to the poor resolution.\n\nWhat was interesting about these germanium lithium-drifted detectors was that even though they were much smaller, they had vastly better resolution, by a factor of 100. The idea then was, and several people decided to do this at roughly the same time, that with germanium detectors you could see the muonic X-ray fine structure, or even the hyperfine structure due to quadruple deformations, and that's what I did my thesis on. Everyone with a cyclotron did this: in Switzerland, in Chicago, in Virginia, but it was first done at Columbia by Sam Devons, who had recently come to Columbia from Manchester. In fact, I'm in the middle of writing an article for the Royal Society. When RS Fellows die, they have an article written about their career. I was asked to write such an article about Sam, because he worked on my thesis experiment. I knew him quite well. Together with some people from Brookhaven he used a small lithium-drifted detector and did an experiment at Nevis on two isotopes of molybdenum and was able to resolve the fine structure and measure the isotope shift. Wu then got interested in doing this and they formed a collaboration. Devons' group, which was just one postdoc and a student, Wu's group, which was larger, and Rainwater. Wu thought it would be politically useful to have Rainwater, the discoverer of muonic X-rays, on the experiment. He didn't do much, but he was interesting to talk to. He lived right near Nevis. He had been a major contributor to the building of the cyclotron and knew everything about its operation. In the middle of the night, 2 o'clock in the morning sometimes, you would see the beam get better. The reason was that Rainwater couldn't sleep, so he would come in, shove the cyclotron operator out of the way and tune up the beam; he could do it better than they could. That was actually his main contribution to the experiment.\n\nIn any case, we had this powerful contingent of Devons, Wu, and Rainwater on the experiment. We embarked on a quite ambitious survey of many isotopes: basically, everything Wu could get her hands on. The way that worked was quite interesting, too. These separated isotopes are produced at Oak Ridge, where there's a repository of separated isotopes. They make them or made them—I don't know if they still do—using what were called calutrons. These were small mass spectrometers, basically miniature cyclotrons, that were originally used to separate uranium isotopes, along with gaseous diffusion, which proved to be a better method in the end. But they kept these calutrons in operation and then used them to separate other isotopes. They built up a store of isotopes which ranged from fractions of a gram to hundreds of grams of various isotopes. You could get neodymium-142, 143, 144, 145, 146—I think there is no 147, 148 and 150, just as an example. And then, tungsten-182, 184, 186; all kinds of separated isotopes. The kicker was that they're horrendously expensive. Most people who needed to use them used milligram amounts, but we needed tens of grams, or hundreds of grams, of each of the isotopes. You couldn't afford to buy these quantities; it would have been literally many millions of dollars. Wu made a deal with Gregory Ragosa, the head of the nuclear physics program office in the DOE, which was the AEC at the time; they would lend us all of the material we needed. They came in standard chemical reagent bottles. We would make a funnel out of filter paper and pour the samples into lucite boxes that we made in the appropriate size and use them as targets for the muons. We would then put them back into the reagent bottles. They would weigh the bottles before and after and they would charge us only for any loss; a small amount might stick to the filter paper, for example. That was the deal, so it cost us only a small amount of money to use this unimaginable wealth of separated isotopes.\n\nThere was an interesting incident along the way. We would take data at the cyclotron for several weeks every several months, making improvements and obtaining new isotopes in between. In the interim we would take the germanium detectors and isotopes back to Columbia. The Nevis cyclotron was in Ardsley, up on the Hudson River, about 25 miles north of the campus. We would drive the detectors and the isotopes back and forth. We kept the isotopes in a small cardboard box. At the start of one run, I had them in the back of my car, and was driving to Nevis when I was stopped by the state police; my car registration had expired. The reason for that was that New York was making a switch between all licenses renewing on January 1, to spacing renewals over a year. Naturally, because of the bureaucracy, or the mail—this was mid-January, or so—my new tag had not arrived. I had a choice of not driving or taking my chances, and I drove. The trooper gave me a ticket, but then wouldn’t let me go on; he impounded the car. They towed it to a garage—I think he had a deal with the garage; a kickback for each car he impounded. I called Nevis and had them send a car to pick me up. I insisted on riding in my car while they towed it, as they wouldn't let me drive; they had to tow it, of course. Nevis sent a car, and we brought the germanium detector and the isotopes to Nevis. It took me about a week to get my car back. That was a close call, but it's one of the vagaries of doing an experiment. We did these experiments for several years, improving the detectors as we went, making them larger, more efficient and with improved resolution.\n\nZierler:\n\nDave, is this a Columbia-only endeavor? Are you in contact with people at other institutions?\n\nHitlin:\n\nIn that experiment, we all were from Columbia. There were often collaborations between institutions, but that experiment was just Columbia. You were asking about my thesis. I did a very unusual thing. We had data, and I had analyzed the data, and I was going to stay a little bit to write things up for publication, so they gave me a job as an instructor, an academic rank below assistant professor; you teach, but there's no tenure at the end of the rainbow. By that time, commercial detectors had outpaced our homemade ones. They were much larger, more efficient, with higher resolution. I decided to go back to Nevis and do all my thesis runs over again with the new detectors. I didn't write my thesis in 1967 as I was supposed to, but I was still an instructor, and I was teaching an introductory physics course in the School of General Studies, Columbia’s night school, which was actually a lot of fun. The students were a quite different group than Columbia College undergraduates. Older, more mature, in some ways more serious. So, I had a good time doing that; the students kept calling me \"Doctor,\" but I wasn't a doctor, because I hadn't filed my thesis. We redid all the experiments, and then I wrote my thesis in 1968. I had done a good job in General Studies, so they asked me to teach the same introductory physics course in the College. That was not nearly as much fun, because the students were, of course, much brighter, but a lot of them were premeds, and they argued for two more points on a homework problem, and that kind of stuff, which I don't have a lot of patience for. So, it wasn't nearly as good an experience as teaching in the School of General Studies.\n\nWe had very nice results and showed the results at several conferences. During these years I had the opportunity to go conferences in Williamsburg, in Ottawa, in Gatlinburg. Wu was generous about having the young people make presentations at conferences, which is something I've never forgotten, and try to do as well. Typically, those are the people that do the hard work, and the ones that need the recognition. We published a whole series of short papers as we went along. Then, we published two comprehensive Phys. Rev. papers, one based on my thesis on the analysis of hyperfine structure in a whole series of deformed nuclei, and a companion paper on work done by my fellow student Eduardo Macagno, on isotope shifts. We took all the data together and analyzed it together; he then did the isotope shifts and I did the deformed nuclei. Eduardo then had an interesting career. He became a biologist and stayed at Columbia. Eventually he became Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and then about a dozen years ago, moved to San Diego where he had an equivalent position. We worked very closely together on our theses and have kept in touch a little bit since then. We did the definitive work in this area; there was some work in the succeeding few years, and then all of the cyclotrons were turned off, so that kind of physics isn’t done much anymore. One unusual thing is that my current experiment, Mu2e at Fermilab, is a search for m to e conversion in the field of aluminum nucleus, basically an aluminum muonic atom. I find that I know things about the details of muonic atoms that the rest of the particle physicists don't actually know much about. So, that's been an unusual turn of the wheel back to the beginning. Okay, so where were we?\n\nZierler:\n\nThe question of when you knew you were ready to defend.\n\nHitlin:\n\nWell, as I said, we had everything done and analyzed, and I could have defended a year earlier than I did, but I wanted the better data. There were a lot of calculations that had to be done. Wu always made sure to have access to the appropriate theorists. When she was doing beta decay, her famous series of experiments on parity, she saw to it that there was a theorist named Morita, from Japan, who was in residence at Columbia, because she knew the importance of the various theoretical calculations that had to be done. When we came to muonic X-rays, she repeated that idea. We had a young theorist, Roger Barrett, who came from the University of Sussex, who did the definitive work on solving the Dirac equation to derive nuclear parameters from muonic X-ray spectra. I used his program in my analysis—I made modifications to it, but basically it was his program, to extract all the nuclear parameters. You start with the measured energies of all the fine and hyperfine structure spectra, then solve the Dirac equation, modifying the nuclear size and shape parameters until you get a fit to the data. Columbia's main central computer at the time, an IBM-7094, a 32-bit machine, couldn’t do these calculations with sufficient precision to get consistent results. There was a CDC-6600 computer, a 64 bit machine, at the Courant Institute at NYU, downtown. Wu arranged to get us some time on that computer. The program was on two boxes of IBM punch cards. You've probably never seen an IBM card.\n\nZierler:\n\nI have not. I've heard about them; I've never seen one.\n\nHitlin:\n\nThey're about that big (indicates size on Zoom) [They are 7 3/8 x 3 ¼ inches]. They have 80 columns of small rectangular holes and were the medium you wrote the programs on. Fortunately, they let you store the boxes of cards at NYU; I didn't have to take them back and forth on the subway. I lived on 75th Street—7½ West 75th Street, which I've always found amusing. I would take the subway to NYU first thing in the morning, submit a bunch of jobs, and come back up to Columbia. In the evening, I would go back to NYU, look at the results, submit some more jobs, and do this each day for a couple of months, until we had all the results. I then wrote this up for my thesis. That was before word processing. It was all done on a typewriter, so when you wanted to change something, it meant retyping a page.\n\nZierler:\n\nOr real cut and paste.\n\nHitlin:\n\nReal cut and paste. I can tell you another little story, which I probably shouldn't.\n\nZierler:\n\nPlease do.\n\nHitlin:\n\nWhen we would write our papers, Wu was very involved in the writing and would sometimes write a first draft, or later rewrite a paragraph. Her written English was not fully colloquial, so I would go over the text and make changes. She didn't like that. So, my solution to that problem was eventually to just edit but not show it to her. That worked; our papers wound up being literate.\n\nZierler:\n\nDave, besides Madam Wu, who else was on your thesis committee?\n\nHitlin:\n\nRainwater, Devons, T.D. Lee—I don't recall the others. Columbia had a complex system of exams after you handed in your thesis. After the thesis was submitted, there was a department oral exam, and then there was a separate “Low Library” oral exam. The departmental oral was given by people from the department, and then the Low Library oral had most of those people and then several others from different departments. That’s not unusual. When I was at Stanford, we had the same system for the equivalent of the Low Library exam, which was kind of fun. They asked you to sign up for what departments you’d like to be the outside members on. I chose things like music and biology and things of that sort. One time I was on a biology exam, and the basis of the experiment they were doing was chromatography, in which you measure the rate chemicals migrate in an electric field to separate the various components of DNA, etc., They don't do it quite that way anymore, but that's what they used to do. I asked the student, “How does the chromatography work?” “If I double the voltage, how much faster does the chromatography happen?” It’s very simple; it’s Stokes’s law. He had no idea, nor did anybody else on the committee, which included two Nobel Prize winners in biology.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you have much direct contact with T.D. Lee?\n\nHitlin:\n\nI had a graduate particle physics course with him. He later wrote a book based on his lectures. The course was marvelous; he was as clear as day. You walked out of the room thinking you knew everything, until you went back and looked at your notes and saw that there was more to it than that. He was a marvelous teacher; the kind of teacher who would write on the board, and turn around and keep talking, while watching to see when people stopped writing, and then he would write some more. He was concerned that you were gathering what he was saying. He was great about that.\n\nHe was, one-on-one, what’s the word? Imperious is probably the word. That didn't really apply to me in any way, but you could see that in his interactions with others. I mean, he was T.D. Lee, a formidable character. I'll tell you something more about the exam situation at Columbia. As I said, there was this oral exam in the department, and then the Low Library oral exam. There was an additional feature of the exam process, which was kind of in flux when I was there. For many years, when you handed in your thesis, you next had to take a written examination on physics, on partial differential equations, on electrodynamics, etc., a really difficult written exam. Then, if you passed, you defended your thesis. Many of the faculty decided that this was out of step with the times, that it was no longer a good idea. They changed the requirement to a requirement to write a series of review papers. I'll tell you something Mel Schwartz told me about this, because he was at the faculty meeting where the decision to make this change was made. I. I. Rabi, the person who created the great Columbia physics department, had already retired. He was emeritus, but he came to faculty meetings. He was very upset at the idea of not having this rigorous written final exam, and apparently, at this meeting, according to Mel, said, \"If you do this, I will have witnessed the end of the physics department I created, and I will never come to another faculty meeting.\"\n\nZierler:\n\nNot to mince words, or anything.\n\nHitlin:\n\nHe never minced words. I knew him a little bit.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhy this reaction?\n\nHitlin:\n\nI don't know. It was the right decision, but it certainly upset him. Mel ended the story by saying \"And he was right.\" I don't think that was true, but it was the way he ended his recitation of the incident. I was in the first cohort that had to write these review articles instead of taking a final exam. The various members of the committee proposed review article topics. I had three articles to write, which was a non-trivial job. It was enlightening, because you go into the literature and read a whole bunch of papers and then write a review article. What I learned from that is that over those last five years or so, I had become a physicist. You could do that. You were thinking hard about just your little thesis problem, but in doing so over the years you had become a physicist.\n\nZierler:\n\nYou're saying it's a slow transformation, and that you don't see it while it's happening, but in a moment like this it dawns on you.\n\nHitlin:\n\nRight. You could just read the literature, understand it, synthesize it. It was a revelation. I can even tell you at this remove what the articles were. Two of them were posed by T. D. Lee. One was to review the status of various conservation laws: parity, charge conjugation, and time reversal in the strong/weak electromagnetic interactions. So, you had to read the literature, find the best experiments, put their limits into some compatible structure, and then make a table. Lee was actually writing a paper about violation of charge conjugation symmetry around that time. The second one was to write about electron scattering. What he meant, I later learned, was to write about the deep inelastic electron scattering experiments that were happening at that point at SLAC, which later earned the Nobel Prize for Taylor, Kendall, and Friedman. But I took it to mean to write about electron scattering determinations of nuclear size properties, which were the equivalent of what I had done using muonic X-rays, which was certainly a possible interpretation. So, I wrote on the wrong thing, but did a perfectly nice job on a relevant topic. It didn't matter; it was just a cross-communication. The third assignment was to write about the cranking model, which was close to what Bohr, Mottelson, and Rainwater would get the Nobel Prize for. So, there were three substantial topics that one had to delve into to write these articles. They then questioned you on all kinds of physics, but with some emphasis on these review articles. I think that was actually an improvement; it was very much better than a written exam on partial differential equations.\n\nZierler:\n\nWell, looking ahead, what postdocs were you considering at this point?\n\nHitlin:\n\nWell, I decided that I wanted to change from nuclear physics to particle physics. The reason, basically, was that in 1968, Wu sent me to a summer study at Los Alamos where they were considering building a new linear proton accelerator called LAMPF. When you want to start a new project, you gather the community and people look at all aspects of a possible program. I went to the summer study, and I worked on it for three weeks. It was interesting and it was fun to spend weeks in the New Mexico high desert. I'd never seen anything like that before. But I came back convinced that there wasn’t a career's worth of interesting science left to do in nuclear physics. And I think I was right. I mean, certainly the field of classical nuclear physics just died, and has now turned into this relativistic heavy ion stuff. I really didn't want to do that. I wanted to go into particle physics.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you see this as, in any way, a handicap? Was there new stuff that you would need to learn, that there was catch-up for you to do that other people who were graduate students in particle physics would not have had to do?\n\nHitlin:\n\nSure. I wasn't worried about that, although it was clearly a concern for potential employers. I mean, the one thing physicists learn is how to learn. I've always said that. But the problem is, how do you get a job? So, I applied to lots of places, labs and universities, and I wasn't getting any positive responses. I got one offer for a nuclear physics job in Israel at the Weizmann Institute, with Gabi Goldring, who had been a collaborator of Sam Devons' at Imperial College. I guess Sam told him I was worth looking at, and he offered me a job. I only met Goldring once, twenty years later, at the home of a mutual friend at the Weizmann.\n\nThat was the only job offer I had, and then one day Wu said, \"How's your job search going?\" And I told her what I just told you. She had a mannerism: when she was thinking about something, or she didn't like something, she would shake her head from side-to-side. She did that, and that was the end of the conversation. A couple of days later, I was on the experiment floor at the cyclotron, which was a very noisy place, because it had motor-generator sets to provide clean power to the cyclotron magnet. The telephone ringer was a big fire bell. So, the fire bell rang, and it was Joe Ballam the Director of Research at SLAC, who said, \"Why don't you come out and give a seminar?\" A couple weeks later I went to SLAC for a seminar and interview. What had happened, I surmise—I don't know, but I surmise—was that Wu was a good friend of Pief Panofsky (W.K.H Panofsky, but known to all as Pief), the director of SLAC. They had known each other at Berkeley in the '30s, and they had remained friends. I'm guessing that she called Pief, and Pief then went to Joe Ballam, who called me.\n\nSo, I went out to SLAC in February 1969. There was a tradition at SLAC, I don't know if they have it anymore, of the brown bag lunchtime seminar in the Orange Room. At SLAC all the seminar rooms were named after colors. The chairs in the Orange Room were orange. The chairs in the Blue Room were blue. The chairs in the Yellow Room were yellow, etc. So, people would munch away at their sandwiches in the Orange Room while you gave your seminar. I talked about muonic X-rays, which was not something that the people at SLAC knew very much about, or probably even cared that much about, but that's what I had to talk about. And then you went around for interviews. They had a rigorous system of interviewing with each of the group leaders—there were groups A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and you would spend about an hour with each of them. Four of those people, if you count Mel Schwartz (who was at Stanford), wound up winning Nobel Prizes. Amazing. Each one was quite different, but extraordinarily interesting. Some of them probed you; some of them just told you what they were doing.\n\nThe interview with Dick Taylor, who did the famous deep inelastic electron scattering experiment, was particularly interesting because one of Wu's students, Luke Mo, who had worked on the conserved vector current experiment, was a postdoc in Taylor's group. One of the things needed to interpret the deep inelastic electron experiment is the radiative corrections for the fact that an electron can radiate a photon, in one part of the reaction or another; you have to make a correction for this. It's a rather complicated correction. So, Luke Mo got together with a theorist at SLAC named Paul Tsai, who died a couple months ago, and they wrote a paper on the radiative corrections to deep inelastic scattering. In so doing, however, they used some of the data before the experiment itself published the data. Dick Taylor was just fit to be tied, and here I was, a Wu student, and he was really pissed off at this other Wu student. So, he spent a good part of the hour complaining about Luke Mo.\n\nNonetheless, in the end, I got two job offers from SLAC. Normally, they would say, \"Group C wants you.\" What happened was, Group A, Dick Taylor, despite his experience with Luke Mo, wanted to offer me a job, and Mel Schwartz also wanted to offer me a job. Mel had been my undergraduate advisor, so he knew me a little bit. Anyway, they both offered me a postdoc. What we decided was that I would come to SLAC, but I would not formally join either group. I would poke around, and then after a couple of weeks or a couple of months, I would decide. So, I found a desk in Mel's group and never left. I pitched into the K0 Spectrometer construction, started doing things, learning things, and just stayed there. The other choice would have been fine, too, but that's where I wound up.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat was your initial work at SLAC?\n\nHitlin:\n\nWhen Mel left Columbia, which was around '66, I think, he went to Stanford, not SLAC, but he had an arrangement by which his research funding would largely come from SLAC. He became the leader of SLAC Group G, but he was a Stanford professor. There was another person with a similar arrangement, David Ritson, also a Stanford professor, who led Group F. These two were sort of second-class citizens at SLAC. They didn't go to SLAC faculty meetings; they went to Stanford faculty meetings. They were adequately funded, but not at the level of the regular SLAC groups. When Mel arrived, he formed a group, with Stan Wojcicki, and did a couple of straightforward experiments. One was to measure the charge asymmetry in the semileptonic KL meson decay, and the other was to measure the two-photon decay of the KL. These experiments were basically done, except for a bit of analysis, when I arrived. They were building the K0 Spectrometer, which had a very large 100D40 dipole magnet to analyze momentum of outgoing particles in kaon decay. After we finished with it, it had a peripatetic life. I think it went to Brookhaven, then it went to Fermilab, where it was used in several experiments. It was a very expensive magnet to run. At current power rates, I doubt if you would even think about it. We built this nice K0 spectrometer, with a bunch of spark chambers to measure the position of particles that were then bent in the magnet, and you measure the position again, and then you got the momentum; and it had an array of scintillation counters that we used to make a trigger. For the first 18 months or so we built the spectrometer. We had a small, but a very good, group of people. Mel's approach to these things was kind of hands-off, because as I told you, since we were actually doing it, that wasn't his primary interest any longer; his primary interest was always the next thing. The first experiment we did was to improve the measurement of the charge asymmetry in Km3 decay. We did a nice job on that.\n\nThere's an interesting sidelight, which involves Jack Steinberger, who was Mel's thesis advisor and who had a related experiment at Brookhaven to measure the same charge asymmetry, but in Ke3 decay—that's p-e-n as opposed to p-m-n. Jack also had another experiment at CERN. He was moving to CERN from Columbia at that point, so he had another similar experiment, which was both a KL and KS beam where he could look at both the long-lived and the short-lived kaons. We were competitors, but friendly competitors. There was a workshop at Brookhaven, it must have been in late '72. We had our results, Jack had his results, a lot of other people had other related results. What was unusual about this was that it was an “informal workshop;” the ground rules were to let it all hang out. Show everything you've got; there'll be no proceedings. There will be no quoting of results, so we can have a fully candid discussion. It was a great idea. So, we showed our results, which were pretty solid. Jack showed his results. He had the Ke3 measurement, which basically agreed with ours, but he had a lot more, because he had the KS beam, so he could measure other things. He could measure the KS lifetime. He could measure the regeneration parameter. And he could measure h+-, that involves the decay of the KL into p+p-. None of his new results agreed with the Particle Data Group values, by a lot. It was just amazing. But Jack Steinberger was Jack Steinberger. So, there was an extremely interesting public conversation between Mel and Jack.\n\nZierler:\n\nYou heard it directly, or you heard it secondhand?\n\nHitlin:\n\nNo, I was there. Mel would ask a really good question, which is what he did, and Jack would just lob it back. And Mel would ask another really sharp question, and Jack had an answer for everything. It was really interesting to watch. In any case, Jack’s results held; they were correct; all the older measured values had to change. The interesting thing was that we were doing a second experiment with the K0 Spectrometer, with a slightly different group. Mel was not a participant. It was a collaboration between some of us at SLAC, and the University of Colorado group of Uriel Nauenberg. The apparatus was similar, but what we were looking for was the decay, KL to p+p--p0, a 3-body decay; we were looking at the asymmetry on the Dalitz plot, which is again related to symmetry violations. We had already taken all the data. I realized after the Brookhaven workshop that we could also measure h+- with this data. h+- is the ratio of two branching ratios involving the KS and KL, but the experiment measures one of them and then divides it by another. So, I went to Bob Messner, the graduate student from Colorado who was doing the Dalitz plot analysis for his thesis. and said, \"Hey, Bob, why don't we try to find the two-pion decay without a p0?\" And he said, \"Oh, I already did that, and I got this really large value. I thought I must have been doing something wrong, so I just put it on the shelf, and I thought I'd get back to it later.\" The answer he got was in fact Jack Steinberger's result.\n\nSo, we plunged in; we went over the analysis very carefully and decided it was right. Then we had a problem; we wanted to publish, but the ground rules of the workshop forbid publication; no referencing of anything that went on at that meeting. We couldn't publish without somehow acknowledging that we had learned about Jack Steinberger’s measurement. The solution was for Mel to call Jack, who said, \"It's okay. We're not ready to publish yet, but just put a footnote in that references a private communication from this workshop, and that would be adequate.\" We did that and we published the new result. The interesting thing is that this was not a subtle effect. The standard PDG value for h+- was 1.96 x 10-3. The value we got was 2.24 x 10-3. And h+- is the square root of the ratio of two branching ratios. This means that the new measured branching ratio was different by more than twenty percent, an unheard-of change. But indeed, when you measured it with a really well understood apparatus, as Jack did and we did, you got a very different answer.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhen did you join the faculty for SLAC? When were you appointed an assistant professor?\n\nHitlin:\n\nThat's complicated. There was a two-step process, and you have to know some background. At Stanford, the forerunners of SLAC were a set of electron linear accelerators at the High Energy Physics Lab (HEPL) on the campus, accelerators that Robert Hofstadter used for his Nobel Prize-winning electron scattering experiments. The largest one (the Mark III) had an energy of 1 GeV. When it was proposed to build the SLAC linac at 18 GeV, it was clear it was too big for a university campus; it needed to be housed in a national lab. There was an excellent site on Stanford land, but the relation of such a laboratory to the university was, as I said, difficult to work out.\n\nAfter SLAC was established, people on campus continued working on linear accelerators, and they wanted to build a superconducting linear accelerator. The advantage of a superconducting accelerator is it can be CW, continuous wave, whereas normal conducting electron accelerators have to be pulsed: the electrons come in a short pulse, and then there's a big gap, and another short pulse. That time structure has a lot of disadvantages. If you can make a superconducting linac, you can do a whole lot of coincidence experiments and things you can't do with a normal-conducting machine. They did some development of superconducting cavities on the campus and got a project started from the National Science Foundation to build a 2 GeV superconducting linac, right on the campus in the same enclosure and hall that they had for the previous linear accelerators years before. So, I started talking to people on campus about making pion and muon beams using the CW electron beam. We knew you could do that; SLAC made plenty of pions and muons at much higher energy. I started looking into whether you could you make intense pion and muon beams of much lower energy, stop them in a target and do muonic X-rays and a lot of other stopped muon experiments or pion experiments. I did some work on that, and actually published a paper in Nuclear Instruments and Methods with an undergraduate at Stanford, named Daryl Dibitonto, about building a superconducting muon channel. It was related to things that people had done for medical purposes to make stopped pion beams for cancer therapy. In fact, something very similar was eventually built at the PSI Laboratory in Switzerland; I actually saw it years later. In any case, this work was sufficiently interesting that Mel worked to get me an Assistant Professor position at Stanford.\n\nZierler:\n\nStanford Physics, not SLAC, you mean.\n\nHitlin:\n\nThe Stanford Physics Department, not SLAC. Very different. I got this job with a rather peculiar proviso, because there was a fight between Bob Hofstadter and Mel about who would control this appointment. In the end they made a compromise: Mel would make the appointment for the first three years, and then that person would be out on his ear, and Hofstadter would get to make the appointment for the ensuing three years. I got the first appointment, and then three years later, Alan Litke got the appointment.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd you knew this, obviously, going in.\n\nHitlin:\n\nI knew it going in. I had other job offers. I had a job offer from Stony Brook; I also had a job offer from Johns Hopkins for an Associate Professor position without tenure.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo, it was tenure track, but in reality, it was a dead end.\n\nHitlin:\n\nThat's right. I've always lived a little dangerously, so I decided I would take my chances. I got the Stanford job, and I worked on the stopping muon experiments. I had an office on campus and was teaching at Stanford, but I spent almost all my time at SLAC, continuing to work on the K0 experiments.\n\nWhen I first walked into the Physics Department, I went to see the chairman, Walter Meyerhof, as one does when you're starting out. Meyerhof handed me a big red manilla envelope, the kind you tie with a shoelace, and said, \"Take this home. Read it tonight. Do not copy it, and bring it back in the morning,\" which I did. In the file were documents on the establishment of SLAC, which was an incredibly controversial subject. I think a lot of people know that. People like Felix Bloch and Hofstadter were very much against establishing SLAC as a national laboratory with a university connection, and people like Sid Drell and Panofsky, both of whom were on the Stanford faculty, were for it. So, there was just a huge fight about how this would work. The sticking point basically was that Panofsky wanted senior people to have the title of Professor, and be part of the faculty senate, and be full members of the Stanford community. That was a very wise decision. It was how he was able to attract all those Nobel Prize winners-to-be. But it was, of course, incredibly controversial. And certainly, in that original generation, there was a lot of sensitivity. I even once heard Bob Hofstadter say, “Those people at SLAC are not professors; they are not allowed to profess.” That is, SLAC faculty did not teach courses on the campus. That changed much later on.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd you think people like Bloch, their concern was that it would dilute the caché of being a physics professor at Stanford?\n\nHitlin:\n\nI don't know what was in his mind. I think they were worried that SLAC was going to become much bigger than the physics department. That SLAC would just overwhelm the physics department. SLAC became quite large, but it never overwhelmed the physics department, which was quite capable of standing on its own and earning its own Nobel Prizes.\n\nZierler:\n\nBut also, SLAC—I mean, this is much later on, but it branched out from physics also.\n\nHitlin:\n\nI'm not sure what you mean.\n\nZierler:\n\nI mean, as SLAC evolved, it took on initiatives that were not strictly physics.\n\nHitlin:\n\nIt was physics, but not high energy physics. That was much later when the local high energy physics accelerator was closed. We'll come to that later, I'm sure. In any case, I read the folder and I learned a lot.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat do you think the chair's intentions were in just giving this to you?\n\nHitlin:\n\nThat I should be informed because I would be dealing with these people, and I should know where they were coming from. That was quite a reasonable thing to do, and very enlightening. At that point, I was the only SLAC postdoc who had become a Stanford faculty member.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat were your responsibilities? How was that worked out from the beginning in terms of how much you would teach, how much you were expected to be doing research at SLAC?\n\nHitlin:\n\nNobody ever gave me direction. I just did my thing. I taught one course each semester, that's standard, and continued whatever research I was doing. Most of the work I was doing was at SLAC. I did more work on the campus HEPL muon channel and a pion channel, but that never came to anything because the superconducting linac never worked. They changed the RF to a higher frequency, using a smaller accelerating cavity, to make the machine less expensive. That was a disastrous decision, because it brought them into a whole new realm of breakdowns and instabilities. They struggled for ten years or so, but they never made an accelerator that worked. They made one small section—I think it was 80 MeV; the original goal was 2 GeV. Years later, NSF closed it down. I designed muon and pion channels that could be built if there was an accelerator, but there was never an accelerator. Most of my research was at SLAC, but I was fully part of the Stanford community, and did my share of committees, arranging seminars and things of this sort. I'll tell you a colloquium story. One of the colloquia I arranged was for Fred Reines, from Irvine, who discovered the neutrino and did a lot of work with reactor neutrinos. I was taking him around to talk to various people, as is the custom. We opened a hallway door, and coming the other way was Joe Weber, who was famous for his gravitational wave antenna bar that claimed to see gravitational waves but didn't. He was visiting Stanford because Bill Fairbanks was working on a superconducting version with squid readout of the aluminum bar antenna. They saw each other, and it was amazing: Hugs all around; \"Freddy!\" \"Joey!\" It turned out that they grew up together in Hoboken.\n\nI can also tell you another story that involves Fred Reines. When weak neutral currents were discovered around '72-'73 in the Gargamelle bubble chamber at CERN, and then later at Fermilab, some of us had the idea that you could use what we knew about nuclear physics to measure something new about weak neutral currents. That is, there is a process called Coulomb excitation, whereby you bring a charged particle, typically a proton or heavy ion, not to collide with a nucleus, but to pass close to it. The passing electric field can excite the nucleus, and you can measure the de-excitation gamma rays. Our idea was if there were weak neutral currents, you could have the analog of Coulomb excitation, where not a photon, but a Z boson was responsible for exciting a nucleus when a neutrino passed by. You could then measure the de-excitation photon. The reason that's interesting was there were certain selection rules involving the quantum numbers of the excited states of these nuclei, so you could learn about the spin and isospin characteristics of the weak neutral current.\n\nWe got two theorists from Stanford, Dirk Walecka and Tom Donnelly, to do some calculations with us, and we figured out how to do these experiments. There were several options. One uses higher energy neutrinos with carbon-12 as a target. Another case, with lower energy reactor neutrinos, was fluorine-19. It turned out that there was a scintillator, barium fluoride, that had been recently discovered. It was similar to the sodium iodide that I mentioned earlier as the first muonic X-ray detectors. Traversing particles produce light, you look at the light with a phototube. The idea was to make a target out of barium fluoride, and then if any of the fluorine atoms were excited by the reactor neutrinos you would see the de-excitation gamma rays. The target and the detector were the same, which is an elegant idea.\n\nI worked all this out in some detail, and I read all of Reines's papers, because he had done the reactor neutrino experiments. And I kept coming to a dead end. No matter which paper I read, there was always something missing. In other words, to get the neutrino flux, which I needed to know to calculate the rate in our experiment, I needed to know how far his detector was from the reactor core and the power of the reactor. No matter which paper I read, there was always something missing. I went over and over it. Finally, I went to Mel, and I said, \"Let's go over this together, and tell me what I'm missing.\" I wasn't missing anything. Mel then called Fred Reines and explained the problem. Fred said, \"Oh, you noticed.\" The problem was that Reines worked at the Savannah River reactor in Georgia. That's a reactor used to produce tritium, and the power of that reactor was therefore classified. His deal with the AEC was that he would never put anything into his paper that would allow one to work backwards to calculate the power of the reactor. That's why I couldn't find it. Reines said, \"Well, if you have a security clearance, I can tell you, but if you don't, I can't.\"\n\nSo, Mel went to Sid Drell. At that time, Panofsky was on leave at CERN working on an early version of the g-2 experiment and Sid was Acting Director, and after a lot of pulling and tugging, he agreed that Mel and I could get security clearance. The reason there was any resistance was the cost, at that time something like $10,000 each to get security clearance. It must be $100,000 now, but it was $10,000 then. The FBI came around and interviewed our colleagues and my neighbors, who told them, \"He comes and goes at strange hours,\" and things like that, which was true. Nonetheless, we got the security clearance. So we went down to Irvine, had lunch with Fred, and he gave us the missing information. That's all we needed to know. We then could fill in the blanks and figure out whether the experiment was viable or not. The answer was that it was marginally viable. It was one of those situations where if anything went wrong, you'd be in the soup. We decided it was too risky to undertake the experiment. So, we just published a paper in Physics Letters on the concept, but we never actually did the experiment. It took about another twenty years before somebody actually did the carbon-12 version of the experiment using the CARMEN accelerator in Britain, and they were able to demonstrate the effect. They didn't cite our paper, which I always found slightly annoying.\n\nThere was another interesting aspect of the original K0 Spectrometer data. One of the features of the beam was that it had a means of ascertaining the momentum of the neutral kaon. That was a very unusual feature. Most kaon beams had an unknown momentum. We took advantage of the very poor time structure of the SLAC beam to have an initial start time when the electron beam hit the target, and produced the KL beam, we got a signal. So, that was a start signal, and then when it came to our apparatus, we had another signal. We could measure that time, and therefore measure the momentum of the kaon. That was very unusual, and it was important. We had a large sample of KL decays that we needed to measure the very small charge asymmetry, of the order of a few time 10-3, and I realized that we had a unique situation. We had measured both decay particles, the pion and the muon. We didn't have the neutrino. But because we knew the momentum of the incoming kaon, which nobody else had, we could do a full kinematic fit. We had an over-constrained situation, so we could place events unambiguously on the Dalitz plot, which nobody else had ever been able to do. The problem was, there had been a whole series of small experiments, some counter experiments, some bubble chamber experiments, that measure the scalar form factor in Km3 decay. All of the experiments had very limited statistics. 10 events, 50 events, things like that. They all had this kinematic ambiguity, so they were not very good experiments. The problem was the answer they were getting was at variance with the hot new theory at the time; current algebra was becoming a dominant approach in field theory. Current algebra made some very definite predictions about the values of these form factors, and the experiments just did not agree with them. I realized that we had a data sample, taken for another purpose, that was hundreds of times larger, and could also resolve the kinematic ambiguity. So, I did that analysis, and I got an answer that agreed with current algebra. Now, that's a very uncomfortable place to be because there's a dozen experiments that don't agree with the theory, and now here's one that does.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhy uncomfortable? Isn't it exciting?\n\nHitlin:\n\nYes, but the question is, are you correct? Other people aren't stupid. Nonetheless, after going over it and over it, I decided I couldn't do any better, so we published it. It was right. It was the dominant experiment in the field for 20-25 years, and it put current algebra on the map. That distinguished me from the herd a little bit.\n\nZierler:\n\nDave, tell me about the E92 experiment.\n\nHitlin:\n\nE92 was based on an idea that I had with Bob Morse from Colorado while we were working together on the kaon to three pion experiment. Bubble chambers had been a big thing in physics, and people built bigger and bigger chambers. But one problem with bubble chambers was that they had no discrimination. You put in a beam, you took a picture, and then you sorted through hundreds of thousands of pictures to look for the few pictures you wanted. There were very ingenious automated devices to help with the scanning, but it was still a very cumbersome process. People were starting to think about triggering bubble chambers. In other words, having equipment surrounding a bubble chamber that gave you information about what had happened, so you would know whether you wanted to take the picture or not. SLAC had a bubble chamber group that ran two big bubble chambers. One was an 82-inch bubble chamber that had originally been built as a 72-inch chamber at Berkeley and was then moved to SLAC because SLAC had higher energy beams than the Berkeley Bevatron. SLAC had also built a 30-inch bubble chamber. There was an electron scattering experiment, done by Elliott Bloom, who at that time was a member of Dick Taylor's Group A, that was a kind of a triggered bubble chamber experiment using the 30-inch bubble chamber. Our idea to do something more sophisticated. The SLAC group was building an experimental 12-inch bubble chamber that was driven electrically, like a loudspeaker, as opposed to the usual hydraulic piston, so it could actually pulse much faster. They had to solve a whole lot of problems because it takes a certain time for bubbles to dissolve, but they thought they could build a bubble chamber that pulsed at a rate as high as 90 hertz. They rarely got up to 90 hertz, but they got close. They had built it originally just as a research project.\n\nSo, I said, \"Why don't we take this chamber and put it in front of the K0 Spectrometer?\" We could then do this E92 experiment with known kaon momenta, which was crucial to what we wanted to do. We had a beam with known kaon momentum, and we had the rest of the apparatus that could measure the outgoing momenta very well, and we had trigger counters. The idea was to put the bubble chamber where there had been a decay space for the KL. We had to build some very unusual multi-wire proportional chambers that were curved. They had wires that ran in only one direction, vertically, in the front and in the back of the bubble chamber volume. These were built at Colorado, and we had to put them inside the vacuum chamber of the bubble chamber, because they had to be as close as possible to the hydrogen volume. They had long cables to take the signals from the chamber out through the vacuum chamber, which made for all kinds of problems: we had intermittent oscillations. You would be running and, all of a sudden, things would go haywire. We never figured out how to solve this, but if you shook the cables the oscillation would stop. And then you would resume the run and the next day it would happen again, and then you'd shake the cables again. That's one of the mysteries of experimental physics, but we got through this, and we did the experiment.\n\nWe didn't get quite the statistics that we hoped to because the rapid-cycling bubble chamber kept breaking down. We didn't quite get the efficiency we expected either. Nonetheless, we did an experiment that dominated the field. The interesting thing was that in the beam next to ours, David Leith's group was doing the same experiment, but untriggered, in the larger 30-inch bubble chamber. So we were in direct competition; we wound up with better statistics, since we could trigger the chamber. We still had to scan the pictures, but the scanning procedure was far less onerous than with a conventional bubble chamber. We got two theses from that experiment. One of them was by Jonathan Dorfan, who was from Irvine. I knew his brother David very well; he was a grad student at Columbia. He then joined Mel Schwartz's group at SLAC and became a professor at UC Santa Cruz. David and I shared my first office at SLAC. His brother joined E92 and we've been friends and colleagues ever since and have worked together a lot. Jonathan eventually became Burt Richter’s successor as SLAC Director.\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, did you know with this essentially dead-end faculty appointment that SLAC was ready to take you on a full-time basis on 1975? Did you have that security in any way?\n\nHitlin:\n\nNo, not at all.\n\nZierler:\n\nWere you on the job market? Did you apply elsewhere?\n\nHitlin:\n\nI went back on the job market. I got an offer from Harvard as an untenured Associate Professor. Harvard was very attractive, but their record of promoting young people was quite poor. I was ready to do that, but one day I walked into Panofsky's office, and I said, \"I have this Harvard offer, but I'd really love to stay here. Is it possible to move from Stanford to SLAC?\" And he said, \"Well, I'll take it up with the faculty.\" So, they had a faculty meeting and they decided yes. No national searches, no nothing. They just decided yes, and I got that job. I just moved over laterally. So, the only real change in my life was that I wasn't teaching anymore.\n\nZierler:\n\nProbably an easy decision, all in all.\n\nHitlin:\n\nI was happy with it.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd was the plan immediately to join Burt Richter's group?\n\nHitlin:\n\nYes. I figured if I was to have any chance of catching on, I needed to be part of a regular SLAC group. That's number one. Number two, in November 1974, there had been the November Resolution.\n\nZierler:\n\nRevolution?\n\nHitlin:\n\nRevolution; the entire world changed. Everything everybody else had been doing was no longer that interesting, and e+e- was interesting.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat was the status of SPEAR at that point?\n\nHitlin:\n\nSPEAR was running. They had—\n\nZierler:\n\nStarting with Mark II?\n\nHitlin:\n\nNo. The so-called Magnetic Detector, which in retrospect is called the Mark I. The Magnetic Detector sparked the revolution by discovering the Ψ. Then Burt thought about building the Mark II. What was really going on at SLAC was preparation for the PEP collider. They wanted to build a larger 30 GeV storage ring, so they had summer studies at Berkeley, because it was a SLAC/LBL project, in '74 and '75, just like that Los Alamos study in '68, to gin up interest in it. SLAC did not have a very good reputation for being accommodating to outsiders. A well-earned reputation, by the way. I remember an example in a neighboring beam line in End Station B. The group was from UC Santa Barbara, Dave Caldwell's group. Sometimes you would be able to get a running time extension if you needed one. Rarely, but you could at least request it if you needed some more time. David Leith, whose nominal beam line this was, had a crane with a big concrete block poised when the beam went off at 8 o'clock, Monday morning. At 8:01, he had this concrete block lifted right into the beam to block it, so that these guys weren't going to get any more time. SLAC was not terribly accommodating to outside people. So, in order to build PEP—you have to understand that SPEAR was never an approved experiment; I think that's well-known. They kept applying to build SPEAR, and DOE kept saying no. So, what they finally did—\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat was the basis for that? What was DOE's objection?\n\nHitlin:\n\nI don't know. Not enough money, or not interesting enough. But Burt Richter had been wanting to build a colliding e+e- beam machine ever since he was at Stanford, where he had worked on colliding electron beams. Electrons colliding with electrons because they couldn't make positrons, but they could at least demonstrate how to make such a machine. He joined the SLAC faculty with the express goal of doing that. He didn't have an apparatus to do it, so he did photoproduction experiments in End Station A for many years while he was trying to get SPEAR built. Eventually what happened was Pief decided to tax each of the groups by some amount to gather a fund to build SPEAR as an experiment. It was never a DOE-approved accelerator project.\n\nZierler:\n\nI did not know that. That's interesting.\n\nHitlin:\n\nThe lab started to work on the approval of PEP before the November Revolution. After the November Revolution, it was clearly going to happen. They knew that they had to be more open to the outside world. So, they had two summer studies, and they formed an outside Scientific Policy Committee which was initially chaired by Karl Strauch of Harvard. And they solicited proposals from the outside community as well as from the SLAC groups, for experiments at PEP. PEP had six interaction regions, so they could have simultaneous experiments. Burt, clever as he was, decided that he would start building an improved version of the Magnetic Detector, the apparatus that became the Mark II, for SPEAR. And then he would say, \"Oh, by the way, we have this new really good detector at SPEAR. Why don't we just move it to PEP? We can just move it down the road?” The other SLAC groups put in proposals and didn't fair very well. Taylor put in a proposal that was turned down. Leith did not because he was building LASS. Burt and Martin Perl did, but they had a detector. Moseley did, it was turned down. Joe Ballam put in a proposal to look for free quarks. It was turned down. Ritson, who was not SLAC, but Stanford, put in the MAC proposal that was approved. So, the SLAC faculty didn't fare very well in the PEP competition. There were some repercussions to that and some things that happened later, but Burt was sitting pretty because he had the Mark II.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat were the considerations with you and Gary Feldman being named co-spokespersons?\n\nHitlin:\n\nGary worked in Martin Perl’s Group E, which collaborated with Richter’s Group C. I should back up and tell you about something that happened with Gary and I at one of those PEP summer studies. In the '74 summer study, this was before the November Revolution, the mystery was that a quality called R, the ratio of the hadronic cross section to the point cross section, was rising with the center mass energy. That wasn't supposed to happen; R was supposed to be flat with energy. Burt (and lots of others) got very excited about that. I remember I was on an airplane with him going down to a conference in Irvine in December '73. This is before I joined his group. Fred Reines used to have little conferences every December. I happened to be on the same plane with Burt, sitting next to him, and he was going on and on about how he had known since he was a graduate student that the electron had a hadronic core, and that was why the cross section was rising. That did not turn out to be the answer, but it was his explanation at the time. So, the problem in the summer of '74 was, why was this ratio rising? I had a really good idea, and I got together with Gary to work it out. The idea was to build a very simple experiment that measured the hadronic cross section entirely calorimetrically. The detector had no magnetic field and no tracker. It just measured the total energy produced in each collision. This energy is completely characteristic. If it's a beam gas interaction, it's half the energy. If it's a cosmic ray, it's even smaller. If it's a Bhabha scattering event, it's smaller and localized. If it's what you're looking for, hadronic final states, it's the highest energy deposition in the calorimeter. So, you could build this simple apparatus, using 12\"x12\" box girders, fill them with steel plates coated with Teflon, add liquid scintillator, put phototubes on the ends, and pile them up like logs around the interaction region. And in a very short time, you would have a definitive answer, another totally independent method to measure the hadronic annihilation cross section. Gary and I put this in as a SPEAR proposal, and a lot of other people put in proposals, too. As you can imagine, by the time this was going on, it was a hot topic at SLAC. There was a proposal from LBL to improve the Magnetic Detector by building the Lead Glass Wall. That was, to take away one side of the MD that had electromagnetic shower counters that didn't work very well—that's a long story which I'll come back to later—and replace them with lead glass counters to measure photons very well. There was a proposal from Elliott Bloom to do the Crystal Palace, which eventually evolved into the Crystal Ball experiment. There was an experiment from Wisconsin to measure weak-electromagnetic interference in di-muon production. These were a whole bunch of heavy hitters, and then there was Gary and me. The night before the meeting, I got a phone call from Joe Ballam asking me to withdraw our proposal. Not because it was bad, but because the situation was too complicated.\n\nZierler:\n\nThat's how he explained it to you.\n\nHitlin:\n\nYes, it was a very good idea. But it was two small fry in a big pond with these big whales, and they couldn't approve us and disappoint the big players. So, rather than turn it down, he asked me to withdraw it.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat was your response?\n\nHitlin:\n\nI withdrew it. I had plenty of other things to do, but I was certainly disappointed because it was a good idea and would have solved the problem. But it would have gotten on the air after the Ψ had been discovered, which answered the question: the rising R ratio was due to Ψ and charm production, so nobody would have cared.\n\nBack to your question. Gary and I were two assistant professors in the Mark II group, along with Harvey Lynch and Roy Schwitters. The way Burt parsed things out was that the day-to-day operations of the experiment were in the hands of the younger people. So, he gave us the opportunity to be the spokesmen of the experiment. There was no doubt that Burt was the boss even though we were the spokesmen, but that was okay.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd where does Mark III enter the picture?\n\nHitlin:\n\nLet's do Mark II before we do Mark III.\n\nThe Mark I detector was a very forward-looking device. It was the first large 4p detector, and it did great physics. But there were parts where it didn't work very well, in particular the electromagnetic shower counters, which were the responsibility of Berkeley. They used alternating levels of lead and plastic scintillator, viewed by phototubes. As they were building them, they cleaned the plastic with KimWipes, basically tissues, except those tissues have glass fibers embedded in them for strength. This produced microscopic scratches on the plastic scintillator, such that the decay length of the light became very short. If light was produced in the middle, it was very greatly reduced by the time it reached the photodetector on the end. So, there wasn't very much light out of these things, and they performed poorly. That was the motivation for doing the Lead Glass Wall, to take off a side of the MD and put in good photon detection.\n\nNow Burt was going to build the Mark II, the bigger, better detector for SPEAR, but really for PEP. I joined Burt’s group right about when people were thinking about getting started on this. So, I looked around for someplace where I could contribute, and I became aware of a new type of detector that was being built at CERN by a group led by Bill Willis. He was at Yale, then went to CERN, then to Columbia. The accelerator they were using was the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) at that time, and he had built a lead-liquid argon detector, which covered only an octant. It had radiators of lead, but the sensitive material was not plastic scintillator. It was cryogenic liquid argon. This detector worked really well; it was a good idea. The device they made was really just jerry-rigged. It didn't have any good insulation when it was brought down to 79 degrees Kelvin; it was just covered with blue Styrofoam. The Styrofoam would crack because of the expansion and contraction with temperature cycling. So, the detector had icicles hanging from it, but it worked. I mentioned this to Burt as an interesting idea for Mark II. He said, \"Get on a plane, go to CERN, and learn about it.\"\n\nSo, literally, the next week I went to CERN. Bill was very helpful. They showed me everything about it. I went into enormous detail about all the circuitry for the electronics, and all the ins and outs of what you need to do to keep the argon clean, etc. When I came back, I was very enthusiastic about it, I made a preliminary design, and I ran into some opposition. Not for the design, but for the fact that the Berkeley guys were the shower counter guys. That was their domain, and here I was poaching on it. We fought that out and made an arrangement where we would do a good fraction of the work at Berkeley and some fraction of the work at SLAC, but I would be the system leader. That worked fine. We had our differences, but it worked out nicely, and it produced something quite good; we built this large device that performed fabulously. We had to build a prototype, of course, to prove to people we knew what we were doing. At SLAC we built a cubic foot scale prototype using my design. The LBL people decided they needed their own design, so they made another version. We designed them so that both would fit into the same cryogenic apparatus. We would put one in, run, take it out, and put the other one in, running with the same electronics but a different mechanical design. Mine worked a lot better than theirs, so we adopted that design, and we built it.\n\nAnother aside there. I got in real trouble with Panofsky over the prototype. We had a very small group of people, and we were working day and night for weeks in this beam test. We had a very strong cobalt-60 gamma source that we could put beside the dewar to see a signal when there was no beam, just to tune things up. This source had a radioactivity label on it; we kept it in a lead container on the floor against the wall in the area. When the run was over, and we were completely exhausted, we all just went home and went to sleep. One of the janitors found this bright shiny object, which was not in the lead container, and put it in his pocket. He then, after a few hours, thought maybe that wasn't a good idea, and he turned it in. So, I was called on the carpet by Panofsky for letting a radioactive source get out into the wild, and really raked over the coals. That's the only time he ever did that, but I deserved it.\n\nWe then built the full liquid argon calorimeter and put it in the beam. It worked right away. I had bought a bottle of champagne that I put in the kitchen in the control room at SPEAR with a tag on it that said, \"Open when we see a Bhabha peak,”—that is when we could see a full electron peak in the detector. We ran overnight, and at 10 o'clock the next morning, I was drinking champagne, because we could see the peak that quickly. That's how well it worked. It really was good. It was a workhorse. It was used at SPEAR, it then went to PEP intact and worked there, and finally it went to the SLC. For a long time, it held the record for the best energy resolution for a sampling electromagnetic calorimeter in the Particle Data Group review. I think somebody's done better now, but that's 30 years later, so it was very successful. So that was the Mark II, and now we’re up to the Mark III.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd a decision that you faced at this point.\n\nHitlin:\n\nYes, I had a decision to make. What happened was that Jasper Kirkby, a guy I knew very well because he had also been in Mel's group, put in a proposal. He had already had an experiment called DELCO at SPEAR. DELCO sacrificed other capabilities to have good electron recognition, as a strategy to find charm using the high pT electron signature. He had put in a similar proposal for PEP, with Taylor, which was turned down. So, he revised it, and put it in again for SPEAR. They wanted to build a new version of DELCO at SPEAR. I saw the proposal, and remarked to Burt, \"This doesn't really look like the right thing to do at SPEAR going forward.\" If you're going to run SPEAR, you need to emphasize exclusive state reconstruction. That is, you needed to have a large solid angle and the capability of good tracking of charge particles, good energy resolution for electromagnetic radiation, good particle ID. All the things the Mark II had, except it couldn’t be as Cadillac as the Mark II. I said, \"I think there's a way that this can be done much cheaper and still do as good a job. This is the direction to go, not another DELCO-type experiment.\" Burt read Jasper’s proposal, thought about it, and said, \"Why don't you put in a proposal?\" It was just me and my idea; it wasn't going to involve anybody in Burt's group, because they were all getting ready for PEP. So, I involved another group at SLAC, Bob Mosley's Group D, which had built a streamer chamber facility that had done some good physics but was kind of at the end of their string of being able to do interesting physics with it.\n\nSo, I made common cause with Group D physicists, and we put together the Mark III proposal. There then had to be a comparative evaluation of the two proposals. The SLAC faculty had been so disappointed at what happened with their proposals for PEP, that they had no taste for taking this in front of a program committee. Pief decided this was an internal matter for SPEAR and gave it to the faculty, which then had several meetings. They took a detailed look. I still have a couple of pages of very detailed calculations of momentum resolution that Burt did to evaluate the relative qualities of the two experiments. They decided that Mark III was the way to go. The difficulty was—remember that the DELCO proposal just came out of the blue—there was already a plan to turn off SPEAR for high energy physics. The deal that Panofsky had made with DOE was that when PEP came on, SPEAR hep would be turned off. So, keeping SPEAR running for Mark III was a big problem. The synchrotron radiation group was already preparing to take over. They had run parasitically at SPEAR for several years. The deal that Panofsky had made was to turn off SPEAR for high energy physics to give it full time to synchrotron radiation, and then use those funds for operating PEP. So, he went back to DOE and negotiated a new deal: SPEAR would run half-time for high energy physics and half-time for synchrotron radiation, and they could also run parasitically for synchrotron radiation when we were running for high energy physics as before. So, they basically could run year-round, and we could only run half a year. That was a good deal, and Pief made that happen. The synchrotron radiation folks kept complaining when they were running parasitically, because they always wanted to run at the highest possible energy, and for us, that wasn't where the interesting physics was. But we had control of the beam energy, so they ran, and they did some physics, although they thought they could do better. But they had to wait until it was their turn to control the beam energy.\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, when do you start thinking about the move to Caltech?\n\nHitlin:\n\nWell, that happened when I didn't get tenure at SLAC. I was a little surprised about that given that I had just had this important experiment approved, and I never got what I would call a satisfactory answer as to what happened, but it happened. I believe they thought they could retain me with a Permanent Staff, rather than a faculty, position. I didn’t go for that, so I hit the market. I got two job offers. One was the University of Washington, which was now a collaborator on Mark III, and that was a tenure offer. The other was Caltech, which was not a collaborator, and it was not a tenure offer. But I looked at the two places and I decided Caltech was a better fit for me. So, that's where I went.\n\nZierler:\n\nWas it easier or more feasible at Caltech to maintain your work on Mark III?\n\nHitlin:\n\nPerhaps it was a little easier, but I don't think it would have made much difference. The way I handled it for many years, starting in '79 and basically going on until PEP II was turned off in 2008—that entire time, 29 years, religiously on Thursday morning I went to SLAC; if I caught a 6:00 AM plane, I could be there at 8:30 or 9:00. And either on Friday afternoon or Saturda"
