There are 165 Jews listed as opposed to 6 from the Arab side.\n\nNobel prize is propaganda. Its because jews control the media/govt/banking/schools inside white countries. A certain german leader told us this, but hollywood is controlled by jews (movie: hollywoodisim) and they had their white slaves bomb them (for the UK who sold us and palestine out in the balfour declaration). Judisim is a racial suprmacist organization. Its an organization based upon their DNA and their supremacy and their bible/talmud/torah clearly lay out a plan for world domination that is being enacted today as they steal palestine to turn it into bible baloney land Israel and their final temple thru hundreds of years of mass slaughter.\n\nPretty much all religions have a nutty as fuck endgame\n\nSingling out Judaism's retardism alone is intellectually dishonest.\n\nThis is not meant as a form of collective bragging or a comparison of which culture is more advanced.\n\nFrom a pool of 1.4 BILLION Muslims which are 20% of the world's population (2 out of every 10 people)\n\nFrom a pool of 12 million Jews which are 0.2% of the World's Population (2 out of every 1,000 people)\n\nAfter reviewing this list, can you supply a reason for the large discrepancy between the Arab/Islamic population's contribution to the world body and that of the Jew? There are 165 Jews listed as opposed to 6 from the Arab side.\n\nWhy don't you do a comparison between skin colour for your encore?\n\nOh and cite your copy and paste next time you plagiarizing little bigot\n\nhttp://www.jewishmag.com/99mag/nobel/nobel.htm\n\nPretty much all religions have a nutty as fuck endgame\n\nSingling out Judaism's retardism alone is intellectually dishonest.\n\nNo . I said jews control america. Its got nothing to do with \"religion\". Judisim requires a DNA test to be a pure jew and get let inside israel. jews I know are satanists by religion. They are jews by blood. Judisim is a racial supremacist organization. not one that defends jews, one that perscribes to enslave all the non jews (whites, palestinians, germans; everyone).\n\nBuddhists, satanists, christains etc dont control the deceptive hollywood media. Im not singling out that the 2% of jews are 50% of oligarchs in america and 85% of the media and behind 90% of the wars and 110% behind the cover up of the 911 commission and the banning of free speech in america by banning pressTV worldwide and the jews who run google (and facebook) clearly edit this media too. They singled themselves out. I found them by wondering \"who the scum is controlling our media\" and after decades of blaming evil whitey for stealing oil from muslims, I learned thats racist jews who runt hat media really staling israel for their racial cult.\n\nYour original post and obvious hatred of the people jews want to steal land from showed me you are probably one of them so I dont expect you to agree with facts. Jews cant take over nation after nation if they lived on facts. They can take them over by inventing Nobel propaganda prizes and taking over the govt/media/banks and inventing words like \"racism\" and \"multiculturisim\" and ONLY applying them to nations they are taking over and not their own (aka the nation they have stolen the most of at the current time frame in history).\n\nIn fact i only found this page because i was looking up one of those \"iranian\" winners. Who is a total jewslave who got a \"peace prize\" but crusades to ban pressTV who tries to tell the world that jews control the media and they are bombing gaza for 100 years and staging terror on america. {Shirin Ebadi }"
