        "text": "Albert Michelson was the first American to win a Nobel Prize in science. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1907 for the invention of his eponymous interferometer and for its development as a precision tool for metrology. On board ship traveling to Sweden from London to receive his medal, he was insulted by the British author Rudyard Kipling (that year’s Nobel Laureate in literature) who quipped that America was filled with ignorant masses who wouldn’t amount to anything.\n\nNotwithstanding Kipling’s prediction, across the following century, Americans were awarded 96 Nobel prizes in physics. The next closest nationalities were Germany with 28, the United Kingdom with 25 and France with 18. These are ratios of 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1. Why was the United States so dominant, and why was Rudyard Kipling so wrong?\n\nAt the same time that American scientists were garnering the lion’s share of Nobel prizes in physics in the 20th century, the American real (inflation-adjusted) gross-domestic-product (GDP) grew from 60 billion dollars to 20 trillion dollars, making up about a third of the world-wide GDP, even though it has only about 5% of the world population. So once again, why was the United States so dominant across the last century? What factors contributed to this success?\n\nThe answers are complicated, with many contributing factors and lots of shades of gray. But two factors stand out that grew hand-in-hand over the century; these are:\n\n1) The striking rise of American elite universities, and\n\n2) The significant gain in the US brain trust through immigration\n\nAlbert Michelson is a case in point.\n\nThe Firestorms of Albert Michelson\n\nAlbert Abraham Michelson was, to some, an undesirable immigrant, born poor in Poland to a Jewish family who made the arduous journey through the Panama Canal in the second wave of 49ers swarming over the California gold country. Michelson grew up in the Wild West, first in the rough town of Murphy’s Camp in California, in foothills of the Sierras. After his father’s supply store went up in flames, they moved to Virginia City, Nevada. His younger brother Charlie lived by the gun (after Michelson had left home), providing meat and protection for supply trains during the Apache wars in the Southwest. This was America in the raw.\n\nYet Michelson was a prodigy. He outgrew the meager educational possibilities in the mining towns, so his family scraped together enough money to send him to a school in San Francisco, where he excelled. Later, in Virginia City, an academic competition was held for a special appointment to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, and Michelson tied for first place, but the appointment went to the other student who was the son of a Civil War Vet.\n\nWith the support of the local Jewish community, Michelson took a train to Washington DC (traveling on the newly-completed Transcontinental Railway, passing over the spot where a golden spike had been driven one month prior into a railroad tie made of Californian laurel) to make his case directly. He met with President Grant at the White House, but all the slots at Annapolis had been filled. Undaunted, Michelson camped out for three days in the waiting room of the office of an Annapolis Admiral, who finally relented and allowed Michelson to take the entrance exam. Still, there was no place for him at the Academy.\n\nDiscouraged, Michelson bought a ticket and boarded the train for home. One can only imagine his shock when he heard his name called out by a someone walking down the car aisle. It was a courier from the White House. Michelson met again with Grant, who made an extraordinary extra appointment for Michelson at Annapolis; the Admiral had made his case for him. With no time to return home, he was on board ship for his first training cruise within a week, returning a month later to start classes.\n\nYears later, as Michelson prepared, with Edmund Morley, to perform the most sensitive test ever made of the motion of the Earth, using his recently-invented “Michelson Interferometer”, the building with his lab went up in flames, just like his father’s goods store had done years before. This was a trying time for Michelson. His first marriage was on the rocks, and he had just recovered from having a nervous breakdown (his wife at one point tried to have him committed to an insane asylum from where patients rarely ever returned). Yet with Morley’s help, they completed the measurement.\n\nTo Michelson’s dismay, the exquisite experiment with the finest sensitivity—that should have detected a large deviation of the fringes depending on the orientation of the interferometer relative to the motion of the Earth through space—gave a null result. They published their findings, anyway, as one more puzzle in the question of the speed of light, little knowing how profound this “Michelson-Morley” experiment would be in the history of modern physics and the subsequent development of the relativity theory of Albert Einstein (another immigrant).\n\nPutting the disappointing null result behind him, Michelson next turned his ultra-sensitive interferometer to the problem of replacing the platinum meter-bar standard in Paris with a new standard that was much more fundamental—wavelengths of light. This work, unlike his null result, led to practical success for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907 (not for his null result with Morley).\n\nMichelson’s Nobel Prize in physics in 1907 did not immediately open the floodgates. Sixteen years passed before the next Nobel in physics went to an American (Robert Millikan). But after 1936 (as many exiles from fascism in Europe immigrated to the US) Americans were regularly among the prize winners.\n\nList of American Nobel Prizes in Physics\n\n* (I) designates an immigrant.\n\n1907 Albert Michelson (I) Optical precision instruments and metrology\n\n1923 Robert Millikan Elementary charge and photoelectric effect\n\n1927 Arthur Compton The Compton effect\n\n1936 Carl David Anderson Discovery of the positron\n\n1937 Clinton Davisson Diffraction of electrons by crystals\n\n1939 Ernest Lawrence Invention of the cyclotron\n\n1943 Otto Stern (I) Magnetic moment of the proton\n\n1944 Isidor Isaac Rabi (I) Magnetic properties of atomic nuclei\n\n1946 Percy Bridgman High pressure physics\n\n1952 E.

After traveling to Stockholm to receive the award, he did not return to Italy, but went to the US to protect his Jewish wife from the new race laws enacted by the nationalist government of Italy. There are many additional Nobel prize winners not on this list (like Albert Einstein) who received the Nobel Prize while in their own country but who then came to the US to teach at US institutions.)\n\nImmigration and Elite Universities\n\nA look at the data behind the previous list tells a striking story: 1) Nearly all of the American Nobel Prizes in physics were awarded for work performed at elite American universities; 2) Roughly a third of the prizes went to immigrants. And for those prize winners who were not immigrants themselves, many were taught by, or studied under, immigrant professors at those elite universities.\n\nElite universities are not just the source of Nobel Prizes, but are engines of the economy. The Tech Sector may contribute only 10% of the US GDP, but 85% of our GDP is attributed to “innovation”, much of coming out of our universities. Our “inventive” economy is driving the American standard of living and keeps us competitive in the worldwide market.\n\nToday, elite universities, as well as immigration, are under attack by forces who want to make America great again. Legislatures in some states have passed laws restricting how those universities hire and teach, and more states are following suite. Some new state laws restrict where Chinese-born professors, who are teaching and conducting research at American universities, can or cannot buy houses. And some members of Congress recently ambushed the leaders of a few of our most elite universities (who failed spectacularly to use common sense), using the excuse of a non-academic issue to turn universities into a metaphor for the supposed evils of elitism.\n\nBut the forces seeking to make America great again may be undermining the very thing that made America great in the first place.\n\nThey want to cook the goose, but they are overlooking the golden eggs.\n\nWhen I arrived at Bell Labs in 1988 on a postdoctoral appointment to work with Alastair Glass in the Department of Optical materials, the office I shared with Don Olsen was next door to the mysterious office of Art Ashkin. Art was a legend in the corridors in a place of many legends. Bell Labs in the late 80’s, even after the famous divestiture of AT&T into the Baby Bells, was a place of mythic proportions. At the Holmdel site in New Jersey, the home of the laser physics branch of Bell Labs, the lunch table was a who’s who of laser science. Chuck Shank, Daniel Chemla, Wayne Knox, Linn Mollenauer. A new idea would be floated at lunchtime, and the resulting Phys Rev Letter would be submitted within the month…that was the speed of research at Bell Labs. If you needed expertise, or hit a snag in an experiment, the World’s expert on almost anything was just down a hallway to help solve it.\n\nBell Labs in the late 80’s, even after the famous divestiture of AT&T into the Baby Bells, was a place of mythic proportions.\n\nOne of the key differences I have noted about the Bell Labs at that time, that set it apart from any other research organization I have experienced, whether at national labs like Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, or at universities, was the genuine awe in people’s voices as they spoke about the work of their colleagues. This was the tone as people talked about Steven Chu, recently departed from Bell Labs for Stanford, and especially Art Ashkin.\n\nArt Ashkin had been at Bell Labs for nearly 40 years when I arrived. He was a man of many talents, delving into topics as diverse as the photorefractive effect (which I had been hired to pursue in new directions), nonlinear optics in fibers (one of the chief interests of Holmdel in those days of exponential growth of fiber telecom) and second harmonic generation. But his main scientific impact had been in the field of optical trapping.\n\nOptical trapping uses focused laser fields to generate minute forces on minute targets. If multiple lasers are directed in opposing directions, a small optical trap is formed. This could be applied to atoms, which was used by Chu for atom trapping and cooling, and even to small particles like individual biological cells. In this context, the trapping phenomenon was known as “optical tweezers”, because by moving the laser beams, the small targets could be moved about just as if they were being held by small tweezers.\n\nIn the late 80’s Steven Chu was on the rise as one of the leaders in the field of optical physics, receiving many prestigious awards for his applications of optical traps, while many felt that Art was being passed over. This feeling intensified when Chu received the Nobel Prize in 1997 for optical trapping (shared with Cohen-Tannoudji and Phillips) but Art did not. Several Nobel Prizes in laser physics later, and most felt that Art’s chances were over … until this morning, Oct. 2, 2018, when it was announced that Art, now age 96, was finally receiving the Nobel Prize.\n\nAround the same time that Art and Steve were developing optical traps at Bell Labs using optical gradients to generate forces on atoms and particles, Gerard Mourou and Donna Strickland in the optics department at the University of Rochester discovered that optical gradients in nonlinear crystals could trap focused beams of light inside a laser cavity, causing a stable pulsing effect called Kerr-lens modelocking. The optical pulses in lasers like the Ti:Sapphire laser had ultrafast durations around 100 femtoseconds with extremely stable repetition rates. These pulse trains were the time-domain equivalent of optical combs in the frequency domain (for which Hall and Hansch received the Nobel Prize for physics in 2005). Before Kerr-lens modelocking, it took great skill with very nasty dye lasers to get femtosecond pulses in a laboratory. But by the early 90’s, anyone who wanted femtosecond pulses could get them easily just by buying a femtosecond modelocked laser kit from Mourou’s company, Clark-MXR. These types of lasers moved into ophthalmology and laser eye surgery, becoming one of the most common and most valuable commercial lasers.\n\nDonna Strickland and Gerard Mourou shared the 2018 Nobel Prize with Art Ashkin on laser trapping, complementing the trapping of material particles by light gradients with the trapping of light beams themselves."
