Glad Tidings We Bring, designed by Laura Konyndyk for Blank Quilting, is a whimsical Christmas collection. Bunnies with bows, mice carrying presents and mice with candy canes surround the Christmas tree. Snowmen in top hats and scarves make winter look warm. Reindeer play in the freshly fallen snow as pinecones fall from trees nearby. Santa Claus will be here soon bearing presents for all. Bring the heart of winter into your home when you make a project with Glad Tidings We Bring.
