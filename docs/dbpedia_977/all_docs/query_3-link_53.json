        "text": "Protest Christmas Cards, highlighting political, industrial and social turmoil, have been produced since the mid nineteenth century. This book contains images from the collection of Llew and Pam Smith. They researched and collected such cards over a 40-year timespan. Llew Smith, who was formerly MP for Blaenau Gwent, together with his late wife Pam, has written an accompanying history of the struggles represented in the cards. The issues cover a 160-year time period – from the early days of the industrial revolution to the current coalition government and the Occupy movement. The Christmas card with the themes of peace, goodwill, justice and hope were seen as an appropriate medium for individuals and groups to project similar aspirations. The cards portray the words and deeds of the brave, who, in the face of injustice, refused to remain silent and accept that nothing could be done. As Martha Gelhorn wrote: ‘An old and unending worldwide company, the men and women of conscience. Some are as famous as Tom Paine …some are unknown…There have always been such people and always will be. If they win, it is slowly; but they never entirely lose. To my mind, they are the blessed proof of the dignity of man.’"
