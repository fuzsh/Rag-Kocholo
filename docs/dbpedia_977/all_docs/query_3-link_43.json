        "text": "December 30, 2021\n\nI'm not sure I've ever read a book like this one - twenty-five short, flash fiction stories that all relate to the Christmas story. I knew I enjoyed Angie Thompson's writing (I was fully convinced after reading A Threat and a Promise), but I wasn't expecting every single one of these little stories to be so moving!\n\nI loved the way Angie creatively approached each of the \"prompts\" (words that connect to the Christmas story). The stories were all set in different eras and included all different types and ages of characters. Just the sheer amount of creative work was so amazing! And then when we get down to the themes of each of these little stories ... each one was so profound, touching the reader so deeply. Was every story deep and complex? No, but the simplicity added to the sweetness. I absolutely loved this book, and it truly pointed to the real reason for Christmas - the birth of a Savior Who came to save lost sinners like me and you. This book serves as a perfect Advent calendar, but I wouldn't mind reading it at any time of the year. These truths relate to all time, not just at Christmas. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's looking for sweet Christmas stories or anyone who enjoys beautiful little stories with truth-filled themes!\n\nDisclosure: I received this book free from the publisher/author. The opinions I have expressed are my own, and I was not required to write a positive review. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255.\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n5+ stars & 8/10 hearts. Every other story, or just about, had me in tears. My heart. Angie Thompson crafted a simply gorgeous flash fiction advent calendar. Each story is about 1 minute to 3 minutes’ reading (probably about 1,000 to 2,000 words). I was blown away by how she managed to make real, living characters, fascinating stetting, gripping plot, and amazing messages in such a small amount of words. How can I pick a favourite? Perhaps it is the “swaddling clothes” one… <33 But really, it’s simply amazing and beautiful and so, so hopeful, and I recommend it with all my heart!\n\nA Favourite Quote: “Nobody here expects you to see the good in Mom being gone. Not for a long time. Maybe not ever. But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing left to be thankful for. You’d give up all the best parts of your life right now to have her back, I know. But Joey, would you give her up—everything she was and everything she meant to you—if it meant you didn’t have this pain?”\n\nJosie was still for three long breaths, then she shook her head slowly.\n\n“Then praise God for that, Josie. Praise Him for all the wonderful memories He gave. you. Praise Him for all the things you’re going to miss most about her. Praise Him that it only hurts so bad because she loved you so much.”\n\n*I received a copy of this book from the author but I was not required to write a review. These are my honest thoughts and opinions.*\n\nDecember 12, 2022\n\nREREAD: Just as amazing, moving, and meaningful as the first time! I can't recommend this enough. All-Booked Book Reviews: https://youtu.be/Khlo5LCIVXU\n\nFirst read of 2022 and I couldn't be more pleased :)\n\nNormally I would review each story individually but since they are so short and I would be constantly repeating myself with phrases such as \"a real tear-jerker\" or \"highly impressed\", I'm going to sum them all up into one review.\n\nDespite being an advent calendar, Glad Tidings is not and should not be limited to just the Christmas season. Do all the stories take place during this time and is there a general Christmassy feel to each one? Yes, but the messages are tried and true year-round. The Gospel is shared, God is glorified, and childlike faith shines in just about every story. Real life issues are brought to the surface such as grief, sickness, loneliness, pride... and each of them are told and dealt with in such a way that made me either grin from ear to ear or set me on the verge of tears.\n\nMy only regret was that I didn't read a story a day. I wish I had been able to.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this book. It truly amazes me how powerful and meaningful this was, despite the length. Some stories were only three pages long! I highly recommend this to anyone who needs an inspiring pick-me-up. You won't regret it. I'll definitely be on the lookout for more by this author.\n\nDecember 26, 2022\n\n2022\n\nRead it again this year and loved it. As I did before.\n\nThis book is so full of hope, glad tidings, touching scenes, and wonderful characters. I know I'll be reading all of these stories over and over. Some of them made me smile. Others had me reading through tears. While I love the stories, they are very short, and I often wished the story would go on and I could find out what happened next. I think I'd like at least a novella of each one. But at the same time they were the right length.\n\nThis book would be perfect for an advent read, or if you would rather, read them all at once.\n\nAugust 18, 2021\n\nThis book was an absolute joy to read. Each story is filled with emotion, hope, and truth and several times I was moved nearly to the point of tears. I love how each story points to God and celebrates the birth of His son yet isn’t what I would call too preachy. They’re each perfectly done to remind us of the reason for the season and I can’t wait to read these to my family come December as we count down to days till Christmas, if I can keep myself from choking up as I read that is.\n\n**I received a complimentary copy from the author in hopes of an honest review. I was not obligated to leave a positive review. Thoughts and opinions expressed are mine alone.\n\nAugust 15, 2021\n\n~I'd like to thank the author for sending me a free copy in exchange for my honest review!~\n\nThis was such a sweet collection of stories. Each of them had an underlying message, that you don't need all the gizmos and gadgets to have a great Christmas. All you need is Jesus and a joyful, cheerful heart.\n\nIt's a bit more difficult to review this book. With this being flash fiction, you get to know 25 story worlds instead of one. That being said, at times it was a tad confusing, since, in a way, it felt like I read the first chapter of 25 books, so it would totally be better to read it over 25 days, not a couple of hours lol.\n\nI liked how the stories were all short, sweet, and this is totally an Advent calendar I'll be using around Christmas!\n\nRecommend for all my bookish friends looking for a Christmas-y read!\n\n~Full Review To Come~\n\nDecember 23, 2022\n\nThis was a really fun collection and idea. A short story for each day leading up to Christmas. Some were better than others, but all of them were well-written and held wonderful truth.\n\nApril 24, 2021\n\nThis... was lovely.\n\nAngie Thompson has a way of writing that gets me. It's heartwarming and tender and real. Each time I opened up my little pdf to read another couple of chapters, it was like a breath of fresh air. The stories are all wonderfully meaningful without being preachy, with little glimpses of the greater story of Christ woven in like golden bits of thread. I found myself savoring every one of these bite-sized pieces, all unique, yet also... familiar.\n\nI don't think I can choose a favorite, they were all so wonderful! But maybe I can settle for some honorable mentions, in no particular order: \"Flock\", \"Glad Tidings\", \"Wise Men\", \"King\", \"Ponder\", and \"Jerusalem\" all touched my heart in a special way. Stories have power, my friend, I'm sure you know that already. This lovely Advent calendar dusts off well-known and well-worn scenarios and adds a quaint, fresh touch to each one. Poignant and beautifully written. Glad Tidings is a book I'm happy to recommend.\n\nDecember 26, 2023\n\nSweet and simple, heartwarming and hopeful, honest and truthful. (Especially 18 and 19.)\n\nJuly 23, 2021\n\nThis book was very enjoyable. It’s not often that I read a book of short stories, but I truly enjoyed this one.\n\nMost of the stories had a very obvious Christmasy feeling to them, but there were a couple that didn’t feel quite so Christmasy. In general, all of the stories were very short – only 2-4 pages each. While most of the stories were able to conclude satisfactorily within those few pages, there were a number of stories that I wish had gone on at least a bit longer. I guess I just wanted to learn more about the characters. 😊\n\nI loved being able to read a quick story even if I only had a few minutes free. It was nice reading something that didn’t require me to read it through in one sitting.\n\nI give this book 4 stars and recommend it to all readers of all ages – especially if they love a good Christmas read.\n\nTo read my longer review, check out my blog post:\n\nGlad Tidings Review Post\n\nDecember 25, 2021\n\nLOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH!! Every story is so beautifully written, full of meaningful moments, and timeless truths. Several had me almost crying! My favorites (all of them, lol!) in this collection were: Lineage, Stable, Manger, Star, Wiseman, and Ponder.\n\nDecember 29, 2023\n\nThese short stories are such heart-grabbers! In just a few words, the author not only sets the scene but gets us into the hearts, heads, and shoes of relatable, life-like characters. Christmas spirit permeates this book, and so many angles are touched upon in this story: Christmas in a poor family, Christmas in hospitals, working on Christmas, tender moments between family members, Christmas through the eyes of children, Christian with the elderly, Christmas festive and Christmas bleak, Christmas historical and Christmas modern, Christmas in fields and Christmas in feasts. Hope, love, joy, peace, and purpose shine from these pages. Don’t miss this collection!\n\nJuly 21, 2021\n\nAwwwww\n\nWho wouldn't love this book; these stories! Christmas stories!!!\n\nTwenty five amazing, grace, love, compassion, second chances filled stories with all the heart-touching flair that comes with Christmas.\n\nEach story with a theme was a breath of fresh and new beginnings. I loved how story they were but the message strong and inspiring.\n\nI can imagine myself reading these stories each day in December to my kids before Christmas.\n\nI received a copy of this book and this is my honest opinion.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 28, 2021\n\n*I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review. A positive review was not required.*\n\nThis book contains 25 little worlds that will each draw you in instantly. There is one story meant for each day, but if you’re like me, you’ll love the first one so much that you’ll just keep reading.\n\nThe only thing I would have liked differently is the length. In a few short sentences I had grown to love a character, only for it to disappear out of my world once again a page or so later. At times, I also felt like I was missing just a little context. The short length does make it an ideal read if you don’t have a ton of time, though.\n\nThis is the kind of book where you want to savour each paragraph, but at the same time want to see what the next story is. “Glad Tidings” is an Advent calendar that you will enjoy for many years.\n\nFavourite quote: “Maybe our family name isn’t enough to wipe away your past, but you said it yourself. Blood tells. Are you going to stand here and tell me that Jesus’ blood isn’t strong enough to keep you from the wrong that might be in yours?”\n\nDecember 25, 2021\n\nParables for Christmas\n\nWonderful examples and lessons leading up to Christmas. The stories were inspiring. There were times when I wanted the chapters to keep going. I am planning on making this a yearly advent read. I am thinking about re-reading this before Easter as well.\n\nApril 19, 2023\n\nCollection of sweet flash fiction! I love how Angie switched writing styles for each story. Most of the stories and characters never really pulled me in, however. But I appreciated how each story was complete on its own.\n\nContent - no objectionable content"
