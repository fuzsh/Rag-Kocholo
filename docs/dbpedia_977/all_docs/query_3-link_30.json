        "text": "Happy Tuesday and welcome to the first week of October. Good grief.\n\nFall is my Absolute Favorite time of year. When spring arrives, I wonder if my favorite time of year is spring, but when autumn arrives, I have no doubt it’s my Absolute Favorite. I love autumn!\n\nAs the year winds down, I usually start looking towards stitching for fall and then stitching for Christmas.\n\nSadly, I didn’t concoct a new autumn project this year. For autumn stitching, though, if you’ve been hanging around with me for a while, you’ve probably seen my Festive Fall (as a pre-transferred towel set and as an instructional e-book, with patterns) and the Autumn Variety pre-transferred towel set that’s also available.\n\nAnd there’s the Leafy Tree project – available as an e-book now, and coming out as a kit again soon.\n\nOver the past many years, I’ve also released new projects for Christmas – the Twelve Trees for Christmas (I loved working on those!), the Snowflake Ornaments (twelve of those, too), and last year’s Mini Sampler Stockings, which will be re-released this year as an improved kit. (We talked about that here last week.)\n\nLast year, I released a couple Christmas towel sets – Christmas Cheer and Let it Snow – as well as this stamped cross stitch Vinterfolk set.\n\nPreviously, and still very popular, the Holly & Evergreen set came out a few years back, and the Folky Flakes set a couple years ago.\n\nWhat’s New This Year?\n\nThis year, I’m releasing the third and final set that go along with last year’s sets, called Glad Tidings.\n\nI’m almost finished with the sample stitching and the sets are in production this week right here in the kitchen of my the studio! Yay!\n\nWhy do I make these towel sets?\n\nBecause, in my mind, they are a wonderful way to indulge in the relaxation of embroidery. I know many folks want to embroider, but they don’t necessarily want the stress or challenge of a strenuous, meticulous project. They are an embroidery escape, in a sense.\n\nSure, I love a challenging embroidery project. But I also love to be able to kick back and stitch pretty much without thinking about what I’m doing.\n\nThis is the kind of stitching that allows the mind to contemplate other things. To indulge in a good audio book. To watch a favorite movie. To engage in friendly conversation.\n\nIt’s the kind of stitching you can take anywhere. Outdoors on a picnic. In the car on a road trip. In an airplane. On a train. In a bus on your commute. To appointments. To a football game. (The lights in a football stadium are great for stitching!)\n\nThe designs can be stitched as intricately or as simply as you want.\n\nYou can pick your own favorite color schemes.\n\nYou can pick your own stitches.\n\nYou can use thread from your stash. Or you can have the fun of buying new threads!\n\nYou don’t have the bother of transferring the designs. You can follow your own rules. You can stitch slowly. You can stitch fast. You can keep them. Or they make great gifts. (I use the samples I stitch up as gift wrap around Christmas time.)\n\nRight now, for me, stitching up the samples has been the Ideal Undertaking. My eyes aren’t great at the moment, but as they heal, I’ve been able to do this type of stitching without a problem. While I’ve had to lay aside more intricate projects, these have been quite a lovely escape during what would otherwise have been a stitch-less couple months.\n\nSo, yes. Glad Tidings! This three-towel set exclaims three Christmas messages: Glad Tidings, Peace on Earth, and Joy to the World!\n\nThey feature some Christmas greenery, a beautiful handwritten text, angels, and a dove. If you enjoyed stitching the Christmas Cheer and Let it Snow designs from last year, these are along the same lines, design-wise.\n\nThe plan is to have them ready for you next week, because I know many of you like to get ahead on Christmas stitching if you can. Once they’re ready, I’ll announce them here on the website (and in the email newsletter for subscribers – you can subscribe here if you’re not subscribed), and I’ll also include in the announcement the color list and stitches that I used on my sample towels in case you want a springboard for stitching your own.\n\nWith chilly nights coming on and the days getting shorter, what’s better than a relaxing embroidery project to sink into at the end of the day?\n\nEmbroidery project, cup of cocoa, favorite audiobook…\n\n*Sigh*\n\nThe perfect escape!\n\nI’m looking forward to sharing them with you!"
