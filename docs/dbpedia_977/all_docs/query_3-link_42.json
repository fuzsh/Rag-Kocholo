        "text": "Handel was a composer and theo­logian, first and foremost, of the Cross. That may sound a strange claim, given that his only setting of the Passion is one of the least inspired of his works, and that Messiah, one of the most inspired, is more associated in our minds with Christmas and Easter than with Good Friday. (It is Bach who has almost a monopoly there.)\n\nThe sheer confidence of his music may also sit uneasily with such a statement. As the Cana­dian poet Elizabeth Smart puts it: “Sometimes Handel is loud, triumphant, insistent. I wanted to say Shut up! Can anything really be that successful and sure?” (from “A Musical Note”).\n\nYet the themes to which he keeps returning are truths that are anchored in the failure and uncertainty of the Cross, as befits a Lutheran.\n\nFirst, Handel proclaims (because the Cross reveals) the messiness of history as the theatre of divine action. In an age when Deism was forcing God out of history and restricting him to the act of creation and to personal experi­ence, Handel chose to focus on the (sometimes perplexing) ways in which God was at work in history: Israel in Egypt, Saul, Solomon, Bel­shazzar, Judas Maccabaeus.\n\nFor Handel, as for the Orthodox theologian John Zizioulas: “History is a real bearer of the ultimate, of the very life of God” (Being As Communion, SVS Press, 1985).\n\nSecond, he points to the person of Christ as the fulfilment of that history, the focal point of God’s work in human time and space. Many contemporary theologians were attacking the whole concept of Christ as the fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy: Jennens’s text of Messiah confronts that head-on.\n\nJesus is God returning at last to his people after the exile. Jesus is the glory of the Lord that all flesh shall see, and that is risen upon us. Jesus is the Son that the Virgin conceived — Emmanuel, God with us. He is the One who will feed his flock like a shepherd, the Suffering Servant of Isaiah.\n\nHandel is aware that these Old Testament passages spoke first — and particularly — into their own times. But he insists, by the very structure of Messiah, that they do not say all that they have within them to say, until they say it in relation to Jesus Christ. Equally, he found that he could not tell the story of Jesus without drawing on these passages.\n\nThird, Handel underlines the fact that the Cross directs us to what is otherwise over­looked. He had taken profoundly into himself the crucial lesson that God defines himself by dying the degrading death of a slave. He had learnt the message of the Cross that God has chosen the lowly and despised things of this world, before the celebrated things (1 Corin­thians 1.27-8).\n\nAlthough Handel is generally known for the “muscularly triumphant” nature of his music, the opera critic Robert Thicknesse rightly describes him as “one whose best work treats with fathomless, appalled sympathy the wretched of the world: the traduced in love, the bereaved, the victimised, the dispossessed”.\n\nAlthough Handel is generally known for the “muscularly triumphant” nature of his music, the opera critic Robert Thicknesse rightly describes him as “one whose best work treats with fathomless, appalled sympathy the wretched of the world: the traduced in love, the bereaved, the victimised, the dispossessed”.\n\nIn Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, for example, he gives the best music not to the lovers, but to the spurned monster. Knowing that his Lord was despised and rejected of men, Handel directs our attention to all who are despised and rejected, that we do not miss something of Christ in them.\n\nFourth, Handel operates with a model of the Cross that is more than substitutionary — but not less. “Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows! He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniqui­ties; the chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes we are healed.”\n\nThat is what Handel sees in the Cross, and what he most admires in human beings is some small reflection of that love that gives itself for others — be it Didymus sacrificing himself for Theodora, or Alcestis for Admeto. Such im­pressive human representations go some way towards defusing the arguments of those who see substitution as immoral.\n\nFifth, for Handel, the Cross shows us how to live harmoniously with one another. His opera Berenice is typically tortuous in its romantic and political machinations. It is one of those “A loves B, B loves C, C loves A but has been promised to D” plots. Add to that the fact that A is Queen of Egypt, and Rome wants her to marry some Roman bigwig to cement an alliance against Rome’s current enemy, Pontus, and what you end up with is romantic, politi­cal, and diplomatic gridlock.\n\nAll the characters have their own goals, their own fears, and their own agendas, which are mutually contradictory and totally irrecon­cilable. Things seem to be heading inexorably towards war, until one relatively minor character, Arsace, renounces his claim on the Queen’s sister, despite having been promised her by the Queen.\n\nThis act of relinquishing his power and giving up his rights breaks the whole log-jam, and slowly the knot unties as others relinquish their rights, too. In the final scene, valid claims are waived, deceptions are forgiven, and har­mony is restored.\n\nThe same thing happens in Solomon, in the famous story of the two prostitutes (2 Kings 3.16-28), where the one who is the true mother gives up her right to the child in order to protect her baby’s life — and it is that which leads to understanding, to justice, and to right prevailing.\n\nSo often is that the message of Handel’s narratives that we may feel reasonably confid­ent that here we are somewhere near the heart of Handel’s view of life.\n\nThe ethicist Professor Nigel Biggar says that the lesson we must learn “about the just exer­cise of political power, about the use of power to heal and build relationships, is that nothing quite becomes it so much as the giving it up. . . So, if we would exercise power justly, in such a way as to promote the flourishing of human community, then we must practise the art of surrendering it” (from a sermon on John 10).\n\nThe Cross tells us that God himself surrendered his rights, sat loose to his status, and gave up the joys of heaven to become a man of sorrows, when he became a human being in Jesus of Nazareth, lived a human life, and died a human death. Therefore, when we give up our power and our rights to preserve or repair relationships, we are acting in a way that is not humiliating, but human: not degrading, but divine.\n\nThe Cross tells us that God himself surrendered his rights, sat loose to his status, and gave up the joys of heaven to become a man of sorrows, when he became a human being in Jesus of Nazareth, lived a human life, and died a human death. Therefore, when we give up our power and our rights to preserve or repair relationships, we are acting in a way that is not humiliating, but human: not degrading, but divine.\n\nLast, for Handel, the Cross guarantees that God is no dictator, no infinite imposer, no cosmic controller. Messiah ends with a vision of a slaughtered Lamb upon the throne — not a lion. God, as we meet him in Jesus, is the One who suffers violence — not the One who metes it out.\n\nPost-modernism has been summed up by the slogan: “All ideology reeks of the death camps.” Our generation understandably fears that if you believe anything too strongly, you will end up imposing it on others. But a world-view that is based on the Cross defuses that fear.\n\nChrist went to the Cross precisely because he would not impose his views or his vision on others. On the contrary, he allowed others to impose their agenda violently on him. He was no Samson, no Joshua, no Judas Maccabaeus, but the Lamb who was slain. Only with him on the throne may we be triumphant without being triumphalist.\n\nThe Revd Dr Lloyd is a lecturer at the St Paul’s Theological Centre, and Associate Vicar of St Andrew’s, Holborn, in London.\n\nSee Arts"
