        "text": "Kind Guardian readers have been forwarding me round robin Christmas newsletters for years now: lengthy missives full of perfect children, exotic holidays, talented pets and endless, tedious detail. The notes that accompanied them revealed they had inspired in the original recipients everything from mild irritation to absolute rage. \"I hate these people. Hate them, hate them, hate them!\" one reader wrote. Others complained that they received a letter year after year, even though it was two decades since they last encountered the writer, and had never met his wife, his children, or any of the other people mentioned. One reader forwarded a round robin that arrived every Christmas - addressed to the house's previous occupants, who had moved on 10 years before. \"They obviously haven't taken the hint of no reply for a whole decade.\" Some highlighted especially annoying passages with stabbing pens, or wrote sarcastic notes in the margin. On learning that a dog who barked at passing cars was being treated by a healer, one reader wrote, \"I nearly pulled a muscle.\"\n\nOthers detest the letters so much that sending them to me was clearly a way of purifying their homes: \"I was going to throw this away, but then I thought my wastepaper basket was too good for it, so I am sending it to you.\" One woman, in her fury, had ripped the letter to shreds, but this was not enough. It had to be exorcised, so she carefully Sellotaped it together and sent it to me.\n\nAlmost everyone to whom I mentioned the round robins had a story to tell about letters they had received. A particularly dazzling set of children. An especially smug description of a wonderful lifestyle involving organic vegetables grown in an idyllic rural setting. The innumerable holidays, all in the course of one year. Or a scary insight into some people's priorities: \"Sadly, Richard's mother died after a long illness while Richard was in Hong Kong. He could not interrupt the trip, so was unable to attend her funeral. But I feel that the rest of the family gave her a fitting send-off.\"\n\nSo great was this pent-up anger and frustration that I was inspired to put together a book. The task made for a very happy few weeks this summer, and the family got used to my shouts of joy when I discovered a perfect pippin, another prize bonbon concealed in the tub of bran. For instance, the multitalented girl whose teacher was asked by her mum at a parents' meeting if there were any areas of weakness they should be working on. \"Her reply was, 'No, you've given me a little diamond, and all I have to do is polish it.' \" Or, \"His teachers have nothing but praise for his achievements and his character. He completed his Amateur Swimming Association level 12 this year ... he began trombone lessons in September and already plays in the school band. In the Christmas performance, based on themes in the 1960s, he took the role of Bobby Moore, and was an enthusiastic participant in the Sheffield peace march.\"\n\nSometimes the writers attempt a little winsome humour to make themselves sound less complacent. It doesn't always work: \"Harry was Jesus in the school Jesus Christ, Superstar. This was the best production I have ever seen, youth or adult. Both boys, especially Harry, were physically and emotionally drained at the end. I was drained, too ... seeing your son crucified nightly is not an experience I would recommend - especially when he calls out for his mother.\"\n\nMany people just have far too much to tell you. I was sent a letter prepared annually by an academic in Scotland, who posts it to all his old students and friends. I estimate it is 39,000 words, including lengthy accounts of the year's parking problems and arguments with a neighbour. Or take the people who describe their holiday in Alsace, hour by hour, including how they started the jigsaw (\"I sift all the sky into light, medium and dark, sky with building, sky with foliage ... orange flowery bits and bricky bits ...\") and a grumpy complaint about a â‚¬2 parking fee.\n\nThere is the fellow who provides a minute-by-minute account of his day, beginning with, \"Rise at 7.12 to the sound of Radio 3, down to the kitchen to make the tea, kettle having boiled on a time switch. Put in milk until the reflection of the light in the cups is covered. Take it up to the bedroom, pour two cups. Turn on TV and watch breakfast until football comes on. Janet gets up and gets dressed . . .\" He continues with a namecheck for the brand of electric razor he uses, his health breakfast (\"half a banana and eight grapes\") and on to Sainsbury's for the high spot of the day, shopping! Followed by \"a cup of coffee and a bun, or biscuit\". This man's wife must be crawling up the wall, because she comments, \"I think we are stuck in a rut.\" He replies, \"Well, it's a lovely rut!\" Of course, she may have shot him before this year's letter got written.\n\nThen there's the chap who is feted at a conference in Dublin, but still finds time to moan that there was no soap in his room, months after the event. The way some people clearly feel they are cheating their readers if they don't fill in the whole of their lives: \"February, a peaceful month punctuated by dental check-ups.\" The tiny grudges held over an entire year: \"The gas men finally came on January 11. They were supposed to come at the beginning of December.\" The curious throwaway remarks that are meant to sound sophisticated but instead make you wonder about the writers: \"Our second holiday took us to the Red Sea riviera, from where we went to see the pyramids (overrated).\" Or the way people light on the most peculiar details: \"Peter has travelled extensively this year, most recently to Azad Kashmir. In a bazaar in Muzzaffarabad he met a bloke from Bradford.\" Or the people who go on holiday to Sicily and suffer from a leaky shower door and a wobbly toilet seat in their hotel bathroom. \"We thought the four-star rating may have had mafia connections.\" What would you think about getting that one December? \"Any news from the Parkinsons, darling?\" \"Not all good, I'm afraid. Looks as if the mafia arranged for them to have a wobbly toilet seat on holiday.\"\n\nI found myself wondering how I would react if, for example, someone I had known slightly at school, or who lived a few houses down the street until 1992, or whom my wife had once met at a conference, were to phone up and say something like, \"Just to let you know that we had a holiday in the Seychelles this year. Though we had booked a non-smoking room, we didn't get one. Our daughter managed five As and four starred As in her GCSEs, though we were a bit disappointed by the B in physics. Oh, and we've bought a brand new Volvo, and we thought you might like to know that the binmen didn't come at all the second Thursday in March ...\" You'd think they were stark, staring mad, suffering from a form of solipsism that had become a dangerous medical condition. Yet people appear to feel there is nothing wrong with doing exactly that in written form.\n\nIt is a mistake to imagine that all these letters are devoted to bragging. Almost as many consist of protracted whinges about the world, often in alarming detail. One chap sent a 2,000-word letter composed almost entirely of everything that had gone wrong with his life over the previous year. The first half of his letter is devoted to his medical misfortunes, which are many and diverse. His GP discovers high creatinine levels in his blood (I'm not sure what that means), and a kidney biopsy reveals damage caused by high blood pressure. They get that reduced, which means he is ready for a hip operation.\n\nThe hip dislocates twice, he is revealed to have a seriously high calcium level, and needs a spleen biopsy. His lymph glands are playing up and his blood needs thinning. These are just the highlights of his year. Then fate turns on his wife, who breaks a toe shutting a car door, then breaks another bone in her foot, followed by sciatica.\n\n(Why is it that these misfortunes, which, if they happened to anyone you knew, would make you rush to their aid, cause you to wipe tears of mirth from your eyes when they come out of the blue from a complete stranger?)\n\nAlmost nothing goes right in his life. A trip up the London Eye is wasted because it rains. Their car battery fails and they lose an expensive electronic key. Their daughter buys a new carpet but the fitters spill oil in the doorway. Their son breaks a wrist falling off a porch he was repairing. Then, at the very end of the letter, just as you imagine that nothing could possibly get worse, \"Snugs (Mr Snugglekins, our cat) has kept us on our toes. He has learned how to open the door of our new large fridge.\" And you think that on top of all the terrible medical news, the malfunctioning car, the accidents and all the other meticulously chronicled horrors of his life, this man has to cope with the pet-owner's worst nightmare - the cat that can help itself!\n\nI sometimes wonder why the letters don't reflect the reality of most people's lives. None of them seems to watch television or, if they do, they don't record it - apart from one family who are taken on by the Barb TV ratings people, and start by watching everything on BBC4 until they drift back to the rubbish. They get paid a small sum for this and, rather sweetly, are saving up for a set of kitchen knives. Occasionally a pub visit is mentioned, but only if it's special; nobody admits to spending much time or money there. The children are generally splendid - and we can hardly blame the writers, because the same children will probably see the letter - and none of them seems to have problems with drugs or even binge drinking. (Now and again some bad news creeps in, but it's rare.) Sex never appears, nor is even hinted at. No one ever writes, \"When we arrived to live in Fittleshaw, we were delighted to discover a flourishing and friendly wife-swapping group\", or even, \"Saturday is Rupert's lucky night - if he's been good during the week, that is!\"\n\nAnd yet, and yet ... People sometimes ask me if reading all these letters doesn't drive me to the edge of madness, but it doesn't. They are endlessly fascinating, rather like this time of year, when people keep their curtains open after dark and, as you pass down the street, you can peer in for half a second and spot a quick tableau - a family row, a young couple waiting for her parents to go out, a babysitter coping with fractious children - before you feel like a voyeur and hurry away. Even the dullest letters are compelling in their own way, if only because you're so relieved you don't know these people. As George Formby sang in When I'm Cleaning Windows, \"For a nosy parker it's an interesting job.\"\n\nIf you read the Daily Mail, you would imagine that the British middle classes lead lives of unremitting misery. If they live in towns, they are surrounded by violent crime. In the countryside, everything they hold dear is either being banned by the government or concreted over by travellers and John Prescott. Gordon Brown steals their income in taxes and raids their pension funds, so that in old age they will wear cardboard shoes and eat cat food.\n\nYet these letters tell, for the most part, the opposite story. Benefiting from the cheapest air fares in the world, the British middle classes fly off every year more times than their parents did in a lifetime. Their children are well educated, and learn in their spare time to play the flugelhorn, or go skiing, or take starring roles in musicals. Their gardens and allotments flourish. New conservatories rise like churches in Alabama. Conferences are attended, charity events are organised, church bring-and-buy sales come and go.\n\nNo doubt lots of these letters conceal some terrible truths. \"An added irony about this self-serving rubbish,\" one reader told me in a covering note, \"is that both him and her are well known for their affairs and casual screwing, so the stories about their happy, settled life are all the more pointless to those receiving them.\" And, of course, that is perhaps the main problem: there is almost always too much information. If you know these people, are related to them or live next door, or see them several times a year, you are aware of all this stuff. If you haven't met them for 15 years, you don't want to know. We get a round robin every year from people who were good friends but now live in Ireland. Their letter is genuinely interesting because we know the people and are happy to learn what they're up to. But most of us don't have so many friends like that.\n\nHelp is at hand, mind you. I got an email last month from Tilly the Newsletter Doctor, based somewhere in America. She examines your newsletter and tells you where you've gone wrong. She offers tips, of which one of the best is, \"Be selective with your address book. Your good friends will devour your letter, but the couple you met at Disney World may not.\" And she has an excellent list of don'ts: \"Don't create a letter written by your pets ... Don't write in verse, unless you're Maya Angelou [not even then, some would add] ... Don't namedrop or overwhelm with details ...\" She also recommends perking up your letter with a few choice turns of phrase. \"Don't just write, 'Bob is still a car nut'; instead, say, 'If Bob could, he would get the car inside the house and drive from room to room.' \"\n\nTilly, who you can find at universalworkshop.com/tilly, takes sterling, too. For Â£20 she will examine your rough draft and tell you how to liven it up. For Â£25 she'll turn your raw data into a newsletter, and for Â£50 she will prepare the whole thing, complete with pictures. I wish her well, but I hope it doesn't catch on.\n\nFor some of us - and I'm not the only one tilling this particular field - are dependent on a constant supply of unprimped letters, letters that devote 300 words to the tale of a light bulb that needed changing, 500 words to the astonishing success of the offspring, and 800 to a uniquely painful operation. We need letters describing disastrous holidays, such as the couple who visit Holland to see the bulb fields. The hotel is filthy and in the red light district, with prostitutes, junkies and drug dealers thronging the street outside. \"So on to the bulb fields, which turned out to be acres of bare earth, since they'd lopped all the heads off the week before our arrival.\"\n\nPlease keep them coming. I have a terrible feeling that the sarcasm and ribaldry many of us have heaped on these letters - the late John Peel was an aficionado, too - mean that people are becoming rather self-conscious. The spoof newsletter (\"John came down from his single-handed expedition up Everest to find himself arrested for multiple murders!\") is a new menace, driving out the echt raw material. We may not have much longer. Please help while you can"
