        "text": "Glad Tidings Santa is sure to delight any Santa collector. This hand crafted 26-inch Santa figure is dressed in a rich bright red velvet coat, with luxurious, soft, white faux fur trim. He has a gentle and happy hand sculpted face, made with polymer clay. Glad Tidings is signed and dated under his soft white Tibetan wool beard, which makes him a true Santa Claus collectible.\n\nBeside him is a large brown suede bag, overflowing with beautiful fabric and organza ribbon wrapped packages, silk pine and cedar branches. A Golden Retriever puppy is sitting by the bag of gifts, looking up at Glad Tidings, just hoping that one of those gifts is for him.\n\nThis beautiful Traditional Santa also has a 26-inch pencil pine tree beside him that easily lights up the entire setting. Like all Stone Soup Santas, Glad Tidings stands without help from a doll stand. His body is solidly made with wood and steel. He will make a wonderful addition to your Christmas season collection.\n\nDescription\n\nTo learn more about Stone Soup Santas or purchase a Santa, please give us a call at: (415) 927-3527.\n\nYou can also email us at: [email protected]\n\nWe look forward to talking with you!\n\nShelie and Richard McCall"
