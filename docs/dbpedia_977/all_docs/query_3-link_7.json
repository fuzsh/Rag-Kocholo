Each year, the Christmas concert presented by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square is seen by more than 85,000 people live and by millions more via television broadcast. It is a full-scale production featuring world-class musicians, soloists, dancers, narrators, and music that leaves viewers in awe year after year. This year, the Choir was joined by pop music sensation and platinum recording artist David Archuleta. David's clear and powerful vocals paired with the Choir's classic Christmas sound makes this album a must-have for any Christmas collection."
