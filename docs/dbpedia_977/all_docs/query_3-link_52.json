        "text": "A significant portion of the news we hear today on radio or see on TV has to do with bad news – war, crime, death, accidents, natural disasters and diseases. The noun “news” is more common in today’s usage than the Middle English word “tidings”. We mostly hear the word “tidings” at Christmas time, especially sung in the Christmas carols and used during the sermons. It is worth looking at its etymology.\n\nIn the Gospels, the King James version has translated the Greek verb “euaggelizo” which literally means “to tell the good news”. This is in reference to the proclamation made by the angels to the shepherds about the birth of Jesus Christ. In that context, the news that was announced was not doom and gloom but “good news”. It was a message to the world about hope, joy, salvation, forgiveness, redemption and love.\n\nThe term “euaggelizo” or glad-tidings is potent with goodness. While the noun “tidings” represents news which is information about something new, it is lost without the prefix “eu” as in the original Greek word. As we all know, almost all English words that begin with the prefix “eu” has something to do with “good” as in eulogy, euthanasia, euphemism, euphoria and even the word eunuch (do check its original meaning). In the Christian context, the word “gospel” or “god-spell” also has its origins from the same “tidings” with the prefix “eu”. It therefore looks like the noun “tidings” is better with the cohort “eu” or ideally collocated with the prefix “glad”. Both “glad-tidings” and the alternate translation “gospel” are synonyms for “good news”.\n\nGood news is not just a passive noun. It’s origin is active and from the translation of the verb euaggelizo – to proclaim or tell the good news. The shepherds were somewhat “shocked” at the appearance of angels in the darkness of the night. But what they heard was cause for joy, to the extent they hurried to the manger to celebrate the good news.\n\nWhile the media is responsible to present news (passively) to us in the raw and unadulterated format, would it be better for them to learn a little bit more about the real meaning of “tidings” and add some “goodness” to news?"
