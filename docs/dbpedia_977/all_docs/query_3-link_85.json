        "text": "The holiday e-card has hit critical mass.\n\nStudios, networks and a host of other biz companies have opted for digital holiday cards, saving untold numbers of trees and plenty in postage costs. But as always, there seems to be a competition among major players to add more oomph to the glad tidings in the Inbox.\n\nLaw firm Manatt, Phelps and Phillips sent out an animated vid detailing the boardroom negotiations over what to say on the card. It closes with a slate of fine print (“The wish, whether warm, neutral or cold, is under no obligation to come true”). Twen-tieth Century Fox TV chiefs Gary Newman and Dana Walden star in a Ryan Murphy-helmed vid featuring a guest shot from “Glee’s” Jane Lynch (who calls them “Garth” and “Diana”).\n\nGames were a popular addition to e-cards this year. Warner Bros. TV publicity’s e-card had a matching game. The Fox network PR department’s card featured a snowball fight game pitting users against Fox stars. Cartoon Network’s card allows users to build their own dancing mash-up animal (from parts of owls, poodles, ducks, etc.) to send to others.\n\nBut the piece de resistance came from Chuck Lorre, who remains a traditionalist with a physical card displaying his twisted sense of humor.\n\nA strong runner-up was the group shot from McG’s Wonderland Sound and Vision. Nothing says Merry Christmas like men and women clad in plaid."
