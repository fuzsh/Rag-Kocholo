        "text": "ALPENA — Christmas has many meanings to many people. For some, it means family — for others, it might mean presents.\n\nFor pastors all around the world, Christmas means spirituality and finding meaning in celebration.\n\n“Events like this, you’re not going to have the core of the church, you’ll have a lot of people that you don’t know if they are Christians or not,” Pastor Eldrick Lal of Living Hope Church said. “You don’t know — they just come and so you want to make sure you know prayerfully considering that you bring a sermon that does not tone down the message of the Bible on Christmas, but also uplifts people during that season.”\n\nLal said people need encouragement during the holidays because some people attending may not have good memories associated with Christmas.\n\nWhile Living Hope Church will only have a Christmas Eve service and nothing on Christmas, Lal said it’s a responsibility as a pastor to make sure the essence of Christmas is there and that people can be uplifted by his message.\n\nTo do that, Lal will speak about the story of an angel coming to the shepherds to spread the news of Jesus Christ being born.\n\n“The angel said, ‘Good tidings are glad tidings. I have great joy for you. And it is not for you, it is for all mankind,'” Lal said. “I’m preaching about why we needed glad tidings. My theme is that a savior is born and why we needed a savior — because there was something wrong. That’s why we need a savior. We don’t need a mechanic unless the car is fine. Right?”\n\nFr. Tyler Bischoff, pastor of All Saints Church, mentions something similar, saying that God wanted to build a relationship with mankind and sent his son to be like us, apart from sin.\n\nBischoff said the theme for his sermon will mostly be centered around relationships.\n\n“God wants a relationship with us so bad, that he would send his son to be like us in all things but sin, and even be with us in all of our feelings, all the experiences of what it means to be human, other than sin,” Bischoff said. “We’re made by a God of relationships — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We’re made in the image for relationships, so we’re meant for relationships.”\n\nThe Rev. Trenton Wollberg of Holy Cross Lutheran Church said that his sermon will focus on the mystery of Jesus’ incarnation and the magical curiosity that comes from his birth. He said that it will be a simple structure of a sermon, but that it’s still, nonetheless, important.\n\n“Is this savior really been born in your life?” Lal asks. “Oh, he’s born in a manger — good, we are fine with that. But the question is, is he born in your life?”"
