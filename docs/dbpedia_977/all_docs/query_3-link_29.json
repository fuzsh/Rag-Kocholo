        "text": "For my December blog post last year, I looked at several favorite Christmas carols, and then discussed how the lyrics of these different songs helped prepare my heart to welcome Christ anew during Advent–the season of anticipation leading up to Christmas. I decided to again use some of the songs of Christmas to help prepare myself in this late 2020 to welcome what is for me a desperately-longed for December 25th. It has been a rigorous year of pandemics and shut-downs, including enforced absences from so much of our usual human contact with family and friends. As a result, the comfort of the message of Jesus’ coming into the world amidst the dark and cold of winter is perhaps even more meaningful than ever. One of the ways that I have always most connected with the story and message of the birth of Christ is through the tremendous variety of beautiful and moving pieces of music that have celebrated His Nativity down through the ages. As I get older, I’ve grown to appreciate more and more not just those timeless and familiar Christmas songs like “Silent Night”, “O Little Town of Bethlehem”, or “Away in a Manger” that I grew up with, but also some of the rich tradition of Christmas music from other parts of the world. These different lyrical reflections all serve to remind us that at its heart, Christmas remains the celebration of a great mystery that has enthralled and captivated our souls since those long-ago shepherds and Magi first paid homage to an infant king. The life-changing truth of the Incarnation–that is the idea of the very God actually making His home with us, and coming down to share our time and space, remains at the holy core of Christmas. It’s a miracle so unique, and inspiring, as well as comforting in the way that it speaks to our human suffering, loneliness and despair, that no amount of Christmas commercialism or secular encroachment from Santa Claus or anyone else could ever fully extinguish this sacred flame which burns at the heart of the holiday. The wondrous mystery of the Incarnation is to me perhaps best captured in a single verse of Scripture, John 1:14—“And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.”\n\nThe glorious dream of God actually becoming man, and leaving the starry heavens to share human life in the mud, dirt and brokenness of earth, right alongside the humblest of us, is one that never ceases to inspire people across different cultures and time periods. And I truly believe that this core spiritual truth, although often underappreciated or perhaps not fully recognized by millions who celebrate December 25th, is still a significant reason why so many human hearts respond to this cherished winter festival. Even the avowedly secular, and people coming from non-Christian religious backgrounds seem to find something to like about Christmas, and while they would not necessarily admit it, I think this proves the venerable old truth of Ecclesiastes 3:11—“He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also He has put eternity in their hearts, except that no one can find out the work that God does from beginning to end.” In the midst of a time of year where, across the Northern Hemisphere at least, so much is dying, and landscape is bleak, the days short and dark, we all have an innate need to connect to some source of life and light that still remains. And that is what Christmas offers—with the miracle of the Incarnation of Christ giving us the chance to celebrate the arrival of the One True God into our midst. Not surprisingly then, so many Christmas songs celebrate this fact, and I now want to share from just a few from around the world that I’ve come to know and love, but perhaps are a little less known here in America.\n\nI’ll start with an ancient, 15th century English Christmas song “Adam lay ybounden”. The song, written in Middle English, celebrates a theological concept known as felix culpa, Latin for “blessed fault.” It’s the idea that despite the devastating introduction of death and the curses that resulted from the sin of the Fall, God also was working in that very moment to bring about eventual redemption through Christ. And so in a rather counter-intuitive fashion humanity’s original sin was actually a blessing in disguise, as it allowed God’s redemptive plan to then be set into motion, a plan that culminated with the coming of Christ into the world. The theological viewpoint expressed in the carol is further supported by the remarkable prophecy found Genesis 3:15, where God speaks to the Serpent regarding the future salvific of Jesus: “I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed. He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.” In the song itself, the first two stanzas lament Adam’s long wait for redemption through the coming of a Messiah to efface the effects of that first sin. “Adam lay ybounden, bounden in a bond; Four thousand winter thought he not too long/And all was for an apple, an apple that he took/As clerkës finden written in their book.”\n\nBut then the carol turns to focus on the blessings which God wrought even out of the chaos of the fall: “Ne {never} had the apple taken been, the apple taken been, Ne had never Our Lady, A-been heaven’s queen. Blessed be the time that apple taken was! Therefore we may singen Deo gratias [thanks to God]!” As the lyrics relate, Mary could not have become blessed as the mother of Jesus, nor would any of us have experienced the miracle of God’s redemptive love in Christ, or known the forgiveness offered as His blood was shed at Calvary…had not first the need for all this arisen because of the sin of Adam and Eve. Perhaps it’s not everyone’s idea of obvious subject matter for a Christmas song, but I love how “Adam lay ybounden” takes us all the way back to the beginning, to celebrate God using even our greatest mistakes to propagate His own glory in the world through Jesus. Furthermore the connection the song makes between Christ and Adam is a very Scriptural one. Paul repeatedly describes Jesus’ salvific work in terms of comparison to the first man. Thus Jesus is regarded as a second or “last” Adam. 1 Corinthians 15:21-22:—“For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive.”\n\nAnother Christmas song that expresses some deep Scriptural truths about the Incarnation was written by no less illustrious a personage than Martin Luther, the father of the Protestant Reformation. Luther, in addition to being an eminent theologian, was also known as a hymn-writer of significant ability. His most famous composition in the English-speaking world is no doubt “A Mighty Fortress is our God”, which has always been one of my personal favorites, but Luther was also responsible for penning a Christmas classic that is quite well known in Germany—“Vom Himmel Hoch, da komm ich her” (I come here from heaven above) The song uniquely examines the birth of Christ from two different perspectives: heavenly and earthly. In fact, Luther supposedly envisioned that when his Christmas song was performed publically, the first five verses would be sung by a man dressed in angelic garb, as they are written from the point of an angelic visitor from heaven who is coming to share the good news of Jesus’ birth with the inhabitants of earth. The remaining verses were then to be sung by children, with their innocence and purity of heart, they strive to welcome Jesus with all joyfulness. The first verse begins with the angel’s good news: “From heaven above to earth I come, to bear good news to every home/Glad tidings of great joy I bring/Whereof I now will say and sing:” Then a few stanzas later, in verse 3, Luther seeks to solidify his description of the miracle of Christ’s birth, and specifically why it is good news for all of us here on earth. “’Tis Christ our God who far on high/Hath heard your sad and bitter cry; Himself will your Salvation be/Himself from sin will make you free.” The next line continues: “He brings those blessings, long ago, prepared by God for all below/Henceforth His kingdom open stands/To you, as to the angel bands.” And then we hear in their stanzas, the children, with modesty and love for Jesus echoing the feelings of devotion and unworthiness that so many Christians have sensed before the awe-inspiring miracle of the Incarnation: “Welcome to earth, Thou noble guest/through whom e’en wicked men are blest/Thou com’st to share our misery, what can we render, Lord, to Thee!”\n\nThe carol continues later—“Ah! dearest Jesus, Holy Child/Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled/Within my heart, that it may be/A quiet chamber kept for Thee.” Luther’s joy in this, the arrival of a Savior, who would give up His glory to come to us in our human need, is one that we can easily share in. And the Apostle Paul expresses a similar position in Philippians 2:6-7: “[Jesus)” Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.” Hymns like “Vom Himmel Hoch” help to remind us that in our meditations on the miracle of the Incarnation, remembering the pre-existence of Christ is so critical. A new Savior isn’t simply born into a human body in a Bethlehem manger, but rather He who was is and always will be God, actively relinquishes the glory of heaven to come down, and redeem us from our miseries here on earth.\n\nAnother beautiful song of Christmas, which comes to us from Spain, narrates how various elements of Creation itself celebrate the coming of Christ. It’s entitled, “En Belen tocan a fuego” (roughly—“In Bethlehem a fire begins”). The song builds off the idea of bells tolling to announce a fire, but in this case the flames are heavenly, signifying Christ’s coming. The first verse announces the good news: “In Bethlehem a fire begins/From the manger come the flames/For they say He was born, the redeemer of souls.” Fire of course has a long association with God from throughout the Bible, going back to the Old Testament, and its use as a marker of God’s presence while He led the Children of Israel through the Egyptian wilderness. Later, John the Baptist heralds Jesus’ coming, proclaiming in Matthew 3:11—“I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.” And then in the Book of Acts, the Holy Spirit’s entrance amongst Jesus’ disciples on the Day of Pentecost is marked by the appearance of tongues of fire hovering above each head in that room. The song goes on to chronicle in its chorus how other elements of the natural world celebrate the arrival of the Savior: “Fish in the river jump and dance/they jump and dance to see God’s birth/Fish in the water jump and dance/They jump and dance to see the dawn’s birth.” A later verse adds: “The Virgin washes clothes, and hangs them on the rosemary bush/The birds sang, and the water flowed rejoicing.” Some may object to these fanciful imaginings of animals and inanimate flames and water rejoicing at the Messiah’s birth, but don’t forget that Paul personifies all of the physical world as trembling in anticipation for God’s redemptive work to be completed in Romans 8. Verse 19: “For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the songs of God.” And then then Romans 8:21-22—“Because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now.”\n\nI want to close by revisiting a familiar hymn in its original language. “O Holy Night” was a 19th century French composition whose original title is “Cantique de Noël”—(“Song of Christmas.”) Although it’s a beautiful, and very moving song in any version thanks in part to the breathtaking score of Adolphe Adam, a literal translation of the original French lyrics of Placide Cappeau reveal with great clarity the miraculous truth of the Incarnation of Christ, as celebrated from the framework of a Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve—{“Midnight, Christians, is the solemn hour/When God as man descended unto us to erase the stain of original sin/And to end the wrath of His Father/The entire world thrills with hope on this night that gives it a Savior.” And given the magnificent realization that our salvation has entered the world in the form of this little child, the next verse calls us to check our pride, in humble adoration of the King born in a manger: “May the ardent light of our Faith guide us all to the cradle of the infant/As in ancient times a brilliant star guided the Oriental kings there/The King of Kings was born in a humble manger; O mighty ones of today, proud of your greatness/It is to your pride that God preaches/Bow your heads before the Redeemer!” What a beautiful summation of the joy of God becoming man, along with the correspondingly worshipful attitude that we should display in coming before the Lord."
