        "text": "We are in the midst of the holiday season – the season of merriment and good cheer. All around us, we see signs of joy and good will. Homes are decorated with holiday lights, in so many different colors and patterns, and many lawns are covered with holiday decorations and lighted displays. These decorations and lighted displays have taken up the very spots that were covered with political lawn signs only a few short weeks ago.\n\nThe displays of Christmas trees, lighted doves, sparkling Santas, glistening snowmen and even a few lighted penguins now stand proudly where political slogans once stood. This isn’t to suggest that I don’t like political signs, because I really do. As you know, I am just finishing my 20th year of service in political office and I have campaigned in 10 elections – more, if you count the primaries. During college, I worked for other candidates. So I completely understand the purpose and necessity of political lawn signs.\n\nBeing involved in politics and communications for over two decades, I find political lawn signs interesting and a great case study in communication messaging. We do see innovative slogans from time to time, slogans like “I get results,” “True Leadership” or “Honesty and Integrity.” But, I have to admit that I find these a bit confusing; what exactly is the message here? Is it that this candidate is really great, or is it insinuating that the opponent is really bad?\n\nOn the other hand, the slogans that some candidates use to describe their opponents are certainly easier to decipher: slogans like “Bought and Paid For,” “Corrupt,” “No Good” or “Unethical.” In these cases there’s no room for guessing; we can pretty clearly understand what the candidate is saying about the opponent.\n\nDuring one of my elections, an opponent of mine used really imaginative slogans to describe me. My neighbors were treated to flyers telling them about my shortcomings regularly. And for those of you who might wonder why we call these types of slogans attack ads, I’ll share with you a short story: my daughter, very young at that time, just matter-of-factly said at one point, “Mom, I feel like we are deer and your opponent is the hunter.” She decided to boycott the mailbox and stop getting the mail because she was afraid of what might be in it.\n\nBut election season only lasts so long, and before you know it the political flyers are replaced with holiday cards wishing everyone prosperity, health, happiness and joy. And then, once again, my daughter was happily skipping out to the mailbox to see what glad tidings her friends may have sent to us.\n\nThis is why I think it’s really great that the holiday season comes right after the election season. Election slogans have been replaced with songs of good cheer, glad tidings and peace on Earth. When we turn on the television, instead of hearing political attack ads, we see singing elves and hear songs about yuletide and cheer. The only evil person depicted on TV is the green cartoon, the Grinch who stole Christmas. So, we can once again take up singing along to the TV commercials.\n\nBut, most importantly, the holidays give us a chance to pause and remember that we are a community. The success of our neighborhoods, our city, state and our country rely on all of us working together. When we respect our differences, we can learn from each other and come together to find common ground. Our disagreements and our differences can open our eyes to a new solution or idea we had not thought of and actually help us find better solutions to the problems we face.\n\nI have been fortunate to work with dedicated and serious public servants throughout my legislative career. I feel fortunate to have called them colleagues in government. I strongly believe that we are fortunate to have so many committed and hardworking public officials working on our behalf on the local, state and federal level. And, from my vantage point, I have seen time and again that some of the very best pieces of legislation come from the work of many different voices. The work of government involves all of us – elected and non-elected – coming together, speaking and working cooperatively and collaborating. When we respect our neighbors, our colleagues and our elected officials, it is amazing the good work that we can accomplish.\n\nAnd, over the next several weeks, or as long as the Herald allows me to continue writing this column, you can expect an exchange of ideas and opinions about a variety of issues. There is a lot to talk about, and I’m sure there will not be a scarcity of issues facing us. But, be warned, there will be no slash and burn rhetoric here. This will be a column that respects and discusses different perspectives; now you understand the name of the column.\n\nIn the meantime, let’s keep singing the holiday classics and doing the Jingle Bell Rock. Let’s sing about kindness, generosity, good will and peace toward all. In a few short weeks, we will have the opportunity to put these themes into practice by working together, in the spirit of cooperation and good will, to find innovative solutions and tackle the problems facing us in the New Year. So, enjoy the holidays; it certainly is a joyous time. Excuse me while I get myself a peppermint mocha and watch “It’s a Wonderful Life.”"
