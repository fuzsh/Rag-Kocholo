        "text": "Good tidings of great joy\n\nPublished 3:08 pm Thursday, December 23, 2010\n\nBy Emily Agee\n\n“Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding. O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own. I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee. O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee” (1 Chronicles 29:13-18).\n\nThought for the week: “Behold, I Bring You Good Tidings of Great Joy”\n\n“Glad tidings herald the Christ Child’s birth “Joy to the World” and “Peace on Earth” Glory to God” — let all men rejoice and hearken once more to the Angel’s voice…it matters not who or what you are, all men can behold the Christmas Star — for the Star that shone is shining still in the hearts of men of peace and good will, if offers the answer to every man’s need, regardless of color or race or creed…So, joining together in brotherly love, let us worship again our Father above, and forgetting our own little selfish desires may we seek what the Star of Christmas inspires.”\n\nWorship service at Holly Grove Baptist Church in Jemison began with praise service of scripture, songs and prayer. The scripture was read by Charles Arrington with prayer by Pastor Dukes and Willie Nunn. Songs sung included, “Come and Go To That Land” and “Bless the Lord With Me” by Bro. Jim Ginn, and the 100th Psalm, which he sang in Hebrew.\n\nPastor Dukes brought the message: His theme was, “Do You Put Everything Before God?”\n\nSometimes we look for God in all the wrong places. He doesn’t dwell in unclean places. He doesn’t dwell in your money or things. God is the stabilizer if you put him first. It’s to your advantage to put him first. The woman with the issue of blood should have put him first. Press your way toward Christ to touch him. Whatever your issue is, turn to Christ. He has what you need. It’s a benefit to seek him; you will be his son or his daughter. When you seek God, he will speak to you. Others will see the change in you and say it looks like you have been in God’s presence. Seek you first the Kingdom of God. God is the King; do what he said. Seek and surrender to his authority.\n\nThe service concluded with remarks by Pastor Dukes.\n\nOur sympathy goes out to the family of Mrs. Brenda Nunn Childers in their time of bereavement. Funeral services will be held today (Thursday) at 1 p.m. at Shiloh Baptist Church in Jemison. Agee Brother’s Funeral Home directing.\n\nOn our sick list this week we ask you to remember in your prayers: Sam and Vivian Hicks, Flora B. Franklin, Stanley Frazier, Joseph McCall, Lee Anna Worthey, JuaJetta Kine, Jerry Wilson and Robert Spence. May God heal, strengthen and keep them in His care is our prayer."
