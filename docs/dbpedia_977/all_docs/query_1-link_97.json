        "text": "Hello, folks.\n\nWhat would be the best or quite closer synonym for to give glad tidings ?\n\nThe context, if needed:\n\nA farmer's son run to his dad telling him:\" Dad, our cow has just given birth to a calf\"\n\nFather:\" May God give you glad tidings \"\n\nThanks for all\n\nWhere did you see or hear this conversation?\n\n'Glad tidings' means 'good news', which doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nPretty much the only place I've ever heard 'glad tidings' is in the Christmas carol 'While Shepherds Watch:\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nGlad tidings of great joy I bring\n\nTo you and all mankind.\n\nWhat would be the best or quite closer synonym for to give glad tidings ?\n\n\"Glad tidings\" is archaic English (no longer used) for \"good news\".\n\nSo \"to give someone glad tidings\" means \"to tell someone good news\".\n\nA farmer's son run to his dad telling him:\" Dad, our cow has just given birth to a calf\"\n\nFather:\" May God give you glad tidings \"\n\nThis is incorrect. Where did you see this? What is your source?\n\nAs has been said, it means \"good news. Therefore your story would be as follows:\n\nA farmer's son runs to his dad telling him:\" Dad, our cow has just given birth to a calf\" (This is good tidings/good news)\n\nFather:\" May God give you good news.\" (This doesn't make sense. The son has already given good news to his father)\n\n\"May God give you X\" is a wish for the future. It does not relate to things that have already happened.\n\n[The scene is England 400 years ago, a messenger is brought before the King]\n\nKing: \"What tidings of Lancaster bringest thou?\" Modern English = What news have you got about the Duke of Lancaster?\n\nMessenger \"I bring glad tidings - The French are at his hands defeated\" Modern English = \"I have good news, he has beaten the French.\"\n\nChasint. In the Arabic text, the father's response is:\" May God please/give you glad tidings/good news\".\n\nPaulQ. The son came telling his father immediately :\" Our cow has just given birth to a calf\". That is why is has father responded \" May God ...\"though I do know this sounds strange to you.\n\nAgain, thanks for all\n\nChasint. In the Arabic text, the father's response is:\" May God please/give you glad tidings/good news\".\n\n{...}\n\nIt may be a cultural difference.\n\nCould you explain in a longer paragraph, what the father is asking God to do? The good news has already been given - there is a new calf. Do they want God to provide even more good news? It doesn't make sense in English.\n\nCould you explain in a longer paragraph, what the father is asking God to do? The good news has already been given - there is a new calf. Do they want God to provide even more good news? It doesn't make sense in English.\n\nThis is idiomatically said in Arabic. It might be the verb tense or mood that throws you off\n\nMay God give you good news\n\nI beseech God to bless you with\n\n{...}\n\nI beseech God to bless you with\n\nThat's what I'm asking. \"I beseech God to bless you with ... what?\" Some more good news that is different from the news you have just given me?\n\nOr is it just a general wish that God will continue to bring good news?\n\nOr is it just a general wish that God will continue to bring good news?\n\nExactly so, Chasint\n\nSo, the final answer is this\n\nFather's response\" God will give you good news\" or still is clumsy?\n\nI think I've got it now. It means that God has brought good news by allowing the successful birth of a calf and the father is asking God always to bring good news. In doing so he acknowledges that God is the source of all good news.\n\nMy version (correct me if I'm wrong)\n\nA farmer's son runs to his dad telling him:\" Good news Dad, our cow has just given birth to a calf!\"\n\nFather:\" May God always give you good news my son.\"\n\nDoes that look right?\n\nI think I've got it now.
