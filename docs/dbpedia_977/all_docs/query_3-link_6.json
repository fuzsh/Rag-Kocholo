        "text": "Three years into the pandemic, covid cancelled our plans for Christmas and New Year’s celebrations. The first year our son couldn’t come for Christmas but our daughter drove home to see us; before the vaccine it seemed too dangerous to fly across the country. Last year we had a merry time with six of us here, both adult children and both their partners. This year we got covid, probably from someone my masked son passed by at LAX, so even though he and his fiancé were here, my daughter and her partner couldn’t join us.\n\nWe celebrated my son’s engagement and talked to his fiance’s parents over zoom, everyone feeling congratulatory that these two had found each other. They posed for me in the Christmas sweaters I had given them.\n\nWe’ve all learned ways of coping in the last three years; we had Christmas dinner by speakerphone and read our Christmas writing over zoom. This year’s theme was “tidings,” and I had chosen to write about the texts I’d gotten over the past year from both son and daughter, not realizing that the texts would continue over the holidays.\n\nI continued my pandemic tradition of buying a really good bottle of champagne for Christmas dinner, since we weren’t spending money going out anywhere, but this year four of us were too sick to enjoy it—me especially, since I was taking Paxlovid and everything tasted like metal. We cooked most of the dishes we enjoy and ate the meal off of the everyday china, because it was all we could do to load the dishwasher and no one was up to hand-washing the fancy china and crystal we usually get out.\n\nMy daughter and her partner came in the house briefly with everyone wearing masks so we could exchange gifts. They were driving around the weather, which derailed plans for many families in the U.S. this holiday season, and so we felt lucky we got to see them at all.\n\nMy husband and I weren’t feeling much but feverish on the day. The four of us with covid shared painkillers and cold remedies from a holiday-themed basket.\n\nAfter Christmas day, the four of us who’d had covid enjoyed sitting around recovering together. We watched some Christmas movies, including the Muppet Christmas Carol and Spirited, the new musical with Ryan Reynolds and Will Farrell. And we sat in front of the fireplace and had a tea and poetry reading. I read Philip Larkin’s poem “Fiction and the Reading Public” after our discussion of how Spirited panders to people who don’t want to change much, who want to feel better about making small changes rather than, for instance, quitting Twitter or getting out of media consulting entirely. Here’s Larkin’s poem:\n\nGive me a thrill, says the reader,\n\nGive me a kick;\n\nI don’t care how you succeed, or\n\nWhat subject you pick.\n\nChoose something you know all about\n\nThat’ll sound like real life:\n\nYour childhood, your Dad pegging out,\n\nHow you sleep with your wife.\n\nBut that’s not sufficient, unless\n\nYou make me feel good—\n\nWhatever you’re ‘trying to express’\n\nLet it be understood\n\nThat ‘somehow’ God plaits up the threads,\n\nMakes ‘all for the best’,\n\nThat we may lie quiet in our beds\n\nAnd not be ‘depressed’.\n\nFor I call the tune in this racket:\n\nI pay your screw,\n\nWrite reviews and the bull on the jacket—\n\nSo stop looking blue\n\nAnd start serving up your sensations\n\nBefore it’s too late;\n\nJust please me for two generations—\n\nYou’ll be ‘truly great’.\n\nWe read lots of other poems; we didn’t have anywhere else to go or much of anything else to do. We made peanut men, who carried ornaments to our tree, although some of them also fought each other with cocktail swords.\n\nThe cats liked it that we mostly sat around, although they were not fans of our sedentary laser tag game because of the sound effects.\n\nWe observed a few of our New Year’s traditions over zoom and text, although my daughter didn’t get to share in our New Year’s feast and couldn’t even have her own, since she got home to an apartment with a broken refrigerator. She and her partner did get home without catching covid, however.\n\nOur revels now are ended. How were yours this year?"
