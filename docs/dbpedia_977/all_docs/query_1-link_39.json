It is centuries of history acting as a faithful witness to the fact that God keeps His promises, every one. Glad Tidings of Great Joy explores five of these wonderful promises, that through these, we might celebrate Him all the more! For God so loved explores what it means to believe even as God promises that all who believe on Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Come and See explores the meaning of faith wherein God has promised that we are saved by grace, through faith. Faith is not blind; rather it is founded on the truth of Gods Word and anchored in the proofs (the evidence) of everything He has shown us through it! Come and see God with us is a refreshing look at Psalm 23 wherein David gives us a vivid and vibrant picture of life with God; Gods promise to ever be with us! Unto us a Child is Born is a study of Gods first and greatest promise, the promise given to Adam and Eve whereby redemption and reconciliation would be ours through the Seed of the woman. Christmas is the celebration of Jesus birth, and the basis of our faith that He will similarly keep all of His promises! Our God reigns is a glorious picture of Jesus, He who holds the keys of Death and Hades; He who stands strong, victorious, our Savior; the everlasting Lord of lords and King of kings, our amazing God! Glad Tidings of Great Joy is good news of enduring hope.\n\nTaschenbuch.
