        "text": "At Christmastime, homes and stores are flooded with festive music that gives me butterflies of excitement. I can't help it. There's nothing like Christmas to make one feel like a little kid again.\n\nAnd while I find myself dancing to \"Rocking Around the Christmas Tree,\" melting at Nat King Cole's \"Christmas Song,\" and tearing up at \"I'll Be Home for Christmas,\" the holiday songs that truly change me are those that testify of the Savior and His love for us.\n\nThis year, LDS Living has had the honor of sharing many such songs by LDS artists, but here are a select few that opened our eyes and helped us reflect on the true gift of the season—the birth of Jesus Christ.\n\n\"Son of God\" shares the story of the holy night of Christ's birth from a different perspective—that of Mary, a mother elated at the birth of her perfect Son and frightened at the thought of all He will have to face and bear. This original song by Paul Cardall, featuring Patrice Tipoki, will have you thinking of the Nativity in an entirely new way—one that makes that sacred night more personal and meaningful.\n\n\"Son of God\" is featured on Paul Cardall's latest CD, A New Creation, which takes listeners on a spiritual journey from the creation of the world to the ultimate salvation of mankind and features a new song written by Elder David A. Bednar.\n\nThe Mormon Tabernacle Choir's Christmas music video took a relatable, modern-day take on a beloved Bible story—that of the prodigal son. Grab a box of tissues as you watch this beautiful video that connects to so many of our experiences with our family.\n\n► You'll also like:Tabernacle Choir Releases Touching New Christmas Video Set in Prison\n\nFor more beautiful Christmas songs from the Mormon Tabernacle Choir that will bring the Spirit into your home this holiday, check out Glad Christmas Tidings, or for a fun family Christmas movie featuring the muppets from Sesame Street, check out Keep Christmas with You.\n\nHow did Mary feel as she prepared to give birth to the Son of God in a manger far away from home? LDS artists Madilyn Paige and Wayne Burton teamed up to create a simply stunning cover of Amy Grant's \"Breath of Heaven\" that gives us a little insight into Mary's perspective.\n\n\"Breath of Heaven\" and other beautiful Christmas songs are featured on the brand new album, Come Let Us Adore Him.\n\nAbout this beautiful video, GENTRI posted to Facebook. \"We live in a world where we are sometimes prone to judgment. Perception becomes our reality. In our haste, we can jump to false conclusions and lose opportunities to lift and lighten the loads of others. As we allow the light of Christ to work miracles within our own heart, we then are empowered to work wonders in the lives of others. May His perfect example of love and compassion for all guide us in our own charity towards those around us this Christmas season and always.\"\n\nAfter their incredible Christmas mashup hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts last year, GENTRI released a full-length holiday album, two years in the making.\n\nWritten as a personal prayer, this beautiful Christmas song by David Archuleta provides a depth and humility that will leave you inspired and thinking of the true meaning of Christmas.\n\nDavid Archuleta - My Little Prayer - #LIGHTtheWORLD\n\nFor more from David Archuleta, check out Other Side Of Down, which shares fun, optimistic messages that you'll love to listen to again and again.\n\nPerformed by LDS artists Garth Smith and Calee Reed, this stunning version of \"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" was filmed in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building on Temple Square.\n\nAbout this video, Garth Smith posted on Facebook, \"The message helps us to understand that the events in Bethlehem on that sacred night were the beginning of Jesus Christ's 'Lighting the World' with his birth, life, death, and resurrection. We can 'Light the World' with heartfelt acts of service, no matter how small, that reflect the Spirit of Christ and show our love for our fellow man.\"\n\nFor more from these artists, check out Calee Reed's The Waiting Placeand Garth Smith's beautiful arrangement ofSacred Hymns.\n\nWith just a guitar and her voice, 16-year-old Stephanie Toney sings a cover of \"Mary Did You Know\" filled with such power, simplicity, and passion it will change how you hear this beautiful song.\n\nLDS artists Nick Sales and Anna Richey teamed up to create a powerfully moving version of \"O Holy Night\" that's unlike any Christmas song you've probably heard before. With stunning harmonies and great instrumentation, this hymn takes on new meaning and a new rhythm in this exciting video.\n\nHow many powerful, soul-melting voices can you fit on one stage at a time? BYUtv's \"Christmas Under the Stars\" must have broken a new record when they featured Peter Hollens, Madilyn Paige, Ryan Innes, Vocal Point, and the One Voice Children's Choir singing this gorgeous rendition of \"Joy to the World.\" Check it out!"
